Legitimate complain would be if it was other game ad or only out of game store ad (look at you blizzard) but here it's EVE article on a EVE luncher, a luncher you see for what ? 2 sec the time you play on "lunch all account" ? But nah, eve community who always want dev to bring new thing into this game had to go on autistic stretching  "mimimimimi they were ad before and we said nothing but this time it's enough why there is the exact same ad "

When you realise that nobody fights it wh space until they've pinged their whole alliance because there are no ways to force a fight, and fights come twice a week.

Try putting it into your ship's cargo first? Or try dropping it into the middle of the fitting window where the ship is floating? I know I usually drop them in the middle there, and they sort themselves out.

woosh

can we go longer?

just want to show some love for my corp, alliance and imperium mates. this last month and week in particular i have left my ratting and f1 ways. searching, hunting- with the hope of finding content to share and sharpening my skills. 
---

---
shade,hidra,hole: ty so much for your patience. you put your reputations and fleets on the line, night after night, trusting my intel and taking my words as truth. i have whiffed, welped, or worse - and you keep giving me shots, ty brothers.
---
corp mates: you know my incompetence better than anyone, and every ping you come out to support your shoop. when i whiff you get my head back on straight and push me to get back at it. you are the reason i log in night after night, and your support has always been appreciated.
---
bastion,init,tnt,goons : seeing your lines on lawn-pinged fleets is heart warming. y'all got so much going on, but still have time to support our shenanigans. you have shared your inspiring content with us for so long, ty for the chance to pay it back.
---
 
---
Looks like it's due to it being in my station container. Which is unfortunate because I was using that as my main storage, and use the item hanger for salvage/selling because it's the only one that lets you sell out of it. Not sure why CCP did it that way. :/

Npc null can support a very limited number of people (unless you run missions, but most players have -10 faction standings so gl with that) so it will be small gang by default. But not for pew within the region, population is way too thin for that. It's good place for a base and suicide roams into nearby sov.

Logistics are typical deep null. Alliance, red frog, wormholes, contracts, build hulls. A bit of planing, patience and hoarding needed but it's not a "huge" problem.

"Redline's Best lines" compilation when?

If you are not trained to help, you are doing more harm than good by not sending them to a professional. The organization in question took in a ton of donations and it appears someone absconded with it. The people that this program was intended to help (depressed or suicidal) should seek professional help, not help from random people on the internet. 
---
What happens when people just lend a friendly ear? We end up having cyno vigils.

uhhhh idk chief, I have no medical degree, but I’d say having an illness for not a long time is better
---
&gt; 1) The launcher project is shipped. It's in production. They aren't revisiting it in any large sense for a long time.
---
Waterfall much?
---
&gt; 2) (...) What's the user use case - fire up the launcher and stare at it before going into the game? 
---
Yes, so at the end of the staring you might expect to actually get into the game. Doesn't always happen.
---
lol what are you talking about. Most of the time there's a bridging Titan right there for your Retribution or tackle frigate. Additionally, Theta is a primarily a krabbing fleet, so not having to jump should be a good thing. If somebody is clearing away the neuts on their own you don't need to be envious. To get your fill of combat open Jabber and attend one of the pinged ops.
---
&gt; ALL MY ACCOUNTS WERE STILL THERE WHEN IT UPDATED WHICH BLEW MY FUCKING MIND
---
Did they outsource the launcher to someone else?
---
Ask your alliance.
---
no u
---
You see, it's not an actual problem and we all know it, but it's something really nice to get worked up on. And what else is EVE about more than emotions?
---
Rest in piece my old friend. I will miss our chats all the more now that I know there will never be another.
---
I don't even play anymore, but that doesn't stop me from autistic screeching.
---
Got my first killmark on it instead of whelping, nice
---
supposedly if you ever failed a hack and the module auto repeated you might be right at the start of the cycle and have to wait all the way till the end of the cycle before you could reattempt the hack. secondarily, it uses cap... but ive never found that to be an issue.
---
I believe you but where does it tell you the lock time in game? Cause I need that lol
---
u/ccp_falcon cmon man... Help these guys out!
---
That is the problem 
---
Now to just bait CODE with faked module value amounts /s
---
CODE isn't gonna care about this. Real gankers already have tools that just scrap their system clipboard and process the cargo value (and ships tank) more accurately with no heavy effort for the user.
---
true
---
You don’t need to be trained to listen.
---
"God" was already taken.
---
And no, there’s nothing wrong with having people to talk to.  And many of the vigils exists because of external factors eg cancer.  Yes vigils are more of a feel good, and yes donating to a random player run thing rather than say sucide prevention none profit was ah... less than smart.  But literally having an acquaintance to talk to helps.
---
Remember EVE was not broken... wait, there were plenty of bugs before
---
Of course, in no way did I mean the changes have been for the worse! lol
---
I did not know this was a thing. I am now glad that this is a thing.
---
Having used a RL B4R service, one made of regular guys who'd been through shit on their own time, and who only had their own experience to share, I heartily endorse any service provided by people who just want to fucking help other people. 
---
Get behind this. You don't like the posts, don't read them!
---
*aligns revenant*
---
I do the same thing. But I usually go through and drop the mods I want for a ship into its cargo first. Then I drag them out and fit them.
---
So you can keep stuff in the container for storage, and the Item Hangar for salvage and selling. Just drop ship related stuff into that ship first.
---
Oh my.
---
google 'rooster', copy a bunch of image links, post them in local
---
Yeah that's a good point. Might start doin that.

---
Firstly if we think that a person is going to harm themselves, then we pass all the information on to CCP who contacts the relevant authorities.
---
Secondly, how exactly do you think we should be trained, we don't offer medical advise just try to support people and make them feel better. 
---
There are multiple reasons why a person choose to speak to us over a professional service. If they don't want to do it and want to seek help professionally then they can do that. If they want to come to an organisation like us then they should have that opportunity to do so and the choice to choose which they should use. Nobody should make that choice for them.

What is your starting capital?
---
Yes you do. You need to be trained to know what to listen for that are danger signs. It is people that just listen that cause people to harm themselves or others because they do not know what they are doing.
---
Train up your advanced industry skill, along with your mass production skills. Do ammo for common ratting fits near you try to be in null for best rates on taxes and job costs. If your corp or alliance has t1 doctrines make those. Use 10/20 bpos/bpcs whenever possible. The science skills are also important for making stuff since it is part of required skills for you.

There was a box of Captain Crunch next to my laptop, and Captain Crunch was already taken.
---
given how many times in just the last 12 months the CCP launcher broke and the third party launchers were the only way for paying customers to access what they were paying for until CCP unfucked their own launchers one would think they would be somewhat motivated to support these launchers even if they don't care about the rest of the third party software out there.
---
You should know how to fit your super by this time 
---
i love the Providence , and the apoc
---
1.) it took you 4 (?) answers to finally adress all points. Please. You tried to dogde them but it didn't work out.
---
  
---
2.) Ofc it is about wanting small gang to be easy. You know just as well that you would have all the advantages against small players on your side. I mean, I am ok with removing intel aslong as you compensate for the loss, but demanding that you should feast on eazy prey is no reason to change the game for you.
---
3.) I just listed you a bunch of advantages and I do believe that we have a somewhat level playing field. Infact, I do believe that you have way more advantages than you should have over PvE players. Yes, they do make compromises but in a game where you can win all the time if you are properly prepaired, knowing what ships the target can fly isn't just a "oh, that's nice to know but unimportant" kind of advantage, it's a seriously big deal.   
---
I am not sure if your ignorance is just ignorance or if you do that willingly, but come on. If you didn't NEED easy prey for your confined solopvp, you wouldn't demand it. You would just adapt to the situation and go hunting efficiently, within a group.   
---
Don't get me wrong, solo is a playstyle, but confining yourself to just solo is just dumb and stupid. What's actually retarded is: the game evolved away from you, you refuse to adapt to what we have and you cry that it should be catered back to you. HTFU!   
---
Solo playstyle isn't about going solo for players that actively try to avoid you, it's all about catching the unprepared (one way or another) and thus local is your biggest and most impactful enemy.  
---
4.) Yes ofc, if you are up against a numbers advantage, you need more players. What sort of Entitlement makes you think that you can go against, if we play this through to the end, the whole entire universe all on yourself and WIN? Because that's the final endpoint of your demand to have a chance of winning no matter what the numbers are against you. Do you really think that should be the way things should be? If yes, you should consider playing a different game. One that suits your playstyle and where you can go against everything all on your own. These games are usually offline games so you'll save sub-fee or time grinding it too.   
---
At some point, you need more numbers to counter the numbers advantage. I know you don't like it, but demanding that you should have a chance alone no matter how many players are on the opposite site is flat out ridiculous.   
---
5.) Yes you do have 95% intel. You know what ships the enemies fly and you can counter the ship before you undock. Bring a spychar and you can check the anoms in a cloak long before you even arrive. And come on, do you really believe you have no advantages? Because if you do, then you are dellusional.   
---
6.) If you haven't figured out that all the empirical evidence points to the fact that more ISK making leads to more PvP activity in the game then you are an uneducated player and you absolutely know nothing and I mean nothing about player motivations in EvE. 
---
With the ammount of ISK making, PvP activity goes up and I've tried to educate you on that before by giving you reasons (no examples because they are readily available on the MER). Yeah sure, the price of spod will raise if there are less miners, minerals prices will balance themselves out in the short term.   
---
In the long term, a rise in mineral prices from reduced Isk making will lead to higher ship prices. Higher ship prices will lead to a higher demand for isk making. Less safety for isk making will make it less appealing and will increase the time it takes to grind the necessary isk to PvP and thus, players will have less time to PvP because they need to farm more isk. And not at a good ratio, because both factors will increase the time to make isk exponentially and thus, will reduce the time to PvP exponentially too. 
---
Add to that that major wars in EvE just don't happen if both participants are poor. You (should) know that one of the reasons players happily engage in Alliance-Level PvP is SRP and if ISK making is harder, all alliances will have less isk to wage war with (exponentially too because ship prices increase because of your very awesome change).   
---
So, we'll end up having even less meaningful content from Alliance-Level PvP (which is the biggest source of destruction) too.   
---
If you still think this is not the case then do the following: Check the MER's and compare it with a timeline of major events. The first noticable changes are the rorqual / alpha changes in november 2016. Go check that and see that this has stabilized player numbers from their freefall before november 2016 and notice how it increased the ammount of destruction in the game from an average of 1T per month before the changes to around 1.3 - 1.5T per month on average.   
---
Then, check the numbers of delve and notice how the ammount of lost ISK is the highest isk lost of any region, with the exclusion of major battles in major wars.   
---
Last but not least, check the numbers for regions that were made extremely unsafe (like GoTG space or Kalevala when they were camped) and notice how the activity dropped.   
---
Now, use your brain and put that all into one picture and if you then  still believe that ISK making and PvP activity aren't deeply connected, then something is seriously wrong with you.   
---
Don't get me wrong, I do believe that easy kills have a necessary place in EvE and that the game has evolved away from solo PvP over the years. I know you don't like it (and I can relate to having your game change away from your personal playstyle), but unless you adress all these issues properly, the game won't become better - it will become worse.   
---
Yeah, you can remove local but you need to do it reasonably while considering all the implications and change some system along with it. Pretending that these problems wouldn't exist because your playstyle narrows down your mind into a very one sided mindset is wrong. It's not how you find good solutions, it just isn't and the fact that you believe that you alone have an answer (by claiming there are no good reasons to keep local) makes you a part of the problem and not a part of the solution.   
---
1-5 are ofc opinions, 6 isn't. 6 is my interpretation about existing evidence. 
---
If there is one thing I would like you to do is to check the numbers and give me your interpretation.   
---
I don't claim this is the ultimate truth and I am open to a discussion, but I claim that my interpretation of available data makes sense. If you think otherwise, then feel free to share your interpretation.

The bundles are worth it when they go on sale. Look at green man gaming or humble bundle. This sub usually points it out too. They usually go on sale for 50% off which is a steal mostly for the plex + game time.

Ah, ok, thanks for the response haha. I'm just used to other systems where tickets get closed.

yeah you don't need a cyno

You could just put out your own bait and get kills?

 The only thing stopping you getting kills is your laziness and inability to do something other than jump to someone else's cyno.

The exact details of the site aren’t out yet, but usually you’ll want a battlecruiser or equivalent like a pirate/faction cruiser for optimal looting. A T1 Cruiser will probably work, but might lack tank, and a Battleship is typically too slow to move between systems hunting for them (unless it’s a Machariel)

To those who didn't see his comments before he deleted them, he was bitching about the very existence of ganking in the game, and said this change was "CCP condoning ganking" which they've done for 16 years.

Check out the Vexor Navy Issue: VNI - Nullsec Anomaly Ratter on this page: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Vexor_Navy_Issue/Fittings
---
EvE university is a great website and corp to learn all there is to learn about this massive game. Spend some time on that site, check out the EvE help in-game channel, and consider putting in an application there. They do a lot of events both pvp, pve and training.
---
Seems it might be up your alley. :) Good luck and fly safe! o7
---
Really just the in game market history speaks for itself. The spike in price and subsequent cost of plexing a character has skyrocketed
---
Okay, so lets say I do that and jump through the gate... is there any way to know whats on the other side or just 'surprise!'?
---
That's like fighting a fish in water.
---
&gt; Had to drop supers to ~~win~~ kill a rorqual...lol pathetic
---
CCPLEASE
---
The Leviathan will always be my soft-spot, because as a highsec carebear I kept watching the Clear Skies trilogy and in number 3 the final battle was just awesome movie-making. That fleet had a Leviathan at the core. 
---
Soon my second titan alt is complete (3 months to go without injectors), it will fly a Leviathan :D 
---
Abaddon is also a very close second, just really love the look of the thing when its firing with high graphics. Guns all lined up, shiny and gold. 
---
Third place, I really like the mini-Avatar look of the Legion with the Dissolution Sequencer subsystem fitted. Never got the chance to fly one though. 
---

Hi, I'm a new player and just found this https://i.imgur.com/INEE7q7.png , and decided to search up who he was. Sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. o7
---
In general it's paladin&gt;vargur&gt;golem&gt;solo rattle&gt;solo nightmare&gt;kronos
---
If you have perfect warpins and skills, vargur&gt;paladin but only slightly.
---
Wh effect doesn't change that, except for golem being better in a black hole, but still worse than the vargur or paladin. WR = paladin obviously, but whatever wr's suck.

I sense salt. Lots of salt.

&gt;Think of them like a high school guidance counselor: ultimately worthless but a stage you needed to go through.
---
truest thing ever said about highsec missions
---
and then mouse over the number and it will tell you what the total is.
---
Someone who shows up for 1 fleet every month is better than someone who didn't get accepted, is the mantra for many nullsec groups these days, which makes it a lot more fun I think. Because I don't feel like I have to burn out on random subcap fleets. A lot of alpha-friendliness too, since an alpha can still be very useful.
---
It’s only faster than a dram if you fit no damage mods in the lows, and you do fit damage mods in the lows on the dram
---
The real feels are from the recording of typical op banter on comms shortly before he dropped offline and knowing it’s possibly the last time anyone talked to him. I’ve listened to that snipped a few times. 
---
Man this kind of patch is great. I am being serious when I say that this kind of stuff really helps EVE and makes it feel more polished. Thanks CCP!
---
&gt; I personally pay for my 15 accounts, **and I do enjoy EVE** and I want to continue to multi-box
---
That part seems so strikingly shoved into this statement... perhaps a subconscious cry for help?
---
perhaps :P
---
**Empty High Slot Reeeeee**
---
Even then we had to hit it with torp volleys to actually break the tank.
---
Stockholm Syndrome such is a great moneymaker though, I'm sure it's fine.
---
Yeah, sig tanking is a wonderful thing. Me and a friend can run 6/10s Sansha in two VNIs (like literally a afk vni fit), we’re alphas too. The biggest problem was that we needed to baby drones, but with faction heavies it was doable with a full drone bay. I’ve heard you can do 10/10 with a third person, which sounds like good ISK and a lot of fun.
---
&gt; Most computers cannot handle more the about 5 EVE clients without CPU management software. This is due to the coding of EVE being so poor and taking up so many resources. 
---
Yea. What kind of game developer codes so poorly you can't run 15 concurrent instances of the game on a standard commercial PC right out of the box. Damn noobs.
---
Just make sure you DONT fit a cyno, a prop mod or anything of the sort. Also put all efforts into maximizing DPS. No need for a tank.
---
And when you rat, stay perfectly still until the site is cleared. Less chance of enemies finding you if you aren't moving.
---
When I played FFXI for years, I eventually found a linkshell (like a guild/corp) that had some cool folks in it. Over the next few years we all got really familiar with each other while hunting or competing with other groups. Many of us became friends on Facebook and the two owners of the linkshell were married.
---
Those two with me as a third wheel were unstoppable in whatever goals we set for ourselves. Eventually the two had to take a break for a few months for their first baby. It was an exciting time.
---
It's so strange thinking I met this random couple on the other side of the US and we all became good enough friends. I saw all the posts of their kid fresh from the hospital, then over the years saw the pics of her going through elementary school, then right before we all quit playing she was getting ready for high school. 
---
It's crazy the connections we make playing online games. 
---
My bigger question is are the loot tables gonna be tested first or are they gonna be broken again.

What kind of an abortion is that fit...
---
Welp, someone picked my name already, so I added an e to the a for an ae. I was in the stage of life where you smoke lots of weed and discover some crazy music form the 60s and 70s so that was what I went with. The rest is pretty self explanatory. My indy toon is a reference to  jerkin the gerkin in song form as well. The song about squinting your eyes before you nut. I rolled a toon who is now combat ready.  Because I rolled a lady, I knew it couldn't be burninator, so Burnanatrix was conceived. **THE DRAGON COMES AT NIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!**  My what was to be market toon was an amalgam of some eve lore and some Star Control reference.  Kor Ah and Kor-Azor.  
---
1. You're delusional. Nothing was avoided.
---
2. Defenders already have all of the advantages. I'm asking for one thing.
---
3. So because attackers prepare before they attack that negates local, citadels, supercap umbrella, intel channels and home number's advantage? You want to argue that?
---
4. I'm not alone. I'm in a smaller group. And I'm not sure how defenders can have so many numerous advantages but asking for a little bit of balance is "demanding kills."
---
5. Saying having a spy is an attacker advantage is no different than saying you can have a spy that favors the defender. Espionage does not favor only one side.
---
6. You're so clueless of basic economics. IF less ratting were to happen the value of money goes up. Ships get more expensive, thus making pve more valuable. It balances out. Supply and demand ffs. Use YOUR brain. If having cheap ships would just make pvp better/more common why not make every ship 1 isk? Oh that's right because over abundance makes things meaningless. PvE would not cease if local was limited. Again I listed the advantages of local, citadels, supercap umbrella, rorquals, alliances gates, cyno jammers, all favor defenders. Why are YOU entitled to all of that as a krab?
---
Still you got a kill, its not wasted now
---
We need more people like us! Wormholer btw.
---
I see what you did there
---
I use a tengu mostly for sniping, but sometimes for scanning. Loki is currently overpowered and highly versatile, I use it for hotdropping and we have a pretty mean arty fit for real fights. 
---
I've heard that the legion is good for ganking but I haven't tried it yet. Proteus used to be good at ganking but CCP killed it.
---
sex life, like your comment*
---
when the kwg botmaker quit developing his bot, the price of plex dropped by almost 10% in one month

DDAs, omnis, hyperspatials. Tank is for pussies. Btw, Jove Observatory in ratting system augments fighter damage.

“Dato” means grandfather in Malay (I’m from Malaysia) and is an honorary title given out if you do something great (similar to being knighted and being called sir).

I thought this was too short and so I thought of a last name and I had just recently bought a powerboard from Ikea that was called “Koppla”
---
And so the name was born
---
not featured the friendly fax or the 5 dreads, 2 triage, and 3 carriers BRAVE dropped 
---
Unless you live in a wormhole, nobody uses the Legion. 
---
Proteus is good for running the Guristas 10/10 DED site. Some people use it in PvP, but its drone bandwidth and options are subpar compared to other drone parts and it's one enemy Energy Neut from being a useless junk of parts.
---
The Tengu is mostly used for PvE these days, though some elitists still hold on to it as a strong Tanked Hunter for Blopsing.
---
The Loki is by far the most versatile of the T3Cs and probably the best of the bunch. It can do DED sites, Hunt for Blops drops, makes a Great Logi boat and mainline DPS doctrine ship.
---
The legion is good for it's neuting power in a T3C or if you want to use a 100mn ham/hml fit for small/solo pvp. Loki is used by a lot of groups due to the tank and decent dps you can get out of it. Proteus is still okay for WH stuff to get in peoples face with blasters and surprise them. Tengu is still the king of pve in terms of shield tanking of the 4 and is nice for hunting for black ops gangs due to the massive tank you can get on it. 
---
Lot of ratting hel fits on zkill. 
---
while i really appreciate your positive response, but the op specifically said: "we post without any caps at all" and you capitalized ccp and i so you kinda broke the rules of this post but that's okay because i love you want to see you succeed in everything you do.
---
i see you and me share similar habits of running around naked in our house pretending to be a spaceship.
---
Adromados Galaxia

I think it's kinda obvious where the name came from, but for a hint: I really freakin love space stuff.

Put a hyper instead of a DCU.

Also obligatory nyx is a better ratting ship.

This seems fishy

“Kowalski, analysis.”

Speed/sig/honour tank.   Full deeps/application mods.   Fit a cyno and put a couple cynos of LO in the fleet hangar.   
---
A few points for you to consider.
---
1. You can only use each of them once per account.
---
2. They are regularly offered at 50% discount or even more, green man gaming  seems to often have the better deals.   
---
So wait for the deals, and then YES they are awesome value for any player.

Protip: &gt; means greater than, &lt; means less than.  
---
3. and pvp in enemy territory requires different things as well. You sacrifice tank/fire power for mobility because you have to evade numerous enemies. So that's not an argument. You are not addressing all the home advantages of the krab. "You can do it too" is not an argument either.
---
4. The only inherent advantage I have is probably how unintelligent you are. Your little passive aggressive remarks aren't arguments either. Nobody is asking for things to be easy. I pointed out numerous structural advantages from alliance gates to local to citadel proliferation. You talk so much shit about how good you are but you hide your killboard. You're just another F1 mashing krab. Prove me wrong.
---
5. So because a krab is a krab and "doesn't wish to kill me" this means what exactly?
---
6. What "numbers" do we have actually?
---
And btw: here's the truth of the matter. You're a weak spineless little prick who hides behind numbers and is completely dependent upon game mechanics that cater to little krabs like you. The worst thing CCP has done is make people like you think you have some reason to be proud of. That you can hide behind your numbers and spend endless hours krabbing. As if you actually did anything. You're a drone. An interchangeable cog in a soulless machine to be used by people who give less of a shit about you than even I do. You're a semi conscious battery for something way above you but have been drip fed enough koolaid to think you matter.
---
Which half do you belong in?
---
In rust we trust
---
DeadCo can't do anything because as soon as they try they get attacked by Black Legion, NC/PL have to hang on to what little rental empire they have left and goons have sigs deployed to fight PH with TEST.  
---
Fraternity is busy RMTing their next super capital welp to TEST and Triumvirate is hanging on with a low pulse edging in PB against Snuff/INIT/Old School.

How are they selling them? Selling a capital in highsec is illegal.
---
&gt;A capital ship restricted (under normal game mechanics) to 0.4 space or lower may never change ownership under any circumstance, willfully or not, while in high-security space (0.5 security systems and above).
---
This includes, but is not restricted to: Using the EVE market system, using the EVE contract system, using station direct trades, abandoning it in space.

May I recommend [Dreddit](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/corps:dreddit:joining)? It's the primary corp of Test alliance (which I'll agree is a blob alliance) but as a corp we often call for small gang roams.
---
You're not required to join the big-fleet stuff unless it's a CTA or something serious, but even then as long as you're active in PVP (say, for small gangs) it's pretty chill.
---
Right now we're staged to throw few fleets at Fraternity. It's good content.
---
Nah it does make sense :)
---
Aside from some awkward earlier blunders, I can fit my own ships. 
---
But realistically, it doesn't matter. There's doctrines for every comp except small gang, and even then I've seen it on occasion. This absurd notion 'you should know how to fit your super' is stupid. People usually only learn when taught, and so many people have shitfit supers. I've seen drop supers die without a single smartbomb ffs

The point is that this “This guy’s cargo is worth [this many ISKies]” is bullshit.

At the same time I don’t get an insta-self-destruct that denies my attacker a kill mail, because **BOO FUCKING HOO** how are they going to tell how badass they are if people get to decide what to do with their own ship.

Fit A NSA and all Fighter support units II’s in the highs

Rest of the mids use a mix drone navs and tracking modules.

Rest of the lows Drone damage amps and a couple of tracking.

Hyperspacial rigs too.

Also go faction especially on the lows and mids (don’t be poor your in a super)

Well if one group of either Panfam or Winter would deploy , goons and test would blue up each other to outnumber the rest , so why would u even bother to sdeploy if the 2 biggest entities and their coalitions blue up each other as soon as someone does something ( look at the last time like a year ago ? As soon as legacy came into trouble goons showed up to help, same for the night goon deployment in the north , as soon as fights were kinda even test got involved) ..
---
Sure, but that's fitting for a purpose. You say "create a loki fit" and you'll get a billion options with different usages.
---
For doctrines, you tend to wind up one an ideal fit, which becomes what's used. You don't need to know how to fit. You press fit all and you're fine. Having ratting fits known to corp makes sense. Having it as some knowledge you're supposed to acquire is a terrible outlook imo, and leads to preventable losses that could've been fixed with a few modules and a tiny bit of explanation. 
---
Regarding small gang, that's for sure the most diverse time for fits. I'm not saying only one fit is allowed, but for anything generic - fleets, ratting, etc - there should be fits. 
---
But as I said - with the shitfit drop supers, if you don't know how to fit a drop super, there should be information in your supers group or whatever. 
---
so shht
---
Ads, MORE ads, SEND MORE ADS!!!!!!!
---
what the fuck
---
RE: Fleet fits, yep should be consistent for uniformity because the fleet is moving as one to achieve an objective. Wouldn't make sense to mix guns, prop mods, tank, etc.
---
RE: Ratting. Oh boy will you get a diverse range of fits and suggestions on ratting. Trust me, ratting drama is very much real. I've experienced it both in TEST and in Incursions, there's always some nerd that has a super awesome fit that's super maximized, until the next nerd thinks he has something better and so on.
---
That said, yeah a corp "base" fit for ratting in a VNI, Dominix, Carrier (People will even argue about using Nidhoggurs over Thanatoses, and Hels over Nyxes), and Supercarrier is good enough, and then people can/should tweak it for their purpose as they see fit.

Have you heard of UQ9/Hakonen/6RCQ ?

That's so one sided, yes Legacy and The Imperium are bluetral, now do you want to talk about the bluetral of the north ? panfam is friend with GOTG, winter and skill ur volta and that's only the most famous ones, even during x47 armor timer they had 200 more player on the field
---
Or a lot of Mountain Dew.

This is Not a police fleet so don't buy  that skin. Only need to show up, blap stuff and have fun!

Do u really want to compare numbers from goons and test with Panfam and GOTG ? Look at the current fights were Nc and PH field the same numbers as test alone

You should follow your own advice
---
It had to be a name with norse or Swedish background. Naming the character Odin would have been nice and all but way too on the nose. And there were a ton of characters with names from all the obvious deities and warrior kings is just cliché. So I went with Urd one of the three [norns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norns). Urd is where the word wyrd came from so she is someone that is both of good fortune and cutting of life threads. I wanted a character that was born on a space ship and a last name that signified that, Voidborn would have worked but also have been too obvious, so I went with Voiddaughter in line with the patronymic/matronymic names common in the nordic countries.
---
The other two characters on that account are named after the remaining norns, Skuld and Verdandi. Since the norns are almost as old as the gods, and often described as ancient looking, all of the characters have milky white eyes, and Urd being the oldest also has white hair.

Join a null indy corp that will show you the ropes. If you want to stay in high sec, start with the most used ammo type in your region. Learn skills that increase your range of operation so you don't have to be in the system to alter or deliver your jobs too. Add science to the mix, start improving blueprints alongside production. Good luck with it pilot, 07.

lolol , don’t blame others if sour numbers are shit ?

 In that situation of imperium legacy against the north , would be the same situation as China would declare war on Luxemburg and gets help from amaerica and then claims , don’t blame us if u can’t get our numbers of soldiers and tanks .. come on don’t be retarded ..  reinforcement numbers etc are way in advantage of goons and test  .. I mean it’s like what 20k vs 80k? Even if you are on the Goon/Test side u need to see thoses differences ..
---
With this buff to ganking can cargo scans make people go suspect at this point.
---
the last time I saw a proteus being used was a dude cloaky smartbombing the Rancer gate
---
Lowsec gatecamping. Why "roam" to find people to shoot when people come to you to shoot them?
---
Because you don't need to. Space is basically worthless, if you can't protect it properly. Maybe if you have space that is not in range of any kind of possible neutral staging area (=npc-null), you could try to defend it with a little less force. But apart from that, even goons are too scared to expand their reach further, fearing it would weaken their ratting-core.
---
And since you don't actually need it, your potential gain of an offensive war is pretty much zero. Now the obvious reaction to any kind of offensive that we have seen in the last couple of years is to launch an oppressing campaign at the offensive force's homeland, leading to a decline in income and death of oblivious srp-providers ships. A thing the opposing group then gloats about until no end.
---
The obvious solution is to not fight offensive wars if not necessary or justifiable by some narrative-driven goal (which is why we need more real drama in this community). To make the pvp-guys happy, you start optional deployments with a subset of your group and see what happens.
---
Just gonna put this out there, PH deployed north to defend GotG, then deployed again to fight in Branch. All along my few years in PH, there have been small or large deployments, and we've been in the receiving end as well. There are specific advantages and disadvantages in a deployment, regardless of outcome:
---
PROs: 
---
1. People want content.
---
2. Corps want money so they deploy to get it.
---
3. People need friends and friends need help.
---
4. People hate enemies and want to make their life harder.
---
CONs:
---
1. Support and logistics are a bitch away from home.
---
2. Citadel mechanics make FOBs (Forward Operation Bases) very vulnerable when the other guy can deploy caps/supers and you can't match their numbers.
---
3. People (individually) want to make isk (to fund their pvp activities) in a set, protected environment. Deployment is nothing like it.
---
4. Boredom can kill a deployment faster than the Goons' Titanball if the other guy declines to undock.
---
5. You're bound to make some people angry and in our sandbox universe, that might come and bite you in the butt in the future.
---
6. Size differences make targets either not worth the time or too dangerous.
---
This is actually quite genius. It minimizes the relative amount of space occupied by ads far better than any other solution. And we all know proportions are always more important than raw numbers.
---
Cloaky smartbombing Proteii offer very nice gametime in lowsec, going after pods, shuttles and rookie ships. Covops cloak, combat scanner, 3 large or 2 large + 2 medium smartbombs, propmod, and a combination of stabs and inertia mods, along with warpspeed sub, rigs and implants to outwarp pods. Since the t3 patch you can equip a set of EC-300s to shrug off the occassional bomber trying to tackle you until gate guns kill you.

rip.
---
It s a lot this time, Bastion lost a capsuler also this week :/
---
Fly safe everywhere
---
just stop already this shit has no place in video games
---
they kill sacrifice the occasional bot super so they can claim to be anti bot

Hmmmm. Juicy

The TEST people are so dedicated.. nice...

I unfortunately missed this one, but video looks like they had a lot of fun

I think you'll need to make a new account. She needs to generate an invite link on this page: https://www.eveonline.com/recruit
---
You then click on it and it should send you to a page that looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/40zBvAj

Check out my most recent post, TIKLE semi regularly drops black ops Loki's for gud content,
---
If you're in a nullsec bloc alliance there should also be a blops SIG you can join, just ask your alliance leadership
---
There is also public groups like spectre fleet and bombers bar, 
---
any eve player who is opportunistic (any eve player), anyone who doesn't want to be caught on the public website zkillboard without a cyno, implying he's a bot.
---
Get out of your ship and back in. That NPC drone exclusive aggro bug is old.
---
Really nice job splitting up the fleet to tackle the incoming triage, that looked fun as balls
---
if you want content why are you in a mining corp
---
They out numbered to 300 to defend a very important Keepstar, what do you think the numbers would be if it was a southern Keepstar fight near their space?
---
Cyno because maybe he not all time use a bot and any time ratting on this scrap super in real time. About kill the pod idk because i dont care about this shit but... Pod is neutral if you mean this https://zkillboard.com/kill/75038405/ so if he play why he cant kill him? Finally if you really interesting just try convo this guy and ask him, looks like he have some active killboard.
---
One of my favorite things to do is go to a trade hub that has a suicide tornado camping. I flag myself suspect and undock in a max-tank heron. I then tank the shot, dock, and whip out my own nado and 1 shot em with the engagement timer.
---
Weird. I've never had this kind of trouble before. I'll give it a go thanks.
---
The thing about tolerating being call an F1 monkey, etc, is that usually the people saying it are running off in tears crying about how unfair it all is.
---
I find it most tolerable.
---
well 15 afk/semi-afk clients running what mining, or claokycamping or maybe PI, but the last you don't need to do at the same time, mybe your bot-empire is not working anymore on one PC?!?
---
Turtle Dick?
---
apparently it is, since that's how everyone is playing the game
---
This is just the dumbest thing I’ve read on this subreddit today. Congratulations. Just as an example may I remind here that it is well known that the Judge owes his csm siege to only two people with enough accounts to make it happen. Like beyond the dispute wether or not it’s 50 or 1% of the number of accounts why would you ever think that it’s not a big deal to lose 1% of your customers over a dumb patch with no improvement and no proper in-house support for large number of accounts. But sorry ccp is to busy to add new gameplay and balancing the existing one to be able to code a proper launcher in JavaScript, oh wait...
---
Killright was edited into the post after I replied. Yeah, if you can get someone to fall for that then it's profitable.
---
Except for Goonswarm.
---
We don't love them. 
---
He is a good FC that JJ
---
Luckily for everyone CCP has ignored your activism and stain remains unpolluted by lowsec gates
---
Welcome back! one of us, one of us
---
Just like Frat and many more. :(
---
Excellent kill guys and lovely control of the battle space.   JJ is an excellent FC, and I did this for a while with them and this content was really good fun.     
---
this thread is dumb and bait and retardonk
---
Great awesome work
---

That never bothered people on the old launcher for some strange reason.
---
I used to run 12 accounts on a shitty laptop with a burnt graphic card (I discovered it was burnt later lol) making everything taken on the CPU.
---
Quit fucking playing psychologists, people's lives should NOT be in the hands of untrained randoms trying to feel good about themselves by playing doctor on the internet.
---
If someone needs help link them to TRAINED professionals who dedicated years of their life studying not only to protect those in need but also their own mental health when shit goes wrong or gets to be too much.
---
Your good intentions are not good enough, cut the shit.
---
I'll make this short so you don't have to comprehend too much.   
---
1.) which advantage does the defender have that can't be removed by players?  
---
6.) read previous post. 
---
We did that, and I used that screen to make the account which is what is throwing us
---
These folks are legit. They aren't asking for your money.
---
there are at least 5 offensive deployments ongoing currently in eve ..
---
4b or bleeding ear drums.. Ill take the loss.
---
Take two extra slots on your account and train them so they can research bpos for you and that keeps your main toon free for actual manufacturing jobs. 
---
If only they allowed you to do it for the accounts part so you could list them all at once.
---
ō7
---
Fax, dred and i think an eagle
---
Win.
---
To be fair, the only time I've seen Imperium bots killed was when the GMs spawned them to be killed
---
We aren't playing psychologists, we are here to help people by giving them someone to listen to. We don't provide medical advice, we try to help them by communicating with them. If people need proper help we direct them to the proper channels. If we fear someone will hurt or kill themselves then we send it to CCP who contacts the nearby authorities.
---
We are not psychologists and never planned to be. The nearest you can think of us is a suicide prevention line. We are just trying to help people. And we should give them a choice of who to use. 
---
lol, it's more common than you think, and alliance diplos generally deal with PvE drama more than smokey backroom deals...or so I'm told. It's not something i'd voluntarily do.
---
i don't see one ad here
---
I refuse to deal with it, my corp doesn't have it
---
If you are somehow able to drop a super in deep enemy space and it lives, that ones on GOTG. Should have killed it.
---
In that case log in, then go to the neocom menu (top left) -&gt; Inventory -&gt; Redeem Items, and you should be able to get the skillpoints from there
---
wormholers generally dont have that, except from maybe before the concept of bearholes was widely accepted and people kept the chain up (and massed) cause they wanted to krab the C5 static.
---
EVE is not a typical casual game
---
Hah! Get wrecked dirty blobbers...
---
Eve is not a theme park MMO, and they should not try to become one.
---
I'm sorry you got kicked got being a shitheel.
---
Theta and Jay are cunts! News at 11.
---
People watch movies/play other games while doing PvE in eve, that pretty much sums up how "engaging" and "entertaining" it is... literally nothing else to add...
---
lots more groups do ... the Universe has so many small wars that we not hear.
---
next one is RA moving out with their friends, deffo somthing happening there
---
That's a good name for a fax alt.
---
never seen an eve vid like this before tbh. great watch
---
Fit a cheap hull (usually an Atron) only with mwd, afterburners, warp stabilizers, etc, basically all and only what you need to run away from fights, and try to survive as many jumps as possible from nullsec system to nullsec system. My record is 47 in a row, a very, very lucky streak, outrunning nearly 30 different fleets. 
---
ok first i was like when did a rorqual kill get news, but then i saw the coool video, w-o-w!
---
Join voltron, we do it regular basis
---
That bubble at the end missed you by 0.0004 nano seconds. 
---
love you guys too
---
Eject and board your ship again, its a known bug. Or use Caldari Navy Hornet instead of flimsy hobs.
---
Could semi actively use it and have it as a gtfo button just in case.
---
Yo this is the guy who asked why you seperated on discord, I realize after rereading my comments they were a little on the negative side and I'm sorry for that, thanks for explaining the reason though!
---
I used to run simultaneously 12 accounts on a shitty laptop with a burnt graphic card (I discovered it was burnt later lol) making everything taken on the CPU.
---
That looks awesome and super fun. Well done!
---
&gt; The nearest you can think of us is a suicide prevention line. We are just trying to help people. And we should give them a choice of who to use.
---
I'm sorry, as someone who has done crisis intervention for veterans, what you are doing is well intentioned, but harmful.  I know you mean well, but you simply aren't equipped to handle it.  Unless you have properly trained responders, and physician oversight, you won't have the proper procedures to actually make sure that the person gets help, and to make sure you don't make matters worse.  
---
Fuck yeah TIKLE &lt;3
---
Right click capacitor and jump
---
Click on the discord all they do is talk and sometimes offer light advice, no need to be toxic.
---
The rourq pilot was one the first people I met when I started playing eve, glad he's still playing
---
How can you be opposed to people offering to be there and talk with those who need it? Unless this is uh.. another sockpuppet.
---
Yay for net neutrality
---
rorqual baited on a free asteroid
---
Fuckin more of this. Good catch
---
What makes EVE so great to me is exactly this danger and unpredictability, it universe feels alive as long as there is commitment as soon as I undock and I am forced to concentrate on my ship or possibly loose it. 
---
These very risk are what binds me to the screen, makes me forget IRL and truly enjoy the game. This is what I want from it, the hardcore experience, can't get a more real connection to the virtual ship I control.
---
TLDR: OP wants easy, casual access to the PvE content with the biggest payouts.  
---
If you want quick, easy PvE then run with the quick, easy PvE and live with the small payouts.  
---
If you want big payouts, commit and earn them.  
---
It was int he redeem section! Thanks, don't know how I missed that :)
---
And your people are trained by ? Supervised by ? What are your qualifications to deem yourself a valid option that people should go to in their time of need ?
---
You're out of your fucking mind.
---
Read the goddamn thread you just wrote, afk moderation, people resigning left and right over petty disagreements, money embezzlement, appearently a workaholic staff member who can't even handle her own life but is allowed to handle other people's issues ?
---
And you're pretending to be a valid "option" that people should consider in their toughest moments of their lives ?
---
This shit is absolutely appalling.
---
There's nothing, NOTHING guaranteeing the new project, headed by another team of untrained internet wannabe psychologists won't end in the exact same way if not worse.
---
You ARE playing with people's lives, you ARE pretending to be qualified psychologists.m when you say:
---
"We should give people a choice of who to use"
---
This is fucking insanity.
---
You can fit a blob through a wormhole - you can get something like 100 T3Cs through most of them, for example. Most wormhole corps don't have a blob worth of players online, though, and most don't like blobbing.
---
I can't speak personally to the eject/reboard method.  What I do is make sure my ship is in range to be aggro'd and if I have room,  fit like 1 long range laser to hit frigs with.  Ive found that if I keep hostilities coming from my ship specifically,  the drones don't get aggro'd as much.  And ofc there is always the recall to bay &amp; relaunch games… 
---
As I said before, we send the information to CCP who contacts the relevant local authorities. Which they have done before. We have helped multiple people, some consider what we did, by listening, to have saved their lives. 
---
\*piano chord\* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SiylvmFI\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SiylvmFI_8)
---
This was decent. +1
---
Could see the ship models, camera was pretty smooth, voices were clear to understand and some interesting tactics.
---
Oh yeah let's allow and advertise internet retards as a valid option to seek when you're about to blow your fucking head off
---
fuck you and anyone supporting this bullshit
---
To be clear, that's definitely not what I want. I'm merely suggesting that the future of this game may heavily start leaning in that direction, considering who is acquiring CCP, and we may not have a choice in the matter unless we start dictating things now.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is, since it's probably coming down the pipe anyways, maybe we can starting trying to determine the shape it takes now, versus letting it be foisted upon us. 
---
Reykjavik syndrome… 
---
The injector craze with the booster from the login rewards made a lot of older players buy and use skill injectors and subsequently extractors. 
---
Every extractor costs plex, this coupled with the yearly uptrend in the winter leads to these prices. I expect it to come down in the coming months when everything normalizes. However i do expect injectors to stay at a higher pricepoint due to the multiple character training certificates that flooded the market due to sales being bought up. (Up to 1.6b now from 1b)
---
High plex prices such for grinders, but are great for ccp as people will be more willing to just buy a subscription and the value of buying plex is higher.
---
How many others have you led to their deaths ? how many little timmies went home to find daddy hung like christmas decoration ?  
---
Oh wait you have no fucking clue because you have no support system in place to monitor this shit.
---
100% agree, and if Pearl Abyss/CCP truly cared about this unique experience, they'd dump money into promoting this. An MMO that has absolutely no rival, no equal, no competitor. 
---
Hell, gut PVE completely :p
---
No. And this post was too long.
---
It's always a surprise unless you have intel. But in this case the other side is highsec so you don't really care.
---
ITT an OP who has no idea what he's talking about.
---
I've been almost constantly deployed for a year, except for a few refreshes in between cease fires or diplo agreements. You're not paying enough attention OP.
---
&gt;TEST has been the only group in the last several months to deploy offensively 
---
The fact that your ignorant ass is not aware of other deployments does not mean that nobody else is doing that
---
It's so much fun to coordinate with your buddies and if you know what you're doing you can pull some crazy stuff. Nanogang is love, nanogang is life.
---
There is a lot of PvE that is quick to access and complete. Abyssal sites are quick by design. When I was in high sec, I did scanned and ran DEDs if I only had an hour or so to play. Sometimes I would make 10m, sometimes 400m. It depended on my luck on both the sigs and the loot drops. Those are just two examples. 
---
Leave hisec?
---
&gt; Read the goddamn thread you just wrote, afk moderation, people resigning left and right over petty disagreements, money embezzlement, appearently a workaholic staff member who can't even handle her own life but is allowed to handle other people's issues ?
---
You think there is a reason why we spilt. Every moderator who quit at that point has returned in the new team.
---
&gt; And you're pretending to be a valid "option" that people should consider in their toughest moments of their lives ?
---
Yes I do, it's not just about the suicide, it's also giving an ear to do with depression and other mental health issues. People have said that we helped them in the time of their need and consider us to have saved their life. 
---
&gt; There's nothing, NOTHING guaranteeing the new project, headed by another team of untrained internet wannabe psychologists won't end in the exact same way if not worse.
---
No there isn't, except it's the same team, the same moderators. I am looking at a way go get us training like how they do it for suicide lines but that takes time. 
---
I'm sorry, but that simply isn't good enough.  There is a very good reason that most properly planned services use their own chat and call systems.  Aside from privacy, it allows us to contact the appropriate health services without the delay that you'll have between the change in situation and contacting ccp / when ccp alerts the authorities.  
---
What happens when one of your volunteers says something that tips the scales, and the person you were trying to help decides to take their life?  Are you 100% certain that CCP will contact the authorities within minutes of you realizing that?  What if they succeed?  Do you have plans in place for helping the volunteer deal with that?  Because let me tell you, from personal experience, losing someone that came to you hoping that you could help them is NEVER easy, no matter how experienced you are.  
---
Abyssal sites have a hard 20min timer, have varying scales of difficulty and payout, and random NPCs every time to keep it relatively fresh and interesting. I don't think you can get more drop-in/drop-out PvE than that. 
---
Absolutely true. Abyssals are definitely more along the lines of what I think the more "casual" player is going to gravitate towards.
---
#ShedonCooperMoment
---
Is monocle ownership used ironically or have people forgotten the riots?
---
Ok, great. Shut it down and stop getting people killed until you get proper training.
---
Yup, pretty much spot on. Do you think there is room to improve on that though? 
---
Is that the end all be all of what we should expect PVE in EVE to be?
---
Keep your rorq aligned out.  Cook up a fax alt.  Use your dank ISK to Plex 2-3 other alts to have eyes in surrounding systems to spot your impending doom.  Buy some reasonably cheap monitors for those accounts so you never have to alt-tab.  After losing your first rorq within the month, go back to afk crabbing in a VNI in a pocket system while crying in your pillow at night.
---
:(
---
The biggest problem eve has with pve isn't that it requires to much commitment, but that it requires to little commitment. Most people do pve semi afk, because it requires you to be brain dead for it to be enjoyable. Its just to much mindless grinding. Which also causes the problem you are talking about, difficulty is to often just lazily scaled by the amount you have to grind.
---
Abyssal deadspace has proven that pve in eve can be made at least somewhat engaging and is exactly the drop in/out system you are searching.
---
Thank you for the work you do, and thank you for explaining shit calmly because i'm fucking fuming right now.
---
I'm absolutely perplexed how this is allowed and supported by people on this sub, i guess people working the mental health field get training for shits and giggles.
---
I'm thinking of making  freighter/industry alt, what skills should i be looking at and any rough time frame to have a freighter and be making ship/t2 modules/ what ever?
---
I'm the same way. First time I recorded anything I was like "jesus, how do I stand myself"
---
I’ve been around. Tenal, Venal, Cloud Ring, Querious, Fountain, Providence, Insmother, Delve [well, 2 days :-)].
---
It’s not a lack of experience.
---
It’s life in EVE. Ebbs and flows. 
---
That'll certainly keep you occupied for a while!
---
&gt; Ayyy, first time posting anything serious so give me some love (hate).
---
Everyone has weak moments, but remember that cool guys don't post idea topics.
---
Easy, because they are untrained and walking through a minefield.  
---
JFC The fight doesnt start till 12 mins in.
---
Just to add on a bit:
---
I'm definitely not attempting to promote a "PVE first" mentality, or anything along those lines.
---
EVE is a PVP game, through and through. However, much of our beloved pewpew is locked behind the inevitable ISK grind that some poor sap has to go through, whether that's some rando or you yourself. Unless you're paying those bookoo PLEX bucks that is. Ergo, PVE becomes a necessary aspect of the game if you don't want to spend real monies. 
---
So, since the ISK must flow, I'm not so sure what we really have any option other than simplifying the mechanics for newbro/baseline PVE, and allowing for more drop in/out styles of gameplay that cater to that sort of player.
---
What's the alternative? Fully embrace the F2P model? Accept the possibility that whales and P2W mechanics are going to be the future?
---
I'd much rather figure out a way to generate a consistent revenue stream that via new player subs that allows us to keep P2W mechanics out of the game.
---
this is why you leave goons once you built up enough isk to afford shiny toys :)
---
Why does it have to be 24/7 botting? Surely they could actively use the account and leave it running scripts when they're at work/school/whatever? 
---
Or maybe I'm retarded and that's not how it works at all idk
---
Could you show me a time where what we did got someone killed? 
---
No one is watching TV or youtube while in the abys.
---
Doing exploration all over the cluster and blowing up anything along the way my trusty Astero can take down.
---
Well shit, looks like I gotta spin up a new handle &gt;_&lt;
---
I could whinge on about a gate to Stain I s'pose :p
---
&gt; How many others have you led to their deaths ? how many little timmies went home to find daddy hung like christmas decoration ? 
---
Why would that happen, the people who come to talk about suicide gets reported to CCP immediately, most come to talk about other mental health such as anxiety. We have always said that people should go to a professional help services, but we are still here to listen to them. 
---
That's not true at all, although I have not spoken to these lot there is a large discord server that is very similar and they are amazing people.
---
It really can help when your down to have someone to just let you vent 
---
&gt; We do not dispense medical advice in the channels. We encourage people to talk with their primary care provider, and provide references for state or government sponsored programs and phone numbers.
---
Taken from our discord rules. We try to support people as lost people aren't dealing with suicide, but we do encourage them to seen professional help. If they come to us over a mental health service, maybe it's because they want to speak to  the service. I can't say what will happen if that does happen, but we will try to convince them to find a professional service if its that bad
---
pveing on 10 accounts while watching netflix is viable in exactly 0 other mmos
---
Its hearts and prayers syndrome.  People want to help and feel like they are helping without doing any of the work.  When you confront them on it, they get offended and try to rationalize their behavior, often refusing to see that it is harmful behavior.  The problem here is, people tend not to realize that certain behaviors can cause harm until they actually do, which in this case is someone dying.
---
goons have a rule in busy mining systems to mine the shitty ore first, so it doesn't get left behind preventing the anom from respawning. if you break it repeatedly, your rorq gets awoxed by the goon higher-up circlejerk.
---
people still get around it by sitting at a ping 200k off the rocks, waiting for other people to finish mining the ochre, so they get first dibs on the good ore, which results in some hilarious drama.
---
Come to wormholes, where people fight.
---
Answers the question and makes sense to me. Imagine the butthurt it took to downvote this. haha
---
idiocracy 
---
&gt; Why would that happen, the people who come to talk about suicide gets reported to CCP immediately
---
And CCP's response time?  I assure you it isn't within 3 minutes of receiving the report that they contact the relevant authorities.  
---
SSSHHHH, next thing they're find out about my dank 260m ticks 
---
It's a QOL change. It makes ganking a bit less annoying if you're casual about it, but this in no way makes ganking stronger, reduces TTK etc.
---
My favorite thing to scout around highsec until I find an expensive looking Hulk or Mackinaw, then gank his AFK ass and loot his wreck. In 0.5 or 0.6 I use cheap Coercers. In higher sec I can use Catalysts. If he's in a deadspace site I can bring in Tornadoes to blap him from range. For added excitement, I don't fitscan the thing. 9 times out of 10 he'll have no tank to speak of and die in a well deserved fire, but occasionally he'll survive and moonwalk out. Love it when they drop ORE strip miners, faction laser upgrades, or blingy mining drones.
---
Can you show me chains of care for everyone who you've passed on to CCP?  Response times for CCP getting in contact with the relevant authorities?  Hell, the number of people you've referred to CCP for suicidal ideation vs how many times CCP has actually contacted the authorities?  
---
Fitted for exploration and packing a punch? Got drones or some additional firepower?
---
'Cause that does sound alluring 😁
---
Step 1) Be likeable. Step 2) don't be in a blob unless you are high ranking step 3) actively engage with said people on a deep level transcending the boundaries of the game 
---
It is a buff still isn't it?   Even if you had ways to do it before which took more effort and relied on a TP site.
---
It's an imprecise convenience for the lazy. Serious buffers will still use evepraisal. I see this as much like the in game fitting simulator.
---
&gt; Can you show me chains of care for everyone who you've passed on to CCP?
---
No we no longer have access to that information as it was stored on the old server. 
---
&gt; Response times for CCP getting in contact with the relevant authorities?
---
I've never had to report anything but I'll talk to the moderators who have and get back to you. 
---
&gt; number of people you've referred to CCP for suicidal ideation vs how many times CCP has actually contacted the authorities?
---
That information is confidential and we will not be sharing that at any time. 
---
They serve as the "guaranteed isk" of the triglav sites, so long as you can get them safely to market. NPCs buy them at 100k in endless amounts, so unlike triglav modules/ships/ammo, they won't fluctuate in price.
---
amen brother
---
I'm not sure, I never had to report it to CCP before. But I will talk to the moderators that and get back to you. 
---
It is a direct buff to ganking still.    I think you meant serious gankers not serious buffers?
---
Because it's difficult to organise, risky, and most of all, defender advantage is real. Most groups see no advantage and many downsides. The majority of groups in Eve, whether they will admit.it or not, are fundamentally defence organisations, and their culture is about protecting what they have.
---
One of my indy characters is called Eddie Starbart, after the haulage firm in the UK Eddie Stobart. Really surprised it was still available.
---
This is literally exactly what Abyssal filaments were added for. Go check them out.
---
Still pushing that dotlan numbers narrative, as if it gives some kind of DPS multiplier for the actual ships on grid.
---
A more charitable explanation would be that Goons already learned the hard way what comes of holding onto too much territory in Fozziesov.
---
Fighting outnumbered in highly mobile doctrines \^\^
---
There will always be those people who believe the developers can do no wrong. 
---
Blame Fozziesov. As soon as an entity deploys all the sov and structures are left vulnerable to attacks by minor shitlers. Not many entities are large and sophisticated enough to handle split deployments.
---
Init likes to post this kind of stuff in forums, but we keep things relaxed in actual comms and try not to take ourselves too seriously, even at the high FC level.
---
This.
---
It's a shame really. What always drew me to eve (and Shadowbane, and EverQuest PvP in the early days, etc) was that the pvp was "meaningful." It wasn't just a 5-25 minute skirmish for points and bragging rights like with mobas and battlegrounds and FPSs. Losing hurts, you're fighting for some objective too (control of a rare camp, the life of your city, etc), you don't have to try to drum up trouble to get people interested, etc.
---
It's all well and good to enjoy PvP in and of itself. But if all I want to do is that, I can do it in other games that don't have a bunch of overhead/logistics/hunting required in order to make PvP happen. Without the extra reason(s) to PvP, Eve isn't really worth it imo.
---
If officer modules f.ex. could ONLY be bought via the NES, aka only real cash, no plex, yes that would be pay to win imo.
---
But that isnt the case so whatever.
---
I bet 10bil the next time goons will move north to rekt PH GOTG will come for important timer, quit pretending this is not a friendly skirmish to pretend the north is not just krabs, I remember back in WWB PL was hunting GOTG super/Carrier while GOTG had fleets out to defend PL assets, it was one of the reason I quit GOTG at that time
---
In the north maybe but in south we had thing like Hakonen, 6RCQ and all that cool stuff, karmafleet is recruiting if you want :)
---
Good point. Thanks for the tips!
---
thats some very nice fleet management and a perfect moonwalk, well done 
---
I guess we will never know, since The Imperium and Legacy are the only pvp coalition who dare deploy out of their space 
---
imo even we don't deploy enough. But I understand, deployments require a lot of time invested by a small core of hunters, scouts, cynos, super pilots and FCs. Full deployments can often turn into blueballs, content denial and structure bashed. I get why people get burned out and want to sit for months after one. I'd be quite content if most groups just sent out SIGs or equivalent groups constantly, which to some extent, some groups do, but for the most part, right now people seem to be slumbering.
---
My dig on this: If you want an increase in offensive deployments by groups large or small, be the change you want to see. Learn to gather intel, hunt, train up cloakies and cynos. Take the initiative and start camping your chosen target, within your org's rules. Start feeding info you find to your FCs. They only deploy when they see a juicy target, so go find them one. I'm in the process of training up to do this.
---
Thank you for this report 
---
Companies that dont design their games to nearly require multiboxing? Companies whose games are interesting enough with 1 account that very few feet any desire to box?
---
I am in and out of the game couple times. I am alpha, as I still don’t see why I would upgrade to omega.
---
I don’t have much time to play, and usually it’s short sessions of 1h or 2h at max.
---
I started thinking mining would be cool, spent time training for that. Turns out mining sucks. I literally played other games while my venture were shooting lasers at a rock in another screen.
---
Then I tried industry. That looks like browser mmo where you click some buttons and wait days to get something. So not very engaging.
---
Then tried ratting, pretty boring and I am unable to quite get to higher level combat sites (yeah I suck).
---
Then I decided to see PvP as this is what EVE brags about. I wandered null sec for hours and hours and found like 2 or 3 other ships which wiped me in a few seconds.
---
So far I am only coming back to the game because I am still curious to see if I will ever feel what those veterans feel about the game.
---
I would hesitate to say that. Even in a massive group, maybe 20 people are in the core group that actually takes the time to hunt and feed intel that is then used for deployment. The issue isn't that it's too hard to farm content, the issue is that too few people are willing to put in the time and effort to be the first hunters. If you need proof of this, go join a blops fleet and watch the FC beg anyone to go hunt for them. I've been in a fleet where we sat and waited for 3 hours on a redeemer because only 1 person volunteered to hunt.
---
What exactly am I looking at?
---
honestly PH hasn't had to deploy to get content, as it has so much come to it as is.
---
if we do need to deploy away from Gemi though, we got Partisans. though so far we haven't had the need to go to far from Geminate due to Goons and Test coming to us.
---
For botting, i bet it is, for living there not as much
---
last i checked Panfam isn't friends with GOTG.
---
NC and PL are neutral with them. and PH is still hostile to GOTG.
---
and i doubt PH is going to just go "oh lets blue up" any time soon.
---
52 Rorquals mining a collosal and all their movements are syncronized
---
T4s in a 600m Gila aren't challenging.
---
&gt; I had imagined mining as the pinacle of 1337 gameplay 
---
I would like to disagree, but now we have Rorqs...
---
&gt; allow you to drop in and out of combat at a whim, without any significant reprucussion 
---
WHAT?!?!? Ever heard of ganking, dropping, baiting, trapping? All ESSENTIAL parts of EVE as we know and love it. 
---
&gt; a more on-demand PVE experience 
---
It's called DEDs and abyssal sites. You had it in the past, the new iteration is even faster and potentially even more lucrative .
---
&gt;  simplifying the mechanics for newbro/baseline PVE 
---
Dude, it can't get simpler than AFK VNI or AFK mining. Both doable with alpha.
---
To sum up: You don't like risk, you don't know current PVE mechanics, you don't appreciate PVP mechanics. You wave around words like P2W to provoke feelings, you compare sandbox to theme park and finally you accuse CCP and PA for what they MIGHT be planning in the future, when they have NOT declared any plans or intentions yet. You're either a troll or a carebear that wants to get even more goodies even faster and safer.

---
The stuff they show in the Blizzard launcher is completely useless though, unlike the eve launcher which shows the patch notes for a bug fix update twice, an ad for omega accounts (which I, and most other players already have) and an ad for 2 skins.
---
Blizzard launcher, for Overwatch at least, shows a video showcasing a new map, shows the current event, shows some merch and lets you know about the price drop.
---
Show us some merch, let us know clearly about upcoming events, showcase one of the 3 streamers that actually play this game. Anything but telling omega players to upgrade to omega and letting us know twice that you have in fact fixed a bug.
---
I feel like we just went over this, they are the only ones with a large enough number advantage to be able to do so.
---
They are better in a stratios because you can field more
---
Nothing to see here move on
---
All I see is a jittery gif showing nothing.
---
Proteus has a very good tank imo... I lost one to a 20man retribution gang... Took them 7 minutes to kill me. Had some killmarks by the time i finally ran out of nanite paste. 
---
With out a time reference it hard to tell. Could be tabing through and quick command drone launch with hot keys.
---
Spin it more, they did it every time we deploy to the north, GOTG and Panfam relationship is the same as Imperium and Legacy, best buddy if our enemy show up, free content once they are gone.
---
50+ Rorquals launching their drones at the same time ? 
---
weird, last time I checked sigs and squad only had 100 max member in fleet, but yeah I'm sure you need thousand of people to disrupt an area (when are shit)
---
-- check the coalition -- 
---
Yep it's goons, its input broadcasting or botting grrr goons
---
Source?
---
eve-o preview make it so easy to do that kind of stuff. I enjoy spamming my corp chat by doing it to pretend we are not dead :D
---
No, the pilots just have really fast and synced up key presses 
---
Ok let me redo the post with proper footage.
---
&gt; at the same time 
---
They're not though? It's not the best gif but you can see on the right group they're coming out in stages. A good window setup and quick clicking + hotkeys or eveo preview + hotkeys etc it's pretty easy to switch between clients and launch drones
---
Muninns are boring... Can we get a new meta CCPlease? 
---
drone deployment over 5 ticks?
---
no you're retarded
---
I'm not seeing all the drones on the same tick. Look at the bottom group, and the right most group. They have multiple ticks between drone groups laucnhing.
---
""""sig deployments""""
---
Have you thought of the reprocussions that type of gameplay will have on the eve community? eve is about forcing interactions with other players or make alts. That gameplay will remove all risk and remove the need to interact. If you do that you might as well lose the single shard universe. Sorry I personally don't want that as that what keeps me returning to this game. 
---
&gt;The issue isn't that it's too hard to farm content, the issue is that too few people are willing to put in the time and effort to [farm content].
---
this is literally what 'too hard' means
---
New Eve new bugs
---
hardly,  first off the Legacy imperium relationship is Imperium the master, Legacy the pet who needs the master to do anything without being beat.
---
the Panfam GOTG relationship right now (and how its been since the cease fire) has been strained relations, refusal to talk, and outright fighting between some members.
---
to all purposes GOTG is technically dead, only alive due to time zone and citadel mechanics.
---
"best buddy if our enemy show up"  must be why they were there all those times test and imperium moved on gemi,  or attacked the NC deploying keepstar.
---
oh...wait.  they were hostile in those instances, actually trying to intercept and kill reinforcements coming to NC's side.
---
so whose spinning it?
---
Yeah this has started happening almost every time I play, sometimes I relog, sometimes i just go have a smoke and play a more stable game.
---
they are well wishing people  
---
but I 100% see your point and agree

Ah now, we both know that ain't what your reply originally said. Slipping in those ninja edits is just sloppy coding!
---
It’s extremely unhealthy if a relatively small number of alliances are the only ones generating any form of conflict 
---
Everyone knows the Atron is way better for buttplay. 
---
Obviously, close local chat also.  You want as much screen real estate to max those ticks.  If you land at 0 and don't align anywhere, your fighters will get to the rays and back quicker too!
---
Do you think that’s a good thing?
---
right, when has talking to people ever helped a depressed or suicidal person...
---
I would agree we are part of the issue but we recently got deployed upon which was what started my thinking on this.
---
To be clear, here's what we're talking about (Otou).  
---
https://i.imgur.com/t3ZvblW.png
---
I had mind blanked and forgot scourge or skillu.
---
Regardless both of those aren’t necessarily large bloc alliances under a larger bloc leader which was mostly what I was thinking about
---
That’s not very many when you consider the number of alliances 
---
Dude. I'm untrained. But if my bro ever needed someone to talk to, I'd be there. 
---
Gotta respect that level of commitment, Cotton.
---
No.
---
Since I was mentioned in the post, I figure I should give some background on where I am coming from.  
---
I helped found a military crisis support line while I was active duty.  While I am no longer associated with them, I am a certified Crisis Worker, QPR Gatekeeper, and was a Master Resiliency Trainer while active duty.  I was also the designated mental health responder for a unit of 1500 people, and in addition to that, I have been in emergency medicine for over a decade.  
---
B4R does not have the training, oversight, or organization to be providing this service.  While well intentioned, they will cause more harm by delaying care from a proper mental healthcare provider, and through lack of training may directly lead to someone committing suicide.  Mental health is a veritable mine field, and one wrong statement could end in disaster, no matter how well meaning someone is.  And disaster is an eventuality, not a possibility.  An organization that deals with any mental health crisis must be prepared for it, and have the structure and procedures in place to handle it, for both the person in need, and the volunteer.
---
CCP is a game company first and foremost.  They do not have the staffing or resources to ensure that every case is properly and promptly referred to emergency services.  They should not be the go to for any group to refer possibly suicidal person to.  
---
I strongly urge everyone involved in B4R to suspend the project, and get the proper training, infrastructure, and staffing required.  While the project has immense potential, in its current form, it will do nothing but cause harm.
---
well sigs deployment it's different they were the PB, germinate and curse campaign and I might miss a lot, meanwhile PH in 3 years =&gt; "We deploy T1 frigate for 3 days in delve guys !!"
---
Am I missing something? (Honest question) 
---
I like the new launcher, I don’t have to close it every time I load an account with ISBoxer now. It makes loading in at least 3 times faster.
---
Freighter is around 40 days until you can sit in one, maybe aim for racial industrial V and transport ships so you can use a DST? About 25~ days and a lot safer and cheaper than freighters once flown properly. An orca is also a viable hauler option, 80k general hold but lot's of specialized holds if you're hauling for your self.
---
Well he is slightly better than Mekwell 
---
Hi random goon thats a troll dont be bitch go jump see what you fuck up. ;) 
---
I like you heres a upvote.
---
Friends and family are VASTLY different than an internet stranger saying they are here to help.  You are not only in a position to get emergency services to the person in need quickly, but you are someone they are familiar with and trust.  B4R volunteers don't have those advantages, which without proper training can lead to disaster.  
---
Another battle royale is exactly what the world needs..... just no!
---
you seem to be confusing "they" with "the game"
---
sure it might be unhealthy for the game - but it isn't unhealthy for them. that's why the situation we're in now exists. the status quo is created by the players for the players given the rules of the game.
---
if those rules aren't creating a status quo in favour of the game because the definition of healthy for a player group vs the sandbox isn't the same - then that needs addressing at the fundamental levels of what those rules are rather than pretending people should act against their own interest for some 'greater good'.

if you have mental health issues, i do have sympathy for you and there are many subreddits full of people offering support - this isn't or shouldn't be one of them.
---
we come here to talk eve, not 'woe is me'.

i don't give a shit how heartless this comes off as - there's a time and a place for everything and this definitely isn't the place for posts about people's mental health issues/concerns.

&gt; right, when has talking to people ever helped a depressed or suicidal person...
---
There is far more needed than just talking.  The consistent thing that ASTOUNDS me in both threads is the fact that people fail to realize that "just talking" can cause a world of harm.  All it takes is one wrong thing to be said, no matter how innocuous it may seem,  that helps the person seeking help make the decision to end their life.  There are very specific ways to guide the conversation and to phrase what you say to have the best chance for a positive outcome, and volunteers NEED to be trained on them.
---
except PH is part of the Panfam coalition.
---
Test is part of Legacy, not Imperium.    which is why we mock them.   if they were part of Imperium, all of a sudden thats no longer a master/pet.  thats just a coalition.
---
&gt; WHAT?!?!? Ever heard of ganking, dropping, baiting, trapping? All ESSENTIAL parts of EVE as we know and love it.
---
That's not PVE, which this post was originally intending to address.
---
&gt; It's called DEDs and abyssal sites. You had it in the past, the new iteration is even faster and potentially even more lucrative .
---
I concede that i had forgotten abyssals were a thing. DED's though, require significantly more of a time/isk investment to be considered viable for a newbro
---
&gt; Dude, it can't get simpler than AFK VNI or AFK mining. Both doable with alpha.
---
Again, NEWBRO. Someone who IS NOT up and joining a corp/alliance from the getgo, and to be honest, shouldnt be pressured into doing so. Joining a corp/alliance should feel like an organic experience, not something you need to do in order to enjoy the game or make isk.
---
&gt; To sum up: You don't like risk, you don't know current PVE mechanics, you don't appreciate PVP mechanics. You wave around words like P2W to provoke feelings, you compare sandbox to theme park and finally you accuse CCP and PA for what they MIGHT be planning in the future, when they have NOT declared any plans or intentions yet. You're either a troll or a carebear that wants to get even more goodies even faster and safer.
---
This is complete conjecture, as you have no idea who I am, what I've done in-game, how I like to play, etc. As I've stated multiple times, I don't WANT the game to turn out this way, just pointing out the reality of the situation. YOU might have high hopes for PA, a company thats clearly demonstrated that they don't give a fuck about your pewpew, and is in it for the $$$$, and that definitely doesn't change the reality that more P2W and F2P mechanics are coming down the pipeline. You can already see it with this new launcher iteration. 
---
This has nothing to do with playing on heartstrings, or whatever else to want to ascribe my thought process to. My post is entirely based on looking at the reality of the situation, from my perspective, and I don't see anything good coming down the pipeline unless we as a community take pre-emptive action and begin discussing these issues in ernest, before shit hits the fan.
---
You're more than welcome to your own opinion, but keep in mind that you don't live in a bubble. Market forces are driving a push towards the direction I was suggesting. Whether they be from the asian continent, or elsewhere, clearly more developers and publishers are pushing for a similar model. 
---
My post, suggestion, and commentary on the matter, is simply intended to spark a discussion that will inevitably happen at some point in the future. The sooner we get in front of it, the better imo.
---
While I agree, I just would like to point out you went about it like a total fucking edgelord, so don't pretend to care when you're being a fucking cunt.  You made your point. 
---
B4R is separate to /r/eve, this post and the sticky are the first time I've ever really seen mental health being discussed in this subreddit. B4R was created specifically for EVE players and a large subset of EVE players are subscribed to r/eve.
---
I agree with your point but I don't think many people are posting here expecting mental health support - I mean why would you?
---
B4R is one avenue of support among many, nobody is forced to go there, nobody there discourages people from seeking other forms of support - it's for people who ***want*** to talk somebody in EVE about their RL problems, pretty sure all of them being very aware that suicide hotlines exist and are probably better staffed. Nobody there is "in charge of people's lives" (hint: you're the only person in charge of your own life and what you do with it) and saying that a well-meaning person can be blamed for "getting someone killed" might be the most retarded thing I've ever read on this subreddit.
---
this is coming from someone who has reached out to b4r for help in the past, somehow I'm still here :)
---
also guess what? you don't need to be a trained psychologist or "spend years of your life studying mental health" to volunteer for a suicide hotline. the only requirement for Samaritans in the UK is that you have to be good at talking to people. maybe you should complain about how they're staffed by "armchair psychologists" and it's only a matter of time before they get somebody killed (and yes, people have done that too)
---
so you think a suicidal person should just end it instead of maybe opening up to a stranger because they may feel uncomfortable going to a professional or talking with their family about it? 'Cause I can tell you it took me months to seek out professional help and another few months to tell my family that my psychotherapist said that I have depressions and my therapist told me that it is not uncommon.
---
Sounds like typical ns shit/titan pilot drama.  Join WH space. 
---
Eh, I wouldn't really say "defense organizations" so much as I'd say "petrified of embarrassing loss." Many of the elite organizations of yesteryear spent years, going on a decade, of exposing the absolute minimum surface area to attack. Their primary objective is to *limit loss.* Now, granted, defense does this very well, but it's important to recognize the actual motivation.
---
Then be even more specific.
---
Why not just reduce the number of blues you have to create more targets of opportunity?
---
Fit a damage control and a stiff shield tank. Do your hauling on a neutral pilot that is not in FW or otherwise wardecced. Rule of thumb is that you're not worth ganking (for profit) until your cargo exceeds 100m.

Pay someone else peanuts to move your stuff, especially if you are in high sec. At least use them to move stuff a few jumps away from or the final leg into a market hub. 
---
While I can't speak to your particular experience, I can imagine that many other new comers feel the exact same way as you.
---
I'm not going contribute the cliche of recommending a certain alliance/corp to join. There are plenty of newbro friendly NPSI fleets you can join in on that run content on a fairly consistent schedule if you'd like to try PVP but don't want to lock yourself in. Spectre Fleet and Bomber's Bar come to mind.
---
Yeah, no. That's not how masters and pets work. The label doesn't go away because they formally align with each other. Phorde is a pet. They will never be anything other than a pet.
---
Regions are already delineated this way by their geography. There's a reason we've developed Delve so highly, and not Querious or Period Basis. Delve has superior qualities for our needs.
---
&gt; Even if there are very few actual interventions there is no harm in the channels existing. As any suicide intervention trainer will tell you - speaking about one's problems or even suicide itself never leads to someone acting on it simply because of the conversation. Usually the opposite happens.
---
While mostly true, as a responder, you should also know that you have to guide the conversation in a specific way.  In addition, depending on the mental state of the person in question, someone untrained may escalate the situation inadvertently.  There are reasons why the questions about their intentions and problems are carefully framed, and that is to avoid escalation. 
---
&gt;B4R provides a place for people to speak, to open up to someone who will actually understand them as another gamer, not some faceless operator on the other side of a help-line, nor a professioanl who gets pait to listen and speak according to guidelines.
---
By virtue of offering themselves as a place to talk and get help / advice, they are taking on the responsibility of being able to respond appropriately.  Yes, having gamers helping gamers as a demographic is a great idea, but having them properly trained is a necessity.  
---
&gt;There is no psychological help provided, and usually no actual suicide interventions. Mainly it is the first stop for people in troubles. If they need further help they can seek it with encouragement from someone in B4R channels.
---
Strongly disagree here.  By virtue of offering themselves as a place to talk, they are providing psychological help, if untrained.  As a first stop, they should still have proper procedures and policies in place, if not just to help those they are supposed to be helping, but to help themselves in the long run.
---
Stop posting this garbage. 
---
heh, keep saying that.
---
and we not a pet. more a child.  but we growing, and even taking some groups from our parent PL.   eventually we'll be the stronger entity.
---
while test, is fading more and more into obscurity with their inability to do anything without goon support.
---
Yeah i mean why there is even suicidal/depressed people when they can just "contact professionals"? ^^is ^^/s ^^even ^^necessary
---
I think not talking is bigger bad, there shouldn't be any problem with having a place to talk and REDIRECT people to relevant places. And if someone offs themselves like you said, they weren't going to contact relevant authorities anyways. But that just may be how you work in the good ol' US of A where you tell people just to "contact professionals"
---
0
---
Some people may not understand this but one of the hardest things for someone with mental health issues is to openly talk about it for the first time.
---
If some people use B4R as a first stepping stone please dont belittle it. It may have taken alot to even go there. 
---
See, Eve is still like that. The problem is that the loss isn't packaged into neat little units for people with small minds to digest. When you roll someone out of a region, before we even count ships lost in PVP actions, they're out trillions of ISK in infrastructure, manyears of logistics work, and whatever social capital they've lost among their kind (a thing that expresses itself in burnout and member loss.) There aren't other kinds of games like that in existence. If there were, I'd be playing them and not Eve.
---
Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night. Pet.
---
Stop reading it if you dont like it 
---
i don't think it's fair to try to completely tear down B4R and the people who are involved with it. From what I understand B4R is just a way for EVE players to talk to other EVE players about mental health and be listened to. Any reasonable person wouldn't expect to cure someone of their mental health issues or prevent someone from hurting themselves through an in-game chat channel, I would expect most people involved with B4R do not see themselves as substitutes for psychiatrists.

*chews on bat country as we continue absorbing more and more members/corps*
---
enjoy Test as a pet while you can, a failure cascade is in store for that group unless they find a way to stand on their own without goons propping them up
---
Your point? We know this already
---
Neat. I was the dictor that missed you guys by like a microsecond. I was mad. 
---
I can't, it's literally all over this sub and it's ridicules. I run multiple accounts without issue, isboxer is not CCPs responsibility to make compatible or work. Talk to the dev of isboxer and bitch at him for launcher problems. The fact CCP did a GOOD job with this launcher just pisses me off that you faggots keep posting about how it can be "improved" apply for ccp if you want to make a difference.
---
You're going to count *Bat Country* as a win? Bat Country is the rejects that followed one of our bitter ex direkkktors out the door in 2016, and they bled half their numbers in the process. They're currently led by the only remaining person in the corporation that has bothered to undock in the last year, and I'm not even sure that's accurate.
---
Who said the launcher was bad. Ah so you didin't read it. All good.   
---
KEY WORD "be improved"
---
Not at all.  The misconception here is that wanting B4R to be run properly means that I want it to be staffed by cold clinicians that people can't relate to.  The organization I helped found was initially much like B4R, veterans talking to and helping other veterans.  The problem came when we lost some, and had to take a cold, hard look at ourselves as an organization and we came to the realization that the potential for harm was there.  B4R is still in that place where they can tell themselves that they are doing good, and overlook any potential harm they are causing.  All I am trying to do is help them realize they need to make the proper transition BEFORE they have an event that forces it.
---
I'm a cunt that cares.
---
also, people have lost passion for hating each other.
---
stop posting
---
Usually when I am FCing I run a 4-6 scout characters 2 titans 2 supers and fax and dread pilots. So they are not “semi-afk” clients. 
---
stop whining
---
nah, people hate people just as much as before but it's so much more annoying to do things since
---
1) things are worth less to kill
---
2) it takes so much more effort to kill said same things that are worth even less now
---
and 
---
3) the whole 'the few' versus 'the many' dynamic is dead
---
l m a o
---
I feel like it's possible that you're ignoring the fact that many of the individuals who reach out to B4R DO NOT WANT to reach out to a more professional/organized entity. 
---
There is definitely an aspect of stigma, and/or fear attached to reaching out to more professional/organized entities, regardless of their training or experience on the matter.
---
It's sad to say, but if someone is set on that particular course of action, there is probably little you can do to dissuade them. The very fact that they are reaching out strikes me as a last resort, and who would you rather talk to when you've reached the end of the line? A professional, or a friend? 
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t there something in the ts &amp; cs about the max number of accounts you can run simultaneously?
---
(Just confirming my existing knowledge, not having a jab at you)
---
Yeah you are only allowed to run 5 and 3/4 clients. 
---
&gt; B4R is separate to /r/eve,
---
not when it first started, it wasn't. it literally ended up spamming the front page with everyone and their dog posting their woe is me stories.
---
you think the current repetitive meme bullshit that clogs the front page is worse? b4r was worse.
---

Of course this is a problem with launching clients with ISBOXER not screen real estate or anything like that.

You can but you only need to run it once. It manages CPU and windows.

You don't have to be trained to offer immediate help. Sometimes all others need is someone they can talk to, someone who is willing to listen everything they have to say. B4R absolutely encourages those who reach them to contact professionals, they provide suicide hotlines right on their website! But even to get you in touch with such professionals, you need some help and encouragement. The B4R acts as that bridge, it's like a catalyst and the first stepping stone in this case since it is linked to the community so many would find it easier to approach it rather than people they don't know on hotline or cannot affiliate with or relate with.
---
No, I am not ignoring that fact.  As I said in another post, I'm not saying that B4R should be staffed by cold unrelatable clinicians or professional crisis responders, but that the volunteers should at least have a base level of training so they are able to actually help.  One of the best courses I took wasn't a year long professional certification, or a degree program, it was a 1 week long course.  Since it was aimed at healthcare professionals, there were of course things that extended it out to a week, but a similar course could be done for lay people in 2-3 days.
---
I agree, there is a stigma to mental healthcare, and thats why I think B4R has potential, but only if it is done right.  Gamers helping gamers is great, it provides a relatable platform, and it CAN be done in such a way that they are both able to provide approachable help, while still having the ability to provide help.
---
And no, I STRONGLY disagree with you on your last point.  If they are reaching out, it isn't as a last resort.  They WANT help, and the person they reach out too should be able to help.
---
yes, do that too

Brother, dropping in and out of combat at a whim, without any significant repercussion will completely annihilate PVP as we know it in EVE. If one can insta-log off at will, you can't catch anything in roams, you can't drop, you can't bait, you can't trap. The only thing available will be arranged fleet fights. That's not Eve.
---
DEDs can be run in less time than abyssals. In fact, I run 10/10 guristas in 15' with Ishtars. I'll agree on the isk investment, but EVE has always been about balance between risk, reward and commitment. A 1 day toon with no investment in injectors can't have access to the same things a year old does.
---
Who said anything about joining corps to AFK VNI and mine? People do it successfully in hisec, for crying out loud. That's the beauty of EVE, no one NEEDS to do anything to have fun or make isk, but one HAS TO do something and risk something to move ahead.
---
I don't have high hopes for CCP cause I doubt the people that make the decisions use their product, so they have no idea what they should be doing. Much less for PA, a company 100% unrelated to the game. But neither of them has made any official announcements about the future of the game. In fact, every new "item/mechanic" we've seen for the last year is old news, announced more than a couple of years ago. The rest is just refinement of products, attempts to fix bugs and chronic issues and production of novelty items that are absolutely meaningless for gameplay. But I won't accuse them for what they MIGHT do until they actually announce their plans. And seriously, have you seen other launchers and the amount of ads in them? You don't play the launcher for crying out loud, you just launch the game from it! If you don't see anything good coming down the pipeline, it's because the pipeline is completely clogged at the moment, and tho I find that terrible for the game, it's got nothing to do with future plans and very much to do with past mistakes!
---
As for what market forces are pushing towards, I'd be very careful speculating. As EA, Bethesda and now 4A games got burned with their brainstorms regarding microtransactions, payable DLCs, changing publishers in the last moment for profit and even threatening fans and players (who are actually paying customers), the market is in a state of total flux. I'm expecting CCP and PA to go where the money is; right now, the money is in a state of changing locations, so they'll probably wait for the chips to fall before any major moves. That's exactly why they're trying to work on bugs and selling new skins. Working on bugs is good publicity (at least, when it works \*wink\* Jita chat \*wink\*) and novelty items have been a steady source of revenue for game industry since their invention.
---
Agree'd, then let's stop linking suicidal people to a discord ran by a bunch of clowns when they want to off themselves and link them good proper ways to get help instead.

First of all I'd like to apologize that i insinuated that you'd be of the opinion that people should just end it that was intellectually dishonest of me because i was really pissed. But i'd like to respectfully disagree i think it is important that thzere are normal people out there with no training whatsoever people can talk to if they would be actually trained some may shy away form them for the same reason they shy away from speaking to a professional. I think it is very important to be able to talk to someone that is just like you and maybe just listens to what you have to say. without trying to lead the conversation in a certain direction cause honestly that can feel manipulative.

---
I didn't mean my last point to come off as a end-of-story type of statement regarding the individual broadcasting. I simply meant to convey my belief that most people who are reaching out via the B4R channel are most likely looking to speak with someone they have a tentative connection to, via EVE, and who isn't a "pro".
---
I absolutely agree that people legitimately reaching out desire help, but I don't think pushing them off towards more professional channels is the correct approach. As others has commented, if that's what they were looking for, they most likely would have gone with those channels instead.
---
i'm pretty fond of combat explaration and scanning down DED sites. Pretty good money in lowsec, too.

---
Removed out of duplicity.
---
There's a discussion already in the thread, there's no need for an additional post that simply restates your comment.
---
There are support links for all avenues provided, which you can clearly see in our wiki.
---
As a service user of 10 year myself, I already see professionals and yet in crisis would still rather talk to friends/strangers than a support line. The cynic in me see's a support line as people trained to jump you through the hoops to stop you doing something you shouldn't. I know many others that think the same.
---
It's clear that B4R is not a substitute for a professional service. It was never intended as such, never claimed to me, and never aspires to be.
---
It is simply an additional channel for those that feel it is helpful to them.
---
I will repost this comment in the other thread
---
Honestly, both sides have some pretty decent arguments. I'm not really sure what to think, but this thread is definitely going to get modded.
---
It is important to note that I'm not saying to staff B4R with all professional crisis managers, but to have a baseline of training for their volunteers.  The best suicide intervention course I've taken was a week long course, with about half of that course being aimed at people in a professional setting.  A layperson version of that course would be a 2-3 day class, that teaches things like active listening, when to interject, and when / how / why to hand someone off to higher care.
---
why would i spend 6 hours trying to fuck up what a guy can spend an hour netflix ratting to make back?

Ok but I don't think we should forget why and for whom it is 'too hard'. It's a hunting issue. You were implying that people like it better to sit and crab, I don't think that's the case. I think there are hundreds of bored people sitting around waiting for a handful of people to deliver them content. And for those people, yes, it is too difficult.

Jesus christ you're autistic. You realize that people play games to get away from their problems, and communities within them have objectively and historically helped people. A lot of people with issues putting them into a B4R situation are not gonna fucking get told by an eve player to talk to a therapist and then go do it. It's reaching out and allowing an environment for them to exist in if they feel comfortable. Trying to pretend like you need a degree to help someone is fucking pathetic tbh, you clearly are extremely unqualified to have any involvement in helping people or existing in a setting where people would need help. You're so open to accusing people who do of "killing people", I imagine you'll be willing to do the same yourself, since you're very clearly incapable.

ACE is designed around having someone physically present that the person in crisis is familiar with and trusts.  Its main priority is to maintain safe custody of that person from initial contact to handoff to a healthcare provider.  While there is some deescalation, it isn't it's main focus.
---
B4R on the other hand is volunteers who don't know the people they are helping, and have no way to ensure safe transfer to mental health providers.  B4R could call the providers literally the minute of, but they wouldn't be able to ascertain that the scene was safe, or that the person in question didn't have a means of harming themselves.
---
My #1 fav thing to do in eve..... Cloaky sneak up to miners in a festival launcher fit happiness bomber and unleash the loudest and brightest fireworks I can find on market.

it's too difficult by definition because it's not worth doing for more people than ever before in eve's history
---
I have trouble managing 4 accounts, sometimes I even slide the mouse pointer towards Eve and then away when I realise the shit ton of logistics and organisation I'm about to do. A few years ago it was easy. I'm getting oooold. How you manage over a hundred is frankly amazing.
---
CCP has **always** taken the wrong approach with this issue, no reason to change course now. Everybody who has played this game knows stories of real life threats and issues communicated very publicly; something that 10/10 of other games would instantly put an end to and yet nothing is ever done.  Unless you are a high profile content creator then you can say whatever you want and nothing will be done.
---
I'm telling you first hand, there is no flair baiting, I'm an actual long time CODE. agent keeping space safe from bot aspirants. Not a single week goes by that I do not encounter a player making explicitly clear threats against me, my family or themselves. I have always taken the time to document and report such behaviors to CCP. Would anyone like to guess how many times action has been taken? OF course, CCP won't admit their failings but I can assure you that after writing a message full of spoilers to the plot to the next Saw movie you will be happily mining/botting away in a belt in highsec for months thereafter. 
---
It'd also be nice if we could stick all our clones in one station.
---
and get rid of some of the excessive session timers between changing clones, boarding ships, and joining fleets etc.
---
why does it take me nearly 60 seconds to leave ship, change pod, board ship, join fleet, and undock? oh right because for 55 of those 60 seconds there was some bullshit invisible session timer going on.

While you might not be super interested in using the equations in the sheet, i had to do some major overhauling to the back-end equations. It now is a bit more accurate, and when a resource's "Stored at end of production" number is negative, production down that line will report as a number limited by that resource rather than an error. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LRH3raAMzpkyEfvR4vuG7Ees2QbbbUbo/view?usp=sharing 
---
There's also some points where i added in the ability to simulate the profit gains from buying resources at a price and adding them into production.
---
Where did I EVER say that you need a degree to help?  Baseline training can be done in a few days, there are several courses that could be used and suit the needs of B4R.  The problem here is the fact that B4R and their supporters REFUSE to acknowledge that there is a duty to make sure that there are proper safety nets.  Screeching at me and calling me autistic won't change that fact.

Oof 10b, let’s go. They didn’t show up when TEST + goon SIGs attacked PH.
---
ok.
---
Having been on both sides of the fence, I can tell you 2 things:
---
Sometimes, for several reasons, it's extremely difficult to let a relative or friend know that you're in trouble and you're terrified about asking for help from the professionals. Usually the reason is shame for what you feel/are/do and fear for being singled out and laughed at from the people near you. Especially in small, tradition-heavy communities. In that case, talking to a guy whose face you've never seen and never going to, that is a million miles away, is much easier, especially if he says he's willing to listen. And the first step to finding a solution to a problem, is talking about it. Of course, in no way is a random stranger with zero training capable of helping a person facing serious issues, but a random stranger is better than no one. What the people in B4R should do is listen and offer the one, best advice: consider visiting a professional. Anything else could be dangerous.
---
On the other side, some people do want to help others. Helping makes you feel good, makes you feel strong. It also can become a terrible weight, it carries a dreadful responsibility and can pull you down and destroy you along with the person you're trying to help. But that doesn't mean that turning a blind eye and covering your ears is better. Some people need help, and sometimes you're the one they turn to. Again, the best thing to do is offer to listen to them, and give them the best advice you can: ask them to consider visiting a professional. Anything else would be heartless and dangerous.
---
PS: If B4R plans to ask for RL funds in the future, they should also consider talking to professionals... I mean lawyers of course. The best way to make sure you don't get scammed or have the funds stolen/abused/embezzled, is to have a guy trained for it make your procedures ironclad. If B4R wants to just raise awareness, they can set up free-for-all brawls and I'm pretty sure 99% of capsuleers will join.
---
oh hi marshy

Just say you don't want to deal with this subject and be done with it, no need to waterboard me with your bullshit.

---
As you can see Loki is best both solo and for fleet and rest of them are pretty much even (depending on application some are slightly better or worse)
---
Not sure how much of it comes from it being "OP" or just from it's versatility- can be armor or shield buffor or active, can use guns or missiles... No need to change t3c when you want to swap doctrine fit or try a new tank/ dps setup. It's also fastest and has highest scan rez (and arties- highest alpha) so a decent % of those kills comes from gatecamps. Good troglodyte F1 gatecamp ship =/= good pvp ship, but it looks good in statistics.
---
good answer
---
Now, I know nothing about B4R btw. But here's the way I think about it.
---
If I'm at a bus stop and another guy comes up and sits down.  We say "Hi" to each other. If his next words are, "I'm thinking about killing myself," I'll talk to the dude.  Because my only other options are calling authorities or walking away.  And that's how I kind of picture B4R.  Maybe I'm wrong and it's much more complicated than that, but that's my thoughts on it.
---
I never run more than 3 accounts (have more) as i am bad in managing them.       
---
TBH stuff that you pointed out here is telling me that i need to pay for ISBOXER to compete with people like you.        
---
This is sad 
---
I really don't see the point in running t1's...
---
Yeah N2 / intel programs are also sad.   
---
Good software aint free and its not against the EULA. You can get eve o preview which is similar.
---
Lets be realistic I control one camper toon at a time. Check system for derp and light cyno...    
---
&gt; as I still don’t see why I would upgrade to omega.
---
Then how exactly do you have much of an opinion if you cant use 90% of mods or ships in the game?
---
&gt; Then I decided to see PvP as this is what EVE brags about. I wandered null sec for hours and hours and found like 2 or 3 other ships which wiped me in a few seconds.
---
Well duh, youre a child trying to fight his dad at that point, go to low sec with a cheap frig - dont jump into adult swim and expect the lifeguards to let you do whatever you want.
---
You are making a lot of assumptions about both what's happening and what is valuable to eve that I just don't think are true. PvE is already more casual, easy, and safe than it ever has been in eve. I don't think pushing it further in that direction is a good thing for the game.
---
That's basically a meme. Eve has ups and downs in terms of player counts and it is a bit behind its prime but at the current rate it will take a very, very long time (many years, likely over a decade given the history of other MMO's and this one) for it to be a 'dead' / maintenance mode MMO. 
---
The subreddit and the community at large has been spamming "Eve is dead / dying" largely as a tongue in cheek joke for a decade + - so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
In terms of "is it a good time" - that depends on what you really like to do. The types of content that are available specifically in terms of meta game stuff changes randomly. Right now there probably won't be any massive supercapital brawls on the level of b-r for awhile - we literally just had several back to back with the northern war. But there is super capital content daily (just not 400+ titan level). 
---
It's about as good a time as any, really. I tend to play more during major wars involving my alliance and I go casual when any aren't going on. If you're not that type of person I don't really see any reason not to, if Eve is your thing.
---
it was sarcasm btw, how retarded can you be to really thing stay lonely in depression is the best way to deal with
---
This has been my opinion on those threads all along, well said.
---
I have no idea of what's happening in this video other than the obvious damage. I started a week ago and I'm finding myself grinding quite well, I'm also writing down a Google sheet with things I'm doing and other stuff, might post it a day in the future.

Well, the game has a F2P part that should entice people into subscribing, right?
---
So far I didn’t have a fun experience, so I am glad I didn’t subscribe yet. :)
---
If you are saying people should subscribe to start having fun, then the F2P part of the game is irrelevant and should have been removed.
---
I will wander low sec for a while, but I still don’t see much people on it willing to fight. On my low sec travels pretty much everyone on local was either sitting docked or near structures that kill me when I engage.
---
Your attitude is disappointing compared to all the support I have been receiving in game. Not everyone has the time available to sink into the game as much as it’s currently required. That’s the purpose of this post, right? I wanted to contribute with my experience with how I felt about the game given my limited time commitment.
---
If I am not this game’s audience, then fine. But if the game wants to be more accessible to people like me, something should change inside the game.

I love the community and all the wikis, universities, etc. People really devoted a lot of their time to contribute to create a better game environment regarding accessibility.

you have the risk of losing your clone in a citadel but not in a station.  That would need to be balanced somehow by making station clones have some negative.  just isk cost?

So i decided to just go for it around downtime when it was quiet. I got the entire ark done after DT as it was starting to pick up again without seeing a soul until the final mission #13 when i got popped on my way to drop off the final quest item. Fortunately the guy who killed me was a bro and looted the holoreels and contracted them back to me and i finished the ark and got my gila. For any one thats wondering im an 800k sp alpha and can now pull L4 missions after 10 hours of playtime. I can fly a gila in said lvl 4s,but it requires blinged modules as i cant fly t2 yet. Very effective isk/hr for someone with under 1 mil sp as an alpha. 
---
Sick post.
---
Gila or VNI for haven ratting?
---
Yeah there's no reason why stations shouldn't also let you do this.
---
IKR? But every now and then he makes a good point.
---
The session timers are there because otherwise weird desync effects can happen, not because CCP think they're great gameplay. The one on reshipping inside a citadel was added precisely because crazy stuff was happening before they did.

For bigger amounts, definitely use contracts like the other guy said

This is a more complicated issue than it appears on the surface. The main reason Chevis and I pushed so hard to redo the b4r process in terms of the subreddit is partially because of what you said. However B4R's still appear here. Right now we have a 'warm' transfer policy in place but we can't actually stop people from coming here for B4R's.

In quite a few cases simply linking suicide prevention groups was met with outright refusal / rejection. Some of the posts I've seen and dealt with have been legitimately terrifying. They wanted the b4r process and that was the only thing they would consider. That puts us in a spot where we can't outright remove them from the sub - despite the sub going very sour around them. We're not even remotely equipped to deal with them here - and that's an opinion I hold very strongly. But when someone comes to you with some absolutely chilling stuff and expects a b4r response.. what are we to do? We can't tell them to call a suicide prevention hotline and wash our hands of it. We have to do the best we can with the admittedly awful situation.
---
In an ideal world they never should have come here to begin with - but they do and so here we are. I'm open to discussion and suggestions about how best to handle this. I'm not an expert in this field, not even remotely. But I do have a side of the story that you all don't know about that could very well change your opinion on it.
---
If someone who is an expert in the field is willing to go over this thing in detail and advise us - that would be very welcome.

---
Talking to someone is almost always going to help someone, even if in just a small way for some, B4R helps provide a voice to talk to via the shared connection of EvE.
---
I've been on both sides of the issue at hand and even putting aside my anecdotal experience I don't understand the vitriol from some people about this.
---
Consider Predditors, the TEST covops SIG.
---
We don't emphasize combat blops but we do hotdrop, gank, and use stealth bombers on the reg. We're also big fans of small gang pvp. And because of the natural crossover many of our members are blops enthusiasts.
---
Can confirm it is actually both. 
---
I like exploration, cheap small ship PVP and doing casual fleet ops with my corp mates.

---
Depending on how far you can get, you might even start a fight. Pretty sure that's what happened the other night when my buddy and I went in there to faff about. Right as we hit a gate, we saw local pop, and burned upward from the gate and cloaked. Then another group that we assume was chasing us through the prior gate comes crashing in. There was some awkward staring, then the two groups had it out. It was funny

Better ask who made it.

Aren't security missions exactly what you propose? If you don't finish them, you can come back during any of the following 7 days and finish it?
---
As a professional you then know the vital importance of human contact in stress situations, the role discussions with friends, collegues or relatives play in people's mental wellbeing. 
---
And once we remind ourselves that B4R is mostly a chat room to talk to people and only then anything else - why would you urge people stop talking to each other? Especially for cases where someone feels that that is the only place they can go to? 
---
In professional terms B4R is not at all suicide responder service. It's somewhere between a Concerned Stranger an a Mental Health First Aider. So, two steps before the point you are making...

Maybe he forgot to pay the “protection fee”...

---
Sorry about the delay in posting.  Being a passive listener can give the perception of nonchalance or apathy.  When someone is in emotional dire straits, an important aspect of the process is to affirm that you are listening and paying attention to their problems.  If they feel like there isn't anyone who cares, or that they aren't important, that could wind up fueling that self-confirmation.

You do however ignore the satge they do that at...

We are not talking about immediate suicide intervention. Whatever the adverts say, B4R are there to provide a symoathetic ear to unload to when one is stressed. In 3 years I had only seen one distraught person - and they were not in any risk, only on spectrum and feeling lost and abandoned, needing simple chat. 
---
The entirety of you argument stemms from an idea that B4R seems like some sort of semi-professional suicide help-line. Which they are not and never pretended to be. People sometimes claim they do that, but they are there not for that. Same as a cofee-club next door is not specifically emergency services, but they can provide locals with a place to hang out and chat after hard day at work.
---
then it would be nice if we could fix issues properly instead of bullshit band aids.

You're throwing a shitfit over a gay little internet charity. You are legitimately mentally ill.

Why is leadership V required for the 10/10 ded escalations? It seems a little weird that a skill affecting command bursts would be a requirement for running an escalation. Also, does everyone need leadership V to enter the site?
---
That is not what b4r are there for 99% of the time though. The vast majority of people coming in are there to chat. To share their burdens. They are not at risk yet. They need someone to talk to and whatever the reasons - choose strangers in a game for that. Why deny them that?

Old post but I'm bored and will answer why this is a bad idea, even if others have basically given this same answer.
---
You're putting the burden on the alliance to enforce some damn near unenforceable rules.  What do you think is easier to get people to do after a welp, donate their insurance payout to the alliance, or file for their srp?  The first one is going to be damn near impossible to get 100% compliance.  It also would only work with t1 ships.
---
If an alliance is doing a fair ammount of industry to better option is just to build and sell ships in the staging system at near jita prices (slight markup to prevent spies from totally fucking you), and pay people when they lose their ships.

The Ochre rule is there to keep anoms cycling. You have to mine the Ochre first, though mining Mercoxit is allowed if you're in a barge. Violators get shot or fined depending on circumstance.

It all started when sous chef braxus noticed dura anchoring and trying to online a pos. He put the buns in the oven and started slowly seeding hot sticky dreads in there as a defense. It’s gone back and forth with dura continually coming back for their weekly fight.
---
Repair your overheated module with nanite repair paste. 
---
I disagree. This is a bonus of having a citadel. More citadels in space should mean more loot.
---
its was more there was so much time he could have done that and just left his guns all fucked 
---
Well in a Venture in highsec I make 2M ISK per hour. In a mining fleet in nullsec with a Procurer I make 20-40M ISK per hour. So there is mining, and there is mining.
---
Is this a botting programme?

November. That's not that long ago.

That's the point... Its always just a few that's usefull. Why not give us more ways to use the other unused ships.

Oh, you know. Just having actual fights that aren't turbo blobs. Nothing to see here. Return to your rorquals.
---
Save up enough to make it worthwhile and then make a courier paying 1 million per jump. Drop the contract link into “Haulers Channel” in game chat channel and you’ll likely see it picked up quite quickly as long as it’s not an awful route or awful pay. 
---
Almost every time I’ve used that channel I’ve had my stuff moved in less than an hour though the least duration you can put is a day so they can take up to 24 hours. Make sure you put a proper amount of collateral.

Bunch of dudes with somewhat expensive toys catch a big mining man. They get the big mining man to low health before he presses his "I'm invulnerable now" button. While he's invulnerable, 2 of his buddies show up in giant healy ships.
---
Thinking quickly, the leader of the expensive toys brings the toys to the heal boys to keep them in place, because they can't shoot the mining man anyway.
---
Then they fly back to the mining man when his ship stops being invulnerable, and kill him. After killing him, they leave, milliseconds before they all get trapped in place by an enemy.
---
You don't fuck up the place in 6 hours tbf, just 1 small citadel can takes over a week to kill and it costs less than faction bs without fitting
---
I don't actually agree with your premise. Lots of PVE *is* dippable in and out of. Mining, wormhole ratting, HS/LS combat sites and DED hunting, exploration - you have plenty of options to spend time in 15-20 minute chunks and leave after any site. I think missions allow that as well, don't they?
---
&gt; DED's though, require significantly more of a time/isk investment to be considered viable for a newbro
---
DED 1-4 in highsec really don't.
---
You won this round

---
I just wanted to make a thread with this question but then saw this so I'll just ask it here:
---
Can one function in a major alliance like PL, NC, goons, etc, including flying capitals, on one account? I suppose now that even supers can dock with the right citadel it should in theory be possible to just have everything one account, with perhaps some moneymaking on alts on the same account. But is it actually something one can do without running into all kinds of practicality issues? (Cyno alt being expected, not knowing whether caps will be used and thus departing first in a subcap only to find out that it was time to bring your carrier)
---
I'm asking because I would rather not start a second account (financial reasons). So I'm considering to just train capitals on my main, but perhaps that's a bad idea.
---
Or the last keepstar fight in H-5GUI where GOTG and winterco brought a combined 5 bombers and like 20 frigates...
---
lmao implying you undock
---
killing people to the point they quit and never return
---
You mean incursions? 
---
You understand that the last time a panfam keepstar was attacked, GOTG brought like 20 dudes in frigates, right?
---
"Best buddy" lmao
---
That is very nicely done.
---
Posting on reddit because the game is shit.

you can see the session change timer in the top left corner, it's not "invisible".

---
Isnt chinese typed using pinyin on an regular roman alphabet keyboard? 
---
So, you mean, like.... lockouts?  That mechanic where it will lock you out of a boss fight you've already completed it this week?
---
That was to keep you from gearing up a whole raid team on one particular raid all at once, but it has pretty much the same effect.
---
Function? Definitely. Will you have issues? Definitely. You pointed out a few of them yourself, so you seem to already have a good grasp on the problem. Honestly, I'd just stay as a subcap pilot, you'll have 90% of the content, you don't have to bother with cynos etc. Maybe just train a cap to rat or mine with. 
---
Excellent summary.
---
Can some tell me how to say “I’m sure your mother is a very nice lady and I hope she lives a long happy and healthy life” in Russian properly.
---
Yes it can, but some people actually have a tablet + pen or touchscreen system to write characters normally
---
Alpha has uses, namely letting people try a portion of the game and some niche uses for alt accounts.  But going omega does unlock a ton of content.  So... yeah, it isn't fair to expect the same experience from the two tiers.  If you do not like alpha at all, then Eve is not for you.  If you find alpha interesting and want to see the whole package, then it is doing the demo job.  Alpha is really limiting, and being an alpha outside [HS/LS](https://HS.LS) is going to be pretty rough, as a lot of the players in NS and WH have a lot more tools to kill you with that you cannot compete with in a straight up fight.
---
Also, Eve really works best in a Corp/Alliance for a myriad number of reasons, and many have options for Alphas, so I would highly suggest joining an Alpha friendly group who can show you the cool shit to do in Eve.
---
I want to add something about the large noob corps. They can get some hate here because of capital blob warfare and null politics. Dont worry about all that for now. The benefits of those groups is they offer free ships, free skillbooks, lessons, and a supportive community. If you stay in highsec it is very easy to develop a risk averse playstyle and is hard to make decent isk. Even though the major alliances exist in null sec you will actually find that the space is safer than high sec because of intel channels, neighbors with positive standings towards you, and a standing fleet. The measly isk you will make in high sec solo will barely be enough to cover your skill books, must less buying expensive ship fits. Null security space with one of those groups can get you in to anomaly ratting or exploration and you will make way more isk, get your books for cheap or free and they all have well stocked trade hubs and logistics services/buybacks for when you need to ship stuff to jita for sale or procure rare blingy modules. All that being said if you still dont like the idea of player owned null sec you can try eve university instead, which offers all tye same services but with campuses in highsec, lowsec, NPC controlled nullsec and in a wormhole. 
---
Could you tell me how to properly write “I’m sure your mother is a very nice lady and I hope she lives a long, happy, and healthy life” sometimes I go the really nice route to mix it up
---
trust me, only you're\* confused if you think there can't be more than one cult in eve
---
This is CCP, you're lucky to get bullshit bandaids.
---
I think that would be a good alliance name, or coalition
---
http://www.barryovereem.com/wp-content/uploads/Dilbert-on-legacy-code.png
---
So... missions are pretty drop in/out.  So are abyssals, and mining, and exploration.  All can be done in 30 min or less efforts.  I think the issue is that these are not as streamlined as "go to quest giver and do quest" in other games.
---
Another issue is that the more lucrative/interesting PvE content is designed to be a gateway to PvP.  I live in WH space (wormholer BTW) and I would wager 30% to 50% of our PvP content arises from PvE, either by us baiting, us dropping on a PvE group, or the reverse.  If we could run sites with literally no worry about leaving part way through it would destroy a major element of the game.  I can only imagine this has parallels in LS/NS.  Forcing someone to commit to a PvE event for X minutes means committing to potential PvP for X minutes.
---
I personally miss the days of prenerfed magnetometric and scanning sites. 
---
That was the most engaging type of PVE for me, and on good runs could net 100's of mill/hr with very high risk in deep nullsec. 
---
It required dual boxing. One ship to scan the wrecks and another to tank and kill the rats. 
---
Then getting out with the loot was another ordeal. A heartpumping adventure of going 25 jumps througg deep nullsec with billions of isk worth of salvage in your cargo. 
---
Of course CCP fucked this up too. Made scanning sites soloable in 5mill isk ships,  and made it brain dead boring. 
---
I thought the same till I did it and it cleared up. This is definitely a real bug.
---
That's fair but in reality there is a trade-off. I can bounce clones all I want in cits but I also risk losing an expensive pod, possibly because someone was late fuelling their pub cits. If I could do it in npc stations I'd never do it in cits
---
Looks like a 2014 era WH dread brawl
---
Thanks for the answer; I suppose I could spend some training time on it if there's nothing else I care much about; a suitcase carrier is nice for moving shit I guess and maybe I could use it in combat if an ideal situation ever happens but not expect to be able to participate in every cap drop and such.
---
You can do it on the fly though, can't you? What about auto detecting loads of ships in a system?
---
You have private citadels, also currently stations are now in NPC space only. Nothing in SOV.             
---
Also each clone change cost on station and is free on citadel.          
---
This. Why would I bother with cit cloning? And why dv a factual response?
---
Man it’d also be nice if global climate change was just a feature we could turn off on our instance but sometimes shit just doesn’t *work* that way.
---
A CCP member said no one had asked for a reinforced node in that very thread.
---
It's different depending on the pirate faction, but each 10/10 gate requires a somewhat random skill at 5 to let you pass. Yes, each character entering needs the skill. I bet not even CCP can tell us the thinking behind having these completely random skill requirements.
---
VNI for better ticks, Gila if you're planning to call your friends and tank the attacker.
---
Only poors care about the insignicant cost of jumpcloning
---
Jokes on you, his bucket list item was actually “Garth saying a kind word to me” I think bud works 
---
This is the only C6-C6 Red Giant in the game. Dura has been pushing for it since the HK eviction. Every couple of days Dura will make a push and HK/Hawks will push them back in their place. Looks like Dura decided to escalate and got shown the door. That hole is very well seeded with defense by HK. I think Dura is just hoping to burn Sprinkles out as they don't really stand a chance otherwise.
---
&gt; MMO's with a traditional RPG/3rd Person element like Neverwinter or WoW, allow you to drop in and out of combat at a whim
---
I'm referring to his desire to enter and leave combat at a whim, make the game as engaging as you want.
---
imagine being so bureaucratic that you can't even reinforce one node after weeks of tidi slugfests
---
Its hard to support thieves...just saying.

Imagine being so incompetent you can't create some reinforcement requests for your spaceship battle.

I've been working on a book for years, and one of the characters was named Violet. I like the letter V, so "Violet Valcourt" it was.

it doesn't.
---
What color for goons?
---
Getting 3x the loot in the same amount of time far, far outweighs the filament cost.  TBH frigate abyssals are broken and kind of made most cruiser abyssmals a waste of time.
---
Bombers Bar. It's an entirely Anti Goon OSG(Only shoot goons) group
---
I set all big alliances as neutral since we're pretty indiff to all of them and want to kill them in equal parts. Red is for personal grudges/corp grudges and Orange for hot droppys
---
Without those session timers. Suspect baiting in Jita 4-4 would be ALOT more interesting.

Do you have any ideas on how to make the incredibly basic and boring movement and control system more engaging without completely changing the fundamentals of how eve works, no? Neither do CCP or anyone else.
---
Man, I d love if there d be REAL news in the launcher. Dunno, stuff that d be easily grabbable from CCPs data they got anyways: "Today 600 pilots died in \[system\]!", "A 200 bamboozillion ISK ship got killed in \[system\] today!" You get th eline... Infos that d be no opsec-stuff cause they d be accessably for anyone who searches for it, but that might interest folks and get im into things/areas/troubles they d not gotten into if no one d shoved that news into their face.
---
It is honestly shocking how far google translate has come along. For the most part, other than the screenshots, that whole post made sense.
---
Broken of course 
---
Wouldn't have it any other way 😂
---
There used to not be session timers when citadels came out - result: ships randomly spitting out of the structure unpiloted. Having to wait seems better
---
or just goons
---
So much yes
---
how about CFC ... :thinking:
---
Not going to lie, that is pretty funny. 
---
right?  Missions, anoms, and abyssal space all seem like drop in/drop out pve to me.   If you can't commit to play for ~20 mins at a time it seems like playing games in general is going to be very hard.  I guess I just don't get what they are asking for. 
---
why not )

you can set someone to 0 standings and then re-color 0 standings under overview settings &gt; appearance

My modem shat the bed, logged back in ded. 10/10 would tidi again. Also local in nearby systems full of locals going REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Y SO SLOW!1 It's hilarious. gf guise o7
---
fight over one of several unfit anchoring raitarus
---
skill/scourge: raitaru destroyed, 31bish lost (20 nightmares, 3 fax, infinite sabres) 
---
legacy/xix: 47b lost (200~ ferox, 4 dreads, 20 logi, 30~ hacs/recons/logi/commandships)
---
overall one of the best fights i've experienced in a long long time
---
from our (skillu) point of view: we tried to save the raitaru but realistically not possible vs that many drone ships and sniping nagas (and just people in general tbh, it's trivial to pause a raitaru). the fight we got was a good one, so worth the loss in the end
---
initially damaged ferox fleet pretty hard with an overlap bomb wave, and then managed engage it with nightmares at a perch. was able to keep the ishtars out of the fight for a while with decent bomb runs on their drones and killed feroxes with nightmares at a pretty good rate. we had one minokawa in and we knew about the dreads, which predictably counter dropped at 0. 
---
cleaned up the ferox fleet but couldnt really stay on top of the dreads due to the ishtars getting enough drones spread around the place, so only killed 4 before we were forced back to range, where we finished off the ferox fleet as the dreads extracted. the ishtars dropped their final set of drones and it was bombed, and thus the fight ended as they warped off (objective already won for ishtars)
---
died and ive been in warp for 5 minutes trying to reship
---
very cool!
---
It's almost like you didn't watch it?
---
I think they are talking about when you DC the game is just going to throw someone else in and that group is going to finish the dungeon. So when you log in 2 days later you are going to start up a fresh dungeon with a new group.   That said some games will lock you to a specific instance of a dungeon/raid so if the group finishes you are out of luck as I doubt they want to wait 2 days for you to log back in.  Other games might be nice and give you a checkpoint at the last boss you beat, or even let you start over but you might not be able to get loot from the bosses you already beat. 
---
anyways doesn't seem like a good example of drop in/drop out content. 
---
As the person who was repeatedly called an armchair dev... can I just point out I've never actually written code while in an armchair. 
---
I've done work from my office, my bed, my car, my kitchen, a park, and once upon a time I was debugging an error on my phone in the middle of a sex dungeon... but never from an armchair. 
---
I just read that fuckin post... Weird concidence for sure.
---
It seems like CCP puts the systems which connect to Jita - New Caldari, Sobaseki, Ikuchi, Muvolailen, Maurasi, and Perimeter, all on the same "supernode" of their own, but the downside is when Perimeter tanks, all the surrounding systems take the hit, too.   
---
Typically systems next to each other are rarely on the same node, but all the other systems that directly connect to Jita, including Perimeter, are experiencing TiDi. 
---

---
Go for a big Pith XX booster and invul for tank, heat both and you'll be fine against all ratters that are not caps, try to squeeze 2 heavy neuts onto it to break stuff faster, add MWD, cap booster, guns and gyros.
---
All blops need a bit of pimp to make them good, going full t2 you will need to use some meta mods and downsize one or more neuts. I'd recommend going brawl setup with ab and ditching the cloak (since it's gonna be cheap can go more yolo+ can refit in a safe if needed after the drop)
---
No
---
CPP can't interrupt that's why. What is atomic booleans plz
---
yup stain got dunk reliks and nomnom mongoo....boatfull good corp to start ur carreer(dont come to rps to ma reliks btw)
---
insurance was a mistake
---
This thread is cancer
---
Nord is great. It's one of the most popular ones for a reason.
---
Recently I read this [hyper detailed review](https://mrwebcapitalist.com/nordvpn-review/) about it and I see no reason not to use it.
---
GESI and google docs
---
Yep. That pretty much described what I was experiencing. Jita was fine but New Caldari/Niyabainen etc. were screwed.
---
Okay, sure, but EVE is a massive, complicated, legacy-code-filled thing. And you want to just casually get a fix on what is likely actually a really complicated race condition, coupled with the likelihood that even if you get a fix, there's still going to have to be SOME sort of timer, just a shorter one -- maybe five seconds instead of ten, or maybe it'd fluctuate based on if some database is getting smashed somewhere.
---
Software engineering at the scale of what CCP is doing is actually pretty fucking difficult, especially given that we don't live in a make-believe universe where technical debt doesn't exist -- the grim reality of all this is that it's complicated, and it's never going to _not_ be complicated.

lol short so I don't have to comprehend so much. Started out talking a big game and suddenly you've gone mostly quiet.  
---
I already listed the advantages multiple times. Local, supercap umbrella, alliance gates, citadels everywhere. Local can't be removed by the players. The other 3 require massive fleets. People like you are okay with this because your experience of eve pvp is anchoring an FC and pressing F1 in massive blob fights. You don't have the mental capacity to comprehend anything beyond that. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I bet your KB is entirely krab shit fit ships you die in or F1 blob mash kills. Fuck right off you're done. GG EZ

It was a bot, and they Awox bots. It’s a pretty common thing in the Chinese alliances

Because look at how that went for TEST? You can only get dunked be a defensive supercap umbrella so many times before Villy calls it off.
---
can you link a fit, cant seem to get it all to fit together without going low on cpu.
---
What the hell has been happening in Perimeter for the last week?
---
sounds to me like you need a corp! browse recruitment in the corp tab in-game/forums and pick the one that interests you the most. Eve-uni is a good one if your just starting out and unsure of yourself
---
a bunch of excuses doesn't change the basic fact; it would be nice if we could fix issues properly instead of bullshit bandaids.
---
I lost the last part. What would've happened if they didn't run away? Has it something to do with that ability of making someone unable to warp off?
---
GGs all around, that was a fun brawl :)
---
Again a pretty damn fun fight, logi saved the day \o/

Get your mining ships ready

PL is basically a vassal state of PH now.
---
Love seeing the blob get shit on. Hey legacy, where's the gloating you guys were doing after the last engagement?
---
Yes ccp should be able to snap their fingers and magically fix every defect in the game even though the game is over 15 years old. Clearly there would be very little effort and manpower needed to do this. 
---
Magician btw.

No that name was appropriated by the new CFC 2.0 up north.

IF you are going to run site solo and HAVE to be a marauder, then run the paladin. You can fit an impressive tank and neut resist along with applicable damage. ALWAYS make sure you roll all holes other then your home connection. And make sure to have a cloak alt on your entrance/exit hole and have jump activation turned all the way up.
---
 There isn’t one
---
Insurance in high sec is fine as a hand-holding mechanism for new players.  It makes no sense to provide such an ISK faucet and implicit hull cost modifier outside of Empire space.

FFS CCP. Do something about citadel spam, tons of containers in station inventory and the inability to use them like hangars for contracts, selling, etc. PVE in this game is boring as shit, and most of your recent creations drop shit loot and have too high of risk. Balance the game a little. 
---
It's as though you cannot hear. 
---
&gt; lol short so I don't have to comprehend so much 
---
I've written long and elaborated posts before, you didn't care. You didn't argue. Why waste more words?  
---
&gt; People like you are okay with this 
---
Because I recognize the value in build an empire in EvE, yes. Something you don't because you 
---
&gt; don't have the mental capacity to comprehend anything 
---
Besides your narrow minded point of view. Expand your Horizon maybe.
---
Ab on blops 
---
Removing the bonused cloak 
---
:thonking:
---
If you are not trolling, you wont have time to refit if someone is probing you down, and the cloak gets a great bonus that lets you safely cloak -&gt; warp which prevents you being tackled by anything but sabres or the fastest tackle.
---
For the ab: you will not sig tank anything in a BS and the speed you get is insignificant. Use a mwd or mjd, because if you got scrammed in a blops you fucked up badly.

Circa 2014 dreadbrawls are definitely the way to burn people out. Keep doing that exactly dura 
---
I don't see why not.  The last 5 events, they've ignored ALL PTR feedback and launched them with the main event broken, so why waste the time?  Can't wait to see what they break with this one.
---
Ive been wanting that for ages, just found out you can via PGL, working on my setup for it now!
---
@ [5:25](https://youtu.be/kwVUFdDM-1I?t=325) moments before the dictor bubble goes up and the fleet gets out look to the lower left between the chat windows and the HUD and you'll see the other fleet land in LEZZERA's anchored bubble.  &lt;3
---
Also require CAPTCHA at the end of each mission 
---
Holy fuck, dude, listen to yourself. CCP aren't fucking miracle workers, don't be an entitled little shit who doesn't understand the complexities of what you're asking.
---
Yes. They will need to move out of a bubble that prevents warp. In that time all the people getting in grid would have kill them and potentially tackle anyone that managed to not be in the bubble anymore.
---
The somewhat shinny ships also make you lose skill points so it’s terrible dying in one of those things 
---
get a sin

I think you grossly misunderestimate how many people multibox.  You keep using less than 1%, where, exactly, are you getting this number? Your ass doesn't count.

I dunno - ever since Catlos and I started playing together in 2010, I've always wanted to win Eve... Winning is pretty cool ... for now.
---
- Get blueprints. Lots of them. Start researching them. If its too expensive for you, buy copies.
---
- Get yourself a base of operations. A nice EC with enough bonus to make you competitive. Optionally: get to know the owner.
---
- Use a location a bit off from main industry areas - it gets a lot cheaper this way.
---
- Use public hauling services to offload your work.
---
- Get more capital. You never have enough.
---
- Get familiar with excel and maybe the API.
---
- Enjoy the game. Don't burn out shuffling items and numbers around. Burn you money in pvp.
---
Don't. You're welcome
---
Eve Online, the game that makes being a sociopath becoming the norm
---
Don't see any. Just ham lokis. But cool

to clarify, its the settings in the top right (E logo) and not the cog wheel settings at the bottom

So you play planet side  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Sweet revenge
---
As much as I dislike Test, it's hilarious how incredibly incompetent the rest of their coalition is without test herding them.
---
insurance makes sense on subcaps, but on caps its just wierd, like why would concord insure ships that cant even go to space that they control/protect? 
---
I was in a corp a long while ago - mainly pirates fueling our ships with sweet sweet tears.  I enjoyed my time.  My wife passed away.  I mentioned it in corp chat.  Wife and I were both in the fire dept - and so in our small corner of our state word got around.  Guy in corp chat recognizes things, private messages me, turns out *he’s* an EMT in the town over, recognized the death and now our names and we’ve even ran some mutual aid calls together before.  Never once talking abut eve, games, etc since it was all work related stuff.  He came to my wife’s funeral, shook my hand, and we both parted ways.  We’re cordial but never really transitions into IRL stuff. 
---
Just a small world.  I was thankful for his kindness. 
---
Wow after looking that up I really want a monocle now
---
Who would win an ihub timer ? the entire 40k legacy coalition or a ragtag pack of virgins multiboxing?
---
wait a second, HOW do you loose that many maels? and to WHAT?
---
How about instead if you want an instaswapping clone factory of your own you anchor it and defend it vs hiding in a NPC station?
---
Dura Lexx doing what they're best at, being shit at Eve

i personally feel that its sooooooo very cute of ccp to regard my alts as innocent newbies who dont have no clue of anything
---
War between Panfam and Imperium/Legacy over who gets the sales taxes. And it’s been going on for more than a week 
---
or just don't be part of the blob and fly somewhere where there aren't required paps or any of the other bullshit that nullblobs have to force on their members to get them out of their rorqs and actually in a "fight"
---
I think the straight down path all give skills. The two side options only give a small amount of ISK iirc.
---
Why would I reply if you didn't even put in enough effort to open up Gulnar's vid where he disclosed all of his fits? 
---
Thank you!
---
Same thing as for last months. TAPI fights Horde over the control of Plex market. For bigger fights Goons join Dinos, and rest of the Panfam back up Horde. But yeah, these fights recently simply got bigger. Today there was 2000+ people in Perimeter local.
---
god i hate pvp when will it end
---
(I’ll report if it’s a bug, but I don’t think it is a bug) 
---
so let me hear you explain how to fix the bugs then
---
I mean sometimes it's a structure bash, but that's clearly not what was going on here. This was an extensive subcap fleet fight. 
---
Pink for alliance waifu
---
oh so you smug when you win with 3 times the numbers but when you lose or it's even on isk it's suddenly a good fight need not bitter ))
---
blopsing is dead.
---
~~yes~~wait, nah
---
And perhaps PamFam could be "The Band of Brothers" ? 
---
API and coding skills
---
Who the fuck lost an Orca? Lmao
---
Hey, that's some awesome screen caps. Nice work.
---
All credit to bedidia springfield - he tanked like a boss, and really made us work for this kill.  
---
The Nope-Nazu pilot on the other hand......  This is the second rorq rescue this week where I've seen him jump out as soon as he landed on the combat grid.  
---
Write Falcon a mail and ask for a tour while you are there!

evetrade.space is pretty useful.

would probably be bigger than eve actually OMEGALUL
---
There's the dual web armor kestrel fit. I'm sure if you check zkill you can find it, I can't look for it now. There's kite condors but it'll take you 40 minutes to kill anything. The good news is you can fit rockets to that too. It's also able to fit a neut, which can be really handy against SAAR fits that are designed to have enough cap to last barely enough time for one fight
---
I would of had his lunch money until graduation.
---
How can you possibly pass up the most ideal set up to pay him back for screwing you over?
---
This guy would be my new best friend. We’d fucking share underwear together [as an image, not something I do in real life], Then, when the setup was complete and I was ready to hit him back, I’d make it a triple whammy.
---
Seriously, “Hi, it’s me, I know what you did but I’m over it?” Fuck everything about that!

[https://pastebin.com/PDjbYg93](https://pastebin.com/PDjbYg93) its what I used to kill ded runners (mostly tengus) and some rattles in horde space where I didnt wanna use my expensive BLOPS, it did really well until it had to face tank a carrier :) 
---
Where to begin...? For all the "PvE is boring" whiners. Go play WoW. PvE is not the point of EVE. It's a means to an end. The end: player conflict on a massive (or small) scale.
---
EVE is a sandbox MMO, and it's unlike many of the other titles that claim that.
---
Like all games EVE has activities that are boring. Activities that don't pay well (at first), and activities that are addicting. Take mining. It's payout sucks. Until you go to 0.0 and get a Rorqual. At which point your income is steady and sure (until player conflict arrives, but this keeps things interesting). 
---
The best thing about EVE is variety. If your present activity bores you just do something else. I play Naval Action. It has 2 "PvE" activities: Shoot cannon balls at NPC ships, or carry trade goods from port to port. Whoopie! Two things! 
---
To all the "PvE in EVE takes too much commitment." This comment doesn't bode well for your future marital arrangements. EVE is a hard game. Learn to master it, and PvE won't be a grind, it'll be relaxing, profitable, and engaging.
---
I hear your howls of rage already. Chill out, because I'll tell you the secret to accomplishing mastery in EVE. You're going to love it.
---
Find a master. Be respectful. Talk with them. Befriend this master. Learn.
---
It's a simple formula. It will make PvE easy. Allowing you to begin dabbling in what EVE truly is all about: PvP.
---
Good luck!
---
Concord doesn't insure, get your RP game straight.
---
Yeah I guess that would make it a bug. I thought that since the 5 minute timer was up, it was possibly intended to allow for an escape, but that’d be an absolute garbage mechanic if it were intended! 
---
[Clearly you have no idea how to use a stealth bomber.](https://i.imgur.com/kl3MbRi.jpg)
---
I mean yeah, it would be nice to reduce or remove timers, but presumably there is a reason that can't happen. For example if you didn't put one in and 'switched clones' maybe your clone would switch in your client, but not in the server, and you'd die in your 'clean clone' with a 2 bil killmail.
---
4:1 in pilot count
---
"even"
---
k bud.
---
Hence requiring one final 10s timer before undocking. Changing clone/ship/fleet etc resets the timer, but you still can't undock for the full 10 seconds. There is already a version of this leniency while docked, where you can leave a ship or get back into one in certain circumstances with a timer still active. Expand that to the rest.
---
Umm, if I remember correctly after the timer is up both players die? Not sure if it depends on which level of abyss it is..
---
Thanks for tidiing the Jita-surround systems and holding up our logi runs :(
---
Skills as in SP? Or skillbooks and such? Also ty for the reply
---
I think that's a bug, yeah. The gate's only supposed to open when someone dies.
---
I too can talk about the corp in my flair. Us and @OP shall get to know each other soon
---
What you got for a computer? Monitor set up?
---
Interesting idea using untanked Oracles. I suppose if you know you're going to be volleyed regardless of how many logi you bring you can go for a strat like that.
