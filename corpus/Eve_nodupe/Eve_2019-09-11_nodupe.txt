See now I know I am on the right track here.

and development resources (art, coders, etc). also pretty sure CCP won´t call a lot of shots in the future to where they have to allocate resources because it´s PAs IP and company, not theirs. Also their new MMO thingy whatever that might be needs people to work on and it´s not like they got a lot left. If the PA overlords say they want to milk the same or more profits out of rather small playerbase that needs a lot of maintenance and upkeep, first thing i would do is kick everyone out who isn´t actively paying hard currency on a regular basis. change the infrastructure to reduce costs. manipulate the PLEX market to my liking. then milk the remaining junkies for everything they´ve got. ezpz.

As opposed to just bringing in a cloaked, brick-tanked recon?
---
You want climate change?
---
Co2 is how you get climate change.
---
Taking the risk of stroking Malcanis' ego here (disclaimer: I haven't read anything beyond the top comment), any change implemented to help new players/small groups will have a bigger positive effect on larger groups. Those groups have the numbers and/or organisation to deal with changes more easily than smaller groups.
---
good.
---
agreed.
---
Less people playing a mmo is good huh? Retard
---
Awesome, love your style!
---
Cool
---
Yes let me check my notes from when I listened to it.... and on open comms omeca basically says he has never been happier about eve
---
Can confirm about Dscan. I'm fortunate as an off-again, on-again EVE player to have a friend that plays way more (and put me into her corp this time, which has made things so much less miserable for other reasons), so she was able to explain exactly how Dscan works. Helpful to spot Triggle murderballs before I go trying to mine. I'm just waiting for the invasion to leave my happy little neck of the woods.

---
Went through the NPE again with a for the lulz alt on the same account, and noticed that while it's improved from the first two times I did it, it's still hot garbage.
---
ofc
---
You are deluding yourself
---
Shot a Wreathe lighting a industrial cyno today,
---
It lit it for a rhea.
---
Wreathe was empty, worth 2 mill on zkill.
---
Lots of warping to local stations to recharge. Doable, but a stretch. I say this as I'm sitting in a Raitaru repping my Navy Drake before going back to the site again.
---
A great way to end the fleet for sure :D
---
Yeah i don’t mind shooting cyno alts. But there should be some counter Indy dudes should be able to have.
---
or you could just understand how highsec works and not be a tool when someone pokes holes in your ignorant theory that bots left and didn't just move to highsec.
---
I won EVE for about 2/3 a year... What did I miss?
---
If the slope continues it will go to 0
---
Wait, making NS nearly worthless is bad for the game? What?
---
Because the argument being made is complete shit and they have no idea what they are talking about, so they just picked random data points and decided it supports their theory.
---
I could care less how you play, the mechanics that allowed risk free in null sec didn't belong there. That's my point. You're an idiot for missing that.
---
So how come the player count is down 5-10K accounts at peak time depending on the day? If the same number of people returned as quit why are the player and activity numbers falling off a cliff?
---
maybe even below
---
You are fake news.
---
Math checks out
---
and yet they don't seem nearly as upset as you do about the thing. Kinda weird but 
---
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Under rated comment
---
I wish you guys would all just come to lowsec.
---
They can both be right, fyi.
---
the only embarrassing thing here is you double responding to the same post because you are in such a rush to shout someone down you couldn't bother to read their whole post before spamming a response.
---
We don't have supers.
---
Actually its 30,000. And if you looked at the player counts there is no single or double drop off that is recovered from, its a steady constantly downward falling of accounts logged in not the kind of thing you see cause by a pair of ban events.
---
200 people shouldn't be able to kill a Titan. Obviously this cyno change is garbage.
---
Thank you
---
You fail to account for players who never left the system and players that don't log in.
---
based on the amount of defensive posts by the OP its either bait, or they really are dumb enough to believe what they posted.
---
I was there™. It was the first I popped a cyno on my Erebus (and presumably the last).
---
Time will tell. But at least I'm not being a whiny bitch like half of Eve right now.
---
Yeah I ran 2 sites and was not impressed.
---
Imagine changing your flair for this. Lol
---
So is posting about them online, but here we all are.
---
- Fitting Cynos to Corvettes was cheating, and everyone knows it. Everybody LOVES to shout that slogan "Risk vs Reward" when it suits them. But how do you justify using an absolutely disposable Corvette to light Cynos so an entire fleet of Capital ships can swoop in.
---
- Indys are cheap as hell. It's not like you NEED to fit an Indy Cyno onto another Capital just to get your JF around. If you had to buy and fit a Titan to keep your hauling business going, I could understand the tears. But if you can't afford less than 500k for an Indy to light your way, then maybe you shouldn't be flying around an expensive JF in the first place. Sounds like you suck at making money.
---
No no no, you see, this won't free up space, because :reasons: and :hotdrops: and stuff.
---
You couldn’t live with your failure and where did that bring you? Back to me.
---
"it's just bots" will continue until the last idiot saying it is the only one left, and then when there's fuck all to do in game, he'll biomass irl because he realises if he just quits, he too must be a bot.
---
* Fuck blackout! We're all unsubbing!
---
* Cool, empty space to be taken by fresh blood.
---
* No, that's not gonna happen, cuz we won't let you! We'll blob you to death!
---
Ok?
---
Don't get me wrong, i'm not nearly as upset about anything as you seem to perceive me. I just dislike cheaters and i applaude how this one was dealt with. The only thing i'm upset about is myself because i seemingly overestimated those bee guys and he was dealt with for the wrong reasons. That's really all there is to it.
---
New colorblind mode
---
With Second Galaxy being released + WOW classic along with some very radical game mechanic changes, it was only ever going to lead to this. 
---
Perhaps the game will bounce back, but I suspect at this rate the game will be gone within the next 12 - 18 months.
---
You see, CCP believes that if all that remains is multi-boxers, bots, and edgelords, it will make it better for new players.
---
"  Wanna earn steady income via ratting? Go to belts.  " No one is going to risk their ratting ship to diamond rats randomly warping in and killing them, they already have that issue with cloaky hunteres
---
&gt;The movie also foreshadowed that hes going to have a life of PTSD and suicide issues after. Just like the Trumpet player. What i got from it was that, greatness has a cost, however EVE isn't the drummer in this story, its the Trumpet player thats attempting to off itself.
---
Yeah and the stratios should be unable to fit a cloak of any kind, get a 97% penalty to shield and armour HP, a 500% agility decrease and a 25000m signature radius increase. Maybe have a 25m³ drone bay and only be able to fit polarised weapons too.
---
Long live the Gila.
---
Why not?
---
With the amount of slide I'd be surprised if it lasted into January
---
Because devoting a character to cyno/pvp means less iskies for their toonies
---
No u
---
No no it has nothing to do with *thaaaat*.... ~spinspinspin~
---
thank god CCP made sure to keep all the bots moving to highsec to run courier missions safe from people trying to screw with them.
---
yes, mittens is playing 12th dimensional chess

Can't give free kills if cycle times are lowered.
---
Applied ingame thx for vouch.
---
Clearly even with the spy alt you don't read the pings. We'll leave it at that. And ya, why not drop that hammer on people that cannot listen. Setting the example.
---
Adapted like I said. They moved out of null. You’re arguing now about something clear as day. Do you ever shut the fuck up? Or are you just as much of a dick ass in real life?
---
Not as long as homicide is an option, anyway.
---
In the beginning what is?  But what is better, when CCP tells you how to play the game or when players figure out how to play the game?  These changes don't enhance the sandbox, it narrows the square footage we get to play in.
---
Yea, just wish my buddy captured that second dread pop in the clip
---
&gt;Second Galaxy 
---
  
---
I too, have warm holes in my solor system.
---
hahahaha no.
---
I mean to be fair, if you don't have a job, it's the best option. Your time isn't worth squat without someone willing to pay for it
---
The appeal of Classic isn't about the tedium, though the raw size of the world relative to your mobility is part of the "feel" of the game. It's more about how the game treats the player in general.
---
The biggest difference is that the modern WoW is basically an on-rails scripted experience. There might be a dozen different stories/rides at this theme park, but once you get in the cart you're on the track visiting each carefully placed set-piece on the map. The story writing is fine I guess, but the game essentially plays itself.
---
By contrast Classic WoW feels more like an authentic world that you just happen to be in.
---
They could add in a few QoL features like fast-travel between cities at max level and it would still be Classic WoW without losing the experience.
---
And r/eve based throwing him under the bus on CCP's statement that everyone assumed was based on actual proof from an actual investigation.
---
That doesn't change my point. And I wasn't disagreeing with you on the whole, merely pointing out that a good part of the reason why wormholers kill more on average is because we fly blingier shit.
---
Nope just pointing about that this thread is bullshit.
---
Yes I am a massive pompus rich arsehole who made a small fortune from playing EVE :P
---
Hey, i'm one of those lol
---
Only if we get to build using POS Mod mechanics
---
I mean, plenty of people had reservations about how CCP handled things and plenty of people pointed out how CCP had clearly not done a full investigation, and r/eve was happy to chuck them busward all the same. So maybe this is just a terrible place.
---
Considering that Innominate had **just come back** from the CSM Summit where CCP reviewed the upcoming changes that the rest of us haven't heard about yet, I think that "yikes" is putting it mildly. What fresh hell will tomorrow bring?

Also DON'T pay attention to my weapon cycling please. I am a F1 Monkey ... F1 - F3 is just not the same :(
---
i'm sure they can field more, but there will be 400 of them that can actually do it, and probably another 300-500 getting killed trying to do it.
---
&gt;It is called chaos era because it makes people feel like they’re “dangerous” which is hilmars marketing.
---
In fairness, fitting a cyno and afk-ratting in pretty much perfect safety under the umbrella of a standing capital fleet was a bit problematic.
---
The bigger issue is that they're trying to solve a relatively minor "problem" by kicking everyone in the dick.
---
PL's general lifestyle won't change, we can afford to jump through the hoop and put our cyno alt in a Falcon instead of a frigate. It's just going to be a major pain in the ass for people who miss the main move-ops and want to catch-up solo.
---
" If you do not like what CCP is doing with this game then please do us all a favour and uninstall the game and stop playing it. " 
---
They are, why do you think the player count is down up to 10 thousand accounts at peak times and still falling? People are leaving, and it isn't just for WoW either, CCP really fucked the pooch this time
---
Yeah but we also have more kills per capita too. Exo talked about it at his presentation last year.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/evejobs/
---
No one knew that a dev jumped the gun and took people's word as proof until almost a week after the ban announcement. That was when CCP issued their second statement  saying they would investigate the issue and see if what they had done was the right thing. Up until right then the popular opinion on reddit was "they wouldn't do something like this unless they had proof and they were sure" Then it came out they didn't have proof, they never investigated and they had no clue what had actually happened.
---
Now you're making me think twice about laser surgery
---
No it fucking doesnt. It's the awe of seeing that something like that is possible, a day one noobie can join karma fleet or brave and jump into these fights within a few hours. These cyno changes means no fights like that will happen agian. Possibly ever seeing as how eve has lost almost 20k players in the last month. People dont want tedious bullshit.
---
I FUCKIN KNEW IT
---
 The red indicates people angry about ~~the cyno~~ change. 
---
Fixed that for you
---
Oh look a Goon sticking up for another Goon. Puppets unite.
---
Good, I hope EVE dies the firey death it deserves. Too many nerfs in the wrong direction. I've found other games to invest my time in. As a bitter vet, I shall enjoy watching this downward slope.
---
Don't waste your time, EVE is dying!
---
&gt;10,000 active players
---
You mean active accounts. Number of players is unknown except to CCP. Also, it's rather clear you *want* the game to die and only see what you want to see. While you cry out that eve is about to go under 10k, the lowest point has been 13.803 and is going back up, as clearly visible on eve-offline. You're off by about 30+% from your desired outcome and somehow surprised there's less activity right after notable changes that require time to let things carry on again.
---
yes this would be awesome,or  use  exsisting parts to construct your citadel/refinery/engineering complex in real time...like base building in no mans sky.. each part would not only have hitpoints but role,if someone decide to make  pos with astrahus size it would  make fun.. 
---
you buy or mine asteroids
---
reprocess them to get right minerals
---
now you anchor the cnstruction module and then you  spend your minerals on base arts.. so  you need to build walls roof and floors and defenses. complexity of base would allow player to build from scratch docking array for subcaps/caps/supers and titans  - rip maila keeepstar... your very own structure would have no reinforcement cycle of any kind,but  alot of HP both shield armor hull. 
---
how would process start?? easy.. once u  launched construction array into space  you have to build   lets say  reactor and then fuel it,then storage hangars docking hangars,tethering array. weapons and other stuff like reprocessing facility.. to go hardcore mode  structure modules are modules placed outside dock soooo you fill your freighter,undock it then manual fly to reprocessing array,then with processed materials you fly to factory where you craft   structure components to make your base bigger.  lets call  it modular citadels or FOB's
---
You're not wrong, the slope continues down to 0 at least once every single day and has been for the past 15 years.
---
Dead gaem
---
Free Shkreli
---
Guess what CCP has to give EVE comunity proof beyond a reasonable doubt that they are actually banning somebody because what i see is a lot of propaganda from CCP talking about thousands of bans but not a list of banned toons. Meanwhile i still seeing the same old bots still in the game, with different ship or in different places.

Yeah the end of the NIP was cut short by them anchoring shit in Tenerifis a few weeks early and killing FI.RE shit.  And was then summarily dismissing test diplomacy for a renewed content nip.   Frat agreed to a cease fire but swore to wipe test off the map.  They have an utter hatred for us.  We could have coexisted having conflict without that vengeance, in the same way imperium and legacy engage each other.
---
The only idiots are the kids memeing the "it's just bots" straw man.
---
Serious question, if you guys, as you've announced in tweets, twitch streams, and 1498023 Reddit threads, why do you need to remind us every day?  What happened to the Goons that used to just bask in the smug satisfaction of their ultimate goal achieved (ruining our game ect ect)?
---
I feel like all your posting is just trying to convince yourselves.
---
boy you fell for that flair bait hard.
---
I prefer my penguins less irritated
---
I feel like you have confused yourself at some point
---
Their motto is literally about ruining the game, and SOMEHOW people are surprised when it happens. Biggest of thinks
---
honk honk clown world
---
We are calling attention to bad game design and a crashing player base. Sounds like you are the one who wants eve to die
---
You break the rules we break your tools!
---
that box was long opened with the t3chan incident
---
&gt;thing about the whole thing was that we noticed him broadcasting (or a disfunctional bot. 4 rorqs paniced at the exact same time, 2 not at all despite being in range for whatever reason) then getting chased away from the remain
---
Dysfunctional bots are often, but not always, humans who can't do shit as perfectly as a bot can. Just saying
---
Why do you think so many people are moving into wormholes?
---
This is the same person that said

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d0hzzj/august_mer/ezhff0c/ 
---
&gt;Except that's not what they said, it was stated that super caps should not beable to engage subcaps. So that logically means a noob ship should beable to take on a super.
---
Their logic know no bounds
---
&gt;What happened to the Goons that used to just bask in the smug satisfaction of their ultimate goal achieved (ruining our game ect ect)?
---
... Maybe I'm too new around here but when were Goons ever not smugposting broken records? Like the only GSF posts I've ever seen are either smugposting or hilarious first-world-problems complaints.
---
You can point to false interpretations of your graphs and your opinion that 50% is nearly 20%. That’s all I got from you. Thanks for trying though.
---
but that's not what he said
---
Good CCP finally putting this sorry shit down for good
---
If you pay me a deposit for the price of a recon upfront I'll send an alt to cyno you to anything your in range for... if the ship doesnt die... ill give you the deposit back... message me your ingame name if interested
---
No ticket.
---
Typical Tapi, signing a NIP with everyone near them lmao
---
This war is good for the game, i hope it doesnt end soon, its the only thing happening in this game.
---
Exactly. I don't deny that wormholers on the whole commit to more PvP, I'm merely pointing out that part of the statistic you cite, kill value per capita, is due to the relative expense of wormhole fits.
---
Possible. Maybe it was Mr. Magicfinger that could tab through 4 clients and panic them in the exact same moment but forgot 2 of them and didn't notice they got shot at. I find that version rather hard to believe though.
---
Cool story bro, You are still wrong...

Stopped playing due to less time in RL, don't think I'll come back just from reading the current changes.

No, you can't have my stuff, I'll be buried with it.
---
They're not really smug posting here though are they, they're just chicken little posting at this point 'THE GAME IS DYING' every day.
---
Sorry but what i see at "security blog" isn't much more than propaganda until they give a list of banned characters. Honestly i can't be sure that they aren't banning all bots but i'm sure at least they aren't banning the bots i know and i can't find a reasonable explanation for this, can you?
---
Pretty sure frat signed it too
---
No. Haulers can't light cynos. read the patch notes again.

Downvote brigading only happens when the subject is deemed impacting enough, why would people bother downvoting something they feel will never happen.
---
hmmm, as much as I think its in a bad spot right now, were they though?
---
that was also one of his 'brilliant' ideas from the post tho. As if they weren't cancer when 2 groups could form up to 300 of them, now that EVERY group can form 500+, surely they will be less broken. Falcon doesn't have the slightest clue what the fuck he's talking about when it comes to capital ships, that much was very clear.
---
Please biomass your reddit account.
---
Oh so you do speak human
---
Big agree.
---
titan fucked?
---
tl;dr
---
Because we don't believe the game is dead. Yet. Eve is a game we love and we see that CCP has made decisions which have led to an alarming crash in player activity. We are making noise in the hopes that it will lead to CCP pulling the game out of this nose-dive.
---
They used to not post on reddit (and thus arguably didn't smugpost), but after WWB they realized it was important to control the narrative.
---
eve is a boomer game
---
EVE is so dead I will continue to remind all of you about this ~indisputable fact~ daily on reddit!
---
People will use wormholes more as connections to get from area to area
---
Yeah the impact on just moving a capital is fucking OUTTTLANDISH... Good luck with that shit...(Wish me luck with that shit)
---
&gt; What happened to the Goons that used to just bask in the smug satisfaction of their ultimate goal achieved (ruining our game ect ect)?
---
CCP is getting the final blow on the kill report, not goons. That's deeply bothersome to us.
---
Here's my understanding. (Note that it is very difficult to actually *test* this behavior.)
---
As long as nobody on the static side warps to it, the new static's sig does not appear on the exit side. Corp-mates of mine have verified that wormhole signatures can last for multiple days in this state.
---
Once somebody on the static side warps to it, the static wormhole's lifetime starts counting down. This does not immediately spawn the sig on the exit side, but there's an increasing chance that it will spawn on its own from this point forward.
---
Once somebody on the static side jumps the wormhole, the sig on the exit side spawns immediately.
---
Cool edge case: A drifter roaming around the exit system can warp to the unspawned sig, and players in the exit system can combat scan the drifter and thus find the wormhole. This still doesn't spawn the sig, nor is the sig spawned by a player jumping through from the exit side (although I'm sure this starts the countdown).
---
Nullsec 2019 in a nutshell. And 2018. And 2017. And...

This... this right here. CCP should hire this guy. He'll save Hilmar's bonus from PA.

---
I mean you could either spend an hour burning a toon or 3 hours scanning holes looking for connections so pick your poison. also, the amount of scanning you have to do goes up exponentially the more cynos you have to burn. Wormholes already offered a shortcut pre-cyno changes.. The reason people don't typically use them is because it's not time efficient.
---
And it’s not like he’s going to he using it, since he’s quitting

No eves player base is dropping like a stone and will be unrecoverable unless people wake the fuck up and realize making a game more tedious is not the way to make a game successful

Umbrella is perhaps an inaccurate statement, but generally speaking many smaller pvp-focused groups in nullsec will have a small (often hyperspatialed) superfleet, or at bare minimum a (proportionally) sizeable number of Dreadnoughts for dealing with hostile rorquals or supercaps they may tackle. Using them is now an incredible chore. 
---
Additionally, speaking as a member of the ultra small minority of capital pilots who routinely fly solo, it now requires a minimum of 3 dedicated characters for me to light a fast cyno efficiently, rather than just 1. This is incredibly bad for anyone like me. Prior to this I could simply hunt with a solo interceptor or sabre and find hostiles, and kill them with whatever I liked. Now to kill with the same speed, I require not only my tackle, but also a stealth bomber/covops frig trailing, another toon in a blops, and another toon in an arazu to produce the same effect I could get from just the ceptor before. Additionally I can no longer smartbomb my incyno to death to prevent every local in the system from warping directly on top of my supercarrier. Thank you CCP.
---
Yea well I had to turn off my 15 bots
---
did you really not know that theta doesn't care what people do with their spaceship game? it seems right and good to cull the herd they've amassed
---
Reeeee?
---
You forgot that industrial cynos use 800 LO base now, which means even with cyno V, you are unable to use a sub2s ceptor to fit LO, cynos in cargo (can no longer fit on ships), and a compressed-ore industrial.   
---
You can only fit LO + cyno in the ares and remain sub 2s.
---
Thanks.  The rest I don't care about but this was a dick move.  It was 500 LO on Sisi in late August, then it changed and no one noticed.
---
Not the people saying”good the bots are leaving” seriously???
---
Semantics... Less = fewer
---
Which graph shows that 50% drop?
---
Adding to the fact that you can create folders in the neocom, but there's just not enough menu options to make good use of it

Don’t worry it’s just bots

And whatever you do don’t look at highest activity that’s always been there or something.
---
Hilmar can suck the fattest part of my ass for doing so much damage to the game i’ve loves for so long.  
---
If he gave ANY fucks about “chaos” he’d make things more balanced not trying to make specific types of players quit for no fucking reason and ensuring there won’t be any new powers to be.
---
I won’t change my mind.  The dude needs to lose his career for the amount of fail he’s brought to games and EVERY GAME he touched does with the “we know best” ego trip that never fucking works
---
And never will.

so was this thread...

Well tbf, the wanted to just stop at covert cynos and then the jump freighter pilots complained and complained for an industrial cyno.

My question to people like you is this: At what point does this graph start concerning you? Will you still be chanting everything is fine if PCU hits 15k? 10k?

“feed ratting ships until you’re broke”. Is retarded and you’re a coward

Imagine if they nerfed cloaking modules.

There’s a reason it hasn’t happened, your kind would probably be on suicide watch irl if it ever happened

What space are you scanning? I'm 10 days old and I've been finding Wormholes to J space in quiet systems around Jita, I usually only have to go 1 or 2 WH deep to be in a system with ~15 Signatures to scan down.

Take it up with dotlan then... it’s their stats. You on the other hand just push false propaganda. Shameful. Leave the game if you don’t like it. Why don’t you do that? Follow your own words like the 50% of others who already left. LOL

It wasn’t safety.  You could be shot any time.  It wasn’t safe enough for the hunters to kill people without dying

But i am quite serious in this endeavor.
---
Seems like a Simple Eve copy tbh
---
It’s the natural result of the super umbrella.  If a roaming fleet can’t hide from defenders it will die to the defenders with nothing to show for it.  Now we have cloaky fleets because anything else get rekt by supers.
---
30k - 14k = more than a 50% drop, so good math skills :)
---
The stats are not wrong, just the fucking idiot who has decided to interpret them..

I already stopped playing and sold all my isk. ;)

Have you meet our good friend the super umbrella?  No big alliance uses anything else to defend their ratters.

Look on the brightside, it's still over 9000

If he wants to sink eve on his way out, I hope his career sinks and the bonus gone with it.

Right, you’re the idiot. Good call on that one, Mr. Fifty Percent.

Nah we would've seen a new npc type in the files.
---
I feel like going on a show that a couple thousand players watch and saying "CCP is trying to kill eve" isn't going to get that done, though I'm sure you're going to get the stink eye next time you all meet, that kind of shit really bothers them and they can be vindictive.
---
“3 hours” 🤣
---
If you’re going to exaggerate, at leads pick a believable amount of time
---
You're crying on Reddit that the "difficult and unforgiving" game you likely brag about playing is *actually* becoming difficult and unforgiving again.
---
I'm adapting just fine, the game isn't though haha
---
sorry, I saw some typos that i wanted to fix then got distracted doing homework.   
---
I agree with the cyno changes as a whole however JF's got miffed really hard by this. considering that's what haulers do for a living. I've lit 40+ cynos in a day before and imagine if i lost half of them and had to replace them because none of them dropped.   
---
The price of the cyno is not the issue. people don't consider the size of the industrials (20k m3). JF's typically carry extra ozone and cyno generators as replacements for when one of your mid cynos inevitably dies. you still need to make the return trip so you just toss your alt some ozone and a cyno to fit on a rookie ship. Now we need to carry the replacement indy cyno ships and given that the average JF cargo hold is 350k m3 you are limited due to ship replacements vs range vs container size. For example some of our routes could take us 7 mids one way (14 round trip) imagine if it was a really bad day and you lost all your cynos. you could only fit 17 replacements  @340k m3 but with the rest of the space you could haul a package 10k m3. IDK about you but i'd rather just biomass at that point.
---
Alright, then. Let's remove botting from the EULA. While we're at it, throw in a battle royale mode, remove death permeance, and censor the game to comply with China's bonkers laws so EVE can be operated in that market. After all, the only thing that matters is having the highest possible player count...right?
---
Holy fuck goons just fuck off already.

I wonder if JF pilots and everyone ree'ing about this doesn't understand why JFs jumping to covert cynos is broken as fuck, or if they do and think everyone else is stupid enough to not see
---
Yes, all well and good, but when its just yall left then what? Quit eve? Game isnt much fun without conflict
---
bad bot
---
First one done. Took about 20 runs back to base to rep.  
---
The trigs in these do therm/explosive damage, and seem to be most vulnerable to thermal.
---
Best I've come up with so far, with the Drake Navy Issue, is to map all 7 HAM launchers with infernos to one button, warp in and align to a local friendly raitaru while waiting for targeting to lock, nuke one or two trigs, and warp out. Worked on the first site, and is working well on the second site.
---
JF getting paid shit? Raise your rates. Too many jumps? Move closer to a trade hub. Masking the fact you wanted completely risk free logistics movements and complaining?  Adapt or die.
---
As i see it it's you the one believing CCP is banning bots with no evidence, forgive me if you have any EVIDENCE and notice that evidence doesn't implies void propaganda about thousands of bots banned.
---
Just keep telling yourself that. I'm sure someday it will be true.
---
You think they'll ever stop thinking they're the only players that matter?
---
He probably launched it himself
---
They probably saw a bubble that was left by a dictor that warped off shortly before they arrived, and it just looked like a rat dropped it as they loaded grid
---
If you think it's all bots that are leaving the game, you're an idiot.
---
ah yes you were only pretending to be retarded, bill! you sure fooled us!!
---
I'm curious what you think is so broken about it?
---
Seemed like an interesting change to me
---
Okay, so your response is that CCP is involved in a conspiracy, and despite releasing reports saying they are banning bots, they aren't.
---
But still with no evidence?

He answered you. Now you can't say it wasn't answered. Agree with him 100%
---
Lots and lots of salt from the "elite" nullblocs on this board. Makes you wonder why they're the loudest loudmouths on this sub.
---
Whoa, take it easy Satan.  POS UI was godawful, if that were improved I might actually miss POSs.
---
Cool. And CCP has a very large backlog of reports to go through. You're still bitching about not getting instant gratification.
---
Yes.         
---
Yes they were.
---
Uh huh. 
---
And the only reason rorqs mine less is because rorq pilots wanted better prices for their ore. 
---
No mass limits on wormholes when? Lets spread the chaos rather than just fuck over pve players. Pvp players don't want chaos on their end though, and the second something is tried the amount of tears about it will be legendary. Also upvoted.
---
Well, it was Darkness so this is long overdue.
---
It’s like every-time we attempt to snag a rorq in delve. 
---
We land in belt, tackling 4 rorqs. Set down cyno inhib, but cyno immediately goes up.
---
Suddenly our 30 character destroyer fleet is dropped by an equal number of super capitals and faxes. 
---
In the end we’re still isk positive because goons are bad and feed a couple subs, and their sabre pilots can’t even bubble properly, and all their dd’s miss
---
What are you using for multi boxing there?  The PiP?
---
You think if the player count dwindles down to you two they will keep the servers up?
---
Ability to move JFs risk free. Light covert cynos in deep safes with no local to even indicate someone is in system
---
If we thought we were the only players that mattered we would embrace this change because we have the infrastructure to deal with these changes while the rest of eve doesnt. This is bad for the whole game. Take off the blinders
---
The narrative is strong with this one.
---
That's not 100% risk free
---
But yeah, I considered that a buff.
---
But also, how often is it in the nullsec jump points that JFs get caught anyway?
---
Pretty sure it's almost always the final lowsec system
---
saying strawman seems to be the new "REEEEE" for the CCP defender crowd these last few days.

Or.. just get rid of cynos entirely.

Nobody sane thinks CCP is _trying_ to kill Eve. I think they're making a mistake and being too slow to react.

If the price of helping to get CCP to save the game is a bad CSM summit I'm okay with that. If everything continues in the direction it's going, it doesn't matter.

---
TL;DR version
---
Relatively impartial assessment: Years of catering to a single playstyle has driven out players who did things differently but were also needed for an equilibrium to exist. The game has been in a gradual, slow but steady decline for years due to this lack of balance. Changing things now is risky, because over the years most active players have either been assimilated by the dominant playstyle (if they were veterans) or simply recruited right into it as rookies. The people who are needed to revive the marginalized playstyles may or may not come back with the new changes. Some of the current playerbase who is part of the dominant playstyle may leave as well. So it's definitely risky.
---
Personal opinion: If you suffer from a disease that carries a death sentence anyway, it's better to try a risky experimental treatment than do nothing at all and wait to die. CCP's changes may or may not kill the game. But not changing anything would also kill the game, slowly but surely, through stagnation and boredom. The players also have part of the responsibility, by min-maxing broken design decisions to a very high degree and doing their best to contribute to the onset of stagnation. Just one example among many, if people could undock a few kitchen sink subcaps to respond to threats and give some fights, instead of dropping caps on roaming frigates to discourage any sort of conflict apart from massive strat ops, maybe CCP wouldn't feel compelled to nerf the hell out of their toys after a few years.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Long version
---
Sure, there's a problem, but it's not only CCP's fault. The playerbase fucked their own selves over the years, by exploiting to the maximum possible degree certain CCP design decisions that catered to a "bigger is better" meta in almost every aspect of the game. In other words, the decline has been long and gradual for various playstyles. Now that the playstyle that's been heavily catered to for years is getting it's own swing of the nerfbat, and rightly so, the negativity is more pronounced simply because a lot of the remaining player base has gravitated to it.
---
Imagine taking turns nerfing 10 distinct playstyles as you rebalance your game over time. Assuming roughly equal distribution of players among them (just to make things easy), you piss off roughly 10% of your playerbase with each balance pass.
---
Now imagine nerfing and buffing in a way that makes a single playstyle dominant to all others. The new players learn that this is the optimal way to play the game. The old players either get assimilated into it, or leave. So, after a few years the majority of your playerbase will be part of that playstyle. If you now try to fix things and nerf it back into balance (because it makes the game economy unsustainable), you piss off a much higher percentage of your players, because a lot of them don't even realize there are other ways to play the game. It's a hammer and anvil situation.
---
So yes, there's a problem. But no, continuing as we were does not make for a healthy game either, just for a boring, stagnant game with a slower declining (but still steadily declining) player count.
---
Plus, player count is not the only important number. One measure of how attractive and engaging a game is to play is "things happening in the game world", and that is roughly (number of players) \* (average activity level of each player). So, activity levels are equally if not more important that PCU. In other words, a guy who is afk or not even logged in and waits for pings in discord is not the same as a guy out in space. The first is a player who waits for things to happen, the other is a player who makes things happen or at least makes himself available for things to happen around/to him. You can have 5000 active players that generate as much, if not more, content (in a general sense, not just pvp) as 10000 afk,alt-tabbed ping warriors.
---
Of course, numbers are still needed because geography and player density matters too (eg, you can't fill the map with 2000 players even if they are super active). But above a certain minimum player count, the point is pretty much moot because in the case of very low activity players or players who successfully avoid all interaction with others, in terms of "things happening in the game world" they are pretty much equivalent to and contribute the same as someone who is not even logged in (ie, nothing to a little).
---
The way it looks to me is that the slower-paced empire building and capital heavy playstyle became too prevalent over the years, so the majority of activity-based players either stopped playing gradually, or got assimilated by the blob. And the playstyle mostly associated with high activity levels and high short-term engagement (even if it is in bursts, simply because it's exhausting to play this way continuously) is medium/small scale pvp and micro gang. In other words, a lot of people who could comfortably fight outnumbered 3 to 1 in smaller ships than their enemies have left the game, resulting in quite a bit of skill drain (how do you think people learn to FC competently? small gang is where it's at).
---
But the main problem with them leaving is that the game by its core design is an ecosystem and not a theme park. You need multiple playstyles for it to keep working, so that they can feed off of each other. For example, we all know hunters need krabs for targets. But krabs also need hunters, to keep the market going and the value of isk healthy through destruction. Without hunters and destruction, there is no reason for industry and no value to isk. To have the same buying power you get by multiboxing 2 rorqs today you would need 5 rorqs a few months down the line, because mineral prices keep crashing.
---
So over the years the meta game and the players have pushed out of the equation these "raiding space barbarians" type of groups who were
---
1. Responsible for destruction disproportionate to their numbers and isk value (most hardcore small gang groups could punch way above their weight and maintained high efficiency) and consequently driving a need for renewal of resources and commodities (ships, modules, etc).
---
2. Keeping large alliances in check, by making them unable to effectively police large swaths of space against smaller, highly mobile but hard hitting groups (there's a reason HACs were a thing for roamers long before they became doctrine ships for F1 fleets).
---
Add to the above that it's now possible for a few regions to support thousands of players and massive capital construction through endless anomalies and economies of scale (eg, multiboxing rorqs) and the economy starts to suffer heavily. And just like that, plex prices rise, isk is devalued heavily and over time every player needs to grind longer than before despite making more isk, as we enter the age of the turtling meta and "pretend enemies". An age where supposedly hostile groups have a bunch of different agreements ranging from what is ok to shoot with what or which systems are ok to deploy in and where it's ok to drop a staging cit, all the way to resource sharing (the OTEC circus a few years ago, or the perimeter keepstar situation today).
---
After years and years of this, CCP realized that it simply leads to not enough interesting stuff going down in the game and making things boring for everyone. So they now try to reverse the trend. The problem is that they have catered to a single playstyle for so long, that they have driven out a large part of the people who did things differently and are the target audience for these changes.
---
It's unclear if proponents of the other marginalized playstyles will come back, so it's a risky bet. I know quite a few return, the issue is if they are enough to rejuvenate the stale meta we are currently slogging through, especially in the face of the entrenched and stubborn resistance of the established "status quo is king" crowd.
---
Personally, i think it's still better than doing nothing and waiting for the entire game to simply fizzle into non-existence for lack of meaningful things to do. Let's hope it works.
---
Just send him a bag of dicks in the mail, and then move on.
---
ah yep that makes perfect sense, probably what happened
---
is there tldr for the tldr? the tldr is still to long
---
Or stop giving a fuck about the autists, take the money and leave. Good for him.
---
I rate this spin post 5/10. Definitely better than bashful morale posts that Elo or someone from his team produces after each bigger action, or lack thereof.
---
But still bellow proper fully spin in kinds of "didn't even wanted that systems anyway". On the other hand, your situation isn't terrible, so there may be no need for that, but simply trying to sell "not winning fast enough" as losing, well, let's just say that I've seen better morale posts in this game.
---
Keep working, and maybe, one day, you will be able to spin as good as legendary spin masters.
---
&gt;why are you splitting DPS, the FC asks

---
The average age of Eve's playerbase is 67
---
It doesn't work for eve either
---
tbh you just post a lot, and i post a lot, so its natural our posts cross.
---
I lived out of a pos for almost 2 years. It was awesome.
---
Yes.
---
Here's a fun thing to think about. 50k players in delve. They just up and quit! What a fucking gas! Haha great fun being a dick bag and wanting them to quit, ya know?
---
Smedly's more competent, by a lot (still not saying much).
---
So instead of fixing sov mechanics or adding defensive structures that would make it easier for smaller alliances to defend their space the answer is just nuke the game?
---
You can implement all the risky mechanics you want but have the intellectual honesty to admit when it's not working.
---
Having the lowest number of players since 2005 means it's not fucking working
---
I log in every day...to firesell my shit so if I want to come back it's not a logistical nightmare.
---
Still, I hope EvE doesn't die. I've got mad isk so I can come back some day maybe...
---
Ran a couple of these today in a blingy Tengu and AC Hurricane, not too difficult.  Had to warp out to rep up twice with the 'cane but no problems otherwise.  Just follow the usual trig target priority.  First site dropped a damage control multiplasmid, second nothing of value.
---
Last couple of days I've been hunting trig recons, after the patch today it seems the loot/salvage table was tuned down a bit and it takes twice as long to salvage a group with drones.
---
That's like 90% of wormhole/cloaked flairs.
---
Because they're the ones actually, you know, living in 0.0 space? Not "I don't own space, and owning space is hard, so boost for us" up there. But as stated by someone else up there, it only works because you don't own space in any real sense or hide in Solitude. Any small alliances that try to exist out in 0.0 and hold space are going to have a harder time than the bigger alliances. 
---
Who do you think they are also having fun shooting more now? Smaller alliances. What's funny is a lot of people running their mouths about how great this is don't actually own any space.
---
they can light an industrial cyno, which blops can jump (and presumably bridge) to?
---
Actually It will be worse now.
---
Imagine trying to break 250 man slowcat fleet in every fight lol
---
Slowcat was already cancer when there was very few caps.

I probably would have been happier with this fit if it had 2 empty low slots.
---
&gt; Anyone on here play on Mac and find something that works?
---
Yeah,  PLAY THE GAME FFS.
---
Did you not see the "Please do not shoot, I am an industrial" sign?
---
The playerbase...
---
Yeah it was just a thought. Sometimes I run distribution missions on autopilot while I do homework
---
this goes into the 'things newbros say' folder
---
High sec mining 2 jumps from the Caldari starter system.
---
It's picking back up after moving to Goons. I had my doubts about it, but so far so good actually
---
Just loggin in for the night and indeed 13k... The drama!
---
&gt; he can jump into a hauler from the sma of the rorqual 
---
2 more steps later:
---
&gt; bridges in recon normal cyno up
---
Or put the recon in the sma. Which, is ofc when you find out the only guy with recons trained doesn't have cyno trained.
---
Got a link to that post? Sounds like a good read.
---
You are, but you are doing it selectively and in a disingenuous manner.
---
You are in a part of the playerbase that is also partly responsible for all this, by helping make a single playstyle dominant over all others in the game, driving out players of differing playstyles in the process. I would be more inclined to sympathize with your viewpoint if you also called attention to that contribution to the current situation as well, instead of pretending that the slope is a recent, 2-3 month old occurrence.
---
Sure, it's more pronounced now, but it's been happening for years.
---
P.S I like the plural in your OP. Who's "we"? Is this a concentrated propaganda effort or just a perfectly tuned hive mind that posts one of these threads every few hours?
---
Definitely, nothing stopping them like the many other services Ive seen discontinued. A small part of me rather see them pull the plug rather than let the game die a slow death. (If ever)
---
If everyone is telling you you're misrepresenting their arguments, you probably have a hard time properly representing people's arguments.
---
You guys popped into delve right? Did you just leave again immediately?
---
Show me where I said I wanted 50,000 people to quit the game. I'll wait.
---
Exactly. People just "magically" (blackout, no cyno) finding more to kill. Until their subs run out.... Imagine my shock.
---
Watching EVE has taught me one thing. You either evaporate and leave to play some other game or you sit around basking in the ever increasing concentration of salt.
---
Blah blah blah good salt please post more
---
It's fine y'all. These numbers were all planned at the bbq.
---
Yeah goons are the first large empire in eve, never in eve history has there been empires
---
I think You spelled Hornet ec-300's wrong...
---
LOL, within 100 of going to 12k.
---
Remove anything that could be used for out of game standings.  
---
At least delay other types of Intel related. 
---
Remove standings lists, remove ticker tags, and remove alliances.
---
Corp limit 100.
---
This is a rough way to force conflict.  Make diplomacy too hard.  Make the game smaller until it recovers a bit.
---
That was my first (maybe second) thought when I looked at it.
---
Then focus on your homework instead.
---
Why are you complaining? That's practically how your entire alliance came to be. I know, i fought the original goonfleet in Syndicate and it was a swarm of 200 corvettes and t1 frigs with webs and scramblers. It worked as intended and nobody complained. Maybe you just want things easy and whatever stage in the game you currently are to be better than other and harder to counter. Sorry, that's not how balance works.
---
See the other replies to you for a more in-depth explanation of why it should be possible for small ships to gang up and kill bigger ones.

Having 3 gun splits is NOT splitting DPS. This is for when you want to keep pressure on a target structure to keep timer paused but continue shooting at primary target.
---
Splitting DPS is when primary and secondary targets are called and people don't wait for FC command to shoot. This is an issue when you have a critical mass of firepower to volley someone off the field
---
and out of all 49 fit's they where all shit, the dp's was so dang low and the tank so thin, oh and dont get me started on how slow they where.
---
Well on average 1000 to 2000 people have been unsubbing and just vanishing from week to week.  These people are outside of the Imperium.  You don't want 50k people to quit, we don't like seeing a 56% reduction in the player base from last year.  
---
This reduction isn't from us sitting on someone's space porch and blowing the doors down.  We aren't deployed, but right now people are leaving more so than any other time in the game.
---
Nah i dont like that theyre lowering the difficulty for hunting in small ships which is stupid
---
It seems like what’s lacking is a basic understanding of promoting longevity and long term goals, at the expense of some short term numbers. Y’all throwing up player count numbers are worse than the day traders staring at every quarterly report. They’re trying to promote long term health, even if that costs them a couple bucks in the short term.
---
There's some random dude that vni and ishtar rats down in Paragon Soul. Nobody bothers to catch him because he's super paranoid about warping to safes and he keeps the ADMs up.
---
Big agree. Fuck blocs.  Up vote.
---
lol
---
inb4 all the botters have medical notes bewailing their newfound disabilities. 
---
I can forsee this hitting the news: "I wear coke bottle glasses and am considered legally blind by my local transportation ministry, so why is CCP discriminating against me by claiming I'm not blind *enough* to be given access to use their assistive technology that could help me?"
---
I don't think it would be wise to place CCP in the unfortunate position of evaluating the legitimacy of medical documentation.
---
Ok so your response to the question "do you have any EVIDENCE to believe CCP?" is... ...basicaly none. 
---
But still blaming the other side. Do you understand that it's you in the first place believing something without evidence and you are blaming others of exactly the same you do? Can't be more hilarious.
---
That health of the game argument falls apart the minute CCP makes changes based on zero community involvement and feedback.  You want to ignore facts and numbers but a game company doesn't stay in business based on your feelings.
---
Hundreds and hundreds not a few bombers or a handful of T3d being able to defang a super with no risk
---
Pearl Abyss wouldn't give two shits to be fair. This is me who played both games. (Eve and BDO)
---
yeah
---
I'm afraid of googling this... I might not be ready to find out! O.O
---
So you want it to be cruel and unforgiving... just for small ships. 
---
*Right*.
---
Love seeing nagas used. Beautiful ship lots of potential, hard to utilize.
---
31k average for the year. Don’t kid yourself, Eve is in a slump, but a serious drop in a few months due to several serious changes can be misleading. Some bots left. Some players aren’t logging in their alts. School has started. It’s a different game with a new system. It’ll take some adjustment, but I’m staying.
---
Games been so stagnant for so many years with the current playerbase, I don't see what the problem is if most of the blob is actually leaving.. good for EVE. Maybe we'll get some new guys that like to fite  spaceships.
---
Maybe not star citizen, but all those garbo spam mobile games will shrink it and use it as their logo/thumbnail in ads...
---
I didn't say you're the only ones. I specifically said "in a part of the playerbase".
---
You either didn't read carefully enough and missed it, or are twisting words on purpose to deflect a point that doesn't suit you.
---
Its funny because the highsec population plummets wherever Triglavian invasions go, people want their secure space to bear in. Adding instalocking insta-tackling frigates at gates that call backup if you attack back, that appears in 3 random systems constantly in highsec? Not the best of best ideas to keep that side of the playerbase, the passive income for CCP.
---
Truely the dumbest of shitposts
---
Funny at one point I thought about coming back but if it's going down that fast guess I've done everything worth doing in eve *shrug*
---
&gt;!ur gay pwnd!&lt;
---
numbers have dropped by 25% in the last month and are dropping even more.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure its fine though.
---
Do you know what a cascade is?
---
Umm. Let’s see. Last month average is 19k. Last few months before blackout was 22k average... real math says that’s 14% drop. The year was already declining before the blackout. 
---
Just saying. Depends how you want to interpret data.
---
Yes, it is true, it was never a question.
---
This will disgust a lot of people... but I just alt+tab. I'm on a single 17in laptop screen all stacked on top of each other with my alts on wl is all. No on top replica or anything
---
So what content do you create? Where are all the high sec fleets going into null sec for kills? Sounds like your the most risk adverse out of everyone
---
Tbh ccp has achieved peak salt from the eve neckbeards, tips fedora
---
AND FUCKING REPAIR THEM TOO
---
I am so incredibly tired by corp members putting overheated 57% damaged ships and modules in the fucking hangars always needing to drag them into my hangar, repair them and drag them back.
---
Back in the slashdot days, we'd vote this one up *+5 Insightful.*

Big brain

It also doesn’t stay in business by listening to the masses “Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups” -George Carlin
---
If they listened strictly to the player base on a one user gets one vote level, we’d have the most amazing mining and carrier ratting simulator in the existence of the world.
---
That's not an answer to my question, but alright.
---
It's called an analogy; everyone (except you, apparently) understands that this is a game and that things in a game are less important than their real life analogs. I shouldn't have to explain that to you.
---
While it may be more fun for YOU to have that "knife fight", it's certainly more fun for the other party to simply shoot you. If you aren't going to ask the other party what they want before charging in with your knife and trying to stab them, you should be prepared for the inevitable consequences that arise when they don't feel like a knife fight.
---
Analogy aside, if you actually want a fight, stop going after the ratters and miners. Attacking targets that can't feasibly fight back isn't going to get you a fight - it makes you a threat that needs to be exterminated. 
---
Gankers hiding behind the pretense of "wanting a fight" while doing nothing but ganking krabs and running from fights is getting REALLY old. People who are smart enough not to gank krabs in their own heavily fortified home territory never even SEE super umbrellas; if you got dropped by one you weren't "looking for a fight".
---
You need the clone bay access specifically. If you can dock there is kinda required too though.
---
I will wear that comment with honor
---
My point was that we have evidence, which you have chosen to disregard.
---
The simplest answer is to trust it because there is no reason to believe they would specifically lie about this. So without evidence to the contrary, that's what we have.
---
But sure, we have no reason to trust them. And no reason to not trust them.
---
Congratulations, you've brought us no where.
---
“Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups” -George Carlin
---
By your logic we’d have the most amazing ratting and mining simulator in existence, but nothing else.
---
We also live in a world where people are choosing not to vaccinate their kids, think the earth is flat, and are amazed smoking is bad for them. Society has shown their ability to know what’s best for themselves is limited.
---
Probably shouldn't come here looking for bitting help.
---
It's okay. Some people need a narrative so they can sleep better at night. Guy must not realize the Keepstar we planted in western Detorid allows bridging capability to **half** of said region, so it really didn't matter that we weren't able to anchor it in the system we originally planned for.  
---
In fact, I think I'll link a picture to help illustrate jump ranges for our friend above. He **clearly needs** it.

I'm sick of these frigate holes I keep finding.
---
Again, you are demostrating you are answering without even reading because post explains how CCP bans 2 alpha acounts in 1 week but bots reported 6 months ago still botting every day. Thanks for letting so clear how desperately must argue bot defenders.
---
You can wear it however you want princess
---
Jesus, just leave the god damn game already.
---
I didn't say the changes were the best possible. I said that at this point efforts towards change are better than lack of change.
---
But since you brought it up, i do have a list of things that might shift the meta in a more organic way, but you probably won't like them at all.
---
If it was up to me i would just nerf capitals across the board to get them in line with how the foundation of combat has worked in the game since forever: the bigger the ship class the harder it is to apply to smaller ships, if they gang up on you you're dead. If 2-3 BCs can kill a battleship, 2-3 battleships should be able to kill a carrier/dread in a similar amount of time. If 5 close range/high dps frigates can kill a battleship, 5 similarly fit BCs should be able to kill a cap in the same timeframe. And so on. Adjust mineral/construction cost for caps as needed to keep it balanced.
---
Follow that with adjusting citadel mechanics, nerf or simply delete asset safety and add sov objectives for smaller ships to give people a reason to undock in smaller stuff. Eg, roll in with a group of 10-30 HACs, shoot a station module for a few minutes and the enemy loses their cloning service or market, depending on what you targeted. To get it back online they can either put some logis on it, put some materials in to auto-repair faster (material/isk sink option), do both to repair it even faster, or do nothing and let it repair on its own (but much slower than all the other options). No timers, no entosis, no nothing. Just forces fights and enables people to put pressure without having to resort to the biggest possible ships all the time. This means people can't just drop citadels all over willy-nilly and have to shrink their area to what they can actually defend and have presence in. Also, hard limit of 1 structure per sun/planet/moon. Unsure about whether they should be anchorable on gates or not.
---
Counterbalance that by nerfing farmability and resource generation per region (infinite anoms, etc). It's very counterintuitive that the more you farm a system, the better bonuses you get. Maybe give higher isk per site to keep it worthwhile, but much longer respawn times and less sites total per system. This gives incentives to spread out for isk generation, but due to the previous mechanics (disabling station services and structure limits) you can't permanently hold territory that easily.
---
Overall,
---
increased need to move around space + reduced capability to hold a lot of territory = more conflict and more need to organise with your friends and do things as groups...but smaller groups across multiple systems and not always a single group of 1000 on a single grid, struggling with 1% TiDi.
---
Blops can jump to an industrial cyno, therefore it can bridge to it. So it will bridge a brick tank cyno recon, which lights the actual cyno, and then all the caps come through
---
Ah, you silly phone meme, you. Never change!
---
Just wanted to try throwing shit at the wall to see what would stick,  just like CCP and the rest of this community
---
This meme is almost as old as the movie.
---
How do you have a bunch of picture in picture on your screen then?
---
youre right, gankers running from fights is equally stupid. My point is that krabbing in nullsec should be an open invitation for knife fights. If you don't feel like knife fights, neither side should be there. You don't get to just nuke everything because you don't feel like small gang pvp and would rather just make isk undisturbed.
---
I mean pretty much every big null bloc has essentially just rolled with the punches. Mittani blustering aside, Its been "Aight. Business as usual with adaption."
---
Mind when you say that out loud some people... take exception to that. 
---
Imma bitch a bit so here goes:
---
Like take the blackout. To me that just adds too much risk to carrier rat, so I said I'm not going to do that. I'll just switch to subcap ratting. And I get shit on it by like two other people who's comment boiled down to "git gud" and "play with your fleet on grid." 
---
Sure. I'll rat in an anomaly with other people in my fleet on grid. /s
---
"Risk adverse!" like some kind of curse. How dare you minimize risk. Take your big ship out so I can blow it up! 
---
Whatever happened to "dont fly what you cant afford to lose?"
---
It's the relationships built with other people that enjoy spaceship submarines.
---
I find now that they are logging in less because of the changes. Unfortunately, if the reason I enjoy the game so much isn't there, I find myself logging in less.
---
i was actually going to address the points raised in this paragraph because i have a thing for beating the shit out of starving children in africa, but it was not long before i realized that op just wants to rant
---
instead i'll just do a very brief one
---
&gt; Hilly,
---
*yikes*
---
LOL, that's the best part its not "everyone" just you and the other 4-5 loudest CCP defenders.
---
I wish I had gold to give you.  This seems very insightful and an accurate summary of what's going on.  
---
Hoping to hear from the CSM summit soon.  Hear what CCP has to say on Blackout and whatnot.  
---
Definitely seems like players should take some initiative and reset some standings in the mean time.
---
Yeah I feel that too. Plus my Corp definitely ebbs and flows so some friends are here, others move on. But once a time zone slows down to one or two other people some nights it’s hard to do too much (Wormholer BTW)
---
👏No👏body👏cares👏if👏krabs👏fuck👏off
---
So many more roaming gangs and shit, and enough krabs are addicted enough to provide content.
---
Cry more about how you can’t play FarmVille in space
---
The most painful shit in the game
---
Name checks out
---
yes, this is absolutely sure to not crash the player count even more, brilliant plan.
---
Interesting, thanks :)
---
Having them apply perfectly to much smaller ships results in what we have now, which is definitely not engaging.
---
They are too good at too many roles, so people will either n+1 against them or just bring something that is a hard counter, like 100 bombers with a few booshers. And it happens every single time, the same tactic for every battle. If more things can kill them, people will use more fleet compositions to kill them and protect them.
---
Personally, i prefer the way they used to work and it was closer to how real warfare also works. You never see 10 aircraft carriers steaming merrily along their way to dunk on a lone patrol boat, because a single submarine can ruin their day. What usually happens is that 1-4 carriers will steam together, surrounded by a bunch of 20-30 smaller ships as escorts for different roles (anti-air, anti-submarine, screens and picket ships, early warning, etc).
---
The current meta is boring because caps are the one-stop solution to all problems. No rock-paper-scissors play, no assymmetric counters and no cyclical imbalance, which is the primary game design technique used to balance multiplayer games with a lot of competing variables and keep them interesting.
---
Caps have been game breaking from the beginning, because they had this notion of "special" strapped on to them. It just wasn't terribly obvious to everyone because they were relatively rare. Well, they are not special anymore because we're churning them out by the thousands, so an adjustment is in order.
---
Everyone I know his having more fun than ever.
---
This is so autistic
---
I'm AUTZ so I'm used to having only a few people to play with, but it's gotten a bit rediculous now.
---
F
---
You bet your ass they did!! Today saw 14 people killed in Abyssal PvP - that's more than we've seen in a long time :O Though most of those seem to be lost/confused Gilas... But hey, it's progress!
---
It'd be really cool to see more people doing it. Imagine if instead of 5 people doing it over and over, if 100 people did it regularly. More variety would be awesome!
---
Good luck finding targets when the server shuts down
---
\+1 for all the changes lately. shits getting hard and uncomfortable again. Love it. Make us Scream. All this whining is Sickening.
---
I for one welcome our new Triglavian Overlords.
---
This killmail has nothing to do with cyno changes, you'll die anyway to x13
---
Except it won’t; krabs multiboxing 4 rorqs aren’t as good for the game as 1 plex buying PvPer
---
How rude of those distasteful lowseccers. Or should I say lowlifes?
---
I hope CCP fix this, bring Concord to lowsec and punish people who ruin the fun for haulers
---
Do you really believe that
---
Yeah because I’m not fucking retarded
---
What. You can't reconcile *SOVEREIGN* space with rent? Weird...
---
Newbro detected. In my day we used the asset window for everything.
---

This makes too much sense, won't happen :(
---
&gt;They're not really smug posting here though are they, they're just chicken little posting at this point 'THE GAME IS DYING' every day.
---
Oh wow.  More null nerfs
---
Just what the game needs
---
Realtalk, it kinda does with the implementation of the indy cyno change. The indy cyno BPOs could have been preseeded and there was precedence to that in the past. It would have made this whole thing alot smoother.
---
But yeah, I've gotten lucky twice getting through that decloak drone camp, but it's still pretty impressive. Should have gotten through this time too (nearest drones were 5k off), I just messed up and double hit the cloak :/
---
make the current fax a archon like back then (stat wise) and give it a role bonus to "can refit in combat"
---
and remove cap booster, and capital neuts, will make triage alot more interessting
---
throughout history you've certainly been the most risk averse and cancerous. TEST has kind of taken up your mantle in that way these days but the goons definitely wrote the book on it.
---
And the blob groups are 100% of the flairs which make posts like the OP.
---
Not my screenshot, my Corp mates.
---
And yet no talk about wormholers using dreads to make 10 bill a day, but sure nerf the people who work with other to make their space better and farm isk to build warships to pvp. You nerf isk making you stop the line members ability to pay for ships during deployment. Making things more tedious is not good dame design
---
What if.. all the small alliances formed a big alliance named "small alliance"
---
able to ask them?
---
200 accounts per absent CSM member.
---
Wellcome to the club, where the shit of nullsec big blocks get collaterally spreaded over the other playstyles and environments..
---
I think having the icons different would be better.  Dscan can tell you which cyno type it is.
---
This raises so many questions, and none about EVE.
---
The Rancer pipe is known to be deadly to ships that rely on cloaks for tank.  Dying there in a BR should shock no one.
---
"cant AFK rat 150m/hr in perfect safety, so inconvenient :''''''( gonna go to gym"
---
 **Finally****,** **some good f****\*\*\*****ing content** **!**
---
I get where you're coming from, and I don't entirely disagree with you. There IS a shortage of content in EVE and people turning down opportunities for it is usually stupid. 
---
If you are actually showing up with a gang of dudes and NOT going straight for the noncombatants, I would say that it is reasonable (though not necessarily realistic) for you to expect a fight instead of a hotdrop. In that scenario, you are simply offering them content and it would be both foolish and unreasonable of them to drop caps on you. It would be like some dumbass redneck with a shotgun chasing away the Publisher's Clearing House van while it was trying to deliver a big check to him.
---
The problem, though, is that nullsec is infested with players who are just looking for free killmails while avoiding fights. These players almost invariably claim to be "looking for fights" and that the super umbrellas drop on them out of nowhere for no reason. "Yeah, I was just roaming through someone's mining/ratting space looking for some good fights, when a Hulk flown by a nullbloc pilot jumped me out of nowhere, lit a cyno, and dropped a titan fleet on me!"
---
These risk-averse gankers grossly outnumber people who are ACTUALLY looking for fights these days, and pretty much any change CCP makes to help the latter will be ruined by the former. When CCP makes it harder to avoid fights, they also make it harder to avoid ganks, and the gankers capitalize on this much harder than "real" pvpers do. This forces people to compensate by becoming MORE risk averse, which hurts gankers and legitimate pvpers alike.
---
To put it more simply...people have a limited tolerance for losses (or losses per kill, in the case of pvp). As long as their losses stay below the threshold of what they're willing to accept, they will be willing to continue to take risks. When their losses get too high, they adapt by becoming more risk-averse. Gankers put constant pressure on miners and ratters, driving up their losses far more than legitimate pvpers would, forcing them to practice a high degree of risk aversion by ensuring that virtually any risk they take results in a loss. 
---
If miners and ratters were only in danger of becoming incidental losses to roaming gangs that were looking for fights, rather than being constantly targeted by gankers, they would be FAR less risk averse.  If it weren't for gankers constantly targeting the nullsec alliances' miners and ratters, there probably wouldn't even BE super umbrellas and you wouldn't see a cyno on every pve-fit ship.
---
CCP is trying some shit because they fucked up for years. Players are fucking retards and also a bit at fault for the decline.
---
Second galaxy looks like a literal mobile copy of eve. Is it even halfway decent or is it just another cheap cash grab mobile game?
---
Everyone has been telling me to quit and i won’t be missed and i’m unwanted

But sure, i’m cruel and unforgiving

---
More and more targets that can actually die now.
---
That is also a problem, but more an annoyance, managable with saved fits. This is something that causes direct confusion.
---
if your vni was getting 150m/hour, i'm impressed.
---
Meh, abyssal PvP is pretty lame imo. Very minimal piloting skill, it’s mostly just matchups, bling and rng
---
Small alliance here. These changes have been great.
---
Take this upvote. It has guarded my family for generations.
---
ooh, you mean on the right click menu from the capacitor.  I thought you meant in-space on overview.
---
I can see that being a problem. However, with the prevalence of bait structure cynos nowadays, I avoid the problem entirely by just broadcasting the beacon and only using the fleet window.
---
However, for large fleet ops, especially ones which, perhaps, bridge a recon through an industrial cyno and thus end up with both types of non-covert cynos up, having them ID on right click could be very helpful.
---
Or just block industrial cynos from being visible on right-click to capitals.  A JF can still jump to both types, as can blops.
---
Out of curiosity, where do you normally run these missions out of?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
i downloaded it - it's very similar to eve echoes, which is literally an eve clone.
---
i could be wrong, i only had about half an hour to mess around with the first bit of the tutorial on SG.
---
if you like eve, and want to play on your phone... just get echoes unless you're legit looking for a new game.
---
You actually use the universal search? WHO RAISED YOU!!
---
Introducing new gameplay types outside of those areas as well as bringing back the missing gameplay in some form, those are ways to combat the decline and bring in fresh blood.
---
WHs that are lucrative but cannot be inhabited, space that does not connect to NS directly, a rebirth of LS gameplay without the threat of large-scale blobs/cap-drops/etc.
---
Almost every person I know that tried the game and quit, hit some sort of wall where the "easy" thing they were doing got boring... or they tried to dip their toe in the lawless portions of space and had absolutely no chance versus what met them there.
---
Needs to be a middle ground, and LS used to be it pre-WH and pre-Drop-Caps-On-Everything!
---
I've played off and on since 2004, but it took me a long time to find where I wanted to be in the game. I tried HS mining and missions, Piracy in LS back when that was still a thing (ransoming, etc), NS Blob membership and small renter corp too, WHs, FW, PVP with Red vs. Blue. Never really tried Incursions and never got very deep into any of those pursuits save for one.
---
All in all, I spent more time unsubbed than subbed and the game has always made me regret playing it and not playing it in equal measure. Injectors coming about made my SP and time spent training while not even playing seem very hollow and pointless. It used to at least make me feel good that I had some age and SP built up due to being an early player. Now it just takes money.
---
I don't want Eve to go anywhere, but I want them to add to the universe in a way that draws in new blood. Because all the old blood will eventually stop playing for one reason or another. Given it has been 15+ years, I imagine some of us are going to start dying as well...
---
Why form ? content denial is one of the most successful strategies.
---
&gt;CCP bans 2 alpha acounts in 1 week
---
So if you acknowledge that CCP is banning bots then why is the title and content of your post "Why CCP isn't banning bots"?
---
&gt;bot defenders
---
Lol.
---
Trying to keep hunters bored :)
---
&gt; Just one example among many, if people could undock a few kitchen sink subcaps to respond to threats and give some fights, instead of dropping caps on roaming frigates to discourage any sort of conflict apart from massive strat ops, maybe CCP wouldn't feel compelled to nerf the hell out of their toys after a few years.
---
maybe if dropping caps to discourage harrassing them wasn't the optimal play style - they wouldn't do it.
---
you gain more from uninterrupted afk ratting than you do participating in "content". reverse that, the problem goes away.
---
Well, if you misrepresent peoples' arguments then you will get called on misrepresenting peoples' arguments. I'm sorry that consistency is difficult for you.
---
As if goons wouldn't find a way to abuse whatever "defensive structures". Fuck off dude.
---
I predict that it will drop to zero at some point around when I'm waking up to go to work.
---
but have you ever stopped and thought "wait... I'm shitposting a lot just to shitpost, it's effortless and I don't even have to think anymore at this point - I just need to re-arrange words and use synonyms to trigger the opposing side. BUT BBTB - that guy posts a shit ton, I'm just gonna keep using the same strategy on him where I just endlessly post random assortments of words and... wait... wait a minute... is he??.."
---
By using our space and not discarding other play styles. Cry more
---
Can you share the numbers as them making more vs the opposition? YoY
---
Lol, the same can be said about all the "my gameplay is nerfed, i will unsub" people we've been seeing crying lately.
---
Still, i  didn't say "make my gameplay best". I said make more diverse gameplay choices viable, instead of having a single one dominate everything else. Because otherwise, even if you reverse the recent changes, the game will still tank. You can't have a single optimal gameplay choice in a sandbox game if you want it to survive. You need multiple viable choices, so that one can feed off of the other.

As for what i do, i left the game in 2006 when it became obvious it was on the road to become "capital ships online" (and i didn't even bust anybody's balls in the process about the game dying or being unfair, lol).
---
I came back in 2017 on a brand new alpha clone to see how the the game had changed, i made that an exploration alt because that's something that was added after i left, it was new to me and i wanted to try it out. I play on and off for a couple of months at a time ever since.
---
I still have my old toons.
---
My alt account (new exploration alt and old trader/personal hauler alt) is most of my playtime. I plex for a month or two every now and then. Basically, i try playstyles completely different than what i originally did when i first played the game.
---
What used to be my main account (one character, only PvP/combat skills trained) is the least of my playtime. With the way nullsec currently is, i only step foot in it for NPSI public roams. Even so, i once roamed for 4 hours in a kitchen sink NPSI fleet and we found less than 20 engageable targets (i kid you not), and that's months before blackout. So there's no reason to omega this account, i just use isk i make on the other account to buy ships for this one and mess around.
---
I could join a bloc, easily krab some isk for plex (or easily fund it through my trader alt) and have him there doing whatever it is alliances do these days, but i see no point with the way things are. Form up with hundreds of random strangers, go shoot a structure, maybe we get a fight, maybe not and the closest enemy is 40 jumps away because everyone is blue to most of their immediate neighbors. No thanks, it's much more fun to just roam and shoot everyone everywhere.
---
In other words, i'm glad null exists so a part of the playerbase can spread out across the map and do their own thing (and provide me with the occasional target in the process), but i don't care to engage with it in any meaningful way in its current state, starting with the mechanics/meta and ending with the prevalent culture. So you could stay it pretty much doesn't affect me at all. If it didn't exist, i'd just do what i currently do and go to lowsec instead to pick a fight or two.
---
I was practically raised in nullsec at a time when it was much harder to live there. Today it seems like it's the most "easy mode" part of the game,  at least until the recent changes. If they delete asset safety and add some real risk and reasons to properly invade each other, i might go back there and join a null corp, but with the current mechanics of infinite wealth accumulation i see no challenge in it whatsoever. Even Titans are a dime a dozen, all your stuff is safe, so losing means nothing. And as a result, winning doesn't mean much either. The stakes are too low for it to be interesting and the worst part is that the playerbase seems to like it that way. So i'm just a filthy casual doing my own thing for the time being :)
---
Wtf are you talking about? It's effectively two blocks. 
---
80% of it is legacy, goons, gotg + friends
---
20% is Pandafam.
---
this is wack. weebs can choke
---
incredible response wasted on an undeserving thread
---
Reading the article, I can't help but think that Hilmar has a point. Left to their own devices, the player base will succumb to [the tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) and EvE will continue to stagnate until it dies off. I'll admit that CCP shares some of the blame for not making the mechanics favor the game being continually shaken up, but at least they're putting in the effort to knock things around and build mechanics where that will happen automatically. As a new player, I appreciate that.
---
And for those of you who have built up those massive blocs in null, Goonswarm in particular...guys, you basically *won* EvE, and not in the ironic "I quit" sense of "winning EvE". The Imperium's leadership basically wrangled a horde of insane, autistic cats into enough of a semblance of order that you carved out what I'm reasonably certain is *the* biggest and most prosperous player-run organization in the history of online gaming, and for all that people love to rag on you, that is *no mean feat*.
---
I get that a lot of people are leaving the game or unsubbing accounts because the recent changes are disrupting your playstyles and, like anyone else who's gotten used to a good thing, this *really pisses you off*, but I don't think that this is the end of the game.
---
As old players move on new blood will arrive to take their place, and bitter players who decided they hated the changes too much  to keep playing will be replaced by people curious about what EvE has to offer but wouldn't be able to thrive with all the entrenched coalitions out there, waiting to pounce on fresh meat or draw the new players into the huge blocs, quite possibly both.
---
There's a lot of potential here, folks, and a lot of space for us to thrive in. Maybe I'm wrong, and EvE really is breathing its last, but I have hope, and I'm willing to see what's waiting for us past the horizon.
---
Just my two cents. :)
---
My point is that i have evidence they are not banning at least some bots and you don't have any evidence at all they are banning anybody.  So yes, i have reasons to NOT trust them. At least i brought you to acknowledge you have no reason to trust them.
---
I think the 80% blue donut is one the biggest contributors of nothing exciting happening in game.
---
"We want better gameplay and for things to be interesting... but, don't nerf my things or make it hard for me to hold onto power in my video game empire. Hold on a sec, dropping caps on a 5-day old player trying foolishly to do his Mission in LS, brb.
---
Okay, that guy will never wanna play again... what were we talking about?"
---
You're blue donut is 80% of null, blame yourselves if we're going Serenity.
---
If you were a fan of the old top down combat games with actual boss mechanics I'd suggest a look at CrossCode.
---
U mad OP
---
skill urself
---
it is known
---
&gt; My point is that i have evidence they are not banning at least some bots 
---
Where?
---
You showed 2 screenshots of totally different characters.
---
Or did you just not reveal your evidence so you could "gotcha"?
---
Not structures on that grid (it’s a whaling fleet) AND the dude literally split his DPS on the megathron
---
Not the best case to argue against my point
---
&gt;CCP bans 80,000 bot characters
---
  &gt;Eve players use drop in numbers to justify their shitposting and terrible ideas
---
  &gt;/r/eve 2019
---
Mostly just to over 5000 player alliances that fortress up in one region and create oppressive super umbrellas.
---
lol ok goons
---
goons
---
Nope, more like 200 goons vs 50-100 standard sniping battleships of the time with 10-20 smaller escorts (some ceptor/AF tackle, some ECM and some cruiser anti-frig) mixed in.
---
The server couldn't withstand hundreds and hundreds of players on a single grid back then, the node would crash at about 400 players total on grid.
---
can confirm, game is lit right now
---
Banning people for using multiple alpha accounts isn't banning bots. Seriously dude, please read all the post before answering and be sure you understand everything, that's becoming ridiculous.
---
that old time where we had to use maelstorm to fight slowcat was fun :3
---
Yes, yes, we all know you are special. 
---
TERRORISM, AL QUEDA, 9/11, DIRTY BOMB.
---
Now that we got the attention of NSA, FBI, you should delete your account and get off grid in a tinfoil insulated cabin in the woods! They are on to you!
---
How do you want to play a game being blind? Let’s be serious? at some point with such a disability , you should focus on doing more accessible to you than playing video games. It’s like wanting to play soccer without legs.
---
I thought the long version could have been longer tbh
---
Right, so in addition to making it harder to superdunk on a roaming gang, it needs to be harder to escape from a fight once you have harassed the krab
---
So instead of a ganker being able to snag a helpless kill and fuckoff, they should somehow get forced to stay on grid and uncloaked for some time, but also not vulnerable to getting dunked by caps or blobbed to hell. 
---
Not sure how to achieve that, but it seems to be the ideal.
---
can i have your stuff?
---
I'm sure they will get to wormholes soon. Tbf though, dread ratting in wormholes is far more risky and difficult than it is to un-dock your super and nuke some rats in havens - where your biggest concern is if you are in standing fleet and calling your sites.
---
The game was never in a good place when you could mine yourself a personal super-cap fleet by multi-boxing rorqs while watching Netflix. Getting a titan isn't even a big deal anymore, it's fairly effortless. 
---
The answer was either to continue to watch the game slowly die while it became titans online, or make null-sec riskier. CCP tried small economic changes like fighter and rorq nerfs but we all know those sort of changes just means everyone will get another mining alt. The only real answer is to turn up the risk.
---
The problem is that most of null sec has become so accustomed to making huge amounts of money in a risk-free environment. It's hard to get excited about have to work hard to make 1bil a week when you were chilling and making 10 bil before. Most big null-blocs are pissed because they have spent the last few years recruiting on the basis of "come and mine in the safest space in eve where you too, can have a titan".
---
Of course If you want low risk then you can go to low-sec or high-sec, you just wont be able to print money like you used to.
---
If people played the game on the basis of interacting with other people and building teams/friendships to overcome challenges, then they wouldn't be quitting just because the economics got nerfed. The fact that they do leave for those reasons, shows just how superficial a lot of the groups and gameplay in eve really is.
---
In anycase, the decline in player-count hasn't translated to a decline in content from what i have seen. It's not like all those risk-adverse people were creating fights before by sitting in their rorquals under a super-cap umbrella.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
Uhhh... wow.
---
The stories from Finfest are filled with all kinds of "what the *fuck?!*"
---
the new rules were posted for all to see, I had to drop a couple B on re-fitting, and some time on making a new cyno and all, if they had done the same, then they would have spent the day mining with me, making tons of isk, instead of making our space unsafe for everyone! no sympathy
---
&gt;The Rancer pipe is known to be deadly to ships ~~that rely on cloaks for tank~~.
---
ftfy
---
Wormholers have neither been recently nerfed, nor crying non-stop as a result, that's why the current focus is on nullsec.
---
Plus, i personally haven't lived in WHs to have enough previous experience about them and form an opinion of what is OP and what is not.
---
I have lived in null though and i remember it being much harder, challenging and more interesting than it is today.
---
Temporary hotfix is to switch to DX9 mode.  
---
For ATI/AMD cards installing last drivers may help.  
---
At least this worked for me
---
haha .. Hilmar got you all .. FF
---
as a side note, there was a huge fleet of rorqs, that did follow the rules, and when a fleet of 200 bombers came in to blow them up, all the ones who followed the rules LIVED! and they had to settle for 1 rorq that wasnt following them, and the supper cap fleet blowing them up at the same time.
---
I don't really create content because there's no incentive because of all the reasons i already provided. If there was any enjoyable reason for me to be in null regularly, i would. I don't mind losing ships, i can easily make 4-6 billion per month on a trader alt and i only fly cruisers and below, so that's a lot of ships to burn through.
---
I just can't bother making 40 jumps and finding nothing, only to get dropped by 3 FAX 1 super and 2 carriers on the 41st.
---
EVE is a ui nightmare to begin with.  I commend any effort to make it accessible to those with a handicap, as it is going to be a very difficult task.  Amazing.
---
So its time to get out the big toys and thunderdome in HED!?
---
goons are blowing up there own rorqs for fits like this atm, so meh if they kept up with the rules they would have lived
---
you dont understand, for eve to survive certain players have to leave or change mindset, and im not talking about pve only players.
---
With the kind of luck that you have to have to lose four Rorquals all at once, it's probably accurate to say that if not for bad luck, you'd have no luck at all.
---
Yeah I ended up installing the latest "Optional" drivers for my graphics card and it seems to have fixed it.
---
News, only 10000 players actually have balls.
---
What did PL live long enough to become?
---
Corp tickers in imperium would be CON00 through CONJJ (using the letters A through J as extra digits would allow us to have 400 corps with that ticker range). So the FC just doesn't call those primary, easy.
---
Point me to the high sec or low sec people who have had any super cap fights ever.
---
about wormholes, no. If you want raise activity there, you must offer something shiny, something what you really need for something but you can only get it in wh. Materials mostly, so people might start live there and farm them.
---
Best post in the thread.
---
The funny thing is, I just rewatched WarGames out of the blue yesterday.
---
Tl:Dr could be reduced to: CCP introduced a bunch of ways to make ISK AFK safely hyper-inflating the economy and everyone's ISK/h meaning less incentive for people playing the game actively. This lead to stagnation in player activity as the game became a race to the Super. Now CCP is taking away some of the safety driving away AFK-ers and they're unsubbing and spelling the doom of EVE because their inactive ass isn't going to be out in space for hunters to maybe occasionally kill.
---
Git gud :P
---
Could of fooled me
---
Ha no. Cry more.
---
My struggle hasn't been the changes themselves, but rather what appears to be blatant disregard for thoughtful change. No local came with zero nerfs to cloaking, whereas before local was the only counterbalance to infinite afk cloaky camping. These cyno changes don't come with any sort of nod towards how much it's going to bottleneck t2 cruiser materials and thus inflate prices.
---
Chaos is one thing, poor game design choices are another.
---
Goonswarm has standardized fits that it recommends Rorqual's use. The issue lies with people who are either stupid or just blissfully unaware of the fact people hunt goons. Goons have gained a bad reputation fitting wise mostly because of these people. I would like to remind you, the bad fits die, the good fits live. You don't see the rorquals that get saved. You do see the rorquals that deserved to die.
---
Have you even seen the last meta show? After BR5 when PL got all their shit stuck in that station, then controlled by goons after winning the battle, the leader of PL went to mittani and asked to get those assets out, or else a big portion of his guys would probably quit (member level assets were stuck there, dreads, carriers, subcaps, refits, ammo, etc). And instead of dealing a huge blow to PL, an enemy of goonswarm at the time, Mittens allowed PL to retrieve their assets. So to protect the game, Mittani gave PL asset safety. Even though it would've been a strategic victory just to say no.
---
That was a fun kill. with the super fighters on top of our asses.
---
so you want 6 5k player alliances who are all blue to each other in one region ?
---
it makes ni sence they can just blue up and use the same coms and informations systems
---
the game was fine before rorqs and will be fine after them, highsec production was enough for like a decade. Nullsec industrialists arent the game saviours, chill
---
feel your pain, man .. its gone forever
---
The best part of this, if rorqs could both light and jump to indy cynos. Alliances would finally have a fleet of battle rorqs for their umbrella. #CCPLEASE
---
nah nah nah, delete esis from the game and watch empires crumble.
---
I don't get your point. Is this sarcastic? Why would it if be bad if those groups weren't dropping super caps?
---
If you're being serious and need me to point out those groups then you clearly live in a bubble. Titans and supers get dropped in low-sec all the time.
---
This daily "Eve is dying" shit is old, kindly fuck off to another game already.
---
Why would you want to save PI on a fitting?
---
You wouldn't be trying to carry Reactive Gas by any chance?
---
Hilmar pls if I have to rely on other people's support to use or move my caps in my gigantic Alliance this is like a multiplayer game now pls no!
---
Who is the coward? :P
---
Have you tried that? More likely not and so why do you think so?
---
What happened to every excav/Rorq loss is actually an economic net gain in Delve time-units or whatever boneheaded shit querns spammed across reddit?
---
Oooof the butt hurt bitterness factor (BHBf) is stronk in this one .
---
Because they want to punish CCP for nerfing their play style.
---
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
---
oh my god what is that hand writing
---
or perhaps it is to force a certain playerbase to quit for the longevity of the game?
---
Agreed on most points and especially the social aspect. I remember that i kept my subs going for more than 6 months, having practically nothing to do in the game because capitals had started becoming mandatory (i could train into one, i just don't like bigger ships because everything happens in slow motion), just because of the people i used to play with.
---
So nullsec without infinite cheap access to HACs and bombers? Sounds fantastic tbh if you had to defend your space with whatever your industry can build.
---
Apparently this was common knowledge. I was only made aware after the fact. 😿
---
Game chugged on just fine for the first 3 years around 10k players online at any time and it was fun and fine.
---
Good luck with what you've got going on here though, hope it works out.
---
Yes
---
So you don't plan for any counterplay, you don't interdict the undocking response fleet, you don't have heavy assets like dreads ready to go in case the response is smaller than usual, you don't make any distractions, you don't coordinate with other smaller groups, you don't use spies or observation to find weak links (bad fits, no refits, no mumble, slow reaction times in pulling drones, etc). 
---
Instead you just show up, stick your hand in the bee's nest, and hope for the best. Like you've done for over a decade. 
---
Up until these cyno changes we never bothered with doctrine PVE fits, we never bothered getting people without mumble into the fold, we never bothered getting people without jabber into the fold, we never bothered to demand a microphone for supercapital pilots, we never bothered getting people to not jump to cynos blind, we never bothered to do any of the prudent things that this cyno change now force us to do. So a month from now it'll be even harder to get kills in delve that aren't just random subcaps.
---
I fail to see the issue.
---
Shut up retard
---
Are you saying someone has been lighting their personal cynos all this time?
---
Yeah,  but ya'll can cry bout it alone.
---
Most people who have multiple caps have a cyno alt yes so they don't have to rely on jump beacons or move fleets if they want to do anything.
---
You missed the point.
---
no talk about wormholers making 10b a day, because they actually put their ships at [risk](https://zkillboard.com/region/11000030/losses/group/485/). this here shows the dreadnought losses in all the c6 systems of eve, and considering the size of the population, dreads seem to drop pretty regularly. they usually cost more than 4b isk and possibly contain even more value in the occasional abyssal module. the npc losses go on to show that this is not the easy pve you've grown used to either (not counting the effort required to prepare for settlement and krabbing). you are also at a much higher risk of losing assets if someone wants to evict you from your bearhole.
---
and it's not just the evil wormhole pvpers raking in the blue loot either- null players can be found on both sides of these ganks too. so i don't think your point about wormholers is really relevant to this discussion.
---
More so today, because larger groups will blap your cyno in a moment, so even if your small alliance DOES have capitals to throw in and win, you can't, unless you now also win the subcap fight first.
---
So you know of bots that USE to be in the game and that is evidence CCP hasn't banned them?
---
Really?
---
That's not evidence of bots not being banned.
---
Resource depletion and an asset safety nerf
---
Thoughts:
---
 ***Alliance/SOV*** 
---
1./2. Will not change much
---
3. Exponential cost will be circumvented by puppet alliances, also excluding I-Hubs without upgrades is not a good idea, because those are the I-Hubs you would ideally want to get rid of, systems that are owned "just because".
---
4. I am OK with
---
5./6. That will be punishing players from different timezones living together, one of the strong points of EVE
---
 ***Moons*** 
---
Please tell me more why you want to make these changes. The only problem I have with moons is that there should be a structure that is more like a Gate/Jammer/Beacon (just the drill), because you don't really need more than one full service dockable structure per system, would also remove some Overview spam and possibly add more things too shoot at.
---
 ***Titans/Supers*** 
---
Capital application to subcaps is topic that comes up a lot and when nerfing them you always need to think about the PvE ships as well. Maybe we need new tracking modules for PvE that give serious drawbacks in PvP (Polarized (Omnidirectional) Tracking Computer/Enhancers maybe?) Web/Scram are fine for the support fighters, but maybe we can replace the neut/ECM with tracking disruption and target painting?
---
 ***Fax***  
---
Not saying you are wrong, also those models are way too big
---
 ***Rorqual*** 
---
Split it into two ships, one with less tank and Excavators, one with PANIC/Compression/Boosts
---
 ***Low Sec*** 
---
Respawning Anomalies in a Lowsec Constellation is a good idea, it gives people are reason to stay out and do stuff and I would not limit it to ore anomalies. Might also be a way to add a bit more content to NPC null.
---
Will be interesting how constellations like [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Lonetrek/Okunda#sec](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Lonetrek/Okunda#sec) will be used.
---
Sorry that folk don’t understand the concept of straw manning and their own implementation. Your points were sound.
---
We wanted indy cynos that could be lit by any ship, not this hauler only dumbshit
---
More Mittens top spin propaganda on how making the game require more coordination between people for things you could previously do with a month old alt will kill EVE.
---
Drama on reddit, blackout in nullsec, cyno on recons, PCU in freefall so nothing too important really
---
&gt;the promise of easy killmails is an irresistible lure for the legions of "elite pvpers" in EVE
---
YES! So in reality "elite pvpers" are the ones who are killing the game. Those guys who are always looking for 99% efficiency battle reports. They end up always shitting on any group less able than themselves, and so they basically hunt small groups into extinction and later complain when they get shit on themselves by the large groups that formed as a result of tiny groups all joining forces.
---
Somehow this statement makes me sad.
---
I go through there in BR’s all the time, still never lost a ship there, come close to losing a few captors to smart bombs but never a BR
---
Amen to that, pilot.
---
can confirm, was around in shoot first's pre-cyno-change 20 dread hot drop yesterday, a low sec system 5 jumps from highsec
---
Which partially removes some of the intent of the changes.
---
But exactly that ist what they are doing. Constantly whining about how unfair it is that an organized group can defend themself and they want their free easy Kills. You too have a bit of a look away and only really support one side.
---
At least I'm not claiming CCP is doing literally nothing about bots.
---
 Added Industrial Cynosural Field Generator.
---
* Can be fit by Industrials, Deep Space Transports and Blockade Runners.
---
* Industrial Cynosural Fields can be jumped to by Jump Freighters and Black Ops Battleships.
---
* Requires Cynosural Field Theory I to activate.
---
maybe you sdhould be the one to read it again
---
I wonder what you would try to blame it on if not for the funk changes ?
---
Pilot error is still pilot error no matter the reason for you going through there :p
---
Wow. This guy gets it
---
I am pretty sure PA have a website or something where you can look up that stuff. I am also pretty sure they will not listen to you.
---
If you want to balance it you still need to get rid of the ability for wormholes to seal off there wormholes, why should they have comparatively the ability to make amazing isk  to a supper or carrier ratting these days with ought reasonable risk of pvp intervention. Don’t get me wrong I like pretty much all CCP have done but they have just taken a hatchet to one particular groups play-style and not given anything back to them or balanced it with changes to other people’s.
---
Restricting alliance numbers doesn’t balance anything, just means more alliances that’ll blur each other, and hubs will just be spread across new alliances to keep the cost down ...
---
I didn’t read further then that, I assume all your other suggestions are just as ridiculous
---
Due to its specialization towards industrial operations, its ship maintenance bay is able to accommodate only industrial ships, mining barges and their tech 2 variants.
---
A rorq used to get that.
---
"+25% more efficient when in Imperium or Legacy SOV"
---
A month from now every single target in delve will be on comms (wasn't like that before), will have proper fits (wasn't like that before), will have jabber for pings about fleets (wasn't like that before), will have a microphone (wasn't like that before), will be on intel channels (wasn't like that before), will be on a coalition-wide in-game chat (wasn't like that before). 
---
You haven't seen oppressive nullsec umbrellas yet compared to what you'll see by Christmas.
---
I think you absolutely nailed it. A lot of the people who are in the big bloc groups, especially newer players who have never seen the game any other way are entirely unaware of the economic damage that was being caused by the unassailable wealth being created due to the mechanics CCP had allowed for the past few years. 
---
As you said, they are making a big gamble and I hope it pays off but it is indeed a big one.
---
We've literally been just sitting here in Delve for the past 4 months and you still want to blame Goons for the games increasing decline
---
SKILL BOOK INJECTED: MENTAL GYMNASTICS
---
more blue donut salt plz...small groups will do just fine if they are pvp oriented...for the res,t hisec is up for grabs
---
Flat Earther maths there.
---
Sure, it'll be slaved and bricktanked and as you think you're about to kill it, on comes phenom generator for 30% HP and then supercarrier boosts on top. Followed by several lances and supercarrier fighters and remote burst projectors webbing and pointing you.
---
Holy shit you are exactly the problem he is talking about. Wormholes are not the fucking problem here.

Look at the MER for the last two years. Its obvious who killed eve

Maybe crosspost to /r/bravenewbies

Probably more accurately phrased “Expect the worst, pray for the best”
---
Sorry, edit button is borked 😿
---
Yes that'd be nice thank you for a nice thread these are rare these days.
---
I would not say it is broken, but yes it would have been a buff.
---
It would even have been a buff to lowsec station cynos for jump freighters, because you are not broadcasting to the whole server "industrial killmark waiting here"
---
It would have been a buff for players who enjoy JF logistics, because you don't need to sit around with your cyno for 10 minutes.
---
The important question: Would it have been a *nerf* to people hunting jump freighters? No. Doesn't matter if covops or industrial cyno, 99.99% of JF jump to a structure/station and dock up.
---

they gona come back...anyway,who wanted players docking up as soon as a neutral was reported 5 j away?content 0

Sure, wanna get a ratting and exploration bots bundle aswell ?
---
I used to own a moon empire. I FC'd fleets of hundreds. I killed Supers and Titans. I farmed WHs like they were fruit orchards. I dominated Jita market PVP. I won tournaments. I have not played in 6 years. That's how I won EVE.
---
I've played off and on since '04, too. More 'off' since ~2012, but I still come back and give it a try again usually 2 - 3 times a year. I definitely agree with a lot of what you've said.
---
One thing I would really call out, though, that seems to me as maybe 25% CCP's fault and 75% the playerbase's fault that's been a roadblock to me getting back in the game is the unwillingness to make risky trust decisions / meta-gaming about spies.
---
I'll grant that CCP carries some of the blame here for making it difficult for corps / alliances to function without giving risky amounts of power to players, and also by taking away some of the API stuff.
---
That being said, I remember back in the day joining ASCN with very little vetting basically because an in-game acquaintance vouched for me. These days you can't hardly join even a casual carebear corp without handing over screenshots of your login screen, captures of your log folders, god knows what else.
---
I dunno, maybe I'm paranoid, but like...the whole way that phishing works a lot of the time is because it's not obvious to the victim how innocuous-seeming info might be used against them. I can't always say how *exactly* the joining requirements might compromise my account, but a lot of the shit people ask for these days, especially since getting rid of API, feels *really* invasive.
---
I feel like CCP could step in and outline for corp-seekers some things that they guarantee it is Definitely Safe to provide to recruiters, and then make it bannable to ask for anything outside of that. I get maybe, *maybe*, you don't want to hand over Director power of your cap-building corp to somebody without having a peek at their alts, but if you can't just hire a baseline grunt who just wants to casually pewpew without asking for everything but their SSN, maybe you need to HTFU and / or quit being fucking lazy and handing out roles like candy because it's easier than building proper trust relationships.
---
This proofs...  ...nothing but the author is defending bots or have interest on them. This numbers only proof less ratting in some nullsec regions but the is no reason at all to believe that's only because of bots. What i'm sure is that blackout affected human players very much and that's a perfectly reasonable explanation by itselft to the reduction of ratting in nullsec. Maybe bots are also ratting less in nullsec but this doesn't proof bots are stopped ratting completely, neither proof bots haven't moved to lowsec, or even highsec, neither proof bots aren't doing other activities like moon mining. Bots can adapt very fast and trying to stop them with the blackout or nerfing VNIs is simply an stupid idea.

---
Exactly my thoughts on all the people crying. HTFU
---
The loss of dreads is actually really low. The reason for this is you simply roll your random holes and stick alts on the statics so you know when someone is entering the system. It's as good, if not better, than null intel networks. You can also make 2b/hour in a c6, the maximum youll bring in with a rorq in null is around 110m/hour and roughly 350m with super ratting.
---
Let's get some perspective, by all means nerf null, but wormholes are likely to be close to follow if you follow the MERs.
---
I mean, at least we know op has a phone, am i rite?  
---
Ah, Blizzard would be proud.

I’m sure we don’t use lofic at all 😇

---
Who’s mittens? A cat? Please don’t hate on me, I don’t know 😿
---
Yes, Star pack sale last year is how I started my second account and my PI alts.
---
The key is that we need the new blood to come in to take their place, and have enough old players to be around to show them the ropes.
---
Really trying to learn and get into eve but im so fucking confused at whats going on. Lol
---
i know you can do that, still the risk of people ragerolling to get in is real. the long term risk of getting evicted is real. and the effort wh ratters make is also more than that of the average null linemember.
---
if the risk/reward is out of balance for wormholes as well, go ahead and nerf, but from what i can see some people are trying to use it as an argument for their case.
---
I mean.. kinda? Data mining is really cool and fun, but it also ruins the mystery and wonder.
---
I saw a gel go in delve yesterday fully fit for 2bil gg wp
---
Just this.           
---
EVE is big enough that CCP can introduce more various game play styles.          
---
I stated this multiple times - why we don't have regional effects?       
---
Imagine yourself :               
---
* region where you cannot use cyno, gates are to small to allow capital travel, regions without local or regions without ability to use cloack or nullification                    
---
* Why higsec is flat? Why living in Amarr space don't mean something. Why cheap labor force don't reduce the production cost? * Why Minamarar space don't have bonus for the exploration sites spawning as those are fragmented tribes (and so on)            
---
* Why FW lowsec is not perma cyno jammed? This suppose to be zone for new players learning stuff.              
---
* Why NPC nullsec is ignored? Years of nerfs, introducing some dumb stuff like burners ... why not bring back those areas to life?              
---
Those where alliances that harassed sov around lived in there, now gone.                                
---
I tell you why.          
---
Because doing this require **investing some cash** and no one at CCP want to invest in EVE any more.          
---
What we get are database side changes.             
---
We disable this, and this ... and this.            
---
Instead of getting new game styles we are constantly getting some removed, nerfed and players engaged in those styles quitting.              
---
**Adapt or die** like literally        
---
#FUCK THAT            
---
EvE is a game/product/way you waste your free time.

If you don't want to play it, don't find it fun just quit and find something new and spend your cash on it.

---
What would stop your enemies from setting their tickers to COND\*\* ?
---
Hint take all nullsec income (mining and ratting) before "northern purge" and the one from imperium controlled regions.          
---
Then take the same from last MER.            
---
You use this to get "how much of the total nullsec income was goon income" you get this in %.           
---
If you compare it you will see that Imperium grew compared to others.           
---
Like yes they make less isk, but every one else make less isk also.
---
Closer to 42
---
I liked some of the ideas they introduced, but most fail to get fleshed-out to maximum potential. Most likely hindered by being built upon existing gameplay instead of new gameplay mechanics, like you said. Those fortresses that lock down things in High Sec (mb LS too?) sounded interesting, but I don't know where to find them and the mechanics around it seem too localized and easy to curtail. It doesn't infect or spread. PVE enemies should organically spread unless cut back by Players, or evolve and shift even if they are systematically stomped out.
---
NPCs acting more like players would be fun. Have rats escape into WHs, dive into LS and dare you to chase with taunts in local. Engage both sides when you get attacked in those places.
---
I love Eve, but that doesn't mean it is perfect. However, it also isn't far from broken in some regards. There are a TON of little things they left hanging for so long, and big things they never really seem to have fully implemented. The game is big, maybe too big for them to manage, and built on aging supports that are getting harder to maintain. Maybe it "just works" as it is and there's a fear of actual honest-to-god changes, versus toggling things on and off here and there to make things interesting.
---
The worst part of Eve potentially leaving us, as it most certainly will eventually, is that there most likely will never be a replacement for it.
---
Let's be real. CCP killed the game 3 years ago, it just took this long for things to play out. Citadel mechanics, rorq nerfs, skill injectors, and unlimited respawning anomalies. That killed EVE. This was the only outcome possible with those variables. People warned CCP over and over. Well, here we are needing changes. We still have skill injectors, citadels that have entirely way too many game-breaking features, and rorqs were nerfed and anomalies were slightly reduced but not by much.
---
Problem is that most of that null population that's left invested a lot of time into the gameplay that ccp gave them. Now CCP is panicking and just basically spamming buttons and ideas. Of course people are leaving. The game they enjoyed is gone. What will be left? Like walking around a ghost town playing paintball I guess. Have fun with that.
---
The last 3 years were like they were catering to right handed people only. Now they're like crap, this is too one-sided for righties, we need to make this geared to left handed people only. Well, the right handed people are quitting and not many of the left handed people are coming back. gg
---
LOL he has no idea how delve works :-D
---
I think that EVE should be Free to Play - we would have 50k online easy
---
You will get those skins when ever the numbers in eve will go up........ So probably never
---
The reason why null is complaining is because these changes effectively remove their most enjoyable playstyle. Think about that, they've literally invested years skilling up vni, cap, rorq and super car accounts for pve and pvp and now they cannot use them. 
---
That's a heck of a lot of time and subscription money people have spent. I can totally empathise as to why they would feel utterly let down, conned out of their money even! Having some ill informed high sec player with 0 null experience yap at them about being dropped on the second you enter alliance space... come on man, you'd know that isn't the case if you actually tried it. I regularly roam through Delve in a stratios, it's great fun. MWD cloak trick will get you through the gates... but now their are no vnis to hunt and relic runners seem on the decline too.
---
I don't think it's healthy for the game to make one of the most populated areas of space empty. You'll lose too many players. The Eve ecosystem also depends on their being pve players for hunters to chase. Some of my fav vids are from coordinated hunting or hotdrops. I still regularly watch the vid of JayAmazingness losing his rev to a PL dread bait... And I've been there too, the first time my rorqs were dropped on i was literally shaking and my voice cracked on comms as the response fleet was forming. That's exhilarating and hugely engaging and you kinda become hooked on it, intentionally staying out when BB fleets are out and whatnot.... Dont take all of that away from null, you're just going to kill the game for so many (not those in Low / WHs / High, totally appreciate you're rubbing your hands right now).
---
Yeah, and he's right.
---
Economically speaking, the best move is to literally recruit every warm and lukewarm body you can find, and cram them into the space you own. Even if they constantly lose supercarriers and rorquals, they're still using the markets, they're still generating tax revenue, they're still refining ore, they might be building stuff (more taxes), or whatever else. Even if they're a literal hostile alt, they're buying assets from the market, which are either built locally or imported for profit by friendlies. They might even be building those assets with locally-produced goods. It's an economic positive regardless. If they lose a nyx, they buy a new one from someone else, which just means further manufacturing tax costs, and market taxes.
---
On top of that, if we didn't let these people join, they would simple move to a renter alliance under someone elses control (traditionally NCPL or the russian alliances) and we'd lose the income stream, for the benefit of some other alliance.
---
On top of THAT, we also go to great lengths to encourage these PVE-only types to actually step into the PVP arena and actually contribute at a strategic level. This is something that rarely happens inside a renter alliance, which are typically isolated and quarantined specific systems or constellations at best. I've personally seen a lot of "PVEers" morph into a healthier playstyle over the years due to the expectation of PVP contribution.
---
The current crackdown is intended to whip the bottom-of -the-barrel type players into shape with the cyno changes as a catalyst, in order to mitigate the increase in loses we expect due to the changes. This isn't even a new idea, we had been discussing it for months. If we have to shoot a few irredeemable morons in the process to make a point, so be it.
---
Corporations and Alliances are too big, imo. If they were limited, however, people would just game the system by doing things outside the game to unify.
---
Part of the joy of Eve is the relative freedom it allows any player to have. It is also unfortunately the problem, as it allows any player to take advantage of systems to an extreme.
---
Corp spies and espionage, dirty tricks, etc, has never been a big part of the game for me. Hell, I've spent most of the game running from big alliances and being squished into space no one wants and paying a premium for it. That, or taking to riskier areas that are honestly... pretty empty 90% of the time. Look for fights, don't find them, get fights when I'm not in a fighting ship, get gibbed by HS shenanigans or have people try to scam or bait you into conflict that the Police will win for them... All that stuff just gets tiring and is the game-within-the-game for a select group. Meanwhile, it all alienates the newbros and makes things seem daunting.
---
I want to build stuff in Eve, but that's difficult to do while doing other things. It takes a huge time investment, just to SEE if I want to do it. Sometimes it isn't even about it paying off, but the SP you funnel into something just to realize it is "meh" to you. Now you can extract, but before it was like "AFs are probably HELLA fun!" ... finally train them up and you wish you hadn't because they suddenly aren't "meta," or no one flies doctrines for them where you live and solo-roaming in them is cancer.
---
Some of those are extreme examples and I literally pulled AFs from a hat, so don't argue with me about what AFs were in 2009 when I trained them, or their status in 2019. Just more or less pointing out that Eve is a time-sink for new players and they need more direction and more DIRECT things to do right away.
---
The real loss in audience is the lack of replenishment as fast-paced games are the meta. They take all the new blood that may have at least tried Eve in the past.
---
How about when you want to repair, it not showing tons of ships and modules that are already 100% repaired?

That's not really constructive and with all nullbears shrieking getting anything constructive and sane is next to impossible.
---
ofc, blaim school, eve always went up after the summer, when the schools started..... And ofc you can blaim WoW.... but maybe its because its more fun????
---
Players not login alts......player always had alts, then not login them in, probably means something is wrong.
---
And bots..... well if this many bots were always a problem, then ccp was just lazy not removing them be4.
---
Just my 2 cents
---
Nifty, perhaps add total m3 and a filter for sec status?
---
You just make the corps with the ticker range you want. Anything above CONJJ in this case, would be an enemy corp (You know your ABCs, right?).
---
ccp digging their grave, you should check their recruitment page, might find something for yourself.

---
yes, of course, what an MMO needs, less players.
---
Brilliant.
---
Needs egg.
---
That now explains a lot of things.
---
what i'm saying is that there isn't anything about blackout that urges ccp to take a look at whbtw ratting. if critting statics is a problem now, it was a problem then, regardless of changes to other areas. blackout, cynos etc are about solving problems on a wider scope, whereas the effects of wh wealth generation are more benign, if that makes sense. hard knocks having access to that kind of wealth may be unfair and that would warrant adjustments, but it's not a gamebreaker in the sense uncontrolled inflation is.

---
Yeah, that would be great. 
---
Maybe they could make it so that if you kill someone in space where they are blue to the sov-holding entity, you get temporarily infinipointed like when waiting for Concord to kill you (subject to a cooldown, so you're not permanently tackled as long as you're killing people - only after the first kill. This would allow alert defenders who have a subcap fleet on standby a small window in which to respond. 
---
Maybe 10-120 seconds would be appropriate, depending on the system's infrastructure levels? 10 seconds for completely undeveloped systems; killing someone there means you're free and clear unless someone was JUST landing on grid with you in point range. 120 seconds for full indices, meaning you're not safe if the response fleet is fast and within a couple of jumps.
---
This would make ganking in a nullsec entity's core systems more dangerous, as it should be. It would probably also make the miners and ratters there less vigilant and thus easier to catch, if you're willing to fight the response fleet.
---
This change would probably need to be accompanied by a buff to mobile cyno inhibitors; if you're willing to stay in place for that long in hostile space, you're obviously there for a fight and deserve to get a fight, not a superdunk. 
---
Obviously, caps could still WARP to you, but they warp slowly and have a limited amount of time to reach you before the infinipoint wears off. In the case of ratting anomalies, it's deadspace anyways, so you can just put distance between yourself and the warpin point before the slow-warping caps can get there. 
---
I'm tired and about to go to bed; sorry if I overlooked any glaring logical flaws in this idea.

Thank you again for this awesome feedback.  The EVE community thanks you for your contribution.  Now I need to get back to this awesome game called EVE that we all enjoy.
---
Yes, players playing the game with the mechanics that were given, have killed the game.
---
Not the company that designed it, or the competition that was too shitty and broken politically to keep up.
---
Yes, its goon's fault that eve is dying because they are good at it.
---
Makes sense, perhaps we should just be worse at the game, I'm sure that would help its fundamentally broken balance choices, right?
---
This is how Olmeca Gold thinks and it’s frustrating. He wants CCP to make whaling effortless for the attackers because he’s not part of a null bloc. 
---
I’m glad local is gone because of its impact on botting. As a consequence though, a lot of null ratting isn’t even worth the risk anymore. Now you can sit cloaked with 60 cancer bombers nobody can even know are there, kill literally anything they want, and jump out without incurring fatigue to do it again in 15 minutes. 
---
I’m sure Olmeca wants less EHP on caps too. Like, eat a dick mate.

---
11:18 is when you should have broadcast for reps :P
---
just "adapting" before dying
---
Realistically, this is it. Talk to anyone who started since the introduction of Skill Injectors and they don't understand the issue, because they weren't there to see Eve before skill injectors, and easily obtainable SP is just something they've always had access to.
---
Same goes for any of the other changes that we can see had an impact: the players who joined (or got into nullsec) after those changes were made are going to have a really hard time adapting because they don't remember belt ratting in a Caracal for 8m/hr or mining that Caracal in a Merlin.
---
Neat, one instance. So we will ignore the super coalitions and all the other shitty things?
---
Well no one else is using it so
---
no, literally open a chat with them and say o7, and then politly ask for advice
---
Bud eve 2 major issues :               
---
* injectors                
---
* excavators               
---
Did CCP removed those issues?
---
Higsec and alpha players
---
&gt;maybe if dropping caps to discourage harrassing them wasn't the optimal play style
---
If you play like that, then you don't get to complain about the game stagnating.  The same way I don't get to bitch about not having a cake if I decided to smash the cake with a hammer.
---
CCP messed up by making it too easy for players, letting them grew fat, lazy, and scared of the dark.
---

Exactly. This is nothing to do with the players.

The ability to seal holes is an important part of jspace and its balanced by the fact that hostiles can lock you out of your hole if they want to evict you. The more of a loot pinata you are the more likely it will happen

Please bring back combat refitting CCP, especially now with all the nerfs to capitals. All the kids who whine about it being OP can eat a dick. They got more than enough of what they wanted with all the recent changes.
---
when goons entire playstyle is "lets slowly drive everyone else to quit, so we can win more" then yes, making goons quit is beneficial.

Still better than most pvp occuring In nullsec atm

Which one? I can't find one that will let me
---
nah too far out.
---
Brave doenst leave it´s staging system anymore.
---
Depends. In this case the yellow glass is polarised (Whoppa wormhole style) and filters out most of the blue light. Thus red and a little overkill of yellow remains.  ;)
---
CCP sold itself for 300+ million dollars, pretty sure they'll be fine too.
---
I don’t know how I feel about this.
---
Its a good life lesson for you: Just because you *can* do a thing doesn't mean you **should** do that thing.
---
the people that owned CCP will be fine you mean.

Trig invasion shit has decimated highsec too, because you can randomly lose your ship to instalocking insane dps frigate rats.

At the suscription loss rate being reported already Hilmar might as well name a capital mining module after himself. He'll be the only one using a capital miner.
---
Yes, im sure if we just rolled over, and let PL be the elite rulers of EVE they were born to be, everything would be fine.
---
Well before Rorqs were out in the field, they were just parked in a POS giving remote boosters to Skiffs multiple AUs away. I can see Rorqs needed a bit of love since they were forced to come out of their POSs and get on grid. So I guess the question is which is worse, having the shiny big ship on grid (so you need the predictable fleet types of a predictable size to take it down) or having the shiny big ship untouchable and a few guys with a Stratios or many other variations coming in and popping off Exhumers
---
I sold them because im a guy with just 1 account and 1 character       i dont want alts   eve is already expensive enough as it is
---
Bull.  CCP would only be at 100% fault if the playerbase were half-witted automatrons without a braincell between them, or the game mechanics made it impossible to do anything but.
---
But sadly, players are thinking people.  So are still responsible for their own actions.  No matter how much they do something that hurts themselves, complain that it hurts, then refuse to do anything to fix it.
---
Is the game too stagnate for you because you joined a group that has 1/3rd of the playerbase blued?  Then leave that group, find a smaller group that has less friends and start shooting people.
---
Hot take: all the people posting about how all they want/like is salt are trash human beings, in general.
---
The thing with these changes is that they are not meant to help small groups or beginners, hence the Malcanis low does not apply.
---
Here the changes are made to hurt large alliances or cap owner. And no law has been proven for this. It might very well be that something that hurt large alliances will benefit small groups.
---
I like how you can visit EVE offline, click the 1Y button, see the average, then click the 1W or 36H button and see the average, but people are so in denial of reality, they claim what you are saying isn't true.
---
oO so this is a troll posting right?
---
in case it isnt :
---
so you decided to take an obviously dangerous route and died in the process. and now its ccps fault ?
---
rancer is cancer, this mantra has been sung for years now.
---
also , checking your route before u take gates,may help( you know zkill, dotlan...all that stuff)
---
or use a ceptor scout alt. 
---
it also helps to wait a bit while gatecloaked after jumping, so your machine can compute all the things on grid and such, before u instantly try to panic warp/hit cloak...and then wonder why game reacts weird, laggy, delayed...we all been there trust me.
---
its actually a bit sad , having to explain stuff like this to some hauler dude. you should know all that stuff. esp the dangerous routes through certain areas ( they have been dangerous for years now) .
---
o/ 
---
htfu.
---
and then have more fun.
---
That's my mother.  If I cook her dinner and hide the salt, she throws a tantrum to find it.  I am tempted to cook her something so overwhelmingly salty just to see her go for the salt.

PS - Yeah.  I know this is an EVE post. Go fuck yourselves you h8ters.

Easier? More isk?

burners in HS net you 100-200 mil per hour with ONE character.
---
lvl5 in lowsec nets you 500mil - 1bil with two characters.
---
FW lvl4 500mil - 1bil per hour. More if you got more pullers.
---
NULL Ratting in a subcap is 80mil per hour AT BEST
---
NULL ratting in a carrier 120 per hour maybe less after all the nerfs.
---
NULL Supercarrier 300 per hour? or is it 250 after all nerfs.
---
Rorq is around 100 mil per hour i believe.
---
DEDs around 300 hour.
---
Regular\Super carriers require constant attention and management of your fighters.
---
Why is everyone thinks that nullsec is some ISKPRINTING machine? That shit SUCKS.
---
Here is a good gaming life lesson: Players will always use and abuse mechanics to the fullest extend. It's CCP's task to correct the mechanics and balance the game, and they have not successfully done that for years.
---
this " smear" was just me watching that guy docking his myrm squad in theran alliance structures everytime he went safe. vOv.
---
so i didnt say anything wrong. did  i?
---
You see, I'm not really a retard, just merely pretending.
---
What? How is 15mil isk per tick becomes more then 15mil isk per tick?
---
Wormholes does as much ratting as NULL atm while having like 5% of population. good shit.
---
&gt; as well as bringing back the missing gameplay in some form, those are ways to combat the decline and bring in fresh blood.
---
Indeed. CCP is way too risk averse (/business reasons) and slow (/not enough manpower) with rebalancing playstyles. Active Playstayles are always in competition with each other and if there are a few that are clearly superiour the rest will suffer. Which often has not so obvious secondary effects
---
There is also, as you said, people trying different playstyles once they are bored of one. But if the new one is just a worse choice they will stop playing altogether. 
---
Many people got bored of nullsec-blob life after a few years and then went on to NPC-null, lowsec or WHs where they could use their experience, learn new stuff and actually matter. It was harder, took more time and commitment but was also more rewarding, fun- and isk-wise. But that is just not the case anymore.
---
One example are VNIs being the most OP and most commonly used ship by a mile for years. It made sure Gallente LP were always high and over time fucked up the entire FW region. Less activity led to pirates loosing content too and then you throw in bored null-blocs to drive everyone out for good.
---
Same with WHs: The optimal way to play is being part of a big group so you can get PvP content (which smaller groups can´t get since they cannot kill multiple caps, the now normal playstyle) while solo-farming C5s.
---
CCP needs several balance teams bringing in fresh air into playstyles (that includes ships and module rebalancing) in addition to the big changes that are required to keep the most OP ways in check.
---
seriously. i'm at the point where i want mods to start deleting these fucking doomsaying threads.
---
you don't play? FINE. SHUT THE FUCK UP. OTHERS DO.
---
How was that at all related with what I wrote?
---
Excavators only became an issue *because* of injectors. If injectors were not a thing, not everybody and their damn dogs would skill up for rorquals since the return would have been a very long wait, when they already had carriers and could rat for return rate far higher than the rorqual. The mentality of "omg, you are a miner? disgusting!" would have continued instead of what it became because of injectors, "OMG?! You DON'T HAVE A RORQUAL? You fucking idiot!"
---
We've had one of the most fun nights in EVE for a long time yesterday. Ironically because frigate pilots thought it's a good idea to come to delve with the recent cyno changes.       
---
Don't base your decision to play on r/eve. See what's in it for you.
---
No, it's, ccp's fault for making a product where the optimal way to play is the result we have now.
---
You aren't responsible as a player for ccp's short sighted development.
---
Serious question: If you liquidate your stuff, why do you leave? Why not try something new in EVE, with all the isk you got?
---
once again another free intel tool just what we need
---
Death to all free intel tools
---
HEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP FUCKING KRABBING AND DO SOMETHING.
---
THE STAGNATION IS YOUR FUCKING FAULT TOO.
---
GO ATTACK TEST. GO ATTACK INIT. GO ATTACK US IN LOWSEC AGAIN. DO SOMETHING. ANYTHING. YOU USELESS FUCKING KRABS.
---
Show me one comment that says "it's only bots leaving".
---
CCP implementing these changes, STAT.
---
It's not just the skill requirements. For small corps and solo players (with alts) they now have to risk \~300mill per jump.
---
we don NEED old players to show them the ropes. there is enough there for them to make something new for themselves
---
Best change that CCP can do is to come back at the POS-moon system (with the rafinery if they want). Moon must be passive income so the alliance / player have something to fight about. Also passive ISK help elite pvp. It s not bad. If people want to krab in rorqual they still can do it in the standard mineral.
---
yes bring back the triage carrier and change the role of the fax not sure what too but i do like the looks of the hulls
---
Lowest resist is explosive, you can see it in the Attributes panel - Gila might work differently due to the specific damage bonuses. All NPCs have resistance info now.
---
On par with the quality of the "in rust we trust" skin line.
---
I don't think even capital sized mods are even big enough for the colossal quantities of salt being spewed.
---
They could have done everything they did to the rorq but leave the excavators out. Even with Miner 2 the rorq should at most have been significantly below exhumers to disincentivize multiboxing them.       
---
Boosting chars weren't starving before, people saw to that.       
---
It would have been mostly fine on the mineral front. 
---
That doesn't touch the problems citadels introduced with sotiyos having virtually unlimited super-building capacity and their cluttering as well as their cancerous timer system, of course.
---
saw that in tenal.
---
Youbspeak lile hilmar is the one in charge and not pa.
---
I used to but cheap-ass tomatoes in winter which basically had no taste whatsoever, so I just salted the fuck out of them to make *some* kind of taste.
---
Apply this to EVE how you will
---
Uh, notepad.
---
Just type it...
---
If it requires coding consider yourself sol
---
Well yep, but you cannot ignore excavator issue.        
---
I know that under blackout they simply die - but the problem is with multiboxing them.    
---
Like i know that supers make a lot of isk, and isk is worst for new eden than injecting materials - but you simply could not multibox supers, but you can easily multibox 20 rorquals.
---
All numbers are from my experience running a couple dozen sites. If one is in system, another one will respawn ~1 min after completing the existing one. Easy to chain farm with an MTU &amp; dedicated salvager ship, or a ship that can fit ~4 salvager in high (like the Orca).
---
Shortly after warping in at 0, a first wave spawns in the black portal thingie in the center, 4-5 ships, mix of Damaviks and Kikimoras.
---
Waves 2 and 3 spawn as soon as the previous one is completed.
---
Wave 2 can have a faction Kiki spawn, and has 4-7 ships. Haven't seen any cruisers in Wave 2 yet.
---
Wave 3 always has a Zorya's Vedmak, and about 10 ships total, but no cruisers otherwise.
---
All ships except Vedmak orbit within 10 km which can be useful for locking them down.
---
There's significant drone aggro, the smaller the hull size the more drone aggro (for context: almost never switched to light/medium drones on Orca, almost always switched to both light and medium drones on T3C). I've lost maybe 2 drones on Orca and ~30 on T3C.
---
Overall, really easy to farm in an Orca.
---
The sites themselves are made up of asteroid belts - Talassonite. It's high volume (16 m3 apiece) but yields megacyte and zydrine besides a significant amount of trit.
---
The belt does not despawn when the site is completed, I've mined after the signature was gone for at least 15 minutes.
---
As others have indicated, the site award 4.5m ISK and 300 DED LP upon destruction of the last NPC.
---
Notable loot: mutaplasmids (seen decayed and gravid), trig survey databases, filaments (low tier though), trig T2 research skill books.
---
Imagine thinking a game is better when you don't know its rules.
---
Yeah, that's the saddest part
---
Perhaps. How were they going to defend those small alliances? Seems like a huuuuge pain in the ass.
---
And if it becomes prevalent, you can pretty much add in mechanics that make it completely impossible for two alliances to be friends in null. Add in an incredible amount of downsides to alliances as they get bigger, but also make fracturing impossible, and you create a situation where smaller groups actually do get the advantage.
---
&gt;Hilly,
---
stopped reading
---
You guys thought it was ok when you were causing beginners to quit via recruitment scams, TS3 harrasment of people, your leader asking members to pressure someone to kill themselves irl, Burn Jita, Miniluv ganking etc
---
Why are you so surprised that people will give zero fucks if you all did quit?
---
&gt; Sure, there's a problem, but it's not only CCP's fault.
---
Yes it fucking is. You can't blame players for playing the game as efficiently as possible.
---
Sorry, I think you are pointing in the wrong direction. Many of the people complaining about the current changes agree with change being needed. The problem is the stick instead of the carrot. Don't nerf my play style, improve the "niche" one. Add stuff, don't just delete. If this was truly a well thought thing CCP would have implemented systems that would have promoted those play styles without totally trashing what you call the "status quo". You know like wormwholes vs k-space. But that takes thinking, vision, and oh my a shit load of effort. If you would actually employ those qualities you wouldn't even had such a bad status quo to begin with.
---
What all the people complaining of the current changes are saying is that CCP decided to cater for a small, potentially frugal and actually just potential minority while thoroughly alienating the majority. I have people in my corp that did nothing but solo/small gang pvp that are now letting their subscription lapse, so not even the niche is that happy. 
---
I don't have a solution to the game problems, but what I can tell you for sure is that in the last few years the design decisions of this game showed a profound lack of vision and proper impact analysis. It all seems like a continuous  knee-jerk reaction (put something unbalanced in, do a lot of damage by having horrible reaction times, put something equally bad but opposite to "compensate" for the initial screw-up. What my personal feeling about the latest changes is that they just took their usual approach to extremes. 
---
To be honest I truly wonder if it is a: we need to make this amount of money to get our bonus, no we are not gonna get that this way, let's just risk it all and if the game dies too bad, let PA deal with the carcass.
---
For soloing burner missions in highsec, this guide covers more or less everything you could want to know: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAv6bnGM-5etLoPHxVtCsbsz8Q8feN5CFSEgUZclPLI/pub
---
For regular Level 4 missions, look at eve-survival - the content there is old, but missions haven't changed much at all for a long time: https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReportsLevel4
---
What new people? You are losing thousands a month and gaining around 200 every 3 months.
---
Ah, a recording would have been too perfect, but thank you for helping create such a wonderful story to tell! Wish you and the rest of Bounty Contracting the best of luck in things
---
" Alright, then. Let's remove botting from the EULA. " 
---
He didn't misrepresent a damn thing. He addresses the first fucking thing you mentioned, that's not a strawman argument, that's directly related to the first words out of your mouth.
---
How did you get this far, if this is what it takes, to make you quit?
---
Turning inanimate objects into girls is anime in itself.
---
He's the one with the burden of proof, not me
---
Ironically the game was in much healthier state when input broadcasting was still explicitly allowed. 
---
Now you just have a load of bots doing the exact same thing with no players sitting behind the screen.
---
you're the one who is failing to understand basic game mechanics you chose to talk about the burden of proving you are not ignorant as fuck of game mechanics is now on you.
---
a Cyno is a module that can make a beason of sorts that certain ships can jump to. 
---
basically everybody in something expensive and in a big null-sec alliance would want one, so friends can quickly help you if you are being attacked.
---
Now, CCp(the company behind EVE) made an update that limited the ships that can use a Cyno.
---
I've only ever seen WH dread farmers boast about their income and how fast you turn a profit after accounting for losses.      
---
When people say they struggle to do that, they get made fun of because they can't follow the most basic rules of wormhole life to crab in relative safety (not total, but well in line with the rewards at the very least).     
---
When you look at the MER it is staggering to me how close wormhole income is to nullsec considering the imbalance of people doing it.
---
Nullsec desperately needed the hit (even if I don't fully embrace the how we got there),       
---
But wormholes seem to be a close 2nd to me.
---
That reminds me about a story regarding WWII aircraft and where to reinforce the armor. They initially considered armoring where they saw bullet holes. But someone brilliant pointed out that these are spots where the aircraft took fire but survived, they wheren't seeing the places where the aircraft was hit and didn't.
---
Parts of (not all of) your 1st paragraph is exactlly why CCP need to shake things up.
---
If a group has all that they are not a small group anymore. 
---
Small groups do not have enough unemployable mouth breathers or window lickers in their groups to set up and run that kind of infrastructure.
---
Eve is a game for most people - not a lifestyle.
---
Even 6B a day after losses is way more than is possible in nullsec, wouldn't you say?
---
The big difference, aside from all the other points made in this thread about risk, is that our anoms don't respawn in our system instantly. So sure we might make significant isk/hour, but you have to take into account that we can only do that in a given hole a few times a week at most, versus 24/7 availability of sites in nullsec.
---
Spicy
---
Supercapital slug fests are valuable to some degree, but they don't justify the degree of proliferation. B-R took months for the empires to rebuild their supercapital stashes, but with keepstars allowing infinite storage of titans and supers battles like X47 (which technically had more titan deaths over the two timers) get left by the wayside as they are literally less meaningful than their historical equivalents.
---
That's fine, if you can afford a titan, you can afford a 300m throwaway..
---
I was cooking cheburek with a friend and misread the ingredients... cue 3 tablespoons of salt instead of 3 teaspoons. I’m not trusted with the salt since then
---
Sure ok but any proof of these supposed hordes of bots running... what, highsec anomalies? L4 missions? Incursions? Remains to be seen
---
And something that kind of makes sense. If I attack a krabber and get jumped by a response fleet bigger than me, what do they think I'll do? Particularly if I'm flying a pretty blingy T3C or some such. It's dumb not to run.
---
Oh yhea, it would have still been an issue even then, players told ccp that going drones or capital miners would only lead to N+1, it was repeated again and again to go fighters, since fighters put a very hard soft cap to what legitimate players can 
---
do. 
---
Hulks are already something people view as being to action heavy, but even those have one action every 2-3 minutes. How many hulks can **most** people multi box comfortably? how many Rorquals with fighters could people handle if it required an action every 1 minute?  But nope, we got something that was easy to scale, in a system that was easy to just inject another rorq. 
---
So even with the excavator issue, it wouldn't have been as a big problem as it is now. Each round of nerfs could not be responded with "I'll just train a new rorqual to counter this loss!" as easily. If anything it would have been met with reduction of rorquals because funny enough, exhumers would have been more economically viable than to just train a new rorqual alt from scratch. It takes a long time to train a rorqual from scratch into a mining powerhouse, hobo skilled rorqual with minimal skills to fly and mine are so bad hulks runs paces around them. Only benefit they have is a large ore bay.
---
For real? Great news then.
---
Your alliance/sov ideas are terrible.
---
Setting player count or isk value as a constraint to something will always be inefficient.
---
Do you actually believe alliance limit is something that cannot be circumvented and will prevent a blue donut form coordinating?
---
well  doctor that  f-ked up  surgeon has been fired.
---
Ordaaaaah!
---
The biggest thing that can come threw a covert cyno is a blops, the biggest thing from a normal cyno a titan.
---
Small diffrence id say.
---
This one is not amongst the smartest botters, is he?
---
What are the new rules?
---
Bots are 'players' too now?
---
I'd like to congratulate all the idiots who thought numbers bloated by cheaters with thousands of characters are healthy for the game.
---
Oh perfect ! Thanks
---
Why always nerf? why not make some new dynamicly spawned resources that are worth fighting for. They could be rats / complexes / minerals that change region or w/e every 6 months or so, or year w/e. No need to nerf the current ones..........
---
Yeah, but logging my inbincible, capital printing 10 rorqual and indy alts is so healthy for the game.
---
Much disater, so death!
---
I fail to see how
---
&gt;Alright, then. Let's remove botting from the EULA.
---
Somehow means
---
&gt;it's all bots that are leaving the game
---
The point that I was making was that if we really want to focus on the PCU to the exclusion of every other consideration then we should just allow botting, because that will inflate the PCU. I made no mention of whether or not the players leaving were "all bots".
---
You're a moron.
---
That's not a ship. It's weeb fantasy
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
WANGS being a null alliance would be news to me, these guys are the cancer of gallente lowsec
---
in an ideal world, smaller, weaker groups would be able to beat larger more powerful groups.
---
as then the smaller groups would get bigger, then start loosing to the smaller group. unfortunately this is not possible.
---
if your in a small group, you choose to be the underdog, the weak. the outnumbered, the broke no money group. be proud of that dont cry.
---
if your in a null bloc i can assure you it is affecting and challenging larger groups. theyre just where all the power, get up and go, idea makers are.
---
You could outrange Slowcats and sort-of deal with them with Maelstroms if you were a god w/ that doctrine. They were still oppressive, but there were a few things you could do against them with subcaps, which don't work vs modern caps/scaps.
---
Very well said, I would add that we’re in this position because of faulty conscience decisions by CCP to expand one region of space at the expense of all others.  It’s almost painful to watch.
---
hello lowsec ganker pilot #4756
---
or theyre so used to feeling lost they dont mind it...
---
Its a fucking capital ship my boy. You've been spoiled but thats basically the highest class of ships. You're basically complaining that other ships are economically viable now. ?????
---
How dares he not consult the Carebear community!
---
!
---
Part of the cap proliferation issue is solo players can move caps across the galaxy in relative safety. Now you have to enlist the help of your small alliance to move the cap. If you're truly solo what are you doing with a cap that's not gating it for dank fights? Farming LP in lowsec most likely which means you can afford the 300mil cyno tax.
---
Also add a minimum M3 per item filter.
---
Someone could bridge some haulers around looking for larger items to loot.
---
make fracturing impossable.....
---
i think the only way to do this would be structure docking rights, but removing the ability to add or remove people from ACL's, and have it set to allow alliance mates only, would destroy hisec citadels....so thats also good.
---
but all in all what you want, ive thought about a few months back, its not possable to enforce such a thing. there is 1000's of ways around it. even down to just getting used to not shooting certain alliance tickers.
---
"Waaaaah!!! I can't dock instantly when some neut appears in system and can't be bother to scan them in my dscan waaaaah!"
---
damn immagen unironicly thinking a roaming destroyer gang needs to be ready to fight a titan fleet
---
So you want CCP to make casual pubbies excel over elite hard-workers? 
---
Eve has never been for "Most people".
---
Live in high sec then bud. Higher risk higher reward. That's what null is about.
---
&gt; not even mentioning recent OP triglavian T2 frigate 
---
A-a-and that's the right thing for you to not mention it, this way your post is a bit less retarded.
---
Overall still it is quite retarded anyway. For more info you probably had to contact someone who does missions in npc null and ask them before posting.
---
Hilmar says a lot. That doesn't per se make it true.
---
I never find my way out once I end up in ine
---
wow you lived there in so much comfort :D no mic, no voice, no proper fits, etc :D now i see why you crying all day in r/Eve since chaos era beginned.
---
working as intended...done burner talos with  ZEALOT.  
---
we need burner oracles,burner battleships aswell and burner capitals
---
it perfectly explains why every other playstyle other than elite femtogangz must die, that's exactly how wormholers talk constantly.
---
The very fact that the game is dangerous and loss hurts makes friendship valuable in EVE. If it was like retail WoW where loss and working together doesn't matter you'd never create anything with other people.
---
You should treat loss as a learning experience and adjust your fits to make it unprofitable for people to gank you. That's the only thing you can reasonably do when you're playing solo and there will still be people who will gank you anyway for fun. This is fine.
---
Yall ran out of groups to wipe
---
Some JF pilots seem to haul huge amounts of salt now. The fuck are you meaning with those T1 indy haulers?
---
The only change I see is that JF pilots, that we all live btw, will have to increase the rates, because the price will include frequent cov ops ship losses. That's pretty much the whole difference.
---
Stop being whiny bitches and git gud.
---
oh, was that the public blopsec fleet? looks like everyone had some fun.
---
In LS, NS, and WH 99% of time if you see someone he will try to kill you or disapear if he thinks you are stronger :=)
---
Wormholer weighing in.  Leave your neighbor's umbrella alone.  Stay out of your neighbor's yard if you don't want to get shot.  Your neighbor has more property than you do because your neighbor and his family earned it over time following the same sets of rules paid before you.  If you're looking for a fight you can take or shit you can steal and sell, come to wormhole space.  If not, stay in k-space, but stop suggesting CCP nerf your neighbor's property.  Settle your differences with your neighbors, not the police.
---
Anyone can warp into a pocket. Once someone decloaks they have a timer before they can lock you up, and then they have a lock timer. If you were not paying attention to your overlay, thats why you died. I died like this recently in a hacking site. I can attest to this.   
---
As for being seconds away from death, there's police in high sec. Just like when you walk down the street (irl, idk if you've been there, pretty scary place tbh) someone could just decide to stab you. Whats stopping them? Police. High sec has police. They pay a price to attack you. If you venture off to areas where there is no protection, PROTECT YOURSELF OR LEARN TO PROTECT YOURSELF.
---
*laid before you. Stupid autocorrect
---
i mean yeah dude, big numbers are big numbers, there isn't much i can say about that. if they need to be smaller, make them smaller. my point is that wh is a whole different animal than null.
---
&gt; phychotic genocidal terrorists, who's sole purpose is to cause grief and hatdship to others 
---
That's nice compliment.
---
Have you thought about getting good? Try to get at least one solo kill and you will know why people play for pvp.
---
Btw
---
&gt;playing in pvp game  
---
&gt;getting pvp'ed  
---
&gt;refuse to pvp
---
What is your problem dude?
---
Gee if only the mechanics didn't make this a complete, total waste of time.
---
Nah what we need is to punish players even more for wanting to do anything, thats gonna bring the people back i tell you.
---
I highly doubt Hilmar has the skills to PVP in Eve.
---
You're complaining you could be punched when you're opponent was being killed every single time. If you do not see the imbalance in that, you're just looking for a free ride.
---
If troll: Well done, nice post.
---
If not: Shut the fuck up, carebear. Games are supposed to have risk, go play WoW. Classic just came out!
---
I mean yeah, of course they try to kill you. Simply the appearance that you do L4's indicate:
---
* no bait (especially after a look on the Killboard)
---
* no web/scram
---
* in case of Battleships -&gt; very low DPS once the light drones are dealt with
---
* in case of Battleships -&gt; slow align so easy to catch
---
* often enough blingy fitted
---
&gt;asked them for some help restoring my ship or at least leaving me alone because I was now broke
---
And as it is memed often enough: Don't fly soemthing you cannot affort to lose
---
If you mean basic human nature is to demand a free ride, then yes. In that case as well, society will fall.
---
And what if they want it this way, fine with how are things going?
---
What if other players don't share your stance? What if you are deluded and most players from *nu*\-sec on /eve are hysterical and shouldn't be taken seriously?
---
We need a tag for all the posts about player counts or simply informing us OP doesn't like the changes so we can filter them out.
---
The first post in months from you that had some merit. I haven’t upvoted but I haven’t downvoted either. You can chalk that up as a win.
---
If you hadn’t spent the 2nd half whinging I’d have given you that upvote! Keep at it
---
if you are a goon when you joined your corp, they made you join a forum, all of the rules and such are on there, as well as updates.  If not then, send a spy and do some KB research, Im not going to make it that easy on you
---
remember  90% of playerbase  are immature dicks.  they  only care about their killboard.they just  count kills and dont care about others.this is eve.. well once i  had friend in real life,we were playing from time to time,i was in talos and he was carrying blueprints in his enyo and he targetted me,sine i had in game options to auto target 5 targets  by accident i press F1 and realized what happened....he lost approx  4b. thats how lost irl friend xD
---
I am talking about burner frigates bud .... oh yes didn't put this in the title.
---
" I used to play it to run missions and rat. "
---
You can do this playstyle in low populated high-sec regions to reduce chance to be ganked. Also you shouldn't fly with a very shiny ship if you can't afford to loose it. That's one of the main rules of EVE.
---
Can you do us all a favour and not post here while you do? Thanks.
---
Rat in a ship capable of lighting a Covert Cyno. 
---
Have a defence fleet of Blops.
---
Problem solved, as you can bring any class of ship they can.
---
Understand your point.  But...
---
Without the danger, without the PvP, the ratting PvE side of Eve is just another MMO-grind-and-waste-your-time game.  You earn the next ship up from a Dominix (battleship), like a Golem (marauder), rat with that, then rat with a carrier, and then what?  You stop playing because the game is too easy and you're bored, and the value of your ships slip away.  I'll gladly take the value of your ships and their modules now, thank you very much.  It's a pirate's life for me, laddy.
---
Kek 420 post karma and 4.20k comment karma. I feel like I should do something about this. PM me for corpses giveaway, idk.
---
Save it for the future tho
---
Would be a nice touch to the ui but I am of the opinion that if you don't know the in game name of your cyno you shouldn't be jumping to it. The act of jumping a cap is inherently risky so you should know who you're jumping to and where in the system they are at before you do it.
---
This sub is always screeching about eve dieing one way or another, if you have the itch to play just come back and check it out.
---
Guess I‘ll not make money anymore vOv

Players have to take some credit for creating the blue donut. It is by definition player created. This empire building malarkey and the view that the majority hold of not wanting to lose some space pixels means empires are to risk averse to attack neighbouring empires. So they blue. Remove asset safety remove ansiplex jump gates sort citadel timer mechanics and remove their offensive capabilities and we will be closer to content then ever before.
---
Just like people aren't responsible for smashing up their kids ADHD medicine and snorting it up their nose. The drug makers should have known people would steal their kid's medicine and snort it. Better to have never made medicine at all.
---
I'm sorry, I just don't see how super coalitions are "shitty". Those coalitions are the reason Karmafleet can get a fight. If just Karmafleet, one corporation, shows up ANYWHERE, it takes a mega coalition of other alliances to have a hope of forming up similar numbers (both in subcaps and titans). 
---
If zkill didn't exist then I think people would form larger corporations and alliances, and not have coalitions of alliances. But back in the day everyone wanted to be the king of their own molehill (ie the one who embellished the moongoo from their corp/alliance moons, to fly shiny supercapitals). Now they just want to embellish the renting income and bounty taxes. 
---
Super coalitions have also always existed. 
---
The only shitty mechanic in the game right now: Fozziesov, remote reps and damage caps (Oh, and shitty cyno mechanics). 
---
That SP exists is also shitty, because when you compare the SP+hull+fitting price of dreads vs titans, then titans are better. But if everyone could step into capitals because there was no capital skills, then you could SRP like 45 dreads for the cost of one titan, so everyone would put EVERY SINGLE omega alt into a dread and we would have X47 fights with 1500 dreads instead of 1500 ewar frigs. If capital SP was removed then capitals would be balanced as hell, EVERYONE could dreadbomb every supercapital fleet into dust (it takes very little time to mine a dread cache).
---
You're comparing somebody misusing a products to players playing the game in its given state.
---
The equivalent isn't some one misusing a product, the equivalent is the product being poison rather than medicine.
---
Created as a direct result of how the mechanics dictate.
---
Real world is full of sheep so in some regards you aren’t wrong.
---
I have to say that 99% of these "This fixes the game" type of posts are just bad. A lot of them are just ideas thought out in less than 5 minutes. Mainly these ideas are just "don't nerf my gameplay activity, instead nerf this other guy's gameplay".
---
I have my own ideas how to "fix the game" but they are retarded and i acknowledge that.
---
Because only "sheep" go along the path of least resistance right?
---
Solo and small gang players unsubbing? That’s a reach
---
A very excellent post.
---
One thing makes me think though: everyone talks about how players who cater to a playstyle should return to compensate for those who leave. But I think this is missing how there is a large audience for new players who like risks and the endless opportunities of a game like eve. A few years ago harsh games featuring survival and ruthlessness were all over the place. Paradoxically eve went on a trend to please players from the opposite playstyle, the greedy who like to amass wealth, when this style of mmo was on a downward trend. To me this was a big strategic mistake from ccp.
---
Player retention is a big problem with eve and guess ccp capitalized on the ability of large nullbloc to be better for it. But the problem really is how the game can retain those that will be the other side of the spectrum. As you said, eve is an ecosystem that needs everyone to work well.
---
I think the entry point for these players should be low sec and FW, and npc nullsec. The question is how the game can direct players there? There's a lot to learn for these activities and these environments are very harsh.
---
" There are so many posts discussing what is wrong with Eve right now, each offering their own magical solution to the problem. "
---
I haven't seen these kind of posts.
---
" the likelihood of anything posted on reddit being taken seriously by CCP is quite low anyway."
---
thank God.
---
" they know the era of chaos isn't fixing all the problems "
---
they don't know yet, it just had begun.
---
" *asking for our help*. "
---
:D
---
what are you NOT engaging lol? awesome video!
---
yeah, i always think someone finally posted something interesting and then.... :D
---
If _the_ (emphasis on the) problem is stagnation, then _any_ change is a good change.
---
But it's very clear that not all changes are good. So the problem itself isn't stagnation.  
---
So I think something else (or even multiple things) is the problem. 
---
I think diametrically opposed play styles is a contributing factor. And problems arise from gameplay mechanics that don't satisfy all players groups equally.
---
we cannot allow those filthy peaseants from nullsec to come and go as they please without passing checkpoints! We need a wall!
---
Business fails, blame in on the customers. ROFL
---
&gt;thats how lost irl friend xD   
---
If that's true it's absolutely pathetic. Since it's an Amakboma comment i have justified doubts that it's true though.

It is cute, that some noobs have discovered the site Eve-Offline and know how to quote the numbers in there (some even know how to take a screenshot), but it is giving normal people a brain aneurysm after reading the same thread for the 5-th time today.
---
il be honest i was happy to finish from work come home and rat in my super for a couple of hours i enjoyed it forgetting about everything else in my life and just ratting away in my super and then CCP had the bright idea of blackout and the cyno changes and i was done it was my favorite game for 10 years but now im back playing classic and because of what CCP and PA have done i wont be back.

Try, ITS ANOTHER ACCOUNT AND A SUPER CAPITAL SHIP. SOCIALIZE. MAKE FRIENDS.
---
People dont gank your ship mainly because they want to grief you. If you go to low security areas and get killed well... i dont know what you expected. What comes to highsec ganks that's just someones way of doing isk and your fault of undocking something too expensive.
---
[I believe you](https://youtu.be/prw2B_03IzY)

I however am really a retard for allowing me to have a glimpse of faith in humanity in a state of intoxication and overestimate  the morality of you guys. I think i already said something along those lines somewhere else in this thread though.
---
I'm happy CCP has their on internal direction again. They've released plenty of features but haven't had a vision or any real leadership for the game as a whole since at least 2015, except maybe the vision of selling injectors. They've been running it as a theme park MMO like Warframe or Star Trek Online. Dangle an overpowered endgame carrot in front of people and sell them boosts. 3 years later the economy and metagame are both ruined, good stuff. 
---
In software development we call that technical debt, here I guess it's design debt. Or greed debt or something. Either way it's all come to a head and there's no gentle way out of it.
---
delete this

anything with webs + some dps, dual web armor jags for instance :D

Reset Eve

Let it die.
---
i am from vietnam but i live in iraq,im not amakboma or anything you imaginate,last week  someone burned our car.
---
should be a fat neckbeard  
---
you should do more tho its really good, may i suggest a muninn?
---
So you want me to get a friend to just sit in his recon for hours waiting for something to happen? There's a reason these things are usually alts.
---
The blue donut is clearly misuse.
---
You are making it harder but making it not worth it to do at the same time?
---
What's that, weaponised inconvenience?
---
Those do not worry me.
---
&gt;It's weird that bots are still leaving.
---
Maybe CCP banned some.
---
No, it isn't. That's the natural result of ccp's design.
---
Just like snorting ADHD pills is a natural result of their design.
---
Your idea of what Eve is supposed to be is wrong. There is no “too little too late” for you.
---
I tried those a while back.
---
They are indeed farmable. There are good guides on the internet, telling you exactly what fit to use vs what type of ship.
---
And still 11-12K of Caldari LP looked like trash to me once I tried to convert around 100k of them to mods and things to sell for isk. The face value is garbage and burners re not worth their time.
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah, he can not now comfortably and fairly 1v1 a HAW titan against assault frigate. Wtf?
---
They are not complaining because most of them has left or are inactive. Go in sov from small alliance you will see if you find target ;/
---
This gonna impact the player count :''''(
---
I am sure they take down Chinese copycat mobile games on a daily basis. ;)
---
New ones keep popping up in my Facebook ads though.
---
Burner missions were a great concept but what they are now is just another level 4 that you need specific ships for. 
---
I think having them as level 4s was a mistake. They should be 2 or level 3s that alpha pilots can fly without needing to spend 300m on a frig. New bros need as many ways of making a modest amount of isķ as possible. burners would be ideal alongside gas huffing, exploration and low teir abyssals .
---
worked for me to (old pc)
---
From my experience lp is getting shot by botters not human burner farmers.
---
Ok fam
---
If you were killed, it was because you went to an area of space where people PVP.. and there was an in game warning before you went there stating you probably will get shot at.  
---
No one Ganks a mission running domi in High Security space.
---
Citadel mechanics are fine.
---
Skill injectors are necessary.
---
Rorqs look great on kb 
---
Unlimited respawning anomalies weren’t designed for supercap mining.
---
P.S. nice salt
---
How does the cyno changes make small alliance not be blobable by bigger alliances?
---
Your a poopiehead     
---
Do you want me to spell it out ?
---
If Goons go on a purge/awox wave after the idiots in their alliance, there will be barely any players left. :thinking
---
If we remove GotG space from both before nad after, how does it look then?
---
Regardless, you made specific claims, I thought you'd have specific numbers with you?
---
Oh give me break, gangs hardly ever fight fleets. We hold KBP-7 which used to be one of the most vicious system in the entire eve as its direct HS &lt;-&gt; null gate. And everytime we tried to deal with gangs, they would just run to HS. Or, if nothing else, hug the gate, give some shots and if situation went badly for them, disengage, wait and jump out. Id say that maybe 10% on gangs actually were looking for fights rather then just some random picks.
---
Quality players hemorrhage right there.
---
If the op had a goonswarm tag it would all have made sence
---
Rat in a Black Ops, now you can even bring your umbrella as usual.
---
Remember. Init and test are at the same blue donut. They're shoot each other because there's nothing better to do. EVE 2019
---
In pencil and what size? Probably start at £40+pp, do the initial work and come back to you, if you wanted more done then there'd be a further charge and i'd do more work etc
---
Lol
---
How does that syntax work? I feel like you're just shooting off ideas without testing anything.
---
My man
---
Look at this noob, coming to /r/Eve and not even knowing what a mostly talked about module in last month is.
---
you brought up bots, a counter point on bots was made, the fact that you can't understand that 1 + 1 = 2 is not anyone's fault but your own.
---
The salt poisoning is too severe for this patient. :(
---
Tbh you don't get why a lot of veterans left the game. You think vets left because they could not crab or they could not pvp in large numbers . NO in all aspects . Citadels has been CCP's patch for the whole past year . This is CCP making a lot space "SAFE" . But to nerf the safety CCP is not reiterating on what made space safe on the first place(Citadels) but targeting different aspects of the game which made the space worthy of the lack of safety .
---
Do you see a sticky on this sub outlining the major issues? I don't. The game has been fucked up for years, but players still can't agree on the major issues.
---
CCP is definitely at fault, but a ton of retards simply want what is good for them regardless of damage to the game. It's possible for CCP to actually believe that the community is split on the injector issue.
---
If most people reading this sub stopped logging in, we could maybe get some real changes.
---
Who are you meeting next, Mr Ericader, Sir?
---
Apple's CEO, Jeff Bezos, POTUS?
---
I am sure they all can't wait to meet you and hear out your vision for this game.🤣
---
Well its a lot of stuff, and admittedly its been stolen from other players.  So where do you want my hot load?
---
Blue with TRI i think, but not sure.
---
I didn't call you a retard... you did that all on your own. And there has been a well documented rise of battleship miners and courier mission bots in highsec... as people have left nullsec for greener pastures.
---
&gt;Right now if attackers want something dead they can kill it. No matter what sort of defence the defenders have attackers can keep escalating and as it gets bigger and bigger more people jump into attack.
---
Simply not true, or Delve would have 0 Keepstars.
---
Under the "old" (as of yesterday?) cyno rules, both sides could escalate/commit with similar levels of risk. If anything the defender had more of an advantage as their tether-able structure was literally at 0 to the fight.
---
It was up to attacks and defenders alike to adequately prepare, deploy, etc. and the better prepared side would have the advantage.
---
Evidence A): the Imperium invasion of Tribute and environs. This was totally one-sided with Imperium staging, preparing, and deploying a colossal super fleet backed up by an appropriately unprecedented number of capitals and subcaps. The defenders could not hope to match it and had to cede territory.
---
Evidence B): the war in the south east between Legacy and Winter was going back and forth with subcap and cap fleets deployed and used on occasion. Neither side seemed to have a clear advantage, either side could win a fight either for objective or ISK or both. Structures could be deployed and destroyed by either side on a case by case basis depending on performance by each side on the night.
---
It is yet to be seen if either type of nullsec conflict can exist post-changes, but IMHO the real test will be to see if caps still see regular use in the south-east or if defenders can always reliably prevent attackers from being able to deploy. My fear is not the the Imperium can't glass regions, that's just something to do and not particularly epic capital PVP. My fear is wars like Winter vs. Legacy will be reduced to Munnins online, or worse still will grind to a halt completely when both sides realize structures can be defended by caps, but not attacked.
---
We shall see.
---
&gt;Yes, players playing the game with the mechanics that were given, have killed the game.
---
True, but they also wanted them. Particularly injectors. Goons thought this was good for the game.
---
Nice try, Mr. Rorqual multiboxer.
---
Try it out! Currently it sucks because you’re running into 1 of the 5 people that fly blinged out kill anything and everything fits. What would be awesome for Abyssal PvP and make it really shine is if a ton more people did it regularly. I’d definitely disagree with the minimal piloting skill though, some of these fights are the most intense fights I’ve ever had and they can drag on and the smallest mistake will doom you.
---
It is separate in the access lists, but they usually don’t miss it.
---
Why would goons want to attack you? Or any null blocs?
---
The space is worthless. More space means more effort needed to defend it, especially with the new mechanics. We don't really have a hatred for you. Or for TEST. The citadel mechanics and capital mechanics haven't changed so you would still be aiming to use cancerous citadel spam to fight a "battle" of attrition, not engaging us head on under our capital advantage.
---
You raid Goons space for that "good fight" which mostly just involves you blowing up krabbers. In your pursuit of l33tness you forgot that if we were to bring the fight to you, you wouldn't take it, because you will lose due to mechanics. And yet you are spewing shit about us being useless krabbers? I guess brains are a nice thing that not everyone has.
---
Closer to 420 RIGHT? XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
kill me
---
&gt;Let's hope it works.
---
It won't as the change isn't balanced.   
---
As you said, you need krabs for the hunters and having hunters for the krabs. Right now even hunters we often see are just dropping in activity as they tire of endlessly roaming for 30j to find a fight.
---
Literally onlyever heard 2 girls on comms in my 6 years of playing eve
---
&gt;It's CCP's task to correct the mechanics and balance the game, and they have not successfully done that for years.
---
I agree, but players need to speak with a somewhat unified voice when it comes to the major issues. The reality seems to be that a large chunk of of the community doesn't give a fuck as long as they can shoot red crosses more effectively.
---
" and the likelihood of anything posted on reddit being taken seriously by CCP is quite low anyway. " 
---
they seem to have no problem picking all the worst ideas up to implement.
---
&gt;a ton of retards simply want what is good for them
---
You mean... playing the game as it is given to us?
---
If that's the problem then ccp can solve that, change the game.
---
its ironic the same crowd who posted 4 threads a day for months that caps are OP now want people to stop posting 4 threads a day about how the server is actually hemorrhaging players at an increasing rate.
---
I should have said 'many eve players' and not 'most people'.
---
2kkk? what does that mean?
---
&gt;I'm happy CCP has their on internal direction again
---
Its just a shame that direction is directly into the nearest dumpster.
---
Emerging Conduits are a Combat site you can go and fight NPCs in (I think they contain Trigs)
---
Maybe we can get a sticky on this sub outlining the major issues? No? No. We are not there yet.
---
This community is like a bunch of disorganized protesters with no demands.
---
"I'm not here to ruin the game, I'm here to ruin your game."
---
Now I'm sure you could attempt to argue about becoming more mature, but really, goons and something awful in general has a reputation.
---
It is not about whining , but simple fact that people forget.     
---
Telling someone "adapt or die" as hes game-play is removed will not make such person to 'adapt' he will simply quit as a product is unappealing to him anymore.       
---
The problem is that EVE need players all kind of players.            
---
I am totally fine with the "PVE only people".          
---
You learn this after years of playing this game.                 
---
I don't say that you need to have those people in corp or even on blue list - but simply ingame or active.           
---
On top of the fact that you can hunt them, compete with them or work with them you can transfer to them all the activities you are find unappealing.          
---
Current CCP actions will only remove large group of players from game as the only thing CCP did is **removal of multiple gameplays** and making game more annoying.        
---
Like game should be fun not annoying especially game that have quite "old" player base.           
---
Look what happened :          
---
                
---
**Blackout**             
---
* PVE activities died in nullsec. ^(i hated vni like myrms now, rorquals and every thing you can do in passive way and you could afk scale it up ) CCP disabled local, but didn't disabled all the inputs so all people know when and where you do your PVE.              
---
* We lost ability to talk to others as you don't know who is in system. Like since blackout i got 1 convo and from a guy that docked with me in the same station.  ^(this is bad for MMO)         
---
* Lost a lot of targets, while it is linked to point 1, unless you go to blob zones ... eve nullsec is empty now, more empty than ever. While you always can visit Delve, if your goal was to take new recruits to "soft" zone ... well there is no "soft" zone now.              
---
To keep it short now the cyno changes.                
---
* Nomadic game style died. I know a guy that for years just moved around New Eden in his 2 carriers moving every few days to new area. He quit just before cyno changes as he was not able to do it anymore. He motivated this simply that he will not play in game where cyno ship cost 4 times more than his pvp ship.                
---
* JF hunting - it was post with details why                 
---
* small scale hot dropping - like you know what is cyno bait now           
---
* this guy with a single carrier or dread moving around             
---
Now bumping.           
---
* Most of people say "fuck gankers" but if you move 20bil in your freighter i don't see a reason you need to be safe in higsec.              
---
* Miner bumping .... most people don't know but higsec people used this to prevent randoms from mining moons they owned.          
---
* the only viable mechanic in higec that let you keep someone in specific place. While you can argue if this was good or bad thing ... **it was the only thing**
---
Plenty of goons were pointing out how absurdly broken injectors and rorquals are, but what are we supposed to do? Let our enemies win with them while we sit and do nothing?
---
Pull your head out of your ass.
---
At least this shitty meme was not in our corp chat this time....
---
yep first mission Damsel in Distress xD most of the ships look like eve ships with  some bonus stuff on it
---
Interesting, ofc now I can't find the recommendations that we give our rorq pilots on this.  I know it says something about keeping a recon available, I must have misinterpreted what they meant by that.
---
Good thing I don't fly a rorq eh?
---
I calculated this on mer post, tbh will not look for this post now.
---
You did this for a wrong lp store.
---
not defending him but alt tab + click x 4 isnt exactly hard to do in same server tick even easier if you got several screens or have the client sopen cropped next to eachother
---
2 billions
---
Nope.
---
Null security space is for combat pilots.
---
No input automaters.
---
RIP EVE ONLINE 2003 - 2019
---
these rorqs are bots?
---
When players are designing your game you already failed.
---
This sort of "direct democracy" wouldn't work because it just puts us back to where we begin with.
---
If players are voting for what they can benefit from, big blocs will organise votes or at least shape their members to have a certain view. As every CSM election show, nullblocs consistently get a majority and it's very likely that whatever the vote produces, the so-called "small alliances and hunters" wouldn't agree. In this case it's even worse than the CSM election, because nullseccers can theoretically **veto every single one of proposals not from them** while in CSM elections you can at least get Olmeca in.
---
The best way forward is what I call "truth and reconciliation". Instead of discarding what the other side says because you have a majority or vice versa, the proposal process should be purely advisory, and if the supporters (Pros minus cons) reach a certain threshold CCP can take that and give their own version. This version should be a compromise between different sides; so if a proposal is uncontroversial it just gets pass, but if there are also a lot of people against it it needs to be watered down. Then we can vote on this compromise to see if we want it.
---
There are no easy ways to do this, however, because 1) CCP won't relinquish their control over the game and 2) EVE players are extremely bitter. People mostly go "my way or the high way" on this subreddit, and factionalism puts even uncontroversial stuff like citadel changes in doubt. Until the playerbase learn to cool their heads down and stop insulting each other, we aren't going anywhere.
---
People still run those?
---
Real talk X13 bad
---
Panic module is the biggest problem with rorquals. They just don't die enough.
---
troll indeed: words are too good and not enough emotions, tears and drama
---
Yes and as a small corp/solo player I'm glad about it.
---
If you cant see how massive amounts of people all blue isnt good for the future of the game im not gonna even try to debate
---
is it less salty and s
---
i don't know about that could be fun for you to fly it. a lot of pilots don't know about this most pilots like an sma is just a sma and all ships can be loaded into it
---
With the change to faction weapons modules the value for LP has gone up for any faction the provides the good ones.
---
What if you can't afford a titan but you can afford a carrier? 300m is a hell of a lot to that guy.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the changes CCP are doing, I'm just playing devil's advocate. There are clearly situations where people have been somewhat screwed over by this particular change.
---
Nice, thank you. Thats a good writeup.
---
Moving your subcaps around. People I know who play solo have so far used caps to shift their low and null sec homes by having everything in a carrier and a rorqual or carrier and using the caps to move. In order to move they now have to sacrifice 600mill. Personally it doesn't affect me but it does affect people I know. I understand they needed to do something to limit cap proliferation but all they've done is stop solo and small group players from using caps while doing precisely nothing to the larger entities..... you know, the ones who are the biggest causes of cap (and supercap which, lets be fair, is the real problem) proliferation.
---
Why aren't you using a nereus or something?
---
Oh shocking, another tread about not playing the game from another goon...
---
I don't know why it has to be explained at this level of detail for the population of this subreddit (many of whom were former members of DRF, Nulli, VOLT, etc. that got hoovered up by the mega coalitions years ago, who should know first hand what you're talking about). How can a group of  people be so disconnected from reality? Imagine playing a game you really like, one that you've invested thousands of hours and thousands of dollars in. Suddenly a change comes out you don't like, that makes the game a little less relaxing for you to play. You and all your friends are pissed off about it, so all of you decide to take a break from the game. You look at the player count and realize, oh... you were the only ones left playing.  
---
Is that good game design?  
---
A lot of people in Nullsec think they have a vested interest in the health of the game because they have assets. What about the people who came before you that won fights you'd never even dream of being winnable, that created playstyles never even conceived that allowed you to win not based on numbers but on coordination or overall skill? It's easy to say "you're just a retarded miner," or "you're a self proclaimed elite PvPer". It's not easy to say, "yeah my play style is just a little too strong at the minute and it's probably good for the game overall that they're rolling that back".  
---
&gt; The playerbase fucked their own selves over the years, by exploiting to the maximum possible degree certain CCP design decisions that catered to a "bigger is better" meta in almost every aspect of the game.  
---
This is the portion I disagree with. There was a time in Eve's recent history where Rorqual mining was not a thing, where skill injectors were not a thing, and the economy was in a lot better place than it is now. The sheer flood of minerals and raw SP into the ISK market created and still create massive problems for the ecosystem of the game and further exacerbate the condition you describe because of scalability. Now, you didn't have to wait for someone to put a Rorqual pilot up on the character bazaar and snatch it up for +10% cost immediately in order to secure your new pilot, or wait months to get into the ship at low skills and work your way up. I can't remember exact figures but shortly after the Rorqual/excavator release there was a time Rorqual pilots were making over a bil an hour in minerals mined. That's one of the reasons the population of pilots interested in that play style exploded overnight. That part of the problem rests **solely** on CCP's poor game design choices regarding mineral production and liquid skill points.
---
Not sure recons are worth 300m but either way the whole idea is that if your willing to drop caps, it shouldn't be able to jump through a beacon from a 10k isk rookie ship and I think that's the main logic behind the change.
---
With the state of the current market, and the fact plex are at 2b atm it's definitely not alot of money to pay jump such powerful ships across multiple systems, especially when its through an arazu/lach pointing you 50km away.
---
To be fair, that seems to be CCPs primary business plan the last 3 months.
---
I didn't see that point in your post. But so far we can agree then.
---
Logi marauder sounds like a ton of fun, ngl
---
It's not reasonable to expect that CCP will prioritize suitcase caps when making changes to how caps work. 
---
Also what do you propose CCP to do to caps and how will the change you propose affect big null empires without affecting small players?
---
i kept seeing the goblin king dodging in and out with his malediction doing the lord's work lol.
---
&gt; asking for our help

the community already helped a lot to get into the current situation

best outcome could be achieved by ccp closing all doors and windows (especially towards reddit and forums) for a week, printing a big poster to the wall about all the good stuff that happened in the past, and doing what they feel good
---
Why? How has it benefitted you?
---
No, they still are too efficient is the problem. It shouldn't be an option to multibox drone mining boats. Neither Orcas or Rorquals.
---
You are literally the exact person he's talking about: someone who's unwittingly benefitted disproportionately from CCP's changes in the past few years to the point that not only does being brought down to the level of everyone else feel unfair to you, but you actually cannot conceive of a different way to play the game.
---
Implying large blocs were fighting in subcaps in the first place.
---
&gt; We lost ability to talk to others as you don't know who is in system. Like since blackout i got 1 convo and from a guy that docked with me in the same station. this is bad for MMO
---
I don't care enough to respond to the rest of your post but you didn't lose the ability to talk to people in local. The feature was simply not removed. You can still talk in local. Maybe people aren't talking to you because they don't like you.
---
Apparently the major goon thought it was the same as the bazaar. I guess he knows better know.
---
I just trained my first mining skills since ~2013 so anything is possible. 
---
Pretty sure the last rocks I smashed before slurping moon goo on corp fund raising ops this past month was veldspar... inside high sec mission pockets.
---
LP market will start normalizing after the decline-as-many-missions-as-you-want-for-free standing drug expires in October.
---
I didn't like the Nerf caps spam and I don't like the present spam. Not hard to imagine.
---
well  npc is npc,if he thinks npc too strong he is in wrong game.. eve is pvp game but with taste of non-pvp enviroment
---
With your disability, sir, I'd advise you to not post in internet. Thank you.
---
No. I mean if you give them something that is good for them at the expense of the game, they will take it and not bitch. This is why the community appears split on major issues.
---
if he was ganked in highsec..would agree but if he dived into lowsec he deserved.
---
Yeah, ok, 200-250mill. I was looking at the Caldari ships but the Lachesis is \~210mill so fitted I guess \~250mill.
---
I'm not sure plex prices have any bearing on this. I'd think that ability for small groups to make isk is more the measurement.
---
I guess time will tell but it just seems to me that this is pushing small groups more and more into joining the bigger alliances and so making the situation with that side of things worse rather than better.
---
Idiot
---
I should get a cloaked tag to make my edgy comments fit then
---
Are you delusional?  Look at zkill before blackout for your “every single time” fantasy.
---
Then make any form of suggestion at all rather than just mindless complaining that the game is dead, as so many do whenever *anything* is done by CCP, or other times when CCP didn't do much at all.
---
Broadcast the cyno in fleet. Wish I’d thought of that before I lost my Anshar to a mindless mis-click. Will use that from now on. Thanks!
---
Thats the only benifit of the age of chaos. I picked up my ball and left. Since then I've spent a ton of time with my wife and dogs and cat, adopted a new cat, got a promotion at work,  started retraching myself how to work on 3d/CAD modeling, bought a new house and started remodeling the new house while i remodel the old house. So, thanks, CCP, for making me quit, I guess. It's been somewhat beneficial IRL. 
---
When you quit, you start realizing how much other stuff you could be doing with you time and how much you just wouldn't even consider doing because your free time was devoted to EVE.
---
I don’t have a vision.  It isn’t rocket science to say “See chart?  see Downward trend?  ... need me to dumb it down even more...?”
---
Pearl abyss bought eve and ccp
---
In case you didn’t know... Not apple or the other people you’re naming to be edgy
---
But then again, eve-offline takes daily peaks. And usually, you have not reached the daily peak at the current day, so the curve was ALWAYS tilted down at the very recent days.
---
If you want to take a more insightful number, just take the lower number of last week (around 22k) and compare that to 30k of a year ago. Suddenly, its a 23% drop and not a 50% drop.
---
And this number looks alot less scary, if you consider that many bots stopped playing, multiple alt farming (VNI) are shut off etc.
---
I mean, yes, there COULD be alot less people playing. But it could also mean, that there are less people multiboxing (or botting). We simply cannot say, because we don't have the numbers. However, CCP DOES have the numbers. They CAN estimate, how many individual PLAYERS log in every day/month. How long their sessions are. And they might also be able to estimate how many players are bots, since they know how bots operate before they got caught...
---
This is ironic considering for years null bloc space was safer than highsec in every way possible and endless complaints have arisen now that there's risk again in null.
---
The thing is, the corporation recruitment system is shit, but it probably has never contributed to player growth or loss in that way since even more rudimentary systems (without the corporation advertisements) were somewhat effective in getting people into PvP corporations. More than anything in Eve, the best recruitment tool has never been a billboard though - it's been word of mouth.  
---
Nowadays the ESI shit makes joining literally the same for all corporations/alliances, and is essentially identical to how it worked previously -  but instead of having to give an API key to someone and the delete it once you left, you simply log into their ESI verification shit and then simply revoke access to the account once you've left.  
---
Most of the people getting fucked with corporation theft are either too stupid to have avoided it regardless, or were betrayed by someone with the highest levels of trust regardless. It's extremely uncommon that a random one week old recruit walks out with the corp wallet through guile alone.
---
You missed OPs point. Sometimes people enjoy that play style. Not everyone wants to be an elite edge lord pvp master.
---
r/evenullblocks ?
---
Not every small group need capitals.
---
admitting being kind of addicted to the game is for me quite nice. I was, but I'm not... which is good thing
---
If you read through most of the anti blackout posts on this sub, nearly all of them are from big blocs saying 'what about the small guys'. Reality is the small guys are doing fine with the change as they they don't exactly drop caps regularly?
---
Seems to be just an excuse for them really wanting to say 'CCP nerfed my content.'
---
Sure the numbers are gonna take a dip as people have spent years grinding isk in their rorq's/ratting supers completely risk free. But in the end of the day they are the reason isk has been devalued so much.
---
I looked at Plex as a medium as it usually tells you roughly what the state of the current market is at/value of isk.
---
Limiting alliance/corp size is a pipe dream, for exactly the reasons you stated. It doesn't matter if it's 10 ultra large alliances or 100 small alliances in a coalition, they'll be able to set standings and operate fleets just the same.  
---
If you want to want to reduce alliance size, the best way to do it organically is to incentivize players to form smaller organizations with higher return on investment. This appears to be in some ways what CCP is turning their focus on now.
---
It has been concerning me, and "people like me" basically constitutes anyone with a brain that isn't easily swayed by mindless outrage.
---
The game has issues, if you care to make posts about it then have it be something more than "wah wah the game is dead/dying". It's not like CCP (or at least people in CCP) don't read reddit; they read it more than their own forums. Suggestions from players can, and recently have (with the JF cyno changes) been listened to and put into the game.
---
At this point the "eve is dead!" posts are a bad meme and having posts after **every update** stating the game is dying gets old fast.
---
There's legitimate concern that his streak of vampires, VRs, mobile apps, etc -- all of his failures -- will now translate to EVE that now there's no more pet projects to focus on. 
---
I will certainly support your point ("bitter") if there's a single project he was focus on was successful.
---
yikes
---
I wanted to give you an upvote for 1./2. as I think, big blocs are crying more than they should. And we should just figure out, how WE make EVE more interesting again. It's not all on CCPs shoulders!
---
And then... You went into Grr TAPI/Goon mode, which destroyed all of your integrity
---
Cheers to CCP and Hilmar, have a silver! I'm spending the money I set aside for EVE on reddit awards instead of EVE now.
---
I'm not looking for any reasons to do anything in my life from people on reddit, believe me on this one ;)
---
Truth is, EVE was fun, probably it kind of still is, but not as much fun for me anymore. It's perfectly fine if you enjoy your time ingame, nothing wrong with it.
---
I recon I'm not alone, as many of my fellow players are not playing anymore as well, but ... who cares, it's just a game.
---
there's roaches as well. whatever you prefer.
---
I clicked on this with very low expectations, congrats you succeeded at disappointing me with my lowest expectations. Null sec alliance knowledge skill level not injected Sov skill level not injected go train up some then come back, and try again.
---
you forgot about  manticores purifiers  anathemas and  helioses... unless they will have integrated device that auto-cloak them when not  in range of any decloaking enviroment
---
or .. learn how to use Local and D-scan and do this playstyle in any high populated high-sec regions and your chances to be ganked will be close to zero.
---
this is not dumb idea,especially dual asb sin..
---
There is a certain amount of delusional arrogance when someone thinks that other people post specifically for your approval.
---
There is a bit of irony here. Sov Null blocs are notoriously bad for thinking their the only space that matters to the bottom line.
---
they have a few token moons in CR but otherwise yeah they don't leave lowsec if they dont have to.
---
This is EvE 2019.  https://youtu.be/Tt1W0F0yObg
---
&gt;adding defensive structures that would make it easier for smaller alliances to defend their space  
---
Fozzie?  
---
&gt;Having the lowest number of players since 2005 means it's not fucking working  
---
How about the slope the game's player count has been on since after skill injectors were introduced? Guess it's just now that the game is having a bit of a balance issue, huh?  
---
Grow up.
---
&gt; Eve doesn't belong to you alone
---
Proceeds to spin the same bullshit propaganda about EVE dying because his nullbloc is being mildly inconvenienced.
---
Contract anything and everything to VeronicaKell
---
This guy isn’t going to take responsibility for anything at all.
---
there is no point of doing so, rage quitting is not my thing.
---
My Titan is still ready to go when it will be needed, as well as other stuff. But as I do like EVE in general, I'll just wait how things will change if somehow.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/eve-online-battle-asakai/
---
Reminder: Eve belongs to no player but CCP.   
---
They can pull the plug if they want to and you can do nothing about it. Stop crying as if your only toy is being taken away. Can Eve players fuckin act like people in their age, like fuckin adults and stop complaining for one second.?
---
\&gt; claims he doesn't care
---
\&gt; responds anyway
---
\&gt; eve's not being impacted at all
---
\&gt; lowest player count ever recorded
---
would work in big ship like marshal
---
I have them usually split in 2 groups. 
---
A thing about cutting these videos is, that I also cut the sound to get rid of unwanted comms in the video.
---
What you did not hear is the FC asking for one weapon to be split seperatly so that we can poke the Rorqual after the Invu runs out. To provoke an escalation instead of killing it.
---
What you also might not realize is, that some calls are moved up and down the timeline. Since I had to speed up alot of the video I also had to adjust the comms a little.
---
In the video you see me splitting DPS and directly afterwards comes Pando's call to still primary the Nag and focus fire. Followed by asking why we split the damage.
---
In real time those calls were a bit further apart. He asked for the Megas to be removed and as you can hear by his call afterwards quite a few guys understood it the same way as I did.
---
That is the reason why I split the damage.
---
Dude you're a Goon.#1 offender of wanting Eve your way. The irony is real
---
Pretty cool
---
You don’t have to be an “elite edge lord pvp master” to appreciate that Eve online is first and foremost a PVP game.
---
Say that if you want to, but if that was bad in the past, then why should we do it now?
---
Right, they should have reacted to the stagnation of Nullsec years ago. Glad you're finally realizing how this works.
---
Seems like the game was in a healthier place when they were at the top of the food chain. By your own metrics even. Want to try again with another counterpoint or are you content to parrot the opinions of others until you get bitter enough to finally fuck off from Eve for good?
---
EVE lost 50% of its active player count in the last 2 months when it is pushing out a new patch that is supposed to be exciting and bringing players back. Dismiss it if you want to, but you, sir, should recognise that not all is well.
---
Correct - for years. Not just for a little while since blackout. Why is this just now becoming an issue for players who abused it?
---
Then quit and stop posting.
---
Remove ticker tags [all tickets from the overview].
---
Yes, I really did not pay attention to them yellowboxing me. RIP
---
Well community posts wont fix the issues as per my understanding . For example all null sec ppl which are a lot will propose from their stand point and if there is an poll thats will be selected just like csm has so many null sec people . So i doubt this will solve anything
---
Just teaching people, some times you have to get burnt to learn the fire is hot. We are not elitist so we take anyone willing to learn give them all the tools they need, and if they decide not to use them, then may as well teach them what happens, rather have goons kill goons then reds
---
Well, yes. Me and my tiny corp for example :)
---
So get better at scanning...
---
Nice attitude, telling people to fuck off and quit the game, but yes, we are the problem, toxic players.
---
Yet have to see someone do more than 2 in the same tick without any assisting software and have actual logproof of that but as i said - possible, but unlikely. especially when the guy was that much of an incompetent idiot in all other aspects as hes painted here.
---
Today server population was 13k, big alliances will count as "small".
---
Four months ago I was a little bored with 20-24k at the same time of day.

---
The same players that advocated for and abuse mass scalability with skill injectors, Rorquals, VNI (Now Myrmidon) ratting, Citadel spam, etc.  
---
It's astounding to see how few people are hailing the benefits of citadels years after some individuals warned it was legitimately worse than POS's.
---
Can i see where did you get numbers to say "EVE lost 50% of its active player count in the last 2 months"?
---
&gt; immediately satisfies the statement in my last sentence
---
Would you rather let the game die to see your "revenge" or "irony"? We are better than this.
---
&gt; As you said, they are making a big gamble and I hope it pays off but it is indeed a big one.
---
One of the big dangers of looking at "slope" is that sometimes you need to lose a little to win. If you are at a local maximum, then all directions are down.... so if there is another local maximum somewhere else, even if its bigger than the one you are on, the path to it is down.
---
This post should be stickied and the link be used as a reply to any of the nullbear salt threads currently being spammed (especially the now weekly "Active PCU" thread).
---
I was one of those folks that decided to just stop playing due to the stagnation of the game combined with the cancellation of this year's AT. I was planning on just considering a return if they made good on the promise to have the AT next year. But a lot of these changes signal exactly what you're saying- they know the current path for sure leads to the death of the game. Long term, they NEED the game to be dangerous, to all players, for it to have any chance at lasting.
---
Game is dying for me, but not for thee!
---
Except it's only optimal if you are min/max'ing for ISK/h or convenience. It's suboptimal if you want something that's a challenge or where your achievement is something you've done against a limited number of opponents.
---
Oh yeah, I totally agree on the blackout. It's been great for my corp. We're tiny and it's made things way better for us. I've spent more time in nullsec since the blackout than I have since I was part of an alliance.
---
In general the changes have definitely improved the game for my little group and for me solo. I guess this is the first change that's adversely affected the people I know in the game. I suspect that it'll even out and they'll jump less and suck up the potential isk loss when they do.
---
Look at EVE Offline; the average concurrent player count is down to 14k for last 36hrs while it was 28k for the past three months, and slightly higher before that.
---
And here we see the goon linemember adopt a defensive posture, having backed itself into a corner.
---
T3 mining frigate. Transforms to this when you change mode.
---
&gt; because they weren't there to see Eve before skill injectors, and easily obtainable SP is just something they've always had access to.
---
Eve before injectors.....
---
WTB Rorq pilot! 
---
"07 dude long time no see, how you been?"
---
"Sorry, do I know you? I just bought this toon"
---
Yah, SP for isk was never a thing before....
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d2h55c/under_10000/ezv9ppm/
---
But you were playing Eve to relax for a few hours, not to achieve anything specific in Eve. Not an invalid reason to play but something where maybe you could've found something else that let you relax as much. It's not as if super ratting is relaxing AFK'able stuff.
---
Tbh noone even cares about hisec mssion runners. Noone complains. Hisec is made for that playstyle, and its commonly accepted that way. 
---
People only complain about relatively risk free krabbing in null, and the ability to easily play a pve only playstyle in a "null security" region.
---
Well i ques if you define "active" player by looking the amount of characters past login screen.
---
The same way ammo is shown on the fit since that's a cargo thing
---
To be honest, I've not thought about it that much. I'd like to see supercaps changed from uber combat machines to utility. So something like Titans to mobile citadels and supercarriers to fleet movers.
---
But then what do I know. I don't fly either. Just seems that from what I've read the nullsec entities with lots of them currently just crap on everyone else.
---
PCU is disproportionately inflated by crabs and bots because they stay logged in for 10 hours a day and thus have a greater chance to clip the peak interval. Averages of interval player counts along the day are also affected in the same way. 
---
EVE was fine before we had an influx of people whose idea about the game is to crab AFK for ten hours in safety. It will be fine when those people are gone. And when they return as soon as the next best AFK meta emerges it will be fine too.
---
You can't be delusional enough to believe any nullbloc will stop saving rorqs or supers. People just don't want to be the test subjects for establishing the new save process.
---
The end result will be that people who play the game actively will make more money per hour because bots and people watching Netflix while playing value their economic activity less.
---
EVE isn't for you, no shame in that. Kudos for trying
---
You're right. I'm toxic. Begone.
---
This post needs to be everywhere.
---
I don't disagree with what you're saying at all, but
---
&gt;- Rorqs and capitals are too strong  
---
- I am a goon  
---
I am very confused
---
You really nailed it here. 
---
I can understand why people are upset about the changes, but really if the game was full of blue balling carebears, I say let it die.
---
&gt; Perhaps. How were they going to defend those small alliances? Seems like a huuuuge pain in the ass.
---
With the main alliance. The shell alliance just puts up infrastructure and adds the main alliance to its access lists. So the sov is "owned" by a tiny fake alliance populated entirely with director alts, but the space is used by the actual alliance.
---
&gt;And if it becomes prevalent, you can pretty much add in mechanics that make it completely impossible for two alliances to be friends in null.
---
How though? If blue standings ceased to exist, alliances could just have a big pinned list on Slack that just says "don't shoot alliance ticker XXX" and achieve nearly the same thing.
---
Because I've done pretty much everything except abyssal. Been playing this game for years and years.
---
I have a home in null. I have ships I like to fly. The cyno stuff is just ass to work with now so I don't feel like flying the ships I like, and therefore I'm ready for some classic WoW.
---
Maybe some day I'll come back but for now it's a good time to step away. I wasn't logging in before the changes much anyways.
---
genuinely surprised(disappointed) eve fan art in the style of kancolle isnt a thing already.
---
&gt;oO so this is a troll posting right?
---
Yeah it was.
---
All that needs explained is that I really needed a "/s" somewhere in the post. I thought the  "im quiting eve... for tonight" was enough. 
---
I messed up on routing. 9 mids to hit,  in a bit of a rush, and I knew in the past decloak camps had been run there. Didnt care, and I clearly should have.  Messed up on double hitting cloak. Good tip on waiting a bit, but I did actually, long enough to check out where the closest decloak drones were (5km.. was all relieved). I just got a little shaky and hit cloak twice based on feeling. It didn't seem like I was going to cloak since it took so long to begin warping (both commands felt like they probably went on the same tick).
---
Take my upvote
---
ESI was a mistake. 
---
Imagine putting in a siphon deployable then some dude in the esi department hooks up some endpoints that allow scrubs to automatically detect said structure around your mining pos. 
---
fucking hilarious
---
&gt;Remember, when Pearl Abyss looks at CCP's report next quarter, they will be very intrigued to find how CCP managed to kill half of their revenue and CCP will need a goddamn good excuse to keep themselves (and EVE) alive.  
---
Implying that one particular play style controlling that portion of CCP's revenue for the company or the game as a whole isn't the problem to begin with.  
---
Where was this morale posting years ago - when changes like skill injectors caused the game to start swirling the drain?
---
&gt; you gain more from uninterrupted afk ratting than you do participating in "content". reverse that, the problem goes away.
---
So what is your magic solution to make pvp earn more than carrier ratting in perfect safety? And how does this not inflate and ruin the economy more than the past years of said pve has done?
---
I knew a few guys who were abusing alpha accounts, login multiple of them at the same time.
---
Since yesterday that exploit seems to be fixed (if you don't use a virtual machine). People may leave or not, but the huge number drop these days come from that.
---
You could have the same amount of actual players, but thousands of toons less log on.
---
It doesn't matter, because that's ultimately what the executives will judge the game on. 1 concurrent player = a portion of a sub paid (because alpha exists), unrelated to whether the person is a hunter or a nullbear. If the game' population just slips a bit, like 10%, then they might overlook it, but a 50% drop is very alarming. You can argue how all the people gone are bots and all --- the executives/shareholders see half of the revenue gone. They want their money back, and you won't want their involvement...
---
Lmao lemme just outform goons, anyone got at least 100 titans they dont mind feeding?
---
Maybe he'd like to see the revenue stream diversified in order to secure the future of the game instead of pandering to what has proven to be a diminishing and impotent group of limp dick nullsec boomers hooting at each other on Teamspeak about how much spod they're ramming into each other's lubed up cargo holds.
---

---
I can see them making a change to citadels soon, maybe limiting the number per system/constellation. Maybe I'm just dreaming at this point.
---
I live in low sec so of course these changes are amazing for us. But even then me and a few of my fellow pilots would like to see a few changes to local in low sec too. Not full blackout but more a delayed local, maybe 3-5 minute delay depending on sec status.
---
Either way this could end up being a nullsec reset if they all end up leaving. Which for the long run would be great for the game and give CCP time to make null sec a small alliance skirmishfest which would be incredibly exciting.
---
The cyno changes just effect cap projection which is pretty crucial as big blocs already hold an insane amount of power.
---
I know we have subcaps in karmafleet, I've seen pictures in fleet chat in my titan fleet! :P
---
By the same logic about assuming what PA wants maybe they want EVE to be a game where crabbing is hard and more people blow money on PLEX? PAs golden goose is heavy monetization not monthly subs why do you assume that EVE would be different?

Injectors are a problem and it still is. It's not like people didn't protest against it or felt alarmed to it. I was alarmed by it, but ultimately it is here today and CCP didn't even change recently.
---
You are right that the fact that CCP's revenue is so tied to nullsec is a problem, but they can't fix it if the changes made PA pull the plugs. EVE had the reputation of being a stable game and a stable investment, and now they will seriously reconsider that if it continues. You want null players to move to other regions/playstyles, not driving them out altogether.
---
What makes you think that polarized weapons,  assault damage controls, and T2 trig frigates are not meant for pvp?
---
Or 200 bombers.
---
Goonies are cancerous.  Their n+1 mentality is cancerous.  CCP seriously needs to consider killing every cancerous strategy to excise the tumor.  
---
Even 3 years ago, I would have been down voted brigaded.  6 years ago, I would have been ridiculed as well.  Today, I think people finally see the result.  
---
There used to be small unaligned PvP corps living in every region
---
&gt;You mean... playing the game as it is given to us?
---
Exploiting a game to the maximum benefit, negating all gameplay that constitutes "risk" and "pvp" in a pvp oriented game, isn't just "playing the game", it's actively working to exploit it.
---
&gt;change the game.
---
Ironically, people such as you who've been saying it's all CCP's fault and they need to change the game have also been the ones complaining about CCP making changes recently with blackout et al... you can't have it both ways.
---
Those are a similar population to those that get suicide ganked on gates while carrying their worldly goods and ragequit then and there.
---
Ditto.
---
That's exactly why you don't want their involvement.
---
No, they can't change covert cynos, think of the hunters! They have it so hard. Ships never died before blackout, or NSA nerf, or rorq nerf, or trig ships
---
&gt; Players will always use and abuse mechanics to the fullest extend
---
and yet you had the choice. and the people who chose not do so now get to point fingers at you. good real life lesson btw.
---
If you don’t understand the difference between the old bazaar model and skill injectors you are a fucking moron.
---
&gt;It doesn't matter, because that's ultimately what the executives will judge the game on  
---
No it isn't, because as opposed to you the executives have access to more metrics than the logged in characters you see on eve offline and if they're gonna judge on any single metric then it's how many of that are actual paying players.
---
Sure thing spod brain.
---
Now you are just speculating the income of game time bought by nullsec players. You dont have these numbers, i dont have these numbers, no one except CCP has them. 
---
Now that alphas cant be used to free farm null isk and botting generally in null is not that safe anymore those accounts just dont log in. thus meaning a bit lower PCU.
---
I agree with you the Sotiyos were probably the biggest issue in regards to titan proliferation. The hassle dealing with the old capital ship construction arrays with the maint bays meant that to scale up titan production required a huge amount of effort. Now you can just throw in 10 titan jobs at once without the risk associated with POSs.
---
Nice. I've been doing RS3, PoE and Magic Arena
---
Maybe you should go out more.
---
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not but yeah assault frigates are the meta right now as they have strong tanks and good dps. Ramjags are the new combat ceptor
---
The whole real world is effectively on two sides, it always ends up like that when the stakes are high enough. Back in 2003 it was just a few hours grinding at stake, but then even when goons destroyed bob there were years and years of grinding at stake, so both sides fought longer than any war lasts today. And now there aren't any stupid alliances left.
---
PVE activity is the cornerstone of generating content in space. Relying purely on players to do so will only result in blue standings and blobbing. 
---
The less PVE players in eve, the less content that will exist.
---
&gt; No, it's, ccp's fault for making a product where the optimal way to play is the result we have now.
---
"optimal" is subjective. For people in the bloc space, optimal means making maximum isk without engaging in any PvP that has risk. For other people, this is boring gameplay, far from their optimal. But the former forces the latter out of their optimal gameplay.
---
The players in eve are most certainly responsible for the state of the current game, probably as much as CCP. Even in situations where there's a big reason to fight (market structure in perimeter) the big blocs have decided "hey let's not fight,  we'll just split it for maximum ISK and no risk like we usually do"... which is extremely clearly a bad thing for the game.
---
No, that's playing the game.
---
Your text is difficult to read, but assuming the current player loss is permanent, to replace the players lost you will need the current EVE population to double. There are no reason why those new players won't go to null either.
---
Plus a lot of the things that make the current null style possible --- capital ratting, citadel spam and lack of resources in other space --- aren't getting changed at all. Your suggestions just make little sense.
---
Make PvP worth doing.
---
Link to zkill is also handy info
---
Your posting on reddit is free intel about how much of a tool you are so death to you (ingame)
---
Nah I've seen plenty of posts crying that the single high sec incursion left should be nerfed, and that abyss levels above 2 shouldn't be runnable in high sec/should have suspect timer again. 
---
While I can't fathom how anyone thinks grinding L4's is somehow too good isk/hour, there are plenty who hold that opinion too. 
---
Also T4-5 abyss has the risk to go with the reward, especially if you run the PvP rooms. You need to know what you're doing and have a blinged fit and pod for a T5 abyss site. I've seen no bots running T4-5 abyss lmao. Finally incursions are dangerous, player cooperation and communication makes them less safe. They aren't safe by design - same with null super umbrella space.
---
We came by, grabbed some small stuff, then left. We showed up about the time that BB was dropping Rorqs so getting into D-W and in position wasn't feasible for our scouts and tackle. It was kinda like watching your siblings play through the window while you're grounded inside  
---
Laughed at all those friendly kills on Zkill though.  
---
Still doesn't beat Test sitting on the only gate into their little mining pocket with 40 caps the other night

Gotta love that mission haha
---
"Implants" work differently, but same concept
---
So how often in PVP you fit a polarized wapons on your ship, without scam or point, quite often without prop mod.
---
Do us a favor and just leave the game and r/eve.
---
You got the right answer. But to him if it isn't the best option it isn't an option even though this is a video game we're supposed to be playing for fun.
---
I think his point was that you don’t see when people are in local so you don’t talk to them without seeing them on grid
---
There is no optimal way to play in a sandbox. You make your own goals. There are optimal ways to achieve your goals, but these do not have to be the optimal way to play the game.  
---
If your goal is to make ISK and not have any conflict, there is nothing wrong with that. However, if you then complain there is no conflict, you set the wrong goals.
---
You're points are all contradictory. You claim there's no rock paper scissors play against capitals but admit a bomber fleet would do the trick. Yeah they're strong against the right targets, but also easily defeated by comps.
---
It's called adapting to the meta.
---
A fleet of 10 nagas + logi will defeat a haw dread. An armor hac gang will destroy a carrier. 
---
The only difference from the old way caps would work is now you actually have a few options to fight back vs. subcapitals.
---
&gt;You want null players to move to other regions/playstyles, not driving them out altogether.  
---
How do you do this in any meaningful way? This is the problem that CCP has been looking at for years. Keep in mind that current changes, mechanically speaking, are minor inconveniences for large alliances and they are leaving the game in large numbers **because of narratives like the one you're posting here**.  
---
Let's say the introduced scarcity and removed the Rorqual's ability to mine simultaneously. A change that would probably be pretty decent in terms of forcing alliances to spread out. How many of those quitting the game now would remain?  
---
The fact that groups *like yours* continue to exacerbate the problem by pushing a fallacious agenda that "because we're leaving the game in protest, it's a bad game design choice" is the strongest evidence that CCP is moving in the right direction in moving game development away from that  source of revenue. How you can in good faith even begin to assert that CCP should place their trust back in any Nullsec bloc at this point is beyond me.
---
Sure, this is first to come
---
&gt;New bros need as many ways of making a modest amount of isķ as possible.
---
Sadly half the playebase seems to be against this.
---
No. 
---
First the majority of these posts are various spins of one group complaining because three years of null safety is ending.
---
Second the above group is famous for doing everything it can to control the narrative to benefit themselves.
---
Ignore the sperg, play the game, and enjoy the life CCP is breathing into it.
---
 Reminder: EVE does not belong to  Goonswarm Federation
---
Actually... this wasnt the comment i was trying to reply to.
---
On the other hand, those "many eve players" now have to do more to grind some isk. They used to just be able to undock and start ratting/mining, now they have to log in an alt (for cyno), scout the next site (no local), and use rubbish drones (no local) so they have to mine a lot longer to plex (and of course now they need TWO accounts, one for the cyno and one for the carrier/super/titan they rat in, or another account in addition to their rorqual fleet accounts). 
---
Basically you want casual pubbies to be able to hunt and get lots of kills without putting in effort, and you want it to be a lot of effort to earn the isk and ore needed to make shit for you to blow up?
---
Oh look, another indignant, entitled "Eve is dying" post. Fuck off.
---
Ok, fair enough. For me, there is still a lot of fun to be had. Even in nullsec, even with capitals.     
---
Sure, CCP has once again raised the inconvenience level, but at least something is changing now. That doesn't mean I support the cyno changes - they are terribly ham-fisted - but things needed to change.     
---
I'm interested to see how we will adapt. Hopefully, you'll be back after a break.
---
So why are you posting here?
---
Maybe Stainguy should create a curated Eve Online social channel in game to alleviate this problem instead of languishing on /r/eve about  how CCP must have removed the ability of people to talk to him  because he only got one convo.
---
only possible if CCP removes BO.
---
That's delusional; if anything, a nullseccer --- famous for using capitals and multiboxing --- should be *more* likely to be Omega. If you want to say about the AFK Alpha VNIs accounts for 50% of EVE's concurrent players, you will need very solid evidence to say that is the case. 
---
And I am surprised by your definition of "a bit". Sir, you should never work in academia or do accounting.
---
&gt; This is CCP making a lot space "SAFE"
---
Intel bots, local and automated tools that scan the game's logs on top of cyno's and supercapital proliferation are arguably what made nullbloc space so absurdly safe. Structures alone don't really come into that situation at all; trying to deflect all the issues onto CCP with that seems rather disingenous.
---
&gt; If ccp were to ever remove asset safety and make sure shit drops imagine how much conflict it wud people would start hitting structures for the possibility of a super drop
---
Imagine how many people would leave the  game or never return from a break knowing that they just had all of their isk removed from the game while they were offline and had no other option than to keep it in that high risk situation. Your suggestion really doesn't work at all; asset safety is there for a reason, you can't expect people to be forced to be online 23/7 or lose everything because *that* would kill the game in weeks or months.
---
Democracy in eve? Power in the player’s hand? Goon swarm would own all of nullsec in a year or less XD sounds like fun! first step get rid of space aids!
---
It’s only worth it to shed old players from the game if you can guarantee that new players will replace them.
---
Ironic, your salt is
---
I've been saying this for weeks. The Triglav invasions combined with the loss of 2 incursions and the randomly spawning recon triglavs have totally fucked up highsec activities.
---
Maybe you should invest in some spectacles, grandpa. Those changes have already been hinted at. Keep pushing for the status quo to return though, it'll be great to watch you hang up your Rorqs in the 1,000th protest thread on /r/eve.
---
What's the player count looking like again?
---
Do us a favour and pipe down
---
I never mined in a rorqual, so I have +5 protection against finger pointing.

Are you so blind on hating him that you don’t understand that he is referring to spontaneous conversations caused by noticing new people in local?

I’m very pro blackout but I see his point

Burrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnn!

No, I'm just making fun of him, and you.
---
Let me guess, WoW, Hello Kitty, NMS.
---
&gt;The space is worthless.
---
This right here is one of the core issues with EVE right now, imo. It is a game based on PvP where now the majority of players in the high risk space will actively avoid all PvP unless it gives them more ISK, that they want more off for... reasons (not for funding PvP at least, that much is obvious).
---
If every PvP situation is an arduous cost/benefits calculation, no PvP ever happens because PvP means losing ships which means losing ISK. It's much safer to just stifle out any chance of PvP with sheer numbers and being able to drop 10xn on any force, while making backroom deals with the other big groups in situations where you *might* have a reason to fight (see perimeter trade structures).
---
IMO part of the playerbase and their current mentality is a core issue in EVE right now, but good luck fixing the mess anytime soon.
---
Get a room
---
If you're using the same cyno(s) a lot, like jumping repeatedly between two systems to move mass m3 of goods, adding the cyno chars to the fleet watch list and right click on their names there to jump also works.
---
For regular one-off cynos though, I only ever jump from the fleet window. It's good habit now, because you're right, it's too easy to mis-click those bait cyno beacons.
---
Nah.
---
that's the correct mindset. Other people just want you to be an easy target so they can kill it, or take benefit from you being the target instead of them.
---
Imagine unironically that a roaming destroyer gang should be able to kill random ass capitals and supercapitals just by showing up with no nearby reinforcements, no nearby staging, no nearby dread cache, no nearby preparation of any sort. 
---
its been one and a half decade to prepare for random roaming fleet number 239495884292939949, yet the roaming fleet is still not more prepared than back then (except you now have shiny tech 3 destroyers, and such). How can you possibly expect, unironically, to get kills at all? Its magical that there even is some myrmidons to kill, that they haven't fleeted up and do sites in 50 man death squads with drone assist.
---
They frequently use decloak rings around the gates - a 12km ring of cans, wrecks, and t1 drones. Hazardous for cloaks.
---
I'm convinced more and more these need to quit and Eve and CCP will be better with them gone.
---
Other then a few people hurling hurr durrs and China using local as fleet chat I very rarely had any decent interactions with people whilst roaming through null. If people feel it has become less social then maybe they should look at Corp chat/alliance chat. These are the people they mostly communicate with, not random people wandering through other then to tell them how bad they are for being in space. The majority never leave their system - why not set up a channel for that system ?
---
fucking stop crying and ficht back u dumm idiots
---
My bad I thought stainguy was posting for me on this public forum
---
Yes indeed, because player mentality has changed to make PvP a bad thing, and they'll take any action possible to stifle out the chance of losing any ships even if it means no PvP at all.
---
Look at perimeter; it's a situation where blocs have/had a reason to fight. Instead, all the big blocs made a backroom deal to not fight and just share the income, because it's safer that way.
---
Bye
---
That battery level is giving me anxiety
---
You can take back your ad hominem and *your narrative*. The changes are what we call "weaponised inconvenience" --- they do not solve the root cause of why null is so preferred, simply because there are no good content in other space except WH; and WH is not a playstyle for everyone.
---
Making other spaces --- high, low, WH and NPC Null --- interesting is not difficult. For highsec, there should be more dynamic PVE. For lowsec, fix FW and make it actually interesting instead of just a farm; WH can use a bit of help with respect to Corp Management and logistics, which is a quick way to burnout; and NPC null simply needs an identity and some gameplay unique to it.
---
Remember, I am not asking anyone to put trust in Goons and we can take care of everything. I am simply asking everyone to sit down and find a common ground. I don't think I am asking for much, honestly.

It's funny, they want r/eve as gentle and accommodating as they want eve.

In this game interaction between players can be described as throwing each other bricks aimed at your skull..."just for fun" ...if someone happens to die its labeled as "your fault".... the game has workarounds for it...you can prepare in advance for griefing behavior...but it is ultimately a mindset to be able to throw yourself into the game....as you must never "relax"...this universe tests your resolve to survive.
---
The bottleneck to faction weapons was never LP value. It was/is the availability of tags.
---
I blame WoW classic
---
Lol. Me too. Upvoted
---
‘they seem to have no problem picking all the balancing ideas up to implement’
---
FTFY
---
Three years is null is 99.99% safe is being reversed. It’s painful for the people who go so used to it that they thought it was normal / good.
---
Compared to yearly average from 1 year to this month we are down 39%. Bots are often online for quite a lot longer than average player and such increasing PCU. If you take off the banned bots, wow classic and people going back to school / work and accounts that used to be running with plex i would say that \~10-15% of actual paying accounts stopped from that 39% group.
---
Sniper ships (like a rail Hecate), polarized weapons meant to melt you from 100+km away. Often catches people by surprise.
---
I am simply asking everyone to sit down and consider that we have a common ground. I guess I am asking for too much decency, at least from you.
---
Got an epileptic seizure but was still worth it.
---
How good was the abyssal AB and heat sinks btw?
---
100% with you here. Remember when they announced the jump changes to caps and everyone said they would rage quit?
---
Difference is the null leadership back then said "lets find a work around" compared to now where they are saying "lets go on strike and rage on r/eve"
---
How times have changed.
---
P.s. The game has been dying since 03. Get over it.
---
if your flair isn´t bait you actively and willingly participated in maintaining the established groups that were build around these non-sustainable playstyles. cling together, swing together, eh?
---
You can sel them on the market yes
---
This is not only a capital/PvP issue, I used to refit my Marauder in PvE. I ran the Gallente Epic Arc again last year and it was much pain going out of bastion and waiting one minute before being able to switch between artys and autocannons, or fitting/unfitting an afterburner. I sold my Vargur after finishing the Arc.
---
genuine concern posts like this one, where they lie/falsely predict about player numbers and state nothing beyond that and "eve is dying"?
---
ab was 182% and heatsinks were simply faction with worse dps and better cpu to fit it all
---
It indeed does not, which is why we should find a common ground and push for some things everyone want first --- instead of going into petty quarrels incessantly.
---
It has always been an issue and CCP has always been bad at listening to us, when we brought up concerns regarding balancing. Broken shit was left broken until goons abused it. Now we have extensively used rorquals and the nerfs are coming, but too late.     
---
It's an issue now because too many people have enjoyed the lazy life for too long and they don't want to adapt. Not everybody wants to pvp, some people just enjoyed things the way they were.    
---
I am not one of them and I am not judging them, just stating what I hear from people who are leaving. I can understand them in the way that, if nerfs are focused exclusively on your preferred playstyle, why keep playing?
---
Is this scooter McCabe the same scooter McCabe who was going around diploing the viceroy program for Goons from Fortress Deklein?
---
how very true
---
It’s amazing how ‘concerned’ certain null blocks are for small alliances while sperging 24/7 about changes that ‘will absolutely NOT affect us’.
---
the idea that goons treat pvp as a bad thing is a reddit fiction.
---
If that is playing the game then any and all PvP content is doomed forever since clearly the playerbase no longer wants PvP. Game changes won't change that back. Yet the same people that don't want PvP anymore will complain loudly about new PvE that creates risk, or liken it to wow for daring to move away from PvP centric design.
---
&gt;Goal of the missions were to teach PVE players to do PVP in small scale - aka 1vs1 in frigates.
---
No it wasn't.
---
&gt;Soon enough people found a way to abuse those frigates and came up with ways to farm the burner missions using on a huge scale using fits that have no application in real PVP.
---
PvE has been solved in this game. Even procedural PvE like Abyssal space has been solved. In fact, I would even boldly proclaim that in **all** MMOs, PvE gets solved, minmaxed, and then facerolled, when you have enough nerds doing it.
---
&gt;Soon we got fits "that you simply cannot lose", since then we got assault damage controls not even mentioning recent OP triglavian T2 frigate ..... do i need to say more?
---
You've clearly never tried to use the Nergal for Burners, or else you'd know it's just easier to use the usual ships such as daredevils over it. Also you're the first person I've seen declare that the Nergal is OP, which leads me to believe you've never flew the damn thing.
---
&gt;Those missions offer huge amount of LP for a minimal effort and investment.
---
In highsec yeah sure, but not for low or nullsec burners. The great thing is that empire LP is kept in check due to many people running it. Pirate LP is valuable due to the scarcity of L4 Security agents.
---
Regarding your fixes:
---
Reducing the LP by 75% would just make them regular L4 mission payouts, which meh. Making the burner run would be great and interesting, so sure that sounds good. Removal of nullsec burners would significantly reduce the viability of living in NPC Nullsec space, which is what nobody wants.
---
Like usual, in your giant toilet of shit sits a nugget of a decent idea. My advice, stick to your dayjob of begging for a lowsec gate to stain.
---
&gt; if you like eve, and want to play on your phone...
---
I think I would rather mine in high sec.
---
Then again, the whole gaming on the phone boat left me on the shore. I saw it there, pulling off the dock, full of people staring down at their tiny little screens. 
---
You know, starting with my generation onwards, we are going to call having a neck that doesn't straighten back up "phone gamer neck" because there are so few actual secretaries anymore.
---
Agreed I’m just saying that I get and understand his specific point of contention
---
A space game?! deffinetly a eve rip off !!!!!!!
---
How? Bounty payouts of more than your ship for blowing up a smaller ship? Because that'll be exploited the fuck out of more than anything ever before.
---
Eve isn't for you and welcome to the internet.
---
My flair isn't bait. My guilt is that I kept playing the game, with the people I like playing the game with. Sue me.
---
make it 1 hour
---
It's had a good run, need a new EVE after 15 years
---
There's a big difference between training an 80m SP titan pilot, and training 8 15m SP pilots in parallel then extracting and injecting a brand new titan pilot.
---
There was never the capacity to do it en masse before.
---
I have gone that route myself.
---
Ah yes this logic ....
---
Large Null Alliance: These changes will HURT small alliances while completely NOT affecting us!
---
Small Alliance: Actually we are doing good!
---
Large Null Alliance: It’s amazing how many of these small alliances are in here running their mouths when they don’t own a lot of space!
---
Awesome. I'd be interested in using this in our discord :)

Sure, I can give you source code, you can execute it on any VPS by yourself, it is a node.js app.

Simply my opinion but have you tried less line breaks to display your outputs? For example:

Rather than:

44%

Missile explosion radius
---
22%

Goons want the game to survive as well, and grow. Caps are fun, goons have been around since the start of the game, and have seen many changes. We will adapt to any changes, its what we are good at, as long as we have a game to play. The stronger the player base the better we will do.
---
It's not good, but not terrible.
---
Did not interest anybody when Citadels and Lifeblood Rorquals effectively halved the EVE-Population, why should it bother now ?   
---
CCPs problem atm is that they drove away 30k logged in accounts between 2015 and 2018 by implementing a meta for people who think that its ok to afk-farm the supposed to be riskiest PvE-Content in near 100% safety on 10-50 Accounts. Now they see that it was not good and try to roll some stuff back, resulting in exactly these people now getting salty ... and not enough of the old people driven away by rorquals Online are returning, because you know 40 years ol, job &amp; kids ...
---
You're some kind of special aren't you?
---
It is how embed params works in Discord, maybe I will refuse to use it in next release
---
Most people reading this sub stopped playing years ago so thats not gonna make a difference.
---
You're not wrong.  Hell, I enjoy abyssals and even fleet ratting, ratting for skill points, and occasional DED sites or Level 4s.  But, again, I'm a wormholer.  I spam my V key.  I watch for combat probes, even in High Sec, because I care about my ship.  I check zkill for Intel on anyone sharing my space, and if they're smart they'll do the same when they see me in Local.  If OP cares, OP should take better care.
---
If you take reddit seriously then yes I'd imagine you would be confused.
---
If it is a reddit fiction, then how come there has been a super umbrella to ensure maximum safety, heaps of multiboxed rorquals, factually highest PvE and industry numbers (evidence in MER) for the past 2+ years and a lack of fights? 
---
Because it's rather apparent that goons (and most blocs) preferring safety+PvE over PvP is a fact. Even in situations where there *would* be a reason to fight, eg perimeter trade structures, backroom deals have been made to ensure no PvP is required so everyone can just get more ISK. At this point, even if CCP introduces more reason to fight over ways to get ISK the blocs will negate it completely for the benefit of more ISK in safety.
---
&gt; Just seems that from what I've read the nullsec entities with lots of them currently just crap on everyone else.
---
Without them the result would still be the same, N+1 is still king.
---
Mittena and Co have been trying to get super stats for supers nerfed from the start.
---
&gt; If you don’t understand the difference between the old bazaar model and skill injectors you are a fucking moron.
---
There are numerous differences. It was still easily obtainable SP, purchasable for isk, which is purchasable for plex, hence cash.
---
There were still people farming SP in the form of prebuilt chars. Not much really changed. Could it be done better? probably. However, it was a pretty clear improvement.
---
The sad part is that it's propably true.
---
You know that there isn’t long range polarized weapon ?
---
3.6k!
---
That's people in general. Insult the person, address none of the arguments, repeat your last ones then insult them again.
---
Only if you scared of getting wet, and if you are time to harden up
---
Accounts running with PLEX are also paid for, and once the demand drops it wouldn't take long until the supply also adjust to it.
---
You are also ignoring the fact that today (or yesterday) was patch day, which is usually met with a surge of players. It's a highly unpopular patch, and if you are taking the monthly average you will need to expect a further slide due to cyno changes.
---
If I remember correctly, last year there was also a ban wave around the same time, so that wouldn't be a large factor. Ban waves historically only takes off 1-2% of online population anyway.
---
Your assertion that a large majority (by your estimation, 60%?) of those accounts that stopped playing are not paying needs to be backed up by data which only CCP has. You cannot just say that a majority of people quit aren't paying (disproportionately from other groups) without backing up your claim.
---
If Wow Classic is a problem of EVE's player count drop, then it's probably gonna be permanent and it still means the game is in trouble. Even more so actually. In any case, even a 15% drop means 4.5k lost concurrent players or at least £45k per month lost revenue.
---
Very much doubt that.
---
The fucking irony of a goonswarm member complaining about roaming destroyer gangs killing capitals. 
---
You should look at goonswarm history there bud. They were killing random capitals with fleets with rifters and no backup years ago. That was the reason they were so fucking annoying to established null blocs. Here's this new, small, seemingly unorganized groups of newbies killing random capitals and causing everyone else pain.
---
About that Pearl Abyss conspiration that all you whiners talk about:
---
Dont you think, that when in a year ago Pearl Abyss who has already a succesful MMO with millions of players bought CCP they haven't talked about how to make EVE great again and raise the numbers of the playerbase, etc? You think Hilmar just woke up in a lazy summer morning this year and decided that there should be a Blockout and Chaos Era? Lol. They knew that they should renew and it will cost subs. And PAbyss invest in the future, not in a game that is ruined and the biggest entity that ruining it the most is GSF (dont take it personal, just look at the pure numbers: [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/memberCount](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/memberCount)  ). Also if you see the changes since PA bought CCP they all built the leading way to Chaos Era. If i would have a PA theory it would be that PA asked CCP to do something about the unbalanced New-Eden and make it more equally challanging for every player.
---
Better drive away the rest to balance it out, that's that hilmar thinking. At least we'll all finally be free.
---
Look at the arazu, pilgrim, rapier and falcon. 260, 260, 280, 400 mil respectively, last time I was in Jita, around 2300 eve on Monday. Those are the ships, force, not combat recons.
---
This is a question best suited to our [No question is too stupid thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d00ka6/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread/)
---
Gotta replace all the goons quiting somehow ;)
---
Gotta give you props for giving even a brick wall a chance to reason.
---
Pretty sure frat/Winter is already fighting Test
---
&gt; goons have been around since the start of the game
---
Thonking.
---
big wars are over, friend. no one is going to fight for something they don't need to. 
---
&gt; I mean what else are you going to do ? Stack up more isk and ships you not gonna use and end up like skill yourself that just leave eve as a while without a fight
---
that's most people's plan, yes.
---
These cute memes are like nero fiddling as Rome burns. It's quite quaint, but demonstrably narcissistic.
---
It doesn't take much, just getting dropped by TEST while trying to roam in there space to learn some things are stupid
---
There is very little difference in buying an 80M SP pilot and buying the SP to inject into a pilot.
---
Certificates are sellable.
---
Only last time they had the offer on 3 months sub, they added a direct multi training activation, not a MCT certificate.
---
Well... Eve Online is a PVE game with the option of PVP. Many will say the contrary but they are incorrect mostly because they only do PVP and so don't know entirety the game.
---
PVP players here a the more frustrated and weakest type of them. Weakest because they aren't good enough to play to real PVP video games, and frustrated because EVE isn't a PVP game.
---
So they release their antagonism to anything related to PVE, and try to make CCP do everything for them. This is mostly why the login number is going down : the removal of local and the nerf of cynos mostly hurt the PVE part and so the game itself. PVP players will never see it or refuse to admit it.
---
So well... EVE is a game who reward intelligence, but doing PVP against PVE players don't require it. You just have to understand the game and reflect, so that it will never happen again.
---
You can adapt a bit and select better locations, or make the ship tough enough so that Concord can appear in time.
---
And CCP can incentivise fights by introducing resource scarcity again. No matter how good it sounds blocs won't fight each other out of sheer regard for the health of the game. Individual players might but you can't engage thousands of peoples time with empty words.
---
Make moon goo and minerals scarce in a way that makes fighting profitable again make SOV acquisition less spammy and grindy by fixing citadels and so on...
---
&gt; FCON flair
---
Wow that brings back some good memories
---
CCP should kill the API.
---
&gt;start a third block
---
Yeah that wont happen, everyones too risk averse, and the current powers would immedietly shit on them for content and the alliance would die, so ill just stay unsubbed while yall "win"
---
Here is your problem. The eve community as a whole, is *probably* better than this. r/eve, on the other hand, is not. It is the worst kind of echo chamber imaginable.
---
Personally I am mortified that capital ratting was ever a thing.
---
Unstable rolled A-type/Faction heat sinks? Was it cheaper to go with abyssal mods than say Gistii A-type AB and Dark Blood Heat sinks + Geno CA-2 implant, or more of a convenience/running other pod?
---
Because its the optimal way to play? How about that gets addressed in a non-retarded way.
---
Taking reddit serious in what regard? Goons that love their Rorqs aren't a phenomenon limited to reddit.
---
Good luck with people playing on one monitor trying to keep a slack window open.
---
I didn't wanted to be rude, I'm just saying that not everything is accessible to everyone. Problem is people like you is you are going to far into political correctness and lie to someone by pretending he can do something while he cannot. Even if he manages to play eve, he will get wrecked by everyone even the biggest noob ever in the game.  What the point? I'm sure there is plenty of things you can do very well while being blind, gaming is not of them.
---
Combat stats? As opposed to what? Crabbing stats?
---
Why am i even surprised...
---
gachiBASS
---
CCP isn't trying to ruin the game. They're just trying to ruin your game.
---
&gt;We need a wall!
---
And the Minmatar will pay?
---
Here is your problem, and the biggest warning sign of all. Quality assurance is totally out the fucking window, which is why I, as someone who spent a number of years in the industry--and specifically working on MMOs--am absolutely convinced that there is not a single person in CCP's upper management who gives a single fuck anymore. 
---
Hilmar just does not give a shit. He is thinking ahead to his new VR company (because you know CCPs VR titles were such hits), and he appears to be intentionally burning the house down on his way out.
---
Optimal in more ISK, yes, and that's the problem as that's all that's cared about now. There is no "addressing" PvP bringing in less ISK than PvE. PvP means losing ships, which is negative ISK. If there's something to fight over that's profitable, it'll either be backroom-dealed like the perimeter situation or exploited for maximum ISK in ways not intended.
---
If you have a "non-retarded way" to make people averse to PVP actually do PvP, perhaps you should make suggestions rather than making wild statements of "just fix it" and blaming CCP when players are equally if not more to blame.
---
I wonder what would happen if CCP brought back the iteration if fighters that didn't even apply to battleship properly.
---
Then he should have been clearer and not accusing me of "considering" Titan ratting at all.  Titan and Super ratting are both abominations.  But from r/eve the reason for many of the changes was, "boo hoo I can't kill Super/Titan because Umbrella".   What we now has is far fewer targets, as predicted (by me).  So that `problem' still exists.
---
We could always go the other route, if these guys don’t want to try and help fix the game, why not go out in a blaze of fire and burn this shit to the ground?
---
Google it or is there no one to tell you how?
---
the name of the game is n+1
---
Same, I just find it too fiddly trying to give complex inputs with a touch screen. I just don't think it works well enough to not be jarring and immersive.
---
Give people a reason to PvP, and they will.
---
What reason do they have now? None.
---
God damn you are bad at reading. Combat stats are things like mobility, DPS, projection, application, and tank.
---
On the fitting window, drag the stacks into the little cargo icon in the bottom left. 
---
Save fitting.
---
Voila.
---
i dont see much of null Leadership around here.
---
You follow Mittens, the definition of narcissism.
---
Is this about the cyno changes?!?
---
i dunno? ask the people you pay taxes to.
---
Back in my Bovril days we had a few women playing with us. They were the most foul mouthed of the lot in corp.
---
Umm... it took people *a lot longer* to farm a Rorqual pilot for sale than it does someone to run an alpha skill point farm. I.e. someone can run 20 alpha characters for a few months and have generated enough SP for sale that someone can inject a Rorqual pilot, whereas previously it took *a year or more* to specifically farm a character to fly a certain thing and sell it. 
---
These are apples and oranges you are talking here. Just go look at the character bazaar and note the value of characters these days. You can no longer make any more isk by growing a Rorqual/Super/Titan pilot above and beyond what the injector value of that character's skill points are.
---
Cant wait to try some instanced pvp again!
---
I think once Hilmar's bonus check in october clears, hes going to check out completely.
---
What overview filter are you using when you scan? Are you sure they aren't being filtered out once they're identified as whatever type of sig they are?
---
I didn't mutate anything myself, I bought all abyssal modules from other people. AB + 2 heatsinks costed me \~400mil. And I used mg snake, so CA isn't an option here.  
---
Actually I changed the fit a lot during its life time. The first one was 200mil with a-type ab and c-type sb with cheap clone. I was upgrading modules, adding more isk to the ship as I earn killmarks and discover the fitting limits. I ended up with 800mil fit + mg crystal with 5% dps implants before i finally died. Still have the clone, so maybe will make the second video about succubus in the future :)  
---
If you'd ask me to suggest you a succubus fit, i'd send you this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bux095/advanced\_looting\_operations\_v/epj63nv/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bux095/advanced_looting_operations_v/epj63nv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Probably because they're too busy fire selling all assets while line members do the moaning. 
---
Either way my main point is jump changes happened and a similar narrative was told. And guess what. Eve didn't die.
---
yes, maybe if all the players quit, CCP will be the best off it can be.
---
The Problem is the people who quit in the meantime aren't all coming back. 
---
Is less people overall more desirable than crabs?
---
( haha )
---
No, they will judge it based on number of subs. The number of subs is not proportional to the number of concurrent players if the ratio of bots / krabs to pvp players significantly changes.
---
I don't know why we have to keep making this point on Reddit.
---
I left eve. I left via my desktop needing a reinstall and apparently eve is so stale it took me over a week to realize it wasn't even installed.
---
I'd come back if the game wasn't stale.
---
hmmm
---
1. Fly out of corp alt into low sec pocket system
---
2. kill him once or twice in moderately blingy ships.
---
3. smart bomb camp the gate
---
&gt;never the capacity to do it en masse before.
---
Yes there is. *Years* of training goes into a non-injected Titan pilot. Whereas, a skill point farm running 20 or so parallel alpha accounts can generate the skill points needed to inject a Titan pilot in a few months. 
---
How do you not see the difference? You aren't really that dense are you? Oh wait, you're an r/eve wormholer. Never mind. Go back to watching Sesame Street.
---
In terms of the experience of the guy buying the pilot, sure, the two are pretty similar. In terms of the overall supply of titan-capable characters, the two are wildly different. To get an 80m SP titan pilot without purchasable SP, someone has to sit around and train it for the best part of 4 years. To get an 80m SP titan pilot with purchasable SP, you just have to generate around 200 skill injectors, which can be done in one month with a big enough SP farm.
---
People are still playing. Just not the crabbing ones. I'm sorry, but if they can't risk losing a ship, why would I want to fix that? I'm happy they are gone. 
---
It's not about their playstyle. I could care less how you play, but being able to have zero risk in null was creating an era of infinite wealth. 
---
High sec is still available for their type of play. But why don't they go there? Not as much isk? Too boring? I don't know. 
---
Frankly, the players are still here. We just don't have multi crabbing and bot farms any more. That's a good thing.
---
Game would probably be better, but they'd also need to buff bigger subcaps so that you can fight effectively while outnumbered in them rather than be just bomber/Kiki food.
---
Don't charge until the 30 second warning.
---
I thought I heard something about a skirmish or two here recently yeah
---
Hearing this rhetoric is like seeing a child's crayon drawing of what business is really like. They think that they are being clever and grown up but in reality haven't got a clue how it works.
---
This goon speaks the truth!
---
Yes because those afk crabs devalue everyone elses ISK/h.
---
Take gates then.
---
yes, because hilmar clearly has a well planned, adult, intelligent vision for the future of eve, and is not just flailing around with insanely half baked ideas.
---
&gt;Hope to make a bit of discussion
---
Then lays out...
---
&gt;cant multibox your krabbies 
---
&gt;all those stacket ships you never use
---
&gt;every krab goes reee
---
&gt;more isk and ships you not gonna use
---
&gt;because you dont want to risk something
---
&gt;reacting with reeee ... or something like that im shure he was a crab
---
&gt;big bloc brainwashed crabs that are programmed to have a certain opinion
---
Nah, I think you aren't ready to have a discussion; you know everything you want to know already.
---
The insults always start when they have nothing of substance to give. lol.
---
let me re-phrase seeing as I don't think you understood my comment:
---
There is very little difference between -
---
Buying plex with real money to buy an 80M sp pilot,  and -
---
Buying plex with real money to convert to isk to buy injectors to create an 80M sp pilot.
---
Please note I also did not feel the need to insult you at all.
---
watchlist is your friend
---
&gt; There are no reason why those new players won't go to null either.
---
Thats is one of the problems, new players should learn the ropes in Hisec and Lowsec, as these spaces (by the original definition) should be less dangerous. That this is not the fact anymore is largely an accomplishment of Goons, pulling newbies to KarmaFleet to have critical mass for fleets and for the economical ponzi scheme, while simultaneously and deliberately fucking up Hisec and Lowsec by exploiting bad game design to the fullest they can (Miniluv Gank Squads, paying PIRATto remove Hisec-Athanors, fucking up FW with a 5 tril. ISK heist and so on)

I can imagine booshing away from them and going and running nodes in other systems in entosis timers, or bringing something that can shred fighters and just slowly defang. Honestly I think it wouldn't be the worst thing if it was combined with some changes to haw guns and titans maybe
---
What reason can you imagine then?
---
People used to fight over their space, defending it and attacking neighbours... but that was before the big blocs became the only notable thing in null. Short of removing capitals (and even then) there is no way to make n+1 not superior to smaller groups. If players aren't willing/wanting to form their own groups and fight their own fights instead of being a tiny cog in the machine, you can't have smaller groups. blocs don't really have "neighbours", nothing can beat them since they can field far more numbers and hotdrop whatever they wish on any force.
---
People used to fight over scarce resources. Granted, there's not much scarcity in null atm, but i'll point at perimeter; a single location that is a strategic resource for whoever controls it, something worth fighting over. Instead of fighting, the big blocs have made backroom deals to ensure they can farm it for ISK without PvP. Anyone smaller than them gets obliterated if they so much as think of putting their own structure up. So scarcity of a resource doesn't work, either.
---
Making PvP more profitable than PvE is strictly impossible as it'd be exploited within the day for creating ISK out of nowhere.
---
Making PvP a "status" thing doesn't work either. Nobody cares about a title of "elite PvP" even if one were to exist, and much like any other PvP it would be blobbed by the biggest groups to the detriment of anyone but the biggest groups.
---
In a PvP-oriented game, the PvP has always been assumed the default. Players have done a good job at removing the PvP out of the game in the past 5 or so years and it's not only CCP that are to blame for that.
---
Oh yes, the game would be better without a doubt. My curiosity is rather about who would screech the loudest on here.  
---
And yes, especially battleships need some love.
---
&gt;What if you can't afford a titan but you can afford a carrier? 300m is a hell of a lot to that guy.
---
Am this guy. Got my first carrier this year. Don't have a super, or a titan, or 54 multiboxed rorq alts.
---
While I now have got myself to decent? levels of income, 300mil isn't the kind of money i'd call disposable.
---
Leave Highsec
---
This is truth.
---
It s only to monetize better and to kill the bot.
---
But if the playerbase dropps too much, it wont be profitable.
---
And dropping, oh yes it is!
---
Right now all I'm seeing is some narcissistic butthurts, while my day-to-day gameplay become a lot better than before the changes.
---
So maybe would you imagine that not all of eve is about nullsec safety and moving capitals back and forth?
---
They are the owners aren't they? 
---
Even if they arent involved in the day to day decisions it's hard to believe the owners of the product arent stiring the way the game develops
---
I used to play EVE between 2005 and 2010.
---
I came back recently to try it for a month and all I managed to find was either 20 man gatecamps (including sieged Dreads camping a lowsec entry), entirely empty systems or insane capital proliferation.
---
Trying to join a PvP corp, everyone is now just part of an alliance and they just want to fleet fight.
---
When I left, 20 carriers was a sight to see, now it seems like 20 titans is the norm.
---
I agree with you. I'm hopeful that we are seeing a short term downturn which will be followed by more sustainable growth as increasing diversity returns to the game.
---
There's something special about the spiky AB madness that triggers my happy muscle. Be it the Succubus, Imp, Phantasm or Fiend. One day I shall have them all!
---
Really hope you do more videos! That way noobs like me have something to believe in. :D
---
Already have a Succubus not too far from what you linked. Just need to use it more.
---
Maybe true now, still does not counter the fact, that the meta that actually killed EVE is the one that sovnull-miners want back ... But this won't help to retain more new players as NPE is shit (in large parts due to Goons deliberately fucking up Hisec to force people into their null empire).
---
Conflictium XD
---
So 5 alliances total?
---
What kind of eve player are you? Are more industry based? Trade based? Exploration or combat based? I agree with some points but not all.
---
Do the banking.
---
If they ever bring out barges, use smartbomb battleships to pop them all at once.
---
For every player not happy, there are ones perfectly fine. The issue was with Eve BEFORE the blackout. If you can go back and see the biggest problems, they are now currently being fixed. Little by little. Let's try and remember that Eve was declining all year, not just the last few months. 
---
You bring up perfectly acceptable issues that CCP needs to also fix, and by doing so I bet more people will come back. The current chaos era of Eve is shifting the game for a better tomorrow. Players need to be patient. 
---
Bot farms in null and the vast majority of multibox alting VNIs was a problem. Not so much any more. Whether they moved to high sec or just left is their preogative, but honestly they could continue whatever they did somewhere else or even stay in null if they accepted the risk. But they don't, so why should I care they left? 
---
I still take the risk. Do I get any credit for staying?
---
Today I have seen the lowest numbers logged on that I have ever seen in my 7 years of eve. Under 12k players logged in. For the past 6 months the numbers have continued to reduce. It would be likely that many will never come back.
---
Tonight I logged in with a few friends to go camp a gate and have a laugh. We saw one ship pass us in 3 hours of camping major null choke points. Is this the content promised? Or is this so famous content for a few groups in eve that apparently have ccp's ear that does not represent the majority of eve?
---
PT boat on the way to Korea, I use make a living man spewing diarrhea.
---
Now I'm a guy for the CIA, hooray. For the USA
---
Baby baby, make me loco, baby baby make mambo.
---
I too, enjoy subcap fleets being instantly deleted by any of 6-7 isboxed bombers on field in any sizable fight.
---
Yea  doesnt sound so bad      and if they need that ore or minerals in certain parts of capitol ships   people wanna have them
---
Did you mean to quote me? Because as far as I can see you're agreeing with me.
---
Is this fantasy happening every time or just once? If so, in bringing a Polaris. I win.
---
Its not that I don't see what you are saying; yes there has been an inflation in SP going on. However, its really the intersection of alpha clones and injectors, and not either of them on their own.
---
Perhaps the best fix is to not let extractors take a character below 20m sp. Or have special respec extractors that can take a char lower and have a lower SP penalty but extract directly to your free SP pool instead of creating an item?
---
That should put a serious hurt on SP farms without going back to the old model.
---
"again"?
---
I think I've missed some fun times
---
well, i guess in ten years (or less) everybody will be happy to get an "eve-classic offline" ... just for the nostalgy ofc not for krab
---
There's a lot of problems with this, but if man wants to be part of game - he definitely free to try. If he does have point - it's not for you to tell him he should not try and it's not for him.
---
I totally agree that videogames is not really accessible for blind person, but if he find way to participate and enjoying it - I am glad it's working for him. And if there's possible way to make it easier for him without hurting everyone(too open api leads to bots) - it'd be great if it'd be there.
---
He for sure has more of a plan that you have a brain
---
No one will agree with all. Everyone needs to make compromises for the greater good. Over the years I've actually done everything but combat an trade are my favourites.
---
Sounds good. If my 5 man wh crew can make you do all that to krab then it's totally worth watching you guys attrition away. :)
---
Well thats... why im here
---
THANK YOU
---
NullBlocs doomed the game to stagnation and death as people unsubscribe due to boredom (case in point: TEST went to war with the Chinese in order to give the line members something less boring than ratting to do between anomalies so they wouldn't get bored). It became necessary to make changes in order to shake things up even if some people stop playing.
---
Also:
---
If you you were maintaining your subscription by using the ISK from supercapital ratting or Rorqual mining to buy Plex, you weren't a customer anyway. You were a product being sold to the actual customers who spend real money on the services provided by CCP.
---
I don't think you understand how badly war burns out middle management/FC team/logistics team. Every alliance has a limited amount of those, and getting more is a painstakingly process. Heck, logistics people burn out during peacetime. If you expend them too recklessly you won't have enough when you actually need them for a thing.
---
So if you don't want to fight a "war" in order to conservative one of the few limited resources in EVE, you send your fleets to go hit non sov targets/their ratters, which is exactly what happens now.
---
A 100 cap on titans in a system is stupid. All it would encourage is people to just jam their titans in first and then the other side can't escalate.
---
RIP
---
This is the best point that needs to be made to each of these "oh my god guy's the game isn't for ME anymore, GUYS THE GAME SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY MEEEE!!!"
---
Thank you :D
---
I'm confused as to how leaving hisec would solve this problem.
---
Bitch -  ur mom. It your neighbor said -  he is  not liar.
---
Semper Fi, Vile Rat.
---
&lt;o
---
Probably not since any smart burner farmer who didn't already have faction pullers will have used the drugs to generate a small army of them. Burner farming generates huge numbers of storyline missions.
---
&gt; you will end up saying to this guy that he also can take boxing classes
---
funny that you mentioned boxing, in our group we have parts in training that is totally accessible for blind person. Of course it's like 10% of all, but if he does want to participate - it's possible.
---
And again, no one saying that he can be as efficient in EVE as not blind player. Even with full access to api(which will never happen) it's highly unlikely. But there's still activities he can be part of, and if he want to I think it's a good thing to help him.
---
Never flown a JF? Talk right out of your ass on reddit.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
no
---
I would say that Eve isn't for those mass of players leaving right now as well. What's the difference? They don't want to risk their ship... they just wanted easy no risk wealth in null... they don't want to form.proper fleets to defend themselves.
---
I mean... wouldn't you agree Eve isn't for them either? Seems like they had the same mentality and just wanted to be left alone. 
---
I agree with the poster. This community is toxic. I've been a hard working null sec member for a year and they still won't give me access to any corp hangars. Trust anyone is the most difficult part of the game.
---
Yes, fucking do that please, for the love of god, go smash stuff. Seriously that would be incredibly good for the health of the game. Go excercise the rage you feel at your lost ratting revenue on every region and portion of the game. You may find you accidentally save the game.
---
Tl,dr: don't threaten the non-carebears with a good time.
---
O7
---
Probably people who rely on carriers for home defense/ratting. That said, the knock on PvE effects have to be considered, since without fighters being able to apply on drugs you can't use carriers/supers to rat, and that leaves the situation where null PvE income scaling stops at Ishtar (which is not worth it in blackout), jumps to smartbombing mach's for the autistic, then straight up to Titan. Every below Titan instantly dies when tackled, Titans are well, Titans.
---
slice navy.
---
Im being a whiny bitch for not wanting the games population to drop and people to leave, resulting in less content for everyone? Jesus christ some people. You are essentially being a whiny bitch about the thought of someone else being a whiny bitch - which is worse?
---
There has never been a risk free nullsec, thats just a buzzword idiots use to try and make themselves feel more important, because somehow they are always at risk, cloaked in their ships, interdiction nullified looking for an easy kill. Good job bro.
---
This maze isn't meant for you.
---
o7
---
LOL.
---
I read the TLDR and was epecting a TLDR².
---
Then I got the long version.
---
Someone will always think of a solution good man. Balance it some how then the sov holder can have a cap limit of whatever number. Outside parties can only jump in x number but the system has a limit.  Example delve goons have 25 in system. Cap is hundred horde alliance arrive they can only jump in 25. Tnt arrive they can only jump 25 then frat arrive they reach the limit by jumping 25 in.
---
Its not perfect but a balance attempt so what happened I tribute don't happen again. They didn't even contest cause they couldn't. Its evening the field of combat no matter how many titans you have.
---
It'll increase the use of other class ships that can be countered.
---
Yeah, me and my two rorqs...
---
That is not the equivalent of "only bots are leaving". The player makes no such claim.
---
Can you find another example?
---
It really is, but it is the echo chamber that CCP use, you only need to look at /u/CCP_Falcon 's history here pushing the blackout and what not.
---
This response is the exact problem he is talking about. Good job showing us how cancer this sub is.
---
Reminds me of the reason Chernobyl exploded. The Xenon pit; there was a massive drain of the minority play-style, and now that they're trying to rectify that imbalance the majority play-style is going to drop sharply.
---
Say it loud and proud my brother. Don't let this place become like the official forums
---
I'm starting to like this goon.
---
Im not sure how long you've been here, but for those of us who have been here for the long haul, and anyone with a brain, has seen that CCP are quite incompetent when it comes to making changes that are good for the game. Just look at the state of things right now.
---
I'll be adding more as I find them.
---
You do realize how fucking dumb that logic is, right?
---
I’m a new bro who started playing alpha in March and Wow Classic definitely stole me away. I’m tempted to buy Plex just to support Eve since I love it.
---
I moved a cap today by myself. And wow I didn't even lose my arazu. It's almost like all this whining is done by salty noobs who can't 'get good'
---
That or mining chimeras for the board cap pilots
---
The majority of our players PvP also. Your premise that nullsec are only krabs who do nothing but PvE is unfounded.
---
&gt;If you can go back and see the biggest problems, they are now currently being fixed. Little by little. Let's try and remember that Eve was declining all year, not just the last few months.
---
What problems are these that are being fixed?
---
Bump them !         
---
They will be unable to mine and leave the area ... oh wait this don't work anymore.
---
Russian bitches be everywhere. Defend your home or die trying.
---
No no no no.... Rorqs need to be able for a small gang to solo overtime!
---
If they're using Augmented or Harvester mining drones, suicide gank the drones. If you're quick, in a 0.5 you can get 1-2 drones before CONCORDOKEN. Once they realize what's happening they'll move on, as you just killed their profits for the next few days.
---
If they're just using tech2 drones, or switch to tech2 drones, just fit up an SFI with a 500mn MWD and bump them. Increasing their range to the rock = reduces their ISK/hr and if you bump them out of drone range they make 0 ISK/hr. Do that long enough and they'll leave, even if they're bots (cuz a human has to come check on things eventually and will see what happened).
---
I agree with this man
---
also, I would add skill injectors makes null too available to new players. (IMHO)
---
&gt;PCU is disproportionately inflated by crabs
---
What the fuck is wrong with crabs? They provide content for hunters. Are you stupid or wilfully ignorant?
---
How do any of these help keep new players? None of these even affect new players.
---
Wait...EVE is a multiplayer game? [Mother of God....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwveuIRWxBo)
---
Rip
---
Actually they're flaky as fuck. Cant even tell a mother fucker fuck off. What kind of pussy makes up some bitch lie offering up 5%, the little cunt isn't even going to give me the respect to TRY and con me, That Russian Son of a whore needs to die.
---
Ah, you're stupid. You realise those crabs enable PvP, right? They create content, they pay taxes, they enable SRP, they sell minerals to alliances to build ships etc. etc...
---
Jesus christ some people.
---
It might be close, but it would still be a misrepresentation at best and a straw man at worst to equate it with "only bots are leaving".
---
The thing is, players *are* still there, and bots *have* been banned and multiboxing *has* been reduced.
---
Well, ok. What has that to do with reading?
---
Anything that reduces the number of capitals used is a plus.
---
Exactly. It's not a sustainable game world nor business model.
---
in the current /r/eve mentality, crabs are why eve is "being ruined" and the game would be better off if all of them quit.
---
Now that the goon has his foot in the door, time to open the Trojan horse and start pushing goongenda on everyone. But don't worry guys it's for your own good...
---
probably true
---
I didn't even know CCP was PA's now, wow, I know them for black desert online and they don't have a great reputation there.
---
This is the most ridiculous idea that I have heard, what the hell is wrong with the people who think this?
---
Death to us all in game, death to us all in game
---
I guess I also don't understand what the aversion is to them fielding a ton of titans is. They have them, they outnumber the other side. They win. I don't get this idea of "Oh this 30k+ alliance should only be allowed to bring these types and this number of ships to a fight" That just leans towards instanced PvP and defeats the entire purpose of an open world. 
---
We don't do that anywhere else. You don't limit the people on a gate camp, or a highsec gank. It's not fair to the lonely barge he has to fight off 10 dudes or whatever, we tell him how to work around it. Oh no, goons have titans, how do we force rules on them?!
---
You don't recognize that "bitter vets" can be damaging to the game?
---
Always remember. 
---
Eyes forward capsuleer. The cyno is now lit.
---
The hypocrisy is palpable.
---
DED sites, Abyssals or missions in npc space are things people can already do but yeh, ratting in general is a system that has been suboptimal at best since pretty much ever and really needs an overhaul or an alternative.
---
With Titans you're pointing at something that needs to be looked at aswell though to get a shift away from the cap meta which is HAW guns.
---
&gt; He tells me to go away
---
&gt; I tell him to shut up
---
&gt; He calls me a hypocrite
---
How is that a response that makes sense in this context?
---
I agree FW should be fix, especially the Tama gate to HS. My last 5 times come to that gate ended in lose a pod by instant kill capitals camping from the other side. CCP should allow NPC to act in this case like Caldari State mobilize Titans and othet capital ships to take back Tama and players can contribute to this operation by different ways to get LP (like logistics and sabotage logistical systems).
---
Cause if you're not playing the game the way he plays the game then you're doing it wrong.
---
I explain in the last paragraph what is wrong with making money while watching Netflix. When you can crab with no effort or risk that translates in lower ISK per hour for everyone else because you value your time less. EXACTLY the same as bots. And you can still crab AFK you just provide more content in the cynogeddon/blackout era :) 
---
Finish reading the comments next time lol
---
I don't think you understand how that's a player created problem. If the only option for PvP is large scale fights, of course you need a lot of FC's and skilled FC's aren't super common, you need a lot of logistics ran by a small group in short time, etc.. That's not really an issue in smaller scale fights and groups... except the big blocs have rendered those nonexistant.
---
The sensible thing to do for players that want PvP in blocs would be to break off and form their own group to get fights with other small groups out to do the same, but nobody wants to leave the safety the blocs provide. The cyno changes, despite being cried about as being bad with threads like this very one complaining about player numbers right after the change, are probably the first thing in a long time to offer more chance to smaller groups to exist alongside the big blocs without just getting dunked endlessly at no risk to the blocs.
---
Yeah, I was hoping for some food for thought, but there was nothing to think about in that post.    
---
&gt; Fight more wars, duh      
---
Thanks for the tip. The last war was headshotted by CCP in the form of Drifter attacks at home.
---
You'd have to make sure the m3 was high enough to need a hauler, or you'd be spending your evening collecting t1 fit kestrel kills on new players lol
---
This is exactly right. Let's look at what has happened: the VC investments of the last several years were ultimately successful despite failures in development of other titles. The PA acquisition was their exit and started a new chapter. They would have looked at the books and seen that EVE was "closing in on a billion" revenue (hence the acquisition price of $425m.
---
However, they would also have seen that the player base had a consistent downward trend but, I suspect, increasing revenue from new monetisation strategies (skins, store, injectors). So their decision to purchase CCP was based on 1) earning potential from EVE, 2) new revenue streams from new projects, and 3) CCP engineering capability.
---
New revenue streams would include the new mobile game which was frankly a no-brainer for a company like PA. But the earning potential from EVE is the interesting one for us. What do you do with a declining player base that is still generating substantial revenue? 
---
You can either milk it for as long as you can, in which case you would see a long tail with, presumably, a revenue spike toward the end when they cashed out with all sorts of preposterous money grab tactics. Or you can roll the dice and try to renew the game for a new audience.
---
And that's what they decided on. The board gave Hilmar the go-ahead to shake things up, to take risks and try to refresh the game. This, combined with NPE improvements, is what they are hoping will bring the next wave of players.
---
I guess I don't get why you care about someone krabbing making a ton of isk that you never fight. Why do you care if he's there or not?
---
Sure, there are counters. It's just that they are the same counters everytime. If more of the smaller classes could counter bigger stuff with a reasonable survivability, we would see more variety is all i'm saying.
---
You need to stop with this. The last time there was resources scarcity we ended with an oligarchy of a few people regulating the market of a critical moon material for their own profit.
---
When the blue donut is over all of nullsec no resource will make a war because the lords will simply trade between themselves.
---
Am in goons. Even I know we a ridiculously unfair advantage over the rest the server. We got our shit together an organised, worked for the greater good. Having that unfair of an advantage is not good for the game. Sure you limit titans but everything else fair game. It just makes the game a bit more than push f1 together and watch the fire works. It allows counter play.
---
Killing afk crabs is the lowest form of PVP. It's basically clubbing defenseless people whose entire point is they want the best tics per hour so they gimped their ships combat ability. 
---
Of course most people crab one way or another to make ISK. As I explained we want to give money to active people and take money away from people who watch Netflix while multiboxing. That way more money goes towards people who are more likely to then go use it to PVP.
---
There are way to many bitter-vets and bitter-ex, who simply want to see this game fail just becaue they are bitter.
---
You are making a completely unfounded and ridiculous assumption that you can crab with complete immunity. You cannot. There is always a risk. If someone is watching netflix and not paying attention, they are an easier target than if they were actively invested in the game. 
---
You may bring up the ridiculous program that informed people of hostiles in local, which CCP should have dealt with a long time ago, but didn't. But even in that case, login traps are still a thing.
---
The problem here is that hunters want easy kills, while pve'ers want safer pveing. Both sides fight against one another, they are different sides of a coin, and the fact that some people are honestly suggesting one side of the coin be removed entirely is fucking astounding.
---
RIP Vile Rat o7
---
Eeeew blooobbs
---
On a consistent downward trend for many years, hence the need for a shake up. It is a gamble but the alternative was an inevitable decline.
---
RIP o7
---
If this works. I'll send you 100 million isk.
---
Wormholers are not making the mainstay of money in Eve, while highsec is close behind it. Nullsec has plumetted down drastically in terms of isk made. All because of the mentality you are espousing right now. You've essentially helped to destroy content in nullsec because the pendulum has swung so far its stuck in the wall called "FUCK NULLSEC".
---
Just needs to hit zero and it'll bounce right back up.
---
Haven't played in years, this still hit me in the feels. Enjoy the silver o7
---
No. Watching Netflix while playing the game is objectively bad. I don't want to club seals when I go PVP. I want watching Netflix to not be profitable so the dudes who play the game actively get more money and then go PVP with it.
---
And no moving my p1 stacks to factory planets.
---
It gives them more options in high sec when the start eases them into pvp. Gets them into groups for pve. Don't say incursions do that they don't. You need bling for them. Itll get some them gankers out high sec least for a short while. If they real story arc campaigns with actually story they will stick around longer. Not just dumped in a rookie channel with 1000 other people where there voice is lost. They have options the agency window is a great edition it just needs much more options.
---
I think a damage control would be more appropriate
---
I don't disagree with this, citadel mechanics are a large part of the problem. Like i said in a reply to a comment somewhere in this thread, CCP's changes are not the best.
---
I just feel that CCP is afraid to touch the really important stuff (citadels, asset safety and capital rebalance vs subcaps), because of the level of complaining it would create.
---
I've always thought that sub cap guns / fighter so be able to, " deal with subs" but no dominate them, a threat but one with that is controllable.
---
It shouldn't be "oh shit a cap bloob, run" 
---
More " oh careful  caps on grid."
---
if sub caps are with them that's when you should be worrying, that the moment when you need to decide "can we remove the sub caps, from the caps or do we need to pull them away / run."
---
Make your own game. I'll wait.
---
Lol no. Nullsec economies have been inflated since citadels and rorqs provided absolute umbrella safety. Nullsec should never have been allowed to safely generate so much wealth.
---
What? You are going to make pretty much the same isk/tick watching netflix or not watching, because ratting is boring as fuck. You want to force people to be even more bored with something that hasnt changed in years?
---
Let me make this simple. Large battles don't just happen in a vacuum, you need pve'ers to make the resources, pvpers to use the resources, leadership to organise the pvpers and pve'ers to make sure everything is efficient and then fight one another. 
---
With this current state of eve, large fights are not going to happen, because leaderships of alliances will not put their empires at risk because CCP is having a midlife crisis. 
---
You are wanting something that just isn't ever going to happen. I hope you know that.
---
I clicked this bcuz i tough it was about wow clasdic
---
Blowback is a bummer.
---
Lmao just get paid more for flying a jf.
---
This deserves the copypasta status more than most of the used copypastas here alltogether
---
No.
---
Why would we change your mind? That's exactly what it is, with a side of mobile monetisation. Bring it on, looks good.
---
I don't really think this is the case. Let's say you want to hard limit a system. Goons or anyone with a numerical advantage will just hit multiple systems. Think everyone is just going to sit around and wait? No, they'll go hit an undefended system and force the defenders to either split their own forces or leave some to lose. 
---
Any method of forced balance in an open world like this is going to have a workaround.
---
Nice bot.  Couple suggestions:
---
1.  Probably shouldn't use EVE assets for your icon.  Who knows if this will cause issues for you at somepoint.  A cool looking wormhole icon would be better anyways.
---
2. I agree with the other comment that there is too much data.  Things like the statics coming in as a second message just seems very extraneous.  Condensing is better.  For example, you could convey the static information on the first line like : "J141001 C4/C3+C5" rather than two additional messages
---
3.  No idea what the reaction icons are for.  At least mention them in your docs.  Unfortunately they don't allow for any interaction so they also seem extraneous.  Their presence makes me want to click them and that doesn't do anything :)
---
4.  Keep up the good work!
---
_witness me_
---
You have the entirety of the service being offered under your control.
---
More like "product quality becomes bad, customers use product in ways that creates even worse results, attention is drawn to the fact, then they wonder why it has to be changed to not be bad".
---
I'm not saying the exact changes we got are the best, but changes are definitely needed.
---
&gt;Quality assurance is totally out the fucking window
---
Are you insinuating issues like these are new? Hell, when structures came out, for the longest time (2+ years, not sure if it still is the case today but i wouldn't be surprised) trying to move anything from a corporate delivery bay to a character's hangar plainly didn't work, despite it being a rightclick option.
---
These changes missing QA aren't really new, and i don't think it really says anything about CCP's upper management.
---
Large groups can have "smaller fights", I go on ~100 man roams with my corp. But we don't threaten anything that's not a dumb ratter/rorq and in the long term those are inconsequential. 
---
&gt; first thing in a long time to offer more chance to smaller groups to exist alongside the big blocs without just getting dunked endlessly at no risk to the blocs.
---
We've made recon alt training mandatory and implemented alliance recon stockpiles. It will take maybe 1-2 months before recons are everywhere.
---
That escalated quickly...
---
Rorqs are aids, but they were implemented by CCP, yet you are blaming nullsec people are using a tool CCP put in place? 
---
Once again, and let me make this even more noticeable for you since you are having trouble **THERE IS NO WAY TO SAFELY GENERATE ISK IN EVE, THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK, EVEN IF UNDER AN UMBRELLA**.
---
Exactly right.
---
You've been missing the point completely for the past ten comments.
---
1. Bot/AFK crab mines 5 hours in a day
---
2. Normal person mines 5 hours in a week
---
3. Bot needs to buy PLEX so he undercuts everyone to sell their ore reducing the price of ore
---
4. Normal person can't compete with the bot for the price so they sell cheaply as well
---
BOTS AND AFK CRABS DO NOT VALUE THEIR TIME SO THEY DEVALUE EVERYONE ELSES TIME BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS ONE BIG MARKETPLACE
---
Yup, if they could effectively market it as "Rust in space, get your friends together, survive harsh odds and environments and carve out a place for  yourself", it could pull in a part of that demographic.
---
There are still people across various gaming genres who like harsh, punishing gameplay that makes winning feel important.
---
lol, imagine thinking that CCP's board didn't give approval for what's going on. Honestly, the strategy is crystal clear whether you agree with the direction or not.
---
maybe it isn't. CCP have slowly forgotten over the years what made EVE special and have instead tried to compromise on features to try and draw in a larger crowd. 
---
I think they've started realising this and understand the long term health of the game is being harmed by inviting people in who have no intention of interacting with other players
---
It doesn't matter if CCP did it or players did it to themselves lol.
---
No matter how many upvotes this get, it will be an underrated post.
---
That alt usually was running on a cash subscribed account back then (better for CCP) and it was not instant, as these Chars had to be trained, by hand without skill queue .. up hill in the snow ... both ways ... ya know?
---
So what the fuck else do you propose?
---
Goons break into Goonswarm 1, Goonswarm 2, Goonswarm 3, and Goonswarm 4, with shared services, shared auth, shared mumble, etc. Each holding on to a couple ratting constellation in Delve. When the fight comes, each Goonswarm 1-4 jump in 25 titans each and nobody else gets to bring any.
---
everyone  ≠ goons
---
I really should note that that page is out of date, for sites which don't work any more.

&gt;BOTS AND AFK CRABS DO NOT VALUE THEIR TIME SO THEY DEVALUE EVERYONE ELSES TIME BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS ONE BIG MARKETPLACE
---
Are you thick? Crabs are people too, if those "normal people" don't understand how to easily crab then that is their fault, they need to get good. 
---
As for bots, CCP needs to step up their game vs bots, go whine at them for that, rather than advocate the destruction of an entirely legitimate play-style just because you are butthurt that bots are making your time worth less.
---
When someone actually thinks drifters stopped a “war”... spodbless
---
Cause then you can drop a Hel on them.
---
What is best is when players are figuring out how to play the game. EVE is a solved problem today and the immense might of the major blocs is clear evidence of that.
---
They're not trying to ruin the game. They're just trying to ruin your game. So HTFU.
---
I agree, Rorqs need a massive nerf, but you are not advocating that, you want to remove an entire playstyle from the game, which is nuts.
---
Oh wait, you mean actually play the game? Crazy idea!
---
You sure as fuck are a moron if you don't understand how the difference between actively playing the game and watching Netflix affects how people value the product of their game activity when it comes to selling it.
---
I don't disagree at all with your assessment of how things came to be.
---
But that's exactly the reason i don't mind a few nerfs here and there: at some point adding new things will cause another imbalance, so maybe they need to simply cut stuff off the game to return it to a previously working state.
---
Like i always say, i'm not sure the changes we got are the best changes to fix the situation (personally, i would rebalance caps vs subcaps, change citadel mechanics, nerf asset safety and add sov objectives for smaller ship classes). But at least they show a willingness from CCP to recognize the problem finally.
---
You don't recognise that your stupid ideas and advocacy for this nonsense can be damaging too?
---
Local has existed since the beginning of eve . We have had conflict with eve . The super proliferation is part of the fact that people can move and dock supers just about anywhere without any consequence . When supers used to space coffins literally one could not own 5 titans and say "already replaced" . Asset safety did not exist when there were outposts .and there was still 80% of eve in Null . But there was a risk to living in null at the same time while you were there you could make money . Now have safety to live but no way to make money . Counter productive for a player to undock ? when your dock point is safe as a fortress . You make the fortress a crystal palace and make sure people undock .
---
Botting is not allowed in EvE: Online, a massively multiplayer online submarine simulator.
---
I still don't understand this change.
---
Once upon a time we had supercarriers that one-shot battleships, and tracking titans that could blap frigates and interceptors. This was heavily abused by the small number of groups with the critical mass of supers to do so. Everyone else worked hard to build their supercapital fleet so they could do the same. They were nerfed so neither could effectively apply damage to subcaps. 
---
For a time, it was good.
---
Then someone had the idea to bring this back. Let supercarriers not just hurt subcaps but also warp scram them with their fighters. Give titans guns specifically for killing subcaps. Let's throw in a small AOE doomsday for good measure. Nobody else seemed to have a problem with this at the time for reasons I don't fully understand, but it brought us back to the bad old days.
---
wormhole groups will scan and bookmark the anoms in their home system and statics. this means that corp members can warp to any of them without having to scan the anoms down. most groups wont farm their home hole and instead use any sites etc as bait.
---
You just don't get it do you? Ratting is boring as sin, mining is boring as sin, if people want to have a film on their second monitor while they cycle modules, more power to them. Suggesting this should not be a thing is ridiculous. You want people to focus entirely on the most monotonous thing in the game. 
---
I like the idea of CCP making NPCing or mining far more engaging, meaning you have to concentrate a bit more. But trying to say that, currently, people shouldn't watch netflix while doing easy/boring tasks in eve is just stupid.
---
I can and did, and a lot of players seem to agree with me. It's not only about efficiency and min-maxing what the game gives you. It's about player and culture and mentality as well, and that's outside CCP's hands.
---
CCP can make a part of the game imbalanced. But CCP can't teach players to not be crybabies when a balance pass brings their unicorn gameplay back into line. That's all on the players themselves.
---
lets w8 for the september MER, cause if its gonna be same amount of kills and jumps and 5k pcu less, i dont think i could care less. On the other hand, i live in EUTZ perhaps other tzs are suffering much more and i have no way to know.
---
that´s neither a current mentality nor a mentality unique to r/eve
---
Nice rebuttal. Good job. You're the best!
---
CCP has never ever even been close to a billion in revenue... not even adding up every year they have been in business would you hit a billion.
---
Looking at their last revenue statements publicly available (through 2015) http://marketsforisk.blogspot.com/p/ccp-financials-my-attempt.html
---
Then looking at the public statement from Pearl Abyss on CCP revenues: https://nosygamer.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-pearl-abyss-q2-2019-investors-call.html
---
CCP has actually had negative years and positive years, but talking about just revenue (not profit, two different things) they are at best a $60mil a year company.
---
Indeed, its true too.
---
never said it was
---
It is a matter of definition, in my definition everyone that started EVE after Citadel patch March 2016 is "a new player" that does not know anything else except the hellokitty-FarmVille-Meta implemented starting with this patch. And "old" players are the ones that started EVE at least prior to 2009 Dominion patch. 
---
At the moment by this definition, blackout drives away "new players" and makes "old" players resub/have fun again. Weird .. isn't it?
---
Are they mining off your Athanors? Or just the regular belts? If it's off your Athanor you can always make sure to get first cut by detonating the rock when you want to mine instead of waiting for auto-fragment. If it's a regularly spawning belt? Not a lot you can do about that. You can bump them off the belts to a distance where they can't easily mine. Mining drones are REALLY slow, so a bit of distance really cuts into their profits. If you're willing to make up a 1/2 dozen Alpha clones you can suicide gank their drones. Not cheap, since even a cheap frigates cost more than cheap drones, but effective. If they have no drones they can't mine. Or just shrug and let them mine. There are lots of rocks out there.
---
The entire point of the cyno changes and blackout is to make those tasks less AFK by forcing people to pay attention to the game or lose ships. Whether it's boring or not doesn't matter when it comes to what I'm saying. If people can do it in a profitable way while not exerting any effort they drive the price down for everyone else. CCP is trying to adjust that by making you exert more effort.
---
Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit.
---
Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock. For the cyno is not yet lit.
---
Break free of the station and witness the universe before you. For the cyno is not yet lit.
---
Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait. For the cyno is not yet lit.
---
Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them.
---
The cyno is now lit.
---
Correction: The cyno is NOT lit due to recent patches.
---
Why not put together your own survey system in a serious of phases and then present it to CCP?
---
It's quite common for people to be unable to think about effects of changes beyond the immediate direct effect on them.
---
Why are there so few buffalo to hunt? I've been hunting buffalo my whole life and it's never been this bad. Someone needs to fix this!
---
shoot blues, tell vile rat.
---
&gt; Crabs are people too, if those "normal people"
---
so are people willfully and intentionally living on welfare checks
---
You have to gain meaning from something, right?
---
The problem with your idea is that the changes simply inconvenience the larger blocks, rather than stop the issue all together. They are the most able to burst up alts with a cyno, cloaked on grid, ready to drop should anything attack them while they are chilling/mining/ratting. This hits those who dont have those resources. You are essentially advocating making the game harder for those who don't have resources in the first place.
---
Ah the man himself, thanks for the reply. If i use the 'power query' what URL should i use to collect all the market data from jita? 
---
Just this? https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/aggregates/?station=60003760
---
Thats just a ridiculous comparison.
---
Exactly it makes attacking strategies more important. And with cyno changes as well you need a lot more thought put into how you deploy but also move your ships. You can't move an enormous force into one system you now need 10. Makes eve like chess planning multiple moves ahead. If you bringing a 100 titans each jump requires you having 5 different cyno an systems to move to. On top that now holding them is an issue. Since only 25 can be in space at once.
---
It's obviously not perfect just a balance attempt idea..
---
Like everything the game throughs at us goons will adapt first. Followed by the others. Its just to make it fun. Titans glassing everything ain't fun. It's a site to behold, but not fun.
---
Indeed, clearly you gain meaning for spouting bullshit on reddit. Fulfilling eh?
---
I can see where you're coming from. I may disagree in parts, but i can respect the viewpoint.
---
Interestingly though, your comment perfectly highlights what i said in my original reply. Null used to be the place to go for people who wanted to fight each other first and foremost. Not the place to go for people who wanted to print isk and maybe get dropped once in a while (with a pretty good chance of being saved as well) just to to spice up an otherwise afk-able activity.
---
What you describe is exactly the change in the player demographic that currently inhabits null that i was referring to.
---
Which item gives options in highsec or eases a new player into pvp?
---
RIP Vile Rat.
---
The problem is that there is not a lot of drama going on in EVE currently, so all people have to post about is blackout.
---
I wish we could go back to the era of Cymek posts, even the Drone war had more enjoyable content on reddit and I was on the *loosing* side for that one...
---
That's another aspect of it but I'd like to see you come up with a change that affects large blocks and not small players. It's very hard to come up with any change where the people who have already stockpiled a bunch of resources aren't the ones best equipped to deal with it.
---
Someone added injectors and then dangled big end game ship carrots in front of everyone. Just saying.
---
if this is a genuine how, then it's a frig from before rigs had sizes.
---
https://gameranx.com/img/12-Sep/propaganda.jpeg
---
Because they don't exist in a vacuum. Their isk and minerals mess up the market.
---
Completely agree. People expect things to stay the same, while some things change, but eve is having such a cataclysmic change right now, that I have never seen since 2003, it is really worrying me. Yet we have people here, one in particular I am discussing with right now, who is suggesting that people watching netflix while ratting or mining should not happen. My mind boggles. Somehow passively watching a program on netflix while cycling modules and keeping an eye on local is reducing the worth of isk for everyone in the game. It's not the bots, its the people who netflix and chill with eve.
---
It really is, because crabs put effort in. Those people don't.
---
Right now none that's why I proposed the change in the post above.
---
Riskless high income PVE behind an acceleration gate for me.
---
Riskless low income PVE in an open anom for thee.
---
This is very accurate.
---
r/eve 120k members 
---
Eve Online average active playerbase \~10k and dropping. (and thats including alts).
---
Numbers dont lie.
---
I've been here long enough to know the past wasnt as rose tinted as you see it.
---
Remember skynet carriers?
---
Yeah when people in blocs start regarding 100 man roam as "smaller fight" i think we have the core of the issue nailed down, because short of a random other 100 man roam (very unlikely to happen, let alone for you to engage) it's either blob, kill something that can't really fight or no fight at all.
---
I think you mistake what I’m talking about. I’m not talking about the age of accounts that are resubbing or not. I’m talking about the acquiring is subs versus the attrition of players unsubbing.  Whether they are 10+ year players or fresh in the pod players, if the number rejoining is less than then the ones leaving then that is worrying.
---
EVE is life.
---
In the last month, people have been foaming at the mouth hard about PvE and goons ruining everything about eve, and everything they have to say is wrong, biased and evil.
---
The blackout hasn't magically fixed all the flaws with EVE, but they really really wanna pretend its "fixing" it somehow, and anything counter to that narrative gets rabidly attacked.
---
This just in: poster believes in 0.4x revenue 
---
 valuation of CCP games
---
&gt; I can and did
---
Then you're a dumbfuck.
---
They wouldn't be doing it for free, the worst that could happen is they ask you for more ISK than it's worth.
---
Because there isnt enough carebears on the csm, you are the man ccp needs.
---
Wew that CSM Meetup has some quick impact, Goons now joining DCPL-Fleets .... ;-P
---
are they?
---
its okay to seek help for your mental retardation
---
That went 0 -&gt; 100 real quick.
---
I can only imagine that it was a badly thought out vision to try to get more of these media effective battles. Skill injectors / citadels to make it easy to get into and less of a hassle to keep the big toys and high application weapon systems and superweapons to make them the ultimate goal. And more people in big ships = more big battles, right?  
---
(Honestly though that's prolly far from the truth but i can't really find any sense in it either so might aswell bring up an idea)
---
This isn't another aspect, this is the prime aspect of it. It does nothing to fix the stagnancy of the game in any way shape or form. The only change I can see that would change this is to make space worth more, but make it harder to obtain and punish those who have huge numbers of players. 
---
Essentially, implement an upkeep cost for alliances per player. Attach sov and isk payouts by rats to the owning alliance. The more people in a system, the less isk per rat, spreading people out, but the more people in the alliance, the higher the upkeep is. People outside of the alliance get a drastically reduced payout from rats. This means larger alliances make a choice, either pay huge sums to keep people together or splinter into smaller groups and take up unused areas of space and pay lower bills. The same should be done to mining in the way isk payout per rat is reduced for non-alliance members in the system, ore per tick would reduce too. I have no idea of an RP reason for this shit, but it forces players to spread and reduces size. More entities results in more friction. Systems being worth something means people will fight over them more. Will it stop small groups from creating massive alliances? No, but the more separate groups the more likelihood it is that people will fight.
---
You're making my point for me...
---
Grief... About losing pixels that form an imaginary space ship in a fantasy universe...
---
There a Lot of things out there to be grief about. If you really feel that bad about a GAME, maybe the problem isnt in the game itself.
---
*crickets*
---
&gt; Except the gankers aren't cringe posting and saying 'fucking pussy cowards' when a group of procurers dock up to their PVP gang that outnumbers them 3 to 1.
---
This has been mainstream eve discourse for the last five years.
---
No, they don't transport their ships to the place they want to rat/mine. They don't operate their ships. They don't sell their ore/re-ammo their ship. Cmon.
---
Of course not, it belongs to Pearl Abyss.
---
How do these kind of vacuous bullshit posts get upvoted on this reddit? This place is ridiculous.
---
I agree we need resource scarcity but cynogeddon and blackout are making it objectively harder for big blocs to get Intel and drop caps. Not as hard as you may want but it is a step in the right direction.
---
To their credit legacy has been relatively relaxed on the eve is dying salt posts. Maybe a year of war has hardened them a bit.
---
What, fixing skynet was a bad thing?
---
That's explicitly *not* what the new change does, do you even *read* these change logs?
---
Says the guy who can't form a proper reply because he just had a stroke over a video game, so he''ll just throw around insults instead.
---
To put it in a language you can understand, would you like some pepper with your salt?
---
It's not, because its having a massive and cataclysmic effect on the risk/reward in null-sec, meaning less people are there for content generation. This is a leap in the wrong direction, off a cliff even. It's ridiculously bad. I'm genuinely worried about eve right now. I've invested years of time into this game, for it to be shit on by stupid and badly thought changes.
---
The MCT lets you train skills on a second  character on the same account. Doesn't cost you anything extra and you could have the second character training something that will get you passive income, like PI.
---
I smell a suicide gank. 
---
Where we droppin boys
---
The fact it was an issue in the first place.
---
Its ok, its just bots and useless people who dont like to sit cloacked in safety for hours to gank a mining ship (elite pvper btw). All the charts, graphs and facts for a declining player base are nonsence and we all know it, UNLESS, god forbid, CCP decide to fuck with my perfect hunting intel tools, my cozy cloack you cannot counter or my massive isk/h wh farming income. Then ill write a 5k essay to spin the numbers in my thesis favor. The meta is klling the game, thats all. I live in high sec but since all the elite pvpers like me say nullsec people are killing the game, ill say it aswell. Hurr durrr nullsec krabbs, perfect intel, cap profiliration(never flown a cap btw, dont even know how they work), goon bad, tapi bad.
---
You mean they will have to actually put effort into their game? XD
---
Carebears bashing over carebears itt eve 2019
---
k
---
If you think that's basically a 1 to 1 mapping to the extent the numbers allow, a sticky would basically be seen by the entire playerbase. But not even the lowest of effort can be expected from this community. It's almost as if they are happy as it is.
---
A big part of the problem is people reducing this to bots and krabs. 
---
If the botting numbers were big enough to explain the player drops, the game is in far worse shape than anyone realized. Fortunately I think it's a safe bet that botters are not the bulk of the lost players. There has already been some evidence posted on reddit of them simply moving to other sources of income. This actually makes things worse since if the botters are moving rather than leaving since it means we're losing actual players.
---
Using the buffalo analogy, hunters need buffalo. If you exterminate the buffalo you run out of things to hunt. Without PvE, a game turns into the twilight days of Ultima Online, the same small groups of PKs running around killing each other endlessly. But this isn't even quite the case. The vast majority of krabs in nullsec are also PvPers who just need a source of income. So when they're not serving as content while making money, they're out trying to shoot people. The notion that krabs contribute nothing other than sitting there making isk is willful ignorance or dishonesty.
---
It's just based on Hilmar's comment on Talking in Stations
---
RIP Hilary for President.
---
you will warp in 3 minutes unless someone will point you &lt;3min, constantly
---
Please explain to me how that has anything to do with bumping them further away from the rocks to decrease isk/hr.
---
I can't agree with you any more than I already do. It's ridiculous.
---
That is all well and good, but I am just pointing out that CCP has never been, never will be a Billion revenue company. And the legal statements proves that.
---
The closest thing that CCP has done to that might be CCPlease. Where people get to publish their ideas to a Dev. The problem with agreeing to communities proposed solutions is that the people in the community are already giving their money to CCP. That would work fine for player retention, but that's only a portion of the business model. They also have to be looking at new player retention. From what I understand that's a huge issue at CCP right now, and is eating up a lot of their dev time. I like the game, I play the game, CCP takes my money. There are all sorts of neat things I'd like to see, but my corpmates are very good at telling me to sit down and shut up. Most of the suggestions I come up with I am told are too big, and would break the game.
---
I agree that player surveys could come up with innovative solutions, but then they'd have too tell us what their plans are moving forward, which they don't seem interested in doing. No peeking at your Christmas presents early I suppose. I've noticed that they've been very careful to keep most of the Triglavian content unavailable on the test server to prevent people getting early ideas.
---
Goons: why can’t we all get along?
---
As the OP said, the irony is real.
---
&lt;looks at the alliance tag&gt;  
---
&lt;clicks 'Alliance member already replaced'&gt;
---
I guess the big questions are:
---
Are CCP comfortable with lower Player Counts while the desired player endographic shifts back to adrenaline junkies, Machiavellians, murderers, pirates  and masochists / frontiersmen?
---
Does the kind of unforgiving game eve was,  (in 2004 to whenever it jumped the shark), even have a market now? 
---
Can CCP walk a line between what seems to be two diametrically opposed paradigms of "Empire builders" and "Barbarians"?
---
( I was brought up on getting a line vector Cobra MK III to dock without a docking computer, matching that station spin was a life skill, 2004 eve had the same edge for me when I first started. I am not sure that someone brought up on candycrush saga, farmville or whatever will have the same pre-conceptions)
---
have you considered that Goonswarm is a primary factor in the games decline?
---
if goons really wanted to do something good for the game they'd kick 25,000 people from their alliance and awox every friendly structure outside of delve. lastly they should suicide 80% of the cap fleet and supercap fleet. you'd still have the largest single alliance in the game, the largest capital fleet, and the largest supercap fleet. but the game would be much healthier for it.
---
you've won eve. nobody wants to play a game someone has already won. whats the point.
---
this helios should have astero bro
---
an issue for many years mind you
---
that´s what normal people would consider doing chores.
---
I got the response i expected.
---
also was almost suicide ganked by some tornadoes a few days ago after doing a t4 so there's that :))
---
This was the next issue I was going to bring up if the chap above replied. CCP have shown numerous times how bad they are at implemented changes to the game.
---
anything with drones is a problem because they are automated . Rorquals were not really an issue, it was the way they could mine and how easily they could be multiboxed in safety . Why not use fighter mechanics has been suggested more than 2 billion times . Make the yield better for solo mining . Make it so that if more than one 2 or 3 rorqs are mining in the same belt it causes asteroids to disappear. But naaa we changes cynos first because they are bigger problem now :P
---
reminds me homeworld 2 underwater mod.
---
Sad that you are leaving. Dont mind these people with their rants, theyre honestly idiots. Same people that are telling you that its good that you are leaving are the very same people that think people will magically flock to this game if you break it enough. They dont see that the philosophy of griefing doesnt work, it never did.
---
And they will never accept that they in fact are the problem of this game.
---
You don’t see a slope because it *isn’t there!*
---
It's off an athanor, yea. And yea, I mean could could just keep em in the station. That wouldn't be horrible. I tried ganking their t2 drones and one of them left, but the other was stubborn bastard. Thanks for the advice man.
---
RIP brother. #KillaryForPrison
---
Indeed, those people still do chores, and play a game the way they want to play it. More power to them, less to you and your toxic bullshit.
---
Crazy to think that this is one of the events that got Trump elected.
---
You'd do better getting info from random reddit threads, really.
---
Ooof the facts...
---
I'm just saying I already tried being friendly, they saw that as weakness.
---
Eve is mine.
---
So what, you argue like Im was the one who did that shit or that I somehow think this sub is any way not massively toxic. And it doesnt even matter, we are not CCP and us having an opinion which mainly came from a vocal majority that hates blocs doesnt matter.
---
CCPs decision however does.
---
Oh look, another useless post saying "my brain is to small to understand the big picture"
---
Nor those it stay afloat by listening to clients who clearly don t understand the big picture or the constraints of creating the product. Yourself posting this garbage is literally an in facto example of how can someone be a very high level player (not mechanically) and at the same time not understand intricacies behind the scenes or even some of the more general concepts of the product. With due respect to your achievements and decently witty writeups, you are pretty deep in your own ass scooter.
---
You have to either predict a change in the market ahead of time, for example seeing that the Caldari are losing control of the warzone and buying up Drake Navy Issues because you think that they are going to go up soon, or you have to place buy orders of your own, and then turn around and sell the items you buy with sell orders. 
---
The first option is riskier and harder to do well, but the second one is boring as hell because you have to spend all your time .01 isking people
---
i was able to kill all 5  harvester mining drones in  0.6 system
---
scythe fleet issue  3 auxiliary thrusters  then full rack of overdrives and 500mn with cap booster/recharger.. surely you will catapult them off sky.
---
suicide ganking orca using talos is ineffective. 10 manticores will evaporate it
---
Capital mining should never have existed, that's the reason the game got to this point.
---
CCP lease when will wrecks be scannable with combat probes.
---
Way to respectfully pay your condolences by turning it into a political statement fucktard.
---
try smartbomb mallers  just get  into drone swarm and set off.
---
I dont even get why he is mentioning r/eve. Like who cares what we say, we dont have the power to ban anyone. And like you say CCP said they had evidence that foul play was at hand and dealt the deathblows only to reverse them completely when they actually investigated.
---
We are planning to send out the code for the SKIN to all participants later this week :)
---
perimeter :D
---
Only 5?

evry 2 minutes login   suicide ibis alt with fitted scram so  bump scram  when it dies,log it off and get next  suicide scrammer untill you bump them far away
---
Well to him it probably is (or maybe was) his fun. Eve did, and should, support many different playstyles which means many different goals or measuring sticks.
---
There is nothing wrong with that being his measuring stick. But there's nothing wrong with others having a different one either. To me though max ISK/hr as the primary measurement is a strong sign that Goons have become what they recruited.
---
That they can just warp off and back to the spot and you need to bump them again ... and again ... and again.       
---
While they reduce your isk/h on moon you paid for (aka put and rigged athanor and paid for fuel) this person can always mine something before it will be bumped.              
---
Before you could just bump someone away keeping him from "stealing your ore". If you were smart you could bump this miner to the structure itself and then just semi afk bump it to the edge structure as he could not warp off bumping from the athanor and your ship constantly.              
---
What changed?             
---
If you kept someone this way for 2h this way until he logged out, usually this person didn't come back.         
---
Now it will come back ;)
---
Then r.eve would have nothing to complain about 🤗
---
Really stupid thinking. Once they got killed, they'd instant realize Abyssal pvp is about who has the more expensive ship and they'd ask themselves should they invest 10bil in a ship themselves for a potential 40mil loot. For most people they either couldn't afford or deem the risk simply not worth it. And in the end you got the exactly the same situation we currently in, nobody give a shit about abyssal pvp. Nice try luring new players to become your free killmails.
---
Much missed, the world was a better place for his ongoing efforts.
---
You missed a 1
---
When you look at the numbers the purchasing power of isk hasn't changed in forever. The only thing that appreciated against isk is Plex. You can't fight in space with a PLEX you bought but you can fight with a ship that you bought with isk.
---
Yes because anyone is going to decide that constantly warping back and forth every three minutes in an Orca or a barge is an effective use of their time.
---
We're not exactly talking about cynabals here, they're not known for being quick about that.
---
Nobody's removing rorq mining all I'm saying it rorq mining while watching Netflix should be less profitable than paying a give attention to Intel and working with people. Cynogeddon and blackout is accomplishing that.
---
Don’t forget that all of serenity co banned ratting for a week!
---
when you bump them for 3minutes they will warp automatically...  but if you break this process  the counter resets  to break it just get ibis with scram and suicide it
---
Just look at the dotted white line. It is the average player count for that time segment. Compare the 1w, 1m, 3m, 1yr white lines.
---
5 smartbomb  apocalypses will add cream.... you can do more by  sending  yours sentry drones far from your smartbomb damage range then use drones to agrro and set off smartbombs..you will hurt him
---
Cyno/Blackout changes are not only accomplishing that, it is completely fucking over the game and making players quit. The problem with your idea is that skillpoints should also be taken into account. People train to fly those ships, the time invested in those skills is also worth something. Just because someone is looking at their screen permanently, doesn't mean they should make more money than those who invested far more training time into the game. This is not a black and white issue.
---
Yea, I can make the mallers, I'm pretty sure. That would work, we are still in high sec so it'd a quick kamikaze dive.
---
Ew no.
---
No it wasn't
---
&gt; That they can just warp off and back to the spot and you need to bump them again ... and again ... and again.
---
It's still a problem because normal people want to crab to Plex their account as well. We should have changes that make it more profitable per hour to be actively paying attention to the game and less profitable if you're watching Netflix that's all I'm saying.
---
that´s the spirit.
---
&gt; more people blow money on PLEX to PVP
---
If they want to do that they would turn up the isk faucet, which would make the cost of plex rise even further and make "plexing" higher isk/dollar paid and therefore more worth it and encourage people to plex.
---
Peak spod racing
---
Just wondering, are you part of a wormhole Corp or just daytripping into them to krab? If it’s the second, try to find C3s with no other j space connections, and if you’re with a Corp, ask somebody to put a scout on the other holes. Both will keep you relatively safe when ratting. 
---
Also, carry a mobile depot, if you’re getting ganked just throw your fit and the blue loot into it, and then come back with an inty to pick it up.
---
Were too busy with screeching in game to do it on Reddit
---
For a normal deployment, the cyno changes don't really change anything. For move ops, they weren't really using noob ships. Least none that I saw. But we've shifted the conversation from "Fights should be more fair" to "Well now it's slightly harder for giant blocks to roll over everyone" 
---
And this doesn't make it more fun, just more tedious. Now they just have to spend an extra hour or so planning how to split up the forces.
---
are you flairbaiting?
---
Several people have now. It’s sad
---
Yes it should mean that if you're actively playing the game you're rewarded more lol. Yes this should not be controversial in any way.
---
Did you make this same response for the guy who said “Hilary for President”?
---
Did you make this same response for the guy who said Hilary for President?
---
&gt;People used to fight over their space, defending it and attacking neighbours
---
Because owning more space was good, and there wasn't enough to go around
---
That is no longer true.
---
But there are many fully involved ways of playing the game that don't really reward very much at all, or its RNG. Your view is very black and white while eve is not.
---
They already did that combining it with periodic PLEX and Galaxy Pack sales. I'm talking comparatively that PA is used to making money from microtransactions and in general that's much more profitable than monthly subs.
---
This is all based on the premise of us trying to imagine what PA wants out of EVE.
---
So you start this post by basically saying anyone who doesn't support  these changes is brainless and wonder why you get downvoted?
---
It is fair to say we should wait in this specific post, but we have been watching data and it showing an downwards trend followed by an accelerated downward trend after this data. Unfortunately everyone who celebrates these changes implies that any data we have is insufficient and so I pose the question of at what point will the data we have be sufficient.
---
CCP listening on a minor change while going through with the devastating changes is not something that should be celebrated. It does not show they listen to the community, it shows they are trying to placate the community.
---
Additionally people make posts on what is wrong with these changes or the game but they are always blanket disregarded as "eve is dying" by people who support these changes.
---
What are those who think its dying and are trying to make people aware supposed to do? Stay quiet while CCP continues to drive this game off a cliff? 
---
If these numbers concerned you, you wouldn't be taking the stance you did.
---
As a newbie, what playstyles got nerfed into dust?
---
Why not talk to people. ie "who has the cyno lit in (xyz system)?" God forbid you have to cooperate in a multiplayer online game
---
&gt;it would make sense to add a Fuel Bay to these ships
---
Why? are you lighting a Cyno while having anything else but fuel on board?
---
Politics has nothing to do with having a desire to hold accountable those who are responsible for the deaths of Vile Rat and his co-workers.
---
You got downvoted by fellow wormholers. Sad face.
---
PA receptionist: Hello thank you for calling PA. How can I help you?
---
Salt lord: Yes hello I want to complain about ccp the game developer of Eve online changing the game. 
---
PA receptionist: Have a nice day :smile: *hangs up*
---
Salt lord: Reeeeeeeeeeee
---
Can you don't?
---
And this is why I stopped coming here for the most part. It's sad, I've had some good laughs and decent conversations, but the negative and circlejerking has made me look elsewhere for eve content.
---
In case you don't use Discord/Slack or other software based on that platform: the reaction buttons are a default feature for all (?) messages posted to any channel. The buttons appear based on which reactions have already been posted, and act as shortcuts so you don't have to search for the same reaction.
---
i agree but good luck...hitting ccp wall..
---
"normal people" don't plex their accounts because it's like 5-10 hours of time invested for what is essentially $12. I can go dumpster diving for soda cans, turn them in the recycling center for 5 cents each and still pay for my sub faster than super ratting. The statistics CCP has given in their financial report indicates around 25% of paying accounts are plexed, vs 75% paid with cash. Given the wealth distribution in EVE, it's likely that the spacerich 5% plex most or all of their multiple accounts, and "the long tail" of spacepoors pay for their 1-3 accounts with cash.
---
The majority of "normal people" do not buy plex or even sell plex to fund acitivies, high plex prices don't affect them or are an advantage since they more "fun" out of their money (Want a mach to roam with? It used to cost $40, now it costs $5). The proliferation of rorquals has actually kept CPI inflation down by increasing the supply of minerals to match the supply of isk.
---
Remove asset safety. Tethering should have a limited timer. Remove the panic module. Make Battleships Great Again. Extend cyno inhibitor effects to an entire grid.
---
Yea  maybe i should consider that  but its another damn thing i have to pay for   to buy multipilot certificate which i found sutch bullshit  i made it flew 5 minutes  tried to train it said you need a multipilot training thing and i was like  you know what  no  im done already i have 1 character thats enough for me
---
The jf pilots complained about being able to lock to covert cynos, now they complain again.
---
Yes.  I should have been more clear.  When I searched, the bot added 3 reaction icons to the response
---
boom, ledger, and speech_bubble
---
I'm sure it adds some flair but it doesn't convey any information or function
---
o7 #RIP
---
People say this but I'm curious how it affects them. Can you not afford ships then? Are people being priced out of expensive ships somehow? Because I don't hear that. I don't see people posting about they want a BS or something but can't afford it. 
---
It's not that I don't believe you about the isk/minerals in the market, I'm just curious how it is affecting others. I have found this way cheaper now and it's nothing but a boon for me.
---
mallers are cheap to use as smartbomb platform..  eventually post the solar system where they are doing this so  this will give bigger chance of suicide ganks.
---
WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE.
---
well look at this gun!! it must be civilian autocannon.
---
Yup. It’s almost as if the big null blocks are the only ones talking about this.
---
t\`was an inside Job.
---
Can we get the artist's explanation here and intent? I'm in the fence of if I should upvote or downvote.
---
Because typing 'o7' on Reddit constitutes 'respectfully paying condolences'. Bitch please, it couldn't be a more lazy and thoughtless way to pay condolences, in my opinion.
---
&gt;Why cheap labor force don't reduce the production cost?
---
Because historically since the arrival of cheap non-renewable energy slavery was more expensive than mechanisms.  
---
What drove slavery away is literally the steam engine.
---
People tend to forget that slaves cost money, even just from moving them out of Africa (assuming they are bought there at a cheap price) and from the high death ratio in the ships.
---
If a destroyer gang is getting killed by capitals they are doing something very wrong. There’s no reason ships that quick to both move and align should ever be caught by a capital unless they were planning to fight it (stukas). If you take your gang around and just harass people, use scouts to avoid gatecamps, then someone will bring something that can actually catch you in order to chase you away. 
---
But if you just tackle rorquals, then of course you’re going to get dropped on.
---
clearly the answer is Classic Eve
---
just wipe everything and start over
---
o/ RIP VR
---
Your main problem is that in-game people look at the TAPIrium and see something which can't be beaten by them. Even if player count wasn't shrinking there simply aren't the numbers left to do that.
---
So here, on Reddit, they are going to vent. Because they can.
---
I mean, i don't think the blackout is bad per se. But i also don't believe that it's the silver bullet that kills all the games problems and restores the balance between the playstyles that there needs to be.
---
I fit a manticore with 3 polarized torp launchers and 2 BCS II.
---
That's a bit over 5000 damage per hit, little under 6 sec OH cycle.
---
10 bombers to 50000 damage per hit, and will get off ...5-7 cycles of damage until concord arrives?
---
That's 250-350k damage. My Orca isn't fully brick tanked but still goes over 500k EHP, without costing the ~1.44 bil you pay for 10 manticores.
---
Please feel free to correct the math if I got something wrong.
---
Cynos are a high slot module. The idea is that you activate the module and then, if it's a regular cyno, a Titan can make a bridge to you. Then other ships can warp from the Titan to you, as well as the Titan itself. 
---
The point is that if you're in an expensive ship and getting ganked, if you are within range of friendly capital ships they can you if you activate the cyno module. This is what they call the capital umbrella. 
---
They can also be used to attack a ship one of your guys had pinned down
---
There were two kinds of Cynos : covert ops and regular. As of Tuesday the regular ones have been removed. That means that if you're ganked it will be harder to save your ass. Now you have to use covert ops Cynos, which you can read about. They also added industrial cynos, to help move industrial ships like jump freighters.
---
I agree. I think they're trying to bring that back, but there's a group of players that got accustomed to what CCP offered. Most dedicated players will put up with it. After all they are used to adapting, this other group... not so much.
---
What's going to end up happening is he's going to log off and log in his alpha catalyst pilot and kick you in the teeth and unless you have friends willing to gank his Orca, you are SOL.. have fun though!
---
Please keep in mind, though, an Orca can carry a ton of crap. I personally keep 30-40 drones in cargohold just so I never have to go back for refills.
---
If they drop a mobile depot and refill for each of your ganks, you're not really making a lot of progress.
---
I'm a bit more curious as to how they're bothering you and why you need to get rid of them.
---
And people complain about people leaving the game when they hear such friendly people way such nice things
---
Ah, the bot itself is adding the reactions. I understand now and yeah, that's a bit weird.
---
I mean, maybe; however, I trade to make isk in both null and hi-sec, and over the last month especially, I am starting to see the 'results' of the blackout now in the form of a much lower volume of purchases and orders filled. I have even seen the number of times I need to adjust my orders going down. 
---
To me, this means that whatever the fucking cause--the actual mechanics changes, or the perception that CCP is unresponsive, has no vision for eve, and disconnected from the majority of the player base--the drop in players is *perceptible* to me; and if I am feeling it, others must be too.
---
The point is, most of the rorquals that die in Delve did so because they were dumb. But then being dumb didn’t really hurt goons, so they didn’t change anything, and people kept going to Delve and getting fairly easy rorqual kills if they planned well. 
---
Now, those dumb people are either going to leave, or get smarter. Which means that despite the mechanics changing, its not actually going to be much easier to kill rorquals, at least after the first few weeks while everyone is getting used to the changes.
---
No worries, Noizy will be along shortly to make up excuses for why this chart means nothing.
---
JFC. Is there a bot pinging on imperium channels everyday to remind you about your daily salt posts. Can we give it a rest already?
---
There's a monthly report released by CCP. We like to gloat about the figures.
---
&gt;I just told you.
---
So you actually don't base it off anything got it.
---
&gt;The "famous" goon. I'm not going to name names.
---
No sources but demand I take it as something that happened
---
&gt;The cyno change impacts all areas.
---
The cyno changes affect primarily nullsec and lowsec to some level. Cyno changes do not affect wormhole space or highsec.
---
&gt;Nullsec has the loudest voice. It's not the "true" bears in HS who care about this.
---
You are projecting something here. Wormhole PVPers are the ones who care the most about killboard stats.
---
&gt;No. This is coming from null. It's essentially a "cultural fuck you" that aligns with the largest groups that abuse the game mechanics the most. Every player must be tracked and potentially be held accountable.
---
Again, elite pvpers care about their stats. If nullsec cared about killboard stats they wouldn't write off entire fleets.
---
&gt;Do you think there is such a thing as "abusing game mechanics"? If yes, you know there is a line somewhere. If no, you don't understand the problem.
---
I don't think having a large group of people working together to defend each other is abusing mechanics, but it seems to be a problem for small groups.
---
&gt;Might as well say botters are salty since they can't bot, which is arguably more true.
---
And there we have it, anyone who doesn't support this is a bot to you. You refuse to believe any player doesn't support these changes because they buff your play style.
---
&gt;No, I would probably explain why they are unresonable and how they adversely affect the game.
---
I am not saying they would be reasonable things, because I don't know any reasonable person who thought jump freighters needed to be nerfed but it literally just happened.
---
&gt;Unlikely. I want CCP to fix the balance. Who ultimately gets fucked as a result is mostly irrelevant, but nullsec deserves a lot of shit. The idea that the largest ships should also be the fastest is dumb. The cyno restrictions are good for the game.
---
You contradict yourself in this own sentence. You don't care who gets screwed but it better be nullsec. The cyno restrictions are bad for the game but because they make your life easier to gank people, they must be good for the game.
---
&gt;They think the pre-blackout status quo was good? This supports the understanding that these people only care about what's good for them at the expense of everyone else and the game.
---
They aren't saying the previous status quo was fine, they are saying the path CCP is taking is worse for the game than doing nothing, but because it is a goon who is saying despite being one of the longest tenured CSM members, people like you think his opinion is biased. Maybe we should take it at face value and be concerned that he is sounding the alarm, something he has not done before.
---
&gt;Ban waves historically only takes off 1-2% of online population anyway.
---
On this one point: Unless CCP uses a hardware ID ban, it would take less than a day to replace a banned account thanks to skill injectors. As long as botting is profitable, those banned accounts will be replaced. If, as the assertion goes, botting is indeed Lee's profitable now, then more of those accounts will stop logging in.
---
It was a peaceful, also this is one of my corp's mining sites so there are plenty of people nearby.
---
I still blame CCP.
---
BOTS
---
Not at all, I am insinuating that just throwing game mechanics changes into a game without significant testing, which includes testing how changes in mechanics in one area affect the mechanics in another game--something every video game company I ever worked for did--is a significant indicator that upper management:
---
1. Probably does not have people with key foundational knowledge covering all aspects of their IP; and
---
2. Just does not give a fuck anymore. 
---
That's what I CCP's recent behavior telegraphs to me.
---
Can we just get an eve-offline megathread at this point?
---
VR was a Country club kind of guy tho.  Now the who shoot blues makes sense... 
---
Either way He is missed.
---
I could have sworn we were already in the process of that when the ~cHaOS~ began.
---
&gt;  they will be **very intrigued** to find how CCP managed to kill half of their revenue and CCP will need a goddamn good excuse to keep themselves (and EVE) alive. 
---
You're assuming all of those accounts are paid subscriptions though...
---
People who want Eve to turn into Wow, they should leave. So that's cool.
---
Mate people dying while pve is always down to them being dumb. Lazy idiots leaving EVE was always a thing.  That's how it always was. 
---
 Still a bloc having harder time dropping a super and 2 carriers a dessie roam is a good thing.
---
I'd rather fight a flashform subcap fleet than a capital which both has immense tank, superb application and stupid dps.
---
I was personally always mortified at people ratting in carriers never mind titans.
---
Leave capitals for fleet fights and sov bashes.
---
#subcapsneedlovetoo
---
Its the level of content Null Entities warned CCP it would drop to.
---
But Grr Goons/PL/NC/Legacy/INIT/Frat/GOTG et all. What would they know about Null and its inhabitants.  Roaming Kiki/Bomber gang FC's who base out of High Sec or Thera they are who you should listen to when it comes to Null not the people who deal with those paying players on a daily basis.
---
Wasn't referring to you specifically. It's my position that the actual player base hasn't dropped much. The majority of the loss is from bot farms or alts of current players not multiboxing them.  I actually know players that have come back because of the blackout. 
---
CCP knows this. I think the game is in a better place now, we just need to work on features that bring in more players willing to take the new risks. It's also quite feasable that people are just playing less, still paying, waiting to see how this all develops, or just not logging in. That's doesn't mean they gave up on Eve.
---
It is, and this is a *huge* problem. They literally ignore the more balanced feedback from the wider player base that, despite what people say, still use EVE's official forums, and come here instead. 
---
This is literally an *insane* way to manage an MMO community.
---
Normally valuations are 3-5x revenue depending on projected growth.
---
You would basically never see a company sell for less than revenue.
---
I mean, they could just make capital rats, escalation style missions with souped-up NPC ships that MWD or something (thus allowing you to hit them), or other options.
---
I believe there are intelligent and proper solutions to handle all the knock-on effects. It's harder to plan ahead for all of them, and frankly I'm not sure how much longer the game can stay in a "ok-this-change-is-urgent-and-we'll-think-about-consequences-later" stage.
---
Would anyone mind explaining the slowcat doctrine to me? I apparently did not absorb that info when they were a thing and I see them referenced a lot so I'm curious

---
Every rifter counts friend o7
---
I enjoyed the blogpost.
---
I agree, I actually like the *concept* of skill injectors to allow newer players to 'catch up' in some sense, because as we know, unlike other MMOs people cannot just improve their characters through playing. 
---
Had I been in charge, I would have either put very firm caps on the total skill points a character can have to use injectors at all--say cutting people off entirely from skill injectors at 20m skill points--or I would limit the skills that skill injected skill points can be used on, similar to alpha clones. 
---
For instance, people should have never been allowed to use injectors to inject capital ship command and module skills.
---
I’m not sure why you’re being down voted. I guess orange man bad for this sub too. But you are correct. They way Hillary handled Benghazi was unforgivable.
---
Probably not. :D
---
I’m with you, game is much better with the changes.  I think we’re just hearing an excess of screeches as goons and other over sized coalitions and spodbrains realize they have to go to highsec to crab in relative safety.
---
I know plenty of people who can't afford the sub and having a more reasonable time to Plex no matter what that means in absolute ISK value is going to help retention as well. In the end all I'm saying is whatever the meta changes they should reward people actively paying attention to the game more and people watching Netflix less. That shouldn't be controversial in any way. This could be done by many things like blackout or cyno changes forcing you to spend more time organizing cynos and communicating about intel.
---
Supers and Titan are dropped in lowsec quite frequently. Perhaps if you left Delve you would know.
---
lmbo
---
Since you decided to go down this path. Hillary requested additional funding for security at these facilities but was denied by the Republican congress. If you actually want to blame some one in the US government for this that is where you start.
---
This is pretty good!
---
Resource density needs to be diluted. People should spread more in nullsec. Some people proposed already that killing rats or mining ore in a system should have the effect of having less of them in the system, not more. 
---
Another shot in the knee of caps would also be nice.
---
because it's annoying to try to save people who refuse to do as they're asked by the people helping them? Like I said you seem way more upset than anyone else about this. Maybe when you sober up you'll chill idk gl
---
That's awesome dude. Find what you find fun in EVE and make the best of it!
---
This is good long term, let it happen.
---
I like that wheel, it's a good one.
---
It's not like there is anything else to talk about at the moment. They wanted chaos, this is it.
---
We can read the charts on the website. That's why they're there and not here.
---
Remember, this man was a real-life friend of The Mittani. That should give you an idea on what a piece of shit he was.
---
Probably to highlight the 9/11 attack in contrast to the 'vile rat' benghazi stuff. Given the numbers of people who lost their lives in 9/11 there were likely lots of people who played EVE, or would've. Essentially lots of us who've played eve for years have lost friends, however we do not feel the need to make posts on the anniversary of their deaths year after year. I'm one with the sentiment even if it's crudely shown; let the dead rest and remember people your own way instead of trying to create hero personas out of them and enforce that culture onto other people.
---
So your incredible rampage against the whole of new eden should be well under way. That's great to hear.
---
So, I will ask you now to google narcissism, because this is exactly what I am talking about. Assuming that because *you* see improvement to *your* game play, everything is great. 
---
The horizon of EVE game play does not begin or end with you, and sometimes when a game company makes it so *you* are having more fun, it is at the expense of *other people*. Those other people, often as not, actually outnumber you, and if the *cost to them* for your 'having a better time' in game is high enough, they leave. 
---
Why? Because EVE is not real life. It is not work people have to go to every day. It is a game people pay to play because they enjoy it. When they stop enjoying it, they stop paying and leave.
---
Because the problem is that with low effort comes infinite scalability. This wasnt an issue when you could mine the belts out but with infinitely respawning Spod anoms it creates too much of a mineral faucet.
---
CCPs lazy answer to this is to make mining more autistic and less casual-friendly, because they refuse to address the root cause which is resource abundance.
---
Way over your head bro. Of course the initial logistics of null is a challenge, but once you're there it's hard to get caught with a shiny local giving all the intel you need. It's very easy to find a secluded system in null and mine away until you see a red dot then simply dock up. Or farm belts and anoms for rats up until that red dot shows up and you safe up. Hunters had zero chance unless you were AFK. And guess what? Profits were so huge people would go AFK, beacuse losing their ship was nothing compared to the massive amount of free time you had to solo anything. 
---
The ironic thing now is, we have less people in null and they're too afraid to mine and rat because of no local. That's the problem mate. People want the 100% certainty they can do what they want in the most profitable way without any risk.
---
I would say we need a r/eveoffline subreddit at this point.
---
I don't care what your position is, it doesn't matter. There are numbers and \*\*facts\*\* out that show the playerbase is dropping. That activity in nullsec is dropping, that ships being killed has reduced, that isk being made has gone down, that ore mined has dropped. Whatever your position or feeling about this doesn't matter one tiny bit, because its wrong. 
---
People are playing less, they simply aren't playing at all, the facts show it. Adding in hearsay about a friend doesn't change this either. Trying to suggest these drops are bots is also a no-go because bot bans do not happen like the drops we are seeing. We have multiple events of CCP banning bots, and those drops are nothing like the drops we are seeing.
---
The scariest part is that people are leaving and we have a bunch of toxic ass-hats on this sub saying "dont come back" and those ass-hats don't realise that those people leaving mean less content for those of us who are still playing. Its absurd.
---
So squirm as much as you want, try and justify the drop in player base, suggest that you and CCP somehow have a secret bit of information that refutes the facts that are quite evident to those with eyes. It won't change anything, you will just look stupid in the weeks to come.

The game was dying anyway, at least eve dies in a fire instead of a slow depressing death like serenity

&gt; bots and afk isk farmers...tell me the logic behind krabbing 24/7?where that isk go ?rmt sites?give you a single example:period basis: not a single player left in that area,except a guy with 3 alts deep in 1-e pocket.Rest of them was just domi and vni botting 24/7 and a guy with 3 groups of  machariel paladin  combo smartbombing havens.Was they good for game?hell no.content 0.better be 15 k online real players than 25 k mostly bots and alts
---
&gt; reward people actively paying attention to the game more and people watching Netflix less
---
Of course, but the problem is that that kind of activity is not available in all space. Gutting "afk" activities in sov null without adding in any active replacements (and there probably won't be for years, this is CCP we are talking about), will result in people having nothing to do for money and they quit in droves. When Goons, Test, and Horde all ban super ratting, which was the only activity remotely competitive in isk/hour/account with Abyssal/burners/wormhole, you know something is up with the risk/reward. By the time CCP adds a replacement activity to null, if they even plan to do so, the game could have lost all those players for good.
---
Shoot blues, Tell Vile Rat. The game isn’t the same without you friend
---
that is still 17k, while a year ago it was 23k if we take your method over approx 1/2 weeks.
---
That would be a 22% decrease... Again... sounds not that bad honestly...
---
Please, just stop comparing different things. You have to look at last year with the same method as this year.
---
And again, it might be actually bad. We simply don't know, but CCP knows.
---
Anyone who thinks r/eve is representative of anything but itself are fooling themselves. There are legit concerns here but it stops about there. It's always been a circlejerking fuckboy paradise.
---
Pretty much everything in life is chasing some kind of high: social approval, a promotion, finishing up the project car.
---
Eve just offers all of the above in an environment that's full of nerds.
---
The first thing I suggested was using the game lore to make large campaigns that require groups across regions. Not like the soe epic ark they boring as hell an actually campaign with a boss battle at the end, you may not like them but they are popular. Not something that can be farmed something that take a group hours to do.
---
Second thing I suggested was finish the triglavion invasion story an have the 4 empires go to war in high sec as well. It'll spice the game up and replace fw. A whole new take on it. Easing new people into pvp. Opt in and out claus for them who like battle royal style games, they can log in enrol get a gal ship fly to where the combat is and fight have a form srp like I suggested if the ship dies give them another. If they leave the new fw they pay for there ship free form pvp. People will learn and lose there jitters, fear of dying and learn fleet tactics. If you not enrolled you can't fight in it.
---
Vile Rat, I had a weird convo with you in-game once 8 or 9 years ago--way before I was a goon. Believe me, I actually still think about that convo from time to time and how it is unbelievable that you are no longer here to have weird convos with other people in eve.  
---
Fly safe, fellow capsuleer. o7

I don't have it set up for that, I'm afraid.

---
I guess you \_could\_ load all the orders from one of the ordersets, and then churn through that, but it's a fair amount of work.
---
The problem is the tug-of-war between both sides has lead to CCP basically going from one extreme to the next. There needs to be a balance between both but unfortunately CCP doesn't seem to get it and cater to either one vocal minority or the other. Let me just say, ratting and mining is not safe, its quite simple to search Zkill to prove your idea that local somehow saved people, it didn't. Many people got caught, many people got dunked, its just stupid to continue down the line of ratting/mining being a safe activity, it never has and never will be. However, many hunters also wanted easy kills and only engaged something they knew, for a fact, they could dunk. There are risk averse people on both sides of this argument, but unfortunately, the hunters are the ones telling people to quit the game, or telling the ones who have already quit, not to come back. It's toxic as fuck to do that. 
---
CCP has the power to fix this, they could implement innumerable changes that would unfuck the risk/reward of nullsec right now. But they don't seem to care. I hope they prove me wrong.
---
Finally, an Olmeca_Tin post I can agree with.
---
To add on, Eve was heading towards towards the fate of the that Chinese server that died due to the single mega coalition winning Eve.
---
Supposedly a plex was 10’s of billions of isk. And if CCP doesnt shakeup the meta, and shut off the isk faucets, then EVE dies a slow economic death.

The brigades are fucking crazy on this sub. A thread will a lot of discussion barely has 50 upvotes. This pointless thread has over 200. GJ folks, fucking up your own game and right here is an example why.
---
Imagine being this dedicated in your RL job, you could easily subscribe a fleet of gankers and use PLEX to pay for their ships...

Those tank empire LP, burners tank pirate LP.

My sacred cow riskless PvE must be protected at all costs.
---
you really are a fucking idiot
---
its correct.  these days  miners orcas hardly reach  300k so you will execute them very easily.  i  did ship scan random orca miners and shocked me that they sacrifice security over mining yield and this give advantage to gankers,some miners had only drone mining augmenters and  drone navigation computers and low slot only DCII and reinforced bulkheads.  this shocked me.. 
---
how i did the ship scan thing? i was using prospect because  of mid slots. i fitted passive targetter and ship scanner and ofc mining lasers to lure the other miners in belt or athanor belt.. they did think its just random miner but was not.  if you use any non-mining ship to repeat this  theres chance they hide expensive drones or warp out..

Not sure why you are downvoted, CN LP is the most worthless LP store due to the masses of Caldari mission runners around Jita. Literally any other LP is worth more.
---
Still not equivalent.
---
Stop this whining already, please. You do not help. EVE is much better and deeper than any other mmo.
---
I mean, this is all tangential to this thread (I was not arguing "afk activity is good for EVE", I was arguing that if you're going to do something boring like mining in the game as it exists currently, it makes sense to take the possibly less-profitable afk activity and scale up vs worrying about excavators that you may or may not be able to save) but...
---
&gt;This wasnt an issue when you could mine the belts out but with infinitely respawning Spod anoms it creates too much of a mineral faucet.
---
They aren't infinite, though.  They have a respawn timer that CCP has adjusted that puts an upper limit on them.  idk why they haven't further tweaked it if they have an issue with the mineral output in Delve.  It's an even lazier way of "fixing" the problem and I don't really get why they haven't turned that knob harder vOv
---
Nobody banned super ratting they're consolidating it to a single constellation while they learn to do saves in the new meta. 
---
I think your outlook is incredibly skewed if you consider the baselines for income to be super ratting and rorq mining. As long as everyone is equally affected there's no issue with downgrading doctrines and consolidating space. CCP thinks nullsec got too big too safe and too stale as a result I personally agree. I see only a positive if a crunch in null economy forces us to go back to smaller cheaper doctrines defending less space.
---
I think it’s the other way around. Those of us that don’t have access to the umbrella in null sec are left to harvest in high sec where CODE demands their worthless permits or they’ll yank your barge. I’m a small Indy guy and I don’t have access to reactions to get my own moon goo mats. So I have to rely on what comes from the market. Yes I could sell my soul to one of the blocs and have all my dreams of indy come true by becoming another drone in the hive.... but I already have a RL office job where I do what I’m told. I think PvPers are definitely set up well with fairly safe and easy access to all types of ships and modules. For shit pilots like me that can sometimes struggle to keep a beam pointed at a huge rock, making a profit on the ships I’m selling can be tough.
---
This, so much this.
---
So many players either telling people to quit, or telling those who have quit not to come back because they are "krabs" is utterly astounding and toxic as fuck.
---
I guess he tried to reproduce the picture of the two towers of the WTC, when the first was already hit
---
most likely. but wtc7 didnt  detonate,studied this matter. one of floors was on fire and whole floor was bending downward.similar scenario happened to one of  korean hotels? due to construction failure one of support pillars cracked and some time later walls were cracking and one of bathroom mirrors cracked apart,it was design flaw but bulding collapsed in wtc7 manner. perhaps  fire weakened structure in critical points so support columns/pillars failed and whole floor run down and so whole bulding.
---
What's this new rule that goonswarm has issued? Im out of the loop since I no longer have a character in there?
---
Ha. Ok, yeah, fair play :) Good answer.

didn't someone make this same post like a day ago?

I miss the marketsforisk blog :-(
---
What's the deal with moon ore?  It is very bulky and cant be compresses, and had wildly variable buy/sell margins at hubs.   I would assume that most people refine their own moon ore, but sometimes the closest refinery is several jumps away.  Am I supposed to be moving the stuff back and forth multiple jumps in my procurer?  Doesn't seem efficient, one full procurer load isn't that many millions of isk after all.  Now i've got various quantities of moon ore scattered about, but not one load seems to be worth the risk of bringing my DST out to move it all around.
---
One of the wonderful things about EVE I have discovered in my very short foray into this game is that you don't just need to learn a fairy complex game and an even more complex meta. You also need to learn a new language :-)
---
Almost everyone seems to be missing the point here.
---
It's not about risk or danger or ships being blown up. It's about the contempt and toxicity that much of the player base(and /r/eve is a hotbed of this) has for anyone who plays the game differently. Half of this thread is just proving the point.
---
There's an element of luck to it though. And just to be clear I have no issue with risk (and no longer use caps myself so don't have a horse in this race) but you are risking &gt;200mill each time you jump. I am starting to see upsides to that. You've really got to want to do what you're doing and commit to it as a solo player which isn't actually a bad thing.
---
Isn't that what I said make resources deplete periodically like PI?
---
I suspect there are quite a few people in that situation.
---
o7 Vile Rat I hardly knew ye, but the few memories I have of you will last a life time.
---
Just put the graph in the banner.
---
r/eve has literally become (or always has been?) a circlejerk of old bittervets always discussing the same thing: The game is dying.
---
Many people look at a games subreddit before getting into it and ask questions, here they will just encounter the cancer that kills the game and do a 180 to somewhere else..
---
Yeah, cos taking a carrier by gates solo isn't going to definitely end up with no carrier :)
---
Nomadic mercenary type, the type where you don't need to actually PVE yourself (passive income from moon empires), cap sitters, small alliances ability to project above their weight (terms of ships/skills/SP)
---
What is FC?
---
So I should write off the value of the ship in t2 cruisers every time I \*might\* use it?  Even in the blueball meta?    
---
I'd be fine with writing off the ship when I use it.  That's what it's for.  I was cool with increasing fuel costs.  I was cool with nerfs to tracking. I was cool with diminishing fax reps.  I would be cool with nerfs to EHP, increases to build costs, fighters being meaningfully expensive, boson removal / rebalance, etc etc.  
---
"LOL players we made this a pain in the ass but it's still brokenly OP" Is not the answer and never will be.
---
Do as you're told, or get shot.
---
In this instance people are being told to stop being shit. Fit ships appropriately, and don't take them to stupid places.
---
Equally, it's a new rule so it's a gentle nudge to not be shit  before having the trigger pulled during this transitional period.
---
I think its so cool that Hilmar is getting dream messages from Eve itself. Imagining the game itself as some sort of multidimensional entity that is collaborating with it's human developers blows my mind!
---
&gt;logproof
---
Sounds like you're 90 proof.
---
Fair point.
---
Your post makes no sense. The reason eve is deeper and better than other MMOs is because of the people who play it. Whining has made some great changes to eve online previously. Suggesting people stop is redundant thinking.
---
44% upvoted. Lol, /r/eve just doesn't want to see these numbers, its crazy, and CCP listen to the shit people say on here too.
---
Ikr, I didn't even notice until you pointed it out.
---
Ok. Developers don't matter. I got it.

After the usual EVE\_round we ll likely have a negative number of players for some time :D

Wow... you’re a dick. Why do you have to defile this man who has passed on and can’t defend him self? Do you know why he died? It was due to no fault of his own. The only mistake he made that led to his death was his choice to be a diplomat in game and irl.I’m sure you wouldn’t want someone who never knew you personal shit-posting about how bad of a person you are once you pass.
---
Lemme get some dummy thicc Dominix thanks
---
&gt; As long as everyone is equally affected there's no issue with downgrading doctrines and consolidating space.
---
Except everyone is not equally affected are they. Wormholes still print isk like mad, which means that the decrease in isk flow from reduced ratting is not going to have proportional impact on prices that would compensate null members for their greatly decreased income. That's also not accounting for the people who have already built up massive isk reserves and are going to see the purchasing power of their existing isk rise, which also allowed them to price people who rely on the PvE revenue stream out of business much more easily.
---
There's a reason that most developers prefer inflation to create a "new norm" over deflation, since deflation favors entrenched interests that have massive stockpile of money that appreciate if deflation happens. CCP is making the same mistake that the US Federal reserve made in 1929, where fear of inflation caused them to clamp down on the money supply during a recession and crashed the economy.
---
Did you by chance uncheck them? Look at the buttons around your cap status thingy (no idea how it's called).
---
The exact same argument can be used by the opposing side.
---
Just put "bloc coalitions with a lot of capital ships and blobs" in the place of "medium to small gang pvp groups" and vice versa, and it makes the exact same sense.
---
And before you say "but they are not that many", neither is nullsec a majority. The majority of players (CCP's own stats released a few years ago) lives in empire space, nullsec used to be 20% or so of the population. They may be more now after the massive recruiting drives of newbros and the (until recently) mostly safe meta that took hold, but you'd also have to account for turnover (lots of newbros join blocs and then leave, i see them in empire space all the time) and we don't have any recent data to argue either way if null population is a majority of the players or not.
---
Plus, the smaller groups were the player demographic that usually had the most accounts per player on average (before the whole rorqual mutliboxing meta at least), because they needed isk making characters to fund their other activities (and especially their pvp habit if we're talking about such groups). There's usually no SRP in a 30-player group, people are expected to be self sufficient.
---
Sure, your argument has valid points, but whatever argument you are making in favor of one playstyle, can be exactly mirrored in favor of other playstyles that the one you advocate has pretty much extinguished from the game.
---
These are lost players too and they number in the thousands. It just happened over the years and not in one fell swoop, because they actually tried to stick around and fight it out instead of quitting en masse the moment a bit of adversity was thrown their way.
---
Real money transfer is bad for EVE.
---
Wow... A goon complaining about toxicity in EVE and r/EVE?! :LOL:

Developers dont matter if people don't play.

qq more scrub

I suppose that's the part of the problem
---
Well, you are entitled to your own opinion, nothing wrong with that. I blame both CCP and the players.
---
I am torn between agreeing with you and wanting to deliver torpedoes to your friend over and over.
---
Maybe I'm wrong but wormholes get ISK from mod drops not bounties. As far as the economics side of it I'm not an expert and I see what you mean with entrenched interests.

You have the same information to make your interpretation as I do. Bottom line you see it one way, many see it another way. I've been here 16 years... I'm not worried. You can get yourself and your panties in a bunch, but it'll balance out. I'm playing and having fun. Don't see why you can't.

Are you looking to hold sov or squat in NPC space?

See you, space cowboy.

who said their next Q numbers were bad??? this is a shitpost

Lookup recent activity in system and display it. Show if there has been any ship kills recently. Show probable occupants if any. Number of citadels and types.
---
Hold Sov. We actively want to avoid renting
---
Old players are getting old and real life overcomes. Old eve could not attract young blood, they are different, very different. Eve had huge problems already, now devs are trying to do something. But people has started to whine without being constructive. As mentioned in other post, such messages are turning newcomers out and have no practical sense. We all know how to check history, CCP knows it even better. Take subcap and have fun :)
---
Lol nerd
---
"We're all in this together, now swallow my interpretation of events wholesale"
---
Just spitballing here, but maybe it is possible to both love something and be able to admit it could use a nerf.
---
the mechanics dictate jack shit and plenty of people obviously didn´t follow that line of thinking and/or playstyle.
---
Yeah, it is still maintaining and not well documented(but mentioned). These three reactions working like buttons, you have 30 seconds to tap one, boom - to look at this particular system effect stats, bubble to post a comment and a ledger to read existing comments. When you in private conversation with bot there's your private comments, in any other chat of the server comments are shared between all server members.
---
If you're using the same cynos all the time then just make a new chat channel and have their names linked in the MOTD of the channel. You can even put the system name next to them. That way you just right click via the same MOTD all the time, so long as they are in fleet (and you can invite from the same MOTD to fleet) you're sorted.
---
dont offend other  redditors.
---
So you need goons to create content for you?
---
Breaking into nullsec as a small independent sov-holding alliance is super hard these days, I wish you luck. 
---
I'd suggest steering clear of the areas controlled by big nullblocs at first (unless your alliance plans to join one of the coalitions), they're always hungry for content and are likely to farm you mercilessly while you're trying to get your feet under you. It's not personal, they just want people to pew pew.

---
I'm not trying to convince you to join a bloc or whatever, but I'm curious:  what do you think you wouldn't be allowed to do/would be forced to do if you did?  This attitude is just so weird to me when my alliance demands nothing of me beyond "don't fuck over your alliance mates".

---
Your logic goes counter to their narrative. Expect to be downvoted heavily
---
Clearly they are benefiting of the blackout changes
---
If you mean recently, nullsec player groups were very well organized, the game was pretty much figured out and they could print insane amounts of isk with somewhat low-engagement activities in relative safety. This also made some of these high profit activities easy to exploit by bots. Accumulation of wealth without enough destruction was screwing up the game economy long term and gradually lowered the value of isk. For example, 15 years ago you would make 200-400 million isk in a month if you killed NPCs everyday. In the current day, right until before the changes, you could make that in a single play session of a few hours if you had the right ship.
---
CCP made some changes recently to inject a bit more danger and inconvenience into nullsec, so that more ships would die and less isk printing would be possible. You can still make similar amounts of isk theoretically, but it's much more risky and you'll lose a few ships in the process, so the ratio of isk and minerals injected into the economy vs ship value lost is lower. This also forced a lot of bots to move back to safer space, doing lower profit activities.
---
If you mean what playstyles got nerfed over the years, most of the kind of pvp done by small to medium groups became unsustainable and ineffective. This ranges from lowsec piracy (old school piracy, where you would attack someone and demand a ransom to let their ship go), to guerilla warfare groups roaming nullsec and keeping the larger empires in check (the more space they had, the harder it was to effectively lock it down), on their toes, leaner and fitter.

&gt; You think Hilmar just woke up in a lazy summer morning this year and decided that there should be a Blockout and Chaos Era? 
---
Actually I KNOW he did.
---
&gt; "Think about it like EVE is an organism. EVE does not like where it's going. It's no longer limber. It's lost its stamina and mobility. It feels a little stiff**. EVE comes to me in a dream and says, Hilmar, release the hounds of war," Pétursson tells me, referencing his decision to implement The Chaos Era. "That's how it happened.** It came to me in a dream and it said, 'This cannot go on. I do not like this, this is not what I was meant to be.' The game has a purpose. It wants to finish its mission, and its mission is much larger than what it has executed in the last 16 years."

4th paragraph from the bottom from the PC Gamer coverage of Eve Fanfest 2019 in Finland.

 [https://www.pcgamer.com/eve-online-will-one-day-be-sentient-its-developers-told-me-during-a-nude-hot-tub-session/](https://www.pcgamer.com/eve-online-will-one-day-be-sentient-its-developers-told-me-during-a-nude-hot-tub-session/)
---
Thanks didn't know that part.
---
I mean not being able to light an invincible, 6 min Cyno has -already- had an effect, and will continue to have an effect. Only the people in fleet, ready to jump when the cyno is lit, are able to come "respond" now. I don't care how many recon alts you keep on grid, and how many people are all-set, waiting in your standing fleet, it is -still- an effect on super-capital responses, at least as it pertains to responding to Rorquals under threat.
---
But you said all the changes CCP was making would save the game.
---
Blackout would bring back 1000's of old players again, the huge increase in dead PvE'rs would bring in new players who would want to hunt and kill more of the big juicy targets. And the combined Returning players and New Players would offset any "Whining Salty" player who would unsub a paying account due to CCP deciding an entire Playstyle needed to be nerfed out of the game.
---
Why would Null need to start a war to bring in new players unless these changes have already failed to such a massive extent that we need to have another B-R level fight (Including the media coverage that went with it.) to stabilise the game?
---
Better question. Why would null, who warned CCP that this would happen, who have born the brunt of each of the Nerfs that were brought in purely to appease a tiny subset of the playerbase (Nano Kiki Bomber Krab Hunters) dig Hilmar out of this mess?
---
Wait till the end of the week when the average logged on number drops below 10k for the first time since 2007. Hilmar will be "future endeavoured" by Pearl Abyss after failing to hit his precious performance payout metric. PA will be forced to put someone in charge who will listen to EVERYONE and not just the Thera Based Bomber Kiki FC's who pushed for the majority of these changes.
---
If you have the same information I do, then you know for a fact that eve is haemorrhaging players. It's not a viewpoint anymore, its a fact. If you have, in fact, been here 16 years, you know just how terrible CCP is at managing changes they implement, rolling back on them when they damage the game, iterating and developing them. The reason I have my "panties in a bunch" as you suggest, is because the invested time I have put into this game is insane. The effort and man-hours have been incredible. For CCP to take the game down a path that is demonstrably damaging it is shocking, and not only that, it is worrying that they have been silent on the issue for a while.
---
The worrying aspect is that CCP has not really impacted bots much, they have simply migrated to high-sec. Bots are able to recycle a character quite easily now with injectors. While the downward trend has been quite tumultuous, not the same kind of trend as when bots get banned. Meaning, the concurrent playerbase includes a huge number of bots, while players are still leaving. 
---
Then we get into toxicity, this sub is an example of that. You have people saying they will quit - they get told to do so. You have people saying they have quit, they get told not to come back. It's disgusting to see it happen and its all from people who think Blackout is the best thing since sliced bread and it shouldn't be changed, all because it gives them a hard-on at the thought of them being more dangerous than they actually are.
---
You may not be worried, but you should be.
---
Can never upvote this enough.
---
So then your saying super ratting should give the most isk? You cant go afk for more than 6 seconds while super ratting because fighters dont auto agro...you do know fighters do auto agro right? Super ratting has almost the same APM as fucking starcraft
---
I feel that your message is going somewhat unheard here. The exact people that you asked to look past their factionisms to look toward the best state for the game are circle jerking behind their faction lines and demanding all other parties to die in a fire. At this point, the Eve community doesn't deserve Eve. I hope they pull the plug.
---
no u
---
go in and just attack and learn from miskates
---
i honestly think you've never dropped a cap on subcaps before solo. If you had, you would know it's really scary to be on grid with even 5 subcaps in a carrier. Just because caps have more capability doesn't make them some 'i win' button. Neut pressure, scrams, webs, ecm can all make your life a living hell, and if they're smart enough to attack your fighters, you're probably already close to dying.
---
New gamers are playing games with instant-join fun. Games that understand people have lives and don't want to be messed about. Games that don't inconvenience you for the sake of it. CCP could have got the memo, instead they introduce a few ridiculous changes that have essentially turned eve on its head.
---
For me it is definitely building something from nothing. I KNOW I’m not playing efficiently or even effectively but I am enjoying the shit out of the way I’m playing right now. I had one experience with a bigger alliance and honestly the thing that gets me is “if you are logged into the game you are expected to be on comms, not exceptions”. That expectation is exponentially worse than telling me I am only allowed to mine in one system or I’m only allowed to run this one bp. If there’s an op that I intended to be apart of, you bet I’ll be on comms and participating. But if I just want to goof around and run some level 3 mission while chatting with my friends that don’t play Eve, I shouldn’t be afraid of getting yanked, podded, and left with nothing because of not wanting sit in a chat server with people I don’t know doing something I’m not doing.

o7 legend I remember hearing that name years before I got into eve
---
&gt;Hold Sov. We actively want to avoid renting.  
---
&gt;We are looking for PVP content in a space that can generate income? if that makes sense. We have scouted out the moons as well as JF routes, all that went into choosing the location, and we would be relatively close to Hisec where we could fall back to if needed.
---
That makes more sense; I usually assume by default the ship I'm targeting is better fit (or at a minimum, correctly fit) and better flown than mine.
---
But at the same time I enjoy mining in the relative safety of a bricked Orca, I feel this ship has improved my EVE experience the most (and not only for mining, the ship is just wonderful for all kinds of activities). I know it's kinda off-topic but I want to share the love for our mobile scanning, mining, ganking and hauling platform.
---
This is totally not the case.  multiples of revenue and multiples of cashflow will vary over different types of business.  An within any industry's given range, those multiples will be highly sensitive to the growth rate of whichever metric is being used.   Also, the larger the business is relative to its industry the higher on that range they will often sit (or exceed it in one direction or the other).
---
Then you also have to consider if there are any underlying assets that are different than what is the average in that industry.  And to top it off, the industry itself will be sensitive to business cycles and to whether that industry is currently in or out of favor with investors.
---
In a lot of stable industries 1-2x revenue is the norm.  Or 4-5x cashflow.
---
Oh? And all your responders/defenders are constantly logged into their caps, in standing fleet, ready to jump the moment the cyno is lit? 
---
Bull.
---
Your miners can't light 6-min invincible cynos, waiting for everyone to login/fleet up. Now you need to get everyone "formed" before lighting the cyno, and even then, only so many are going to get through before that recon gets blapped off grid. Sure you can bring more, and sure they are SRPed, but the actual **ability** to remove the cyno from grid (at least on Rorqual drops), is a **concrete change** regardless of how much Goons/other null blocs want to spin that it isn't.
---
Hm, I always had the impression known cunts are preferred to be takin in by Goons. \*is irritated\*
---
A surprise change, but a welcome one.
---
People who manufacture stuff locally using buy orders on ore/minerals/salvage will rejoice, instead of fighting against Jita prices.
---
Bringing sought-after goods to deep null using wormholes and blockade runners will rise as a new playstyle.
---
That's your opinion. That's all it is. Bots are almost completely out of null. That's a better Eve. AFK VNI alts are gone. That's a better Eve. NJ I'll has far greater risk. That's a better Eve. The fact that players are leaving because they don't want risk. Fuck them. Bye.
---
you can just have a friend watch your back. Cyno's can now provoke small fights on stations, its a good thing.
---
Good? This in a slight way adds actual geography to New Eden in being closer to a major trade hub is more beneficial, and is exactly how it should. If logistics work is shit, either don't do it or charge a rate that makes it worth it.
---
Thank you, I kissed that the first time. I like it. Nice work.
---
you can definitely gank for example ventures with frigates.
---
Thanks for the explanation. I didn't mean to bash the bot, it's quite a nice idea. Should have read the documentation first :)
---
Daily pcu thread btw
---
Minerbumping.com
---
Look there for some fits. I think it's atron blaster fit
---
what makes you think the people who didn´t still play the game? do you think that the share of people in large nullbloc empires has risen in such dramatic ways because the non-hisec population has grown overall? Because if you do i have some bad news for you.
---
I literally came back to game and was like "wtf Titans are ratting now?".
---
Seriously just put an acc.gate on every anomaly and only allow subcaps of certain types in it. No capitals at all for any ratting. fixed.
---
They should make abyssal pvp for the 3 man frig instances. I think that would have a much more variable and healthy meta
---
We were fighting some one before ccp fucked up drifters? You have this idea that only Goons can start content.
---
what is this "we" nonsense? you are on the receiving end of a one way delivery system. you insert cash, ccp shits out another vanilla scented fart for you to sniff on. or maybe you are naive enough to believe the CSM is anything other than a form of flaccid appeasement, to inspire dullards such as your self into constructing these painfully self aggrandizing smoke screens to throw up, for what reason who really knows? maybe to feel important, or connected in some way, to something you are not connected to.. or maybe just to pacify your unsettling feelings of inadequate understanding of the situation. what ever the case, you arent connected to CCP, and you never will be. you arent connected to me, and you never will be. you are just one voice, a stupid one, in the sea of many who dont care and wish you would just fuck off
---
Sure.
---
But definitely not less than half revenue.
---
Fucks sake, this. The only people that actually give a shit and jerk off over the PCU are the retards checking it every day to fuel their confirmation bias. No one else cares lol
---
unless , you know  425mil from PA and all revenue till now give close to 1bil.       
---
Then yes EVE made almost 1bil, but then it looks even worst if this is your assumption.
---
Or perhaps with the increased effort and cost, it'll make it more profitable and therefore more worthwhile for people to want to do logistics.
---
RIP Vile Rat. I only hope that one day Hillary faces justice for your death.
---
"What? You guys don't have phones?"
---
Independent and successful are contradictory. You say semi-independent which is a good sign. The most important thing is to realize that every successful alliance who has moved into nullsec began by making friends and allies. The first step is to find the patron(s) who can help you get a foothold. Ideally you want to do this somewhere which leaves you good geography, resources, and room to grow.
---
Once you have that foothold the hard part is to survive and grow. Once you're securely established crossing dunbar's number in players(100-150) will be the next big challenge you should expect to face. This is where bureaucracy and management layers start to become critical for your organization to function.
---
Even if devs knew there were risks to Injectors and making caps  break the rock-paper-scissors model, it is possble they underestimated the extent, or how short it would take.  Or maybe in the state the company was at the time (look at our cool VR stuffs!) the idea of increased cash flow for another 4-5 years seemed pretty awesome and no one thought (cared) about beyond that timeframe.
---
I am not saying this was what happened.  But a death in 2020 looks pretty far away if you are in an 11 year old video game in 2015.
---
Undock and fight.  Don't hold more than you can defend, especially with all the new changes.  Make friends with the locals, but don't blue them.  You will earn more respect by keeping neutral and being frenemies to hold fellow sov and help other defend it in the area.  HONOR YOUR AGREEMENTS.
---
Check Branch, Tinal, PureBlind, Fade spots ... alot of things going on there at the moment. Good time, to maybe grab some system and try to start there, getting some experience. :)
---
Except it's not riskless. Burner ships are blingy have low ehp and can be suicided very easily. A burner garmur (polarized) takes one destroyer to suicide on docking attempt, for example.
---
Moon goo is designed to be hard to haul around, to encourage some local production. (It used to be that all the materials got hauled to highsec trade hubs, and then hauled from there to building sites.) You don't want to haul ore *anywhere* in your procurer. Drop it off at the nearest station and haul when you have a hauler full. You could haul earlier if you are isk-crunched.
---
Like your way of thinking. :) It is open source, you can up your own instance.
---
Super ratting is already great ISK you can and we already are ballencing it by making it less safe with the cyno changes and Intel changes.
---
Ganking relies on having enough alpha strike damage to kill your target in a single shot or two. You're far more likely to do that with 8 guns on a destroyer than you are 2-3 guns on a frigate.
---
&gt; Fuck them. Bye.
---
This is the problem with eve. Your toxic bullshit. The toxic bullshit of many people in this sub too. Don't you think its an issue that nullsec is now becoming pretty empty? The amount of activity has plummeted, the ships being killed has dropped, ore mined, rats killed, all gone down. You are so hell bent on your toxic elitist bullshit ideology (because thats exactly what it is) that you cannot see that by pushing this you are effectively going to destroy the game for yourself.
---
Open your god damn eyes.
---
If they're Alpha accounts you're not allowed to log them on at the same time. Are you advocating for them breaking the EULA?
---
That's hard to avoid, a lot of small groups that have survived for a while have ties to one big nullbloc or another. You're basically Turkey, diplomatically you'll need to play the blocs against each other from time to time. 
---
If you want to keep your sov I'd suggest that you get *very* good at diplomacy, even better at asymmetrical warfare, and find a niche that makes you valuable. That way your neighbors have an incentive to keep you around, plus a reason not to fuck with you, and you have people who are skilled at reminding them of both.
---
I mean, honestly the game has been cascading in the other direction (*away* from 'exciting / dynamic') for a decade.
---
Or "QUIT EVE YOU KRAB!" which will happen to this chap in a couple weeks time when the idiots on here turn on him.
---
Gotcha. Same thing as always.
---
Truth is that burner ships are usually seeded in each system that you run missions and you travel to those points unless you know that it us ultra safe.      
---
Those are cheap ratting ships costing like 300mil if you go blingy and you lack skills.          
---
You the missions in the safest moment cycling the agents with pullers and gathering the BM.          
---
Before burners people did normal missions in 1-2bil T3 cruisers or battleships, generating much less LP.
---
It actually upsets people so I didn't see the point in getting rid of it.
---
easy isk from broken mechanic
---
Now you'll just roam endlessly and find nothing.  Wee woo, much content.
---
I’m sure they haven’t noticed, they’ll be shocked
---
WTB polarized rails
---
&gt;Killing afk crabs is the lowest form of PVP. It's basically clubbing defenseless people whose entire point is they want the best tics per hour so they gimped their ships combat ability.
---
And has always been a good 80%+ of pvp. Apart from blocs fighting most pvp oriented people do their best to stay clear of each other.
---
Except it's not. Abyssals over take it especially now that you need mutiple accounts and are risking 30 bill to make half the money of abyssals in high sec. You are cherry picking now. Your so butthurt that long term players have personal supers that you dont care if the changes your advocating for destroy the game.
---
I think that there needs to be a point at which a ship just cant survive, and dies, regardless of how much logi you have on the field. That should be something besides needing to be able to one volley a ship. Faxes, in their current state are capable of supporting subcaps through, in my opinion, way too much incoming fire. Plenty of WH fights see your primary's shield/armor just pinging between full and empty, in a fight that I personally feel should have results in the ship's death.  
---
If CCP was going to commit the dev time, I would absolutely love to see a logi BS introduced, the current t2 logi's nerfed to be "cruiser logi", making room for BS logi so we see more scaling, right now the gap between a guardian and a apostle is enormous.  
---
Limiting the faxes to a single cap booster would also be a viable solution, or backpedaling and removing 3200s, so capitals under neut pressure are less efficient than they are now. Diminishing returns, or a sig radius reduction so capital reps are less effective on smaller ships are all valid changes to try in my opinion.  
---
I just want to see more ships exploding, and more fleet fights being bloody punch for punch, and from my perspective faxes are ruining that. I also dont think EVE would be awful if CCP just nuked them, wed adapt, ships will blow up, maybe get cheaper, but people will keep fighting.
---
which narrative? I only say, that the plain logged in account numbers do not say alot about the actual players playing... 
---
And the second thing is, that I show you, that your calculations/comparisons are wrong.
---
You could bump the dps on certain frigates above 350
---
But definitely not cost efficient
---
You already have fits doing like all burners for it - i think one is discouraged as it simply takes to much time.        
---
Rest of them is like jump in start shooting activate rep
---
aaand I should have read better XD Sorry
---
Basically. If you get your information about Goons from reddit then of course every last one of them is going to be incapable of admitting something is broken.
---
&gt;So you start this post by basically saying anyone who doesn't support these changes
---
Wow, you really put some words in my mouth with that. First of all, you're talking about my reply to your specific statement, not about my reply to OP that actually got downvoted. Second, you implied that "people like me" should just eat up a lie (OP's post claims sub 10k, never happened) and not say anything to point out they're lying or call for people to wait for facts rather than popular opinion. So yes, anyone with a brain would IMO want fact over fiction and make up their own mind rather than follow whatever is most popular on reddit today.
---
Third, i never stated anything about people not supporting the changes being brainless. In fact i didn't state anything about my support or lack of support for these changes, you simply assumed, tossed me into the "for" camp and you're obviously against, so i'm your enemy. I have to assume the act of putting those words in my mouth, knowingly or not, was for that reason.
---
&gt;It is fair to say we should wait in this specific post
---
And my comment was about this specific post. What else would i be talking about? It was a reply to OP's (very short, non factual, annoying due to looking like spam) post.
---
&gt;CCP listening on a minor change while going through with the devastating changes is not something that should be celebrated. It does not show they listen to the community, it shows they are trying to placate the community.
---
So what is "the community", and who voices for it? Because for years people have been complaining the game is stale, now with changes there's a lot of voices complaining the changes are bad, while for the most part not really offering an alternative solution that has been  thought through enough to be functional.
---
You can't complain CCP only listens to "minor changes" about specific problems and solutions and ignores "the community" when there is no coherent plan or demand being brought up or supported by any notable numbers. There is no coherent community or demand for a specific action. At best you'd have a reactonary situation where CCP would have to implement whatever is most loudly called for that particular day, which certainly wouldn't go well for the game either.
---
&gt;Additionally people make posts on what is wrong with these changes or the game but they are always blanket disregarded as "eve is dying" by people who support these changes.
---
I think you're mixing things up there. If people support the changes and think they're going to improve the state of the game, why would they disregard the game as dying (and thus not worth changing anything) at the same time? I'm glad for actual discussion of the changes, and people pointing out flaws or potential. This thread is kind of the complete opposite of that, which is why i posted my original reply to OP.
---
&gt;What are those who think its dying and are trying to make people aware supposed to do? Stay quiet while CCP continues to drive this game off a cliff? 
---
Maybe not endlessly spam "the game is dying!" after every update, creating more threads and upvoting those so that they drown out discussion. Or if they do want to create threads like that, *at least* don't make things up and act like they're facts to support their opinion/outcry.
---
&gt;If these numbers concerned you, you wouldn't be taking the stance you did.
---
My stance is of rational thinking rather than assumptions. I don't know the "magic fix" for eve's current situation and i don't think anyone does. People who claim they have the magic fix and say it's "just -insert vague action with no clear method-" like "just make space worth fighting over" IMO have clearly no actual clue and posts like OP's that aim to stir outrage some more and drown out discussion are IMO less than worthless. The lowering player numbers are concerning, yes. The solution isn't "let things be, all change is bad", it's not "i'm inconvenienced, the game is dying" and people wanting changes have wildly different opinions that actually need discussing to figure out if their changes hold any real value at all.
---
I'm not "for" these changes, or against, myself. I'm mixed about the changes thus far - blackout was sort of good as it removed perfect intel for null blocs but isn't really the "one solution". Market changes have been just kind of odd. The cyno changes are a good idea but i'm not sure about the implementation (recons and... blops of all things?). A lot of the chaos era stuff has been a mixed bag in outcome, but at least CCP is doing something to shake things up. They have let things be for far too long and there's no clear single solution. One can be concerned about player numbers without adamantly believing all these changes are purely terrible and the game is dying because of them. Concern does not equal outrage.
---
Fair enough.  I'll just say that that's definitely not been my experience, and have pretty much never been required to be on comms unless it was for obvious reasons (in a fleet, looking to get saved ratting, whatever :p)
---
On smaller scale battles like the one you describe you are right. I should have clarified that i was mostly viewing things in the scope of nullsec fleet fights.
---
You are also right that i don't drop caps. But i originally played with a group that was often hunting caps in subcaps, not flying them ourselves, so i can in fact agree with what you're saying in the context of smaller fights (i was with these guys, this moros is the first cap kill in the history of eve -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt43tpQWdAg )
---
The difficulty in balancing things is how oppressive they become in in big fights, due to the fact that they scale too well as you add more of them.
---
&gt; indeed, those people still do chores
---
why should they get payed for it?
---
Too bad will be lighting things for eve online soon in other places.
---
Well sure I'm too harsh on it as a playstyle but it's true killing VNIs or barges is not exactly a challenge. Killing them with a standing fleet trying to help them might be. Killing the standing fleet is another challenge. Then you have the dedicated PVP people in FW lowsec... 
---
There's a lot of opportunities for PVP people are just scared of it and the overwhelming safety and profit of null in the last year's due to citadels and capitals isn't helping people move mentally from making ISK to using that ISK to pursue PVP goals whatever they are.
---
You will want to be ready to lead ADM fleets, if the folks don’t rat/mine enough to keep the ADM’s up.
---
You’ll want to seed citadels in your jump off points so they are easy to drop. Make sure everyone has sov hacking ships. Make sure citadel timing is standardized. Make sure ACL’s for citadels are standardized. 
---
Teamwork will be the biggest asset.
---
Given local raw materials are distinctly cheaper than Jita it's not as if "fighting against Jita prices" has ever really been an issue for local builders.
---
Those instances make sense. :)
---
That is reddit as a whole more or less the last few years
---
I have a personal super lol I mined it with my rorq so it's free btw. I also built some more rorq hulls cuz I didn't know what to do with the ore. It's great that Abyssal sites are providing good income I don't like that they're instances but at least they require some of the skills that translate to PVP to complete compared to running anoms.
---
You actually expect him to read this? You just roast him in the not fun way and end it by saying "isn't meant to attack you". All you did was point all the flaws, give no solutions on how to make things better, and said 'you need to make it better not worse'. Wtf do you think "Hilly" is trying to do. He's trying to improve the game but it's not working out
---
My bad, never knew it didn't exist in the game. I was about to swear that I've died to a hecate dishing insane amount of dps at 120km. But hey people use polarized weapons for pvp all the time. Polarized torpedo launchers are very common, also I remember a guy with polarized proteus(back when proteus used to be cool) in PB/Fade area killing VNIs in less than 5 seconds.
---
fuck goons. You are one of the problem.
---
I think you mean that there is a prime opportunity to be a local producer for a smaller market because its not just free and easy to move stuff with a jf atm...
---
I'm not toxic. I just don't give a shit what people do. If they want to quit, then go. Eve constantly changes. Adapt or die. Null is not empty. I'm there every day. Maybe new alliances will come in and take over. That's called content. Bring in the players willing to take risk. Those in null want to play and assume the risk. Those that left didn't belong there. Period.
---
Goons will fight you but not try to take your Sov. PL will try only to get you to pay them rent. Test will require some Diplo to keep them from annexing you system for the group crashing on their couch this week. Frat is another story, if they can take it they will. More bot systems the better for them.
---
&gt; The very fact that the game is dangerous and loss hurts makes friendship valuable in EVE.
---
You say this, then blame players when they run to the biggest group of "friends" in the game.
---
 [https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/bLusb3xajqQa8EEnA](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/bLusb3xajqQa8EEnA)
---
I don't? When did I blame players joining null blocs?
---
Really nice but i feel like there will be a lot of false positives since most people would check the killmail/wreck and loot the good stuff.
---
period basis is total empty:))
---
I have to take some pride in becoming the avatar of your enemy. Most people are just people. I've become an *archetype.* 
---
Which is to say, I never said any of that shit, but, hey, I appreciate featuring so prominently in your fantasy.
---
I remember how disappointed I was when I tried out null for the first time.
---
My character had 11 million in industry/research. I found some niches and worked with others in high sec, managed to "live off the land" by building everything in low sec as a challenge.
---
I gave null a try, joined a growing alliance, and I immediately felt useless. Everything was jumped in. Materials were jumped out to get Jita-esque prices. I spent some time building starter kits for low SP members (fitted T1s, ventures) but it was just so demoralizing to see my playstyle stomped out.
---
Ultimately I ended up going back to high sec and extracting out those skills, and re-injecting to become a combat pilot.
---
Imagine being such a colossal retard that you think this is the players fault and not CCPs fault lmao
---
Fuck off and let it burn
---
No idea who is was or why he's so remembered, but I still salute a fellow fallen eve players.
---
I mean, if you have enough frigates you can gank anything, so technically yes it's possible.
---
In reality, the only time i've personally seen people do it is when they used torp bombers en masse to gank particularly juicy freighters
---
They dont require any pvp skill lol. Its instanced pve which is why I find it curious that people keep bitching about super ratting where you make yourself an active target able to be killed in a 30 bill ship for 180 mill a hour. Vs a instanced pve where you cant be killed that makes 400 mill a hour. Sounds like your all just butthurt about goons and want to kill the game just for grr goons
---
this applies more to logistics than combat side but the cyno is more times an alt that is just left to its fate be that it lives or dies. Knowing who it belongs to in a large alliance is like finiding 1 set peace of hay in a hay stack
---
Fleet commander
---
Daily retard thread btw
---
Right. The titan spam is ridiculous.
---
Or I love it soo much everyone should play it
---
Not playing is the best content that EVE offers these days. CCP bad.
---
Whip the lazy alliance mates a bit so they will help and raise the prices/wages to match the inxreased workload. Okay, I can't really make this work for our wh mapping but why can't you? :P
---
Thats the phase we are in really, the Diplo, and the one that I am a big part of, hence this thread. So far we are developing a decent working relationship, helping them with ops from our current staging etc.. so here's hoping I can do a good enough job.
---
This is good advice, thanks.
---
Because of the various cloud and other mechanics they require more piloting skills than anom ratting. That's a positive to me.
---
Au contraire you sound like your eating Mittens propaganda about how a slight inconvenience to Goons is gonna kill EVE. He's just afraid of what else CCP might do next that might really hurt. Because let's be honest having to spend an extra 300mil per rorq save isn't it is it?
---
xD not going to go into where due to Op Sec.
---
are you rambling about the Blackout cus you can't krab? Fuck off. Local is the source of multiple problems with this game.
---
you can do burner agents in all security space. Go take a look at npc null and see what they bot, not burners usually.
---
That was a multi-year smear attack that led no where.  It was made for political purposes, not because congressional republicans cared one whit for the lives.
---
Sure, at elast against ventures, or in extreme densities.
---
But an Atron wouldn't be that.
---
Destroyers are just more cost effective because frigates normally nly fit 3 guns at max, and destroyers are almost all 6+ guns. And the hulls don't really cost that much more.
---
So needing half as many people is great!
---
Indeed, growing the alliance is one of the things we are trying to prepare for. Personally I have never been a part of anything bigger than 50 people, so that is especially a daunting for me.
---
You already have a big cargohold.
---
What would no mass limit help achieve in terms of improving gameplay? Blackout at least help kill the bots that riddle NS
---
&gt; what makes you think the people who didn´t still play the game?
---
i don't, that was my point.
---
Good thing op posted a dozen articles for you to read
---
You're starting from the false premise that the goal of a small alliance wanting sov is to become a large alliance. There always are and always have been many many small alliances who are perfectly content to remain small alliances.
---
F.
---
Yeah maybe latter stuck in night shift
---
The cloud mechanics are not used on t4 and some t5 most people dont do the ones that require it because the same loot is dropped between all types of filaments. So we have established you dont know what the fuck your talking about. How about you explain the 20k drop in player numbers in 2 months
---
RIP. I’m going to randomly shoot a blue today.
---
no it doesn't lol
---
if ganking required alpha why would code have used the lowest alpha weapon system since the beginning of time
---
I don't understand how it's the players' fault for working within the confines of the system provided to them. Of course they're going in min-max in a competitive online game... the cream is always going to rise to the top to smother the rest. If there is a more "successful" way to play the game people are going to favor that and it will push out the less effective styles once proven.
---
&gt;And my comment was about this specific post. What else would i be talking about? It was a reply to OP's (very short, non factual, annoying due to looking like spam) post.
---
I was agreeing with you that this post was preemptive. Nothing more.
---
&gt;Third, i never stated anything about people not supporting the changes being brainless. In fact i didn't state anything about my support or lack of support for these changes, you simply assumed, tossed me into the "for" camp and you're obviously against, so i'm your enemy. I have to assume the act of putting those words in my mouth, knowingly or not, was for that reason.
---
You are just defending the changes so correct you never explicitly declared that you support them, but you are acting as if you do. 
---
&gt;You can't complain CCP only listens to "minor changes" about specific problems and solutions and ignores "the community" when there is no coherent plan or demand being brought up or supported by any notable numbers. There is no coherent community or demand for a specific action. At best you'd have a reactonary situation where CCP would have to implement whatever is most loudly called for that particular day, which certainly wouldn't go well for the game either.
---
All the problems we have now, Rorquals, injectors, citadels, were all decried by the community and widely explained why they would be bad for the game. So when you think CCP is listening because they made a minor fix for ceremonial reasons, you are ignoring literal years of players saying "HEY THIS CHANGE WILL BE BAD" and CCP acting shocked when the change ends up bad. 
---
&gt;Maybe not endlessly spam "the game is dying!" after every update, creating more threads and upvoting those so that they drown out discussion. Or if they do want to create threads like that, at least don't make things up and act like they're facts to support their opinion/outcry.
---
Every thread that is made opposing these changes and offering suggestions r/eve takes as "EVE IS DYING" post. No post is allowed to criticize without being labeled as such so your complaint about their being to many eve is dying posts is wrong. Additionally had this post been accurate it would have been a monumental thing to note and would have deserved its own thread.
---
&gt;I'm not "for" these changes, or against, myself. I'm mixed about the changes thus far - blackout was sort of good as it removed perfect intel for null blocs but isn't really the "one solution". Market changes have been just kind of odd. The cyno changes are a good idea but i'm not sure about the implementation (recons and... blops of all things?). A lot of the chaos era stuff has been a mixed bag in outcome, but at least CCP is doing something to shake things up. They have let things be for far too long and there's no clear single solution. One can be concerned about player numbers without adamantly believing all these changes are purely terrible and the game is dying because of them. Concern does not equal outrage.
---
You saying "I am not for these changes" but then go ahead and say both nullsec changes were good and the one that hurts highsec is bad. So again you can claim to not have a stance on these but your actual stance is very clear. The chaos era stuff has not been a mixed bag of outcome, it has been one outcome an accelerated decline of the game. Unfortunately any time this is pointed out you get one of two responses "You don't have all the data" or "Well me and my 3 friends came back so the game is doing great."
---
Significant testing is an issue, since that would mean changes happen over the course of a year+ rather than as fast as they have been. If that were the case, we might have had blackout happen sometime next january and the cyno change sometime at the end of the year. They're pretty core mechanics, not easy to change and properly testing is going to take forever, far longer than the game has considering the status quo did (and still does, obviously) need drastic changes for the long term health of the game.
---
&gt; suicided very easily
---
Only if you are worse than goons level of bad.
---
Undock, warp to insta, warp to mission. That's it, station ganker completely nullified. Someone who want's to mess with you has to scan you down, warp to you, and take the accel gate before you kill the burner in ~1 minute in the correct fit. Then you warp back to station.
---
I already explained why the peak count and averages of player counts are irrelevant in my first comment of this post. Many other people have also explained why every year we have a summer drop in players that picks up after October.
---
Should have specified null burners.
---
You can easily substitute "kicking ppl" with "having a leadership with a negative score in charisma". Or you can do both.

is it any different than signing your name in the funeral registry book?
---
Just watch out for CODE and friends now that you’ve posted this screen cap with your local system clearly visible. Expand your local channel and set those shits to -10 standing so you see them pop in.
---
how do I dscan the remote system before right click jump?
---
I think the piece you're missing is what small alliances represent. Small alliances are the future content of the game; every empire starts small, and if they just get farmed out of existence, they can never really come into their own and grow into competition for today's big empires. 
---
It's all about *content*. The meme here is that null sec blocks are laying the blame for the lack of content on CCP when really the blobbing of any new entity with any shred of promise is what's causing the lack of content.
---
You're right, people will likely choose to kill the easiest target. The problem is that if you kill all the fawns, eventually all that's left are the old deer, and when they die, you have nothing left to hunt. 
---
So why should the blobs stop fucking over the small alliances? So the game doesn't stagnate and die.
---
This just in: Mining excitement in High Sec.
---
You are absolutely correct. Once CCP left the relatively balanced official forums for player input in favor of Reddit, special chat channels, and other partisan forms of communication and opinion gathering, the echo chamber effect just overwhelmed the diversity of development until we have reached this time of chaos. Reddit should be one source of data, but CCP needs to actively reach out and obtain information from outside their normal channels and from customers they normally don't regulary interact with on a frequent basis. The tribalism we now experience in EVE has been in great part to CCP's decisions on how,when, and who they will communicate with those that buy their product.
---
I mis-understood his original statement, if you read down a bit.  I thought he wanted a different right click info on cyno beacons on your overview, where dscan can solve that dilemma for you.
---
I corrected myself otherwise once I understood what he meant and suggested simply removing industrial cynos from being visible on capitals on their capacitor right click menu.
---
For a small group that wants to do PvP and make isk, why not take a WH system? That way you aren't beholden to blueing everything within 3 regions, you make some of the best isk in the game, and you can fight everyone. Additionally, you aren't tied to fighting the same people every day as your neighbors change every day. You won't ever get blobbed by titans or supers. WH mass will limit the size of the fights to closer to the number of pilots you can actually field. It's everything you want, without all the politics and blues that will kill your ability to PvP.
---
There are thousands of empty WH systems that are waiting to be claimed today. With very few exceptions, you can get the class and WH effect (if you want PvP don't go with any effect) you want. What more could you want?
---
That requires having a critical mass of mineral miners/moon miners/production citadels/industrialists to make your market not a shithole.
---
Guess which groups have those and which don't.
---
Only broke the launcher for some people not everyone
---
Gotta have rorquals/good moons to make local raw materials cheaper than Jita and highesec miners. If you aren't big enough to protect rorquals you don't have those advantages.
---
Build and seed t1 industrials all along your alliance’s jump routes.
---
T1 manufacturing finally brings on a profit.
---
Never since 2005 have player counts been this low. This is not seasonal this is systemic. I'm going to put this as simply as possible for you.
---
Ccp was just acquired by PA then ccp loses more than half its revenue in 2 months. 
---
Do you think PA is going to:
---
A.oh it's ok we made a huge investment in you guys but you lost half your revenue and active players in 2 months and are now running at a extreame deficit, dont worry we will still be paying to keep the lights on for the 5000 players who only roam around pvping now.
---
Or 
---
B: you have not measured up to our performance standards we are shutting the company down because there are not enough active users to pay for the servers let alone run a profit.
---
The cyno is lit.
---
Who was he?
---
This just in: Salt moons reportedly in development.
---
Buffer tanked Archons that jump in, cap chain, launch sentries, set them to assist the FC who then nukes targets.
---
There is no other mmo out there that is still running when there are only 20000 users on at peak time. Not a single one
---
This wont affect the larger groups that much honestly. Yes there are concerns and the cyno chain will need more upkeep but its not a huge issue for those with permanent cynochains. It will affect the individuals much worse.
---
And I see bunch of comments about this and that. Nothing will really change, its just more tedious. Which was not the intention of the cyno change, it wasnt meant to affect logistics which should really tell you all you need about CCPs capacity to actually gain the results they want from a change.
---
Boy sure PA will just give up on the performance of less than a quarter yes you're totally right that's how everything operates on the 60mil turnover per year rate yes correct thank you for righting me there.
---
Nah bro you're definitely wrong
---
A fully t1 thrasher can gank a full flight of drones in a 0.7 system or lower.
---
This just in: Complaints about vector alignment status bar. Is it OCD or a legitimate grievance? More at 6
---
And I find some friends and do my best to get a revenge kill just for the fun of it. Thanks for the tip anyways.
---
did you unironically suggest a change for your *feelings*?
---
consider biomassing your current living clone
---
I never liked most of the goons. To soft, scared to come out of their bubble but, Vile Rat was good people. He is sorely missed and it's a darker galaxy without him.
---
So make it harder to create local markets by making localized mining less safe and make importing harder by nerfing cynos. This will surely revitalize nullsec and make them less stagnate. Just ccp things.
---
Maybe.
---
This is UX design really.
---
It can be changed to provide a better user experience following the logic people have figured out a long time ago.
---
Tell me why they wouldnt cut their losses? There are probably less that 15k paying account. Less than that log in.
---
I see a new money making opportunity. Orca ganking for isk. Roll up the cost of the tags in the contract price per orca. Make the fee somewhere near but not too close to orca prices. You just need a bunch of accounts, and not be afraid to input broadcast on the down-low. Who do we know like that?
---
Hey oldmecha/marsha! Business opportunity here!
---
This! You hit the nail on the head. You don’t care about the game. You don’t care what it’s centered around. Its about your personal view of what you think i get or want. You don’t understand how destruction is the heart that pumps the blood in eve. This is why the game is struggling
---
I was in Fleet with him once 07
---
Because people like simple funny images. That's why memes became popular. I don't know how you related this to somehow fucking up the game, like everybody should throw all their things and go read all of this sub ASAP. Like, wtf. Not every discussion worth of reading and a lot less worth of participating.
---
Because this isn't the corner grocery store lol. GTFO with your napkin math people don't buy companies like that only to get rid of them at the first sign of trouble this isn't your personal life economics we're talking about. Also the idea that CCP made those changes without PA backing up the risk is fucking ridiculous.
---
Revitalize null? Do you know what you're saying at all, or just parroting?
---
&gt; You are just defending the changes so correct you never explicitly declared that you support them, but you are acting as if you do. 
---
Correct, i prefer the changes over the nothingness that came before. Because if left as is the fate of the game longterm was certain.
---
&gt;All the problems we have now, Rorquals, injectors, citadels, were all decried by the community and widely explained why they would be bad for the game. So when you think CCP is listening because they made a minor fix for ceremonial reasons, you are ignoring literal years of players saying "HEY THIS CHANGE WILL BE BAD" and CCP acting shocked when the change ends up bad. 
---
So is this the only problem? You seem to fall into the same category i pointed at, as people who know exactly what the current issue is and changing it in one specific way will just make everything go away. You don't have the magic fix, though. Remove rorquals, remove skill injectors, remove structures and you'd still have the status quo. Large groups, unwilling to fight, perfect intel and umbrella keeping their space safe, endlessly farming ISK until they get bored, quit the game and have dragged all of null with them, and  eventually the entire game as the economy got shafted beyond recovery.
---
CCP most definitely made a whole bunch of mistakes and i certainly think they were a part of creating the current situation, but decrying changes made *now* over mistakes made with how they implemented things 3 or more years ago isn't particularly helpful.
---
&gt;Every thread that is made opposing these changes and offering suggestions r/eve takes as "EVE IS DYING" post. No post is allowed to criticize without being labeled as such so your complaint about their being to many eve is dying posts is wrong. Additionally had this post been accurate it would have been a monumental thing to note and would have deserved its own thread.
---
I've seen the discussion threads pop up and while plenty of people seem to be on this subreddit solely to yell eve is dying,
---
WH was discussed, however generally speaking there was more interest in Null
---
Yes, let's just throw decades of UX design in the garbage because UX is literally all about feelings.
---
Better graphics are also all about feelings. The entire basis of MAKING THIS BAR in the first place is about feelings.
---
It's about 4:20 (AYY LMAO)
---
I... I can't believe it but he actually does. Holy shit. Goonswarm confirmed CIA assets
---
This day should be Amercan nightmare in delve ;)
---
CCP's UI/UX design has never been their strong suit...
---
You are missed, friend. o7
---
This just in: New CCP concept art leaked. Speculation about Anthropomorphic anime ships leaves neckbeards drooling across the universe. But will mom bring the tendies?
---
Or somwhere around 0xFFFFFFFF. Or 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, since we have 64 bit clients now.
---
Yeah, that's why I'm helping.
---
Just not the crabbing ones.... You know most people life in high sec right????  What you think they do there??
---
Isn't there a sizable membership of SA forum members that are/were apart of the US military? Genuinely curious.
---
Then your delusional. There's not point in arguing with someone who cant see reality. Good bye.
---
Nobody is forcing you to go attack blobs.
---
Personally if I could get 40 actives together I’d just go and snatch one or a few dead renter systems and see what the landlords reaction is. I think there’s a decent chance they’d just let you have it if it is unused and you ware willing to blue up their renters.
---
hate to break it to ya but quick iteration isn't either
---
Perhaps if you could afford them you would know most of that is travel fleets.
---
Ccp is powerless against players in their own game.
---
Don't get too puffed up; it'd be Aryth but I don't think he's even heard of Reddit
---
it's a timer... it's purpose is to display an amount of remaining time
---
your feelings don't affect how time works
---
&gt; Reminder: EVE does not belong to you
---
Fixed. The most people can do is stop giving CCP money.
---
Wasn't the issue nullsec was stagnate? People are constantly saying that is the issue.
---
&gt;preventing them from playing the game with any degree of safety
---
but this isnt the case at all - there are multiple regions designed to provide pretty much perfect safety to people. 
---
the issue here is that these people want to be able to play in the richest part of space, without any of the downsides that comes with that...
---
Lol sounds fucking bonkers I love it. 
---
Why 'cats' though? I get the 'slow' now for sure
---
punisher 4 guns
---
Wise decission :)
---
Yeah that's fair, I still find some subreddits are reasonable
---
No u :)
---
Where have you been? The war between Legacy and Winter Co. Has been burning for 6 months or more now.... Sure, it's been "slow going" in terms of sov won/lost but I don't think that's the point- We've had a very engaging and exciting open war.
---
id rather take a chance that hilmar fucks it up, even if its a high chance, than a certainty we were heading towards before.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Yeah, but... sometimes you just gotta try.
---
you gonna scan people with orca? silly..  do it with venture/prospect to not let them know.passive targetter and  ship scanner is key module to know if target is easy
---
Oh my god, you're actually using that ship? Do me a favor and just uninstall you pleb. No wait, do YOURSELF a favor and uninstall. k thx bye.
---
I would bet so, I know there's whole corps out there that target veterans to be members. I'm sure someone's got CIA assets in their corp and probably doesn't even know
---
yes, but the vocal minority that the developers are currently listening to want that to change.
---
they want it to be harder to earn isk, and acquire minerals.
---
that means less minerals will enter the game - making ship prices go up due to lower supply of building materials, and then those now more expensive ships will take longer to purchase as they want people to earn less in-game currency.
---
Move into wormholes instead. Better isk, less politics, less bullshit all-around.
---
It doesn't display the time at all though.
---
The current implementation is already nonfunctional in that regard.
---
So using UX principles to make it make you feel better about the time and make the bar appear more useful would be smart.
---
Whoops.
---
To a certain extent. It really does not take a whole year to engage in testing proposed changes, *unless* you find through that testing other issues that your changes create that need to be addressed (still should not take a year if you have an adequate design and QA team). Then, sure you need to spread changes out as you work to get it right; however, the alternative is you just push shit to live server, break the game in some way, tank a portion of your end users' experience, and destroy customer confidence. 
---
Neither of which are very good business practices for an MMO developer/publisher.
---
Start reducing enemy system ADM before you show your hand. If you guys have a little isk, contracting effective mercs might be the best opening move.
---
Consider your target. Have they had many entosis fights? Entosis fights require a lot of communication and plenty of extra entosis ships. 
---
Good luck to your group, hope to see ya out there.
---
Yes, it’s easy. The changes are making PvP even easier. Ignore the sperg you see on r/eve and jump in.
---
Check out any of the new player friendly Corporations like Brave, Horde, KarmaFleet(My corp), or Eve University. Each has various ship replacement programs so that you dont have to struggle to get back in a ship if you lose one.  All have various flavors and styles but each seem to accomplish similar outcomes.  Enjoy.
---
eh, I found you could build a T1 module that doesnt have a cheap meta 1 or meta 4 variant and sell them on market and people would buy them for disposable ships as a decent rate.  usually a 3-4x markup over jita price and STILL occasionally you would see "player X has bought 400 medium shield extenders" - usually a manufacturer for T2.
---
Get a survey scanner and scan the amount left on the rock, then shut off your mining laser cycle half way through when the rock gets low so you can be the guy who pops the rock.  You going to pvp on rocks... get serious man.
---
WH isn't bad advice. I was wondering why you hadn't considered it.
---
I know it sucks but I'm an alpha clone so I'm stuck with it. FYI my main income is nullsec exploration, I was setting up my new phone so decided to mine in the meantime.
---
You know there was a day that GS figured out the r/eve was an actual "community" and that it kicked your ass down to Delve.  You guys have been trying to destabilize that ever since...so well played.
---
When you start taking SOV, have a close look on the mood in your gang. Such transitions CAN cause stress and might make ppl act odd if something looks like going south or not as expected. Keep an ear open to your folks wishes and concerns all the time. Some might be bonkers, cause of misinformation or interpreting things wrong. Some might be thinking about stuff you just didnt have on your checklist. Talk to your gang and with your gang. If things needa be done that are "no fun"( welcome to fozzie-SOV ;) ) give em explanations why its important to do it.   
---
You and the group you are with right now will be the very base of whatever you ll build out of it in the future. Make this "primal seed" as healthy as possible.  
---
Good luck out there!
---
on nearly any t1 production but larger combat hulls you can get a good markup in null.  if you are the one to make and move cyno ships, people will pay 10x the cost without blinking.
---
Hit the fucking nail on the head.
---
And they cannot grasp it either dude...
---
See you in the black commander :(
---
RIP Viletat
---
Yes because the alliances now will have 1tril isk+ losses to make sure their line members can make a few more bil a month. 
---
And your condescending attitude does wonders to convey that you have the health of the game in mind and not your hatred of specific playstyles
---
I can't say I agree, having worked under him, nor would I voluntarily do so again.
---
I'll give him credit in that he did actively and passionately play some of the games he presided over though.
---
The alliance and SOV ideas are meant to be implemented as one whole package (I probably should have clarified/formatted better.) The complete idea behind it is to at-least split up the super umbrellas and make them more manageable to engage on an alliance level, nothing can be done to stop alliances from blueing each other though. The reason for not adding the exponential cost to I-Hubs without upgrades is to not discourage alliances from taking other alliances space (you may not be able to fully use the system, but neither can your enemies) 
---
Any resource depletion mechanic is going to have the same issue of punishing players of different time zones, by not having a resource depletion mechanic there is no need for people to move to less used systems, thus you will still have very large groups in one region under one super umbrella.
---
Moon idea is just to split up the resources a-little bit more between High/Low/Null/WH to incentivize inter-security trading.
---
Well, not getting into alot of specifics here, but there is a interest in developing a cap fleet, growing into a respectable size etc. 
---
There is something about taking Sov, and holding it that seems satisfying, and leadership kinda likes the idea of politics.
---
First,
---
&gt; Assuming that because
---
assuming what? I assumed nothing, I described my own experience. While you see it proper to extrapolate your experience in a way where you suddenly are entitled to represent some abstract "majority". And after that somehow I am the narcissist?
---
Second, there are particular game changes and a particular aftermath after them. Instead of discussing them in particular you consider it as better move to teach me life lessons.
---
Bravo.
---
Faction warfare is great isk and is pretty good place for most people to enter the game at. Null sec used to not be great isk really either back in the day. People didn’t rat in supers, or carriers really even. The space was dangerous to do that. Ccp is trying to make null sec dangerous again
---
&gt; "NO WAIT NOT LIKE THAT! I DID NOT MEAN IT!"
---
Seriously. And the hyperbolic statements are getting ridiculous. 
---
&gt; Cyno's gone
---
Um. No they aren't. The way they were used is. YES things are more difficult or different now than before but seriously many have been asking for this type of change up. Now that its here, people immediately lose all faith in CCP to do anything good long-term for the game.
---
If CCP is catering to /r/eve like people keep claiming, then why is the entire sub nothing but doom and gloom, yet when I get on and play with people, I'm having a blast in game every night.
---
Everyone here is so damn depressing. 2/3 of the things that make me unhappy in this game I'm coming to realize are negative opinions here about literally everything that I've just parroted over the years. The more I tune this sub out, the happier I am in game.
---
Adapting to changes. I approve.
---
I did just that right when it's about to deplete and so did they, I got around 9000 m3 once that mess started.
---
&gt;it was an interesting fight
---
What - waiting for Concord? How exactly did you fight?  
---
&gt;hasnt come back for round 2 sadly
---
So you can let Concord defend you again?  
---
Which is why it’s an issue that they pay falcon to literally read this community’s circlejerk for game fucking balance
---
Whether you like it or not
---
we all play eve with op.  And if not why be here?
---
If you disagree that fozzie sov sucks, cit spam sucks, caps are strong and rorquals are ridiculous.
---
Then make a counter case
---
But the point wasn’t that.  It’s that the game is hemorrhaging players and that WILL affect even the most edgy and blind of us
---
No, they want null to be the dangerous space it's supposed to be. Mining &amp; ratting 24/7 in complete safety is ridiculous. They make a charge where krabs have to actually play the game instead of afking for long periods and you all start sulking about it. I don't think CCP are there yet with balancing/changes but we are heading in the right direction.
---
Yes it does. It most def caters to griefers and no matter what they say most ganking isnt about isk, its just about "content" and "salt farming". This is CCPs wishes and honestly the main ideology of this game. And its specifically the reason why this game never gains any real traction, people dont wanna play a game where they dont know the rules and especially not in a game where everything takes so fking long to do, like making isk initially, like training skills, like understanding the massive complexity of the game.
---
Many people try this game and fall into the same trap as you currently are, why retention rates are abysmal.
---
😥
---
Rest in peace o7
---
so we're all gonna roll horde ok?
---
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that r/eve is an actually community. Your confusion seems to be that you think it is *the* EVE online community, which it is not. 
---
It turns out, particularly when you are talking about communities on third party websites for games, that virtual communities tend to be self-selecting, and *not*, in any way, representative of the overall gaming community. 
---
Case in point, r/eve attracts a lot of people who have narcissistic personality disorder, and think because they are part of *a* community built around a game, that they are *the* community for that game.
---
Dont do it, blackout has ruined NS
---
Stay off this sub, nothing but bitter, grumpy old men that will warp your view of the game.
---
f
---
Funny, the blackout is what makes us the most excited and is a primary reason \*why\* we are doing it.
---
Because that's what PL named it. They named their fleet doctrines that way for a while; "Hellcats" for example were pulse Abaddons that were a strong counter to the Drake blobs that everyone ran in 2010.
---
How about we let the actual game developers develop their own game? Instead of proposing some pipe dream scenarios to r/eve about what could "fix eve" we could discuss things that actually exist in game and how to make them work to our (actual players) advantage (playstyle). Sadly this will never happen as this sub thrives on salt and posts from people who played eve once/quit years ago and  just love to troll Reddit.
---
It's because when the evil PA asked CCP what Alliance was the biggest threat to reduce TQ to Serenity-levels of stagnation, CCP offered Goons up for the slaughter while they hid TAPI caringly behind their backs and all of Legacy with it. 
---
We're secretly being fed small amounts of local to keep us from wilting and they even sing us the noobship cyno song for goodnight.
---
It's almost as if there was a recent game release, some sort of classic server for one of if not the biggest game currently, no doubt recent changes have pushed people away but WoW will certainly affect the numbers.
---
That's not really how it works - burners rarely spawn in the agent's system. They can spawn anywhere in the agent's constellation or in any neighbouring constellation in the same region, so you're going to have to take gates while doing them.
---
Log in with account A, hit a drone, lose a ship, log in with account B, hit a drone, lose a ship, shampoo rinse and repeat.
---
You sound like a right baby.
---
I didnt know cloaky camping raised adms
---
You point is invalid, this isnt chaos and cant be compared to it. This is just tedious fkery.
---
Real chaos, please gief. Thats what people have been clamoring for. We didnt ask for fozziesov, nor ten million timers for citadels or cyno jammers that are hilariously broken. Chaos would be removing those things, not just making it more boring for players that are trying to live around already broken things.
---
&gt;Correct, i prefer the changes over the nothingness that came before. Because if left as is the fate of the game longterm was certain.
---
And I prefer changes that don't actively kill the game. Fine CCP you tried blackout and by any reasonable metric it failed, revert it. Try something new that is fine, but if they are going to try things they need to see when it is going worse and step back.
---
&gt;So is this the only problem? You seem to fall into the same category i pointed at, as people who know exactly what the current issue is and changing it in one specific way will just make everything go away. You don't have the magic fix, though. Remove rorquals, remove skill injectors, remove structures and you'd still have the status quo. Large groups, unwilling to fight, perfect intel and umbrella keeping their space safe, endlessly farming ISK until they get bored, quit the game and have dragged all of null with them, and eventually the entire game as the economy got shafted beyond recovery.
---
&gt;CCP most definitely made a whole bunch of mistakes and i certainly think they were a part of creating the current situation, but decrying changes made now over mistakes made with how they implemented things 3 or more years ago isn't particularly helpful.
---
No but we can tell them the changes they are trying to make are not going to fix the situation. Both changes they made recently are taking the easy route. Local is a problem, lets reduce and make nullsec work for that intel, except adding a way to generate that intel requires work to design.
---
Cyno changes are even worse. Yes cynos need to be changed, but jumping to 9 ships able to use cynos is insane, how about start with no capitals.
---
We have all kinds of feedback but CCP is set in their ways and as I pointed out we have been shouting for years "THIS WILL END BADLY" and repeatedly proven right.  If we are not allowed to reference the past of CCP ignoring us then we might as well have no voice.
---
&gt;You continue to put words into my mouth. The "highsec" change affected everyone, and i found it odd, i never said it was bad. I just don't know what specific problem it was attempting to fix, and don't like the "push" towards structures as main markets; the actual effects... eh, everyone copes and life moved on. I did strongly dislike the (lack of) communication about the change from CCP though, since it was basically put in with a single announcement that was removed from the launcher within 24 hours of the patch and the details hidden in the previous patch notes. The null blackout is good... because let's face it, perfect intel by using log-scraping bots alerting everyone in your bloc about a threat 3+ jumps away is plain toxic for the game. It's not the ideal solution by far and i hope it's temporary, but i honestly can't say i can think of a better one than turning off local, at least until a better solution comes along. The cyno change, similarly, focuses on an actual problem and i think it'll achieve it to some degree but i don't know the full outcome. Waiting to see, basically.
---
&gt;These are reasonable stances, none of them are strictly "for" or "against". If you wish to see anyone that's not with you as being against you, so be it, but that doesn't change my actual stance and tribalism is the last thing needed in EVE right now.
---
You literally keep speaking out of both sides of your mouth. You write a paragraph on how these changes are good and then say but that doesn't mean you support them. How can you seriously try to take both sides. You don't get to be the arbiter of reasonable stances to take when you are explicitly saying a change is good for the game. You have a bias.
---
Just like most of reddit you have no idea how local reporting tools worked. They scraped the chat log after a person reported the hostile. The intel tools did not rely on local as they still exist. They relied on players reporting hostiles in their area. Now everyone is blind to who is near them. Also local was not perfect intel, all it told you was if someone was in system, it did not tell you if they were docked, cloaked, ratting, mining or anything else. People used this fact to get kills all the time. Just because it hurt the ability for roaming gangs to come assault large empires you think it was to good and had to go away. And yes it isn't a perfect solution but it made the game worse, so you are fine with the game being worse in the interim. You are falling into the same trap you are accusing me of, except you prefer the new status quo instead of the previous status quo despite the loss to the player base.
---
Same with cynos, you have no idea again. The problem is supers and titans being able to attack sub caps, it is not cynos. Fixing this problem and leaving cynos as they were was the better solution but again people told CCP this and they jumped to the most drastic change possible that also takes the least amount of work by them.
---
&gt;Okay, so do you have the full data? Do you know what the game will be like in a year from now, when the chaos era has ended and CCP has figured out the new full picture of what eve online will be in its mechanics? You can talk about individual changes, pros and cons, but you can't exactly look at the chaos era, which is far from done, and declare it ruined the game. A lot of very deep mechanics are getting touched and changed in a very complex system. Expecting a pure improvement immediately is completely unrealistic, since absolutely nothing can be done to fix all the game's flaws, make everyone happy and suddenly attractthousands of new players.
---
No because CCP will never provide that data. We have a lot of data and can draw reasonable conclusions from them but you and anyone else who supports these changes wont accept that. Total logged in players down, ships destroyed down, system jumps down, pve activity down, but CCP claims this has been the most active summer in history. It is not hard to say these changes are ruining the game when this is what we see in publicly provided information. Change for the sake of change is rarely a good thing, and refusing to admit when the change is actually making the game worse is a problem.
---
You can do as much as you can afford.
---
Previously some null blocks invited new players in, and gave them ships to PVP in free and welcomed them to fleets.
---
However, CCP has decided to make it extremely difficult for you to eek out a living in null sec. Invisible ships (most of the time) will destroy you in seconds in these areas because it is elite. You are encouraged by CCP and Reddit as a whole to run your begginer missions, career missions, then do regular missions in highsec.
---
How dare you guys make friends and skill into caps. Let's go back to sensor damping pl fighters in GE- and deep space interdiction!
---
Black out gives us more opportunity as nullbares like you leave ;)

Download a new overview.
---
Haven't left, just split between NS and WH space
---
RIP Sean. From one zoomie to another, fly safe o7
---
Were you expecting Artillery? The worst tracking weapons in the game. If they Wiz on a target and bump it, the drift would be enough to ruin their few shots. Blasters are the best up close alpha.
---
Is anyone surprised that Noraus broke yet another agreement? It's what he does. Now, the WC spin begins to somehow blame AOM for this so Noraus can justify it.
---
Nice. Ty for the history lesson, I appreciate it
---
You say the community is toxic
---
half the comments are flaming you for saying so
---
Good god this is sad, i love eve... But damn maybe this game truly does need to die to make the world a better place...
---
It's stagnant in terms of engagements and meaningful conflict or content drivers. It's not a dead area of space that needs to be revitalized, it's a post-scarcity nightmare of an economic model that needs to be checked
---
# #JesuisEVE
---
I said 'like you' not that you yourself. 
---
In seriousness though, I and a few other of the vets in the group do have experience in WH's so we aren't intimidated by no local. I know the context is different in NS, but its just something we will adapt to.
---
&gt; Nobody else seemed to have a problem with this at the time for reasons I don't fully understand, but it brought us back to the bad old days.
---
Not that it didn't bring us back to the bad old days but there weren't supercap mining ships you could buy in in an hour popping up supercaps and titans left and right
---
You can buy everything in game that you need to get back into a ship. If you want to spend real world dollars you can just buy a new ship every time you lose one. You can also earn in-game funds by doing things in-game if you don't want to spend real-world money. It comes down to how much you want to spend on a hull. You can fly really cheap ships, and you will lose them all the time. You can fly really expensive ships and lose them less often. No such thing as never losing ships, there is always a bigger fleet out there somewhere. Or sometimes your own fleet if they're feeling mischievous. Find a corp that does PVP and they'll work with you.  Have fun no matter what you do, look forward to seeing you on-grid.
---
If an alliance repeatedly defends someone else's space that another party is warring with it is reasonable for that party to see those defending the space as a strategic enemy.
---
Maybe of the people saying this are in huge alliances NOW, but in the past were in small alliances and either way LIKED the fact that there were a myriad of other player groups all through null in the past.
---
They are allowed to dislike the current meta which means that the only way to live in null and survive 40+lokis, or 256 bombers, or a dreadbomb, or whatever, is to fleet up with 255 other supers and FAXs.
---
Spoiler alert - the recent changes to null mechanics make it even more toxically impossible to not be in a mega-coalition, and null is going to be like 4 alliances tops by the end of the year.
---
While I hate skill-injectors, they do help new players rapidly catch up IF they choose to. Instead of injectors that can be abused by everyone, it would be nice if it were only for new players and limited.
---
That doesn't help the issue that a new player has no idea where to spend that SP. They need to add a way for players to dip their toe into advanced content and get a preview (time-limited) of what subcap brawls are like, exploration, WH battles, Capital skirmishes, mining, ratting, gas-huffing, etc
---
Then they could choose from a legit starter pack that puts them at a workable level of SP for that chosen field.
---
CCP needs to make money, and cosmetic items and PLEX are nice ways to go about that, imo. Injectors, not so much. They should not be a currency.
---
Making cosmetic items easier to see and show off, well, that would increase their profits and is at the heart of their woes, imo. A PVP vid that has views that constantly show the badass paint-jobs, the damage being inflicted and the SPLOSIONS... that would draw in streamers and their audiences.
---
I showed a guy at work an Eve PVP video, and it was just purple boxes and stuff floating around on a tactical grid. He wasn't impressed. I then found a video of the new explosion animations, armor damage, shields being hit... and he said that looked "bad ass, why doesn't the PVP look that way?"
---
Had to tell him, it does... just no one plays where you see that all the time. It would be a tactical disadvantage.
---
My idea (posted this before):
---
An output for streamers that shows combat how it is playing out with badass animations and the like.
---
On the streamers side of things, they see their tactical overlay and such.
---
Now you have a player playing how they want to play, but an output that is fun for the audience to view.
---
If this were a stock people invested in
---
They would have VERY different opinions on how “great” these changes are
---
Bias for their own benefit is a hell of a drug
---
We can Call it "Olmeca's Self Serving Ideas Killing Eve Slowly"
---
I see you drank the Kool-Aid already. Good luck, because Noraus just woke the sleeping dragon.
---
I have plenty of content, more content is always nice but here is a my sneaky ulterior motive: if they are busy posting smug stuff about fights they won and freighters they ganked they will spend less time posting whiney negative stuff that scares potential new players lurking here away from trying the game. 
---
Seriously though, i know there are some varying opinions in goons but it seems the majority in the group think the recent changes are going to end the game. If the game is ending and you're sure of it, do you really want to have the plug pulled while you have isk in your coffers that could have been used in a blaze of glory on the way out?
---
The guy straight up said keeping the blackout isnt contingent on the faucet situation but rather how players perceive it. Meaning there were other options, the blackout was just an easy fix. You keep saying everyone is hearing him wrong but please prove it. Give us a source.
---
Seed your systems. Even bling pirate frigs (or a semi-bling Nergal) costs like 2-300m. I spent 18B on a hel, which is uhh, 60 burner frigs.
---
Shit, this actually makes sense.
---
What's going on? I have Chinese friends on both sides.  I was born in the former Yugoslavia,  The Balkans are literally the land of fertile and...... **blood.**

We were all on the players side at the summit. You guys can tune down your flaming from flair baiting Reddit alts game.

You don't know the story of erotica1 and the bonus room?
---
Can WinterCo really aford to let Noraus keep making them more enemies?
---
See I think this is the problem right here, while I do think cynos needed looked at a bit the recent change was a bit heavy handed, it's really *what the cyno can bring* that needed looked at.
---
The thing is I think these chaos changes are band-aids that were simple to do while most of CCP was off for summer vacations or whatever.  Perhaps more involved solutions are in the works such as balancing supers/titans vs subs or a way to make local something between always on and WH style "delayed" local.  I think the indy cyno is a great example of showing that they are in band-aid mode, hell they didn't even change the icon color, it's literally a copy paste job from the previous hard cyno.
---
You didn't actually dispute what i said.
---
I also don't drink any koolaid, FRT is retarded just not for this particular reason.
---
To be quite honest being accused of koolaid guzzling by you is peak irony.
---
Please stop fooling yourself. Most of your playerbase is just waiting for cappings while krabbing and expecting content delivered straight into their mouth without even thinking harder than jump+lockF1 You need 10min to get tackle after ragepinging, because nobody wants to reship. If you call that pvp good luck man.
---
No. He just did the worst thing possible for FRT.
---
LOL!! Super-Umbrella is dead. LOLOL!!!
---
now this is spod racing
---
&gt; No, they want null to be the dangerous space it's supposed to be. 
---
no they don't - or they'd put more effort in to making it that way instead of flying cheap frigates.
---
Imagine being unable to handle disagreement with random strangers on the internet to the point where you have to resort to personal attacks, because someone is balancing your playstyle in an online game.
---
That's a fancy way of saying "no u". I really have to clarify this, because i'm not sure you have the mental capacity to understand otherwise.
---
P.S 1k gold and a bunch of upvotes in half a day says a lot of the players disagree with you and agree with me. Sorry buddy. Show us on the doll where CCP touched your rorqual on your way out.
---
Why You Mad Yo
---
The issue is about how logistical movement is done in larger groups, specifically when the "cyno fleets" do not involve a common voice chat. 
---
Combat fleets are going to be utilizing a single comms channel where your comment is valid.
---
But in many cases, a player is using an alt to light a cyno to make it more widely available to their gorup, while they may actually be active in another comms for another purpose.
---
FRT leadership has consistently shot themselves in the foot by breaking agreements. This time is no different. Welcome to a new enemy, in YOUR timezone as you're losing space in Detorid and can't even kill citadels in your home staging for months. Not very smart, my friend, but Noraus isn't known for his diplomatic genius.
---
&gt; WC would lunch serious of counterattacks
---
Damn I thought I was the one that had a serious lunch today.
---
i came to EVE in 2013 from SWTOR, brought 5 guys with me, after 2 months i was the only one left. Eve isn't a game with mass appeal, that "1 in 5 rule" for new bros sticking around still holds true today. You're not going to bring a huge influx of players without fundamentally changing the game, and if you change the game to that degree then the very thing which makes EVE actually playable(the community) is going to to leave. Honestly after 6 years i don't even like the game anymore i just log in because my corp is like my second family. 
---
this is a niche game and it will always remain a niche game because of the nature of EVE, the thing which drives new bros away is what keeps those who remain around.
---
Noone said otherwise, but i think you leave that impression with conclusions like 4&lt;1. You know my dude, those 4 rorqual accounts dont run on spod.
---
RIP Vile Rat :(
---
Imagine believing thats my only char
---
&gt;So you actually don't base it off anything got it.
---
I just told you what I had. There is not much outside of that to have.
---
&gt;No sources but demand I take it as something that happened
---
You are not asking because you are unsure of the truth. You are asking because you know it's unlikely someone would save something that happened 2-3 years ago for a moment like this. You are arguing in bad faith.
---
&gt;The cyno changes affect primarily nullsec and lowsec to some level. Cyno changes do not affect wormhole space or highsec.
---
If you couldn't use the cyno somewhere, there is no change. But wherever you could use one, these changes will likely have an impact.
---
&gt;You are projecting something here. Wormhole PVPers are the ones who care the most about killboard stats.
---
That makes no sense. Wormholers can't "sustain" zkb.
---
&gt;I don't think having a large group of people working together to defend each other is abusing mechanics, but it seems to be a problem for small groups.
---
Injecting caps and using those caps to farm to inject even more caps and then drop on everything is abusing the mechanics.
---
&gt;And there we have it, anyone who doesn't support this is a bot to you.
---
I have no reason to support thousands of bots.
---
&gt;You refuse to believe any player doesn't support these changes because they buff your play style.
---
They make the game more balanced. No idea why you think it's fine that caps should obsolete every other ship.
---
&gt;I am not saying they would be reasonable things, because I don't know any reasonable person who thought jump freighters needed to be nerfed but it literally just happened.
---
It's not bad for the game.
---
&gt;You contradict yourself in this own sentence.
---
No and the goal is balance.
---
&gt;The cyno restrictions are bad for the game but because they make your life easier to gank people, they must be good for the game.
---
Largest ships should be the fastest?
---
&gt;They aren't saying the previous status quo was fine, they are saying the path CCP is taking is worse for the game than doing nothing,
---
Of course they would. That's inseparable from saying the status quo was fine.
---
&gt;goon who is saying despite being one of the longest tenured CSM members
---
Huge surprise.
---
&gt;Maybe we should take it at face value and be concerned that he is sounding the alarm, something he has not done before.
---
Goons dislike this because it's bad for them. Never seen any genuine concern for the health of the game from a goon.
---
Do you know what's too strong?  
---
Triglavian ships.
---
I didn't say that....but thanks for trying to think for me.  Must be common in your circles.
---
No they are spending their effort to try and get ccp to understand these changes are bad. Goons have never wanted the game to die, even their infamous sentence started with "were not here to ruin the game." The entire point of this post was op asking people to remember everyone wants the game to succeed and to stop celebrating people leaving the game. Amusingly the people who needed to hear it the most doubled down and said the same to him.
---
Not to give him to big of an ego but it made me think if this meme:

---
combat pilots where? i only find cloaked bombers stalking procurers.
---
I'm not in FRT, lmao. You are correct that they are dumb to break agreements in the past but I don't really think you can compare this to their past deal breaking. As far as I can tell AOM has been assisting TAPI for weeks, this declaration seems to just be a formality.
---
You're not allowed to actually fight him with facts, it's not fair.
---
There's not much point in flying expensive ship (although a lot of people do) when you're going to get titan and supers dropped on your head. fun fun fun
---
yeah OK... your rhetoric precedes you
---
 This is EVE, backstabbing is part of the game. If they want to  backstab panfam, we can response it quickly.
---
I feel warm and fuzzy, thanks.
---
No one in Eve can trust Noraus, because he's literally broken every agreement he's ever signed.
---
delete jita
---
Their fault (not all, certain parts of the playerbase) is in being dishonest little hypocrites and pretending to care about the game health, while in reality they care about keeping their playstyle broken to the expense of everything else.
---
Sure, they can min-max all they want. But they shouldn't pretend to cry about "the little guy" or lack of meaningful things to do, when it's standard operating procedure for their entire bloc deny any chance of upheaval in the game world with the game mechanics given to them.
---
They were doing it before, and they'll keep trying to do it in the future despite CCP making it slightly more inconvenient for them. If no matter the game mechanics at play, they keep at it, then they sure do have a part in this.
---
What they don't realize is that the longer this cuts into CCP's pockets, the more they will be getting nerfed. It's a case of overusing a good thing (for yourself) and drawing too much attention to it. Well, don't expect it to last if that's the case.
---
&gt; fairy complex game
---
I mean, you are not wrong...
---
Yeah because what we need is rorq response fleets
---
lol.. typo, but yeah... maybe :-)
---
When it gets like that I cycle as soon as I have cap to turn them back on
---
Good for you!
---
Null sec will require engaging in politics to a degree. It will also require some sort of agreement with other local powers.
---
Types of agreements you might consider:
---
NIP: Non-Invasion Pact - agreement with other groups that fighting is OK, but attacks on sov &amp; structures is not allowed
---
Fight Club: Similar to a NIP, but includes provisions for the local groups to band together to fight against attacks from outside the region.  Kind of a mutual aid pact.
---
If there is a local superpower (meaning they can project supercapital forces into your space easily), you will have to develop a relationship with them.  It doesn't have to be blue status, but you will have to be able to discuss issues that arise and find ways to avoid being roflstomped.
---
300 mil
---
Maybe this whole post is a setup to gank code 🤔
---
Eve is best played on discord. Who even logs in anymore?
---
As you say; they will kill the easy targets if they can. So if this is to be remedied they can't be allowed to. I don't personally see a way of doing that, but I think criticizing the current system even though you participate in the system the way it currently exists is fine.
---
The big blobs shit on the small alliances because there is nothing else reasonable to do, but they could at the same time be aware that this kills the game and want it changed for the greater good no? It's preferable to starvation to work a soulcrushing job at McBurgertown but you can still want something else that is preferable to that.
---
1. They are not in check. And ofc, if people stop playing then faucets go down. Doesnt take a genius to realise it. But it does take a genius to explain why losing players is a good thing.
---
2. Which is a really really bad idea. What you are propsing is basically WHs. Which btw I hear are cranking out higher faucet numbers than NS now. Cant wait to see you go up against that cause faucets are bad right? But the reason its bad cause it concentrates wealth. You are just helping the multiboxers and fking over the "casual" players in NS. And I dont get why I have to repeat this but more players is better than less, thats something you cant explain away.
---
3. Yet again, not sustainable atm. Another thing Rise said. And no, you are not idiots, you are just incorrect. You think less is more and the funny thing is that we are in this situation simply because people couldnt find enough content.
---
4. You have literally no evidence of people leaving because of the macroeconomics, you just have a bunch of hearsay. And I can match that with my own hearsay so its just crap. Show me any actual proof and not just conjecture. And I would like to point out that you in this very setup are forgetting one crucial aspect, you dont know the long term effects of these changes either. So you can sit there and say shit was broken and people left (without proof) but you dont know how many will leave the game long term because of these new changes. And again, less players are bad for the game. If you were truly objective dude, you would stop after seeing how abysmal the data actually is. Like it becomes delusional at some point and you will continue with this until the game is dead and then you will blame the past and not the recent changes. Like wtf dude.
---
I agree, there were issues. But it didnt require drastic approaches. It just required specific changes. Which we are not seeing. Your comparison is bad, real world economics is massively different than in a game and tight measures only kick in when countries are on the brink of bankruptcy, we had far to go before that was even on the tables in this game. 
---
Nobody was forcing people to attack massive groups with supers, they chose that route and then bitched about it. And shit was dying in droves even before the cyno change.
---
Dont cry. Atm we have more Players than in 2005.
---
Yes, most groups worth anything will literally hand you ships to pvp in. If you die, oh well. If you live, give it back for the next fleet.
---
Yeah, it was just dreadful how so many of the enemies we'd previously crushed banded together (with funding from a confirmed RMT operation) to push us back into our ancestral homeland, where we became richer and more powerful then ever. Oh, the content! Just dreadful!
---
Gobbins should be looking for the knife now. It's coming.
---
Buy low Sell High means exactly that, but you're looking at it backwards. You don't want to be buying from sell orders, and you don't want to be selling to buy orders. 
---
Place a buy order at the low end (but higher than the other buy orders) and wait for impatient sellers to fulfill it. When someone quickly tries to sell something it'll go to the highest buy order in range.
---
Then when you have the item make a sell order at the high end (but lower than the other sell orders) and wait for impatient buyers to take it. When someone quickly tries to buy something it will come from the cheapest sell order in range.
---
OTOH pirate factions need more station and more l4 security agents. Guristas have like 2 systems in Venal with missions and Stain has like 5 security agents total with no epic arc to boost standings.
---
Is anyone besides a German software dev supposed to know what this actually is/does?
---
Sure thats reasonable. But they also had very clear lines before that. Aom participated in no offensive attacks against WC. AOM only assisted legacy in defending people around them. I mean its not perfect for WC sure. But if they think this option is better its their funeral. 
---
AOM to me exhibits professionalism and class. Their military is a growing power with strong and capable fc's. Noraus and Elo have tried to bully everyone they come into contact with. They have walked into another group that wont put up with their shit
---
Realistically, it'd be Mittani, but it's not for the same reason.

You should know damn well that isn't going to happen...
---
Here's an interesting question: how large is the sample size of either r/eve or the official forums? How many voices are they not hear except via wallet votes? Both sites could be chock full of hate for recent changes but only represent a single digit percentage of players.
---
I love the blackout. As someone who got his start in wspace and never got involved in nullsov, it makes null a much more compelling place to roam. I also appreciate the spirit of the new cyno changes, though I think it will need quick iteration to resolve the unintended consequences which I'm sure will arise. 
---
I remember the community reaction to wardec changes. People crowing about how it was going to save highsec and player retention and all the rest. A few of us got downvoted to oblivion for daring to challenge the group think and suggest that there were other, bigger problems affecting new players and that wardecs werent nearly as big a factor as ccp said. Retention numbers don't seem to have changed, which suggests wardecs didn't have the impact so many claimrd. I'd like to suggest that maybe we as a community aren't nearly as insightful on what the larger Eve player base needs/wants as we like to think.
---
&gt;player count is not the only important number
---
That number is actuallly completely worthless as it contains alpha accounts which you cannot realy count as players for obvious reasons. I for one don't understand whats all this fuzz about, ccp is fucking their own shit up. They are on a thin fuckin ice for several years now and iam quite sure they know. What i cant understand is why the fuck people still care when CCP clearly doesn't
---
AOM's leadership team won Serenity for a reason.
---
In raw numbers ,EvE probably lost way more accounts in the last 10 years. You know, during the transition to the whole "capital ships online" meta. But i don't see anybody acknowledging the elephant in the room.
---
Listening to the high level discourse around the game by management, it's clear that CCP is fully prepared to disperse a large portion of the long time player base in favour of retaining new players.
---
I for one welcome the purge. The universe of EVE deserves to be filled with people who appreciate its vast, sprawling beauty. Sci-fi fanatics, dreamers, people who are out to actually enjoy the experience.
---
Those people (I consider them the *real* EVE players – massive troves of ISK, l33t killboards and overflowing bitterness do not qualify you) will remain no matter what they do to cynos and locals…
---
What is it? I don't speak german
---
have you considered putting the same amount of effort in to attacking them, as they put in to defending their peers?
---
Stuff was smashed. Nc/pl got their shit pushed in. CCP put a stop to it with their drifter nonsense.
---
Because it is so easy for small groups these days to set up reactor structures for T2 material production...
---
This made me laugh so much i actually feel guilty.
---
I reflexively made a mental image of this and can't get it out of my mind. I will never be able to look at a screenshot/video capture from places like the meta show again, without imagining vibrating rods of spod integrated into the seats of the panelists below the camera level or behind the desks where we can't see them.
---
Hey, i totally agree with that. For example i love the kiki but think it needs a nerf. But i also personally know some goons that think Rorqs are fine and i know that at least one of them isn't a reddit lurker. (That's not to say that theres also ones i know that would agree that they're broken for one reason or another)
---
Some of them totally do, yes.
---
So let me get this straight. Your point is 1. People are enjoying other games more which has little to do with this game becoming worse? And 2. The classic release was timed around when the login events stopped which had masked the fall from the beginning has nothing to do with it?
---
So let me put it like this. More likely what happened was that players hated the changes right away and started leaving (like they said). The login event masked that and then classic got released and people are using it as an excuse for why people arent playing this game. You see the issue here. Blaming classic for people leaving cause this game too a shit is bad reasoning.
---
o&gt;
---
Omg it didn't post my description
---
Wishing you luck, having more small to medium sized alliances in the game is a good thing.
---
no. you meant "two sides of the same coin", which *is* a common saying
---
perhaps you combined it with the idea of "a doubled-edged sword" to arrive at this very silly thing which nobody says
---
They also leave because they're lazy and spoiled. Had to be said.
---
Agreed on all points btw. Having your product held hostage by a single part of the consumer base is something that needs fixing fast, even if it means losing part of the base in the process.
---
Why!!!!!  ffs us krabbers have a hard enough time with the blackout but now you kill your own rorqual fleets.........  fuck this fucking game
---
I talked to Vile Rat once during the FiX/BoB vs. Southern Coalition war.  He was extremely polite, espessuly when he told my small alliance to pound sand about getting blue.
---
RIP VileRat
---
Fucking Frat and their affinity to conflict. Someone should let them know EVE is dead and everyone should turtle up and krab until the heat death of the universe.
---
no. you probably meant "a doubled-edged sword", and then combined it with "two sides of the same coin" (these *are* common sayings) to arrive at this very silly thing which nobody says
---
Can't harvest my salt if I cancelled all nine of my accounts.
---
No, I am new to the game but heard a lot. Please give me a source about this dude or tell me the story.
---
What compromises are you willing to make?
---
give up hope all ye who try to convince CCP...
---
Here is the issue with this.  Player count sadly =! revenue.  Due to the F2P model in theory, there are a few 'whales' dropping 1k a month on all the cosmetics, plex, injectors etc.  It might be that ccp is 100% fine revenue wise.  We just don;t know.
---
I have faith that if they see stuff actually hurting long term they will make a change.  Unless CCP has an eve 2 in the works (not Echoes, which i think will be success) they won;t really let there cash cow die.
---
Yes, you totally can.
---
However, if you want to fly god ships with lots of bling performancy mods, you may not necessarily be in constant pvp.
---
If you stick to cheap stuff (especially when new) you can do a lot of pvp for very minimal dedicated ISK making, and potentially even make some money off loot.
---
But generally, you won't be able to 100% avoid needing to find funding. But you can make a bit of isk go a long way.
---
GUI translation:
---
Which ore are you mining?
---
How many lasers do you have?

Please enter the output of them:
---
Do you use drones?
---
How many drones do you have?
---
Please enter how much each outputs per 60 seconds:
---
CALCULATE!
---
Bottom box outputs the value of the ore you mined at jita.
---
This basically parses through fuzz works typeid datadump to find the id's of items, which it then puts into a request to the marketstat API
---
And this right here perfectly explains how these changes are not "hardcore" but actually mechanics to make PvP more casual. Cause in a true hardcore game nobody would dare enter bloc areas cause they would be shat at harder than they thought could happen.
---
Well done.
---
&gt;I just told you what I had. There is not much outside of that to have.
---
And I listed two things that actually are opposite of what you said
---
&gt;You are not asking because you are unsure of the truth. You are asking because you know it's unlikely someone would save something that happened 2-3 years ago for a moment like this. You are arguing in bad faith.
---
No I am arguing because we have always stood on that injectors were bad.
---
&gt;If you couldn't use the cyno somewhere, there is no change. But wherever you could use one, these changes will likely have an impact.
---
Then don't say they affect everyone. These are changes targeted at nullsec.
---
&gt;That makes no sense. Wormholers can't "sustain" zkb.
---
What does this even mean? In the end you and I can both claim the other side cares more about zKB and neither of us will be right.
---
&gt;Injecting caps and using those caps to farm to inject even more caps and then drop on everything is abusing the mechanics.
---
Which of those is the abuse of mechanics, I would argue the injectors it he problem much less than dropping caps, and interestingly it was the dropping caps they nerfed. If you come to someones house don't be surprised when they use everything to get rid of you.
---
&gt;&gt;And there we have it, anyone who doesn't support this is a bot to you.
---
&gt;I have no reason to support thousands of bots.
---
Which I didn't say, but you are implying that anyone who doesn't support this is a bot which is disingenuous at best.
---
&gt;They make the game more balanced. No idea why you think it's fine that caps should obsolete every other ship.
---
They don't actually fix the issue. Supers and titans are still amazing against subcaps, they are just harder to get on the field.
---
&gt;It's not bad for the game.
---
So anything that doesn't hurt you isn't bad for the game.
---
&gt;No and the goal is balance.
---
If that is what you meant that is not what you said, you said you want balance that hurts nullsec.
---
&gt;Largest ships should be the fastest?
---
Large ships that have specialty drives that allow them to move across space? But in any other aspect they are slower. I mean how do you even define fastest? I can get a pod from north to south of eve significantly faster than I can a capital ship
---
&gt;&gt;They aren't saying the previous status quo was fine, they are saying the path CCP is taking is worse for the game than doing nothing,
---
&gt;Of course they would. That's inseparable from saying the status quo was fine.
---
Those are two different things, but that doesn't support your narrative
---
&gt;&gt;Maybe we should take it at face value and be concerned that he is sounding the alarm, something he has not done before.
---
&gt;Goons dislike this because it's bad for them. Never seen any genuine concern for the health of the game from a goon.
---
As proved by the MER these changes have barely affected goons. You can't separate your bias from facts and will literally support any change that sticks it to goons and nullsec as a whole.
---
This just in: Small alliance excitement over prospect of Null. Will they survive, or succumb to eviction? From whom will they be demanded tribute from? Local Councilmembers consider rent control policies. More at 11.
---
Never knew you in-game or out,
---
But it's amazing to know this community remembers.
---
One vet to another, o7
---
it calculates m³/time for a given ore (I don't know for sure and I am German)  
---
For the next version OP: Implement EVE Auth and get the data from the current fitting :)
---
I get that, but doesn't there being a glut of minerals and isk lower the price of goods? So you're worried about selling stuff? I mean that sucks for you but yea I kinda expect a part time miner/indy guy isn't going to be raking in dough.
---
lol AOM was showing up to defend legacy structures in Detroit. Literally the only difference between now and a few days ago is no ones pretending that deal was still in existence.
---
And besides, most of Winter Co's Chinese players were the ones who got blobbed out of the game in Serenity by PIBC anyways, so anyone pretending there was ever a chance of them getting along is kidding themselves.
---
amazingly interesting podcast btw
---
&gt; they want it to be harder to earn isk, and acquire minerals.
---
This isn't actually the argument being made.
---
Fucking Karen.
---
People used to do freighter convoys
---
It's a mining Calculator for the value of ore mined in at hour at jita
---
A newer player could do reasonably well grabbing the leftovers in busier systems.
---
....Do you honestly believe the super blob response fleet takes a lot of effort?
---
It takes more effort for an alpha heron to scan a system of signatures.
---
Nothing wrong with a good ole Roid-Bee :)
---
No, you will sit on your spod rock and enjoy it!
---
Hey its up to the mods to ignore what's been going on for years here.  The backhanded compliment I gave is the only one you will receive.
---
How about new probes, call them salvage probes. Maybe move relic sites over to use them as well? Spit balling here.
---
My main question as a guy who just returned: How do I get rid of this unprecise piece of crap-code? It often still shows the bar loading up when I already land at my destination :D
---
People may dislike this comment, but you could argue that what Vile rat did in terms of bringing diplo to a higher level has been to the detriment of the game in terms of content and conflicts
---
I think using python is insane but besides that i don't see an issue with this
---
True, though for some reason everyone aspires to have a result that is the opposite of what they achieved on Serenity.
---
I mean, there's a reason "winning Eve" is a euphemism for quitting. If you've truly won the game isn't worth playing.
---
i'm sure it does.
---
Can never downvote this enough.
---
Well, how much effort is it to move a Rokh to staging? And why should moving a larger ship be less effort?
---
I don't think the cyno change is the ideal one - I've been arguing for a while for cyno spoolups and for inhibs to be much easier and cheaper to use, to prevent arbitrary capital drops, and that wouldn't really affect logistics.
---
But I do think people have an unreasonable sense of entitlement about the ability to move capital fleets across the cluster quickly and cheaply. You can't move a BS or BC fleet as fast as a capital fleet, and that doesn't really make sense.
---
Looks like pants are coming down next?
---
How about fuck off and stop posting?
---
A lot of people concerned about changes that seem to be tanking the game?  Better make a very low effort shitpost about it.
---
Have you ever seen the in the same room?
---
Cool, did you have fun?
---
FRTs demise was a matter of time given the numeral disparity, short of goons leaving TAPI out to dry the only question was how long it would take.
---
It's one of my favorite shows. Very in depth into things people deal with but never notice.
---
Ha! Why do you say that?
---
All right, Professor Padendic. Calm your tits. We are all immensely impressed by your mastery of the English language. Don't worry.
---
Given that it is my third language, I think I can be forgiven for mixing up some metaphors. My meaning was clear enough despite that.
---
No way.
---
I haven't had that issue before, that seems crazy.
---
Definitely screenshot and bug report it.
---
Good suggestion.
---
It's so nice that nullblobs are finally waking up to the fact that there are a variety of playstyles in Eve and it shouldn't just cater to one! No doubt, then, you support recent changes that make it possible to enjoy things other than umbrella-backed null farming?
---
Good.
---
Wormholers BTW
---
For anyone winning eve: can I have your stuff?
---
Don't ruin my innocence!!!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/21m7g1/erotica_1_permabanned_from_eve/
---
that's probably harder than doing it in null sec
---
This thread may already be done, but since you're trying to go for PVP with some income to back it up, I'd like to bring up tenacity. You don't always need to hold sov to live in space - look at Simple Farmers as an example. They play the tenacity metagame very well. In the current situation that means two things: spamming astras with intolerable time zones, and harassing and attacking whenever the power players' backs are turned. The astras entrench them by virtue of being atrociously grindy to kill (be thinking dozens of astras, staggered through shitty time zones ) and their skill at camping and hunting lets them catch some expensive kills. 
---
You won't be able to rorq mine the moons at first if you're going for the "fuck you we live here and there's nothing you can do" approach, nor necessarily plant sov flags. But even though there are more diplomatic approaches to taking sov, you'll never hold it long if you and your alliance aren't mentally prepared to be annoyingly tenacious, and tenaciously annoying to anyone that wants to dislodge you.
---
Most of your playerbase is doing the same thing. Joining other people's fleets to be led on safaris, the main difference in needing to sometimes also cloak on top of jumping and pushing F1. 
---
Eve is a game where a small number of people enable gameplay for a much larger number. This is true just as true outside of sov holders as inside it.
---
I'm going to ignore the vitriol and invalid assumptions that anyone playing the game differently from you is wrong.
---
Looks like they could use some help.
---
Almost like the last entity controlling Insmother, when they needed FRT but they turned their backs instead.
---
One could say, life is an echo. What you send out comes back. What you sow, you reap.
---
You sure seem to be posting in every thread about how much you dont care.
---
I tell you, thats a lot of not caring.
---
Such an underrated comment. 10/10.
---
Krabs do not provide content if they have such perfect information about hunters that they can be docked up before they can become content. That's why blackout is good for the game, and any krab that quits because they aren't 100% safe any more wasn't adding anything of value.
---
Or not so slowly
---
Yes! You can do amazing pvp. Get a T3C with nullification and covert recon, get in null, and pvp some barges!!!!
---
I'm not sure you can call defending offensive structures "participated in no offensive attacks".  
---
And frankly, with some of the people pulling the strings for the Mangos we might all be in for some very.... interesting surprises.
---
Yeah I guess it's not much different really. I'll delete it.
---
tl;dr who's Mango?
---
Oh come on, there will still be at least a hundred jita bots posting scams
---
&gt; There is always a risk
---
With local, if you are watching the screen at all, and there is a friendly Upwell structure in system, there is absolutely no risk if you're not in a site with scrams (which no anomaly has). You can 100% guarantee safety by clicking 'Warp To' when someone comes into local.
---
The game needs krabs, sure. But they should be doing something active (and fun), not something AFK and expect to be saved by a free intel mechanic. The rewards for that PVE can also be better if there is a higher risk.
---
Ha ha I've docked my super am not turbo ratting anymore, I've no more free Intel at my finger tips. That's a good compromise.
---
Literally the problem with all static PvE; once it is solved it gets farmed for all it is worth.
---
What, I can't even sneeze?
---
Can you be the next one to quit, please?
---
great advice, way to make the community better bro. I am very positive person and I post a lot of great advice here for changes and help new bros.    
---
Too many people on r/eve  need to stop whining and posting offline numbers daily
---
Congrats! Setting goals and expectations for your crew is extremely important: as long as your members go into it looking for a challenge and fun and won't get fussy if things go south and you get kicked out, you really can't lose. The worst-case scenario is that it was an awesome deployment and you got a few wins over (\_\_\_\_\_) group, and you can go back to whatever you were doing until the next opportunity presents itself.
---
Now's as good a time as ever to take the plunge, though. Blackout has ADMs down everywhere, and 40 ACTIVE people can do a ton. This is especially true if they're mainly in a single time zone, where that count can be plenty to hold off all but the largest alliances. The largest groups probably won't care much about you anyway, at least not initially - they're too worried about keeping Rorquals safe. Many groups that look scary on paper but that have their greatest strength in other timezones other than your own are easy to harass and even beat up on in your strongest timezone, so keep an eye out for those opportunities when picking a home. Being off-tz from your largest neighbor also makes it easier to keep up ADMs and defend when you inevitably annoy them enough to test you.
---
It's very much worth thinking about NOT doing diplo outreach "up the food chain" first, actually - especially when dealing with larger organizations, you'll be in a stronger position to negotiate if you win a few of your own battles first. If you have a few similarly-sized peers who are situationally friendly and can come to your aid in crucial times, though, that's very helpful.
---
Best of luck!
---
Blackout on a certain lvl is good as it does make for some good pvp.  But with the number of people you have it could prove tough also.  For example when a 20 person gangs comes through how many of the 40 guys you have will be online.  How often do people roam that space.   Does it have the ability to become a destination stop for guys who are looking to kill things.    
---
How is the alliance going to make isk is the next question.   SRP and structures and tcus and Ihubs are spendy.     There will be days you lose 20b plus.   Also those are morale killing days.
---
flare checks out
---
Kiki and leshak, definitely, and maybe vedmak. And ikitursa and nergal. The problem is they don't have the usual weapon tradeoffs around fitting, or around range versus tracking versus DPS - they get all the benefits of all options of weapons systems.
---
I assume you're scanning down holes in high sec? Where exactly? What's the census/jump count in these systems? How far from Jita?
---
If the answers are "close to a hub" and "in a place where lots of people pass through," try finding someplace more isolated. A nice high sec island might be a lot better.
---
he was part of american aggression against foreign nations. He lived if he wasn't there..
---
I wasn't serious, I stopped playing myself a while ago, although I might look back into it. Last I played, WH ratting and gas puffing was very profitable.
---
The indy cyno is to me an example of bad game design.
---
Good game design involves a small number of parts producing a complex interesting outcome. A good example of this would be POS stront timing mechanics. 
---
Bad game design involves having to add exceptions and additional rules to make up for flaws in the design, where an unnecessarily large number of parts produces a simple boring outcome.
---
The fact that they came up with a design which then requires these additional exceptions to not break key parts of the game. Even with those warts, they fail to remedy the problem. This is a sign that the underlying design is bad.
---
AOM has never showed up to defend any structures in Detroit.
---
There were still unopposable supercapital blobs. The change the rorquals made was to to put these in the hands of everyone instead of just the old money in Eve.
---
Balance based on something being rare is not balance, it is power fantasy.
---
Right in the feels :''((((((
---
when AOM started to move over noraus used Chinese nationalism to try and get them on their side but i dont think he realizes that if they go to WC then they will be seen as FRT pets and on Chinese server AOM legit owns the place so yeah noraus u done fucked up
---
Don't worry, I logged out. Done playing for the moment.
---
If you've talked to the locals then I recommend seeing how they feel about a relationship *after* you've taken the space. Will they be blue or just have a Non-Invasion Pact? That sort of thing. A NIP is fun for content but can be hard on your ADM raisers. 
---
Also might want to investigate who you are taking the space from. Are they absent? Are they absent *for now*? Are they there and smaller than you, but may have friends? That sort of thing.
---
How many people can you get in fleet? With this in mind, *you will need fleet comps*. Kitchen sink is fun for roams and response fleets, but if someone is threatening your sov what will you do?
---
Instead of doing something useful, all you doom and gloom people are contributing are a bunch of low effort shitposts gloating about how the game is dying. The only thing that accomplishes is scaring off potential new players and encouraging existing ones to give up. Frankly, this poster is worth 50 of you motherfuckers. You're actively hurting the game, not helping. 
---
Get. The. Fuck. Out.
---
Yeah that's basically my point
---
Yeah which is why their fleets keep showing up in Detroit during timers huh. BTW whens the next RNK video about PIBC and their 300 titans killing 30 supers in Serenity dropping?
---
Imagine dying to Ron, the most boomer man to ever live.
---
but muh both sides
---
Have listened to it for ages - one of the best podcasts out there imo
---
Corporate probably only really cares if they lose 1/2 of the 'paying' customers... the alphas are really only valuable as 'content', and maybe to eventually become omega or bring friends who become omega... otherewise every alpha is just costing them more $$$ for servers and everything else...
---
Reddit is one corner of the player base that should have its views represented for the minority that it is. That doesn't mean it should be abandoned by CCP and Falcon as a community manager, and ideas here disregarded.
---
&gt; but /r/eve, come on, we are better than this.
---
Nice try, but just look at the response.
---
Aside from bumping into a collidable, everything in regards to warp alignment time is calculable right? I really don't understand how this timer bar could be anything but accurate. Like, someone went out of their way to make it unhelpful.
---
Detroit is more dangerous than Eve
---
Eh, learning (at least for me) is easier with a project. :D
---
And that's not a bad project.
---
The truth hurts , and the truth is that the game is still horseshit - i had some thrills during nullsec blackout , but this does not fix much, it's just another one of those cheap CCP "diversionions", that I've been seeing from 2009 - just let it die .
---
P.S. Can we roll back to 2013 ?!
---
It's the sum of the argument, kind of the elephant in the room. Do you think CCP would ever want to pressure people to purchase plex with real money rather than making isk to be self sufficient and not need to ever pay them real money? Of course they want to make that harder and sell more PLEX.
---
 If they don't, they shouldnt be in business anymore.
---
Ouch. I bad posted. Sorry.
---
I should not try to write answers about mechanics while sitting on the crapper and looking at my phone.
---
It warms my heart
---
Maybe they are trying to make it harder on purpose. Why would they do that though?
---
Well, the absence of actual supply lines to attack and interdict has been one of the primary causes for not being able to replicate modern, real world military tactics and strategies in EvE. Which is bad, because something like that would lead to a lot more variety in how alliances fight each other, and encourage people to spread out instead of fighting on a single citadel grid most of the time.
---
When everything is jumped in, we end up with a case of "medieval siege in space", because in the majority of cases you can't kill stuff en route. You have to try and kill stuff on an undock, otherwise they are safely entrenched and defended in a citadel. At which point, they are pretty much invulnerable due to asset safety, until they get taken out to be used and put at risk again.
---
Making logistics harder sure is a chore initially. On the other hand, it could lead to a more interesting meta, where we could actually use more varied tactics and strategies. For example, why siege a citadel if you can roam with kitchen-sink subcap fleets, catch and kill their stuff en route? This would lead to a more interesting case of "blitzkrieg in space", with smaller, highly mobile squads running around trying to kill stuff before they can arrive to reinforce the enemy.
---
This is not really a new thing by the way, people used to do freighter convoys with escorts back in the day, and their enemies would try to attack it. The problem was that it was too slow.
---
So i was thinking if maybe it would be better to nerf teleporting logistics and balance it out by making freighters into proper ships. You know, add PG/CPU, medium, high and rig slots so they can fit properly, use cloak/mwd,etc, and give them an agility and warp speed increase (eg, imagine if they had battleship align times and warp speeds). Boost t2 haulers as well so they remain faster and more survivable/slippery than freighters at the cost of smaller cargo space and you'd have a lot more options to move stuff around with a bit of escort and scouts, without having to rely on cynoing everything in. At that point, maybe JFs could even be changed in role completely, from jump capable ships into tech2 freighters with better tank and faster travel.
---
The whole point would be to make people actually travel the routes and be vulnerable to interception, but without making it a complete pain in the ass to actually fly the route at 1.4 Au/sec and half a minute to align between gates. Heck, you could even rig them to be faster.
---
This makes sense and is a good idea, and I have actually wondered about this myself.
---
This one got it right !
---
You have my downvote
---
Actually AOM's fleet barely showed up in Detroit at all. 
---
Maybe do some investigations before you lie on Reddit. :P
---

Ah. We had like 10 falcons chasing after you, but your fleet disappeared a couple of minutes after it was reported. Was confused on what you'd come in for.
---
Latest migration wave from Serenity, where they fought FRT. Guess what they are doing now.
---
An old meme retooled to say "harden the fuck up'" is a lot more useful than people voicing concerns about changes that we predict will be shit and hurt the game **and** coincidentally login numbers are dropping at the same time, but you're right... we should make meme shitposts of a tired meme and tell people to suck it up and smile.  
---
Thanks for straightening me out. 
---
Or you can fuck off and stop posting too.
---
"Markets are gonna be struggling in a month"
---
nah.  fewer players and fewer wars means shit doesn't need to be shipped.
---
He was an IT tech for the diplomatic service, not some soldier fighting. Take your comment and fuck off out of here
---
It because of 2 things I think.
---
1. It's a linear bar that represents a non-linear process. Acceleration and alignment doesn't generally seem to be a perfect linear process, but this line processes it as if it is.
---
2. It measures from 0m/s to warp speed aligned, even if it is activated when already traveling at an angle, with a heavy weight towards speed. So if you are undocking a freighter and hit warp, it jumps almost immediately to 75%+ and then takes ages to get the rest because of the aligning.
---
So the solution would be to have it better calculate the actual delta v to be aligned with current velocity as the start, and target as the end, and then to front load this to make it appear as if you are accelerating into warp/spooling up the warp drives.
---
I care that we have to wade through countless shitty posts to find good shitposts
---
True hardcore is cramming your hull into every hole you find and scanning out whatever system it takes you to, big bloc null or virgin C1.  The chain needs to be mapped, and content is there to be found.  
---
You must be looking for one-dimensional composite fleet fights then, and you either don't have the size or the creativity to compete so it's left you sour, whereas the content I find dictates how and what I choose to fly.
---
Problem with that logic is that they still need people to buy the plex for isk.
---
It's a mechanism that works together. I'd wager that plex sales don't actually fluctuate with the difficulty of earning ISK.
---
It's more that plex price is a function of ISK earn rates, but that doesn't too dramatically influence plex sales.
---
So because you were God's unholy mushroom stamp gratefully received to that alliance you felt useless? You thpught you could effortlessly slide into a pre-arranged system and just fill the black void that they were somehow existing in spite of but absolutely needed? You thought 11 million SP was some how relevant?
---
Yeah in like 2005
---
Try doing one today and tell me how it goes
---
Its just too down to earth to be real. Either that or I have become cynical
---
who fucking cares if he was a soldier or someone who assisted him?! Its the same crew.
---
Absolutely. Replacing ships goes from 10 minutes of work all the way up to 1000 hours of playtime (practically). And anywhere in between. It just depends on what scale of PVP you are doing, and how efficiently you're funding that PVP.
---
Flying a frigate or destroyer in novice complexes in Faction warfare is really fun, the mechanics keep fights somewhat balanced, and if you chose to, you can make money doing it too. And this is some of the most accessible PVP in the game, day one you could easily lose your first ship and start improving. Basically you can fight for an NPC empire and when you succeed you can call in favors to receive upgraded equipment and ships. 
---
Cruisers are the go to ships in all areas of space for many applications. They can cost between a half hour of work to 30 or more hours of work, depending on how advanced and how expensive you fit them. Want to kill a fleet of frigates? Take some friends in Caracal class cruisers and mess them up. Wanna put down a space station, upgrade to some heavy assault cruisers. Wanna heal friends, use a logistics cruiser. Wanna shut down industrial activity in 4 systems, grab a Cloaky Loki. And finally, wanna help your friends get their massive capital ships into a fight? Yeah, that is a recon cruisers job.
---
Battlecruisers and battleships are slow, but they are powerful, medium to long range damage platforms, with solid tank compaired with cruisers. They can take between 2 and 5 hours to make back, but they form the basis of many strategic doctrines, they are powerful if vulnerable in a small gang context, and these are the badass ships that can still (ocassionally) partake in the long lost art of brawling an entire enemy fleet. 
---
Then capital ships. The behemoths of the Battlefield that separate alliances and coalitions. At 50 mil isk/hour, they could take between 25 and 50 hours to make back. But they are powerful, tanky, and invaluable for the defense of even small lowsec and nullsec alliances these days. Supercapitals are the same... just super sized with supersized times to replace.
---
Pvp comes at all scales, with as many or as few friends as you want, and with as much or as little money as you want to invest. Each kill you get will cost the enemy money, and each loss stings a little or alot. Each kill requires that you do many things right or that the enemy makes many mistakes. Eve is a huge web of hard and soft counters, a game of bets and intelligence, numbers and experience. But that all makes this the most satisfying and complex PVP game out there.
---
I write progress bars that increment linearly with the fraction of the task completed. I'm Doing It Wrong?
---
Yes I'm the type of player he's talking about. Have I benefited disproportionately? I'm not sure I have, a rorq makes roughly 110m/hour which is less than a higher sec mission runner, high sec incursion runner, a t4/5 abyssal runner or virtually any form of wormholer from c3s up.
---
I've trained my rorq characters to fly hawks/harpies so i can triple box t5 abyssals in high sec which would increase my isk/hour considerably from what i was making pre-blackout and cyno changes, but is that really what the game needs; everyone flocking to high sec?
---
Also - if you try to repackaged damaged items, it should popup asking if you'd like to repair and repackage them instead of losing all items you focused / selected
---
Try protecting your freighter now. You realize they don't exactly have to engage your support fleet to kill your freighter, right? It's like people bring up this anecdotal, outdated shit without thinking and assume it makes a good point.
---
Fly safe good sir.  o7
---
I think you over complicate it. If someone is playing, and they refuse to risk a super or a carrier, or a rorqual, they need an income to continue replacing ships etc. We talk about ratting etc. Nobody in this game save for a total try hard will be out in a drake, or a myrmidon grinding rats for days and days to make enough isk to buy one ship. They will buy plex so they can enjoy the game instead of work at their evening job.
---
"barely showed up in Detroit at all" ain't the same thing as never showed up to defend anything, and therein lies why this post is a thing.
---
Eve hasnt grown in playernumbers for more than 5 years now...
---
I am sure that will happen again as soon as we stop posting...
---
We didn't want you anyway
---
You can do a lot of fun pvp very early on in frigates, which are the smallest ship class in the game. They are also the cheapest (some of them are specialized and expensive, but by the time your character has the skills to fly those, you will also be better at making money).
---
Ignore the drama from seasoned players that belong to established "empires" in the game, jump right in and search for the groups that do public fleets that anyone can join. They often use cheap ships and some of them are "training wheels" fleets that will help teach you the basics. Look up Spectre Fleet and Redemption Roams. They have their own chat channels and mailing lists, so you will be notified in advance whenever a fleet is available to join.
---
I think that Redemption Roams does a new player training fleet once a month, in addition to their other activities, so it's a good place to start if you want to learn the basics (fleet movement, basics commands and how to execute them, etc). I joined one of them for fun when i returned to the game and their FC just took everybody out, explained one thing at a time and had everyone practice it before actually heading out. I had some really new players flying with me at the time (one guys was playing less than a couple of weeks) that didn't know a thing, and they were roaming into nullsec shooting stuff after 15-20 minutes.
---
Once you do a couple of group activities like these and know the basics, you can then try to go solo hunting if that's your thing, or just team up with a few like-minded players and form your own little group. This is more skill intensive than following someone else's commands in a bigger fleet, but it's also much more challenging, satisfying and will make you a much better pilot overall.
---
Frigates are kind of unforgiving in the beginning when you don't know much because if you screw up and get hit, you can get killed very fast. However, it's one of the most fun things to do without breaking the bank and it will teach you how to be a good pilot before sitting into bigger ships. Big ships may make headlines in gaming websites, but it's the small ships that make competent pilots. Have fun.
---
Thanks for the reality check!
---
I figured I was playing a game with other people, and by them checking my API and asking what I do, that I'd be doing that role.
---
I guess it was through my supreme arrogance that I didn't know they just wanted another VNI or procurer in system, and that I should have trained those skills instead.
---
While we are on the topic, can we get it to work for aligning as well? It would be SO much more useful to know when you are aligned vs when you are in warp.
---
Alright. That's fair. Best of luck!
---
You can do the burner Talos mission with a Jackdaw bud
---
You're not doing it as poorly as possible, just in a manner that can be improved.
---
But also, how are you calculating a fraction of a task completed? Is there chances for 1 fraction to take longer than an equal-sized fraction? Like if it is lines of code, not every line will take equal time to complete. 
---
But really, give the podcast a listen. They found certain progress bar designs/behaviors can actually increase user satisfaction BEYOND that of simply having the results immediately with zero wait.
---
Also though, it's generally not a totally meaningful thing, depending on application.
---
If the thing is like a 20 minute wait regardless, just make sure it doesn't ever hang at 99%. If it's something users will generally actually sit through (like a flight search, or a warp drive progress bar) the front-loading can significantly reduce user frustration at needing to wait.
---
Use FILTERXML(WEBSERVICE())
---
Anyway, ignore Dave Stark, he's an idiot that wants Eve to die because they made his (and my) overpowered playstyle less profitable and in some ways less enjoyable (but it's more fun in other ways now too). He desperately wants to be the self fulfilling prophet that "foretold" the death of the game by toxically driving anyone interested away. Recent changes to the game dont impact FW lowsec or highsec much at all.

It's not only rorquals but the ability to inject into rorquals and the supercaps they produce.
---
Just play elite dangerous? That game is basically what you describe turning eve into...
---
It would shock you but a lot of the people that used to small gang or i known from small gang pvp now ping for playing other games rather then eve.
---
Why, you don't like FaCtS?!?!?!
---
Yes, you are a true asset to this community telling people to fuck off.  This subreddit is better because of you
---
not as a whole
---
Yes, but also, plex value will reduce to the new ISK earn rates, providing less value to the cash payment.
---
So I don't think it would be so simple to say that reducing isk flows will increase plex sales.
---
One reason why this may not happen is the length of time for the query. 
---
A query against the database doesn't take too long on its own, but it is one of the more costly transactions you can perform in software (behind things like network calls). If you have ever run a search for a common name and see how long it takes, you may start to understand why they may not want to hit too many queries at a time. 
---
To show a list of all your items, it just pulls that. If you want to rule out a ship or other container, then you must also query _inside_ the container (in this instance, a ship is just a fancy container). Given that CCP has no idea how many containers may be part of this process, then do you really want to add N additionall queries? (Where N is the number of containers in the pilots inventory)
---
It is much more efficient, and functional to simply show you a list. You can control-a and repair item, which starts the process described above, but now it is done manually. 
---
I am not 100% sure this is the reason, but it is one example of how something may seem simple, because you can describe it simply, but may not be so simple to actually implement. 
---
Thank you for listening to my TED Talk.
---
Find what you like and do it weather you play in the sand or kick it in the face of others have fun.
---
That would be pretty nice.
---
This is very scientific and obviously reliable.
---
Elite is just a flight sim, it really doesn't have the depth that eve does. But yes, basically merging the flight side of elite with everything else that eve has to offer.
---
I lol’d
---
no, alex jones is bill hicks ;)
---
The difference between krabbing in nullsec and highsec is that huffing spod or crushing anoms requires virtually no user input, so you can multibox really easily. Make ISK to inject new accounts to make more ISK. It's a virtually limitless positive feedback loop because you only barely need to pay attention to your rorquals, just watch Netflix or play Dota while you make your 110m/hr. Meanwhile, someone running abyssals or L4s is limited in their krabbing because of how much attention is required.

---
Honestly, I'm down. Fuck the rest of it and fuck the narratives. Legacy, Imperium, AOM and anyone else that wants to get on this train saddle up and skullfuck the galaxy. Make everyone else quit Eve and then quit themselves. Ram this shithole right into its well earned slot alongside other stellar game titles like Two Worlds.
---
Sure
---
Buy Plex sell plex for isk
---
finally, we'll know all the bots have quit
---
Because blackout startet like 3 days ago?
---
Interesting.  Thanks.  I didn't see anything about that on the github page so it wasn't clear what those were for.  It's too bad that there is that time limit on it also as then it ends up being a weird UI effect that doesn't do anything later on.
---
Mangos !
---
Imagine pseudointellectual think posting on a video game subreddit
---
Join a pvp Corp and literally undock. It’s the main catalyst to pvp, being out in space in a ship. Go do something that interest you. You can mine till someone comes along to crash your party and boom, you have pvp. Get into a frigate and roam lowsec and you will run into a fight. Find a Corp that has a small group you can fly with and are helpful. When isk becomes an issue try FW, high sec missions, or heck if you are brave wormholes. Eve is vast and has endless opportunities for you to pvp, don’t listen to the grumpy cap pilots that never learned to undock something smaller than a carrier and fly it on their own.
---
Absolutely. I would recommend faction warfare to cut your teeth.
---
So nc. Is now a normal standard alliance then?
---
Eve not being a flight sim is exactly why I love it, submarines in space! If they did change the physics of how we fly I would quit playing, I am not here for ace combat style dogfights
---
Coming from the guy who suggests hardening the fuck up... kk
---
Barely means there is only once one of our corp showed up and we kicked them right there.
---
Lying is excatly you are doing now, and you are really bad at it tbh.
---
HTFU
---
Actually, you are arrogant to think that. You're being recruited as a cog. At most, they just want another F1 monkey. It's up to you to prove you are anything more. I don't know the exact time frame where you joined this fledgling nullsec alliance, but nowadays from the small to the tall that's the role we sign on for. Anything else without substantial proof otherwise is suffering from severe self-delusion. If you wanted to be a major industrial power within your **ALLIANCE** then you should have established your own logistic chains, undercut your competitors, out-mined everyone else, and established max efficiency production lines. Alliances don't need random outsiders to take over entire facets of their Empire. They need soldiers and laborers. Anything more must be earned.
---
Seems like it tbh I think NC. Has always been normal it just depends on what side of the war you're on tbh and the narrative you hear
---
Checks out with the current standards of data analysis being posted on Reddit nowadays
---
Rest in peace Vile Rat
---
I am with you 100%.  The reason I'm upset is because this change solves very few problems, if any.  It instead brings with it massive and unnecessary inconveniences.  Smart rorquals are going to mine with multiple recons on standby.  That moa on the gate could still be bait with a cloaked cyno nearby.  Better inhibs or spoolup times would be massively better and wouldn't get a complaint from me.  I'm not mad because "but muh caps".  I'm mad because I've been massively inconvenienced and yet the terribly broken status quo remains almost completely unchanged.
---
Are you one of those grumpy old men?
---
I’m new to the game, never met or heard of this guy. Barely have time to help my Corp out with school work, but this guy sounds incredible. I’m sorry for everyone’s loss who knew him, he sounded like an incredible man, and it helps to remind of the incredible community and intricacies of this game, the stories it produces and the people it brings together. 
---
Rest In Peace Vile Rat, gone but not forgotten.
---
Yeah... and sometimes I’ve even seen them use drones, and wrecks, he’ll even cans to decloak ships :O

Underrated comment

Don't question science!

its a song.. produced by CCP and performed by Permaband.  You should look it up sometime.  Its a great song.

---
Also. No you can't have my stuff, nor my isk.  
---
It shall sit and rot until the inevitable death of the game in a year or so's time.
---
bruh, mangos have brought muninn fleets in detorid  before
---
Your feedback is appreciated as always querns bb
---
And quite inline with the POTUS standard, as well.
---
Blame people for changing behaviour when the environment changes. Why are so many people adapting to the new normal?!
---
So you're saying that AOM was in fact active in detroit, kicked corp or otherwise, and was fighting against frat despite your deal that allowed you logistics through their space, but frat shouldn't consider their deal cut with aom during peacetime void when aom is aiding the people attacking frat? Why do I get the feeling I'm going to here "nerf diplomacy" at some point in this chain?
---
I don't think that's the only remedy, actually. I do think that the sense that 
---
&gt;there is nothing else reasonable to do
---
is part of the problem. How do we address that particular issue? 
---
Maybe it needs to be reasonable for the big null sec groups to fight each other again. Or maybe it doesn't need to be reasonable, but it needs to be profit or scarcity driven somehow. 
---
Spitballing here, but maybe cap how much can be pulled from space at some level so the really big groups have to spread out, then nerf force projection even further so the safety net of the umbrella isn't so overbearing. 
---
This will do a weird push-pull bit where people are both more spread, but also incentivized to stay in localized groups, as the pressure from ganks and hunters will probably be higher. Make being able to fight back against gankers a more integral part of PvE, maybe even make group PvE more profitable ^\(or ^solo ^less) so people sit in effective fleets. 
---
I dunno, I think CCP may have some ideas with the whole Chaos Era thing, there are going to have to be some massive systemic changes, and there's gunna be a hell of a lot of push back from a lot of people.
---

The Damsel in Destress needs your help
---
Hahahaha, Soon....it will be the "adapt or die" peeps vs the "our play style matters" peeps throw fault around as to why eve died. Popcorn at the ready
---
They don't need supers when each of them can field 500 feroxes screeching in comms pressing F1 against an alliance of 150 toons. Once asset safety is finally gone, these small groups moving into null will be loot pinyatas.
---
I've been there and it's a little less than fun when you can't leave tether because you are out numbered 20-1 on your home fort final timer 😀
---
Yeah but Detroit has gentrification, Detorid doesn't even have that going for it.
---
No.Stop posting.
---
&gt;CCP put a stop to it with their drifter nonsense.  
---
FC's put a stop to it by being burnt out from structure grinds and only Mittens who never logs in wanted to continue to Malpais. He literally said that himself.
---
An alliance tournament for miners I see
---
I liked reddit a lot more before Mittani's livelyhood got threatened :(
---
Salt mine depleted
---
There is no FRT spin because FRT doesn't control a single airwave.
---
Eve lost players either way.
---
CCP can accept that the game dies slowly because it gets increasingly stale, or they can try something else.
---
Every person with a brain knows that making the game more dangerous again would reduce player numbers short term.
---
The question is if CCP has a vision for the game beyond blackout.
---
Reduced player activity tells you fuck all. Even with all of this f2p and microtransactions, Eve is still a sub game and for all we know, subs are doing just fine.
---
Because it came with a massive nerf to RR carriers, jump fatigue, fighter bays, and supercap HP. Before those changes supers and subcaps couldnt even really touch each other. Except the slowcat fleet could just haze any subcaps off the field. 
---
There were justifications for buffing caps at the time, but the nerfs that made supers vulnerable were still not enough. Subcaps still don't really do enough damage to break fax reps, and bubbles are still far more usefull than trying to actually put 40 points of scram on a super.
---
Elo is permanently roided, if you even breath he would rage. So it's no particular victory.
---
The idea is obviously thats its better to lose 50% player activity instantly if you can build up from that again, rather than lose 10% of your player base every year without daring to take any risks to revitalize your game.
---
CCP is obviously trying to stabilize Eve and make it a unique game again. Evidently, they are willing to drive the carebears away.
---
Did you know Eve is written mainly in Python?
---
At the time, mass supercaps were not the oppressive force, it was the fucking massive slowcat fleets
---
Ok brother, listen to me.  
---
You gonna leave this subreddit and not coming back until you've played AT LEAST 3months. If you need information or stuff like this, there is a shit tons of websites providing all your needs. DO NOT ASK THIS REDDIT. Most of peoples here are full bitter mode and will complain on every-fucking-thing. Also, about PVP, send me a PM, ill link you our discord, so you can join our open free roam, ill give you ships and when you die ? I'll give you another one. Welcome to eve, HAVE SOME FUN :D
---
So every time I split something off from the stack it will just stack again? Fuck off. Right click, Stack All is fine.
---
I checked the graph, he's right guys
---
Same reason goons did, they played eve as a diplomatic empire building game instead of a pvp game. No right or wrong way to play a sandbox, but the difference really shows between AOM and Frat, just like it showed between test and goons in the fountain war or between PL and Test/Goons over the past year or two.
---
There are issue's with wormhole space and i do think farm holes need a nerf, but in general if you as a small group right now want a place  you can get fights in wormhole space is likely your best option ( if that's low or high class depends a bit on the structure of your corp ) but really in terms of survivable for smaller entities you could do worse then wormholes.
---
Thank you very much! This is the most clear information I got in this matter.
---
This is a video game we're talking about, right?
---
Man you are still so fucking proud of someone telling you who I am, its honestly kind of flattering.
---
don't you mean mining
---
He said eve preview
---
No, I want 6 5K player alliances in 3 regions who might be blue to each other instead of 1 30k player alliance in one region that are still blue to half the rest of null sec
---
cus there are plenty of reasons to be
---
Did you know being written in stackless python is a big part of a lot of it's technical issues? the most prominent one propably being the performance in big battles. The servercluster the game runs on is a monstrosity on military levels but the game simply can't utilize all the ressources provided. This has been a topic discussed way too often.
---
The drifters are done. Go smash stuff again

It's not hard to find your blacklist. Did Init. finally kick you, too?

The community's response to the news of Vile Rat's loss is what originally brought me into the world of EVE. The way the community came together to remember another player really got to me. o7 Vile Rat. I never met you, but even in death you've affected my life.
---
Wow great comment, very creative !     
---
Would you be happier if I just posted a daily screenshot of the EVE OFFLINE website like everyone else?
---
Oh.  Well I am a real person.  I mean, by all means still shoot me when you see me in space because that's why we're there but, you know...  
---
I just love the game.  I don't want to see thousands of people discontent about too many changes at once.  Blackout has been fun and Null fleets' responses have been awesome for PvP.  It'll be interesting to see what comes from cyno changes.  Enough change is enough for now, though.
---
I'm also biased, inherently because I'm a wormholer.  I almost never have the same neighbors two days in a row, can't fit dozens of my friends' capitals through the same hole at once for a fight, never have to worry about being surprised by a cyno, and don't have to abide by bullshit gates not allowing me to jump because I activated a weapon against someone.  It seems like most of those complaining about all the changes don't even realize they'll either adjust in time, or they should pack up and move into wormholes themselves.
---
actually I am happy with all the changes,  r/eve needs to quit whining all the time
---
Concerned and whining incessantly are different things.
---
Why aren't they all giving me there stuff?
---
Has using fuzzwork any advantages compared to [ESI](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/#/Universe/get_universe_types) (and caching the results)
---
First elo ate shit to vily and he raged, then elo ate shit to seddow and he raged, finally elo ate shit to ron and he ranged.  Maybe now he realizes that he is just another run of the mill fc who is slightly better at playing the range game than average.
---
First, why are you bringing up PL? Second, since you did, I'll point out that while they were at the top of the food chain the game was in a much healthier state player number wise. Things went down hill once Goons got their way.
---
I don't think he reads Reddit..... but aight.
---
Hilmar was one of those people
---
Bisu pls
---
Just bear in mind r/eve is not representative of the eve community right now. Since eve is such a social game, you might think the community is as toxic as the sub.
---
No siege + no panic would have been a decent change imo.

---
BuT TiME oF ChAoS! ! !
---
Type thing in chat, highlight. Link. Done.
---
Yes, but to fix what you are talking about requires most of the core architecture to be reworked. You also have to keep in mind that when the original developers wrote Eve, they probably never envisioned 5k+ player battles.
---
He never even said goonswarm I don’t get it.
---
Seems like everybody else have posted my response already! BTW gankers cringe post here every single day, every hour. I will continue enjoying dropping capitals on them while using friendly miners as perfect unknowing bait because now it's easier than its ever been with no local. Even without a kill it's satisfying to save a friend from losing his ships to people who wouldn't stick around for a 1 on 1 if it came to that.
---
Cyno change, what a terrible shame. Some people have been using recons as their preferred cynos for a long time.  Being timed alike with a siege and triage cycle has benefits that now everyone has no choice but to figure out how to make use of. I like that!
---
Now if it could auto stack only when putting things in a hanger that might be a thing.    But otherwise your right.
---
I won eve awhile back. Its also pretty easy to find the test command thread explaining I'm welcome back if I want to, which wouldn't be for the best for myself or test.
---
14 of those recons could be useful in dreads supers or fax
---
It's not that easy. You can not get the current fitting. And the fitting is without skills applied.
---
So you would have the user select one of his saved fittings. Read his skills. Duplicate pyfa to have the skills applied and then there still is the market price lookup. But at that point that's peanuts.
---
Don't you drag St. Bill into this!
---
Hi powers how you been?
---
&gt;And I listed two things that actually are opposite of what you said
---
What you said made no sense.
---
&gt;No I am arguing because we have always stood on that injectors were bad.
---
I know for a fact that is false.
---
&gt;Then don't say they affect everyone. These are changes targeted at nullsec.
---
Maybe blops wont be affected much, but everything else seems to be. Those who drop a lot will be the most affected.
---
&gt;What does this even mean? In the end you and I can both claim the other side cares more about zKB and neither of us will be right.
---
It means that most kills on zkb are from nullsec. It's not clear that he would even run the site if the traffic was maybe 10% of now.
---
&gt;Which I didn't say, but you are implying that anyone who doesn't support this is a bot which is disingenuous at best.
---
We "know" there are thousands of bots in game. The complaints about the blackout align with the interests of botters. Nullsec is where most botting happens.
---
&gt;They don't actually fix the issue. Supers and titans are still amazing against subcaps, they are just harder to get on the field.
---
That indirectly solves the problem.
---
&gt;So anything that doesn't hurt you isn't bad for the game.
---
I support any change that improves balance and solves actual problems. If they deleted my favourite ship for balance reasons, I would support it.
---
&gt;If that is what you meant that is not what you said, you said you want balance that hurts nullsec.
---
I think I said that nullsec deserves a lot of shit, but my real goal is balance. Null will suffer a lot beacuse it abuses a lot.
---
&gt;Large ships that have specialty drives that allow them to move across space? But in any other aspect they are slower. I mean how do you even define fastest? I can get a pod from north to south of eve significantly faster than I can a capital ship
---
If you are a few jumps out and need to get on grid, a jump capable ship is the fastest in the game.
---
&gt;Those are two different things, but that doesn't support your narrative
---
They converge.
---
&gt;As proved by the MER these changes have barely affected goons. You can't separate your bias from facts and will literally support any change that sticks it to goons and nullsec as a whole.
---
NPC bounties have been cut by more than 50% since june. This includes Delve. I'm looking at "Total NPC bounties by region". Am I reading it wrong?

Some people have better things to spend their time doing than killing lone ventures with a catalyst alt. 
---
&gt;CODE.
---
Except that’s it’s not a perfect supply and demand curve without any other factors, if people who buy plex with real life money have no interest in playing then you get very high inflation of plex (which we have). 1 is better than 4 if that 1 person is putting actual money into CCP’s wallet.
---
Need to understand this is a game that needs both pvpers and carebears.....this is an eco system. No skin of my back, adult life pretty much made blackout the nail in my coffin, even tho I dont dislike the changes. The bottomline, the "HTFU" mentality is just as bad for the whole as these folks complaining. v0v.
---
wait who is code?
---
It would be a toggle off course,
---
...what you're seeing is people trying to buy low and sell high.
---
What is confusing about this?
---
Most market pvp is in making your own orders.
---
Ron is &lt;3
---
FRT is just jealous they can't be in fleet with him hyping everyone up like it's a game we're all playing and we should have fun :D
---
Look at Npc killed maps. The bots are gone, though granted there are still a few safe havens left so you do have a point. It's not quite done yet but at least getting much closer to bots being dead.
---
Haha perfect

&gt; So what does he do, he doesn't call the white house, he doesn't call the state department, he doesn't call the embassy in Tripoli. He goes to a gaming website [note, actually Jabber]. It's the first thing I would do, I gotta check with my pals on the gaming website. And he writes "we are in Benghazi, at a safe house, if we get out of this one alive, I'll let you know". Gang, he's not telling his friendly gamers, he's a CIA agent. He is telling people, this is where we are, help us.
---
I never said anything against that, quite the opposite i'm usually one of the people that tells others they should be happy with tidi when they say "CCPls fix tidi", because the "fix" would be rewriting the game which is just not gonna happen.  
---
But these problems i mentioned are still the reason why i took that humorous jab at using python.
---
i need  connection to solitude  region
---
They are made of capital ship components.
---
Nope they don't need to quit. They need to die so they can learn through hardship that they made a mistake.
---
Some times meta modules will be cheaper despite being better because people quickly default to using t1 stuff.
---
One example is the meta precursor weapons. They have lower fitting and further optimal but are much much cheaper than t1.
---
This is what your brain looks like on r/Eve
---
Stop it.. it’s like.. you are using some sort of logic or something.. like we can only do and mittens commands!?
---
Underrated comment. But it's likely to take them at least a year.
---
mhm we are nor blue to half of 0sec ^^ there is just no reason in invading them
---
Wait so some dude actually said he’s in Benghazi and needs help in our jabber😂
---
... Who brings an orca to highsec mining?
---
That’s one of its primary functions. It’s a barely-mobile industrial command ship. What, you use orcas to mine in null or something?
---
You sound like exactly what this game needs. Just stay away from the sov null metagame right now. Its the most restrictive and busted aspect of the game.
---
Goons, unironically begging the playerbase to forego their own interests and support theirs, after spending the better part of the last decade telling everyone else to eat shit, "helldunk or blueball", ruin YOUR game, adapt or die, etc.
---
Pretty sure my sides died on their way back to their home planet...
---
You still chirping away I see...
---
this right here !
---
Point in case :P
---
Like it should be. Capital ships are not solo-mobiles. You need a group to use them. Getting punished for being a greedy loner is fine.
---
Ikr. It’s like institutionalized cuckoldry.
---
&gt;NPC bounties have been cut by more than 50% since june. This includes Delve. I'm looking at "Total NPC bounties by region". Am I reading it wrong?
---
The rest of these posts back in forth are you implying you only care about balance and also saying fuck nullsec. Why indirectly nerf things. The problems are Supers/titans being able to affect sub caps and injectors, neither of which CCP is nerfing. Nerfing cynos does affect these things but also does a ton of collateral damage to the game. 
---
As for the piece I actually quoted you are very mistaken. You will want to use May for Delve as goons were deployed in June.
---
* May: ~5.5t
---
* June: ~1.5t
---
* July: ~4.7t
---
* August: ~4.5t
---
Every other region dropped off a cliff but delve held reasonably steady in the time frame.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
The newest major addition to the test blue list
---
Its funny that the title is what triggered people more than the actual meme... I dont complain about the game, I actually really enjoy playing it.  I just dislike the nonstop whining and complaining around here with little or no constructive feedback.
---
Skill into?  Don't you mean skill-inject into ?
---
Been playing eve for 10 years until recently. It's always like this, always.
---
Not really. Kiki is the only one that's imbalanced. They have binary range limitations and slightly below average initial dps, made up for with off standard damage type and exceptionally high tracking. The kimora has none of the weaknesses inherent to the weapon type thanks to ridiculously strong hull bonuses, and being far and away the most popular of the tree had really skewed perception of the ships in general.
---
so, he was responsible for transmitting intel and other sensitive cables for the mission of overthrowing foreign governments and stuff alike. Should I feel sorry now?
---
why?
---
Uhh, wut?
---
yak!
---
Das kannst man im Kopf ausrechnen. Oder wenn man faul ist nimmt man nen Taschenrechner. Oder wenn man von der alten Schule ist nen Blatt Papier.
---
exactly!!! 
---
I love this game and love playing it.  It drives me crazy to log into reddit and see nothing but whining and complaining...  I wish more people would be part of the solution and not be part of the problem.
---
Good, carebears ruin the industry. Get out.
---
Fights in Eve take place in space. Space is big.
---
You mention realism, realistically speaking, fights in space ought to take place at far, far longer ranges.
---
Most of the isk from null comes from super ratting. Rorq mining in itself generates 0 isk (it's an ore faucet). Super ratting is one of the more intensive pve activities in Eve in terms of APM and you're also putting at risk 15b+ of space ship in the process.
---
YEAH dumbies. Only in game politics and trying to get Hilmar fired allowed here! And hourly PCU updates
---
No players = no bots. Win win
---
K
---
&gt; Three years of null 99.99% safe
---
I understand you want to shade the narrative in the favor of you supporting "Chaos" but this number is outright bullshit.
---
Good to know.
---
Yeah! Let’s use a real world event that many of us lived through in person as away to troll in a space  video game!! Fucking neckbeards.....
---
&gt;I see they don't teach basic literacy where you're from.
---
You're the one who throws out the word strawman in every other thread you comment in, even when its not a strawman and you just don't have an argument to make.
---
Ingame politics is ok, thats part of the metagame. The other two are just stupid that's true.
---
As always you are trying to stir shit. All the things you listed are related to eve.
---
Yes you fuckwad, that's why I said they're allowed. Thank you for taking the reading comprehension test, you passed. Collect your gold star and please don't lick the windows on your way out
---
Yes I agree. But here we are
---
This is it in a nutshell. If it's Eve politics, that's perfectly fine.
---
The Trump v. Hillary debates though? Take that shit to a subreddit for that. We're all just eve players here.
---
Huh, I thought Elo Knight was supposed to be good at his job and pretty chill. Was I just misinformed? It can be hard to keep all of EvE's personalities straight sometimes...
---
Games better off dead than how it was.  Not much you an say that will change that fact, if she dies, its better than dwindling like it was under the oppression of one gigantic mob of people in the south (the entire lower half of the map before somebody gets their stinger in an uproar) playing farm simulator.
---
That does sound like the Ron I know.
---
You can definitely do dumber.
---
Use your commas my man. I had to read this like 6 times to get what you were saying.
---
No false premise. The more you expand, the more difficult it is to defend said land. Add a few systems without increasing player numbers is pointless. Try to defend more property which means spreading your forces thinner. Results in welping of fleets or loss of systems of which you just obtained. Putting you right back where you started
---
blasters have very good dps low alpha, the fire rate is what pulls through. Alpha is the first shot dps is the amount of  damage per second.
---
So it auto stacks, and auto splits. Sounds like a boot.ini waiting to happen.
---
I never met the guy or even *heard* of him until weeks after the bombing, but seeing people describe their interactions with him and how they miss him...I feel sad about it, too. It's like hearing your stories lets me feel as you do, in some small way.
---
I wish I could have met the guy, he sounds like he was awesome.
---
Had a few converasations back in the day (and a few characters prior to this one.)
---
Will never forget that personality. A bit of you lives on in every one of us who got that experience.
---
Shoot blues, tell VR.
---
Must have taken to much sarcasm from you as you are constantly shitting in posts about hilmar and pcu counts, and insulting in basically every thread.
---
If this was a sincere post then my apologies, it's real annoying to see people shitting up the vile rat thread with politics.
---
\[tinfoil hat time\] interesting narrative, i'd buy it except ALL the big block leaders have been in the same skype/discord/whatever for years ... all staged to keep their RMT empires alive
---
:-)
---
Been away for a while - why can I see contracts for supers in ordinary lowsec stations? Can supers dock in regular stations now?
---
He was like " look at that idiot lol"
---
Wtf, why would someone even do that... and i thought this was about crude jokes like that post after judgement day where someone put judge in a turban in front the CO2 Keepstar over the twintowers. Completely retarded but at the very least eve related.
---
Pass the cost on to your customers and stop complaining.
---
I already killed 3 of 4 accounts, but I'll post here till I die because fuck em.
---
Or maybe big groups will just start round the clock fleets under their umbrella that rorqs can join, and mine in packs. Surrounded by dozens of cloaked recons and T3’s.. 
---
But there not gonna do that.. everyone is just going to keep mining solo in the same systems they have always mined in..
---
I'm generally reasonable when people are reasonable, but this is r/eve. And I agree, its stupid to think anyone here wants to hear about rl politics. There's countless other subs one can get their confirmation bias from.
---
Bretty good. I keep missing /u/absolutetruth’s streams
---
Probably but if they aren't shit, a function that does this would be very useful for item management.
---
None of these ideas are very good.
---
One of these ideas is illegal.
---
Also, I don't want to PVP.
---
Unfortunately CCP is listening to the wrong dudes.
---
So we team up to kill the lords. We just need game mechanics that allow this with a little hard work.
---
From Winter Coalition to Baozi coalition.
---
Imagine nullsec having content!
---
marine Ron?
---
oof
---
Your definition of minimal and the hours I spend doing PvE in high sec to buy ships for the minutes I spend to do PvP in low and null do not jive. I think your out of touch.
---
Kind of like how you guys killed LS then eh?
---
It's annoying and more hassle than it used to, but it's not as bad as you make it out to be. 
---
Larger alliances will have it easier, more likely to have multiple JFs online at a time. Organize 1 cyno and have a bunch of JFs jump T1 industrials, LO, and cynos in the destination systems. 
---
May take about a day, but an entire route could be seeded with a few hundred cyno ships. 
---
After that, with some coordination you can have multiple JFs use the same cyno instead of everyone using their own. Just like you would do for capital move ops. 
---
A clownshoe on a gunned citadel isn't likely to die everytime you light it.
---
If you lose something you have to spend time to get it back. The more expensive thing you lost the more time you have to invest into the game again. So in EvE, you do not lose things, but more or less real time from your own life.
---
You can buy time with your credit card using the "money -&gt; plex -&gt; isk -&gt; ships" method. This is the relative easy way to get a new ship and try to find others to kick. But be prepeared, you will spend sometimes hours to get a fight you want, because others also try to avoid to be blown up, and lose time / money.
---
Breaking: Mamapants wonders why her ship is not yet repaired. More and the weather after this short break.
---
covert cynos work in wormholes next patch FYI
---
Like this guy https://zkillboard.com/kill/78884656/
---
No not anymore EVE is dead.
---
I think 3 miles is a pretty far distance to be shooting other moving ships with a projectile. Missiles you could make a case for long ranges, lasers too. I really just want the combat to be more visible, that's why I suggested moving combat to closer ranges.
---
Wow paging u/Wingsigh these haters be everywhere
---
&gt;The players also have part of the responsibility, by min-maxing broken design decisions to a very high degree and doing their best to contribute to the onset of stagnation
---
Absolutely not.
---
The players warned CCP exactly how they were going to exploit the fuck out of their design changes, and CCP charged ahead anyway.
---
For a specific example, the goon CSM members told CCP what they'd do with Rorquals and Citadels before those changes were implemented.  CCP made the changes anyway.  Goons did exactly what they told CCP they'd do.  CCP suprisedpicachu'ed.
---
&gt;The problem is that they have catered to a single playstyle for so long, that they have driven out a large part of the people who did things differently and are the target audience for these changes.
---
The problem is there's no coherent plan behind the changes.  They're throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks.
---
That isn't going to get any "playstyle" back in the game, because random changes mean you have no idea what they're going to do next.  You could come back because "Yay! Blackout!", only to see it reversed because ChAoS ErA!!!!!
---
CCP needed a plan.  They needed to nerf Citadels.  They need to do something to make Rorqs not infinitely scale.  They need to do something so that hunters can be successful with careful planning.  They need to rework Sov yet again.  And they need all those changes to fit together well.
---
They did nothing to Citadels.  They are doing nothing to Rorqs.  They're trying to hand easy ganks to every would-be hunter, but it turns out the targets aren't particularly interested in volunteering to be ganked.  And Sov is off the menu too.
---
These changes are CCP panicking.  They're under pressure to perform better, and don't know how to do it.  So they're doing exactly what SOE did, and pulling an NGE.
---
That guy was purged for being shit fit.. was warned multiple times.. Mitanni was brought on comms and gave the order to purge the guy. Think he also lost a super or something like that too.?
---
I think it’s great.. the bads will get blipped and the guy who are worth their salt will reap the benefits of the rising mineral prices.
---
You could be that guy that CC warrior'ed his way to pirate capitols then lost 2 in a month. So i mean room for lower IQ
---
I mean...good.
---
It always shocked me how just a few people can keep an alliance just chugging along. Just looking at some of my stats, a handful of people (karkinos) have moved over a hundred bil of stuff for me *alone* in the past year. And I was just doing some market seeding for a secondary income stream. Imagine all the other people in horde they are also helping.
---
I feel like CCP is going to nerf JFs even more in the future and maybe even remove them. They make null sec wayyy too easy.
---
IMO JFs should be removed to force alliances to do convoys. Imagine how much fucking content that would generate. Sure, it would be a PITA for indy people, but null sec should be hard to get to! It would also bring some actual risk to living in these far out regions like cobalt edge, omist, etc.
---
Furthermore, it would actually hurt large alliances. A small alliance in null probably only needs a few freighter runs a week to keep themselves going, whereas a large null alliance like goonswarm would need SO MANY MORE JF runs a week that they would a much bigger target for hunters.
---
In turn, yeah goons would need to protect their convoys, but then that *also* detracts from their home defense force, leaving them vulnerable to attacks on krabs.
---
Ganking would see a huge revival since many groups would use haulers not in said alliance to avoid ez wardec kills in hisec.
---
All in all, it would encourage gameplay in smaller alliances, make eve more dangerous, and produce more content. You either help with the escort fleets, or whoops maybe no more materials for T2 manufacturing that can't be found in your region.
---
Well what do you do to earn isk, what is your earn rate, and what do you PVP in?
---
I can do 1 character for 2 hours and buy 40 pvp frigates.
---
V0LTA is trash btw
---
it reminds me poor sabre trying alone agaist rorqual but died in his own bubble.
---
Whoa, nice find. Thanks!
---
Bobby Axelrod just called - he needs you on his team stat.
---
Acceleration to alignment is a non-linear process, however there's a rather straightforward math formula that can tell you how long it will take to reach alignment from a given starting heading. I don't know why they didn't just make a bar that started at 0 when you hit warp, and filled up as time elapsed toward that known duration (recalculating in case of bump).
---
Yes yes the calculations make sense
---
Ugh.
---
People have been complaining about stagnation for years. As soon as CCP does *anything* about it, the troglodytes in this sub pretend like they’re going to boycott Eve. It’s so stupid.
---
lmaoe
---
So less people are mining. Mineral prices can go back up and armageddons can go back up to 200mill. Suddenly mat prices are worth mining in the risky space. The point being is that yes they have ruined the play style because it was ironically ruining itself. The play style literally inflated itself into being worth less then the others.
---
The others are somewhat hard capped like Dark said in the other reply. You can't so easily multibox abyssals to the scale you can with rorq mining.
---
So boring ... Just smartbomb them.
---
:)
---
Thems fightin' words son.
---
But not for me, am not volta.
---
miner = Hauptwort/Nomen

to mine = Zeitwort/Verb

Wenn schon eindeutschen dann bitte richtig: “was du minest”
---
&gt; Wtf, why would someone even do that
---
People just can't help themselves when it comes to politics. I understand, it's a hot topic and people get emotional. But this just isn't the place for it.
---
It is cute when I'm accused of being a "Hillary shill" though!
---
&gt; Edit: also great flair btw, where can i get that?
---
I got you, friend.
---
I have toons in and actively play in FW, Sov Null, and WH's daily.  Not much triggers me besides constant negativity from the community.
---
I live in null in a mid sized old alliance. The cyno changes really brought the part where people don't realize they will adjust, out in the open for me. The amount of squirming and bitching about having to use recons for cynos, is what made it so apparent. I have been using recon cynos for years before any whisper was even dreamed of this change. 
---
Guess what, they are a fantastic ship for cynos. The falcon is my go to since its an utterly useless ship. It has a great role everyone has overlooked since ecm changes. 
---
Another bonus of recon cynos is in practise they happen to finish cycle about 30 seconds before siege and triage finish, what's not to like about that? You light dozens of them from one load of ozone too.
---
I can tell
---
&gt; One reason why this may not happen is the length of time for the query ... To show a list of all your items, it just pulls that.
---
While CCP has #poscode and everything else that comes from having a nearly 20 year old codebase, I would like to point out that this info might already be in the client, because they're already querying the player items, and they know such information like ship names, so the item hp property might already exist for the UI to process.
---
I do what the game pointed me towards, missions and mining. Typical for costs about 2m.
---
You have a character who is doing what the game showed you to do who is under 2m so that can make 80m in 2 hours. Must have been shit the NPE said really quietly.
---
Ja das hat weniger mit dem tatsächlichen Wort als mit dem Wort das meine Gruppe benutzt wenn wir vom minen reden
---
Is my IQ too low to understand this or is this just terrible?
---
&gt;The rest of these posts back in forth are you implying you only care about balance and also saying fuck nullsec.
---
Yes. These things can be combined.
---
&gt;Why indirectly nerf things.
---
Because some things are too strong.
---
&gt;The problems are Supers/titans being able to affect sub caps and injectors, neither of which CCP is nerfing.
---
Anything that can suddently appear can be a problem.
---
&gt;Nerfing cynos does affect these things but also does a ton of collateral damage to the game. 
---
Disagree. Cynos are mostly uncounterable. There is never a true counter to instant positioning.
---
&gt;As for the piece I actually quoted you are very mistaken. You will want to use May for Delve as goons were deployed in June.
---
Not sure where you get those numbers, but bounties have gone from 55T in Apr 2019 to 21T in Aug.
---
AC, augmented mining drones have only about 300 to 400 HP and zero resistance has so they just all die in one volley from my experiences.
---
Tuz was right!!!!
---
Update his and Black ops hunters out in full force me boy
---
Natürlich kann man das Rechnen im Kopf machen, aber krieg mal den höchsten Kaufpreis in jita im Moment raus ohne in jita zu sein, und wenn du jetzt sagst eve marketer, guess what ich benutz die gleiche api
---
Breaking News: Graph indicates that between 1000 and 5000 players are estimated to remain in game during downtime each evening. CCP suspiciously mum as conspiracy theories and rumors circulate. Extrajudicial assassinations are speculated to occur during these supposed “downtimes.” 
---
Hilmar expected to hold emergency press conference addressing concerns of biocide for sentient bots and crabs in their natural environments.
---
&gt;hillary shill  
---
Lol... nah.... you're just the goon shill of our hearts &lt;3
---
Take it to DM's losers.
---
I was going to agree with you, but perhaps it's supposed to be terrible to illustrate said point?
---
I use it because I don't want to deal with the authorization process of esi :)
---
What?
---
I make over 300m/hr.
---
My pvp frigates are 15-20m.
---
Reddit mods caused the blackout. The truth is out there. CCP can't melt player numbers.

Rest in the cosmos beyond, my friend. You will be missed.

Well, if your programmer friend actually said you are insane for taking that on it sounds like he might not be a good programmer or friend.
---
My income is totally 100% from pvp, killing shits and looting them. Fuck pve.
---
Lmao.
---
I'm very confused. I get that the nados were tryin to gank your Iki but what does the Orca have to do with it?
---
Zkill doesn't look like that tbh, no noteworthy increase in activity for blops bs.
---
I've been of the opinion that killboards are part of the equation.  Corps/alliances bitching at people that lose a ship doing solo/small gang making it so they stop that and only do the ping blobs.  
---
The whole gankbear mentality really caught on when public killboards became a thing and solo/small gang guys have been dwindling for like seven years.
---
Mango's ping (credits to James Preps for the translation):

 For a while now, WC has always tried to blame AOM for its unfavorable position in the current war. They act as if their defeats are caused by us. In fact, everyone in AOM knows that our agreement with legacy only includes sov defense- we do not attend any offensive sov timers nor offensive citadel-onlining. We do this out of the camaraderie shared between Chinese players despite their hostility against us since we first settled in tranq. As WC is losing more and more in this war to the point of almost losing detorid and having a legacy KS in QLPX, they need to find somewhere to vent their frustration, and find an excuse for their current position. Thus, they start to blame AOM.  Personally, I think even if AOM did not come to tranquility WC will be in the same shitty situation regardless. They talk as if it was us who onlined the keepstar, entosised all their sov and fought against them in every battle. (WC) has too much faith in us \*laughs\*. If we were fighting you, Noraus, you would be long dead already. You guys think you'll live to this day? 
---
    WC has been pestering us for a while now, hoping not to see us -"can you not come?". TBF we have tried our best; not attending offensive wars; but you might argue "helping enemies to defend is itself an attack". Sure, fair point, whatever. WC has declared war on AOM today. AOM might not be very powerful, but I can assure you it will unleash all its power if you try to mess with us. We might be kittens or puppies in Omist right now. However, I will show you what AOM is if you try to evict us. This will be the first sovereignty war and first full-scale war in Tranquility. Yes, I said it, sovereignty war, full scale. I’ll await you to push into Omist, because we will be pushing into all of your sov systems. From today onwards, AOM will join any kind of aggression against WC in any forms. This will include all kinds of battle such as whaling, entosis, and offensive citadels. The alliance from now on will enter sov war status; all members will go online and listen to FC. We will coordinate production, but our focus will be on this war.  To noraus- wake the fuck up and stop pretending to be the beacon of hope for all Chinese players. AOM will demonstrate to you what brave and disciplined Chinese players can accomplish. I am glad this day has come and I hope everyone will do their best in the upcoming days.
---
Damn it!
---
Ah yes, the classical art of kamikaze diplomacy.  
---
Gobbins would be proud.
---
Adding more numbers in the CNTZ for Legacy to wage offensive ops, I suppose. If you're already losing a war, why add more strength to those you're fighting. Legacy will have more bodies in fleet in the TZ they were the weakest in now.
---
Damn right
---
With some sp investment and some research, there’s little reason you can’t make above 200 mil an hour with 1 account doing a variety of activities after setting up the logistics. 
---
Burners, deds, wh’s , abyssal, officer hunting, incursions, trading and reprocessing, industry and logistics. 
---
With 30 days of training you can run t3 abyssals in a frigate and make 100 mil an hour on average.
---
Yeah, building indy's is the best way to seed them,  You can fit several indy's worth of minerals in a blops.
---
I know he won't read it, but someone who might mention it to him probably will.
---
Edits weren't made with a black sharpie tho
---
Hell yea!
---
Not sure if shitpost or retard. Flair says retard, but I'm holding out hope
---
... one could argue that you deciding to inject your alts to cyno 5 as soon as CCP announced it instead of waiting until it was implemented was a thoughtless knee-jerk reaction as well
---
Typical Russians...
---
Reddit mods aren't important so I don't believe you.
---
Logistics are what provide all those other shits for pvper to kill out in space. Kill logistics and you kill your content. 
---
Also JF still die anyway, if they never died I'd say you have a point.
---
Code is an alliance who’s goal is to kill players like you.
---
The same man who crashed through Victor Maitland's window?  The man who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana.  The gentleman, who just this morning wrecked the buffet at the Harrow club.
---
ahh, yet another who never took Psych 101.
---
Shhhh your ruining a narrative.
---
You're in the wrong alliance if you aren't in to petty quarrels.
---
Ah, yet another who did, and thinks they're a qualified psychologist.
---
&gt;Overall ship deaths are down outside of null (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong since I'm bad at zkill)
---
I don't think that is right. See:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cyoz92/eve\_graphs\_update\_evestatistics\_ship\_destroyed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cyoz92/eve_graphs_update_evestatistics_ship_destroyed/) 
---
&gt; If you want to assume it's all multiboxers, provide data for this. 
---
I don't assume anything. There is multiboxers turning to single account, there bots leaving, there are bots moving to HS, there are certainly new bots too. And there are players leaving and joining. We don't have data to see the overall picture.
---
On the more fundamental level: there are those that argue about changing the rules of the game, and there are those that simply play the game. If you spend too much time arguing about the rules you forget to play, and you don't have time to experiment new things that could change your pespective.
---
&gt;&gt;The rest of these posts back in forth are you implying you only care about balance and also saying fuck nullsec.
---
&gt;Yes. These things can be combined.
---
Which makes you biased and you claim to only care about balanced
---
&gt;&gt;Why indirectly nerf things.
---
&gt;Because some things are too strong.
---
So you are saying Supers and titans are to strong to be directly nerfed?
---
&gt;&gt;The problems are Supers/titans being able to affect sub caps and injectors, neither of which CCP is nerfing.
---
&gt;Anything that can suddently appear can be a problem.
---
So should they nerf the ability to bridge 100 bombers onto a grid then?
---
&gt;&gt;Nerfing cynos does affect these things but also does a ton of collateral damage to the game.
---
&gt;Disagree. Cynos are mostly uncounterable. There is never a true counter to instant positioning.
---
Except cynos still exist, they are just harder to use for capitals. Blackops and covert ships received an effective buff from this so that isn't what you are actually concerned with.
---
&gt;&gt;As for the piece I actually quoted you are very mistaken. You will want to use May for Delve as goons were deployed in June.
---
&gt;Not sure where you get those numbers, but bounties have gone from 57T in Apr 2019 to 21T in Aug.
---
Yes and the original part of this was me saying goons were mostly unaffected, I showed you the numbers for goons. The universe as a whole lost like 55% but goons lost much less.
---
could you give some examples?
---
Orcas have ship maintenance bays which allows fully fitted ships. Scoop the ~30k ehp cruiser into it and suddenly they have to kill an 800k ehp ship instead.
---
i never got whats so special about the 9th of november.
---
Long as you understand that its a rock-paper-scissors kind of game, yeah. Anything that fights you willingly is almost always either your direct counter or intellectually challenged.
---
(Prepare to work for your goodfights)
---
mango did not defend our offensive structures, they participated in no ops in detroid that i am tracking before this point.
---
Call him "ELO GUMP" cause he's always Running!
---
When I said the same thing people said I was incorrect, PvPers are coming out of the wookwork. Fights everywhere! I must be just missing them or something.
---
I wasn't aware there was something thought out enough to be called a narrative here, i'm terribly sorry
---
Sniggwaffe killed low sec?
---
Seeing people in local was awesome, null just feels so quiet.
---
If you get a chance mining with a battleship. You'll have to jet can stuff but output is slightly better than the venture
---
Needs more purple
---
That is one of the greatest crimes of the era; all the good shitposts get trampled by the PCU propaganda posts
---
CCP grants your wish and gives you a fuel bay on every industrial ship. This bay holds 159m3.
---
This post is just mean-spirited and gay.
---
What players? Your ideas and constant form bitching about poor hunters not being able to pvp with zero risk has led to the lowest activity since 2005. Bots have already adapted to this bullshit. So ask yourself how many players are really still in the game?
---
Barely mobile? Shiiitttt
---
I hope local eventually returns in the form of constellation/region chat
---
Well, you could filter the result in the client, just saying.
---
This a question from someone considering the game. I am new, under 2m new. My experience with the game the last two months will be similar to his as he begins. The game is going to point him to mining and missions in high sec. He is NOT going to make 300m/hr.
---
As I said, your out of touch. Nullsec folks can't make that kind of ISK ratting or mining with a single account.
---
You don’t light a Cyno while hauling valuable loot through low sec? I thought that’s what everyone was doing?!? How else do you explain people’s irresistible desire to shoot Cyno ships all the time?
---
Mental illness is not funny. I hope you're not being serious.
---
I vote for a regional local.
---
This is true you have no utility
---
&gt;Flair says retard
---
Can't argue with facts. Upvoted.
---
Gotta call it like you see it, right?
---
That’s what happens when people quit playing the game, I’m sure eve’s best white knights will be along any second with their usual “good riddance” posts
---
Lol europeans
---
Oof. I’ll fly my Leshak over there to help
---
I am glad I am not the only person to think that.
---
I have a character capable of 300m/hr that has been capable of that since around 4-5m sp.
---
Omega, but not much sp.
---
And because it s fun to do it ;)
---
You're very welcome, I'm glad I helped! I remember at first I had no idea what it did. After watching videos about other stuff I finally got it. The game doesn't really explain it
---
cHaOs ErA.
---
It is lonely, even if you are in your alliance's home system, you do not know if they are there.  
---
Thanks CCP for making my lonely existance in real life now lonley in game too.
---
Regional by default for all. Constellation local to only sov holders who have a specific index level in all the systems.
---
This would be a great addition.
---
For that matter, so would the ability to modify market orders, manage hangar assets, plan ship fits, manufacture things, etc. I would love to see an Eve mobile app which allowed you to do most activities which happen while you are docked.
---
Although it would increase the amount of info the server has to send, would leaving that search part client-side be a good compromise? I don't see any way the client can be modified to abuse this, and the check for all fully repaired items can be done pretty quickly even assuming a large inventory.
---
The client side just needs to hide the items we don't need to see, and the item we select should be one the server would agree is damaged.
---
Those are wormholers btw.
---
Reminds me of the time I bit on a Thrasher in what was essentially minimally tanked travel ceptor with about 500M in loot in my cargohold thinking I could just point and speed tank at range :(
---
I think it took two volleys for me to die.
---
Taschenrechner sind an sich großartig als lernprojekt, da haben viele Entwickler mit angefangen.

I've not had so much fun in a fleet for a while. Thanks Ron, for your first 1000 players fight as an fc, you did amazing.
---
&gt; Well, you could filter the result in the client, just saying.
---
....And how is the client going to get that information?

---
They were probably asset safetied to the low sec station and the owner is now fire selling them rather than trying to extract them.
---
Just poke the local keepstar system plenty of people will show up.
---
I like how OP is qualified to make psychiatric diagnoses based on a single sentence.
---
And another larger chunk dosen't give a shit how destructive and stupid changes are as long as they feel they are hurting goons (tip: they are hurting everyone else in null far worse)
---
Yes, one person in the keepstar will lock you and turbolaser you and then you lose 7 of your ships.
---
&gt;Which makes you biased and you claim to only care about balanced
---
I don't think so. I don't need null to be punished specifically, but if they suffer more, I dont mind.
---
&gt;So you are saying Supers and titans are to strong to be directly nerfed?
---
I'm saying cynos are too strong.
---
&gt;So should they nerf the ability to bridge 100 bombers onto a grid then?
---
Probably.
---
&gt;Except cynos still exist, they are just harder to use for capitals. Blackops and covert ships received an effective buff from this so that isn't what you are actually concerned with.
---
Blops are a problem and should have their teleport nerfed.
---
&gt;Yes and the original part of this was me saying goons were mostly unaffected, I showed you the numbers for goons. 
---
I dont know when they moved in or out. Not sure why I should care so much about that. The MER isn't the only metric.
---
See, i always thought there should be an indy ship for fuel blocks, but now these changes make me reconsider it. I disagree with your statement that they should have a fuel bay.
---
I understand and somewhat agree with your initial assessment, but like others have said distances in Eve make sense. A solution to this that I've seen more than once is a "Target Cam" window that would give you a close-up of the thing you've got selected. It would give you a better feel during combat too, as you could better see the impact your weapons are having.
---
I've heard at Eve North that it's something the devs have talked about and that there's no release date, so it will take a while... just know that you're not the first one to complain about that.
---
Anyone that is an actual logistics person would have prestaged the ships before the patch to their home region, and then ran the indy cynos out there after. 
---
For new routes on deployments, alliance leadership can either adapt and escort shit or not deploy. It's pretty simple.
---
I see tons of people talking about inflation/deflation without really understanding how it actually works. Its far more complex than more isk = inflation. Fact is, we had years of deflation, prices were dropping, people were farming more. This means you as a player had more purchasing power, not less. Right now this is going in the other direction, stuff is getting more expensive, inflation. Your isk just lost value. This is economics, not whatever you heard or read. Just look at the pricegraphs and you see that stuff has increased in price faster than your wallet.
---
Secondly, the only faucet in NS if im not mistaken is bounties. That comes mostly from carriers/supers and is by no means afk activity. Mining is not a faucet and thats the only thing that you can afk outside of subcap ratting.
---
And thirdly, who do you think is doing the most PvP in the game? You really think anyone can even come close to matching how much the blocs fight? So the isk goes into actually being able to buy ships, the bigger the better. 
---
So I can understand your sentiment but its wrong, or atleast skewered. NS isnt filled with megacrabs, its a small minority that is the multiboxing PvEer. Its just a narrative that has been told so many times that people have started beliving in it. 
---
But there are issues. Ive never liked the Rorqual for instance, it needs change. Other than that, honestly, there wasnt much issues in the isk generation imo. Bots were a concern but they still are, theyre just in other places. Quite frankly, the game was in a good place outside of a few select things. The most important was Rorqs and a reason to fight + better mechanics for it. 
---
These changes fix none of those issues. It just stagnates the game much much more. You think NS is gonna fight more wars in the near future? Fk no, everyone is just gonna focus on defense.
---
i think its only a handful of people that make the most noise around here.  Most people i talk to in game are quite positive, love playing this game,  and feel the same way about reddit
---
Wonder what Rorq ice mining in Thera would be like
---
Its healthy for the game if 50% of the people quit you see, and other /r/eve greatest hits.
---
Reading the race descriptions is like a bad Chinese translation of the EVE races. The stations' docking lights look exactly like the ones in EVE. 
---
Ships, missions, modules... All a cheap version of EVE. At first I though CCP had made the game.
---
I thought we had already won that war and glassed all their space while they didn’t fight at all because they couldn’t fight over 1000 Titans (typical NCdocked)? Or was it that we were going to keep glassing regions until we got to Esoteria and then our beloved dream of a Blue Donut would finally come to fruition? Only CCP is dominated by Grr Goons Hat Goons so they summoned unholy powers to stop us? Or was it because some turbocrabs hurled themselves at the first opportunity to scuttle back home to defend the crab hole? I suppose I’m losing track of the narrative at this point...
---
Some kind of localrep might help you in the future.
---
If they know, it's a shitty asset
---
Presumably, the repaired state of the item is included in the same row in the database as the item's name. If the client can request everything in the hangar, then it can filter by repaired state on the client side.
---
The game doesn't point to any of those things or how to do them in the new player experience. IF he ever learns these things exist ( I know I have heard the word but have no clue what a burner is) he will need to join a Corp and be pointed to this stuff that I imagine takes a big initial investment in time and isk. 
---
I got dumped into the universe from the NPE with about 3m isk and a venture. I see I can huff gass to make money as it's super cheap. Ok the fit was 5~ or so I mine hours to get the fit together, then..oh yeah you need a 20m skillbook that no oneentioned because you guys are out of touch and have no idea how much effort it takes to pull in 20-25m if all you have nothing and know less, just 50k mission rewards and 200k full venture holds.
---
Sorry, when someone says " well don't you know about so in so, it's so easy" when there is no mention of this stuff in game and very little available to the public. Of course we do not know.
---
I see where the bartering stage of Acceptance Now..
---
Asymmetric counters are the foundation of all PvP in the game since it's birth. It's exactly what makes it appealing to pvp (a lot of rock-paper-scissors play) and also keeps new players useful.
---
Just because you sit in something big, doesn't mean that 100 players in smaller ships should be unable to kill you.
---
Serious question: How many concerned people does it take for the concern to be perceived as whining?
---
In this hypothetical I'm assuming no spam or repeat "concerns" from a handful of people.
---
Maybe your support fleet should consist of something other than Feroxes and HACs.  There are plenty of tools to mitigate the damage coming out of a fleet with tunnel vision.  It's like people give up when they can't ram their square fleet into a round hole.
---
What would be the point of regional local?
---
&gt;what is clownshoe nereus    
---
the post
---
Why is this insane?
---
i fought by being smart and keep check of the tanking. any other spodbrain would probably just shitfit for efficiency instead of survival. i had to start moving and overheat just in case to rev up some extra mitigation, seems pretty much like fighting for your life. could have deployed the drones? yes, but i was more focused on checking how the shield was doing against the blasters before the police arrived to clean up.
---
would i want to test it again but against a destroyer? of course, it was the whole point of tanking it. but i didnt just sit like a dead weight waiting for the reckoning.
---
When I joined goons people told me I should jump clone but idgaf and decided to fly down from jita. 
---
As a new player it was exciting, it was a long journey and I stopped a few times along the way to make cups of tea and when I stopped I'd chat with the locals and they were all pretty chill. I even signed up to a scam dating agency to find my space wife along the way and we spoke about space weddings and space jesus. I still get the occasional message telling me that they are still searching for my future space wife. It's probably my most memorable eve experience and I still have the Brave Little Atron with a cargo of spiced wine and exotic dancers in my hanger. I've bought lots of ships since then but the Brave Little Atron is still my favourite.
---
Eve is already dead... it drops to 0 each day!!!
---
Yeah man.  I recently returned from a five year break and was really surprised at the lack of gate camps in null.  Use to always run into them.  I've only seen one in a lowsec system since I returned.
---
Good see ya
---
I have played on and off since 2013 and a number of people in my corp are far older in game terms. What I want to let you know is this, while we can fly very expensive ships, and do.... we very often form up in cheap ass ships like you will be flying early on and go raise hell across the map. 
---
We do it, not because they are the strongest ships, not because they are the cheapest ships, just because they are fun as hell. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love undocking a battleship or T3 cruiser; but they are seldom as much raw fun as wrecking nerds with a T1 destroyer. 
---
Some of the most fun fleets we have had have been in ships that you could train into within a few hours and are so cheap we might just give you one if you didn't have the isk... but realistically we could teach you to afford very quickly. 
---
Admittedly, back when I was a low-skill point nerd in high sec, a few mil looked like a lot of isk and would take me hours to make. After I joined up and learned what did and didn't make sense, my income quickly rose. 
---
Its less about how much you spend on your ship, and more about knowing how to use it...and having some friends at your back never hurts.
---
Yes a small majority make a large amount of noise every day. Yet the changes they are screaming for are making most of the player base disappear.

How do you feel about the forced perspective from abyssal space?

I'm in a big null-sec alliance, but like I said, what more changes are coming to demand more accounts?! CCP have shown themselves to be arbitrary, capricious and greedy.

i dont fly Gallente so was thinking on Autocannons instead. Arty Slasher was done in an experiment and the volley damage seems legit but the target escaped before getting at least 1-2 shots to check if it would die before concord arrival.
---
autocannon fit on the other hand looks like it has the potential and you cant still fit double scram according to Pyfa. but this is all on paper so im not sure
---
I can see how rorq mining would balance out the influx of super ratting money that much true. However in the time I've played actively which is about 3 years PLEX has gone from about 900mil ISK for a 30day plex to about 2 bil peak to about 1.61 bil now that things have settled down. 
---
The simple truth is that bots and afkers devalue whatever activity they're abusing because they'll always be willing to overpay or undersell compared to the average player. I understand how rorq proliferation also makes hull prices cheaper I've seen that as well.
---
Ultimately we don't want extreme faucets or infinitely scalable mining, or at least not how it used to be with little to no risk because you can always light a cyno and have a few dozen supers dropped on you.
---
In that sense the cynogeddon and blackout changes are positives, they're not supposed to fix the issue, but as a result of them PLEX prices will get lower, hulls are currently cheap due to angry firesales, and eventually people who spend the time and effort playing the game actively taking risks for rewards should make more value per hour. That's what I want it's pretty simple and should be pretty uncontroversial.
---
Let them gate all over nullsec only to find system after empty system    I’m happily playing WoW and having fun.
---
They need to get their subcount up somehow so Hilmer can get his nice bonus
---
Which is why I won't be fooled twice.
---
That gave me chills. The irony. Thank you.
---
What kind of ships can light the industrial cyno? Is it all ships or just industrials? I thought it was only going to be covert ops ships or something. People were talking about cyno manticores.
---
Well, of course the wait has to be deterministic, either knowing in advance how much wall clock time it will take, or some measure of work to be performed. Otherwise you might just as well use an animation that's completely unconnected with the process the user is waiting on. The first condition holds for the warp vector establishment here, so it should be straightforward to make a progress bar that accurately reflects the remaining time to warp while also updating at a constant rate.
---
The situation is more complicated if you're doing some processing on a rowset or similar, where the time to process a row is not necessarily uniform. But you can still make the progress bar length reflect the fraction of rows that have been processed.
---
We poke LXQ all the time. I never said poke the keepstar itself, anything else in the system works. Gate bubbles, jump bridges, cyno beacons all work.
---
Cyberbullying is not funny either and i think you should stop being mean to Hilmar.
---
Us alphas are second class citizen freeloaders. We deserve what the game gives us. 3m isk, a venture, and a boot out the door.
---
Oof. U right tho
---
Anyone with a video including Elos rants?  I’m bored at work
---
Your family is in our prayers friend.
---
Actually I see his point... You'd know how many people are in a region (could also be constellation) but never exactly where they are. You'd feel like you had players around you but not 100% accurate Intel.
---
Dude. If the devs of this game are giving you trust issues *this badly* then you can quit. It’s a video game.
---
You could do that with text... just change the status message from "aligning to *X*" to "aligned with *X*."

---
The worst part is chance encounters are gone. Most communication is now done outside of the game instead of ingame and that killed the interactions with people you didnt usually talk to. Not to mention that there isnt even a point in having local up so you wouldnt know if people tried to communicate with you.
---
People argue that interactions became more prevalent with these changes but it just feels like playing a single player game. A boring one.
---
That's pretty thin, Valk.
---
You would have every human that had ever had any kind of dream message or shamanic vision pigeonholed into the god complex/narcisist box with that logic.

Rat with a friend in system that has a cyno recon alt. Just reach out, I'm sure there is someone in your corp or alliance that would love to have an instant fax assured for defence and maybe a second carrier too (if your willing to warp it in). You both make isk, and you both can get mutual protection from the Fax and potentially from the other carrier as well. And neither of you needs more than 2 accounts. Maybe your friend would have a third account too that he could throw on a likely ingate for eyes.
---
EVE has a large military userbase in general. It just tends to attract that kind of person.
---
If you buy a titan pilot from another player, it's just that, a titan pilot. The account changes owners, not much else happens there.
---
If you buy injectors from another player to make a new titan pilot, there's now one whole new titan pilot in the game.
---
You're correct, from the perspective of the buyer, the difference is minimal - you end up with an 80m sp character you can do whatever you wish to.
---
The difference is where it actually comes from, and how it impacts the game situation - in the first case, by very little, because, as I said, it just changes ownership. The second case leads to capital proliferation that's been slowly but surely killing nullsec, and enables people to kick-start massive alt farms for rorqs/ratting/botting.
---
TL;DR - Injectors are inherently harmful for the game, when the rich and high-sp characters get to use them.
---
OMG! You might have to play the game as intended?!?!?
---
Good riddance.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe we should take it at face value and be concerned that he is sounding the alarm, something he has not done before.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Goons dislike this because it's bad for them. Never seen any genuine concern for the health of the game from a goon.
---
&gt;&gt;As proved by the MER these changes have barely affected goons. You can't separate your bias from facts and will literally support any change that sticks it to goons and nullsec as a whole.
---
&gt;I dont know when they moved in or out. Not sure why I should care so much about that. The MER isn't the only metric.
---
Can you stop moving the goal post here.
---
Wow how convenient. I just finished training into a fax. I don't have a cyno alt but if you give me your fax I can just welp it.
---
cheers mate
---
Being on Reddit gives you that ability, it seems.
---
A few months ago i roamed for 4 hours in an NPSI fleet. I think it was late December or early January,  so during the holiday season, but not on an actual holiday day where people do family stuff or go out and return with hangovers. 
---
 You would expect to see a lot of players, right?
---
Moving for 4 hours across multiple nullsec pockets in the south and southeast of the map, all we could find was a handful of VNIs. I think we did end up killing some big stuff eventually at the very end of the roam right before we decided to end it (a rorq or a carrier or something), but for the majority of the initial 4 hours of the roam, there were less than 10 targets out in space. I shit you not.
---
Nullsec has always been relatively empty apart from specific concentrations of players, but what i saw that day was really surprising. And it was a long time before the blackout too.
---
I think it's because people just don't undock that much anymore. Until recently it was so easy to play reactively to any threats coming into your space, that proactive gameplay was not necessary. A few years ago people camped the entrances to their space and you were guaranteed a fight simply by trying to get your foot in the door. Nowadays they just wait for a ping on discord from a ratter/miner who got tackled.
---
&gt; Just because you sit in something big, doesn't mean that 100 players in smaller ships should be unable to kill you.
---
just because there's 100 of you, doesn't mean some dude in his big ship shouldn't be able to face fuck you all back to your home station.
---

Its been like this way way way way longer.

The only difference now is that you dont even see the VNI bots anymore while going towards the staging.
---
Small gangs, response fleets, gatecamps -  these all died 2-3 years ago. Welcome to why everyone has been complaining about the state of the game.
---
Thank you! Chilling for now to prepare for the next one.
---
Well mostly because it's my first project and already includes api access and excel parsing
---
I see cloaked ships everywhere in 0.0.
---
Space doesn’t feel lonely at all. How can you feel lonely with a stealth bomber creeping towards you wherever you are, whenever you undock?
---
I've bumped into players who are ex and current military that are within every major alliance
---
Oof.
---
I knew it maaaaan

Everyone, primary on the Scorditan!!

This was caused by travel interceptors becoming ubiquitous.

Loved drake for ratting, actually my first time ratting in null I used her. We'll see. .

That intention would have been nice to know years in advance instead of weeks.

 Aww, thanks CCP Falcon. &lt;3

I'm predicting it to hit zero a bit after 7:00 AM in my time zone.

Only the biggest of retards can look at a post from 20 hours ago then post current player numbers and think that makes any sense

Be a man and biomass. Anything else is childish blackmail and grandstanding. If not- then you prove my point.
---
Data is beautiful
---
ChaOs ErA
---
Similar feeling after seeing people react to it. Wasn't expecting all the wild imaginations. lol
---
Thanks man. :D
---
What do you mean nowdays? It was the same in dominion sov when you flew through certain regions.
---
How was this any different than before blackout and cyno changes?
---
The truth  is: these small alliances will pack light. When you come rolling in 500 feroxes. You will get zero fights. All you get is uncontested Astra bashes that yield garbage loot. You will complain  about how the game is dead and there is zero content. Which further proves the point that the problem lies with these null blobs containing half the server in fleets.
---
Meanwhile, small alliances won't give a flying fuck and move on elsewhere. Because they don't care about rooting their selves in null. They want small scale localized content and they will go wherever you aren't to find it.
---
Big brain stuff right there. Happy cake day btw
---
Not your diary btw
---
I was just going through my old emails and found some diplomatic dialogue I had with him in 09 rest well vile.
---
Lots of MMOs lose players over time.  They just merge servers to keep populations dense.....  oh.
---
Nevermind.
---
It's certainly not the first time people that buy their way into overpowered stuff only to have it nerfed out from under them. Happens in every MMO.
---
Granted it doesn't usually take 3 years, but that's CCP.
---
Perhaps, but then burning bridges implies a silly level of confidence in what you may want in the future, and CCP may yet come to their senses reverse the cyno changes I take issue with.
---
No it's more rational to unsub and perhaps check back in every month or two and see the direction the game has taken.
---
That poor astero deserved better than to be fit with a dirty shield tank.

People are rewarded for chores, ie: not living in a shithole.

Ok. You're toxic.

Nullified ceptors ruined gate camping. I used to do it all the time because people traveled in a bomber or maybe a nullified T3 (which you had a shot at decloaking) or just a combat capable ship. 
---
In Goons our ratting fits were garbage and people could hunt them solo easily. Then Sa Matra/Poitot dot started hunting them in nullified uncatchable ceptors and we had to improve our ishtar/VNI fits so two ceptors couldn't kill them. After that he went to 4 ceptors and our ratting fits got better. Our ratting fits were now really hard for a solo roamer to kill, we stopped gate camping because it was just ceptors flying all around the place and you couldn't catch them. So we were in space a lot less and ratters were harder to kill so people were discouraged from solo roaming so they started doing ceptor/bomber fleets. 
---
The ceptor changes were really what pushed Goons into our current style of umbrella ratting because solo roamers were no longer the threat we had to deal with, it was large groups. There's really no reason to gate camp because large groups are more rare and they don't gate around anyway, and even if they did they'd blow your camp up. 
---
Anyway, this is a long explanation about how one bad design decision that doesn't *seem* like it could really hurt the game easily can. And we said this at the time they came out, but CCP couldn't hear our words.

It could be made simple to implement, if containers have a column for a flag meaning "contains something damaged." But DBAs might have reason to not want that, if it's not already there. And if it's not, adding it might not be simple...

I lived in a shattered for over a year.  There is another Corp that lives in a c6 and has zero structures. Another Corp does have structures but they cant dock.  Eve player gonna do what they do

Thank you for linking my KB, what's your point?

yet, it's gonna kill the primo Tenerifis/Detorid war content even faster if they keep on adding enemies to attack them.

Eh, traditionally a lot of cartoons used to transform objects into characters too.
---
Some of the best ideas have come to people in a state of sleep. Look it up psychologist-wannabe. 
---
On a side note, I think this is very interesting. Eve will eventually die, we all know that. All products die. So why not try to invent it into something else, something no one's imagined? That seems to me that's what he's thinking. Could be genius, could be foolhardy. But judging by the types of enemy's he's making, he's doing something right.
---
Just quit the game and go back to your delicate world.
---
Thank you!
---
&gt;With local, if you are watching the screen at all, and there is a friendly Upwell structure in system, there is absolutely no risk if you're not in a site with scrams (which no anomaly has). You can 100% guarantee safety by clicking 'Warp To' when someone comes into local.
---
This is such bullshit. You're basically saying its ok for hunters to be lazy as fuck, but not ok for PVE'ers. Hunters step up their game, log off and log back in, actually work a little. Just because local may give a ratter an advantage in intel, doesnt mean a hunter has no chance at killing them. 
---
&gt; The game needs krabs, sure. But they should be doing something active (and fun), not something AFK and expect to be saved by a free intel mechanic. The rewards for that PVE can also be better if there is a higher risk. 
---
The blackout has swung  the pendulum waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too far with no local, essentially killing PVE in nullsec. Bots have moved to highsec. Mining has all but ended. The amount of players online has dropped consistently. I agree that PVE needs an iteration to make it more fun, but destroying it isnt the answer.

WELCOME TO DELVE MOTHERFUCKER
---
I'm actually intrigued by it. It seems to show he has a vision that he's not quit comfortable communicating nor understands completely.
---
I have a reaper fitted up in x-7 named vile rat. Moved it from UMI im tribute after lighting a cyno every 10 minutes for hours. Mostly unattended assuming it would die. The community came together on that dreadful day to morn the loss of a great man. Maybe he RIP.
---
You can go to any source you want. The symptoms are the same.
---
I mean, capitals have been in the game since December 2005, and ever since then they've outclasses subcaps in just about every way possible, held only in check by the relative difficulty of obtaining one. For 14 years you could move your own capitals with just a cyno alt flying any ship, usually one that was elusive like a ceptor, then all of this changes with 3 weeks warning.
---
You would also have to slow everything way down then. Otherwise you are going to be spending most of your time banging into walls.
---
You do know how fast ships in eve go, right?
---
Typing a mix of uppercase and lowercase doesn't prove your point.
---
Yes, he should be able to tank them for quite a while and kill quite a few. But in the end he should die if he doesn't get backup, the same a way a lone tank dies to an infantry squad with an AT weapon in the real world, or aircraft carriers routinely get shafted in NATO exercises by submarines if their escorts are not up to the job. But noooo, you just want to solo everything in your pwnmobile.
---
Too bad, because the game's been built with rock-paper-scissors gameplay in mind and it's been a foundation of pvp mechanics from the get go. The fact that capital ships became a one-stop solution for every single job around and have effectively been shitting on all other classes for years doesn't make it normal. It's an imbalance that has to be fixed and it has cost us more players over the last decade than the recent changes have cost us in a few months.
---
Your allergy to everything asymmetrical in the game is exactly the reason we get a boring meta with only two valid counters:
---
n+1, just bring more people
---
OR
---
hard counters, just bring 100 bombers with booshers.
---
And guess what, most people whine about that too. Well, if someone whines about a problem and then also whines about the solutions offered, maybe he doesn't want a solution. Maybe he just wants his own playstyle to be the best with the minimal amount of effort, to the detriment of everything else. Well, good riddance to such a guy.
---
Blackout is not good for the game because there are no krabs to kill anymore. Like I said in my last reply to you. Hunters need to stop being lazy as fuck and expecting people to just sit in an anom to be picked off. Log out and wait for them to warp back in. Find the anom they are in and wait on the in gate and then instantly warp to them. There are so many different ways to catch people, but all you are saying is its impossible, which is demonstrably bullshit.

The OP stated he plexed an account to train for a fax, not *inject* into a fax.
---
The only one really spinning here is me. There is no propaganda-squad like Goons or someone else may have it. I have discussed some things with my CEO's who could add and correct a thing or two.(Like that fact FC's rather went for a shiny Titan kill than for a boring i-hub) Of course I'm biased as well. 
---
To be fair, the ones that said they would "conquer Detorid" was [FI.RE](https://FI.RE) originally in their gathering in February 2019: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZk5EnVEBp0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZk5EnVEBp0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2048) "To rally behind a common cause."   
---
I don't think they would have done this without being certain Legacy would be joining them later.
---
Thank you!!
---
lmao you weren't even in test when that blacklist went up
---
this sub used to have plenty of propaganda, gloating, information, intelligent shit talking and banter w/o the constant whining, complaining, and shitting on people like a 15yo call of duty player.
---
I wonder if you just self-diagnosed... 🤔
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
I've been having lag opening the character sheet, and quite often it seems like the client is dropping right-clicks.
---
You don't name a city after the Sotiyo in Tama if you're expecting it to be a safe place.
---
LXQ isn't the norm, horde goes out of its way to welcome smaller groups by banning cap drops against neutral entities.
---
Unless you've been active on alts you haven't been active since June. Even back then you'd know the only places you'll get fights in null without the umbrella getting dropped are horde space and maybe test space.
---
So... You've jumped on the soap box crying blackmail with your subscription. If you wanna leave the game, do it properly. Let others enjoy the game without the shrill crying from bitter krabs.
---
This would be excellent for Faction Warfare pvp and missions.
---
Haha yeah bro NC. Is so dumb for not fighting us 2 to 1 in titans what a bunch of Dumbos
---
remember remember the 9th of november..
---
Maybe you're looking at a cached version???
---
as long as you are having fun gaming, i dont see any problem.  I dont know why you feel free to come here and post about your love of WOW, do you post in the WOW subreddit about EVE?
---
https://www.militarygamers.com/ has a pretty active in game corp. They were just tossed out of the imperium though.
---
Nobody said it was an annual figure. I assumed he was talking about lifetime. Actually, for all I know it could have included the PA sale price, too.
---
It's been almost two years since I last played EVE, has there been any notable change to PvE and have there been any improvements to Faction Warfare/Lowsec?  Kinda have the itch to play again but don't want to spend a dozen hours getting back up to speed and collecting all my scattered shit just to find it's still basically the same as before.
---
&gt; But in the end he should die if he doesn't get backup
---
no he shouldn't. assymetrical warfare you see. oh, you mean, you only want that when it benefits you? got it.
---
but EVE is full of political garbage
---
they get rewarded for doing the dishes and making their laundry? well, they get rewarded with clean dishes and laundry i suppose.
---
Thanks mate! Haha, it's all good.. (was expecting worse) I don't have anything against anime/manga, in fact I like Japanese's style too, it's just for my work I like to first improve on proper uhh.. proportion and anatomy? before going to heavily stylised art.
---
same tbh
---
Sure, but 90% of corps that live in C5/C4/whatever and use structures to store their shit would be pretty peeved. The population that regularly use wormholes would probably fall drastically as a results and a gameplay style would have been killed.
---
Basically, I played 2006-2008, and then a bit in 2013. Now back again. It's... not that different really. I certainly didn't feel like I was starting over other than socially. I mean sure, there's quite a few more options on what to do compared to 2008, but compared to 2013 it's much the same from my point of view at least except less players, and even more cap proliferation - not that I even ventured to 0.0 in 2013. I managed to find a group doing subcap roams in 0.0 and it's kinda like being back in 2008 again, other than not having to worry about capitals much back then. In high-sec I've done the occasional mission, trading and Invasion, so pretty much same ol'.
---
I don't disagree that it's hurried and unplanned. I just think they are afraid to do what really needs to be done.
---
I mean, just look at all the whining over a couple of inconveniences. Now imagine what would happen if they actually tackled the important stuff like nerfing citadels, asset safety and damage application of caps to subcaps.
---
im okay with that
---
I agree and disagree with this post. But I get what you are saying.  It still feels lonelier to me.
---
He was one of the victims of the attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi a few years ago
---
I've always thought having hictors only do it would be a good compromise. Forces you to field an expensive ship if you want to catch nullified ships.
---
The "shit" your are referring to was a single Ratiaru in Immensea, anchored by a neutral corp. The same corp that also tried to anchor Ratiarus in Detorid, Insmother and other places.

There's a difference between stupid backstabbing and smart backstabbing. Smart backstabbing is what happened to Band of Brothers a decade ago. Stupid backstabbing is what Fraternity has a habit of doing.

How is that pythons fault? You can write and run asynchronous code with python. I imagine the issue is a single process/worker per system, but that's got nothing to do with python . 
---
Maybe it did when it was written though, I'm not sure how new the async code is.

Blackout had a bigger effect on me than I realized. It's like ship spinning. I never realized how important it was until it was gone.
---
The silence of nullsec today is terrible. I did not realize how much the random shit-talking in passing actually mattered to me. How important the local spam actually was at making the game feel occupied. Somehow what I would have once called toxic I now realize was actually important.
---
I like this suggestion. It forces the camper to commit to that spot for at least a bit if he wants to stop the nullified ship.
---
You're the one who accuses me of arguing that most of the players that left were bots in this thread *despite the fact that I never said that*.
---
Before you could chitchat in local for non opsec things or to shittalk. Now if you talk in local you are giving away free intel so nobody does it.
---

If you're talking about hisec, it's hardly "near-perfect" safety; Concord exists to punish, not protect. If you're flying something worth more than the catalysts required to kill it, the threat of that punishment won't save you from being ganked. 
---
If you dare to put up a structure, you get wardecced, which negates Concord's "protection" anyways. Wardec-spamming hisec gankers make high-traffic areas of hisec the most dangerous space in EVE for any entity that owns a structure. It's telling that nullsec alliances typically discourage their members from going to hisec, but have no such restrictions against traveling through any other area of space.
---
Then there's the fact that hisec is like a demo version of EVE; you only get a fraction of the features and gameplay it offers, not to mention income and opportunities for pvp (other than being ganked). Playing in hisec is like being a not-quite-ordinary citizen in one of the NPC empires; it's boring and unprofitable. 
---
Ultimately, regardless of what labels you or I come up with, this is a game and it's up to each individual person to decide whether or not he/she is having enough fun to continue playing. Limiting the amount of fun people are allowed to have is going to result in less of them deciding that the game is still worth playing, which in turn makes the game even less fun for those who remain (note that I'm talking about the impact of overall player numbers here, not the specific impact of one particular person leaving). 
---
Focusing on making the game fun for people whose idea of "fun" is ruining other peoples' fun is a zero-sum game at best, and it's a large part of the reason EVE is in the state it's in today. 
---
...that last sentence sounded weird; never use the word "fun" three times in one sentence.
---
LOL, well yeah I suppose. It would be horrible if we took over the world.
---
Hmm now that you mention it, there's been an annoying delay when I use stargates. I'll just land in range as watch my ship just sitting there like 1 or 2 seconds, then it jumps. Feels dangerous
---
I admit it's a bit unfair to blame Legacy for the "lack of progress" when it indeed was [FI.RE](https://FI.RE) that claimed to "[conquer Detorid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZk5EnVEBp0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2048)". I highly doubt they would have declared war on WinterCo if they weren't certain Legacy would join in soon(tm).
---
Hmm, hard to say but maybe Hilmar wasn't referring to annual revenue, but rather total revenue since the game launched?
---
Just click a item, "repair item" and it filters. It's fine.

&gt;I care that we have to wade through countless shitty posts to find good shitposts

Welcome to Reddit?
---
bye felicia, pay to win doesn't work in EVE and complaining on reddit doesn't work either.

if you were truly happy you wouldn't be here, i know cause i quite Destiny and wasn't truly done with it until i stopped visiting the sub-reddit.
---
He doesn't have a god complex, he is a factual god of eve who has any and all powers to do with it as he pleases. Having dreams about shit you think about a lot is common, do you not dream?
---
You're right, when it scales up you're limited to deploying a counter cap fleet of your own, but null escalations have always been n+1 I don't think there's anyway around that honestly.
---
That link literally opens up with today as the most recent kills...
---
Its almost like EVE is dying because of the players...
---
what about corp chat/alliance chat?   What about discord/teamspeak ?   You all still have your intel bots so you know when people are in system... just start chatting, its not hard

only the biggest of retards think patchday numbers will be like a normal day.

Thank you for pointing out how underrated it is. We all thank you for your service.

Reasons for blackout somewhere and somewhere not has had plenty of discussion and reasoning...
---
You naive.
---
For me it was get shot by blues tell Vile Rat. o7
---
Only the biggest retards join pl and cant read numbers
---
No, he really doesn't have the power to do with it as he pleases. PA can fire him for idiocy, and for the health and longevity of this game, that would be the best outcome. Suiciding Eve isn't the answer.
---
Reminder: todays date is 2019-09-11.... thanks
---
The things that pushed you into umbrella ratting were the same things that would have pushed you into any other kind of FOTY n+1 playstyle.
---
Your will to "win eve" ultimately puts you into a position where you have to cater to the lowest common denominator and exploit the n+1 susceptibility. There is literally nothing that could be changed about the game and you wouldn´t end up exploiting it in the most min/maxed way possible with as much people as possible. What else would you do? After all you´re here to ruin everyone elses game. To bad that when you shit in the sandbox for long enough you end up being the only one left playing in it. 
---
It´s not like this is news for anyone who has played in any kind of sandbox ever. It might have taken a long time with Eve due to its complexity. But in the end the results are always the same.
---

---
&gt; if containers have a column for a flag meaning "contains something damaged."
---
I'm pretty sure there's just "item hp" that's stored, and whether it's damaged is simply (item hp &lt; total hp) and it's probably calculated in the client. 
---
I've noticed screwy situations before where the item hp goes negative, so a numerical value for the item hp makes sense to me, compared to something like a boolean value to indicate "is damaged" or whatever. After all they still need the item hp, so no need to store another value that would need to be recalculated on the server every time the item hp changes.
---
Bullshit, some of the data posts have been quite in depth, concise and relevant. Unfortunately the numpties on this sub just don't want a bad word said against eve, even if it is in the hope of fixing the haemorrhage.
---
Good point with the Titan bridges.
---
I still think Fortizars are not really cheap. Ratirus ans Astrahus', yeah, true. For a block that's not really expensive. 
---
I understand FC's that don't want to risk relative expensive stuff when there is no important thing to fight over.   
---
But when 30 Caracals with Logi dock up against 15 Feroxes with three T2 logi, then I'm just a bit sad.

---
Well yes, I wasn't very clear in my comment, I didn't mean to make it sound like "it's the only reasonable thing and that's the end of that"; I agree changes probably need to be made to make it reasonable for big blobs to fight each other. If it's true that most 0.0 systems are basically empty, even though someone evidently holds sov there anyway, then that seems like a strange state of affairs to me.
---
Commerce isn't that complicated. You make a product, then people buy it or they don't. Only Maoists tell customers what they are allowed to buy.
---
Actually humans are really lazy. Moving to Delve was objectively the right move for Goons and it was proposed long before the Casino War but it took all of Eve to get us to do the thing that in the long term made us much stronger. We were arms-raced into umbrella ratting by CCP introducing new ways and us adapting. But I doubt we would have done it had we not been forced to.
---
The kind of response that happens when someone confronts the truth about themselves. Hopefully this helps you stop being so toxic, lets see.

Wow, you can't even keep track of who you are arguing with. You were arguing with CesarioBTW and accused him of using a strawman argument. The only thing we are arguing about in this chain is you crying about strawman arguments because you don't have a point to make.

---
the issue is we were being inaccurate here. EVE isn't written in python, it's written in stackless python. since i'm lazy i'm just gonna link the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stackless_Python)
---
Actually there is no way that exists which gives scaling effective hitpoints to a ship based on how much you throw at it. What's logi going to do to a ship that melts under dreadfire?
---
Okay, but you mentioned rorqs *specifically*, then compared their ISK/hr to L4s and incursions. You're not even on the same page with your own posts.
---
it just seems people can't identify a joke
---
Really? What for?
---
I see the die hard CCP White Knights appearing here to rally against the OP because he is just stating how many feel. 
---
To all you telling this guy to "get lost" or "reeeee bye"... perhaps see the effect that this is having and rahrah at CCP instead. This game just made it over 20k (20,020) players online peak today. 
---
#20k!!! 
---
This is a difinitive sign that this game is fail cascading and soon to be gone. You might feel it is edgy to shame everyone coming here to vent their frustrations of your beloved game, but just know that with each thread like this is a step closer to being no game to talk about anymore. 
---
Just "error 404 not found"...
---
CCP makes null to where it encourges being on coms and working together 24/7 meanwhile the killed companionship?
---
Are you saying these changes are primarily intended to hurt Goons and nullsec for the sake of hurting them?
---
This. Under-Underrated comment.
---
Mate I can't tell if you're joking or not...
---
I fuckin hope you are
---
Stargates, docking, undocking, anything session change related has gotten super bad lately. And yeah.. character sheet too for sure.
---
&gt; Actually humans are really lazy
---
Yeah, that´s what im saying. And when the rose tinted glasses come off after the intial phase of awe and wonder and "oh, the possbilities" people either get bored and quit, decide they like the gameplay so much that they are willing to comit to non optimal playstyles or keep pushing to become the dominant factor by doing the good old lazy n+1ing. All are valid choices. The last one will ultimately tank the game because as soon as you reach critical mass the appeal to *FoRge yOur owN pasS to GreAtneSs* will become unassailable for those who come after you. And that is what makes most sandboxes work in the first place. It´s also what ultimatetly kills them.
---
Let me shoot it daddy, uwu
---
No idea what CCP is thinking, but I'm absolutely certain that's why a huge amount here are cheering them on.
---
actually shield tank astero's are awesome - Look up Stunt's fits and kills.  I am guessing you flew straight at him.  You need to get under his guns, try and manually pilot and 'spiral' towards a target so you dont get face smaked by arty.
---
Cull the weak from the herd
---
"nobody has come up with a reason for blackout in null and not low, and high for that matter." CCP itself game the reason in the announcement. And even without that f you think about it for even a fraction of a second, it's obvious why it's null and not somewhere else. For that matter a lot people were asking for no local in null well over ten years ago already.
---
Nobody told him that corp chat exists.

Funny, that's what the liberals tell me when I complain about them taking away my rights.

You can do quite a bit with 40 dedicated players.  Good luck.

Best to join an established alliance to have a feel at null sec life (logistics, dynamics, politics, fleet structures). If you like it, stay, if not, you can make your own moves sometime next year.
---
If you want to go in independently, you will have to take into consideration several things: 
---
\- Regional politics.
---
\- Are you moving into NPC null or want to have a go at holding Sov?
---
\- What TZs are you strong points and how that blends with the neighborhood.
---
\- You strengths (sub caps, skirmishing, drops, hunting, supers, etc)
---
Review where you are and where you want to be.
---
Regardless of what steps you want to take, really recommend the merger option.
---
If you don’t have friends, don’t be in null.

It rivals the most sophisticated analysis of the Bitcoin market.
---
No. I'm in FW.
---
I used to sub 3 accounts and plex a fourth. I did this for the last year, until a few months ago. Plexxing the one was all I was able due to work but with the changes since Chaos all my accounts are alpha. 
---
Im winning Eve now and playing other mmos that value my time instead of sucking me dry financially. I’ll never leave this subreddit tho. It’s filled with too much good shitposting and salt.
---
I took Psych 101, and I can confidently diagnose OP as a fucking idiot.
---
Lol, you have no idea about how the game has worked since 2003. I guess you're one of the recent additions who injected directly into the big stuff.
---
Also, words. Learn their meaning before posting. Asymmetric simply means using dissimilar stuff to counter other stuff. It doesn't guarantee a win in every case, it's your own job to decide which is a good counter and which is not and adapt to it. Having a single class that counters everything kills all of that decision process though. You can't rely on bringing the exact same thing every time and expecting (or even worse, demanding) that it will work equally well in all situations, it just reeks of bad game design on CCP's part and laziness on the player's part.
---
Eg, say you get dropped by bombers and bring more caps to counter. That asymmetric but maybe a bad counter. Bringing in an anti-frig fleet (like beam confessors) to swat the bombers out of the sky is also asymmetric but it's a good counter.
---
The part of the asymmetry that benefits the big ship is that it has more tank and more raw DPS. The disadvantage is that it's a big, slow, fat target that is forced to commit to a fight once engaged.
---
The part of the asymmetry that benefits the small ships is that they are maneuverable with good damage application (but lower raw DPS) and can choose their engagements. The disadvantage is that if someone manages to land hits on them, they die easily.
---
If the small ships are not enough, the big ship wins. If the small ships are 50-100, the big ship losses. Every. Single. Time.
---
It's been like that since forever, it makes sense and it's balanced gameplay.
---
If you want a one-shot win button because you maxed out a certain skill tree, there are other games that work that way. But not EvE. It has never worked that way. It has moved in the direction heavily (and lost a few thousand players in the process over the year) but never worked 100% that way. And by the looks of it, it's about to move back to its roots.
---
Yes, you can. Most people who do a lot of PVP keep a stock of replacement ships in wherever their home bases are for this purpose and, depending on the ship, it's generally fairly easy to replace most PVP-fit ships (PVP people tend to fly cheaper ships than PVE people, with the exception of C5 wormhole PVP groups who are rolling in vastly more money than they know what to do with, PVE people such as Incursion runners tend to be in much less danger, so the risk  of losing some extremely expensive officer-fit pirate battleship is much less significant relative to the potential reward). Most player-run corporations and alliances which do a lot of PVP have some sort of Ship Replacement Program which is basically insurance, paying you back for ships which you lose flying with them (amount depends on the organization, wealthier groups pay you back larger portions of its value).
---
In general, you shouldn't undock something for PVP unless you can be sure that you can afford to get right back in the fight with another after it inevitably gets destroyed. There are plenty of ships which you can set up to be cost-effective for that.
---
But I have two most important pieces of advice for a brand-new player.
---
1. For the love of God and all that is holy, stay away from this subreddit until you've gotten a feel for the game. It's mostly people who haven't played in years but can't get over it like it was a bad breakup.
---
2.  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University) Join these guys for at least a couple of months and figure out what you like doing in the game, then move to some other organization depending on what you like doing. Don't just go straight to a Null group as soon as you get started even though they take anyone who hasn't already gotten caught spying or stealing and provide some pretty nice benefits. Most of the complaining comes from people who got into those groups through the policy of recruiting N+1 warm bodies. Those complainers act like because they joined those organizations, they are entitled to the game being easy for them even if that results in the game becoming stagnant and boring (which also happens to be why they quit a year ago or more). It's best to just ignore the people complaining about how what was supposed to be the hardest space that could actually be lived in isn't some risk-free environment, especially when they're acting like the developers are catering to the people who live in space which was intended to be impossible to live in simply by trying to reassert that this is supposed to be the most dangerous, most lucrative part of normal space, not the safest, most lucrative part of normal space.
---
you can do relic site exploration in null/wh, hunt clone soldiers in low, do low level ded sites in low, all of which will net you a decent amount of isk with minimal sp and experience
---
if the game points you towards the window, don't jump out of the window. go the opposite way and do some research
---
Turns out the "EVE is dying" crowd has been right all along, since the game dies every damn day.
---
Honestly, no one is. This game does not do moderate individuals justice. If you are extraordinary, then you are just another small statistic. The first time I took a long break from Eve, which was in 2012, was when I realized I had no way to fight back against a group of 5-7 other players by myself. They could just cover you in debilitating Ewar, neut out your defenses and hold you down while they used a microlaser to kill you as slow as possible while insulting you in local. Numerical superiority has always been what mattered in this game, you'd think we'd have learned that in the Great War.
---
Fair enough. Actually that's a surprisingly good Roosevelt quote, I'm surprised I haven't heard it yet.
---
Wait, you think the sub IS representative of the in game community?
---
There was a counter to nullified cepters - the old Svipul, but seems everyone here forgot how good they were, then CCP hit them with the usual nerfbat. The counter was there, but knowing CCP, that was probably a complete accident.
---
&gt;Your definition of minimal and the hours I spend doing PvE in high sec to buy ships for the minutes I spend to do PvP in low and null do not jive. I think your out of touch.
---
You're doing the wrong kind of PVE, then.
---
daily reminder that jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams
---
shooting blues today for vile rat.
---
ofc the ore calculator is german, whatelse would it be
---
That's an interesting perspective. I was surprised too coming back to the game after 12 years and seeing nullification, i was going "hmmm, what's that, let's see".
---
Then i immediately thought, "why give the fastest ship class in the game another evasion tool?", lol. I can see it making some sense for the tackler ceptors (like it is today) since they are usually the point-men and scouts and on the T3Cs (since they carry an actual SP loss risk to balance it out), but having it on the hard-hitting ceptors as well must have been a bit too much.
---
I stopped logging In just to see how low the numbers can go.
---
Can I have your stuff
---
It would probably be figured out and put on Anoik.is within a week, tbh
---
There should be an award that you can give out that somehow takes money away from the poster.
---
It's a step in the right direction, I think, but I don't think it entirely solves the problem you mentioned. At the medium-zoom-level range your ship is barely visible and you can make out the enemy battleships alright.
---
I don't think there's a clear or perfect solution, but at least the Abyssal space is a reminder that you can *or maybe should* zoom in once in a while to appreciate the visuals more.
---
This comment is a dual sided blade though, when you understand the big blocs steer away. Don’t join the big blue donut, you will be starved for content.
---
The blackout does have "unintended" side effects assuming the purpose is to combat bots, but I think the cyno changes are necessary and most would probably agree.
---
There should also be an award for people in complete denial when the facts are right there for all to see.

---

---
Yes. I do think that I mentioned that in the post. A lot of things would need to be adjusted, but the gameplay would still be mostly the same. 5k would feel essentially like 70k and 500m would feel like 10k. The only real difference would be that you can actually see the other ship you are fighting.
---
What this game needs is a massive mechanics and game infrastructure overhaul, absurd infusion of new players to play with, a rebalancing of materials and how they are used, and more ways to inflict meaningful losses on your enemy without profiting directly from them. Not people patting each other on the back like a make shift suicide ward.
---
I'm just waiting the next patch say. Capitals can't enter anomalies to rat. I will be here to collect tears.
---
O the salt. Them I will congratulate CCP
---
You have no idea how many chat channels i'm in. lol
---
I do respect this opinion and I blame CCP for letting the game get to a point where capital and supercap ships are viewed as legitimate tools for solo activities. They need to revert to requiring support and that is going to be painful.
---
On the Esi page some endpoints have a lock next to them. These require auth and show which scope is needed when you hover over that lock.
---
I used to sub two accounts and plex over a dozen, but after the blackout changes and now these cyno changes, I've abandoned my fleet of ishtars and have cut my accounts down to four. I'm not making the stupid amounts of isk that I was, but I'm actually interacting with people more and enjoying it. Maybe this is killing the game, maybe not; but I'm having more fun than I was. I'll ride this wave as far as it goes.

Jump Fatigue was introduced in 2014.

No, you don't. Maybe you wasn't there at the time, or you didn't care as all PVP players. PVP is low-iq requirement after all.
---
Not at all, but you of all people calling others toxic is just comedy gold and hypocrisy at its finest.
---
you seem to be reading a different sub forum from me. /r/eve has been all eve is dying for.. well, for more than half the games lifespan. seems the bs might be between your ears xD
---
I can understand why people are down voting the suggestion, but really if everything were to change like i mentioned, sans maybe the flying your own ship aspect, gameplay would feel exactly the same. The only difference would be that since everything is closer and slower, you can actually see the ships you are fighting. Kiting in an INS would still FEEL the same, but instead of being at 30kish you are at 5k, etc.
---
Kiting is inherently dishonorobru it was your true self telling you to sacrifice that shit to BoB. But seriously what was the mental process there? Wouldn't he have not tracked even at 20 k if you orbited? Or the bloom from the shield tank and MWD fucks it?
---
I cannot tell if you are that delusional or just uneducated.
---
I ran down to the store the other day to pick up a few bags of groceries. Almond milk, three deluxe cartons of duck eggs, a kielbasa and an extra large bag of kettlecorn that I'd consume in one hideous and obscene transgressive act of sinful gluttony and carnality while watching women's tennis. You know, the usuals.
---
Anyways, I roll up to the store in my '93 Camaro, rust-speckled as it is, and walk through the cool sliding doors into the local Kroger. Me and the Kroger staff are tight with each other ever since I was arrested for freebasing methadone in the back of a flatbed out in the parking lot one July evening, and as I entered the store, I waved to them. The girl at the register closest to the door avoids my eyes, as she is intimidated by my rugged masculinity and well-massed frame. Before I can compliment how luscious her skin looks today, who do I see out of my eye except the one and only Valkorsia, perusing the cucumber stand in the produce section. A particularly girthy member is in his hands here today, but it is not that which I have eyes for.
---
I break into a slow jog towards the man, my long locks flowing in the wind as if I'm on the set of Baywatch, spilling spare Tostito's corn chips and a pack pack of mango-flavored Juul pods to the ground. "Valkorsia," I bellow at him. "I told you never to come here again!" I unsheath my flamberge, the fine Scottish steel rippling in the light refracting off of the misty spray that is keeping plums and lettuce heads moist in the carefully climate-controlled room. One of us is going to die here amid the peaches and sandy-looking pears of the Kroger produce section today.
---
Valkorsia looks up scornfully from his cucumber that he is cradling like a newborn babe. He drops it to the floor and assumes a tactically wide stance towards my dashing form. With a dead look written upon his face, his eyes roll back into his skull and his jaw unhinges, his frame lunging forward towards me.
---
Sensing the danger, I duck and tumble to the floor, scattering cantaloupes as my sword cleaves through the brittle wood of the display. Screams are already coming from the employees and the few customers that are in the store right now. "Do not worry," I assure them, staggering to my feet. I brush the fetid remnants of those melons from my form, flicking seeds to the floor while leveling my blade towards Valkorsia. "I will not let harm come to anyone here!"
---
A rapid, clicking rattle comes from the open maw of Valkorsia at this moment. Bobbing his head like a garden water-drinking bird-ornament, Valkorsia whips away from me as quick as can be, dropping to all fours as he does so. He gallops into the parking lot and beyond the crest of the embankment on the far side while I fruitlessly chase after him. I cannot keep pace with the other man, for the kuru that has been actively co-opting his brain since 1991 has slowly given him inhuman powers that are an abomination to man and nature. I shake my fist at his retreating form as it returns to the moors, and scream at him "And don't come back now, you hear?"
---
Could you believe that after all that, they wouldn't even give me a discount on the kettlecorn?
---

---
I once thought I could take a Typhoon with my Manticore.
---
Do you read? I said the sub is toxic. You're proving it right now, congrats.
---
I was referring to the 99% numbers as being bullshit, not the three years. People died daily in delve even with local and old cynos, nullsec being safe was a myth perpetuated by nano gangs angry they couldn't fight caps without a response.
---
I am fully aware of what you said, but the reason this sub is toxic is because of people like you. Pointing out that you are toxic is not a toxic action, friend.
---

This is a very good post. Have you ever seriously considered writing for a living?
---
You realise a jump beacon is the safest place your cap can be nowadays so you mostly don't even need a cyno alt anymore? As others said you should learn to work with other people, replacing interaction with personal alts is a shit meta.
---
Eve is dying has been a meme since 2003, but recently, eve has taken quite a sharp turn onto a path many of us just cannot agree with. Eve is going downhill, for sure, its not debatable anymore.

Okie-dokie unsolicited person finding my response to someone else to tell me I'm toxic. 😉
---
Yes you are horrible bot u/CCP_Peligro should fix that
---
The 99% is pretty damn accurate under a super umbrella if your in a cap / super / etc. 
---
The massive outpouring of salt by those having this safety removed only serves to underline the point.
---
Using tackle ceptors just means you need a few more of them. When claws lost nullification Horde didn’t stop having a doctrine ceptor, we just switched to using an arty fit Maleciction/Ares. 
---
I’d say remove nullification entirely, Especially from t3cs. Give ceptors covops cloak.  Covert ops cloak should be enough to get ceptors out of bubbles regardless of any camps, and cruisers with battleship dps/tank in addition to covops cloak shouldn’t be able to fly around in perfect safety.

Oh man, see, I love having recons in fleet.  I wouldn't consider the Falcon useless at all.  I'm not a decent recon or ECM pilot myself but I'm tits at logi and we have great recon pilots.  Lots of our fights are make-or-break with a good Blackbird or Falcon pilot on grid.  What you don't see in all our corp's battle reports (and will only witness from videos or being part of a fleet) is an often small gang punching above its weight, forcing a larger fleet to jump a hole or reship because the smaller fleet's logi on grid can't be jammed.  Some of my proudest moments, and my funnest memories, aren't always accompanied by big money wins, but by having two or three Guardians and one or two ECM pilots in a fleet of a dozen guys holding off a fleet twice our size throughout a good fifteen or twenty minute brawl while the other fleet reships bigger and bigger and eventually docks back up.  Gotta give credit to my friends for having maxed sensor skills, and my FCs for knowing what to target and when, of course.

There will obviously be a transition period where people are upset about not being able to play the game they want (I have unsubed) 4 aces as I don’t see the risk:reward worth undocking rorquals) but long term i believe the changes will be good for the game. However I do think CCP need to throw a bone to the nullbears after they have just obliterated the way so many liked to play the game.
---
TBF it wasn't JF pilots complaining. It was the same groups that have been complaining about the null changes trying to make a bunch of excuses for not changing cynos. They complained about having to train more skills and that it would make cyno vigils more difficult. Rather than reversing like they had hoped, CCP made a cyno module that would address all of their concerns.

---
If some players today we're forced to do logistics the old way- flying freighters through space manually with escorts- they would have rage quit.
---
This is what happens when you decide to act as delegate for the vocal minority.
---
&gt; Hunters step up their game, log off and log back in, actually work a little
---
So you expect people to play the game by not actually playing the game? Logoff traps are bad mechanics and a sign that the design is wrong.
---
&gt; The blackout has swung the pendulum waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too far with no local, essentially killing PVE in nullsec. 
---
No local doesn't kill PVE - there's plenty of PVE in wormholes. The problem now is the ease of bridging a bomber fleet in, which should be addressed, and that the ISK isn't worth it. But null should be high risk high reward; historically it's been low risk moderately high reward.
---
&gt; There are so many different ways to catch people, but all you are saying is its impossible, which is demonstrably bullshit
---
It absolutely is impossible, with local, to catch someone who is paying attention, unless possibly you get lucky with a logoff trap and a sabre. People got caught because they weren't paying attention - but catching an AFK VNI isn't really fun anyway.
---
We're talking about stagnation of combat- not packs of cyno fit rorqs hugging rocks.
---
The whining is because it doesn't actually fix the problems.  It's making the game more annoying for the sake of "doing something".
---
Instead, we won't have another large titan battle in Eve, 'cause apparently nobody at CCP thought about how their cyno changes would make it so the second fleet can't get on-grid to actually fight the battle.
---
Change because it's "doing something" is incredibly stupid in all parts of life.  It's even dumber in a product meant for entertainment.
---
Creates an MMO designed to be player driven. Doesn't like how players steered the game, so he flips the game upside down to his liking in order to initiate change. 
---

You might live in a city with 100k people and not interact that much but the sounds of the city and seeing people makes it felt lived in and social. Something most humans need. Compared to a town with just you and a lot of empty buildings and roads and ambient noise.

Identifying a joke usually depends on the phrasing of it, aswell as the contextual background. Sometimes they just appear too similar to (stupid) serious statements.
---
This outcome has been confirmed by FOX news!
---
Wormholers fail to understand that the majority of EVE players don't like wormhole game play.  At least Hi Sec, Low Sec, Null Sec can understand each others game play.  They may shit talk about what space is better but they get EVE is bigger than some krab filled wormholes.
---
&gt; So you expect people to play the game by not actually playing the game? Logoff traps are bad mechanics and a sign that the design is wrong.
---
I expect people to use all tools available to them. 
---
&gt;No local doesn't kill PVE - there's plenty of PVE in wormholes. The problem now is the ease of bridging a bomber fleet in, which should be addressed, and that the ISK isn't worth it. But null should be high risk high reward; historically it's been low risk moderately high reward.
---
Wormholers are making the majority of the isk in eve right now, in relative safety also. Also, with blackout, the risk to reward ratio of nullsec is just completely screwed.
---
&gt;It absolutely is impossible, with local, to catch someone who is paying attention, unless possibly you get lucky with a logoff trap and a sabre. People got caught because they weren't paying attention - but catching an AFK VNI isn't really fun anyway.
---
It really is possible, and demonstrably possible. Look at Zkillboards there were plenty of PVE players being killed while fighting NPCs, not so much lately because nullsec has become a graveyard.
---
Ha ha ha. You guys must. Or have many people cloaky camping your jump beacons.
---
Only pubbies say toons.  You're no Roman.
---
It's willful ignorance.
---
Players complaining about krabs often have self-worth tied to their killboards. These players have no interest in an actual fight, they want to be fed free kills which gives them a flimsy but easy enough to 'defend' justification to be smug about it.
---
What they don't realize is that by overfarming, they are actively undermining their own interests, but they don't care and they can't stop even if they knew that's what they were doing.
---
This is by no means a problem exclusive to Eve, this is a human nature issue - but it's magnified in Eve due to how the game mechanics work.
---
You fail to see that the curve would follow a square relationship.

It's not a pvp game. CCP markets it as a sandbox mmo first, elit pvp shooting being only one of many ways to play the game. And people in nullsec ARE vulnerable to pvp. There's literally nothing stopping you from flying into a system and shooting at people, other than, well...
---
***other people***
---
The defenders don't want to fight you. They want to live in their little empire doing whatever else they enjoy. But, contrary to what you seem to believe, they're not hiding behind any null safety mechanics, they have organized themselves into a group big enough to form up and scare off people who don't bring enough shit to contend them.
---
Let me repeat that - they don't want to fight you, you want to fight them. It falls onto you to find a fight, not for them to provide it. Stop being so entitled, and git gud.
---
This will be very interesting to see. It also might be what CCP is watching for as well.

&gt;#THESE TEN IDEAS TO SAVE EVE WILL SHOCK YOU (answer inside!)
---
I get enjoyment from a game and giving my opinion on why its being fucked up right now is in effort to making sure that enjoyment doesn't go away. As for my play-style, I am not a krab. 
---
No, you didn't say you weren't toxic, you're simply a hypocrite. Thanks for making my point for me. Have a good evening now.
---
TIL blackout and cynos affect highsec
---
I agree with all this.
---
Also, the EVE player-base begs for new players but won't support short session based content. Sorry-not-sorry but if we want EVE to compete with other games we actually do need solo and team based arenas that are balanced which new players can get into easily.
---
Maybe instancing isn't as bad for open world games as people say. A moba feature besides FW for new and casual players would only help the game. Like resource wars could be easily expanded into this. RW had potential and they just kind of abandoned it like every other half built feature and game.
---
Yeah. For all that people like to claim it's the blackout, you can literally see the sudden drop on the day WoW Classic launched.
---
Yep.  Hictors could use some help, and I love the idea of being able to have something closer to "borders" of your space, but iff actual humans are there to enforce it.
---
Go grab a chunk of provi space. They don't mind if people take stuff from them these days. Then we can be neighbors!
---
I'm doing 10000 calculations a second to come up with these numbers but I know they're all wrong
---
?? by that logic orcas should be capital ships as well
---
I play actively and daily in FW/LS, NS Sov, thera and Wormholes.  I dont do much PVE besides when CCP runs a special event.  I have been to multiple EVE events around the world and attended EVE vegas the last 5 years.  So what are you getting at?
---
&gt;half their revenue
---
  Imagine being so confident in your own rhetoric you pull baseless comments like this out of your ass.
---
What the hecc
---
My corps logistic div had new cynos in place within 12 hours after changes. Didnt really affect anything
---
Maybe you should join a more active corporation or try wormhole space, so you have more access to various regions around the game!  
---
Good luck with your hunt, fly safe 07!!!!!!

Oh come on people...we’re supposedly the smartest group in gaming, the nerd’s nerd! And nobody had the foresight to realize this would be an issue?
---
I used this analogy in another thread and my 6 year old daughter could predict the outcome. 
---
Imagine that you are in a big long white hallway with doors wide open the whole length and people in all of the rooms, yelling, screaming, playing and doing their thing. Then you close all the sound proof door...it’s not gonna make things better...it’s just gonna turn it into a long, lonely empty hallway...
---
Like I said, my daughter could have figured that out, I can’t see my friends dad.
---
You don't know your ass from a hole in the ground.

---
This might help.
---
Remember when CCP said they'd use the forums more and this sub list its collective mind as if proving their point?
---
  Notice how few devs post here now days... It's a toxic pit of memes, concern trolling and biased rhetoric.
---
Man, lighten up a bit. You're way to serious and sensitive. 
---
Where's the hypocrisy if I 1) didn't say I was not toxic and 2) said the sub IS toxic. You and I are both part of this sub, are we not? Are we having a conversation in some multiverse?
---
The gaming community will never and has never worked like a Restaurant, else we wouldn't see MTX's and Gambling Mechanics for those MTX's in most games and PC Culture wouldn't be invading video games. 
---
Developers constantly put shit sandwiches out for theor customers and most peoples only complaint is, "I don't like bread."
---
Thank you for the great feedback.  You are a true asset to these forums and the EVE community.

Keeping BoB and PL happy might have seemed like a good idea 10+ years ago, but it wasn't good for business. Now that the founders and other shareholders have lived through their equity being diluted to homeopathic levels, and then being bought out for pennies, I get the impression they no longer have much confidence in the authoritative opinions of their traditional player-advisor-experts. And as for EVE dying, well CCP can do live testing on gameplay strategies as much as they want, but ultimately PA could just close down their Icelandic office and run EVE down to 0 players with minimal costs if they wanted - then spend a few months working on gameplay for a new target audience and relaunch.
---
With the dank triple dda you had like 140  dps?
---
Nope. It is a pvp sandbox game. Its fucking nullsec, you dont get to be safe, ever. Goodbye
---
I'm not really sure if you got a real answer since I don't care enough to scroll down but the real answer is yes.  
---
There used to be five main trade hub systems in the game.  I think at least three of them are still very active, but I'm not sure about the other two.  
---
The two biggest are Jita and Amarr, by far. The third is Dodixie, and the other two are Rens and Hek. Last I checked Rens was still alright, though the prices were a bit fucked and Hek was a shithole. It probably still is.  
---
Depending on where you want to PvP and the type of PvP you want to do, there are three *main* ways of going about getting ships, but of course there's always ways to procure ships that aren't specifically these three.  
---
The first is to buy your ships from a trade hub, one of the main trading stations I mentioned before, and use a shipping service either provided by your alliance or through a third party like PushX to move it to the station you want to have as your headquarters. The important thing to remember is that unless you absolutely trust someone with all your shit, which they could easily steal at any point during the hauling process, it's best to set a collateral equal or greater in value than the value of the cargo on the contract. You also want to make sure the hauling service has access to the destination, or they won't be able to give you your shit.  
---
The second way is to simply roam *from the trade hub itself*. You see this method particularly among streamers who die very very often, and who want to have some options in where they can roam since most trade hubs are somewhat centrally located within a cluster of regions. This is by far the easiest method since you can set your home station to the trade station, and just reship every time you die to a fresh ship from the open market.  
---
The third way is to purchase ships from corporation/alliance contracts. Since you're new this probably won't apply to you for the most part, but typically alliances sell contracts of what are considered mainline DPS/support ships with fits included on private contract. Buying one of these saves you the effort of finding every single thing to put on the ship and the trouble of moving it to the right place, but contract scams are abundant and contracts may not always be available when the call for PvP comes in. Buy from these at your own risk.
---
The answer to powercreep is not more fucking powercreep.  CCP is at-least competent enough to understand this.
---
Bye 👋
---
Lemme guess, you pulled numbers from eveoffline
---
The short term impact is that it's simply is taking time to get the new set-ups in place.  The new cyno BPO was released after the changes, so getting them where they need to go takes more time.  Same for moving Force Recons into place and skilling cyno alts into them. (Rorquals are often used for logistical work.) 
---
Longer term, it just makes doing the work more drudgery.  There will be no exciting new gameplay coming out of industrial cynos.
---
It's just pain for the sake of making it painful. 
---
alliance logisitician btw
---
Sad thing that those same escort fleets wont work in Eve 2019 thanks to tons of broken or shitty mechanics
---
Yeah, I agree with the dude's assessment that the remaining players are a self-selected group of people that either enjoy or tolerate the current stagnation, but he's wrong to blame players. People will always act in their self-interest within the confines of the game, but CCP makes the game.
---
https://evewho.com/character/276701998  
---
Looks like he left the restaurant
---
The answer isn't alienating 1/3 of your player base, either and by all appearances, imploding the entire goddamn game.
---
Yeah absolutely. A CEO changing the course of a game that was shipped 16 years ago must suffer from a personality disorder. No other way.
---
Sarcasm aside, I’m pretty sure EVE had more foundational ideas than ”player driven” in its conception.
---
Nah, all shitty assets belong to the Marine Corps
---
Have you given away your stuff? Can I have it? Listen, I will do great things with said stuff!
---
&gt;Keeping BoB and PL happy might have seemed like a good idea 10+ years ago, but it wasn't good for business. Now that the founders and other shareholders have lived through their equity being diluted to homeopathic levels, and then being bought out for pennies, I get the impression they no longer have much confidence in the authoritative opinions of their traditional player-advisor-experts.
---
You actually think people have had any sway, historically, with CCP? From this part of your post alone its quite clear you knot not of what you speak. CCP has maintained an ivory tower approach to Eve for time immemorial. The only time they climb down is when they are forced to by players banding together, or when their staff members are caught doing shady shit. 
---
&gt;And as for EVE dying, well CCP can do live testing on gameplay strategies as much as they want, but ultimately PA could just close down their Icelandic office and run EVE down to 0 players with minimal costs if they wanted - then spend a few months working on gameplay for a new target audience and relaunch. 
---
Agree. Maybe a restart is what is needed. However, the game we have at this point in time is suffering due to ridiculous ideas that CCP have implemented without really looking at the long term issues. I am hopeful that things will steadily begin to roll back now after the CSM meeting with CCP and the impression that CCP took their feedback on board, however, as history has shown us, CCP has more often than not said fuck the CSM and continued as they wished anyway.
---
Sounds like you did all the right things under the circumstances. Still wouldn't call that a fight.

Doesmt matter eve is dyeong

  Did the risky move work?
---
Are all wormholer tags antisocial to a fault or something?  Read what you replied to
---
I disagree somewhat. You should be able to do solo stuff with capitals. There is nothing wrong with that. Like there is nothing wrong with someone shitting on a tech1 frigate with his HAC. 
---
Forcing people to skill recons only to move their caps looks like a shortsighted money grab though. Don't tell me you think they don't hope to sell tons of injectors. 
---
The whole cyno mechanic is messed up. Why is it active for 10 minutes? A totally useless waste of time. Nobody cared when we could use noob-ships. But we all know almost all cynos just sat there for 9 minutes and 55 seconds doing nothing after that the beneficiary jumped through. Maybe they should have come up with something more plausible and balance. But they came up with the lamest excuse to earn a few quick bucks.
---
Couldn't agree with you more. Spend hundreds of dollars, months, if not years, just to have that target item nullified. I unsubbed as well.
---
He is talking about talking with non blues too. People would sometimes pipe up saying hi or shit talk but it would be something to interact with more people

Nobody would distract you from playing EVE in the second town though ^^
---
Water is wet, fire is hot, WC is at war with test and its pets, what else is new
---
I mean..  nor the first.
---
A cash grab would look totally different to deliberately making the game uncomfortable for a large chunk of the player base. This is not a cash grab but an attempt to shift the game dynamic.
---
Maybe you are not in the right ones?
---
Jesus Christ dude, way to cherry pick here. Why don’t you look what happened literally a year ago.  PCU goes down in September. Maybe it coincides with other events IRL? School, perhaps?

It feels weird that this is the first I saw this point brought up.

By making Jita-centric logistics harder, you make smaller regional markets more appealing.
---
Though granted at the cost of warfare logistics.
---
Last i checked, all the  intel bots are still active in sov null so you know when people are in system... just start chatting/interacting/shit talking
---
Huffing gass is a 20m skillbook. I don't have 20m. I tried null sites, haven't made it home with loot yet. TBH it was not great loot anyway.
---
LOLOLOL! I found another null boi....
---
Remove it from the list untill a 20m isk skillbook is attainable.
---
We pretend like it's just GSF, Horde, and Test that are out there Rorq mining, but the mechanic was abused by basically everyone as soon as it was released. It's not just the amount of minerals either, the production capacity of a region - the actual limiting feature of titan proliferation in the past - has been essentially erased by citadel spam. CCP has had the biggest part to play in defining the Nullsec meta, no doubt about it.
---
Africa and India has internet but no personal gaming PC. Their Internet is Facebook.
---
So you see neuts come, recognize one as a hotdropper and dock everybody up and put out bait.
---
There's gotta be a few surely, you dont even need a decent rig to play Eve.
---
Care to list some examples of what is acceptable and what is not?
---
There should just be a camera that shows your selected target close up. Resizable and optional of course.
---
Good medicine for a lot of things.
---
brbrbr
---
Probably an unpopular opinion but in actuality 100% correct. There is no progression in Eve and as a result the vast majority of players are congregated into the same shit tier corporations over and over, never having the opportunity to enjoy a worthwhile experience or meaningful interaction in Eve.
---
&gt; Actually there is no way that exists which gives scaling effective hitpoints to a ship based on how much you throw at it.
---
EWAR does exactly that.  Jams literally force enemy ships to engage your support fleet.  If you go with the one guy's idea from earlier in the thread to allow freighters to fit modules or otherwise adjust their stats to give them actual tank you can remove your concern about suicide ganks.  Or they could change how war decs work so you can proactively remove CODE.  Or you can be a little more creative than "buy everything at jita, stick it in an unprotected pinata, and fly the same predictable path every time."
---
There are options both players and CCP could use if freighters were going to be the way forward, the Eve playerbase just refuses to adapt while they can put the blame on other players not adapting.
---
Go back and watch the advertisements. The literally say player driven.
---
Why not get on comms and talk to them?  Or at least use fleet/corp chat?  You won't feel so alone if you stop isolating yourself.
---
&gt; Eve is dying has been a meme since 2003, but
---
I joined TEST shortly after the cancer was removed. He's a toxic edgelord. I've had first-hand experiences with it on *other* forums, which, of course, is why I can't stand him.
---
But in game chat channels for your corp/alliance/fleet do.
---
Glad you took the time to come here and tell us.  Why not just quit and go outside, rather than come to r/eve to bitch?  Seems like you want attention.
---
Median age of EVE was 23 two years ago by CCP metrics. I really dont think that many people go to school at 23. 
---
You guys are changing arguments every other week. First it was summer vacation, then it was start of wow classic, now its start of school... what next? Halloween?
---
There's a difference between changing the course of a game and literally imploding it.
---
its so familiar, but wrong at the same time
---
Yes it will be blamed on the holidays next, but it will be thanksgiving and christmas not halloween.
---
Not if your corp is active in more than one system, it doesn’t.
---
To be fair you could argue anything is dying for half of its lifespan.
---
Someone has never been upcharged for condiments at a restaurant.
---
"Can I get Blue Cheese with my wings?"
---
That will be $0.75, is that okay?
---
"No, I think we'll leave, kthxbai."
---
Also, I'm not defending that post, but MTX do exist elsewhere in the world, people just don't think of them as such. Paying for certain add-ons for a vehicle and what they cost, is outrageous. Things like SKINs that are designed once and cost nothing to duplicate/produce/package/ship... yet cost $20, is similar in that regard. Sure, someone spent time creating the art, but how many transactions does it take to pay for their time?
---
Not saying they should all be free, but cheaper. More would sell, more money would be made. Also, like a GOOD restaurant, make more of them complimentary, imo. EXTRA should cost extra, but you should get some with your meal.
---
But heres the thing, you cant really talk about devalue based on a single item, this case PLEX. There is a reason you dont do that irl, instead you use baskets. And that basket dictates if you have more purchasing power or less. So sure, PLEX is cheaper (I would however like to remind you that PLEX prices are more linked to SP, i.e., skill injectors than anything and CCP could have always lowered it by giving out free SP), but if everything else gets more expensive than the drop in PLEX then you will have lost purchasing power. This is whats happening. 
---
I dont disagree with what you want, I disagree with how to get there. I think everyone wants the same as you but these changes are not gonna cut it. Right now, people are actively leaving NS and the game and no change that forces out your playerbase can be good. 
---
You want to fix faucets? Lower the bounties. Take care of what is becoming (if not already) the biggest faucet in the game, WH blue loot. Why arent people reeing about this? 
---
You want to lower minerals? Remove excavators.
---
You want more risk, put in delayed local. Give both sides a fair chance to both attack and defend.
---
You want people to not drop supers on you? Not gonna happen. If you go to someones home and try to attack them it wont be a discussion of how little force do I need to show, it will be bring out the biggest shit youve got. And thats fair. 
---
Besides, shit was dying even when cynos was working in a regular way. But not every time. If you give people a death sentence which you more or less have (cause people wont be saved, they just think they will atm) then people are gonna stop doing it all together. Result, more leaving.
---
So even though I agree on the end result, atleast on most issues, I dont agree on the path. Thats what most are reeing about. Theres more than 1 way to skin a cat and CCP just chose the most brutal options they could find. Have you ever heard of another gaming company treat its players like that? Like full on punitive action. Ofc people are gonna leave man.
---
In the end its a question of 1: extremely harsh methods that havent been reiterated on even though we were promised constant changes (classic CCP) and 2: bad communication. No assurances to the players that "hey there is a plan, bear with us". Instead we received, "people are gonna leave and thats ok". 
---
This was just handled poorly.
---
Sinking titanic theme going.
---
“Gentlemen is has been and honor and privilege.”
---
ISO-8601 is the only acceptable standard
---
I know like those lame ass suitonia posts a month or so ago
---
Cue skill injections.
---
&gt;Just quit the game and go back to your delicate world.
---
Yeah, let me just give up a healthy nullsec corp, 10+ years on four paid accounts and not saying a fuckign word when I see some psychopath destroying Eve. Get fucked.
---
and actually in my post from two days ago i suggested making local chat instant for corp members or at least make a regional chat.  Dont believe my flair also, i do a lot of things in game.

---
Yes started yesterday
---
I miss the days when it was constantly going up and we marked the milestones. However, I think a good portion of the playerbase that went missing were bots. Blackout would cause suuuuuper-casual players to dip out, but not a real dedicated player. Someone that was just PLEXing and AFK-ratting/botting doesn't like the black out and leaves. A dedicated Eve player sees it as opportunity and fun, imo.
---
7:00.0000 AM, repeating of course.
---
o7 RIP
---
here, you can read my suggestions here since you all love to downvote things  
---
Well considering the solution is fairly obvious, revert the shit you broke and give us real fixes then its not whining. Ty for clearing this up.
---
No local means you can't scout out people set up to gank the logistics ships which will all die basically instantly with throwaway dreads to blap a bunch of 5b freighters.
---
In general the amount of caps and supers plus the massive scouting networks available via cloaky eyes means that this becomes so inefficient that there's no reason to do it.
---
That scooter for you
---
Dude is literally talking about "how we used to" and you are talking about hypothetical feature major ship changes and new modules.
---
That's a lot of words to say that you feel entitled to free kills for fuck all effort
---
Lol, then dont log in. Adapt or die right?
---
It really depends. I used to camp Perimeter gate in a Tornado all the time. My targets were T1 industrials. In a 1.0 system it's all about alpha strike, so I only ever loaded 2 shots because I'm an optimist. I never used the second volley. CONCORD response is almost instant in 1.0, and it makes the ganking equation easy. When you get into other sec levels things change quite a bit. I killed a Mackinaw with a Catalyst in 0.6, and that was only possible because the mack's tank sucked and I had about 14 seconds to put down damage before the cops showed up. The equation is basically if DPS x time to cops &gt; effective tank of target than "win." CODE. has been seeing a fair number of Venture ganks via solo Atron of late. That is a tough gank, though. A Venture could easily tank an Atron... if they fit a moderate tank. So, while I don't think frigates are better than destroyers for most ganking situations, people still do it and I'm impressed when they can pull it off. It depends on your target and approach. I've also seen some goons pulling off pretty impressive ganks using NPC damage from mission and trig sites to their advantage. It's a smart strategy. That said, and in answer to your question, yes ganking in a frigate is possible/feasible. Imagine going into a trig site and getting a Scorpion that is about to lose it's tank. You hit it with a scram and just hold them there. I'd call that a sweet gank. In any event, I would still advise you train a destroyer. It opens up a lot more ganking possibilities.
---
irony on:

Blackout is big success!

Your mistake was giving anyone online the benefit of the doubt. Everyone you meet online will likely be a cancer cell in one way or another, don't be polite or kind to them. The ones who say cry and give me salt etc are power tripping cucks who live in their mothers basement or talk about how they're in the military and how they draw racist propaganda on bombs. In reality they're hopeless losers who try to pull emotions out of a game because they warrant no respect IRL. Either gf or nothing at all are the key things to say when destroying someone or being destroyed. Don't feed the socially incapable losers' mental problems by responding or asking for help, if they wanted to help replace your ship they would have done so, asking only puts you in a vulnerable position for them to jerk off over.
---
I can believe that. 
---
On a side note I just had some great PvP in nullsec this eve, as usual.
---
Who really cares....
---
What I'm saying, is there is and has never been a large enough population of "Veterans" that could actually turn the tide or speak out loud enough to make things happen. They already have your money and most of you have proven not to be the "whales" they're looking for, so nothing will come of it. 
---
Not only that, but something a lot of people don't realize and granted it's different for Eve being the example, but there are new gamers every day. And those new gamers haven't seen the detriment of these MTX's enough to take the disadvantage and *NOT* use them. 
---
Given the above statement, if we're using a Restaurant as an analogy still: 
---
If a family goes in and has kids and those kids like the food and the restaurant and the parents don't, 6/10 times the parents will make the choice to stay there making the kids happy. 
---
I'm not saying all MTX's are bad, but I mean they generally are. 
---
We as Veteran gamers will never win, because we are a diminishing minority.
---
5000 players, 12000 caracters ;)

Supers that can insta blap freighters?

Also ever tried repping a freighter ?
---
Actually having people on Reddit turn away new players and tell them “don’t start this shit game” is the reason I am around here still.  Gotta be part of the solution
---
is this free to play game or i have to pay to play?
---
Eve is *still* dying thread #999999999

That's the fucking truth. Reddit has become such a shit storm of bitching.

There's always r/beetlejuicing     
---
Eve is doing fine. We are bringing in new Bros every day. Lots are going Omega. My Corp is about half vets and half newbros. There's plenty of content to do at all hours of the day and night.
---
This post feels like it was written by a child.
---
Our Corp communicates on discord. Local chat is irrelevant. Stop moaning and if you don’t feel like you have a voice in your Corp try joining a smaller one
---
You can do solo stuff with capitals. Even with one account. 
---
The catch is, you need to take gates.
---
+1 for Eve Uni !
---
Hillman has joined gingervitas and has aligned his world domination with Eric Cartman.
---
Is second galaxy dieing as well? If not, it's nothing like eve.
---
Why are you still here Charlotte ? Become a stat and move on
---
Have you not seen the mass amount of bots in high sec now? Or the pods on gates to act as scouts? Bots have adapted the missing players are actual players not bots
---
But now we are caught in an inverse of critical mass, like the decay of neutron population in acreactor that went from critical to sub-critical. As the player base drops, there will be less players to interact with which will demotivated other players who will deem this game not worth their time and further decrease the population. At this juncture we may need something *even more* drastic to stem this wound. I can say for certain that this spat from CCP has done harm not seen since the summer of rage ( I don't think this is as bad as the summer of rage, but this is definitely like kidney punching a man who was already missing blood). I have no idea how to fix it and have unsubbed my accounts. Since doing so, I've come to feel liberated from having to sub multiple accounts and meet participation requirements, and I'm now playing games that I can play as hard or as casually as I want that don't have a sub fee nor an entitled wannabe viking making all the decisions for the game.
---
NOT REALLY

Jet fuel can't melt Minmatar steel!

^^^^^^because it already rusted

if eve is titanic then who left  the ship on lifeboats and who stayed on board,will devs  go down with ship? remember that titanic  engineers did die with ship,majority of  boiler room and engine roon crew perished,none of electricians survived too,they  did keep titanic lights going even after ship broke apart,lights  continued untill stern went vertical...according to withness from those who survived.
---
so you say  veterans will quit eve and no new cannon meat  will come in so devs will  consume themselves because they cant keep content when nobody around.
---
Logistics ops are one of those things that sounds great in principle, but in reality would suck more than its worth.

I say that as someone who used to make their living hauling ttrade goods in a prowler between nullsec hubs.

Fake news, eve is dead and no one is undocking.
---
Really though, glad to see the corp is doing well! Nice kill
---
Zoomers out
---
Tapi trying to spin shit again? Why I'm shocked.
---
MuH pC cUlTUrE
---
How has this been awarded platinum and gold? Did you award yourself ?
---
hmm wonder if this had something to do with a 1 week cap usage ban in most place...
---
Show me a time where the amount of players dropped to the levels we see right now. I can wait.
---
Can't tell if this is serious... or just a really well done social media advert for second galaxy.
---
You don't think many people go to school at 23??
---
Have you ever heard of graduate school or medical school?
---
Of course it's Eve. It even has goons.
---
In a few years, come back and post about how playing Eve indirectly got you a lucrative programming job. 
---
There's loads of us who've taken this path. It very much looks like you're walking it too.
---
FREE - playable on PC / Android / Apple / Tablets etc etc... you know they basically took the Eve concept and did everything we have been telling CCP to do for years...
---
He's doing shockingly well almost a third of his viewers aren't eve nerds who are just there to enjoy his failures now.
---
Toodles
---
Nice man.
---
I miss Vile Rat day
---
I feel like I’ve missed something.
---
This community is full of people who aren’t socially clued up though so I can assume what was said
---
he's been going on super early when im at work.
---
There were two wars at the time, one ending in the north and the test winterco thing, that was put on hold over drifters being a shit event.
---
Huh I guess on the 15th I can login and claim a region for Fatal Ascension then
---
Yea hes started early so he can get hosted by another streamer who enjoys watching his failure.
---
&gt;Materials were jumped out to get Jita-esque prices...but it was just so demoralizing to see my playstyle obsolete.
---
I'm not sure I understand, why was your playstyle obsolete? If materials are going out and finished goods are coming in, that is a perfect position to start some industry in.
---
I miss traveling through local systems and o/ to my friend XXX01 in his VNI.  He was much much friendlier than XXX04.  But you always got the best shoulder to cry on from XXX07.
---
If you use the work neckbeard your essentially making yourself look like an SJW pussy. This is for your own benefit, don't spout pegoratives that male you look weaker than your opponent lol.
---
Welcome to r/eve?
---
&gt;I shouldn’t be afraid of getting yanked, podded, and left with nothing because of not wanting sit in a chat server with people I don’t know doing something I’m not doing.
---
sounds like you joined a pretty shit larger alliance, the only time I have ever been "required" to be in comms is when I am in a fleet for a fight, otherwise who gives a fuck?
---
This actually made me laugh.  Such a relief to see someone else that’s sick of the constant negativity this sub produces.  I’m relatively new and obsessed so I’m not going anywhere, but I think of new players coming into the game, getting hooked, then coming to community forums like r/eve where people are practically burning effigies of CCP while hanging “the end is near!” signs around their necks.  What does THAT kind of negativity do for growing the community and player base?  I want new players to feel what I feel...excited and obsessed with what’s, hands down, the best game I’ve ever played.  
---
And as far as change goes?  Adaptation is the name of the game.  It surprises me that so many people here, who have lost and built fortunes by finding crazy ways to game the system and each other, wouldn’t have more appreciation for challenges that force them to be creative again.
---
Is the idea of nuance just lost on you? Yea NullSechnaya Sholupen will do fine with these changes, the same way we used to talk about PL or BL when they were a "small pvp alliance". But if you go look at the NullSechnaya's KB and look at all the small alliances they are killing, those guys, who actually are trying to own space and live in it, will be having problems. 
---
Yes, the highly skilled, high sp alliances will do well. The guy who made a post a bit about their sub 100 man alliance looking to take space is going to have a much harder time.
---
eve is very good game. second galaxy is just copy... downloaded,installed and i am fking shocked...  AMARR COLOR clearly visible. the goldish,silverish polished metal,its amarr!!!  
---
isnt this copyright infrigment?  why not report this game to ccp to investigate?
---
How about hictor bubble script that stops nullification but consumes some amount of fuel or something, maybe a fairly limited diameter.

I've been thinking for a while that freighters in particular need some help. They do their highsec hauling job well enough and that's fine but they should get some kind of counter play for when they are attacked. At the very least let them fit some dang modules.
---
/u/RNK_Fu1crum )))))
---
Yeah I’m here
---
This idea actually doesn't suck.
---
Thank you.   Really glad you are enjoying the game also !   It really is the best game ever.
---
This is why I love EVE. Y'all can be such a bunch of shitbags, but when it counts, you come together. If any of y'all are still in touch with his family, you should send them a link to this page. Let them know he's not forgotten and still missed.
---
Second star on the right and straight on 'till morning.
---
Hey it shouldnt be a coincidence that I started this account just as the blackout kicked in. If I cant shittalk ingame then I will shittalk somewhere else.
---
Nice work! We found a nag shooting a hull timer citadel, it was via a frig hole. 6 of us tackled him, killed his Guardians(!? not sure the intention there) and then slowly got our alliance into the hole to burn his cap charges faster.

---
Lol, what a cunt.
---
I saw this on ZKill today and was like “wtf lol”
---
I don’t mine at all, but the drama around it seems pretty funny.
---
And what's the player count like?
---
Uh, no we left the day of the drifters. Things may have been winding down. Mittens may have convinced the FC's to continue on. WE WILL NOT KNOW.
---
This is well thought out but founded on some basic fallacies or misunderstandings... :|
---
&gt;The playerbase fucked their own selves over the years, by exploiting to the maximum possible degree certain CCP design decisions that catered to a "bigger is better" meta in almost every aspect of the game.  
---
This statement is the core of the issue, and betrays your own bias.  We currently have 200 man bomber fleets that literally delete capital ships and sub-cap fleets off grids.  We have 1000 dps nano-destroyers with anti-bomb launchers and mjd support.  'bigger is better' is bullshit and is a veiled super-capital whine, which is a veiled economy or content whine.  
---
All of the slumps in PCU are the result of post-feeding-frenzy after a powerful new hunting change happened.  I have posted on this topic before.  There are some 'ages of eve' people refer to.  One of them is the 2012-2014 era.  You can see that Inferno patches were maintenance mode and fixes, and then retribution lands.  Retribution unfucks missile weapons (Bombers), it unfucks Interdictors, it buffs Blops, it lowers Cloak Skill requirements.  We hit peak PCU.  
---
Odyssey Lands, Probing becomes so simple a 4 year old can do it in combat, hics are unfucked, all ship SP requirements are lowered, attempts are made to incentivize non-highsec play, probing is made easier still, and attempts are made to stem the 10k player loss from Retribution by doing ship re-balancing and revisiting income sources (sound similar to now?).  
---
Rubicon Lands, it brings warp changes and SoE ships, setting the last cornerstone of modern Eve in place (the others  being Nullification and probing).  Response to nullified T3C similar to /r/eve today, and the loud minority of hunters was listened to, and since then we have had 5years of nullified frigates.  PCU spikes to almost 60k again.  The rest of Rubicon is a wash of fixes, and PCU slips to 40k again.  
---
This is an important time to mark, as industrials now out-warp cruisers and up, and all frigate sized travel is instant and immune.  Lowsec starts to die, and piracy is the first to go.
---
Wow a whole 5!!! Then surely you just explained the 7k drop right there:)
---
Youre growing on me. Like a mentally challenged younger brother. Just wanna hold you and tell you everything is fine:)
---
&gt;For those unfamiliar with psychology, Hilmar's behavior meets the God Complex to the letter.
---
I don't recall seeing a 'God Complex' in the DSM.
---
I'm guessing there's a technical reason why they don't - presumably generating the list of damaged modules/drones is expensive and they don't want to do it on everything.
---
Although given that you can Ctrl+A and press the button on this window, I'm not sure that logic is really valid.
---
I'm a simple man. I see a PCU graph, I downvote.
---
lol hans I thought you quit
---
Do you need a freaking roadmap, Murkar? Google it. Christ.
---
Looks like legit technical analysis.
---
found old tormentor model now
---
They were a welcome excuse and that's it, deal with it.
---
Yup... you're still naive. Sorry if I'm being curt, but you're not worth my time any more. You're irrelevant.
