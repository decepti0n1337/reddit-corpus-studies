Purpose/goals makes anything better. Not just eve related. Getting in shape for example. You know you should do it because ‚Äúit‚Äôs good for you‚Äù but for a lot of people that‚Äôs not good enough, but ‚ÄúI want to lose 10 pounds‚Äù is a much easier to visualize and strive towards (can see progress on the scale). 
---
Any who yeah give things you do purpose

He was scanning down and i founded him in the dscan in a planet, he didnt saw me on grid or at list i think and i busted to his ship and overheated my missiles and activates my long point, and eventually killed him
---
"There is nothing we can do, probably, so why try?"
---
Well he‚Äôs right, a fool and his money are easily parted. 
---
Just cloak on grid with the gate? You can still see the gate and people coming and going from 1000k away. Oh and by your definition of active reporting people in local would be not afk too.
---
More like hey to their father, HEYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

[Found the botters bot](https://i.imgur.com/C1cMM8O.png).... really, you gotta astroturf reddit now?
---
How about they add timers to the injectors and have diminishing returns for any subsequent use of skill injectors during the cool down period.
---

---
For example give all injectors a 30 day cool down period.  If you try to use the same injector with the 30 days the skill points you get are a fractional equivalent of the amount of time left on the timer.
---
So say you use a 50k skill injector on January 1st, if you try to use another 50k injector on January 4th , only one tenth of the time has passed so you get 10% of the skill points 5k.
---
This way you provide a deterrent from people skilling up a new character to fly a capital in less than a week, but still allow boosts from time to time.
---
He was in the wrong area by himself, the games a lot easier for people on a learning curve when you have friends helping ya out, when you're out and about by yourself early on it's just so easy to make big massive mistakes. He looks like he just wanted to be able to do combat sites he probed down while scanning data and relic sites and thought the bcruiser gnosis was a good fit for what he was doing. I've made this mistake before during my early time in 2013 when a gnosis costed much more lol.
---
I‚Äôve flown incursions and I remember they kicked someone (once) for their guns not cycling for a few sites after giving them warnings
---
&gt; I love the combat however, I can‚Äôt wait to get into pvp
---
Don't wait.  Do it now.
---
Even if that means heading to lowsec in a Corvette (free rookie ship), and dying almost instantly after locking-target on someone.
---
Get used to dying.  Especially now when you are in cheap ships.
---
[My favorite ship was my own design:  a smart-bomb and energy draining nosferatu Condor (T1 Caldari frigate), with a shield booster.  I never killed anything aside from NPC and drones, but had tons of fun experimenting with what worked for me.]
---
Get used to congratulating the victor, even if they smack-talk you.  Note that it is really hard for someone to hurl insults at you, when you are already hurling bigger insults at yourself ... and laughing them all off.  Never loose your temper.  Always laugh it off.  It is just a game after all.
---
Get used to asking people for advice, especially people that destroy your ships;  ask them what you should have done differently, or if you did anything good at all.
---
Make friends.  That's where the true power in Eve is.
---
This is the right answer. I always reward good fights and especially try and help out new players who are just getting their space legs in the hopes they'll pay it forward. 
---
Toxic new bros I'll just grief hoping they'll move on to another game. 
---
Unfortunately a lot is.
---
bombers bar will gladly do that for ya 
---
I ventured into an asteroid belt on my first days in a Venture.  I got tackled and blewped by a pirate without much to say in the chat.
---
Yes it was an NPC pirate, that's what we're talking about right?
---
Right? :(
---
Doesn't matter. You can join a nullsec corp in velator = means you can obviously join it in any other ship.
---
Do you not get suspect for using links/logi?
---
Started running missions untill i hit lvl 4's. Did hs lvl 4 sec missions for a while. trained into mining with 5 accounts and did highsec mining. Trained into industry to get better profits on my minerals and played with that for quite some time. Went and lived in a c2 wormhole out of a pos doing anoms and mining. 
---
Formed my own corporation and went mining / industry in Derelik for around 2 years. Had massive regional ore / mineral buy programs over there while i manufactured and shipped to jita. At first in my own freighter, later i outsourced that and flew shuttles up and down. By then i was trading in amarr space to avoid the niarja jumps. Went and anchored a pos in deep great wildlands and started belt ratting there. Did the nullsec gatecamping, got involved in some wars. 3rd partied on one of those conflicts where half of eve was flying around in the regions bordering great wildlands. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Then came back to derelik highsec and started running t2 inventions and production. Ended up running a t2 ammo program where i litterally had some 20 characters running t2 ammo in my pos's. I would fuel and bring the resources/ blueprint copies. Other players would buy a pack for a price. At the end of production i would buy the t2 ammo back from them to sell off. So basically they did the production for around 50% of the profit where i did all the logistics including the selling. That was very successful. Most null pilots could plex their accounts with the income it generated for them at the cost of installing a few jobs on my pos twice a month. Then i got sick of it and went to live in a c4 joining another corporation. Ran c2 anoms out of the static. But found that c3 anoms were more profitable. 
---
Ninja-ed up a base in a c2 w c3 static to make more isk and did that solo for a few months. Then i joined back up with some old friends and started living in a c4 w/ c3 /c5 statics. Running anoms in both statics and pvp-ing a little on the side. After this i think i'll try living a bit indy like in solitude, maybe anchor up a freeport for trading over there doing t2 ammo production and t1 ships.
---
Or i might go do the same thing in providence, not sure yet. In the end i find that running anom's and indy stuff is what i enjoy the most. I'm not a fan of PVP because i'm only good at it in fleets and not solo. But in fleets the FC's are often making bad calls losing me my stuff and then not SRP-ing anything so i end up wasting billions on their idiotic idea to go fight a group that clearly overpowers us because they are thirsty for content and really "this is the only way to get fights" I mean jumping in a 20 man HAC fleet onto a wing of 15 machariels is just calling to get blapped of the field.
---
This. It's fun. It's easy. It pays. 
---
As a player who disconnected over 4 years ago.... what's in it for me?.... I paid for like 7-8 years and now the game is free... never got re-invited back for a free 3-months peak from CCP.
---
Is it still worth it?
---
That's about half a one month subscription (¬£10), and for that you get a whole month of extra SP. I'd still suggest just buying a sub for a month is a better answer.
---
I feel like you could use this to relax the restriction after CCP had enough time to measure the impact (if any) it was having on actual new players.    
---
I just still don't see the merit behind the status quo that alpha's require use of a skill injector. They already have reduced training speeds, this restriction would support that incentive to plex/sub.   
---
The creation of the new crop of bot mining apocs or whatever the hell they are doing these days harder should be part of a multi-pronged anti-bot strategy.
---
This is actually kind of a cool story.  
---
EXPLAIN
---
Single vnis won't be able to break logi, that's the point
---
It seems like the new owners aren't as keen on having decent sales regularly. 
---
says a lot about the state of the game that the Garmur is a beginner pvp ship now
---
I suppose because of my play style this is the way I meet quite a few new players.  Best feeling ever when after the explosions are over and they take it in stride and ask questions and I send ISK and they exclaim vociferously about the amount as it‚Äôs typically more money than they have seen at one time and then they add me as a contact and everybody is happy! üôÇ
---
Garmars will wreck an astero any day of the week.
---
&gt; Envelope
---
in horde we have guys who ate online in standing fleet every day but hadnt gone on a fleet in years
---
TIL I'm a bad. Doesn't really bother me though!
---
Goons to strong, shoot horde structures and run when see them
---
It's probably a legitimate strategy for new players to lose cheap ships to veterans who will ridiculously overcompensate the losses. I was in a fleet once and we killed a guy on his first day. Just about everyone in the fleet gave him 10 million isk for his Corvette loss, must have gotten half a billion at least lol
---
Started??
---
He took 8k damage total... It was probably over in a few seconds. 
---
It seems strange but I honestly believe that once I  have ganked a new player and then made contact (chat/mail/ISK) it is actually a good thing.  They learn ships get blown up, some players like to help and finally gain a resource for info about the game...me!
---
Hi r/all
---
Also, great kill on a wingspan scrub!
---
I tried to pirate once years ago. I wanted to biomass a char and make a new gal one so I took my trusty rupture(char was mimitar with just above base skills when we still started with some lol) went to low sec hunting. Found a player in a belt ratting in a drifter. Tackled and shot him some then stopped and flew away when he seemed confused in local. Spent the next hour in a convo with him explaining what happened how it happened while explaining ships pvp and fitting and answering questions he had about the game. I just cant be an outright ass in games.
---
Man do I miss Frulegur 
---
It‚Äôs eve. If it‚Äôs a fair fight someone messed up. 
---
Regardless, the closet thing to an even fight you‚Äôll get is going to be FW space imo.  Yes theres still blobbing occasionally and that guy that cloaks a falcon in the large with him, but it‚Äôs your generally speaking best bet
---
youll get suspect for logi yes, but not for links.
---
My very favorite kill was a taranis kill in a rail incursus pre-tiericide. On paper it's a fight I should never have taken ever.
---
It's a T1 BC. Not exactly difficult to make. 
---
Not always. I got ganked while exploring, the player gave me 200mil and explained my mistakes at trying to escape and fitting. That happened 3 years ago and I'm still playing and enjoying every second of it
---
I remember when I was new......ah the good old days. Anywho, I‚Äôd not long got my first interceptor and flew it into low sec. well I was tackled pretty quickly and was certain to die, but when I lit my cyno, fuck I‚Äôd have loved to see the look on his fat bearded face, lol
---
&gt;plays eve
---
&gt;calls other eve player a fat neckbeard
---
:thonking:
---
I do this, but only if the person is cool. If they rage or anything in local, no SRP. 
---
To be fair a client side detector is entirely appropriate here. It would be nice if there was a periodic follow up check.
---
depends on the guns you use. beam lasers are easy to see firing, artillery is basically invisible even if you're zoomed right in, so fly a machariel
---
pls stop -.-
---
Can I get a gate to a bottle of that?
---
No kidding. I find it pretty overbearing that OP is accusing people who don't compensate newbies of being bad people. Seems like he's feeling smug and superior and wants to signal his virtue. There should be no guilt for introducing newbies to PvP in a PvP game.
---
Recently (month ago) joined Signal Cartel (exploration) for a change of pace.
---
I've been playing for 10 yrs (Feb 2009), and I still find new, and old, stuff to do that I enjoy.
---
CCP doesn't care.
---
Most of the "elite" vets don't care.
---
None of the large coalitions care and actively support them.
---
Why should you give a fuck?
---
&gt;	nowadays
---
Always?
---
I don't send isk but when I used to 1v1 pvp station duel I would convo them and explain why I won and what they could do differently. Sometimes I send isk but mostly I was poor as they were and I think that me teaching them was worth more than the ship anyway. And a loss of isk will probably help them remember a lesson better as they think about it while making the isk back.
---
Nothing happens though. Which is why its common.
---
&gt; Hi r/all
---
The real question is, what do do with the corpses, and how to dress them.
---
TSOE?
---
What sort of fit on the Vexor?
---
Sorry for the ignorance but what is a wingspan?
---
Corp/alliance
---
Ohhh yeah, sorry i didnt noticed the dudes corp, the fact that is a wingspan is good or bad?
---
Congrats!
---
My first kill was just dumb random luck, and I deserve no credit for it.
---
Always remember that you don't have to be level 5 or perfect to get kills, because there are plenty of idiots like me to shoot at that make lots of mistakes.
---
Above all have fun regardless which side of a kill-mail you find yourself on!
---
if he fits like that after 9 years then I still feel good about doing what I did.
---
I fully get that.  There's a handful of "famous" players in my area that I avoid for now because I know they outskill me greatly.  I'm working on it though.  
---
When I used to run a small pvp Corp, half my recruits were people we killed who didn't spaz out about it 
---
I remember being cargo scanned in high sec during 2013 when it used to make a noise that was really loud and scary for me at the time and panicking to my friend asking him what's going on lol.
---
I somehow ended up amongst gays.....
---
Thanks dude, apreciate it. And with level 1 mastery on the garmur im already happy (gonna train to level 3 mastery obviuosly)
---
Neither. They're hunters and you got one. So good on ya!
---
Obviously he's too busy putting an end to bots.
---
congrats!
---
&gt; best thing about making a new character is helping out in rookie chat
---
Yeah, and having to think about the ways you explain things to keep people from stuff that you know will burn them out if they try to do it early on with no regard lol. It is really rewarding feeling to be in there.
---
... but please show mercy to Signal Cartel if spot one of us ;-)

Beautiful. I have PyFA and didn't realize this was available. Very helpful!

Does the signature radius of a drone under MWD increase like a ship would?

You mean something like this?

I think if they implemented something like my suggestion they should do it for both alphas and omegas.
---
IN EVE, It's not about how long it took for someone to settle down, but rather how long can someone stay in one group until break off
---
Suitonia is completely exaggerating about caps being dropped in Brave Catch, it absolutely their content zone and it is why Goons always run fun fleets into there, so Goon FCs can practice and improve and so Brave can get content. Brave dudes who drop caps on their fleets are actively yelled at by other Brave members because it will mean that Goons bring their fleets there less often. If suitonia is getting dropped on in Catch, it probably has more to do with the fact that he's suitonia and people want to drop their caps on streamers and less so that they are protecting their space. I can't speak for TEST on their super policies, but yeah TIKLE loves to drop haha.

Implying 30mil is worth shit

Once you've got sufficient capital you can make absurd money with just stupid simple buy low/sell high work in null and low sec.

Convenience is King in Eve and players will be more than happy to price gouge themselves if it gets them fitted and flying faster.

Legacy member here. Skill u may be our enemies but they got my respect for fighting against the odds and pulling off such amazing bombing runs. I was one of the two legacy scimi on the field (the other scimi died, what are the odds lul) and b4r was absolutely chaos after the continued bombing run, everyone in armor n hulls. I might have been on the recieving end of it but it was a beautiful fight. Gf and looking forwards to more fight with you all o7

Some of the best isk per hour is flying around on an alpha pretending to be a cute newbie
---
I'm way new, but I have some thoughts. I've tried a bunch of different stuff now. Everytime I get into a new activity there's a whole new learning curve. 
---
As I've progressed old skills become useful again. My explorer main  has now become a "scanner" alt. My mining alt has become my cloaky eyes/scout. This may be a low bar, but I just started soloing 0.0 anomalies. At first, that was definitely not as easy as all the YouTube videos make it look.
---
Flying interdictors, logi, and even dps is large fleets still isn't that easy for me. And I learn something on just about every fleet, even if it's a bash.
---
I like having the choice of activities based on the time I have available. 
---
I imagine I'll bounce around to whatever strikes my interest for a long time.
---
On the other hand, there are folks who mine in high sec for years. I think as long as you're having fun, that's  the key.
---
See, eve players go for the long game.  Get you to keep playing and slowly slowly slowly you'll get the cancers.  Either that or you'll turn into a proper eve-sociopath and start into industry

I do srp with newbros that I catch too. Same rule too, if you rage at me, you get nothing. 
---
&gt;  If it feels like work, then do an hour overtime at your actual job and buy plex to sell for isk. 
---
This is why I always tell new people to just pay for the damn membership if they like the game. Figure out some way to come up with $15/month because nothing destroys fun in eve like being poor and trying to scrape together money for plex each month. 
---
I convo them first to see if they‚Äôre a cunt or not
---
If they‚Äôre nice and listen to my advice then I‚Äôll give them the ISK back
---
If they tell me to fuckoff and that I‚Äôm a 400lb loser living in my moms basement then no
---
Sounds like a good way to make isk.
---
Someone shedded tears in public because his/her 15m Vexor got ganked?
---
Not trying to be offensive but he/she better off playing some PVE only games on probably Canadian or Netherland server
---
&gt; But so far CCP seems do be doing rather well financially.
---
They sold the company to Pearl Abyss(The makers of *Black Desert Online*) that has no interest in continuing it(outside some publicity...) just reaping the monthly subscriptions, overtaxing CCP's resources to increase availability/stability of Black Desert Online and making the Eve Online's economy tank so Plex is too expensive to use in-game currency and you have to subscribe.  
---
Honestly, while people give this 2 years, i give it far less. If CCP would not have gotten so greedy the last 2 years, and got there dev's to recode some of older work. Reducing hardware load and leasing off some of there cluster.   Thus staying in ownership of the game, it would probably stick around another 6 years easily. But now. Forget it, its a downward spiral till its considered not profitable, and like all asian-market game studios. They abandon it and sue anyone who tries to revive it. Because profit before anything.
---
  
---
With that said, there is cleanroom reverse-engineered projects out there. Which the legality is always on the side of Use. Since technically if a new client was developed to use a server that was made from Cleanroom Reverse-Engineering. It classifies as a new product. There for does not invalidate intellectual and copyright laws. (However on the grounds of likeness. this could be argued, but, not the point) - I mentioned the only, barely active project out there still above\^ 
---
While there is a private server being hosted and monitored to further code development/testing 
---
( [http://evemu.alasiya.net/](http://evemu.alasiya.net/) ) 
---
Being it is still a crucible-era compatible server should be mentioned, and also makes it relevant to this post... Because thats the earliest game client you can now play. As the game client only displays data processed by the server hosting Eve Onlines Services. Client is just a shell made up of really crappy code, designed to display images, text and other displayable data, provided by the server. it has no functionality locally
---
They do that?

Yes, the Dino spammers are devoting themselves and their keyboards(they typed those manually) to stabilize chat servers
---
But recently due to CCP switched to a completely different scriptable memetic linguistics to run their servers, Dino spammers found their efforts can no longer keep the chat server running stably
---
mate you what

Ever heard of "Burner Phones"...

You may not have been trying to be offensive, but boy did you manage it anyway.

Can anyone point me in the direction of some autz wh corps? Have some experience in wormholes and feeling the itch to get back into. Thanks
---
I knew about the Dotlan, just looks like a big gap in knowledge when it comes to Corporate Oversight.  Would be ideal for WarDec and Alliance building to really be able to see a Corps holdings and Resources.
---
I presume all my toons can be tracked back to my launcher / IP anyway.  Is associating groups of bots such a challenge as currently implemented?  
---
I dunno anything about DOTA, but I‚Äôm not sure such a requirement would add much value in the fight against bots in eve
---
Curious to hear what others think, though. 
---
Which is exactly the case
---
On Android you can just generate burner numbers
---
Hi Agent Mattel! Next time mine comes up for renewal I'll keep you in mind.
---
My first introduction to pvp in eve was getting tornado ganked in amarr, had no clue what even happened.  Was the best thing that could have happened to me... I knew eve was supposed to be this scary hard game where you can lose everything in a few seconds, and it made that real to me.  I learned about what happened and started working towards being able to do it myself and had a blast. 
---
If some new guy loses a vexor and is being a bitch about it, he was never gonna last anyways.  He just learned a lesson about life in eve... let him tough it out and get better, and if he can‚Äôt do that, he can reinstall wow.  Eve isn‚Äôt for everyone.
---
You can go far with one node sure, but its an absolute brick wall after that, and it doesn't help you scale out at all.
---
I'd rather see you try to subvert it. Can you commit to a firm deadline?
---
The only thing worse than playing in tidi is *watching* tidi. 
---
You need structure manager role in your corporation to have the list of deployed structures.
---
You cannot see structures belonging to other corps.
---
There are ways, yes, but you'd probably have an easier time writing that in Python.
---
Any private ESI route requires an authentication process before it allows you access. At the very least you'd have to execute several requests to achieve that. There are command line tools that can do it, but you're essentially programming scripts at that point.
---
May as well do that in Python, since you already have code written in that. Would probably make the whole thing more simple to use. 
---
Did you just reimburse or did you actually tell him what was wrong with the fit?
---
1) CCP ain't Valve, CCP doesn't have enough resources to build up a system which requires verification of phone number from numerous countries all over the world, not to say in some countries a phone number is directly linked to a citizen's PID
---
2) Many people may hate what I am about to say, but from my observation, seems like CCP actually prefer a moderate amount of botting to keep the inflation going
---
Try to get to the hi-gate from an angle different from an object like a station or astra or god forbid, another gate.  
---
Similar technique when avoiding a fart bombing battleship in an interceptor loaded with loot, try not to be near their bombing range by getting to the gate at weird angles.
---
No video game company has my cell number. No video game company ever will. Do you honestly trust the new owners not to sell your number?
---
local is primary
---
Yeah, but it's a hassle innit? And it creates a negative financial impact on the people trying to run the bots. 
---
Plus burner phones don't exist everywhere. Here in New Zealand, the cheapest phones you can get are around 20 dollars. Plus you need to buy a sim card for them afterwards, and at that point you're out quite a few bit of botting cash.
---
The POSPY eviction was a prime example that it isn't as big an advantage as people think. Having said that, I'd focus on carriers and faxes. Park them on your forts and then you have both the forts weapons and your fighters, along with being able to receive fax reps. 
---
A typical subcap eviction fleet is going to be long range arty such as machs or sleipnirs, fighters can track and if you have enough you'll alpha them. 
---
It possible to block entire Alliances. 
---
Right but how many of those 4 year old players would so have 5+ rorq accounts without injecting
---
Imagine walking out the front door of the bus to leave when there are people trying to get on, instead of using the back door like you are supposed to.
---
yeah and they seem to do it a lot

I met one of these guys the other day. Blew up my barely-fitted cruiser, worth probably a tenth of his ship.  (I was still flying around picking stuff up, but I'm a newbro anyway so I stood no chance even fully fitted). Luckily a nice redditor saw my name in the kill logs and gave me 150m isk amd some advice after a short convo. Ima go find his name and edit it in to thank him again.
---
Thats not really true. Most people dont consider ganks fun fights. Small gangs dont like farming solo vnis as muchh as the vni tbh. Its when there is a like 15-20 t1 cruisers and tackle vs 5-6 t2 or faction small gang thats super fun. But like 80% of the time some smoothbrain decides its time to drop a nyx on the small gang so they are forced to just disengage

There is a test server and you don't even have to log off your main character to utilize.
---
Click to change the server to singularity on the launcher. 
---
Test all sorts of things with seeded 100 isk ships and equipment.
---
Use cheat commands by typing /moveme to teleport to some predefined systems, including thera wormhole.
---
Get out there and test some of the pve in your ship/fits of choice.  Practice your cyno move-ops.

Ok, so can you start me off?

No idea what script I'm writing in python.

When you are solo roaming, you are always at the disadvantage of the locals. They'll have intelligence and the ability to reship to counter you. Also you're bringing content to the locals and getting a fair fight could be difficult because there's always people willing to fight. I recommend flying expendable and very nimble ships. A bit of preparation also helps a lot getting tactical pings and setting up safe spots in you regions you're hunting really helps. There's a reason why small gangs that hunt null fly fast nimble ships that shred tackle like no one's business.  You can also try low sec fw plexes as they kinda limit the size of potential ships you'd be facing. Probably the best way to get a fairer fight is make some friendly enemies and honor any 1v1 requests you get, get a few of those dealing buddies and you'll be able to get some quality fights.

---
But thats not even his kill?
---
Well certainly it can be huge - but rolling a new character, buying a phone, sim, setting it all up - it's all a bunch of faffing around that still detracts from the time they spend in game ruining the economy.
---
And if you're having to buy a few hundred bucks worth of burners then it's still going to have SOME effect.

 Trading is easy moneh

Questions for any eve economists out there, or anyone else who might have some answers. Does anyone know why Plex price is recently skyrocketing? It's hard enough affording months as a solo nullsec explorer while in college, now a month worth of Plex is going over 1.8bil. Should I buy now as it's climbing in price, or should i wait and see if the price drops, as I'm pretty sure it's higher than it's ever been right now
---
I have 3 arbalest light missile launchers on the highs, 5 mn mcw t1, sensor booster, small shield extender, and a warp disruptor on the medium, an IFFA damage control, a overdrive injector t2 and a ballistic control system t2 on the lows, the rigs are small policarbon engine, small low friction nuzzle t2, and auxiliary thruster t2. And i use caldari navy light missiles
---
I'm really NC. This is why I told PGL to debate me. The issue isn't the fact that many people own supers/titans. That is just a process of time. The issue is, they don't die. Lets take a quick mental stroll back to X47. 400 on 400 titans, dding it out. How many died in total? 30? Why so little? Because every huge super brawl is 10% tidi, which means DD cycles are 1 hour and 30 minutes. Between that and disconnects you have 4 titans dying every 1 hour and 30 minutes. It's not proliferation so much, as inability to kill lots of them. Sure 1 or 2 titans die off a week to stupid, but builders replace those with ease. 
---
The problem is not that haw titans exist, or bosoning some frig gang on a gate. The issue is jump fatigue removed all risk of taking that action. You see all the big boy alliances pretty much know where everyone's capital fleets are. That TEST guy knows we are out of range to kill him, his risk is near zero. Before jump fatigue we could tackle him, move capitals across the universe and end him. This is why every major alliance lives under a 'super umbrella', they are all attached to a leash known as jump fatigue. 
---
 Jump fatigue also limits any chance of a major engagement happening by chance, and therefore not in epic TIDI, which would allow greaters numbers of titans to be killed. Combine that with systems with an endless supply of resources, and you get more and more supers/titans being built up with no real means to get them killed off in any sizable number.
---
The fact that these ships exist, and people own them isn't the issue. The fact that you can inject pilots, and that rorqs mine a lot (even though they really dont compared to their cost) isn't really the issue. Rorqs should go back to pre nerf mining levels, and mining anomalies should take days to respawn, not hours. (Yes PANIC module is stupid, and should be removed from the game). Capitals should be free to jump drive to where ever the hell they want to go. Then you'll see them die, because they aren't stuck on a leash.
---
I second this opinion 
---
  Look at that expression. The smug disgusts me.
---
I'm at 12 years with maybe 4 quitting points, but huge gaps in between. I'm sure some people think I'm a risky target in a roughly even fight but I have less than 2 years actual play time under my belt. 
---
&gt; The point is if/when their first bot nyx gets banned, the barrier/cost to injecting the next one is increased. 
---
How? They have to go Omega to fly the Nyx, they can easily just inject after they go Omega.
---
Yeah, I mined to make a venture with the velator and civ miners because I didn't know they handed one out for free. Flew it out to Cloud Ring, started mining and got popped.
---
Fools rush in... and have an _awesome_ time
---
To get you to read local instead of paying attention to stuff that actually matters.
---
  Fair fights were years ago.Had you played from start around 2003 up until 2012 you would've had what you want
---
 Yea don't mix your training between mining and combat.You will make alot more isk in the long run doing missions or DED sites or abyss and those skills which focus on damage and tank are same you'll need for pvp whereas mining skills will be useless in pvp
---
I put a bounty on myself when I started getting serious and subbed a 2nd toon because it looked 'cooler'. 
---
I didn't put too much research into this guy at the time but he did everything as right as he could and something told me he wasn't a brand new noob in a wh. 
---
And now I look at his own KB I see he's been killing ventures in a drake and custom offices.  He'll be alright.
---
Great video and incredible fight!
---
Major props to Pashko for keeping that Drek alive, that was intense.
---
Keep up the awesome work!
---
In a fair fight in Eve someone (or everyone) involved has fucked up.
---
I'm only upvoting you because you made me laugh with this bit:
---
&gt; If it was good nuff fur jeezus its good nuff fur me. 
---
I think u mean a b274 or a n110.
---
Works both ways but I was insinuating that they live in highsec. 
---
Will they take the fights without all of their spies?
---
Giving my phone number to a company recently bought out by notoriously greedy Korean game monetization company.
---
Yeah I'd rather not have my number sold on by shady employees thanks.
---
Lol. Well done.  
---
As a guy that spent a lot of fun time with Wingspan I can say never not shoot Wingspan.  We loved it when people tried to return our delivery to sender. :-)
---
It will be a reminder to use your cloak when just hanging around.  A small price to pay. 
---
Keep hunting man!!
---
Happens all of the time
---
Basically means a Russian prison bitch. Can be equated to a gay bottom.
---
See the problem with such a sustainable ship like the deimos is that your dps is low but tank is huge.
---
This leads to even small fights becoming very long and giving time for enemies to form.
---
That said I can't really blame them, a deimos is pretty top of class for pure 1v1 brawling.
---
I'd advise you try smaller ships, hit and run tactics and perhaps fly more engagebale ships.
---
My bad. I thought you mean camping HS wormhole connections. :P
---
My primary alts are for capitals and subcaps, just pvp.  I have another alt with fully developed trade and some transport skills that I use for market fuckery so I don't krab unless I'm real bored and feel like using my Niddy down south; Abyss running on my subcap alt can be fun sometimes though, I like the combat variety even if the drops suck. In the past my capital alt was an indy/mining character but I sucked out all those skills and don't intend on doing anything indy related for the foreseeable future. I think the game is most fun when you don't really limit your time to just one activity, it's such a huge and beautiful game, you can easily do multiple "jobs" that are fun and/or lucrative for you.
---
(Soapbox)
---
Everyone should pvp no matter what they believe their profession to be in Eve if they are undocking any ship. Eve is Eve, be prepared for combat at all times and in all places. 
---
(/Soapbox)
---
shocking
---
I refer to that as my Shoot and Recruit program. It's quite popular and the rest of my corp and some of our blues are using the term now. 
---
Well, their idea of a balanced game is when they roam with a stratios rorquals must die like flies! And you are right this should never be the case!
---
There are no fair fights except through individual negotiation, and that is no assurance of a fair fight either. Just fight.
---
Only a poor wouldnt do this....
---
I'm a ~3 day newb and this *just* happened to me. I had no idea this was the etiquette, and it really made quite a positive impression on me. Of course at the same time someone else came along and pod-killed me, so there's that to balance out. :-) 
---
    /corporations/{corporation_id}/structures/
---
Is the endpoint you're looking for. Of course you'd need someone to make a pretty front-end for the data. Or use the ingame structure browser.
---
When whaling in eve goes south
---
Only alphas can use them as it is right now....
---
Requires a role, but I'm not sure which one.
---
That just delays things by a short while, as long as you can inject all of the lower level requirements it's pretty quick to get into most capitals and be functional, months more to get fully skilled depending on what you're skilling into. I don't think it's a good solution. Elimination is really the only thing to stop every idiot with a credit card from getting into a shiny new capital.
---
Wish I had one of all the groups.  Be fun to meme hard underwater
---
Yeah and I replaced it after playing around with it. Your point being what?
---
I have a pet. I pay for her food and pick up her shit. She sleeps in my bed while I'm at work. 
---
This is the trap I setup. I think I have a full unedited vid from start to finish of it.
---
How about overhaul the pve and make it where it actually requires a thought process? Or overhaul drones like fighters this would only be a massive hurt to blob groups, which r/eve also complains about. 
---
You just proved my point.. people don‚Äôt undock because of their precious kb 
---
I just pretend you are fighting the bot war. It is super easy because I've been doing the same with CCP for a decade.
---
Unda da sea
---
Is there a buff to Isogen-consumption planned or on the radar? It has lost 2/3rds of its former value, taken from one year ago, whilst all other mineral prices seemed stable.
---
 A rl friend whom got me into Eve, told me to set destination to our low sec island. I did blindly, and when I came back the rookie ship had blown up. No idea what was going on, but do know I was in this round thing in space surrounded in my ships debris. 
---
 
---
Then he showed me my loss mail, which was his killmail.... üò≠
---
Then my wallet blinked, and I was 20 million iskies richer. Good times.
---
You can sit there docked forever, until the structure gets blown up that is.
---
Yet another raw footage, even worse, without comm. Is this trend of /r/eve these days?

...Hmm. I will pencil you in for Wednesday. Just a moment....
---
"Infiltrate and subvert immoral racketeering thugs inhabiting Hi Sec." There. Done! See you Wednesday.
---
I would argue that cosmetic only mtx are only the standard because of a handful of tantrums across several games and attempted models. Look at what Battlefront 2 tried to push. Or hell, look no further than skill extractors.
---
I think a tenuous equilibrium has been reached and I'm okay with it but I don't think the people that pushed back on the early stages of the mtx model should be vilified.

---
CCP new drones? gay set (ECM)
---
Alrighty then! If we still exist on Thursday we'll get your permit sorted.
---
Someone down voted you because they didn't agree with you. Have my upvote m8.
---
I have to admit this is one of the things putting me off Eve.
---
Not CODE. Not ganking. Not at all, quite the opposite. Organizations like CODE make me want to play Eve. Because at the very least they have character. They add to content. They create a story. Something which brain dead carebears will never achieve.
---
The fact that some crawling shitheads would come along and down vote your comment is what puts me off. I came to Eve to with the expectation of escaping the retarded asswipes who go around mass downvoting anything they dont like.
---
I expected a higher level of intelligence in Eve, on account of the game's learning curve. I am beginning to think I was wrong.
---
Schneckt bro best bro 
---
I don't play now, but I'll never forget me asking a simple noob question turning into a player taking me under his wing for a year , helping me pay for my mining barge, and teaching me everything and getting me into his faction warfare group and joining in on skirmishes. As a new player , it was surreal suddenly flying alongside other ships as a fleet and fighting. Never had that experience in any other game. As I played , I never forgot , and always contributed to helping new people I ran across my entire time playing. 
---
Doesn't the same logic apply to bots though too?
---
Reimbursed, if they have questions normally they message me why I just gave them isk etc.

I guess I don't understand what not speaking the same language has to do with a poor editing decision. Can you explain what I'm missing?

I mean that the daily alpha injector would be the only type of injector that could be used by alphas. Basically, make all other skill injectors omega only.
---
You can stay forever, nobody can force you out (except by blowing it up obviously). Your best bet is to asset safety your gear out and either try to make it in your fastest ship or just take the pod express.

When I first wanted to learn solo pvp I went into FW space in a kestrel. Got MERKED by a hookbill being flown by joebane. Guy paid me back and gave me some tips. Had he just said ‚Äúget fucked‚Äù I probably never would have gone back. Ever since then if an account is &lt; 10 days old I 10x srp them and hope they don‚Äôt give up.
---
We all started off seeing Tormentor/Punisher/Merlin on dscan and panicking thinking SHIT WHAT DOES THAT SHIP DO AGAIN. Sucks that some forget that and just shit on newbies.

This is how I became a pirate.
---
I joined FW, went out soloing, died almost immediately. I asked my murderer if he had any tips for next time. He gave me a bunch of good advice and SRP'd my frigate.
---
I used the money to buy a better ship with a better fit, and the next time I went out soloing...I died again.
---
It actually took a month for me to get my first solo kill. But I never forgot the wise words that pirate said to me on that first day.
---
"Git good scrub"

&gt;!Oh wait, there are no real pvp-ers, just risk adverse nanofags!&lt;
---
CCP didn't put a fraction of the time thinking about injectors before they rolled them out that was needed. Too late now to stick the genie back in the bottle.
---
Just get a director level spy into their corp.
---
I still remember when i started playing 2015 i got killed in lowsec in my venture on my second (or third) day and the guy who killed me was super nice and understanding that i was a new player. He gave me 10m and explained alot of the things that the so called "tutorial" didn't.
---
Um... Structure browser should get you that info, if you are in that Corp that is. 
---
Those are almost definitely researched. Actual value far exceeds 100b
---
Will CCP ever re-release Quafe Zero? Why is it so expensive now?
---
5% lock speed and 5% velocity is huge. Should it be so expensive?
---
yes

---
1v1 at sun.
---
Thx didnt know
---
I find myself in a healthy rotation of a few things. I don't think I could settle down with one activity.

The CSM has brought this subject up with CCP. The thought is it will be added to locator agents if the code is amicable.
---
How do you still get bombed in tyool 2019 with booshers,defenders,dics  and hics????
---
I tried mission running as that's what my RL friend who got me into the game did and it bored me so I quit, when I came back I went into wormhole space and I have no intention of leaving. I run C5 sites a couple hours a week to pay for my PvP, then spend the rest of the time hunting and pvping, couldn't imagine doing anything else. 
---
I mean, 2x the video at least.
---
Me too. I get super into it for like 2-3 weeks and then the time sink is just too huge and quit completely for a while.
---
Ahh, the 3 dreads 1 hole master race would like a word with you.

Don‚Äôt be salty just because you have bad intelligence.

I don't know where people get this experience of bad comms, but I always liked our atmosphere in TVP (RIP).

It Never was as Bad as listening to JU- Standing .

probably not the right place to ask this. What are those things that would burn newbies out early? I'm new myself and have yet to get into anything majorly and having a hard time deciding what to do.

That is a nice first kill way better then most peoples.

Avoid mining until you find a group of people who will make it fun by socializing and setting goals. It requires a lot of skill points and it's really not fun by yourself.
---
The most important in this game is finding friends in your tz. You really need to be able to hangout with people when you're in a corp or you're gonna burn out at some predetermined point, because the game itself is not as fun when you're doing dreary activities by yourself.
---
If you're gonna do pve, please do abyssals, they are much more financially rewarding and you can stick with t1s till you really get a good grasp of the curve of what's going on.
---
lastly, decide what you want to do, be a space hauler, a pirate, a doom fleet tidi warrior, blobber, industrialist, market trader, etc. You need to have an idea of what you enjoy in your head and you need to see what it would be like doing it.

Your question is cute because the web service is sort of meant to be used from your python script and the user friendly UI just helps you write it.
---
Python comes with a module named ‚Äúurllib‚Äù that you can make an HTTP request with. When you download the JSON the request parameters are displayed by the ESI page. You will need to write these into your script. The script then performs the same act as your browser. The JSON will be the body of the response.
---
There is also a neat looking library called Requests if you know how to use PIP. More sophisticated yet, a swagger client generator exists that generates the request/response code for you but idk much about it.
---
I hope you don‚Äôt have to authenticate that‚Äôs harder.

A good group with Tripwire mapping chains is a really good change for me.  I really am surprised how mobile it can be in terms of getting to where you want to get.

Playerbase is kinda equaled out, I think. EVE is still the only MMO worth playing right now, even though it has flaws up the ass that makes me wanna break my keyboard every now and again, but you don't start noticing those until you're pretty far in. 
---
I wouldn't call EVE p2w, it still very much rewards hard/smart work and tactics. 
---
EVE is definitely a game you can sink your teeth in. I probably spend as much  time playing the game without the client running what with authorization software, spreadsheets and fitting tools. You don't have to get to this level, by no means, but the game allows for it. 
---
Join Pandemic Horde if it sounds interesting, probably the best place for a new player right now. 
---
r/evejobs is a good place to drop your own application to join corporations or read what corporations are recruiting.

Joke's on you. Even if you find their structure and it's an Astrahus its final reinforce cycle can last almost 11 days. So you manage to find their 1 structure and it's an astra it will take much longer than a week before you can finally destroy it and end the war. This forces a mutual war, renewed dec, or another war.
---
Forget about the fact they may just be baiting you with that and have a small tower in the ass end of the universe.  
---
CCP needs to fix this shit fast.
---
I just wanna make sure I understand this correctly, if I log into my character in the base (or any base) as long as I dont undock or the structure doesnt get destroyed I can be a permanent resident there?
---
Also the only way to have something get moved to asset safety is if the thing blows up right? Or is there a manual option? 
---
It's no rocket science, lol. Three yield mods in lows, some passive shield tank in mids, a survey scanner, and consider a higgs rig if moon mining.

I say it wouldn't prevent bots from doing what bots do, merely increase starting costs. At the same time, it probably would hurt the occassional newbie, but I think that could be ignored for the sake of making the life for bots harder.   
---
What I think could really improve the situation for CCP is:   
---
1.) Look at bots and their ships (From VNI to Supercarriers to Apocs and Ventures)  
---
2.) Create a software that allows you to monitor players flying these (maybe only if they injected a ton of skills / were recently created to narrow it down)  
---
3.) Now you have a tool that will give you a list of suspects that you really want to look at when you are concerned with new bot accounts created  
---
4.) Ban those that behave like bots  
---
From my personal experience, publishers rarely have tools centered around identifying bots and if they do, they are usually aiming at very narrow patterns. I don't know what CCP has, but if you want to make catching bots easier, you should aim at reducing the problems your personal faces tracking them.   
---
I do think CCP needs better tools for that job, as many obvious bots either need ages to be found or players that highlight them.   
---
In the end, bots will find a way arround that too, but it might help a bit.   
---
We already kinda have the systems through 2fa, just make it mandatory.
---
It wouldn't remove botting, but it would make it a bit more work. without really having any serious disadvantage
---
question is why does he have local open in jita
---
How useful/Important is the faction you choose?
---
Sounds great! I am all for 100% CODE. complainent bios.
---
When BL does more IRL than in-game...
---
Faction warfare plexes help. If I'm in a destroyer and see a cruiser pop up on dscan, I can safely ignore it. And the gates mean I have time to warp off if I decide not to take a fight.
---
I find that most people in FW roam solo, so your chance of getting a good 1v1 scrap is pretty high.
---
bunch autistic adults claim it best mmo ever , meanwhile you can buy everything for a dollah , bots everywhere and very few normies
---
On one of my first times out Deplexing in FW, I got busted up in my Rifter. The dude contracted me a free ship. The fitting was way out of my league. It would have been a while before I could fly it.

Great term. I'll be sure to credit floppythebanjoclown if I ever use it
---
It‚Äôs not even isk efficient to inject with normal injectors as an alpha. I sincerely doubt that this change would effect anything 
---
I mean, I‚Äôm sure most of us would love to do that if we had the spare cash 
---
I mean sergaljerk exists so it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre anti gay or anti weird fetishes or anything.
---
Nice work unit! Looks great!
---
That's one of the reasons, why I prefered a relatively quiet Angels area. It happens that a site gets stolen, but not very often - maybe 5-10% of the time. You quickly learn the names of a few people and can avoid systems with them in local.
---
I started in a Cynabal, then switched to a Gila. Would not recommend a T3C - that's too expensive and a gank magnet. When you enter the last room, go straight for the boss. Attack and approach him immediately and loot the wreck as fast as possible. Cynabal tank is too weak to approach in 4/10s. Still kill the boss first and drop an MTU while doing it. 
---
This. Whole thread is how to farm karma from retards 101

span the client over 2 screens.

Move ship to which ever end of the screen you want.

Do what you described.

What capital and would you sell it?

but getting rid of its most popular counter IE cyno nerf IS NEW.

Probably Dust leftovers.

What the OP asked for would be better.  I have used a tool that worked this way and it was great.  I asked in person for this at Eve Vegas a few years back and was given the impression that it is not something they could do with their existing window manager.  It seems that Eve's sub-windows are restricted to within the root window of the game.
---
Oz
---
in open world it almost do not exist. but you still occasionally find solo pilots (if that is fair) .
---
you could try Abyss pvp, but be prepared to use meta ships , run dungeons a lot and have at least 400mil for starter ships.
---
You could try just fight in test server and do not care, but people still fit full purple here , and most of them fly caps and supers only , at least it is isk-free
---
I started yesterday, Im not trolling... this game is too much things to absorb for a newbie lol
---
I can relate to that üòÇü§£
---
I actually like CQ; it was comfy. I would be pretty happy if WIS became a thing.
---
He got a better job at the university there. A spicy economist job. 
---
Stunning! Think a few bots may hit you up ;)
---
Man I wish I could be that excited by killing a titan again... 
---
But ORE is an abbreviation of [Outer Ring Excavations](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Outer_Ring_Excavations), not Collective.
---
It was a title for piece, cause of the other ships
---
all the players that had 5 barges 4 years ago, esp multiboxers are more likely to instantly go for the big toys   
---
im a solo player who wanted to fly everything, never injected a single SP, 2 years in null and i went from barges and battleships to T2 frigs, destroyers and Carriers/Dreads of all races, able to fly any titan in under 30 days (if i have the skillbook) and i can fly a fully fitted ore/ice rorq w/ excas  
---
Just gank those botting apocs pls
---
How are you losing so many ventures? Maybe we can give you advice on how not to lose them. Also make sure you're not buying way overpriced ventures. You can also look at doing project discovery while you mine, it's a substantial amount of isk for zero risk and zero investment once you ramp it up to 90% accuracy (which should be like 30-45 minutes if you're good).
---
That's correct. As long as you don't undock you can stay.
---
Asset safety can be manually triggered, see: https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289365-Asset-Safety
---
Looks like I need to get back into highsec ganking....
---
Can you give me some more info on project discovery, what is it? And I‚Äôve been losing ventures because I was trying to mine moons if that‚Äôs what you call it, and too much pvpers around there
---
yea, its currently only at the stage of "one node, one shard" as inter-node communication (even w/ blade servers) is terribly complicated, wich is why its good that you nowadays can get some stupid corecounts/ram capacity in a single server
---
Local is always primary.
---
I miss the times of the old chat system where you could enter the rookie chat with a special link to help them all day long.     
---
Good times.
---
People already go out of their way to set up virtual machines to multibox alpha accounts + bots via a VPN
---
Project Discovery should be on your sidebar. There's a pretty comprehensive tutorial, just follow it. Are you mining in lowsec? I wouldn't bother trying to mind in a venture in lowsec, you're just going to die and the extra money isn't really enough to be worthwhile IMO.
---
Lmfao
---
One last question if you dont mind, I plan on instantly leaving the ship once I log out just in case they tear down the structure, but can I still use the hanger as I could normally? Like keep going in out of ships and unfitting and refitting my ships, if that makes sense? 
---
It's shit.
---
I'm an Alpha Noob, been dipping my feet into EVE for the past two months, I'm trying very hard to like this game, its really the only space strategy MMO out there. Every other space MMO on the market is either a non-starter, a fps or highly derivative ( i.e the same old same old ).
---
The potential for rp and story telling is unlimited, and that is a great attraction for me, since I am more into the game behind the game than the game itself.
---
But... I have some serious reservations about sinking too much time into Eve, even more so in actually paying for membership.
---
Here are my concerns.
---
1) They have introduced p2w through skill injectors. The moment that p2w is introduced into a game that's the end. Its irreversible from there. It may take time, but invariably p2w triumphs over all, alienating the older player base and fundamentally changing the game.
---
Personally, and I could be wrong, I think its a strategic direction, a fundamental decision made by the company and its investors, who evaluate the net value of the game and its projected potential earnings in the future. The choice is simple. Remain subscription model only with an aging game in a rapidly evolving game industry, and die, or introduce p2w and stretch out the life a little longer, possibly either enabling update to date new versions or an entirely new game. The last possibility being just to capitalize on past success as much as possible to squeeze out whatever potential profits remain.
---
That said however the resilience of EVE as a unique game, and its dedicated player base, will imo see it continuing for at least another 5 years or so, enabling the likes of us to enjoy its unique game style for the immediate future.
---
2) The community. I expected better than the average MMO. A more mature, intelligent and creative community than what I have been exposed to in the past. And my expectations were met...to an extent. There are many great people playing EVE. But there are also an awfully large number of extremely dim people being highly vocal on the Eve forums, on this sub reddit and in game. Much of my enjoyment of a game comes from interacting with a game's community and if a large proportion of them are mental midgets, uninspiring, unimaginative, unoriginal and just plain moronic, then my enjoyment is curtailed.
---
There are several other concerns, but I think I have negative enough for the moment.
---
On the positive side. Eve is just so unique. If I am going to continue to play then it will be primarily just to see how this game works on a broad scale. There is such a plethora of activities, strategies and tactics and I am keen to see how it all comes together. 
---
Yes, you can.
---
made me chuckle thank you
---
remove alphas
---
It was a fully fit Rorqual, and for the right price I would definitely sell it, but I might try and see if they will accept me in again while doubtful at best before I try to sell it 
---
It is a little far off from where we normally patrol, but if we find a wormhole we will take care of them.
---
There's something about killing a Titan with less than 100 in local that's pretty exciting.  We also didn't actually think we'd get it.
---
what was the tool you used to do this? 
---
Yes the video editing is shit
---
Yes there is no coms 
---
And yes those are bagpipes
---
But is it pretty cool we went 12 vs 45 
---
Hell yes 
---
If You can't get back in.  Mail Kriv Wildheart. I might buy it
---
[https://zkillboard.com/character/1407035906/](https://zkillboard.com/character/1407035906/)
---
no, I result in more dead botters
---
I have mixed feelings for this. I don‚Äôt know the numbers and how much % of isk comes in (minus cash for injecting and ships etc) for each ship type. But lets assume for a moment its 33% for vni‚Äôs. For every char they‚Äôd need to upgrade to omega now which adds alot to the isk spend to create a new toon. The problem is that a vni makes like.. 15m/tick? So about 45m (lets say 50m) each hour. After 100 hours of botting (easily doable) they would‚Äôve made 5b. I dont know how much injectors you need but even if you required 5. You‚Äôd still be even after the plex. So it only takes a botter 100 hours to reimburse the account. Another issue is that this will likely make the plex price go up even more which affects all players.  CCP should look for better bot detection to have bots banned in mere hours instead of days/weeks. 
---
If it's ment to do that, shouldn't there be a tutorial? Or an example?
---
Feel free to contact me in game and we can figure it out :)
---
Yes much better :D. 
---
But seriously, I'm a big fan of you Lussy. When I was a new player I hopped on your stream and you answered plenty of questions I had, in English, to the best of your ability. Always #1 in my &lt;3
---
Eve is always broken &amp; dying since 2003...
---
Looks like homeworld 2
---
Dying for 15 years? 
---
I have seen many so-called epic games that did not last fifth of that time, so yeah, keep it dying for another 15 years, cheers. :D
---
not really, frigates are the quickest to train to 5 remember
---
Thank you for finally putting your drones into groups. It was really making me itch. Also, try using the "E" key to keep at range the FC on your watch list. Make sure you've got the right keep at range distance already set to default, hold down the E key and click on your FC. None of that right clicking nonsense.

---
I‚Äôve got an explosive D 
---
I would assume people that are enthusiastic with WIS are the same people that spend most of their time ship spinning and chatting, instead of undocking their ship. I personally never bother with captain quarter; when I login to Eve, I want to undock and immediately find target to shoot at..
---
You should heat your guns lol. Dying anyway
---
Sp injection can not be fixed.
---
Even citadel damage caps are bad
---
&gt; Much of my enjoyment of a game comes from interacting with a game's community and if a large proportion of them are mental midgets, uninspiring, unimaginative, unoriginal and just plain moronic, then my enjoyment is curtailed.
---
You just perfectly described what 99% of humanity looks like to me. You will get used to it. Or not. Either way, you will die sooner or later, so it does not matter that much. :D 
---
I would say, the real challenge in EVE is finding a good bunch of people to play with, then you can play anyway you like. 
---
But sadly, i have to agree on the p2w part, i play for less than a week and i already reached the alpha ceiling for exploration skills and without them, i will never be able to reliably explore relic and data sites, which is a thing i found i really like doing in EVE. :(
---
Maybe because whatever proof you think you have is not worth shit?
---
They predate dust but where and why, not sure
---
No, go away.
---
I know, I expect a lot of downvotes :P
---
Fuck off.

\*whoosh\*

Basically just pvp now.  Used to do t2 processing and market trading on large scales.

Hi this is Mark calling from CCP regarding recent activity on your account could you confirm your date of birth and the last 4 digits of your bank account.

It does prove shit. Because the guy is dumb and clearly shown in the video I provided he wants to sell his stuff.

---
No such thing -- none of the names are on screen long enough for them to become well known, they're replaced by 50 other people in 3 seconds.
---
Not at all. The faction you pick determines the look of your character, your starting location in the universe and the basic ship skills you get. However, you can easily move to any other area and training the same basic ship skills for other factions takes almost no time.
---
So in the end, there is no noticeable gameplay difference between the various factions.
---
What broke? Possibly your head, no clue what‚Äôs wrong
---
They bot almost 24/7 they have lots of time to get the investment back. Setting it up is not a detraction, it is an investment.

"hello people whos space im in, please come fairly fight my expensive t2 ship"

doesnt work fam. my method is to gank crabs. hold em hostage and people will start following you

keep warping around and gating till you split them enough to kill them
---
My char is now almost 6 years old, tried it a few times, never for a time longer than 6 months... I am at 46m SP now lol
---
6 years and counting.
---
If the people in your Corp don‚Äôt like you asking questions you should find a better Corp.
---
Actual human playerbase has been steadily declining for quite some time, with the online player count staying roughly steady due to an increased need to multibox the past few years. PVP activities of all types have also gone downhill significantly as a result of misguided updates, which for a lot of people is the main attraction.
---
You'd be best to try out for yourself, you might not really care about the issues, but the game is definitely on the decline.
---
Faction and navy doesn't require level 5, so they're often really good for new people who have t2 weapons/fit
---
They look like twin 50s so if filled with higher pressure you are looking at a comfortable 45m dive right there. Great for wrecks.
---
Good for you, but that's ugly man... [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74903647/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74903647/)

People already use WH to move their stuff

Probably best to just say what you're trying to make, chances are it already exists.
---
Don't let ccp see this
---
Are you retarded?
---
Undock your ship, warp to a safe, warp an alt in ... and fight yourself. Most fair fight you can get in eve.
---
God I want HW3 so bad. The remaster is nice but got boring fast and the desserts of Karakh or whatever is just not the quality of HW2. 
---
I'm getting old. Warped in on a noob in a lowsec ano yesterday but let him go, he was just a poor target and already half dead in his cane...
---
Who is BOLD?

I am still on track to get my fist solo kill before 2020.
---
no u
---
Nice job, cheers to many more!

Safe pvp mmm yummy

OP will go around the bend
---
very nice
---
There is no fair fights in EvE.

Scourge. didn't suppose to live for a year considering the high level of toxicity of initial members

But here we are

Well why would trade hubs have static or always wormholes that are close it ? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense since the are random and only J space has static

imagine if someone where to merge Homeworld w/ eve online (eve ships and lore and eve gameplay and mechanics) 
---
Can you do the angel cartel?

When Fc calls local  primary I can't help myself but sperg out. It's a test thing.

as short as the test vs co2 war was it was so much fun, hurricane/drake brawls with the winner decided by who goes out of stock lol.

good times.
---
The brand concept of shower thought is that they are suppose to stay in the shower.
---
Mastery isn't much. There's a ton of stuff that's on mastery tabs that will benefit less  your ships than certain skills like caldari and galente frigate, navigation skills or tank. Navigation skills on garmur are particularly good for better handling, acceleration, less cap required that will benefit you more than shield kinetic resistance for example.
---
Thank bob for you voice of reason in this see of autism
---
thanks niv, very cool!
---
Not few days after The Judge liberation day?
---
First of all I applaud your entrepreneurial spirit, there are however some issues with your idea.
---
 Null probably won't work since you'll be shot on sight and even if you manage to stay alive you won't have access to the markets(except for NPC null). And even if you manage to get an order up, since you will be away again, your control range over your order will not be sufficient so if(when) you get undercut your order will just sit there.
---
Lowsec I have less experience with but some problems I can foresee are quite similar to the null problems described above, bar the market access.
---
"New players" haha. Good one, how exactly are we supposed to tell these days.  
---
Gone are the days when you can get a good idea of skill from the characters birthday.  
---
Gone are the days when you can be sure that wasn't a bot.  
---
The quality of a fit no longer suggests noob but bot instead.  
---
I used to do this back in the day. But not anymore.
---
yeah, Judge said fuck you to a loot of good content 
---
TRI+CO2vsLegacy was actually something interesting to watch
---
Maybe because you are submitting tickets instead of sending an email to security@ccpgames.com
---
Then link it here
---
why didnt you broadcast for reps on your rev? no fax? 
---
CCP doesn't take video as evidence, video can be altered.
---
logs is the only thing that counts.
---
Sending retarded tickets doesn't do anything else than make other tickets slower. Report bot/rmt/whatever -&gt; move on with your life

So I should go the other way around, join a Corp in sovnull and go fetch stuff in hs? :D
---
How do you know if your Undock Bookmark is good quality? 
---
So, I set an Off-grid Insta-undock at 40,000 km off of one of the hubs. I undocked a T1 Indy and chose WarpTo 0, there is a slight hesitation, maybe half of 1 second where it doesn't say aligning or anything....and then I'm gone.  
---
Good to go, or do I need to start again?

What is local?
---
Have you heard of this thing called PLEX that you can buy for isk, lol?
---
Or you could just join it, it's under the help Chanel's, my 4 year old character is in there most of the time
---
he sure did, when i think of eve my fondest memories come from that war, to this day it's the most active i've ever been in-game.
---
last i heard he was planning on making a corp , did he end up quitting ?
---
WELCOME TO LOW SEC BIATCH
---
didnt bring faxes. also he was still in siege so rip
---
Alpha is a just a trial mode buddy 
---
If its directly in line with your undock you're fine, you undock with 100% velocity and can therefore warp if your desto is within alignment.
---
There is / was a 6 second Invulnerability timer once you undock, so you should be fine - but in Jita you might get bumped by all those ships around so watch out.
---
Also you want to undock with your pod or any ship before so you preload the grid, my PC takes forever to load outside Jita grid and therefore I lost a Jackdaw once... just some usefull tipp I can give you.  
---
ot *-- Thats why you should fcking anchor your fcking Keepstar pointing to the fcking gate and not some fcking random direction. --*

I was there.

#freegigx
---
Autocad does this
---
Its pretty good
---
No doubt that those bots are a problem too, the majority of bots are alphas though and it would be a big step forward getting rid of them.
---
Autocad does this (I keep the layer manager and properties on my second monitor). Make sure you post this on the ideas forum. 
---
there is a corp in Horde called co2. some members have joined that i heard.
---
There is a corp called co2 in ph with some old faces but idk who is boss there. Hopefully gigx is still playing somehow and just avoiding the goon vate train or smth
---
For me it is the only real MMO and only MMO worth playing! Of course i dislike some things like injectors from one point of view... but on the other hand it allows new players to get fast into something bigger!
---
I started don¬¥t know when again 2007 or so and i still can remember my first lowsec fight (me loosing a mega because of trying to get the bounty of a pirate) .... or dying to another pirate while i was flying my first bc and he killed me inside assault frig... there was this feeling about danger all over the place that thrilled me so much combined with the possibilities to do what I like to do most  (building, npcing, exploring ..... ) ... and after all this time a lot of this is still there! I¬¥m really hoping CCP will not go on jumping on this train running arround to max profit out of everything no matter what will be the outcome ( like a dead place because of selling out everything). I really love Eve because it is more than just clicking keys and mouse! So i¬¥m keeping my fingers crossed that CCP is understanding that they have something unique ... no matter what bittervets are saying!
---
I lost all my money in highsec getting camped by pirate in baby zone.
---
I really don't know what to do now.
---
ah good to hear, he's probably having a good time shitting on our deployment haha
---
Metagame 2019
---
Damage caps on citadel make some sort of sense to keep a fleet on grid for a certain time and give the defender the possibility to react and spark a fight (at least that's the theory). 
---
If you put damage cap on ships, we would also need either a repair cap for logis or just remove them entirely.
---
And at the current state of the game, we need titans to die faster, not slower ;)
---
I remember after we would do sov ops we would reinforce the jump bridge on our way home. Sometimes they would send a fax or dread and we got some nice kills. We were passing through on judgment night and got to see the chaos. Goons buying fire sale supers and SDing on the undock was funny and sad.
---
Fucking Jugde. I was having a blast!
---
i hope so, that would be the best course of action  
---
As a new player who already tried 3 times to get in the game. I lost all my 15 millions made in my first week in one hour by pirates camping in high sec.
---
I really do not want to play the game anymore if I simply can't play.
---
&gt; Buy should of course say Sell
---
But it did not, hard to call me ideologically oppossed then when I was just reading right
---
&gt;after we would do sov ops
---

Awesome fight. Every time I see a video of yours I realise how bad I am at eve haha

Well my primary reason is to learn to code, so even if it's already been done I want to do it better.

You know, in the long-long-ago-times, we had something like a chat channel where you could see people in the same system.

Then CCP lured it into its basement with the promise to improve it... And did horrible things to it. It was never the same as it used to be... Just a broken, mostly silent shadow of it's former self...

True that - complaining about Injectors is the result of the capital shitstorm. The faster we figgure out what the real problem is, the longer ccp can ignore it!
---
$20 or even a 100 is very little to start up a bot farm. most people also have families/friends who they can bum a phone number off of for stuff like this, i did this for 2 alt accounts on steam

a lot of the bot farms run for months or even years

Wow! Excellent tip for preloading grid...I had no idea if that long dark screen was a problem or if there was any way around it. Thanks!

It's not necessary to be a professional diver to do some diving in the winter, where I live winter is usually the best season for diving, specially for teaching newbies into lakes. 
---
It's cold and you'll see almost nothing but it's the best environment to learn and control stress under water. 
---
Joining a nullsec corp is a way to do it but due to wardec mechanics flying in HS on that character will become increasingly more dangerous so what most people do in that case is have an out-of-corp alt in a HS tradehub buy the items, fly them to the start of the WH chain and trade the items over to the character in corp or use the services available in nearly all nullsec alliances to use jump freighters to move stuff in.
---
This will limit you to only being able to use the tradehub of your alliance and the alliances blue to you and the competition will be fierce.

Hey last issues where month ago ... it is February after all
---
Lol? Goon hate train? He was banned by CCP not Goons. He was perma  banned for a reason and even if he tries to avoid that ban he should be banned on those accounts as well. He took a video game too seriously and threatened player(s). I don't think he needs to be praised. I'll wait for the downvotes though.
---
As a Russian, I think he wasnt mad when he typing it. + I'm pretty sure he is not a newbie, just some alt character)
---
when are they meant to be doing the rollback to old chat?
---
This dino speaks truth:
---
The Skills you want to focus training:
---
Engineering:
---
Power Grid Management
---
Weapon Upgrades
---
CPU Management
---
Capacitor Management
---
These are core skills and beneft all your ships as they give you more powergrid,cap and cpu to work out good fits.
---
Seeing that you used a garmur:
---
Spaceship command:
---
Caldari/gallente frig
---
Missles(most important support skills for missiles - the other ones are not that important on small missiles and can be skilled later):
---
Rapid Launch
---
Warhead Upgrades
---
Missile Projection
---
Target Navigation Prediction
---
Navigation:
---
Acceleration Control
---
Evasive Maneuvering
---
High Speed Maneuvering
---
Navigation
---
The masteries given by the devs are not representing the most effective playstyle of the ships.
---
I would suggest skilling these skills to 4 first and then train them to 5 to get the max benefits in the short term. Go for Engineering first as they benefit ALL your ships. Go for spaceship command then as they give good bonuses to the garmur and also open up ships that can be used in fleet (ceptors,assault frigite, bomber mainly) and then navigation. Dps is not the most important stat of the garmur. Garmurs try to keep range and keep out of harms way. So actual missles skills are secondary for a low skillpoint char that wants to be effective in garmurs.
---
Shoot you in space.
---
Do you think the same about theft in your local store?
---
Just because some cunts do it, you don't have to follow step.
---
why is the cost to injecting increased? If they're going to go omega _anyway_ in order to fly a nyx, what's the barrier? 
---
Depends where they live lol hs maybe a couple bill, ns maybe 30-40 bill, ns delve 80-100b
---
When I used to go cave diving twin 95's were great as they were alot lighter than a full set of 104's and most of the FL shops gave you a cold full so you got plenty of air in them. Quit few years after Steve Berman died in Ginnie.

Agree. I turned the video off when it cut back.

Anything that would lead to a decrease in skill injector use CCP with go in the 100% opposite direction. 
---
Average Joe right here, living out of NPC Null and I'm sitting on approx 30 bill
---
There isn't one, he didn't consider people injecting all the way to a Nyx. 
---
Cunts in local store have to face consequences.
---
Same SOV null and ~40bil mostly from exploration
---
We do this in Solitude (high sec island surrounded by low/null).
---
Few direct high to high wormholes every week as long as someone is scanning.
---
I consider myself slighly above the average Line member in delve, and i have maybe 300b in ships, assets and isk
---
wait you cant rep dreads in siege? i tought that was only triage that couldnt do that    
---
TIL

i just wanna be in my Ion array frigate and cloaky camp w/ my lazer cannon at the ready to mess up Cruisers

eve has always been blatant p2w because of multiboxing/plex. injectors just cranked it up to 11.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what the issue is here. This has been possible for a long, long time.

---
Grads dude. Now you need to go kill a bunch of MTU's and youll be ELITE.
---
good content
---
I'm 2 years into the game, I must have like 2bil in my wallet and maybe 5bil in assets. But I really don't like farming, and I also switch corp every 3 to 6 months which doesn't help with maintaining wealth in the long run.
---
DEJA VU
---
That was a sick bubble though.
---
&gt;go cave diving
---
nope... nope hell nope
---
I wasn't calling you ideologically opposed.  I said some people are, which is true.
---
In addition to what the other guys said. 
---
You also need to watch out for the other guys in the Null Corp manufacturing their own stuff. 
---
If they source all the sub-materials locally and manufacture it then chuck it up on the market in Null they have already cut out all the costs associated with transferring/paying someone to haul it to HS to begin with so can likely list it cheaper than you will ever be able to given you then want to chuck yet another hauling fee on top of the HS product to bring it back to Null again.
---
This would depend hugely on what "null" you go to and which corp/alliance you join. Any of the major ones should be able to undercut Jita quite happily if they want to blowing your potential hauling out the water. Whether they want to and what they are actually producing are of course big unknowns and liable to change.
---
Awesome!
---
200b Liquid about 500b in assets. Not counting SP. Ns Delve been there 3 years.
---
I know. And in today's time of lootboxes and undeniably p2w chinese android shitfests, i am not even mad. 
---
If there was no alpha, i would have never tried this game in the first place. And given how exploration (and not just that) really struck all the right places in me, after a week of playing, i am already seriously considering paying for omega. 
---
So, judging from me, it does its job. 
---
The deadline was "end of January", according to that one dev blog. They said they would begin investigating a possible rollback then, so it might still take a while. Software rollbacks are usually ugly and if you fuck up, there's always the possibility that it's even more broken than before the rollback.
---
Yeah if mining in dangerous space the higgs rig is amazing. Make a ping 13k behind the asteroid. Warp to that in your barge and align to the athanor. Should almost be full when you get out of range.
---
The add i get when reading that article 
---
Is BOLD recruiting?! 
---
Only miners play eve online in hardcore mode
---
Manic Velocitys farts :D
---
Lots of people don't make 15 dollars per hour in less developed countries, sometimes it around 30 dollars per day.
---
best idea, will not happen, creates money, money good, more money more good
---
Bullshit.
---
Pvping is rarely limited by ISK or skills. It's the entire mindset of "I'll pvp when i'm ready" that holds you back.
---
I flew all kinds of expensive ships in pvp in all kinds of different situations, yet I still get a lot of enjoyment flying a 60m cruiser. 
---
Why would they need to buy a new phone for each of them? Having just one phone works fine and you can even hotswap SIM cards while the phone is on nowadays.
---
And this is one of the reasons no other game can compete with eve 
---
Good on you dude!
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** Duck_Troland! ^(hug)

I like miners they literally keep the market going

Miners rise up.

5,50‚Ç¨ is about a third of a month of subscription (about 15‚Ç¨)

---
When I'm solo, I'm dualboxing my main and a scout in the other side of the gate cloaked at a perch.
---
My main is usually either in a hull tanked, triple sebo'd, rail Gnosis, or a passive (regen) tanked, RLML, triple sebo'd Onyx that can tank gate guns infinitely. Other notable choices are the other hics, but my favourite is the Onyx, because of the infinity gategun tank, and RLMLs deal with frigs who try weird things with their transversal.
---
Regarding the scout ship I'm usually lazy, and it is just a taxiceptor with a cloak. Better choices are a cloaky dps (incase something bigger comes in), cloaky recon (supporting the kill and/or helping to bail out), blockade runner (to loot industrials) or cyno / covert cyno ship (to escalate).
---
Also, I always have zkill open and check almost everyone that comes through before tackling, to see possible baits, scouts or solo pilots who seek fights (instead of just passing through), and to react/reship/prepare to escalate accordingly.
---
you know what would hurt botters? shut down the servers.that would stop them. SHUT THEM DOWN
---
One of the best ways to make a hunter and create fake killboard losses is to fly it around like this, and just purposefully get ganked in low sec and cry in local, "I've lost everything I have." Every single time, the hunter gets isk, without fail. 
---
Yes you can but are you sure it's worth losing that many skill points (months of training) just to save less than 10‚Ç¨ you could get by working maybe 1 hour in RL?  
---
It's a very bad trade you're trying to do there.
---
Ok everybody stop shooting other peoples' ships and start mining. I'm sure we can all sell all the stuff we produce.
---
&gt;I don't see no point in all this miners                
---
same here
---
Yeah just chiming in to confirm that.
---
As a sub-5m SP character, a Large Skill Injector would give you 500,000 SP for  872,688,000.00 ISK (today's value) - roughly 1,745.38 ISK per skillpoint.
---
A Daily Alpha Injector gives you 50,000 SP for  59,699,786.31 ISK  - Roughly 1,194 ISK per skillpoint.
---
The economy of it gets even better once you are above 5m SP, as you can still use the daily injectors until you are 20m SP I believe, but diminishing returns will have kicked in for regular Skill Injectors.
---
&gt; people still mining in 2019
---
Ore is mined since 2003, game needs no more ore. Ore is just being ping-ponged between people, haha I have 1 ore, haha I have 50 isk, and vice versa.
---
&gt; people falling for the meme that Rorquals are mining, instead of being pvp bait beacons with their drones out, idling
---
This gets me every time.
---
Wait really? Last time I checked it was still a hidden channel for &lt;31d old chars and when I used my old link, it said that I had no permission to join
---
finally a thread goons want to pvp in
---
I was like that for 2 years as well 
---
Just elaborating on point 2 - the real enemy behind botting is RMT schemes. They can't trace the money to RMTers until the ISK is actually generated.
---
So yes, a moderate amount of botting must be tolerated to follow the ISK trails. This is similar to real life strategies used by law enforcement in letting 'small fish' get away so it leads them to ring leaders - which is generally viewed favourably upon as producing better results in curbing the activity than just locking up all the low level offenders.

who?

Came to troll, upvoted this comment instead.
---
Gallentean planets
---
Or try Karmafleet (not sure which corp you used to be in) they usually have a more lenient acceptance policy., at least then you'll be part of Goonswarm again and you wouldn't be hostile anymore.
---
I don't think that is what he's saying at all.
---
There *is* a negative attitude towards people who mostly pve/mine.
---
&gt;I love to mine and watch Netflix
---
I love to cure cancer and masturbate over anime
---
Woah lad.
---
My hot take with no malice with it. Change the rorqs. Biggest thing that. Caps v caps wouldnt have been so prevalent if we didnt have the fast as fuck production.
---
Then we go the HS wars which ill be honest i wasnt happy at first about nullsec fucking with the HS guys but this is a great place to get rid of the cancer caps and people should try fights there more often.
---
I forgot the name of the highslot that allows you to target ships very quickly with carriers and supers. Those should not work that well on non npc ships.
---
Lastly i feel people arent looking at it as the problem it clearly is but looking at this problem with nostalgia goggles on. Its obscuring the issue
---
Greatest time of all. Warp fleet to zero and dgaf
---
There are a lot of people who could spend the money but they just don't like to. They spent 50 bucks each weekend to get drunk and then they don't want to spent any money on games.  
---
Doesn't mean that's the case with op but there are certainly people like that.  
---
He's also from germany (as am I) which isn't a poor country and there are very few people here who don't even have 15‚Ç¨ to spend on a hobby once a month.  
---
I'm just saying that the problem **most likely** isn't that he's poor, but it's probably his priorities that prevent him from paying an additional 10‚Ç¨ instead of losing a couple million SP.  
---
And that's fine if that is how he wants to prioritize his expenditures.
---
How much does it cost to inject up to that?
---
also if you mine and craft your own stuff its all free
---
&gt;I don't think that is what he's saying at all.
---
But I am.
---
I mine with 2 rorqs. Doesn't mean i would habe 7 or 7 accounts instead if it wasn't for rorqs. 
---
Most likely I'd semi afk run a few VNIs or carrier rat.
---
this doesn't even make sense. Unless you're trying to make the link between jews and gas, which makes you an absolute cretin.
---
Eve is really good for this, the stakes and organisation required to play Eve encourage it. When I was in Veto those cunts would pick me up when I was in a bad place, miss those bastards.
---
Why cure cancer? Cancer is one of the few good things we have left. 
---
I can confirm the second part, that is the best. 
---
AlL uV eVE
---
As long as the Nonni's stays
---
Play the game as you like it, ofc they will hate on you when you don't play the game "their" way, which is ofc the ONLY possible, the absolutely BEST way!
---
Poor guys. 
---
Did you make much doing DED sites? I've considered trying it in high sec purely for something chilled out to do but I never expect more than 20m an hour so haven't actually done it
---
What? Getting the pod? Why?
---
Gallente obvs
---
How much isk would you get as just one person since you can only gank t1 haulers realistically? I'm guessing it depends a lot where you are in what region etc as well
---
Damage caps are only prevented from being the greatest failure in eve online via not allowing repairing.  An active tanked or remote repaired ship with a damage cap would be the dumbest fucking thing possible.
---
The only option we've got at the moment is to make EVE a fixed window and select a resolution that spans on both your monitors. 
---
After that you use the camera offset slider to offset your ship on either of the screens. Make sure you click the "Offset interface with camera" checkbox so HUD text is offset as well. 
---
To the top you go
---
Why are you mixing big and little letters in the same word?
---
You‚Äôre doing it too
---
Which roles are required to transfer corp structures? Must it be CEO or Director, or would Station Manager do the trick? Also, same Q but for anchoring structures.
---
There is a negative attitude towards everyone who doesn't play eve-online the exact same way or in the exact same space-guild as the person posting most the time.   
---
See: lol 0.01 Iskers, lol lowsec, lol wormholes, lol small gang, lol solo pvp, lol frigates, lol FW, lol capitals, lol TEST/Goons/Horde/PL/NC/Enter Alliance that basically plays the game the exact same way as my alliance but they aren't my alliance/  
---
Since reddit is mostly veteran nullsec players that's what the viewpoint is going to be in most cases. 
---
I mine as Well. If we don't like there are no minerals  if there are no minerals no ships and modules can be build and Then the pvp'ers don't have ships and modules to do pvp with they can say whatever they want but without miners they don't have ships or anything to do pvp with.

---
Welcome to wormholes

You're on the internet, your personal info is already bought and sold many times.

Im just a poor player. I don't need billions of isk i don't fly supers  
---
A lot of MMOs go this way, getting easier and safer to appeal to a more casual audience. Eg World of Warcraft.
---
No they don't escalate unfortunately. Would be nice if they dread bombed capitals, maybe if there is a sotiyo within 7LY of that system to be realistic, could be a fun surprise :D
---
something like this? [http://i.imgur.com/UeEqQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UeEqQ.jpg)
---
EVE was at war with Asteroids. EVE had always been at war with Asteroids.
---
they carnt even make chat work you think they could pull this off?
---
Miners are fine.
---
Miners who try to turn places like null into Weenie Hut Jr. levels of safety I dislike.
---
Yeah, why would they hide it, the whole point is to have older players help the newer ones, hiding it for players over 30 days old would defeat its purpose
---
How do you take advantage of it? Drive the price down, then buy out the bots at the crashed price?
---
&gt;  If the game turns into some sort of "Offworld Trading Company" with EvE content I would be really happy

---
You don't understand even a little of why he was so upset?  Really?  
---
He poured years of his life into something that meant a lot to him (regardless of what that something was), made a lot of what he thought were friends, and wakes up early one morning to shitloads of PMs to find a worthless piece of shit that he trusted took it all from him.  You've never even once in your life gotten angry and shouted "ffs, I'm going fkn KILL THEM when I get my hands on him" and, y'know, not actually killed them?  If so, I'm actually borderline jealous of your hold on your emotions.
---
Yes he got outplayed, yes he got metagamed, and yes, ultimately he probably deserved a ban on the balance of things because of how far he went, but I think some understanding of his outburst would have been nice.  
---
You think people wouldn't pay 35m isk to dunk a fleet of morons?  Of course they would.  People pay 35m isk to DD a dread for fun.
---
'Insert from false PCU metrics like a bad'...
---
If you stop being a whney entiled little bitch for a second, you can look at the [PCU chart Here](https://i.imgur.com/3aJ0uzF.png) and see that PCU was pretty good untill 2014, which was incidentally the Phoebe expansion that nerfed offensive capital projection...
---
PCU 2013 was around the probe system change.  
---
PCU 2014 was just before capital jump changes, right when they added balanced legion ships.
---
Since PCU 2014 we say increased Subcap power creep, starting in 2013 with Balanced Legion and Nano-SoE.  Then we saw T3D going in 2014 to 2015.  Just after PCU 2015 was the 'fighter' patch.
---
PCU 2016 was Alpha clone patch.
---
This is like some bullshit temperature anomaly shit right here.  You cannot blame low player counts for things that happened after the player counts dropped.
---
Just commenting to say that track is IMMENSE, I listen to his stuff everyday at work.
---
I've been playing for about two years, sitting on ~10b liquid and roughly 500b in assets
---
we need changes to introduce risk back into the game. citadel rework. require sov to anchor upwell structures with asset safety enabled, exclude supers and titans from it. give people reasons to blow up other people's shit again.
---
This would've been my guess too 
---
death to krabs

I have about tree fiddy

Yeah Russians managed to bot it in a way that would pass the game checks but send pretty garbage data up. There was a big ban wave a few months ago for it.

they got retagged on the permafrost event, the second event they have dropped from.  they also seemed to be more rare than the first event.  but like others are saying, they don't expire, just means they came from a limited event.  The first skins to have these tags were the liberation and I suspect all future skins from events will have them as well

730 billion in assets and 191 million SP on my main. Been playing since mid 2015

Does ur mwd work down there?
---
it was before they tethered you could apply aggro with smartbombs or ecm bursts.
---
And this is what makes the game fun. My alliance isn't necessarily better than yours, but claiming that it is and then fighting it out ingame is fun. I can't see anything wrong with this.
---
I need no point when mining. That roids dont warp away.
---
I was doing some player count analysis while arguing with another poster, then I saw this and it stood out.
---
Empirical evidence is showing that the Phoebe patch was one of the largest contributors to PCU decline in eve history.
---
Can already span the client to a second monitor and move the center point to the main monitor. I would rather have them focus on more important things then do something already possible.

It's hard to give an ISK/hour figure. The income is very inconsistent - can be great in one hour and abysmal in another. I made maybe 30-50M per hour? But I chilled a lot, cleared the sites, didn't bother to use the missiles at all or used autotargeting missiles... If you hurry up and blitz the sites, I think close to 100M/hour should be possible.
---
The good thing with Angels is, that they drop many useful modules. Top is the C-Type adaptive invul field, which is not as expensive as the Gurista one. But besides the shield mods, they also have afterburners and MWDs, which are worth ~100M.
---
The money is in rated Angels and in unrated Drones combat sites. Don't run unrated Angels or rated Drones sites - they are all bad. The last stage of an Angels expedition can drop nice stuff, but you need a lot of luck and effort to get there - not worth it. Drone expeditions are good except the last stage.
---
You can also run the Refuge and Den anomalies - for Angels they escalate to 5/10. But this brings the "inconsistent" part to a new level...
---
Lmao, good one. I too support someone who gets so emotional over a video game where he acts out in a threatening manner. Good for you bud.

No, he sincerely asked for The Judges IRL info and threatened to cut off his hands and threatened to come to the CSM summit to deal with him. Fuck that guy. Btw I can't believe I'm arguing this point at this moment. Am I crazy at this point? Hasn't this dude at that point had multiple infractions about violence towards other players at that point?

How often have you seen people commending small groups for having a PVP focus?

How often are PVE focused groups bashed instead?

As far as I am concerned people can say mean things on the internet, don't get me wrong.

people sem to forget that you only get cheap spaceships from miners and the army or roquals

No fuel/Low power --&gt; no tethering --&gt; no asset safety
---
Sounds simple to me and inside the lore that citadels replace POS, that had no FF when not fueled and thus no safety for assets.
---
Who wants to store assets safe has to use NPC Stations, theres enough of them (maybe some NPC Systems with station in Drone Regions are missing)

No, quit making facts out of nonsense. Since mining got pushed that hard (and the average number of accounts per players has risen) the number of logged in accounts is in steady decline. A normal primetime Saturday count was between 50k and 65k logged in accounts. Today we are happy when we top 40k on weekends. Taking into account that the average Rorqual Mining Dude today has lots more accounts than the average player 5 years ago, and that even less accounts log in it is a pure logical thing that the number of real players has declined massively ...
---
Playing for 12 years but never had more than 20bn. Changed my play-style last year from full running all missions to speed running and burners and when abyss came out I started those and Isk went up to 85bn Liquid and 87bn Assets.

---
You want to look into OAuth2 and how that works. There's probably an existing Python library for that but I've never used OAuth with Python so I'm not sure.
---
Basically you need to set up a client over at the eve developer site which will give you a client secret and id. You pass those to the server along with any of the scopes documented in the API. It will ask you to login with your account, select a character and confirm that you want to allow the client to access the requested scopes. You will then get an access token back that you can then use to make requests to the JSON endpoints. Check out the requests library in Python for that. It's actually rather simple to use even for beginner programmers. The OAuth part is probably harder.
---
Hey OP, I don't think people hate miners.
---
 I think they hate that end game mining is easily achievable (injectors), done in the tankiest capital ship in the game (rorqual), has an invulnerability module (panic) and is often saved by the sov holder's supercap umbrella, which is heavily subsidised by rorqual miners. When they do sometimes die, they often save all the excavs in a wetu so the actual loss isn't that much.
---
Noob, you want to learn how to scam people? Buy my book on scamming only 1bill isk. You will make it back in a day.
---
So the Mittani tried to encourage people to make a guy kill himself and that makes what Gigx tried/threaten to do makes it ok. That makes sense to me.
---
I've had an alt actively trading in jita for a few years now. I enjoy lots of other stuff in eve but keeping my market orders in top, well, that keeps me warm and fuzzy.

These were up yesterday, the two packs come to like 892 plex or something, was about 3.3bn isk for all of them.

It doesn't.

However it set a precedence for how CCP should punish such matters.

The skins don't even look that great

funny, cause all structures go low power once put in hull.

People do this in video games all the time tbh

700 mil in isk, 300 mil in assets for me. I‚Äôm trying lol.

Wormholes within a couple jumps of Jita are constantly camped. I'd be careful.

EVE has bots?
---
I think it's  not so much introducing risk. I think the real important part is creating a spectrum of risk/reward from high sec to low sec to null to wh space. Right now there's just not enough feasible methods of generating isk throughout the universe. That way care bears can do their thing in hs, newbros can ease into the game through starting in ls, large groups can brawl over sov and small groups can explore wh space.

I used to work at a dive shop as a fun job, but I'm purely in it for the sport right now.  Would like to get back into guiding or teaching though.  Anyway I lied a bit in the OP, I'm actually doing some cave stuff down in Florida.  I do a bunch of tech diving though so I'm just as comfy with the twins as I am with my singles at this point.

They are a bit bigger (and sadly heavier).  LP 95s.  I have taken them as far at 240' or roughly 75m down.  Using a drysuit this weekend though so I like having the extra weight.
---
That can be changed, so that fueling (aka the "active play style" CCP claims they want to encourage) actually gives a benefit, like it did on POS.
---
They feel a bit weird the first few times compared to singles.  Once you get the hang of em they arn't so bad.  I kind prefer them at this point.  Even when not doing super long deco stuff it is nice to not have to change out tanks between dives, especially if the boats rolling.

Eight days old and this is pretty much all I do solo in high sec. It gives me the free time to do the math on different stuff. Though I've been blowing money just to figure out what stuff does two days ago I set my mind on saving up for a Praxis mining rig build for the long haul grind for omega. 75 Million isk in two days doesn't seem bad. Later today I should be able to trade in my venture.

So, by all means, the rorqual change had NOTHING to do with a decline of players (as it happened late 2016 and actually increased the numbers back up to 34k for the year), as the big decrease happened in 2014, 2015 and 2016 before rorqual/Alpha changes.

spoopy newbies. It's the wh division of brave alliance. I was with them for 2 years and would highly recommend them. Stable corp with active player base unlike a lot of other WH corps that just disappear in a few months they also have a a few of decent programs in place like resource buyback etc. They plan occasional stuff together though I never really did anything as a group with them I'm too much of a carebear. Nice Group of people though and you get access to the wider brave alliance so if WH is really too dead you can take a day trip to brave home base for some action. Tripwire is also very often updated with good bookmarks, so I've never really found myself waiting long to get into a WH chain to get to their base in wh. Only reason I left was  because I personally got tired of wh life, it was too much work for the few hours/minutes I played every month.

OHHHHH. Thank you for context. Now that you linked it, yeah I think it would be useful for some people, especially to those with more than 1 screen. Great visualization of the idea though, man.

---
Trust me.
---
Should be OK. Note that the server works with a 1 second update interval, so when you give the command to go to warp, you don't actually enter warp until the next tick, which could be as much as a second later. But when you undock you're temporarily invulnerable until you take actions and your invulnerability will also only drop with the next server tick, at the same time your warp drive engages.
---
Another thing to note is that some stations (including Jita 4-4) don't eject you in exactly the same direction each time. There's a small amount of variation around the central ejection axis. If your undock BM is made on one end of this variability and some time later you undock at the other end, then there may be some additional delay before you enter warp as the ship has to course-correct. This should only be an issue if you fly something really slow (a freighter for example). To be extra-mega-safe, you could repeat the BM creation a few times and then visually inspect the set of bookmarks and select the one that is the most central.

- You prove my statement of steady decline from 2013 on. Thanks for that o7
---
- The short increase at the end of 2016 was Alpha Accounts, and it lasted exactly the timespan Alpha Accounts reach their Alpha Skill SP limit
---
- You did not understand what I was saying on the PLEX/real money issue. Yes the Plex4ISK buyers net CCP exactly that money a PLEX4realmoney buyer has put into the pot earlier. Is that so hard to understand? If the 2nd party stops feeding plex market with their real money all the people subbing their accounts with ingame time/ISK wont give CCP any money. 
---
thx :3
---
Were you outranging the caracals?
---
If not, Missiles apply evenly up until their range, no falloff. The question is, why not burn into Antimatter range and start melting face? What's the advantage of using spike and holding out at their missile range? 
---
Does this mean your tanks provide provide pure cocaine after 2 hours and you disappear underwater for 6 months?
---
That's only half the truth though. They also replace outposts, which always kept assets safe.
---
That being said, I'd like a more direct copy of the old features.      
---
Forts without tether as outpost replacement and something to safe up in with supers.
---
Maybe just keep the medium citadels with tether?
---
Without something much more  alike of POS shields than tether, I don't think keeps should be removed.       
---
I freely admit, that I don't miss the space coffin times.
---
Both got punished by ccp accordingly to the time. Why is this even an argument? 
---
You spelled Horde corp wrong
---
&gt;Am I crazy at this point? 
---
You¬¥re a gon so you have no leverage in any morality based argument. No matter what you might say or think, you endorse and support unethical rl behavior simply by being a gon. If you want to add substance to your arguments act accordingly. 
---
Here's what I'd do:
---
- Introduce player "FOBs". These are cheaper versions of the existing upwell structures, but provide no asset safety. Have tether, but no docking for supers. Primary uses: manufacturing and moon mining in hostile/empire/wh space, providing a beachhead for invading hostile territory. Two timers fuelled, one unfulled. Replacement for POSes.
---
- Replace the existing upwell structures in hostile/empire/wh space with faction FOBs. When unanchored, they reprocess for the raw materials required to build the structure they replaced.
---
- Astrahus/Fortizar/Keepstar become the new territorial claim units. They claim sov and provide asset safety for people living in sovnull.
---
- Supers and titans can dock in keepstars but they get destroyed together with the structure when it goes down.
---
- Make it possible to structure-lock a system. Tie structure anchoring points to moons/planets again.
---

This is when the first person camera can be usefull. Undock in that mode, if your bookmarks is within the center circle you are good to instawarp to it, if not, dock back and undock again to see if you have a better angle.
---
Yes, there is a difference between small structures and L/XL structures. I would be fine if the "old" risks &amp; benefits of POS were applied to small (Astra/Rait/Atha), and L/XL would behave like Outposts. It's finally the small structures that get spammed in thousands as they are so cheap and demand no uphold at all.
---
For L/XL the prices are a good barrier still atm.
---
TBH no finished idea or concept for that.
---

&gt; So, by all means, the rorqual change had NOTHING to do with a decline of players (as it happened late 2016 and actually increased the numbers back up to 34k for the year),

Nobody really hates miners, they hate game mechanics that overly protect miners. IE chain panic'ing to protect the 50 multibox likely ISbox using covetors operating in 3 systems simultaneously in delve 23/7 (150) clients literally breaking the game. Even goons should be against this as it devalues the ore of everyone else and increases plex prices. 
---
Yes you can, and it's pretty easy to do once you set it up. It's easier if you store state somewhere, like a sqlite DB. The flow works like this: using either an auth token (first time) or a refresh token  (subsequent times) get a current access token (good for ..uh, 15 minutes? 20?). Store all of this info somewhere, then use it to make your request.
---
I have some pretty hacky but straightforward code that I've  used for lots of projects similar to what you're doing. It's not the best code by any means, but it should do what you need. I've prepended "!!" to things you'd need to set for yourself. The way to use this is to head to developers.eveonline.com, and register an app, pick your scopes and so on. Then fill in the url in the comment at the top with the client ID and the scopes you want (separated by %20). Go to that in your browser of choice, do the login dance, and then copy down the auth code it gives you. Now you need to make your sqlite3 db. It just needs one table, so go to wherever you're executing this, and (after having installed sqlite3 if you haven't yet) type "sqlite3 auth.sqlite3" into your terminal. Then paste in this:
---
    CREATE TABLE 'auth' (
---
    'id' INTEGER NOT NULL  PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES 'entities' ('id'),
---
    'access_token' TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
---
    'refresh_token' TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
---
    'expry' TEXT DEFAULT NULL
---
    );
---
Now, you're ready to run this code. Throw this into auth.py (or at the top of whatever code you've already written) and edit everywhere you see "!!" with your client auth, secret, etc. Then you can run this, enter in the auth code you saved from earlier, and it will output a refresh and access token, as well as storing them in the DB. You can then either paste the access token into whatever you already have, or access it via the DB directly.

Now that you have your access token, you can use it in a request, eg: 
---
    def fetch_standings(access_token, alliance_id):
---
        headers = {
---
                   "accept": "application/json",
---
                   "authorization": "Bearer {0}".format(access_token),
---
                  }
---
        url = "https://esi.evetech.net/latest/alliances/{0}/contacts/?datasource=tranquility".format(alliance_id)
---
        r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
---
        standings = r.json()
---
        return standings
---

I can make about 140mil isk per hour in a rorq, I have 36 rorq pilots. As for total isk, I have no clue. I invest most of it in the skill injector market. Its got a fantastic rate of return with all this Test vs Horde and botting stuff.

Look into npc null. 
---
CCP Could make it something you can buy from the Quafe LP store for only ISK.
---
That way it would be an 100% ISK Faucet item.
---
The prevailing delusion here is that mining is some sort of disease that infects upstanding PVPers, causing a degenerative effect in both their skill at Eve Online: A Space-Themed Spreadsheet and their moral fiber. 
---
It's a holdover from a time long ago, when players needed to be herded into training combat skills. The thing is that the skills you need to pilot mining barges and exhumers are a black hole. They have no applicability towards any other role in Eve Online. Thus, new players were discouraged from mining, and pushed towards ratting instead. Ratting skills are, coincidentally, also PVP skills. Plus, ratting was just objectively better for making money than mining. Mining anomalies had a shitty mineral basket, rogue drones dropped drone poo for minerals, and reprocessing gave back 100% of the materials used for production so at-will mineral compression was a thing. All three of those were eventually removed/changed. Plus, the primary horizontally scalable (read: AFK) active PVE method, gecko medium shield booster chimeras, was castrated with the capital changes in the Citadel patch. After that, mining was the next best AFK active PVE method. CCP revamping rorquals later to be crok-sucking monsters added fuel to the fire.

All alliances i know have builders who fill up contracts in attritional systems, you can try to get into these groups, play with them or underbid them. It might take a while to get rid of your stuff but its also viable. 
---
Anyway there is a chance that you wont get rid of your stash due to doctrine or staging changes.
---
Trouble reading? The skins were literally already made. No extra funds were diverted to create these if that's what you're thinking.

I played eve for years. When I started out I had dreams of being a pirate, 1v1 pvp style.
---
Instead I took a path which I expect is common:
---
1. Spend lots of time mining
---
2. Join a corp
---
3. Mine more while training for doctrine ships.
---
4. Go out in fleets with the corp, looking for and occasionally finding fleet fights.
---
5. Meta changes, doctrine is updated, return to step 3.
---
I want to give eve another go, but only if I have a plan for how to find people to fight 1v1. 
---
How do I do that? I never found myself face to face with another pilot who I could fight, in around 4 years of playing eve. 
---
I just want to solo PVP! Help me /r/eve!
---
Tfw you jump throught a wormhole, collapse it, then land on a gate.
---
Because it used to be a GM's / ISD's help only channel. Also non-rookies tend to spam the chat with scams, offers, memes which is also not allowed in there. So they locked it to 30 day characters and officials.     
---
Thats how it was at least 13 years long
---
Gameplay is unballanced in many directions and solo is dead, pay2win is existing and goons have won. Abyssal was a good try but is shit and the only reason to begin nowdays is if you have to much time... 
---
Poor Bowhead. Everyone forgets it's an ORE ship.
---
Shut up nerd, people in this game use *Exotic Dancers, Male* as a sign of appreciation, what else do you want
---
probably put in a goon doctrine. 
---
Seriously, this hits normal players way harder than botters. Normal players usually lack the necessary amount of autism to set up training queues every 24 hours across 100 accounts. A bot will do it without complaining forever. No way injecting is a common strategy for them.
---
3? Are alts even allowed? And are alts really that important? I have seen most of veterans talking about multiacc, but i cn't see the (apparently obvious) advantages apart from having one guy in nullsec with low rating and other with good rating hauling stuff from tradehubs. Or perhaps, quicker training and you can specialize each characters skills (one for sites, one PvP, one mining,...)?
---
  Don't do this, just pay for the game for the moment if you want Omega benefits.  IRL a month sub costs about 1-2 hours wages depending on your profession.  In Highsec as a new character it can take you 20-30 hours to make enough ISK for 1 month's sub.  This will burn you out fast.  Forget about 'playing for free' until much later in the game when you have tons of disposable ISK and generating enough for a sub is barely noticeable.
---
  That's if you have a choice of course.  If you don't have the money I would consider just staying Alpha for much longer.  There is a lot an Alpha can do, all the way up to battleships, and they accepted into most Nullsec fleets if you want to go that way. (ps, join Karmafleet)

REEEEEEEEEEEpost
---
Most underrated comment ever
---
It's aweful because its boring. I think it's the number 1 reason new players quit within their first month or so. 
---
but i though rorqs are unkillable?
---
This week I took a fat loss and lost a providence to code. I was a bit upset but a couple of Corp mates pitched in and helped me get a new providence. Code you bastards, you‚Äôre a necessary evil in high sec, keep those Care Bears on their toes.
---
Like this - we need it. 
---
you can buy ships in delve cheaper than it costs for you to even mine and build it yourself
---
My phone net is bad reeeeeee
---
They do give an example in the form of a curl command. But no their purpose is not to teach you simple programming. The assumption is you already know these things.
---
people undock because they want to add somethink on their killboard 
---
You now have the bug.... 
---
I fully support Snuff dropping on this
---
So this is not the answer you want but the answer that is going to possible be the most informative.
---
The question you are asking is borderline impossible to do. In order to answer it you need a dedicated survey. Said survey is something that anyone in leadership would be vary of releasing to reddit.
---
The only partial answer i know of in existence is that 2 years back goons did a Christmas survey for ho wealthy they were for christmas gifts.
---
If you can find it or anyone else can find it that is a weak answer but better than most you will find.
---
The other night I bought a piece of Steve for 20m.
---
In Pandemic Horde, no. Their nullsec economy is a smoking ruin of radioactive waste and sour milk.
---
Pls no we just want to shoot at space pixels :(
---
7 bill liquid, 10 bill muninn[s by the way], and another 15-20 in other assets 
---
I am a director of a corp in null. Average in liquid is about 7-8b and average in assets is about 30-40b. We have members owning a VNI and others up to 2 titans. Most of my guys plexes their accounts since they are mostly from South America. 
---
There's medicine for that, saw it in an ad somewhere. 
---
ISK Sink\* you mean.
---
High sec moon mining for 4 months now. 
---
Almost 5bil in wallet and around 19bil in assets. 
---
Though across 3 toons
---
wealth, for me around 48b in wealth(implants, ships, isk, etc)
---
and around 3-5b in liquid isk
---
Aye aye. The true Dino Alliance.
---
Space war. Space war never changes.
---
Use the same fit for both. You need a cheap CPU implant if you don't have mining upgrades V.  
---
All you want IMO is max Yield and then resists, if you're using a Hulk you should be sitting on a Rorqual who can provide remote reps/links and compression. If you're not sitting on a Rorq or at least an Orca in highsec, use a Covetor instead.   
---
You can ditch the T2 Explosive rig for a Mercoxit rig if you're mining Merc

---
In theory, yes, this will be profitable, but there is always war, which could destroy or increase profit, peace, which can fo the same, doctrine changes, all that good stuff
---
Well I mean what endgame activity in this game is not easily achievable using injectors?
---
it would suck, the whole point of high dps or numerical superiority would become pointless and instead be who has more spare time.
---
then again with CCP's focus on citadels, its probably only a matter of time...
---
Woops yes you're correct. Fixed, cheers.

Have you realize MMORPG is a dying type of game ? Quit complaining, every MMORPG are dying, even computer game are dying, we lost 10 k average in 5 year ? Woooooaw, check WoW number, it's in million.
---
It is boring to some people. It is not boring for some other people. Also I doubt that mining is the reason people quit. Need sources for this.
---
Join a corp that lives in lowsec or NPC 0.0. Yes the isk making won't be as good but it puts you in a position where you won't be surrounded by a sea of blue. Then just grab a ship you want to fly and go look for a fight. I admit 1v1 is pretty rare to find in anything but frigates. However after awhile you will learn how to fight 1v2, 1v3, etc or you can form small gangs with your corp.

Goonswarm botting/moon Empire needed space, Red Alliance was not doing enough botting so we had to remove them.

You already took him everything else! But hey, I'm a newbie, maybe there is plenty of reason to do so that I don't know about
---
Cyno alt, high sec trade alt, web alts,  jf alts, spy alts, rorq alts, industry alts, the list goes on and on. Alts are extremely useful and the key to benefiting from economies of scale in regards to industrial capacity. Why have 10 industry jobs running when you can have 30 or 40? Why haul all that shit in one freighter doing a bunch of trips when you can move it all in one fell swoop with 3 freighter. Eve is one game where alts drastically improve isk /h. 
---
Mining is boring for everyone who does it.
---
you see "to bore" means to drill a hole into something and furthermore,
---
I multibox, sometimes I'll be in a small gang while I have another account doing VNI anom ratting, other times I might have 1 guy in a dps ship and another guy in a support or tackle ship, or a logi and easy to afk fleet dps BS, I currently don't do much with 3 at the same time yet, but it also allows me to have a few different guys in different specialities (1 account with logi / explo skills, another with my BS pilot and vni ratting alt and then my main subcap pilot that pretty just flies missiles and dictors at this point)

Yes, welcome to the second one of these! Once again we'll be flying around black rise kicking ass and trying not to feed too hard. Ships will be arranged at the location but if you wanna fly something shiny that's fine too.

---
Well sure; however, there is a fine line between innovative and smart uses of game mechanics that players discover and the developers never envisioned, and bugs that unintentionally break a game. Like dupes; or if it turns out in the case of a Titan hull:
---
1. the wrong bonus was actually attached to a shield tank hull, and the hull is actually getting 5000% bonus to armor repping; 
---
2. It turns out that the game is reading a certain type of smart bomb affixed to a certain hull as a doomsday, resulting in AOE doomsday damage on the same cooldown as a smart bomb;
---
3. Etc.
---
So just to be sure this is a mock up and you're not able to actually separate those windows right?
---
Flying an instawarp sunesis from Jita to Pandemic Horde‚Äôs staging is fairly safe, and it can hold almost 1500 m3 with t1 rigs. I imagine it‚Äôs the same for KarmaFleet and Brave. 
---
If you made one alt for each Corp (you‚Äôd have to lie on your application to KarmaFleet, and maybe Brave. You‚Äôd also have to go on stratops with them every so often. Horde wouldn‚Äôt really care), you could run around shipping stuff into all three markets. However, managing that many orders across that many accounts would be time consuming, so probably don‚Äôt do that until you‚Äôve started seeding one market and confirm that you like it. 
---
https://www.eve-scout.com/thera/ is constantly updated, and routing through Thera is often a quicker route to market than trying to scan down a chain in the hopes it'll pop out where you need it. 
---
I've been using the beta launcher for about a month and I really love it.  The login groups are really nice.  It's so much smoother than the regular launcher
---
I completely agree with most of the posts about rorqs killing the economy. But not one person stood up and explained why folks still hate hs mining. If someone wants to do that, why the hatred? 
---
answer is ‚Äúyour not playing eve right!‚Äù
---
I'm at least lvl 4 in every supcab ship and system, I only fly destroyers and the occasional sb
---
I really have no choice. I was homeless for several years (still am by some definitions) and still have no income whatsoever. My objective is to build my isk producing capacity and skills. So even a single month of Omega will give me the capacity to bank some Omega skills even if I can't maintain it full time. Which, I assume, will make them immediately available when I can reup Omega. From what I understand it'll also give me much faster skill training for periods I can keep Omega. When I say long grind to get to Omega there's lots and lots of mini grinds in between. Part of which is sectionalizing the learning curve itself into smaller bits and making sure my Alpha skills are in good shape before then, and planning for making the most of whatever Omega time I can get. 
---
And we still can‚Äôt have the easiest thing in the world: custom labels/notes for the accounts. Sigh. Because fgknbv37853df is what you need to see when you want to log in your super or your jita alt. I guess we‚Äôll just do groups of one account now at least.
---
I'm the same way. I've got black ops boats and high grade clones all over the place but not a fucking dime in my wallet
---
I fly cruises and battlecruisers and very occasionaly when i have the money i fly a rokh battleship.  I fly only caldari ships

( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Ive been playing for about 7 months now, I rarely sit above 1b for long, though I did plex an account for 2 months I think,  I have probably 3b in assets in pvp ships, I mostly fly sabres which are 100m a pop, and then have a nightmare, 2 Basi, a Scimi, a bunch of jackdaws and a blingy long point, with an additional 300m in assets I'm hoping to turn a profit on
---
I'm going to have to redo all my logins again aren't I.
---
POV pilot here - yeah i was a bit all over the place last night. Wasn't my BNI - just undocked and tried to finish my dinner before the fight started :)
---
Read the blog?
---
i was dumb and lost a battle cruiser running combat sites in lowsec. it was a moment of not paying attention to local. the pirates were pirates, and eventually warped in too many friends to tank. they did a good job being pirates, and while i was upset at the loss, and placed a 20,000,000 isk bounty on the corp, they did what makes the game fun for them.
---
i am glad they were having fun. everyone should be able to find something fun and do it! 
---
Medicine for what? Wormholes? 
---
someone is buying out the stocks and relisting, you can see two spikes on volume where this occurred recently on the chart you posted.  And because it doesn't enter the game from anywhere, its price really only goes up.
---
You can see the price dip a little after the buyout, but these are people that were holding that list their stock taking advantage of the buyout spike.
---
&gt; having a stockpile of t1 cruisers or battlecruisers to hand out to potential allies
---
Damn good idea.  Much appreciated.
---
More than they'll ever need
---
Wait...is he not supposed to be? 
---
man i dont even know anymore.
---
95's are great if you are hitting the caves. I used to go mostly in Lil River, Ginnie, Peacock, and Telford. Was many years ago before they poured all the concrete at Lil River and shut Telford down. Did some in Cow and Royal, mostly just OW/overhead, but that was when you could just drive back in the woods to Cow without any issue. One time went back in there and some locals were bathing in it, kid you not. 
---
According to https://zkillboard.com/alliance/1220922756/ Red Alliance is still happily krabbing away in Period Basis depite having given all the sov away. If they are going somewhere, it's not quite happening yet, apparently
---
But yeah, I'm also interested in knowing where they are going. They were actually growing a little bit the last few months, gave some decent fights a few times when our guys went there.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing Faction Warfare solo until you have t2 guns and the appropriate frigate skill to IV. 
---
That‚Äôs not to say don‚Äôt do it, just try to find a friend, and work together. You‚Äôll do much better, have more fun, and learn more than if you tried to go solo like some people here recommend 
---
Please no. The idea is really good but I'm afraid of what will happen if CCP wants to implement it.
---
I don't see a way to do this other than stretching eve (windowed mode) so it covers both monitors, and having all ui/chats/fleet etc  on one monitor while only showing the ship on the other, kinda like this: [https://imgur.com/a/8IAjGjZ](https://imgur.com/a/8IAjGjZ)
---
Don't think there is any way of doing what you described though
---
also Ra CEO got put in dumpster by CCP on at least 3 characters
---
But what if you have nothing to migrate?
---
 I'm sorry but the way it's worded makes it seem like "oh, well if that happens that's just because our server is whack and you were probably due for the launcher to forget your details regardless of if we were updating the launcher"
---
Feels like a cop out I guess... 
---
found the average line member
---
I was hoping this was an update to 64 bit launcher :(
---
Threat Level: Midnight
---
bring it on!
---
If you have nothing to migrate, then nothing will be migrated.
---
If you have accounts that you've set to remember, then they should be migrated over.
---
It's not really that difficult to understand.
---
The vaccine is strong with this one
---
Soon (without the TM)
---
Yes
---
An update or the launcher?
---
the more apt guys average at 50-100bil net after 1-2 years. the other one never manage to make any serious isk. 
---
At this point, I imagine the triggering it causes is the number one use for that name...
---
You mean world war bee ?
---
Is there plans to maintain 32 bit compatibility / version with the launcher. This particularly affects Linux users. 
---
"Do I have to relog all my accounts?
---
No!
---
When we update the Release branch of the launcher with the new code, we will migrate all accounts you have pinned over to the new launcher. If they are not pinned, we have nothing to migrate for you and you must log in anyway."
---
I will personally offer the launcher developer a beer at Eve North if none of my 50 accts are lost with the transition to the new launcher.

Welcome back to r/eve

I can only get so hyped

Money for Plex for ISK? Or how did you finance shit when you first started out?

Dude, I've played this game since 2005, don't tell me everything is going to go smoothly because a blog says so.
---
F, could not be found

(‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø) rip all of your free time
---
What are you try to say....
---
Average linemember here, 9 months into game, about 40b in assets over 4 accounts or 6 characters, liquid isk hovers around 1b.
---
that's the point and the issue, until injectors it took a good long while to get into that point, and now they have N+1 methodology going on as with more they can get more. Overall since injectors have been added to the game the amount of titans and supers have skyrocketed. super carriers used to cost some like 25. i just saw a fully fit one for 17 and one for 15. more going for the 18billion range. Carriers are in any decent group under a billion isk, which is cheaper than a marauder or some faction battleships
---
Titans are down as well, as low as 60bn I have seen full fit when they used to be 100+
---
the number of hulls in game are massive and the capitals are not dying because there are so many they simply can't be, or won't. rorqual mining makes sense, the absolute invulnerability does not. because if that tech exists, why in the FUCK would it not be put onto said supers and titans? if that tech went it would allow more to die off, if injectors were not made it would have allowed the game to progress naturally. That said I feel like injectors MAY have been viable if they blocked them at a certain SP range, or kept it from injecting certain skills per say.

Found the hardcore Krab

Maybe you should have named your super account something else than fgknbv37853df ?

I've no idea how much I have and I'm too afraid to check.

Maybe i am a little naiive thinking not everyone is the piece of shit you claim to be.
---
Request:  For our launch groups, can we have a client placement pattern saved?  We already have profiles that remember the last window sized we used, could it be improved to remember the sizing and *placement* of each window in a launch group?  One of my monitors is a 4k and it'd be nice if the clients of a certain group would all size and place themselves according to how I like to arrange them for that group.  That would be amazing. 
---
i am defenetly not ok with that it would create a chain reaction wich would not only affect bs
---
for 1 navy hulls like vni would get much much more expensive since lvl4 would probably die due to the inability to profit with battleships 
---
and 2 it would exclude anyone that isnt in null making stupid ammounts of money from using battleships since the risk to loose is to high 
---
&gt;most likely
---
not really
---
a large part of the eve playerbase is from places whithout a currency as valued as the euro and the dollar, once you factor in the exchange to other coins things get far more complicated. And that's before factoring in availability of money transfers and credit cards, not every place has the ubiquitous use of electronic payment of the US and europe.

naw the bot never left he ben boting for 10 years....

Maybe I'm just cynical, but it looks like it was redesigned to allow more room for CCP ads. Instead of having one on the side, now there's 3.
---
Sure heaps of people do similar stuff
---
Or did it just get easier because you've been playing for longer? I only ask because as a person who has played for the last 9 months this game is hard as fuuuuuck. I still feel new
---
You can jump on to the beta, and give the migration a shot.
---
If you return to the release version for whatever reason, you may want to trigger migration again from the launcher settings (cog bottom left) =&gt; Reset Options &amp; Cache =&gt; Data Migration once the update hits release.
---
I always preferred to get wrecked in a venture, as I figured it only took about 2 mining trips to pay for itself. I bought about 30 of them, and after a short bit of mining to recoup their cost would go exploring in low/null until I was destroyed. Some of the most fun I had in eve.
---
Thanks for reply. This kinda diminishes my incentive, but ok, I will deal with it multiaccounting when and if I get there, so far one guy is more than enough. The most work I have in last few days is absorbing information and while I am not quite bad at it, the stream fo "good to know" things in this game is seemingly endless. :D
---
I'm talking about rags that have armor rigs and only put on their extra shield tank when its going to be a DD exchange. In a DD exchange even some avatars slap on a shield tank. 
---
Why so? I never really knew of what a wormhole system is, Can you help explain it or how i'd get there?
---
I mean, notes would be nice.

But it's not like you can't put a sticky at your desk:

‚Ä¢ LORDPeasant = ABC

‚Ä¢ Twatwaffle212 = MnO

so on and so forth.

Literally requires minimal effort

Having played WOW, Eve and a bunch of others I can say they do 'mellow out' as time goes on.

Are you projecting/estimating the 64 bit client create more stability for accounts to not be knocked offline? Both in TIDI and non TIDI situations?
---
Given how far GigX went, I'd be totally cool with a 1 or 2 year ban. A lifetime seems too long for throwing out some threats on the internet. (Again, those threats are significant and shouldn't go unpunished, but a lifetime ban feels too long).     
---
That said, the fact that GigX continually evaded the ban makes me a little uncomfortable.  
---
I see, thank you for answering. The advantages are obvious when you put it out like this, I was just not yet aware, that it is officially allowed. The amount of stuff to learn here is staggering. But i love learning useless knowledge and skills, so I feel right at home. :)
---
How are you doing this?
---
By going to the beta, if the migration fails for whatever reason, wouldn't I lose the logins by reverting back?
---
The safer option would probably be to wait for the live version so worst case I would only get burned once.
---
@Smultar - if you could correct the text to "Outer Ring Excavations", that'd be lovely! :-) 
---
If you don‚Äôt tell the launcher to remember your accounts, it won‚Äôt remember your accounts. How exactly is that a cop out?
---
Don't worry then goons enmasse would be W O K E and bitch CCP about "fixing" the game.
---
How you do this voodoo?
---
war never decreases profits
---
Why would they do this? They literally created small injectors specifically for Alpha's. This is yet another fine example of how out of touch most of these suggestions are nowadays. Y'all got no idea what you're talking about.
---
Smartbomb rat to make 300 mill an hour. I try to sit around a 3 Bill safety net and just spend the money as I get it on ships and skill injectors. 
---
Mind telling which alliance you are in and how many members your corp has? 
---
This, but main method is to deliver the items using a random citadel your main is docked at. I found deliveries was preferable to having to run a second account to trade direction or leaving a paper trail with contracts.
---
Yup, it's that simple, assuming you have the capital to buy out the entire market in one swipe, and you can afford to potentially lose a bunch of money if someone beats you to the punch. 
---
WH systems don't have stargate, meaning yo only go in and out with WH, who despawn after some times or some mass went through. Each system has static or 2, meaning that it will always get WH directing toward a certain type systems (for example, my alliance live in a C2 WH with a C5 and and NS static, meaning that if we want we can collapse our NS static WH by sending through very heavy ships, and get a new NS WH. That's a very dynamic way of playing Eve, since unlike LS or NS or HS, if your nearby content is dry, you can just roll your holes and get new ones. Of course living in WH require some logistics, some scanning to do on a regular basis and the risking all your stuff since it loots from structure when they die rather than go into asset safety.
---
The migration process does not modify or delete the user data of the old UI. But I can understand if you prefer caution in this scenario. :)
---
There is a lot to take in, man. Take your time with it and find things you enjoy doing. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise and welcome to the best damn game there is! When you are ready for alts, you'll know.
---
AMARR VICTOR!!!
---
I wrote "most likely" because he was talking about "‚Ç¨" and his username ends with "GER", so I strongly assume that he's from germany.  
---
I know there are countries where such things are more of a problem. 
---
Depends on what you're looking to get out of it.
---
The distinctive thing about EVE is that it's so deep and wide that there are countless occupations, countless niches, countless little rackets and ways to earn money and pass the time. That's where the learning curve pays off. Don't be intimidated by it; there's always ways to just grab another ship and move on.
---
or because that is the 1 thing the launcher has failed at repeatedly over many iterations and updates 
---
You would be correct sir or ma'am.

You certainly can get involved. The way it's designed means it will take a few weeks and you can specialise into a ship that is useful/fun. 
---
Upsides: It's visually up to date, good community (generally), still the best virtual economy around
---
Downsides: Many peeps say it's had it's best years and I feel general population is slowly dropping.

Eve "learning curve" has more to do with the amount of information you will have to absorb. Now those things you have to learn aren't complicated, but there is a lot of them. Eve being a sandbox, learning and discovering all those things are part of what makes the game interesting. I'm 2 years into the game and I'm still learning things.
---
Is it worth it ? If you can find your kick, yes. Eve offer a lot of possibilities, from large alliance warfare, complex industrial chains of production, ruthless small group PvP, and social interaction are a big part of it too (hence why there is so much shit posting here), because learning and accomplishing things with others is a lot easier.
---
Good question, but what do you consider "average Frontline member"? 
---
I think the average will be impacted by how long they've been playing, and with how many accounts. 
---
If I had to guess, if say about 1-3 bil for a hi sec player, about the same for low sec, and 45-60 bil for a null sec player.
---
I've seen people laugh at others using "casino war"... do people actually get triggered by that?
---
Looks like fun, thanks for posting
---
What if I have have only 1"40 monitor?
---
Currently I play with 2 clients running, windowed and the "rear" client shows my OV of the rear client so I can see when bads pop on OV and I can quickly switch between the two.
---
My desk can't accommodate a second monitor tbh.
---
That is absolutely barbaric .I have a spreadsheet. 
---
Only if you can win the numbers game. Mining doesn't favor the small corps.
---
They are already, looking at all the goon vote brigading in the threads pointing out this special fact of economic unhealthyness in the relation between plexed accounts/ people buying plex with cash/ hours to mine to earn a plex sub. Nonsense koolaid bs getting upvoted, proven facts and economic evaluations are downvoted. Most of these scrubs do not even realize that economic laws apply fully to EVE markets as EVE is in fact a full scale study on a fully unregulated market economy, and professional economists have written essays about ...
---
There are third party wormhole mapping programs that help tracking signatures and connections.
---
Personally I joined and did a bunch of starter missions for about a week in high sec. then I joined a big null sec bloc that was good for new players. That group taught me how fun eve can be and I definitely recommend checking them out. Play this game at least once. You‚Äôll either hate it, or love it. Whichever it is it‚Äôs worth finding out, you‚Äôre never gonna find another game anything like this.
---
I've made some great irl friends in Eve. Pew pew is fun but the social aspect is what keeps me playing. Find people you like to play with and enjoy it. Don't sweat the small stuff or the learning curve. 
---
i mean, what are the odds they do something horrible, its not like eve has ever deleted system files
---
Hahaha same, i extracted a toon last month, made 22b. Not much left......But i have a damn nice hangar atm :)
---
You can buy token to get your security status up.
---
If you only have one monitor, then you will need one additional monitor to be able to span the client over 2 screens.
---
Ey bud feel free to message me if you wanna duel or roam together.
---
What do u wanna do? Mission, mine, run sites, trade, etc? 
---
*areas with a popular trade hub (jita, followed by amar) usually have more competitive prices but there are more people around the local systems competing for sites, ice, ore, gate camping etc.

Ratting and sites
---
If someone goes suspect repairing a war target in highsec and then you aggress the suspect character. Does another character repairing the person attacking the person who is suspect also gain suspect?
---
For example person A is a war target. Person B is a neutral that reps war target A. Person C who is neutral to both attacks the now suspect person B. Person D goes to rep person C who is attacking the neutral but suspect person B. Does person D gain suspect status?
---
i dont think it's getting triggered as much as just finding it funny that mittens + pets are genuinely still trying to force it
---
Wow definitely. I remember the day LFG came out.. it was like my second 9/11.
---
There are so many stations / system in high sec it would be nearly impossible to give you just one.  It really depends on what you want to DO there.  
---
If you want to run missions, you need to find a station that has the agents for the corp you want to run missions for, and the right level of agents.  If you want to mine, you probably want to be in more out-of-the-way systems to have more available ore and fewer gankers.
---
I can tell you that the primary trading hubs are Jita / Perimeter (Market hub for Caldari, best market in game, but camped like no other), Amarr (Market Hub for Amarr, probably second best market), Dodixie, (market hub for Gallente), Hek, and Rens (Market hubs for Minmatar).
---
Best idea is to find a player corp you want to to join, and move to where ever they operate.
---
I need this more than I need food, water and sunshine.
---
I'm like 1.3B isk and about 20B in assets.  Combination of ratting and exploration.
---
No its not worth it 
---
That's the story of Eve, except you shouldn't have go for mining since it takes some SP you could have put into combat skills.
---
Short story, get a T1 frigate train for racial V, T2 guns, lvl4 on all support skills you can, and go out in FW novice complexes. And slowly but surely train for more shit. If you need isk, run missions or join FW to get LP from the complexes (which should be more than enough to finance T1 hulls)

[NER](https://newedenreport.com/2019/01/30/the-1900-news-on-wednesday-30th-january/) has this to say:
---
&gt; Red Alliance Set to Leave Period Basis:
---
&gt;One of the least reported stories right now is mass transfer of sov in Period Basis from Red Alliance to Goonswarm Federation. It is understood by NER that Red Alliance wanted to move out of the region and sold it off to goons. They are anticipated to be moving into the region of¬†Curse.
---
And Mittani confirmed the selling of the region part on The Meta Show.
---
Bold words Mr. Falcon, bold words.

---
so you're becoming a full time eve player? that's pretty nice friend.

I just returned. Did they change BLOPS? I thought they all retained some of their factional ewar capabilities. Only one seems to be the widows ECM

that's is nice man, hope it does you good ^-^
---
I don't get it. The proper name IS Casino War.
---
But he said yes to belly rubs and some lunch money from Aryth ...
---
Yes, that will work if you are careful in managing costs for hauling.
---
Couple suggestions:
---
1. Start with BPCs first to get the hang of it and see if it's for you - BPOs take a very long time to pay back
---
1. Talk with other alliance industry builders and get their input
---
1. Fill a hole - be careful of overbuilding in one specific thing that the importers can easily undercut - modules are risky because an importer can bring in 200 of something and undercut the 20 you lovingly built - small ships (frigate/ceptor) sell quickly and are harder to import.
---
oh its only a concept, yea exactly what i was thinking.
---
So many people think a second monitor is as easy as a second, third, fourth eve account.
---
Ideally I would have every window in the back of my client with exception of the OV and ship modules.  Screen would look sexy w/o all the other windows.
---
Then if I had a second monitor Id throw all the chatable and dscan/probe windows on it
---
There are quite a few on the third party development portal.
---
I'd start with this one:
---
* [updated-esi-quick-reference-for-new-developers](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/updated-esi-quick-reference-for-new-developers)
---
It covers a bunch of the FAQ stuff for ESI.

The code snippets on the older blogs will refer to the old URL, if you're going to copy-paste them remember to update them to use the new URL.
---
**Ultimately though**, you don't need to read any of this stuff to get started. ESI is a standard REST API. There's a lot of technical stuff in those blogs to help you get maximum power out of ESI, but to get started with it any python REST API tutorial will give you the basics.

Liquid about 3bil, assets 50+ bil not sure though.

no joke TF2 has a text mode client.

its because we warped into the brutixes after originally trying to kite them, I took over from the FC as the backup and forgot to switch to fury before going in close on them, if we had we would have killed at least one of the BNIs but yeah the Basi reps were too much, shoulda pulled out earlier.

Been playing for 6+ months now, mostly wallet-tanked. I bought a couple galaxy-packs and I've probably got 10 billion across multiple accounts. 
---
I guess since Chutlanin got banned for RMT. Goonies took the region back to avoid troubles with the SOV ?
---
Can you imagine docking in a station, getting out of your ship - then somehow ending up in a fun battle inside the station?   Oh man..
---
Yeah that is probably true. Although one very tangiable difference is citadels, where once you could have had fights on outposts you only have citadels now which by their nature discourage fighting for smaller groups. This is the same for mining, where once people would be in anomalies in exhumers/orcas and would need subs of your own to break tackle. Now we have rorquals that tank 60k+ dps and athanors/tartaras that just jam/nullify tackle.
---
Threads like this popping up every now and then says yes.

If u give it a go, after you've grasped the basics of how to get around, find some space friends to help you work through learning the details and where to invest your time. It's can be a cruel world on your own,  like the real one!

well, bet the lunch money from daddy was enough to create &amp; inject new accounts ... but whoever outside the goon koolaid world realizes that it is him will scream "eeewwwww" loudly like he touched a pile of dogshit ...
---
Faction warfare space\*, either sit in a plex in a combat ship checking d-scan to see what's on it's way into you and decide if the fight is fair. Or roam around d-scanning plexes looking for people sitting in plexes and decide if it's a fair fight and warp in on them. 
---
Notes:
---
1. It might look like a fair fight but actually be bait for a gang. 
---
2. Even in an evenly matched fair fight there might be nothing (or little) you could have done. The game tends to be rock/paper/scissors and if you have scissors and the other guy has a rock you're going to lose 90% of the time.
---
3. You can as you get better at the game beat those odds: Scissors can beat rock if he knows it's a rock and has a plan that mitigates the disadvantage he's at.
---
4. Don't count "the fight" as only starting the moment the shooting starts and worrying about whether it's fair or unfair. Think about the fight as starting with the choices you make leading up to the shooting.
---
\* A few months ago I would have suggested Black Rise as the perfect place to consistently and easily find solo PvP. Sadly it's fallen off a cliff in the past several months as both Gallente, Caldari and the smaller pirate alliances have abandoned the war zone.
---
tbh thats probably the reaction most goons would have to him as well.  
---
Neocom says I have ~50 bil in assets across 2 accounts. For one it‚Äôs mostly in BPOs and for the other it‚Äôs mostly in ships (specifically my abyssal runner). Only about 3 bil is liquid.
---
For context I‚Äôve been playing for just under 2 years with most of that in null, but splitting time between PvP and PvE.

If the activity you are doing is not exciting enough to keep you at the keyboard and paying attention, then you should find a better activity. AFK miners hurt everybody. From the newbie who jumps into system and can't find anybody to talk to, to the hunter who secures the kill and misses out on the tears. They are indistinguishable from bots.

I guess I don't understand. If you only have 1 monitor, what is there to gain from being able to separate the windows?

For what it's worth, I used to play a game that let you drag its windows outside of the main game window. It was absolutely terrible.
---
I was an mmo player for over a decade, since I was 18. I've competitively played wow, league of legends, and cod extensively. I started eve last year.

are you ready to lose everything you carrying when you die?

the game is far easier to get into nowdays, but it will still require dedicaiton to learning beyond what other games ask.
---
we have Help channels, E-UNI channels, and recruitment channels that provide as much help as they can. and will gladly answer any question yuo come up with.  but even then it will be up to you to descide what you want to do.   there is no story to follow to find more stuff to do.   you are quite literally thrown in the middle of a world with no arrows(after the tutorial) to tell you "go this way"    you have to pick your path.
---
the fact your on reddit asking is a plus, as it means you have knowledge of one of the 3rd party resources to find out whats going on, and ask for advice.
---
personally, it took me 3 tries to get into EVE. spread out over 4 years.  and that 3rd time kept me here for going on 7 years.
---
EVE is liek a drug,  you touch it....you remember it.  and on occasion you might try it again.
---
but once you get addicted.  your stuck in it.   EVE players joke that the only way to "win eve" is to leave for a reason. its the only cure to an addiction.
---
but what an addiciton it is.  no other game will offer you the personal impact on the game world that EVE lets you do.

wanna destroy the economy? EVE will let you if you got the resources.

Why? CCP literally tells you there's a sig in the system and its general location before you even drop a probe. THEN probes are easy as hell to place in proper patterns now.
---
What do you want, a warp to beacon for unknown space?
---
I'll try to tackle that question from different direction - since getting actual data would be near impossible, let's try to look at what we know most people have and how it's valued. All numbers I put below are rough estimates, and should be considered more as order of magnitude estimate than actual pricetags.
---
For most nullsec alliances ISK total to be able to afford one ship for every doctrine out there will average somewhere between 2-5bil for subcaps, every doctrine capital is around 2.5bil (more or less, carriers are cheaper, active FAX/dreads are more expensive). Most of that stuff is SRP'd by large groups, so having subs for every fleet and 2 capitals would put "combat ready asset freeze" in ballpark of 7-10bil ISK. For being able to repurchase whatever is lost on alliance ops, it wouldn't be uncommon to have around 5bil ready on wallet - that gets us to about 12-15bil.
---
Now almost everyone will need some way of making ISK. Let's assume that on average nullsecer will make around 100mil ISK/hour after taking into account all costs (I'm assuming here sub is always done by PLEX), and including all time spent for setup/preparation/forced wait etc. placing assets required to make said ISK (whether it's VNIs, ratting carrier, rorqual, DED running ship, burner ships/fits, industry materials/blueprints) averaging at around 3bil per activity. And assuming most people will have two unrelated ways of making ISK in case one can't be used at the time, that would mean additional 6bil in assets for making ISK. We're at about 20bil ISK now.
---
From there we go into wild guess area, because now it all depends on peoples willingness to make ISK, burn through ISK, build wealth, or just sustain their playstyle day to day. There are also various non-mandatory and unorganized activities people take a part in, and - depending on many cases - this will be where total net worth will vary the most for what one could consider an established player. I'm going to assume at this point average will be either having supercapital or things of comparable total value. Randomly checking zkillboard stats of several larger nullsec alliances suggests titan-to-super ratio around 1:2, with about 10% of active characters being super pilots. That, with average fully fit supercapital cost (including implants and refits) adds approximate 30bil to total net worth. For people without supers this value will instead be in roaming ships or other assets, and  - again - it's only rough estimate.
---
At this point we're at about 50bil ISK per member, which roughly fits what /u/eltipoduro17 mentioned for his corp. This doesn't take into account outliers: both players that aren't yet established, and 1%-ers with significantly bigger total wealth, I'm going to assume those two groups will average each other out (and part of those superrich can't really be considered "line members"). Estimates are based on: general knowledge of used fits/doctrines, history with seeding doctrine contracts and staging markets, tracking capital/supercapital deaths with cargo suggesting someone was moving all their belongings, hauling during alliance evacs, and a lot of just guessing what would feel right.
---
Looking at average doesn't really make that much sense, because - assuming one either can fly as alpha or pay for sub - anything above around 10-15bil ISK total net worth for nullsec members is mainly for convenience, personal spendings and vanity. Allocation of said ISK also plays big role, it's much easier to see 25bil ISK put into ratting super or rorquals than put into market buy orders, blueprints and materials or contract seeding; also freeing this money to put it somewhere else will take different amount of effort/time. 50bil doesn't work the same as another 50bil.
---
Good job, you linked:

- Xenuria post, he only does it to trigger people. At least, we hope. Either that or he is actually batshit crazy.

- Everything else is literally posted 2 years ago by non-goons. 
---

---
People like risk... for everyone else but themselves. 
---
They join a "blue space coalition" then say the game needs more risk
---
Has instant intel via local, but says the game needs more risk
---
Won't commit to fights unless they know its a win, then says the game need more risk
---
I been playing eve for years and I got to laugh a bit when I see these "Game is getting soft, needs more risk". In reality what people want is what PL had with Brave in catch, easy/fun fights where they win
---
yes, can be done:
---
1. windowed mode
---
2. streatch across both monitors
---
3. move controls/windows to one monitor
---
4. adjust cameracenter in setting to the empty monitor - so your ship is in the middle of second monitor
---
but your gameexperience would be shit as fuck, as you'll have to look differents monitors to actually do anything.

Firstly, this is going to vary from group to group. Supercapital-heavy groups and turbokrab groups will obviously be wealthier, and individual players/spaces of play will affect this heavily too. Obviously a level 4 mission ratter will have less isk and assets than a super pilot, who will in turn have less than the dudes running 500 char skill farms.
---
The average person I speak to in null about these things has 1-10b in liquid isk, and 5-50b in assets in my experience. Wealthier people will have more sp/time, poorer people will have less sp/time.
---
You're not wrong - the camera offset can be used to center the ship on the other screen - but there are two downsides to this. 
---
The first is that this will make the game tax the graphics card a lot harder because it's still rendering space behind everything. Obviously, the solution to this is just get a better card of course.
---
The second is not currently fixable however and is a problem if you try to stretch the game to 6400 by 1080 like I did a while back. as you stretch the game across multiple monitors the game begins zooming in.
---
 if you stretch it across 3 monitors at once the tactical overlay ends up getting cut off by the top of the screen.
---
this is because Eve's renderer is still after all these years tuned for a 4 by 3 aspect ratio. You can see this going into a station &amp; changing your screen resolution to 1024 by 768. You can see more of the station above and below your ship. 
---
TLDR: eves way of dealing with wide screen is to simply chop off the top and the bottom of the rendering area. the more you stretch it the more zoomed in and gets and eventually it can be nausea-inducing to even move the camera.
---
Is there actually a ‚ÄúRookie‚Äù chat?? 
---
&gt; I bet the worst part is that he know nobody will ever trust him with anything again 
---
nah, the worst part is that after burning all trust he'd ever get in the game in exchange for the reputation of being the 400iq masterming he still managed to get far outshined by gigX reaction, relegating his spot in the story to a swift mention. If only he hadn't been such a massive dickwad at least he'd get more recognition, serves him right tbh.
---
no that was The Great Nothern War ?
---
Love those skins!! Look great 
---
That's not possible at the moment for me, or many others that may be considered casual, I suspect.
---
The only option to achieve parity with the idea of expanding gfx real estate is to minimize all non used windows in the one client to expand the screen real estate with intent on experiencing more immersion of space gfx.  Somehow or someway this feels cumbersome to me.  However, I feel like you have no idea what I can be experiencing since you game on 4 monitors.  Yet still, I don't think a person with 4 monitors wouldn't find it beneficial to have all chat windows grouped on 1 of their monitors freeing up real estate on the other 3?
---
Alliance, corp, local, dscan, fleet window, fleetchat, probescan - the box just keeps getting wider taking up more gfx space. Watchlist. Add the overview now.  
---
I can minimize alliance &amp; corp and maximize when someone says check those particular channels but its cumbersome.
---
Ideally I would detach all those screens and throw 'em on a second monitor. Except D-scan, watchlist &amp; OV.  In my situation with 1 monitor I would move my mouse down and click to bring to top.  I would force certain windows to always be on top till closed, such as WL or Fleetchat etc.
---
I know there are workarounds and this is just an idea.  I don't think its a shit idea, either.  Just an idea.
---
What is there to be salty over? I just have no interest in their narrative.
---
For me, the problem is that none of my mates are willing to play it. So for years, I've had the balance of "play eve basically solo" vs "go down to game store and play MtG with mates".

My issue was getting fed up when I ended up in WH's which had built up an accumulation of sigs because no one was running anything, and the waste of time and effort it was, I got frustrated at the time spent and as a result I got fed up with it and decided to give up on Stain completely.

So does anyone here actually have only Traders/Miners on an account and not one characters of each on an account?
---
I see no use in having groups unless they link to characters not accounts
---
ex:
---
Account 1: Char1 - PvP,  Char2 - Industry,  Char3 - Miner
---
Account 2: Char1 - PvP,  Char2 - Industry,  Char3 - Miner
---
I pretty much do this already with one account stretched across three monitors.
---
The overview and local are on the right monitor.  Fleet broadcasts and chat are on the left monitor.  Center monitor is pretty clear.

Funny the conversation took this turn, for the multi account meta was the third thing I was going to list as putting me off.
---
Don't want to get a valuable ship snared? Then you have an alt for scouting. Then all the stuff listed by Waanii above. Some, if not many, players create alts and multibox as casually as getting a snack from the refrigerator.
---
When a game endorses alts, and when they become the standard for playing the game efficiently, as being a standard for the sensible way to do things, then my enthusiasm diminishes. But we shall see.
---
I'm not from the UK, but flying solo and in Eve irl (although a doctor told me I shall be more social \^\^). See ya on Evesterdam!

She actually haves a corpse bride - princess Leia hoodie (yes, nice crossover right?) a coin purse of cheewaca, star wars wallet and Keychain plus all the movies in blue ray.
---
Pd. She loves my lightsaber. 
---
Last night on eve: I found a small group to fight while flying solo, got a 1v3 and won. I lead a small fleet against a somewhat larger one and lost. Gained experience though. After that, did some 3 person instanced pve and got some nice loot.

Seems like you have a stake in being salty though, right, or else why bother talking about it.  Classic bait and switch statement when you follow up by saying, oh, what's there to be salty over. For someone who has no interest in 'their' narrative, you certainly wrote words about it.

" My idea is to bring in materials from hisec needed to build T2 ships and modules " - Don't.  You can by (almost all of ) the goo you need locally too.  Buy and research all the T2 component BPO's, takes 2 weeks to research.  Your goal should be to minimize shipping costs through jump freighting in materials, or if you can jump yourself, make more isk jumping cargo anyway.
---
It is viable.  The upside is that you spend less time updating orders.  The downside is that your volume is a lot lower.  
---
Never build anything until you price *every single cost* to build and then check the market.  Go ahead and build armor hardeners, and you will lose isk doing so.  Not everything can be built to profit, and in null, the difference in local price and Jita can be ... odd.  Check what your tax rates  are on researching, building, and most importantly, your brokering fees at your Null hub.  
---
It is fun, it is profitable, but do your homework.
---
Another tip from another thread is useful, and I'll paraphrase.  Go wide, not tall.  Many different items reduces your exposure to risk.  Don't spend 3 weeks building out a huge stack of Ares, only to see someone import them in and cut your profit off.  If you are selling 20 different items, if one gets undercut by some crazy margin (Like your alliance just got an incursion and all of a sudden Concord modules drop by a huge price) you aren't sitting on an investment with a reduced profit potential and no other income.

If I had to "judge" (hrhr) between two people, one saying stupid and unacceptable things in a rage that in itself was totally righteous and natural and he didnt even know it was public, and one making fun on an open stage about seriously ill people that he knew had a risk of suiciding and telling them to do so laughing from a stage publicly - I would consider the 1st one a hothead, but the 2nd one a disgusting prick without morale and dignity ... simple as that

That‚Äôs a pretty solid answer.

But the one thing some people sometimes dont know is that when your hard burning at 2.2 or 1.8 K is when start to fly straight at the enemy and they start to kite back the way it hurts your missile range.

At about 1.9 to 2.0 it effectiy half‚Äôs your range

So caracals goes down to 30

So changing to fury wouldn‚Äôt of been the right call in my perspective since you already have a low range when your in chase

Find ratting and mining super boring but had ratted to maintain line ships and personal preferences.

About to go on a ratting binge over the next week or two make back that plex money.  Normally I sub with cash but xmas was expensive.

Until I can fly caps&amp; supercaps a goal is always to maintain 2B liquid in my wallet(s), then I guess 40B.  But don't really know about that cost yet.

this is a game that doesn't let you move the main method of interaction with you ship vertically aside from the very edge of the screen, yet allows for it horizontally, don't get your hopes up.

Arguably that's one of the bigger issues the playerbase faces though, the lack of being able to properly organize and categorize alts...

So what's the deal ? Is that BS going to stop at a given moment or 20B monthly sub soon ?

Omega skills stop working once you revert back to Alpha, they're not lost but they revert to max alpha value. Abyssal is probably your best bet at skilling up. FW plex farming might also work OK, you need ISKs to convert LPs into ISKs, but you can usually turn a profit. Expect to need 50m banked to prime the pump.

---
Then you should just try to have as much fun as you can as an Alpha. 
---
&gt; So even a single month of Omega will give me the capacity to bank some Omega skills even if I can't maintain it full time.

When you drop back down to Alpha all those Omega skills get deactivated.

Cyno jammers have a 1 anchor time...they fit in a fucking ceptor. They have literally given you all the tools you need to hunt Rorquals in Delve. Yes some people will pay attention and light when they should, but that is perfectly fine. If someone comes prepared, and has better support than you, they should win. With a 1 minute anchor time though, people are retarded and don't light in time. Source: I'm in the super umbrella whenever I'm on defending half retarded rorqual pilots.  
---
The rest of EVE wants to be bottle fed goon rorqual kills and cry about how impossible it is. HTFU and learn how to utilize the tools that are provided to you, and accept that not every hunt ends in meat on your table.

the links are 17 days, 2 months, 5 months and 10 months, i didnt fuck up anything you spaz
---
Legit, haha
---
on a certain lvl your statement is correct but if your new to game and inside of a week lose two ships.   It can create a mindset of well I am gonna keeping dying and make no progress.   People aren't going to play if they feel the game is hopeless.  
---
What if I told you that EVE is a science experiment to determine just that?
---
The problem is a lot of people only play eve for the multi box playstyle, which is getting harder to do with the plex prices.

*buys plex to pay for new black ops*
---
When i first started playing eve i couldnt afford the sub and it was "15 free days then fuck off" trial so i learned mining skills and mined as much as i could in 15 days then created a new char transfer the items an carry on mining. 
---
It was so painfull and i didnt got anywhere near the cost of a gtc. Then a friend subed his account and Lend it to me so i could properly mine in ns.
---
I did manage to get a lot of isk that way but then he needed help to pay his own gtc so i was never close to pay for my own char, so i went full npc farming and the First dread guristas i killed droped a 300m implant and as ccp had just invented 30days plexes  i bought one for me and started playing on my own account wich is a fully pvp dedicated character. I never mined again till recently when i got a rorq alt but i almost never use it anyways couse i dont like mining regardles of how profitable it is becouse of all this trauma from my eve childhood
---
with this update, you dont need isboxer to log your 50 cloaky ...  "marh5y my ass"  should appreciate the stuff

Looks like one big goddamn advertisement.  Reee.
---
I wasn't there and frankly sad I missed it. What I did make it in time to catch was when Circle of Test picked a few more fights in Tribute than initially planned and fought what may have been the best war I've ever participated in. 
---
It wasn't the biggest or the even the most numbers or whatever else, but it was so much fun. Co2 and Test fought and fought and fought, and the ratio of great actual nailbiter fights versus blueballs or steamrolls was the best I've ever seen in Eve. 
---
Then finishing it all off with the destruction of the very first defended and fully operational Keepstar in all of Eve. Damn that was a blast. 
---
God damn I miss Circle of Test. 
---
Because I never get the chance to brag in game that I have about 130B liquid and about maybe like 2-300B in assets spread across my accounts. 
---
I totally agree that there are Rorq kills to be had under the current mechanics, and hope this didn‚Äôt come off as a ‚Äúgrrrr Rorquals are overpowered post‚Äù.  I am more interested in how the grid would look, and how the meta would change if mining anoms were in deadspace pockets.

This actually isn't true. Nullsec ship kills have more or less stabilized at around 3.5 million per year since 2014 with some slight variation.

&gt; You've never even once in your life gotten angry and shouted "ffs, I'm going fkn KILL THEM when I get my hands on him" and, y'know, not actually killed them?

Yes?  You called?

Yes. He is helping in a limited engagement. Will make him suspect.

I gave up my two monitors to give to my sons.  I also went half with the ex to buy parts and build them their own PCs recently.  Ex wives and child support can be extremely taxing on income.  I hope you don't ever have to experience this.

Well, tell to a northern guy the war was named "Casino War" and you get downvote in mass and find out one of the most juicy salt in /r/eve always fun to read tbh

you do realize virtuesignalling and callout culture is worthless right? apparently not.
---
EVE is the only thing in the world like EVE. It's the only MMO worth playing, one of the few games where PVP will cause you to have near cardiac arrest and the strategic and tactical elements are so deep you'll keep learning new things even after 10+ years of experience. There is nothing more satisfying than a good fleet fight, especially small gang, there just isn't anything else like it. The concern over skill injectors is way over-blown, as skillpoints are far, far, FAR less important than player skill, teamwork and decision-making in this game, especially since the removal of off-grid boosters. And despite endless cries about the game dying from a vocal minority, the stats show that the game has more-or-less maintained a consistent level of PVP activity over the last 5 years (about 3.5 million ships killed per year in nullsec alone).
---
To build on the OP's idea, I have long wanted to detach and turn the 3D view into "Just Another Window" like the 3D System Map currently is. 
---
On low end PCs it could be used to dramatically reduce EVE's GPU usage.
---
For high end PCs, it could lead to multiple independent 3D views + overviews -- e.g. have second camera view to watch gate, logi, your target, etc. I posted that idea [two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/51tutf/ccpls_multiple_independent_camera_views/) and CCP replied:
---
&gt;We have experimented with variations of multiple-camera rendering a while back, and were concerned at the time that the performance was not  at the level we'd be happy with. It would be great to revisit it at some point but it's not something we have any plans to do right now.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\--- [CCP Darwin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/51tutf/ccpls_multiple_independent_camera_views/d7ez1e3) 
---
/u/Estravolt [is technically correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/alz3ig/option_to_detach_things_like_chat_boxes_dscan/efi2zts) that you can span the client over 2 screens and use the Camera Offset feature to move the ship over, but Overview Brackets will still float to the edge of that other screen, and the other screen wastes GPU power rendering 3D space that won't be looked at. 
---
It also creates a "tunnel vision" effect that may be nauseating. When a client is made horizontally larger, EVE does not increase the horizontal field of view to compensate. Instead, it crops the top and bottom of a(n otherwise) 4:3 view. This can be proven by switching to 1024x768 in station - you will see the "missing" vertical space.
---
&gt;hope this didn‚Äôt come off as a ‚Äúgrrrr Rorquals are overpowered post‚Äù. 
---
It did.
---
"Soon".  See you in November.
---
I remember when plexing your account went from 900mil to 1.2bil and that was the end of the world. So this kind of inflation doesn't surprise me.
---
If you enjoy PVP with intense fights, tactical and strategic depth, there's nothing else even close to it. Start flying in some small gangs with a frigate and get a feel for it.
---
When you undock your ship is not always pointing in the same direction. It could be way off from your bookmark.

There are 2 ways to check. Have your tactical overlay enabled and look at the blue line to see the direction your ship is going. Or enable first person camera to see where it is pointed. If it's within a certain degrees (really don't know exactly how much) you will instantly warp. Bigger ships this is more important then smaller ships. 
---
They'll just leave a bot 1-2 jumps out that either reads local there or permanently d-scans a gate and reacts if something appears. 
---
Thankfully we still have some stuff which requires using more than 3 braincells. Stuff like being on a (good) AT team, high level FC, high level leadership while not being retarded etc.
---
Any old chump with sp and isk can f1 with their titan in a fleet, but it's not really end game if any old chump can do it imo
---
Thanks!
---
Your face is 100% bait, for cock.
---
i just use my RL money, but then i dont need 20 accounts... fuck pelx
---
I thought I was the only one who used real money to pay for accounts. Mind you, I too am limited to 2-3 at a time because I share finances with another, but....yeah. It's good to see others that do too.
---
dont wait till last moment to evac stuff
---
Let's go back to calling panfam N3 too.
---
Any bot will just switch to dscan monitoring, and be better at doing so than a human: this change will affect botters less than real people, so it's silly to justify it as motivated by fighting botters.  
---
Justifying nerfing local because of bots is dumb and dishonest.  If you want to nerf local, bring an honest reason.
---
cummon bruh, I am tryhard... didn't you like my spreadsheets!?
---
you mean players can disrupt botting from working multiple jumps away forever?
---
you mean bots get fucking owned for free from wormholes? 
---
I'm very OK with this 
---
I am bad it will be fixed.
---
I remember 60day gtc  was like 300mill..
---
No, it's gonna be a Pay2Win korean game in a year.
---
I'll give you a hint
---
where does plex come from 
---
A war fought to evict the bees. World war bee. Simple
---
Why why would this person do this there is so much nope here 
---
A few years ago I was close to getting burnt out on eve. We had had a long war and for the umpteenth time I had re-staged my Nyx without it seeing any battle. So I decided to sell it and see what to do.
---
Between selling the Nyx and the character I had a lot of isk so I was: hey, let's buy a lot of game-time, which I did, a years worth of game-time. Being burnt down on eve I cut my game-time by a lot.
---
But because I didn't have the monthly race for the plex anymore I started noticing I had more fun in Eve, because I was doing only fun stuff. No more grinding isk or breaking rocks.......just fleets.
---
Big fleets, small fleets, serious fleets, drunk fleets, all of them.
---
I got my fun back: less time in game, but more quality time.
---
So after a year, my plextime ran out and I was like: "I'm never going to mine again" took my credit-card and I bought a years worth of subscription. Been doing that for 3 years now and it's well worth it.
---
To each their own, but if you go back and see how much time you spend in-game, I'd say it's well worth it to go for the subscription.
---
What he's saying is that it's just a band-aid fix that doesn't solve the problem. Botters will leave alt scouts and spam d-scan to avoid getting caught.
---
The root of the problem needs to be fixed.
---
Also, I'd be perfectly happy with a local delay. It's just not the solution to botters.
---
dont let it get destroyed
---
Context plz?
---
This is ironic.
---
&gt;When you drop back down to Alpha all those Omega skills get deactivated.
---
I'm aware of that. And to even to reasonably consistently purchase Omega most months I'm going to need certain sets of Omega skills. So the plan is to max out my isk production capabilities in Alpha. Get the needed Omega skill books pre installed along with certain Omega ships I want prepurchased within reason. Then preplan which Omega skills I need to work on while Omega is in effect to further maximize isk production. If Omega lapses then such is life, but it'll be a reasonably short lived setback before I can kick it back in to grow further. Eventually I should have the skills and equipment to maintain Omega most if not all the time.
---
My biggest question is what happens to the timers on Omega skills that are in training at the times I return to Alpha? Do the timers continue even though I can't use the skill since I'm no longer Omega, or does the timer freeze or get auto removed from the training que? If the first instance is true I can use that to maximize Omega training beyond the Omega month.
---
Lol
---
In the video description
---
A 1 minute anchor time is 45 seconds too long.
---
Not for nothing but from your list most of those posts are not from more than two years ago, two are, four aren‚Äôt.
---
Not all of us are helpless krabs.
---
Yeah, that will stop all the exploration bots, mission bots, FW bots, courier bots, highsec mining bots and totally won't impact regular players and won't vastly benefit "hunters" more.  
---
Oops, would it make Rorqs too easy to kill with subcap fleets?
---
Nice opinion. Just one tiny problem with it. Inspecting your post, it looks like your opinion is different from the alliance's.
---
Boy, let me tell you something.
---
Barra is the baseline for opinions, any opinion he holds is objectively correct and, as a result, any other opinions are wrong. And guess what? You happen to hold a wrong one. And I hope you know that your opinion is now illegal. I have now contacted the FBI, the CIA, CCP, the Danish SEALs, Test Alliance, and your dad. You'll rot in prison for the rest of your life over this, mark my words you'll be sorry you ever shared your opinions. By the time you're reading this, you're done for boy. Nature will punish you. Humanity will punish you. Supernatural beings will punish you. Space will punish you. Oh yeah, and we decided that just to make sure we'll awox your titan from orbit so there's no chance you can run away and everyone you know ingame will die. It's a small price to pay for cultural cleansing. May this post be a warning for anyone else brave enough to share an incorrect opinion; you've been warned.
---
&gt; The root of the problem needs to be fixed.
---
Exactly. The _problem_, imo, is that certain EVE activities are fundamentally too easy to bot.  It's not an easy solve, but it's one that I _think_ CCP are probably thinking about with their experimentations with, as an example, Abyssal PVE.
---
That's a lot of fuck you ISK 
---
Delve FTW. I earned 150b in a year, enough for a Super and a Titan.
---
plex is still cheap.
---
i've been saying this constantly.
---
it's 17 plex per day. lets round up to 4m per unit. that's still only 68m per day.
---
most people can make that in an hour, or less. it's 2 and a bit high sec incursion sites, it's less than an hour in a rorqual, etc.
---
even if you suck at isk making it's 2hrs in a VNI, that you can do almost entirely afk.
---
on top of that you have the passive income of research, industry jobs, reactions, PI, etc.
---
so for a few mins a month installing jobs, and probably less than an hour a day actively making isk, you can still easily plex an account.
---
The worst thing here is about the cookies on the website
---
Yikes
---
Someone spent to much time in jita and lost track of reality.  
---
I dunno. I think the players made it harder than it used to be.
---
There was a time when only freighters got suicide ganked. Highsec was reeeeally safe. I'd autopilot everywhere, didn't matter. Burn Jita didn't exist. Highsec was a newbro's playground.
---
People who want isk for real money. Same as people who want game time for real money. I enjoy playing the game to get isk, but I pay irl money for game time. Different levels for different people.
---
I may or may not be able to make this one. It's my birthday that day and I have no idea how hectic it might be.
---
Cause bots can't use dscan. Or live in hi sec. Gotcha.
---
I'm aware. The biggest question I have is what happens to the timers on Omega skill in training at the time I drop back to Alpha status? Do the timers freeze, auto-remove the skill training from the que, or simply continue even though I can't use the skills once they are trained?
---
I alternate between plex and irl cash.
---
if there's a subscription sale, or I've been lazy with isk making/been too busy to log in and actually play then I'll sub with irl cash. else, I'll plex.
---
however, any account past the 1st must be able to fund itself via plex or it goes omega and i don't worry as the account clearly isn't worth having.
---
damage cap 8 ships with 8 arty. 
---
Could you show your working please?
---
And back then getting 300m was much more work than it is today 
---
It would stil be better to get a job than to grind Ingame for much less. 
---
63m ISK per day is a very easy amount of ISK to earn these days.
---
asher plz
---
Since when I believe NC people won't post stupid proposals on Reddit?
---
as long as ccp makes it easier to make isk, people will have more isk. if people have more isk, plex prices will go up 
---
about 60b in isk, no clue really on assets.  all i can say is I "think" 250-300 range
---
this argument has been done hundreds of times
---
"they'll bring bots to watch everything with dscan and overview" 
---
then they can't see wormholes and dscan immune ships
---
"but they'll just dock up until you leave" 
---
and if you leave out a wormhole, they'll never see you leave 
---
"they won't just dock up forever they'll go back out eventually though" 
---
then they die?
---
It's his ritual mating dance. Hes trying to attract his like minded life mate, and since you're the only one that noticed it, it must be you.
---
spod bless
---
shrug, when 30day gtc was pushing 500m that was a few hours for carrier pilots, few hours for incursion runners or escalation runners, mining was slower back than because it didn't net that much aside multiboxing. ahhhh thems the days.
---
you do realize using the term "virtue signalling" makes you an insufferable dipshit right? apparently not.
---
Do this, but in a links ship. You just turn on links, get a logi to perma lock you with isk bribes, and enjoy the cinematic experience.
---
The bagpipes was the only thing I really like, for the reasons you've listed.
---
Yes.
---
I hear people enjoy speedy deliveries of torpedoes in deep null.
---
tbh, without trolling like I did above, at the beginning the war was not about "evict bees" it was IWI who seek revenge against SMA bankers who stole money from IWI and Goons decide to help SMA but IWI saw a lot of weakness within the CFC and decide to escalate the shit storm by buying even more alliance (ok some join the hype train, 'cause you know, free money is always good). It's only after a few month IWI and MBC was fighting CFC (not only goons let's not forgive it). I think, the name even came before IWI decide to ramp up against CFC, name pick by a CCP dev btw I need to check the date to confirm it, but I'm not sure about this part.
---
My army of rorqs says otherwise on the multi boxing decreasing comment 
---
Point taken, i'll delete my comment
---
Spodbless
---
And none of that changes the effect that bots will be more equipped to handle the additional busywork/spreadsheet vigilance better than a person.
---
"I want to nerf local to make things easier to catch" is a valid line of discussion.
---
"I want to nerf local to solve the botting issue" is not.
---
Other than co.ments where they call it world war bee when was the last one? I just honestly laughed at a higher effort shitpost than usual
---
All those bots you mentioned are highly catchable. There are entire corps that make it their life mission to kill high sec mining bots. The vast majority of these bots are VNI/Carrier/Super spammers in nullsec.
---
Nicely done.
---
Ha!  I'm a believer.
---
"Everyone should be more vulnerable because I'm already in a safe place."
---
I do the same. I dont want to have the pressure of grinding isk every month just to plex my accounts.
---
Unexpected ending
---
Imma give you that
---
He said multiboxing in pvp. You multiboxing combat rorqs and dunking small gang roams?
---
Now just delete your profile
---
&gt;plex is still cheap.i've been saying this constantly.it's 17 plex per day. lets round up to 4m per unit. that's still only 68m per day.most people can make that in an hour, or less. it's 2 and a bit high sec incursion sites, it's less than an hour in a rorqual, etc.even if you suck at isk making it's 2hrs in a VNI, that you can do almost entirely afk.on top of that you have the passive income of research, industry jobs, reactions, PI, etc.so for a few mins a month installing jobs, and/or probably less than an hour a day actively making isk, you can still easily plex an account.
---
So you "play" 60 hours each month and then you have to make time to *play* the game.
---
I think part of what made it stick was the triggered response from mittani along with the #notallimperium spiel
---
That's good news, because I have lots of bp's from different areas.
---
Multiboxing has been a thing for much longer than the last five years and these are ship kill statistics. If there's truly been a significant decrease in PVP activity it would be reflected in the data.
---
Oh cool another boring post. Haven‚Äôt seen one of these in a while

Hello there!

I seen in Wormhole ice haveresting site. In a C13 if i remember.

When i said this poeple said me, impossible ice haveresting site doesen't exist in WH.

Have you got an explication about that?

 I have mine ice and wasen't drunk \^\^

Maybe thoses WH are rare occasion?

Thank's you and appologies for my mistakes in English (I'm Belgian)

\[I actually recorded this form up\]([https://youtu.be/D5emDzq-Akc](https://youtu.be/D5emDzq-Akc)). Was fun while it lasted.
---
I mean, I'm not knocking anybody that can plex their subscription, but I wouldn't be able to stand playing eve if I had to grind for my sub every month.
---
I pay for my sub with irl money, and I'm happy to do it because that means I log in to do what I want without worrying about making enough isk.
---
It hasn't been going up that rapidly either. Like 2 years ago it was around 1.6 bil.
---
you're about to be a skill urself dropout if you keep up all this reddit posting
---
fuck
---
I have 3 accounts that I actually use. But recently I unsubbed all but my main, because I was paying for the others to sit around.
---
I'm not super active in eve, but I'm totally fine with a single character.
---
With that response u are perfect for eve. Create the freaking account and get into the game immediately!!!!
---
What would be super awesome is if instead of looking at my flair, and responding to that, you actually thought through what you're saying. 
---
Dscan - Doesn't show affiliation (Blue/Red/etc). So the only code you could do there would be 'if a ship shows up'. Which would result in your bot warping out and going idle every time a blue went through your space. This wouldn't work well at all.
---
Other-side of gate - Which one? All of them? They only bot in dead end systems? Do you know the code/logic required in 'hive minding' a bunch of bots together, it's do-able but beyond most people. Also once I figure this out, I can just park a hostile afk in his scout system, and all his bots go offline. 
---
The majority of 'bots' are VNIs, carriers, and supers. The 30 second delay gives you enough time to load system, dscan them, and get to them before they auto warp off. As has always been the case, the instant information is the issue.
---
I'll fkin do it 
---
Sub are easier to grind IRL than in game tbh
---
U better boy!!!!

You mean "Yay free time!"

Arlight, thank you! Whats a TZ? and how do I go about finding friends outside of the newb corp I am currently in? 
---
I can read about abyssals on eve uni, but what do you mean by T1's? I know it means Tier 1 crafts but no clue what that typically entails.
---
I still don't know how to go about finding what you want to do, so is there any tips you'd have for that?

virtue signalling is literally something that all human beings do and is a core part of how our species functions. the virtues may change or be in dispute, but they are always signalled.
---
in fact, using the term "callout culture" is a pretty good example of virtue signalling, as its use clearly positions the user on the socio-political spectrum, and indicates a moral stance. 
---
&gt;I haven't given thought to actually losing or gaining resources due to portions of the screen being covered by chat boxes etc but rendering anyway.  
---
&gt;But I believe your description of chunking is accurate.  To help draw a parallel - as task manager shows 10 instances of chrome open but only 1 actual application allowing drags of tabs of differing sizes wherever the user wishes.    
---
&gt;The detach key is there and was added in one of the many iterations of Eve as it evolved, specifically probe scanning, but it does not allow it to be pulled away from the actual eve client instance.

If you become happy with the skills on your characters you can also injector farm them and sustain the sub that way (character needs to be training at 2700SP/hr though).
---
Thank God I don't have to interact with eve players in person tbh
---
No I agree with that guy, I have never once done what gigx did,  and I've gotten passionate about lots of things 
---
Note that the actions in question here are not merely using the idiom 'fucking kill,' which obviously is not taken literally, but threatened him unambiguously and specifically irl. It's ridiculous to suggest that that's something anyone would do.
---
&gt;Geezus Christ. If you're too poor IRL to afford a sub, you're probably too dumb to play Eve anyway. Get out.
---
Wow, that's actually a pretty douchebag comment, even for you, Valk.
---
Blanket local delay angers too many nullbears.
---
A more reasonable request is just making it privy to one ship. It's due time CCP made a ship class dedicated to covert hunting. Cloaky recon ships suck for that task. Their emergent role is EWAR support atm. T3s are good but then people whine about their other abilities, and they get nerfs and balances discouraging covert hunting.
---
A new recon class cruiser. Covert. Good with probing. Good tank particularly vs fighters. Cloaky recon cyno bonus moved to this ship. Has 1 minute local delay. Fast warp and agile. Meanwhile, it has almost no dps. And its on-grid speed is shit. And its resists are drained the longer it stays in the 20 seconds cyno cycle, so defenders better have reps to save it.
---
Preciate ya :) 
---
i like having a lot of isk and giving it to others to see the smiles on their faces
---
Don't worry. Those heroes are back! More and more with each day!
---
You do realize super bots are always aligned? Sure you might catch some vnis but thats about it.
---
Do you need a hug?
---
Wheeee wheeeee i want to play for freeeeeee.
---
Stop taking shit in the shower.
---
Don't you need to revive Nulli Secunda in order to get the all 3 N's in N3?
---
Besides PL was never part of N3 anyhow. The mega-coalition that ended up victorious after the war where B-R happend was called N3PL, therefore PL wasn't part of the 3 N's.
---
On a serious note, what happend to Nulli secunda anyway? At one point they where thriving in the east and then ProgodLegend is head-FC of TEST and Nulli has disappeared all of the sudden?
---
Its always a≈Ü op success when you win the shitposting war in local.

They swung, they missed, then shrugged and shut up shop gracefully.
---
My secretary at work keeps it all straight since I play at work.
---
&gt;You prove my statement of steady decline from 2013 on. Thanks for that o7
---
You think I did, but I didn't. 2016 had, before the big spike for alphas and rorquals, about \~31k average. We are at \~33k since then. What this means is that the changes have stabilized the numbers and that the numbers stayed stable all through 2017/2018. Yes, there was a big drop from 2012/2013, but the rorqual/alpha changes weren't the cause for the drop. They were the bandaid to stop it and they did just that.   
---
&gt; You did not understand what I was saying on the PLEX/real money issue. Yes the Plex4ISK buyers net CCP exactly that money a PLEX4realmoney buyer has put into the pot earlier. 
---
That makes no difference, as without people opting to buy Plex with ISK, there would be no demand for plex and if you couldn't sell plex for decent ammounts, then people would start buying less of them. It's not just black and white, as Plex Supply and Demand go hand in hand together. You can't just say "Demand" doesn't matter as it's a function of both, supply and demand.   
---
Your view is stupidly one sided when you say that only the buyers matter and: WRONG.  
---
&gt; Remind me in 1 year, I suggest the PLEX price for 30d sub will be at 2.5 Bil, while the ISK/hour of a Rorqual will sink below 100Mio/h because of the mineral floods on the markets. 
---
The real value of a rorqual is, outside of -1.0 systems at below 100mil already (if you factor in HW and clearing the entire belt and not just sniping gneiss. So, that's already the case.   
---
Also, the tears are already there and they are coming from all the people that can't kill a rorqual and that complain about the big and evil capital proliferation (which is a side effect of mass minerals). My prediction is: these people will complain even louder once the backends regions they are usually trying to gank in get more capitals too.
---
Unfortunately I believe this would have the unintended side effect of protecting rorquals more than they are already protected. 
---
Most groups in delve operate by killing or stealing excavators now and by turning the site into beaconed pocket it would be almost impossible for them to do either... 
---
CCP should do something though to help balance the risk/reward as lighting a cyno within a min for 99.99% safety is not balance. 
---
I bet goons will be all for the change after reading my comment lol. 
---
&gt; If you're a good fit and spend more than $10,000 USD on us in the first month I'll even let you undock one of my Rorquals and hit the PANIC so you can feel what it's like to be at the Eve endgame
---
If you're a good fit and spend more than $10,000 USD on me I'd still report you for account sharing.
---
Independent of the desire to craft a favorable narrative for one side or the other, the ‚ÄúCasino War‚Äù sums up the driving force of the war.  Endless free ISK from IWI.  They wanted a war, had the money to fund a war, so they bought and paid for a war.  Sure people did not like CFC, but what got them to band together then than anytime before....sweet sweet free IWI ISK baby. 
---
WWB would have been more appropriate if all of Eve rose up on their own, and banded together to fight the evil Goons with no motivation other than wanting to push our stuff in....because...well...reasons.  
---
In actually it was a war, bought and paid for by IWI, with the rest of Eve for the most part simple merc working for them.  It‚Äôs just the scale of the merc army and the vast amount of unassailable ISK that was spent that makes it different. 
---
Maybe a better name may have been the IWI War,  it was really their War after all.  They paid for it, why not name it after them. 
---
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make an invincible ship so I can kill things without any risk!‚Äù

eve is much easier now, better tutorials there's whole corps dedicated to teaching newbros, the skill system restructure is probably the biggest one though, I'd say just the removal of learning skills makes the beginning of the game 5x easier and more convenient for new players.

True but my point here is making money, not ennemies :D

---
I don't mind there being a casual game. Lots of gamers are casual and if they want to fund CCP and populate New Eden, that's good. But the player controlled empire building parts of the game - everything but highsec, really, now we have Upwell structures - should not be easy and safe.
---
The Great War of year #####
---
Haha yeah. I just started playing again after quitting around that time, and I wished I had dumped all my isk into plex before I quit.
---
Well, from what I remember the story was that IWI banker got his assets stolen by SMA, not SMA banker stealing from IWI
---
Got some numbers to back that up?
---
Copy pasta spot.
---
You know....
---
Soooooooooo.....
---
World War Bee?
---
careful to not cut yourself on that edge mate
---
More like The War of Karma.
---
So, by that logic wouldn't you be unable to call the Imperium by CFC anymore either since groups like SMA, FCON, CO2 have long since departed.
---
Or is caring about what groups call themselves and/or refusing to use their self-described name retarded and petty? Makes me think.
---
Sperglords gonna sperg. I'm here for the comedy, sorry about the weaponized autism.

Love it

Some alliances are shells of what they were. CFC still has the main Goon alliance and several old hands so I think you can say that.

---
Sure, just make sure there are things you can sell for a profit and are light enough that you can carry enough of them.
---
Also keep in mind that besides your own hauling, there are people who provide jump freighter transport services and they might have cheaper tariffs on the null-hs than the other way around.

One thing you could trade is in faction modules that drop in that area, try to buy them cheap enough from your ratter alliance mates and sell them in HS at good price.
---
watched the video...just for the music on that video he should be evicted!!!!

that KENSHIN thing

9,999,989.96
---
VNI ratting mate, it's free money while i do what i was going to do irl anyway and makes my account free.
---
alternatively, those industry jobs i put in the cooker that takes me a few mins a month make my game time free.
---
the amount of actual 'playing' to plex an account is trivially low - that's why the price keeps rising.
---
Don't worry, next CCP balance pass is in like...6 months.  They'll remove 5 MS max velocity and .00000001 agility and call them balanced for another 3 years in true CCP fashion.
---
This shit: https://youtu.be/OpQ09N3I1tU

Same. Toronto boy checking in!

Honk honk oink oink
---
Time to start skillfarming your main you mean
---
Whats a subaru? 
---
Jesus fuck.
---
It‚Äôs an argument because CCP has done a shit job of actually applying these rules. I have a friend who was banned for rage telling another player he should hang himself out of game via in game Convo. It‚Äôs a fair ban. It happened four months before wizardhatgate.
---
Said friend is still banned despite having matured quite a lot in the intervening years and has respectfully requested that he be allowed to play again, and has been told no by CCP and that his permaban was a player ban. He‚Äôs asked at various times and been told the same thing every time. No new characters, no getting his old character back.
---
Mittens gets to play, others don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not a fair application of rules and it honestly doesn‚Äôt seem to matter what the rules were at the time. My friend was a fucking nobody in game.
---
gigX was leader of a relatively small if somewhat significant at points in time alliance.
---
Mittens is *still* leader of the largest alliance in the game, and one that has long has a culture of shitflinging any time they get upset about things
---
If you were CCP would you equally apply the rules to those three? No, you wouldn‚Äôt, they didn‚Äôt, and anything besides acknowledging that fact is beebrain koolaid.
---
Mittens should be just as banned for wizardhatgate as gigX is for ragehands or my friend is for telling someone to hang themselves.
---
Note: I personally think all three should in fact be banned. Not up for debate.
---
its on grid speed is shit...means its killable
---
btw not taking sides in the argument, just saying if its slow...you can kill it!
---
Its really hard to meet you at that coffee shop.
---
yeah, really the only option is zkill or you just post a screenshot of your fit from pyfa. 
---
"play the game like you want to play it."
---
This is not helping the anti-botting narrative right now sir. Do YOU support botting!?
---
I love how they Biomassed those characters now.
---
Don't threaten me with a good time.
---
Shit doesn't work like that. You can't just go back to a years old case from time when policies were different and apply a ban.
---
Back in the day the policies were fucked up, doesn't mean anyone should get different treatment today because someone else was/was not convicted years ago.
---
THERE'S A CROW ATTACKING ME!!!
---
fuck they're on to me
---
Don't you love when 90% of the window are adds?
---
I don‚Äôt disagree - I just think ‚ÄúWORLD WAR BEE‚Äù is a cringy name, and knowing the creativity within the EVE community we can do better. 
---
He was asking for cringy stuff, not legendary!
---
Travis tackled by crow was legendary.
---
I demand local chat!
---
You know you can go back into Rookie Chat after your 30 days are up.  There's a bunch of us who hang out there daily to help noobs.
---
ONE!
---
Haha nailed it
---
Not so much really. Youll find that term being used by both those that problems with it like myself.. as well as those engaging in it.
---
The bottom line is regardless of it's presence in society it is pathetically ineffective in actually achieving anything because it provokes negative reactions from the targetted recipients..
---
Mike don't make write 4 pages on this.
---
Thats one butch groom
---
i think ENorn is just a market speculator and wants to buy up all the plex and wants to make sure its a good idea :P
---
I wish I did, CCP is pretty closed lip with those details other than 'we banned xyz amount of things'. However if you take a stroll through various nullsec areas, you'll find system after system of 1-3 VNIs all botting away. The reason these types of bots are used is because they generate instant ISK without having to do any other action. That isk is then sold off for RMT, because USD goes a long way in other countries. All the other forms of bots require a lot more market interaction to produce that result. 
---
I think we can all agree that none of us really care about the lone guy that bots a single orca in highsec to make some isk while he's at work. That's rare, and really not a major issue for the game as a whole. These nullsec botters however make 41bil a month, running a single VNI 23/7. That becomes 207bil when you upgrade it to a super. 
---
You can make the sites more complex, remove VNIs, make it so loot has to be picked-up. However since the bot can run a super, it can do all these things. The only real solution is to enable the player base a means in which to catch these players. 
---
The only other solution I can think of that may work, would be to give some of the cruiser rats HIC points. As well as making every single frigate that spawns tackle. They could simply re-code the bots to prioritize these targets, but that would open up a small window(maybe) to catch the botter. 
---
T2 PoS
---
I too am okay with doing something with local. Just not too sure if delaying it would take care of all the issues we have with it.
---
May be a temp constellation wide local inhib could work, 5 mins of frozen local, though this wouldn't be great for small solo ships (price, cargo space), it could be better for small gangs though. Just a thought.
---
It‚Äôs a good format, quit being such an insufferable twat. 
---
It's great. I feel like a space smuggler moving them all out of goon space onto the black market. 
---
Heh.. More like 'work 60 hours for $15' - about $0.25/hr
---
Have you used local recently?
---
A 30 second to 1 minute delay would be an improvement.
---
Yeah, fucked op the recording, should have coms on the next one 
---
Sounds like a personal problem my dude.
---
I 100% agree with this, was not able to complete the event because I was not at home, and when I was, I had company, so I wasn't logging on to eve. It was kind of a dick move, but such is life, none of the rewards were ZOMGWTFBBQ, good so ...
---
Jesus. Fuck.
---
Read what I fucking wrote.
---
The ‚Äúpolicies were different‚Äù line doesn‚Äôt fucking stack up.
---
It‚Äôs not a fucking conviction. It‚Äôs a game run by a private company.
---
I don‚Äôt particularly give a shit what CCP does now. They fucked up when they unbanned mitts and created a precedent that looks like shit but is at least honest. Now it looks like favoritism regardless of what it actually is.
---
LOL! That's kind of my point. Look at the TONS of bots that got killed in those short times when local was boinked. 
---
I started about 2 weeks before Apocrypha.
---
By far the best expansion ever.
---
&gt; As a result some people were likely unable to complete the event. 
---
ok
---
Probably Richter's utter breakdown about not being allowed to be an edgelord during the cultural revolution.
---
Ah, you could have just written "REEEE GRR MITTUNS!" and this convo would have made as much sense.
---
in evictus i'm fine with it cause if someone dies in highsec while we have several active war decs they should pay for their mistake so they learn not to do it again
---
These are real tweets. ;-) 
---
I actually managed to get a few solo kills for once. Also bought and fitted up a Damavik for shits and giggles. Really like the aesthetic and I'm sure itll blow up in 10 minutes when I undock it, but still.
---
It's an all-wheel-drive vehicle that gay vegan wormholers drive.
---
Have a event where random NPC convoys are traveling thru space, but they show up in local and D-scan, thus the bots can get continuously tripped. As a bonus its new content for players to hunt down and kill. Win-Win.
---
Yeah not too bad for us credit card warriors rn
---
I'm the guy who set up the Ragnarok with smartbombs and whatnot in the new EVE Gameplay video. I honestly can't remember why it had that fit or where I got it from.  I have definitely never flown a Titan before (I like ceptors). I have blown up quite a few in videos though! Anyway, sorry about that goof -- but don't worry they don't let me do any kind of ship-balancing, or plugging things into electrical sockets. Happy Friday! &lt;3
---
I too did not get rewarded in game for all the years i did not yet play eve! OMG
---
Do you pay RL money for your ships and stuff too?   
---
Orca and 2 Skiffs. Orca has full boost (on mining laser) except the ORE Foreman Mindlink implant where im 4 days away from. 
---
1 of the Skiff accounts has full T2 Laser Crystals and the other just got into the Skiff. 
---
You are going to have to remind me, I legit forget. 
---
Not a recording.. But being texted and told to call of work sick because a big fight was about to happen/happening and they needed everyone online. So cringe... Get a life... Left that Corp soon after. 
---
Okay. I have 1 char atm in an Orca. Makes okay isk.
---
In a way, I guess. I usually buy a bunch of plex at once, then just coast on that for a year or so. I don't usually buy much. I only have 1 capital ship right now, and I'm looking at selling it because I never use it.
---
subcaps usually aren't so expensive that I need to plex to buy one.
---
I agree.
---
Sov and citadel mechanics should be directly tied to each individual system based on activity.
---
Assign pve/exploration, mining, and pvp a formulated "activity" value for the sov holding alliance.
---
The higher the activity, the less vulnerable a system is.
---
Invading citadels or structures anchored in an enemy system have their vulnerability scaled to that alliance's activity in that system as well.
---
Anchoring time should scale to your / holder's activity in a system, and structures should be vulnerable at launch.
---
This would make those useless pocket or pipe systems extremely easy to capture, and make it much harder to drop random structures all over the place if you're trying to invade.  Plus, if you want to keep your deployed structures, you have to actually be active in that system, not just cyno in when it comes out of RF.
---
Yes. It's a great game. I have been playing for a bit less than a year now and I friggin still love it every day I log in 
---
That, and selling us stuff
---
Searched for this comment, wasn't disappointed.
---
I have an old mail where I was buying 90 day gtc for 300 mil.
---
tfw goons actually do this
---
lol I care?
---
It's no secret I have lots of SP farm characters which require PLEX, MPTCs, and extractors. I just don't like people talking out of their butt.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
When I do that on my 3 monitors, as I mentioned in Moqueefa's other thread it results in 3 problems:
---
* Edge brackets drift to the far edges of the other two screens where they can't be seen
---
* GPU is wasted rendering space covered by other windows (even a docked System Map)
---
* The "tunnel vision zoom effect" can sometimes make me motion-sick\*
---
\*When a client is horizontally widened, EVE does not increase horizontal FOV angle to compensate like every other game. Instead, it crops the top and bottom. The result is a sometimes puke-inducing "tunnel vision" effect. 
---
Interestingly, EVE's FOV angle is locked to one suited for the 4:3 (e.g. 1024x768) CRT monitors of 10 years ago. This can be proven by switching to 1024x768 in station; you will see the  "missing" vertical space.

it's Valkorsia, his karma is probably in the negatives anyway.

not nearly as bad as wormrholers tho

Removing the utility high was a mistake.

I do not care about the launcher, can I trade this for a useful feature? No? OK, but maybe make the next update good? Thank you. :)

---
it literally took you 3 seconds to get the reward. you'd have taken longer bathroom breaks than it would've taken you to get your reward.
---
CCP is calling it World War Bee, ergo it is officially WWB
---
Be really cool to get a report from CCP on super/titan numbers in regions. Enjoyed your story tho, never knew that is why the restrict sales. 
---
[Nobody cares.](https://i.imgur.com/XnFNA8Z.jpg)
---
&gt;YOU CAN‚ÄôT FUCKING GIVE UP ON BALANCE!
---
can't give up on something you never had faith in to begin with.
---
Remove PANIC and refund the SP, thanks.
---
&gt;Alright, time to drop the memes and get serious for a moment
---
Stopped reading right there. Make memes great again!
---
So basically you got shit on in Geminate and now Eve is broken???
---
Neat. Most of the guys from your service didnt bother with receipts and stuff lol
---
Amsterdam is a great place, I'm a local so feel free to hit me up if you want a list of good places to go to :)
---
&gt; Found the bot.
---
not at all.
---
all your suggestion does is make it easier to hunt players - bots will be unaffected.
---
Bring exploration loot from null back via wormholes is absolutely a good idea.
---
You're unlikely to get a lot of value from moving stuff the other way, unless you join an alliance and stock things for them.
---
Lets
---
About 5b is required as lowsec line member to buy decent amount of subcap doctrines.
---
And over 50% guys have some kind of capital alts so I think it will be 10~15bill after excluding some odd super rich.
---
If you really want to see how titans are flown, hit me up and we'll work something out ;-)
---
How about doxxing and outing FCs of hostile Alliances?  Is that ok?
---
I don't think there's any need to be paranoid about Tripwire or Pathfinder. Both are also open source so you can host yourself if you really are that paranoid.
---
Thanks! Gives me some ideas to try out.  
---
I don't hate miners. All my torps and bombs are delivered with love, in the true spirit of Wingspan Deliveries.
---
Ah, so, you are not civilized after all, just a troll... 
---
why stop at panic. Remove rorqs and refund the sp
---
What are you doing on r/eve then? It's practically nothing butt people talking out their butts. 
---
You some salty dude who got a boner against Test or something?
---
Fantastic offer! I'm mostly interested in seeing how titans explode into little tiny hilarious pieces but I'll take what I can get!
---
hy benches pounds of naan bread irl
---
So the bots that die in droves everytime local breaks, that's just coincidence? 
---
Damn rocks. Sitting there just looking all smug. 
---
progod is my waifu
---
Or they just filter out the NPC names.
---
This is a problem (not that you do it but that it's possible to collect that much ISK so easily).
---
Some people dance, some workout, this guy scans ZKB for Test losses. Each to their own.
---
Do you know what HP Lovecraft named his cat?
---
To be fair, I never thought of logging in from mobile.  I didn't know you could get to the item redemption system that way.  Buuuut... I can't help but think the goal was to get people to actually log in and play, not just do a drive-by login on the shitter.  YMMV though.
---
The one where Grath rages a bunch
---
Jita fits most of the criteria besides gate campers but war dec mechanics have changed so you should be good
---
That was pretty funny x) I had a suspicion that maybe they were like some ultimate ccp mods that didn't need sense in the matter when fitted. 
---
That's just poor fiscal management then. 
---
This is relevant how?  I did not ask for the rewards.  I stated I was not able to login and play in the window of the event as designed due to what I *imagine* is a common holiday issue - traveling and spending time away from a computer.
---
&gt; I have 36 rorq pilots
---
CCPls see what you're doing to the game economy by allowing this
---
I might have the first really stupid question‚Äîwhere is the reconnect to lost drones button???
---
I agree, my inlaws are a very personal problem.
---
This week I dove into abyssal space. Now I think I have a gambling addiction. . . .This is why I don't gamble in real life. God damn these abyssal sites are fun. Already did a Tier 3 in an assault frigate with some buds. One of us almost died. Left the site with 600mil loot in total to split. 
---
As mining lasers can‚Äôt be stacked, forcing miners to go past F1, they are actually overqualified to be in most null sec fleets.
---

---
the bots die in droves because they expect local to work.
---
if you add a delay, they will just change the bots to deal with a delay in local.
---
11ish bil in liquid assets, some 30bil in hard assets. Many many years of running anomalies in sov null and doing PI. Seriously. PI is probably one of the more lucrative things you can do and it takes very little effort. I tried super ratting once, hated it. Doing that day in and day out without macros is a quick way to get carpel tunnel.
---
Capitals are a problem. Your issues with capitals are extremely misguided and secondary. You come from a background of large null fleets and the issues you see with capitals reflect it.
---
Carriers, supers and titans oppress subcaps not only in large weekend keepstar fights but on a daily basis. You can check zkill to get an idea on the proportion of how much [carriers](https://zkillboard.com/group/547/), [supers](https://zkillboard.com/group/659/) and [titans](https://zkillboard.com/group/30/) are used in daily pvp rather than your structured minimum 200 vs 200 fleets. Daily places where these ships are used is when a super/carrier tackled during ratting. Or when they are used as a capital umbrella to defend ratters. Or when people gatecamp with fighters and boson titans. Guess what. Everything on your list except bosons is pretty much irrelevant to daily pvp. 
---
If there was a nullbear plot to misdirect people's anticapital sentiments toward totally useless solutions your post would be it.
---
You wanna address the capital balance issue? 
---
Begin by severely buffing offensive cyno inhibition. Continue by nerfing fighters to what drones were capable before the citadel patch. Fighter mechanics are fun and interesting, but nobody asked for the buffs they received. Bosons still need to be addressed. Then make fighters jammable again. GTFO etc are completely irrelevant to main problems. Frankly you're the only person I've seen whining about GTFO.
---
you don't need to get to item redemption, all you had to do was launch the client from the launcher then press the big "give me free shit button" on the char select screen.
---
&gt;Any bot will just switch to dscan monitoring
---
Have you heard the word of your lord and savior the Lachesis?
---
Make all regions not directly connected to NPC space perma cyno jammed with full focus on subcapitals - aka no capital gate travel possible.          
---
Make all FW space cynojammed. 
---
nah, you're not convincing me
---
you want hunting in nullsec to be easier, don't sugarcoat it with a bunch of unrelated bullshit about bots
---
bots are ccp's job, not the job of players
---
Alright, before this gets burried, I'll bite: 
---
I generally agree with your sentiment of imbalance, and that eve needs constant iteration. Sure, everyone can get behind that. 
---
  However I don't understand neither the format you're using to bring up these issues nor the choice of issues themselves. 
---
Format: Why use twitch? If you use twitch, why stream it on your channel instead of a neutrally moderated one? While I'm not saying that myself, but it makes it easy to dismiss you as just another twitch viewer hoe. Videos are also such a bad discussion medium in terms of readablility and record. It's annoying as fuck to seep through dozens of VODs to re-watch that one argument. 
---
Second, the issues. I'm mostly going to refer to Jebsar's post in the other thread because he summed it up best: Why do you focus on the least grievous, very specific issues that currently plague the game? And of those, why only the ones that have been successfully used against you? I'm not saying those issues are not bad, but the way you present them is kind of laughable and easy to dismiss. GTFOs and Burst projectors might or might not be imbalanced, but the amount of impact they have on the whole of eve is tiny, while the much more pressing issue of the crippling ecomony you chose to completely ignore. Why? 
---
As a CEO I‚Äôm @ ~350B total assets/liquid after many years of playing. Including titans supers etc but some of the other CEO‚Äôs in my alliance really put me to shame. 
---
My members average 10-30B in assets + liquid, some being older players that are much higher. After 5-10 years in game collecting assets start to add up. A couple of my directors could buy me out twice. 
---
how tf can sirens be op if they only point

---
Reddit name checks out
---
Ok, genuinely confused.  I do not have a laptop, and I was traveling, so I am not sure how I was supposed to accomplish the goal of login into the client.  
---
Regardless of that, my main point is that the idea of the event is cool, but placing it so squarely over a holiday weekend probably works against the goal of the event.   If you want to carrot people into logging in over a usually slump time, setting the rewards up to have an automatic fail condition for many users is sub-optimal.
---
I would love to see metric on it though.  
---
The panic module has made the biggest profound impact in reducing content and kills.
---
I am 100% ok with rorq mining and the ability to farm a shit ton of ore/ice, but it should not have a safety button.
---
I think rorqs already have a very good tank against roaming gangs that come to attack them and that's all they should have.
---
wish-able nor viable im afraid
---
It wouldn‚Äôt allow the miners to camp the beacon and defend the Rorqs?
---
The only downside I can find with a setup like this is if two clients are running, how do you know which window is from which client? But I suppose that using different HUD colors would alleviate that.
---
This is a really elaborate click bait, I do agree that there are issues to talk about regarding game balance (capitals in particular) and the future of the game, but you are so full of yourself it is becoming disgusting.
---
Downvote away, I don't give a fuck.
---
Nice Downvotes 
---
Next time I'll post anonymously
---
remove rorqs
---
BRO IT'S THOSE SIRENS BRO
---
PLEASE IGNORE THE SHITTY PANIC RORQUALS IT'S THOSE GTFOS BRO, THAT'S WHAT IS KILLING THE GAME
---
wouldn't that make it Space War Bee ?
---
I agree with you about the perspective issues, but I think these are all either harmless or worthwhile changes. Who cares if he hates the GTFO? I think you'll be waiting a long time before you find a nullbloc FC that will want to gimp his own playstyle. Just need to get an actual whaling/Cx-Null person to present those kinds of ideas.
---
Goons turned it into world war reeee. 
---
I've seen that trend too - the person who made this pulled it from a fascist website, and re-purposed it.
---
Why does one do this? Like as not - because he too, is a fascist, the kind your grand-daddy shot.
---
I haven't been able to play except slightly (2 hours) on weekends to maybe mine a bit and reset my PI.  I love my corp/alliance/coalition mates!  I appreciate all my enemies and people in space.  I hope to be back soon but real likfe is really hitting hard at the moment.  From my job to health issues its hard but you eve bros make it worth it!  
---
Yup, has a good ring to it. Casino wars just sounds to lame. 
---
You don‚Äôt need to guess now Eve tells you on the character profile!
---
n00b question.. how do you get separate windows like that?
---
You could have very well explained things in detail here instead of redirecting people to a stream mate.
---
And despite that, next time you have something controversial to talk about (this one is pretty evident and I don't argue with your basic proposals btw) you should do so. That wat you'll know if your idea has merit on itself or is just upvoted because you are a great FC of a massive alliance.
---
Probably after draining them of SP and moving on to try this scam on someone else.
---
imagine being mad at a computer program
---
About time.... 
---
do you use google chrome?
---
if so, log in from your phone.
---
Randomly generated and look like actual players, would not be hard to do.
---
I understand your first point, but people aren't going to read a book about game balance, that's just my opinion.  And I disagree with your second point, there are a million CCPLZ posts on here every month.
---
I guess part of my thought was that it would cause a mining fleet to have an active presence on grid, not just logged off waiting for a ping and a cyno. 
---
"What difficulty you wanna play EVE at?  
---
\-Suicidal  
---
\-Nightmare  
---
\-Hard  
---
\-Medium  
---
\-Easy  
---
\-Kindergarden  
---
\-Kindergarden with training wheels  
---
\-Goon"  
---
You'll probably just dismiss this as well, but no, don't do it anonymously. People know and respect your capabilities as an FC. You have a crazy amount of experience, and it's okay to use that. But honestly, the way you presented this generally decent sentiment in the last few days is just so contra productive that you'll only get input from your own group, because everyone else can't really take the whole thing seriously anymore. Which is really a shame. 
---
And take back the mined minerals and subsequent assets built with them.
---
Right click your capacitor. 
---
Literally the only thing I care about. Launch groups is fine, whatever, but it'll be a colossal pain in the ass if the result of pushing a launch group button is 8 clients that all say "Incompatible:build" and have to be closed individually. 
---
Imagine being querns.
---
Well, I would totally read that book tbh 
---
And to the second part: most of those posts get downvoted because they are both retarded and signed by some random EVE player. Posting your ideas anonimously would eliminate the "popularity" factor.
---
We abuse all of those mechanics I'm complaining about too.  I just personally think that you should be able to roam under someone's supercap umbrella more easily than is currently possible.
---
It's not that I'm incapable of countering these mechanics, I've never lost a fleet to a boson, I just think it should be easier for lesser groups and younger FCs to generate content, rather than having all the content created by the same 10-15 people in this game.
---
Many do -- it's called "fantasizing." 
---
eh it is what it is.  I'm aware the timing is poor, but I didn't feel like waiting.
---
Been there, done that. Looking forward to the next one.
---
No I agree. His proposals are harmless in themselves. It's just they'll gain traction due to his null empire FC status. Then if CCP made them live, they'll forget about capital balance for another 5 years. And when we ask for actual balance, mega empire people will tell us that we have just received it. All these are incredibly harmful actually.
---
Or I'm just bored at work and already read all the new threads :-(
---
YES
---
THANK YOU
---
FUCK ECS
---
I disagree in some way. Killing rorqs is honestly kinda boring, I want a response fleet to come. I would rather there be a timer of say 5min when you know the rorq is fucked if they don't respond and it exits panic, rather than the current mechanic of it being able to tank 40-80k DPS, relatively neut immune and the Panic feel irrelevant. 
---
Yes and no. It takes a Titan for example at 0 isk value. And it doesn't take I to account  fittings on ships. 
---
More like "you killed someone's injector alt that decided to go troll some reddit tryhards :D
---
Other fun things to try: smartbombing in a pipe system, preferably in a Machariel, cloaky smartbomb t3s (hyperspat proteii outwarp pods and noobships and can fit combat scanner), camping lowsec relic/data sites in cloaky bombers/asteros and killing explorers.
---
idk, i don't
---
agree that the suggested changes would be good and are generally accepted by the community as ive seen it. we indeed do have more issues than this low hanging fruit though. Addressing botting in anoms cannot be overlooked. perhaps just an extreme reduction in respawn plus a interactive/dynamic interaction to increase the spawn rate once more (think captcha) could help. Add in some non-droppable lowsec content/insentive and maybe we are getting somewhere healthy. I always thought an increase in Mordu Legion sites in lowsec could accomplish this. As far as PGL though, beyond the few suggested changes, the rest of this is pretty loose bs. Just a collection of partially true but vague and under considered statements. ex: "The game is complex in a bad way" , true is some ways, not true in others, amounts to just being a bs nothing statement, maybe designed that way? but most the statements in there are along those lines.

&gt;Subcapitals are the lifeblood of this game. This is not to say that they should be invulnerable to capitals like they were at one point earlier this decade. Capital ships and capital battles are amazing, and they are what gives this game the depth that really sets it apart from everything else on the market. EVE would not be EVE without capital warfare. But subcapitals are what drives daily content. There simply can not be daily capital battles, basic game theory just doesn‚Äôt allow for it. Daily content needs to be low stakes, and subcapitals are where low stakes lives.
---
counterpoint: without being able to fight subcapitals, there's legitimately zero reason to have capital ships in the game. if you can't use them against subs, and all important structures have damage caps that you don't need caps to meet, why bother having caps other than suitcases, bridging titans and krab supers?
---
&gt;Remove GTFOs and all Burst Projectors: These simply do not need to exist
---
GTFOs get used so rarely that they're barely an issue at all, and burst projectors (except maybe the neut burst) are so underpowered it hurts
---
&gt;Remove HAWs from Titans: HAWs are balanced on Dreads, but OP on Titans
---
sounds like a you problem
---
&gt;Increase Boson Spool up time: It‚Äôs not that Bosons are bad, it‚Äôs that they limit Subcap doctrine choices considerably. 
---
this smells like "help i can't stop getting owned by this legitimate viable in-game tactic ccp please nerf it out of existence"
---
exactly how far up your ass does mittani have to put his hand before he starts making your mouth move for you?
---
in summation: fuck outta here
---
that's such dumb surface level knee jerk thinking it's unbelievable
---
rorquals wouldn't be in the belts in the first place if they didn't have the panic button, because the risk:reward would not justify it. you're not going to magically get more rorqual kills by removing panic - you will in fact probably see less content and thus kills overall, even if your kill ratio on tackled rorquals went up
---
With the MWD cooldown they are actually pretty easy to get away from if you have MWDs yourself. Let alone shooting, scramming, webbing, jamming them.

Is it possible to save a layout to be re-applied later.

For instance setup a layout for rorq mining and lock it into place such that when I inevitably get dropped and panic move all my windows around I can go back to it.

I want to say it.

CCP released a parent with this information on it I believe, or maybe it was for corps. No idea where it is now.
---
TWO!
---
yeah, i think i never did that... i just dont want to rely on those plex prices  or on being in some shitty nullsec alliance just for the plex... you waste so much time and time is money :D
---
I honestly cant name a single battle that titan haws actually mattered other then ones where a subcap fleet was so fucked sideways any weapon system would have worked.
---
Being able to quickly kill Rorqs would remove response fleets, but it would have a ludicrously good effect on overall balance of everything that it's simply worth it.
---
I completly agree. With 0 effort too.

Considering this is a no question is stupid...
---
How comes I‚Äôm so bad at this game ? I just can‚Äôt do it.
---
Two characters, 2 accounts (both subbed) been playing on and off since 2010, 
---
one char is Indy based ~27M s.p also flies a noctis for mission salvaging. Full exhumer pilot and maxed highsec ore repro.
---
The other ~21m s.p is my lvl 4 mission runner (machariel), also flies an orca for mining support (my bro also comes mining if we‚Äôre chilling and chatting)
---
Highsec carebear. Yadda yadda.
---
I‚Äôve lost 5 ships this year, 1 Mach, and a wolf on #2, 
---
2 Astero &amp; a Noctis for #1 (use the astero to do relic sites for blue rig components &amp; research stuff)
---
Seems like which ever way I turn, I end up fucking it up and costing myself a fortune.
---
I really love playing the game but I just seem to keep doing dumbshit. 
---
Could it be that I just need to find a decent corp (I‚Äôm in one with my bro and that‚Äôs it - 4 characters between us) so I‚Äôm just not getting enough experience or is it actually possible for someone to just suck at this type of game ?
---
&gt;burst projectors (except maybe the neut burst) are so underpowered it hurts
---
i've literally only ever seen ecm projectors used on fortizars, everywhere else is bubble projectors(and maybe web projectors from cool vendetta dudes)
---
Only if they choose to die rather than adapt.

sorry op , your answer was not clear and that offended the TAPI downvote brigade. 
---
Ok I get it, bad timing.
---
The first round was coming across arctic light burning a null affiliated Corp, that doesn't mean much to me...However lack of hole control.and half assed fleet comps is what we went for, and got. What the gloating post of the OP is failing to mention is...this...
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/31000487/201901142000/
---
After this, they hole controlled properly and bothered to try a full eviction to save face and recover previous losses.
---
Hence the fessor fleet of which they may or may not called in an additional 40 man garmur fleet in addition to yhe 40 in the sieged hole, all for little old Sinner's to fight with...I'm flattered.
---
OP I don't care if you want to shit on me or my corp, but be a big boy and tell whole story next time.  ;)

&gt; I just personally think that you should be able to roam under someone's supercap umbrella more easily than is currently possible.

I was in Co2 up in Tribute for WWB, its aftermath ... then the Circle-of-Test times (TEST truly were best bros then).  We evac‚Äôd together down south and I ended up in Impass with Co2.
---
When The Judge f*d us over, went back north and joined up with MOA. Really good folk to fly with but, circumstances changed and as MOA disbanded, Co2 had reformed and I met up with them again in Fade and stayed till the end.
---
Overall, loved the fights, battles &amp; wars I got to participate in. We rarely didn‚Äôt take a fight and that‚Äôs always fun.
---
I think fighting against INIT was about as good as it got, very good fights, tough and capable opponents and a classy group in local.

Can't agree enough with this, these really are the central issues (although I will say that I suspect the GTFO is one of the least fun mechanics to endure, especially in tidi).

---
dreads could use a buff vs citadels. so they can be siege ships again.
---
not sure how without making them to powerful vs caps though &lt;.&lt;
---
maybe being in siege makes them ignore dmg cap, or at least ignore some of the dmg cap?  encourage content by locking dreads in siege mode on citadels. 
---
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies,  (Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)

You‚Äôve *only lost five ships this year*?!
---
It seems like your real issue is that you‚Äôre using expensive faction battleships (and frigates) which are painful to lose... thus I am guessing that you are making all your ISK in hisec, from mining?

It's a decent idea, but bubblefucking the gate will slow them down considerably as hunters. Plus, you can drop a raitaru off the gate and run a spotter alpha bot tethered in a pod whose only job is to relay overview info to the hive.
---
*procurer double webs and scram as he lights a cyno
---
I see you point for a response fleet but do you wait for a response fleet from goonswarm, or legacy when their main response is a capital fleet drop? Killing a rorq may be boring but it is still a kill. 
---
Dropping the panic module could still allow you to wait for a response fleet by just holding the rorq there - or maybe the entity considers it dead and won't respond. 
---
At the very least i would advocate for an adjustment of what panic does.
---
we all saw the PCU when local broke for like 2 days straight.
---
it's pretty obvious they won't delete it.
---
They need to introduce paid pve protection flags wtf is this griefing????
---
See, and this comment, in my opinion, shows so much that you actually didn't get it at all, at least not what I was trying to say. 
---
I'm not good at this reddit thing, but I just want to suggest you to maybe just *listen* a bit more and don't just instantly dismiss other people. 
---
Saying the timing was wrong just shows that you're not up for debate, but you're blaming the bad reception on the timing instead of the content. And you'll probably dismiss this as well as I'm just another armchair developer, but maybe you'll at least take Jebsar's comment a bit more serious. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Yeah I can imagine gtfo being an issue. I am unfamiliar to it in a similar way to how Pgl is unfamiliar with actual issues with capitals.
---
Fax still need a nerf to capacitor, IE balance 3200s. It's silly that even shield fax just has 1 Cap booster and nothing in the lows or rigs. This would actually add some thought into their fittings between tank and remote reps.
---
The Ferox is too strong.
---
Armor plates are to allow you to survive volleys or to last slightly longer. On citadels neither of these are applicable because of damage caps removing alpha and forcing a 30min grind. What an insulting addition to the game were they on citadel armor timers, they only exist to make people dislike the game enough to maybe not bother coming next time.
---
Cyno inhibs should be harder to kill, or have a short ~5min RF cycle so they are balanced in small fights and blobs.
---
Boson spool up timer is fine, Tri are just shit. Instead it should do less damage for longer so you can move away from the DPS but they still have maybe a cool place in killing caps.
---
As a former ASCEE member, I was expecting this.
---
Kick ASCEE.
---
TIMMEH
---
This pretty much.  It didn't matter.  I had two dreads on grid, running the optimal range scripts early was just a way for me to make sure I didn't activate them late or forget to turn them on for the counter drop.
---
well honestly, the last two weeks local was really stable. even in a fleet i had this week the chat was stable with 500 players spamming in local.
---
did anyone witness hickups, these few days? 
---
if not, they might actually have managed to stabilize it
---
There's a vote going on, in my discord server between **Warframe**, **Star Citizen** and **EVE Online.**

I am up for the debate, but it's going to be muddled by too many other things it seems, that's all I'm saying.
---
I would prefer other ways of reducing the effectiveness of rorq mining, especially multiple at once.
---
However, I'm making another version with excavations for you guys
---
Man, PGL. I gotta admit. This is a good thing you're doing. I can't stand Nullsec, I hate how safe your space is, and I think the playstyle model that test and goons have adopted is killing the game that we all love.
---
But.
---
Good on you for trying to save it. Keep fighting brother. Eve needs this.
---
Also delet panic, kthx.
---
You must not know progod very well. He's always on the cusp of a new doctrine, or campaign, or strategy. You just have to turn up next weekend for it's launch.

that's fine :)

Next time read that description before you say anything. 
---
Remove capitals.
---
OK maybe keep carriers.
---
Neut bursts are great for damage application on subs because it turns off any combination of prop mods, tank, guns for a portion of a fleet. It can effect many doctrines but they are also quite avoidable.

Yes dromis are way worse. The reason subcap webs aren't OP is because they come from a relatively static target and have limited range. But dromis can be anywhere and pick off any pilot from the anchor, from any direction and they don't ever get out of range because obviously they web.

I still remember when the CFC became ass blasted because no one consulted them on the added character backgrounds. So they demanded a second background to represent the CFC forces.

They are such basic bitches.

Exactly!  Before skill injectors, you could just buy PLEX or GTCs, sell them for ISK (which has always been allowed) and then buy characters with the skills you wanted.

You get like 3h of skill training towards that race. Go for look unless you have a strong RP based preference.
---
Nah 3 toon rock haven
---
nice reddit input broadcasting
---
Soooo, TEST = Nulli now.
---
Sorted.
---
I'm worried that without panic they have to give it good tank. Which is worse IMO because it means they are untouchable without some very niche comp that can't fight a response, or 75 guys plus.
---
I understand it wouldn't effect TEST or Goons, but I would rather a cap response fleet just isn't able to wipe a fleet without subs tbh
---
Let's divert the attention to some utterly unimportant fact no one gives a shit about.
---
I think that was one of the removed subsystems.

A handful of smartbomb BS parked at the deadspace pocket's landing spot would shred small, nimble gangs effortlessly.

---
TEST are you okay with this? 
---
Amen my friend.
---
Good point, I guess there would have to be a mechanic that disallowed smartbombing within a certain distance.
---
Titan HAWs completely ruin small scale subcap PVP because they literally kill any ship in the meta within 100km in &lt;10 seconds. It's not a major battle thing, it's a general game thing - Titans already serve a purpose as big battle railgun thingies, they don't also need to deal 8k DPS to subs.

Capital ships and capital battles are amazing, and they are what gives this game the depth that really sets it apart from everything else on the market. EVE would not be EVE without capital warfare.

Plexed my 2 accs for 140‚Ç¨ both for an half year . Sometimes i do Pve and get like 2-3 bil for Pvp ships but im a lazy fool :P But thats enough for me dont want to grind Isk for playing the game . 
---
I See it more like a Hobby for me 
---
&gt; GTFOs get used so rarely that they're barely an issue at all
---
Wouldn't really consider that a reason for them to exist, since they're basically just weaponized disconnects.
---
You realize this is exactly the salt they are trying to extract right?
---
They don't get used often because people don't field doctrines that would be vulnerable to them.  It was learned in the Tribute war two years ago that if you don't have capital superiority then you can't use slow moving short range fleets because you risk losing the entire thing to a well placed super/titan drop.
---
CO2 had to lose 2 or 3 entire T3 fleets before that lesson became clear.  FRT lose a few full TFI fleets to us as well.  These game mechanics limit doctrine choices, which limit what counters can be used and make it harder to engage.  I'm all about giving people the option to engage and disengage because it encourages more attempts at content.
---
Im very sorry if your 100km nanogang cant deal with a ship that has half the tracking of a battleship.
---
Surely removing defender launchers would do the same thing, no? Or did you mean something else there. 
---
But then where do I shit talk my enemies? :(
---

---
I have faith in CCP that they can definitely fuck this up 
---
You guys are really biting hard on that particular troll post. Well done Vily.
---
I was trying to make a joke about the fact that there where only 2 major alliances starting with a N, but they called themselves N3 anyway because that sounded cooler.
---
You can't call Panfam N3 because its something completely different. N3 was NC. and Nulli Secunda + pets. That group is simply no longer a thing. PanFam is headed by PL and PH and it has NC. tagging allong as a backing-vocal.
---
The CFC on the other hand was rebranded as "the Imperium" on a whim. There was no major sov-loss, no change in the structure of the coalition, there wheren't even any changes in its member-alliances. It's just Mittens who decided to change the name one day. Thats it.
---
CFC and The imperium are the same thing.

Your caps aren't balanced comrade.

---
They dont deal 8k dps to subs titan has have less then 3k dps at super close range with Literally half a battleships tracking.
---
?? defender launchers keep subcap fleets alive.  No this is what I mean, lets look at Delve for example.  If you take a 100 person fleet of anything larger than frigates, you have to be extremely careful about even getting tackled for a moment.  If you spend too long in a bubble, even in fast moving ships, the super and titan blob can come down on you and do a lot of force multiplying projections that wipe your fleet way too fast in my opinion.  You literally have to always be ready to warp out at a moment's notice, this was never the case under the old capital meta, even for a moment.
---
I'm capable of dodging these things, and some other FCs are too, but it's a lot of effort to do that daily, and it really limits who can FC lots of the available content.  You shouldn't have to risk losing 100 billion isk in subcaps for even the most minor mistake.  I just think I should be able to have caps dropped 60km off of me, and still be able to get away in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't think I should be able to beat them, but I shouldn't be immediately pinned by Vendetta web projections and Burst Neuts and Meme bubbles and potentially GTFOs.  I mean every single fleet we field now has at least 100km engagement range just to make sure we're always capable of getting away from that shit.  It's very limiting to content, that's all.
---
Looks to me like its being redesigned to provide better botting / multiboxing support. I mean, why would we want to limit bot auto login options ? Why would we want to limit botlike multiboxer options ? the game is obviously balanced and in the name of sandbox these do not cause any issues whatsoever .....
---
/s
---
Progod for the life of me I don‚Äôt understand you sometimes dude.
---
You say you are open to discussion on the topic. But then you ask your alliance to brigade upvote you to lend a false sense of credibility to your post (after all if it‚Äôs getting upvoted, people must believe it right?).
---
It would have been an infinitely better platform to open debate on a thread for discussion on the EVE forums and instead ask your supporters to go there and offer their opinions on the topic, rather than blind hysterical agreement via upvotes.
---
Wasted opportunity my friend.
---
They don't have to block alliance, corp or any channel that is player made where players can set their own rules as what and when to block or limit. Just CCP premade channels like local etc.
---
maybe a little overwrought but fundamentally worthwhile perspective on meta and how it relates to this game
---
something that separates EVE from most competitive "esports" games is that your own performance and playstyle at an individual level have virtually no impact on others
---
unless you're in a small gang, but small gangs tend to naturally form around common personality types, where in LoL you can be randomly matched with anyone
---
no matter what, in EVE, this stuff remains purely subjective. in a similar but entirely independent culture of fighting games (SF, Mortal Kombat, etc), they have concepts such as "tier whore" or "low tier hero", and routinely celebrate players who are able to win at a high level while using characters which are unanimously regarded as weak, and diminishing the achievements of players who win with "top tier" characters who are regarded as strong.
---
I think this perspective has more weight in EVE... even on this subreddit, we root for the soloist... the Leshak gang that takes on a horde of carriers with FAX support, etc... there's glory with winning against unbeatable odds, and a hearty "who gives a fuck" if you oppress inferior forces with unlimited wealth
---
Fucking Veganholes

But botting is not playing.
---
&gt;small scale subcap PVP
---
I think carriers and supercarriers are worse offenders there
---
OP get wrekt
---
From a magic the gathering perspective, often the most functional play groups have a mix of all three. In particular, Johnny tends to be less afraid of innovation (and accompanying losing) than spikes and often lead the meta. Timmys tend to make better recruiters of new players because their gratification is most relatable to a new player. What I agree completely on is that there needs to be mutual respect in a group between the styles. Teamwork and motivation benefits highly when a spike FC runs a gate camp or you let Johnny pick the comp for a strategic objective. If you have each other's backs, these are what create the most exciting (think Rooks and Kings stories) experiences. 
---
Most people are a mix, though. The most important thing is mutual respect for playstyles and any mix can work in theory.
---
It's online at the moment.
---
grinded a truly autistic amount of isk in high sec. goes to null "gets bored". sounds like you did null wrong
---
I'm just bothered by "timmy", cause it sounds like a child's name, and in turn you're calling a whole player archetype children.
---
You're not wrong.  Clearly I fuck up sometimes.
---
Why not both?
---
Mate the cost of an outpost far exceeds one of a fortizar nowadays. make it so only the faction fortizar are the ones who share this, strip the keepstars from it, also get rd of dmg caps, rework fighters so less lag and more sub captail game play s used and call it a day.
---
If you own things that are not on the regional market in your space, the profile is 100% incorrect.

TLDR: no, you cannot use the profile.
---
i appreciate that i can kill every single one of you if you undock. in the nicest of ways.
---
What's the fit?
---
Good? That's kind of what I want my launcher space to be used for.
---
&gt; I'm worried that without panic they have to give it good tank
---
It's kinda already the case??? You either take niche setup (like bombers duh), or just lot of ppl, even now when they killed triple asb memes. They already got good tank AND a fucking invul button.
---
That makes sense, I was more confused about this, since you mentioned limiting doctrine choice (which would be an effect of removing defender launchers). Not sure if it‚Äôs just confusion with wording.
---
‚Äú[Increasing boson spool up time] can‚Äôt happen without other changes like potentially removing defender launchers.‚Äù
---
That aside, how do you feel about supers/titan *other* than ability to get away from them? Things like fighter dps application to subs, or the strength of any caps sitting on a fort, etc. Those are issues that are brought up often, but instead you‚Äôre talking about niche things like the GTFO and Vendetta web burst. 
---
Why not address anything other than subcaps being able to get away from/avoid supers?

This is a disappointingly centrist and moderate position. Imma have to put up my own manifesto later. 
---
I feel like all that stuff is so complicated and so contentious that it would be way too hard to hammer out a meaningful solution CCP would actually go for.  I just wanted to build some consensus on a little thing I believe in, which is just getting more fleets out there in space shooting things.  Giving those fleets added ability to run away means that FCs will be able to take more risks, which leads to more content.  Like I'm totally capable of sitting on our rorquals with our titan fleet and racing for the most titans, but I hate playing the game like that.  I think if we got more big subcap fights going, the rest of the stuff would be easier to work out, but to do that we have to give subcaps a fighting chance.
---
We talk about this a lot internally, but clearly I picked a bad way to go about bringing this public.  
---
A big company might look further than a 2 day timestamp.  
---
I'm not saying they will, just that they might.
---
I would agree with you if rorquals weren't already the tankiest ship in the game. I think it's totally unreasonable for a mining ship to be able to tank 150 bombers *and* have a 7 minute invulnerability button.
---
Cyno jammers could use a shorter anchor time, but cyno jammers don't help if you don't have hundreds of dudes to throw at the rorqual.

I have had a fantastic couple of weeks at work and not much going on with my Eve homies lately so I've been playing through Far Cry 5 which is fun. The fat-bottom redneck girl follower is the best and makes me laff. That woman mows shit down and has a great ammo capacity passive bonus. Dumb as a stone but she's funny.

you've got it the wrong way around; SMA were ferdinand and the Bee's were the main event.

---
8 years in game, 3 of active play - and as much as I'd love to settle down on one or few things, I get to be unlucky enough for something out of my control to change enough to render my found preferred playstyle not viable. I've got myself into solo blopsing - landscape change and player gathering large groups, shifted ratting landscape from rattles/nightmares/machs into VNI and caps. Start hunting caps? Even more grouping, big rental empires dead, public Keepstars dead, supers becoming unreasonably cheap. I wonder how long it'll take for next fun-for-me thing to become obsolete. Still having lots of fun despite that.
---
I only "own" work laptops, which I am not going to install Eve on.  So, at least one person.   I am probably part of a small population, admittedly.  All my personal laptops have died and given that I only travel for work or for family holidays, I see no need to buy a personal/gaming laptop for the 3 days a year I might want or have a need to use it.

Beyond that, is there a supported way of logging into Eve via phone, or are you talking about setting up some sort of remote access to do so?  I am genuinely interested in this.

I believe in them doing neither and fucking it up worse

I may have the story wrong, but the following is what I remember.
---
Early in the days of The Noble Exchange (Nex), now New Eden Store, CCP released a bunch of limited-edition clothing with large PLEX bundle purchases.
---
By large, I mean the $500 USD sort of area (I forget the exact amount, but it was the largest bundles).
---
Then, at I believe a FanFest, CCP handed-out coupons for some of the items.
---
The final straw was when CCP again issued some of the items as an in-game event reward.
---
The players called foul, and eventually CCP responded by issuing new never-before-released items, and swearing to never again release them.  They would be truly rare.
---
I can't remember the item name.   I think it was a brown-ish shirt that was the center of the revolt.
---
As an apology, CCP issued a ['Silvershore' Greatcoat](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=4245) to those that had purchased the PLEX bunndle.
---
There is one currently available in Jita for [only 49b](https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/type/4245/)
---
I paid 1b for mine years ago.  In retrospect, I wish I had purchased every single one on the market at the time.
---
Just like the monocle I have.
---

---
this is the best. why bother with this guy? was it for the salt?
---
U just explained eve in 5 words
---
The part that got me into this game is when I took someone for 100mil on an isk doubling scam back in like 2013. He hauled me into his teamspeak, gently explained that he was a special cybersecurity contractor for the FBI, told me my IP address and the name of my college, and said he'd publish my personal information on the internet - not that he would do anything about it, you know, but maybe some of my other scam victims would take a crack at me. Broken windows, mailbox knocked over, you know? But he wouldn't if I refunded him a billion isk right that minute. 
---
While he was doing this, he had two other dudes in the server saying things like "yeah this bro is a real scary dude, man, I wouldn't want to get on his bad side if I were you"
---
Genuinely the funniest thing I've ever experienced. Not having a recording of it is my single biggest regret in this game. 
---
We should call it World War America, because America financed a lot of it.
---
We should really have the Germans and Japanese name it though, because you definitely want the losers to name the war they lost.
---
Tri might be a bit laughable now, but historically they've been a factor to be considered. It's not like they SMA or something. 
---
IIRC, they can't switch nodes on the fly. If they could, they would probably have nodes migrated automatically when they hit a certain amount of TIDI for a certain period of time.
---
Also, do we know that it's not reinforced? Big battles in high and lowsec suck because crimewatch is a thing.
---
if you got money for killing people they wouldn't fight, they'd just suicide to each other and split the money. it's difficult to design a system that people won't just suck the fun out of
---
Only if you drop fully tank fit, and there's no real reason to do that against roaming gangs
---
So you got stuck in a wormhole for a year huh
---
They were nowhere to be found in Impass during the Test/CO2 war.
---
soon only bots will be able to afford plex
---
Haha ~true~
---
yeah, it would dc everyone in system
---
And Perimeter is probably reinforced today, big blocs are usually good at reporting these fights
---
Tbh, that's exactly posted a response in the first place. I'm just here to watch all the triggered post, either as response to me, or otherwise.  
---
I wasn't even playing when that war took place!
---
I would say winning at all costs also includes those frustrating fucks that, in small scale engagements, bring so much fucking logi. Kill me now, i can't count the times I've walked away from the game because of this bs.

2019 EVE in a nutshell - Obtain Omega characters, buy LOTS of injectors, inject Subcap, inject Rorqual, inject Dread, inject Carrier, inject Super, and inject Titan.

&gt; roam under someone's supercap umbrella
---
Roaming under someones supercap umbrella isn't hard. Killing something significant is under someones supercap umbrella is hard. All the changes you're proposing do is to make it slightly more likely for you to tackle something, provoke a response and not die if the defender isn't forming a bunch of subs to tackle you and you somehow still haven't adopted (like most people already have) boosh doctrines to just boosh out if shit gets hot or the use of bombers/cov ops based fleets.
---
&gt;I just think it should be easier for lesser groups and younger FCs to generate content
---
Again, nothing in your proposal applies here. Younger FCs and small (or "lesser") groups aren't suddenly going to be able to generate content under someones super umbrella just because they can't be bosoned, gtfo'd (which I've literally never seen used in any context outside of massive fleet fights) or be pointed by sirens. A truly small or "least" group can already not be killed by a HAW titan. Can they kill the HAW titan? No. Can it kill them? Not if they had any sense and brought logi. Can a lot of HAW titans kill them? Absolutely. But that is an issue with super caps umbrellas, not super caps. Your changes don't impact super umbrellas at all and don't offer any opportunity for small groups. Quite the opposite, smaller groups that are cap heavy and use those caps (or supercaps) to fight numerically superior opponents will have a harder time creating content.
---
This ties into my biggest problem with your proposed changes themselves. What they're doing is significantly nerfing the ability of supercaps to act as force multipliers in subcap engagements. 
---
Coincidentally, you're part of the coalition that is currently "suffering" (and especially historically has suffered) from supercaps used as force multipliers against subcaps. While that same coalition (along with its blues) has the ability to do two things: A) outform pretty much 75%-85% of 0.0 combined in subcaps and B) outform literally every single other coalition (or perma blue "mega"-coalitions) in terms of supercaps by a significant margin for an "apex battle"-type event. Curiously, your proposed changes make A) an even more significant factor and have 0 impact on B).
---
Additionally the biggest problems, propagation of supercaps, "density" of super cap umbrellas and the means to aquire those(namely rorqs and skill injectors) don't even get a passing mention in your concerns on "how to fix eve".
---

I have grinded Plex out, and it's a chore. I like to buy a subscription just to support CCP and hopefully they won't turn off the servers.

&gt; they literally kill any ship in the meta within 100km in &lt;10 seconds
---
Are you flying polarized catalysts w/o propmod and have an aversion to transversal or something?
---
&gt;they don't also need to deal 8k DPS to subs.
---
Well they don't. Not even on said still sitting, polarized catalyst. 
---
Lol wut, how many accounts you running to do that, either that or you're non stop mining xD 
---
We don't "suffer" from supercaps.  We abuse them daily.  And once again, I'm not saying it's impossible to counter this stuff, I'm just saying the boxes that all this stuff forces you in are too limiting in my opinion.  Fighters would still rape subcaps, and so would dreads with HAWs.  Like these are pretty minor changes.
---

Also, perimeter is probably already on a reinforced node by default, just like Jita.
---
And that's shoving it down reddit's throat, heh.   
---
Your initial link contains posts from everyone's r/eve post using the word 'Casino War'. Seems a bit dishonest to then be like 'oh no you're wrong, because here's four posts I pulled out of th hat'. look!  I appreciate you whittling it down, though. 
---
If I understood the blog post correctly then yes, you don't have to restart the launcher.
---
What about your spouse? I have Eve on my work laptop, no one cares as long as I get my work done/don't play on work time.
---
no it's nullsec's retarded children taking their war to hisec

The amount of salt everytime GOONS and TEST are on grid together is worth everything, so yes I am okay with this

And while we're at it, let's funnel everyone with a particular preferred play-style into an ever smaller pool of viable hulls.

They're also not all explicitly from a goon either. Without whipping out a spreadsheet, I'd say it's about 1/3 each MBC, Imperium, and neutral posts.  
---
IF we were being honest and not just sitting in one more shit talking reddit thread (lets be honest, it's just a flame thread more often than not) you'd have to go through that wall of posts and actually break them down by their slant.   
---
But no one is doing that because this is a shit talking thread.
---
&gt;big blocs are usually good at reporting these fights
---
At the same time, since this is a multi-alliance thing, each of them might have been on a 'we will form if they form' kinda policy. 
---
If you're in low sec, stick with a covetor, it's a tenth of the price of a hulk and better than a skiff for mining speed. Fit some upgrades, t2 strips n crystals, survey scanner, drone mining rig, cpu rig if u need it. You will get shot at some point - someone will notice you. 
---
Keep in mind Richter Enderas was the galaxybrain that brought us this post:
---
&gt;If at any given moment, N3 ping for all hands on dick supercarriers and capital ships, they will get more individual people in fleet than your entire coalition can combined on its very best day.
---
&gt;This isn't conjecture, this is something that has been proven again and again because your leaders like to bury their heads in the sand and ignore the game itself in favor of posting and posturing and writing tl;dr CEO updates about garbage that will never see the light of day (and if it does, the only place it will be is on the killboard of my alliance) instead of realizing that every capital and supercapital pilot with a pulse and a will to use their dread/super/titan/slowcat is gravitating towards one side because hey, guess what, that side actually DOES use their big toys on the regular and when push comes to shove as evidenced by the fight in DY- your alliance is literally impotent.
---
&gt;If a super 'fight' actually happens, it isn't going to be an actual fight, it is going to be a CFC gangrape hosted by Manny, Grath and Vince and you'll have no one to blame but your own leaders and FCs for being yes men faggots instead of growing a pair of balls and equipping some initiative.

Nope, her laptop (the most expensive one we own, fml) is essentially a brick and we joke that it's only good as a space heater.

We are more likely to build me a new PC and give her mine than buy a laptop at this point.

&gt; We don't "suffer" from supercaps. We abuse them daily.
---
I don't wanna fight about that point, let's just settle on "have historically suffered from it".
---
&gt;And once again, I'm not saying it's impossible to counter this stuff, I'm just saying the boxes that all this stuff forces you in are too limiting in my opinion.
---
But your changes don't help with that. You're not limiting their power to stop small gangs at all. You're giving the small group a slightly better chance to get away, but not to actually accomplish something on their roam.
---
&gt;Fighters would still rape subcaps, and so would dreads with HAWs. Like these are pretty minor changes.
---
Hence these changes not helping small groups at all. A truly small gang can't deal with 10 haw dreads or 10 carriers anymore than they can deal with 2 haw titans.

I actually set that Chrome Remote up specifically before I left, to try and use my work laptop to access my home computer.  Fucking windows update decided to run sometime between wheels up and when I got around to trying to remote in a few days later over Christmas.  Was annoying as fuck.  I obviously blocked the whole experience from my memory until you spelled it out for me on the chalkboard.
---
Around 30mil avg, 40mil on Gneiss, Spod, Arkonor, Crokite and/or moon ores such as special Coesite and Sylvite. Bitumens and Zeolites are useless atm, as is Omber. Low ends usually around 20mil
---
Name checks out. You must be great at parties!
---
I mean, they've called it Casino War as well, in the past. Like it's a disputed name or something, and individual folks in CCP might have different opinions on each name.
---
&gt; they'd just suicide to each other and split the money. 
---
Only if someone made the payout for killing a hull more than the hull cost. Which no one would because that'd be asinine.

shooting neutral links is always a good idea right? Its not like goons have a bad history with game mechanics or something
---
Yep, I'm right there with you.  I've docked fleets up before because of this.  I'm fine with taking a fight outnumbered and outlogied but only to a certain extent.  If i'm in 9 vexor and 3 augs and someone brings 15 naugs and 4 guardians (looking at you galmil), there's really no point in even bothering unless you can do something cheeky like boosh them off the warpin at a medium fw complex.

---
Wrong.  If they have just warped to site or are in the process of doing so they are not aligned. If they are npc hic pointed alignment doesn't matter. If they have to actually play a game that's not "instantly kill these red Xs for money without thinking" they probably wouldn't be aligned. 
---
Reason bots are so rampant is because this game's pve, whether it be npc couriers or super ratting, is too easy and requires no human decision making. 
---
Couriers should always bring you through low sec and have increased rewards so people who can defend the mission pipeline or use a dst can profit but bots can't because they'll get 23/7 destroyed by pirates. All ratting in any space should leave you vulnerable through tanked npc points. Just adjust their sigs or give them damage reduction vs fighters so it takes a battleship the same time to kill them as a super so they aren't impeding normal gameplay too much. Think buffed spider drone iis. Higher payout sites should have anti fighter destroyers that have the same damage reduction and need to be played around not just brainlessly telling your fighters to attack.
---
Wrong.
---
Calling NCdot 'technically band of Brothers' is like calling it technically black legion or technically giantsbane.
---
NCdot is ACTUALLY technically Triumvirate, since it was founded as another Tri iteration by the core corps of the old Tri, who had a huge rivalry with the old Northern Coalition. Then they picked up a lot of l33t corps from failed/failing alliances, mostly from the South and West after they got hit with the DRF/NC hammer. Eventually they picked up some BoB corps, but Evol and Finfleet sort of keep their heads down and do their own thing, the old leadership doesn't get involved with EVE in any real capacity anymore. RKK and BNC scattered to the winds. So you're calling them BoB based on DICE, who wasn't even a founding BoB corp, +2 relatively inactive and autonomous corps, of which only one was really OG.
---
There are more Morsus Mihi and S2N corps and figures active in NCdot than anything else.

My monthly cost has been the same for years :P It really is a relief to just pay the $15 a month, or cheaper if you bulk buy sub, and just focus on the game. Not grinding away. Some people like the grind though. That's cool. The game has to have them or it doesn't work. Just go work an extra hour or 2 each month and BAM! You're worries about grinding 1.9B isk are gone and you can use that for other fun things. Like frigates and ships to to just go whelp and get an adrenaline rush.
---
Just for the record: Perimeter was NOT on a reinforced node today, it shared a node with 2 other systems. Unfortunately nobody found it worth to send a request.
---
PLEASE: Send reinforcement requests \~24h earlier, if you expect a huge fight. We in CCP do not know in most cases, when you are planning a big fight. We really need your help for this! Thanks! :)

Normally I would agree.  That computer however randomly loses power even when plugged in, randomly restarts, does not operate without being plugged in, and takes about 10-20 minutes to boot up and have mouse response.  Last time she tried to use it to check email, chrome hang for about 10 minutes and we gave up.  It is more useful as toaster oven than as a computer.  
---
As someone who works with too many bad corporate systems, I have to say her computer is literally the least functional computer I have ever tried to use.  At least the kernel-panic-on-boot Mac Air has the decency to fail within the first 15-30 seconds.  This one tempts you like a siren, only to leave you cold and shivering, without the good grace to even drag you into the depths and drown you.

Imagine logging into eve every day to make isk to pay your virtual $11/m sub
---
I know.

For what it‚Äôs worth the Gallente T2 Ewar bonus is point range while minmatar T2 bonused ewar are webifiers, hence why Sirens point and Dromis web. You might be getting mixed up with Serpentis bonuses, which derive web strength from Minmatar ship level.
---
Exactly what we need!
---
wtf thats my karma
---
CItadel safety is always green, so he cant shoot a nonwar target
---
I guess making it optional fixes that.... so, I'm guessing CCP will make it mandatory if implemented.
---
You guys in Panfam just don't get it . The goons don't show up to help TEST , they are there .....just to kill you .
---
Stomped? What happened to GF? 
---
Lol alliance bat phones versus coalition bat phones. Either way it was fun fight
---
A couple of days ago we went to Fountain. A HAW Molok killed several bombers with AB on, going 800+m/s with links on at 120+ km range. It's unbelievably stupid. I agree with everything you say here and more. PLS CCP DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
---
and spike is a dog's name, but alas, they're just names
---
I'm so thankful that I found my kind of crew so early on in the game. I actually have been elsewhere like 2-3 times after joining TEST, once because I couldnt care less about Vale of the Silent and didnt feel like fighting over it e.g., but alway came because it never felt like home like it does where I am now and have been for years.
---
It can go both ways tho, a good friend of mine, who actually introduced me to the game, really started to dive into the game with a minor sattelite alliance of Atlas Alliance. When they imploded so did his alliance, he looked for a new place for some time but eventually just quit. EVE is weird.
---
Not our fault you guys drove away all of your potential allies over the last few years.  Including us.

c'mon.
---
Did you forget about cap injectors?
---
You are truly the smoothest boy
---
If only they had anchored it one system over ü§ò
---
\&gt;im civilized
---
yeah we see that
---
what I meant is that gallente fighters and drones are the slowest in the game, but sirens are still pretty fast, which I find odd
---
stop trying to find my stuff
---
You want all your assets taken away?
---
To clear up all the retardation on this post because there's a lot of misconceptions, here's some history.
---
N3 was built around the core of Northern Coalition., Nulli Secunda, and Nexus Fleet. They also had a lot of support alliances at various points like The Kadeshi, Darkness, Pangu Coalition (see: Fraternity), etc.
---
N3PL came about through NC and PL's ties in the past as former DRF mercenaries and similar play styles+good cohesion. They decided to team up to pick apart the old DRF, something we haven't seen happen ever again by their former mercenaries, totally.
---
Not sure how N3/N3PL dissolved, but I know Nulli died when it started letting in a bunch of trash like LNAW, alienating the core S2N players who all went to Test or NCdot. Brain drain+getting helldunked by PL caused them to close shop.
---
PanFam was originally just PL/PH, with close ties to NCdot. NCdot eventually folded Northern Army (their equivalent to PH) and officially joined PanFam. MC joined a little while later, after WWB.
---
CFC rebranded to Imperiun prior to any major changes to the coalition, the whole rebrand was to make themselves sound cooler in the Fountain war book. Also unlike N3, where a lot of groups straight up left, the former CFC entities by and large just got Bastion'd or absorbed into Goons proper, so it's still the same groups, just assimilated under less banners.
---
I don't think 1.8bil is that bad honestly. I can make 1bil a day in a few hours of super ratting then go do other things.
---
Before that I made 500m a day carrier ratting for a few hours.
---
Before that I made 500m a day afking two vni's and counter dropping hunters.
---
But 1.8bil for one hours work irl is still faster then what I can do, so I would never put people down for just paying for their sub. But it is no were close to being unpayable via isk.
---
Death to krabs.
---
Upon taking a second look at your edit this is indeed what you meant
---
Also this makes a lot of sense. Too much sense.
---
 Why tho
---
I‚Äôm unusually satisfied that you‚Äôve jumped to suggesting that I have an issue with mittens rather than reading what I wrote. Reading comprehension is difficult when you‚Äôre a beebrain.
---
For the record though, I think mittens is a decent dude who said stupid shit on a public stage trying to be edgy and funny.
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that CCP inconsistently applies rules.
---
And i had a bhaalghorn
---
Is that dude almost crying at 3:00?
---
Ey, want me to mention breast-feeding and offend all that murricans? :D
---
Dreads aren't useless enough?
---
Thanks that you did, though ;)
---
Focused void bombs are far more effective than a handful of Bhaalgorns and will force it into panic much faster.
---
Quality.
---
Don't think you can talk about consistency when comparing 3 different cases that span how many years?
---
fits perfectly on that one
---
dreads are so cheap more need 2 die to balance out the minerals (unless ur tnt and can't figure out how 2 use wise dreadnought class vessel)
---
dreadnought class vessels are very very wise tools, big power hammer to those who wield the knowledge
