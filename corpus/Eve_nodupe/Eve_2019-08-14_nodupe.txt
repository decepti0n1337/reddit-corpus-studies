Yes, and if that salvager is online, it's actually worse.
---
---
---
Half the reason to fit stabs is purely for travel. Having it affect align time is the worse navigation stat to hit.
---

---
Warp speed
---
Capacitor requirement (which would easily fit into lore, more scrams more power needed to overcome them)
---
Max speed (balanced with acceleration so it doesn't make you warp faster) but you'll be slower getting out of a bubble or on autopilot. You'll also be easier to decloak.
---
Personally. Cap required to initiate warp would be cool.  Nuets would stop them from being an easy out when in pvp. Having cap hungry mods, like reppers would mean you either get out early or not at all.
---
That is the celebration update I was expecting, but better.  Lol.
---
Then welcome to new bro corps.
---
So you've been attacked by a cloaked ship?
---
They do charge... But we don't get paid.
---
Thought it was Deep Cove, but the hills there are bigger
---
It's the internet there is no sarcasm font so you can only take what folks type as their intent.   If you are too brain dead not to realize some folks wont recognize your "special" form of typing then maybe you need to learn a thing or 2.  "Oh sorry guys I was only kidding  hurr hurr hurr"
---
Interesting, that's pretty clever of that covetor, thanks!
---
MCAV. Only corp that didn't treat the game like it was something more than that or had shitheads trying to tell you what to do. Good bunch of guys, couldn't ask for better.
---
Yup everyone has over time.
---
nah you really haven't   
---
just butthurt comments and you claiming your right because of how you feel to try and save face.   
---
sorry you dont feel safe anymore, git good embrace the age of chaos, adapt and overcome and stop whining about things that aren't going to change.
---
it would be better if we could have modules or abilities to train into automated scanning capabilities imo
---
i duno, probably stealing crumbs from noobs.
---
Yeah I really have.  More countering your butthurtness but okay bud.
---
Had to grab phoenix...
---
Delaying that intel makes it more safe for AFKers/Botters. Those programs don't use DOTLAN or similar sites. Actual at the keyboard players do. Intel programs use scraped player reports and automated intel bots. You know, like the kind that parse the overviews of characters left on gates to report players jumping those gates. 
---
I also see a push to beef up the D-Scan tool and nerf cloaking so that automated D-scan scrapers can help rebuild the intel network that scraping local used to provide.  Kind of like the changes you're trying to lobby for.
---
yeah nah
---
So they were actually cloaked when they attacked you?
---
Rixx must be on the point of exploding by now
---
We're looking forward to having you back.
---
&gt;High Value ‘whaling’ is too hard. &lt;&gt; High Value ‘whaling’ is too easy.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I am assuming you mean freighters in hisec, but all in all bumping is just dreadful game play for the victim.   Enable a BS MWD on freighters and perhaps we can see a bit more difficulty in it for the bumper.
---
I would have thought that would be about blinged mission/ratting ships in hi or null.
---
Yup.  I know where your going but i include (as a logical person would.) decloaking to attack as part of the a cloaked ship attacked you ie cloaked ships are a threat and can harm you.
---
How are you pulling 1300 dps on a regular phoon lol.
---
I like the nano phoon but that number is a touch inflated
---
They're only a threat once they decloak, at which point you're both on equal footing. Or do you think we should make Eve like dueling pistols and we start back to back and fly out 10km, turn, and start firing? That would be more fair wouldn't it?
---
If you can't aford Faction scrams it's not this guy fault.
---
How do you determine owners peak hour in a way that isn't gameable?
---
Yeah, so they can avoid the bubbles of high sec in their supers...
---
...
---
brb, stocking rapiers.
---
I wasn't being sarcastic, just shitposting. But all the people being so unexpectedly mad at a simple comment made me laugh a little, so I'll call it a win.
---
Between the stabs being banned from plexes some time ago and this, I think he is about to reach climax.
---
The amarr magma core ones also have huge heat ports with heat distortion and particles.
---
I finally had a chance to look that up, interesting. I'm going to keep an eye on it. Thanks!
---
Keepstar doomsdaying a Ferox fleet also caught the Phoenix I think
---
Because?... You can't afford faction scrams?
---
You're not on equal footing as they have all the time in the world to position themselves.  I do not think things should be equal but that does not mean we don't try to balance mechanics that make things always so one sided.  A cloaker is a threat in a system whether they decloak or not as it gives them immune information and positioning and allows them to entirely control their engagements with no chance at counterplay, they need a counter or something that gives a chance at finding them.
---
Wormbro was a mistake. It will be missed.
---
That's vaguely insulting to semi-sentient potatoes

for even faster task manager, try Ctrl+Shift+Escape.

---
Stay Frosty/A Band Apart, never had so much fun playing EVE; but FIOF will always have a place in my heart, met a lot of awesome people.
---
So they are 2-3 years late, which means they have 2-3 years of massive isk generation to deal with. And not just isk, ore and other assets too. 
---
Course if the reward for doing stuff in null is lowered, people will mostly stop. Give me standup mission hubs, bots can't really handle doing that very well.
---
Rapid heavy fury plus medium drones.
---
GIRLS is still alive in our hearts
---
I’ll apologize when they return my mining rokh
---
It kind of depends on how you like to play and what you want to do, but everywhere you decide to call home can be profitable.
---
F
---
Technically a new player shouldn't even be out in NS, unless it's to explore or visit. The barrier for entry and skill requirements to preform activities is very high compared to the rest of the game. 
---
It all depends on how you do stuff though. Say you are a new player and found an area of null that isn't high traffic, you could always make trips out to do the higher level sites which you cannot find in high/low. Or go visit to ninja mine. 
---
I always recommend new players spend a few weeks in high security getting their bearings and skills fleshed out. Finding their direction, and moving ahead at a slow pace rather than rushing to join some null group that is more likely to use them.
---
Kinda like impass
---
Ah but that's not going to apply well to cruisers and under
---
Fuck this entire post.
---
Gotta go fast.  Gotta go faster faster
---
It's actually already doomed.
---
Eve is basically a thing collection game by now
---
Ye but it will help with perma afk multi boxed ventures. I am still somewhat okay with people farming that are paying attention.
---
I talked to someone back in 2012, but then retreated back to my solo Corp.
---
I agree with all of that 😀
---
I just meant that this, sadly, is probably more of a placebo change because Ventures are seen a lot. It is probably unlikely to actually make much of a difference to commiting to a fight or botting specifically.
---
Mr flint was cool, tiny had his moments but as with any other place you have your spaz people.  Can’t say my time there was bad.
---
&gt; PL took fleet losses on super fights?! Come on, this was extremely rare and a loss or two to a massive wipe of an enemy fleet was why those ships were lost. 
---
Maybe you've heard of B-R, Y-2ANO, the Y-2 up north, VFK?  In fact can you name me the battle that PL's supercap fleet provided a strong victory in?
---
&gt;Also, what alliance
---
One would assume all of them from your retard assmad posting
---
Gamer: But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the invuln window into his own timezone or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the window into his own timezone, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the timezone in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool. You would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the timezone in front of me.
---
CCP Devs: You've made your decision then?
---
Gamer: Not remotely! Because your CEO comes from Australia, as everyone knows! And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose the timezone in front of you.
---
CCP Devs: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
---
Gamer: Wait till I get going! Now, where was I?
---
CCP Devs: Australia.
---
Gamer: Yes, Australia. And you must have suspected I would have known your corp's origin, so I can clearly not choose the timezone in front of me.
---
CCP Devs: You're just stalling now.
---
That kind of attitude isn't going to get you very far in life
---
Cloaked ships do have balance mechanics. All but the Stealth Bomber have a lock delay after decloaking. They generally have inferior tank and DPS compared to their non-covert counterparts as well. Your main complaint seems to be "Covert ships are covert and can't be detected". Kind of the whole point of the ship.
---
You should give more heads up! What time on Sunday?
---
[deleted]
---
Despite popular belief, CCP generally have  halfway decent explanations lore-wise for the things they do.
---
I'm going to honest with you. It's boring as fuck. 
---
BLOPs fleets are rare even with big group like the Predditors. Most of the groups are super risk adverse so they don't drop more than once or twice a night most nights. Also, once the cats out of the bag, pings go out across New Eden and you'll lose all activity. You're going to want to train other subcaps to get your pvp fill because you won't find it in covops. 4 years of experience here.
---
Neither does "I fucked your mom last night" going get you anywhere either.
---
Mmhmm.
---
And kill at least half the pvp content in lowsec?
---
Dude they moved out like a year ago when dng/calsf/brm/dhsj went on a crusade vs them and sggrn/shoot first. Them being in black rise isn't new. Besides, not worth paying for a duboi corpse when him undocked/ him dead provides the same level of content ayyyyy.
---
All 86 of those are definitely me. CONVO THE BEANS!
---
It is not a good enough balance mechanic to put it plainly.  And that can be the point of the ship while still allowing chances of detection.
---
I'm sorry you hate the truth :(
---
2-week is not a long break
---
Nah, I always capture enemy PLEXes, and absolutely cannot use Venture for that
---
PFR/ACORD
---
I feel like I'm looking back with rose tinted glasses, but those days were fun as fuck.  Not a care in the world and no clue how terrible of a pilot I was :)
---
Pretty sad how PFR died, but it is what it is
---
thats why you double paint :)

Brave Newbies back in the Rahadalon and Barleguet days.  Most fun I had in Eve
---
Tell you what. If they raise the price of WCS to 50 mil for T1 and 80 mil for T2, I'll be down with this as a solution.
---
Otherwise, you're being retarded. You should not get a GTFO card on a subcap fitted to to any aggression. Fight or fly an indy. pick a path.
---
&gt;  A better change would be creating a bubble to allow counter play to nullification (aka a hic script bubble that just targets nullification)
---
No reason why they have to be mutually exclusive, though.
---
Why not?  Put your cap on your alt and use your main for cynos was how I did it for a bit until rolling out a dedicated cyno army.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

&gt; would remove another module option and a counter
---
The only thing it counters is you having an embarrassing loss. BFD, let me tell you about the time I lost a frig full of BPOs.
---
I really don't mind them being on indy ships but it's retarded you have a combat ship fitted to avoid combat.
---
No.
---
I loved brave in the querulous days
---
but you are wrong, The Imperium have  a lot of dead weight, either PVE boi, PVE alt from Panfam or simply inactive people. During the X47 battle panfam bring more people on the field (200~) but they had waaaaaaay less titans than goons
---
Insidious Empire, for the whole few months it lasted.
---
Was curious if the new Vitalshift Ego skin changed when bastioned (like it changes when in warp), it sure does change, the lines literally lift off the hull when bastioned. Attached a few pictures of the skin when bastioned, non bastioned and while warping for your amusement.
---
&gt;I took a proposal to other designers with expertise in FW
---
thats all i read. All hail emperator u/CCP_Rise
---
Yeah look like fat cheeks?
---
Subcap ratting is pretty difficult right now.
---
That said, there are definitely other things you can do with minimal investment.  Exploration is pretty solid and less dangerous than subcap ratting right now, and moon mining can pay exorbitantly, even in a simple procurer (which, in my corp, we just provide for moon mining so the corp is eating the loss if they get ganked).
---
I'm a friendly tourist, I don't want to disturb their natural habitat
---
Thanks!
---
Well that's just not true at all.
---
Boy, I sure am glad we spend so much money on these damned things...
---
Cache and Impass didn’t stop anyone from killing Solar.
---
Well....that's just like.....your opinion man
---
eh, they'll fix it. Its very obviously not right and i can't imagine them leaving it. Nothing to get worked up on, i couldn't help but laugh at the lines just levitating off of it.
---
I’m sure your extensive game knowledge should be taken into consideration. Link killboard
---
in theory not really cause you don't need to keep all jams on them, but in practice yep, especially if they have a second damping ship, get the other ship to make you drop lock for a single cycle and that's it
---
Just like that, you'll throw all of my bait ships out of the window. WCS provides interesting diversity to the game.
---
How about make it so that citadels can only shoot back if it's being attacked? That way you can fight on the keepstar without one side having a huge advantage over the other. Stations were cool because they couldn't shoot you.
---
Yes, adapt or take a npa. See, not that hard to understand.
---
We need more/new combat incentives. Nothing moves economies like war.
---
Why are the profit margins for a LOT of stuff so narrow? I try to build some procurers and the cost of building a max MA blueprint in a 5% industrial efficiency PoS is like, 2%.  Is this just the multiboxing plague gone wild? Even T2 production of highly demanded items seems to have horrible profit margins.
---
Sure, but it's the fact that we end up spending like $20 for a single Skin for a single ship. You can't even say that your $20 purchase is good for any kind of Raven based hull. It only works for the Golem. If you want the same look on your standard-issue Raven, you have to spend another $20.
---
CCP heard about other games using micro-transactions, and said "we should do that... only without the micro part".
---
And then they act like Skins are rare and hard to come by. There are sites out there that can very quickly and easily simulate any Skin on any ship. It's bad enough that they are so clearly just out to take fat handfuls of money with paintjobs. But then you see stuff like this, and it's just them saying "we couldn't be bothered to do any kind of quality control, we were in too big of a hurry to get more of your money."
---
Waffles for 11 years now. Super fun

It sounds helpless, but I succeeded in keeping the company running smoothly and getting better and better.

What I want to say is that no corp is perfect. I prefer to create a good corp than join a good corp.

After all, even a good corp may be dissolved, but as long as you continue to improve yourself, you will never be dissolved.

So CCP is wowwied about de vowume of ISK in de system and wants mowe chaos. (See, especiawwy, 1:29:18 comments fwom Hiwmaw: [https://www.weddit.com/w/Eve/comments/ci6efy/ccp\_hiwmaw\_ccp\_fawcon\_and\_ccp\_goodfewwa\_weveaw/](https://www.weddit.com/w/Eve/comments/ci6efy/ccp_hiwmaw_ccp_fawcon_and_ccp_goodfewwa_weveaw/)). So dey waised mawket taxes. wadew den incweasing dis sink dey need to attack de faucet.

Incweasing twansaction taxes incweases de mawket spwead, deweby wowewing de vewocity of ISK, dispwopowtionatewy impacting new chawactews and dose not in a wawge awwiance.

56% of aww ISK came fwom bounty pwizes and a fuwdew 27% fwom sewwing dwops to NPCs (pew de June 2019 economic wepowt: [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7whcm73ukv5p/XsAHJwfgwVSMOUDzydst/e0df31dea0ea1be2241ebadf17586987/9a\_sinksfaucets.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7whcm73ukv5p/XsAHJwfgwVSMOUDzydst/e0df31dea0ea1be2241ebadf17586987/9a_sinksfaucets.png)). CCP shouwd focus on dese faucets to weduce de monetawy suppwy. Two pwoposaws:
---
1) Dynamic Secuwity wating and Associated Spawns: Have de secuwity wating incwease as NPCs awe kiwwed, but staying wifin deiw secuwity cwass (eg HS awways HS, wS awways wS, NS awways NS). As secuwity wating incweases it wouwd weduce de spawn wate, combat site wevews, and bounty payuwts in de system. dis wouwd fowce mowe movement amongst wattews, make boting mowe difficuwt, incwease wisk, and weducing ISK genewation dwough watting--bod fwom dwops and bounty payments.

That is amazing.
---
Nothing to do with multiboxing, just competition
---
I think you're asking what the easiest way to make \~3b isk is. It's hard to answer this generically, because EVE's PVE profits are so market-driven. To make isk, plain and simple, you're looking not for a generic optimum because there really isn't one. You're looking for places where your skills give you an advantage. Your human skills, not your in-game SP, although the latter is also relevant. To make isk in a non-frustrating way, I'd look at what activities you find to be not frustrating, and think about how you can make isk doing those things.
---
😂
---
Hopefully Fozzie and the rest of the design team doesn't listen to Dunk at the CSM summits lol.
---
It doesn't always have to be wormholes with a stratios, you can roam near Tama or Amamake with it. The best part, you can actually evade those 8-10 man gate camps most of the time with a strat.
---
I didn't check my discord this past week due to being out of town and had well over 100 just from Horde alone.
---
Thank goodness for lowsec bordering nullsec, then.
---
I reckon I've finally got the game to work, I'll hit you up when I figure out how to do that
---
Maybe nullsec has the highest bounties because it was built that way.
---
But nerfing the faucets won’t touch the multi trillionaires, just helps prevent new ones
---
the issue isn’t generation.  It’s lack of use after generatiob
---
No bullshit on voice, intelligent plays and a fleet that actually does what is asked.  That's how EVE should be all the time.
---
No, please no. Make people fit their ship to counter this. Also... what about Combat Ventures?
---
The black out means no matter who you join or where you go
---
you will lose isk in subcaps.  That’s by design to force you into capital ships and become a capital ship pilot.
---
It means your alliance doesn't let you fuck around with your cap.
---
2 months we will rebuild.
---
My laptop shat itself yesterday.

I'd be impressed if anyone was able to come up with _ANY_ combat incentives in-game that won't immediately be rendered useless by out-of-game diplo and bluedonuting.

Wow this is almost worse than stainguy

At this point I honestly can't tell if this is satire or not.
---
Logged back in after a few years away.  No local, is fine in my oppinion.  I'm a little more relaxed now just accepting that death my happen at any time, just go with the flow.
---
However, can we now get an automatic Dscan.  I'm sure with pod technology, someone could figure out how to rig a timer to the Scan button my now.
---
Out of Focus (Odin's Call)
---
I see you never warped half way to your intended target, cause you didn't have enough cap for full warp
---
What dat is?
---
So much better, actually.
---
Don't do that.
---
Don't give me hope.
---
True. Pavlov's dog here though would settle for less

"it's only &lt;bannable offense&gt;"

Back in the day we all just stacked quarters on the MWD hotkey when you couldn't warp to zero and had to autopilot.

So the guy who lost a JF in a drag bubble to a spergy 16y FC on their keepstar is now telling people how to use Capitals ?

Heres a thought. Why not make them active modules instead of passive?

Great change, I just cannot inderstand how this took 4 years. It should be such an easy change to implement.
---
Why does it have to be one or the other? Perhaps it's fight, but just not you? If someone wanted to fight you, they wouldn't put the module in their ship. It's there for a reason. To escape. 
---
So, let the people escape that want to escape, and let the people that want to fight fight.
---
Lmao you guys need a ticket to make a jump?
---
Theraboi. Good luck
---
&gt;Half the reason to fit stabs is purely for travel. Having it affect align time is the worse navigation stat to hit.
---
Which is largely why I suggested it. It's also something you mitigate with manual piloting; a single pulse of a prop-mod will give your ship a good shove in the right direction, typically above align-speed. 
---
But anyway, if it is too drastic, then a different navigation penalty will have to suffice. 
---
&gt;Warp speed
---
I'd accept it, mainly because people want to go-to and leave-from somewhere as quickly as possible. A slow warp will allow pursuers to get ahead to the next gate and try again. 
---
&gt;Capacitor requirement (which would easily fit into lore, more scrams more power needed to overcome them)  
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt;Personally. Cap required to initiate warp would be cool.  Nuets would stop them from being an easy out when in pvp. Having cap hungry mods, like reppers would mean you either get out early or not at all.
---
The problem with this is currently that if you don't have enough cap to make it all the way, you'll still warp *part of the way*. Increased cap cost will just mean your initial warp will be shorter. This proposal means warp mechanics have to change to be more like a jump-drive. But that has the problem of making certain celestial objects unreachable by low-skill pilots.
---
&gt;Max speed (balanced with acceleration so it doesn't make you warp faster) but you'll be slower getting out of a bubble or on autopilot. You'll also be easier to decloak.
---
Max speed doesn't affect\* align-time. Only mass and agility do. The caveats being pulsing a prop-mod, or swapping between modes in a T3D. 
---
A max-velocity penalty will indeed hurt auto-piloting, but it doesn't hurt people warping gate to gate in empire space. I think a penalty that becomes irrelevant in large portions of space is a bad design.
---
Would be great if enemy battleships could send drones to attack us . 3:-)

without question the most fun i have ever had playing this amazing game. many times i have wished that life hadn't kicked be in the balls when it did, or PFR might have turned out differently...
---
Ah right so you went to Anoikis to play station games
---
Sell your shit and invest into plex
---
I mean... it can be done
---
Ignoring context is usually a terrible idea. Especially in situations like this. If you get redhanded breaking a rule, and then say "yeah i'm breaking the rules", it's safe to say they are indeed breaking the rules. Chat logs alone don't matter indeed, but it does add to the other evidence and shows this player doesn't give a rat's ass about the rules of the game.
---
I remember the Siege of Plexingrad... *wheez cough* it only took 300 years to drive out then damn Gallente frogs... back in them days, boy, men were MEN!
---
Good change, now apply this to ships with stabs fit instead of the previous "fix" of not allowing them to pass FW plex gates.  Bring back gate sliding.
---
A dangerous game we play allowing the enforcer to be judge and jury.
---
I deleted my post, good video.
---
Knowledge that I'm depleting my enemy's strength is more than enough for me. And not everything gets jumped out. In X47 a lot of dudes just docked up and ran in a ceptor out. Picked up their assets afterward. Remember, the North actually formed with the intent of fighting for the hull timer.
---
That is also okay! Thank you for the feedback :)

Honestly, they probably weren't the actual best but the first Alliance I was in, Outer-Heaven, was a good time while it lasted. I was a complete newbie at the time and they taught me a lot of things I didn't know about Eve
---
You are a c4 heathen. Shut up. Volta, hawks and hk will erase all of you c4 degenerates. Just you wait

Ohhh shit ok ok. I'm going to do that today.

k.

Today I added a 2hr train to my queue. The total time just by 21 hours. Took it off, went down by 21 hours. Odd.
---
&gt; someone gets caught breaking a rule
---
&gt; then says “yeah i’m breaking the rules”
---
the thing here is, they’ve already been caught breaking a rule.
---
in the case of the OP, it *might* be some server side thing, or he used a hotkey switcher and has super high APM.
---
him saying he used something doesn’t immediately mean he did it lol.
---
Uh yeah I'm just saying you should be using Caldari Navy heavies unless explicitly attacking a bs. 
---
Your statement about 1300 dps out to 55km that applies well is cherry picking, and not an accurate assessment of combat performance
---
nidia is an actual retard
---
Eh I don't agree with this. Stabs are a legit counter in a fight not going your way.
---
&gt;Why does it have to be one or the other? Perhaps it's fight, but just not you? If someone wanted to fight you, they wouldn't put the module in their ship. It's there for a reason. To escape.
---
@ /u/CCP_Rise
---
In this one post, the gentleman summed up the biggest reason 
---
WCS are in need of a major restriction or removal altogether. Unless you guys have decided non-consentual PVP is a thing best left in the past. If this is left the way it is, will you add PVP queues for arena play? Because that's what these guys want.
---
it's not roleplay
---
I'm sure you'll adjust to the new meta. ;)
---
A hic pointing a stab ship would still disrupt it no? It's infinipoint strength.
---
he is tho
---
What was GIRLS?
---
If the fight's not going your way, learn to disengage or accept the fact that fights can be... risky.
---
I'm legitimately amazed at the amount of salty pushback I got for saying WCS were bad. I simply had no idea how many people had such an aching need to avoid losing a fight.
---
Even though they are retarded, my time in The Mighty Beans was honestly the best i've experienced in eve. They are cancer in a good way, and I miss it. Their CEO is the most benevolent leader of all time, and if you're new to wormholes, or looking for a good place to start, I'm gonna outright say that they're the best place to go. 
---
o7 TMB
---
They are good people
---
More strictly, dropping nullification for intys. Yachts are expensive so fine and T3Cs need a subsystem for it which makes them shitter than they would be otherwise, so I'm cool with that.
---
Tactically Challenged, without a doubt.
---
Question if you don’t mind, the MJFG has a spin up, did the FC call to launch bombs as, or after the CD hit jump?
---
Launching the bombs before or at the same time as the jump is totally off the wall and left the other fleet with less time to respond , but the bombs have to still be within 6k to take the jump, right?
---
All hail Matias

Miners are skittish creatures by nature, prone to flee at the first sight of danger. When caught, they exude copious quantities of salt in an attempt to poison whoever catches them. Obviously, this is rarely effective.         
---
The "Rorqual", however, has evolved a curious adaptation to aid in a form of mutualism. When threatened, it creates a brilliant light that attracts other predators to the scene in the hopes that these will fight off any attackers for it. This is often surprisingly effective, as these ersatz "allies" will often leave the scene full and with little interest in hunting down the "Rorqual".
---
Hi, does anyone have a mellon-baller handy?
---
Move to wormholes. Higher risk, higher ISK.
---
I have. That's not what I'm saying. It should make it where you require cap to initiate warp. Just like jumping a cap.
---
Hi pot, meet kettle
---
Good bot.
---
What u mean goes bad? That looks like it went perfect!
---
I did this last month, I took about a 6 week break, would have saved 400-500m had I bought PLEX when I got back.
---
When traveling, it's mainly to combat a gate camp. I don't need another mod to worry about cycling in the tick before they get a lock. Why make the game need more clicking.
---
It should be and no.
---
Yeah a good one.
---
They used to. Moons.
---
Increase the cost of running structures by having to buy license tokens and not just by having fuel. If a structure runs out of tokens NPC’s will reinforce it and return to finish it at the end of the timer unless tokens are bought. - Structure Spam reduced.
---
Increase the cost of supers/titans jumping - super/titan umbrella drops less likely unless worth it.
---
Require a cap/supercap require a daily fuel item even if its docked up. Balance can go negative and ship cannot be used or traded until balance paid off. Titans on contract cannot be traded without a minimum of 28 days of tokens.
---
Just because logic isn't one of your strong points doesn't mean you can't put in the extra effort to understand and use it correctly. If you aren't willing to do that, then you should probably stick to things you ARE good at.
---
If you want to continue this conversation, read everything I typed until you actually understand it, then post a response (or edit your previous one) that indicates that understanding.
---
I'm not trying to be mean here, but I've gone to the effort of spelling things out for you and you are STILL replying with more aggression than comprehension. You don't need to agree with me, you just need to understand the posts you're replying to. 
---
If you're still reading what I'm saying as "pvp is bad, pve is good" or "it should be this way because that's what I enjoy", this conversation is a waste of both of our time (times? not really sure how to correctly word that...).
---
You listed probably 95% of the nullsec population if "goons" is including the Imperium.
---
Any chance this can convert your settings from tranquillity to singularity as well? Annoying when you go to test your shit on singularity and your settings are all defaults again.
---
Betting he has some losses to Cloaky Lois or bombers
---
Did they go through with making the inside of stars like deadspace? Where even if you make a BM in a warp pass, you just warp to orbit?
---
The larger cultural change happened after they moved back in from the PL/Legacy invasions.
---
Drastically decreased population and much lower trust/acceptance of neutrals.
---
It can be hard to find a good citadel to stage out of with a neutral alt.
---
wouldnt be surprised if he has losses to Omber rocks tbh
---
How is what you're saying make sense? If someone wants to fight you, they will. If you want content make it. Don't sit on a gate and camp waiting for the content to come to you. 
---
To give people who don't want to fight no choice but to fight? Or rather get farmed by a gate camp and killed? I'm sorry, but if I'm out by myself I'm not looking to fight ten+ people on a gate. I'm looking to fight one on one. 
---
This queue time and arena is just closed minded thinking by someone who's just salty about the solo flier avoiding their gang. I think you're just projecting your anger at a single module, than actually coming up with a legitimate way to counter them. 'Waaah it's broken. It allows my fish to escape my gang. CCP please remove! Waaaaah'
---
Wcs are fine exactly where they are. You want to restrict them, bring more tackle or deal with the disappointment that every solo pilot faces when they warp in expecting a fun fight only to realize they're just about to get nuked by fifteen or more people. Disappointment. 
---
There is too much hate for wcs especially when there are bubbles. Bubbles are a thing that exist. They are there to stop people from warping. Wcs don't supercede bubbles. I've flown in a venture and gotten caught by more than one bubble in j space.
---
But you're right. The single mechanic that allows people to get away from fights they don't want should definitely be removed. Let's just force everyone to fight even if they don't want to you or your squad of gate campers. Because let's be honest, the only reason people use them is to escape fights to avoid tackle and get away from a fight they might lose. Almost as if. . . They're running away. Just like the module is intended to be used. 
---
It takes 2 wcs to get through a single scram. That's two whole low slots to avoid one mid. My thinking emoji says that two slots are more than one. 
---
And the whole if you don't want to fight don't undock mentality, its a great way to make new players that want to experience the game not come back.
---
R/uwutranslator
---
EVE has never been THAT complex btw.
---
U/uwutranslator
---
I'm not downvoting you, I'm just saying that WCS are a legit way to disengage and my fleets use them as such. I don't see anything wrong with that. 
---
Example, we carrier drop some battleships camping a gate (because why not) and they escalate. We want to get our carriers out because they drop supers. WCS are a way to do that if you're stupid enough to have carriers close or they have fast tackle available.
---
I honestly don't get why people care about cosmetic pricing, it adds nothing to the game, if it's worth it to you get it, otherwise don't...  The reason they are $20 is because people are willing to buy them at that price (and obviously they are based on the amount of expensive skins I see in game).
---
It might not be a bad idea to try learning as part of a group at first. You'll get a feel for which ships are useful at a given role, how to prioritize, etc. I'm not saying not to solo but it's not terrible to make mistakes and be able to get positive feedback after they are made.
---
It's also easier to lose T1 cruisers if you have a decent income. Consider Dreddit. word is, we're recruiting. :)
---
Sort of  
---
We wanted to hold onto what we enjoyed doing in the game.
---
  
---
Then the blue donut of Taperium Guardians of the PBIC happened.  
---
Now we've changed to become something more standard in the current "meta" of the game
---
yes in goons.
---
The jumpdrive was activated by the FC after he called for the bombs. There is a small timeframe when you can launch bombs and actually boosh them with you. If correctly timed and performed it is around 3 seconds.
---
Guy mostly answered your question already but didnt give an authorized example. Freighters shipping things to and from trade hubs for the war effort might get authorization from directors. Combat cap fleet following FC orders would likely be given authorization.
---
I'm mostly suggesting it as a way to give it more flavor, everyone seems to hate wcs so much. So maybe it needs to be an active module. Like flicking another switch in the cockpit. You don't need it all the time, so why should it passive stabilize the warp core? 
---
It shouldn't take more than a few seconds for you to click align and warp out. Which is the time it takes to lock. Besides the only time wcs is necessary is if they're scramming you already, right?
---
I'm trying to make different options. Instead of people rioting to have it removed from the game all together.
---
you can bridge freighters to beacons
---
missiles have "explosion radius" and "explosion velocity" the larger the ship (measured in signature radius) and the smaller the radius, the more damage you apply to the thing youre shooting. explosion velocity is the similar but with the speed of the thing youre targeting. if its moving fast or the explosion velocity is low you wont apply 100% of the damage you could be.
---
if you shoot a battleship with cruise misslies (big damage, big radius, low velocity) youll do over 1000 damage per volley. if you shoot a fast moving frigate with the same cruise misslies, youll be doing less than 100 damage per volley. 
---
the damage reduction between a battle ship and frigate when shooting light missiles is much less. youll still apply 80-90% of the damage to a fast moving frigate, but the maximum damage youll do to a battleship will not be &gt;1000 per volley.
---
TIL that zero bhaalgorns is too many.
---
An interesting idea, but the reason they don't is because the ships have crew that are preforming constant maintenance.
---
&gt; le, we carrier drop some battleships camping a gate (because why not) and they escalate. We want to get our carriers out because they drop supers. WCS are a way to do that if you're stupid enough to have carriers close or they have fast tackle available.
---
I don't much notice the downvotes. I tent to give opinions that tear into the hearts of guys who think low or null sec space should be safe-ish.
---
Anyway, I get what you're saying but I don't agree with it. If you're going to undock in caps, be willing to lose them.
---
Tell me something. If WCS were gone, would you still drop those battleships in your carriers? If not, all the WCS are doing is enabling risk aversion. I'm not a rich pilot but I found myself with a spare carrier recently so I'm looking at doing solo driveby shootings if it seems likely to get some fun kills. I'll lose isk in the bargain but I can accept that as fair trade for the laughs I get. I won't be stabbed.
---
Imo null is good for research, capital industry, t2 production and that s about it.
---
You kill me DST? No, you run out of ammo and cap. HAHA *crab* *crab*
---
Take something that sucks about owning real life machines and make it apply to my fake spaceship pixel machines.  Cool.

Thorn Syndicate. Our CEO and members make it super enjoyable to have fun and to do our jobs.
---
Brings new meaning to "war of the rats"
---
&gt; t can be hard to find a good citadel to stage out of with a neutral alt, and they are much less willing to approach or invite new players. You have to approach them, but they are not very attractive to new players.
---
Was that after VOLT left? I was in VOLT a couple/few years ago and went inactive when my company was bought and parted out. I unsubbed to look for work. When I came back I was red by last that was fine because I learned some shit went down but I wasn't able to convince people of my sincerity. Everyone I spoke with thought I was a spy. Even characters who had not joined volt but were longtime neuts were suddenly unwelcome.
---
I hoped things had changed in the two years since but it seems not.
---
Do you guys RP minnie slave killers? Maybe dragging them back to their RP roots would help revitalize them. If you don't, would you? I do think CVA served a good purpose in the game for many, many years.
---
That’s great, I’m training command dest to IV atm, and can’t wait to play with it.
---
The main thing I want to do with it is boosh scouts off holes, it’s fun playing cat and mouse, but I want them dead.
---
Almost all our members can fly Strats and bombers, I don’t know why more of us don’t use command destroyers and dictors to catch the small stuff, I’m about to do it myself.
---
If you give me your stuff i can promise to whelp it all.
---
returning players would come back to have no ships if this happened. i dont think this is a good idea because it would dis-incentivize people to come back.
---
Risk reduction is part of warfare. I don't understand when people say 'reeeeee, fights should be fair'. Fuck off, that's not how war ever works. You want fair request duels at highsec trade hubs. Sure on occasion I'll commit to a fight that's relatively even if I think we will out pilot the others, but it largely depends. 
---
I rarely use WCS on carriers unless for some reason I'm gate jumping, it was just an example. Definitely not in combat. We pilot carriers very differently which reduces our risk whilst still allowing for damage projection. Carriers in themselves are a little broken and OP.
---
you are not allowed to automate the game in anyway. you cant even use autohotkey to press multiple function keys at once. you are also not allowed to OCR your game instance. all of what you want to do is bannable.
---
PL always did play the propaganda game. Even when they lose the fight they win at their own personal goals that they keep changing their mind about.
---
And add a complex spaceship repair simulator as walking in hagars is no longer a thing. 1st person similar to those car mechanic games.
---
Of course ships are gigantic, so you better learn how to get around to the different maintenance areas.
---
&gt; How is what you're saying make sense? If someone wants to fight you, they will. If you want content make it. Don't sit on a gate and camp waiting for the content to come to you. 
---
What you are describing is consentual PVP. The eve I joined was OK with that but also encouraged non-consentual PVP. WCS weren't used nearly as much in 2009 as they appear to be today, at least not in combat ships.
---
It almost seems like you'd as soon see tackle go the way of the dodo so you could promise perfectly consentual PVP, which would be boring.
---
I know how many mids and lows are needed. You want WCS, pay half a faction point for each of them. Then it's a fair trade.
---
At current prices, they should power off your offensive mods and lock your aggressive drones in the bay. If you want guns, you can drop the depot your hauling around and refit.
---
Just so long as you can't do this with Jump Freighters, otherwise it doesn't have all that many downsides with them.

MD-K was the most fun I've had an eve, Xeaon and SuperTwinkie were both sensational FCs, Twink was good in D00M as well, but not the same as back in MD-K.

Burn Eden also has a special place in my heart, learned to mutli-box pvp there and didnt know a person could make so much ISK pvping.
---
begun the anime war has?
---
&gt; I don't understand when people say 'reeeeee, fights should be fair'
---
Where did I say they should be fair? I'm not the one wanting to turn Eve into arena PVP. That's what you appear to be pushing. You want to be able to gank some bitch but not be worried his buddies might get you. It's not about fair, it's about balance and competing video game balance to actual wars is silly.

&gt;my only game is pvp.

One scram is two points. One warp core stab is one point counter scram. Yet everyone is complaining. Not sure what there is to argue about anymore. If someone is commiting that many low slots to avoid getting pointed then. . . Well then they really don't want to fight. And if they get caught out and killed? Well you really want to kill that person.
---
You want a warp core stab to be .5? Then I guess we better make scrams 1. And long points .5. Then it's fair. 
---
You'd probably suggest that it keeps you from cloaking too, make repairing your ship while getting shot at impossible. Let's make it so that in order to fit wcs it auto destroys all your rigs too, or you can't fit any other modules. Because from what you're suggesting it's to make you complete combat incapable. So that if you do get scrammed by enough to get through the wcs you Auto die. If you fit wcs and have zero combat ability. Only fit one and auto escape everything. I'll take that. You want people with wcs to be unable to fight, then they should be able to escape no matter what. Because that's primarily what they're used for.
---
There is nothing wrong with fitting wcs. People use them to get out of a lot of situations, and they won't apologize for using them. Nor should they. 
---
There is still more than enough non consentual pvp out there without wcs being in the mix. It happens all the time, everyday.
---
It's too late damage already done. Let's not complicate things. This all began when anomalies were introduced.  
---
Vastly reduce the spawn rate that's all you need to do to spread people out.  But in reality coalitions have become so huge now that they are already spread out farming almost every system.
---
Sure theres a lot of space that's not getting used so for those it will help.  But for goons for example they are max farming Delve.
---
The only real way is to remove anomalies altogether.   Create more of the old school 10/10 DED static sites to create conflict as well.  CCP have introduced a ton of PVE content to make isk.  Incursions, missions, abyssal, exploration, mining etc etc
---
1) You are not the only person responsible for your ships. Having a Capsuleer in charge just means it takes less crew to operate, not a total lack of crew. So there are still people maintaining your ships even when you aren't using them.
---
2) Nanites are a thing, and we use them all the time. Local armor/hull reps are spreading nanites on your own ship to fix the dings and dents. Remote reps are spraying nanites on someone else. And obviously Nanite Paste to rebuild the individual devices on your ship.
---
Beautiful run tbh
---
You shouldn't go to parties.
---
Easy, my guy. I agree that Goon glasses a region and a half and was looking to glass more, and the short lived drifter event contributed to its end, but I wouldn't go so far as to put my tinfoil on for this one. The timing was certainly convenient as far as NCPL to restructure in TKE, but I doubt CCP would go that far to save NC or PL. There were lore based precursors to the drifter event. Perhaps the lesson major blocs should take away from this is to add lore interpretation to their intelligence reports? Couldn't hurt.

I remember this fabulous session in ptu 3.6, where I discovered with pleasure the new aspect of these stations ^^
---
Best of luck to ya. If you tag your shots like a postcard I'll let you know when you enter my neck of the woods.
---
Maybe it could only apply to active players who have ships in storage, but don't use them. Players who are offline for extended periods wouldn't have this applied.
---
Different year different game.
---
Yes, but ship repairing is still a thing at most stations.
---
Yeah no jump freighters
---
This used to be a thing all the time. I had BMs for inside several planets and stars. One was just like this, a very short distance off the center of the Amarr sun. If you moved any closer, you'd get thrown out at a bajillion meters per second.
---
But then they "fixed" all those BMs so if you try to warp to them, you just end up at the usual WTZ point in orbit. Unless they un-fixed that recently and I missed it.
---
just wondering, does this shit happen in other alliances? this like holier than thou attitude from directors, this *oh i can’t be bothered to pick up your shit but i *guess* i have to* attitude
---
seems so prevalent in horde tbh

---
Cry more.

They need to remove as many automated mechanics as they can from this game. The more that players have to actually interact with this universe, the more alive it is going to feel.

Changing the security ratting does not increase the risk to a botter in any way, shape, or form. Did you even read what you wrote?

All have it. Just less so as they smaller with less new beans.

Ah gotcha

I’ll never understand it. Like, if it’s so horrible to deal with, just don’t? Idk. Stockholm’s probably lol

Some bombers uncloaked on me and I killed the ones with point on me then warped out. How does that happen if they are invincible?

eh, i still dont like it. i tend to leave ships around, even more so before citadels because stations were permanent and i knew that at some point, maybe years in the future i would move into a new area and would already have a small nest egg waiting for me. on the 9b my account is worth, about 8b is locked away in asset safety, it used to hang out in low/ null stations.
---
Nulli Secunda was a great time overall.
---
Also the first half year of the MC reboot was stupid fun all around. Pretty much until the Nasty Boyz split happened.
---
But why the rp? Seems to have no benefit
---
Rumor has it that local blackout is only client side and bots are starting to rollout workarounds.

I don't know much about that area myself to look into it but it would be a shame if thay were true.

Wasnt there already a war over anime?

Yeah this guy is an asshat.

---
&gt; Technically a new player shouldn't even be out in NS, unless it's to explore or visit.

This is completely false and there are new player groups in Nullsec who will show you exactly how full of shit this guy is.

As far as im aware, yes they all turn blue while warping. So i believe these are the first more dynamic skins weve gotten, which is what led me to testing bastion on the golem to see if it changed as well.

Dude the last thing I want is for Eve to be any sort of arena PVP. That's what AT is for. I'm happy for a gank target's buddies to try and respond, but I reserve the right to disengage if the fight isn't going my way. I didn't see NC responding to the goons glassing their shit, they ran away because of course they couldn't respond in kind.
---
WCS in no way damage the balance of small gang engagements. They definitely affect solo engagements, which I totally agree is annoying, but I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater over that.
---
&gt; (stabs prevent you getting into anything smaller than a Large)
---
When did that become a thing? Not that I'm complaining but I missed that happening.
---
I had a lot of fun with them, the only reason I left was that the actual Corp I was in wasn’t very active, so I had almost nothing to do between alliance fleets. But the actual fleets were very good, excluding structure bashes obviously.
---
Can't get enough?
---
No it means that alliance is poor and doesn't enable people to get shit done.
---
BANKAI!
---
Well capital pve hasn't changed, so I assume so.
---
Only hentai then?
---
Only if its free?
---
Honestly?  Directors have so many things they need to take care of, and it's a volunteer job.  There are certain things to care about, and others is "ehh I don't care enough to bother".
---
Bitching about taking Ansiblex jump gates with caps is right up there with "who the fuck cares?"  LO is so cheap, especially if you have an active set of miners.  Give black out another couple of weeks though... and LO is going to start getting much more expensive with the drastic cut in the number of mining rorquals.
---
Cant bring a stabbed ship into anything other than a large i think
---
I didn’t even realize they took it away. That seems silly to me.
---
I support anime

Any of them, really. 
---
All for different reasons.
---
What the-? They're at it *again?!*
---
Someone notify PCG_Steven, because apparently his work isn't done just yet.
---
Yeah that makes sense to me. My first reaction from any complaining from a director is "Well, just, don't do it". But, people want their fake internet power I guess.
---
They let this go on too long. Ccp made anomalies too farmable and should of introduced increased Ewar such as points and webs to them as well as the rates of respawning. Nerfing the npc value just forces more people to other areas instead. 
---
I know hilmar said he wants to increase the value of isk in game. Blackout has helped a bit curbing the bottling issue. They still have a ways to go. But ya, for a while you will have a generational gap of wealth between players who made their isk before and those currently making their isk. Who knows if eve will survive it, but it’s one of those things where it was either not change it and let it stay as is or attempt to see if in the future the game is healthy. Idk hopefully we get some idea soon of what they want to do with anomalies and isk making in the game, but I don’t hold my breath, ccp can be all talk and take a long time to implement changes.

Do elaborate with Stay Frosty, I'm really curious why you love them so much.

I meant inertial stabilisers (iStabs), sorry. Basically, you see something on 0.1AU, you gtfo.

I just meant that there had been no change in the commitment of a pilot in a plex.
---
It does help out with the large plexes a bit though!
---
What happened there, I'm curious
---
God I wish PFR had kept going. Good fights from you guys.
---
This just means that they aren't charging enough per unit of LO on the jump gate.

At least when I finally find a fight, it’ll be somebody willing to shoot back.

I always wanted to play a welding simulator.  A+ idea!

Which you can avoid by undocking and running your own repper. Or floating outside a Citadel. Or docking in a Citadel (no repair fees). Lots of alternatives that don't cost anything.

Appetite 4 Destruction.  They were arguably one of the best small gang alliances in EvE and I had an incredibly good time there.  We're talking about small engagement where FC would say anybody tackled and about to die needs to call out who has them pointed.  Then a Curse would neut out the person with point and nobody would die.  I miss those days and wish I could have them back.
---
Only if it’s an ugly baby
---
That's interesting because my experience has been the opposite. I'm a terrible nano pilot which is what they love to fly. I've lost like 8 ships due to me being bad. Every time someone I'm flying with has explained to me what I've done wrong and what I should be doing so I'm appreciative of that. Much better than welping ships over and over. If that's elite then sign me up.
---
Youre an idiot for thinking that.
---
If they think were made of money , well tell me how that works out for them is all I have to say . I know I wont be buying . Let alone plex being down in price so Im not going to waste my money on that as well .
---
Yeah, I'm all for making it less easy to do certain things, but I'm also very firmly anti-monotony. Monotony is *bad* in a game, and it's one of the reasons I'd love to see a mining revamp.

Getting players to interact more with the game *in ways that aren't monotonous* is a good thing. Monotony is not fun, it's anti-fun.

---
And youre still missing the fking point. Are you an idiot? Who gives a shit about me as a person? Im using myself as an example to explain the reasoning of someone in this situation. Its not about trying to kill me cause they cant really touch me, its about something being obviously broken and a gaming corp hellbent on trying to punish us for their mistakes.

Thats not a good game anymore, end of story. And supporting that. I mean. Sooner or later they gonna turn on some other group. If the rest even had half of brain they would have realised this and actually stood behind their fellow eve players instead of being subjective cunts.

for example,   High sec incursion. DON'T TAKE THE GATE UNTIL FC TELLS YOU OR YOU DIE.

yeah. you can guess how often that happens sadly......and FCs tend to have roleplay jokes they use to cope with the stupidity.
---
for example.  anyone who leaves when next site is TCRC.  dies.   (they dont actually kill ya, but they joke they will)
---
No, local is a core tenet. The game being dangerous isnt. Thats the stupid part of all of this, that very assumption. The game is a sandbox in which there are different mechanics to help a player to a different amount in different security systems. Its not about it being dangerous cause thats up to players, the game itself isnt potent you do get that right? Its what the players make it.
---
And players make it dangerous and players made it less dangerous in NS. Thats fair game, its a sandbox. Changing core tenets to help a certain group is a bitch move.
---
The rest of your shit, I mean just check above. You are confused dude. You somehow think people got automatically blown up in NS just by setting their foot there. There is no such mechanic in the game. You need to understand the concept of a sandbox before making statements.
---
try being in charge of 10,000 newbeans who don't understand travel.
---
they will take the gate back and forth 10+ times before learning of industrials.
---
nevermind mwds.....
---
it adds up.  and its annoying for logistics because you have a fleet returning home.  oh jeez the gate ran out again.   now we gotta wait while FC turns to citadel. docks.  grabs industrial they have stored there.  fuels.  and returns for their ship.
---
Fly to jita buy an ecm burst slap it on a ship undock and fire
---
He is talking about fking making isk in DEDs.
---
They are braindead. Its fking obvious things for one. Secondly to even assume that its even half decent that one side all of the sudden should get thousands of alts sitting on gates is ridicilous. 
---
If you pull your head out of your ass and smell the fresh air you might notice this.
---
I support you. Good job, buddy! :)
---
yeah I wouldn't say stabs are ever equipped during a fight normally, as it tends to nerf the ship's capability. However not allowing stabs on combat ships at all is silly. Plus some capitals will refit during a fight to bug out.
---
Nullification on intys, sure. On fitted T3Cs and yachts, I don't agree since one you have to fit for nullification which nerfs combat capabilities and the other is an expensive niche ship that can't haul much at all.
---
I dont disagree here dude. Its an utterly shitty mechanic and NS gets shit for being "afk" while doing PvE yet the PvPers can just leave a ship in space for 24h without it being "bad to be afk". Its hypocrisy and its a truly shitty mechanic. There should most def be an hour long max cloak which means active cloaky hunters will never suffer but passive can go fk themselves.
---
But other than that, cloaks are not broken. They are rather niche in a normal Eve environment. So I dont agree that we should make cloaks alltogether useless just to balance the blackout. The blackout is straight stupid and there is no fix for that amount of stupid, it needs to go.

How about we expand that to all ships with a base warp core strength of greater than 1.  BRs?  Supers?
---
T3c do not have to be expensive to still be combat effective though. I have all t2 fit hunters that can go anywhere un-impeeded. That shouldn't be a thing without some form of counter. Shuttles and victory yachts sure whatever. Ceptor and t3c have far too much combat capability though when nullified
---
Some areas are poorer so companies price their products lower to sell some instead of none while greedily extracting the most profit possible from richer regions.

That would be great if you could define a combat ship vs. a non combat ship. What guy is on his way to his home and what guy is looking for combat.

Please stop listening to the reddit crowd (yes including me). Stabs have niche uses and moving ships is one of them. Just removing them all together is bad, you remove yet another counter without replacing it.

and by chaos they want to be able to kill things in null

I see it as an opportunity to spend the difference directly in local businesses so it would be more beneficial to everyone if I buy it for half price :D Everyone wins.
---
I believe many playstyles have seen huge hits since the citadel patch, at the expense of the catering to crowded nonselectively recruiting mega empire playstyle. The main reason was injectors and rorquals buffing CCPs income.
---
The playstyles that directly got hurt includes nomadic powerhouses like PL, renting and rental empire management, whaling and whaler entities like skillu, fw, bombing, small gangs in null, and the list goes on and on. I can count many ways how that happened.
---
Now, in the same set of years, "newbro corps" actually became much more relevant. Perhaps not as much as condense umbrella space but still a lot more relevant.
---
When the leaders of such alliances that enjoyed last few years to the fullest weave people's displeasure around narratives like "everyone is pursuing their interests" or "a vocal minority gets what they want", that's ignorance at best and psy ops at worst. And sorry to break it, but nullsec mega coalitionw are the vocal minority of this game and in Reddit as well. Not the other way around. I don't get at all when nullsec leaders complain about the "vocal Reddit minority" when Reddit is literally null linemember haven. When an antinull idea gets upvoted, it happens despite the typical Reddit inclination, not because of it.
---
You think whalers are merely arguing for their interests. The moment whaling or nonconsensual PvP becomes super oppressive, you will see us defending whale rights. Just because we are defending our playstyles rights against the games health, and it doesn't mean we don't think it would yield a better Eve if whaling was buffed. No, you don't get a monopoly on the ideas which are better for Eve, and people can simultaneously propose such ideas and represent their own playstyles interest. All kinds of nonconsensual PvP have bled a lot, and that's half the reason why nullsec is stagnant af. It's only good for the game if people actually argue for these playstyles, while yours actually get more representation than it deserves.
---
Even the most open minded CSMs, which I think you are one, are unable truly step out of nullseccer shoes and defend all other playstyles, and argue for nerfs to yours when needed. I am glad I am elected and bringing at least the hunting sides perspective there, and still even that is too much for many nullseccers. 
---
We are a legitimate part of this game, we will do our best to keep our playstyle legitimate, and we think it will be better for the game too.
---
As somebody who sells a lot of rare skins on the market, this is good with me :-)
---
Now that you mentioned 3d ships, I have yet another thing to buy... That's so good.
---
You're not wrong but neither is OP.
---
I mean, if by "they" you mean The Mighty Beans and other risk-averse "wormholers" then sure.
---
But if by "they" you mean wormholers as a whole, then no. We've been wanting more challenge since wormholes were a thing.
---
The reason local could go down is that is was infrastructure based, dscan is akin to directed radar, therefor there is nothing to stop it, else it already wouldn’t work in weird places like deadspace and wormhole systems with effects.
---
If dscan is such a powerful tool and gives so much easy free intel why don't nullseccers use it to avoid being combat probed?
---
Who was the dictor that bubbled the corms for the second bomb run? Around 1:15 in the video. Very good job there.

I took it as a good sign the day I decided to come back after my break we had a lot of action.

Congrats  you earn the medal for the dumbest comment !  Real man don’t hide! There are people out there that actually pvp they don’t rely on 20-30 pilots to get a kill

Keep your head up! Really good and interesting AAR. I looked at zkill and saw the sytem and was wondering wtf was the reason for a fight all the way up there. Typical iron though, very grumpy bunch.
---
You all gave it a go surprised they didnt ask init to show up since you used more than one capital.
---
I see this as an issue why wouldn’t players fly sub caps ? Not everyone is skilled up to rorq and Bullard should not be only for super pilots and rorqs right?
---

---
100% but you have to have a fair chance to react and the reaction should not be dock up and wait it should be based on your skill as pilot

Only if you can get off?
---
Haha guess I should have expected an answer like this from the typical eve player.
---
But that's too much work.
---
Buy a Astero, play lost in space and splash around the galaxy for relic/data, and sleeper catches, hope you like scanning(I do, very relaxing), alternately do the same thing in a Prospect looking for gas, bring depot for that, you can’t fit two huffers, a cloak, and a probe launcher at once.
---
Ccplease +1 high slot on prospect.
---
Or if you have good skills and a wad of isk, run abysmal sites, blitz missions, run incursions/invasions.
---
I don’t have a lot of experience with FW, but it’s my understanding it’s great if you just want to blow up/get blown in in t1 frigs on demand.

---
VPN was just an example, I haven't checked if I could buy Omega for something other than Euro without VPN, but I sure could with it.
---
So those 27% are mainly coming from WHs? I would say thats a huge problem since WHs dont have half the numbers of NS which means isk/capita pure faucet wise is much higher in WHs than in NS. Yet I dont see you even mentioning changes to this?
---
Any change to NS needs to be in bigger context. It needs a total revamp. Truesec ratings are obsolete and I dont really see any good reason for them to even be in the game anymore. Remove it and just make all systems equal. Remove unused anoms cause literally, no one uses them outside of raising indexes. Change DEDs accordingly. Remove faction loot wherever possible and make them all equal across NS. We dont need different types of modules that all do the same yet are named differently cause of which region they dropped in. Keep the names perhaps but fix so that the market acknowledges them as the same. 
---
To lower the faucet you only need to make sure that only a specific amount of people can live in a system. So for instance, only 1 active super at a time/system, 5 active Rorqs, just an example. This will force people to spread out and will hurt large alliances far more than smaller ones. This weakens umbrellas, intel, faucets and so on. 
---
But, changing NS bounty dramatically will only ensure that people will not make isk there. That lowers the amount of ships that can be considered content and will only depopulate NS further. There is a reason why we are here today, CCP wanted people out in NS but never really iterated. And making loot drop instead of isk to raise risk in NS isnt good, most blocs have excellent logistical services so the risk is negligable to them but high for smaller groups without them. And in general it wont really create any real risk and will be unobtainable by most PvPers. Pretty much only serves CODE and no one else.
---
And for the love of god, give LS something.
---
Thank you:)
---
Haha bomber man himself ;) keep doing the good work you are doing man. that just helps to make my point stronger. We are from the same coalition and it’s great to see you run those bomber fleets.
---
Don't fool yourself, you will end up with a fleet of Rorquals and a super umbrella to protect them.
---
hm..it would be interesting to see what they could do with a battlefleet gothic style game,   where mining ships have a role.
---
Your New Idea is a Bad Idea. 
---
Nothing more needs to be said.
---
you should think more about this : 
---
 For now, my metrics on major issues will be these:  
---
– *Will this change get more people to login and spend time in EVE?*  
---
– *Will this change lead people to stop logging in and quit EVE?*  
---
– *Will this change lead to more new players starting in EVE and staying for the long term?* 
---
and not about your playstyle wich you want to make better
---
**)**
---
They already collect dust and rust.
---
Honestly man? Wait a bit o see how the blackout thing goes. If it remains I recommend you move back to HS and do just that. Whenever you arent making isk try out faction warfare (dont join corps tho case it will make it hard for you in HS) or any low sec group to get into the flow of things. Lots of fun. In time you can move back to NS but right now that requires lots of skill points and SP to even make it a decent living/long term planning.
---
Some others here have given good advice but in the end, you need to be able to enjoy the game. If you dont in NS, dont secondguess your feeling, just move. Eve is a huge game and lots of good stuff in it.
---
I'm assuming I would be in wormhole space for the gas mining? I do find mining to be relaxing but never did gas/ice/moon mining so I actually would be interested in that style of play. 
---
I know nothing of wormholes, how to get to them and navigate through/out of them. I guess some research is needed now :/
---
You could join pandemic horde to get casually into 0.0. There is always (!) a fleet up and a lot of spontaneous fleets and regular strat ops. All fleets are pinged on discord. If you are not into pvp when you are playing, you can do some pve or other things too. I have done that myself the past weeks as a returning player with limited time (but I was always a 0.0 pvp guy in the past).
---
But the patch was supposed to fix this bug!!!
---
It came out in 2003.

B is probe scan, V is d scan
---
Lol, you have heard of timezones?
---
Umm newsflash - I am not speaking out of my ass on this.  I AM one of the people in charge of 50 pairs of jump gates (you can guess where) - we don't run into this issue, because we have devised policies to account for very heavy usage of jump gates, and have designed tools to track the usage correctly.  It's a hell of a lot easier to design a process to account for such usage than to exert the mental effort to deal with the few people who do put large ships through willy nilly.
---
you could also be perma aligned..
---
While an interesting idea, I think this only increases the tedium, not the chaos.
---
Are hunters going to warp to every anom in the system? No, they'll just go out to nullsec.

&gt; Just because I am defending my playstyle's rights, it doesn't mean I am doing so against the game's health.

I wouldn't nerf subcap mobility honestly.

Sounds like you have a pretty good attitude about the whole thing, and props for taking the fight when most groups wouldn't have, especially dropping the dreads. At least you're not a pet living in denial about being a pet while dropping your supers on newbies with impunity because the people you totally aren't pets of won't drop on you.

---
&gt; And by the way nullsec mega coalitions are -the- vocal minority of this game and in Reddit. Not the other way around. I don't get at all when nullsec leaders complain about the "vocal Reddit minority" when Reddit is literally null linemember haven. When an antinull idea gets upvoted, it happens despite the typical Reddit inclination, not because of it. To be visible, antinull ideas have to be really smart and defended very thoroughly, while any false null narrative can be tribal upvoted on this subreddit. Meanwhile, 7 or 8 empire builder CSM is getting CCP ear every year, while the null empire population is lower than that. That IS the very definition of a vocal minority.

Try frigs, battle cruisers and cruisers. If flying a cruiser, choose something fast and nano (navy omen!). If cheaper, the stabber will be fine or a blaster thorax. If choosing a BC, trying something like the brutix or myrmidon. Go fly into a 0 sec like syndicate. It would be good if you join a small scale Corp which helps you learning pvp with micro and small gangs too.

---
Null was boosted so far and we lost lots of pvpers. Almost like there needs to be a balance.
---
Besides, you don't know what percentage of null is a "pvp player" or you dont know how much these pvp players contribute to CCPs bottom line, compared to pve players. But as a hint, the player who PLEXes his accounts with the riches of null PvE is only as valuable as the PvP player who pays $ for that PLEX. If you get rid of the PvP side, you'll end up with inflated PLEX and lesser profits for CCP.
---
Thats a really good bombing run, no doubt about it.
---
But i love the FC comment about a slave pod, when it was in fact initiative that lost a slave pop in the Big battle prior to the bomb run :)
---
 https://zkillboard.com/kill/78404235/
---
Butters! Are you watching boobies again?
---
Make it so you land 1,000,000km off the cyno, and have a 60 second no-warp and no cloak penalty. 
---
Being able to jump heaps far, *with precision* is a huge design problem with jump drives. Far more than the ability to make repeated jumps. When not dropping on something, the cyno has the supreme ability to position itself in relative safety. And when you *are* dropping on something, dropping en masse also gives you relative safety.
---
I would not have called it a big battle, since INIT showed up late and did not really participate in a brawl. 
---
But yes, that's the reason that slave pods got mentioned. Getting a slave pod killed on the other side would win us the ISK war. But since we got a few eagles in the prior bomb run we still went home ISK positive I believe.
---
As a question, wouldn't it be easier just to have a rota of people whose job it is to go around and refuel the gates on a regular basis?
---
Like, gas stations get their fill ups on a weekly basis, regardless of whether or not their fuel tanks are actually empty.
---
I mean, if there are people who find mining rewarding (I kinda fit into that crowd) then it shouldn't be too hard to find people who find being a space trucker rewarding.
---
And on that I agree. But monotony is also relative. And that aside: the real danger with automating tasks is the centralization of wealth. If a single individual can manage all the affair of say a large moon pos empire, then there is no need for everyone else. Of course, the need arises when someone wants to tear down you isk printer to put up their own, so you need soldiers. But what then? You think all that wealth will just trickle down into the pockets of the unwashed masses? It never has, never really. I've watched small alliances play the part of willing lap dogs while the leadership just gets fat. The best system is a mercantile system which encourages the flow of goods and currency, and uses that flow to feed the coffers of the alliance. That way, the prosperity of the members directly leads to the prosperity of the alliance.
---
Gotta be a ruse
---
So to fuck everyone over that has played for then 3 days , sounds like a great idea
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77995558/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77995558/) 
---
You aware you killed what seems to be their JF midpoint just a couple days ago?
---
One of those things is far more versatile than the other.
---
Probably Feisty Falcon, an alt of Arisene Shi.
---
Only about five years late on that one.
---
ohh man, thats so nice, it became part of the game it self.  
---
Ty good SR/MRS for sharing this piece of history
---
Let's be honest tho, the bug makes it look pretty sick.
---
Just wait for eve echoes
---
Yea, there is gas in null as well but I haven’t sought it out.
---
Mining it is a bit different, when you scan down a WH gas site, you have 15-20min to harvest as much as you can before drifters show up and you start probing for another site, or a new system.
---
To get started in wormholes, get yourself in a fresh empty clone, buy a Imicus, fit this:
---
[Imicus, Cheap cuz ur gonna die]
---
Prototype Cloaking Device I
---
Core Probe Launcher I
---
Cargo Scanner I
---
Data Analyzer I
---
Relic Analyzer I
---
5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
Inertial Stabilizers I
---
Nanofiber Internal Structure I
---
Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I
---
Hornet EC-300 x4
---
Hobgoblin I x4
---
Core Scanner Probe x16
---
Fly out to space away from busy places and start probing for wormholes, find one, go through, BOOKMARK THE WORMHOLE ON THE OTHER SIDE!!!, warp off to a random celestial at 30-70km, launch probes, cloak, scan all the things, get dscan in it own window, hit V every 5 seconds to watch out for other ships.
---
Try the relic sites, you will need to read the eve university article on wormhole classes and relic sites, as warping to the wrong site will result in the loss of your ship at the hand of the sleepers.
---
I recomend the first time you go out to just keep going down the holes, see how far you can get or what weird places in the galaxy you pop out in, accept that you will likely die by cloaky gank ships, when that happens, convo them and tell them what you where up to, people like me and my corpmates will totally be stoked about a new jspace pilot and probably refund your ship.
---
Then my eve addiction finally would be over and I can quit since I no longer have any thing invested in the game 🙌🏽
---
Yea but some years ago, one 60day ETC was worth two old plex and still much cheaper then 1000plex and still could be sold on the market... current plex is only for the vanity shop
---
They do!?
---
I'm in a hub with manufacturing in neighboring system.
---
Well.. yeah.
---
Thank you.
---
For the record, if you are already scraping logs, anyone you see enough to recognize their name jumping a cap can have their LO cost increased via acl. Set offenders to 1000 isk or something oppressive they will either stop or justify the cost.
---
Multi trillionare arent coming fron bounties...
---
5. He killed himself. And hi didn't hit that vexor.
---
So who ended up winning? Team10 or 20?
---
It’s takes about a week to train PI skills to a decent level. PI is passive and lets you earn a couple hundred mill a month just making p2 that you only have to check twice a week or so. That should give you a pretty decent pvp fund for t1 ships and such. I would recommend making fuel block pi as it will sell well in 0.0
---
Think of all the assets people have poured their real life money into, just going up in flames. The madness.
---
Doubt it. Just look at adms
---
Give wormholes a look at. You can make decent isk from C3 ratting. It keeps you on edge having to be alert, plenty to click on and hones your game skillls. Ir possibly join a WH corp?
---
fuck i had like 9k at some stage
---
inflation is a problem for years now but if you cut down money making mechanics you will lose a lot of player really fast 
---
and if you add isk sinks many players going to cry 
---
inflation is the biggest problem in eve 
---
ps: befor we push any playstile in null ccp should do something about FW
---
3-D was a mistake. Team10 till I die.
---
Well.... I adapted some for a mini game called Full Thrust and having a line of Apocs can get really expensive really quick. 
---
I need to print out some other ships and try to adapt those, maybe the Typhoon or Maelstrom.
---
Why? It would just be the last 15 years in fast forward. You'd just have a stagnant game again but in a fraction of the time.
---
Used to do that with a Maurasi Azbel that undocked to Jita gate.
---
Except we would not start all over again. You can't erase multiple years of experience playing the game and the groups that formed over the years. You also can't erase the custom tools those groups have come up with to circumvent the lacking UI.
---
All the guys that go "a reset will fix everything" also forget that Goonswarm having the biggest Trasher/Hurricane/Tempest fleet is the same thing as them having the biggest titan fleet, because you will be limited to the same ships.
---
Here is how different groups would handle the reset most likely:
---
* Your average highsec carebear, that just runs lvl 4 and incursions to see the wallet go up: Most likely will quit or start the grind again
---
* Established nullsec groups like Goonswarm, TEST, NCPL: The subscriptions on the accounts are still running, so multibox all the way in Ventures, extract some of those pilots to get a Rorqual asap, then continue until Rorqual fleet is back up, continue for Titans.
---
* Wormholes: Same a null groups, start farming sleepers in Drakes, extract/inject until you can farm in Dreads again.
---
* Lowsec: This is where we will most likely see the most changes, since the PvP heavy groups will most likely try to get a hold in null as well, until they realise that the big null groups still have more numbers.
---
* Highsec groups: Nothing will change, only the ships get smaller until skills are back up.
---
So in the end, we will roughly end up were we are now (maybe a bit of sov changes), not to mention a large portion of the player base will be gone.
---
Yes.
---
That was implemented with killmarks.
---
Only shows on Shader High settings.
---
It collects over time since first boarding the ship purely based on time and can be cleaned off in the ship skin menu.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the advice I'll definitely look into it more. I also appreciate the fit too
---
^ This is the guy that cares about you and gives you good usable advice.
---
Winnie Blues and VB Crew,
---
Mekwell is a fantastic CEO and FC, can't speak highly enough of them,
---
Also obligatory where is Swiftly!?
---
it is a feature!
---
Not familiar with C3 ratting. I'm assuming I'd get into wormhole space and scan down a particular site? Also what type of ship would I be looking to do that with?
---
I'd unsub and never come back.
---
Here is a much better table for comparison - https://steamdb.info/app/695740/
---
They used to have more regions with lower prices, but slowly moving to $14.99/month for everyone (except Europe of course because you can just swap currency symbol in front and silly Europeans wouldn't notice /s). 
---
I was expecting them to update prices in Russia and Argentine this year. Quite puzzled by GB price tho.
---
&lt;3
---
Thanks for the quick explanation of the steps :)
---
Too many people don't see the work involved.
---
I recently returned aswell with limited time slots due to studies. I’ve been spending most times in an assault frigate fit for pvp doing lowsec anomalies/ded sites and leeching LP/stealing loot in highsec invasion systems. Makes me travel around alot and opens up interesting opportunities with other players on the fly.
---
Geez.
---
Blue Ice is the best FC I've ever flown under.
---
The best organised was probably Gradient.
---
Most intense was Brave in Raha, especially wormhole day tripping.
---
Brave in Catch 2.0 was probably the best all-round.
---
It could also be Super and Titan hunting while in transit, the issue being anchoring.
---
Talking about spelling is usually the first sign that your conversation partner is unable to prove his crap :-D I am sorry, my keyboard is a bit broken and english isn't my first language.

Just compare what daddy mittani promised to everybody when you did your tidi moveop to what you actually achieved and you will see the truth in my post.
---
Btw I think your quote is from Bill Murray
---
Lj
---
That always go well!
---
They need to be a bit more precise on what they are exactly talking about.
---
From my point of view Rorqs are too easy now.   And I never used Rorqs, I just have a number on my killboard.   With the blackout I would suggest that CCP make them tougher.   But that is my opinion of course.
---
Yesss let the mega coalitions win even faster there
---
In theory you can't jam if you get damped regardless of what you target if you are close enough to jam under damps you are close enough to be taken of field.
---
We need a losec gate to Venal.
---
Because, you know, trolling.
---
I don't know how, but this is Jintaans fault.
---
Thank you ccp for making the change.
---
Congratulations on well executed andcost efficient bombing run! Single bomb costs 1.1\~ mil isk while 1 corm costs 12\~ mil isk (and capsules worth at random 10k-10 mil isk according to zKill).
---
So it’s fine cause it doesn’t happen to you every day? The counter is having a spy in their fleet or have cloaked defenses all the times. Emergent gameplay.
---
Dude, we don't even crit the holes for krabbers. The Rorqs and Shaks are bait. It makes it so much more fun because the content just delivers itself.
---
&gt;[...] The galaxy of New Eden has just seen the opening salvos of its first ever anime war. Understandably, it has the entire galaxy wondering where the hell things went so wrong for the hardcore space MMO.

They don’t have to camp they can be in 200 systems with in a minute and nobody sees them moving round.
---
Maybe i am, but at least i am an honest dick.
---
NP, exploration, PVP/PVE, and resourcing via wormholes is my whole deal, message me with any WH specific questions.
---
I think it could shake some things up in regards to it being the perfect time to splinter off, as it would break the inertia of the current arrangements.
---
But yeah, for many it would not totally change things.
---
Oh hey there fellow bulgarian o/

Word from a FIGL bro
---
It's been raised a number times in the past.
---
It's all about raising it at a time when theres people and appetite available to do something about it. (Hence why it kept being brought up) 
---
Unfortunately ccp dont have infinite dev time. So theres always going to be priorities.
---
Offenders should get gate blocked by ACL for 3 days.
---
Delve is goon, anime is cartoon.
---
Time, mostly.
---
It takes time to fix stuff, and not just from one person.
---
It was the point of the ship when we still knew they were there and could plan accordingly. Now planing is a waste of time so no counter can be prepared for. All you are left with is baiting all the time cause once a month something might happen.
---
OwO

&gt;"дебилы" - 7 раз

Красиво. В остальном неплохо, щущуть сыграл в голос
---
It's also a good source of small fights in lowsec
---
There are gated sites which restrict ship class. So you can go wait in one (and make some lp if noone turns up) and get someone in a similar ship class turn up to fight. Or go round them looking for someone doing this.
---
Goon's don't run into the issue cause they've crabbed so god damn hard "resources" mean nothing to them.
---
'Should' is generally a bad word in computer science.
---
I just assume Rorquals specifically. After all, ORE names their big ships after types of whale and I'd be more surprised to see an Orca, Porpoise, or Bowhead in Null.
---
Make no changes unless it fixes everything!!!!eleventyone!!!
---
Blergh.

NC told us if we didn't kick him, we were done for. We made the smart decision.

its the same everywhere. 30 days is 14.99 US$ or 19.99 US$ for 500 PLEX

Camera is already broken. Changing itself to look at, free move or stuck on one target and u cant move it.

lol retard in dread with t1 siege
---
I did not make any claim that one should be able to mine and rat in peace in null-sec (and I have no expectation that should be the case). However, it is clear that mining and PVE are greatly down across most of null-sec, whilst it would seem that PVP activity has remained relatively constant (that is certainly my experience), therefore I think that it is difficult to argue that the black-out has not favoured the people who like shooting other ships over other activities. That is certainly the message that one gets from many posts on reddit etc.
---
My PVP is mainly small gangs, with occasional mid-size fleets and a bit of solo stuff. What I most enjoy is a small group of us taking on a larger fleet and having a good fight. For me PVP is tackling players who are in PVP ships, where there is a good chance that I will die (and if I do, learning from the experience). I am not particularly interested in padding killboard stats by killing a ratter or a miner. If you had read my post carefully, you would see that I did not say that personally I was put out by the blackout (as stated before it has actually had little influence on much of my activity). What it has impacted on is a number of friends leaving Eve (rather than relocating to HiSec).
---
It is interesting what you say how about CCP thinking that there is a fair chance that the game is finished, and perhaps this is a stronger angle on the concern that I raised that CCP may be looking to cash in now, but that may be to the longer term detriment of Eve as a whole or at least to a significant proportion of the Eve community.
---
Lavacore is best avatar skin &lt;3
---
I'm sorry but are you complaining about 30-40 man gangs even though you're a null seccer who chooses to be in 1000+ tidi laden blobfests?
---
:P
---
Or look okay it another way- look around you and see who is crying. :)
---
plex or skins
---
This.        
---
Like honestly i am asking recently myself why i keep playing EVE.       
---
I am one of those unlucky ones that lost the flock they where hunting on because of blackout.          
---
But i guess there is hope, as after years i am finally skipping the cycling of my passive income sources and logging in less and less as my content died out.           
---
Who knows maybe stain will not have the lowsec gate after all.
---
Why did you quit? If it was anything ingame related, then do the opposite.
---
What keeps me going is supporting a pvp group by doing industry and pvp myself.
---
Everyone needs to find their playstyle. If you enjoy krabbing (getting rich of the environment), then do that. If you don't enjoy that, do something else.
---
Maybe PI is for you? If done correctly it'll feed you enough ISK to pvp in s and m sized ships, if you don't lose all the time and not "bling" it.
---
You know that the problem is in injectors.
---
Thanks for being honest and letting us know that this change has nothing to do with you listening to the player base who had been asking for this for years.
---
just make it a module so JFs can't fit, would also allow the use of the timer for the module and require a major refit after jumping to prevent usage for hot drop
---
Killing shit is not an ISK sink though, infact it is more of a faucet if those shit was insured.
---
Iam retarded cause no one uses 250 arty.
---
And i was wrong laugh on me no probs. 
---
But who ist the retard who tells someone orbiting with arty?
---
Thats the real retard thing you brick
---
I think the only way around this is to create a child, and have them play for you.
---
This falls under account sharing though, so you'd still eat a ban.
---
I am not complaining i am suggesting an approach and looking for opinions because i have identified it as an issue while playing both PVE and PVP. I do like the blackout personally because it hurts effortless intel that is great. It also pushes team play another great aspect of it. However while cloaks were bearable with local they are very hard to counter without it now. It is good to allow a tactic to be countered and at this stage this only works for capital ships and not every pilot is a capital pilot. If the drive is to make nullsec cap pilots only when it comes to Indy than it is working.
---
Is making decent isk/h you’re main goal in itself or just a means to have more time to do something else?
---
Oh thats right, thats where it comes from. I just assumed from what the whaling fleets do as Rorqs and supers are their main target.
---
If the blackout is to stay the excavs are at high risk. They can barely be used. The rorq however I feel is okey, it was never meant to survive alone and as long as the PANIC is still around I feel its okey. But dunno.
---
And the cost of those license tokens should exponentially rise, the more citadels are anchored in a system in player owned sovs. Those tokens should be non tradeable and only be sold by NPC.
---
Drones.           
---
Gila is pretty damn good ship.
---
Its on now!
---
Hey does anyone here know whether the myrmidon has a fit that can solo c3 sleeper sites (I'm an alpha) or maybe a dominix fit. Would there even be an alpha fit for any ship that is able to do c4 combat sites perhaps? Or is that just not possible solo (for alpha im asking about)
---
like how you missed ops suggestion completely and instead went on a tangent about shitty &amp; frustrating mechanics that wouldnt fix anything
---
CCP needs to think about the small to medium sized alliances trying to keep up with the big boys.   At this point they are truly screwed.    I remember the early period and they were real beasts to take down, that is what small and medium sized alliances need to have.   From my point of view balancing the game around the Goons is seriously dumb and will destroy Eve, even if the Goon superiority will do it anyway.
---
This should give you a few pointers: [https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/planetary\_interaction](https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/planetary_interaction)
---
A casual small gang PVP corp that shut down a while back because CCP forced you to have more and more numbers to actually accomplish anything. 
---
We didn't want to do any sort of open recruitment and ruin our culture and skill level, so we just shut it down as most people got bored of the tryhard jaguar + haw Titan + super carrier meta.
---
It's honestly the only group I've been in where nobody has made me feel uncomfortable, and where I've had confidence in everyone's abilities except that /u/dunamara idiot.
---
Do t1 frigate abyssal solo. I can do them in a kestrel in about 10-15 mins per 3 rooms and they pay a minimum of 10nil per full run. The fit I use is about 10mil u just need good missile skills for it.
---
It gets even better when u use a hookbil or worm as u can solo them even faster and make more money
---
If they don't want to fight - why are they in fw and sitting in a fw plex?
---
What kind of fkn retared joins a perma war and then says they want to use warp stabs because they dont want to fight?
---
They should also ban the ship that will replace the Venture. And then the ship that will replace the replacement of the Venture. and so on.
---
Autism
---
Isnt Gila a pve ship ? So drones is the best weapon to go , i have light drone operation to 5 do i go for support skills or medium and heavy drones
---
Look, I get it, achieving more in a game than you do in real life must be a bitter pill to swallow but being an insulting douche really isn't going to make up for that. Do some night classes or something, throwing out insignificant, infant-level insults really won't help.
---
Did you ask them how it’s going?
---
Gila is good for both, please look at it’s description, it gets bonuses to medium drones, turning two medium drones into super drones.
---
So if you are going to use a Gila, train medium drones and all the support skills up.
---
Except all the established alliances would have the infrastructure and knowledge/ plans already in place
---
I think the topic of wcs goes beyond fw, bud. And I'm fairly certain they're allowed to do what they want how they want. 
---
If they want to sit in a Plex and chill gain lp and warp off before getting killed, I think. . . And I'm not 100% but I'm pretty sure they can do whatever the hell they want. There's no rule against it. No module restrictions upon activating the gate. 
---
But mentioning that.... Great idea, honestly. No joke. Why isn't this a thing?
---
Think of the upside - Youll have to get good at pvp now instead of having a stabbed alt soak up the dps.
---
Trust me i know.
---
Yeah - Rise has basically admitted 'We don't listen to you cunts at all - but this effected our income sooo yeah now it matters'
---
&gt;If it’s anything like cloaked vessels 
---
It's probably not.  The chat server is it's own thing.  Granted, I have no idea if there's any truth to the bot claim, but given how much of a clusterfuck it's been, it's not inconceivable.
---
Hey I agree fully with you. Everyone is so stuck on the thought of what goons do that no one else in the game matters. Funny thing is that exact way of thinking is why goons became as big as they are. 
---
But from the perspective of small/medium sized ye I can totally see Rorqs needing buffs. But I honestly dont see how that would work against full fleets. They will die in the end no matter. I think the game rather needs new options and nerfing the rorq or atleast its scaleability will allow for subcap mining to become premier choice again. 
---
But that doesnt work with the blackout so its back to small/medium being rekt. But I would personally love it excavators were removed and some form of input required for the drones +better boosts so Rorqs become on grid boosters instead of premier mining ships. Like they were supposed to be 3 years ago. And ofc remove the blackout as well. 
---
That way there are still options for small/mediums to catch up.
---
I don't believe you. u/cruftbox would never allow that to happen.
---
While you are at fixing lowsec, it still needs this gate to Stain
---
you have to scan the entrance of the WH but inside, it's just combat anomaly like in NS. except they don't respawn, you have to find a new WH  
---
WH Pve holy Bible --&gt; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#
---
i wsnt 100% sure, i thought what i put was correct, i appreciate the correction, done in a much nicer manner than you could of.
---
Im happy in my current corp, great people, active and healthy. But my heart will always belong to the Space Ants corp. It is recruiting btw, join today!
---
Yeah, where's the problem ? More capital kills, big ISK losses and some cunts getting yelled at for being, well, cunts.
---
And between dying on a jumpgate, a cyno or a stargate, the end result is the same : a dead capital, and a person that feel very very dumb.
---
does that change the fact that heavy missiles are the 'artillery' version of the weapon choice? nop
---
and missiles can, with the correct fit, and a target painter (there is a reason they reach such long ranges) they can apply better than guns can apply at a high angular velocity target.)
---
the issue i see is tackle can fly directly towards a missile bound target, faster they go the better, whereas against a turret type long range weapon they need to circle in keeping their angular velocity up as high as they can taking overall MUCH longer to reach their target
---
Aby news about blackout ?
---
Gila is both but more pve. Drones are always the best weapon system since most ships can use them. Get up some support skills and training medium to 5 is always a good choice. Heavy drones are kinda shit so you dont need them to 5, same goes for sentry unless you fly PvE rattlesnake alot.
---
As for other systems, wait until you move to your new corp. They usually have doctrines so train those. But in general, weapon systems depend on what your playstyle is. Really hard to give you any solid advice unless we know what you want it for.
---
Gila is PVE and PVP monster.            
---
It is caldari + galente hybrid that use drones and missiles so it is natural first thing you want to cross train if you are gallente or caldari.
---
end-of-line was a great Corp back in 2012-2014, damn that failed alliance with Sky Fighters!
---
Also Yagamata Syndicate is great as well.
---
I literally just jump gated a cap with adequate scouts etc. Why would a corp fine people for this? It's their ship no? They can do whatever they want.
---
Oh now I get it, ignore my earlier response.
---
you can fit a thorax to hit 100km (maybe a little further) and it will apply damage, but reduced damage. it will hit instantly but angular velocity is a thing.
---
you can fit a caracal to hit past 100km, but its around there, rig it to apply well. and fit a target painter, and it will hit for just as much damage as in any case. but you get missile travel time, everything in the game has its pro's and con's but thats eve, difference is hard to balance but theyve done a pretty good job so far at it.
---
i struggle to see a thorax getting the same applied dps than a caracal would at 100km. (the reason i use thorax is because that is BjornBee's choice of ship for is very effective frog fleet of booshers, showing its a good ship for the job) he doesnt use caracals because of the missile travel time, but if you can accept the travel time, maybe fit to reduce the travel time (use orthrus or rigs or mid slots to increase missile speed.) then all of a sudden you have a very high dps, cruiser sniper fleet :D) jackdaws work, but thats light missiles, youll be surprised how fast you can get a heavy missile to fly
---
Some skills aren't working at the moment, people have noticed missile specialisation but that could mean alsorts of skills aren't working..
---
Skill injectors would certainly be the biggest problem (and pay to win, since there would be no PLEX on the market), but even without them, we would only have \~200 days until the first pilots can fly titans again.
---
ITT people say what weapon system and people reply with an exact hull to train for.
---
About time :) Hoping breath and hoping for more positive changes!
---
A few months ago I was roaming in a svipul in PH space. Saw some t1 frig on dscan that didnt seen to move and combat probed it out. Ended up this ship was left abandoned inside the sun. 
---
Always wondered how that person managed to keep the ship there without it getting shot out.
---
Ehh, what. Current plex can be used as gametime, be sold for isk and used as currency in the NES
---
Actually much less if you play the smart way, and after this you will have just flood of all rich people injecting into big ships again.
---
This could leed to some sick stuff. I want SKINs that have effects when the ship gets shot or SKINs that vary depending on the speed the ship has etc. The art team at CCP is probably their best division.

I just went with the EVE-Uni numbers for the hull, which is without implants and remaps, but you also have to train the weapons or fighters
---
Thank you all i will make gila as my objective . I can fly it now but the skills to fly it nicely i will train them all ty
---
Would rather cut jumpgates. Bad for the game when people aren't moving through space because free instant safe travel.
---
in think my old CEO would approve of these leadership choices
---
For me, it was when I was in The Kadeshi. Main alliance FC was Mirko Spetz
---
Do you guys recommend a fit for gila i shud work towards?
---
try scouting in nullsec a 300man bomber fleet cloaked off a gate in blackout. yous sir, live in lowsec
---
Ahhh, it's the same dishonest Grath we know and love.
---
So. Grath. Tell me how, in a subcap, you survive being dropped on ?
---
The problem is, you can not really leave EVE.
---
Sure you can play something else for a while and even enjoy it, but at some point you find yourself thinking: This is all nice, but it's not like in EVE where my actions and decisions matter and have an impact and there is no second universe where players are able to do the exact same thing that I did without facing *me* first.
---
9/10 times you can do that with you're Dscan 10 times faster
---
lol
---
You probably should have kept looking for wormholes back to high or low sec.
---
for simple travel, w-space tends to be safer than nullsec because there aren't clear and obvious chokepoints to camp.
---
its not fucking around with caps or money, its time and bother, some human has to endlessly refill the ansiblex gate with LO. as capitals are jumped through them. they simply just dont want you to use the ansiblex, like, the ship has a jump drive, jump your own ass with the own fuel xD
---
answers to would it be nice for a complete reset....
---
Short answer: no.
---
long answer: no, fuck off with your stupidity.
---
Injectors.      
---
You have $ make 50 accounts and make your own skill farm.      
---
The moment you get to the 5mil sp on all those accounts (you use buddy pack) and get 100 injectors.
---
They attacked the faucet by increasing the danger of ratting (subcaps especially) by a large factor. As well the volume of minerals mined. With less minerals mined, less ships are being built, less ships are being destroyed (in addition to the less people out ratting/mining leading to further less ships destroyed), so overall less insurance payouts (the one way you can turn minerals into an ISK faucet).
---
best corp was CMR. It was me and two friends doing faction warfare, and god the amount of fun extracted from CMR shenanigans I still think about to this day.
---
Alliance-wise. Bow Down. 
---
dudes were chill yet knew when to get serious, our pocket in etherium was nice and active and we could always pair up with unspoken for those big fights.
---
But then supers couldn't be caught ratting. They'd only ever be used to drop on people and generate salty posts here.
---
100% awesome, prime fun there.
---
Sweet you made it through null, I would have splashed around till I found a HS static.
---
The bubbles were launched by interdictors, they prevent warp inside them.
---
Ye that's a fairly rare bug, sometimes a ship  docked in a citadel would just teleport to the sun, or the last stargate it took. Happened all the time when citadels were just added but CCP fixed it. Not completely though apparently.
---
What's the ISK like on that gas?
---
I honestly think INIT. are much better than Goonswarm in many ways, and I've been in both.
---
work payout in Russia starting from 250 euro per month and you dont get any benefits from state. How much in euro or usa?
---
He’d have about 25mil in his ship

---
fit probe scanner to your venture, otherwise awsome story  
---
i started out gas huffing too then moved on to exploration. placed my account that way  
---
now when i could be bothered or i really need isk i rat in a dread. got to pay for all the ships i welp somehow.  
---
fly safe m8
---
well i disagree with automated moon instead of mining people go out and fight for those moon, that make conquest interesting (it's not actually) because right now if you don't have the capacity to mine X moon per month well you don't need to attack territory, all the wars happening are only for the content year ago moon wars was a reality   
---
and i'm pretty confident with that because that happen to us, we don't need to attack moons even if they are X jump away just because we can't mine them, big bloc have their "automated mining" (renter) we can't afford that, bring back automated moon and you will see big bloc and small group attacking everything (they made an oligopoly year agor, soo make them weak and force them to stay here to protect them)  
---
you can lower the yield or just make them refine with base stat, but in order to bring more war and PvP alliance you can't make them mine
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Sounds like I have to give up salvaging for a living.
---
I know it keept me hook up for years.        
---
But now when i join my corp comms people mostly not talk about eve, but other games.      
---
So who knows.        
---
TBH when i think how much stuff i need to move around before going afk ^(aka if i decide to go back at some point ... like i have those assets waiting)             
---
But honestly i don't know if i want to go or not.        
---
EvE is fun and this blackout is good thing need to just find something fun for me
---
Rote always was pussies, jokes aside, this is actually spot on
---
From Eve-U, I used B-Type amps, and Cal Navy extenders, you need good shield skills, and Caldari cruiser IV/V (hull bonus)this does most C3 combat sites slowly.

Goons have a special ACL for People who jump gate caps, you pay about 1000 times as much as regular goons.
---
That's a thing other alliances could do.
---
&lt;3 this
---
ill be honest, with blackout and some other changes hopfully comming, good or bad, work or not, i can handle breaking the game, its laughable when the game is fun again
---
imho only way to rescue eve

If you can afford to cheap-fit a battleship, you can fit a few faction frigates instead. Fly them around Black Rise looking for people in plexes.

Hi, is this a good time to start Eve now? What's a good up to date guide I could read up on it?
---
Whats dishonest about what I said? Dreddit and Horde both take day old alts into 0.0 and show them how to be useful.
---
So i guess its dumb ass Ian that we all know and love
---
if you hate Hull pen, fml, of all people. how, these dudes are pretty bad and feed pretty often.
---
 i was in their circle jerk with panic and co for a while. panic, awesome dudes, like, you have no idea how cool those dudes are.
---
then Hull pen, the group that will moan about people loosing capitals in a home system, then do nothing but feed capitals while no one else has done, or did do it ever xD 
---
these guys have no clue what theyre doing when they thin they do, which is fine, but they carry an attitude that thinks they are above thier grade.
---
try not caring if your cap gets dumpstered by 300 bombers cause you're not a tryhard shitler and there's plenty more pixels to hop into
---
And here ladies and gentlemen you have Aneu's age old "try and attack the poster personally when i get made to look like the truck stop cocksucker that I am".  Proving your stupidity and ignorance of 0.0 capital fights wasn't insulting.  Its funny you took being proved wrong as an insult though.
---
fit lights for caracal.
---
i love it when people dont understand missiles. they just think they do cos it used to work and doesnt now xD
---
learn the role and balance of missiles and youll see that they are actually on par for smaller gang pvp juuuust fine.
---
actually a 4X Eve Online could be really really cool or an X3 - Eve conflicts idk, build your shit mine with them build bigger toy, solo or online a 4X MMO &lt;3
---
i was in brave about 1 year into my play,
---
surrounded by kamikazee newbros, while i could mop grid up of people travveling to brave to kill some newbeans in my omen navy issue sitting at range. some of the best time ive ever had in eve still today
---
Well, the main thing I guess is the really relaxed way we play the game, there are no obligations, nothing mandatory and everyone is free to do whatever they like without anyone pointing fingers; not even our really rare CTAs are mandatory. 
---
Noone will killboard shame anyone, or get in the way of others playing the game the way they like, having fun is our main and only colective goal here. Most people will go out of their way to help others and everyone is willing to both teach and learn from the rest in a really respectful way.
---
We are a bunch of solo pvpers that band together when the situations calls for it, while at the same time shareing the alliance with mostly PVE focused corps.
---
I don't really know what to add to that, the enviorment is just amazing, and we have everything from hardcorde PVPers that will run around in bliged t1 frigs trying to get +10 solo kills a day to newbros or even alts of people with their mains in NS that just log in from time to time to shoot stuff. Great smallish community to be a part of.
---
How long would it have taken to simply block Ventures from using the in-gates?
---
Tweaking the line of code that sets the ship allowances should not take years to go.
---
The way you acted like Karmafleet and Brave don't exist was classic Grath.
---
Honest people point people to any of the newbie-focussed groups, but Grath is going to Grath.
---
well, that you, not the poster i replied to. i appreciate theres people who want to whelp as much as possable. but for an alliance trying to have newbeans around. having huge capital hunting groups around 24/7 is annoying and bad for business. 
---
one thing to loose capital. its another to loose it, in home territory for nothing but attracting more shit in. or earning a bad name for yourself.
---
i assume you are a lone player, who dunks people for fun isk efficient or not, which i admire, like, that is fun. but in a nullbloc, it is a community, so stop being a retard and think about others around you xD
---
*free intel intensifies*
---
&gt;Only if it’s not a white baby?
---
Have you checked dotlan lately? Do all those empty systems look like content to you?
---
Missile, drones, yeah it will be best for you to invest on Gila. You could go the next step to use Rattlesnake for highclass WH site run.  
---
Gila use Caldari cruiser too, which mean you can have access to a useful ship in WH, the Tengu. The common ship used for exploration in WH.  
---
After Gurista lines of ship, you might want to see the SoE ships later in a year or so. Stuff like Astero, Stratios, and Nestor. Astero is the usual exploration ship, Stratios are like cheaper T3 cruiser for solo hunter PVP. Nestor is the only battleship that can use C1 WH and used for many WH skirmish because of it. Just like Rattlesnake and Domi, Nestor are common ship for spidertanking. There is a blog which use Domis and Nestors for "solo" fleet PVP.  
---
Weapons for those ships? Just neuts/remote cap and remote repairs. in addition of drone skill people suggesting you to learn.  
---
With SoE ships, since you got Gallente skills from Gila, you only need the Amarr cruiser. And you can have Legion as your T3C to choose. Huge number of WH corp using Legion as their core fleet. Its because the flexibility on damage with HAM or neut capability.
---
if horde lost 20capitals and 4 supers a day to a funroam fleet, this guy would be the first dude to laugh at horde and call them shitters. lol

Poi?
---
But now there's friction and drive between the incursion groups. Before it just essentially boiled down to some sort of utility company "oh here's your shield fleet, over there you go your armour". It's too theme-park IMO, and doesn't stick true to other aspects of EVE that are all about competition and drive.
---
Now we're down to a single high-sec spawn, it creates content as opposing groups create friction.
---
Init has that big group feeling but somehow ppm havent become too complacent and its really nice actually
---
Initiative are seen and fight much better than any goonswarm fleet (comming from somone who fights them both alot/enough)
---
i love you ivy league guys, try not joining the imperium side of the fence, fight it :) &lt;3

Only use 280 arties. Don't auto orbit like a pleb, manually pilot its not that hard.

Years ago people had bookmarks in the center of suns or planets, I had one in Querious that would land me withing 5k of the center, so I used to just bounce like you did just for fun.

CCP "fixed" that some time ago, so it's nice to see it's still happening even if by mistake.

The best way to start Solo PvP in eve is invest in cocaine and psychotropic drugs so you dnt self hurt yourself with the amount of sissies this game has.
---
Bend over?
---
Must be why HMLs are so popular (they're not)
---
Pretty sure I understand missiles. That's why I never use HMLs. They have worse raw damage than comparable long range weapons and worse application in virtually all circumstances.
---
It’s definitely more on your toes than moon or anom mining.
---
medium guns, shooting 100km, vs Heavy missiles at 100km.
---
you think the guns are more applied dps to say, an equal cruiser hull. you sir are incorrect
---
 I love Horde... this is one of the awesome place in EVE.
---
Centipede Caliphate.
---
Well I was in lowsec at the time purchasing said capital to move it back to null, since I don't live in the blue donut nor do I have a cap umbrella or defence fleet to call on. Just a couple of scouts and a lonely cap trying to get home. 
---
We certainly do not live in a friendly nullsec space. I was prepping said dread for a capital shit fight we have on tomorrow.
---
Like others have said, you could have just scanned another exit, but then you wouldn't have this memorable adventure, that you'll never forget for as long as you play EVE.
---
Everyone has at least one of these stories, savour it.
---
&gt;try not joining the imperium side of the fence, fight it :) &lt;3
---
Fair enough. There's a reason why I'm trying to see what the options are. I could just apply to KF/Horde/whatever and be in better ISK space by the end of the week. But I'd like to actually figure out which ones I'd want to join instead of that. I've probably talked to more PL people than any other Null alliance and I'm looking for a variety of perspectives.
---
like, i said, do that through busy horde space, or outskirts even. youll be seen. and somone will catch you. youll die before yo can ask for help. and your scouts wouldve seen nothing.
---
while newbeans in horde are in capitals. they are not self conditioned or experianced with capital travel. so they do dumb things. which on the long run ruins it for others somewhat
---
white out
---
Our crews do all the mainteinance needed to keep our ships ready to go... and I'm guessing the technology in EVE is far better than the one we currently have, so its likely it would take longer for it to deteriorate.
---
stabs are pretty common on smartbomb camping/pipebomb ships; the lock time/range penalty is irrelevant on smartbombing sihps, and frequently these ships are fitted with moderately expensive smartbombs, which makes stabs a natural choice to protect them against lone tackle ceptors holding them under gate guns
---
TZ tanking is avoiding fights so your whole post was about avoiding fights....
---
so hilarious LOL
---
First of all, not even range bonused HMLs reach out to 100km so that's kind of a spurious comparison. Second, what the fuck kind of small gang engages at 100km (the answer: a bad one). Third, yes, HML application to cruisers and below (IE most commonly encountered hulls, especially in small gang) is absolutely terrible and relies upon a huge investment into range-bonused webs and painters to apply full DPS in virtually all circumstances. Fourthly, HMLs will not apply full DPS to a cruiser with prop without some kind of ewar assistance, while a turret ship can always manage transversal to apply full DPS, even to an untackled target. Fifthly, since the HML nerf, AFs and HACs have been given sig reduction bonuses which make HMLs even less desirable. Sixthly, you are bad and don't understand missiles or guns or eve online.
---
No it wasnt dont make stupid assumptions.
---
&gt;Being closely associated with Eve Uni means many of the new people come in with a good base knowledge of the game.
---
In my evaluation of potential destinations after the Uni, TGRAD is probably where I'd apply first if I decide that I want to join an Imperium corp simply because I know a few names over there. The good reputation in general also helps.
---
As I pointed in that thread, your idea is not new, just plain retarded. Noone gets salty over that... well, besides you ot seems.
---
&gt;95% of people are risk averse carebears
---
No they're not.
---
For a carebear Goon like him yes they were
---
Which is why you'd be silly to do it in horde space I suppose? Not entirely sure what your point is. Obviously it's not something anyone should do often or anywhere in sov null that isn't their own, but properly fit it should not be an issue once in a blue moon.
---
Team 10 has 2 or so corpses, Team 20 has 17 or so... The war still rages internally to this very day!

You dont do LV4 in HS.  
---
You do triglav stuff in HS. Use the fillament and since you have Gallente skills, train caldari cruiser skill and use cheap Gila and farm tier 2 filaments.  
---
Or you can join the triglav defense once in a while when bored. They quite awesome to fleet up.

Some (post soviet) European countries are closer to Russia in average income than to the Western/Northern Europeans. Still they get to pay in euro which is the most expensive to sub with. Of course they (we) will try to find ways to get better prices.
---
Props for having 100% battery power on your phone!
---
I have tried spidertanking various cruiser, and it works well. It cheapens your fit. and since the NPC hyper aggro on repairs, my drones are ALWAYS left alone.  
---
I have tried to find the minimum limit on it. You can spidertanking Augoror and using drones to run C2. extremely cheap, and you basically ISK tanking when ambushed.  
---
So, since you have two omega like me, try to search on spidertanking your ships. and try them on test server.
---
It's not just that. Likely different areas have different price points. The average american can part with 15 dollars US, easier a russian can part with 1100 rub.

Remember : init has voted for a csm from wh .... :D
---
If you really want to play solo and be nomadic, look at the bowhead. You can fill it with an explorer, a hauler, a salvager, and still have room for ~3 battleships, or many more smaller ships.
---
Solo activities include relic/data sites (wh space or null preferably) running plexes and hoping for an escalation, all flavors of pvp, lvl4 missions, hunting npc haulers for ship skins, even seen people running trig sites solo (saw a 6bil loss posted in local two days ago though so do some research). Abyssal sites. C1 and maybe C2 sleeper sites.
---
Honestly the most fun I've had lately has been with 3 or 4 other people doing pretty much all of the above. You don't have to play with a bunch of people all the time, but if you can find a small handful of people online at the same time as you willing to Have Fun instead of just grind the usual, then a few more options open up, and the ones you have get easier and are much more fun.
---
Yes exactly.
---
You're absolutely right to lay this on us.  We on the graphics team have a specific procedure for checking for this kind of problem before a SKIN goes out, and despite that, we missed this.
---
There are a few reasons that these kinds of mistakes can happen, and we'll be working on fixing those, but take my word that we care greatly about delivering features that work the first time and every time after that.
---
Your only hope is to build in place where people will buy it for more.. But you have to bring materials there too..

To just to stop ships running plex timers while stabbed. They banned the module and players just switched to using ventures because of their native warp core strength bonus.
---
Not OP, where can I find information on what fighters can apply to what kind of ship signature&amp;speed?
---
Or when a known gank scout lands on grid with them.
---
A few weeks ago my scout landed in an astero and three hulks immediately fleet warped, leaving behind all 15 of their augmented mining drones. It was my civic duty to clean up all the litter.
---

didnt know brits could make tanks fly, also since when do the british ground forces serve in the USAF?

Because you don't need to combat probe null sec players. Everyone can warp directly to anomalies.

2 questions about scanning
---
You see a BS on dscan, he also see you and warp to a safe spot and cloak. Can you catch him with combat probes? Like find the place he warped in before he cloaks up? I'm saying BS because it will take time to warp etc.
---
Or is the best bet to warp an interdictor on the BS?
---
Thanks, chief.
---
European prices for a European country. 
---
The country that gets fucked over the most is Belarus. They have to pay 15 euros/month despite having much smaller wages then Russians.
---
Largely unrelated but a potentially useful tip is that if you think there is a camp on a gate ahead but you can't find something close by to warp to to get in directional scan range. Burn out your capacitor so you don't have enough energy to make the warp in one go, rinse and repeat until you land within scan range
---
I'm Russian myself but even I find it weird that in EVE Russians generally not frowned upon for using our native language in front of people who don't understand it. Dudes from other countries don't do this as widely as us (well maybe Chinese is close enough now). It goes so far that our translated EVE clients send translated names of things to chat, so our [Contracts] are [Предложение обмена вещей] and our [Killmail: xxxx] is [Победа: xxx]. Fun fact btw, "победа" is word for winning, so in russian clients killmails always labelled winning no matter if you actually got pounded.

Seems like we going to conquer r/eve too. Вам не страшно, товарищи?

What kind of salvaging do you do?
---
nice
---
Talks like this constantly come up. Poorer countries have a lower price simple as that. If CCP could charge double they would. CCP have to balance keeping the price lower enough that the most players can play and making as much money. If the player base gets to small in a region it will die.

Actually we were planning on living there. We'd been fighting No Visual and had done pretty well before they asked for help.
---
Not sure how to feel about the help part, since on one hand that's basically how sov works but on the other I feel they should have been able to fight us themselves. Plus they have another constellation in the region and are way too small to need two.
---
We ended up pulling back to NPC null as it's generally less filled with existential threats.
---
You'd take away like half of the interceptor's roles by removing nullification.
---
Being nullified allows them to scout efficiently even in space with anchored bubbles. Being nullified allows them to get ahead of enemy gangs and tackle if they try to bubble behind themselves. Being nullified allows them to freely warp around bubbled grids to point targets of interest.
---
If they can't do these things, you might as well not bring interceptors at all. If you take away the nullification a jaguar probably does a better job as a tackle/scout ship.
---
You say that fitting nullification on T3s is okay because it nerfs the combat capabilities. Interceptors don't have combat capabilities in the first place. Maledictions get like 50 dps, worse than T1 frigates.  Most small gang Stiletto pilots don't even fit guns. Ares with railguns literally speed-tanks itself most of the time and doesn't get much better effective DPS than the Malediction. And nobody flies Crows.
---
We're happy in wormhole space and PenIsOut close runner up
---
Don't use frigates.  Yiu don't get a chance to learn.  T1 cruisers are your best bet. Keep them cheap.  You make a mistake you Atleast get to see what happens and why and maybe get the chance to correct it

Had a scouting crow from my corp today, so someone definitely flies them still!

lmao you mist be pretty butt hurt, deleting your comment and replying. AGAIN, 8 hours later lmao 😂 😂 😂

---
&gt; inflation is the biggest problem in eve 
---
And the biggest inflation driver is block sov 0.0 and the boosts it recieved
---
Except that's not what's been done.
---
It's not about the money, it's about the cancer of having to refuel jump gates all around your space because some moron with a jump drive thought it was appropriate to gate his cap through an ansiblex
---
That's really nice. Hopefully they keep going with that concept.
---
Just an FYI, this dude u/deckape is the only one making all these pro-stab removal comments. Most of the other posters want stabs to stay.
---
I quit playing before from boredom to be honest. I was a part of TEST alliance and the massive fights I got to be a part of were annoying at best. Someone screaming targets over comms, group warping us in and out of fights...realized very quickly I prefer not to be apart of a big blob of essentially drones. I ended up carrier krabbing for a bit and then just kind of quit. I would say most fun I had was running DED escalation sites since they allowed me to travel around somewhat and be semi nomadic. I also didn't mind mining at all. 
---
I also really enjoyed small group PvP roaming but I never got experience with it as much as I would have liked due to all the pings for massive fights and a weekly quota of having to join those.
---
I'm really interested in being nomadic miner/ratter or working with a small group of players in either pve or PvP endeavors.
---
Its not so much about dieing as it much as it is using all the LO

The original run of black legion, origin.

No. You need the skill to use T2 ammo but the ROF bonus only applys to the launcher. As that is broken ATM the higer DMG modifier of factionlaunchers is better until the RoF bonus applys to T2 launchers again. Also T2 launchers are only better if you have the specialisation to lvl4 or higher (not entirely sure here it might actually be lvl 5) but T2 launchers are a lot cheaper than the faction ones.
---
We did some really ballsy stuff with Filthy Scum back in the day, game was pretty different back then.
---
Snuff has had a few good moments over the years as well :]
---
Oh man, I love this short.
---
I have had so many experiences like this in Null. It's exhilarating and frightening, simultaneously. +1 poop pants if you're carrying 100mil+ in your hold.
---
Cheers on popping your pucker-hole cherry!
---
OK, thanks for clarification.
---
Yeah, that's the state of sov null sadly, there is lot of claimed systems nobody "needs".
---
they certainly rocketed in price when the release came out, i was lucky enough to buy hundreds of faction torp cruise and ham launchers for next to nothing, sold them all now for way past double what i paid
---
THOSE MOTHE.....ok. I will reserve judgement and give CCP a little time to fix it.  :)
---
The eventual goal is to make enough isk to fund my ships when I will inevitably do something stupid. Maybe even enough to fund my Omega status monthly. I'd like to accomplish that without pouring tons of hours daily and I would like to do it solo or with a small group.
---
r/evejobs
---
hull..penetration 😂
---
Because it's a cheap money grab when it's publicly known CCP has specific financial goals to achieve after being bought out by an extremely notoriously P2W gaming company. 
---
It's the fact that skins this expensive IRL are a large step towards every player's fear that EVE is going to go down that road now.
---
You can tell when someone is trying to probe you down so I think it would be more secure: combat probes on dscan -&gt; warp to safe.
---
Well, “doing something stupid” is pretty broad :p
---
In Factional Warfare you can easily make enough ISK to fund a regular pvp habit, for example. It is a lot of solo and small-gang content, too. 
---
I would strongly recommend against trying to pay for omega with isk, especially in the beginning of your eve career. You’ll most likely burn out over it and not enjoy the game.
---
Making tanks fly an American thing :)
---
I used to play with the RAF but never did much with their army except make fun of them.
---
Anyways here's my plane https://i.imgur.com/cDs54rI.jpg
---
Nah, was flying a T2 armor fit Vedmak with faction disintegrator and T2 ammo.
---
Thanks. I'll check it out :)
---
sure but you think nerv all isk making methods will solve the Problem ?   i dont think so
---
we need ways to get more money out of the game
---
This.  Some of the moon goo rocks produce more standard minerals as a bi product than normal ores do (it's crazy) . Arknor is comparable though. Look them up on the market and Check the refine yields in the info tabs.
---
If you stay ready you don't have to get ready
---
It's stories like these that almost make me want to re-sub. Almost.
---
....go back and read the OP...
---
dscan wouldn't work.
---
how would you see combat probes on dscan when there is no dscan?
---
Lmao

Botting positively effects their income though.
---
Hi, thanks so much for sharing ur fit :D
---
I actually have the exact same fit at as yours, just without t2 rigs. 
---
Just wondering why arent u running heavy drones and mediums? Why is it mainly light drones?
---
Also what ammo to u use? I have republic fleet emp m and the idea was to use those.
---
Also is there particular sites this fit can only do? Which c4 sites is possible? it seems to me that c4s requires something a lot bigger from my experience with c4s so far (in fleets with my corp mates).
---
Just a question about the doc, Im just not too sure how do i know my tank is enough to do the site... Do i just check the individual wave full dps on the  and make sure that it is approximately or smaller than my maximum shield recharge rate on Pyfa (So on paper that should mean i wont die)?
---
And
---
Does it matter about my dps values that i need to clear the sites? or is it just generally the more dps the faster u clear the site, but even if ur dps isnt extrememly high, (Im at about 300dps with all shield relays and 450 with all DDAs)), u may have trouble breaking the tank of the sleepers.
---
Thank you so much sorry for all the questions :D
---
o7
---
Find a group that honors 1v1s. Don't be afraid to ask for them, and advice when you die.
---
I want an EVE RTS like homeworld...
---
I don't want removal. I think a hic bubble script that stopped nullification, maybe very small of like 10km diameter would allow for a better counter.
---
Auch yeah, God bless the freeports.
---
Some of us don't play this game to farm.
---
well, I'll let you know that a VPN won't accomplish it.
---
That's not a puzzle, it's a rather obvious part of the microtransaction economy.
---
&gt; your not paying enough, so stop moaning.
---
Noone is moaning. Keep your calm.
---
&gt; If CCP could charge double they would.
---
The question was what stops me from buying Omega in rubles as it would be cheaper for me. It's their product and they can charge whatever they want, my point is not about that.
---
We are veering way off topic here, but I'll explain my side:
---
Imagine a coffee shop that serves the same coffee to everyone, but different prices based on where you were born. This is basically the same.
---
&gt; Put it in to perspective you pay 2.6 percent of the average wage in bulgaria for your sub.
---
In Bulgaria the majority of people make way less than the average wage you might have seen. 
---
At the same time last year the average wage was more than 10% lower than what it is now and the minimum wage is around 260 Euro with the majority of people making around 400 Euro. We are like the poor kid, that hangs around with the rich kids (UK, Germany, Italy, France, etc.).
---
Yes, it's 2.6% of average wage in Bulgaria, but it's 0.3-0.4% of the average wage in Germany.
---
Coincidentally it's the same percentage (0.4) for USA.
---
Our country's problems are not the topic here, but stating we are not paying enough is incorrect. Actually everyone else is not paying enough.
---
Is anyone profitably inventing and manufacturing small T2 ammo - seems like the invention mats + manufacturing mats cost massively exceeds the sell price? 
---
To be fair my skills are a little bit weak, but do skills make \_that\_ much difference?
---
Any bp / calc tools would be greatly appreciated.
---
Same, lmao
---
Well theres your problem
---
biggest oof.
---
These r the adventures that gt new players hooked. Congrats.
---
If the rumors are true, the channels still work like normal but the clients just don't subscribe to the memberlist. All a botter would have to do in this case is to subscribe manually.
---
Now that I think about it, if they just duplicated wormhole behaviour...
---
have you actually read the url?
---
Hey mate, PM me your character name pls
---
Oof, you good dude? Show me where the mean bee touched your ship.
---
I once typed ‘o7’ into a text message to a manager, and then had to explain what that meant.
---
Bless you child for keeping the tradition alive.
---
only use 280’s for max damage no tracking yea!! +3k speed for that horrible tracking! yea  good idea dude. only ewtards use 280
---
You can do this with warp ctrl space if you are in a cap stable fit
---
Isn't that like, every CCP change ever though?
---
An idiot would be the person thinking that being able to drop multiboxed Rorqs using faction mining drones with the ability to hoover up as much ore as 6 Exhumers a piece with no real threat is balanced. The Risk vs Reward was completely skewed. It has now been adjusted back  to a better place.
---
I have a love/hate relationship with anime. So I'd literallyy fight on both sides.
---
wtf I love Brave now
---
Midnight Sun. My first real wormhole Corp. Grand buncha lads!
---
Honestly, I mostly do it while completely afk (after clearing rats). If you die, you lose a 3 mil venture, who cares? Anom/moon mining you’re risking 7-8 times as much, and with blackout it’s also many times more dangerous because people don’t have to prove you down.
---
Da, space communism at work comrade.
---
Have you ever had the Feeling when you see something you hadnt given much thought, but once seen it feels like youve wanted it all these years?

This just screams EVE dude. I wish I could go back to my beginning days sometimes!

They gotta make money somewhere. I mean, they are a business after all. And it's cosmetics. Do not affect gameplay.

---
Ladies and gentlemen? Who the hell is going to give a toss about two bittervets talking shit on reddit? Jesus, priorities eh? Also, you using words like “retard” and “cocksucker” are insults, not you providing a couple of fights out of hundreds where PL weren’t massively overwhelming the people they were fighting. This is like arguing with a juvenile child. You realise that people can see what has been said prior to this, right? Maybe take a break and get rid of some of the hate welled up inside you? Toxic bitch, it’s gona eat you from the inside, it’s not a good look. You’re still a hypocrite tho.
---
TARGET ACQUIRED
---
Oh wow, I'd actually be up for a repeat of this. Lorewise it could be the result of a coordinated attack from the Trigs and Sleepers on CONCORD's HQ rendering them useless or maybe just alot less effective until further notice.
---
I say this as a carebear too, been playing since 2010 but my most recent return has me venturing into wormholes and living in LS! So maybe I'm now just a half carebear?
---
You guys at the graphics team do an amazing job all round.
---
that's when there is a FC paying system. I most cases nobody know where the money goes (not even the corporation CEO actually)
---
Not this shit again
---
shits funny dude lol
---
can't take a joke
---
Talented devs don't want to live on a barren rock in the middle of nowhere.
---
250€ is around $500 per month (rough estimate).  I make over 4x that in the US and I am considered poor.  The income is higher, yeah but so is the cost of living.  If I was paying all my bills an saving a little bit ( &lt; 5%) I would have NO disposable income to spend on Eve (or anything else someone might spend disposable income on) so I can see why someone would argue for a price difference but still think it's unfair.
---
I'm actually playing EVE Online a spaceship video game again instead of EVE Online spaceship politician simulator, so we might finally see an end to it!
---
I agree it's funny lol. Funny how sad it is
---
what else are they doing all that time? :D
---
Noir. in 2009 was the most fun I've had in the game. I wasn't a great PvPer, but I could follow directions, fit things they wanted, and maintain professionalism.  Taking up protection and interdiction contracts was a lot of fun.
---
Pre-Legacy FEDUP is a close second.
---
You must have popped out in goon space. Goons can't tackle
---
this needs to become a thing
---
I remember running into them a few months ago. Seemed pretty active.
---
So while Goons were krabbing for 2/3 years now what the rest have done ? Oh yeah trash talk them on reddit while pretending MER means nothing
---
Annnd he's hooked. You've just spoiled any long term satisfaction you may have gotten from any other game, and you will be trying to explain your amazing moments in game to people who don't play and absolutely do not get it in the near future. Congratulations!
---
My two cents on this matter: learn to rely on d-scan! As there's no local, you need to keep scanning for enemy players. They will kill you for just being there. Always be prepared to warp away. (I've been on both sides)
---
Op pls no expanded fit a freighter
---
Anime War 2: Electric oWo
---
who would use magstabs if not combat ships ?
---
Fairly sure 95% of CCP dev time these days is programming new ways to skin.  The other 5% is throwing shit at the wall and calling it "Chaos".
---
Now while I agree with the income discrepancy, this is anything but covering anyone. Ukraine median income is just around the same as Russia, yet theyd have to pay 15 Euros for Omega. So it's after all just CCP being lazy/not being interested in making fair prices.
---
Thanks for clarifying what's been done, really helps is understand why blocking ventures isn't as simple as blocking ships fitted with stabs.
---
This is really useful info. Thank you sir o7
---
This would be a terrible idea. The game is struggling for numbers already. If you decide to kill all the new bros and care ear people that live there in hisec essentially turning the game into all pvp free for all even for a short time, people will quit in droves. Look at the black out in null sec as a small example of what forced pvp can do in an area its supposed to happen. They quit and cried in there droves. Imagine what it would do in hisec. 
---
Before you claim eve don't need the carebears it most certainly does. Ccp is a company and profit is all that counts, if numbers go down an continue to go down it will shut down the project eventually.
---
An I love eve so fight does who wanna fight you back.
---
as a 30 day old pilot, i’d love a fair fight, even if its a small seal clubbing for me.
---
That is a terrible argument.  Obviously cosmetics matter, or people wouldn't buy them.  In some games, cosmetics are the ONLY thing that matter, so they important enough to be the center of games.  It is dev time that should be going towards the 904382042803480234 other things that need to be fixed.
---
Caps haven't done that since combat refitting was removed.
---
Oh shit.
---
Decent drop but 40bil really all that much these days. Especially if that wasn't a personal structure.
---
Interesting. But I think back then you also could tank CONCORD, so it actually wasn't that big of a difference
---
:popcorn:
---
They don't think shortterm, that's commendable!
---
Make sure you are not aligned to your destination before you try this.

Me and a mate had a similar experience last night. 
---
He is new to wormholes so I suggested a day trip into WH space for gas. I was scanning he was in a venture on standby. Finally found a gas site that a venture could do and wasn't a particularly lucrative site but thought what the hell?
---
Not more than 20mins into huffing and a sabre shows up. I tell my mate to warp and he's ahead of me and literally warps out just as the warp bubble expands. The sabre gives chase and I warp (cloaky astero) to our exit WH only to find it's gone. I tell my mate he needs to safe and cloak up. He doesn't have a cloak...Nooo. 
---
Was the most intense probing I've ever done. The sabre chased my mate around the system for a good 10mins before finally trapping him! As luck would have it, I find a LS connection a few minutes later.. 
---
What a ride!

---
If a tool is used for mainly a goal, and you make the tool unusable in that goal, then you effectively remove that tool. But you are also dishonest in not admitting it. And you think people are stupid and won't notice it.
---
I think you just did not consider it this way. BTW I don't use stabs because I rather have a good tank to resist SB and a small enough signature to not be tackled in the first place.
---
&gt;But that has the problem of making certain celestial objects unreachable by low-skill pilots.
---
Or anyone warping in a 120AU system (I do it very often). Every datacenter constellation in HS has at least one. When you do a combat site, you end up with 40% cap, and warping back to gate needs like 50% of your cap. I have perfect cap, shield, turret and navigation skills BTW - so it's definitely not an issue of skills.
---
Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pornhub, Reddit, Walking the dog etc.
---
Hot damn, didn't expect to see this. 
---
RIP HAX.
---
You could, in theory, tank them. However people didn't usually do this, and it was always considered sort of "cheating" (tho not an exploit, until later.) The one famous instance of that happening was what triggered CCP to super-charge CONCORD into it's current state.
---
So even back then, not having CONCORD was a big deal.
---
MUCH more important to pick a good, original NAME, since you can’t undo that choice. You don’t want to have to live with “Buttmuncher0101” your whole EvE life...
---
Can confirm, am goon
---
well with the blackout ratting isn't worth the risk considering you need some afk subcap, you make much more in exploration / FW with 1 account  
---
reduce the bounties in all nullsec is dumb, make a overfarmed constelation/region reduce the bounties payout /anom spawn and increase the bounties reward/spawn in less farmed nullsec area, or make nullsec like wormhole high reward but limited to force people to spread  
---
but just "nerf bounties" when you only get 50-60m/h lolz, the problem is the umbrella not the bounties, anom ratting is a shit way of farming if you don't have a carrier/super and an umbrella or 3+ afk subcap (and the local) just look the ADM with the blackout people don't bother to farm because the risk/reward is fucked
---
highsec -&gt; nullsec -&gt; lowsec is the real progression

---
like i have said, i used the thorax for comparison as it is used in the most successful t1 frog fleet to date, Bjornbee's frog fleet which uses prodomanatly thorax's.
---
ALOT of what you say in all your points is clearly you guessing.
---
the fit i posted is 100km easily, with 150km possable with a certain script loaded, infact theyre 80km without anything to boost the range on the caracal (the range bonus helping here, but that is on the only ship you would use for this t1 cruiser style sooo?
---
smallgang? bjorns fleets are often about 40-100 in number, of thoraxs. fight this with an equal number of caracals is not impossable, and in some cases has its benefits, like all things. 
---
like ive stated most of these 100km booshing snipe fits dont move, they boosh, shoot boosh shoot (never warping allowing missiles to continue thier path and not be removed from the attacking ships warpdrive :) )
---
 Damage factor = \[(720/105)\*(121.5/2062)\]0.682

taken from the formula from  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile\_mechanics](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile_mechanics) ?

i used a calculator to work out said formula i found on an old reddit post, courtesy from [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P9haOqnYpsymHGOPWysKbhHWcowzj0nilu7VMHbFxic/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P9haOqnYpsymHGOPWysKbhHWcowzj0nilu7VMHbFxic/edit#gid=0)

---
what i see here, is if your thorax was MWD'ing, with a sig of 720 (which it would have) at a speed of 2045m/s
---
the APPLIED dps is 97% before target painters come into the equation!
---
and the thorax is already is hitting for 86% of the caracals full dps at 100km, before tracking or falloff becomes a thing! xD so.... sorry, you clearly are not researching the true numbers, or the tool i used is goddam useless of course.  the 0.682 number you got is a damage reduction factor(smaller the better) as you will see on eveunis great formula site i linked above.
---
If you can create a perfect clone of yourself, I think you'd be doing bigger and better things than EVE automation.

I think you'd dodge a ban though.

Use torps and a grappler. Frigates go poof. I fly a typhoon fleet set up like that. I can honor duel battleships with ease and frigate gangs get munched on hard.  Cruisers might last 2 volleys sometimes 3 but very rarely will they survive 3.
---
look for eve industry calculator i m on mobile and it works like shit if i try to open the browser. 
---
to answer: you usually earn by going scale, cause the margins, if you get them are very small if you plan to sell in a trade hub. 
---
if you plan to sell outside a trade hub then you may get better returns but you need to do a bit of research into where things you sell will find buyers that dont want to get to a tradehub.

Welcome to EVE - the game you will never really leave

Think I'll make a FW character now - this update finally makes it worth playing!

Not been in wormholes for a while now so no comment on current culture. SSC always took the fight even when outnumbered and either won or went down fighting. Great days
---
i mean, they do have fun, they just want to fight, youd think theyd get good at it
---
at about 160 or so you can get most wh sigs types in one pass on 8 au if you center them right.
---
on the bs you get its current position so you keep scanning and you may end up with the position he lands on, then keep scan up and you will end up right on top of it as it cloaked.

---
Have an upvote. I know its not the players job to police botters, but damn this is awesome when we do something about it.
---
Of course you do. They make it so you don't usually have to actually PVP in a PVP game. 
---
I've always known there are more risk averse carebears in the game than risk taking carebears (I'm more than half a carebear) like me. You want to farm isk in peace and safety. I get that. Highsec is designed around that playstyle (mostly).
---
As for the "most of the other posters" thing, that makes perfect sense. You all feel threatened by this idea of risk so you have to Reee about it.
---
Piwat!
---
Sounds like you might be interested in joining a small gang wormhole group. They're usually very relaxed and focused on going out and having fun instead of forcing you to form for meaningless timers.
---
they cost less in fuel and are less vulnerable because of asset safety

Love it. Well done and good luck to you.

---
Remember to use mechanics to your advantage to split gangs.
---
Crashing gate and using gate aggression is a good tactic almost regardless of ship size.
---
In smaller ships you can try warping at distance to temporarily separate a gang and kill squishy targets.
---
In battleships/battlecruisers, you can go super brawly tank and force them to engage you at close range if you have MJD.
---
I personally think T1 cruisers are good for noobs in lowsec but in null, you don't have any specific strengths to leverage.
---
In larger ships especially, bring drugs.
---
Flying a Stratios around is nice but is kind of expensive to learn in, unless you avoid most fights and just kill things you know you can kill safely.
---
&gt; Well that's just not true at all.
---
It is. Your evasive "pirate actions" argument proves it. You can't even think of a single legitimate argument in favor of them, so you chalk it up to certain pirate actions. LOL.
---
Brigade me all you want. It doesn't change facts on the ground.
---
My Dearest Betty,

Today that war of great import has finally begun, and I know not which way the missile will ring truest. In my younger years, I would have given my all for the sweetest of anime tiddies jiggling around like the waves of some long forgotten ocean, but my temperament has changed. I now craze the musings of memes and dreams. Oh Betty, I cannot tell you when this war will end but I can only say that I miss you clappin back them asscheeks like some dummythicc instathot on my manhood. I can only pray that Bob bless us with isk in this time of need.
---
Yours eternally,

Bots use them as they have base +2 warp str meaning a scram wont work. You need 2 which most pvp fits more so frigs qont have fit. How ever the navy maulus gets a bonus is a 2 str scram becomes a 4 str one so I have one fit just to kill venture bots.
---
With any luck, they lost the manual that tells them how to reverse it.

It's pretty fun and about the only place you'll fins small scale PVP on a somewhat equal footing. Give it a whirl!
---
I would honestly laugh if someone were ignorant enough to say something around the lines of "Eve doesn't need carebears"! lol
---
My anwer would be "Good luck training the skills and learning how to keep the game economy floating and the markets well stocked..."
---
I love NC but damn dude that got me. 😂
---
Diamond in the rough.

Almost 2 decades of codebase.

The chat servers have issues sometimes, so local will drop out or you'll see extra people in local.
---
What's Asset Saftey? Does it apply to refineries? Can you insure refineries?
---
Try GMVA/Moira :)
---
IIRC this was a lore event around the release of Empyrean Age, the expansion that added Faction warfare. 
---
There's a small clip of it happening in the [Empyrean Age trailer[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKdTJjDnYzE#t=58s), as well as the [news report video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCVyU4RbFEg) of the same fleet months earlier.
---
Am I the only person that was happy to see his beloved Phantasm receiving a new and cheap skin? :(
---
I mean, I have not seeing anyone talking about those new skins for the Sansha ship line...
---
Briefly joined them years ago and that was my experience. Good FCs, good organization, but not a culture fit for me at all. Telling everyone they suck, we don't need you, everyone trying to sound macho on comms. I know that's fun for some especially when the group is actually good, but I wasn't feeling it.
---
&gt; rWhile you are at fixing lowsec, it still needs this gate to Stain
---
What will you do if they actually deliver on that one day?
---
Sounds interesting. The only reason they came off as elite to me is the way they recruit and ofc being associated with pl.
---
But what if I told you that you can run them in low or null then?
---
I saw Damaviks, they were checking out an Athanor with a totally inconspicuous red beam.
---
Did you give them a bug report number?
---
You should not be able to get out of a fight that is "not going your way" if you have committed to the fight. At least not by simply having a low slot module equipped. Getting out of a fight before committing if more fair.
---
Maryville.edu
---
I get that add all the time!
---
An isk sink would be somewhere in the game isk is removed. Isk is not created or removed through abyssals, it just moved between players.
---
I will start asking them to delete StainGuy ingame (char) and turn it into NPC orbiting this gate in phantasm.        
---
It will spawn randomly and when killed will have chance to drop "a StainGuy corpse"
---
Oh wow, at what point does one hit ctrl space?
---
9.9b is delve price
---
No. If you are in hostile space you should not be safe. Be alert. Be aligned.
---
I lived in wormhole space for years.  I'm not saying that as a "wormholer, btw" meme, but to show that I know what it's like to live with constant risk.  I chose to live in that super dangerous space because I really enjoyed the playstyle, the constant danger, and the isk rewards. 
---
I also lived in null for a bit, and was in a group that was constantly camped and ultimately evicted.  I loved that too.  We fought back until we couldn't any more, then we moved. 
---
If you're not willing to live in space that is like that, then don't.  Nobody forced you to pick that group or that spot.  Find a better spot, a stronger group, or maybe a different playstyle.  Asking CCP to change the game because you're unhappy with your current situation is selfish and short-sighted.  
---
Just make a change and stop complaining on reddit.
---
&gt;like i have said, i used the thorax for comparison as it is used in the most successful t1 frog fleet to date, Bjornbee's frog fleet which uses prodomanatly thorax's.
---
Don't give a shit tbh
---
If you're going to compare weapon systems, it's disingenuous to use two hulls with different bonuses. The best way to compare the weapons themselves is an unbonused hull.
---
&gt;smallgang? bjorns fleets are often about 40-100 in number, of thoraxs. fight this with an equal number of caracals is not impossable, and in some cases has its benefits, like all things.
---
🤦‍♂️ **You** are the one who brought up HMLs being used in small gang you absolute moron
---
&gt;like ive stated most of these 100km booshing snipe fits dont move, they boosh, shoot boosh shoot (never warping allowing missiles to continue thier path and not be removed from the attacking ships warpdrive :) )
---
Hey look, another disadvantage of missiles! Turret sniper ships can lock and shoot an untackled ship before they can warp off, whereas a bunch of Caracals would need tackle to kill anything, otherwise they'd warp off before the missiles land.
---
&gt;1416 \*\[720/72.5,(720/172.5)\*(199/2045)^(3.2)\] = Damage  
---
&gt; is actually what your calculation should be \^\^\^
---
I don't know what to say to this other than you don't know how to read mathematic notation at all and don't understand what the formula represents.
---
Which doesn't surprise me at all.
---
&gt;what i see here, is if your thorax was MWD'ing, with a sig of 720 (which it would have) at a speed of 2045m/s
---
&gt;the APPLIED dps is 97% before target painters come into the equation! (alpha from missile 1416 before, and 1383 after formula has taken affect)
---
You have fucked up here, somewhere. Considering how you butchered the missile damage formula, I'm not surprised. Even a dual guidance comp Caracal with precision scripts only does ~80% to an MWDing Thorax.
---
&gt;and the thorax is already is hitting for 86% of the caracals full dps at 100km, before tracking or falloff becomes a thing! xD so.... sorry, you clearly are not researching the true numbers, or the tool i used is goddam useless of course.  the 0.682 number you got is a damage reduction factor(smaller the better) as you will see on eveunis great formula site i linked above.
---
Yes, that is the formula I'm using correctly, and you are not.
---
Oh and here's ANOTHER reason missiles (HMLs in particular) are terrible: at range, in most situations, targets are usually trying to run away from you, trying to catch you, or, if they are burning at 90° to you, you are almost always able to match transversal (if you're not terrible). In all of these situations, a turret is far better. Pretty much the only situation I'd rather have HMLs over, say, beams, is if I'm tackled and orbited by something way faster than me (in which case I'm probably fucked anyway.
---
Here's my question to you, and I doubt you'll answer it:
---
If HMLs are so fantastic, why doesn't anyone use them? Why does no one bring HML Cerbs on nano roams? Why is every Orthrus and Caracal fit with RLMLs? Why haven't I seen a Nighthawk in seven years?
---
Get back to me on this.
---
Liquidate everything, donate it to CODE. for proper use during your absence.
---
Except there are people like me who have alts that do carebear shit while my main is out hunting.
---
Lol quit drinking the NC koolaid.. Literally trillions of assets destroyed and many many more sent into asset safety.
---
Just because it wasent on zkill doesn't mean it doesn't exist
---
Sieged dread will pass the 1 au mark without warp within 5 mins
---
What's the going rate for mercs?
---
Drunkendis Order.  Small wormhole group that, in its prime, was killing similar monthly totals as groups MUCH bigger.  Could flash form Enyo fleets of 15-20 people, always threw down in a fight, even against LZHX and HK, and gave no fucks about killboards.
---
This is balance issue ^(due to years of various changes) not a bug.
---
&gt; What guy is on his way to his home and what guy is looking for combat.
---
You're describing combat pilot, not combat ship. and my personal pref is to remove them altogether so hull type wouldn't matter anyway. If they must be kept, I could see two ways of doing it.
---
1. If the ship comes with the word industrial or mining categories (or the T2 equivs), then it's not a combat ship. Yes, they can be LOL fit but they're not combat ships. This would exclude the venture but it has this as a default bonus anyway. It would also exclude the expeditions but they have BLOPS and COV bonuses so they're actually useful in combat.
---
2. In support of the guys who whine that they need to be able to travel fit their ships, the WCS could be changed so that it offlines any mod or drone that can cause an aggression timer, even indirectly. Id prefer these to require station fitting services to change out (perhaps by making them very large when unpackaged) to depots are useless. After all, this is for a travel fit, not so you can fake your way through a hundred gates and start hunting.
---
When will you people learn, to destroy anime you become the very &gt;:3 you seek to eradicate.
---
LOL. That'd actually be pretty cool!
---
Nah, not a good idea I would say change stabs that they stop working when you get the red timer like shoot back scram etc
---
Staying ready is not fun if nobody ever comes. There is no winning move. Both options are crap. That's the problem.
---
It was also done whilst the server was offline for a major update, lasted 24 or 48hrs iirc.  Players didn't get a chance to play without concord.  The nearest was Armageddon day on Sisi where empire was set to null security.
---
I've had slit og fun in E-Uni. Especially their Wormhole-campus. To bad most people think of their hi-sec campus when they hear about E-Uni.
---
Honestly we dont need pure carebears. They have very little impact on the game as it is.
---
I am part of a force recon type sig in Goons and we have several members that have well over 70 acounts. They use them  to not only apply extreme pressure to our targets, but also to control entire markets in high sec aswell. For instance, when GOTG was welping shit tons of eagles, almost all of those were being produced by one of our guys.
---
Carevears that shit in high sec are doing absolutely nothing. If they quite no one will care.
---
Why is my name in game important ?
---
&gt; We use to lure Concord into mission pockets and kill them...
---
Were the drops any good?
---
Tron Online.
---
&gt; The game is struggling for numbers already.
---
It's odd, that the numbers started dropping when CCP started trying to placate the risk and effort averse whiners.
---
I... Need... More... Trigs... Hulls &lt;3
---
sometimes i dream with a Dread Triglavian with a Beam that Ramps and melt stations
---
Wormholers control their holes .. that's entirely different. They can cycle down everything and save up every time a new sig appears. They get notice when something happens and they know that only a limited amount of enemies can come through at any time. And every time they pod someone that guy wont be back in 20 minutes. That's exactly why it doesn't work for 0sec ..  because there is no limit and no early warning and being alert all the time is exhausting. 
---
The change is happening ratting and mining has collapsed.
---
I might have used a wrong word, sorry about that.
---
Quite shitty, tbh.      
---
Killing CONCORD invaders in Stain.
---
this is clearly not getting through with hard factual math, and correct calculations.
---
 
---
*Don't give a shit tbh*
---
to ignore the most successful fleet at what im talking about is dumb, and the hull is used because the hull with the bonus (moa) did not perform as good as the thorax did with the setup shockingly
---
 *''🤦‍♂️* ***You*** *are the one who brought up HMLs being used in small gang you absolute moron ''*
---
please quote me where i state this is in smallgang scenerio. ive looked. couldnt see anywhere i have said that. only said the word smallgan in reply with confusion why your so focused on that. but to be honest, im comparing hull performance to hullperfomance, fleet number should not change anything. the scenerio is 100km sniping, in any number. more the better is actuall works, the performance is the same.
---
 *Yes, that is the formula I'm using correctly, and you are not.* 
---
if you were reading the formula correctly. the numbers youve used are not matching the numbers the caracal fit i gave, so i cannot trust you on that. the only thing you got correct was the signature of the thorax.
---
 *If HMLs are so fantastic, why doesn't anyone use them? Why does no one bring HML Cerbs on nano roams? Why is every Orthrus and Caracal fit with RLMLs? Why haven't I seen a Nighthawk in seven years?* 
---
ive actually already answered this, but ill put a little extra effort in,
---
not only do the majority of people missinterpret actual application of missile on a dedicated application fit. ive already said that the one downfall to missiles is the travel time, which you can reduce to 2-3seconds of travel time over 100km in certain fits and hulls using HM. this is why, the travel time, for a very long time travel time matters, but if an amazing brutix fleet say, is bubbled the caracal fleet i am proposing can fire a few volleys, switch targts, fire a few more an a new target, boosh and the missiles will all still hit as no warp has happened.
---
ive had enough trying to show you the math. your not using pyfa, your using incorrect sigs and explosion radius's and explosion speeds. and your not including tracking issues against an afterburning cruiser, nor the fact falloff in turrets, which may be fixed using the moa, but will reap less paperDPS to work with countering the actual change of hull. i know this as i worked with bjornbee on a few fits of other t1 hulls, and the thorax just simply would not be beat by any other hull without using t2rigs and exploding the cost which for him, was one of the main things to keep costs down for people and skill requirements
---
infact, with booshers now a thing, i think a HM boosh fleet with orthrus mixed with 'in boosh range support' is very much possable to beat fleets of numerous size aside from AF gangs....
---
Two times today. First u Was in a TANK procurer making the 1/5 missions of actual event in a 0.6 atacking an NPC when Trigs come and and my shields go 1/3 in ten seconds aprox. Leave without kill the npc and leaving my drones.
---
Second, in a 0.6 was doing the same with a Svipul T1 weapons in propulsion mode (3000m aprox and afterburner) when the damaviks come and i need sttop the afterburner and run, 5% hull, was near to dead.
---
I totally have no idea why people have something against cartoons for kids.     
---
Like i know that there are many "young" players in EvE, but why growups even care what kind of cartoons kids watch ?
---
I appreciate your incorrect views on how safe wormhole space is.  Just to educate you, my old group routinely rage rolled our static.  We did it with a scout equipped with Virtues, and at least one Sabre sitting on the hole.  Time from the new sig popping to Sabre landing on your ass is less than a minute. You're not pulling your sieged dread or ratting setup out in time to avoid that. 
---
Please address my point though:  Why are you continuing to CHOOSE to live in a space you cannot defend and do not feel safe enough to krab in?
---
until you're in :P
---
this fit come frome a loss, it's just the remaining drones in my drone bay. use a max dps mix : 2H,2M,1L + lots of light for frigate, you will loose some light drones.+5 EC-300 to save your ass  
---
Personaly, I used 4 med+1 gecko but I strongly DONT recommand to do it  
---
For your Dps, in C3 it's just a mater of time. There are some remote repair between sleeper but not every time and it's rather low (~100dps tank maximum). You will not be in trouble about breacking their tank in C3.  
---
For your tank, take care. I'm not sure if you are familiar with passive tanking but it can be tricky. constant refiting is the key.  
---
On pyfa, be sure to have 20-25% more tank (in max tank refit) than the maxium dps in the anomaly.
---
Your maximum tank is when you have 30% shield left. if you go lower (because a heavy alpha for exemple) you will loose all your tanking realy quickly. basiquely, if you drop under 30% shield, you will die in few seconds. start the anom with max tank then refit to increase your dps. try to stay at 50% shield, imo, it's a good compromise between efficiency and safety.   
---
with some experience, you will be able to stay on the edge of your tank for max dps.  
---
theses guns are just here because I don't like empty slot. theire dps is negligeable. I don't remember what kind of amo I used.  
---
in C4, you can do "integreted terminus" it's only 700dps (but with high alpha, take care). honestely, it's not very efficient but it was a personnal chalenge when I began to live in WH. But it's a very long site, and you will stay tacled for a long time. you better clean gas's npc. "Vast" and "bountyfull" are nice : 5-10min 20-25M each.  
---
 back in the day my evening was :  
---
1- probe, find some relic/data, find, bm and triger Vast and boutifull gas site  
---
2- come back in my mighty myrm to clean the site. I knew if it was a safe place or not thanks to my previous probing  
---
3- Do some regular Pve anomalys 
---
4- grab my venture and huff the gas
---
PS: I see some of your corpmates use a passive shield praxis for pve. I never used it but it's the same spirit
---
CODE - Hunting lol
---
played on armageddon day, I had shitty skills and fitted out a scorpion with my buddy in a raven, we went to yulai and promptly got shat on and decided we were probably not gonna have much of a better time than that
---
ccp have also done "everything is seeded and everyone has max sp" events on sisi, last time they did one (2015 I think) I multiboxed 6 revenants and a link levi. undocked in 6-c into 15ish goons in supers camping the undock and proceeded to roast the armor rag sitting with them because pre citadel revs were batshit strong
---
sisi is a silly place sometimes
---
You would think they fitted their ships with faction mods at least, considering the hull cost. Scrubs.
---
Cya in ama/min FW mate. 
---
Check out zkill for update meta fits.    I tyr to use AS cheap fits As possible.    It does not matter if you lose a few.
---
6 exhumers. Lul. Idiots way of saying 2 I guess.
---
And only an idiot would consider balancing in this way to be proper. But hey, u wanna be an idiot, fine by me.
---
Please tell me more about the salt deposits you possess
---
Thanks for the laugh man, it's becoming increasingly clear you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Your defense of HMLs being hypothetical fleets that no one actually uses... it's just pure comedy gold.
---
Also please learn how to use punctuation, reading that was physically painful.
---
Its as dumb as jumping them through JBs
---
This.
---
There’s definitely an element of the recent game changes (2016 onwards) which makes me look back fondly at those times.
---
Why are you screenshotting your previous topic and reposting it?
---
they do suppress the prices on t1 mods and low end minerals, which are moderately good things fighting trit inflation
---
Imagine putting up with getting yelled at over a video game like it's a normal thing to do.
---
You can do that when you have 400 nerds in Gilas waiting to pounce.  Bring back POSes so recruiting has to be more selective; watch MCAV die.
---
2008 was well after concord got buffed. by then they had 2500gj/s neuts and perma jams, although their dps was not amazing there really wasn't a good way to tank them, considering the main thing that happened after the yulai zombies incident was a crimewatch overhaul that gave criminal timers to anyone assisting anyone who already had a criminal timer
---
*Literally in goons*
---
Accuses others of drinking the koolaid
---
Why didn’t Goons advance into Geminate/malpais and kill all of BOT/Horde?
---
Cus they were bleeding at home to DPCI
---
That's the problem these days. People existing on only one or the other side of that fence. PL were the bad guys just as much as Goons ever were. I wish for the day that the stalemate breaks for good but the sad reality is that without one side, the other runs rampant. That goes both ways.
---
I had a blast in Enlightened Academy (sponsored by kick ENL-I) - decent mentors to a bunch of noobs running around doing stupid shit, killing and dying over and over again, generally being a pain in the ass to everyone else.  Battle ventures, trying to gank HS orcas, killing a NS customs office so we could learn about PI.
---
What about not being a baddie and managing your transversal by manual piloting
---
Maybe he meant Raze a village. You know, like burn it to the ground.

i refuse to spend time thinking of typing about this,

my English skills are sub par i will admit i apologize about this.

your going by what you've heard, half the use of a formula, with incorrect numbers, and 'but why dont people do it'

for this reason, your nothing but a guesser.

Saving this to my ever expanding Eve-bookmark list.
---
Meta mostly, high level meta usually but still meta.            
---
Quite probably CONCORD command want to just save ISK, as they know that The Nation have jammers running across the Stain that disables the Jovian subsystems they implemented in those ships.
---
Guess I have to undock my Illegal Thanny and poke the bear.
---
I think it just means there are triglavian recon teams out, not actual recon ships as in a class of ship.
---
Uh why?     
---
Like they already pay for the LO at higher rate than is on the market.
---
&gt;incorrect numbers
---
Try putting your formula into a calculator, see what results you get. Let me know how that goes! Get back to me when you see one of those mythical HML booshing fleets lmao
---
(Hint: you grossly misinterpreted how the missile damage formula works, used the wrong damage reduction factor, used variables in the wrong spots, and placed the exponent on the velocity factor alone, instead of encapsulating both the velocity and radius factors)
---
Conffesor or retribution can solo in wolfR WH. 
---
Gila with rapid light miss or normal light miss can do the job.
---
Bad ass!
---
That is your opinion. Personally I don't see an issue with them. They're a module with a counter and they nerf your own ship most of the time. I can't see any issue with them. If you want to catch a WCS'd ship fit the requisite modules to do so.... or use a HIC. It's not like there aren't already modules in the game that counter them. People regularly use 2 point WCS in WH exploration ships and gas mining ships so I fit a faction scram. Now they get a shock when they try to warp out. Removing a module because a bunch of "elite" pvpers don't want to fit their ships to deal with it is retarded.
---
Initiate warp and hit ctrl+space before reaching 75% of your max speed (before entering warp) then do it again if this didn´t use enough capacitor.
---
Yeah since we aren't even blue to init
---
Kinda like how butt cancer is easy to see with a colonoscopy.

&gt; to Reee about it.
---
I'm pretty sure you're the one reeeing if anyone is here. You don't like them because they mean you have to fit your ship to counter them. Poor you but it's not a good reason for removing them from the game. Learn to counter them and you'll be fine.
---
&gt;So those 27% are mainly coming from WHs? I would say thats a huge problem since WHs dont have half the numbers of NS which means isk/capita pure faucet wise is much higher in WHs than in NS. 
---
Are you suggesting that NS entities don't run WH's ever and they don't have NS entities living in WH space?!?!
---
It turns how some people have the capacity to learn from their mistakes and move forward.
---
Your going to need a vertical monitor to view all those bookmarks soon
---
I'm guessing it was on the butt part of the ship.  Just a guess though. I wasn't there.

Have you ever realized that what you wanted all these years is essentially a Battle Royal game? Fortnite is this way -&gt;

- Running corps in Amamake in 2012-2014. Back when people still bashed massed fleets of T1 BCs/BSs for epic fights.

Remember the days "salty" wasn't used for every disagreement?

Back then it had meaning.

Ventures will no longer be able to capture FW plexes.

That's what has been done.
---
Give em a stront fuel bay. You can set the timer for a specific day, but if you burn all the stront on a 9 day timer it wont be able to RF again. Armor and Hull can be killed in the next timer. If you space it out and have 3 days, 3days or w/e then it only takes the fuel for the time used on the trigger for the RF.
---
It's not safe but its safer than 0sec without local. And no you don't rage roll your static while doing pve at the same time... Pve is happening in dedicated holes. You can defend it a hell of a lot better because you know exactly where the enemy is coming from. There is no way to even scout enemies you don't spy on in 0sec right now. This is a bullet proof glass ceiling on any small group that doesn't have the resources to spy on every neighbor.
---
Wont stop a competent pilot from reacting to yellow boxes :shrug:.  Theres tons of little things you can do to help people survive in &lt;40 man fleet fights where ships are much less likely to get alphaed

this time use  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/2/28/MissileDamageFormula.png](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/2/28/MissileDamageFormula.png)

**Thorax stats** 
---
Sig with MWD on, : 720m **(+20% from target painter half way through its falloff ie: = 864)**
---
Speed with MWD on: 2045

**Missile stats**
---
Damage: 1416

Then see what you get, as alpha damage and give the figure :)

(yes i used the DRF from the calculator posted on reddit a while back that stated HM's drf to be 3.2. my mistake for trusting an online calculator.)

Same here, two damaviks 1 or 2 jumps from nearest perimeter system, checking out a structure.

I'm fairly certain they know how to collect data.

Before ISBoxer and software input broadcasting, there were hardware input repeaters.  Theyre still out there.  You can run multiple boxes with one keyboard/mouse.

Thanks for the daily reminder as to why i left Goons. The elitist douchiness of posts like this remind me daily.

Oh, on a side note. You can check where a wormhole is gonna take you if you check it’s info first. It might save you from a gank or something.

Probing down WH’s uncloaked at n00b speed, though...  :O

Well...   That’s one way to get faster.

Unbelievable that translators are still this bad.

Triglavians are actually descendants of Amarr, they are from the future, where the universe has expanded and now it is all cold empty space, which is the abyssal deadspace.

Good riddance.

Harbengers are a good pick for the C2

Im suggesting not even close to what would create those numbers.
---
No regional pricing in the EU, so they just set it to whatever gets them the most revenue. If you happen to be from a poorer country then the single market thing is bad for you.
---
A couple points:
---
1. You're still not addressing my questions as to why you choose to live where you cannot defend and don't feel safe.  Please do that.
---
2. You're still wrong about wormholes, but I appreciate your continued willingness to speak those untruths to me. Truth: nullsec has static gates.  You can drop an alt on the gate and see who comes into system. Wormholes spawn randomly, and anywhere (within certain AU restrictions).  You can be zipped up tight in your little krab hole and a random connection appears, with a scout and Sabre on the other side.  That's what I was trying to explain to you - my old corp rage rolled looking for ratters.  If we rolled into your krab hole, you were going to die.

Please stop telling me wrong things about wormholes.  I lived in them for years.  I get how they work.  Let's get back to the main point - why are you living in space you cannot defend and do not feel safe in?
---
Beam confessor would be good
---
Now you're using missiles with two precision comps AND a painter?! Hahahaha Jesus Christ dude. Really objective comparison there.
---
You're not even TRYING to make this reasonable. Then again, you are an idiot.
---
How about this, try your fit (that uses all its mids just to do as much damage as rails) and try to hit an MWDing Zealot.
---
Ya know, just to make things fair.
---
Maybe one day you'll understand why you're the only person in this game who thinks HMLs are good. Maybe.
---
Still waiting to see those HML fleet comps you keep telling me about.
---
" It's common knowledge that if airplanes are left unused they will deteriorate quicker than if they are used. I think the same concept should apply to Eve."
---
Why should the same concept be applied to eve? It's not real life, it's a game so why are we trying to make it so realistic? 
---
Also, why on earth would you want to go after ships which generates the content in this game? I'm happy people hoard ships in stations as it means they have a good amount of content to undock and fight in. Why would you want to take that away from the game? Anyhow, hoarding ships is not an issue, never undocking in them is...that's what you should focus on...giving a reason for pilots to use those ships.
---
I think it can be linked to  [this](

---
Nation is putting heavy pressure on the collective, we know that Trigs are trying to find some safe space.        
---
Nation even reduced the liberation forces that was making incursions to various places in New Eden, just to devote more forces to this operation.
---
Thank you very much, that is far more effective than carrying around cap drain items to refit with
---
I am in goons aswell man. Care bears that sit in high sec serve a serious purpose. You may not realise it but ever single goon came from high sec at one point.
---
If they all quit the game would be dead over night. Like it or not they are part of the ecosystem. They may do nothing for your game play delve is self-sufficient. But they play a vital role in its balance and especially its economy. They make up a large player base like there style or not.
---
Example when you start the game unless you know someone in a nul block or have played before. Your first Corp is always a hisec indy/pve Corp all care bears. Your first steps in any mmo are pve. All players have to learn and grow that's what high sec is an it to needs veteran care bears to teach the new ones. Who may someday learn to fly with you one day..
---
Their ISK originates of the same faucets. Even if they got their hands on it via trading or undustry.
---
The increasing speed ISK entered the game with over the years sped up the money making process for everyone.
---
nono, im using the fits i posted earlier, (i changed the prop on the thorax to an MWD (its over on cpu and powergrid but thats you issue xD)

---
yes, this is pretty much the fit used on the vry successful frogfleet that has destroyed munins, feroxs, jackdaws, pretty much everything its come into contact with aside from bomb runs larger than its MJD dessie anti bomb launcher count, or smartbomb T3C's.
---
The mistake is his Alliance Ticker:(
---
No. But people having steady jobs and families is not an excuse to dumb the whole game down, crash its economy and kill 90% of content. You know, we had working players with families back in 2004 as well and they did just fine without having to abandon their RL in order to play the game.
---
They just weren't spoon-fed or expecting to be able to do everything with minimal effort, like a lot of players are today.
---
In war time ratting slows down hard. But wars end and by then we still need smaller faucets.
---
Uhm.... Tencent != Netease
---
Man, you should probably apply at CCP right now! They surely haven't thought of any metrics to show them anything like this!
---
So it is basically anti - higsec - bot NPC.       
---
Nice
---
I think this is the right answer. Word choice leaves it open for misunderstandings.
---
A better corp, if they can't go you fit things up

MOROS (Cynosural Field Theory). Was only with them for a few months but that was the dream. Sexiest Vindicator fleets I’ve ever seen. Hope to see them back one day, haunting every corner of Placid.
---
So players will react, and higsec bots will die.      
---
Good!
---
Yet they argue that no asset safety would be a conflict driver when no one is in a rush to kill structures that drop loot atm.
---
wat
---
Maybe decrease the numbers of BS in sites. Make supers less attractive that way.     
---
Also remove single spawn points. Boson titans are just as bad, if not worse, than super ratting.
---
O
---
Yep.
---
The 'equal' footing being 'forced' by gated sites with ship class restrictions. :)
---
and people needing to slowboat a short distance to get to the gate to get in. Allowing dscan to get them
---
I'm interested in knowing if someone has tried to hunt this recon groups yet... I imagine it will be much easier than fighting them inside occupied systems, since you won't have to deal with those massive debuffs!
---
I wonder if a normal cruiser actually has a chance of taking part on the hunt now...
---
you’re absolutely right, the bug alliances and corporations that use the 250mm wolf and are top of killboarda with said wolvea are baddies . yup
---
| Cheers on popping your pucker-hole cherry!

A disgusting but remarkably fitting description.

Our experiment was more successful

Does this work if you want to copy the window locations of the main account which runs on a 2560x1440 resolution to your alts which are running on monitors with a 1920x1200 resolution?
---
It's Seudo English
---
Imagine being this blown out about not being able to rat in 100% safety.
---
You realize that exploration goods go down if more people farm them, right?    
---
Same goes for LP.
---
In the end you can't simply exchange one activity for another and expect the market not to change woth it.      
---
We need the diversity.
---
CCP would have to find him first, which could be hard considering he is in RAZOR
---
I Imagine he wants those tokens be selled by NPCs.  That could in theory be another ISK sink.
---
I'm impressed you guys still remain independent even with so much attention directed towards you. The life of freedom is hard so expect stuff like this from time to time. Value your independence!
---
People like him are why PvEers are hated so much.

Delete this
---
Literally your attitude is the reason newbros don't want to stay and why CCP has trouble getting new players to play and stay. There's way too many elitist idiots in this game that actively try to make the environment worse for new players, not realizing it's exactly what will bring an end to the game, eventually.
---
It's like old men that run car shows making people with anything less than $50k cars feel bad about trying to be there with them. Those people just want to get into the group and would eventually be productive, but instead they get pushed away to other things because of arrogance. It's literally what kills those car shows.
---
Like I said elsewhere, if they cost half as much as a faction point, it'd be a fair trade. If the mods needed to catch them cost as much as two of them, it'd be a fair trade. That's not the case. You have to spend ~80 mil to beat a pair of mods each costing &lt;1mil isk.
---
Actually, I have another idea now. Give T2 scrams three points. That should satisfy you, right?
---
I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids, if you don't want to spill your coffee then you shouldn't be driving with it.

found the hull pen alt in test

No, unless you are in Russia or China.                   
---
Have you heard about freedom of speech ?         
---
He is dumb and offensive but this is just some dumb words and no actions.
---
I think I've figured out what the problem is.
---
You're comparing HMLs to a gimmick tankless rail fit, in the only situation in which HMLs compare even remotely favourably.
---
The whole problem (and my entire point) is that **three fucking midslots** are *required* just to do full damage to another cruiser hull, and forget about frigates or HACs.
---
That is the issue. That's why no one uses HMLs. With beams, yeah you can fill your mids with TCs and painters to hit as reliably as possible, but it's not mandatory. With good piloting or tackle, a beam zealot with just heat sinks can apply full damage pretty reliably. HMLs? Doesn't matter if you're shooting an AFK frig. Doesn't matter if that ramjag is burning straight at you at zero transversal. You need a rack full of bullshit in your mids just to see full damage.
---
That's why HMLs are garbage. They need support from MGCs and painters and webs just to do what turrets can do with nothing but good piloting. I made this point in my first reply to you and you completely ignored it.
---
No it isnt.  
---
&gt; Your evasive "pirate actions" argument proves it. You can't even think of a single legitimate argument in favor of them, so you chalk it up to certain pirate actions. LOL. 
---
You mean a logical argument that's correct? Sorry but your discounting it doesnt make it illegitimate.
---
&gt; Brigade me all you want. It doesn't change facts on the ground. 
---
You have no facts.
---
Depends on your country. Threats are not protected by the first amendment in the US.
---
&gt; Removing a module because a bunch of "elite" pvpers don't want to fit their ships to deal with it is retarded.
---
LOL. I'm the farthest thing from elite and only about half a PVPer. I'm more than half a carebear but I'm perfectly willing to take a risk when I undock. You, OTOH call yourself a PVPer but you accept no risk.
---
That's why you need to 7o them now, just to confuse them!
---
You dont understand freedom of speech.  Just a heads up.
---
Oh it very much is a reason. I hear tons of stuff about 16 years ago, I very much doubt you had a higher playerbase than around 20 ish years old back then. And to even suggest that 36 year olds do the same as 20 year olds is a joke. 
---
I get the entire narrative aspect but Im willing to bet anything that if the game would return to its previous state it would die pretty much instantly. People are always nostalgic, always. But they forget that shit changed for a reason.
---
And kill 90% of the content, like where are you getting that number from? Crash its economy? What? Do you even know what that phrase means?
---
Hi fellas, Brazilian player here o/
---
I've been wondering the same thing, the price of 1 month of game time here is quite high... This was not the case a few years ago :(
---
The worst part is that we don't have an option to buy subscription here using national currency outside steam, good luck using steam if your account was not made using it... --"
---
My most memorable eve adventure was getting lost in a wormhole (noob me forgot to bookmark the exit), and running from someone trying to scan me down while also trying to scan down an exit. I made it somehow, and learned a valuable lesson to boot.
---
Nice work guys! Bots are having a real rough time these days and I love it.
---
I tried 5 times and now feel a headache coming in
---
Can't tell if serious. People don't care what kids watch, they're rebelling against adults watching anime, as a subculture.
---
I mean I don't care about it...I never really watched anime, but I don't dislike it. Horde has a similar general rule against anime, though.
---
I lost a bunch of mining drones to them 11 jumps from the closest invasion system.
---
Once more so all the people in the room hear it : freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences.
---
True, but i see some angry kid and not potential threat.       
---
We lack context ... and way to many things to consider this a threat.          
---
Like have you read some of doomchinchilla tweets .... like this is nothing compared to what this guy can tweet.
---
Feel free to donate your spare 40 bil to me any time.
---
Im very much with you. Removing asset safety is one of the absolutely dumbest ideas I have heard.
---
&gt;him saying he used something doesn’t immediately mean he did it lol.
---
Again, context. It *could* have been some weird server side thing, except he then admitted it was not.
---
But if they couldn't act as such a goddamned isk printer, dropping them would mean more because they might not be so cheap that anyone with four brain cells to rub together could buy one
---
I remember tht gigxsaid something same (not to ccp, but same destructive) and got banned less than a week, so why not?
---
If you have a carrier, flying with a probing alt with a cyno in cargo could be fun. Once you find a ded you d like to run, you could jump yourself to it with a machariel in you sma. It s only a random suggestion, best approach is explore the game and meet friends you want to plsy with, eventually you will find the way.
---
if you can't manual pilot then yes you are a baddie. That's what I said
---
I mean they could scale back the rate until charges do the same as now without.
---
But that makes the whole process a bit of obsolete... Seems the idea doesn't hold much merit.
---
And a million others from the status quo.
---
whew lads, somebody said something mean on the Internet
---
Yeah, that's not exactly free speech. Those are terroristic threat.
---
&gt; I reserve the right to disengage if the fight isn't going my way
---
You're right, that's not arena PVP. What you describe is akin to  PVE but against players. Little actual risk but you get a kill mark on your ship once in a while and brag to your friends about the green killboard.
---
You are over interpreting stuff in this screen shoot.
---
you static does not have a fixed type.   
---
you home hole may have a fixed type (which would be wr) but you don't rat in your home hole you rat in the static.   
---
For c3 ratting get a cheap bs like a dominix. Gilas work too but are kinda slow on their own.
---
the thing is, that no tank sniper thorax fleet works lol. it destroys fleets larger in size hull or tier.
---
and sorry i didnt realise we also see MWD zealot snipe fits all the time? :D
---
and yes, from the VERY FUCKING START i have said you misunderstand the HM's role. it is for long range sniping, like artillery, in which if you out maneuver, and outrange your opponent you will prevail.
---
for instance an artillery tornado has all mids used for tracking and no tank....
---
and the thorax its fighting in the one given scenerio of a hull proven on the battlefield uses 2 mids for tracking computers and 2 lowslots also to get the snipe range it needs, remove these and the rail range without buffs from modules is longer than the railgun range is. ??
---
if your hitting your enemy outside of thier attack range, or effective range you do not need tank. no what im saying doesnt make HAC fleets, or nightmare fleets completly useless, im saying it has its role. and has its pros over turrets in places.
---
ive always said the missile travel time is the one and only shit part of missiles. which with booshers can actually be worked with, and HM cerbs were used for some time slightly before ADC change came in.
---
you sound like you think a brick tanked rail ferox fleet would shred the shit thoraxs ive posted, the FACT is they dont, the ferox's melt, as do thier basilisks, like fish in a barrel.
---
1. trying to make this personal wont make anything i say more or less true .. nice try though 
---
2. static gates are the entry to your space for random strangers. danger in 0sec doesn't come from random strangers but camping neighbors. so you are scared of a hole opening and a sabre warping to you .. and in 0sec that sabre could be cloaked on your annom/moon before you even get home from work. do you see how that's different? 
---
nobody ever said you have to be safe at all times .. wormholes happen to 0sec as well and have been fine for the most part. because you SEE THEM COMING and can PREPARE accordingly .. see that's the difference you don't seem to get. any head start of people being alert and pvp chars logging in makes a huge difference. being alert all the time for things that might never happen is what is exhausting and unfun.
---
The conversion of euros to dollars is 1:2, no?
---
Subculture ?       
---
Like Peppa the Pig or SpongeBob subculture?
---
I honestly dont give a single shit what new players do. I dont go to high sec so it just does not matter to me. All I do is keep my main deployed at all time harassing what ever is our main hostile entity at the time. 
---
But if new players cant adapt then they will not survive in EVE anyways this isn't wow. 
---
CCP has been doing a good job at killing off their longer terms players. It is a weird idea but maybe they should actually focus on the player base that has kept them going since the game has been created.
---
Why beg for it, just spend a month in Delve not being lazy and you'll have twice that, if not more.
---
Unironically and unequivocally, Goonswarm. They’ve provided opportunity that nobody else could. Say what you want about our ability to min-max, but being a Goon is fun and I’m grateful to be a part of the Swarm.
---
No he directed this to specific player.
---
Ok yeah that's pretty funny.
---
&gt;They have very little impact on the game as it is.
---
&gt;we have several members that have well over 70 acounts. They use them to not only apply extreme pressure to our targets, but also to control entire markets in high sec aswell.
---
You just highlighted the exact reason the game does need "pure carebears", people who are completely unaffiliated with the big blue blocs and are happy to do their own thing in the sandbox.
---
The UK is in the EU, still. Why can't we purchase the gametime/plex for UK prices? They are in the single market and as long as they are everything offered there has to be available for everyone in the entire single market.
---
It is the same issue steam had when they tried to region lock certain Eastern European countries to offer cheaper prices there. Some competition commissioners forced them to stop that, because it violates the rules.
---
&gt; I am part of a force recon type sig in Goons and we have several members that have well over 70 acounts.
---
You sound like the marine copypasta guy.
---
Part of the entire reason why POSs are being removed is because of POS code.
---
CCP has no clue how it works, the moment they try to modify something it breaks everything.
---
Hell, they have modified completely unrelated things and it has somehow broke the POS code.
---
Best possible response, hands down. Upvoted.
---
yea I kinda got that, but I can still dream :)
---
true
---
One of the best times I had was when a friend and I were doing some sleeper sites in stratios’.  It got late and we decided to head home.  After doing a ton of scanning the best exit we could find was still 50+ jumps from home.  
---
We made it about halfway before getting chased by a rather largish and angry mob.  He ended sacrificing himself on a gate so I could make it home.   Was hella fun.
---
Oh, but huge empires are bad and need to be broken apart by changes to game mechanics...

&gt; Russia or China

lol or most of Europe, Great Britain...even the US for the most part...

---
of course but what the point telling me this ? i don't encourage people to do that i just said anom ratting don't worth anything right now, and i hope CCP do something for that because i love the blackout i think it's a good idea and making NS more dangerous is always a good idea  
---
BUT if they keep the blackout or even remove asset safety and anything else they need to increase the reward aswell, the more dangerous the space is the more rewarding it should be and NS (without an umbrella) is too much dangerous for the small reward it offer
---
Sorry to break it to you. But the whole point of this game is for players to impact other players. Without this there is no reason to play.
---
Right now my business looks like this;
---
1. Buy with market alt in highsec.
---
2. Contract to my nullsec trading alt.
---
3. Put up a contract to ally freight.
---
4. ???
---
5. Profit.
---
At least two of the steps could be cut out if my market alt was able to say "courier to character x in location y".
---
&gt; You have no facts.
---
I know you don't like to risk your ship at all. It's easy to work backwards from there. 
---
I mean I can't blame you for advocating in favor of WCS mods. You need them because they help you to feel like you actually accomplished something amazing by getting away. It's a prosthetic that makes you feel like a better pilot. Without it, you'd have to accept being shit like the rest of us.
---
Is there a story behind this all ?

Begin...

why  ....

reason..

I think that's account sharing.
---
I sometimes say to my dog : i will pull skin of you if you do it again.

Mostly because i am angry, honestly i will never do it, also he don't understand what i am saying ^(but he get that he done something wrong from the tone of my voice)

Don't mix angry 13yo post with terrorist threads pls.

Lol look at all the SJWs go.

I have to say, the same people who constanstly tell others to man the fk up are the biggest bitches around, constantly employing SJW tactics to get people to shut up when faced with anything that might ruin their circlejerk narrative.
---
What? Bots don't use near2... Why would they have a software process information for them that they could process themselves?
---
It's about time someone said this publicly! Very brave, very cool.
---
Obviously you're an idiot if you can't do the math. 
---
Full V Hulk T2 Strip Miner w/Mining Crystals + Full Rack of T2 Mining Upgrade- 30.9 m3/s 
---
Full V Rorq w/Augemtnor Rigs + Excavators- 180 m3/s (This is AFTER several nerfs as well)
---
180/30.9 = 5.82    so yeah, almost 6 full excavators. You want to add mining drones in to the exhumers and it still is as much as 5 exhumers. Where you came up with 2 I have no idea. 
---
There, I've proven you're a fucking idiot. All you have is your conjecture, which coming from an idiot, doesn't mean shit.

Друг Българин играе Eve!

I pay pay in £ because I live in the uk, but I get your pain. It's obviously even worse because 30 lev is a lot more to an average Bulgarian than a tenner to an Englishman
---
Just got attacked by these. Managed to get most of the fleet out, but one retriever got stuck on a rock and melted. They do far too much DPS imo; if you don't react immediately, you're finished.
---
I also don't see how this in any way counters bots, seeing as they don't warp scramble and bots can easily be coded to just warp off when they appear.
---
ANIME IS NOT A CARTOON, REEEEEEE
---
So the way scanning works is that it takes the location they were at when you hit scan, and reports that when the scan is complete.
---
For the purposes of catching a battleship that you think is going to cloak, your best bet is to repeatedly scan them with combat probes, and every time you scan, you should be book marking their location. If you repeatedly do that, you'll get basically a history of their movement, which you can continuously do until they cloak. And vanish from the probe window. Then, you warp to the most recent one, look at the bookmarks around you to see if there's any indication as to which direction they went, and try to get a decloak and tackle.
---
10 Jintaan corpses!
---
Alright makes sense from a code standpoint - but then why not recreate the feature - was it that oppressive gameplay-wise? At least the way I see it now, it could've been very nicely expanded (given the code was rewritten ofc)
---
It should be bannable to post stupid screen caps of some raging nerd in a discord channel in an attempt to get them banned. Fuck off
---
Sorry to ruin your perfect intel where you could watch Netflix and get pinged when a threat was 15 jumps out.
---
All ships can be combat or non-combat at any given time. I think of the converter that had warp core stabilizers and was used to pin down a ship but moon walk away when in trouble.  Also, all pilots can be combat and non-combat the same time. The difference depends on the use at the time you're speaking of.  
---
The last part of what you said makes sense.  How about a new mechanic where warp core stabilizers and combat/agression timers are mutually exclusive, ie one negates the other or,  more simply, WCS only work if you have no agression timer and go offline if you get an agression timer.  That way any aggression disables point and or scram immunity.  They then can only be re-onlined the normal way as any other ship equipment (cap at 95%, not in warp, not cloaked, not invulnerable, etc).
---
What do you think?
---
This is just a little part of a bigger plan  
---
we started with filaments then invasions and then recon scouts outside of invasions..  
---
the current bet is they will be going for null sec and start to claim sov at some point along the line and the current guess is that they will go for drone regions first
---
&gt; It was the point of the ship when we still knew they were there and could plan accordingly. Now planing is a waste of time so no counter can be prepared f
---
I would make one change to covert ships. Once they get an aggression timer or go through a cyno, they should have a five minute timer on recloaking. Aside from the uncatchability they have after engaging, I think they're well balanced.
---
I also have a limited (by law) freedom in dealing out consequences.
---
Haha I have no salt against CODE, literally never been ganked by them nor do I mine. I just find their verbiage of hunting funny.
---
Explain that to the authorities when they show up at your house for posting threats on the internet. I don't think they'll be as amiable.

I think he means his C2 is wr
---
&gt; I know you don't like to risk your ship at all. It's easy to work backwards from there. 
---
lol well that's not true at all.

It's a prosthetic that makes you feel like a better pilot. Without it, you'd have to accept being shit like the rest of us. 
---
How dare people plan ahead intelligently?
---
You clearly have no idea about me :P .
---
So you are pulling math here? Theoretical numbers? And you somehow think you are clever?
---
Hulks pull in about 40m/h, Rorqs about 80m/h. If you stop being a pyfa cunt warrior and actually come down to earth.. You know.
---
Since when low sec means is place to take things slowly? On the contrary, it's one of the hardest places to start on.
---
is there any chance i could see a picture of what this looks like? even if its just cell pic. I'd love to get hardware ui dedicated for eve
---
You gotta choose a narrative... 40b not a lot.. or 30 days of pve, which one?
---
Wormholers are constantly alert.  Every day is a new universe.  That doesn't stop them.
---
And I'm not "making this personal."  I sincerely don't understand why you want to live in a place that makes the game unfun for you.  That's what I'm getting at.  Why do you continue to live somewhere that makes this "exhausting and unfun?"  Why not move, or join a group more able to defend itself?
---
yea? who cares. i quit this game, have fun.
---
I saw a canister you guys left, it was my only company while I was Harvesting! But I didn't mess with it in case it was a trap.
---
Or rorquals.. because combat freighter rorqual conversions are real.
---
30 days of PVE is not a lot. Also, it's more like 2 weeks of PVE, 30 days will get you a lot more than 40b.
---
Yaaah let's cheer over something that doesn't affect 90% of the playerbase. yaaaay. Now can you fix sov, capital proliferation, stagnation, Rorq blobs and other assorted asshattery?

You win August 14, 2019.

yea, I told him as much - so he actually wants some ideas for C3 ratting I guess, since the home hole will just get depleted? Or would he want a c2 wr fit to use? Who knows?
---
Ever interrupted your boss talking to someone else with "check check"? i did.  
---
The confused look was great :D
---
I miss Scourge. :(
---
[like this?](http://i.imgur.com/X7mDp.jpg) (not my pic btw) Some monitor stands allow you to do this. I know my asus monitor allows me to rotate it vertically, then it's just a simple windows setting change.
---
He may very well understand you!
---
Fun facts I remember reading a while back: The average dog has the same IQ as the average 5 year old human, understands up to 250 words of the local language, and is capable of manipulation and deceit.
---
They like to pretend they are dumb goofs so they can get away with stuff. You should have seen some of the looks I've gotten from dogs when I was telling their owners this!
---
"Shut up, bro! You're blowing my cover!"
---
It would work better if you found a darker background to take pictures of a dark ship against
---
&gt; What do you think?
---
I think that aggression and WCS *at a minimum* should be mutually exclusive. I'd go the route of one offlining the other, not be part of an automatic mechanic.
---
I know about the covetor trap but the truth is if help is more than a few seconds away, the covetor will only pin down someone who made a mistake. It doesn't have the speed to keep anything long pointed and getting within web/scram range of one is the fault of the attacking pilot (I lost a bomber this way recently and it was totally my own fault).
---
which is completely stupid from a consistency perspective
---
Yes, math, I know. It must be a foreign concept to actually present evidence to prove statements. It must be much easier to just talk out of your ass.
---
As someone that lived in WH space for most of my Eve career, I really enjoy reading your story. Good to see that newbro's jump in WH's and do their stuff.
---
You will be facing some kills in the future, people will be watching/hunting for you and you won't know untill that Sabre pops-up next to you. To support you keep on doing this, feel free to send me your first Venture Zkill loss and I'm happy to donate a new ship to you!
---
See you around :)
---
OK, mate. You convinced me. You're possessed of a very high quality intellect and you are the consumate pilot. 
---
It's just a coincidence that you need WCS to survive.
---
Who gives a fuck
---
You recently had to have your car repaired IRL.  
---
Was it fun? No?  
---
That's why. It wouldn't increase the game fun factor at all, but the opposite. Enjoy logging in and wanting to go pvp and random ship just broke and needs 100m repairs. ENJOY!
---
Good for you - it's nice to see a small group just fight and see what happens instead of cry on reddit about cloaky camping/the blackout/whatever flavor of the month is hurting safe crabbing. Keep it up - we need more of you.
---
they should have named it Tron Legacy skins
---
What goes around comes around, GOD BLESS AND YEET TAKE THAT GARLIC BOI
---
No trap, just spare supplies

Running the highest end Abyssal sites in high-sec should *absolutely* flag you as a suspect, especially since lame ass cheese fits have come out eliminated the need for blingy Gilas. The ISK per hour is good enough to group it with other PVE activities that force you to incur risk. Why should I risk my nice sub-cap in nullsec when I can make an average ISK/hour that essentially equates to the same reward as running T4 and T5 filaments in Jita. 
---
It’s so dumb.
---
To be fair.. you actually stated why they would be able to do it. Given enough passage of time, a nanite matrix will be able to build anything you program. So, in 10,000AD I imagine everything built would be from a puddle of nanite goo.
---
Best Alliance was Frege back in the drone lands days... my fondest memories of EVE was during that time.
---
Because nobody runs ded sites.
---
I think there needs to be a quicker process for absolutely common sense things like this. Especially because changes like this inccur next to no risk.
---
If it turns out banning ventures is some terrible thing you could always un ban them. If it turned out ceptors using entosis was somehow a good idea you would always revert it. These kinds of changes that require next to no dev time and are generally universally agreed by the community should be implemented quicker.
---
Thanks for understanding.  Welcome to my cult, stay away from the punch though...
---
I mean, if you don't place a high value on your time- sure. Two weeks or 20-30 hours is worth a whole lot more than 40b to me.
---
I could have sworn back in the 06 one everyone had max SP as well cus I remember having the 2 gun 1 middle nag back then. But I might be wrong
---
I might have mixed up your response with someone else's...
---
But I don't think NS needs better rewards across the board. The reward has to be distributed more evenly somehow, so that people don't feel like they have to be in one of the 3 big umbrellas but can make their own luck somewhere.
---
That could actually be pretty cool.
---
My current corp, Filthy Peasants, is the best I've been in. Its the second time I've lived long term in lowsec and it's been the most fun I've had in EVE this decade. The casual playstyle with a relaxed friendly atmosphere fits very well with the standard adult work life. We've also attracted a good mix of veterans and new players that love the independent lifestyle even though its challenging to find regular content.
---
This is EVE
---
Hey thanks man! I'm definitely new but people like you are making the game fun. My Corp is small and it was a good combo of "hope you make it out of there bro" and "hope you get podded lmao" 
---
The community is great here.
---
Not long term.
---
 It decreases the incentive to buy plex from ccp as the botting isk is signifigantly cheaper. It increases the costs of plex for average players leading to less real people playing the game. The less real people that play the game the less stable the game becomes long term as fewer players means less content for those remaining and less incentive to stay.
---
These are the stories that make me want to play again. Sounds like it was fun!
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2112835615/
---
Find a single fit of mine anywhere that uses WCS. You have no idea what you're talking about. Just because I don't want them to be removed from the game doesn't mean I use them. Unlike you I'm thinking in terms of what I think is best for the game rather than what's best for me.
---
Future corps for the gameplay. Smaller w space corps for the friends.
---
Must have high ADMs in that hole
---
As far as I understand it, other parts if the game depend on the POS code. Cant remove or modify it. So making a new POS code isnt possible as the old will probably need to be disabled. 
---
A couple years ago they broke a major part of the game, trying to mess with that code. Anyone care to remind me what it was?
---
Dude, the more I hear you talk the more convinced I become that you are totally clueless. You are sitting in your basement getting mad over pretend. If you ever used these ships you would fking know what the difference actually is.
---
Dont believe me? Try it yourself.
---
We'd taken the ihub from No Visual and anchored our own Astra which is when they called in help. After that it was kind of a done deal, sadly. We held sov for nearly two months in Tribute and held off a lot of attackers despite our size. Was something to be proud of.
---
You've now trained Office Attire V! Your deliveries will be significantly more impressive to customers!
---
Ahhhh..... you're space poor. Sorry, didn't realise you were a hobo. Stop whining and go buy a damned faction mod or fit a scram and a point. I have no problem with WCS price being raised but within reason. Tech 1 \~2mill each and Tech 2 \~5mill each should suffice to make them a real choice on frigates and give the attacker some loot to sell after the kill. After all, the WCS willl be lost to anyone with a faction scram but the person with the faction scram can keep using it to farm stabbed ships.
---
atleast most of the garbage dropped
---
Please don't encourage CCP to keep doing things like this. :p Anyone wonders why the game hemorrhages new players when there's obscure* mechanics around every corner waiting to fuck you over. There comes a point where the game is no longer hostile in a fun and challenging way and is instead just actively punishing you for playing the game.
---
* From the perspective of a new player who doesn't know the game and doesn't religiously study patch notes - or perhaps a returning player who hasn't read back through x+ years of patch notes to see what fresh bullshit CCP has added since they left. etc.
---
yikes
---
I miss Blue Ice!!!
---
2 bombs weren't enough
---
It's Rorq mining, not exactly an attention strict activity. I'll do it when I'm working from home, playing Civilization, or catching up on Netflix. 
---
I'll even have at least 1 or 2 running on another monitor when I'm on fleets. 
---
That's the reason Rorqs are just awful for the game. It's not like other forms of income that require strict attention. Rorqs are cheap as hell to replace compared to the amount of isk they make. 
---
Combine that with some production skills on those same characters and you can throw some expensive BPOs into the research cooker for a bit more gain per character slot with little extra effort. 
---
But besides all that, y'all seem to have missed an important part of my original comment. If this was a group structure, that is a small af investment for the structure itself and all the stuff that dropped may not have been all a single player's equipment.
---
Yes, and if big entities create a stalemate for their own benefit (in ISK) all impacts other players can have on one another goes out the window and the game dies.
---
IM thinking just making it a dread/carrier type of thing. So no supers/titan/logis/jf
---
40 fucking billion? Holy shit.
---
I didn't write my comments about you.  I wrote about the wide assortment of ideas and comments I get from various players, often in conflict with each other. 
---
I stand by what I wrote.  It works for me.
---
You can advocate on behalf of whatever you feel is most important.  I'm not telling anyone else how to act.
---
\*sniff sniff\* 
---
Smells of tears and backpedaling. "butbutbut isk efficiency1!!1!!!one"
---
Nawww.. blops only! 15 LY range. Mmhmm
---
I did not know this.  Thank you.
---
Poooooi!
---
There are a few, but they removed those billboards by the gate and it broke undocking.
---
I'm not suggesting I'm for or against any of it, I'm just saying there's a large group of people that are very-much for Anime (as a culture) and there's a large group that's very-much against it.
---
My corp lived out of one in 2008, citadels in jspace make me feel spoiled.
---
There was a cool post the other day about someone’s idea of a deployable structure that was like a mobile depot with short range limited teather and refitting for corp/alliance.
---
I really don’t know the strategic point to them now a days, when we had a eviction threat we put one up with as many weapons and ECM as possible as a last resort, I don’t know the point of having a POS against someone that just took down two fully fitted Astrahus.
---
It's good to see someone like you who sees a real problem with the game, but chooses to be a part of that problem.  Hats off to your morals sir.
---
this comment has literally nothing to do with the question asked?
---
Dude, trying to get someone banned for this is yikes.
---
Beautiful.
---
I’m absolutely *loving* the blackout. No more two week old Chinese VNI alts in every Haven. It’s great for the game. Adapt.
---
Some things to consider:
---
*Exploration loot is worth something again.
---
*Skill injectors and PLEX are becoming affordable
---
*NPC kills in renter regions (bots) are waaay down. 
---
*You can actually catch people ratting now. No more dock on sight. 
---
It’s not easy to hear, but we’ll all be better off if the blackout remains. It’s slowly giving us the EVE we remember.
---
That's a naive and short-sighted view of business. If CCP focused on the bittervets that have your type of views the game would be dead in a year or two. New players are **NEEDED** for the game to survive and continue to grow, regardless of how you feel about that.
---
The playerbase that has kept them going all these years is both the old *and* the new. If they didn't have a constant and consistent stream of new players Omega-ing and buying PLEX the game would have shut down a long time ago. You drastically underestimate the amount of income those players bring, considering how many of the bittervets plex their accounts without spending a dime of real money.
---
If you want to keep up you have to play. That's the unfortunate truth of the arms races in the game. 
---
If you have the ability to do the same legal playstyle as other people, and you want to compete you have to play along. 
---
Also, "Morals" Fucking lmao, it's a video game mate, chill.
---
C1 sites. Nobody runs them because the payout is pretty low for the risk. You can run High Sec combat anoms and get a few decent drops and make more ISK with almost no real risk.
---
Sounds pretty shitty unless you go against industrials.
---
I still find the fact that there are dedicated Sisi alliances with their own killboards to be hilarious, and that "go back to TQ!" was used as an insult (i witnessed this happen)
---
Calm down miner.
---
No as in... the "abuse" is a joke by the directors and everyone's in on it.. Not that it's funny that they're letting themselves get pushed around or whatever you think is happening.
---
This one, most times your ship is worth 10x more than the site and you’re earning 20m. However, usually the sigs don’t stack up that hard in c2 systems generally speaking.
---
There is no actual data on who is actually making that isk from WH's only that the source is from WHs...you'd be surprised how many null sec groups take full advantage of farming whs or own farming whs (C5/C6s) which would certainly contribute to those numbers...but it's fine, we agree to disagree.
---
&gt;freedom of speech
---
The thing that applies to governments and not companies?  Yes
---
Yeah Boi  
---
Phoenix use to have a single turret slot with the model on the "roof" lol
---
Credible or not, it's still a direct threat to CCP. He should be banned.
---
Battleship but with eve ships...
---
I was thinking about the same thing at some point - in practice a mobile base, like an orca that you can deploy and then leave in that space with a single rf timer of 24h like a mobile depot. 
---
then you could leave it and board one of your stored ships. Other people could store ships and items much like in a station but with limited hangar space (once it's deployed) or deploy some additional module near it that couples to the same rf timer and acts like a cha/sma worked for a pos.
---
*pants on head retarded*
---
Don’t do home sites, do c3 sites in regular c3 ships. Meta is rattle, then praxis/nightmare, then gila. Multiboxing is your friend too.
---
It'd probably be a bad idea nowadays. You'd probably just have mostly the big blocs move into highsec for a little while, bluing one another to avoid actual fights and farming everything that isn't their blue group for easy killboard green.
---
Remember, in 2008, the game was very different. :P
---
Boy, the real world is going to be tough for you.
---
Blops are in need of their own updates... 
---
maybe not the use of covert ops cloak but maybe can use micro jump drive while cloaked or something cool like that.
---
wait what? man i kinda want that back
---
Gf,  was thrown in local but late, after completing most of extraction. Fight may not necessarily be over if you're still on the field (see the slashers and caracal that died 10 mins after main fight due to tackling a cheeky Oracle trying to loot still)
---
Round 2 started with myself and one other nerd in oracles poking the POS (and alts in system), hoping a fight would show up, and trying to rally more once 6 caracals, 2 vexors, and a nearly limitless supply of slashers kept trying to catch us. Booped several tackle frigs and a couple caracals before they managed to warp off. 
---
Eventually an NOsprey joined us, he eventually got caught, and we had to go reship after failing to save him.  Meanwhile we got a handful more nerds logging in to spring the trap for the 2 Revelations we expected to see.
---
We send in bait dread, they drop cyno inhib 70-80km off as they warp in the dreads we saw log in. We get cyno setup on the other side of the dreads from the inhib. Trap success, but overkill sure... GF rando small group
---
Give them a +10 % per skill level boost to MJD range and in innate 1 warp core stab strength (total).
---
There is no dev time going to designing skins ffs.  In fact *because* there are dev issues that don't involve the art team in the game the art teams likely have time for which they can churn out skins.
---
&gt; Ahhhh..... you're space poor. 
---
Not rich but certainly not poor. Does this mean you are not in favor of giving T2 the third point of tackle while keeping the range shorter than faction? I could ask you the same question. If WCS peace of mind costs 30 mil per mod, will you have to stop buying them?
---
I understand this reference
---
yeah thats the idea... you are giving up security for the sake of extra range. 
---
example... ifyou are in Sam (low sec ammar space) you used to be able to jump to catch in 1 go... now a days you have 2-3 jumps before you get same range... 
---
So in this case you can now jump from Sam into catch but you needs protection as you are very vulnerable during the jump...
---
heck make it so you even show up in local too :)
---
I have very similar story, but I was flying a PVE Dominix. Some guys collapsed the hole to our home. I found an exit in the middle of low sec. I made 40 jumps to back home, where I get bubbled and died exhausted.
---
Yeah, getting old camera back would be amazing.
---
Arhkos Core has, as these BRs show, far too few people that are experienced at the game to realistically expect to hold any sov. You really need to be able to at a minimum fight off a 15-20 man real fleet, and probably more like twice that in the case of serious structure defense, because unless you're able to anchor and maintain a fortizar living in nullsec is a terrible idea.
---
Regardless of who decided they wanted that space, Arkhos would never have been able to hold it on their own.
---
So in other words the peeps who hunt FW sites, were upset because they couldn't gank the ventures.
---
Brexit... also there's probably some shitty euro law that 30% of the sub goes directly to junckers bank account.
---
&gt; Find a single fit of mine anywhere that uses WCS.
---
According to zkilll, you've never lost a ship. Maybe those WCS made you immune to being killed.
---
well sure but so is the unironic "ess jay dubya" thing
---
Did you try to contact him and provide a better fit or explain why it was bad?
---
This is true, most of the pvp whiners just want evenly matched pvp nimber qq the blue o an blob. What they want is dota or lol they exist go play them!
---
There is a grey area inbetween two extremes.
---
imagine thinking pre blackout was 100% safety, imagine if being able to rat in relative safety is the only reason someone can dislike the change
---
Need at least 7
---
That's... Beautiful!
---
I'm saying that mechanic is unfun and there is plenty of other stuff to do .. eve is a big game you know? I want it to be fun in many ways and a whole range of things just turned into 'well you better blue scout or have a super umbrella'.  I don't like that direction. I want 0sec to be accessible for smaller groups cause that's where strong corps are born.
---
How are you applying torp damage to frigates? Last time I checked, which was admittedly several years ago, torps did very little to frigates.
---
That’s coincidence, the actual change was drifter wormholes, which now connect to roughly 60 systems / wormholes at once, probably about 4x more things.
---
He’s not a director, but he’s a person in power. Other alliances probably don’t have “landscapers” so they wouldn’t understand if I asked if their “landscapers” also do this. I guess “junior director” would be a more universal term lmao
---
They can be lit in wormholes.
---
I think maybe you are exactly wrong. Maybe making the game more exciting is better, for new and old players. Maybe continuing the same model will only get the same results and therefore something new must be done.
---
Made me laugh, thanks.
---
Until drifters realize our moons are complete ASS
---
lmfao him saying something in chat is not him admitting anything. 
---
in a game where you can steal, lie, and be scummy, the game devs cannot take any player accounts as “serious admissions of unfair play”. it just doesn’t work like that brother :)
---
He is new and doesn't understand HS mechanics at all. He must of engage after the engagement timer was up and got concorded. Why he never aggroed you in the brutix is beyond me though...probably an extremely new player who doesn't understand what's going on.
---
Eve Trade Master is dead and redirecting to malware sites. I told ya'll last week it was dead.
---
Wormholer btw
---
Maybe release skins for the collectors items too!
---
By writing a public blog, you are delegitimizing one way of arguing for change. I argue that way a lot, and think it's legitimate, so I respond. Its a safe assumption that a healthy Eve should have many viable playstyles. If some got hurt, it's fine for people to voice it.
---
Haha, nullsec was empty before, with some few and between systems showing a ton of activity. Once you jumped in every vni in every anom was in warp to a fortizar.
---
You gotta admit he's got the right mindset though.
---
Nothing you propose will make him/her/they happy, want the pure PvPers want, is for their game play to be as easy and as simple as possible, as they think that Eve is noting more than a PVP combat game.  The same goes for a lot of Krabs, they dont want to think about how they can adapt to the new challenges.
---
Pay with plex and this isnt a problem 😎
---
That's a double edged sword. I got lost for a month in wormhole space, once. Similar situation except I was in a probe and carrying about 150mil in relic site junk
---
Go ahead and continue to ignore the context, I'm sure this person is perfectly innocent and hasn't done anything to break the game rules at all. :)
---
What is your point?
---
&gt; Yet they argue that no asset safety would be a conflict driver
---
I'm one of them but not necessarily for the conflict driver. I just think Eve should be consequential. It's really as simple as that.
---
I'd be satisfied if asset safety was changed in a couple ways.
---
1. No more voluntary asset moves. This part of safety should only trigger if the structure is destroyed or unanchored and not be an evac mechanic.
---
2. I'd probably leave safety as it is with a fee if it's a matter of unanchoring, since there's nothing to drop. However, I would like to do away with a fee if the strux is destroyed and instead give the assets within (personal and otherwise) an identical chance to go into the loot pile to either be dropped or destroyed. That provides attacker incentives for the structures being used as giant mobile depots where you'll get practically no drops otherwise.
---
"You got the wrong ammo in, son" 
---
Nice kills!
---
We used to use them until few weeks ago, mainly in supercarrier ratting systems. 
---
If you supercarrier rat in a system with a POS, if a neutral enters your system, you just warp off to the POS. You can recall you fighters once you are in the forcefield, and jump out directly. 
---
With citadel you are not safe if your fighters are in space.
---
Plus the said neutral can't go through the forcefield, so he can't bump you (like he'd do with a upwell Citadel).
---
It was actualy safer to rat, but was one of the tousands things that caused capital proliferation.
---
Nowaday we just keep some towers as souvenirs....
---
I think what m0rzor is saying (and I agree with) is why not remove the pos system but make citadels similar (imo: at least they should have done the moon anchoring and ref aspects).  I mean it's almost certainly too late to do this now but it would be cool to essentially have a QoL POS
---
BRAVE. I always wanted to like EvE but I could get the hang of it in my starter NPC Corp. I was friggin lost. Couldnt fit a ship to save my life etc. Was scared deathless of PVP. Heard about Brave here. Joined and am almost a daily player now. I love fighting. ( even though I am bad) I feel like I am starting to understand the game.. and they are a great group of people. The stay classy rule is awesome. And they encourage fun over everything.
---
&gt; We don't want to say to people -&gt; want to have a save assets move to bigger block.
---
There's literally nothing you can do to change this. The number of people who are willing to live in a smaller, riskier group will always be dwarfed by those seeking safety in numbers.
---
I mean I'm not sure I'd call 20 bil cheap, but each to their own.
---
I remember rooting so hard for PFR to succeed, and was at least pleased Brave was able to get some numbers out to try and help defend even if we weren’t formally blue. When it fell I was strangely more disheartened than when PL took GE-8.
---
It never was safer than hisec, unless your a are fucking spodbrain who has no clue what is going on outside of a mining belt. It was a lot safer for the risk involved at a ratio.
---
would be cool if they had a bonus that made it harder to scan them out too...
---
money!!! 
---
i started to kill mods in offline pos towers realy late and damm the isk was nice, a nice moon tower had 100m-1B in moon ore in the silos, ofc i had no need for a dst before that so the first weeks i had to use a cloaky iteron 5 to get all the ore out :-)
---
TIL small gang corps, null bloc corps, and solo pvpers at thentop of killboards are actually bad players
---
Barriers to entry for industry are too low for there to be big margins. And markets are infested with people who think they are accomplishing something by crashing the margins when there is one.
---
100%
---
It's why we recommend only approaching Caches anchored by a character under our alliance banner. We can always verify the anchoring character if.youre ( understandably) paranoid
---
that's one way to try to cling to relevancy
---
250euros is 280usd right now... 
---
And they also pay less for a lot of things, is that unfair too?
---
Yea man, exactly. If you could only place them at the moons you would have some choice between having a "military/staging/stockpile" system, an "extraction" or an "Industry" system etc.   
---
If you could rr them and have no damage cap you could just have some nice fights going around. Maybe have some storage structures that would provide some asset safety (but like a thing that requires fuel and a service slot and is turned off if the station is unfueled) etc.   
---
I also think a big loss was the modular structure of the POS - arrangement, etc played some role, you could disable weaponry as you attacked (or choose to ignore, whatever works) - it could have been rewritten and expanded so nice - instead we got the immobile supersupercap version of it. eh.
---
Is it just me or is there a kikimora in that pic?
---
&gt;The issue is that DPS drops off a cliff at opt+.5FO. At max falloff+Optimal (18KM with RFEMP in a stabber) you are doing 40% of your paper dps.
---
If you put 1 tracking enhancer on a stabber, you get 22.5KM fall off.
---
Here is the damage generator multiplier I was speaking about in the previous replies. This is for drones and turret base weapons only.
---

will finish later today. I have work to do.
---
Thanks to only two mid slots it is usually fit for kiting. A skill you should learn but is very difficult to do properly.
---
I have a frw fits I used a brawl fit with an overside cap battery but it has no scram but is cap stable running two reps.
---
Thanks to the punisher having terrible bonuses to weapons (reduced capacitor need) you can use projectile weapons and suffer no additional penalty but have 0 cap use on guns instead of reduced cap use on lasers.
---
If yiu want to kite though I suggest you look at the tormentor. A severely underrated ship.
---
You can get a Nyx hull for about 12b. 
---
For a super, that's pretty fucking cheap.
---
And that would be: (a) Not True
---
I think the modular design is what added a lot of complexity to setup/teardown (and code behind) I'm okay with the normal fitting window in exchange for it being easier to maintain.
---
Hey there, 
---
you can have a look into Mackies Raiders, they are a pirate corps in FW. Mostly not friendly to anyone, so you're free to shoot who you want to. They have daily fleets and biggers ones on week-end. I also suggest to find something else for isk than mining. I[t](https://1.it)'s boring as fuck and you wont get much in a venture/mining barge anyway. You can always do exploration for income, which is more profitable. But if you really want to mine, there is close system by where you can go to. We hand-out ships for fleet so you don't have to worry about buying ships. Hit me up in private if your interested. o7
---
And it is not eve onion news, so has to be true
---
That's cool. I'd almost forgotten about this discussion. New shiny stuff, you see. :)

"And that, kids, is how I met my first bubble."

Glad you had fun.
---
Heat Mechanics: how the fuck do they work?
---
Not asking about "how do I overheat things" or "why would I overheat things," I'm trying to understand the various heat capacity, heat attenuation, and heat dissapation numbers on hulls, and the heat damage and heat absorption rate numbers on modules. Is there a writeup on this anywhere?
---

---
You had to learn that there are timezones and UTC?
---
I knew we helped remove them from tribute, forgot about that vale astra. The grumpy part i was saying more of Iron not gfing in local after what sounded like a super fun fight.
---
Being top of the killboard doesn't make you a genius. I was top solo kills in Brave for 2 months straight until I left so with your logic I am an expert?

In the description of the video it shows the story
---
That was the joke.
---
It's not really roaming unless you're outside an umbrella.
---
Double domini?
---
Homeworld remastered runs nearly stable, and if the amount of model swapping options in the steam workshop are anything to go by that shouldn't be too hard. They already have Gundam, Star Trek, Star Wars etc
---
PFR was great.
---
Yes, your primetime (when you can form a patrol) is when you should be able to rat and mine.
---
NPC Null is also a good idea for a smaller group like yourselves. It gives you guys some.access to null and the dangerous life but as you said with slightly less threats usually from too big of groups. Alsp Venal specifically guristas missions are solid and the epic arc is great if youre newbros are looking for other income.sources.
---
Yes it works. It was done before.
---
If you really want to spice it up you can do a 6 directional bombing run with this method
---
corp board and top boards is 2 different worlds lol
---
What do you think dropping a super on 2 Nomens and a Sabre is? A proper battle or easy ganks?
---
If you wanted a proper battle you'd respond with subcaps which would encourage people to roam in bigger subcap fleets, everyone would have fun fights.
---
Thank you!
---
I was top of the alliance killboard at the end of January and February on solo kills.
---
I have far from a green killboard. You seem to be of the opinion that fighty spaceship sim should only be about taking equal 'honourable' fights against a worthy opponent or some shit. That's just not what I choose to do a lot of the time. On occasion it happens, but given how hard it is to find a fight in null right now I'll shoot anything.
---
If I can use a cap in a way that I wont lose it, guess what I'm going to do?
---
I actually forgot that
---
SALTY YOU MOTHERFUCKER &lt;3
---
\-Kaai, rip my VNI
---
Gonna take my revenge tunite bruh xoxox
---
Your rough estimate is WAYYYYYYYY off.
---
I think it could've been moved to something like a 3d version of the PI management interface or something - not a thing related to the game camera and allow multiple anchoring at once and stuff.
---
That would be cool
---
Cheers. We do too. We held sov for nearly a month until larger "Smaller" entities with batphones pushed us out. We tried to take our own slice alongside Forsaken Empire, but that ended up with (again) a similar sized entity just batphoning literally every fight after we beat them several times in a row and only having 1 member involved in their victories. We're used to being the underdog. :)
---
They’re actually proud of their kills and smug post them in local too. Amazing.
---
Two RR domis are perfect for a C3.
---
Are there stations you dock in overnight? How does that work? The whole time I was in there I was thinking "shit what if I had to log off?"
---
what is old is new again
---
Equally if your top tier you can save a fleet and suicide yourself by booshing the bombs away :D
---
We held it for nearly two months against repeated attempts to knock it down. Goons bashed us during the war, other entities entosised us after, but we didn't lose it until much later.
---
Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with a 5-10 human player alliance holding a single system in sov. It might not be realistic for them to plop down rorquals and forts but an astra with some procurers and ratting subcaps is reasonable.
---
We only took more systems than the original one we ended up with to make it more annoying for a renter landlord to come in and snipe the region, something we expected but never came to pass. We had no intentions of holding more space and were actually looking for people to hand it off to, but nobody took us up on it when we asked.
---
Tbf we saying “you suck” (or any variation of that) in waffles is like Braves 7o thing. It’s something that was serious 14 years ago, but over time has evolved into a meme. We literally coin terms around our best FC’s feeding and it’s a fun thing. I can agree this culture is not for everyone, but it works for us. Also stop being bad and get gud scrub.
---
&gt;and a nearly limitless supply of slashers
---
&gt; Fortunately our tackle ships are intentionally built absurdly cheap, we know we're going to feed them 
---
https://i.imgur.com/y978xi6.png
---
With more already fit. If we're going to feed, feed cheap! That entire stack probably costs about 75m.
---
is the game really struggling for numbers?
---
Yea dude you need a small wormhole group. I happen to know one that would love to have someone like you, I'll have a mail sent along soon.
---
I could have more typed, a friend started arguing and i spent my time explaining him step by step how it worked and why auto cannons favor it. Wasted all my time getting him to understand.
---
In the event you use the safe log off, your ship is removed from space after the 30 second countdown. If you plain old log off, same thing happens except you aren't in control.
---
I'll take your refusal to answer my simple question at this point as a concession that your argument is fatally flawed.
---
Please don't give them any more ideas for VR / Mobile games, because this is exactly how they will read it :/
---
Omg you are pulling this? It really doesnt fking matter who does what. As long as its a massive faucet then it needs to be nerfed. Do you really think NS people are the only ones making isk in NS? It doesnt matter one bit.
---
But lemme guess, you live in a WH?
---
It’s called addiction
---
Glhf
---
Thank you for sharing this story.
---
If you right click your capacitor, there's an option that says "safe log off". Your ship needs to be stopped and all modules turned off, then there will be a 30 second countdown.
---
It's best done by first (at a bare minimum) making a bookmark between two celestials and logging off there, then spamming the shit out of dscan while you wait.
---
I have no clue what that means.
---
Lies, we don't have vendettas
---
But if everyone is patrolling, who is doing the ratting and mining?
---
Says rote 🙄
---
I'm talking fully fit.
---
And how is it cheap. It'd be what 4x the cost of a fitted rorq. I'm wondering how you decide if something is cheap or not
---
oWo cagawi why?
---
His EVE Forum thread is going just as stellar. And by that I mean no one has any idea of what he's rambling about other than "waaaaahh!!!Somethingsomething IHave10AccountsSoIKnowMoreThanYouWaaaaah!"
---
Apparently his 10 accounts and above average IQ, per his own statements, still make it impossible for him to play the game.
---
Because a bunch of neckbeard virgins have profile pictures of clearly underage girls that they call their 'waifu' and 'owo' and it's embarrassing. Weebs also have a significantly higher chance of being a furry than normal people, which makes it even worse.
---
Twas a good fight we were actually trying to get enough people to get online, but legit question... how did you get a warp in on my nosprey with the first cyno without probes
---
not to be a noob, but, what in the hell does this actually mean?
---
what is an FW Plex?
---
Well damn, good to know. Thanks!
---
Just came back after a year and a half and didn’t BM my entrance. All these old feelings of “I should know this shit” came flooding back again 😂
---
A couple years ago they were over 30b, you might remember that.
---
read it out loud
---
&gt; for easy killboard green.
---
I shot a keepstar once. Most people in nullsec have done several. Killboard is green for life.
---
Bots won't die, They will just start dropping the mining drones for Damage drones and putting even more procs on field to hit a critical mass of damage.
---
What this will do, Is fuck over the solo hisec players trying to learn the game and stop them from growing.
---
GG CCP, Once again your changes only reinforce further the larger groups.
---
Rough translation is "shoot your own \[friends\] so the enemy is scared of you"
---
I heard Wingspan Delivery are also helpful chaps...
---
Pretty much. Honestly, they need to turn hisec into an actual safe space if they want to pull more players in. Right now they have an artificially low cap on potential subscriptions by not allowing for pure PvE gameplay. There are plenty of spaces in which to get your PvP on, but none in which you can PvE without threat of PvP invading it. Until that changes, the game will stuggle to grow.
---
I heard the word Idiot i think!
---
You are missing the fact that nothing got lost before. Asset safety tax is already a consequence. You cant just gloss over that fact.
---
For the number 2 I would say no, cause this is what we already have and its no incentive. Why arent people rushing to kill industrial complexes atm? Why dont people evict eachother more often in WHs? There is already proof of this not working. But the assumption that people will leave if they all of the sudden lose their shit is a very sound assumption. Basically that means there is no added incentive and just the negative outcome of people leaving the game. 
---
Number 1, hey I can agree on that. 
---
But everything is a question of priority. Removing voluntary asset moves, sure. I mean if thats the biggest issue people can find in game. But there are tons bigger issues atm and those should be fixed first.
---
Ah. Na, I dont agree. PC culture is shit no matter what direction it comes from. And bitches are bitches no matter which side they are on.
---
As the other people you are making an Ad Hominem Atack. I say i get a Metric useful for me and maybe CCP, and i never say i am better to others (i can pay without problems, bit never say i am better or worst) and  never say is impossible to play. All i say i check an interesting METRIC, and maybe is better unsub if you was Using Money to show support to CCP.
---
Then, maybe the people who are supporting CCP no, dont vote with wallet.
---
You are welcome.
---
Good work in getting away! That's unusual for a new dude, we'd usually get you...
---
Spent about an hour hunting them tonight with a gila.  Pretty easy, nothing too hairy, only ever saw about 3 to 4 drive at a time, just starving/blinding and no scrams.  They just sit around celestials so was good to brush up on my dscan skills. Loot was pretty average but would have been better if I picked a system with fewer celestials.
---
Not at all. Actually a great brawling platform
---
ain't no one got time for a zero context 18 minute+ video

Grappler slows them by 80% painter makes them bigger

no but your not playing my playstyle so your bad

You want peaceful time, you go to high sec. 
---
Also, as someone else said, if you think that in null you should be able to go afk in space to "put your baby to sleep" undocked, in null sec, then you definitely do not belong in null sec. You dock or risk dying, chose one.
---
Long live CCCP
---
&gt; considering how many of the bittervets plex their accounts without spending a dime of real money.
---
I agree with all your main points, but if they aren't paying real money, someone else is. That's how plex enters the game in the first place.
---
the amount of research you put into this easily eclipses the arbitrage potential, i would 100% bet
---
Ok, what is it then?  (Last time I checked one euro was worth two American dollars. I guess Brexit really put the screws to the euro, lol!)
---
i was there,  i remember it being like a very fun empire war, wasnt it something todo with server change
---
I had something like this in a Tier 2 and a Tier 3 although it was last week. Died in a matter of 2-3 seconds when everything seemed OK. I lost two reasonably expensive Gilas. I thought that I must have gone out of bounds because there's no way I could have taken that much damage so quickly (I had less enemies active than you did).
---
If I did go out of bounds it wasn't obvious how or why so after that I gave up. (I had run Tier 2s before some months ago with no problems whatsoever).
---
Wh gas mining is hands-down the best/safest/most profitable way to learn most of the really important things you need to learn if you wanna be a good pilot in New Eden.

If you're ever looking for a new corp, drop me a line. I love pilots with wh gas mining as their background.

And it's never been 1:2.
---
Ok, I guess brexit caused the value of the euro to crash.  
---
Fair is everyone pays the same. What you think is fair is actually UNfair. You just want to call it fair when it is actually exactly the opposite.
---
Just to be clear I am completely fine with the prices the way they are right now. I would rather have unfair pricing and more players playing Eve then fair pricing.
---
Wasn't the famous instance when a group camped jita or yulai and just started skull fucking everyone?
---
I guess I have to fact-check everything I say for internet rolls before I post. Reddit is not a syndicated newspaper. I am allowed to be incorrect once in awhile.
---
Thanks what fit do you use? I have been using the ccp rupture fit but it is so slow I cant get all the cans.
---
Then you convince them to log in and pilot a ship that they can't directly control by using arrow keys and about 15 minutes in they decide the game is too complicated and think you are even more insane for liking it.
---
We actually recommend them when you need to get *into* a wormhole. They charge for it, but it's usually worth it.
---
But people in null didn't quit in droves. Loads of folks that actually want to fight came back which is great. Now it's not just hunting afk ratters and bots. There's actually people shooting back. And nah, I'll keep shooting at everybody.
---
If you had a half-decent intel channel, and were actually paying attention, you basically couldn't die. The vast majority of the time, the reason ratters or miners got caught was because they weren't paying attention.
---
The exception to that is maybe rorquals, but that's a whole other problem.
---
Eve definitely needs carebears. It doesn't mean people won't shoot at them, but they are needed.
---
Depends on where you live and what your obligations (children? mortgage?) are.
---
Is there a "trade router" website? I seem to remember eve-central having one, where it would show the differences between the widest sell and buy orders in the galaxy.
---
Yeah dude, we don't all shop in Delve. Some of us buy shit in Jita.
---
And here, kids, we see an elitist Goons douche bag in its natural habitat.
---
"boohoo someone called me out on my nonsense, obviously a troll!!" Ill leave you to sulk in the corner and yes, if you're going to post something like a fact, best make sure you're right.

Honestly it's less about not watching anime / w/e, it's more about not annoying people who don't give a fuck about it with it. anime in itself is nothing evil, it's just some weebs are no problem, others are by spamming anime stuff all over the place.
---
&gt; We notice they're using the same tactical to light the cyno from round 1 that they're warping to now, so we get a cheeky warpin thanks to bookmarks
---
You were at 100 from your tac so we warped to your bookmark at 100.
---
ok but thats not exactly 100% now, safer yeah sure but 100% is hyperbole

Dated but still mostly-correct info about the T1 frigates, in 2 parts: [Combat Frigates](http://www.evealtruist.com/2012/09/know-your-enemy-t1-combat-frigates.html), [Attack Frigates](http://www.evealtruist.com/2012/09/know-your-enemy-t1-attack-frigates.html)

To find fits:
---
1. Go to zkill and search on "Punisher"
---
2. On top bar, click "Solo."
---
5. Look for green entries, which are solo kill where the Punisher was the victor. 
---
6. Then locate losses for that pilot where they were flying a Punisher. Steal their fit.
---
For example, [here's](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78412494/) a righteous-looking kill of a not-shitfit Merlin by a Punisher. Click over to the victor's killboard and holy shit, he loses a bunch of Punishers. His fit doesn't look too stupid though:
---

---

---

---

---
Looks like he tries to brawl with short-range ammo and a buffer tank.
---
[Another](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78414343/) successful solo by a Punisher. This one killed a destroyer! Pilot doesn't have nearly as many Punisher losses, but if you go far enough back you find this
---
    [Punisher, Shuvy's Punisher]
---
    Capacitor Power Relay II
---
    Nanofiber Internal Structure II
---
    Tracking Enhancer II
---
    Small Ancillary Armor Repairer,Nanite Repair Paste
---

---
    J5 Enduring Warp Disruptor
---
    Small Focused Pulse Laser II,Scorch S
---
    Small Energy Locus Coordinator II
---
    Small Semiconductor Memory Cell I
---
apparently more of a pure kiting fit.
---
You can combat scan any citadel and know the fit
---
Forget the punisher and go for a beam tormentor. Look up suitonia's guide on how to fit it and how to fly.

Well you did drag CCP_Lebowski in to it. If you try to summon him you've got to be ready to feed him a bug report number.

---
Yep. Camped a high traffic entrance into Yulai (Jita 1.0), killing everything while tanking CONCORD. Went at it for hours, until a dev arrived and put a stop to it.
---
Well considering there goons is 60% alts, there is sure to allot of crabbing going on. At the same time we have the largest number of active pvp players so what's your point?
---
CO2, I loved the intensity of the fleets under gigx
---
Not a bad idea!

well we held sov for about a month even before the newbies showed up :P

That I'd agree with. Again, I don't have strong opinions either way, but it does seem the people that really are into Anime spam memes and nonsense far too regularly for me to ignore. I like cars...doesn't mean I plop pictures of cars in every chat I'm in.

Deals 170+ dps out to point range with 3s align. Requires perfect manual piloting, zero mistakes and understanding of tracking (don't go 3.6k m/s with beams against ab brawlers).
---
I find SAARs to be rather useless since you have no chance against drone boats like tristan because welp zero skills zero brain zero cap perfect application to infinity with huge tank. Unless you're doped out of your mind with drugs and 2 bil+ in implants, because without you just don't have the cap to actually use your SAAR. Your enemies are such pussies you have to maintain point from start to finish or lose the kill.
---
You're basically looking to fight brawlers or paper tank kiters, third nano helps in manual piloting and attacking a plex.
---
ST-903 is basically a free mandatory implant for all T1 amarr ships if you're looking to use lazors.
---
Kind of hilarious though.
---
We had a few cloakies getting us warpins from time to time.
---
Look into fittings of your usual Interceptor, Assault Frig, T3 Destroyer, Interdictor etc yourself then look up what speed they're going and what resistances they have.
---
Now look at your Carrier and at the Explosion Radius of your Fighters and their Damage Type.
---
Pyfa really helps there.
---
Also use Dromis to web them down (simulate in Pyfa) and then reevaluate their damage.
---
Move from null and getting dropped on by supers, to getting dropped on by snuff in low the second they lose while having to deal with shitty gate and npc station games. 
---
Sounds like an improvement
---
The doctor either mistimed or misjudged his range. Very lucky and well done!

---
Absolutely true, but once it's in the game it no-longer brings anything to CCP to exist. My point was that the bittervets buying PLEX in-game to plex their accounts don't actually contribute to CCP being able to keep the lights on or improve the game, beyond providing a working ecosystem. The newbros are necessary to continue to introduce that revenue so that CCP can pay salaries.
---
Striking down the newbros or fundamentally changing the game to focus on bittervets is a ridiculous idea by curmudgeonly players that don't understand how business works.
---
If you apply a data hacking module on a citadel, you can see what it’a fitted with.
---
Tank
---
Ohm... Interesting! 
---
I have was considering getting my Fun Phantasm out to hunt them, but with starvings it's probably not a good call &gt;.&gt;
---
You mentioned the loot was "avarege", you mean they do not have the same salvage drops? In occupied systems salvaging those guys could net some really good stuff.
---
There are people like that but they are there as for every other genre, I do love anime as well but I personally get annoyed by the spam of some other weebs as well.
---
It seems you are butt hurt my friend after like 16 hours posting kbords.
---
Yeah I saw that astero but the warp in on my nosprey was perfect. We weren't really ready to drop the first dread and my nosprey went down before we could jump to the cyno
---
AFAIK, the only verification of your location is the address on the credit card (or credit-card-like thing) you use for the purchase.
---
As for the reason, games are generally sold at a lower price in Russia, so CCP is matching their expectations.  The Chinese also pay less for the same reason.
---
How did he make them so intense?
---
You guys saved both your structures and killed one of their caps (and lost only 2). I'd say that's a win in your corner even if the ISK efficiency isn't in your favor.
---
Considering you are a fairly newbie heavy alliance and Iron Armada is allegedly made of hardcore veterans I'd say you did exceptionally well.
---
The best way to fly a punisher is to sell it and buy a slicer
---
I've got the structure pointed!
---
I didn't gloss over it at all. I came right out and acknowledged there's currently a fee and that in one instance I would like to see it change to a drop mechanic that would usually average out to the same basic risk, the difference being that it would be isk sink through asset loss, rather than a straight up isk loss. The other situation (unanchoring) I said should be left in the current mechanic.
---
As for nothing getting lost before, I need to disagree with you. You either had to get an alt in the new owners blues list, got someone to move the stuff for you (usually not free) or you firesold your hangar or lastly, you waited to take the station back like CVA has done at least a couple of times. If you lived in an area with not many stations, you might well have significant assets in a POS and you did lose 100% of that stuff if you didn't evac in time.
---
&gt;I would say no, cause this is what we already have and its no incentive. 
---
I said I wasn't in the conflict driver crowd. I don't really care if the evictions pick up. That doesn't change the fact that a fleet killing a low power strux over a few days won't feel incentivized to kill it if they're getting cool loot drops. I don't expect or really care if it drives conflict in the way of wars or evictions but it would make it worth killing abandoned strux.

woh bro don't kink shame furries they didn't do anything to you

"Carebear shit" can mean many things.  Like selling repossessed equipment on the market; building ships used to gank in highsec; station trading in highsec markets.  None of these violate the Code - rather each one serves to strengthen it.

Why would everyone be patrolling. It's simple division of labour: some people do the ratting and mining, other people do the patrolling.

What's just silly. Of course they do. The higher the value of plex, the more of it is bought. If no one buys plex with isk, no one buys plex with cash to sell.
---
I agree that you need newbros to keep the game running - I'm new myself. But the argument you make just doesn't hold up. Whether a bittervet plexing their account, or a newbro paying for omega with cash, CCP gets paid - and actually gets more when its plex. The value to CCP of someone who uses plex is actually higher. 
---
You need new people to make up for attrition, or to grow, but saying that the old timers don't actually contribute to keeping the game running or to making the game better is simply ludicrous.
---
Well, it’s not that much of a difference, sure you can’t see it from space, but you can still see what’s inside.
---
oh boy
---
which does nothing for large FW plex.
---
Move to lowsec. We want more things to shoot at
---
Can confirm T_T
---
Do not despair fellow men of culture, [Weebfleet](https://discord.gg/thWrsHS) welcomes you with open arms
---
Love it! That's exactly what they are meant for. Just have to tackle one thing successfully and you're ISK positive for a long time on the investment
---
Rick and Morty type subculture I believe. Anime wars are a noble cause.
---
oh YES.
---
If there's an actual war coming within test, I want in on that shit.
---
A second keep in D-P on the same grid so both parties can fight all the time, RvB style, would be a great start.
---
cause rvb is a real corp right with organised fights looool
---
Damn... this is huge!
---
Oh sweet baby jesus
---
We need training in [Defense Against Fresh Fruit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JgbOkLdRaE) apparently.
---
yet another change that will drive people from the game Or into one of the mega alliances/ blocks.
---
Of course not, I'm one of them too. But someone has to do it if you want any chance of hanging onto the sov when someone comes to roll your shit for the luls
---
I mean there was the possibility to disable them separately, which meant anchoring redundant ones etc.
---
Yes. Exactly this.
---
In rare occasions when I'm in hisec and even rarer when I'm mining, can confirm if one has a good pc he could get away with playing other games as well
---
When you think that ccp cannot take more retarded decissions gameplay wise they always say hold my beer
---
Jesus Christ I can only get so erect
---
Yup thats fine, double gila might be better ISK/hr but yep
---
Whao
---
WHAO
---
Ok this is going to get the autistic screeching of the playerbase. I'm getting my hearing protection pronto.
---
Today is a good day.
---
OK *now* we're getting somewhere.
---
I too am experiencing a tingle in my naughty place \^\^
---
Ah, i get ya
---
&gt;When you think that ccp cannot take more long overdue decissions *(sic)*
---
Fix that for you
---
Second this. You could also buy and run 6/10 escalations in a Gila or Ishtar if you're dead set on exploding NPCs.
---
Unfortunately most alliances dont care enough about their subcap ratters to run subcap patrols and engage roamers. They only want to respond via cynos and drop supers to defend heavy assets. They tell you to blame blackout but it's actually their own unwillingness to play together and support their poorer/lower SP members that's to blame.
---
Autistic screeching in 3...2...1...
---
So much nope. This greatly disrupts the super umbrella ‘100% Safe’ for capital / super PvE.
---
This will certainly get more people undocked and doing things in space I'm sure.
---
Could they be any more fucking retarded.
---
Making it harder for the blocs to hotdrop you with overwhelming force will drive people from the game...?
---
Yeah but that's hardly sustainable kb padding. So many are changing to miner 2's it's disgusting
---
No
---
Just queued 2 accounts up for force recon training
---
This is gonna be interesting. Cheaper freight with JF changes.
---
How much of a difference will no cyno ceptors make? Not sure. As people start parking force recons near their krabs they still have cynos ready
---
Blops will be way more expensive since people will be covert cynoing their force recons in to drop caps
---
Yes it's very hard for the big blocs to field recon cynos, how will they cope
---
Holy fucking shit
---
WHERE IS MY BOMBER AT AAAAH
---
This seems like a change that incredibly buffs the already buffed blops spam in null.
---
I wonder why
---
that was my reaction, too.
---
now, this, is chaos.
---
Commence null megablob autistic screeching and claiming that this is going to ruin small groups. 
---
God bless you CCP
---
YES YES YES!!!
---
Flair checks out.
---
Don't even ask that it loud. They might think it's a dare.
---
Blood for the blood god!
---
Interesting idea but way too restrictive. Recons I understand, but who the fuck is going to light a cyno and sit defenseless for 10 minutes in a 5bil glass cannon blops?
---
At a bare minimum it should be all recons, not just force recon, and I'd also argue to include T3Cs. They're expensive and cost skill points if you lose them, providing the risk/investment you're looking for.
---
Weird thought, but if this is an influx of players to Tranquility, doesn't that mean CCP is getting more money because they don't have to partner with Netease (read: give them a cut) for these subs?
---
I want whatever CCP have been smoking recently!
---
Another way of CCP force players to buy skill injectors
---
I've enjoyed exploration (and hunting explorers) in an Astero, and actually enjoyed incursions. For the cost (~600m) the ability to make 100m+/hr with fairly low SP is great. I've also enjoyed Triglavian invasions. Seemed like bad isk compared to incursions, but chance for much higher value drops, plus its different.
---
And as always small gang/WH PVP is great. I base out of a wormhole, and with a few strategic clones and cheap ships I can get to where I need pretty easy - and I never know where our door is going to roll next.
---
Find ship at max range 360°
---
Drop to 10 au
---
Drop to 5 au
---
Drop to 1 au
---
Find the two ranges person is between
---
Drop range to half between the ranges
---
Adjust by 1 au up or down depending on dscan or not
---
Find the general range within 1 au
---
Open everything overview tab
---
Scroll to target range
---
Set dscan to 5° hold v and click things at that range in overview. 
---
Warp to it
---
Repeat
---
Completely untrue. Large empires are the only groups that can support having 10+ people a in force recons at a time. For a small group if they lose their 1 lach they are fucked
---
ccp really just needed to drive the skill injector price back up as every jf pilot injects bombers and cyno 5 into 10 alts huh
---
make a third cyno type that only works on jfs and doesn't need covert cynos and we're cool, as it stands this is kinda fuckin ridiculous
---
YES
---
MOIST
---
Wrong.
---
YES YES YES YES YES. Breath... YES YES YES YES
---
I would add Russia to that as well. Let them bot each other to death on their own server.
---
I actually dont think i like this change at all. Its far far too restrictive.
---
&gt; If you right click your capacitor, there's an option that says "log off safely".
---
It's also in the "esc" menu.
---
So by balancing the game play in favour of the little guy... That everyone was angry abut the opposite happening with blackout is retarded? This is providing better role based gameplay and killing the umbrella unless they actively have a cyno near by. Did you use the umbrella often?
---
So the bomber meta is now the only game in town.
---
This is gonna be funny as fuck
---
Wtf I love CCP now
---
Pogchamp
---
So literally 10 of the least tanky ships in eve can light a cyno?
---
Too restrictive, imo.
---
Cyno restrictions are well overdue, I'm just confused about the choice of ship restriction. Those ships have a role for covert Cynos already. Maybe Combat Recons should get this role?
---
AYYYYYYYY LMAO
---
Dont run a 2 billion ship in a place where if something goes wrong you lose everything? Especially if a 4-50p mil ship does it damn near as good.
---
Там еще были 2 попытки прожать МВД не сняв клоку.
---
it unironically is going to significantly negatively impact any small-med size group that regularly uses capitals, as the play is far more telegraphed, and they have far less pilots to spare for such a task. Why would a 1000 man blob care if they need to have 3 pilots switch from dps to an arazu
---
that would be skill extractor monies :P
---
Yeah, I think I would have preferred the third cyno solution, personally.
---
dis thread gon b gud
---
All the cyno alts are gonna be biomassed and so many people are gonna flood the subreddit about quitting eve, etc. I can't wait for this dumpster fire because it's gonna be lit.
---
Look what we have here bois.
---
First rvb doesnt have arranged fights.
---
Second better KB????? What do you mean?
---
I should ask some corpies of you if you a retarded something who have no glue at all
---
Really i should join your open channel. 
---
Ans ask ppl ther if they teach you something. 
---
Or decline you to post such shit
---
Better killboard i laugh my ass. Do us all a favour and biomass yourself if you play. For the kb.
---
If you proud to have such a KB and judge other for theres. You are the worst of the worst. Come to Black rise son and we show you how to pvp. Not only be in fleet with buddies and shoot stuff together.
---
Not 500 kills and think he is better then someone.
---
Lol
---
&gt; Being in a faction warfare corp is it completely necessary to have an out of corp hauler?
---
A good corp will have a hauling service available.
---
Looking forward to Mittens telling everyone not to panic because GSF is the most organised and will have Battleships ready to save everyone who gets tackled.
---
Okay, maybe I'm too dumb, but why blops BS? What's the use case there? Cost aside, anyways.
---
&gt; Cheaper freight with JF changes.
---
How do you anticipate this making JF freight cheaper?  Right now rookie ships cost zero ISK and a cyno alt can be skilled in a couple of days.  
---
Now a cyno alt will need cyno V + a significantly more expensive hull (and skill requirement). 
---
I only see this making JF services cost a LOT more.  If you live 2-3 cynos away from Jita, you are suddenly going to have to have a lot more SP on a lot more accounts *and* budget for 90-100 mil of ship losses per trip.
---
Fuck this change. Fuck the fact that i now have to train cyno 5 on various alts just to move a JF around now.   
---
Also I was so hyped to finally get to actually make some ISK in game but i guess that will go down the drain come september as well :D
---
When did small groups cyno a capital against an umbrella ?
---
Adapt or die kEk. dabdab.
---
How is this going to lead to cheaper freight? If anything it makes logistics more expensive because you need more expensive ships to move them.
---
You would be surprised. Fitting a cyno on a rookie ship is much easier to do
---
Also the groups that can teleport across vast areas of space quickly via Jump gates to save stuff viably.
---
Hoooooooly fuck boys. 
---
Holy fuck.
---
tbf it's still in worse shape than eve :P
---
Or you just always have some recons
---
pants on head retarded armt you lmao
---
Overheard in Goons Discord Server after the CCP news post:
---
“He got me,” Mittani said of CCP Rise's dunk over him. "That f***ing Rise boomed me."
---
Mittani added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.
---
Mittani then said he wanted to add Rise to the list of Devs he pays off this summer.
---
They really need to massively buff cycle times to go with this change to justify using a recon cyno, I don't think 300m+ cyno ships that will die every time you use it is fair.
---
Overwise A+++
---
Well, as of this change I'd say people that want to light a cyno. And I mean you can T2 fit the things, people only bling fit them because the chance to lose them has been low. And it's not like there might be triage coming through the cyno that can save your ship right?
---
Small groups generally have many more specialized pilots. Half the toons in big blocs have ratting characters trained and an alt that can light a cyno in a rookie ship
---
&gt;save everyone who gets tackled
---
I don't think in the history of GSF has the mentality been other than "retarded krabs die, lol"
---
Can tell that blackout and VNI nerf didnt cause enough people to switch for buying plex for income.
---
Yeah any large bloc will simply be able to drop a recon in any system with activity and drop onto that. Free up some utility high slots on rorqs. Only risk is cyno dies pretty fast then, and you can't really hard cyno ever. Probably reduces chance of any capital scale engagements though.
---
ohboy ohboy ohboy
---
If they are so easy to proliferate why aren't your group proliferating 10 or so anticap dread alts to drop on the one or two capitals people drop on you? in being baited?
---
They should give Blops battleships a bonus like 90% cycle reduction otherwise why pick them over recons ever
---
[evenews24] Sources: Mittani is beside himself. Driving around downtown New Eden begging (thru texts) CCP Falcon for the address to CCP Rise's home
---
Epic CCP now you have to train into a cyno, and then also be forced to train into a recon / blackops before you can do anything.
---
Also good job restricting cynos to only a handful of ships, why no alternatives for when you're just casualy lighting a cyno on a Keepstar or similar. Now you need costly recons all over the place instead.
---
Krabs will just cloak up a recon on grid with their caps. I suppose that is one way of getting more subs.
---
ZOMG ZOMG. Blops will finally have a role other than bridging.
---
this won't really change how we save krabs, we use ceptors atm now we will just have to use ceptors to give force recons a warp in to light a cyno. yea it requires more accounts but that seems to be what ccp is pushing for with these changes.
---
Because it's not intended that way. PVE Ships (especially capitals) can no longer gain perfect immunity from their supercap umbrella that way. They are either forced to have a BO or FR ship near them or just go in dry.
---
https://i.imgur.com/74M8lVA.jpg
---
well, that's retarded
---
Rorqs can't cyno? Queue goon REEEing.
---
I made it a personal reference.
---
There's gonna be a lot of dead caps.
---
Can't wait for the amount of 'retarded krabs' to increase dramatically if they carry on using soups then.
---
It was clearly a very deliberate decision to include only these relatively fragile ships (for their size/cost). T3C cost and SP loss hasn't been prohibitive for many, many years.
---
"please please please hit our metrics in the acquisition deal before the deadline" basically
---
Only read the other statement above my friend. You
---
Tell someone to orbit with arty i need nothing more to know about you.
---
You are a totally noob and thats all i need to. Know
---
Much like NC.
---
Plus for O-plexing it's just terrible to do it with a low dps pvp frig (kite condor), so every Oplexing pvp fit I make requires to have above 100dps or each site would take 30 mins
---
I like it.
---
The second, and probably fatal bullet to the art of ganking capital-class null crabs. Not that it really matters, the shitty blackout sent all those people to goons, hisec, or made them unsub.
---
Utterly fucking retarded. Every style of emergent capital gameplay has been gutted in an instant. Probably the fatal bullet for me as well.
---
He's not opposed to balance but this is probably the worst way they could have balanced cynos.
---
&gt;regularly uses capitals
---
Or JFs at all
---
Neither can we
---
I'm counting on it
---
I'm confused, why cyno 5? It says they can jump to covert cynos, not only jump to covert cynos. Is cyno 5 needed for one of those ships?
---
In the Chinese server, PIBC CEO's name is "Mantou", which means dumplings). And his followers call themselves as "Mangou" which sounds like Mango in English.
---
Also honestly still think that a faster inhib or a way to "turn off" a cyno may well be better than this. As I can see this just wiping out small groups and pushing people even more in to large blobs. The large blobs won't have any issue circumventing this.
---
People will just headshot the recons and leave, 400 mil kill mail is fairly appealing.
---
&gt; fuck ratting carriers
---
- ccp
---
This may be the least thought out change in the history of video games. The coming weeks are going to be hilarious.
---
Exactly my thoughts at first. People will just have the recons ready if they're tackled. Now you need (even) more accounts subbed..
---
CCP Rise strikes again
---
Oh, fuck yes.
---
What this does kill is the escalation chain for fights, which is sad to see. Your most tanky cyno ship is now a slaved redeemer with like 250k ehp @ 2b+.
---
Imagine trying to drop on a carrier group and they insta kill your recons before the bulk of your fleet loads, this change just limits the scale of fights imo.
---
We're about to be buried in nullbear salt.
---
&gt;  cost skill points 
---
If CCP hadn't made SP an exchangeable asset that might matter.
---
[why would you want it to leave?](https://media.giphy.com/media/TJAQ0db5zli6s/giphy.gif)
---
Sure. They could have done it incrementally. You will adapt and survive. But this is chaos. What did you expect? Subtlety?
---
Eats more popcorn
---
You have to fit the covert cyno.
---
My biggest concern is that the cost for jump freighter cyno just went up by ~35 million (covops frigate and covops cyno).  
---
Just moving caps around also got more expensive, because you need a recon sitting at the station now instead of a rookie ship.  
---
Moving supers and titans around with suicide cynos face the same fate, unless you want to do multiple suicide recons (should not put a really big dent if you are a titan pilot, but still)
---
I fail to realize how this is in any possible way a good change, this does NOTHING to delve or super umbrellas except some braindead solo members will die to a nanogang in their carriers now, the rest will just have a cloaky cyno ready 
---
this just makes setting up dreadbombs and fleet fights more aids, great job ccp, I told you not to listen to braindead suggestions on reddit and here we are
---
I must be dreaming. This can't be real. 
---
Thank you, CCP.
---
Death to ratting supers.
---
This is one of the worst ideas CCP has had in a long time.
---
if you're using a JF you're using semi-disposable cynos so your only real option is covops with this change
---
using force recons is basically waving chum at everyone in the entire region to camp your cynos for the killmails
---
if you don't want to lose a 400m rapier every time you jump and instead lose a 40m bomber, yes, it is necessary
---
It never was worth even close to twice as much in at least a year..
---
And everyone sells stuff lower elsewhere in the world. Steam games if bought from russia they're less expensive as well. It's not unfair, it's fair for everyone.
---
Lmao I suggested the BS only restriction in the thread about Falcon's comments.
---
Not claiming to be the source of the idea, just crazy to see.
---
Covert cynos don't show up on the overview and are only open for 60 seconds. Unless someone is really committed to watching a bunch of forts really aggressively, you're probably pretty safe.
---
Also with the blackout, you could just light the cyno at a random spot in space and jump in the JF and no one would ever know you were there.
---
WHTATHEFUCKKKKK
---
if the problem was the super umbrella. why not make it so capitals cant light cynos. its a lot less restrictive
---
Here is the consern i have for this. 
---
This makes grid control from one party far easier then before. Give me a handful of bubblers. Enough dps to alpha a blackops battleship and I can control the range  any capital can join my grid. 
---
I have not been a fan of the changes made mostly because they driving a focus on either instanced pve, or grinding industry/ratting to a stand still in null. I am not really sure what there end game is, but currently they right now they are removing the fish from the ocean. To such a point that only the fishers are left. 
---
On a postive note. The widow now has a roll again as a tanked cyno
---
everyone has to have a cyno alt now, having a recon alt is needed now more than a fax alt
---
CCP - fuck small alliances in general.
---
yea it literally kill capital escalation
---
Doesn't this change just benefit large, rich factions further? They will have a much easier time affording to throw away recons and have the ability to protect them vs the lone player or small corp.
---
Why are you going to have shop losses per trip?
---
A `hard cyno` for a dreadbomb or something I'd imagine . . . But the tankiest blops still gets blapped instantly in any fleet fight.
---
Higher skill groups will probably be fine, but the TAPI, GOON, Frat tier dread pilot will likely miss the cyno.
---
Also a mandatory 1.5b+ feed to dreadbomb is a bit silly.
---
Evict fetuses not wormholers.
---
Nah, most cyno alts are at cyno 4 already so it's a couple weeks to get cyno 5 and train to sit in a prospect.  If anything this is a buff to JFs since they won't have a giant system wide beacon telling everyone where they are coming in.
---
&gt; just casualy lighting a cyno
---
I think the point is, casually lighting a cyno is not supposed to be a thing.
---
1. Brilliant.
---
2. I'd like to see anoms be replaced by agents and missions as an ihub upgrade. L1 or 2 missions can be local system warp-tos 3 and 4 should require one or two jumps to get to the encounter. Level five should require at least three jumps.
---
the second one would mean more ratters jumping gates but hunters would need to scan them down if in the mission. It would slow down isk generation and add risk while allowing all individual pilots to earn isk (the way anoms work, one guy with a couple of alts can make it not worth even trying to run hubs since they're taken as soon as they spawn). A lot of that generated is today is going into a smaller number of individual pilots than you think. Having missions would leave things a bit less optimized.
---
JF'ing without cyno 5 :FeelsWeirdMan:
---
yea im looking forward to camping lowsec/highsec border systems just for T2 frigate cyno kills
---
I expect intelligent design decisions, not choosing the worst option for the memes.
---
*checks market* dude where are the recons?
---
Triglavian Reddit-bots, genius!
---
To provide the most over powered instantaneous response in gaming history? Sounds Balanced to me.
---
Although real talk, yeah it could be a bit much but... Chaos? Haha
---
I don't even fly capitals but restricting regular cynos to only recon and blops battleships seems odd to say the least.
---
Cool so I can claim I killed whatever I want and you won't mind? You guys won anyway, why bother making things up you can't prove? It makes no difference in the end.
---
Something tells me these hadn't made their way through the CSM and if they did CCP probably didn't listen to their input as usual.
---
Its as if thousands of cyno alts voices cried out in terror and then were suddenly silenced.
---
Actually renting is another cancer killing this game and needs to go. I wish everyone would just murder their renters and consolidate their space. Renting has the same problem as pos mining: one person manages it, so all the wealth centralizes. Inevitably, the largest rental empires always result in RMT. This shit needs to stop.
---
if anything this makes super umbrellas more powerful in their own space, you can reship your cynos in your own space but if a gang tackles a super and wants to drop some dreads to kill it they will have to have a few recons with them to do so.
---
RIP to all PVPers who source their caps by buying from public contracts and F to all WHlers who need kspace to move caps efficiently. not well thought out.
---
ur fukin retarded
---
Because they are to expensive to welp for a fast cap re-position?
---
So when a blops gang comes and you are some small guys want to actually kill part of big blingy ships, you can... you can, eh, watch them warping off at the best case.
---
All the good things end someday.
---
I FUCKING LOVE YOU CCP!!!!
---
&gt;***REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
---
aDapT oR DiE :DDDddd
---
No nostalgia here, i HATE pos's. I hate them with he rage of 1 trillion sons. I will launch every gd firework i can get the moment they are removed from eve. I will spit on there grave.  They need to go
---
small group don't farm with super and with the blackout they don't even farm with carrier anyway  
---
fuck the umbrella, praise the chaos
---
I don't really understand your point. I already acknowledged the effects that ships have on a given missile system. I'm talking about the base weapon here.
---
That's a lot of extra steps to get your caps in, which is if nothing else close to the reaction time asked for in the past with 'spool up' on cynos at worst.
---
I personally think this is an over-reaction. If super umbrellas were so important to the life of the game, why did people play for years without them?
---
Also cyno chains already require omega.
---
This is a long way off for you, but the pots of gold for gas  mining are the Instrumental or Vital Core Reservoirs. You'll only find those in deep wormhole deep, and they're guarded by very powerful battleships (my corp mates had to bring a Paladin or dual Leshaks and play smart). However, you could probably make 20 mil just in the short time before the battleships spawn. Try it out next time you're feeling brave.
---
This is a big nerf to the supercap umrella imo. Idiots are now required to rorq / super krab with a recon on the field
---
Except this hurts people dropping the null empires more than the other. 
---
Also, they should nerf nanofagotry next. Why should ships go fast, get good range, damage and sig radius. If they want true chaos they should nerf them next.
---
Amen neighbour.
---
Using JF's without having alts with cyno 5 is :FeelsWeirdMan:
---
That’s what they are for right?
---
I cannot get enough of the salt on the official forums.
---
Durability
---
I'm already having trouble focusing on my work...
---
Nerf progression, kinda dumb
---
nah man, the braindead redditors not having done shit in the game so far are happy
---
It is now. Since this announcement they've jumped from 190 mil to over 430 mil
---
Oh that's cute
---
Oh no the horror
---
Holy fuck lol how expensive do you think a rapier is
---
Well, shit, this is going to be fun...
---
No nullified cynos is good though.
---
RIP all the JF pilots that dont have Cyno 5 and a T2 frigate trained
---
See what happens when you quit the CSM
---
You are delusional.

All with no more than 10 dreads. Some with 5 or less
---
This is ccp. They were already making the worst and most stagnating changes... Literally the best thing they did was the addition of citadels. And that's not even gameplay based. They decided that wasn't working and to get funky with it. I mean we have all seen the numbers coming down slowly over the past 7-9 years from the hay days of 2010-2012. The running joke is eve is dying. I love this, spices up the game. We can blame them of going after skill extractor money but I'm happy either way. Adapt or die. Embrace the chaos
---
2nd best place after GBR?
---
CCP says, “fuck you.”
---
Okay, so they don't want the big blocs to use their supercapitals for defense. What does that leave?
---
Why are y’all loosing ships in JF trips?
---
Recons die very easy
---
Mining, they broke mining.  Twice.  Once in exodus when pos's were introduced, they made a small adjustment on sisi and you could no longer mine. Period. Mining lazer would fire and it would error.  Was luckly found by an old corp mate of mine 1 week before deployment.
---
They broke mining again a few years later but had time to fix it.  The pos code ws built on for other stuff, irs why outpost had to die too.
---
Sucks to suck.
---
That's the point of the change. CCP is just looking for more money.
---
I think he's trying to say the game isn't adapting and is going to die
---
Where were you when the day the "bailout my dumb plexing ass" and "everything tanky is a bait cyno" died?
---
Just sounds to unnecessary to me if you're just moving your capital, which is somewhere in your space over to, let's say, a new staging.
---
At the very least you'll have to cloaky camp in a recon instead of bombers, if that's a positive at all.
---
&gt; Now you need costly recons all over the place instead.
---
Bob forbids you have to actually invest something to use the most powerful class of ships in the game.
---
Oooh ok gotcha.
---
Just reminded me of old corps that were quite like this is all lol
---
Cyno 5 is needed for covert cynos.
---
Some predictions:
---
- Whaling will get many of the desired buffs but this change is stronger what I ever advocated for.
---
- Capital vs. Capital escalations will get interesting but not necessarily positively. You'll need a recon for each escalation, and have something like 5-10 seconds windpw to jump your fleet. Imagine stranded capitals all over the place, some spawning at the sun.
---
- Moving capitals unsupported just became a lot more costlier.
---
- JF people will need to switch to moving covert alts, or pay something like 50b per trade route to grow cyno alts.
---
- Lowsec people will get covops frigate kills here and there, instead of corvette kills, which is an improvement.
---
Have you ever tried to cyno into Odebeinn, Podion, or Hothomouh?  Any station normally used for JF cynos will become just like those stations.
---
Cap escalation should not be a second or third thought. "Just fit a cyno to everything" is rediclous and deserves to be removed. Some will argue this changes nothing, so therefore don't change it. But that is bad discussion.
---
Now Rorqs have to be guarded by a cyno alt. This changes nothing. Of course it does. Now a damage-immune fleet cannot cyno in with millions of hp. A dedicated cyno ship is more vulerable than a carrier, dread, titan with a cyno fitted.
---
CCP stop! i can only get so erect!
---
"I'm about to end this man's whole career"
---
Hehe... oh sweet summer child... look up 'titan bowling'
---
i think i will be able tho hear him climax here in europe lol
---
Absolutely fantastic, thank you CCP! &lt;3
---
For the upteenth time:
---
Yes it will hurt small groups. 
---
But it will hurt big groups more than small groups and that is the point of all this.
---
All my cyno alts can do covert cyno because blops anyway :)
---
&gt;These changes will 100% kill EVE, no questions asked
---
I have a lot of questions actually but 
---
***BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD, SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!!***
---
yea exactly, so many recons are going to die anyone doing T2 production is loving life right now
---
My dick can only get so erect.
---
Big bloc tears and small gang hunters paradise. 
---
What a time to be alive
---
Your acting like using a VNI for combat anoms is the only way to make a profit in null, one you can use a Gila or a BC/BS, and two, there are other activities that make isk.
---
maybe because olmeca gold pushed this ? lol
---
The one class that might be a good addition to that list would be Marauders. Give them an actual purpose again: semi-hard cynos with bastion.
---
Can we get ride of JF, have everything gate it back like the good old days.
---
Even the salt is now moving kilometers per second with this one.
---
It doesn't though. People who want to go out hunting people usually have things like arazus and rapiers on hand, regardless. Cynos won't be instant like on a sabre sure but you're still very much dead, even more so without being able to cyno fax onto yourself. This only hurts super umbrellas.  
---
 It turns the idea of nullsec into the boogeyman it should be, that nature of being the great unknown has been lost for a long time now, with people considering null to be safer than highsec, the time for that is coming to an end, it's the game ccp wants to make, so it's the one they should make. If they feel the game is stagnating and they want to change it, I will be onboard with them all of the way, I don't want a game designed by the players, that's how games die.   
---
I want a game developed by a bunch of passionate developers who only want to improve their product and the experience it provides.
---
You just killed lowsec. You dumb morons
---
Time to sell all capitals. Buy millions of frigs and destroyers and head to hisec to ruin every care bears day on Alpha accounts that will never give CCP a cent.
---
Lol I appreciate you and your r/NBA memes all over these comments.
---
This and suicide cynos for solo titan/super movement
---
nah, small group don't even use Rorqual/super and with the blackout they don't even farm with carrier anymore (can't defend them) large group umbrella are the only affected here
---
So we can't have big fights ever again and you think this is a good thing?
---
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
---
gonna be a profitable couple months
---
Gila's had a nerf too just further back
---
I any engagement that isn't a one sided gang, the blob will be instantly deleted before any rep can ever come through the warp tunnel.
---
As if you care
---
&gt; this just means needing to spend isk or RL money to get alts trained up
---
[https://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gif](https://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gif)
---
I'm literally shaking rn
---
spod bless
---
The people who get saved by the umbrella are the same people who are most likely to get a recon alt to sit in the same system.
---
If you get caught, you warp the recon in.
---
hyperspatial ratters will die before help arrives so that's a plus.
---
Capitals shouldn't move on a regular basis.
---
It will massively impact how you save krabs. Standard fits all have a cyno. Vni’s ! Gila’s ! Myrms/domi’s carriers rorqs and supers all have them as standard. I imagine those with the ability to will have a cloaked recon alt on grid with them but many won’t.
---
Actuslly ccp double said fuck you because they even considered jump freighters and didn't care. It's pretty clear ccp still doesn't play their game or have any idea how nullsec logistics work.
---
&gt; What do you think dropping a super on 2 Nomens and a Sabre is?
---
And they dropped a covetor?  If you want rules, stick to clash royale or AT tournament. If you wanna kill the super launch inhib, jam the fighters, and kill the super.
---
OH HOLY SHIT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT
---
Downvoting the fuck out of this thread. literally nothing good will come from this.
---
Don't get flair baited
---
This idea is almost as bad as banning me was.
---
LOL i didnt even consider this, moving your titan through lowsec with suicide cynos will now cost you ~500m a go
---
because a noobship has like 500 hp and it's trivial to pop it?? im confused as to how you intend to defend a reaper with literally no modules but a cyno fit
---
Lowsec was already dead lmao
---
Agreed. Arazus were my favorite ship but now they're going to be stupidly expensive. Maybe I will have to look into a lach...
---
Is that really such a big deal? You already have the alts, and are flying the most expensive, capable freight ship in the galaxy?
---
I thought cyno beacons, and ships lighting cynos on grid near busy stations let JF move through friendly null easily?
---
https://imgflip.com/i/3809b0
---
Rapiers and arazus all bought out in hubs within minutes of the post and relisted 200% +. God dammit I missed the boat
---
Forums already under heavy load.
---
You mean supercap slugfests where all you do is press F1 and watch Netflix while tidi plays out?
---
Yes. It's a very good thing.
---
Because like excavators most hunters only want targets that don't fight back. So they will hunt jf cynos often, meaning you'll need a Covert cyno.
---
Tank? Force recons are pretty weak. Although I guess we will see what the player base figures out
---
abloo bloo cloaky bloo
---
Because an arazu can get wrecked by a one man tornado
---
K then use a recon if you're not that confident. You still have multiple options and nobody with a gun to your head forcing you.
---
More fun than EVE is gonna be seeing as CCPs agenda is apparently to make 0.0 not worth living in at all. I'm gladto see CCP dumpstering their own game though, perhaps it was better when they were busy dumpstering side projects after all.
---
It shouldn’t be easy to just move your capital across space
---
I really wanted a force and combat recon this month...
---
Never, but they used capitals in mid range brawls.
---
Gonna be a lot harder for them to cyno them in now. Their recon ship will be popped instantly and then nothing, no cap cyno to go up and bring others in. Big blocks will have 3+ recons to cyno in their stuff. I don't think it is a good change
---
Build as a pure health brick with a tackle, go flop about like you're an idiot, and have your fleet jump on the bastard who took the bait.
---
Fun times.
---
I think you're projecting bud
---
So much salt in the forum.eveonline - love it as much as the changes sofar!
---
Go CCP you are on the right way! - or as goons always say: "We really don't want to wreck the game... just your (type of playing the) game!"
---
Can I falsely accuse you of being responsible for this change?
---
Explain?
---
Super telegraphed having a recon in your small gang.
---
It's a pleasure for me to see this screenshot share with other communities ...
---
Agreed. Making it this hard to escalate on the field is a bad thing.  
---
I could get behind requiring cruiser and up or similar.  
---
But restricting it to this narrow ship class will be bad for content on the overall.
---
&gt;Now Rorqs have to be guarded by a cyno alt. This changes nothing. Of course it does. Now a damage-immune fleet cannot cyno in with millions of hp. A dedicated cyno ship is more vulerable than a carrier, dread, titan with a cyno fitted.
---
if they wanted to acheive that, why not make it so you cant fit cynos on CAPITALS
---
I can blops bridge my t3 and then blops bridge my recon within 10-20 seconds of each other b/c I, like a large number of goons, have 15+ alts - 6 can use blops, all 15 can use recons and t3s. With that said this is absolutely crushing everyone else.
---
"why did people play for years without them?"
---
You are either dumb or lack little game knowledge illustrated by this particular comment. The time frame of which people played without super umbrellas is the same time frame blackops battleships were very rare, there were little dreads, t3 cruisers weren't a thing, carriers used normal drones and could remote rep, probes expired, anoms didn't show up as clickables, and nothing was nullified.
---
Laughing like a lunatic.
---
Yes of course it is, but if someone's got the resources to send a lot of recons, it is gonna be a large null bloc
---
I am pretty sure CCP or the CSM also did not think about it.
---
Would you say overall a good or bad change?
---
Yes because Arazus and Rapiers are such valuable, sturdy ships that will surely survive and be of great benefit when suddenly stuck motionless on grid for 5 minutes. And they surely won't suspect a thing when I suddenly bring an Arazu instead of a Lachesis.
---
Additionally, I now need to take an actual useful pilot out of my fleetcomp to fulfill the cyno role, instead of using someone's random ceptor or dictor alt that does nothing else. I am also stuck positioning it around bubbles, instead of being able to dictate the range at which I engage with my capitals with an interceptor.
---
All of this is bad for me, as an attacker with a small-medium size fleet, with limited capital escalation potential, especially if I am attacking a much larger defender in their own space, with virtually unlimited escalation potential. My play is now slow, clunky, and telegraphed. And when fighting a group of my own size, I am now gimped a not-insignificant portion of my fleet in any subcap engagement just simply because I *have* to bring shit recons instead of decent ones, if my fleet is even of the size where recons would begin to be appropriate (re:over 15-20)
---
You never EVER jump to a beacon with a JF. You also never use someone else unless you know they are safe. Currently i need 3 cynos up to get from highsec to null. One of them is easy as its "close" but the other two have to be staged. So need to now train up cyno 5 on both alts and get them appropriate ships and bits to actually do it.
---
How?
---
Yes. But if they’re killing a super under an umbrella I imagine they are in fleet ready to go. Whereas your umbrella will need to get help there as opposed to the super just lighting a cyno
---
[Remember when Hilmar talked about making big changes and how he'd rather do the wrong thing than do nothing to undo some of the control and comfort that's been established?](https://redd.it/bsewv6) 
---
Seems like they're actually delivering on it. I for one am very excited.
---
shit is fucked
---
t.wormholer
---
Imagine being completed, utterly blinded by Goon koolaid.
---
Lol do you even know what escorts are
---
Why are you jumping the freighter to a place where the cyno is being attacked? I thought the whole point of JF in null was to jump from citidel grid to citidel grid in safety?
---
I mean it is great for people who want to roam in bombers and T3Cs. Good luck making isk now though, better have already gotten rich prior to CCP nerfing things.
---
If by kill you mean not be able to blob with caps and turn literally anything into a bait cyno, then maybe they've done the opposite?
---
If you're gonna use a buzzword like projecting at least make sure you're using it in the right context
---
I'm pretty sure that getting rid of suicide cynos were on the docket
---
Yeah, not 100% sure the reason. Maybe make the fitted a bigger module or no ceptors.
---
But overall it does t bother me much. Cynos are still going to be there regardless, just in a new ship.
---
The price will come down as production adjusts.
---
what makes you think the ccp even asked the csm about these changes?
---
Nobody uses tornados outside of highsec and the tama gate.
---
Not really all i do is swap my cyno frig for a cyno recon. It hurts escalations in fights.
---
CCP just invented DDoS by Salt.
---
Well then you better be fucking fast since cov cynos don't show up on overview, last only one minute, and don't show up on the map.
---
A free BLOPs to every man, woman and child!
---
They know. They don't care. +1
---
Do you think requiring JF pilots to have organized move ops with on-grid defense &amp; logistics fleets will make JF freight cheaper?
---
If you're not in a mega coalition already then yeah most of the non mega alliance regions the game is dead.
---
Weak cynos that can easily be poppped?
---
The directon of the change is good, it is just to restrictive
---
Yup us Brits are looking forward to reduced sub prices once we Brexit.  Will be interesting to see how they work the server being in London but sure it will be fine, might even become cheaper for all.
---
Awesome change and very good for the game.   Much more dangerous for ratting carriers, supers etc.  I have  to say it will be easy to  adapt for large groups.  Every mining fleet will have  multiple arazu's cloaked around the grid.
---
blops have t1 tank so right out the gate they have lower resists
---
Yep. Gonna take about 40 days of MCT per cyno char for me.  
---
Plus about 40 mil per jump rolled into the costs.  
---
Rough back of the napkin math says JF cargo should increase by at least 50%
---
No. The people who are impacted most by this change will probably just leave quietly. You won't hear anything from them.
---
rip pankrab
---
implying ccp listen to the csm
---
you want the nullseccers to be raging over the changes right? last I checked in that thread its a lot of yay great change. you're projecting what you want it to be
---
I'm the fucking koolaid man you failed condom result.
---
Didn't say it would make it cheaper, just reduce losses. 
---
Not that I give a flying fuck about jump freighters lol.
---
to fit a covert cyno you need cyno 5
---
CCP have finally lost their minds. A totally insane change with no consultation. 
---
Oh don’t mind me, I’ll use my black ops battleship that took hundreds of days to train and costs billions of isk to light a cyno.
---
I am not a very expirienced Player... why is this change so significant? Please tell me, I wanna join the hype.
---
CCP isn't forcing me to purchase skill injectors.
---
I don't feel this is an extortion attempt because I have no intention of buying skill injectors because of the change.
---
I forgive you for the knee jerk reaction. Some nights ago one guy was shitpostig in Jita Local whilst drunk, best night of eve I've ever had

Empty self-posts are automatically removed. Please post again, but this time include your thoughts or comments to start the discussion. If you have any questions, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEve)
---
That's the part you'll be surprised about.
---
And yet here you are, making comments.  Really activates the almonds.
---
Blops don’t have much more tank and are 5 times as expensive.
---
Ratting Sins incoming.
---
Meanwhile smalltime jf haulers got their station cyno cost increased by 35m unless you just cyno at a random point in space and web your freighter.  
---
Also have fun moving supers and titans solo with suicide cynos, that will be 500m ISK each jump.
---
300m+ cynos that are forced to sit around long enough to die every jump are actually retarded for *the little guy^tm*
---
It really won't though. If you think it will seriously negatively affect Goons, TEST, Frat, etc you are deluded
---
agree, and that's what should have been taken away lmao, not so sure about this nuclear purge of cyno capability for all but like 10 ships though.
---
&gt;Some fake history
---
No?
---
I mean this totally serious, no meme. But you could also be part of a social group with people you trust and have them light some of the cynos for you and build a community of interdependence in the process.
---
F. 
---
Path of Exile and Overwatch are pretty fun.
---
Blops have a shitty tank and a huge sig radius
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT! AWESOME!
---
I hope so. Still I may switch to a lach for my daily for now.
---
Thinking about it, I don't think I've ever lost an arazu, I've had the same one for a long time. It's been on dozens of BB fleets and has even been Boson'd twice. Not it's a guaranteed primary, I doubt it lasts much longer if I put it on field...
---
I love how you all think it's not the exact expected result. 
---
Trowaway cynos were cancer.
---
I'll just park my 1.2b isk hull for 10 minutes with a free warp to option, it'll be fiiiiine
---
I've long wanted CCP to once a year on a random day to have an unannounced concord free day.
---
Oh right... Yeah idk then haha
---
oh the humanity
---
No, this shit is 100% Olmeca. This is why he got elected.
---
There needs to be at least one class of nullified hulls, because as it currently stands the supers are going to just hide behind bubbled gates. 
---
T3Cs are of a similar cost level and were specifically rebalanced to have disadvantages to being nullified. Just tie it into the nullified subsystem and call it a day.
---
lmao u mad that null gonna have more than 1 active system out of every hundred now?
---
Look no further than the replies to the forum post.
---
It's almost as if CCP took some kind of life insurance policy on the game/company and is now purposely trying to kill it to collect the money
---
Yeah, every ship with a high slot being able to jizz an entire coalition onto grid was definitely content-encouraging
---
anyone have a copy/paste of the announcement?
---
can't get to the site while at work
---
How's that gate shenanigans going?
---
Olmeca how big that dick be fam
---
Then don’t keep it in your gang. It’s a cloaky ship for a reason, jump it off from the fleet and keep it cloaked until you want to escalate.
---
Imagine paying ~500m for a suicide cyno if you are a solo player moving his titan/super (also pretty sure you are not safe on NPC stations as well when moving regular caps in lowsec)
---
How are you going to get a recon on grid against a hostile supercap force?
---
but they cant be fit to cepters so you can catch them.....
---
Time to buy me a force recon...oh
---
Crunches popcorn. Lmao
---
Yeah, but you won't be able to instantly light a cyno on grid now with the ratting/mining ship. You'll have 60 secs before a jammer goes online. Not to mention bubbling to fuck up warp-ins for cyno characters will probably be a thing. 
---
Bottom line, it's going to be harder. Period
---
True but i think they do that in order to remove isk from the game and after that they gonna change the reward in nullsec that seem logic for me   
---
more risk &gt; more reward, but if they do that when people are protected by a super umbrella well you just give them free money, actually with the blackout small group or subcap ratter can't make money ratting they just get drop if they try but carrier/super/rorqual protected by their umbrella don't have this problem, now they do
---
Are you saying that I shouldn't be able to move my 50 billion isk ship using 10 2m t1 frigate cynos plus negligible fuel?
---
The T2 production chain is nightmarishly long and complicated so it'll take time for producers to adapt to the increased demand for arazus. It'll spike and come back down a bit.
---
Definitely expect bomber fleets to have a field day with any crabbing capitals now, if they even remain out after this change.
---
I also wonder if we will start seeing force recon ships being put in capital ship hangers, in order to light cynos if needed for escalations.
---
went around a moon in an interceptor once. Didn't grant me anything except the privilege to tell about it.
---
When I watched the rooks and kings documentary about them, I saw that it's about the phrase "wherever the emperor points, (man goes)" and that's where the mango slang comes from?
---
you can warp even a t1 frig to a cyno, pop the 500hp noobship, and warp off before the citadel can lock onto you, and that's assuming someone's actively gunning it
---
the jf can instantly dock and is perfectly safe, yes, the noobship is not
---
i'm guessing you don't actually own a jf
---
They need hit enough sales to get the bonus for the deal they made with PA. This change makes people buy extractors.
---
&gt; GBots handle missions all the time. He distribution HS lvl 4 LS Faction Warfare lvl 4.
---
Make them security only and L3 and above require 2 to 3 jumps. Let the bots try managing having to jump into a gatecamp.
---
Caps can't end up in the sun from jumping, only ships that got bridged in can have that happen.
---
Lighting a cyno untethers you. Jumping a JF around is 100% safe for the JF but the cyno ships die whenever someone bothers to kill it.
---
Yeah you could man the citadel and defend your cyno, but that's +effort +toon use +awareness. That's just not worth it for 1mil rookie ships. Might see an uptick for bombers but even those I don't see a great many people actively defend, especially since the covert cyno only lasts 60 seconds to begin with.
---
Kinda have to went you want to light a cyno for a fleet, eh ?
---
hahahahahahaahah
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHHAA
---
Yeah fuck them for having me train 2 whole weeks for a cheap frig cyno instead of 8 minutes, those meanies!
---
Good change overall. There are way smarter ways to go about cynoes, but they cost way devtime.
---
I guess, though not in low sec anyway. I guess you could have decloak camps up in null.
---
This is like finding out there's a civilization of sewer-people living off your scraps.
---
And former nullbear/bloc member.
---
That's cute.  You're obviously very smart.
---
I have very mixed feelings about this, like the blackout this is gonna cut both ways for sure.
---
Hopefully this properly illuminates what i feel is cap ships biggest problem atm, their complete lack of mobility. They needed OP cynos to teleport around because they travel at around the same speeds as citadels via conventional methods. The other thing i'd like to point out is that now 100% of cyno ships will have cloaks and are incredibly fucking hard to catch. Its a very mixed bag, i just cant tell if its a positive change or not.
---
Ways to get money out of the game have to be benefitial to be used. Noone is going to just piss isk away. And if you introduce it into an highly imbalanced economy all it will do is hand more benefits to the people with the most money. And again, the numbers clearly say where that is. It would be like Rorqs all over again. "They will be balanced due to their costs..."
---
Forcing cynos to be throwaway by painting them on the overview for 5 minutes is also fairly cancer. I don't mind if they die sometimes, but losing 300 - 500m every jump is even more cancer.
---
Oh no... I don't like the space croissant
---
feedability
---
yea which is why i said you would use ceptors to give recons warp ins, it will be harder but overall i dont think it will be a positive change for the game
---
Isn't that what this says, you can't fit a cyno on any ship except  Force Recon Ships and Black Ops Battleships?
---
I don't see capital on that list.
---
You mean teleporting capital ships across the galaxy now requires more than 1m isk on field. Won't somebody please think of the children.
---
If I can afford a Titan as a solo player, I'm going to guess I can afford a (less than 500M recon) cyno.  If I can't, I'm an idiot and deserve to lose the titan.
---
Ok, does your corp or alliance have a vetted cyno team?
---
I see cyno V is a 20+ day train, that plus racial cruiser V is a lot to train in a month.
---
Is the problem that your alts are used to being able to use disposable ships and just clone jump where they need to be, and now they need to be in T2 cruisers?
---
It's honestly fucking annoying hearing Goons cry over any little update. Just unsub already.
---
FW low-sec is happy with this outcome, if it means hotdrop-o'clock happens less often.
---
You don't need to. Gate over from the next system and do it the slow way, like capitals always should have. 
---
Unless you're afraid of taking a fight where.not everything is in your favour that is.
---
YES!! Finally a cyno change! While this is really aggressive i love that CCP are changing cynos and sticking to their talk about chaos era
---
Prospect is also an option. (and should be cheaper)
---
I am all for making it so caps don't have cynos because makes hunting a lot more interesting however this is gonna hurt logistic pilots massively. They are already treated like trash for the most part and now the game is gonna bend them over. Just remove cynos from caps/supers/titans and rorqs first and tweak from there.
---
It can get pricey.
---
Costs me around 200-300m to fix my sec status.
---
well they will be on stations or citadels, so pretty easy to camp, or are you suggesting that people will cyno in safe spots in lowsec with their JFs :pog:
---
The original short bus squad and then now its kronos. Cuz they the best bois in the world with the longest girthiest PPs
---
 * Krabbing supers/titans in nullsec will just hide behind bubble camps to counter active hunting.
---
well yes it will survive because you're cynoing in capitals i'm assuming a fax since you are saving something which means you can just use capital size reps on the in cyno...  
---
and like he said smaller groups arent cynoing capitals in anyway.
---
Theres worse looking ships out there. At least you're not a thorax.
---
I'll still never understand why blops BS don't get better resist profiles
---
sig radius doesn't even matter when you're true 0m/s
---
Now imagine the escalation when server is shitting itself :D
---
There is no change to the cloaky ships here, they could cyno before.
---
Maybe you should not move a titan/super as a solo player? Maybe you should use the help of your corp/alliance.
---
mhm give us the gambling back but this time ccp managed
---
It is. This is another poorly thought out change if the goal is to help small groups and hurt large.
---
1. Which group can absorb a potential 500m hit every time a cyno is needed? A large rich one or a smaller poorer one?
---
2. Which fleet can better protect a cyno ship and will have more cyno ships available in fleet, a large fleet or a small one?
---
3. Which group is going to be able to have a cyno pilot in every system either logged in already or logged off ready to log in to warp to any tacked capital and light a cyno, the small group or the large one?
---
Which group will have more cyno alts available? Which will be better at the logistics of setting up cynos when needed?
---
Cyno restrictions were overdue, but this implementation is terrible. Another too far swing of the pendulum.
---
Mate they’re sold out if not marked up to 600m+
---
Smaller ships, at least frigates also mean really fast fights which is actually bad for a new pilot. No time to correct mistakes or even know you've made one until you're dead.
---
I need to know whoever thought about this is drinking. To avoid it. Forever.
---
So people will now have eyes on every single station and/or citadel?
---
its bad news and nice news..
---
the nice news is the jf's can jump to a covert cyno whit 2 webs (fleet warp to a insta dock bm and web the jf before ppl have time to combat probe the cyno down
---
Dude check my killboard, I'm not in this game to gank, I like roaming and fleet fights. Seal clubbing is fine but cloaky ships and cynos are too strong. I'd like to just get a fight that doesnt escalate to me having to drop my super from time to time.
---
Arazu's already tripled in price in Jita since this was announced.
---
check jita retard everyone is mass buying force recons
---
Frigates can be tough for newbros. Sure they are cheap but the fights are so fast you rarely have time to correct a mistake or even notice them.
---
No you don't.  BBTB2 has spoken and you have no questions.  It. Is. Decided.
---
good old days are gone fyi
---
HAHAHA  i guess at the end only  CCP staff will be the onlyones playing this game.
---
Theyr numbers with the blackout went down alot and with this omg hahaha  even final fantasy XI online that is older than eve has more people right now xD
---
Hype. Woop woop
---
It has a significant negative impact on a variety of gameplay.  It's lopsided in favor of hunters - as much as the existing capital meta is now, so it represents a pendulum swing in the opposite direction instead of a moderate change to try to bring things into balance.
---
Limiting cynos to two highly specialized classes of ships is going to cause a run on the injector market as well, so I can see this as a bit of a cynical cash grab, too.  Yes, most players with supers already have cyno alts (multiple ones), but those characters are rarely skilled past interceptors and cyno 5.  Now you're going to have to invest significantly in all those characters to be able to do something even close to what you could do before. 
---
I think this will kill a lot of major capital battles, because the ability to get fleets on grid is substantial diminished and it jacks up the importance of cyno inhibs. 
---
Not being able to move cynos around quickly and relatively safely will have a major impact on move fleets and regular, non-jump freighter logistics. 
---
I have supported less drastic changes in the past to try to reduce the benefit of a supercap umbrella, and make capitals easier to kill.  This, if anything, completely blows up the capital meta and is going to make things like the casual dread bomb or capital escalation impossible.  You're going to see a lot less super vs. super fights, which is shocking since that's been largely dead for the last year anyway.  That means more super proliferation, too. 
---
So, overall, I think this is way too much. I could see cutting off cynos for all subcaps except blops and force recon - I think that would still probably be a bit too much - but cutting them from caps too is just too much.
---
Are you in horde or a small gang ?
---
Treat em like a cloaky dictor. Cloak up where you want to engage and wait. 
---
Watch your fleet die if you don't get to light and cloaky moonwalk away lmao
---
I don't think you understand how the whole "supply" part of supt and demand works.
---
They honestly should reduce cycle time on all ships with this change. Actually, cycle time should have been reduced 10 years ago, the 10 minutes serve absolutely no purpose.
---
Should be combat recons but otherwise cool change.
---
Unsubbed before all this Chaos Age stuff was revealed, best decision i  made all year.
---
Rorqs, carriers, bait ratting domis, supers.....sure people will bait with cloaked recons but it’ll still cause lots of dead things
---
I do not own a JF, I operate exclusively out of jspace.
---
The cyno ship being vulnerable sounds like it being in a high resists cruiser will be a improvement.
---
You could just.. not light a cyno unless you really need to.
---
most small/med groups don't drop caps on literally everything. So this arguement is from the perspective that all caps are equal. Which is not the case; since a large entity can drop as many caps as they have members. a small group cannot do that. So, this is not a disadvantage to smaller groups.
---
Also ignoring the fact that caps and rorqs now cannot cyno in yet more of their own kind.
---
I was being slightly sarcastic but my point is valid, I imagine alpha will come in to play!
---
Your "metric" is nothing other than "waaah I'll quit my 10 accounts, don't you see how important I am!!!!!".
---
No one cares.
---
You think every ratting cap and rorqual is going to have a recon alt sitting there cloaked all day?
---
I have sinned against his holyness and must now pay the price.
---
*Commits Sudoku*
---
Only if the thing shooting you is also true 0m/s
---
You think blops need to be stronger?...
---
The purpose is to slow down people solo moving caps around so you pay CCP for 5 cyno alt accounts
---
You can easily alpha a recon off the field with even a small gang.
---
Yeah just moved both alts to start cyno 5, luckily only 17 days. Then can hopefully get in a prospect pretty quickly. Cov ops cyno. I mean it works, i can find solutions. It is a pain in the ass though.   
---
I feel more sorry for those who don't have as many accounts or other shit though.
---
30 minutes behind my comment, yea sounds about right. Rip arazu.
---
Hang on tight friend.
---
I have 6. Luckily I trained all my cyno alts into stealth bombers for travel anyway. \o\
---
Hey Olmeca, im normally on your side with stuff, but this right here is incorrect
---
&gt;Capital vs. Capital escalations will get interesting but not necessarily positively. You'll need a recon for each escalation, and have something like 5-10 seconds windpw to jump your fleet. Imagine stranded capitals all over the place, some spawning at the sun. FCs as a result might be even more averse from jumping capitals and starting fights.
---
Ships with jump drives go to where the cyno is/was. Only ships that are BRIDGED go to the sun if the cyno dies.
---
Fuck yes. Tired as shit of risk free frigates dropping me.
---
It takes 7 minutes to warp a cyno alt from the citadel to the belt?
---
SPOILER: We regularly cyno at 100km +
---
ships with jump drives don't sun bounce when the cyno dies.  only ships being bridged in can sun bounce.
---
&gt;well yes it will survive because you're cynoing in capitals i'm assuming a fax since you are saving something which means you can just use capital size reps on the in cyno...
---
Why would any part of what I just said lead you to believe I am interested in saving anything?
---
&gt;like he said smaller groups arent cynoing capitals in anyway.
---
I don't even know how to respond to this statement but it's possibly the dumbest one in this thread. I will speak from anecdotal evidence but zkill also has plenty of other groups to refute you with, I am in an alliance with 600 characters and almost all the pvp we have done for the last 3 years has focused around small-medium sized capital warfare
---
I mostly agree with you, excepted the "not appearing on overview" part. This is actual cancer.
---
The day the Slyce mining team died.
---
RIP everyone's safe cyno fleets
---
Man I can't wait till Eve leaves Early Access and gets launched with all these big changes ironed out!
---
Caillou is objectively the worst anime, but all anime is trash anyway.
---
its fine but can we get a civilian cyno for jfs? that part is fucking stupid
---
Cool, so a force recon undocks at a blue citidel, lights it’s non broadcasting covert cyno, JF jumps, they both dock and live happily ever after right?
---
&gt; Do you think requiring JF pilots to have organized move ops with on-grid defense &amp; logistics fleets will make JF freight cheaper? 
---
Why should it be cheap?
---
And CCP's imminent cyno changes are somehow better?
---
BURN THEM ALL
---
Just use the gates, with a faster ship. No need for capitals
---
Solid strategy CCP.   
---
Launch one of the most controversial changes to date 14 days before an amazingly huge and popular MMO (hugely popular even with EVE's playerbase) (re)launches.   
---
That will 100% bring more people in the game.
---
Cant wait to see this sub once CCP kicks in some other changes.
---
Now just nerf the rorq multiboxing and we're Halal.
---
Or maybe \*shocked gasp\* it's time to stop being a disgusting carebear 24/7 and undock for pvp?
---
Hey, remember when the Phoebe changes went live and all the cap pilots were saying that it was the end of the world but then there was a huge amount of dynamic change with smaller groups establishing themselves and it finally culminated in the fall of the CFC and really it was just 2.5 years of pure amazingness?
---
I remember.
---
I totally haven’t, what happens in those systems?
---
I want to go one further.
---
While hitting the supercap umbrella was obviously their intention, this also has serious implications for major null fights.  Previously you could just slam a cyno on a FAX or a carrier or something and keep bringing in reinforcements.  Now its in a vulnerable subcap that can be blapped.  Could have a nice little back and forth on that one. Intriguing.
---
Please elaborate Jay, what changes would be positive for the game? What change can be made that you do not find to simply be a buff to goons?
---
they are meant to be hit hard and run, not stick around and fight.
---
The one or two guys that produce mobile cyno inhibs are probably having a good time right now. Now you'll either be keeping a cloaked recon on grid for mining that has to light within a minute of the inhib dropping or you're not getting a cyno within inhib range. Only counter would probably be enough rorquals to to blap an inhib.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenniv%C3%ADn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenniv%C3%ADn)
---
No, this is CCP finally listening to years of feedback on broken cyno mechanics.
---
I'm waiting for the wormhole chaos change, I'd imagine this reddid going down at that point.
---
They aren't changing cover cynos, you will still see nullified cyno t3cs..
---
I've never FCd a huge capital fleet, and that stuff is more or less what I heard from them about this change and I agreed. If your info is correct, then there is at least one less change they should worry about.
---
this is clearly 4D chess. if lots of people stop playing cause of this then that gives the devs time to play in that MMO as well if no one is around to play eve
---
Dude, pretty sure it's from Fortnite.
---
Unless they use dscan all the time now like they should in the blackout. Plus freighters are huge so the scan doen easy and they take forever to align. I would still do it on the structure.
---
Wait until you hear all the responses about how this "only hurts the little guy"
---
Yeah right. My group almost always used throw away frig cynos with no real need for EHP. We'll just switch to recons for cap cynos and covert frigs for blops cynos.
---
lol have you thought about fitting tank?
---
Sure, arazu will die to a 50+ ferox gang pretty quickly, but that sure as hell isn't a "small gang".
---
Unless you're a moron and dropping an arazu cyno on 15 nados?
---
Doesn’t covert recon get a buff to cycle time already? Or is that just to covert cyno
---
With your identity so widely known in these circles can you really risk posting such a career threatening statement? 
---
Who can trust a weeb in a professional setting?
---
err... big groups have cyno beacons in every system
---
Never said it wasn't because they are retarded, but it's not because something is bad that others things aren't.
---
Capitals now require some thinking before being used, and it's more dangerous to rat in a carrier or super, and rorquals are now more esposed. Capitals also can't be dropped willy nilly since their use is now heavily telegraphed by the ships that can light a cyno.
---
Mittins; that CCP rise boomed me, he boomed me!
---
YESSS!!!!
---
Ну, чем больше соло килов, тем больше ты круче :)
---
This made my CCP Rise.
---
I get that. I feel CCP has been trying to reduce the large capital battles in favor for subcap fights which I think is a good thing. It seems most big fights turn into who can drop the most caps which isnt very interesting in most cases. Now I think well see more people flying large sub cap fleets with some capitals thrown in.
---
Also I’m not sure it will limit capital fights too much because its very possible to either light the cyno off grid and warp capitals in, or light the cyno out of system and gate caps in. Currently it is far to easy to use the most powerful ships in the game and I really think this is a step in the right direction.
---
 There are certainly other changes that need to be made to even everything out like you said,  but right now I think were in a place where it needs to be easier to hunt than it is to make isk. You look at large alliances with these huge super/titan fleets and the amount of isk that goes into making them is ridiculous. These changes probably should’ve been done years ago to prevent us from ever getting to this point
---
Yes and no. They can move them the same, also cyno beacon structures, but they can’t project as easily by using something like a fax cyno in a fight, it’s at best a slaved(amuleted) redeemer that a subcap group can still take down
---
yes cause only carebears have capitals no one else. they are never used in pvp ever
---
Don’t corps and alliances vet people to light cynos for folk? It seems weird that everyone using a JF needs a fleet of alts to use it. I thought that was what the cyno becons were for, so people could jump to a defended position.
---
I'll offer another suggestion, make sort by distance show things with unknown distance at the bottom instead of at the top.
---
Oh my
---
It gets a 50% bonus, which still is 5 minutes of sitting exposed, plenty of time for someone to just stumble upon (or find it through the map) your 300m+ cyno and kill it unless you're travelling through the deadest regions in the game.
---
Keep crying.
---
On that last point, maybe but only if those covop pilots are stupid. For the most part, I imagine they're going to be lit on citadels or deep safes. Even on citadels, it's a 1 min cyno that you can't see off grid, so unless you are looking and get lucky, it'll be hard. 
---
I'm sure people will screw up, but overall, I see it as a big buff for JF safety at the cost of cyno alts being a lot more expensive to train.
---
Recons are a lot easier to kill than a rorq though
---
Interesting and surprising changes. I'm excited to try it out!
---
I know they probably didn't think at all, but perhaps the line of reasoning was to somewhat force you to cyno your caps in off grid so you actually have to warp in to the fight?
---
This would set up opportunities to disrupt the field, since you can bubble and stuff during the escalations.
---
The death of capital gameplay. Its fast approaching.
---
If this some kind of ploy to try and recruit more people into Brave, gotta say I approve of this method.
---
Weebs are degenerates.
---
&gt; they insta kill your recons before the bulk of your fleet loads,
---
1) thats the fucking point.
---
2) don't be a retard, spam the carriers with bubbles and light the cyno off grid and warp your ships in.
---
3) if you're dropping on grid, the risk of only getting half the fleet in is part of the balance.
---
Да я F2 нажал, не знаю че не деклокнулся)
---
Flair
---
Everyone from there is inactive now
---
A beacon isn't a defended position though, they are out of general range of weapons, and outside tether. With  blackout you always would assume there is something cloaked camping them. As such it is suicide to jump a slow moving squishy ship in. Obvs can mitigate it a bit if you have a web alt there but still very dangerous. A super could volley you and warp before a JF could actually warp normally.
---
No specific cyno for JFs is honestly stupid as fuck but ok
---
super pilot w recon alt in system ready to go?
---
They did!
---
I don't think they pay any attention to the CSM at all tbh.
---
And a larger sig.
---
Should see the new scams. Lachesis being sold as arazu
---
not when it's stuck for 10 minutes with no logi or other means of fighting back
---
I can agree with this tbh
---
Capital ships need a cynosural field beacon to navigate with their interstellar jump drives. Up to now, this could be generated by the Cynosural Field Generator I module, which could be fitted to any ship (though not all ships have enough cargo bay to hold enough fuel to run the module). The module requires only Cynosural Field Theory I to make it work. So a "cyno alt" could be a low-skilled character in a very cheap ship. Even noobships would work, and some use-cases called for the cyno ship to self-destruct shortly after lighting the beacon.
---
With this change, the module will only fit on some T2 ships that have much higher skill requirements just to sit in, and cost enough that the self-destructing cyno is likely to be a thing of the past.
---
Snuff rejoining Imperium in 3..2...
---
after the September update... would not hurt.
---
calls me a retard, suggests warping in a super fleet
---
The point is that this is a nerf to active hunting of supers in nullsec, where the krabs can hide behind bubbled gates. Neither cyno hull is nullified. 
---
It won't entirely kill hunting supers but it will encourage cloaky camping with recons instead of actively hunting, which I think is a huge bummer.
---
You need a bridge and a venture.
---
I mean, working on it. But one rule in Horde that i am rocking is being very cautious about asking randoms for cynos for anything bigger than a carrier. As is i just started my alts training for cov ops cynos so ill have those done in plenty of time.
---
&gt;So this arguement is from the perspective that all caps are equal. Which is not the case; since a large entity can drop as many caps as they have members. a small group cannot do that. So, this is not a disadvantage to smaller groups.
---
you contradict yourself here. And you look at this as purely a numbers game. But in my small group I have advantages, ie pilot skill, surprise and speed. And if I have balls, I can make aggressive plays with ships of any size to take advantage of these. These changes significantly reduce (and in many cases remove) 2 of my advantages, as it's much slower to properly position a recon, and whether or not I have one is a dead tell as to whether or not I am capable of escalation, completely removing any element of surprise I may have been able to achieve
---
But how hard of a cyno is it? I guess you get t2 resists with battleships sized tank but that’s still much more killable than fax/rorq cyno s
---
i think covops should be allowed to use cyno as well.
---
Not to mention the fact that having a blackops bs/recon doing it, means you can "chain jump".  Drop a cov cyno, bridge in blackops/recons, then light a regular cyno, drop dreads.
---
But there is other stuff you can do, the null blocks have so many people, are all ya ratting solo all the time? Why don’t you fleet up and go through anoms quickly?
---
Itll be a pain in the ass, but itll be a deterrent to carrier/super ratting, a thing that I think should not be a thing
---
If it's still raging after 4 hours call a doctor lol
---
&gt; because as it currently stands krabbing supers are going to just hide behind bubbled gates and be safer than they are now.
---
*laughs in wormhole*
---
2 weeks lmao, are you an idiot?
---
Why is renting uniquely bad? Isnt clicking paps and paying taxes the same thing? The issue is too much safety in the blob (or renting from it) and too little outside of it.
---
Buff dread DPS to 18-22k
---
Revert carriers back to using drones and capital remote reps 
---
Remove FAX completely
---
Make the rorqual a boosting platform again
---
Limit the number of combat anoms in systems (like how it was before they added more)
---
i can probably write a massive list but :effort:
---
Warping capitals is a good way to feed in my experience, anyway I'm not against changes that make null more dangerous, just think this one is a shot in the dark.
---
Large groups will just field recons or other ships, and setup beacons in every system. Not overly hard to light a cyno out of range of hostiles, jump ships in and warp. Heck do it with a webbing huginn and web everything into warp :D
---
Because they still want to fit cynos to corvettes
---
So combat is going to be harder now? Good. The smart will figure it out and get good at it but now smaller groups have a defence against capital escalation.
---
The amount of targets in space will only decrease as a result of this. Not sure how this is a buff to any type of whaling activity if all your targets just aren't gonna be there. This is just a hardcore nerf to capital pve.
---
which mmo
---
riotrick and slyce are currently on suicide watch
---
Yes sweetie I shot cagali just to stay relevant in your eyes
---
Why is is stuck for so long? Cycle time on covert cyno is 1min, and it doesn’t broadcast your location...
---
the gila nerf reduced drone hp which isn't even a problem for ratting if you 100mn orbit sites as the rats just shoot you instead
---
should've clarified, ONLY make capitals unable to fit cynos and leave subcapitals unaffected
---
I wonder how many have been bio-massed in the past hour...
---
NoFun Coalition can eat my ass
---
Beacuse the salty r/eve mods deleted it.
---
Using caps should not be a casual activity.....
---
Then don't ask randoms, make friends that you can put faith in. Or leave and find a tighter community where dependability is the base assumption rather than the exception to the rule.
---
Yeah, right. look at this thread already. 
---
What game have you been playing?
---
That would make sense if they put out significantly more DPS than their t1 counterparts but they really don't output that much unless full dps shield fit and they still get blown out by most of the faction battleships. I guess it's fair that they're not monsters given jump capability though.
---
That's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard lol
---
There needs to be room in the game for both large capital battles and large subcap fights without capitals ruining the fun.  If you light the cyno off grid and warp caps in, you are pretty much guaranteeing whoever is defending will be able to control the grid - soon as you see a cyno, you're dropping bubbles to catch the fleet that's coming in and you can stop them landing or land them perfectly at range to whatever you've got
---
I've never been a fan of the drop titans on interceptor gang thing, but this has a much larger impact than just ending that.
---
Jesus Christ, I thought my ideas were pure garbage.
---
I can fly nearly every combat subcap in the game and the rest suck.
---
What are you going to hunt olmeca myrms. Thats the only thing thats going to be in space.
---
The poor newbie in a ratting carrier will be forced to have a friend he trusts and the ability to SRP a dead Arazu.
---
At first sight this is so smart, but then after a few neurons kick in and few seconds later, it is more than dumb.
---
Didn't the Imperium put him on their ballot? :thinking:
---
I actually think it'll have the opposite effect - since you won't be able to just sneak a nullfiied interceptor, or a small wulfpack of bombers or AFs into someone's farming grounds and then hotdrop them, I think this will actually make people's farming grounds *safer* than before.  
---
Remember, everyone already has full cyno generators all over their staging / ratting / mining grounds.  If there are only 8 ships in all of eve that can now light a cyno, instead of basically anything, and the smallest of them is cruiser sized, then it's going to be harder to get cynos into position to hot-drop and go whaling.
---
And no one is going to use Blops battleships to light cynos and bridge in a hotdrop when the cost of losing the blops could easily exceed the cost of the carrier that you're attempting to gank.
---
it is still expensive to replace that SP, even with SP as tradable item
---
It wont hurt smaller groups, it will help them. You now have a better defence against capital escalation because you know what ships are likely to have a cyno and you can take actions to prevent it or shut it down quickly depending on the situation.
---
It's not production, it's raw materials. The new moongoo system provides far, far fewer materials than the old, and the last major stockpiles of pre-Lifeblood moongoo are gone. I personally reacted the last tag ends of Technetium from OTEC myself this year, for instance. Combo this with the decrease in viability of rorquals (and in turn, mining in general,) and you're going to see a sustained rise in price over time.
---
As a small postscript, the primary T2 producers of New Eden (all of which are in  Goonswarm Federation and Tactical Narcotics Team, natch) are going to make out like fucking *bandits.*
---
the idea is sound... the choice of ships is bad though
---
WTB deep safes everywhere in null sec.
---
Small groups hunt and punish the gluttony of the larger groups, which will be severely restricted now, it's wormholes or bust for them.
---
For Imperium nothing will change tbh., now the cyno alts need to be in recons, so what.
---
Nope. It was talked about but never happened.
---
Though if you have heavy tidi it sometimes takes a bit for the cyno to appear for everyone that wants to jump to it.
---
Many, many posts made by goon-badged people here lead me to disagree.
---
That's not even the worst of it. I can just jump a triage. There are worse problems than that:
---
Probing cyno hics? Out the window
---
Tackle rorquals? Bye bye
---
Hyper supers? Lmao see ya
---
JF ganking on stations? HAHAHAHA no
---
Baiting risk averse retards? Nope
---
I'm very very much in favor of these changes, but I agree with you whole heartedly.
---
I fully expect to read about a major nullsec PvE rework in the next few weeks planned for the same time as this change.
---
the Risk/Reward currently is unbalanced, and even I can admit that.
---
Standing logistics defense fleet? You can’t ask if a beacon is defended on comms? I thought some of the null systems where busy.
---
Your corp or alliance can get a fleet out to cover the beacon for 15-20 min and the top of the hours.
---
Would like more options then two classes, but not combat recon. This are dscan immune.
---
100% agree. What will, in the long term, get Eve to recruit and retain players is a balance where more playstyles are viable because then Eve will appeal to more people. No playstyle should be dominant, and if we lived in a world where no one could undock a Rorqual or super for fear of rampant hunting gangs I'd be all in favor of balance against that too.
---
Oh, I'm not a weeb.  I just like funny emotes.
---
I'd like to see carebears leave nullsec... but I kind of want to see the salt too. I doubt they'll leave quietly though - they're carebears! They're known for whining.
---
Large group  
---
Have cov ops cyno's in every constellation and bridge through a recon to light a regular cyno                          
---
Small group                      
---
Troll tackle, wait for the recon alpha it and moonwalk
---
RIP cyno ceptor, long may your replacements eat shit to bubbles.
---
BATTLESHIP ROAMING IS ALIVE AGAIN BOYS
---
I think he's saying to remove the ability to fit cynos to capitals but leave it for subcapitals.
---
Can you hear the squeee-ing on FW discords from where you are?
---
Your maths is way off there chief.
---
Look at any of the Large bloc alliances. Average fleet size from 100 on a bad form up to multiple full 256 man fleets on a good.  You're saying a group like that, who can afford Cap, Super cap and Fighter SRP, who have multiple alts already available to switch to these ships, who have the industrial backbone to manufacture these ships at cost and who are the main manufacturers of these ship types for Low and High sec are going to feel it more than a small group who can barely fill a fleet, might not be able to afford basic srp nevermind whatever the cost the ships will finally level out at (Recons have quadrupled in cost in Jita since the announcement.) Nevermind loosing that high skill char from your DPS/tackle pool to becoming a straight suicide char. (You now have a REALLY expensive loss mail everytime a cyno is lit even if the hull a t1 cyno and just enough LO to light once is all thats on the ship thats still 400Mill Plus.)
---
All this does is make cyno's expensive and prohibitive unless you already have a solid Indy, Cap fleet and an SRP program with VERY DEEP pockets. Which only the larger alliances can do. 
---
This means only the Large coalitions can use caps.
---
So the only winners here, again, will be the large Coalitions and botters who can RMT the cost away.
---
Which is fine for carriers and whatnot but will reduce the number of supers -- and especially titans -- that get ganked. The more HP the target has the more likely it will survive getting dropped by the ships capable of taking a covert cyno.
---
Of course you can just bring more, but at that point you attract attention and the targets get a red light ping to dock up.
---
Or any ship for that matter.
---
Make space big again
---
 Invulnerable cyno is even dumber...  
---
Sorry.
---
Getting chased out of an abyssal hole by trigs would be funny, and fit pretty well with the recent trailer.
---
EVE players really do go all out to whine about things changing in their space game when they often whine about things not changing.
---
Yeahh youre right. Hopefully we’ll see a buff tho Blops or something so they have a bit more staying power. 
---
To be quite honest im just really tired of getting supers dropped on my cruiser gangs lol. I dont care if we get shit on by a bunch of subcaps but as soon as the caps drop the shit gets boring.
---
Looks like all my JF route Cynos need to be switched from noob ships and ceptors to stealth bombers.  Not that big of a deal.
---
NaCl?
---
Wow! Using capitals will require actual planning instead of warping a ceptor to wherever the hell and pushing the cyno button. 
---
Can’t wait to unsubscribe 50 accounts and move to highsec
---
Yeah but then it's a cakewalk alt, this is actually a barrier to entry.
---
pretty sure there are more people sporting wrong flair than right one
---
Stop posting
---
OMG CCP YES
---
actually giving marauders something like a cyno or a cyno jammer would be interesting.....they'd sitll be suicide bait though
---
Lowsec supers unironically even more ungankable now since you have to micromanage two oneshottable accounts while hunting
---
The entire goal of this is to require more subbed accounts with higher SP which means more money for CCP... yeah more autism in the game.
---
I have yet to see a t3c have a problem living long enough to get a dread bomb or 100 bombers onto a titan. Have you?
---
Gunna guess the WoW Classic relaunch I keep hearing about from many pro gamer across genres.
---
we literally already have a contingency plan you shitlord, it's everyone else you gotta start thinking about for fucks sake
---
You guys are 100% missing the point of the post, which I will add to the TL;DR at the top.
---
Swinging the nerfbat around disenfranchises existing players who like a playstyle, whereas buffing counterplay keeps everyone engaged.
---
This is fundamentally stupid because it doesn't add anything interesting to the game. It's bad game design.
---
Surely there are more interesting ways to limit the power of  cynos rather than having to kill the ship or limit the number of ships to 8 hills e.g.:
---
A new type of ECM that disrupts a cyno to prevent jumping to it.
---
A new HAC type disruption field module that prevents lighting of cynos within its radius.
---
Changing the impact of lighting cynos on certain hulls e.g. reduce resistances if a cyno is lit outside a subset of ships.
---
A module that impacts the jump in location to a cyno (throws you in another system in constellation, another location in system).
---
I though of these while typing this - a very knee jerk change.
---
Force Recons aren't nearly as tankless as you might think.  A t2 fit cyno falcon hits 120k ehp with overheat.
---
Mangos were considered the fruit of the working class during the cultural revolution, mostly because Mao regifted a box of mangos to some revolutionaries after he dissolved the red guards. They actually had a little cult around it, since mangos at the time were unknown in china, with the mangos he gave persevered in formaldehyde like holy relics. 
---

---
I feel your pain.  On the other hand, we have had a ton of fun "whaling" where all we wanted to do was bait out the response fleet, and that's going to be much harder to do.
---
so stop fucking crying all the time
---
Skulls for the Skull Throne!
---
It's healthy for the game if 70% of people stopped capital ratting.
---
That's a self-fulfilling prophecy though. If you nerf a playstyle over and over, it will become more niche and more vocal about the challenges they face. If CCP nerfed null to the point where holding sov wasnt worth it any more, sov null would be a niche playstyle, and those who enjoy it would complain the loudest (hell they whine enough and cry back to hs about blackout which is minor compared to what's happened to other playstyles).
---
He's been an inspiring leader and great fc and faced unfavorable odds (feeding regularly, we even self destructed once our machariel fleet when we were trapped and surrounded by enemy fleets and bubbles) and because I felt and shared his passion for the alliance and not taking the easy way out.
---
CSM is a bucket full of holes. I wouldn't be surprised if they didnt inform the CSM. Otherwise we would of seen those prices jump far sooner and alliances start super stockpiling them.
---
Facts. Would open up null for smaller groups if you couldnt move your entire cap fleet to defend sov in 10 minutes. Next they need to shit on these jump gates. Moving ships long distances should be hard. Im cool with moving your toons around space fast but not god tier capitals at the blink of an eye
---
Well blops have the option to jump to a cyno. So if the meta is covert cyno alts, then you can cut a lot of bullshit by just jumping the blops to light the cyno
---
that's because you, like the other idiots supporting this dumb shit, can't see one foot down the road in front of you
---
Add in FAX support dropped which used to be an endless amount of cynos.
---
My problem is that I did interceptors to avoid bubbles. Yay more training to continue to play the game the same way as before.
---
Fisher but every time you catch a fish a giant megalodon jumps out the water and eats your dick.
---
&gt;I can fly
---
Good to hear. Let me know if you forgot where the "make active ship" button is. I know you haven't left that Hel in awhile....
---
So goons can alpha supers off field easier.
---
So goons don't even need separate fax and carrier pilots to save crabs.
---
Goons can just have an extra full fleet of T2 logi. 
---
To supplement the 10 covetor alts that every person will get. 
---
Goons will just spread out and plant more keepstars with more regional umbrellas.
---
My point being Jay that to a group of the size and economic strength of goons anything can be twisted into being a buff. But when you go on with this line ad-naseum people start to not care what you're saying and only see the kool aid. This is a hit to the delve playstyle; it might be small and there might be ways around it but your strategy just got more moving pieces. If you could just own up to that fact a little wouldn't it be worth your word having some credibility outside your own group?
---
holy fuck are you this ignorant?
---
That's 2 session timers. As soon as you get into system with the T3C the target is going to start pulling fighters and warping out. They'd have to be complete shit to not escape with a 20+ second head start.
---
Its a direct slap to the supercap umbrella.
---
Super/carrier/rorq farming with a cyno. gets tackled and lights it instantly. Immediate support.
---
Yes. The /r/eve crowd (many of who have quit) love it, because they apparently don't pay attention to how this will affect the big blobs and smaller groups as well (they are too focused on grr goons to see that changes like this will hurt others MORE than goons).
---
Isolated capitals need a subcap support fleet what?!
---
the only thing i said that if you know hoe to manage transversal then 280s are better
---
Wait let me get the pop corn out of the microwave.
---
frigates, lots and lots of small gang frigates.
---
Not much training if you already have racial frigate V though.
---
Hahahahahahha. Best r/eve in a bit.
---
So use one of those.
---
&gt; Moving supers and titans around with suicide cynos face the same fate, unless you want to do multiple suicide recons
---
Great change, don't you think? I bet players will think twice before they sacrifice [18](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/jump/Avatar,544/1DQ1-A:R1O-GN) recons in order to move their big stuff to a different alliance. This makes it also harder to smuggle out titans in case your alliance restricts exporting.
---
Stuka Pilot boners rise up?
---
People have been complaining for fucking YEARSSSSS about nullbears dropping multiple carriers to kill even single frigates...
---
FUCKING FINALLY - nullbears have no idea how badly their cap blob tactics were killing this game.... and the pent up frustration and anger is about to come barreling out even MORE than the blackout caused.
---
About fucking time.
---
This jump from 190 to &gt;400 isn't necessarily accounted for with materials alone. Or you'd see a commensurate jump with other T2 hulls surely
---
Don't forget the cost of the slaves. (Amulets?) I think it's pretty safe to say that a pod like that is gonna die.
---
Or maybe \*shocked gasp\* you haven't got the capacity to remember what alts are?
---
idk if ironic but ppl do use em to camp lowsec stations
---
What happens to a cap that clicks jump then and then the cyno dies? Do they just stay where they were?
---
If someone wants to have enough people in space to cover every possible system you can go through on your route and dscan all of them constantly to maybe catch a JF, then more power to them I say. 
---
Between Jita and NSI- there are 42 systems that a JF can possibly go through, so at a bare minimum you'd need 42 characters to cover everything, and that's not counting the ones that are larger than a single scan can cover.
---
If someone is that autistic and also fast enough, they deserve their frag.
---
&gt;The average *new player* will go from being able to jump their shiny new ratting carrier
---
I rolled my eyes so hard after this statement that I could not continue reading and now need surgery.
---
you really think goons want the game to die huh?
---
Leaks from the secret Goonswarm anime discord after a Heron got away from a 20-strong boson blob:
---
“He got us,” Mittani said of CCP Rise's nerfs to cynos. "That f***ing Rise boomed us."
---
Mittani added, “He's so balanced,” repeating it four times.
---
Mittani then said he wanted to add Rise to the list of people he wizard-hats next fanfest.
---
Aside from a few structure shoots, they're all I fly.
---
Which is why people are saying you need cyno 5.
---
Fair. Unfortunately I haven’t been on any whaling fleets myself but it looks fun as piss. We just need a happy medium and I think CCP going hard the way of hunters first is a good idea. Bring the pvpers back and active and let the rich folk lose some isk. Would balance the game out a bit in the long run.
---
On a side note, I had a fucking faction titan dropped on me the other day and I was in a cynabal. Shits broken lol
---
Amused to see this, I’m the guy losing all the Punishers. Trying to learn pvp and as you can see by my killboard I’m losing a lot of ships in the process.
---
I stole that fit from zkill except it came with a MWD. I don’t understand how to fly it with the MWD though, either I get scrammed so the MWD doesn’t work and the other guy orbits me at 1000km/h or if I kite further out with the MWD then I can’t scram my opponent and they can warp out before I can kill them?
---
I would perhaps add some "spool up" procedure for bringing a ship back from cold-storage. So you cannot just switch and undock in 5secs
---
the point was only removing them from caps and let all subs still fit them
---
Ya fuck them for creating a ship that requires 2 accounts to use.
---
Not sure if this is a good change or not. Initially I'm excited but I think it just makes the already insular blobs even bigger and drives more people to them.
---
You have a super umbrella you say? CCP is officially smoking crack
---
Where were you when CCP make capitals into solo pwnmobiles that had perfect tracking to nearly every subcap that could appear in the blink of an eye?
---
That sure as hell disenfranchised players who enjoyed small gang content and roams and killed their playstyle. 
---
Making capitals be the best at everything didnt add anything to the game either, but nullbears just told us to adapt and HTFU. So now its your turn to adapt and HTFU.
---
And still get caught in bubbles. There's no way to engage in these fights.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
\*Sorts by controversial\*  The Salt is going to be epic in this one.
---
Then your flair also refers to your relationship with anime? Multiple uses, respect.
---
&gt; heavily telegraphed by the ships that can light a cyno
---
Only if you happen to see them on a gate or something. All of the cyno-capable ships are covops-cloak capable, except BLOPS (which have their own cloaky bonuses, and are not likely to be the default anyway).
---
MJD destroyers exist. Not every super is dying to a dread bomb. There are options aplenty but they are not as easy as warp and click one button and so people throw a tantrum.
---
Except for the free SP shit, I do not do PVE.
---
Windrunners new meta?
---
I only hear mememe its fucking null sec it should be high risk high iskies. Now they change that in that direction. And you take  the newbies as reason for mememe take your 17 acc and adapt.
---
And dont whine
---
buff marshal thx.
---
I need electronics upgrade V instead of evasive maneuvering V though. That's going to be the pain.
---
yes it will do absolutely NOTHING to rorqs in delve... I mean, bombers bar cannot volley ANYTHING that can cyno now. 
---
The result: they jump in a few caps at a time, cause noone can jump in 10+ caps in the few seconds time every time... And for each cyno, they now have to suicide at least one ship worth a few hundred millions.
---
Ohh not to mention, that every cap that jumps into a dead cyno, ends up offgrid, in the sun. Creating a perfect opportunity to catch those caps on a different grid...
---
Stop making stupid assumptions without thinking it through before you actually see the patch.
---
Don't you guys have Recons?
---
There's one near the top of the sub right now. 
---
You can also, potentially boosh incoming bombs away from your fleet and die a hero.
---
No, it already requires significant amounts of planning and execution, now it will require gimping yourself and giving free information to your enemy in addition. I can still farm provi if I need to use an Arazu to cyno, but fighting anybody with a brain in a subcap engagement while still having the potential to escalate will be far, far more difficult, and re-escalation on top of their escalation will be almost impossible.
---
It wasn't good as a comment and you somehow managed to make it even worse post.
---
It's extremely flexible...&lt;insert joke here&gt;.
---
Literally sold mine yesterday
---
Not a big fight expert but what if you just cyno 600km off or something? and then warp the fleet in a ping near the bubbles
---
This means smaller entity's can blap larger entity's cynos easier vs lighting a cyno in a fax all the time
---
there was an over abundance of "fish" in the sea, caused by totally nerfing pvp by the use of blobbing carriers and local as an intel tool.
---
Of course the fish population will go down due to the rebalancing of pvp vs pve - because there is an overpopulation of fish. 
---
This is why you have over production of industry - all those safely ratting rorqs are now balanced because their risk vs reward is finally on par.
---
So the fish population will be normalized again and industry will go down to the point where titans and super caps are very difficult to afford and create again.
---
This restores the balance, my friend!
---
No, and I think if goons public facing attitude were less guarded and toxic we would all stand to benefit. The game and community would be in a better place. We would care more and actually listen when goons say a change is legitimately unhealthy.
---
That's a tackling recon. Something like a rapier can easily be tanked to 100k EHP by going propless, no weapons, and PDS+DC lows. They'll just float alongside the super and light if you get in trouble.
---
I'm saying there are alternatives to just lighting the cyno on the fleet and getting half the fleet blapped.
---
Yeah obviously warping in supers is dumb, but thats not the point I was making.
---
You can't hunt that which will stay docked..... and unsubbed.....
---
i enjoy the daily morning flavour of my father's creamy shits being plopped fresh into my waiting mouth
---
be careful attributing funny quotes to ccp. stunt is still banned
---
I'm sorry, do bubbles keep your guns from working?
---
*looks at every ship with a jump drive*
---
You said? Lmao
---
Inhibs are a thi g and only take 1 minute?
---
or you know.. the fight ends after the first cyno is shot down
---
i dont think you know how the  "Demand" part works either. Force recons are REQUIRED to play the game with ANY use of captials, offensive or defensive umbrella crabbing. The price of recons will sky rocket.
---
Next up: remove regular cynos, make all cynos covert (i.e. not show up on overview). Any jump capable ship can access them.
---
The short term price for recons is obviously speculation and/or stockpiling, sure. The increased demand for recons will drag up all things T2 by dint of consuming more raw materials. This kind of sea change occurs slowly.
---
Warping a recon in takes less
---
Yep. Their primary strength is the ability to jump in ontop of you in brawling range. My Typhoon got bubbled and kited to death 5 gates ago, while my Panther can land ontop of your head, web you down, and go to work.
---
True, but people are already out hunting systems using dscan because of the blackout. The risk of them being in the system hunting already is too high for a 10 billion isk ship.
---
Also people tend to use the same small number of systems to jump yo for fuel efficiency. I mean you can go to more systems than you need in order to try and avoid hunters but you have to pay more in fuel. Also you need to wait out your red timer without a cloak.
---
I'm still sticking to structures and taking the loss. JF prices will be going up.
---
FUCK. YES.
---
I came.
---
Depends on if you define the game as a PVP game or a PVE game. Considering Goons and Test are actively following in Serenity's footsteps it could absolutely be argued that the goon mission is to kill the game from a PVP perspective functionally speaking.
---
When people have like 12 rorqs, 1 more alt for a recon that you can remote rep with those rorqs is not a big sacrifice.
---
"High iskies" laffo. It's not anymore. Getting rid of capital ratting doesn't make "high iskies" and you're a moron
---
Which then have to bridge in the Recon, which then has to opena  cyno, which then has to get the dreads/fleet in. Unless you bubble trapped that super it will be looong gone.
---
I guess you could also allow a cyno to be fit to a fax, which doesn't rat, mine, or really do anything to bother anyone, and that would also fix the capital escalation issue.
---
But I'm sure there's some reason that wouldn't work either.
---
...yeees, that is what eve needs - less players...
---
my info is correct, so yeah one less thing for them to worry about.
---
I really don't get where any of you people think it's of any consequence for an alliance with 10s of thousands of members to just have random dudes in arazus for their cyno lighting purposes... If you are a 20 man hisec corp who roams in dragoons and kestrels into lowsec, then sure, this is a direct buff to you, congratulations. For pretty much everybody else, it simply means the more dudes you have the easier it will be to continue to helicopter dick on random people who are powerless to defend themselves against you, especially if you kill their only arazu.
---
&gt; a mandatory 1.5b+ feed to dreadbomb is a bit silly
---
Don't you get about that much back from the 1 lost dread's insurance anyway?
---
Sounds like yall need some industry folks
---
No disagreements there
---
I foresee a few capital kills in the beginning of this change.... More so from the people not keeping track of the changes / maybe some bots.
---
Then? Vast emptiness in Null.... everyone simply keeping their capitals docked.
---
So Blackout? Killed sub ratting.
---
Cyno "blackout"? Killed capital ratting / rorqs.
---
Then.... that's it..... nothing but loki / Bomber kitters roaming for "dank frags".... in the vast emptiness of null.
---
At the moment there is one 10 second session timer before dreads are on field. With this change there will be 2 session timers, and that's after the hunter has to pass through a choke point that is probably being watched. So the target gets minimum 20 seconds to respond, not including lag or warp time. That's a big buff.
---
So part of this assumes that you have the fucking thing pointed and held.
---
What a silly reply.
---
no u
---
It may lead to even more growth of the jump bridge network too.
---
That's also true, my favourite ship size for roaming around are cruisers; but you find way more targets flying frigs.
---
I guess if nothing else I wouldn't mind them getting some extra scan rez. Sucks that battleship lock times can be compared to capitals and makes drops feel a lot less smooth imo.
---
This change is significant because the vast majority of people light cynos with smaller ships,  haulers, etc.
---
This is effectively adding a 200M charge to every cyno and pushing it only into a very flimsy ship. 
---
Cynos are needed to move capital ships around eve. 
---
Bigger groups will weather this change just fine, and the people most impacted will be smaller groups and newer players. 
---
This basically makes combat cynoing in reinforcement capitals (necessary for the big capital fights that CCP markets) impossible for smaller groups, as the only ships that can mount a cyno are too weak to survive for any decent period of time, so the group that can throw the most of them into a fight will win. 
---
In short, it's a bad change that will only force people into bigger blobs out in 0.0. The "hunters" or people who try and kill people living in 0.0 think they love the change for now (makes surprising people easier and harder for them to call for help), but can't see how this will impact literally everyone else.
---
Did CCP just solve all the rorq, titans and ratting capital ship proliferation problem IN ONE GO!??
---
What this really means is bosons and hictors on every gate.
---
It would certainly be an improvement over this idea
---
Depends on corporation. Id say starting npc corps are decent enough to learn basic and decide what you actually want to do in eve. You can also create an alt in one of those so you can switch and ask your questions there.
---
Just jettison your cyno blops battleship, board it, light cyno and hop no one notices and steals your super :hmm:
---
&gt;I mean you can go to more systems than you need in order to try and avoid hunters
---
The 42 systems are all the same number of jumps. You don't need any extras. Anyway I'm not really disagreeing with you, I'm just saying there are options for people willing to try other things.
---
More people being caught is a good thing regardless.
---
Then the recon gets alpha'd off the field since the hunters know it is coming.
---
At least a moron who dont whine like cry baby
---
They can shove that idea where sun doesn’t shine
---
then try playing hunter instead
---
I agree with you completely take my upvote.
---
While I'm not against the cyno changes I do really like your suggestions, perhaps less the overview one but the cyno bubble sounds great.
---
Too much...too fast. My corp which was highly active before blackout is nearly a ghost town. Calm the fuck down with the hooch at the office boys...
---
What kind of buffer/EHP can those get up to?
---
This change is amazing except for JFs:
---
For Jump Freighters just create a new cyno type that requires Cyno Theory I and can be fitted on anything. JFs can jump to that cyno. Thus nothing changes for JF movement, just needing to buy new modules.  /u/Olmeca_Gold
---
Ok, your alts that move around the ultimate transport ship need a few level V skills, sounds right to me.
---
What I’m really surprised by in this thread is that there seems to be no corp or alliance support for moving JF. Everyone that flys one has alts to light the cynos.
---
That is really depressing, I thought there was more logistical trust in null.
---
Free information? You mean your recon decloaking and lighting the cyno? How terribly unfair. 
---
If you have at least a room temperature IQ, you should be able to get a cyno recon in place without giving it away. It’s a cloaky warping ship... 
---
It sounds like you’re basically complaining that if you try to surprise blob someone, it’ll take a little bit of actual effort and you can’t just yeet a billion caps onto the field with 0 effort or planning as soon as a fight goes south.
---
This didn't age well
---
oh no, the wow players will leave eve and go play wow?
---
a real shame.
---
/s
---
Fak your capitals. Hahahahaa
---
I've only ever paid for one when I first started playing, so I may have been wrong on the figure.   
---
The point stands though.
---
I have no problem with more people dying. I make most of my isk doing T2 production and moon mining. This is going to make me rich.
---
Seems like a really nice middle ground, doesn't it?
---
&gt;large Coalitions and botters who can RMT the cost away.
---
They will do that anyway, in any situation, until CCP effectively bans RMT. So this is not an argument against it.
---
Any group who can afford multiple capitals can afford to field, use and lose, can afford a force recon or blops.
---
It makes logistics more difficult and bigger alliances need more logistics than small ones and *that* is the reason this will hurt bigger alliances more.
---
Which is part of the experience of running a fleet, and is the point of this change.
---
How many fights in real life have been won because you stopped the enemy from getting reinforcements or logistics into a beleaguered and caught unit?
---
I like ur meme friend but for mittens to be driving around new eden he would actually have to remember how to log in xd
---
I'm perfectly aware of what alts are friend.  I'm going to have to train Cyno V on quite a few to move my JF around.  A price I'm happy to pay for the peak amount of carebear salt we are about to see.
---
I thought that CCP could not surprise me more, how wrong i got to be.
---
Talk about shaking the boat :)
---
&gt; Warping capitals is a good way to feed in my experience
---
But that's only in the previous environment of people then being able to probe/fly a frig/suicidal ship on top of them, and then insta cyno in things fitted for 0km fights.  
---
In this new context, they'd have to have a recon ready to do the probing (unbonused) &amp; suiciding.
---
Have you ever tried roaming in battleship without using bridges or flex gates? By these standards, eve is pretty huge.
---
lmao you must be in snuff
---
This is a huge buff to JF pilots. I can now light a covert cyno and jump into a system with no one even knowing I was there.
---
Bubbles keep you from getting in range, so in a way yes they do.
---
&gt; Why would a 1000 man blob care if they need to have 3 pilots switch from dps to an arazu
---
because an arazu can get stuck in gate bubbles, my friend... fuck the blob's cyno. :P
---
this change is great!
---
Ahhhh yes, because forgetting the value of a Noctis is definitely the same as putting blingy stuff on one.  
---
10/10
---
dosnt mean much from someone who obviously cant read
---
Haaaa fuck yeah
---
&gt;and the pent up frustration and anger is about to come barreling out even MORE than the blackout caused.
---
lol, just like the blackout alone was supposed to be a massive hit?
---
mango too dirty
---
You'll be the one crying when goon is murdering your shit and you can't cyno for help. Just try not to make a reddit post asking CCP to levy nerfs against goons-only afterward, huh?
---
\*removes it from the list of acceptable beverages\* Thanks kind sir.
---
Are the bubbles invulnerable now?
---
These are the people who care enough to say something. They'll keep playing. The ones saying nothing are already considering new options.
---
Hey, did you know Classic WoW is coming out soon?
---
let me say this clear      FFFFFFUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKKK YOUUUUU  CCP
---
feeling much better now
---
I'm referring to 100 bombers
---
Force recons can also do this via a bridge, which keeps the blops safe
---
I'm 100% in favor of using blops hulls but I want to be more than a blingy cyno killmail
---
A lot
---
Mentioning noob's shiny carriers staunchly highlights how disconnected from reality is your perception of a new player.
---
Thank you CCP!
---
Is there a way to unsub accounts that are already unsubbed?
---
Can someone explain what is there? 
---
Cant open the link in my work
---
&gt; or if I kite further out with the MWD then I can’t scram
---
Notice that 2nd fit has a long point, not a scram, and is using bigger guns with Scorch. He's trying to stay out of scram range using the MWD while keeping the opponent pointed at a range where Scorch will work, and he has two T2 rigs to make that range longer (probably hoping to keep out of web range as well).
---
Punisher is kind of a hard-level frigate for solo I think. It's slow and tanky so you want to brawl but lack of web makes that a problem. Probably the key to success is "pick your fights carefully."
---
You do lose a lot of ships trying to solo. I think it's easier with either a brawler that can web, like the Merlin, or a kiter that's built for purpose like a Slasher. Maybe Executioner if you're limited to Amarr/lasers.
---
It means that the system where you bought your cap/super is the system it will stay unless you join a group with enough supercap superiority to be able to move it.
---
This is of only moderate impact to carebears. This is a bigger impact on things most folks don't consider.
---
Doesn't change the fact people get into whatever system they want whenever. Nothing is airtight. There is already that crap happening all the time anyway. Now it just means if your recon dies you have no way to save your titan if it gets baited.
---
that's cool. Doesn't help them save their people and even if it does, they won't catch any of the attackers since bubbles and dscan are a thing.
---
Nope.  
---
It was a 75 day old character in NS. I figured it was either an alt or a bot.   
---
Was a nice killmail to end the night after having a carrier dropped on a pair of stratios lol
---
I pay for them on CC because plexing 17 accounts would be cancer without skill extraction, and I like training my alts. You just mmhave literally no fundamental understanding of game mechanics
---
I think relying on caps for everything is stupid anyway.
---
You seem like the kind of person that thinks climate change is a hoax perpetuated by Big Prius
---
I have a sneaky suspicion that CCP won't be touching wormholes. Call me paranoid, but I'm getting T20 vibes here with Hilmar being all wormholy
---
Goku fleets have their uses but I hold to the fact that this is a direct buff to super ratting, which doesn't need a buff. And it's a nerf to active hunting, which I argue should be buffed.
---
They end up where the cyno was
---
You clearly haven't met enough 3-month old players who injected into carriers with real money. There's literally hundreds of them in my alliance alone. You're disconnected from nee players.
---
I had my gila get stuck in the sun when I entered a gatecamped system as the server crashed. I lived at 0 hull and 100% shield, but couldn't warp, so I alt f4'd after 15 minutes. I got a killmail for the gila, ccp reimbursed me for it, and then my corpmate found it in the sun, but couldn't get it. Someone killed it a few days later though.
---
Thank you for your detailled answer. I try to wrap my head around all the Infos. This sounds like it is going to be a gamechanger... either good or bad
---
"noobies in ratting carriers" deserve the deaths they have coming for them. Caps aren't supposed to be easy to get and use.
---
Have you ever owned or undocked a capital ship? Caps do not land in the sun if the cyno they jumped to dies, that only happens to ships that are bridged.
---
Why give blops a cyno? seems a bit silly but ok
---
No I am not in snuff. This literally destroys the ability for smaller entities to fight bigger entities. Timely triage is crucial. We dont have the people to spare to fly 20 guardians. Let alone the effect its going to have on jf logistics. Terrible change. Not thought out. Wont create content the way blackout did will just snuff it out particularly in lowsec. Also makes it hard af to catch supers in lowsec.
---
just use bombers instead of rookie ships lol
---
Time to finally get that gate, right?! 😄
---
Csm
---
Your solution to me having to do more training to continue to play the game is to change how I play the game and do even more training?
---
How does that make any sense? That is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard.
---
Can we finally break out the Baghdad Bob memes again? It's an old meme, but it still checks out.
---
Oh and the t2bpcs are just gonna stay the same price? are you this mental.
---
K time to find a wormhole to live in...
---
Making lowsec the most active place uh? :)
---
I think CCP went too far on the polarization. I understand they're trying to mix up the game, but these changes seem to have very little thought besides "fuck it". Sometimes it's good to have that mentality, i.e. Blackout, but taking down local is a simple change that actually doesn't affect nearly as much as your player base.
---
They want to get rid of cheap cynos (rookie ships/ceptors) or impossible to kill ones (Caps). If that were the case, I think it'd be better set up like:
---
 "Cynos create too large of an energy field and would cause frigates and destroyers to crumple. In addition, the energy needed for a cyno causes interference with the jump drive of capital class vessels, therefore cannot be fit."  
---
This creates vulnerable cynos that will still require difficult movement and logistics, whilst also not fisting your player-base.  
---
Hypothetically, you COULD restrict if further, but I think that this would be a reasonable solution to achieve what CCP is looking for, and a more healthy one for the game.
---
Thing is it massively shortens the amount of time defenders have to jump capitals to the target. The first thing the attackers are going to do is drop an inhib, so the cloaked recon has to light the cyno immediately and then can't tank long enough to get the capital response organized. 
---
Probably capitals are just going to be cyno'd in off grid and warped in. Titans can be LR fit and fighters are fucking fast anyway. I'd have done the cap/subcap balance pass before this tbh.
---
Lowsec is not dead. If you cant find content in lowsec youre retarded
---
How about not using carriers to rat?
---
Should stage a hostile takeover of C C P Alliance tbh.
---
I bet the CEO never logs in
---
its also a direct slap to moving capitals. and moving jfs. which btw, affects everyone and not just big blocs. smarter way to at least start tweaking stuff would be to disallow capitals from lighting cynos, leaving subcaps untouched. and iterate from that
---
So lol. But true.
---
Also how is that 50+ Ferox gang going to get into system?
---
Holes will be the only way, since 50 feroxes taking gates is just asking to be boson'd.
---
Yes, if you send me isk in game I'm actually doing a promotion where you get an instant 100% interest added to your bank account ingame.
---
Sure, the newly created bank of me.  Send me your ISK and I swear I will double it.
---
Bombers are still bridgable, covops cynos are still the same.
---
your recon has to decloak every single time you take a gate, god forbid should anybody follow you as you gate around a hostile region, that would clearly never happen.
---
&gt;It sounds like you’re basically complaining that if you try to surprise blob someone, it’ll take a little bit of actual effort and you can’t just yeet a billion caps onto the field with 0 effort or planning as soon as a fight goes south.
---
And no, if you actually possessed reading comprehension skills you would understand I am complaining about the exact opposite. Any group who can actually "yeet" a billion caps on field with 0 effort will still be able to do so, and cares very little for their positioning or if one of their 20 cyno recons dies, they can just light another. Any group that has maybe 1-2 dudes who can actually be sacrificed to use as incynos will have 0 re-escalation potential or chance of winning a fight when engaged by a blob if anything happens to their 1-2 ricepaper incynos
---
&gt; Which group can absorb a potential 500m hit every time a cyno is needed? A large rich one or a smaller poorer one?
---
"Help, i'm a poor null sec corp and we can't afford to lose a 500m cyno ship..."
---
Maybe you shouldn't be in null then?
---
&gt;Which fleet can better protect a cyno ship and will have more cyno ships available in fleet, a large fleet or a small one?
---
"Help! Small null alliances can't afford as many cyno ships as large alliances!"
---
So what? small alliances can bring at least 5 easily. That's enough. Don't go down the rabbit hole of how 6 are better than 5, because n+1 is the name of this game anyways. SO your point is moot.
---
&gt;Which group is going to be able to have a cyno pilot in every system either logged in already or logged off ready to log in to warp to any tacked capital and light a cyno, the small group or the large one?
---
Cyno jammers are a thing. So if you want to warp your single poor man's arazu 100km away to light a cyno to save a ship that's up to you... you just won't catch a single hunter. Good luck with that frustration - whether you're big or small. Your point is again moot.
---
In sum, your arguments fall short because all they say is that n+1 has an advantage... and that is true regardless of these changes.
---
Next on the List is Warpcore Stabs, Nano and Wormhole holes not roleable/closeable anymore for 24h. Maybe they allow now cyno's to be lit in J Space would be funny right?
---
you say that while you're a part of the CFC...
---
Already have cyno 5 and 250 million so the old fashioned way on a few toons. So uhm yeah
---
astero cant fit covops cyno. also u mean cyno5 right. cos thats what u need
---
all they need is cloaky cynos spread out and cyno recons waiting on a bridging blops
---
&gt; Super/carrier/rorq farming with a cyno.
---
Just have the cyno alt alongside the super, and use a high slot for a capital rep to rep the cyno alt every so often. Enemy comes in, cyno up, first FAX that comes in puts reps on the cyno alt.
---
NC stood for Nothern Coalition, a coalition that once spanned the nothern third of EvE's 0.0 and were sort of famed for not being exactly good at PvP, only at blobbing. 
---
NC. (with a dot) stands for an Alliance named after that coalition by their most persistent enemies, Triumvirate, who attacked and failed and cascaded and were reborn so many times people had lost count. NC. were their verison number 5 or 6. Ironically a lot of former leading NC corporations that survived through the years ended up in NC. while most former Tri corps had left to reform Tri mk 6 and 7.
---
Hence if there would be a dot there, it would be the NC. - the current resident of the north. But since there is no dot - it is  an obvious homage to the old coalition and it's helpless carebears.
---
XD
---
You are not at all understanding how PLEX works. CCP gets paid when someone *BUYS* PLEX...they get nothing when it's traded or used in-game. The bittervets that use ISK to buy the PLEX in-game don't contribute anything to CCP's bottom line to do it. They're not paying money to omega their accounts.
---
That's not a buff to whaling then since you now have no targets.
---
oh boy, this is great! 
---
I went thru majority of the names whining on official forums, almost all from goons, test or brave, it's glorious! :D
---
hello let me introduce you to my friend Small Higgs Anchor
---
Is....is....he flair baiting with ASCEE? I cant tell
---
Cyno in off grid?
---
This. I want my talwar and rupture roams back. I want my drunken gate camps, my battleship meta, and my large capless brawls too.
---
HAPPENING STATUS: 5/7
---
This is great, obviously. I've been requesting cyno nerfs for a long time and this is more than I thought CCP would ever be likely to do. Now you need to put a dedicated cyno ship on the line which actually has some value, and which is relatively hard to tank massively.
---
Not being able to fit a cyno on a capital is a huge step - no more will you be able to escalate indefinitely, or sit in your ratting carrier safe in the knowledge that you can drop a cyno on anything that jumps you.
---
I do think though that there's still a problem with being able to cyno gank ratters. You can still put a covert cyno on a T3C, sit in system undetected and bridge a fleet of bombers onto someone with pretty much no counterplay. Cynos should still take time to activate, or it should be possible to turn them off before ships can jump through them, so it's possible for someone who gets jumped to prevent a blob appearing around them.
---
Anyone latching on specifically to the carrier point of my post is 100% missing the actual point if the post, which is that nerfing existing shit is bad game design, while buffing counterplay is good game design. Caps too strong? Buff inhibs and capital-specific counterplay mechanics.
---
Net platinum insurance on (e.g.) a Naglfar is 537M.
---
True, but also means you'd need to train all your JFer cyno alts to a relative higher SP ship to do so which = more $$$ for CCP which is why they are no doubt doing this too. Imagine having 9 mid points for your logistic route and getting away with using cheap throw away cynos?
---
One of these have access to a large network of jump bridges and have no urgent need for cynos to move.
---
so bombers / T3C online?
---
That's fine, cap warp time and align time is like a beached whale. Plenty of time to react.
---
so just use cyno beacons.
---
or off grid cyno. 
---
see? can still have 2000+ man titan tidi fests you LURVE so much.
---
A cyno recon in every rorq!
---
Dude, they sit in cloaky ships and wait for you to jump in. Then they light the cyno and bring in a dread. This has happened many times. You never ever jump to a staging beacon, no matter who says what.
---
They touched on JFs by making it able to take cov cynos.
---
Bubbles !
---
You and your 6 rorqs are aids.
---
My idea is a "logistics cyno" that costs 30mil (same as a bomber) but can be fit on anything. It disables all your modules if you jump anything other than a JF to it, and you can't online them (or can't engage in combat) for 5 minutes even after docking.
---
They can light a cyno using a recon off grid then warp in?
---
The other side lacks a significant number of caps or need for cynos in the first place.
---
They're right tho. Since when do we care which cyno ship is needed to defend our rorqs that are all fitted with remote repairs, again ?
---
Wildly Inappropriate when it was its own clusterfuck and not just a megacorp goon dumping ground.
---
your comment has proven to me how little you know of capital escalations
---
Well doh, long dead coalitions aren't exactly well known for being capable of defending anything.
---
Capitals need to fade away and die
---
It's telling the biggest threat this musters is "people will leave for the stale repackaged themepark".
---
Who knows? Right?
---
Buddy you're delusional and we all know you and the folks in BL don't give a flying fuck about how this impacts small gangs. 
---
How's this: you can actually get roaming fights without the there side dropping faxes and carriers as soon as you engage. Consider that, genius?
---
The price isn't going to change much. It's going to spike, then equalise, then lower again as more people get more T2 production going, which *isn't as hard as you make it out to be*.
---
And that's assuming it even *does* stay higher after the initial spike.
---
Just below dreadnaught levels
---
Imma say, for one time I agree with your post
---
Im seeing a lot of people reeing about people gonna ree but I dont see any....
---
If you can keep a Titan within range of enemy ratting systems you already have supercap supeority so why bother with Feroxes.
---
Except a small and unnecessary thing like logistics.
---
Imagine not having a covert cyno alt
---
Did you lose your YouTube channel password? Missing the videos :(
---
Yeah, now getting your strategic assets to a fight requires either control of the grid, gating them in, or control of a tactical grid elsewhere in system and then warping them in.
---
This is good - the escalation chain for capitals was very easy and pretty much impossible to break, which restricted tactical play.
---
for one thing, LONG GONE are the days when nullbears would drop several carriers on a single frigate.
---
Seriously. This. 
---
I don't understand people saying this is great for small groups? 
---
Big groups can deal with this fine. Small groups are gonna have problems.
---
I for one, can't wait to pay 300-400 million everytime I want to jump my carrier somewhere.
---
Okey lets pretend it works.
---
how is a covert cyno gonna help move a titan?
---
yeah i'm dumb. :)   it's pretty normal.  and yeah, cyno 5, will redo.
---
Don't live in stain??
---
Mfw already two comments on this, both immediately proving my point
---
THANKS YOU!  HO MY FUCKING GOD ,BLESS CCP &lt;3
---
And recons can be alphad. Now there's counterplay to the umbrella.
---
gottem. /s
---
14 bombers to replace each trip or risk 10bil hull to cyno in on some random spot in system.
---
That is actually not really a problem. You are on a random deep safe (ideally offgrid), light covops cyno, jump, warp, apply 3-4 webs and your JF is safe. You even have less waiting time on the cyno pilot.
---
Every single bank in eve is, was and will always turn out to be a scam. I personally wish it wasn't so but unfortunately that's just how eve is
---
At least in the 'stale repackaged themepark' you don't have the uncertainty hanging over your head that the devs will decide to start breaking game mechanics that help to keep the lights on.
---
PANIC should be removed from the game and congratulations on missing the point. I'm literally advocating massive buffs to cyno inhibs and an entirely new blops module that wirks as an INSTANT cyno inhib and everyone somehow thinks I'm in love with my caps. The only reason I shared that information is to highlight the fact that the changes are stupid because anyone tht went as max autism as I did on the alt spectrum will be unaffected.
---
Does this mean we'll FINALLY get a Black Ops rebalance?  The Widow's bonuses are useless with the ECM changes and they don't have enough DPS or tank to justify flying a BLOPs rather than bridging literally anything else.
---
CCPlease! (Make my Panther worth flying again?)
---
Ya, One way to look at it. lol.
---
Lowsec might actually thrive.
---
Very few areas of null are actually bubbled, having spent the last 3 months hunting all of them. They still won't know you're in local and you'll have a cloak so unless they have a scout on the gate they won't know you're there, and if they do then the super gets away anyway. As far active hunting, this is a buff to anything that isn't a dread bomb. Cyno inhibs have swollen in relevance and power, triage arriving on grid in 10 seconds is not a foregone conclusion now, if a cyno does decloak and light they have probably 10 seconds or less to get everything they need through before it dies. Stop bubbles are now an effective means of keeping later cynos at an impotent range. 
---
This is a buff to active hunting for groups that have coordination and strategy. This is a nerd to people hunting whose only contribution is a pulse.
---
There are damaviks that are attacking structures in high sec. Fun fact, some do kinetic em damage.
---
:wave:
---
It works both ways tho.
---
Open a cyno and every pilot with a brain with blast it off the field
---
What small group logistics do you think this is actually going to impact? Or are your two remaining brain cells just randomly generating words?
---
Alliance logistics just got fucked hard, I like it.
---
Lighting a cyno while sitting next to an astrahus isn't exactly dangerous, and even if you lose the ship it's now like a small group needs more than a couple of full jump freighters a week. If &lt; 800 mil in recons is the entry bar that people are smacking their heads on, they weren't cut out for null anyways.
---
Adapt or die.
---
Thats convenient.
---
While thats a good point, thats also a free kill for any sort of real gang.  They'll immediately prioritize your cyno character and blap it in seconds likely before the super/etc even notices.
---
&gt; How does that make any sense?
---
it makes perfect sense - you're whining about your gameplay, so it was suggested that you find fun in another way.
---
it's kind of wholesome actually. but you're too salty to get it.
---
Imagine
---
I think hunters can adapt easily, but qq more. We all know you don't actually care about the little guy.
---
I love the idea of no more cynos on Vexors
---
You know your cyno interceptors not only have to decloak when they take gates, but also warp decloaked too right?
---
I would rather cyno to covops cyno and web the jf in warp, which is actually not as bad it sounds (with the added bonus of your cyno only burning 1 minute instead of 10.
---
Delete subcaps then they can’t cry about capitals :D
---
This, basically. Most competent hunters will have combat probes set up on the anom so that they can one cycle the cyno immediately and kill it. And if he’s not already in the site, an inhib is gonna go up and it’ll be too late.
---
Bastion my dude
---
&gt; a couple of fights out of hundreds where PL weren’t massively overwhelming the people they were fighting.
---
Name them.
---
No need to get upset when someone points out something that doesn't work with your narrative.
---
&gt;This is a bigger impact on things most folks don't consider.
---
totally agreed - folks need to finally consider how positively this affects the real eve players - the pvpers.
---
Milk for the Khorne flakes!
---
So hard to probe ships with massive signatures. Unbonused probing is the least of your worries.
---
Now train them to covert cyno - just btw
---
Okay, so then why complain about having to fly around a fleet that might get killed? You don't have superiority. 
---
Maybe you should have to fly your fleet through their space dangerously, rather then just be hop skip and jumped to the enemy?
---
Also, if you didnt have titan within bridging range, isn't your complaint completely moot given the context? you wouldnt be able to bridge before these changes either...
---
true, but its a big nerf since you need cyno5 and covops hulls to light it instead of readily available noobships. not saying its the end of the world but its a giant inconvenience
---
Correct.
---
Pointed with what? Supers have native 25 warp strength.
---
But incentive and conflict driving is the same thing man.
---
But considering the recent announcement of cynos I think asset safety is the next to go so you will have your wish. I will however say, "careful what you wish for".
---
caps warping on grid in tidi is suicide
---
Could you give me a refund?
---
I could sell you a few nyx at the low low precitadel price of 20b each
---
I actually quite liked it when I went to Iceland, but I'm OK with caraway.
---
Karma doesn't specialize in newbies anymore, and Brave is prone to internal strife and bullshit so I *choose* not to tell people about Brave.
---
I want players to stay, so I direct them to groups likely to make that happen.
---
Struggle on young man
---
Curses jumped with the blackout too. Give it time, it'll stabilize.
---
Not sure about those systems specifically, but presumably there are people there who enjoy shooting the cyno boat.
---
When cyno boats are 30m bombers rather than 1m noobships, and you get a killmark for them, expect that to increase.
---
AMEN
---
the data shows more activity in eve than ever before. did you miss that big top-of/r/eve headline by Hilmar? Data is on the pvper's side my friend. Your gameplay isn't as popular in eve as you thought, but nullbearing certainly had gotten out of hand as seen from the proliferation of capital ships everywhere.
---
If you are even a medium sized entity trying to fight a massive group with 10s of thousands of members you weren't going to win a fight in the first place before and you still wont now and if you are in that fight then wtf are you doing there? This is the way the game is now and will continue to be, I will agree there. On the other hand you have to look at it in more ways than just big group vs small group. You need to look at it as small group vs small group, small group vs medium group, medium group vs medium group. Roaming gangs vs small/medium groups. It helps every one of these examples fighting against a capital disadvantage by being able to deny your enemies the use of capitals. Unless of course your average small/medium group or roaming gang starts training up a force recon alts in large numbers.
---
TIL you have to be in a "large bloc" to fly a recon
---
How am I supposed to afford my 10,000,000,000 ISK Jump Freighter if I have to potentially risk a 30,000,000 Prospect or Manticore for 60s at a time everytime I jump to my Astrahus?? It's not like we could pre-form and sit on our own covert cyno with 2-3 PVP ships so a solo PVPer can't just meme our solo t2 frigate right? UNTENABLE I'm fucking unsubbing right now.
---
All I'm saying is that this goes against the design philosophy they said they were going for in the interview on TiS. Personally this change effects me little, I don't rat in a carrier, I hate mining and how I make my ISK isn't effected. I just thinks it's philosophically a bad decision but I will enjoy hunting small group ratters more easily.
---
Also "The blackout is going to literally destroy small group playstyles", when most solo/small groups I've heard have said that they've either not noticed a change in the amount of content or have noticed an uptick (not counting all of the small groups taking over tribute/vale which goons are ironically taking credit for because they flip flop their narrative faster than tapi blues new alliances)
---
I thought this sub was pretty much in agreement that 'balancing for the little guy' was a universally bad mindset after fozzie sov and the hell that is all the mechanics around citadel bashing, but I guess its easier to say "*I* can adapt to these changes with my 6 million accounts but think of the *little guy*" than just admitting that they don't like the change because it nerfs their playstyle.
---
Right now goons can ignore most of this change just by using the Flex cyno beacons. They have one in practically every system. 
---
Meanwhile, alliances without as much infrastructure are now going to have to throw away a couple hundred mil every time they move a cap or gate caps around and lose them to dreadbombs.
---
&gt; Yes it's very hard for the small groups to field recon cynos, how will they cope
---
Oh shit! Rest in peace EvE. This is going to shred the game. And I just paid 1 year subscriptions 2 months ago. On 5 accounts. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Easier to just remove Stain from the map anyway
---
Cyno alts without cyno V?
---
What is this? Poor country?
---
In all seriousness though, 3 of mine already have it for blops ops. The rest can train them up easily. I just can't have two routes  pre-staged without jumpcloning in the meantime.
---
gee whizz you'll need to think of a way around that then won't you?
---
Light cyno, jump caps in. If you are worried about the recon or blops not lasting long enough, maybe bring a second one?  
---
The only bad thing is movement of capital ships as solo player without an expendable cyno.
---
Sure they can do that, but it takes effort and is a major improvement on the current cyno on every pve capital / super.
---
Nice jump In Z-R96X, you don't like my fortizar lol ?
---
If Im not mistaken mango means dog in chinese and is the name given to them by their opposition. They started using it instead. Was in a RnK video.
---
hic?  bubblers? you're just being thick now.
---
This doesn't change the metrics, cut that bullshit.
---
What the actual fuck?
---
is that true? 
---
How we fuckin move shit now?
---
Somehow forgot about bombers lol. Thanks, updated post lol
---
adapt or quit.
---
what?
---
it just nerfed hotdrops , nothing else really
---
Ok, feel free to delete your post now
---
Ok, so it's 3 of them. How small's the smallest reasonable dreadbomb anyway? They're never catching reps, so always local tanked (active or buffer).
---
&gt; nd when fighting a group of my own size, I am now gimped a not-insignificant portion of my fleet in any subcap engagement
---
Or you could try not dropping capitals on a 'subcap engagement'
---
How many small gangs do you think aren't going to be able to afford to upgrade from a 2m loss rookie ship to a 30m ISK loss cyno manticore or prospect if you don't defend it on your own citadel?
---
The bubble isn't for the ceptor. The Recon isn't immune. The ceptor would need to burn to a perch out of line of the bubble making the positioning sub-optimal.
---
Recons can get pretty reasonable buffers as well, not saying they won't get popped but you can push around 150k pretty easily without slaves on a smaller sig on like a pilgrim if you are just looking for a cyno platform.
---
Beacons from travel are not the relevant part of this change. The heavier felt effect is on the power of super umbrellas to save people and the ability to instantly escalate any other fight. And in this regard it is a hit to goons, however well you might try to minimize it.
---
Small groups weren't ratting in carriers or supers anyway.
---
So let me get this straight, you think that someone who only pays with plex doesn't contribute anything to the game at all? That CCP doesn't make any money from them at all? Is that your point?
---
Because that's just plain wrong. Let me break this down.
---
I pay with a credit card. CCP makes $15 from me a month.
---
Someone else pays with a credit card and buys 500 plex a month. CCP makes $15 from their omega status, and $20 for the plex.
---
A third party pays with plex. They buy the plex for isk.
---
But guess what? You're forgetting a crucial step - that there has to be a value for the plex in isk or no one buys it from CCP. This holds true no matter what game it it - plex in eve, tokens in wow, bonds in RS, etc. 
---
If there are 100,000 people plexing their account, and 100,000 people paying with a card, CCP still has 200,000 *paying* subscribers - not 100,000. They are still getting paid *at least* $15/month per person. Its simply where the money comes from that changes.
---
There's an equilibrium that's found between the isk value needed to plex, and the cash value needed. As people stop plexing, and plex goes down, people stop buying plex to sell, since its worth less.
---
More people plexing = higher plex price = more plex sales.
---
And since CCP gets 25% more when someone uses plex instead of paying directly, they actually get more revenue that way. Plus, it enables people to play who otherwise wouldn't or couldn't.
---
I've bought some plex to sell because I could get a decent amount from it, which matters as a new player. But if I only got 1/3 or 1/2 of what I had gotten, I wouldn't have bought it, or bought less.
---
So yes, if someone is plexing their account, they are still helping CCP's bottom line. It really is basic economics. Like, the simplest form of supply and demand you can get.
---
And, if nothing else, by your argument CCP is letting people plex out of the goodness of their hearts? Can't see any other reason why they'd allow it, if they didn't actually make money off it.
---
Why is that Piece of shit excuse for a game even relevant. They are relaunching the vanilla version because they can't make original content to save their life. At least eve bothered with a graphical update like 10 years ago, wow is still on the 2003 engine cloned of the Warcraft 3 engine probably
---
Or, just fix it.  I know, crazy idea, get corrected, fixed.
---
Point being?
---
I wasn't whining about my gameplay. That won't change. I was complaining that now I need to pay CCP more money to continue to do the same thing in the game. That sucks, but probably by design.
---
My problem wasn't about having fun in eve. It is about being fleeced for more money. Your suggestion to give them even more money shows that you can't understand a simple post. Hell you probably won't understand this one either.
---
"Agruing with stupid people just brings you down to their level where they can beat you with experience" or something to that effect. I'm done.
---
Its one rapier, Michael. What could it cost? 10b isk?
---
or else they could afford several 500m arazus. :P
---
I'll take losing a few ratting Domi's when I didn't have Caps to cyno to them anyways over getting every single gang I form dropped by haw dreads every day of the weak. Thanks for asking.
---
Just remember to also blaming active player count drop on bots too lmao.
---
I wonder how many other people are like me - own a JF, but do not have a toon with Cyno 5, nor do I own a recon.  
---
Might as well "clean ship" on that JF, looks like it will only be good for spinning for a little while.
---
**33d 18h to train Cyno 4-&gt;5 off-map BTW if anyone is curious.**
---
**5d 2h to train Cyno 3-&gt;4 off-map**
---
&gt; This means only the Large coalitions can use caps
---
I don't really agree with that, but even if that's true, it still stops large alliances from dropping caps willy-nilly on everything, so it would still be positive.
---
Null doesnt produce a lot of isk like before because of the BO.
---
The drop will be huge
---
Yah, the difference between reddit sperg vs what small groups actually think is absolutely hilarious. I don’t know a single one of my friends in any small group that doesn’t absolutely love all these changes.
---
The nullbloc fake outrage on behalf of the little guy is absolutely hilarious lmao
---
2016-2018 TRI, before power hungry envious morons destroyed it.
---
Hooray, counterplay!
---
Hahahahahaha, love it
---
Actually my corp did run a bank that was not a scam.  
---
That was 10 years ago though,we shut it down because the guy running it stopped playing.
---
You've never actually set foot in Jita 4-4, have you?
---
lol what  ?
---
🤔 Just like I thought lmao
---
you don't have cynos 5 on your JF cyno alt?  I dont even know how people would work like that... hell mine could light cynos off tanked cloaky haulers.
---
&gt; Your suggestion to give them even more money
---
no, i suggested you go hunt people. You don't need multiple cynos to hunt - just one main. 
---
So... if anything, my solution is to give them less money? :P
---
Maybe you're reading my comments too fast to understand my suggestion.
---
Well yeah, it's exponentially harder for a group of 40 dudes to field a recon than it is for a group of 40,000. Especially when the 40K have home field advantage.
---
If you can train a JF you can spare the what, 2 weeks? to train cyno5 my dude
---
i'll always adapt to the least unfun way of playing, if that means paying a bit more for shipping, so be it
---
I AM the little guy. I play with about 10 guys and our alts. This change will remove more of MY options for fighting the blob than options the blob has to fight ME.
---
They weren't already?
---
One thing with the prospect, compared to the bombers, it has _far_ more meat on the bones, profit wise. So that price has room to fall, wrt competition.
---
I would LOVE the cyno-bubble. So good.
---
Wingspan is definitely the best corp I've been in. I've made some good friends in that corp over the years.
---
I am all for change but this is absolutely pants-on-head retarded.
---
I think that this change is a very good case for Stain to have a wandering LS wormhole.
---
 It also makes sense lorewise because sansha have ability to generate wormholes. 
---
^^this ^^is ^^not ^^a ^^sponsored ^^message
---
Lovely Lovely Lovely changes!! Bravooooo CCP!!
---
For those crying, now is time to think of new strategies and advantages...  Change is for the strong... If it will not kill you it will make you stronger!!!
---
Quite a bit below dread levels actually. 
---
Marauders are in a rough spot.
---
&gt; This literally destroys the ability for smaller entities to fight bigger entities.
---
I think this cuts both ways. Bigger entities fighting smaller ones will have a tougher time escalating, if they didn't come through with overwhelming force right away.
---
&gt; Let alone the effect its going to have on jf logistics
---
Our jf logistics are squeeing at the thought of 30s covert cynos. What, your alts are not covops-capable?
---
You can fit 3-4 webs and your cyno is not on the overview.
---
My Luck:
---
Spent months training an off-grid link alt.  Month later: all links turned to on-grid links only.
---
Spent several months training into caps for cap ratting and rorq mining, making sure I had the minimum skills for my corp to let me in the cap group.  Now this :P
---
I'm not exactly complaining.  There are some other things I could do, especially after hopefully being able to sell some of these ships...but just funny timing.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=858,860,857&amp;b=8739030&amp;e=60&amp;t=bv
---
Jump freighters can take covert cynos now, so they did think of them at least before nerfing regular cynos
---
Yeah of course there will be. If you have 15-30BB on field in your krabbing fleet, adding a Pilgrim cloaked 500 off, or even at a pounce further out, ready to light for QRF reinforcements isn't breaking anything.
---
Worse will be small groups wanting to dread bomb, or escalate a fight with faxes, carriers or dreads, or bring in a hac/drek fleet.
---
Oh and people, who are not part of the big blocks, will now be severely hampered buying supers or titans. Good luck getting yours out of Camal or Basgerin now. We'll just continue to get ours in 1DQ of course.
---
least unfun?
---
Really?
---
These changes are going to create so much fun its not even funny.
---
I bet you're upset that removing ventures from FW plex is unfun too.
---
Or, just don’t post until you actually have correct info and know what you are talking about. Also a crazy idea...
---
To be fair, from a macro perspective, it's just not really economical to try to proactively defend subcap ratters.  
---
Everyone running around in a defense fleet instead of krabbing themselves is lost income, and if they would otherwise be supercap krabbing, it takes a LOT of saved subcaps to make up that ISK delta.  
---
I try to support my newer guys by directing them towards more viable alternatives, because having alliance mates onhand to defend their relatively low-yield ratting is just too big an ask, and the math doesn't really pan out.
---
Business as usual?
---
Also, thats what you guys said during blackout. Been to delve during blackout, there were not titans and hics on every gate.
---
No, they're scattered all over the place. At least the ones I hunt, though there are a couple of bubbled dead end systems. Which is why we used nullified tengus to hunt.
---
1.2bil ISK sounds like a cheap tax to pay for jumping an entire fleet of whatever caps and supercaps in.
---
how do you think titan and supercarriers were ever held down in the first place? by single scram cyno ships? :P
---
You're not wrong about the "solo pwnmobiles" being retarded but that change came and went. You seem to have the same mentality as americans who thinks that because *they* were treated poorly by the system, that everyone else *also* deserves to be treated poorly. ALL players should have better representation, and bridging the gap between new and old playstyles can be done without nerfing caps further. There is a huge amount of subcapital hull diversity, and ship classes looking or new niche roles (e.g. Blops having an activatable cyno-inhib bubble)
---
Holy shit the urge to resub intensifies hugely
---
Cloaky T3C and Stratios can fit enough large smartbombs to clear out bubbles you need to be cleared out. Ships got guns for the HIC's.
---
You have no idea how large capital fights work clearly.
---
Yes right .... and single cycle of combats will not bring interceptor to tackle your JF.         
---
Drop combat probes in system on a bonused ship and try to probe freighter, then give this suggestions.       
---
If someone is looking you - the bomber is already dead, so why risk  JF.
---
With all the crazy going on, no one will notice the CSM with insider data using it to farm reddit upvotes.
---
Fuck me it's all over the place. 
---
Still has no point beyond "I HAVE 10 ACCOUNTS WITNESS ME"
---
Force recons are catchable on gates, bombers much less so.
---
At this point, everyone should be living in HS .. all other space is useless now and it gives us more things to pew-pew!
---
It's simple:
---
They don't.
---
Because you're not thinking, that's all. Why should your gang not be dropped by capitals, fariness ? Balance ?
---
I was thinking about this. Won't you just warp in a bomber, light covert, jump in max tank Blobs BS, Blobs BS cynos in faxes etc. And have the fax keep the blobs up this cyno goes down?
---
This is just generic route in stain by TNN. 
---
Simply proving the point
---
And what if you just gave up on Stain as a region you wanted to go to altogether?
---
Give it to the Chinese, see how they will like to kvetch and mewl about not having a gate to Stain.
---
know why he didn't say anything?
---
cos he has fuck all intention of rebalancing anything.
---
They are throwaway because of the cyno mechanic. No one needs a 10 minute cyno so people made them expendable.
---
I still stand by my comment.
---
I spent 200b to booshers and 5
---
400b plus 900$ to an afk camper network just to have blackout rendering them useless :). Sometimes we take one for the game.
---
That's what his TL;DR should be.
---
I am in favor of the shakeups so far, but I'm curious as to what ccp sees as the ideal accessibility to low and medium tier pve content. The VNI nerfed, and now carrier ratting will be more dangerous(or require a dedicated cyno alt babysitter). Those pve methods before had their share of problems, I just wonder if these shakeups will have corresponding bluffs or reworks of content to make getting out into dangerous space fun and appealing. I dont think herding everyone into rorquals or abyssal space is what is intended, but seems to be the trend
---
&gt;  I don’t think it’ll be worth bridging 50 corvettes...
---
Perhaps this is not a terrible thing.
---
Just have it do what PANIC does, but to all your modules. Hit the Emergency Cyno and it heats all your modules too 100%
---
You can get a baddon to 1M hp
---
Balance obviously. Why are the most powerful, most tanky, most dangerous ships able to move across space and arrive at a battle faster than literally anything else in the game with zero risk and near zero setup?
---
Thanks guys
---
So highsec has now become the #1 source of isk income in Eve now? lol
---
Or jumping a ship that costs less than the cyno. Wait no that doesn't make sense.
---
Happy as fuck.
---
sabres you need to bring sabres, while hictor is tankier it cannot light cyno so survive on grid long enough .... unless armor hic with ab ... but how you get it into the system first.
---
They're not sending their best
---
Well, if providence is doing so well under blackout, can you all start undocking again?
---
For real, Rise just gave me the best birthday present.
---
You are operating under one big assumption...that the people plexing their accounts are buying *anything* with their credit card. If you have 100,000 people that use a credit card to Omega (for $15) and 100,000 people that buy plex in-game for ISK...CCP has made $1.5m (less credit card fees).
---
I can Rorq mine for a week and use the money I made in-game to plex 5 accounts. Those 5 accounts are now Omega, and I didn't pay a dime of my real-life money to do it. Yes, somebody sold me PLEX...but it's *those* people that are contributing to the revenue stream of CCP, not me.
---
I'm not saying people that buy plex in-game aren't contributing to the game...I'm saying they're not contributing to the revenue stream/bottom line of CCP. Those people are needed to make the game enjoyable, provide content, and give someone for the plex-buyers to sell to, but if those people left the game the game wouldn't fold...if the newbros stopped coming, it would.
---
CCP should be addressing the concerns/issues of the newbros, not the bittervets. That's where their income actually comes *from*.
---
Hics aren't gating through hostile space unless the hostile is very, very incompetent. Even more than goons.
---
And that is relevant how?
---
we used to do it all the time in pos era; you fleetwarp with your in cyno and youre instantly inw arp after you lock it. literal 0 risk unless you get caught with a catch bubble or disconnect
---
or you blops bridge an arazu in at 0 with a cloaky nullified t3 which will light cyno and bring the cavalry in... it wouldnt affect the bigger groups but like the small guys are fucked moving stuff around
---
got em
---
&gt;If you are even a medium sized entity trying to fight a massive group with 10s of thousands of members you weren't going to win a fight in the first place before and you still wont now and if you are in that fight then wtf are you doing there?
---
Like trying not to be too much of a smug douchebag about it, if you really can't comprehend why someone would do this I am happy to give you many examples of times we have dropped capitals or supercapitals onto an alliance 10-20x our size and completed our objective without losing too much stuff, heavily facilitated by the ability of any ship to fit a cynosural field generator. This is of course not an every day occurrence and requires alot more than just an interceptor cyno, but it is a part of gameplay, and one I think is pretty good, and the one that will be most significantly negatively affected by these changes. And then to your point
---
&gt;On the other hand you have to look at it in more ways than just big group vs small group. You need to look at it as small group vs small group, small group vs medium group, medium group vs medium group. Roaming gangs vs small/medium groups.
---
I do specifically most often look at it in this way, as of course most of the fighting will take place under these circumstances.  I will concede I generally fight with heavy capital superiority, so my opinion is biased, for sure. But it is a very useful tool to be able to escalate (or often more importantly, extract) at will when fighting a very numerically superior force.
---
I actually wouldn't mind if the change restricted cynos off of capital ships themselves, and forced you to use subcaps, I think that genuinely does only help the smaller, already disadvantaged group, and significantly weaken the response potential of the larger group, but I think restricting it only to very clunky, slow, fragile hulls is a serious oversight and will severely limit any capital engagement on any scale in a negative way, always favouring the side with superior manpower, capital superiority or not.
---
&gt; It's pretty clear ccp still doesn't play their game or have any idea how nullsec logistics work.
---
No I think they absolutely do understand how it works, and think that it's far too easy.
---
im in a small pvp corp based in lowsec, and we do use jfs/caps routinely. if you dont see how those changes make it a lot more frustrating to use both those things then idk
---
gasp, you mean catching things is hard?
---
why would you need cyno 5 for a cyno alt in a rookie ship?  Seems like a waste of training.
---
It is time we finally end this once and for all
---
Do you really think that's the plan? 
---
I don't think any of the changes increase the bottom line for CCP short-term.      
---
People have armies of cyno alts sitting around new eden where they might be needed. And to use them they always had to be omega.      
---
I don't think the sane response to these changes is to create *more* cyno alts and to inject them into force recons.
---
Or just move at downtime.
---
*gasp*
---
Its almost like changes that are about balancing the massive shit show that it current nullsec super cap blobs effects other game styles and those people need to adapt.
---
Were you around for the carrier changes vs nanogangs?  Because its exactly the same sort of shoe is on the other foot as it is now.
---
If you need advice how to deal with this let me know. I have experience and if you want team20 to win, I am your guy.
---
Can someone help out a brother that is stuck behind a firewall at work?
---
Oh boy are you lost in anger 😂😂😂
---
They are not faster than anything else, Bridges exists for a reason. And it's zero risk against you, not everyone else. Look at the killboards.
---
I don't get why people playing in small gangs think they should be able to disrupt anything put in place by a major alliance without taking the time to prepare for it.
---
I am not going to miss it personally. Black ops for the win!
---
Gila's nerf made no difference to PVE unless you're so AFK you don't notice a drone getting shot for a really long time.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2011/08/12/biggest-eve-online-scam-ever-recorded-nets-over-a-trillion-isk/
---
Last one I remember
---
Oh yea I forgot about all those bridging Titans the little guys are sending fleets with, my bad lol
---
Is it April 1st already?
---
Hold up ill pay so much for that bookmark.
---
" 
---
* Cynosural Field Generator I can only be fit by Force Recon Ships and Black Ops Battleships (note: these classes can still fit covert cynos)
---
* Jump Freighters can jump to Covert Cynosural Fields"
---
Did ccp just toss out hundreds of hours of player time and money in one go? Yes
---
&gt; Very few areas of null are actually bubbled,
---
Currently, yes. Because most super hunters are nullified so it's not very useful right now. But I expect that's about to change.
---
&gt; They still won't know you're in local and you'll have a cloak so unless they have a scout on the gate they won't know you're there, and if they do then the super gets away anyway. 
---
Exactly, that's one of my big concerns with this (the other being the extra session timer, which gives them more time to react). If supers move to more defensible areas with bubble camps I expect that they'll have eyes watching the entrances, because why wouldn't you?
---
&gt; Cyno inhibs have swollen in relevance and power, triage arriving on grid in 10 seconds is not a foregone conclusion now, if a cyno does decloak and light they have probably 10 seconds or less to get everything they need through before it dies. Stop bubbles are now an effective means of keeping later cynos at an impotent range.
---
I agree with you here, and consider that to be one of the good parts about this change. It's not all bad but I do think it needs to be tweaked to be better.
---
You've never theory crafted a pilgrim or arazu hard cyno have you?  In fleet fights yes, but in ganks you're not head shotting either of those if they're purpose fit for the task.
---
it does when the other ship is moving still because traversal is relative to the ship shooting
---
What chain is subcap cyno -&gt; cap cyno -&gt; titan fleet; anyway?
---
more like schadenfreude
---
no idea if youve seen my other posts, but if the problem was uniquely the nullsec supercapital umbrella, why not only make it so capitals and supers cant light cynos?
---
Thanks for pointing it out. I hadn't gone back to the main page in a while.
---
I do think BLOPS/COVOPS should be changed so that aggressing or jumping through a cyno causes a 5 min timer for the cloak to be used again.
---
Now capitals require planning and aren't a surefire escalation. Actual counterplay!
---
&gt; Just sounds to unnecessary to me if you're just moving your capital, which is somewhere in your space over to, let's say, a new staging
---
Why should it be trivial to move a huge capital ship a long way, when it's a massive pain to move a battleship the same distance?
---
It is *a good thing* if you can't project capital power across the cluster at the drop of a hat.
---
if someone drops caps on you even small guys drop caps back
---
i think there's a difference between "small group play style" and the ability for small groups to actually grow in to groups that matter.
---
pretty easy to get a recon to have a fat ass tank
---
What about those carrier pilots who want to use frigate cynos to move stuff? This penalizes this group and just makes it more expensive and we now have to train our alts into recon skills? Ugh...
---
Guess you'll have to consider cost vs return, and use your brain. Oh well!
---
&gt;If you think it's somehow good then you are absolutely retarded. 
---
&gt;you fucking moron
---
&gt;you idiot 
---
LOVE. THE. SALT.
---
Yes, cause I'm sure the GSM is filled with great unbiased minds and would not just try and shift it to everyone gets dicked but the blob.
---
If you have probes on dscan, don't light the cyno? Or do the save thing and cyno at a structure and eat a 35m loss.  
---
Also keep in mind: Jump Freighters are not the only thing that can jump to that covops cyno, so if you run into this a lot, maybe have a surprise on standby.
---
&gt; Jump Freighters can jump to Covert Cynosural Fields
---
huh? or do you mean something else?
---
Recons are still more effort than the cyno on the ship itself or an interceptor. It forces extra steps on the defenders. I do think it's a net positive especially since it really doesn't hurt smaller entities that much, most of them have a guy or two that will fill the role of cyno now and coverts work the same.
---
Just use a rapier, light cyno, web freighter off. Job done.
---
small gang shit has dropped off a cliff actually
---
Are you high? Put that spoon and lighter down.
---
I'm sure if I just ask nicely while bringing my 10man fleet somewhere the locals will unsub their capital ships or not blob the fuck out of me
---
Moving around prospects from system to system might become the norm, at least in the interim. Fewer accounts, less training time required overall, with a little more risk.
---
Just a hint, most small gang groups use ships like the zu and the rapier already.
---
literally zero change for them.
---
To each their own for sure, but having spent 90% of my EVE career in smaller groups, I think this change is great.
---
I can't even count the number of times we've been dropped on and I've said, "Oh, I guess the fun is over." Instead of "Oh now we get to escalate."  Not because we couldn't, we had a disproportionate number of caps to members often times, but I always just found capital ship gameplay to be fucking boring.  
---
I have to trade in my fast paced and exciting sub-cap pvp for big, slow, often times more expensive pigs just so I can say "We won."  Usually that phrase was never uttered next to the phrase "And I had fun." When it came to a capital escalation.
---
Thanks space bro.
---
translate that to plex, skill injectors, then to cash now
---
You'll be able to kill caps by blopsing them now tho. No more super umbrella to protect them
---
So, basically, the entirety of POS code has to go in order to make the game healthy again? Well shucks, guess that's how it's gotta be, then. I wonder if CCP can reuse the assets for other things, like a new FOB or outpost system?
---
My non-JF pack mule can also drives the regular freighter, the cloaky hauler, and other toys.  Also it allows you to use Cyno-ceptors and amarrian noob ships as cynos without expanders.
---
Well I care a fuck ton cause I do all those things I mentioned
---
Solo carrier ratting was pretty boring, I'm not going to lie. But now carriers are pretty terrible at everything.
---
Instead of making carrier ratting more interesting and challenging, they just made it virtually impossible. It's only a matter of time before a blops gang drops a cyno inhib on you and kills you in about 20 seconds.
---
"The little guy". Sorry my dear, you want to disrupt things made by people that spent countless hundreds of hours to put in place ? Fucking work for it. Stop being entitled to "krabs kills because they don't matter" just because you undocked.
---
You get on someone turf, he has the right to hammer you back to Jita. Not happy ? Bring dreads and kill the response fleet. Can't do that ? Go fight something at your size.
---
The Covert Cynosural Field Generator is a module similar to the regular Cynosural Field Generator, but it can only be fit to Black Ops Battleships, as well as all ships that can fit a Covert Ops Cloaking Device, with exception of the Astero and Stratios:
---
bruh rvb gonna fight you with wolves fitted with railguns
---
&gt; Imagine having 9 mid points for your logistic route and getting away with using cheap throw away cynos then having to train those cyno toons and use a ship worth 300-400 million plus.
---
* ***Jump Freighters can jump to Covert Cynosural Fields***
---
CovOps only cost like 20 mil. And 60s cynos! That don't broadcast your landing point to the entire universe! Time to get those training queues switched around if you want to be ready!
---
I think cyno procurers in low sec should still be allowed.
---
How much dps do high-sec gate guns dish out? Are they the same as low sec?
---
no they didn't - you still have the cyno skills.
---
all you're required to do now is to use your brain a bit to utilize those skills better.
---
LOLLL SALT LOLLLL
---
😂🤣
---
It's time for the age of aggression and our new god "cyno inhib".
---
Offensively, it may hurt small groups in some ways, but the big blocs with super umbrellas that krab in the big stuff are gonna be impacted a lot more I think. It basically necessitates, at minimum, a cloaked covert ops ship with cynos to go with every ratting carrier, but those will just get headshotted by anyone that had the forethought to bring combat probes, and it’ll probably bring back the prevalence of standing defense fleets. The latter is a great content generator and gives a bigger spot in the meta for subcaps.
---
based
---
Nah we're still going to bring bombers and haze your shit. Enjoy watching your ratting carrier burn nerd.
---
It's not going to be more cyno alts but having to train them all to cyno 5 and get them in different ships for JF chains. Most people I know use ceptors to move alts in but you can't light cynos with those anymore. 
---
As far as cap alts, getting them into force recons means a lot of training too. It's short term but it means a lot of SP needed which drives more money for CCP.
---
The Bookmark does not work, i scaned a neut on sun and warp to him only to see what he was doing, and got bumped to hell
---
Check chart below.  Done already, Bill.  :)
---
and those sabres will still be just as difficult to kill with a HAW titan or supercarrier, as before these changes.
---
So op's point fails.
---
Because they obviously want to still have some impact on other areas of gameplay.
---
It was mainly about the supercap blob, but I also think this will have serious impacts on fleet warfare leading to the death of more assets which is what CCP wants.
---
Every time someone says this, people choose quit and then players like you freak out because less people are playing. I have yet to see anyone who runs this line actually understand the consequences of repeatedly causing more players to quit.
---
not if it already in system.    Or the hanger of a rorq.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8
---
BUFF blops then FFS.
---
And make the widow actually usable.
---
&gt; edit: also why the fuck do u implement broken shit like ansyblex jump bridges and jump gates and dont touch them parallel to this change
---
Yeah really weird that they just made it way easier to jump around, including with capitals, and that isn't also nerfed in this proposal.
---
Hey remember when that one change that has nothing to do with this change happened and it wasnt relevant?
---
[citation needed]
---
MWAP
---
T'will be difficult, I'm not ratting nor mining, try again. In the meantime we will still drop you with capitals like before.
---
Episode II: Have a Recon!
---
Solid organization is nearly impossible to break. v0v
---
I think that a healthy game balance and design will bring players back and the numbers of eve players have been dwindling month after month due to blue donut stagnation and abuse of skill injectors.
---
These changes are good for the long term health of this game.
---
I'd say this def helps the little guys out. It slows down the escalation process a lot which will help small nimble games do lots of damage quickly and move before the hammer falls.
---
I'd said maybe give it also to dreads ? In order to make capital vs capital fights a bit more stable ? Otherwise relying on recon which can be blapped by subcaps  pretty quick or blops which can be blapped by Haws pretty quick could make thing awkward.
---
With that I meant you're in some ratting pocket with your carrier, just as an example. It's not terribly far to staging but you're not gating. So just moving it over as you're finished for the day or whatever. I think there should be something in place that allows you to easily light a cyno in a ship other than preparing a recon for that.
---
Deployng somewhere or moving far into hostile / neutral space is something completely different.
---
Super tldr; You turn on overheat and its has % chance to heat damage the module and modules adjacent to it (fitting window), everything is fine and dandy until it hits 100% when the module burns out at which point you can't use it until you repair it via station, citadel or nanite paste and reonline it.
---
Fireworks.
---
RIGHT? Everybody's all pissy and crying for small groups and shit, this is fantastic for solo and small gang pilots.  You're now looking for 8 ships to avoid instead of "all of them might drop a cyno on you"
---
You tell him Gump.
---
I mean sure, if you're just nano roaming or actually using blops it's very normal, but then you're probably not generally concerned about bringing in your own capital ships, and if you are you probably don't want to lock your Arazu or Rapier in place for 5 minutes to do it.
---
which small gangs can also do, so that point doesn't work.
---
The only difference is now it'll cost you 500 mil and a little effort. See, that wasn't so painful now was it? I'm definitely looking forward to baiting out and killing expensive cyno ships.
---
snowball launcher.
---
I am literally gonna abuse the fuck out of this with lonely blops in the middle of space with a cyno lit. Couple haw dreads and a fax waiting LOLOLOL
---
If people are actively defending their ratters be they subs or supers by being out in space and proactive then the ratters ought to be safe. And in this case then you can now fight the gang that's running the protection. You got content. That's the point for so many of us. People aren't out in space that much nowadays and so we've turned to catching caps supers and rorqs because they're more numerous and easier to catch and provoke people to form a response. The idea of roving patrols of people out and about in null is the way it ought to be and the way it was once upon a time.
---
&gt; can you all start undocking
---
Been hearing that about provi for ten years. Then I hear people complain CVA blobs. no idea if it's true today but it's not a new complaint.
---
Death to all cyno bots!
---
How does it slow down escalation? Someone with supers can probably afford to lose a couple recons to quickly move a super fleet
---
At least 6
---
Unless you bring huge bombers fleets you won't kill any cyno. If you are, you're already killing shit, so who cares ?
---
So you're hitting the nullbears and fw bots... when are you going to remove the cancer that is highsec incursions?
---
Obviously, it will have to come from Sansha's side of the equation since no empire wants to make it any *easier* for his forces to access their space. It will probably involve him deciding that it's time to reclaim Esoteria and Paragon Soul, which used to belong to his Nation before the empires burned them.
---
yer, im sure your logistics guys will be pulling their hair out now that their cynos are only up for 60 seconds and dont show on overviews.....
---
"ADAPT OR SURVIVE"
---
And then they bitch when you can adapt
---
You have my downvote lol
---
I miss good old bloody lowsec battleship brawls, where you just get on grid at 0 and beat the shit out of each other until someone limps off grid. Those were the best.
---
Right, but there has to be demand for plex or people don't buy it.
---
This is why new players quit the game. This attitude right here. "Yeah I know you will lose 80% of your assets if you get ganked a single time, but I need to make double or triple your net worth per hour, that 200th billion wont make itself you know"
---
no, actually i haven't (finally just got the skills done though yay)
---
But even, if, I just had the first time this situation with the sun, after 3 yrs taking bridges, so there is a big chance I would have missed that.
---
So what happens when the cyno dies? you jump normally, or you simply get cancelled for the jump?
---
Nevertheless, the cyno would die really fast, causing only a few caps able to jump through. And therefore, more room to fuck something up. Which is like always, what is needed to have corpses in this game
---
who's matterall?
---
AFAIK the origin comes from one of the early nuke tests where they found the sand turned to glass.
---
Listen here you necrotic pus-bag. I've sat through the rhetoric spewing from that abscess you call a brain and now I'm convinced that the fetus died inside you mother and she instead gave birth to a gurgling tumor.
---
"Hang on while i teleport 50 ships just to hang out and dick wave"
---
You have my downvote. This is one of the best changes they could have ever implemented.
---
jesus christ, all goons have to do is have cloaky cynos spread out, and cyno recons ready on a bridging blops, this isn't "good" for them, but it won't absolutely cripple them either
---
Most small groups don’t want capital escalations in the first place. They’ll likely just roam nano gangs and headshot the cynos that come in to save the krabs.
---
5 guys in a 20 or less person fleet is a big hit.  
---
Hunters bring what they need and know what they need. 
---
Defenders use what they have on hand and russle up in the time it takes the attacker to do what they need to do.
---
&gt;If you can keep a Titan within range of enemy ratting systems you already have supercap supeority
---
you really believe that dont you
---
A cloaked ship is a harmless ship.
---
They already did before you posted lol
---
Well, if you bring in an actual fleet, with a few dozen people in t1 ships, they’ll bring a cerb fleet with t2 logi. 
---
But right now they don’t seem to be undocking at all for anything besides that. I used to just fly a Hecate around providence, and there would always be stuff for me to fight or run away from. Since blackout, the only people I’ve been able to fight are not from the area either, and the only Provibloc/HTP/TRC people I’ve seen have been tethered.
---
You land where the cyno was, you can't fail to jump unless the cyno died before you clicked the button.
---
I mean this is a good change and I hope they do more but that definitely doesn't mean they will implement everything in the best or balanced way. Idk why people like you try to discourage discussion about stuff like that lmao. Seems pretty small brain
---
T3Cs already do everything. They don't need to be a better Blops, too.
---
In smaller groups they always did.
---
Some guy who knows The Mittani (which is probably from where he gets the Imperium reactions as well)
---
Yeah, and live in the right timezone and not have a job.
---
Best solution to eve, only allow 1 connection per computer.
---
You can scout and gate yourself. Or you can light a cyno. Both present risks. Welcome to nullsec
---
No, Fuckass. Zulu time is used in cases when people in multiple timezones have to coordinate actions, such as deployment or transport schedules or requisitioning intelligence assets like satellites. Timezone conversion is not something you ever have to think about if you're just doing regular infantry shit in whatever country the brass drops you in, unless you get lucky and can call someone back home once a month. But it is important enough to warrant adding it to a briefing or class to make sure nobody has to waste time when it matters asking what Zulu means or how many hours to add or subtract to get back to Local time.
---
You don't know who he is?  He knows the mittani.
---
Remote shield booster for Recon
---
ccp's actions since the acquisition have been pretty clearly desperate attempts to hit some metrics that exist in the acquisition deal.  it's not a coincidence that at the end of every quarter there's suddenly a LOG IN NOW FOR FANTASTIC REWARDS thing.  they've undoubtedly got some revenue/PCU/etc metrics to get additional payments that they've not been hitting, and have been trying every trick in the book to hit them.  "everyone needs to train up a bunch of t2 skills by next month" in that context is, uh, suspicious
---
If you can’t kill a recon .....
---
People have been using carriers to rat for far longer than supercap and capital umbrellas were an issue. They'll continue to do so now. And if they won't? They'll use bling fit faction bs again instead.
---
The term "fat and lazy" has been used for well over ten years of this game, used to describe groups that stop eating constant war in favor of filling their wallets one way or another. This predates capital and supercapital supremacy.
---
I'm sure a few will unsub, sure, but those people are the ones who provided the game with no content before, and without them the game will not see a change. The ones who stay will continue to provide content, whether as the targets of hunters, wagers of war, or the hunters themselves.
---
&gt; This September we are planning two large changes for Cynosural Fields:
---
&gt;* Cynosural Field Generator I can only be fit by Force Recon Ships and Black Ops Battleships (note: these classes can still fit covert cynos)
---
&gt;* Jump Freighters can jump to Covert Cynosural Fields
---
&gt;During this era of chaos we are eager to introduce new challenges for veteran pilots while working towards a deeper and more balanced capital meta. Historically, cynos have been extremely flexible. They can be used on flocks of alts at nearly no risk or used by the largest and strongest ships in the game. With few options for cyno disruption, capital response time and power has grown to the point that it’s oppressing activity. This change will make it more complex and demanding to get capitals to the field quickly and give more strategic options for those wishing to disrupt capital response.
---
&gt;While most of the impact from this change is on combat, we are sensitive to the effect on Jump Freighters and logistics overall. Jump Freighters will be allowed to use Covert Cynos which can be activated by cheaper hulls like Covert Ops Frigates. This may need further attention and we will be watching this area very closely.
---
&gt;Fly safe o/
---
Marauders "semi-hard" cyno... More like blingy kill for the first caps on field
---
What, you mean like hot pink hello kitty skins?
---
Eve is largely a zero sum game.  Anything that hurts goons less than other groups is good in relative terms.  Absolute terms don't matter.
---
Don't forget that Blops can bridge. You actually do not need that many bombers to kill a carrier. Carriers also do not really apply to them, you just have to bring 2-3 more people. They also escape a counter easier, cost less if they die, can warp cloaked and while they are at it also bomb excavators or the resists and active tank away. That is the main issue of Blops, not that they are per se bad ships, they are just outclassed by every other covert ship when it comes to ganking targets.
---
This is also a nerf to caps carrying cynos. Because now cynos can be killed.
---
You realise you are shittalking to someone who actually knows their capital fighting right? And is apart of a LS group that actually kills stuff in Delve. With caps.
---
Flairbaited friend
---
They should still allow cynos on rookie ships for logistics reasons
---
He is sure delivering on doing things wrong, got that part down.
---
Sure, but I would posit that if you counter drop a dread that dread will likely just murder the arazu with it's anticap guns before it dies, since it will be a completely stationary target.
---
i mean, i'm glad i don't own caps.
---
but honestly if i did - i'd probably unsub my cap pilots than train my cyno alts in to recons.
---
but maybe that's my bias of never owning or having any interest in caps to begin with.
---
I'm rather amused with how people are crying that this will make freightering harder.
---
I used to use JF's for years before I stopped. Having to wait 10 mins for cynos to come down, and them always dying, and needing to make sure I had enough ozone.  It was a pain in the arse.
---
I'm actually going to move my JF from the north to use it again.  This is going to make it so fucking easy.
---
adapt or die was the old phrase that got lost in the stagnation of eve some time ago. Maybe its coming back now
---
Hunters can adapt.
---
&gt; the goal is to help small groups and hurt large.
---
This is literally, absolutely, completely impossible to do (short of instancing shit), and CCP knows it. Stop trying to make it seem as if that is the goal, because it isn't.
---
The first point I guess I was thinking purely from a capital escalation standpoint and not just a straight up dropping caps stand point.
---
2nd point I don't think limiting the hulls that can fit a cyno is a bad thing, it forces you to think about if it's actually worth dropping caps. Are you doing it for strategic value or is it just because you can do it and it will heavily tip the balance of the fight in your direction? Capitals have dominated the game for a few years now and raising the price to use them could create a healthier environment for anyone not under a big block. It will make the game more difficult in some ways and easier in others but people always figure it out. There are a lot of smart people out there who will have an answer for this. Meta changes are always fun as well.
---
It'll be an interesting dynamic to see play out but I seriously doubt that, with the help of some damps, I'll be unable to kill the recon.
---
People will still krab because well, they are krabs
---
Now here is a man who gets it.
---
I can’t wait for this cyno change.
---
[Malcanis' Law](https://web.archive.org/web/20121216035818/https://outofcake.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/malcanis-law/) will be obeyed.
---
Goons will have Enough Recons and enough people to fly them. Groups that were marginal caps users will have a tough time.
---
Lol.
---
The Bastards, back in the Flashfresh / theHermit days. Loved the silly low sec piracy, the drunk roams, making people sing a song on teamspeak for a ransom because they had no ISK. Good times.
---
Early on in EvE I had a ton of fun in VIRII with people that became RL friends. 
---
Currently I am in WiNGSPAN, and have a ton of fun. 
---
The Corp really fits my play mostly solo play style. 
---
No rules, no blues, no requirements, no CTA’s. 
---
Just play whatever style fits you and have fun doing it. 
---
I currently have 2 new babies and hardly have time to play.  
---
Not a single peep about needing to play more or anything like that. 
---
Just fun times and chat when I do get the few minutes a day to sit down in front of my PC.
---
So you light a cyno, 10-15s later first caps load. They now align for like 25s. Enough time for your 2 sabres to make a coffee, do a bio, warp over and bubble the caps.
---
"i don't have to outrun the bear, i just have to outrun the other guy"
---
Cyno and local still existed during that "long ago time" you speak of.
---
I know the goal people hope for is = Dank Frags.... with their kitty T3Cs and Bombers.... but I am afraid the end result will be High Sec being the #1 source of Isk income for players from now on..... with null being pointless.
---
this is almost better than reading this shit from idiots in game after an unfortunate event has occurred
---
Looool you got 6 rorq alts and pay for subs.
---
The funnies and dump thing i heared in a while
---
 Large Collidable Object
---
Plenty of large capital fights have happened, in this first on grid wins, no counter play available.
---
why
---
What you didn't see was the cloakies that didn't decloak :P The astero i believe was a neut..? Though its possible one of the guys brought one.
---
No, you're not, you are cherry picking is what you're doing, each of those has different situations behind them like some of those being frankly shitfits.  These are also spread out over a long period of time, IE not nearly enough supers dying in a decent time frame that is healthy for the game.  Once more I am correct.
---
You think moving stuff in freighters down nullsec is way to easy? Apparently you have also never done it.
---
His asshole
---
because cynos shouldn't be just a cheap thing to throw around? idk.
---
We have nowhere near enough guys for that. Killed a nyx the other day with 3 guys, how can we do that now? Sure let's all triple box dps ships with a couple logi and take five times longer to kill the retard.
---
This dudes just pissed because he is no long safe ratting
---
Yes. Which is good.
---
Big groups can deal with anything easier than smaller ones. You can't nerf organization and cooperation. The idea is to make it harder for people playing on the "endgame" content (IE: you, jumping your carrier around). 
---
This has nothing to do with groups of players and helping "the small guys".
---
And before it was whoever brings one more wins, no counter play available.
---
I guess that should have been obvious, given how badly cva is dealing with the blackout
---
You realize you just said the stuff I explicitly called out as uninteresting and totally ignored the part of the question that says what I *am* interested in?
---
Thank you for your contribution to the discussion.
---
And now they are going to continue dwindling due to massive changes that only support pvp carebears who want easy kills.
---
We can crank out the bpcs and t1 hulls all day... It's just everything else that's a pain in the ass.
---
Sounds like your corp has a hard time adapting
---
and nothing to the safest way for isk —— selling plex
---
depends on your ammo and tech of artys
---
Ruptures have a special place in my heart after spending so much time in sniping duels with them. I miss 2013 sometimes.
---
yeah it really shows /s
---
One of the tgbois brought a scramweb astero. I guess nobody handed him a slasher fast enough! :P
---
or because he has a bunch of alts that are now useless at the thing he trained them for and has to spend weeks or a good chunk of isk making them do what they did originally.
---
The game without those folks might not be sustainable. Just a thought.
---

SOMEONE please make a video thing out of this!
---
Will some people have a recon on standby whenever ratting with their carrier? absolutely. But most people won't. So best case the cyno recon has to warp in from system somewhere which delays the fax coming through to buy the carrier more time. If the recon has to burn to a system thats even more time for the attackers.
---
If your hunting group has on avg a minute or two of unanswered aggression how much shit would you be able to kill in that time?
---
Who's the Mitanni?
---
Changes to existing things are always easier than addition of new things/mechanics. Note, I’m not disagreeing with your core point that more counterplay might be desirable over nerfs, but commenting that this is always the way a first treatment is implemented. It can’t be said that the overall direction is bad :)
---
Marauders should be able to use HAW dread weapons, similar to how some battlecruisers can use Large weapons.
---
Well when its being slathered on so quickly, you expect otherwise?
---
Be all "adapt or die" if you like, but that's no how it works for most people.

The Pearl Abyss hooch is stronk at CCP headquarters right now

Small alliance member with a JF here.
---
I'm actually going to get my JF out of retirement now that it can use covert cynos.  Or will when I finish training another character for it.  My old JF pilot is sitting in a super now.

You cannot really damp a fax jumping at 0 tho, but I get your point.
---

---
It is going to make import/export from null a lot more expensive, since the sacrificial cyno is a 30m covops rather than a noobship. The cost per m3 would likely double or more for people who live in farther regions.
---
I sincerely do not know what to think of this change as to whether it is good or bad.  huh.
---
It's a couple weeks worth of inconvenience. If you are playing at these levels, why are you bitching about those training times?
---
If anyone has the recon hulls sitting around to nullify the impact of this its them...
---
I don’t see a USD conversion
---
I'm prepared to use T2, if that helps.
---
Can't shoot things while cloaked
---
You asked how heat damage works, that's what I answered. You aren't going to get a more stupid proof explanation.
---
u realy r beyond words you have basicly spat in the face of every1 who played this game and moved to nul repetedly since this bs chaos ere came arround and r sucking the cock of any1 who joins bombers bar well congratz if the blackout and rorq nerfs didnt make peopleunsub this stupid □□□□ well RIP eve and i cant wait till ur all out of a job
---
Just throwing shit at the wall i was easily able to come up with a pilgrim fit that has 130k hp, with no implants it runs about 600m.
---
Dropping a carrier group will be just fine.
---
???? Is CCP doing some T20 scandal again ????
---
Open questions to CCP.  There are still Force Recons BPOs around in EVE. In which hands are they now?
---
Is it the case, that they are all in the hands on some NC. or PL. bittervets who will now have unlimited isks due to helplessly favoring a T2 ship?  Does that remind someone else on old BOB scandal days?
---
ok grath
---
I still think all incursion constellations should have a unique wormhole to Stain for the duration of the incursion (maybe even an especially short-duration one like 4-8 hours that randomly moves around the const, I dunno).
---
I dont disagree with the cloaking thing. Thats a good change. Not that were gonna see it, I officially just lost hope for the game.
---
This change my have negative ramifications for other play styles in the game which I do not fully understand however this change includes stripping rorquals and caps of their cyno's and this is a good change. For the longest time I thought it was completely unfair.
---
We don’t want them k thanks
---
I disagree.
---
I would say if you buy skill injectors because of this change that means you are supporting the change.
---
Can I call you an idiot too btw? I feel that I'm missing out on some lingo here
---
Sure it can. Anything that renders useless literally tens of thousands of existing characters as an arbitrary event where CCP just tries to fuck with people WILL reduce playerbase and game health. A bunch of people quitting makes the game worse. Finding literally the most obnoxious way to go about getting rid of subs is all they've done here, and AGAIN, it won't have any of the desired effect on the largest player groups
---
\*shuffles feet\*
---
i didn do eett
---
&gt;  All this changes is that it ups the necessary amount of alts needed to super rat to 3.
---
Which leaves a lot of room for error, and extends the time the hunters have before the response arrives. 
---
Besides, a recon cyno can be alpha'd out and are a worthwhile kill (more so than any current normal cyno alt).
---
Contact their customer service and ask for a refund. Also tell them why you are asking for a refund.
---
first of all.. what consultation? Why would they need to consult anyone? You're clearly refering to the lobbyists of your coalition. Well, you kinda don't want to ask heavily biased people, right?  
---
Also, ever considered that using capitals should be a rare occassion in warfare? Just use subcaps and go to places by gates, it's not that hard.. you even still have the ridiculous OP (and hopefully soon to be nerfed too) jumpgate network
---
I was going to guess somewhere in the high 200k, low 300k before implants/fleet boosts, with T2 fittings.
---
The JF needs time to get back to jump cap.
---
Honestly when OP said noobie in ratting carrier I zoned the f out
---
JF logistics should be harder than it is today, that's a good change too
---
Third cyno seems like it would be the easiest way to deal with this. Lets them do what they want to do with combat cynos, and leaves JF out of it.
---
As a member of a small group these changes have been nothing but positive to us. We have been getting kills all day every day and our Corp has probably not been this healthy in 3 years. This is because the changes reward active players with coordination and skill. 
---
There is so much talk of the small groups and how hurt they are but when I look around I see those groups doing well inside their niche. 
---
And the attitude is not grrr goons but just satisfaction at seeing the game trend away from the course of becoming more safe that it has been on for years now.
---
Have you ever set up a cyno chain for jfing? Now imagine needing 3 months of training on each alt to do the same thing. For what reason?
---
I uh, use them as faxes and heavy tackle for supers. Rorquals make 100m/hr on normal ore, 600m/hr would take 56.67 hours of mining per month to plex all of them. Please stop talking.
---
This is the rorqual nerf that we needed.  Anything you do to nerf the ship will hurt the little guys more than the big guys... the problem is the playstyle around it.  Lighting cyno when an inhib goes up and having it burn for 7 minutes on a PANIC'd ship is a broken mechanic.  Now, you have to keep your cyno alive while the fleet forms or do better killing inhibs, which is impossible against some fleetcomps and enough numbers.  This is a direct hit to the umbrella mechanic itself... yall can go undo those other rorq nerfs now lol
---
Is this the real big miker
---
Fake news. Fuck you nerd. You're just salty that your carrier ratting is getting its virgin asshole fisted.
---
That one may be a bridge too far...
---
Good.
---
This will create stagnation on a whole new level.
---
I think the proposed changes are great! I think that giving marauders some kind of mobile cyno inhib effect would be p fucking boss
---
True beauty has been achieved. 
---
I am trying to replicate this goddamn bug because I want a screen grab like this &gt;:c
---
Yeah, that would have been a better solution. "Freight Cyno" fittable on industrials and mining frigs.
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
Imagine not living in highsec/wormholes in years 2019.
---
and its gone.
---
Good Times :(
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/5iqeTZ2.png](https://i.imgur.com/5iqeTZ2.png)
---
Yeah, I kind of feel dumb, it was posted less than a day ago.
---
So hypothetically, could you boosh them back to sender even if they keep their trajectory/velocity?
---
Good
---
The problem is that they are 100% balanced around this concept. It would be cool if you could use a BLOPs outside of this scenario occasionally. It's just so narrow, much more narrow than most other specialized ships.
---
Combined with blackout, and deep safes? JFs are going to be interesting.
---
(your logi may with to consider, though a longer train, prospects are cheaper materials wise, than the other covert cyno capable ships)
---
It's still the safest you can be out in space. Untouchable even, and that's all I'm referring to.
---
Exactly that's a beautiful way to put it.
---
Looks like a wasp allergy.
---
I don't understand why they gave BLOPS the "no decloak lock penalty" bonus while they also get the scan rez penalty of cloaking devices. Bombers have no decloak penalty, but also get covops cloaks that have 0 scanrez penalty.
---
Clone vat bay with a CovCyno Prospect in my Maintenance Bay. Light Covert Cyno, jump in Widow. Light regular cyno on Widow, jump in Minokawa. WHAT IS SO HARD ABOUT ALL OF THAT?!
---
They can push alright buffer, 300k, maybe a bit more. They can active tank insane amounts. A full tank golem can tank 20k dps.
---
BLOps actually have much higher scan rez than other battleships... they just lose all that extra scan rez to the cloaking device. Welp.
---
"newbeans"
---
"capital"
---
???
---
So these changes aren't only benifiting pvp hunters at the expense of anyone else. Also why is chaos only in nullsec, where's the lowsec chaos or wormhole chaos?
---
130k hp on a pilgrim without even trying, the dread wont be able to kill that before the death of it comes in.
---
At this rate you can add some 0's
---
Huh, so it does exist, Ill have to put an exception for corp owned banks then.
---
Your username gives away your motive -- concern trolling about "safe" cloaks in order to really make mining/krabbing safer.
---
Not true, torpedoes will still apply poorly to a small target at 0 m/s
---
All I can say to that is.. the best ship in eve is friendship
---
&gt; I'm trying to understand the various heat capacity, heat attenuation, and heat dissapation numbers on hulls, and the heat damage and heat absorption rate numbers on modules. Is there a writeup on this anywhere?
---
*That* is what I asked. After saying what I *don't* need an explanation about because I'm not totally clueless, and have Reading Comprehension trained beyond I, a course you might consider pursuing yourself. Since you evidently did not have the stamina to read the post until you got to the part with the actual question.
---
Go ahead and have the last word in this thread if you feel you must.
---
I very much liked the phoebe jump changes as they fixed alot of issues but to be fair it did severely hurt and significantly lesson the amount of capital engagements that occurred.  I am concerned this change will cause a similiar thing to happen but....then again I dont know right now...hrm im gonna have to think on this.
---
So you can't?
---
Potentially, it would be pretty tricky though.
---
Since bombs don't travel as far as the boosh. If you timed it well and the enemy didn't move you might be able to boosh the bombs while they are slightly behind you and end up behind the enemy. The bombs might be able to travel far enough to get them from behind.
---
And you think first person there is better? Because before even with larger fleets fights happened, with this change there is no way to engage them.
---
I've even more untouchable while docked, what's your point?
---
&gt; Pain to set up - anchoring moving and ESPECIALLY taking down modules was/is shit
---
It cannot be overstated how horrible that could become. My highlight was when we needed a GM to blow up all the modules and reimburse everything in it because every anchored part had bugged out. But even when it worked it was several hours of the most boring busywork.
---
&gt;  but design wise it looks to me like the POS es were a better feature. What am I missing? Am i missing anything ?
---
POS defense was a mess. They were impossible to attack with a small group (unless you exploited them, esp their autotargeting) if setup correctly. While it did literally nothing against big enough groups or enough supers.
---
CCP added the damage cap (which many people dislike) because without it some groups could just reinforce an entire region within a few hours. And completely grind several regions down within one long weekend.
---
And if you are talking about the actual POS for sov control era it was a horrible spam (like citadels now) that could make hours of grinding useless because someone managed to hit the anchor button faster.
---
Less bots. And with less bots, player retention and activity would be a lot higher. So in reality, more players.
---
so you better have the citadel in the system ... so at this point again why risk 10bil hull + cargo rather than sacrifice a single bomber
---
Definitely an impossible barrier to entry for someone flying an 8bil+ ship that already demands cyno alts. Not like this could be worked past with coordination with other pilots in a logistics group. 
---
Sucks that there's no positive trade off like not broadcasting your location to the entire system with a warpable entity. 
---
Yep, RIP.
---
It's an idea I threw at CCP after the CSM heard the news this was coming. Mostly so there's a tankier cyno platform. 
---
To be clear, my general reaction to this is wtf. Just looking for mitigations which I might slip in.
---
This sounds like complete shit for bringing capitals onto any grid that already has ships on it.  force recon?  ya thats an insta blap by 2 sets of LR fighters.
---
maybe those groups should focus on manufacturing/industry and build locally rather then just JF everything in from highsec?
---
Maybe nullsec could actually be player run empires working locally with allies to actually build something?
---
Maybe those sort of costs should be absorbed for the good of the game?
---
&gt;since the sacrificial cyno is a 30m covops rather than a noobship.
---
Maybe this is what is fucking cancer?  The fact that rather then actually be vulnerable and create content, you just want to suicide a noob ship and get off scot free.
---
Welcome to eve.
---
Echo chamber so strong, you'd think they weren't real posters... but bots.
---
Well that means you have to swap your ship, with the risk of it being stolen. Or am I totally mistaken here?
---
What i am saying since the beginning ?       
---
Bombers will die as this is safest and most economical thing to do.
---
Camped to death at the region gates.
---
This helps so many different groups all over new eden.
---
What do you think is bad about lowsec/wh space that you would like to change? I think they are relatively balanced, albeit could use some tweaks. 
---
Outside of a major FW revamp which we all know is fucked up.
---
just a question from a begginer gas huffer. how far from jita/amarr do you look for your holes? yesterday I jumped into one that was like 5 jumps from amarr to get some gas and I got scanned and killed buy 3 T2 ships that even used a bubble on my venture :D was I really unlucky or do I need to find more remote hs system?
---
I mean that's about 20 seconds, and that's discounting the effects of volley. If you're getting counter dropped by Titans you'll probably die quick enough, but hostile dreads probably won't kill in time unless it's a massive number.
---
Wait for goons to do a burn jita jump in on that. If you want highsec kills take a max dps catalyst to a 0.5 and gank the softer mining barges
---
You think they wont have an arazu or two on overwatch when the rorqs are grazing?  This affects everyone, but it only explicitly fucks everyone that isn't in a mega coalition.
---
Nobody is that stupid, super ratting is very much at keyboard. Heck, it could even be that the FAX and recon warp between sites with the super, with the Fax pre-locking the recon and just going triage+reps the moment a sizable enemy force decloaks.
---
Be careful lumping JFs and caps into the same mold here.  For JFs, this means you have to train a couple weeks on all your cyno toons... boo fucking hoo.  For caps, though, it will make it a lot riskier to sling a few carriers around killing lowsec content.  Call me triggered but personally if you're a small group using caps in lowsec you're probably denying more content than you're giving.
---
Suitonia dear, you ever heard of how tedious logistic is ? Why would you make it even more tedious, having to actually have people watch your cyno everytime you jump, then wait for them to go the next desto ?
---
Thousands of existing characters that might have to train a bit longer to facilitate mobility of the largest combat assets in the game. I’d expect that only the richer players who have extensive personal cyno chains will have to concern themselves. This might even drive moving capital assets to become a collaborative process again, that requires human interaction and trust. Hearkens back to escort fleets for hauling runs down the pipe, or standing camps to defend pockets for mining fleets.
---
With these changes stop bubbling and inhibs combined actually allow meaningful levels of grid control, pretty sure people formerly unassailable under umbrella will start to bleed a bit. The smaller guys were already, so not much changes there.
---
Your argument is on player base numbers, but anything that weakens the advantage a 13 account bittervet who can fly everything has against the &lt;12 month player makes the game more, not less attractive to a new player concerned about always being behind. Realistically the account numbers might change, but if anything I’d expect it to be a positive change for living, breathing human numbers.
---
Have you heard about Jump Fatigue?
---
Do capitals not have warp drives? 
---
You're talking about the most powerful ships in the game; if you can field a large fleet of them, you should be able to field support to clear bubbles and tackle and allow them to warp to the field. Not at optimal? Tough shit. 
---
The last fucking thing the game needs is more of the same cyno at zero tidi who presses F1 the most times wins blobby bullshit. At least if you make people have to use literally the *bare* minimum effort, you can spice things up.
---
How about making different "cyno sizes". Like only "dedicated cyno ships" can open up cynos for capitals. All the other ships can only fit cynos for subcapitals.
---
Force recon and blops BS are the only ships which can light regular cynos.
---
JF can jump to covert cyno.
---
because that has never happened before with a whole plethora of changes over the years. ever.
---
Yep suggested this as alternative
---
Good luck catching an astero
---
Oh I highly agree! These new changes are like getting promoted mid presentation because your boss just fell down dead. Sure, it's nice to have all eyes on you. But you probably aren't ready quite yet. If BLOPS are going to have a wider role in PVP, then they'll need a bit more utility or resists before I send a \~4b fitted ship into certain death.
---
That was my point, midding in random systems in a JF is dumb and they weren't balanced around it. So what it turns to is always jump to a cit, then lose a covops frig every time you make a jumo.
---
Yea it really highlights how retarded olmeca is
---
you can still be bombed/ smartbombed/ aoe DD'd while cloaked. it doesnt stop your ship from taking damage, it just hides it so noone can see and target you
---
Totally agree, I will be holding off from using my JF until some kind of a meta is figured out for this change. God help anyone trying to move stuff out of the heavily camped losses asset safety catchment stations now!
---
What's the matter with this? Looks normal
---
Okay?
---
Sure, you could say that every super just groups together in a fleet and runs sites together. Lots of silly arguments you could make to counter this.
---
Yes a super pilot can literally run sites with a fax sitting next to him.  Sure.
---
Next chaos era notification: no refunds
---
&gt; With that I meant you're in some ratting pocket with your carrier, just as an example. It's not terribly far to staging but you're not gating.
---
Why not gate? If you're ratting in a myrm or rattlesnake or whatever you'd gate it back. If you want instant teleportation it's reasonable for that to be expensive and skill intensive.
---
Unless you gave away your stuff, you didn't really leave.
---
What do u think bl is? We dont use carriers, fax, or combat titans.  We use dreads, gank supers with no fax, and hyper rags.  We are not the problem with capital projection.
---
The Bl you refer to is just Origin corp. we form anywhere between 20-50 human beings in fleet depending on the day/importance.   And as someone who actively FCs small gang fleets vs the super cap blob of legacy/test, i can assure you this change hurts us too, mainly in using expendable cynos to jump titans behind enemy lines.
---
And that oppressive carrier gang ur talking about will still have an alt in a force recon to jump them in. All this did was make it even harder for you to respond to it.
---
I can imagine working on that eve server emulator that has been around for ages has to be an absolute nightmare when not even CCP knows what the fuck is going on in core parts of their codebase.
---
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!!!
---
Except... it's literally cheaper for me to just SRP their losses than it is to ask multiple high-yield earners to stop earning so a few low-yield earners can rat.
---
It's not an attitude.  It's math.
---
Yeah, only the people half-assing cyno alts are complaining about having to train them fo a while.
---
This guy is gonna go and buy something like EA NFL 20 golden pack, I kid you not.
---
no that is what the clone bay is for. 
---
what is so hard is that he used 4 accounts (rorq, prospect, widow, mino) when before he needed two.
---
"we only spread the capital cancer a little bit"
---
The funny thing is Hilmar is arrogant enough to think that the goodwill people have towards this game is neverending. Do one too many wrong things and there goes your game.
---
Ban MWD?
---
"A bit more training"
---
From scratch currently, assuming 25k sp a day, on under 5 mil sp chars:
---
Cyno frigate: 20 days - 9 days to get cyno skill , 11 days for cyno training (cyno 4) 1.4 mil for cyno field, rookie ship is fine, 500k sp, injector cost 1 injector of 800 mil
---
Cyno inty: 72 days (just my skill plan) - 20 mil ship, 1.4 mil for cyno, 1.8m sp, injector cost 4 injector of 3.2 bil
---
Future state:
---
Force recon: 140 days - 120 days to sit, 20 days to cyno 4 (optional honestly) 200 mil each for ship, 1.4 mil for cyno field, 3.5m sp, injector cost 7 injector of 5.6 bil
---
Blops: 254 days - 234 days to sit, 20 days to cyno 4, 900 mil each for ship, 1.4 mil for cyno field, 6.3m sp, injector cost &gt;14 injector of 11.2 bil
---
For moving of JF:
---
Transport ships 129 days - 59 days to sit, 70 days for cyno 5, 140 mil a ship, 3 mil for covert field gen, 3.2 mil sp, 7 injector of 5.6 bil
---
bomber - 116 days - 46 days to sit, 70 days for cyno 5m 34 mil for each ship, 3 mil for covert field gen, 2.9 mil sp, 6 injector of 4.8
---
Prospect - 128 days - 58 days to sit, 70 days for cyno 5, 30 mil for each ship, 3 mil for covert field gen, 3.2 mil sp, 7 injector for 5.6 bil
---
Oh, another year passed by... the next one has this idea ;)
---
Well, now you'll be able to see if they have a cyno capable ship and primary it if they uncloak one, so it's significantly less likely that they'll drop caps on you.
---
Because USD is a useless currency
---
A small bit too torturous for me, especially as a hauler for a hauling corporation. A civilian cyno would be great for solely JFs, can’t see the harm in a module like that.
---
Interesting point. I think our people are already set up for covops because double-duty as BLOPs support.
---
It is noteworthy how the part about JFs getting to use covert cynos is getting totally drowned in the oceans of tears about needing recons to light regular cynos.
---
Do you know how resource distribution works?
---
In the context of someone wanting to move capital assets around at liberty, I hardly see an issue. If everyone in an alliance capital group commits to doing one and placing it somewhere, will be done in no time/isk at all.
---
Unparalleled safety that is untouched during an era of supposed chaos. You can be camped if you dock, can't if your out at a bookmark cloaked. So no, it's safer to be out in space cloaked than docked in station, unless we are talking citadels.
---
Sometimes random people warp in one at a time too. That's my favorite response please do that more often
---
Interesting change but not allowing a T1 to be a cyno ship is going a bit far. 
---
Maybe allow them on a T1 cruiser as well. It'll die quickly to a fleet but it would give more people the ability to move stuff. If the issue is wanting a cyno ship to cost, let them mount on a BS. 
---
Caps are mostly T-1 ships, the Cyno is T-1 but no T-1 ship can fit one in the new meta. That's weird.
---
One strategy would be to use a CovOps to go past ennemy lines. Covert cyno to bring in the Force Recon that then uses its regular cyno to bring in the rest of the fleet.
---
seems like a lot of people forget that there has been no announced changes to the cyno beacon generator structures. while the umbrella cant jump directly to the tackled ship, they can jump to the beacon in system and then warp in. or just bridge in a recon to the system and have that warp to the tackled ship and light a normal cyno. umbrellas will still work just fine, they just need some extra steps to make it work.
---
More Money for CCP I guess.
---
What about keeping your Mino alt in the same system? So you just warp to your Rorq?
---
Yes it is possible to get stuck in Bubbles, but that's what save pings are for.
---
Alliance logistics getting broken is not something you want to celebrate.
---
Your entire post boiled down to "large, organized groups are more powerful than small, unorganized groups."
---
All sorts of shocking
---
I also have over 13.5b on grid across 4 omega accounts after all is said and done! EZ MODE
---
I agree, this will make it way way way to easy for the first party on a grid to control it.  this will force far earlier form ups (and likely a lot of extra gating).
---
at a minimum, dicters need to be aggressed if they drop a bubble so that you still have the option of gating a fleet.  going to drive "i own the Ihub, so cynojammer/beacon" to make it nearly impossible to conduct campaigns if sizes are at all even.
---
chaos?  only for ratters.  shits on actual wars.
---
What, recruit a shitload of people and become the blob we hate?
---
designers generate money by selling skins, they don't come at the cost of devs/other employees, they probably pay for more devs etc as they are a revenue stream
---
Risk is good right? Remove asset safety and NPC stations. Let's have some more risk aye?
---
experimenting with removing cynos from caps themselves has it's merit. I'm not too sure with their choice of candles yet.      
---
I think a restriction between cruiser and BS would have been a compromise.
---
&gt; So no, it's safer to be out in space cloaked than docked in station, unless we are talking citadels.
---
Why wouldn't we be talking about citadels?
---
Ded Gaem.
---
God forbid any risk is introduced to being cloaked. It's more powerful than the panic mod after all. 
---
But who am I kidding, PVP only players are the only players and playstyles that matter.
---
going to ruin offensive fights too.  good luck getting dreads onto a grid.
---
Well, it's your fault really for trying to be edgy.
---
I know of corps that rely on Black frog for their logistics. Black frog rates are going to go through the roof after this.
---
And thus, the last use of the rookie ship died.
---
I also thought that a fun mechanic for mauraders might be to remove the scram stopping the MJD but when you activate the MJD it gives you 30 seconds of warp disruption.
---
Then you can ping around, but not just immediately warp out.
---
I feel like this is a poor change, largely because Force Recon and Blops BS have very limited staying power on field. Sure hope that we get a nice balance pass for Blops BS at least that makes them beefy enough to take some hits while pulling Cyno duty.  
---
Seriously just restrict Cyno usage on Capitals and Super Capitals....done.
---
and i'm sure nobody has never thought "i'll just spend more time and energy to do what i did before instead of just going and finding something better to do with my time".
---
a lot of the places/things i never go to/do any more are because of this - and i'm not talking about eve, i'm talking about irl. when you have to put more time/energy/investment in to doing something you were already doing without any extra reward it's hard to justify the continuation of it.
---
You live in a WH right?
---
It was a while ago, but I had an arty thrasher fit I used to gank auto-pilot ships on gates.  Noob ships and shuttles have no tank so I could one shot them and then get the pod before gate guns or concord would get me.  Plus you can grab any pods going past that you want.  All it takes is one nice set of implants and you stay KB green for a while.
---
WHs....
---
Yes, your point?
---
(frozone)
---
HONEY
---
WHERE IS MY ARAZU
---
&gt; Go ahead and have the last word in this thread if you feel you must.
---
"No u"
---
You know what, you might actually be right about all of that. I can't find any actual problems with your logic. I still think buffing inhibs and adding a new module to make blops relevant would have been a better way to accomplish it though.
---
&gt;"Help, i'm a poor null sec corp and we can't afford to lose a 500m cyno ship..."
---
As `the little guy`, and not even in nullsec, I would quite often move my carrier 5+ jumps a week to chase around targets of interest. Sorry but spending 2,5b to move to your next target in the hopes of getting ~1b of loot . . . Doesn't add up.
---
&gt; CCP just solve all the rorq, titans and ratting capital ship proliferation
---
Possibly. They may also have solved whaling fleet proliferation.
---
Whyyu do you need to know??
---
Cyno is one minute now. If anything less tedious.
---
Also covert cyno doesn't show on everybody's overview.
---
Jf's neen to train cyno V, but largely jf's will be fine.
---
&gt; apt or die was the old phrase that got lost in the stagnation of eve some time ago. Maybe its coming back no
---
I sure hope so. Now for stabs and asset safety. :)
---
Yes. If I ever get killed by a ship that has bunny ears I'll quit
---
My Corp base is over in 0.5 sec, and I've been finding wormholes all over. I'm on mobile but we are somewhere around Hek
---
Damn I'd resub all of my accounts but they're already subbed
---
If they are in their hands they don’t login anyway so what’s the problem?
---
i agree.  this makes super umbrellas far far more potent in fleet fights in their own space.  Fucks any offensive action.
---
Funny, my group roams provi often anough, and there's always someone willing to fight.
---
Expensive to own a capital ship? The horror
---
Are you chillin with Dscan up while you harvest?
---
Right now there are heavily tanks ships sitting on keepstars keeping a permacyno up in important systems.
---
After the change they will be replaced by brick blops with an apostle on triage standby.
---
This is the toughest part of this change. This video is obsolete. I &lt;3 robo
---
nope.  death of any offensive gameplay.  good luck killing a citadel with 500 capitals parked on it and the inability to bring in your own capital fleet.
---
Isn't that a good thing for small med sized groups.
---
Wait, what?
---
Sounds like Eve
---
My actual problem I suppose is that this is a temporary roadblock at best. It'll take two months for everyone who gives a shit to train new cyno alts and the meta will stay exactly the same. CCP had a huge opportunity to introduce something fundamentally new to address capital spam, and this ain't it.
---
So what exactly have you been training your cyno alts in?
---
"This doesn't really hurt us very much."
---
- Me, a small alliance CEO, multi-capital and multi-JF pilot, to my members
---
i dont kjnow much about artys but get your skills up if you can
---
You might have enough tank for two volleys on a gate. If you want to catch them in an anom, fit a web (tracking isn’t great) or just use a catalyst. 
---
You can also use them to pop autopiloting pods outside trade hubs.
---
Bug?
---
Until it decloaks ontop of you.
---
This comes across to me as a quick first pass prior to a big mechanical rework, so I’m hopeful that once they get the data back from this change, they’ll move on to addition instead subtraction.
---
Jump fuel would already be more than 30mil.
---
Cov cyno being only 60s and not showing on everybody's overview actually makes this a good change.
---
So, this is targeted directly at big null block umbrellas, right? #MakeRattingAndMiningDangerousAgain
---
Tribute says hi. Half of Vale says hi. NPC null says hi. Most of null actually says hi.
---
That must be why he uses the kitty avatar; the adorable face is a sharp contrast to the harsh words in the same way his youthful voice contrasts with the ability to run a major alliance. Nidia clearly has an excellent sense of irony.
---
A 2b+ t1 resist tanked cyno.  The only cyno I've ever lit was in an Aug navy.  It had 150k ehp and died in a fire shortly thereafter.  It did its job though, and for only 60m.  Think you'd warp a recon or bob forbid a blood into a bubble with an enemy fleet and light?
---
I agree it's funny to hear null Bloc members say things like "ya but think of the little guy, small groups are dead now!" But it's also equally funny to me how many people assume that every person that lives in a nullsec alliance/Corp hates the blackout/changes.... 
---
I can't speak for alliance/coalition leadership ... But a large portion of people I play with day to day in null love the new changes and have enjoyed the spike in free defensive content, and the ability to go fights/kills (either via WH or gates/JBs) easier then before.
---
The optional role of bridging should not make it a bridge specialist by nerfing combat abilities. BLOPs should fit the role of assassin ships when combat fit, which it is doing quite inadequately.
---
The two main points I seem to be seeing about the 'small group growth' are combat escalation and logistics.
---
Regarding escalation, the small groups aren't going to be doing that unless they're blue to the nearest superpower cyno changes or not. As of now the 2 main ways for escalation are lighting a cyno on the ship that's being attacked or lightning a cyno out of inhib range in a ceptor. Post change you can still light a cyno out of inhib range in a force recon so there wont be much change.
---
Logistics is a bit more of a shitty situation but at the same time anyone who can afford a jf can afford to use bombers/prospects/cov-ops as cynos regardless of how big the alliance is especially since most non-alliance infrastructure is typically moved privately whether that be for stocking 1DQ or babies first null hub, so the size of the group doesn't really matter in that context.
---
Bottom line is that cynos are a problem and is this change the best way to deal with that? Maybe, but I can tell you is that you aren't gonna find a nerf that disproportionately hurts the empires while leaving the 'little guy' unscathed simply because the human element combined with 3-4 years of vast quantities of isk and mineral faucets have cemented the nullblock's place in this game giving them all the resources in the world to exploit any potential 'little guy' loophole.
---
I challenge you to come up with a nerf that helps the little guy because the only realistic alternative change I've seen proposed are cyno spoolup times and I'd argue that spooling would actually significantly hurt small groups more as logistics cynos will just be sitting ducks until the cyno is fully on so you'd just have to pray that no one notices your cyno before you can jump, when with these proposed changes you can jump instantly and your cyno doesn't show up on the overview and only locks your ship down for 60 seconds. But the again with spoolups you'd just have to actually defend your logistics cyno with a few pvp toons until it goes online, and I have a feeling that the 'small guy' would be way more willing to do that then any block linemembers.
---
How is it not amazing for jfs? If it’s because you have to train cyno v then deal with it. This makes it ezpz to move jfs
---
Fair point on the new vs veteran player thing. I could have sworn that they also mentioned wanting to swing things more in favor of smaller groups and smaller gang fighting but I may be conflating ccpfalcons comments with the interview.
---
However saying that it is impossible to make changes that hurt large groups but hurt smaller groups less is disingenuous. Restricting cynos on capital ships hurts large groups that rat with them and drop large fleets in an engagement. It hurts smaller groups less as they are much less likely to rat in capitals and an escalation might be 5 capitals getting thru on one cyno instead of 100.
---
The change as is though is overall disproportionately more impactful on smaller groups.
---
Thing is, they aren't. Most successful capital umbrellas are dependent on subcaps to lock down the attacking party. Without fast tackle ready to go, all you are going to accomplish with caps is maybe driving the enemy off, and only if they are unprepared.
---
ya, i think i might be done with EvE or drop down to a single account.  no reason to put up with this shit.  i dont feel like sitting in fleet for 6 hours so we can get the tactical advantage on a grid.  with jammers it was already aids.  its about to get even worse.  all hail the super blob you can't get onto the same grid as.
---
&gt; FUCKING FINALLY 
---
Nullbear here. I fly mostly T1 subs so it doesn't cause me too much trouble. What I do hope for is that people start roaming in non cloaky ships again. The cancer might have started with caps but it metastisized into large uncatchable BLOPS fleets.
---
If we can have RRBS again, I will throw a party.
---
WTF Tech 2 mining drones are worth no money, please start using excavators again.
---
And sajuuk
---
I can finally dust off my widow so that I have a cyno brick o.o ccpls buff widow
---
HS will be the most active place.
---
Because not every ship can be a cynoship? You dont see how this is good? Hilarious, but then again, your corp explains.
---
Most logistics folks have disposable cyno chains already in place to move JFs. It makes moving JFs annoying. Some will benefit as you say, most will suffer. The intent of the change does not appear to want to harm jump freighting.
---
Pretty much. 
---
We need a nerf to bombers and other cloaky bullshit.
---
I don't do caps so I gotta ask, what's stopping someone from cynoing off grid and warping the cap fleet to the battle?
---
What
---
Good thing bubbles exist then hey.
---
The cloaked recon isn’t a perfect solution though. Hunters will drop an inhib as they always do. This will either force the cyno to light immediately and feed or be in a tac at over 100km away, which severely limits the effectiveness of what a response fleet can do because now, assuming the cyno alt lived long enough to bridge in a capital response, the faxes are out of range, HAW dreads are mostly out of range, carriers and supers can still project but their window of time to push off the enemy fleet is much lower now.
---
&gt; I dont disagree with the cloaking thing
---
I mean I know that they're partly a response to whales with cynos but that's pretty much undone with this change. I hope to see more roamers rather than BLOPS fleets. If that happens I will die happy. (in game)
---
They are the only ones with the quantity of hulls and pilots to effectively combat this change.
---
No wonder he sounds so pissed. I've heard tales of long-suffering NCOs that have to deal with shepherding their pack of imbeciles around a warzone, and Nidia can probably relate.
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
Yes, and this is why I think it is time to win eve again. At least for a little while.
---
Especially considering rorqs *should* be alts, just put your main in Delve in a recon.
---
To those who don’t understand.  Hotdrops has the cyno ship get blown up 99% of the time if the target isn’t afk.
---
then the dreads and support come in and light more cynos as needed.
---
This ensures that won’t happen, especially with how paper thin blops and recons are
---
At this point, it's worth a shot to get my €60 back.
---
Then it isn't cloaked anymore.
---
And if I am prepared to fight their capitals too and enjoy small capital brawls why on earth would I want them to be *less* likely to drop caps on me?
---
Poor Donald. Someone give him a dirty pair of socks to cry into . 😆
---
What an excellent suggestion. I'm actually surprised it's not standard practice for nullsec alliances.
---
I haven’t carried ratted in years but nice try you parental disappointment. I’m upset that this will essentially kill 80-90% of capital / rorqual PVE use which means, when combined with the recently cliffdiving sub-capital PVE usage and current capital PCE usage,  there will be little-to-fuck all targets in space. Unlike you I can think weeks and months down the road - get out of your shit-tier ~elite pvp~ bubble. If you need this change to be good you should re-evaluate how terrible you are at EVE. It’s incredible I have to break this shit down to colored-picture levels for you speds to understand the long term effects.
---
You can light cynos with alts and be pretty safe about it.
---
Can the hotdropper do that so easily without half the fleet jumping at the sun?
---
You are not supposed to be safe.
---
You are a pussy if a cloak threatens you. Just saying.
---
It's kinda hilarious that there will be people dense enough to keep using their rorquals as they would before, without a recon alt.
---
Your flair has a D3 logo in it, therefore your opinions and posts are irrelevant.
---
That was long.
---
No they didn’t do all of this to “stop botters”
---
Great change CCP
---
Literally dying right now. My cyno local back bone is snapped.
---
Yep and citadel's are glorified stations. Pos created cooler content.
---
This is better than playing.
---
You run a games website.  Have you tried actually marketing to hardware or software companies and hosting the adds yourself?    
---
That's the only way I will ever see advertising.   I'm not a fan of telling google my every click.
---
Ok then EUROS ffs or some currency didn’t mean to trigger you Jesus.
---
Fuck this for a lark, I don't really feel like spending 300m every time I want to jump my dread anywhere :/
---
My dudes are already skilled for this shit, I don’t get your counter?
---
Sort might once more need to ping for donations.
---
&gt; anyone that has been in a big alliance
---
I guess that's why I didn't know.
---
they also anchor keepstars in 6-c (the test system) off the FFA beacons, like dozens of them, so that randoms will do ~super stuff~ then warp off to one of their keepstars and they can ivana them
---
on sisi
---
actual fucking sisi tryhards exist
---
feels *really* fucking good to style on them, like that one time in tishu when we decided "hey we just spent a bunch of lennybux buying a bunch of people their first supers, let's go practice in a low-risk environment" and dropped a dozen supers on f3xson, then spider tanked the random goon supers that showed up for 20 minutes while we cleared tackle, perched, and warped onto them to kill them
---
i have footage of this i may release some day
---
every second matters when dread bombing.  also in such fights there will be massive balls of interdicter bubbles so they can stop you out of  long range gun range.
---
I just resubbed for 90 days so good riddance to all the shit tier dudes that quit. Bye bye
---
The majority of people complaining sensibly about the cyno changes are people I recognize from small groups form what I've seen.
---
Directions unclear; cloaking citadels coming in 3 months!
---
A ton of them will, but that’s just a free killmail in a lot of cases.
---
I’m sorry you lack any logical thinking capability or general common sense
---
This makes me both so hard and wet.
---
Then why not just restrict cyno's from Capitals, instead of attaching them to a flimsy 200m cruiser, or a multi billion, and still flimsy, battleship. Gonna need a support fleet just to fire a cyno...and then it gets to sit there until the Cyno expires while the other group just scatters.
---
So called brick blops "we put their name to the test"
---
Because npc stations still exist? I don't know why you'd be camping a citadel they control, those shoot back you know.
---
They 'Texas Law' mad.
---
Just go ahead and allow 0 connections - it’s what they are speeding towards
---
Brilliant.
---
Also make it so the dreads auto target whatever the cyno ship is targeting to make it much easier.
---
Too much effort like having to click or prepare more would make it too hard for the hu i mean... sorry
---
“too safe” :)
---
guessing : That they want it to be on ships that can cloak, to allow some maneuverability to get out of bubbles and move around unseen, but they also don't want it to be on frigates.
---
If that was the case though you would think they'd allow it on T3s as well but I think some dev got dropped by a snuff cyno proteus and was mad.
---
Reading reminder: It's too safe
---
not that i remember. i think they did one in 05 with max sp
---
We've been going that way for a while. 
---
Personally I hope cloaky shit gets nerfed accordingly too.
---
I’m glad you felt compelled to share this eureka moment with us, the world is surely a better place now
---
This has nothing to do with the game anymore honestly. Its already crossed the line of just punishing NS. Cause if you wanted to make good changes there are far better ways of addressing every issue than these. And it will only get worse.
---
Have you actually looked st the numbers?
---
Buh buh buh chaos and DANGERRRRRR
---
I thiunk many non empire rorquals are docked.
---
I could light my cyno 300 off and warp my dreads to your tackled super...
---
I mean it disables the caps that jump to it, not the cynoship
---
The point is you still have to use a recon to jump caps into combat, escalate on people, etc. But you can get your dread back from deployment on your own without spending 300+ per jump.
---
unsub your rorqs :\^)
---
The smart Level 4 grinding Marauder wins again!
---
I mean if you are serious i’ll bite .
---
Think reallyreally hard about strategy and placement and what comes after uncloaking
---
try your best now, i know it’s super duper complicated
---
So using any capitals at all is cancer?
---
Every shake will throw people out.
---
Just look at jumps / pod kills / ship kills / etc. ok dotlan and cross reference them with DotLan or does everyone on this sub lack critical thinking?
---
&gt; Remove asset safety and NPC stations. Let's have some more risk aye?
---
Fuck yeah! Don't forget Stabs, though. Delete them. :)
---
And bots are just as afk as a cloaked player :)
---
After all that’s the same argument of”they aren’t there so they can’t hurt you”
---
There is 150 man stuka fleet on grid and cyno inhib is going up what is your plan?
---
you should die
---
This. Nothing will change for umbrella systems other than the order of operations. This just nerfs subcap use even more for most activities. Pushes more people to capitals. Morons.
---
Because that mechanic benefits him, he likes it. 
---
Thats a good way to balance the game. /s
---
Yes, by not posting.
---
Hurr durr nerf cloak. It's pretty transparent that you want perfect safety back, through dscan rather than local.
---
To be honest with blackout there almost certainly isn't a cloaky ship in your system anyway, because when you're cloaked you're having literally zero effect on anything.
---
To be fair though it should be harder to decloak and immediately light a cyno (covert or otherwise). There should be a delay on that.
---
Na, I think most of those who were gonna ree already did it for the blackout. This change only cements that CCP has gone full retard now.
---
That is a good balance change because a single bubble alt means you can’t, and dreads especially hotdrops fit don’t align well.
---
So... i know it’s hard to think beyond one single idea... but this community needs that
---
My first thought when reading forum post was "it will be hotdrop o'clock in lowsec a lot less often." My 2nd was "This won't hurt Goons a bit, but marginal caps users will have a tough time."
---
You argued the 2nd point well. But the first one is the one important to me, and you seem not to have noticed it. The problems with caps go beyond what whalers need to have things to hunt, and this change *does* look constructive from where I sit.
---
Also reduce the mass reeeeeeeeeeee
---
Drop 500 people with my own cyno fleet into the grid then what is their plan?
---
If you want extreme “what if’s” i’ll give them right back to you
---
Maybe he just realized your favorite thing to do is complain on reddit, so he's giving you more things to do just that!
---
Really, it's a direct buff to your experience. You should be more thankful.
---
&gt; move across space and arrive at a battle faster than literally anything else in the game with zero risk and near zero setup?
---
Are we talking about cloaky hunter fleets, now?
---
It's almost as if dangerous space is meant to be dangerous
---
These are the moments that make EVE great.
---
Frankly they should never have been introduced to the game, they offer a force disparity of raging proportions, absurd inflation from mining and ratting yield, and only encourage N+1 style fights over something you need more than a trained rabbit to do. 
---
They're the driving force behind just about everything wrong with this game, from shitty sov, to inflation, umbrellas, blue donuts, structure proliferation; name it and it's probably broken thanks to capitals more than anything else.
---
I have loved all of chaos era except this. I was not, and still am not, a fan of capitals being permitted to use stargates. I am still undecided about jump fatigue, but I believe that it didn't solve any issues.
---
I think that CCP is taking this in the wrong direction and that there is a much simpler fix for capital supermobility:
---
* Add a delay timer to cynos so that the cyno ship has to sit there vulnerable with a huge beacon for, say, 2 minutes, before the caps are able to lock it
---
* Limit the traffic through a given cyno field, either by requiring that the field generator burn additional fuel for each jump, or putting a hard mass cap on them like wormholes.
---
The ability, and necessity, to use cynos to move capital ships has always been a very interesting part of their mechanics. But these changes are basically eliminating their practicality. Don't think this will put an end to the hot drop cheese, though. Just expect to see a LOT more force recons and blops out there... But probably mostly limited to the bigger alliances that can afford to fly and lose them routinely.
---
Good luck getting any bubble of significant size online in time lmao
---
Hoping this is copy pasta.  Fearful it's not.
---
&gt;But it will hurt big groups more than small groups and that is the point of all this.
---
The big groups that have cyno beacons off their keepstars in every system.
---
The big groups that form multiple 250 person fleets can't possibly switch about 10 of those to recons.
---
If you think the big guys are the ones who will have trouble adapting, you are extremely wrong.
---
I at least want to abuse the new cyno mechanics for a bit. Ive already got a couple salt harvesting plans
---
I checked the this out guys, twice even, he's right
---
Raging at some internet text is childish at best lol. 
---
Regardless, interesting idea, Ill have to read it some more but hey, at least awareness is being raised at ccp's end about how cancerous it is to deal with citadels with little reward for the effort.
---
I mean, it sounded like if you killed a pos, all that loot was yours and whatever opposition supers were logged off there could be mia for a very long time. Making fighting or gtfo-ing from a siege a must if you want to not get fucked by it.
---
Yeah make a list of names and their locations to prove it.
---
Yeh, that'd be nice. Asset safety makes it so there is little incentive to siege someone. We want loot piñatas.
---
true. but the force recons are covops cloakable, so you never know if he just bounces to a celestial and warps in from a different direction
---
its expensive enough it needs something more
---
I can't wait for the endless wave of Goon sockpuppet accounts to tell me how this is Totally Bad® for The Little Guy™©.
---
I never said all of the actions were strictly against botters, but some of them are rather obvious, the VNI nerf for example
---
Forgot the "4-4".
---
welcome to EVE post skill injector.
---
where you been living?
---
Not really, bombs only go 30km and a boosh is 100, so they're always going to end up at least 70 off the sender.
---
Theoretically you could do some 1000 IQ move with 2 booshers but I don't really think that's practical given the timescale.
---
I understand that caps still need subcaps in order to get things done but the notion of always having a cap as a option is a little much. Maybe it's just when I fully played back in 2007-2009 there were hardly any caps in the game. 
---
I love caps, with dreadnought's being my favorite ship size (Revelation best looking ship) but I also wish there were less in the game. As it currently stands there is no danger in owning a cap (aside from taking one out and flying it) and I think this needs to change. I would fully support if caps were unable to dock, only being tethered to stations. 
---
Or caps need to be way less effective to subcaps and vise versa.
---
No, not at all - what it DOES do is fucking kill the already depleted fish population in the drying pond that is EVE  nullsec.
---
And you try to move the goalposts.
---
You are denying the fact that a super can easily be killed with minimal number of dreads and you are completely wrong
---
He's turned off his hud and overlay to try and make Jita look deserted.
---
Unfortunately for him if you look right above "1256m" you can see either a fireworks burst or a cap chain helping him look dumb as fuck.
---
Your way to have your fun. I will continue to ask for my money and their resignation.
---
:thonking:
---
The issue with renters is two fold. Firstly, unlike a mercantile system who's success is directly proportional to the success of the participants, the money pulled from renters is not proportional to the money those renters make. The landlord demands a static price for rent and simple devices a tenant that cannot make ends meet. There is no invested interest on functionally utilizing the space, so there is no drive to defend it. The second problem is born from the first. Since the landlord doesn't care about the space, it is up to the renters to protect their interest, but since they have to protect the space what exactly are they paying rent for? The end result is they are just paying for their landlord to not come and make them content. This is like a protection racket run by Mexican cartels vs Yakuza. Unlike the Yakuza, which will actually protect their vested interests in the businesses they are "protecting", the cartels simply protect you from their own men, and do nothing to stop common criminals. Naturally there are varying degrees of this, but by and large rental areas are shithole slums where corps go to wither and die. Participation credits at least keep alliance members engaged with their factions politics and objectives. And while you can be an edgelord antiestablishmentarin and claim that you don't like narratives and want to be your own man and whatever, I kind of have to wonder what you are even doing in an area of space that is all about putting down your flag and claiming territory.
---
If you have a plan, then what's up with your awful posting?  Just enact the plan and laugh at everyone else floundering around.  Isn't that literally what goonswarm was founded on?
---
I wouldn't really file 30-man caracal fleets leaving from 1DQ not getting fights in the "small gang is dead" folder
---
CCP: time to buy  plex for $ and train recon
---
Every time I bookmark my entry point/s I have a moment where I think I should just skip it and keep following the wormholes until they spit me back out somewhere. I think I'll do that next time, make things more interesting.
---
You saved the rorqs op success. But srsly 150 man bomber fleets are nothing close to extreme and are rly common these days
---
I'm willing to bet that during the first week after the patch (or more even) both CCP and this sub will recieve a shit ton of bug reports about "my cyno not working!!!".
---
go away
---
If you are committing enough ships to a keepstar grid to break the Apostle by all means go for it.
---
Have a fax in system, warp it in while the supes use the cyno field generator or a recon on a fort. Only thing that changes is you get an extra 30-40 seconds.
---
That’s an exploit, any ships lost to that get reimbursed
---
Oh yeah well my smartbomb alt will clear the bubble from your bubble alt. I know it's hard to think beyond one single idea but this community needs that.
---
Goodbye cheap cyno alt enabling cap/supercap umbrellas.
---
Did you actually look at specific dotlan regions pre-blackout and compare them post-blackout? Spoiler alert the regions that are dead now were dead before and the regions that cyno on everything that moved are still doing that, the main change is that small-mid sized alliances and a few NPC null regions seem more willing to engage small gangs. Hell I know my corp even has talked with a few corps nullsec corps that we fight a fair bit and agreed to bring more cheap brawl oriented ships for good fights, and I know that it would've been a cold day in hell that would've happened pre-blackout.
---
Soon as there's a counter to cloaky cancer I'll agree. 
---
Bombers online will be real fucking dull when there's nothing to bomb
---
Bitch.
---
awesome. +1 free high slot on my ratting nyx. higher ticks. 👍👍👍  
---
no more cyno ceptor.
---
I don't think this sub will see that much, but jesus the forums
---
I guess off grid cynos are now the standard
---
that would make too much sense.  apparently we're in the "chaos era" where they just throw shit out without thinking about it.
---
A recloak delay of five minutes after either aggressing or going through a cyno would be enough, I think to balance the changes.
---
And hostile fleet won't be capable of placing drag bubbles for your warpins?
---
Only u big bill
---
Link lossmail.
---
Damn, when you put it like that... /S
---
I'd say if the ability to deploy cynos remains as such in these changes then giving the bubble to marauders seems best as with proper positioning it allows them to maintain themselves as the largest thing on grid
---
It's a good change for combat but this is going to suck if all you're trying to do is move your ship between stations
---
gonna be honest, why restrict Cyno I to Blops if there's no point in using it on a Blops anyways
---
cause, y'know, Blops being paper maché that'll get popped the instant it's on field with caps, it's just not meant for the purpose if it's gonna still have T1 resists
---
***ALSO this means that you just have to chain a covert and a T1 cyno in order to get around this change, it doesn't make much a difference if the ships coming out of the cyno can still open cynos right out the gate***
---
If a structure is low power, I want no reinforcement, no timers, and no damage caps.
---
They also shouldn’t have repair or feather services, in fact, I thing tethering should be a rig or module.
---
WTB WH moon rebalance
---
Please do not bully elite Providence FC Jesus Rambo
---
Oh lol,
---
What I meant is, if people don't like this change they must do anything possible not to buy skill injectors or whatever because that will make ccp more money and hence will make them think "damn this was a good idea,"
---
Thing is man, subcap fighting never died. Its a lie. Capital fights were rather rare before this but now its gonna be much worse. Combine this with the extremely overpowered cyno jammer and SOV will be much much harder to take.
---
This will create even more stagnation than before. 
---
And if you make it easier to hunt than to make isk, then who is gonna be around for you to hunt? This is the part many are missing. Everyone is happy they are gonna get more kills but that requires people to actually be active in space. Sub ratting pretty much died with the blackout, this now kills carriers and the minor Rorq pilots. 
---
Left will be supers and multiboxing Rorqs that have recons to light cynos for defense fleets. 
---
I reckon most others will just move to HS and make isk there instead.
---
EVE commentator/media dude
---
I honestly don't think I ever lost a ship to you guys.  I've seen the MCAV Gilas blot out the sun once or twice, and I certainly am not above memeing on "selective MCAV recruitment."  But no lossmails to link - sorry.
---
He's not wrong. Literally every change, real and proposed, has been insta-spun as "good for Goons."
---
Such an underrated comment
---
Actual small group member here. This change is fucking trash. We regularly use jump drives when baiting, fighting the blob and when doing any pvp outside our home constellation (since we're disallowed in hi sec due to being neg ten... thanks ccp). Now we can't use them without subbing even MORE accounts and still being worse off. Most of us already have 6-10 accounts.
---
When you are baiting someone, or trying to gank a crabbing rorqual/carrier/super, or kill a guy before his blob shows up, every second counts. Having to use recons takes away a LOT of seconds, costs a shitton more, and will probably die anyway because they're pretty much made of paper.
---
not rly, we mostly use dreads when they escalate with faxes/carriers on our subs. and then its most likely us feeding to their dread escalation. most of our content is bashing our neighbors structures so they have time to batphone
---
Yes except for the
---
&gt;most powerful, most tanky, most dangerous ships 
---
Part. Bombers can be pushed off by good anti-frig.
---
lasagne
---
I'm fine with this as long as the self-destruct option on my Rorqual sets off an AOE equivalent of the drifter doomsday weapon. If I'm going out, I'm taking everyone with me.
---
No im not moving the goalposts? the orignal thought was that supers arent being killed in large enough numbers so we either need to nerf them or add something an anti cap bomber.  So no I am not completely wrong im completely right.  Though with the announced Cyno nerfs, uhh well im not sure, seems like you're going to be seeing them alot less which I dont know if thats a good thing  or not.  hmm.
---
Not sure why people downvoted you. You’re right on and your comments are helpful.
---
I honestly can't wrap my head around the level of stupid in this comment. It's impressive.
---
as is overwhelming response fleets in most space, so op success?
---
No they're all bots who aren't part of the eve I want!  HTFU adapt or die it's not ruining the game it's ruining your game. 
---
Or whatever the idiots will say.
---
Cloaky cancer is the only playstyle that hasn't received a nerf recently. I personally have little desire to play bombers/t3C's only online.
---
Danger is fine, but cloaky bullshit &gt; everything else is not.
---
Domis should bear gilas in a c3
---
More power  to you, good sir
---
Sorry, what?
---
Then use a throwaway hictor all the while the dreads still can’t warp.
---
This isn’t hard and we can go all day.
---
Smartbombs don’t clear bubbles that well anyways you just want to be mad that this has a counter and that’s not how you will win in eve
---
They literally just undocked a muninn fleet to fight spectre fleet, with 3 aeons for some reason
---
And thus a new copypasta is born.
---
Soo... Fuck new players?
---
Right, because lowsec is totally alive with all those snuff dreads dropping everywhere all the time and all us small gangers just love that shit. /S
---
Interesting that you seem to comment on pretty much every r/eve post about China with similar sentiments. Don't see you in many other threads. Funny that.
---
Anyway, as has been said multiple times most Chinese players use VPNs so region locking would be asinine, the few players who don't use VPNs would just begin to. Whilst there is obviously a high percentage of botters from the country region locking won't do anything but upset the legit Chinese players.
---
This guy is a troll account
---
Fatigue will go away well before the cyno goes down, tho.
---
I came up with that insult myself actually, and I've just been dying for a chance to use it! 😜
---
In truth, though I only just made a reddit account, I'm likely done with this change. I'm In subbing my three account (nd yes, subscription as in I pay money for my three accounts) and quitting Eve. I am not creating another account in addition to my own FAX and Titan characters just to be able to rat on one supercarrier character. There is a host of things they could have changed, and dare I say should have changed, to make this game better and this was not one of them. Npcs could gave dropped cyno inhibs on capital rafters and it would have been better than this. So I'm done. Sorry BBTB, but CCP isn't getting another time or login metric out of me. I live in a capitalist country, and I vote with my wallet. Soon as my sub runs out, I'm done with r/eve as well
---
I am thinking this isn't even in Jita and someone is un-anchoring a station called "Jita - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant" and somehow got the keepstar symbol over the centre of the npc station
---
I'm sad to inform you that they've been better blops the whole time. Which is a conversation worth having in its own right, but for this thread my point is that there needs to be a nullified cyno for super hunting, and interceptors would be way too broken.
---
&gt;2nd point I don't think limiting the hulls that can fit a cyno is a bad thing, it forces you to think about if it's actually worth dropping caps. Are you doing it for strategic value or is it just because you can do it and it will heavily tip the balance of the fight in your direction?
---
Limiting the hulls which can light cynos limits capitals' mobility, which doesn't do an incredible amount to reduce their ability to defend, only strongly disincentivizing them being used to attack. And sure you might get less titans dropped onto your retribution gangs, but maybe not. But it will most certainly be almost impossible to mount any kind of quick surprise or long ranged attack with them, which is the key issue I have with the changes.
---
I literally resubbed to EVE as a small group player because of the Blackout, and other changes are making me want to stay
---
First off.. Learn what the effects are of a Wolf Rayet. That will help you narrow down ships to use.
---
Nothing to do with having 3/4 the map blue, no not at all
---
There are only few locations that have this overwhelming response and everyone knows where they are but that is not the problem
---
 I think problem
---
Don't forget the obligatory "pity" for the "little guy"
---
Yeah I remember it being something like this. Or "blind dog"
---
You're an idiot BBTB2, I only have one question for you. Would you vote for your own hanging if it was on the goons agenda?
---
ccp just wants that juicy injector money
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xknyZkAkmT4
---
forgot i had this but this is literally it + cap up time
---
Yet at the same time, CCP trying their best to kill them.
---
oh look, i have 30 minutes to get the stop bubbles up.  thats going to be tough.  really pushing it.
---
Each man makes his own choice.  I biomassed once.  Still came back (they can do that - but it fucks up your bookmarks, FYI).  Hope you come back, and obligatory: "Can I have your stuff?"
---
Not sure it's it is good or bad yet. But CCP has been in a very interesting and experimental mind set. Would be a good time to pitch the idea of adding more gates to npc null. Maybe even connections from low to npc null
---
Banzaaaaiiiiiiiiiii!
---
And that’s what the game is going towards.  There is no counter to no local and hotdrops unless you are in an alliance that can return the favor.
---
There isn’t a fix to the power of x+1 in sandbox pvp, period.
---
I could live with that.
---
So large rorq fleets have a brick tanked blops on grid cloaked at all times. They get tackled they decloak and cyno. Inhibs will be a sorta counter to this. They will have to light when the inhib goes down but they don't have the rorq tank so they can get blapped off grid. Most response fleets won't be ready in the time a inhib goes down so rorqs will fit remote reps to try and keep the blops up.  
---
Also everything that lights cyno's gets a catch bubble now. Since you can't warp to 0 in a nully ship and pop cyno.
---
Lol, they should have buffed the most op mechanic in the game 10 years ago? 
---
It absolutely serves a very significant purpose, you just don't like that purpose.
---
Snuff have never dropped me when I actively hunted.
---
The thing about the VNI wasn't that it was an amazing ratting platform. It WAS however, a great afk ratting platform. There are hands down faster ratting ships and fits. I could throw together 5 in a few minutes if necessary. They'd be faster, more DPS (which means better ticks), better gank defense... But you'd actually have to be at the wheel to make them work. That was CCPs intention (at least I have to assume)
---
&gt;Hurr durr nerf cloak. It's pretty transparent that you want perfect safety back, through dscan rather than local.
---
No, he just wants you to have to do something apart from AFK risk free until you spy a target weaker than you. 
---
&gt;To be fair though it should be harder to decloak and immediately light a cyno (covert or otherwise). There should be a delay on that.
---
Agreed, but cloaking should be active, not passive. Or last 10mins then require a cool down or something. Right now cloakys have the most risk free playstyle.
---
Oh nice, yea i didn't even notice the symbol
---
pretty much this.  why even bother with the 64 bit client if huge fights are going to be obsolete and null sec sov ownership will be static for active groups.
---
My stuff is staying nice and tucked away in the 1dq1 Thetastar. If you want it, lobby Hilmar to undo asset safety and come to claim it.
---
An extra capital remote shield rep for my recon alt
---
The mega coalitions should have a harder time trying to field enough recon pilots for all of their mining/ratting groups. Small groups don't have as many systems to cover. Just my $0.02
---
I was so disappointed when I tried manually piloting with WSAD on Day 1. But then I realized the nav/combat system is likely the closest I'll see to running a starship Star Trek style in a multiplayer setting. Hell, even Star Trek Online got it wrong, though I'm really not surprised.
---
Cloaks need a nerf though.
---
Or are you too risk averse for that
---
It was a good run ... don't like upvoting you, but I had to.
---
Cyno sabres, however, are really fucking dead.
---
I for one welcome back our battleship fleets.
---
Could work
---
I don't fit a cyno anyways. ICII, PANIC, three links.
---
Ok i warped in and now i'm 70km off of this 100mn gila in my cloaked legion. I could see where hes orbiting and intercept him there in 2-3 minutes or i could just make a tac &gt;150km away and probe him and land on top of him as soon as i am able.
---
Yeah, this is gonna be a pain in the ass to do my market hauling
---
Ah just follow him a bit. You'll find a whole world of stupid.
---
Neuts all the way tbqh
---
ya well this wrong thing just got me to unsubscribe given how they are shitting on fleet fights.
---
And yet so many people will jump at the opportunity to whore on a killmail, even despite that. ^^
---
Fucking ween. Real men take the 45 express
---
People havent been safe ratting for weeks. Ever considered that he might have spent the last year skilling for a capital only to find CCP fucked him over with 2 changes? Maybe consider he might be part of a small alliance that used a lot of Capitals to give them the edge against bigger opponents? i agree this is total BS.
---
How do you not know how catch bubbles work? This is an amazing change. Can't wait to hunt delve and watch your monthly economics continue it's down slope.
---
I know, but to say you cant get bumped in a pos shield is incorrect
---
just did
---
1: You have 500 chars in your alliance, calling yourself small is well...
---
2: Nobody has fking said that a "small" group in WHs will have it harder during the blackout. Why the fking fuck would anyone do that? Ofc you are gonna get it tons easier, not harder. 
---
3. Which means that your entire narrative, which I have heard plenty from you guys, of your "small" group thriving under these circumstances to be utterly irrelevant in the discussion of how small NS groups are responding to the blackout.
---
&gt;has been insta-spun as "good for Goons."
---
good for goons as in it nerfs everyone else harder than it nerfs us. so far that still holds true
---
I guess I'm pretty abnormal then. If I do go AFK while mining, it's to smoke out on the deck where I have a direct LOS to my screen to make sure I'm safe. Otherwise I play Project Discovery on a window small enough that I can still see D-Scan, Local, and Overview at once.
---
It's also a welcome cleanse after a bite of hakarl
---
Ow, I think im bleeding out my nose now.  Please dont give them ideas.
---
Yeah this change wasn't needed then, killing ratting carriers was easier without worrying about them lighting a cyno and bringing in 40 caps to defend it. In 2011 the Corp I was in used to go through null with 12 stealth bombers and kill ratting carriers. 
---
The safety net was not there, and yet they still used them. Shocking concept I know, but some people don't avoid risk whenever possible.
---
Welll... No.
---
No. Again, if it was "fair" everyone would pay the same price.  It is unfair when people are charged a different price than someone else.
---
Let me explain this with a question.  Shouldn't it also be fair if I paid a lower price than other people rather than vice versa?  I think I should pay less than the people in Russia.  What makes it more fair or less fair just  based on where they live?  The conclusion is faulty because the reasoning is faulty.
---
So mechanics-wise I would just undock and let tether rep my ship. Congrats for wasting everyone's time.
---
how many of us have quit and started eve several times?
---
well, it just got me to -&gt; quit.
---
It is not harmless, this is and has always been a ridiculous argument.
---
Skills can make a big difference but honestly ammo is almost always a terrible thing to make. 
---
Even when making a profit you’ll outpace your ability to sell through it.
---
How do people not understand what catch bubbles are... Like do any of you even actually undock in null sec and warp to anything anymore? Lol... Please warp to your tackled super from a Flex cyno beacon... We will laugh at you from 400km as you're sitting useless in a bubble.
---
The idea that new players turbo skill in to a ratting ship and head straight to null making 10's of millions of ISK/hr is a misplaced idea. It's just been like that for so long people accept it as the norm. New players should have a learning and progression curve. 
---
What's been going on for a while is akin to what is power leveling in other games. It's not the way Eve was intended to be played.
---
We could even let blops battleships light cynos... might give them a use beyond expensive loot pinatas, this way we dont have to spend (read: waste) time on updating them from 2013 to 2019!
---
cloaked ships cannot apply damage nor can apply ewar
---
Might cause a massive increase to "alliance loyalty", since moving your shit out of alliance space is going to be a good bit harder, as is moving your shit to your new home once you get into NPC/low.
---
My feelings right now, lets hope I'm wrong
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXztd4Flgys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXztd4Flgys)
---
&lt;WTF&gt; WOW &lt;/WTF&gt;
---
I am dunked.
---
Thank you
---
Im good.
---
What's funny is that we don't have a Gila doctrine, and we haven't flown Gilas in the last few months.      
---
I think you're thinking of someone else.
---
Limiting capitals mobility has been a clearly stated goal of CCP for years, jump fatigue is a clear indication of this.
---
Attacking with capitals will still be very possible, there's a section of space that's been doing it for years (WHs). All you have to do is pre stage or you jump your capitals in to the system off grid and warp on grid. Even if you want them on grid there will be ways to do it. Like I said there are smart people out there who will already be working on this. It's a shift in meta, people will adapt it's not the first time the meta has been shaken up and it wont be the last. The way I used to love playing the game got ruined years ago but I adapted along with others who were on the same boat.
---
Please dont use the word CCP again. They are forced to implement what Pearl Abyss is saying and PA wants isk burned from the game. Why ? Because you will have to buy Plex with Credit Card &gt; Sell for ISK if you wont be able to keep your shit up. They want you to pay subscriptions with CC not with ISK.
---
Still dont believe me? When in the last 15 years CCP made some drastic changes in such a short nice?
---
ps: are you ready in 2020 to see the changes they have in mind for stations? from 1000 slots in items &gt; Max 250 ? You can buy 3 slots for each stations for 10-15E each ? Wanna talk about Weight ? Do you want to have more weight in your station? HERE WE GO. 1 mil m3 weight for 50E/1 station :)
---
They should change the mobile inhibs to a 0 second online time.
---
Fak your supers
---
and all cloaky ships except for stealth bombers have a delay between decloak and when they can lock things.
---
Wow, how ignorant are you? Everyone knows BBTB doesn't carrier rat. I bet you think minorities should be allowed to vote either, you ignorant, racist neo-nazi piece of shit.
---
I'm soaking up all these tears from the players who migrated from WoW in the past few years. Ahhh glorious.
---
&gt;The nullbloc fake outrage on behalf of the little guy is absolutely hilarious lmao
---
You are soooo right here with this statement.  
---
The big-blocks don't give two poops for the "small guy"
---
Fair enough - I had to ask.  Move it all into one spot so if you do come back, you don't have asset window eye cancer. Good luck with whatever you end up doing.  And I appreciate that I could be the target of your last, best reddit insult.  o7
---
It's far less of a hit to major alliances. It's not hard to get a cyno alt on-field if they were prepared. Ya, it's not "instant", but you could have it on-grid and lit in like 10 seconds if you do it right.
---
Now THIS is some tinfoil
---
This has been a problem for more than 4 years. I still remember Eve before everyone had easy access to a cyno. 
---
Some problems with cyno's: 
---
1. It encourages n+1 mechanics since you can instantly bring in reinforcements.
---
2. The only counterplay to a lot cyno is destroying the cyno.
---
3. Any ship can fit a cyno by only sacrificing a highslot.
---
4. They are incredibly cheap.
---
5. Mobile cyno inhib mechanics are bollocks. It has a small area in relation to today's grid sizes, has no resist profile, and takes longer time to online than lighting a cyno.
---
Yes and no. Sure less capitals means more small sub caps. But at the same time there are people who exclusively pilot caps and supercaps. Those people are gonna start leaving quietly since these new updates are making it impossible to protect there 12+billion investments. Blackout is mixed but removing the ability to fit cynos on capitals means less people are going to use them. It's a give and take that is mostly negative to null and its denizens.
---
He's being thick? You're literally missing the whole problem that I'm bringing up -- the system entrance will be bubble fucked and watched. By the time the dictor gets out of the bubble to warp for tackle the super will be landing on the keepstar.
---
&gt;:c you post about Jita yet you fall for scams like this?!?! 
---
I am very disappointed in you
---
Well rips all blopsing
---
Why, it'll exasperate how poorly thought out this change is and hopefully CCP adds a new module for jump freighters.
---
You don't hunt much, do you?
---
&gt; Part. Bombers can be pushed off by good anti-frig.
---
See, here's the thing. I'm fine with the nerf for the most part but I think risk has to go both ways. I'd like to see a recloak delay for several minutes after jumping through a cyno or aggressing someone.
---
Personally I hope this change leads to roaming gangs again I miss the shit out of the days before you either had to fly a cap or run in a BLOPS fleet.
---
It's not healthy for non-mining income sources in null to be worse than L4 missions.
---
If a cloak was that strong, why isn’t everybody flying Covops ships then?
---
exactly this, i think you have a lower chance of losing a covert cyno than a regular cyno. Just dont cyno onto tama/amamake stations..
---
Agreed. I enjoyed it. o7
---
A pimp bifrost can tank over 100 electrons and the T2 tank one isn't far behind. You can theoretically survive with impunity.
---
This subreddit is only for people who like to rage about the big blue blop and rage about capitals.  I think that's sad, cause we can have great discussions about this fantastic game. To bad this subreddit is so 1 sided
---
Nice try goons/snuff/init/whoever wants to know
---
Yes they can. (I include decloaking as part of cloaked ships like a logical person.)
---
I once killed a cloaky camper.
---
He warped to his BM and cloaked. But I had probed him before he cloaked (I knew he was cloaky camping us so I had probes in space waiting for him to log in).
---
For a second I thought I got the location wrong as I saw mobody on the spot. But then he decloaked, warped off and then back to the same BM and cloaked again.
---
Why would that be? Are you saying you need 100% safety to run a BLOPS?
---
Because that sounds like rorq miner talk.
---
&gt;(I include decloaking as part of cloaked ships like a logical person.)
---
more like "i include the opposite of what we're talking about like a moron"
---
lol because the meta has never changed before requiring people to train into the next fit of the month?
---
Not even close ;)
---
Hmmmm:
---
&gt;The conversion of euros to dollars is 1:2, no?&lt;
---
Asking a question is stating fact I guess.
---
FYI, the euro was worth $1.58 on July 11th, 2008.  I can Google quite well when I feel like it thank you very much.
---
RIP Rorqs, RIP Supers, RIP Safe Cyno Fleets (because yummy killing defenseless and afk force recon)
---
Well, at least now there's realistic counterplay to preventing or delaying reinforcements. Right now, some cap lights a cyno and there's nothing you can do to stop a fleet from coming through. It means people will have to actually plan where or how to light cynos, and can't just do it wherever on whatever ship you have lying around.
---
LAUGHS IN WORMHOLE
---
I'd like to see them make a cyno ship and add it to this list. No combat ability, cheap, and super fragile. Maybe give it a third cyno version specifically for JF? I'm less concerned about the logistics of moving caps than I am of the logistics to move freight.
---
This post is the only rage post I've found myself agreeing with. Logistics teams will not be happy, and it doesn't really help the game to make their jobs harder. At least not in that way.
---
Can i get a sugestion for a direct High-Sec connection betwewen Everyshore and Solitude?
---
yeah i know, it wouldnt be solitude anymore....but it could open an option to make another region in FW for a front of gallente vs amarr.
---
We already have china town in stain, we don’t need anymore!
---
I don't think alphas can light cynos.
---
ask Matterall, he knows him.
---
Caps were never designed to be the sole ship class people fly though, that's exactly what's been hurting the game.  As a long time null/wh player, I'm more than happy about this.  My last 5bil came from null anoms and I'm more than willing to welcome this.
---
People get invested in those games. Imagine the guy that spent hours, or even days, mining the minerals for that capital ships, waiting the long time for the industrial job to complete (can reach multiple weeks for Titan blueprints), just to see it blowed off the sky because of some random tard that can’t follow the rules of using such clumsy and pricy ships.
---
Maybe the guy wouldn’t even care, maybe he had an attachment to this ship that just died and will get angry. And it can get on the nerves of the command of alliances, when they see multiple people dying to the same dumb mistake with ships costing billions and lots of time to build and fly.
---
Boy it's gonna suck when the inevitable super rebalance happens next eh?
---
I like your forti :)
---
this update change nothing, they should focus on updates what provoke ppl to undock and do something.
---
So it goes like this, people who like killing ships are happy because they think theyre gonna kill more ships. People with the ships are somewhat laughing at this notion since said ships wont be used in the same way anymore.
---
Also, the first group thinks this will break stagnation whilst the second group is again laughing at this notion since this is yet another mechanic that will further said stagnation.
---
Basically, I think CCP just convinced a large portion of their playerbase to quit the game because this change only means that the real changes needed arent gonna get implemented, instead its just gonna be a fkton of bad changes that will be counterproductive in the end.
---
The carrier/fax can carry a couple force recons for the cyno dude to reship. You would have to pod the dude too
---
  Stain resident welcome these changes, sure it will take a little accommodation, but we can produce disposable s-bombers for cheap (less than the price of fuel it takes to move said JF).  Harder for us, harder for you, more challenging for all.
---
  Also StainGuy since you live in Delve and have done so for the last what 3 years now?, please stop talking on our behalf.
---
  Keep the changes coming guys, this is GREAT!
---
Fair point, ja
---
I am jealous that you get to have this experience. We bitter old vets cannot re-live this :( 
---
BUT - We can through you ;) ♥
---
The underlying theory that "whoever has the most infrastructure adapts best to change" is just that... a theory. If it were true, no major corporation would ever lose business to a nimble startup.
---
Wtf do you know? You're just a gold tier overwatch player. Git good
---
My Hound can only be so erect
---
Time to call Mr. Clean
---
Honestly I feel like it's the opposite. Large groups and capitals are dying. My corp has 5 titans parked at one station. Soon those titans are gonna be pointless. Why have a titan umbrella if we cant light a cyno on the asset we want saved? Now I have to sub a 3rd account to keep a cyno next to my carrier in the off chance I get tackled before either can jump out. Put my carrier up for sale the second i saw the new update notes.
---
5 minutes is an absurdly long tine when in hostile space, especially with how easy it is to probe blops. As a blops you already have weak tank, moderate damage, low cap life. This would also kill moving supers even more as you would always have to setup a pos/cit and let everyone see you far essier. I mean shit, could go on with how it wouldnt even be worth fiiting a cloak to any ship ever.
---
I disagree, EVE badly needs new player progression speed sped up. The gaming scene has changed considerably since 10 years ago and the game is constantly introducing new power creep that makes what new players have access to more and more ineffective. New players used to fly tackle frigs, well T3D's can blap every T1 tackle frig in a large radius around them, which makes the minimum barrier of effectiveness much higher.
---
Arazu barely breaks 100k EHP if you try hard, Rorqs can tank thousands of DOS and have PANIC.  This makes shutting down an active cyno/killing it before ships land on grid substantially easier
---
what a fuckin point to be top1 by numbers of system? u cant collect profit from all of them.
---
i bought a billion isk AF once.
---
I honestly can't wait for that. A massive nerf to carriers, Dreads, Supers, and Titans should have happened before this.
---
This is most retarded balance comment I think I've ever seen, congrats.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Sweet, multiple kills.
---
and those extra steps are fine. It provides a chance for the attackers to put bubbles in the defenders' path to slow them down, etc.
---
Crap, I've got one of his corpses in a hangar somewhere I think. I haven't played in a while, but it'd be nice to have some isk when I inevitably come back. How much do you reckon it would sell for?
---
It buffed bombers exponentially.
---
Other than paper-thin bombers, all other covops ships have a targeting delay, so if you are aligned out and paying attention you can still escape.
---
Imagine the desperation when you get tackled by a Marshal that has fitted to tank a super, as it lights up cynos.
---
Still I think the restrictions are a bit too strict. Marauders, maybe T3 cruisers with covert modules should definitely be in this list too. Maybe combat recons. It sounds like a lazy way of CCP saying "we can't find a way to make those ships work, let's cripple other ships so they seem useful"
---
Good riddance? The game needs a shakedown. 4% player retention isn't sustainable in the long-term. And we've been asking CCP to experiment and make sweeping changes since forever, long before the null stagnation set in as badly as it has now.
---
You are so dumb that I am legit surprised you are capable of printing words. I never said cynos should not be a thing, but I was just telling a story. The fuck is wrong with You?
---
You do your best to paint a bleak picture.  
---
I just queued cyno V on 3 of my cyno alts.  At their remap it takes a little over 20 or so days to get there.  Far cry from your 70.  
---
These cyno toons of mine were all in a skill farm (SP always get extracted when they get to 5.5 mil, can't go below 5mil).  So I will keep cyno V skill and extract something else.  Except for waiting 20 days, this costs me *NOTHING*
---
Stop being such prissy drama queens.
---
Things that jump to cyno's are powerful and mostly expensive toys.  The barrier to entry in the past was too low.  
---
Yes, we were spoiled and the discontinuity right now hurts but null and eve had to return to hard mode.
---
&gt;Not even close ;)
---
you literally said "cloaking ships are an issue when they uncloak" which doesn't contradict the question you're replying to
---
if you do think that, you should remove yourself from the gene pool
---
Unless you are within 2km of another ships, or in SBing range or in the AOE of a boson.
---
Seems a bit too restrictive, how about just making cyno mods VERY CPU &amp; Powergrid intensive so they only work on Battleships+  or something of that line?
---
Imagine getting this mad about a post on reddit.
---
Or just cyno in caps and wipe him off the grid, like you would do now.
---
Thanks. I'll sub another bait vni to take your place. It'll be just as useful.
---
Looking forward to watch how this affects the game. This is the kind of shit they should've been doing for years.
---
Which one? Where is the fax coming from? Which station, which celestial? It's not like someone is not on grid to call out bubble location. Is a in system fax nessisary at all?
---
Shit fits die, tanked ships live. Nothing much changes rather than pushing people even more to capitals.
---
Little do you know, but CONCORD is also disabled during downtime.
---
I love this. As a small gang player this is just awesome. Could not be happier.
---
Makes sense.
---
If change is possible why do anything ever since it might change on me?
---
 Well you can just move to Russia and you'll get to pay less for everything!
---
black ops battleships cant warp cloaked.
---
Invasions were great with old Sov mechanics.. Moon control was awesome and it was the start of a long list of "worst thing's CCP did" IMO..
---
no logicstics in stain before, only wh's.
---
It was just a long term scam that didn't reveal its cards yet :)
---
TIL. I'm out of ideas then.
---
I was thinking of one less for interest, more for loans. Such as, loans with collateral. I at least saw that those contracts existed.
---
Don't spend rl$ on skins unless you're a millionaire or fly the ship religiously. Skins are mainly for showing off that you have dumb amounts of spacecash.
---
Because it logically must be included when talking about the harm that cloaked ships can do and why they need a nerf.  
---
&gt; if you do think that, you should remove yourself from the gene pool
---
mmm no, This just means you apparently cant comprehend it and that your particular gene pool comes from a puddle of toxic waste.
---
&gt; for logistics reasons
---
Maybe read up on the vni changes
---
There won't be any change to counteract this until well after the damage has been done.
---
I'll return after a couple years to see how the games doing so no
---
Oh man, My condolences to your wallet...
---
I have a horrible feeling this will happen to me one day
---
I totally support the change but yeah this vid is a masterpiece.
---
He should not have gone into caps, if he already didn’t have all the sub ships to 5.
---
no changes (as far as I'm aware)
---
And project your route days in advance.
---
&gt;Attacking with capitals will still be very possible, there's a section of space that's been doing it for years (WHs). All you have to do is pre stage or you jump your capitals in to the system off grid and warp on grid.
---
The wormhole method is very slow, requiring enormous amounts of patience and work for a very brief, intense payoff. It's cool that some people can do this, but making it the only way to play if you want to use capitals beyond gigantic blob fights is really quite questionable. Additionally wormholes do not have perpetual connections that arrive in the same place that can easily be bubblefucked and watched, or hundreds if not thousands of defenders who can all deathclone immediately into the same system when you kill them. There are many things that make this circumstance different and the "wormhole method" of engaging in capital fights non-viable (certainly not for the effort anyways) in a nullsec environment. Wormholes strike a nice balance between the effort the defender and attacker have to put into the process, Nullsec is heavily rigged in favour of whoever controls the space already. Additionally in a wormhole if you don't fight you lose everything, in nullsec it's very hard for the attacker to inflict any meaningful damage to you even if you get evicted from where you are.
---
&gt;Limiting capitals mobility has been a clearly stated goal of CCP for years, jump fatigue is a clear indication of this
---
Phoebe was dialed back multiple times for being far too restrictive in its punishments for rapid movement, they wanted to find a balance between instantaneous crossmap teleportation, and the ability to actually field capital ships in meaningful combat. As far as projection is concerned I think they did finally arrive on a pretty nice situation that allows for rapid attacking from distance with both capitals and subcapitals, given a willingness to accept risk and put in some effort, without allowing you to dunk that 10v10 cap brawl going on 3 regions away 5 minutes after you know it's happening.
---
My original point was simply that while it will negatively impact larger groups , it most certainly will negatively impact smaller, cap-heavy groups much more, severely limiting their ability to project any kind of firepower from any distance, as well as strongly reducing their ability to extract from a hairy situation if they find themselves in too deep with a superior foe. The comment I responded to seemed to insinuate that *only* very large groups would see any major negative impact from such a change
---
&gt; I think it would help with trading and such
---
**How.**
---
How could a player run bank "help with trading" and "such"
---
What is "such"?
---
I think you are missing the point this is going to increase null stagnation.  Sure it'll make ratting more dangerous, it harms actual offensive actions in Wars
---
How about you go hunting in null for a bit with a buffer or repper subsystem on your T3C instead of the cloaky one and get back to us with the reports.
---
A rig or service module for tethering would be nice. I'd like it if someone couldn't launch probes while tethered, as you couldn't launch probes from behind a POS shields
---
The majority of people this new change will effect are the people running bull anoms. It's like cop doesn't want us rattimg anymore. Its like they think we came to null exclusively to eat. I have a blast in null. And I am able to do that because of my carrier. Whatever I lose in some stupid pvp stunt I get back in ratting. I sold my 5 year old carrier when I heard about this. Why risk 4 billion isk. If I can't fit a cyno to it. These changes are shutting down variety in the game. Which is the only thing that keeps people coming back to eve at the end of the day.
---
Guys, I'm starting to think CCP doesn't know what they're doing.
---
Stain is a shithole region anyway.
---
You based your numbers on Alpha clone training times (Omega divided by 2). So the situation is currently half as bad as what's written here.
---
For anyone quitting the game over this: can I have your stuff?
---
I ASKED FIRST!
---
I need it!!
---
You do realize the the majority of this sub is for the cynosure changes (at least the vocal part)? The only echo chamber I see going on is "yay small gang" "grr anything bigger than me"
---
That would be cool, it would really then just be a matter of how to implement such a system in eve. Background checks are almost impossible and you'll have hundreds of people trying to scam you with that system. 
---
It will be an interesting adventure indeed xD
---
im waiting for official ccp reply: 'mad cuz bad'
---
Wasn’t he the guy who wanted P2W golden ammo put in game to attract new players then didn’t win CSM after flipping stances on said subject?
---
Third party butting in here, but you are asking him to do something impossible. In logical terms you cannot prove a negative as you are asking him to do.
---
fighting the blob by cynoing in capital ships, got it. Use subcaps, they're more fun.
---
Unfortunately I agree with you whole heartedly. Null is dying. The diversity and content is gonna take a minor spike and then plummet as null turns into a cold war. It's a shame. The epic wars that null could spawn is why I originally subbed to begin with, All the way back in 2013.
---
Aren't you apart of frat though?
---
The problem with that irl comparison is that irl the larger corp can't just go out and knock down the building and start killing off the workers of said nimble startup.
---
So.... his opinion is like the wind or horde standings?
---
Non empire Rorqual? Lolwut?
---
So you had to learn what UTC and timezones are.
---
I just alt+tabbed back to my afk mining orca to notice I was down to 58% shields, my mining drones were dead, and I was being attacked by three triglavian NPCs... I'm nowhere near an invasion system - have they started roaming around?
---
I thought it was supposed to be chaos, not let's nerf nullsec repeatedly.
---
Can confirm, am from small group, love all these changes. Keep 'em coming CCP!
---
I don't get what you're saying here lol
---
Heavily tanked? Shit bruh gimme this phat Nereus fit you got
---
You clearly have 0 information who is PA, what they did in BDO, what they are doing in BDO right now and what M &amp; A means (Merger and Acquisition).
---
Warping a super fleet into a hostile superfleet is a guaranteed loss.
---
3/4th of the map also have no people in it.
---
Our Corp is about 120 real people. Compare to most other null entities and we are small. Our method of finding content is open to everyone. Anyone can scan a null whole down and find content. So it's not like finding fights is restricted to specifically what we do. We were doing this when we were 60 real people as well and it worked fine because we're competent and willing to take risks. Also wh's are safer? Good meme. 
---
And as for making money, one of the biggest gripes for nullbears currently, we still have to do it too and we get by just fine. There's so many ways to make money that aren't anom ratting, I have no pity for people who choose to live in dangerous space and cannot figure out a solution. 
---
And as for how small entities were doing before the blackout. You could and would still be rolled by larger groups for your space if they had any intention towards it. You were still prime targets for content deployments and being farmed by sigs and medium groups. Your ability to escalate on someone with caps and not get hyoerdunked by dreads or supers was the same as it is now. You have an idea in your head of what a small group is and should be capable of that does not jive with the reality and psychology of this game. "Small group" is a best case scenario that lives inside a fairy tale for you and so many others. 
---
If the yardstick of success for small group for you is krab forever in your garden of Intel and never need to work for what you have then I hope you do move to highsec or quit.
---
I see nothing wrong with this.
---
Watching the tears in the comments, hoo boy
---
Out come the tired "ackucally this makes things worse for small groups" whines.
---
I think the same regarding the cloaky cancer meta.
---
Imagine certain individuals calling others "risk averse" when they hide behind a cloak and only engage shit they know they can kill lmao
---
RLML Legion
---
1k dps and can do all sites. Even the relic ones even though you need to pay some attention there. The regular combat sites are pretty easy with the right fit.
---
Yes. You had luck. i was attacked for a five or six pack in a procured tanked and need drop drones and warp to other place.
---
so why respond lol
---
He only plays the game to be mad about things.
---
Maybe stop farming them out of existence idk v0v
---
My flair is fake and no I'm not
---
AMAZING !!!!! I love you CCP!!!
---
Trig recon would be sweet. Hoping this'll have something to do with potential cov ops trig ships at some point rather than just the trig invasion
---
prolly start forming defence fleets and not droping cynos on2-3 man frig roam
---
Why should it be cheap to move a cap?
---
Maybe. Maybe not. We'll see how it affects things. At least CCP is doing something. Maybe not be such a judgmental POS over a change that hasn't gone into effect yet? This is the bullshit I've been talking about for years. CCP couldn't make any changes because no matter what they do, people flame them for making changes. Vets are so entrenched and resistant to change that it doesn't matter what's changed, they hate it no matter what. So fuck them. Fuck you. CCP needs to keep making changes, regardless of you whiny shits.
---
Blops need updating. Scan red needs an increase across the board, and resists need improving. 1b Hull, long t2 bs train, barely used because subpar.
---
The big difference is that in EVE, more expensive is 99% of the time better. So the more money you throw at something the better the outcome 99% of the time unless you are extremely extremely thick. Games can't be designed with the same pitfalls that real life has because the players who fall into them ragequit your game.
---
ha thank you, just saw some of them right now, I though I was auto-piloting ( yes I know, bad me) through an invasion system, was about to post here
---
Is it a prelude to another invasion on the jita-amarr route ? :D My salvager is ready !
---
No high slots on unsubbed account my dude
---
Have you considered building an extra gate to Stain?
---
Bots don’t interact with you because they’re afk
---
Cloaked guys don’t interact with you because they are presumed afk
---
The damage comes when they are done being afk and the buildup that follows what they set up while “afk” :)
---
Send me your stuff!!
---
The one in 1DQ is an Orca vOv, that ships is tanked pretty damn hard.
---
Good post mate o7
---
Or and i know this is hard to think about: don't fly caps?
---
Not enough time, but since yesterday patch they are roaming non invasion sistems
---
urgay
---
and cyno 5 for a covert cyno because stealth bombers can't fit regular cynos anymore
---
But it IS a hit and that is my point. It's a step in the right direction. 
---
And I could have a team camp your in gate or stop bubble your path in or a number of other options. There's counter play now rather than warp to 0 press button. People have to be more than braindead now, people have to trust their Corp members to be more than braindead now.
---
Lol, people engage it because they haven't read up on it, or are just looking to fight other hunters.
---
You'd know this if you weren't whining about being unable to pve in this Pvp game.
---
More like, who the fuck would want to live in period basis.
---
I will post my fit in a few hours. On mobile right now. U will need goo light missile skills and the fit can only do calm dark filaments
---
I plan on buying mine with space cash, I pay my sub on one account, do PI because I like it on two accounts, that lets me plex the second account, and have 2B plus what I make exploring and huffing to play with, I might not get the skins this month, I just skilled into command dest, dictor, and T3C, so I need to get those.
---
I’m really just wish you could pay isk to change the primary color of your ship, whenever possible, I have a exoplanet skin,
---
You expect me to list hundreds of fights?
---
Well... your "long ago shocking concept" still occurs today.... Last I checked... capitals still get ganked in Null every day.... even before the "blackout chaos"....
---
People have always roamed about in bombers dropping in carriers.... using covert cynos / etc.....
---
Risk vs Reward has always existed.... You might catch a super / carrier not paying attention and get your "Dank Frag"..... OR... he might be aware and prepared.... and counter drop on you... denying your "dank frag".
---
No Marshal? Take your poor skrub cyno Redeemer back to lowsec!!
---
I was getting pretty riled with arguing with you the other day, but now I'm happy.  I don't need to argue with you.
---
I’m sorry I help run the biggest cyno umbrella network and would prefer to not have everything we worked for just smashed into the ground
---
Except for the part where once you light that cyno, you're a (pretty flimsy) brick sitting at 0m/s 40-60km away...  
---
Sooo... there's that.
---
&gt;After the change they will be replaced by brick blops
---
Probably not.  I expect the cyno fleets are done. You'll just have to bring your own.
---
Remote reps for the blops alts
---
Love it
---
Good guess there, mate
---
Headshot with what? If the hostiles don't have anything on grid that threatens a super there won't be a recon around. The defensive recon only shows up once the dreads are in.
---
Might not? Dude those guys account for 60% of the shiny faction and officer mods sold in jita. You know those several billion. Isk mods that make your ship the lethal weapon you spent hours crafting it into? Those mods come from null. They come from ratting. With less people ratting there will be less of those mods on the market. Not to mention the fact that 70% of player made shit in eve is built in null!(tho dont quote me on that it's an old number but should still be relevent)
---
Without the pve community in eve the economy will collapse. People might look down on the rafters and miners. But without them you won't have your fancy t3s and pirate faction ships. (Most of those also come from bpcs dropped in null)
---
So general refund for cyno skills if you now have no use for it on that character?
---
Because people hunting in a cruiser want to be the kings of eve and ccp is obliging them.
---
The one in 1DQ will probably stay, the rest probably not.
---
&gt; make a third cyno type that only works on jfs and doesn't need covert cynos
---
or just let rookie ships and all frigates still light cynos
---
frigate cynos are pretty much never used for combat
---
This is why I support and expect some sort of PvE rebalance for nullsec coming behind a lot of these fixes.
---
Sorry man, but nullsec was way way too unbalanced and fucked up for like 3-4 years now. Its time they ate some of the nerfbat.
---
WTF a wild nightblue
---
Turns out that large, active, well-organised groups that made huge investments in infrastructure and productive capacity have a comparative advantage in change scenarios.
---
Non-shocker, news at 11, etc.
---
Wait, Rorqs can put the covops mining frigates in the sma right? And those can still light covert cynos?
---
Hmmmmmmmmm
---
Oh Good God this is glorious.
---
L4 Missions are in-part good income due to the selling of LP. The price of LP will drop if null income drops thus making them worth less.
---
I was thinking in Non mega umbrella rorquals are docked. Remember  a recent posdt about no authorized jumps in PANFAM umbrella.
---
or just letting rookie ships fit cynos
---
;)
---
And just adapt or quit most alliances will choose go home and that will be the end of large scale null conflict. Clearly this will fix stagnation.
---
lol what large scale conflicts
---
Why? Because you couldn’t do it so others shouldn’t either? I should be able to use the ships I buy however I want so within game rules.
---
Presumed afk? How so? How do you even know they are there unless you saw them jump a gate/wormhole, in which case they aren't ask?
---
...this is easier than "just contracting over 10 cynos and 10k ozone every 50 trips"?
---
uhhhhhhhh
---
All your caps will bump eachother to africa and it'll take your fleet an hour without tidi to be aligned.
---
hey bud how's wormhole life
---
btw we're out here in j-space playing muninns online so lmao at ur 130k ehp
---
I am having considerable difficulty explaining this principle to some people
---
Nullsec has been nerfed repeatedly over the last 2 years but everyone assumes all nullsec players get 200mil isk ticks or run 15 rorquals. Why doesn't ccp just release all their changes at once. It's because they have no clue what they are doing but want to just keep shitting on nullsec.
---
It's a shame. I am returning after 2 years. My GPU crashed around the time fizzy sov got bad. CCP is not making me want to stay at the moment. Blackout is fine but dont take away a mechanic that has been around for years because you want to install a new meta. That's just bad design.
---
do you do jf logistics?
---
no?
---
then shut the fuck up lmao
---
Yeah the jump gates are pretty broken and need to be fixed. They need to have jump fatigue when using them. Either that or allow everyone to use every jump gate like a regular gate.
---
This guy gets it
---
It's not like test is currently trying to take all of frats space, must not be any conflict going on.
---
"Eve I want
---
So 1 ship that is surrounded by supers and titans all day is heavily tanked
---
You can always falsify a theory. Now assume that he wants to do that to my theory, how would he do it? 
---
Maybe by going through years of data to show me all the SOV movements. Right? And then say, see, none of these remained/evolved. Impossible? No, just the need to actually back up a statement.
---
He is also using a cute trick of saying specifically independent, which is like a handful of groups at best. Pretty much every group is connected to some other group which makes it a nonstarter discussion to begin with. If you wanna find logical issues, you better start there.
---
I would go one step further and include all cruiser class hulls.  There are still benefits to flying recon, but if you want to strap a cyno to a brick named not bait (looking at you Aug navy) and throw it at something you should be able to do that.  If the issue is cynos on rorqs/supers this is still addressed.  It also removes the cyno ceptor/newbie ship/frig bs.  If instead it's designed to waste money and put a heavy load on t2 production then, sure go ahead.
---
Thank you, as well, for your answer. So do I get you right? In the long run the game wont change a whole lot...
---
hey it me, 100m+ sp mains
---
it costs over 2bil to inject a subsystem skill from 4 to 5
---
I do look forward to killing them not gonna lie.  Makes hunters lose... er... Field more to try and hotdrops.  And if they light the cyno 100+ km off grid meh anyways
---
Aye, but they will end up being used to cyno in caps as well as JFs, I think CCP intends to make moving caps expensive in general.
---
I see your point. The problem is something shiny and cool should set the more difficult to obtain hull from the budget version.
---
A short cycle cyno would be a good example. Even if it was 1 min people still have a shot to blow it up, but it gives it an edge and an incentive to use.
---
you can't do anything with only cyno 5. you also need a ship capable of lighting covert cynos.
---
Or it could be the case that ccp actually played their own game and found that flying subcaps is more fun that flying capitals, so they decided to balance it to where capitals aren't as OP.
---
Iterative design releases and taking account of data?fuck you’re dumb
---
I would have started with "No Cynos on Capitals," personally...  
---
You want a lore reason?  Uh... It messes with the... harmonics of the... graviton impingement field required for capital jump drives.  Smaller jump drives, like those found in Black Ops, are unaffected, as the... Wharncliffe limit is far lower... naturally.
---
You should go to a lowsec Faction warfare hub, like Vlill or Nennemalia, and blap pods landing back on the stations.  The lowsec guys run shiny pods.  Just keep an eye out for which groups are in system and which stations they base out of.
---
Nah, you just hang around 100km from where the fight has happened. Once the enemy dreads are committed and the inhib is up on the gank target, you light the cyno, doomsday the dreads and moonwalk back.
---
94 days of training for my cyno alts from velator cynos to stealth bombers with coverts, or 4 large + 1 small injector
---
yeah sounds fun. btw how long is your cyno chain? one cyno?
---
Alphas cannot.   They can train precursors for cyno abilities, though.  But from a starting character, that's where these numbers come from.
---
Oh good GOD I bet you're salty right now. Glorious news today on the cyno front. Hahaha
---
lol that's still a thing?
---
a single IM HAW Rag forced a 50 man BB fleet off a tackled ratting Nyx not even 2 hours ago. imagine how that scenario would have looked like if the BB pilots had been in supers.
---
nice comparison tho fam
---
"Arent part of the Eve I want!"is the key here. I tuned out when you said that. There are 20k people who lay eve. Non of which care what you want from eve. Its what we want as a whole that matters. Go play something else if you can't be tolerant of other replay styles. Eve is not for you.
---
Oh and by the way. Hardly anyone bot rats anymore. That hasn't been a thing in a while.
---
&gt;drone lands finally get NPC null space added?
---
But you said worst ideas.
---
It will change alot, just not good changes.
---
Just what evemon was telling me, and you can always boost your training times with implants, etc etc.  
---
I can adjust to be omega times, easily.
---
... the same argument that cloaked people use and have used for years? “it can’t hurt you so it doesn’t matter” “if they’re afk they can’t hurt you” “it doesn’t matter because they can’t do anything cloaked or afk”
---
So.... i’m just using the same line of logic to justify the defense of cloaks is the same attack used against botters.  After all, when had a botter ever gone after or hurt anyone while “afk”
---
Happy birth day friendo
---
Be careful what you wish for is all I have to say.
---
&gt; JF people will need to switch to moving covert alts, or pay something like 50b per trade route to grow cyno alts.
---
my single biggest grievance with this change is that the balance team literally never ever in their entire fucking lives thinks about the way balance changes will affect jf logisticians, without whom nothing fucking happens in this game
---
exactly like a year or so ago when they halved the size of topes and doubled fuel costs - one button press made every jf trip cost twice as much. nobody batted an eyelash and they just put it into the game with zero sisi testing or csm feedback or fucking anything
---
Giving StainGuy the thing he is most well-known for wanting will be a sign of the end times for EVE.
---
And yet it's still by far the safest and most profitable region 
---
 🤔
---
#THAT FIRST BIT WAS SARCASM HOLY FUCK HOW DID YOU MISS THAT 
---
My fucking god the /s is really necessary.
---
I followed that with "or whatever the idiots day" to show that I was taking the piss out of them
---
TL;DR
---
* Jump fatigue goes away
---
* Jump Drives have unlimited range
---
* Cynos are allowed on all ships
---
* The size class of the ship adds a modifer roughly in line with the Entosis modifier
---
* Jumping to a cyno takes an amount of time based on Light Years from where you are jumping
---
* Time scaling for jumps is log(LY \^ 1.2) \* modifier or so (Number will require finesing, but this should put us in the right ballpark
---
* Fuel is consumed from the ship you are jumping to (unified jump fuel)
---
* The amount of fuel consumed is based on a formula similar to the time scaling formula.
---
* Fuel consumed is based on the ship making the jump, so the size of the ship that is jumping, or being bridged.
---
* If a cyno is destroyed, or runs out of fuel, and another in system is available, fail over to that one.
---
* Cynos disable weapons, offensive modules, and drones while active.
---
Personally I don't agree with everything (like I would prefer bridges that die/run out of fuel strand the vessels), but otherwise it feels like a real shakeup.
---
all those crying is botters and 24/7 carebears...crocodille tears
---
Sov shouldn't exist. If you can't physically maintain a presence, you don't own shit.
---
This!
---
“As soon as we can get back to endlessly turbo farming in safety”
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
im living in stain and we are just fine...stop tearing carebear tears or move to saminer
---
This isn't what I said at all, is it. 
---
Try again.
---
I mean, perhaps but... when was the last time goons lost to a nimble startup?  It is possible I am not familiar enough with eve history, but as far as I know, in the long run, goons adapted better than even the most nimble of new alliances.   
---
So, it is a theory. Also one without, AFAIK, a counterexample to disprove it.
---
ITT:
---
* wormholers: "haha YES"  
---
* null pvpers: "hmm sounds fun maybe we can get some kills finally without the umbrella getting dropped on us? but force recons and blops seem like odd choices"  
---
* null bears: "this is stupid and i hate it"  
---
* lowsec/nomadic pvpers: "haha YES"  
---
* the 2-3 people who've ever used a jf before: "ccp r u retarded? circle one: yes no"
---
❤️
---
I'd like to share no more bullshit faxes jumping into small gang "small gang" fights with everyone
---
Fair enough.
---
“As soon as we get a counter to cloaky hunters, where I can return to turbo farming in safety”
---
&gt; REEEEEE
---
Everytime one of these changes happen. I wonder if the forum thread will reach its limit like the blackout one did.

not into combat. no one uses a rookie ship to jump a cap into combat, which is clearly what this change is intended to affect
---
Please dude, dont use that shitty line. Every corp has alts, you are not special. You use the big number for everyone else but the small one for your group.
---
You are completely disregarding logic here. WHs werent changed thereby arguing that life hasnt changed for you in a environment which has seen no change is stupid.
---
Still not relevant, you are still not getting the fact that you dont live in NS which makes your input irrelevant.
---
Yet again, not relevant. 
---
I mean you cant be serious right? 
---
You know what, arguing with waffles guys is.. Its okey.
---
Still wrong, try again.
---
Imagine implying someone else is risk averse when cloaking is literally the most AFK playstyle there is. It should be an active module, and require fuel/a cool down.
---
Stop being so risk-averse.
---
Honestly no.  Because he’s not a wormholer
---
Yeah but what are the buy orders and their quantity? Any market warrior can mark a bunch of shit up and not sell any of it
---
Will be surprised to see the prices stay that high for long, especially so if people are buying them for any reason other than to re-sell
---
Nice.
---
Okay so who do you fly with then?
---
\o/ cheap carriers for everyone!!!
---
It is an active module.
---
It shouldn’t require fuel that’s dumb.
---
That was people defending cloaky campers. Cloaky camping doesntvreally work any more cos no local
---
I'm talking about cloaky hunters, which if your name is any giveaway you want done away with so you can mine in safety
---
That more or less is an evolved version of pre fatigue mechanics. 
---
Issue is CCP will never do it. They are dead fast on killing their own game as fast as possible.
---
woooow.
---
totallly agree,,,,stain boy fuck off
---
A maurader can tank 2 carriers. That much tank.
---
prolly tank for a heavy in cyno
---
i am whining because i play this game for strat op fleets.  this cyno change is fine for roaming pvp, but shit for large fights.
---
and for VNIs, 5-&gt;3 drones, so every VNI should be a bait vni now.
---
question is - bait dominix or not?
---
I mean active as in it cycles, can't run endlessly etc. 
---
&gt;It shouldn’t require fuel that’s dumb.
---
It's really not. But you clearly are. Carey on being risk averse.
---
uni wh are spawning like crazy this days...use them u lazy fucktards
---
and CCP has made shitty changes in the past.  most recent example:  cyno jammers in their current form.
---
Yeah. that horde feed yesterday was not good... I remembered why I don't run with them.
---
Same shit we've heard a thousand times. Obviously CCP isn't interested in it.
---
fuck digital and dredx im gona reset them soon...i dont like cheo meow
---
Is he trying to say that he's not gay !?
---
True, but those ship training stats likewise overstated.  Or rather, the rate of training under stated.
---
Yes, its a change and requires more sp to make work.  It is not as big a deal or as onerous as most people suggest.
---
The fact that it stops every Tom, Dick and Harry from fitting a cyno on his maller to drop titans on or small LS gang is fantastic.
---
&gt; Hyper supers? Lmao see ya
---
i actually think this is a low key giant buff to hyper supers
---
because now people can't just instantly light a cyno and bring in the umbrella, if you tackle a krabital with a hyper super they pretty much just fucking die
---
and if you just gate instead of jumping, if someone tackles you, so what? what are they gonna do? drop dreads on you? cyno rapier decloaks -&gt; launch ametats -&gt; lmao CYA IDIOT
---
I have a strong desire to some day organise a capital practise op and drop on the tryhards one day. Bait them out with something.
---
The lore reason was that CONCORD didn't sanction the use of filaments or abyssal exploration, and the more powerful filaments lead to more risky space. They wanted to prevent the Invasion as best they could.
---
But I for one welcome my Triglavian Overlords!
---
This is not jita. I can tell because it's missing the pile of garbage outside.
---
I agree with you and think that rookie ships lighting cynos would be great, but with the ability to get corvettes on demand from citadels they would be spammed too easily to get caps on grid. Especially when the other option is a few hundred mil isk and specialised training. This seems really half-baked, even for CCP standards...
---
&gt;A titan in warp is a harmless ship.
---
&gt;A super mid jump is a harmless ship
---
&gt;A carrier that hasn't locked you yet and has no smartbombs equipped is a harmless ship
---
See, we can all make stupid (albeit technically correct if being literal) statements.
---
Yeah, I mean it won't hurt explo and travel and you won't have that easy way out in pvp most ppl are complaining about
---
What do you mean by "grow into groups that matter"? Recruit a bunch of idiots who rat and mine all day until you can field hundreds of supercaps? Hard pass thanks.
---
Build locally if you only buy in Jita what you can't get locally you wont need to do as much logistics.  Problem solved.  Glad I could help!
---
Yup, this is where the phrase comes from. They are "Man-Gos".
---
You can use the real number for any group and we're still small touching medium. And I mean you can look at our board and aside from our biggest kills it's all around 10-14 people. I mean give me some examples of small groups you mean that aren't a renter Corp. 
---
On your second point, we operate in nullsec, we interact with the space which most definitely entitles us to an opinion. If it were Sov mechanics you might have a leg to stand on. 
---
There are options to conquer the current and coming landscape for null, they just require work and in particular teamwork which is where a small group out to shine. 
---
You don't have strong points so you're trying to discredit my opinion wholesale by attacking my ability to have one.
---
Yes. I autoed 21 systems yesterday in a retribution. Docked up in the athanor I was heading towards no biggie
---
$$$ is all ccp is after right now targeting the elite PVP crowd to get some more cash
---
https://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0
---
Hey, thanks for posting my article! I try and make my MMORPG.com stuff a little more accessible to outsiders, but I'm glad you guys enjoyed it as well. Should have more content based on that interview coming.
---
your opinions are noted, but are complete trash.
---
Only wormholers get they want in the newest iteration of online spaceships.
---
This wouldn’t be as overtly favored to a specific playstyle though
---
So it isn’t “chaos” lmao
---
So before skins were a thing, the different paint jobs were just different ships. The police pursuit comet was one of those.
---
just drop solo at range and shadow bomb their fax lul
---
Funny thing. PB actually does have people in it. Well, bots, but still.
---
Username checks out.
---
yea, I knew they were coming. just wanted one more sniff and wasn't expecting the bubble ;)
---
BuT tHe SmAlL aLlIaNcEs
---
&gt; the ability to get corvettes on demand from citadels they would be spammed too easily to get caps on grid. 
---
they're not bubble immune. so, first cyno goes up, a dozen caps get in before the cyno registers as dead. cyno pilot reships, warps back, lands 30k off, lights, repeat
---
not a great way to go about things
---
&gt;This seems really half-baked, even for CCP standards...
---
hard agree
---
I fly with ur dunked thank you very much for asking )))))))))
---
well, when in hsec you tend to be less carefull (even if you should not !) . I admit I sometime forget to cloak/align, sometimes I even warp uncloaked. total madness.
---
No if I have valuable cargo mind you, but a ganker only needs one mistake.
---
Nothing actually changes dude.  In all my ratting, not once have I actually needed to use my cyno for back up and I'm 15x in the green for buying my nid.  Instead of you being 100% safe (which is the problem) now while you play PvE content, you also get pvp content.  Or if you pay enough attention, you still don't get caught.  And again, dying isn't the end of the world.
---
Eve is based on accepting risk.  If you can't accept it, I'd rather you unsub than keep playing.  I'm going to keep ratting in my Nid or I'll swap to a domi or whatever works next best.  I'll keep doing abyssals or maybe I'll take up escalations.  It doesn't matter.  The game is harder and more risk, that's the point.  That's what we want.
---
Mining is ok. As already mentioned people have different tastes and seek for different play styles. I would advise new players who want to mine to join mining ingame chat channel or some mining community (starting npc corp likely has one) and chat while they mine.
---
Well everyone knows a 300mil tax on cynos isn't stopping any null bloc from dropping caps on anything that moves. The big problem with this is it's a lazy change. Instead of doing mass limit or some grid limit on cynos or both to prevent instant gigantic escalations CCP decided they'll fuck up the attributes on a single mod.
---
That's the weird part to me.  For established groups, this isn't a huge burden honestly for logistics.   I know mine have bombers for the most part, along with cyno 5.   I know goons cyno characters already do too.   
---
The slog to recon is pretty huge, though, for normal cynos.   I think we've already seen how popable recon ships are as well, as they have not been adjusted in forever.  Crappy tank, slow to warp, shitty cap to warp, easy to catch.  
---
I'm fine with whatever they think will save the game at this point.  Because you can easily show metrics from /r/eve alone that says fewer people are talking about eve, at the very least.
---
&gt; Definitely an impossible barrier to entry for someone flying an 8bil+ ship that already demands cyno alts.
---
4 large injectors to convert a rookie ship cyno pilot to a bomber covert cyno pilot = 4b x 6 cyno chain = 24b
---
that's not pocket change, idiot
---
&gt;Not like this could be worked past with coordination with other pilots in a logistics group. 
---
literally zero jf pilots share cyno chains
---
&gt;Sucks that there's no positive trade off like not broadcasting your location to the entire system with a warpable entity.
---
sucks that you're retarded.
---
yep, rip
---
Yea, your munnin online fleet probably dropped a cyno inhib so the pilgrim is going to light a couple hundred KM away and by the time you warp over to him you'll be landing in a pile of shit.
---
ALso wormholes are grea
---
&gt; an, he also see you and warp to a safe spot and cloak. Can you catch him with combat probes? Like find the place he warped in before he cloaks up?
---
Combat probes can't locate cloaked ships.
---
&gt;  what's the ideal scanning strength for like, almost getting the type of every signature in wormholes in one pass?
---
That depends on the size of the system you are in. Smaller the system (less space your probe has to cover), the stronger the signal.
---
You’re probably right, same thing happened with combat recons early on. It’ll spike hard, producers will adapt and price I’d imagine will go up *a little*
---
You need to read the news and patch notes.
---
Thanks, dont need the exact location. Was just wondering how bigger is the chance of getting caught if you are near a big trade hub :)
---
I asked you for one.  Name me a singular battle where PL's cap fleet was the decisive tool for victory.
---
I'll wait.
---
Is it, if you get your ship back and the bumpers get banned?
---
its ok shortly thereafter jeff bought a 1billion isk cyno mod....
---
It's true, I gate a lot but there's no one to kill with hyper supers anyway (outside of umbrella space). 
---
It could be said that you might have a better time in umbrella space with hyper supers, but rorquals will just panic and get saved, and supers will just fit brick and get saved too.
---
hey bud
---
my cyno chain goes through the forge and geminate and i lose about one cyno ship total every 4-5 jf round trips
---
this is not a buff to jf logistics at all. not even one little bit.
---
So snuff alts then correct?
---
As if the logistics chain for jump freighters into Stain wasn't annoying enough already.
---
Yup cuase sarcasm is soooooo easy to see in text. By the way it's not. If you are being sarcastic on reddit say so. Moron.
---
Easiest way to fix citadels is just to make them have no offensive capabilities. They're already super cheap and hard to kill. Taking away all combat abilities of structures will encourage more fights.
---
Missing a few things. SRP doesnt exist in the vast majority of cases, not for a ratter getting caught. Hell I've been on plenty of deployments where SRP didnt exist even for doctrine ships. So, case stands.
---
Thinking math rules all, and big isk numbers is all that matter is an attitude, and it kills new player retention.
---
Where the fuck do you get a free procurer? And where do they get their 5th after they fell asleep doing the actual most boring activity in the game? And how do you get that procurer back because they quit due to being bored mining?
---
Would be sooo much better than fucking capital torps
---
It reminds me a lot of the Dominion trailer.  Watching the missiles slowly moving toward the cyno as enemies pour in was beautiful!  The follow up gate fight to secure a cyno in system was also a cool skirmish
---
Meanwhile I'm looking at the extra 9b or so I'll need to replace my cargo rorq with a JF because :ccp: and wondering why I should bother.
---
You were part of the problem of capital blobs everywhere then. Good. Fuck you guys.
---
What did you think of the "or whatever the idiots say" line?
---
Sure. But good luck not getting it blown up. I still got a thany if you want it.
---
Ill just keep a force recon cloaked in the belt
---
Oh no
---
jeff?
---
Oh well, I had a friend accidentally buying one of those plastic wraps with totally legit ships in it, "See this imgur pic! It's true!"
---
Such as giving loans, like a real bank.
---
Lots of goods that could be good trade (albeit dangerous) require high purchase price (such as a deal needing 40 million isk to buy, but you can sell it 17 jumps away for 50 million etc)
---
I thought that loan contracts used to exist at one point, but now I cant find them, so I assume they were removed. But this system of credit boosts our IRL economy by a lot, I was wondering what about EVE
---
Ccp has gone full retard.
---
How about we play shot put with one of your ships? 
---
Ill change the pos password or cut your access and watch you shoot out at 8km/s and take a long time to slow down.
---
POS'S SUCK
---
cynos are warpable tho?
---
like
---
i don't follow your logic fam
---
Waffles is a small 1 corp alliance and we love it. They were fucking our pvp playstyle before chaos.
---
cant wait for you to feed in delve :)
---
Hopefully this pushes more people to WHs.  It's been a little slow lately.
---
Time to buy fucking bombers
---
Redid the numbers to match the optimized for a normal character.  I had done the math initial, assuming that most would just train on alphas, but switched it to omegas.  
---
Can always do implants, other things to boost this stuff, of course, but it's equal across the board.  It is a huge change, it won't hurt the big guys pretty much at all, and the old school people mostly have this already.
---
I don't have any toons in snuff
---
i'm looking at places like branch where the krabs are too dumb to stop ratting even in the face of a change like this
---
imagine, you gate into a system, dscan the carrier ratter down while in gate cloak, then just warp to him, tackle with sirens, and frag, no stress no mess
---
have my upvote good sir. We all do pve when we need it.
---
The issue of the blops is the long train since you need BS5 (or 1 in all for Marshal) and decent jump skills to even sit in one. You also need to fork over like 2.5b for a decently fitted one. And then you do as much damage as a T1 battleship, which costs a few hundred mill. You can only warp without cloak, making you vulnerable to combat scanners, you have T1 resist profiles so you cannot really take a beating (one of the reasons you bling them). The advantage of other Covops ships is just that Blops apart from not needing a bridge is not high enough to make them a valid option. T3Cs and Bombers take a fraction of training time, so you can bring all your alts with a month crosstrain in a Bomber and those ships can fit a T2 Covops cloak compared to the Blops which is limited to non-covops cloaks. 
---
True, Blops have secondary strengths. The Sin neuts while using drones, the Redeemer has DPS, the Widow takes damage for the fleet with its ECM and the Panther can move while cloaked and has autocannons. But in the grand scheme of things, you can achieve most of that cheaper or you do not care. Like Focussed Void neuts caps faster than a Sin, Cruisers and Frigs are hard to hit for a Cap anyways, and with some paints Torps suddenly apply well too.
---
You don’t have to park a Blops on field.  You park a covert cyno on field in a CovOp.  It lights the covert, blops jumps in with the normal cyno and brings in the fleet.   Ideally the blops has capital reps on it from a Fax within a few seconds.  That or you park a Force Recon.
---
It adds an extra step in the batphone.
---
Player base disagrees, which is why these idiot threads get downvoted every time some butthurt krab suggests it.
---
&gt; 5 minutes is an absurdly long tine when in hostile space
---
and yet we managed without cloaks when we roamed before umbrellas. What you seem to be saying is you want to kill shit (to which I agree) but you don't want to risk shit (which is care-beary). The umbrella is gone next month, dude. I think cloaky ships should be engagable by the response fleet. 
---
Honestly, that's what BLOPS people have been crying for for ages, right? That subcaps be the umbrella? You can't shoot them if you're cloaked. :)
---
&gt; let everyone see you far essier.
---
Presumably you already can't cloak with a lit cyno. The only thing that changes here is the ship you're using. Regular cynos already do show up for all to see.
---
Capitals are expensive.
---
Just remove cynos and force capitals to warp and take gates for travel like all the other ships do.
---
You don’t jump the cap to the beacon for a response, for that you use a blops to bridge a recon, and have the recon ping off a celestial and light the cyno, bringing in all the other ships.
---
Wait so people laugh at the forum threads when players disagree with the changes etc, but then say that threads here being downvoted mean "the playerbase disagrees"?
---
AFK cloaky camping is cancer, but the key word is AFK. If you are cloaky, and you're at the box keep tabs on things, thats fine. Stop trying to strawman your way in this one.
---
I don't care about losing shit, never have, never will.
---
speaking from personal experience, nothing. they're on the same accounts as my combat toons and their queues are inactive. it takes ~2 injectors to get a fresh character into a cyno corvette
---
&gt;Soon as there's a counter to cloaky cancer I'll agree.
---
&gt;Cause bombers online will be real fucking dull when there's nothing &gt;to bomb
---
Not once did he say AFK cloaky camping.
---
Dcaning a ship with structure on the overview takes like 10 seconds you bingo
---
some month ago they talked about that in Eve news and CCP said they want a structure to operate behind the lines when POS go soo cloaky structure seem possible
---
"rorq nerfs"... goon or legacy. in any case, sweet, sweet tears... I'm enjoying this day soooooooo much.
---
mad cuz bad
---
Thank you! I will look up on it.
---
Legion. (MMIV) flying around aridia and small gang pvp, regularly taking on gangs 5x our size
---
Stainguy still thinks the gate will not be permacamped and he would be finally able to gate his JF into stain to save fuel costs.
---
Yea but you’re blob isn’t everyone’s blob. 
---
You may be staged in an area of space where this will hurt you, but this will undoubtedly help the delve hunters.
---
You can't infer that with the statement of fuel and stuff requiring you to be at the ship to stay cloaked up?
---
astero cant
---
&gt; Transport ships 129 days - 59 days to sit, 70 days for cyno 5, 140 mil a ship, 3 mil for covert field gen, 2.8 mil sp, 6 injector of 4.8 bil
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; bomber - 116 days - 46 days to sit, 70 days for cyno 5m 34 mil for each ship, 3 mil for covert field gen, 2.5 mil sp, 5 injector of 4.0
---
&gt; Prospect - 128 days - 58 days to sit, 70 days for cyno 5, 30 mil for each ship, 3 mil for covert field gen, 2.8 mil sp, 6 injector for 4.8 
---
Still need to adjust these figures.  As stated cyno 5 not nearly 70 days?  Didn't check the other figures.
---
Perhaps you could persuade me if you made an actual argument.
---
You could use a bomber or a prospect for that
---
look for auto piloting frigates in pipe systems between trade hubs. interceptors or t1 frigs mostly, people move expensive stuff in shuttles too. the astero has armor resist bonus and a lot of hull hp so even if it only has a dcu for tank ur not killing it before dying to gate guns (you'll die in 2 volleys if you don't fit any tank). other good targets are garmurs in soe mission hubs (lanngisi and osmon) since they are polarized and don't fit tank so you can 2 shot them with arties.
---
More so then that they are a sneak attack unfair fighters they live on uneven match ups.
---
&gt;literally zero jf pilots share cyno chains
---
:ok_hand:
---
580mil in jita right now
---
Lol don't be so mad friend. 
---
There's a queue up in the top left corner that let's you train skills without injecting, you'll be able to use it since you need omega to light the cyno, money saved. 
---
You mean none of the ones you know share them, and very soon they might.
---
Glad my main is trained into recons. I'll have to keep him cloaked up and hanging around my cap alt while carrier ratting.
---
Blackout has been awesome, I am running low on targets though...  Cyno change is pure garbage.
---
hi mack
---
One actually exists?
---
Price spike the day of the announcement. It'll come back down within a week.
---
I think most of their best blops hunters are less than active.
---
How about you spend some time flying a blops before suggesting such a trash idea and pretending to know anything about it?
---
?
---
stop posting
---
&gt;I don't care about losing shit, never have, never will.
---
Is it the killing ships part that troubles you? I thought you liked hunting but you can't do that cloaked. A cloaked ship can't fight.
---
And nothing of value is lost...
---
I would be much more okay with this change had CCP not just nuked carriers into the ground. Why  even own one now? They are useless for PVP and now its prohibitively expensive to use it to move around my subcaps as a suitcase.
---
&gt; There's a queue up in the top left corner that let's you train skills without injecting, you'll be able to use it since you need omega to light the cyno, money saved.
---
my jf cyno chain alts are on the same accounts as my combat pilots
---
&gt;You mean none of the ones you know share them, and very soon they might.
---
i know more than a couple of jf pilots my guy
---
Instantly teleporting capitals to a throwaway ship was also bad design.
---
Don't you think he should have made his initial point more clear then bashing me for not inferring his actual position through magic?
---
I stand by my position regardless. They shouldn't need fuel. 
---
You can't even see the AFK cloakers now because there is no local.
---
Think we have a completely different definition of the word “fat ass tank”.
---
Recon is paper thin compared to what you use to be able to fit a cyno on.
---
SPIDER TABKED CARRIERS MYBRO
---
THEYRE BACK
---
Can one imagine the upset when one discovered everything you had was gone? multiply that by 50000 or so, and watch as CCP go bankrupt.
---
It is not a question as to whether it will be exploited, more how quickly.
---
Even with the chaos era, there are some ideas that are so destructive, damaging, and unpleasant, that one would be hard put to find another that would compare.
---
In game inflation is bad enough as it is, real world property markets become unstable and inflationary, in countries that had lending controls, when mortgages become widely available, without strong controls, Imagine if a hundred, banks lend isk, trillions of isk, hundreds of trillions of isk, and demand for EVERYTHING goes through the roof.
---
Just another reason why it is a destructive idea.
---
Ok
---
You are a dick.
---
Black Out already killed normal carrier ratting. They just die too fast to fleets of blops.
---
just build it all locally.
---
How about banning capitals in FW space :/ 
---
For real. Do it. \*Do it.\*
---
I never said anything about it being a buff to logistics
---
they dont do that much dps tho
---
its just they do appropiate dps for a frigate and not that 10-30 dps crap other highsec rats do
---
&gt; a single IM HAW Rag forced a 50 man BB fleet off a tackled ratting Nyx not even 2 hours ago. imagine how that scenario would have looked like if the BB pilots had been in supers.
---
Honestly, I'm a bit slow. Can you ELI5 what your point is? Are you for the cyno changes or against? Did bomber's bar suddenly start dropping 50 supers? How does this relate to my crack about a BLOPS fleet moving across space faster than literally anything?
---
It's like 40k EHP with a 1700 dps passive tank, there's a sigil version too. Someone came up with the fit for entosising yonks ago then someone had the solid idea to put a cyno on it.
---
I did some experimenting, and found it better to camp stations than gates. Ships take their time to dock, and when undocking, they're usually at full speed and need to turn. That's enough time to lock and blap, hehehe. :D
---
For who? Anyone who plays to utilize supercapital ships in any way is probably fucking furious. Large cap / super battles will disappear from the map because of the insane first-on-grid advantages, and any sort of hot-dropping just got a hell of a lot more difficult, with carriers, dreads, or whatever else you wanna use.
---
My name...?  Get back to shouting at the clouds then crazy kid
---
Safety has nothing to do with people being given oppressive balance shifts, are you joking or a troll
---
That only applies in null-sec and wormhole space atm. I agree that fuel requirements is dumb to. I personally like to cloaky camp myself, but there certainly needs to be a mechanic that will decloak people that have not been at the box of their cloaky camper in the last six hours or after long periods of length.
---
&gt;That's just bad design.
---
That's the CCP company moto.
---
Or you know I'm just happy not to eat hot drops everytime I try to kill anything. I shouldnt need a 100 man fleet with supers on standby to get into pvp. That's some serious bs and should have been delt with years ago
---
imitation \*is\* the best form of flattery
---
Strat ops are the worst part of the game. "Hey wanna sit around doing fuck all for 2.5 hours, then watch a station slowly die for an hour or two?" Fuck that shit
---
You still gotta be watching for it, as in not AFK with a brief look at overview occasionally. If you look away/don't dscan for one minute you'll miss it. So I guess if it takes literally 10 seconds, you have to hope it was up for less than 50 seconds.
---
&gt;but there certainly needs to be a mechanic that will decloak people that have not been at the box of their cloaky camper in the last six hours or after long periods of length.
---
I don't agree with your assessment of "certainly".
---
It's gonna severely restrict the counterplay for large numbers of dreads- you won't be able to cyno on them with your response in any reliable manner.
---
It really kills a lot of the dynamic of the game. It pretty much requires a large force to use caps now. There are so many more ships that deserve the ability to light a cyno. Like HICs, or T3s to start.
---
Want to hunt ratting supers? If they'll even undock now when they can't light a cyno. The hunter needs to be cloaky, so you'll need a second character just to light the cyno for your gang to come in.
---
For fleets, limiting the cyno's means whoever flys a recon will obviously just become primary. It'll be painfully easy to spot who the cyno character is now. And who wants a character that is skilled enough to fly recons to just to be used for a cyno, stuck unable to do anything for 10 minutes at a time. 
---
It just feels so... not thought out. It needs work, but it needs to be addressed in a much more surgical, precise way. Start with specifics like removing frig cynos, removing cap cynos, and removing command ship cynos, and removing marauder cynos.
---
Pls
---
Weird flex
---
i'm going to say the same thing that was said when the carrier changes and hic changes got implemented.  when nanofags were getting blapped in orthros on gates, to carriers nailing smallgang actions, to hics scramming to 35, etc.
---
ADAPT OR QUIT.
---
Hey guys, new Player here. So the blackout and all the discussions around it made me join the game as it sounded really easy to kill PVE scrubs and stick it to the man in null. I injected into a fully fitted bomber today and went on my journey just to find out that ... null is empty. Like totally dead empty. When i looked at the map there was not a single system with more then 10 active pilots in space. 
---
I started out from Amarr space and went though Catch, Providence,  Immensea, Tenerifis, Omist, Feythabolis, Paragon soul and Esoteria where after 5 hours i just self destructed out of sheer boredom. I managed to catch an afk Pod. Other then that i tried to catch some Ventures and a Covetor who just warped away although i used the Warp Disruption module on them and some Rorquals which are practically invincible for a solo pvp'er.
---
The onl yactivity i saw during the whoel journey was a system with 700+ active people in it i guess a major battle. I stayed clear of it as i prefer solo pvp.
---
So whats wrong with this game? Isnt eve the game that houses thousand of thousand players in the grand scale null conflicts? where are all those people? Outside of Highsec this game seems totally dead, although every system in null is like a ghost town, full of structures but no people who inhabit it.
---
So, is the game dead or is there a secret way to find those Nullbears everyone runs their mouths about?
---
but they aren't smoking it they are injecting it just like the rest of us lol
---
you mean like a maller, or a kestrel, or a gnosis, or a interceptor, or a covops frigate.....
---
Okay, never said you're not allowed to say no to my idea. Not sure why you thought that.
---
Why would do they go up, light the *cov cyno* that doesn't show on everyone’s overview at a citadel where the 30-40m frigate is tethered, no noticeable cost increase.
---
And the risk of flying a 10b JF is still offloaded to a third party.
---
Go ahead, knock yourself out, I updated the upper diagram, you can edit these to be whatever.  
---
Default character: 69 days, 22 minutes.
---
CPU Management V (9 days, 18 hours, 9 minutes, 40 seconds)
---

---
Cynosural Field Theory II (6 hours, 28 minutes, 8 seconds)
---
Cynosural Field Theory III (1 day, 12 hours, 35 minutes, 11 seconds)
---
Cynosural Field Theory IV (8 days, 14 hours, 58 minutes, 20 seconds)
---
Cynosural Field Theory V (48 days, 18 hours, 48 minutes, 19 seconds)
---
What will stop you from cynoing off grid while you keep him bubbled. If you're jumping your supers, it's because he's not getting help, so your recon should survive most of the time...
---
There are a dozen better ways they could have nerfed cynos that would have opened up more roaming opportunities and reduced the oppressiveness of the super umbrella without fucking up a variety of other pvp things such as mid-size and large scale capital fights and the basic ability to move a capital or supercapital ship somewhere in the galaxy.
---
So 30mil ticks are  90mil an hour.
---
That means you need like 24 hours ratting to get back the investment.
---
And you want to tell me they already killed it.?
---
Where else you get back your investment in like one day playing netto time???
---
Sure, groups will have one. But every single solo ratting carrier/super? I doubt it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/XtraSquishy
---
Depends on the site. Stratios can survive at least high sec sites
---
Enlighten us, what is the purpose of the 10 minute duration?
---
No if you live under goon umbrella
---
Bring a recon alt
---
The "elite PVP" crowd is a lot fewer accounts than the "multiboxing carebear" crowd.
---
It would be silly for fuel requirements. What I can say is that there needs to be a mechanic, one that punishes people for staying cloaky camped in a system for a very long period of time.
---
removing stabs altogether is a bit over the top imo. they still have legitimate uses other than fw plex abusing and drone bot ratting in null. wc stabs are very common for travel fits as well as many exploration fits. they should just be a gtfo module, something like disabling all offensive abilities and modules towards both npcs and other players (drones included) would be enough.
---
Null is active where the alliances are. I prefer to use Dotlan but if you want to find ratters look at null regions with bots killed in the last hour. 
---
Yes much of null is empty though. It’s always been that way but even more so now. You can cram a shit ton of people in a relatively small area and still have enough to farm with super umbrella protection.
---
Why stealth bombers and not covops?
---
Nobody fleets up for anoms because it reduces person isk/hr overall. Plus managing loot and shit gets really silly in groups.
---
I get shaking the sandbox, but this is a huge move real quick. They really don't seem to care about pissing people off. It might be good, might be bad. I am not 100 percent sure where I land on this.. Carriers are what I know, I wanted one since my first day in eve years ago, and they just don't make sense anymore
---
I solo roam two areas of nullsec on the regular.  Pickins is getting slim.
---
&gt;I don't get why people playing in small gangs think they should be able to disrupt anything put in place by a major alliance without taking the time to prepare for it.
---
Because they don't want to earn their ganks, they want them server on a silver platter with no chance of a counter drop. These are the same kind of people who insist they nano fit their ships so they can take more fights...
---
Not like this they didn't!
---
They can move fast and easy yes, just like supers. But they're **much** easier to fight than supers.
---
And i am for the changes. Yes they're not perfect but still better than what we have now.
---
damn
---
Wait what? Is that full of those new RNG lootbox modules and officer gear or a fit with reasonable price tag?
---
Forgive me if this is common knowledge, but i've been winning for for 2 years now and this seems insane.
---
It's not much of a slap to moving caps other than changing the ship you need to use to do it. That doesn't matter that much other than making it more expensive. That's not nearly as impactful as the impact on the super umbrella.
---
It's what you meant though
---
Does CVA count as a small group?
---
Who the hell would do it for 24 hours straight wtf do you mean one day playing
---
I was a nullsec industrialist and I walked. More due to RL than in game stuff...but all this adapt or die BS about different aspects and playstyles is sad to watch. I hope and wish the best for Eve, but imo doesnt look good at all.
---
Ill check tht Dotlan thing out, thanks.
---
fuck carrier ratting
---
That's a reasonably blingy golem, but I had a fit that did that before mutaplasmids came out. 'Reasonable' is relative though, I don't have a problem throwing 5b onto my golem, whereas some might find that excessive.
---
I agree
---
Just queued it on one of my chars.  Had cyno 3 (40k sp ~ 1 day).
---
https://pasteboard.co/IsIbv4Y.png
---
Something is screwy cause your numbers are way more than they need to be.  I'm not even sure my remap and implants account for it.
---
No it isn't, dipshit. 
---
Or I would have said it. 
---
Nobody should be safe while afk. Even bombers and T3C's. Be risk averse somewhere else.
---
Nullified T3 with covert cyno for the blops, and the blops lights the cyno directly next where it wants :)
---
Well that's your fault for making granular toons, I only keep 2 dedicated cyno alts that use pre-seeded stations (corp hangar for shared assets) and travel ceptors to get around.  so instead of having a toon with the SP of an alpha tied to a station you can be flexable with valid NPC stations in the same area to avoid hunters or change routes.
---
And to answer your main question, my longest consistent route is 5 from jita... with all toons it takes ~30 min. to go from one end to the other.
---
This will make it easier on the large blob vs the 20 man leet pvp gang.  The leet gang will have to pick at least 1 ship to be a cyno ship, and everyone will know, "Humm, if I just melt that one ship, no hostile escalation.  Verses basically half of the small gang guys having cynos fitted.   If they lose their one in-cyno, and maybe their one backup, they are done for.  If they bring a couple backups, each one of those is taking away a large part of their fleet.  So now 10% of their fleet comp is devoted to cynos, to have 2 cynos.
---
VS
---
Goon blob bringing 10 extra cynos (because goons are terrible).  Their 250 man fleet is down to 240.  Goons lose less then 5% of their fleet comp, and have a lot more backup, and can be terrible as usual.
---
Of course that's a thing, yes, but you're quite likely to feed the cyno ship (which is not cheap). Reaching the target area is another story though.
---
I am unironically completely ok with all of this. Subcaps are more diverse and more fun in every way.
---
Netto time mate. It means you need only to rat 24 hours to get back the investment.
---
If you rat that in one week or one month thats on you.
---
But still way to fast to get back the investment.
---
&gt; you idiot.
---
Sorry I gave you the feels. 
---
Tell me how dangerous it is to drop a 50 man bomber fleet on an unsuspecting Thanny? Does bridging make your ship explode? Are you not able to activate MWD? will hostile subcap fleets suddenly spawn with on top of you?
---
Today:
---
You jump in. Aggress and sometimes kill the target he lights a cyno. You deaggress and cloak. Blueballs all around. You spam local about how they're a bunch of scrubs.
---
Next month:
---
You jump in. Aggress and sometimes kill the target he calls for help on comms. He dies. The response fleet might get there within five minutes (highly doubtful). You deaggress and cloak. You spam local about how they're a bunch of scrubs.
---
With a five minute timer, you might MAYBE see a response fleet arrive. I honestly think I suggested too short a timer. If you do see one, you'll have to roll safes but some of you might get picked off.
---
Is that seriously too much risk for you, Mr elite PVPer? You sound like a rorq pilot.
---
Maybe you should demand CCP make your target ship explode when you land on grid. ;)
---
u wot m8 u fink ur ard come on 1v1 at the sun ill give it ya
---
That's too hard. Why not just do random shit and see what works instead
---
 You only risk alienating players after all.
---
Fleet PVP is what makes Eve unique
---
Why do you need to sacrifice your cyno when the cyno lasts 60 seconds and doesn't show up on the overview anymore?
---
Yeah, it could be done. I'd really like to have the opportunity to kill rorquals and supers as well though and you can't really do that unless they're actual brain donors. You also have to get your super/titan to the ganking region which would be complete aids.
---
Oh you really have to ask? OK, then.
---
1. it lights up a 10 minute beacon that you just moved something(s) through a cyno unless you destroy the ship
---
2. it makes you put the cyno ship at risk
---
3. it inconveniences you for using the most OP mechanic in the game
---
Now of course, the mechanic was and still is incredibly overpowered regardless of the cooldown. And yes, people just exploited it by using corvettes or other bullshit ships to light cynos.   
---
Now there at least are restraints on which ships can light cynos.   
---
Are cynos still OP, yes. Will people still abuse them to no end? yes.   
---
But your thought that cynos should ever see another buff, ever - is just silly. 
---
Any mechanic that buffs cyno's in any way - is a bad idea.   
---
Cyno's still need to be nerfed dramatically.
---
You have my downvote
---
Adapt or die is a toxic mindset. It might actually be the thing that kills off the last of us vets.
---
Maybe.  I'm an idiot above all else. TDSIN perhaps?  Whatever, I don't wormhole anymore.  Too much effort for my limited time.
---
Tale my damn upvote!
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Somebody's going to have explain this one to my dumb ass. Why does changing what ship can use cynos make all other subcaps besides cloaky obsolete?
---
This meme gets better the more people say it.
---
People still think I'm dankguy too, lol.
---
I assume 20k active is with links?
---
But yeah 5b is def. on the upper echelon of pricey fits for a golem .. well is it. Are the hulls still 1.2-1.5b ?
---
Well, an idea of mine was to have a set of rules for a bank where loaner doesnt loan unless they can use a contract for collateral, and they wouldnt loan unless their net worth is 200% (or more maybe) more than the loan. My thinking being that there would be maybe a handful of these services, if not just 1, so one cannot, say, double their worth this way.
---
My main concern is that it limits double and triple mass escalation options. I actually enjoy big cap fights and watching titans and supers die and making it harder to get those fights than it already is given how rarely they happen now seems strange. I suppose killing a random bridge titan that jumps or anybody ratting in a super without a cyno alt wont be terrible for the first week. but not being able to light cynos on grid with a hostile fleet without getting your 300m cyno insta dunked is going to limit options i feel. unpopular opinion maybe but idgaf.
---
I assume you say this because you can't jump bridge everything easily anymore?
---
Hulls are 1.89b in Jita right now.
---
It's something like 19.6k active with links/drugs/crystals cold. You can absolutely fit for more tank but that's what I'd call 'reasonable'.
---
I've seen multiple fleets of a dozen or more mining/industry ships that were obviously one person because they all had almost the same name. There are certainly at least as many such fleets that aren't as obvious.
---
Meanwhile, the elite PVPers are over here with a scanning alt that's on the same account as their cyno alt (RIP), and a hauling alt so their criminal ass can buy ammo.
---
GOLDEN AMMO
---
K and gank ships are too cheap and cloaks are too overpowered which is why the return time is so fast mate. Think about why it’s balances this way
---
&gt;The mega coalitions should have a harder time trying to field enough recon pilots for all of their mining/ratting groups. Small groups don't have as many systems to cover. Just my $0.02
---
You're kidding, right?
---
I can only imagine how many Cruiser 5 pilots that would otherwise be doing very little if/when this is combined with Blackout are about to rediscover new purpose with a ~30m train into Recon I.
---
You can run a C3 with a 1.4b ISK Rattle for 200m.  Hopefully more people come to WHs.

2B isk? Is insurance not a thing?
---
&gt; But they're much easier to fight than supers.
---
Not when they cloak up when you form a response fleet. Then they are even harder to fight than the super is.
---
&gt;And i am for the changes.
---
I think I am. I haven't fully digested what this means, yet. I do think it's fucked up not one T1 ship can mount a cloak, though. It really raises the training bar on cynos and for a lot of people, losing a lot of recons will make them quit using caps.
---
I'm willing to see how it goes though.
---
What I do think is it only makes risk happen in one direction. Something should be done to make the bombers and BLOPS be exposed for a period of time. Otherwise, all CCP did is move the cancer from one side of the body to the other.
---
What I'd like to see is roaming fleets. Guys who are neither protected by an umbrella or unassailable because of cloaks.
---
Cheers from Anoikis
---
But with only these handful of ships being able to light cynos now, wouldn't one expect their prices to rise due to sudden immense demand? Maybe at least until supply levels out.
---
Why wouldn’t they?
---
24 hours of solid ratting without losing a ship though.
---
In theory you can rat for 24 hours with no issues and pay for it. In practice, give it a go
---
STO was designed around 90 other aspects of gameplay.  The space combat and navigation were limited by the Cryptic engine they used.  It was designed for third/first person gameplay, and then had the ship parts bolted on later.
---
r/rareinsults
---
[Conversely...](https://i.imgur.com/GKpc6uH.jpg)
---
but you are still going to get dropped by haw deads every time you roam.... changing the ship that does the cyno doesn't change the will of the people to drop their toy on you. If you want to say haws were a mistake just say haws were a mistake like make a change that matters.
---
I think it’ll actually end up being a worse hard cyno than recons, since it’s faster to lock a battleship compared to a cruiser. Against a large enough fleet, any ship dies in the time it takes to lock it.
---
In principle, the change is good. 
---
In reality, there are far far far too few ships now. Literally allowing 2 ship types to use a cyno is ridiculous
---
If someone needs to take out a 40 million ISK loan to make 10 million, there's no point in them trading at all. A good chunk of the profit from the sale will go directly towards the interest on the loan. They could go ratting in lowsec for an hour and make more ISK. This scales roughly linearly for any loan taken out to trade on. Want more ISK up front? Lose more of your profits.
---
Cheap, fast selling items like ammo? Overhead is so tight that you lose almost or all your profit on broker fees and interest.
---
Slow selling, high margin items like purples? Take out big loan and hope to god it sells before the loan is due or you've lost the profit to interest.
---
And what's stopping me from just ghosting with the dosh, anyway? If you can afford collateral to put up, you're not looking for loans anyway. It's too easy to shit ISK nowadays.
---
And what's to stop the bank from ghosting with the dosh? (Hint: nothing)
---
Where ever CCP is injecting those monies it is not eve
---
&gt;Where else you get back your investment in like one day playing netto time???
---
c3 rattlers (1.5b for 200m/hr), c5 spidertank rattlers (4b for 600m/hr), c5 tripledread (7b for 2b/hr), vnis (i guess domis or myrms now), industry, retrievers...
---
there's a ton of ways to get your money back in under an hour let alone 24 hours
---
Yeah, 5b isn't unreasonable with the hull being that much. Mind sharing the fit?
---
Blops != bombers.
---
In that case, he's a dumbass for not having multiple safes in case one is compromised by a speedy prober.
---
Subtle request for a lowsec gate?
---
I run 10/10s and make anywhere from 128m to 900m (rare) per 27 min.
---
.... Maybe
---
here here, I don't jump more than three cynos from Jita but my heart goes out to the logistics in alliances on the edges of the map, long chains will be exceptionally painful now.

He better go read the reaction of his Panfam plebs, they kinda complain in their discords about the same things as the Imperium do....

Irony level at 9000.
---
Wow thank you!
---
The safe cyno fleet is run by one guy who pretty much funds it all by himself (with some donations), it isn't some alliance initiative so unless if the alliance starts helping out I think we'll lose the fleet for now
---
Good job Bombers Bar. You make me proud.
---
Yeah, Gilas sound like TDSIN.
---
will it though? capitals are an answer to having fewer subcap numbers than the other guy.
---
My vote for Bjorn Bee
---
Im all with you on the roaming fleets thing, would love to see that.
---
&gt;Implies I said something I didn't.
---
&gt;Then says I'm angry about him lying. 
---
You're a real idiot aren't you.
---
This doesn't do shit to big alliances, they need to throw a few injectors at the logi division to get their cyno pilots into a recon now, big deal
---
I have a skill queue as well
---
Tell that to the thera groups who live to farm nullsec.
---
No you.
---
the future is now old man
---
BLOPS fleets can be called that for anyone who drops covert cloaky ships on a target. Yes, I've done it before and I don't think I implied a solo BLOPS pilot dropping on a cap. THAT can be dangerous, and I don't think you're that into danger (to you).
---
Look, I'm sorry you're too retarded to know how to connect the dots. It's not your fault. It's just your mom and dad's genes were weak.
---
If you feel that style of play is too risky with a simple cloak timer, maybe you should roam null in a Rifter. It's still risky but it will cost you less.
---
Or is it your ship that makes you elite?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cknrxn/dont_let_the_blackout_distract_you_from_the_war/evqq987/
---
I get the sentiment, but it's not like the cyno arazu is gonna be uncloaked for you to see it.
---
Can they still enter plexes thou, small fleets of battle ventures are fun
---
but it will almost assuredly be more expensive than it was before because demand is higher. ESP because now you will only be able to mine moons in sub caps without dieing. this update kills rorq mining.
---
&gt;That depends on the size of the system you are in. Smaller the system (less space your probe has to cover), the stronger the signal.
---
I'd love a ballpark. The thing I meant is to get all sig type when you do a 16AU scan.
---
Jesus Christ you're actually a retard, aren't you?
---
RR tempests at dawn, then. Someday.
---
&gt; changing the ship that does the cyno doesn't change the will of the people to drop their toy on you.
---
And then I get a force recon kill.  I am happy.
---
You do understand why I don't want to redo all the math to match your implant and remaps, correct?  I would guess you are in +5 implants as well, based on what I'm seeing here.  
---
I would do this on my characters, but they all have cyno 5 and bomber skills.  
---
It's all relative.  To move a JF, it used to be 20 days.  Or with optimized skill, it used to be 16 days, and now is 101.
---
&gt;he might have spent the last year skilling for a capital only to find CCP fucked him over with 2 changes?
---
suprice suprice this has been eve for years. The meta changes and doctrines change. If you are going to go crying on the forums every time ccp rebalances a ship maybe just stop playing all together
---
Wow a decent suggestion to adjust cynos, too bad CCP wouldn’t know a good idea if it hit them in the face
---
this is going to be even worse for small gans roaming nullsec, all this is going to do is make a ton of people group up in a single system so they can just warp in for a save, sure there are still gona be nut bar's that are out under the main umbrella but the people with common sense are going to all hunker down in a one or two systems for mutual support.
---
Make sure it's cloaked nearby. Otherwise those bubbles will get you.
---
The spin is out of control, no matter what you say the order of operations is greatly delayed for many reasons.   
---
1) if attackers put inhib up the recon must immediately open cyno and get people in, if he does it close range he risks being blapped if he does it long range he risks getting people bubbled when a dictor warps to the cyno and bubbles.   
---
2) in your bouncing scenario a simple carrier is gonna be nuked between two warps by a 100 bombers.   
---
3) organised hunters can utilize dreadbombs much much better with that kind of delay.
---
#literally
---
Why not introduce a t2 frigate for each race that can fit t1 cynos. Relegate it to one ship. This will make the t2 covert cynos worth training because it opens three types of ships.
---
Even if cynos were a toggle most of the time your fatigue would run out before you got to the next cyno spot
---
Oh, for sure. I used the pre-announcement numbers.  Because we don't know what they'll be.  But I'm sure that t2 production will just increase. until it can't.  :)
---
oh hey.... I was joking around with a friend (nothing to see here)
---
PandaB0TFam will likely be fine too
---
Ever drop a blops fleet in hostile space, doesnt take long for backup to get into system and theres a lot of risk. If you cant cloak for 5 minutes then there is really no point in blopsing opposed to roaming as roaming ships are far cheaper, are designed around mobility, and dont have to deal with having 30% of your cap when first engaging a target.
---
Oh I most certainly could rat in a carrier, if I felt like my manhood was no more and my pride worth so much kitty litter.
---
I can't wait to see what is next implemented for /r/Eve Online: A Tedious Internet Spaceship Game™
---
That was so subtle.
---
To the down-voters, [WHOOSH!](https://xkcd.com/1627/)
---
Not the whole player base that's for sure.  Cloaks need a nerf.
---
That's an impressive retort. Do you mind if I borrow if for when I need to debate someone else from your gene pool?
---
Perhaps you can improve on it, though. Tell me how you really feel. Don't hold back and try not to use any big words you might stumble over.
---
Fuck you, no one does anything faster than we blue new alliances.  I literally can't click +10 fast enough.
---
So did they blue 3/4 of the map or did they farm 3/4 of the map out of existence? Which narrative or we pushing today?
---
Why are you lighting cynos on a 100 mil SP character?  You don't need anything close to that for a cyno T3.
---
You're joking right? That's fucking retarded.
---
I know one guy who doesnt like these changes and one who does.
---
Ive never encountered the one that doesnt outside his nyx
---
Yeah, fuck, I'll need to come out of retirement when this shit changes here bois. GET YOUR MOMS SPAGHETTI READY.
---
That made me lol fine take your upvote.
---
A simple carrier is gonna be nuked by 100 bombers regardless even if it opens a cyno itself
---
m8 but it's just so impossible that you could be in an actual small group, none of them have caps, anyone who tells you otherwise is fake news. Small groups only do elite solo retribution roams or smallgang nano fleets, everyone else is a dirty bloober
---
Still better than the tackled Rorq lighting its own cyno.
---
I was just saying Black Ops in general, not a specific group. I have been wanting to see the solo blops and blops in general getting a buff and this will help a lot.
---
They're talking about Drifter Wormholes (those that show up in systems with Jove Observatories).
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Drifters#Drifters\_Wormhole\_Systems](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Drifters#Drifters_Wormhole_Systems)
---
Isn't everyone forgetting the origins of this idea!
---
Pretty impressive for a non-dev!
---
A recon cyno alt
---
You are gonna to need it
---
Lowsec gate to Stain from Lowsec Khanid. Win Win!
---
I would wait till you hit the 5mill cap and then inject it at that point into whatever you’re using the alt for.
---
A (jump)freighter is a harmless ship too. A (jump)freighter is at risk when in use.
---
Vindis man, Vindis
---
sholdn't you be complaining about nasty gankers multiboxing alphas?
---
Haha... I know, but this would stay and alpha account.
---
Who the fuck is Sam the dog?!?
---
You think i'm not happy to blap those 2 Arazu's and then run for the hills? And there's always a chance part of the response team misses their much smaller window or a panicked caught miner lights before his rescuers are ready and nails his own coffin. 
---
Bottom line,  more ship death all around.
---
If they want $$$ they need to make people spend money. So force them to fly ships that require omega. And force them to reskill a lot of chars so many will look for injectors.
---
Ramping up production isn't an overly arduous task. No long duration research, just invention.
---
Let me try a different tack.
---
Can we agree that in order to get the cynosoral fiield theory skill to lvl IV you need a total of 1 280 000 SP([https://pasteboard.co/IsInMI1.png](https://pasteboard.co/IsInMI1.png))?
---
If you were to divide that number by your stated 50k SP a day we get... 25.6 days... 
---
Now the difference between my 20 days and that hypothetical 25 days I concede my remap and implants account for.
---
The difference to get to 70 days?  No way.  Dare I suggest you are still looking at an alpha toon training here?
---
lol "I should be able to kill a super with no resistance!"
---
He's test. Bless his little heart.
---
I know this is hard to think about: I don't
---
Hmm since the BS is obviously slow to finish warp, there's a really good chance to catch it right as he finish his warp. Damn I wish plex wasn't that expensive I'd love to try that stuff by multiboxing
---
I just resubbed. I’m loving the changes. Bring the drifter invasion back please!
---
lol @ the fact you don't realize us, Panfam, Frat, and Test will be fine but everyone else will die off
---
I second this confusion.
---
SH1-6P
---
You’re welcome.
---
You’re assuming people will buy plex and trade that for injectors, as if there aren’t huge swathes of players so obscenely rich they can just eat the cost if a cyno alt.
---
I have a soft spot for Delonewolf,
---
Care-bear industry market guy. He does weekly reports on Jita on some of the most traded stuff. 
---
Quite entertaining for armchair economists like myself
---
Yes, I've been in them before. Not as the BLOPS but I have caps, so the I know about the cap thing. 
---
I also know you have to be super unlucky for the response fleet to get there that fast and you came for a fight anyway, right? You're still mostly in fast manueverable ships and can roll safes while  you have aggro. You'll get unlucky sometimes and lose something but that's the entire point I'm making. Risk should go both directions.
---
Running covert fleets make sense today as the cap cancer is real. That said, the prevalence of these fleets is a sign that the cancer has metastasized. You won't see the kind of umbrellas we have today after the patch hits. You can't possible tell me you want this game to turn into "Eve: Black Ops". Please say it ain't so.
---
Nah they will remove Jump Fatigue entirely first. 
---
Seeing as they want to go back to 2012 and subcaps online
---
And dies the defence for a heartbeat after decloaking, appartently you have not been in any large fleets.
---
typical null bear outlook.  I never said my aim was supers. But yes if you wanna defend your super have people within range to come help it. being able to jump your entire capital fleet across dozens of systems within seconds is fucking stupid
---
I third this funcusion,
---
TIL Delve and Fountain were 3/4 the map
---
Sure. But once you get more than 80 ships on grid the game becomes very unique, in how much that part blows ass
---
and so what? 
---
Many people who "knew" their shit when they said rorqs are gonna be shit (before the initial rorqual mining patch). And rorqs became the ruler of the game for 2 years straight...
---
Many people who "knew" their shit, claimed that a supported keepstar in a WH cannot be killed. And then had to blame everybody, when init proved them wrong. (not init btw)
---
Many people said, the blackout does not affect large groups with umbrellas. Still, many rorqs switched to T2 drones, afk ratting farms stopped, normal carriers got alot fewer etc. (And BOT empires DID implode)
---
I am one of the guys on the other side of the killing. And I ALSO KNOW SOME SHIT, for example, I know what the hell can all go wrong when "activating" the umbrella. 
---
I'm fucking annoyed by people complaining it won't work, doesn't change anything etc UNTIL IT HITS THE FUCKING SERVER! And watch IF IT REALLY doesn't change anything. Especially, this change has very little that can go wrong. Except that you need to bring a few cyno ships extra if you want to go up the escalation chain, or that you need to light your cyno a few hundred km out to not get instantly volley (which again would make it really interesting).
---
Uhm like absolutly everywhere else
---
I wasn't implying that it would be arduous, but it won't be instant.
---
thanks for clearing that up
---
But isn't the training half as fast and omega? So, that would take about 8 months to get to 5 mil.
---
just give the guy his gate CCP :P
---
Chess or Poker
---
Thanks to some 2m in free skill points from ccp gifts, my cyno alts are covops ready.
---
Thanks cco
---
I was more responding to /u/Fuzzmeister's idea that Prospect prices would drop due to their current high profit margins... but I think prices would only raise further, at least for a minute.

---
Agreed, would have been a better change. Makes ratting in caps more risky, but doesn't massively change everything.
---
CVA has not been relevant since forever. They have always been able to hold sov by the Goodwill of their neighbors. Actually defending from any invasion is impossible.
---
Eve.
---
Whilst that info is technically correct, the mechanic doesn't hold up well under tidi. This is why in aupercap escalations, everyone jumps to am Aeon or wyvern. At ualx we lit the in cyno with a Leviathan for this exact purpose.
---
You're not the dumbass here
---
They said player owned FOBs were gonna be a thing at Eve Down Under last year
---
If there's a pilot to get in them faster then they can be shot.
---
The SP gap is rough aswell, covert cyno alts are a long train
---
no you can't, because there is no way for you to know if the cloaky is AFK or not till they drop on you.
---
You just completely ignored what he said and said your own thing again. Think a little, read what he said, and realize you are wrong.
---
Find a base level skill point list and train/use your unallocated on that. Base skills are very important. Quick google search can find one, eve university has them
---
no more cynoceptors...
---
I'm fine with that
---
Amazon also started as an online library.
---
What I'm saying is it's been nearly a decade since the creation of Goonswarm in EVE - we have grown older and more aware of the game around us. We all love this game, and yes, we can deal with shit - but we also know others can't and it's depressing. Just because you can curl 200 lbs yourself doesn't mean you shouldn't help someone carry their bags if it's too heavy for them.
---
&gt;I get shaking the sandbox, but this is a huge move real quick
---
They're doing what they've always done: throw stuff at a wall to see what sticks.  Only now they seem to be cranking it up to 11.
---
Will watch a documentary about a Salt mine.
---
Stage your fights better.

it's just fucking dumb... they are literally pulling a Game of Thrones writing team on EVE.

Wait, 6 min PANIC on a ship with dreadnaught tank isn't sufficient time for your friends to rescue your Rorq? Maybe you don't deserve SOV if your alliance is that terrible at defense.
---
You have never been to placid or syndicate
---
FW alt. Kyte Tristan. All SP in light drones and navigation skills. It can run novice and small plexes. It's cheap and easy to replace. It can take down targets way more expensive than it.  Hop in a public milita fleet and have fun.
---
Same thing Olemeca does. Ask him for advise
---
AFAIK they are tech limitations that ccp has attempted to mitigate the results of, but cannot fix.
---
When 95% of null is your fellow T3C and bomber hunters....... with zero content...... You will miss that "value" you didn't care to lose.
---
24hrs is terrible lmfao, Nullsec in general is pretty bad for ISK. Scalability is the only advantage it has
---
oh I'm sorry... "I should totally be able to kill this marauder in my single solo ship with no resistance or skill needed!"
---
&gt; Instead of "Oh now we get to escalate." Not because we couldn't, we had a disproportionate number of caps to members often times, but I always just found capital ship gameplay to be fucking boring.
---
Maybe you get dropped so much because you never escalated? I don't get how this has to do with caps. If you kill their caps everytime they escalate, maybe they'll stop
---
If stain gets a gate to lowsec I'll mod stainguy then extract all my remaining SP and give it to /u/olmeca_gold
---
The Lachesis is not a force recon.
---
Often "empire" is used to mean hi sec, thats why the other dude got confused, as all rorquals are non empire under that definition.
---
That 20k dps number is very subjective. Half the time you wont have the buffer to deal with that much damage in the first place. Plus youre sitting still so a single anticap dread will pretty much just 2 shot you
---
:o nowai, really? I run Indy out of my corp's home system as my isk generation, and can't be arsed with the capital-only nonsense that most people push as the goon way.
---
Using fully half of my isk pool for industry just to maintain the capabilities I have now is pants.
---
Tbh i’m down for anything that’s the next spaceship crafting sandbox.
---
I love the idea, and while i get eve is trying to make it more edgelordy and fun for their ideas... A dec forcing balance is not fun in any game, whether it’s WoW, Runescape, or now Eve
---
Huagh, you mean I'm not allowed to print money anymore, huagh!?
---
where have you seen a small gang?
---
Why would I be salty? Cynos still work just fine.
---
If you want the sub to downvote criticisms and endlessly circlejerk then r/Warframe is that way ----&gt;

This sub is good because its one of the few subs that tends to downvote dumb karma whoring and call out idiots, at least most of the time. This sub could be so much worse.
---
I'm going to miss killing all those Nereus cyno's in Delve :'(
---
And you have never seen Arrested Development. ;)
---
1 large discord server where we draw our own spaceships and battle them
---
lol.
---
Why would anyone go there?
---
It's not.
---
He said that he wanted the cloak to be an active module. It already is.
---
Then he said it should require fuel in addition.  Thats where I disagree.
---
It shouldnt require fuel, only cap, to run a cloak.
---
Yes there is still a war going on.
---
&gt; He is also using a cute trick of saying specifically independent, which is like a handful of groups at best. Pretty much every group is connected to some other group which makes it a nonstarter discussion to begin with
---
actually specifying the group you're talking since the start is a "cute trick" now, amazing.
---
&gt; which makes it a nonstarter discussion to begin with
---
and yet your dumb ass started engaging and is discussing it up until now, guess some people just have quite the low self esteem i guess. This thread is a waste, cya
---
If you remove NPC stations, you remove null sec attack staging areas. Would make Omist and it’s ilk in Drone Regs practically untouchable... ohh wait. They already are.
---
When has ccp ever been iterative?
---
 You might wanna watch that scene again my dude 👉😎👉
---
new meta: ghost-riding cynos
---
As stated earlier, if you're active, you shouldn't be punished for being cloaky at all. Maybe a  forced decloak every x min hour sec or something like it. If you're at that box, you can easily warp off reset timer or what ever. This way, people can't just log in alt, come back from work and carry on as usual.
---
I'm pretty happy about this. Sure it means I might have wasted time having multiple cap pilots but most of them have skills in other areas, too (I'm terrible about being focused). I'll have more isk in my wallet now that I don't have to replace my current caps. and I can use that money fo buy ships I can actually feel good to welp.
---
The timing is also perfect, as I was about to spend north of a billion isk for new skills.
---
What a great time to be playing the game.
---
I didn't know I could teleport to any ship anywhere in eve, when do I unlock this?
---
You can fit a Falcon for 85k EHP with 80+ resists all around.
---
If a FAX hits grid soon after, that Falcon will be a real bitch to kill.
---
A Myrmidon is paid for in a few ticks. Anything beyond that is gravy.
---
Unfortunately no one can be held accountable in the same way they can irl, so most banks are doomed to fail due to insiders draining the accounts
---
This is satire ...right?
---
CCP is forcing people like you to put more effort into defending your assets than just slamming the cyno and clearing grid. Seems like the change is having the intended effect if that is what you think.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1356880257/
---
Dude has sat in placid and syndicate for years on death star towers with perm cynos up. Install tackling and killing people that way. 
---
Very specific pvp style
---
Just out of curiosity, why black ops? Seems like an odd choice to me. Anyone in the same boat?
---
what I can immediatly think is 
---
Pros: less cyno-baiting obviously, recon ships slightly more relevant, not having to worry about random subcap cynos opening up during engagements 
---
Cons: Any cyno ship will probably get instablapped in fleet fights as theyd be the top priority. Moving your own capital just got more expensive and complicated. RIP the wallets of jf pilots. If my understanding is correct the cheapest cyno ships for moving would then be the prospect and bombers? cyno chains just got a bit more expensive.
---
Cheers mate.
---
You could use cloaks just as effectively against PvPers as the PvPers use cloaks against the PvEers. Just that you don't want to, so you think they should be nerfed :)
---
Are there any channels where it's involving more than one person? Like a team, squad, corporation all doing something together?
---
Mining and exploration?
---
I thought it would be cool to see one person mine while another player pulls security, while someone is space trucking to pick up the load. I thought seeing how a well run operation works would be fun for me.
---
I'm especially interested in non combat gameplay.
---
Combat is a close second.
---
And here we see the real reason for the change, making ccp money by forcing all cyno alts to train more.
---
I mean, honestly, can we as Ameritnitvtake the ultimate blame for the strange scourge of Anime?? Japan in past years was a noble and honorable society of poets, artists, Samurai, etc. we go and drop two nukes on them and warped their DNA into this weird-ass cartoon shit you see now. 
---
Shame. Shame! SHAME!
---
Fax doesn't mean much in a fleet fight here as by the time it locks that Falcon after jumping in that Falcon will be dead.  DPS will have a couple second Head Start and when there's hundreds in Fleet that is too many to save an 80k EHP ship
---

That's interesting, Ill say hello one day :D
---
the people who are obscenely rich are the same people that this won't affect - just b/c I'm in Goonswarm, have 15 accounts that can all blops / dreadbomb / rorqual mine, and can single handedly adapt to this change doesn't mean EVERYONE FUCKING CAN. Everyone who supports this is being extremely EXTREMELY fucking selfish and not thinking about the average joe in the average joe alliance. It's either you're like me and just ride out the last 0s and 1s of the server or you're a self centered wannabe \~elite pvp\~ who literally needs a ship to be dismembered and castrated in order to get a kill with your \~elite cloaky ship\~ ~~b/c you're fucking awful at the game and don't know what the fuck you're doing~~ and completely ignore the entire 200,000 players that don't have this comfort or participate in this play style. Except I'm not riding it out I'm voicing my opinion for those who keep getting muffled out by the obnoxious echoe chamber of r/eve.
---
What makes your cyno5 better than my cyno4 rookie ship? Exactly, nothing. You are jumping a fricking jump freighter , if you don't have the space to bring some thousands of ozone with you for mid point cynos I'm not sure what you are doing. Nevermind most of lowsec has lo seeded within a few jumps
---
Is that what they are doing these days?
---
Just bridge the subcap fleet to the cyno beacon and warp to the tackled person as usual.
---
Exactly. People will just have a cyno recon in every krab system. So bombers might not kill the original target, but will at least get a 300m killmail on the recon.
---
80 ships as a pittance for null.
---
I at first thought they were able to light a cyno as well 😅
---
What? People use cyno ceptors all the time, if only to bring in the first cap with a cyno
---
When not banned, Jesus Rambo enjoys getting his beard caught in the letterbox and buying the pig while it’s still in the bag
---
They're about to not work as fine. No more bait cynos. Combat recons and blops only soon. So awesome. This is exactly what I wanted. Could not be more pleased.
---
Salt is real for these dipshits. I'm still playing
---
Did you forget cyno beacons exist?
---
I can't wait
---
Alex CTA for mass biomass is imminent. 
---
Delve will be open for business soon.
---
Slightly more skill points needed in somewhat dead-end skills compared to a bomber, though.
---
Unless you want to huff gas on the side, or something.
---
Incursion ships can shoot back?
---
Rofl those numbers aren't even close.
---
For groups that already dont use cynos at all (wh/subcap small gang)  this change is totally amazing i agree!
---
Imagine believing this
---
 。゜゜(´Ｏ\`) ゜゜。
---
just b/c they remove their stupidity doesn't mean we know it's still there
---
You do realize the point of blopsing on stuff isn't to fight, but to gank, right? They have NEVER been used to actually fight stuff. They arn't capitals, they arn't even close. They have less EHP than their T1 counterparts, roughly the same DPS, the same mobility as regular battleships but you say they have the mobility for rolling safes? That is ignorance in not knowing the ship. A battleship can easily be scanned, and if it had a 5 minute timer to re-cloak then every tom-dick-and harry could easily scan them down and grab tackle on every blops that gets dropped. Like everything else in the game, combat exploration, nomadic lifestyle, third party supercap selling etc it will go the way of the Dodo Bird with this "idea" of a 5 minute cloak timer. 
---
As for there not being a supercap umbrella, this change in the next month won't get rid of it by far. Groups that can, will adapt. The supercap umbrella won't be phased and it will still be in effect. All this does it make it slightly more difficult and create a need for even more alts while people are doing whatever it is that they are doing.
---
Why people are clinging to their expensive money printers is baffles all the way.
---
It is now going somewhere!
---
I thought they were trying to make you have more alts, just as you said on your post?
---
Very unpopular opinion thank you for having the bravery to post this here
---
Kick yourself (in game)
---
Right on brother
---
If CCP is serious about chaos, then resource depletion should be a coming change, and not just for null sec. Farming and shooting stuff should lead to less stuff to farm and shoot in the near term. You either wait for it to grow back or you go find more.
---
People mostly do logistics in Rorquals rather than JFs.
---
Hell yeah brother! Let it all burn
---
Well, that's a good way to have me unsub six of my accounts since cyno alts are no longer a thing.
---
An other option is keeping an eye on the combat anoms in a crowded highsec system and frag the frigs and destroyers there.
---
I'M ELITE, I'M PVP, I'M BRINGING SOLO BACK ^(but I don't have cyno 5 yet)

PLEASE switch Blops with the TC3 Covert Ops subsystems.  Allows for much more flexibility while still being a big commitment
---
Sounds great to me! Nullsec shouldn't be able to have a highspeed train straight from Jita any-fucking-way.

Stop going to jita when your 30 man carebear corp is war decced

---
A change that hurts big blocs more than little guys? Thats hella easy to find.
---
How about....we give ships that can fit covert cloaks the ability to turn their transpoder off, which hides all pilot information, both on grid and in esi for any kills they get.
---
That strikes at the nature of diplo agrements themselves and weakens the power of blue itslef, by allowing anonymous privateers to exist.
---
Safe dock/undock + cloak.
---
bro why don't you try to fight haw dreads, carriers, and other aids shit with nomens and nospreys
---
Well right now its a bunch of anecdotal evidence of people actually out pvping vs a guy with a spreadsheet that he's keeping secret so good luck with that one.
---
&gt;e point is that this is a nerf to active hunting of supers in nullsec, where the krabs can hide behind bubbled gates. Neither cyno hull is nullified.
---
Or, cloaky camp with bombers as before, warp to an off dscan safe and blops bridge the recon in to light the standard cyno
---
And dies to a stiff fart
---
frigates, not t2 frigates
---
Please don't tell me I'm in a corporation thats decked and that I had no idea.
---
No i'm not joking. The timer for hisec citadels can be so long that they can coast out of it by not paying the bill and then redec the instant the citadel is repaired they miss like a day of dec time from doing it.
---
spent those all training my vni alts into afk domis
---
I don't think anyone should be able to afk cloaked. Me either. 
---
Also you don't seem to realise you can't just camp and ambush a target during PvE, which is what you do for plenty of PvP. So no, you can't.
---
NuLl-SeC iS tHe ToP-tEiR oF gAmEpLay

6 minutes isn't allot of time to form up 100 subcaps

Leopards are prime targets everywhere. Don't bother with them.
---
are you suggesting I train my jf cynos into t3cs
---
Every suicide dread will come with a cyno recon...
---
It is basically a troll move at this point
---
it’s not even a good or well thought out change sadly
---
Sure the people who fly those ships will screech as loudly as possible to make it appear otherwise but the vast majority knows how short sighted it is
---
I'm so fucking happy to hear "AFK" metas are being patched out.
---
Get yourself an undock bookmark to warp to. That means get a fast ship, undock, and fly in a straight line with a MWD on. Further away the better.
---
I moved a titan from npc fountain to malpais over the first weekend of the blackout
---
it can be done
---
Lol been blowing up so many things in delve for years dude... Only thing feeding is that economic monthly report... Haha
---
He’s elite because he’s “making space dangerous” .  Such an ego stroking move by ccp lmao “i AM the dangerrrrr (ccp plz buff things to make me win) GRR YOURE NOT SAFE NOW IM DANGEROUS GRRR”
---
Do you use instant-dock, and instant-undock bookmarks?
---
If not, you are 100% at fault for all your loses.
---
unallocated skillpoints count towards that 5mil cap.
---
"Matterall saying what we are all thinking with a major change"  
---
Sounds more like he's just salty this won't hurt goons any more then all the other attempts to nerf us into the floor.
---
bro I didn't even render by the time I had blow up, chill the fuck out.
---
do share, I haven't looked at it in literally a year+. I just checked and that's basically the exact figures give or take with links applied and a t2 fit (not sure why I was counting links before). If you're just putting more money on it that's gonna be a solid ok.jpg from me chief.
---
We're talking about T3 SP loss and cynos.  Try to keep up.  But if you want cynos for your JFs just train into prospects you muppet.
---
You’d be AMAZED how many threads i saw on forums and here asking for killmarks on augmenteds and nerds to mining drone iis to try and force easy kills again
---
agreed.
---
I love how everyone was like "nope, they aren't smart enough to switch" two weeks later even olemca's like "welp no more excavators to fuck with GG."
---
A 6th fighter support unit for those dank ticks.
---
Something tells me you're not quite telling the truth here
---
Uhhhhh a rattlesnake worth 1 bil
---
No, it's specifically because we *remembered* that they exist that our permacyno is a thing.
---
The cyno beacon in GSF staging (mostly YA0-XJ in my time) has eternally been a source of hilarious lossmails. Only fools or the truly desperate would consider jumping to it.
---
If your first warning of a fleet that large is one of your rorquals getting tackled, you have already fucked up.
---
Why?  So they don't show in local?
---
Afk cloaky camping isn't a thing anymore, at least not in null.
---
Time to pack shit up and move to WH, things are about tot get heated, and I want to be on the side that will be having fun in this mess.
---
its not so much the brink tanked blops you need to worry about as much as it is the supers and titans that are either on grid or the other side of that cyno
---
You named a system, not a battle. Is english your primary language or are you just fucking retarded
---
I just want to make sure I can still ghostride with my rorqual
---
Carry on
---
guess we will have to stop using them as bait and actually use them for a change.
---
I bridge puts you at sun if the first cyno dies tho, so it depends on situation
---
It did take away from the atmosphere in wormholes when citadels were introduced. Something about sitting inside that safetybubble was super cozy, like an actual personal space. Also especially in wormholes it was much easier to see if there was someone home and what ships they had.
---
You have 30 seconds of invulnerability after you undock, assuming you don't change course or activate a module. Even my Potato to End All Potatoes machine renders me in that amount of time.
---
Lol ok, blackout + safelogging + covert bridge. A competent group you will see a warning 5 seconds before there are 100 bombers on you
---
lmao, okay.
---
Why?
---
I'm seeing a whole lot of "they moved my cheese" posts without much thought behind them.
---
Who have we even pushed out of nullsec in the last 3 years that wasn't NC., PL, or one of their ~~pets~~allies, much less *farmed out of existence*?
---
I'd wager the list is shorter than any of the other entities mentioned.
---
at that point just keep it on grid cloaked or something
---
How about eve does what every one MMO does, Disconnect inactive users after 45 minutes.
---
Hello again Plebius,
---
There is a counter to "bombers online"! Several ships equipped with the anti-bomb missile launcher or a small "protection" squad of your friends should be enough to deter small roaming pirate gangs. In my personal experience I haven't seen any group utilize the anti-bomb missile launchers yet, but I think when they do its going to be a real nuisance for black-ops groups.
---
Funny, they weren't during the last Dominion war. I wonder what changed?
---
Wish capital ships followed that logic.
---
If only there was an arbitrary number.  
---
It was 437k SP.  
---
It is now 2.5 million SP.  
---
Surely, a man with an SP farm understands those are different numbers.
---
I think we're talking past each other, I'm not saying that renting is good, I'm saying that the issue is more widely people who join huge blobs with no intention to socialize.
---
If I go to Pandemic Horde space and start ratting, I will get blown up by the locals. The way I can get past that is joining Pandemic Horde and agreeing to put 12% of all my income into the corp coffers, essentially paying them protection money not to destroy me. In most nullblobs there's little or no requirement to participate; joining halfway through a fleet will often get you the one pap you need for the month, so it's not like the average line member has much investment into the nullblob.
---
If I go to renter space and start ratting, I will also get blown up by the locals. The way I can get past that is by joining Brothers of Tangra (or INIT Associates, or LBFB, etc) and paying a few bil a month in rent. The only real difference here is that I can grow a corp in renter space and just use that space as a relatively safe place to make ISK (NC/landlord will show up to defend structures and sovereignty timers, and they sometimes drop to save Rorquals). Some renter corps do end up later claiming sov.
---
Obviously there are people in nullblobs who are very attached to those alliances, really buy into the narrative etc, but from what I've seen both in Goons and in Horde, there is a silent majority who are essentially renters. They show up to the bare minimum of fleets, and otherwise just krab all day accepting their taxes as a price not to get destroyed by the locals.
---
The problem stems from the fact that these people, whether they join Goons or rent, are always going to be attracted to what they see as the safest option (being far from hostiles and close to friendly supers), which just widens the gap between established groups and newcomers.
---
Adapt or leave.... a lot of people are leaving atm. This evening 20k connected when i login , it s fucking slow.
---
I too stand outside kmart and belt the hell out of people, the police  come, tazer me and leave so i do it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. No matter how unlikley it is an empire would tolerate these shenanigans in their major cities #glances slyly at china#
---
RIP cyno vigils
---
No, the present is now. The future is what happens after that.
---
I don't disagree that the math right now just doesn't justify it. My hope is for a serious cap/supercap shakeup that makes capital PvE just defunct, in which case defending subcap PvE-ers will become a necessity.
---
Why cloak the minokawa? Just keep it visible on grid to deter attacks
---
Blackout is the best thing ever, it made me to go back in HS to try out those Abyssal sites. I didn't know that they can provide you with such an excitement so yeah I can only say thanks CCP.
---
Wont go the way you think tho. Youll see in time.
---
What kinda of scrub didn't train cyno V when they were mapped for training JDC V?
---
I approve.
---
&gt; Also many costs in EVE do not scale, which automatically favors big groups.
---
Even if they did, it's easy enough to game them if costs become prohibitive, such as with an exponential increase in sov-related expenses with the number of systems/upgrades/Alliance members/etc, you just split off into more Alliances.
---
The only way to **possibly** hurt large orgs is fundamental changes (read: limitations) to the Standings system as it relates to standings between player organizations.
---
you're the one making a disjointed nonsensical argument but I guess I'm the muppet?
---
ok this is a fun game let's keep playing
---
No, what you're seeing is the *community* flagging the post enough times that the auto-moderator script triggers.
---
CCP didn't pull it, the community mass-reported it. It's great.
---
For the first month while rorqual's try to cope with the changes. Once people lose their second or third they will stop rorqual mining and super ratting, and then there are no real fight generators left outside of citadels and they are ***great*** for content.
---
That is hilarious. Thumbs up.
---
I smell shitpost
---
Increase risk with no increased reward, people stop doing it, peo9le  not doing things means less content going on.
---
rorq can panic, the fax can't and is an another target for anyone trying to kill a rorq
---
I have been pondering it so far. I have just switched out a load of things to train my JF cyno alts up to cov ops cyno. Prospect may take more time, its a pain and id love to have more notice to get things ready.   
---
I think this kills carrier ratting dead, most other things it won't impact them at least under the larger umbrellas as adapting won't be overly difficult. It may make surprise dreadbombs much much harder, and make it harder for capitals to just get on top of each other and fight point blank.   
---
It does remove all the fun of bait tanked "weak" ships like barges/porps etc.   
---
Will see even more bomber fleets though.   
---
Anyone rich/multiple accounts/lots of SP won't be impacted that much, anyone struggling to work their way up (esp anyone who has just gotten a carrier to rat with) is going to be sad/screwed over.   
---
Good time to get into producing force recons though.
---
Such a meanie. :P
---
Seriously give Squad a try. It's a great game, having played Bf2 and project reality for years I naturally love it
---
Whats quicker to train thou a bomber or a prospect.
---
Local is harmless unless someone reads it!
---
No they really didnt. Quite the opposite actually.
---
That one was harder sure. But Im fairly certain that most people knew that if theres a will, theres a way. Question is if its worth it.
---
Affecting it would ofc happen. But will it hit them harder than smaller groups, no it wont. And bot empires didnt implode, they just moved their bots.
---
The issue here is, you yourself have explained that you havent even been in a cap. So listening to you is like going to the dentist to get a hearttransplant, and you should know that you arent qualified. But you go ahead man, CCP listens more to you than me at this point.
---
Well that is likely the problem not the other way around.
---
Awesome. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
---
The fact that I don't care.
---
I mean..He knows The Mittani after all. :/
---
 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Ahh ok. So basically train up to 3mil and the use the extra sps
---
The max passive tank of those things are around 600 dps - T2 modules, T2 rigs (which no one actually uses on expendable 20m cyno ships), and max skills (which no one actually trains their cyno alts into). The EHP of those are about 12k ehp.
---
If you were to fit max buffer, you could get 65k out of a Nereus with a shield + structure tank, but those obviously dont passive tank a lot.
---
Asset safety I would bet. It seems Falcons "little" post wasnt just his opinions but rather a roadmap. Honestly, I think its time to get off the carousel.
---
And his transition to EveNews24 is complete.
---
It's the dead of summer right now, this is a historically slow period for almost every online ecosystems, including but not limited to games. Weather =/= climate

I had a similar experience, but I wasn't AFK. (Learning how to orca before taking it out to null). My issue was my damn overview didn't show trig ships, and I just set it like to weeks ago. Z-S needs to update their PvX views.
---
if the skill points are unalloctaed, aka on your char sheet they count, if they are unclaimed aka are in your redemption queue they don't count.
---
But after 5 mill you can’t train any more except for injecting or so events. So if it’s staying alpha long term then why not be patient for a greater end?
---
24 hours? Good Lord I'd quit the game if I had to rat this long just to pay for a ship that won't last 12 hours anyway
---
We're talking about in a save situation. You wouldn't have to keep cloaky cynos spread out across your entire region, you just have to keep cyno gens up and bridge a recon to it if something is tackled in that system.
---
For the longest time i didn't know that speed and trajectory did anything for combat. I thought it was all just rng based. When i learned that the way you fly matters i was really excited....
---
My friend still didn't care or understand ;)
---
Better have a shower
---
The dumbest take.
---
Oh my bad, I didn’t know that. Then yeah I guess inject away. :)
---
Lmao did it actually reach the limit?
---
Strawman, i never said top tier.... but when it comes to open PvP.... it is the best..... with 2nd being WH, and 3rd being LS
---
rhiload, but don’t expect to learn anything useful and he doesn’t upload much these days
---
quill18 just started an eve online starter guide
---
And still a minimum 6 mins to respond. What's the problem?
---
Matterall reminds me of that Movie Actress who was cool in the 90's. Now she is multiple times lifted, full of Botox, and bitter about all these new and hawt Movie Stars.
---
Matterall is literally Meg Ryan.
---
Could have sworn there was a "mother" in there. I stand corrected.
---
Sure it should, just like a cyno
---
i mean.. with half a brain you can already ''invade'' wormholes properly....
---
A drop bomber is about 500 dps assuming it's not polarized, 500x100 is 50k dps, I rat in a 1.2m ehp carrier. therefore I have 20 ish seconds from damage being applied to get fax support, it's a bit of a tight margin but far from impossible.
---
not on large scale, not when the inhabitants role the hole etc.
---
There arent that many corps bigger than yours in the game. But sure. And when you compare things you compare apples with apples and not with oranges. Compare to WH groups, Inner hell has 200 less chars than your "small touching medium" corp.
---
You dont live there, which entitles you to jack shit regarding how it is to actually live there. Its like people in my neighbouring city having opinions on my city just because they "interact" with it. 
---
Conquer what dude? Large parts of NS are empty. Doesnt require "effort", just some harry potters. 
---
You are delusional dude, honestly. But I mean, you arent the first one to just throw logic out the window whenever it suits you.
---
Aren't recons a fairly common in cyno for dread bombs anyways?
---
Are you a programmer? Have you considered the complicated code required to implement something like this? 
---
Why would CCP reprogram thousands of lines of code when they can just change 1 or 2... "ships that can fit cynos"
---
Pretending people won't react to a change is the only dumb take here, mate.
---
Good riddance bud ❤️
---
Correct me if  wrong but this is kinda unfair as eve uses star gates, and e:d doesnt. Kind of dramatically changes the technology needed to be invented when stargates get us there regardless. 
---
Maybe you could judge based on jump drive calculation but them ship size is a problem, capital ships vs frigate sized hulls.
---
Too complicated to implement and test. 
---
Too many unknown outcomes. 
---
Too drastic of a change.
---
ED is so boring, I regret putting 70 bucks into it
---
you failed at the first step by ''having half a brain'' then.
---
Well in eve they need jump gates because they can't fit jump drives in anything smaller than a battleship.
---
But why
---
Yes, dude, I do get that the bar (and SP requirements are higher).  That was never in dispute.
---
I also get that you are trying to move the goal posts with this last entry.
---
Please follow the thread from the top.  My position was that you are exaggerating the training times/cost now required due to slower training times than I would _practically_ expect from guys that run cyno's.  
---
Even after claiming you had adjusted to omega training times, I don't think you did .  
---
This position stands.  I hold that I have given sufficient evidence and reasoning to support this position.  
---
"It is now 2.5 million SP."
---
2 500 000 / 50 000 = 50 days of training.
---
Far cry from: 
---
"bomber - 116 days - 46 days to sit, 70 days for cyno 5m 34 mil for each ship, 3 mil for covert field gen, 2.5 mil sp, 5 injector of 4.0"
---
There's still something screwy with your math - I do think you made a mistake somewhere and are still looking at alpha training times of 25k SP/month.
---
I will rest here.  Peace dude.
---
Oh i wasn't sure which came first, star gates to solve distance or distance being solved so never needing jump drives. Nvm then
---
[I saw them shooting CONCORD.](https://i.imgur.com/KkNGDHm.jpg) &lt; proof
---
Retard thinks we use Discord.
---
You're the one talking about your 100 million SP cyno alts.
---
I don't buy it. Your computer isn't *that* slow.
---
&gt;I have just switched out a load of things to train my JF cyno alts up to cov ops cyno. 
---
Same, I was really concerned about this in the first five minutes, but thinking more about it I think it'll work out.  Community shared cyno fleets are likely dead.
---
&gt;I think this kills carrier ratting dead, 
---
I don't.  PvE is going to have to change, maybe, and there will be fewer ratters overall, but that just means an isk faucet slowing down. Not necessarily a bad thing.
---
&gt;make it harder for capitals to just get on top of each other and fight point blank.   
---
This is my biggest concern. It fundamentally changes large battles.  You can't expect a blops with a cyno lit to last on any field with hostile dreads.  Meaning the second cap fleet on grid is going to have to warp in.  It'll be... interesting.
---
&gt;It does remove all the fun of bait tanked "weak" ships like barges/porps etc.   
---
Nah, you just warp stuff in from out of dscan range.  
---
&gt;Anyone rich/multiple accounts/lots of SP 
---
Goons love to say this shit, and I rarely see evidence for it.
---
Happy birthday :) I'm winning at eve atm but I'm glad you get to enjoy this for your birthday, and with shit like this happening I'm getting ready to resub.
---
I agree that it can get boring, I enjoy playing it on and off, definitely don't regret buying.
---
Eve is hardly that much more interesting, as of late.
---
It will just make the Goku/100% fleets (AB bomber) fleets even more all-powerful.
---
I don't dispute that it will be entertaining, but a whole meta based on mass frig fleets exploiting obscure mechanisms isn't how I want the game to go. By all means make frigs important but not on their own.
---
Good God, please stop with the whining, use your time to adapt or find another game to play.
---
How long did it take, and how fast were u going?
---
&gt; since everybody with a capital has to buy them now (I'm sorry suckers but I love it
---
But I already had one rusting in my hangar ah ah ah
---
Is it possible to fix ur faction status like this?
---
LMFAO
---
It certainly affects the Rorqs less compared to ratting supers.
---
Wrong. If you chew away at the safety measures a botter has, you can pidgin-hole them into an easily monitored space and then ban what you can't patch out. You just sound like another pissed off botter who has to adjust his setup again. QQ
---
It is a cute trick but maybe I just overestimated you. Cause that wording pretty much excludes every group that is around simply by saying "no look, the are connected".
---
But I dont see you responding to how you could prove your initial point. So yet again, how convenient.
---
Am confused
---
What are you talking about?!
---
And this will help that. Yes it will be a pain in the but to do anything with capitals but now those roaming gangs know when response fleets are there to fight them versus when they are just going to get dropped on. Now they can actually run from cap drops while still taking fights instead of having to run from anything that can tank for 5 seconds against their fleet.
---
What if someone has literally no interest in flying "all the sub ships" ?
---
People make cap alts too. 
---
This really is an odd comment
---
Yeah and all your caps need to be ready immediately. You won't so much get away with drip feeding a few faxes in and then everything else as people log in their caps. The 'cyno window' will be critical.
---
Ah. Still, I suspect the OP of this thread has the right of it. There are likely a lot of Gallente Cruiser 5 characters that will be looking to serve a purpose now, since subcap ratting is basically extinct.
---
Any non-idiot group will put an in-line bubble between the beacon and target, which means a caught subcap or Carrier is likely going to be toast (or have an inhib onlined) by the time the Recon lands after bouncing celestials to avoid the bubble.
---
Easier to get volunteers in Recons in popular systems, people to supply their own, and possibly SRP losses incurred during a defense.
---
While that may he true to some extent not relying on gates isquite the advantage and there are definitely attempts to make it usable for smaller ships, but it seems the best new eden has been able to do is bridging.
---
R-word D:
---
maaa relikss
---
That's one failure of this plan IMHO. You make the game even more one-dimensional.
---
I fucking laughed so fucking hard at this.
---
The windows closing sound lel
---
I might be unemployed at some point. Why get a job to begin with?
---
Because I have bills to pay, that's why.
---
Sooo, like an ansiblex that works in j space? Is that what you mean?
---
Too many easy ways around it, like mouse macros. Used to do it in FFXIV when login queues were stupid long.
---
The only thing I can think of is make the module require fuel but that just feels bad for normal cloaking use.
---
Maybe make a deployable that pinpoints any cloaked ship in the system after a certain amount of time? Something that is easily seen?
---
I'm spitballing.
---
Escalating caps against bombers? That is just making AB bombers more all powerful against krabbers.
---
this is basically a cop out though, just because something is hard to code shouldn't be a reason for not making it so.  Didn't even read what this guy posted really, but lets say it was the PERFECT solution, BUT ITS HARD TO CODE shouldn't stop it from being implemented.
---
Yeeahhh ... soon after I finish JDC V.
---
Not very funny.  
---
There used to be a progression to the mining career: Venture to Procurer to Hulk to Rorqual with excavators.  
---
Since the blackout, it's regressed to Rorqual with T2 Mining (or in this case T1 Mining) Drones.  
---
After the cynopocalypse it will be back to Ventures and Procurers for mining.
---
bro how the fuck are you commenting on a deleted post, Like wtf? Fucking let it die, its my loss and my fault, cool. Now shut the fuck up and leave me alone.
---
I shamefully had to bite the bullet and buy it for my Revelation.
---
When jump drives first came out you'd just chain them up and jump across the galaxy and ever since then ccp has been trying to put the genie back in the bottle cause it's shit design
---
The official reply should just be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvM7av1o1Q
---
While I benefit from cloaky camping on a daily basis, I'd prefer that the meta shift in favor of active hunting.\*
---
(No, that doesn't mean I support whatever dumbass krab idea to nerf cloaks or campers is being floated at the moment.)
---
Being no fan of the biggest krab club, this hurts me.  They are organized, learnt lessons from wwb and maintain discipline.  They fully deserve top dog position.  Only matter of time until wizard hat pisses off the real brains behind the organisation and it implodes from within, just like the previous bee club.  Until then, train into bombers and enjoy day trips to Delve.
---
its not fake outrage i think, more misguided  out rage
---
The thread is good.
---
I endorse this product or service . 👍
---
Nah, just have the Empires respond to such a serious threat by hot-dropping a hundred NPC titans onto them.
---
Again, stop whining, use your time to adapt or go to a new game.
---
They think "small guy" gets more traction for their argument on Reddit, nothing more.
---
Yes and it will be a one way gate.
---
I think it comes down to perspective at that point. I love my faction and love their narrative, and I really enjoy the community. I participate in home defense often, which doesn't really get me paps. In the end, I need time to myself that isn't some junior FCs stupid drunk roam to welp to gather resources and protect the region. Strategic ops are great and all, but without a clear goal stratops are just boring bluster. I don't think you need to be out all the time 100% no brakes pvping to enjoy this game, and large blocs give you that option. Participate as much or as little as you want, within reason of course.
---
&gt; I think this kills carrier ratting dead
---
Are you sure it won't? I have been thinking about the same thing myself. First we had the changes to the anomaly spawn times. I don't know how much that might affect systems used by people that rat in carrier. Probably doesn't do much at all if spread out I'd imagine.
---
Then came the nerf to carrier application and being locked down when cycling your NSA. From what I've gathered these changes was more aimed towards the ship's role in PvP. At the same time nerfing what it can do when it comes to PvE content.
---
Fast forwards a bit and the local blackout comes into play, further nerfing carriers in a way. You might scout but what if there's already a cloaky in there with you? While cynos might save you carriers are still pretty squishy most of the time as they sacrifice their tank. Now you have the changes to anoms, carrier income and the removal of local. I wonder of these were all thought of, and how they work together to nerf it further. Rorquals can still panic, supers being supers tank more than a carrier do, giving defenders more time.
---
With the carriers already being nerfed in several ways when it comes to pure PvE removing the ability to cyno further gimps them. Only this time all other PVE caps are affected. With one of the differences being that Rorquals can still panic to buy itself more time to get a recon ready.
---
Yeah just form a 100 man subcap fleet in 5 minutes its that easy. Also a cloaked zealot might kill 1 or 2 bombers before its adc ran out then immediately die while costing as much as like 8 bombers
---
This is the best timeline
---
Arazu Decloaks.
---
Points you from 60km
---
Opens cyno
---
20 Orhtruses jump through
---
You burn 10km away from him.
---
You warp off.
---
"I invested 600m in this ship huehue" cries in local.
---
I like it because it gives blockade runners a role again.
---
What wormhole corps have the best pvp "culture"? In the sense that they undock appropriate fleets, and that they do it often?
---
And what are some k-space corps that try to do the same?
---
I've seen solo players which are very reactive and always undock something worthwhile to fight against, but they are not the most fun to play against because of how big an impact skills and implants have in 1v1s. You know their t1 frigs will always be faster or tank more. In groups this matter less just because it's less likely that everyone in the group is maxed out
---
Leopards
---
Check prices on DED loot, its already gone up. Some by as much as 50% last I checked. These guys dont really understand whats gonna happen in a couple of months.
---
Along with blackout, one of the best changes in recent years.
---
I'm still wondering why I would be salty? A cyno will still work. Only change is what ships that can use it. That ship class gonna make me even richer.
---
Sorry that you sucked so bad that you had to beg for everyone else to get nerfed though. 
---
My issue with this is there was fake lore reasons for the other changes. It is quite clear new changes are just them throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks.
---
Before blackout it was relatively safe with good intel channels and comprehensive blue lists. Not 100% safe but honestly sometimes safer than hi sec.
---
NOW? fuck no, blops can roam all of null with relative ease and god bless it. 
---
Get rid of the notion of safe space though, as a player you'll only be better for it.
---
What is ED?
---
It was the first thread to reach the limit that no-one knew about before that thread, or so I have heard.
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY UPVOTE
---
I mean, I'm just meme'ing over here. Was going to do a tie in that took his fisting remark as sexist, roll that into him being a rape fantasist, and take that straight into an accusation of pedophilia. However, I've lost interest 😞
---
No, hunters just want people to actually have to defend their shit without just dropping caps on literally everything because it’s completely stale gameplay.
---
It's why I traded my carrier for a rattlesnake. Bout to be rich for the end times.
---
Looks like not even bots.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Period_Basis/TN25-J#npc24
---
Horde discord is fucking bitter. Personally, I like it... both this change specifically and the overall willingness to experiment. Bring it on.
---
But /u/ericader
---
You have a few major entities that has done this. They own one or more regions with full infrastructure such as stations, jump gates, etc. With standing fleet and capital umbrellas that protect people making money.
---
Most of the bomber fleets I fly in don’t even run cloaks.
---
Lol tears.
---
What is "within range"? And who exactly do you expect to come help you in time? When 200 dreads drop on a super you don't exactly have seconds even to get a force recon over there to light an escalation cyno.
---
Honestly, I think we are seeing the end of an era here. These changes, and more will follow, will scare off alot of the people currently keeping the lights on. And people are saluting it.
---
I am loving these changes, black ops groups now have a real chance at creating havoc behind the front-lines.  Brilliant CCP, pls continue.
---
So it’s dangerous now. If a powerful group wanted to though could they theoretically monitor a region to avoid large scale conflicts and encourage trade or is this not possible?
---
"Final nail in the coffin." - I still laugh when I hear this regarding EvE dev.
---
give t3d covert ops subsystems the ability to light cynos plz. would solve many many problems this change now presents while still nerfing capital usage as ccp intended
---
More like because nobody wants to bother holding the space, and they know CVA isn't going to try to expand. I doubt anyone does it out of goodwill towards CVA.
---
Really, why dud blackout lead to record number of excavator kills then if they wanted fights? Blackout proved most people were looking for easy kills and thus us the culmination.
---
Why do pvpers think every target must be a soft? Why is it supposed to he baknced for 10 people to cone into my home and for me to have no advantage for being at home?
---
Knew I kept that SP handy for a reason.
---
