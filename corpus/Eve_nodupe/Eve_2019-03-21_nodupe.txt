Wow, you literally know nothing and don't realize it.

---
It will.
---
That’s a pretty fair point.
---

---
Maybe something that would be more functional with fighter controls on regular drones would be removing the q-click function to manually send them somewhere, but keep everything else the same. That would take away having to select them separately to your ship while still opening up wider options with individual control, like splitting ec-300s, without having to risk fucking up your own ships commands.
---
Either way cheers for the explanation, been a while since I used my carrier and I forgot about the control switch.

Ehh. Going pirate is an option. Benefits are shooting every1, loss is not having as much engagements on Gates and less content drivers.  You should try sitting in a Plex more often.  The bait opens up a lot of content.

I mean, why go for the salt of one Astero kill when you can farm the eternal salt of the original comment in this thread.
---
I mean on the surface what you are saying is right. It does sounds harsh... But then again if you can be this salty over losing a ship on test server... Who knows what he will do if he loses a expensive ship on tq... So in the end I think both in game comment and forum comment should be equally punished

Thats a pretty nickpicky thing to be such an asshole about.

Evil knievel got sponsors instead of insurance so rename insurance and have 3rd party interest groups provide sponsorship to capsuleers exploring the outer fringes and collecting data/points of interest they can use later hell decrease payout by 50% and skip paying for it

stop with this anti-semitism please

This would be the ideal situation. If the character was sold, a name change should be permissible. Additionally, there should be a marker in the employment history showing a change in ownership.

They held the demo on a wednesday during working hours for the entirety of North (and South) America. That cuts into your numbers pretty deeply.  
---
We could crowd source it too. Maybe generate the isk through some sort of entertainment, like games. Maybe use isk and predict how a prearranged fight might go down, then the winners get a lot back and losers lose their isk.
---
That could then build up a big fund and then sponsor pilots in game to do stuff. Man this seems like a *really* good idea

They were testing server tech, not client tech. The client is irrelevant.

I guess I don't understand how the scam worked. He told you it was valuable, and then you took his word at the value?
---
If the guy doesn't have a history of offenses CCP almost certainly just bans him from forums. He's not saying KYS at a major eve online convention on video, its a low profile random sperging. It's also not directed at an individual, but a group. it's an offense, but unfortunately not one worthy of a permaban. 
---
The op even half-jokingly talks about this because he'd just catch shit if he was caught being 100% serious. It's laughable even to him. All this points towards a slap on the wrist, perhaps a ban from the forums. Mid-tier offense

How lucrative are L5 missions? My corp are thinking of doing some but I'm not too sure about the rewards you get from them, as I've heard that they are both good money and not worth it from different sources.
---
Is it a case where a lot of the gains you get is in the form of LP rewards?
---
The one thing I will say about joining any alliance or large corp is to see if they have anyone willing to help people who want to fly solo and not just be another fleet member (not saying fleets are bad but roaming solo gives you a different kind of excitement).

Miners almost always ran more then one account, pvpers always did, multi accounts isn't anything new, even mission runners did. Plenty of people were running two accounts 10-12 years ago, basically when salvage came in, most of the mission runners of added a salvage alt, with the old data core agents making it quite profitable, and it expanded from there. Those then evolved into cyno and PI alts, and then it took off for that playerbase.
---
I got Estamel torp launchers and a maxed out BCU for you mail me.
---
Roaming solo is good, but imo small man gangs of 3-10 are the best. 
---
Especially if you take fights vs the odds.
---
Nice post. Let's do this again tomorrow.
---
Thanks a bunch man, any chance I could steal a fit?
---
So let's see... to take a brand new character and get them Cyno I, they need 211k SP. That's 3x Small Injectors, worth ~180m each / 540m total. $10 will buy you 240 PLEX, worth 4m each / 960m total. So you can almost buy 2x Cyno alts for $10.
---
To get a brand new alt into a CovOps frig, as OP suggested... you'd need 993k SP, requiring 1 Large (~1b) and 5 Small Injectors (900m), for a total of 1.9b ISK. $20 buys you 500 PLEX worth 2b. So OP's suggestion to have a fresh faced Science alt automatically know CovOps frigs is worth $20 / 2bil ISK.
---
For $30 bucks, you can buy a brand new CovOps frig flying Cyno alt and have ISK left over. If $30 is "IRL rich ppl" then maybe you should get an education and a better job. =)
---
I 100% opposed to the idea of name changes.
---
You’re your character’s reflection. You did what you did, you own it.
---
EVE is the universe of consequences. You don’t weasel out because you can’t live with the consequences of your actions.

True but there's something satisfying about knowing how to take care of yourself in hostile areas and come out on top rather than panicking and dying to something silly. Not trying to make fleets sound bad just don't like people getting clubbed over and over again and instead of learning and fighting back they continue to be punching bags.

Insurance expires after 90 days. So those insurers should still make a profit as long as enough insured ships survive 90 days so they're taking in more than paying out.

---
Go back to your own ruined EVE and leave ours if you do not wish to fight for your place in it
---
True, but the game mechanics don't use insurance that way at least. If it was something where there was some assessment of risk for that person/corp/alliance/hull - and the payout is based off how much other people are putting into the pot, that'd be cool. Like if everybody starts insurance frauding I'd expect there to be less payout, but that isn't what happens.
---
But instead we just have a flat boring game mechanic.
---
I did kinda like shit back in the day when your starting skills and attributes depended on your race, bloodline and other things you picked when you had no idea what you were doing.
---
It would have been nice if they had just balanced that out a bit instead of making everyone the same.
---
But the war declaration about TEST does not mean that. Highfalutin

I don't understand this at all but I appreciate the inclusion of Winnie the Pooh at the end lol

bad management decision then, they wanted 10k, they hyped it and shilled it, and it only got 3k at peak and had many crashes and lagspikes
---
sad!
---
That's the funniest joke I've ever heard, so let's try and see if the Chinese people will disappear.
---
every single thing in that block of text will boot you off the internet(and maybe report you to the CCP) if you're in mainland china
---
If they did that, someone like wheniaminspace would probably game the system. 
---
&gt;Which are that eve's subscribed account number and this stress test's total client number are completely different in every way and cannot be compared.
---
you can compare different things, that's the point of comparison retard.
---
you sound like a pseudo intellectual
---
I like name changes! Much better than logistics buff and nano nerf long time ago, that change made worst impact on the game.
---
Come on now. Every single thing? Even Winnie the Pooh?
---
I am on the land of China, but your thoughts are too backward, I have not disappeared.
---
It's nothing personal, you're just close by, and you bring fun fights.
---
"dammit people should have to pay 30$ for a cyno alt!!!!"
---
Ffs .
---
except the system would close in naturally, because it'd be market driven, rather than a flat payout.
---
Good to see evil pandas out there shooting up the galaxy. Keep it up.
---
They should have done this long time ago already. Raise the PLEX and lower the subs, I think it would have worked out for them much better, and be better for the game at the same time since it will be more expensive to multibox and bot.
---
Don't you understand? They always put themselves at the moral high point to declare war.
---
I think you are confusing CCP's projects with partner projects. CPP's partnership projects have been very good. Specifically with INTEL and nVIDIA. 
---
Every time I update the game, I log in to reddit.
---
As a salt mine myself, generally the more angry someone the more problems they have IRL. I hope he figures his life out, but also yes ban. 
---
yea
---
this entire thread proves that even when assets are worth absolutely nothing due to infinite botting, rorquals and CCP incompetence, people are still going to be insanely invested lmao.
---
What does the Chinese government have against Winnie the Pooh?
---
taiwan #1
---
the FRAT CEO had multiple characters banned for RMT, the only right side is the side fighting FRAT.

If you are happy, there is no doubt that the two sides are one family. Mocking about national events is a sign of your inability. Because every country has your pain.
---
What a joke, it's the same exact story as Y-2 and all the other failed battles that went on during that time. 5-6 years later, same old, same old.

lol
---
In fact, we don't know what's wrong with Winnie. Many of us like it.
---
I have a stupid last name on eve I'd love to remove it.
---
That is true about their niches, but lets see what comes down the pipeline sorta speak. Hopefully some of the shortcomings will be plugged up. I would especially like to see a better performing Vedmak as I don't care too much for frigates.
---
Right now the Kiki and Drekavac are very nice for small scale PvP, the Damavik, Vedmak not so much, the Leshak is kinda OK if it gets to spool up.
---
For PvE, the Vedmak is actually OK, not great but OK, the Drekavac does very well, the Leshak not so good as it is outperformed by other faction battleships, and the Demavik sucks major ass.
---
Why so salty? Butthurt people have more isk than you?
---
FYI skill farming is no longer profitable and probably won't be any time soon.
---
Evil white people unite to persecute the Chinese, you are the hope of the Chinese?
---
I had a dood cum across my desk that was only a few days old and had legit injected into a decent subcap pilot. 
---
Injecting is what it is, but no new bro is ganna get such a nice skill layout not knowing what he’s doing. Turns out he was a huge shitler in Horde, got banned, extracted and made a new account. 
---
They can run and they can hide, but we gon find you. 
---
The people of the world are friendly and there is no evil. I am not the hope of the Chinese either. Every Chinese is our hope.
---
i think it's hilarious, but messed up that it's blocked in china from what i hear
---
No, I personally think Injectors are total crap. And people should have to wait and train the good old fashioned way.
---
To equip a Cyno, it takes 10 days of training.
---
To get into a CovOps frig, it takes 45 days of training.
---
So you could have that "brand new" CovOp flying Cyno alt in 55 days. And you'd have almost 2 months of playtime to help learn the game while you're at it.
---
But I still don't think we should be giving brand new characters 2 months / 2bil ISK worth of free stuff. Especially since it's stuff they won't know how to use.
---
It is just a narrative to drum up support. Don't worry too much about it. TEST is just like everyone else in Eve who was looking for the next big conflict.
---
I see pictures, but that's nothing. We often make facial packs about this man, just like we make Putin's facial packs.
---
Yes, but much like with cap proliferation, no where near to this scale. Its not that it has or has not been in the game its the scale of it that is currently just fucked beyond reason.
---
I'm partial to alliance logos or paint schemes on like a set of ships.  (Some stupid amount of Plex for super alliance) getting swarmed by olive green and yellow nyx fleet with bee logos.  Or hot dropped by some blue and silver Titans with a sharp dress Trex logo on the side. Of course cost would be set by number of ship types the skins were made for and number of pilots in the alliance.  Basically try to do it so that it's pay for the artwork being done by the magicians at ccp
---
.  
---
Lol only if you like to be awoxed
---
Of course I know, but Chinese players can't log in to reddit very often. I think we need to let the deceived know something.
---
You might be ready for the war with TEST, but I'm not sure you are ready for the war with Reddit.
---
Really, the finance director of GOONS is also named. What does that mean? And why do you prohibit Chinese pilots from leaving 1DQ Galaxy Support?
---
You don't want to join "the blue donut" but you do want to stay in highsec, which is essentially blue donut turned up to 11? You really can't make money doing any kind of industry in highsec, because of ~~people~~ idiots who sell below cost, thinking "I mined it myself so it's free".

"only vets with 30$ to spare deserve instant cyno alts"

Thrashers ac or arty or coercer do well in gangs. So do rail cormorants.
---
I name all my ships PEN15. So if you scan me down you’re searching for my cock. 
---
Good on you for owning up to the loss.
---
For me, I don't often log on to this site. But I'll come up when I'm free.
---
hah,i know, frt always said to chinese player(because they dont use International web)，goons/test/or any other internationel alliances are hypocritical and evil, they try to use chinese and build a white universe。
---
Nationalism is your foundation。
---
They’re really annoying but effective. Now staying power but the neuts will fuck over a ton of things.
---
That would require a huge and sudden subbing with cash by a playerbase that thinks it’s some warped badge of honor to work more in a video game than irl to pay for a video game that would literally require working 16 hours for minimum wage to sub for a year. 
---
BUT IF THE WIZZARD CAN TELL PEOPLE TO DO IT! IT MUST BE FINE RIGHT! RRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yep, sounds about right.
---
"Pay 2 Win" in that case. You want to skip the 2 months of training for your hotdrop alt, then you pay the company to fast forward.
---
Not sure why you find this difficult to understand. Most games these days have "microtransactions". CCP just skipped the "micro" part a bit.
---
Does $30 cripple your budget? Have you looked into welfare and community outreach programs? Are you Reddit'ing on the McDonald's wifi?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DiK5z3pbXgI
---
Just have cynos in 0.1 and 0.2? But youd ha e to look at the effects on other ppl like jf pilots etc. Could be a big knockon effect
---
Really ? And how will these devs stay being employed when this shit is getting more and more people to stop logging in, or in some cases entirely quitting the game ? You think they get paid for PLEX the moment they use it ? I got news for you, that PLEX they use has already been paid for often long time ago with the money already spent and gone. You think all those SP farmers, Rorq, VNI alts etc. are just gonna dig into their pockets and suddenly switch to paying subs or buy PLEX themselves for each and every of their accounts and seed the market ?
---
 Nationalism is  not our foundation 。We do not have any nationalism. Every pilot is welcome to join us. Because Chinese people are a very inclusive group, but no matter which country you are, you will have some beliefs that can not be violated. If you're a believer, you'll understand what I'm going to say.
---
fuck off retard
---
First off, some people enjoy the narrative part of the game.  It's like watching sci-fi on TV, except that you're in it.  I get that not everyone enjoys that, but some of us do at different levels.
---
Test, as an alliance, is probably more into the narrative then most alliances, and that's why I enjoy being in Test.
---
Secondly (getting back to the narrative), Origin did break the NIP.  I don't think they intended to, I just don't think they considered all the consequences of their actions.
---
Test honors our agreements. It's kinda our thing.  We sometimes honor agreements even when it probably hurts us.
---
However, we also enforce our agreements.  We can't really honor agreements if people are going to take advantage of that by not holding up their end.
---
So if you're feeling some ways about the NIP ending a week early, I can understand that, but your issue is with the dudes who broke the terms of the NIP, not Test.
---
Then maybe you should get a job instead of playing a video game. The amount of time you're going to spend trying to grind out a plex at 3m/hr in the most retard mining setup imaginable is going to become your entire life.
---
&gt;not knowing the difference between something that matters and random text on the internet
---
not everyone knows the difference
---
who do you think you're going to fool with blatant lies?
---
no FW in derelik pls
---
Except gold doesn't permamently disappear. It just changes hands but stays either hoarded by someone else or put back on the market at a markup at a later date. PLEX disappears at an increasing scale.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I like it, too.
---
The declaration I saw declared that the HK Alliance had attacked your buildings. In fact, they also attacked our buildings, not what we call“莫须有”in Chinese.
---
In fact, it's just that you want to go to war. It's not that you broke NIP.
---
In my opinion, racial discrimination is more serious in some people.
---
&gt;In fact, it's just that you want to go to war. It's not that you broke NIP.
---
Well fuck yeah we want to go to war.  It's funnest part of the game, especially if you have a good narrative.
---
Yes, it's so refreshing. Why do you need to hide and stand on the moral high ground?
---
no, they don't. but CCP in this case HAS determined the line, and deleted his comments, and presumably banned this sad sack of trash
---
I like you, you seem nice. I hope we get to shoot each other in the face and be friends. Please excuse in advance my horrible Mandarin.

important safety tip, thanks
---
i have the worst alt names
---
please for fuck sakes bring this update i hate my char names
---
they werent even meant to be useful, they were just for shits and giggles cause of the galaxy pack sales.
---
now they're actually fucking useful.
---
Most highsec carebears aren't too far from a breakdown like this. One gank. Tell them they should have bought a permit. Tell them that they should have known a permit was required beforehand. Tell them that there will be no reimbursement and their loot will be sold off to pay for gank losses with no credit applied. Demand 10m ISK. Raise it to 30m when they argue. Tell them that they're playing the game wrong / wrong game.
---
Some will. On the flipside, those that are leaving now because of all this multi everything bullshit will remain in the game and become new customers. There will be some downturn before it all switches and balances itself out. But the people that will quit because of PLEX price for their Rorq alts, or SP farms etc. Good Riddance. 
---
Newbs starting out in HS &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rorq alts, bots, SP farmers  10000x over.
---
*chuckle*
---
It sucks that you fell for it but you know what place you came back to. It looks different, it behaves differently, there’s tons of new features, but it’s stil the same kind of animal.
---
Don’t fret about it, you’ll make another billion in no time.
---
Welcome back!
---
well theres a difference between salt and toxic fuckery
---
Thanks guys.I also hope to have a good game experience and more friends. This is our EVE.
---
I know our curse fleet was called "chinese beat 10 white nations " on chinese youtube,its just a small fleet!
---
Frt use every chance to  make chinese player hate other culture(even you receive Origin,they are stupid),you are the sovereign state for other china guys, shame.
---
Wow r u mad?
---
Don't forget he ruins all of our fleet roams, bad luck charm Bluedagger 
---
Dood I ain't the one suggesting this.
---
I don't hate frt, i just fight to be fighting (such is the way of eve.) But based on your responses in this thread i'm sure you could convince me to hate them.
---
Because it's what we do. It's kinda our thing.  We role play good guys.
---
Yes! And, the game should start with more ISK! Like, you shouldn’t even have to do anything to get it, really, it should just appear in your wallet so you don’t have to waste any time earning it. And while we’re at it, why do we even need SP anyway? They should just do away with it altogether and let everyone fly everything without having to waste time learning how to fly effectively. I mean, do the devs even game, bro?
---
It became acceptable shortly after September 1993, when AOL opened the floodgates, and it's been acceptable ever since.
---
China numba 4
---
The high ground advantage is an important strategic concept
---
I had nothing to do with it, I've just seen this stuff before. test server people are really fucking weird and generate crazy drama pretty regularly.
---
Fighting for the sake of fighting, such as fighting for soldiers, does not need to consider other things, just fighting?
---
You should think it over.
---
They've added:  
---
\- 4 Attack BCs (this might been before you left)
---
\- 4 T1 Destroyers
---
\- 4 T2 Command Destroyers
---
\- 3 T1/T2 Mining Frigates
---
\- 4 T2 Logistics Frigates
---
\- 4 Navy Battlecruisers
---
\- 4 T3 Destroyers
---
\- 1 Bowhead
---
\- 1 Luxury Yacht
---
\- 4 Navy EWAR Frigates
---
\- 3 SoCT ships (Destroyer, BC, and BS)
---
\- 4 Concord ships (a Covert Ops, Recon, Flag Cruiser, and BLOPs BS)
---
\- 3 Mordu's Legion ships (Frigate, Cruiser, and BS)
---
\- 3 Sisters of Eve ships (Frigate, Cruiser, and BS)
---
\- 4 "New" Force Auxiliaries (FAX) (basically old triage on a new hull)
---
\- 7 Triglavian ships (Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, T1/T2 Logistics, BC, and BS)
---
\- 1 Sansha Supercarrier (SC)
---
\- 1 Porpoise (mining support)
---
\- 3 Pirate Dreadnaughts
---
\- 2 Pirate FAX
---
\- 1 Pirate SC
---
\- 3 Pirate Titans
---
Total: 68 New ships
---
While not new, its worth mentioning they've also re balanced some other ships to entirely new purposes that essentially just make them new ships with old models (like T1 logistics). However that requires digging through patch notes.
---
ou should see what the upper floors are saying.
---
you aren't quite getting the point here. there's a certain level of decorum and standards that is expected on CCP's domain. they literally have the line, called terms of service, and this guy went full wackadoo and not only crossed it but left it in the dust. 
---
salt is salt, this is something else. 
---
Yes, basically all the isk is in the LP and that's where the pain in the ass part comes in is converting all that LP to isk.
---
With pulling alts and just running the blitzable ones with a carrier you're looking at about 500 mill an hour. 
---
The alternative to running those would be blitzing burners which should be up in the same range of isk/hour but you can do it in high sec. Or if your corp can provide some safety you can do this in NPC null for probably double the isk/hour.
---
&gt;I know our curse fleet was called "chinese beat 10 white nations " on chinese youtube,its just a small fleet!

&gt;  
---
&gt;Frt use every chance to  make chinese player hate other culture(even you receive Origin,they are stupid),you are the sovereign state for other china guys, shame.
---
Sorry, my English is not good enough to understand these sentences. I just want to say that the Chinese do not hate any ethnic group because they are respectable.
---
No, but you're the one saying that $30 is too much, and only "IRL rich ppl" could afford it. =)
---
Regionlock China
---
Hmmmm, I just had a thought, when the multi krabs and bots and SP farmers start quitting and screeching on forums, I'll send them some screenshots of my plex vault along with some nice emoji and possibly some cool memes
---
*Scripts in ships
---
his eyes open
---
Plex farming is probably the next thing they target based on how much wealth a few people are stocked with. 
---
Depends on who you ask. The north. Maybe a day of non stop. The south? Couple hours? Olmeca? Infinity. 
---
In all seriousness. A carrier makes 90-150m an hour, though they are being nerfed in a few weeks so thatll go down. This also doesnt take into account fighters lost. 
---
I don't need to hear what the upper floors are saying. I just need to hear what to shoot so i can press F1.
---
There are too many scripts in the universe, and we're going to destroy them, but they're always in an overtime umbrella.
---
I have a bad impression of frt。
---
Due to some reason,i think they showing different attitudes to chinese and foreigner.They behave friendly and  tolerant on reddit, but when they go back to china LAN, they  propagated eve is the game,that chinese fight together against foreigners.
---
Some russian corps said this shit to me,too. Now they all died.
---
I dont trust you,between Lagacy and frt, i rather support Lagacy.
---
is this the best CN could send to try to use diplomacy to avoid a terrible defeat at the hands of the rest of the world?
---
Infinity.
---
Of course not. We never fear. It's just that I personally feel uncomfortable about some of the things that the TEST Alliance has described
---
&gt; The majority of the Plex are at 544 to 550m, only 24 at 580m after that the sky is the limit. I didn't checked the other hubs but i guess it looks similar.
---
ooof
---
why was it you that wrote it? if so enjoy your ban. if not? no, not mad bro. someone has to say "that's too far" at some point. there's being salty and then there's being a shit human being.
---
looks like logi helped a lot
---
&gt; finance director of GOONS is also named
---
lol are you talking about nolak, the guy who got banned recently?
---
&gt;\#CCPleaseSALE
---
No thanks. Time for Rorq alts, SP farmers, Cap alts, all that sorta shit alts to filter themselves out.
---
Would a history tab including any past name changes not satisfy you?
---
there is lots of place to do that, this is a sandbox environment, the space is there.
---
It is true, bad for them in long term, but if some botters that run omega see it rising with no end in site and they are getting low on their stockpiles to run all their shit, they may buy to give themselves some short term operational leeway.
---
Because in fact, it's you who are going to fight us. We were forced to fight.
---
Welcome to visit China. Maybe you can get different feelings.We never hate any race, but we fight back against war or unfriendly opponents.
---
&gt;FRT has no racial discrimination
---
Hey man - it's just internet spaceships. We don't actually disrespect you folks IRL, and certainly not for where you are from or what color your skin is. All love, brother (no homo)
---
Thanks! That's the one!
---
You can look at other responses. Many people are talking about this.
---
A) nolak wasn't the finance director he was a really rich guy who gave out loans, B) he was blacklisted the second the ban news came out C) the FRAT CEO is still the same guy who got banned for cheating....
---
I'm saying it's dumb for that to be the barrier to A cyno alt.
---
Money and time shouldnt be barriers , effort probably should be.
---
Anyone actually checked PLEX seed data for 1DQ ? If so it might also be one of their hoarders or whales, they certainly do not lack in those. But on the flipside, if prices at 1DQ go enough below prices at Jita / Forge, then its just a matter of time before some young enterprising goons buy it, stick it into their plex vault, clone jump to Jita and sell there for a nice healthy profit. And am willing to bet there are many young enterprising goons... 
---
&gt;  I honestly wish they had just removed insurance
---
Stop right there.
---
Remove insurance.
---
So is CSM really just an idea panel for microtrans shit people might buy?
---
No
---
If there’s a history tab, what’s the point in changing your name?
---
Is that right? When did he step down?
---
I'm sure - people might post stupid shit in local or on reddit, but I'm saying, *outside of the internet + spaceships*, all that stuff is bs. I think for the most part none of us actually believe some of the online shit, it is really part of the game.
---
Or for non poors. Money.
---
So long as the history is visible and easily searchable and there are reasonable limits on frequency. It’s not like your main’s name is plastered on all your alts so everyone knows who you are, so it’s not really a loss of much in my book.
---
So basically, the report function worked and there was no need to come to reddit about it, as the system was already in place to handle this perceived issue?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
wat?
---
It was more so that our fleet support stuff did their job. Our ECM drones, Damps and Neuts were on their logi for most of the fight, split across their two guardians. So their rep logi was the one doing most of the repping it seemed because once they lost the Loki they disengaged.
---
In the video, you can see one of our logi pilots with their ECM drones all over him instead of split between the two. So it only took a few smart bombs to wipe out their jam drones. 
---
At the start of the fight our fleets both had very similar logi so were evenly matched. As the fight progressed I had tried to call targets so that once their ships started to catch reps, we switched over to another.
---
The total Gila HP of 2 medium drones now is roughly just under HP of a full flight of 5 heavies from regular drone ships. Given mediums have lower sig then heavies, this change puts them roughly equal, give or take a bit per different drone types.
---
The fucking irony of this statement.
---
Fun fact....our EVE is also fucking shit.
---
Too late to start trying to implement Experience Points into the game.
---
Effort is learning how to play the game well.
---
But SP is just a matter of time, or affording the Injectors these days. Before they added Injectors, plenty of folks would use Evemon to schedule when they needed to log in, just long enough to reload their skill queue (or load the next skill before there was a queue). Then they log out and go play something else, while the SP racks up all on its own.
---
I'm glad that the soothing tones of "Tanuk Tanuk" are universal across languages.  
---
This is typical stereotyping. 
---
He never was an officer, much less alliance finance lead....
---
What really sucks is that while Gilas got nerfed for Abyss, the turret ships are still fucked up, they didn't buff any. And they ddin't have to make them OP in PvP or anywhere outside of AByss space, jsut add some really small bonuses to Abyss weather effects. That is all that is needed so the meta shifts a bit.
---
Chinese human rights violations? Incredible censorship that requires you use a vpn to access the tranquility server? I'll believe China is super inclusive when winnie the pooh steps down and  quits his belt and road program.
---
or just suicide the ganker and watch the ganker get salty asf
---
Yeah people need to realize they take offense. No one 'gives' offense.
---
'I take offense to that and I blame everyone else for my choice to do that' mentality is unfortunately a sign of the weak minded people that softening centres (aka schools) have been churning out for the last 15-20 years.
---
Basically, I thought you could sell the blueprints on the market, which they held a higher value than what people are actually going to pay for them in contract.
---
Then they shouldn't be on the internet unsupervised,
---
Thanks bud.
---
Glad you cleared all that up.
---
No ganker worth his *salt* would complain if you managed that. He'd congratulate you on your success and willingness to embrace PvP.
---
I think you are the one who should reconsider given what the game is about. 
---
Then let CCP deal with it. Stop trying to be the self appointed thought police.
---
TEST Bot ,best Bot. 
---
Nice
---
Whos line?
---
you cannot, humble and GMG give you codes that the eve website will reject.
---
there is a way to double up via steam, but that requires having a steam-based eve account first.

please continue to buy into this pump and dump

Its kinds scary how he always knows when we talk about him...

I am 100% for name changes, charge 2000 plex for it or something idc

I would say around a day non stop, and the carrier nerf will not reduce ratting ticks by much as long as the person flying it knows what they are doing 
---
PLEX: what if some people needed to eat gold to live?
---
Anyone else remember when someone saying "kys" wasn't worth posting or banning for... the community and game really went downhill 2016 tbh
---
Im not sure if a upvote or downvote is needed. Upvote as I agree with you, ban the welp. But downvote as to discourage it.  Send halp.
---
Probably all just being moved over to Goon space. 
---
What better way for a coalition to finally "win" EVE than to use their massive economic might to cut off the way many of their opponents fund their subscriptions (and their multiboxing accounts for making income).
---
They don't even have to sustain it forever. Just wait for most people to quit the game because they can't afford it. 
---
But the wizard hat.
---
&gt; I had a dood cum across my desk
---
Are we not doing phrasing any more?
---
Excuse me sir, who are g00nz?
---
It effectively does when you use it in Electronics, Chemical Plants, and Artistic Works.  
---
Just like PLEX, Gold has intrinsic value and is easily portable.  Dr. Eggnog designed Eve's whole PLEX economy around this theory. 
---
[Also relevant] (https://youtu.be/0fX8Qdj0iHk)
---
:) How many kills do you have in an AT ship harly? 
---
They want something that sounds better than the half-assed decade old meme name they came up with before they were invested in the game?
---
Also not an option.
---
Pretty sure there's been quite a few instances of them bending the rules of those tos agreements. Not saying what he said was acceptable, but it's not exactly out of the ordinary for the internet, and certainly not in eve. Maybe doing it on the official forums was a bit dumb of him, but I would bet he would get away with it most other places.
---
Same, also have way too many skins now to ever reroll.
---
Do you want to spend your time fishing through old aliases to double check people? I don't.
---
Honestly no but many people will suggest caldari as their starting location is the closest to the biggest trade hub of the game
---
enjoy that freedom while you can, before US gov starts exposing "toxic trolls" real life identities to, oust the toxicity out :)
---
It definetly worked
---
I wouldn't mind seeing the option to toggle between different insignia on skins in general.  Give players the option to choose between the different empires and NPC pirate factions, and their corp or alliance logo.
---
Not really, that gold is not the same. Industrial grade gold is quite different coming straight from the foundries, it is not your 18k or 14k bullion or jewelry grade investment gold. The only thing the alloys used for those applications have in common is that the ore itself ultimately comes from same mining sites, but that's it. Also, while technically remelting and reusing gold is feasable, it is impractical to do so to the point that it has never been done in history except some very small instances that are not strong enough to even nudge the markets in any direction whatsoever.
---
Make it like the resculpt certificate - where it's not going to break the bank, but it's also not something you're going to do after every other fleet.
---
Find a good null home. Without doing so, your options are pretty limited. I recently did and it really opened the game up for me.
---
It seems that we don't need VPN to log on to a quiet server, just because the server is too far away and needs to be accelerated, otherwise the delay is very high.
---
I want something better than what I came up with :-).
---
However, you should by now have a bit more sophistication than to choose a stupid name. “N00bman46” really...
---
I wanted to put more thought into my user name but I also wanted to play so desperately that I just made something up that was believable.
---
The interface should make that clear: "that name you choose today will be your name 10 years from now. You’re sure this is going to still sound good to you?"
---
run dens i think it is?
---
The amount of plex brought /sold is still on line with all the other days/month, it's the amount of plex put into market that dropped significantly 
---
Find a good null home. Without doing so, your options are pretty limited. I recently did and it really opened the game up for me. Sure, you'll get blown up here and there but you'll also have the opportunity to do some damage yourself. Besides, the increase in income has more than offset the cost of whelping ships etc.
---
Unfortunately, my news is different from yours. One thing, however, is that we were banned, just like this member, because of the joint and several liability of others'RMT.
---
With a regular carrier I made 40m isk per tick, so about 120m an hour if perfectly done and no neutrals roll through forcing me to dock up. Realistically probably more like 100m isk per hour on average. Currently it's close to 2b isk to Plex an account so you are looking at a good 20hrs.
---
Cool, lets push eve further into "lol I can be a cunt and face no consequences" territory. Gotta make that sand from sandbox non-gmo gluten-free organic version for modern consumer 
---
I honestly don’t get how problematic people’s lives can be. I can also be a bit of a salt mine, but it never goes beyond the useful “FUCK YOU” and “KYS” and that sort of stuff... and I have irl problems(anxiety, school, etc) and of that’s what I get from those problems... and hell, if the guy I’m pissed at is chill and nice, I might calm down pretty quick and might make friends with them which is pretty neat... but anyway, then what is happening to these people to make them this pissed that they say this sort of stuff?
---
Not sure if it counts but I always imagine rorqual exhaust smells like the exhaust from those propane fueled fort lifts.   Where’s my warehouse guys!?
---
 
---
&gt;I just returned from a 7 year hiatus, and I was shocked that they really haven’t added many new ships to the game. Is there any news on them adding some new ships further on down the line?  
---
&gt;Unrelated to the caption, I also think they need to take a look at a rework of the games audio since I think it is a bit lackluster in 2019.
---
Dude ....
---
Trig ships. Trig ships .... Trig ships !!!!!! fuck all the other ones.
---
Different strokes man idk 
---
You're a crybaby if that gets to you. Downvote away. 
---
&gt; after you grief someone
---
they're usually the ones trying to "grief" him and got baited. fair play right?
---
&gt; can't afford a subscription
---
Seriously if anyone is spending dozens of hours a month grinding isk in eve because they *can't afford* to subscribe, they need to quit eve and sell their computer. You are addicted and it is destroying you.
---
FRT,many support you over here, because TEST has become goons' panda. 
---
Then maybe you should take a look at what you are being told by your superiors. It sounds like some of that info might be false either accidentally or on purpose to support the narrative they want you to hear.
---
Please post his reply when you do. It'll be magical, I can tell. 
---
It will fuck up afk drones ratting.
---
Gila drones being invincible was one of the main benefits over a vni.
---
So prices go up, big deal, drop a few alts or something
---
....Amarr preserve us....
---
Then why are they the first?

Funny how the unemployed gofundme guy has all these ideas of things people may be willing to spend money on. 
---
&gt; Because that's China's inclusiveness
---
Not so inclusive towards Muslim people though. Or people who are not communists. Or outsiders. 
---
Maybe just report it instead of re-posting. You are now part of the problem. 
---
Only 100 million an hour. That peanuts. I read that gas huffing in w-space gets you 120, and I have mined moons that give about 60 million an hour in a t1 barge (rorqual mining boosts are insane).
---
Why do people still do supper ratting?
---
So buy several of your favorite ships and fits in Jita, and put them on a courier contract to a hisec system closest to your hunting grounds, and use it as your base. Better yet, join a nullsec space guild and they should already have stocked market.
---
That or they live in Bangladesh or something and 25c/hour is the average minimum wage
---
But yeah if you need to make real space money you don't do it with a vni, 1b/hr or gtfo
---
That is not a normal behavior. 
---
Try unsubscribing and resubscribing again, it should help!
---
Just make it so that your character name changes but the notes people have on you and the contacts/standing status doesn’t change.
---
Problem solved.
---
you need to re-evaluate where you got your news mate, reddit is full of bullshit narrative spinning but tieba is so much worse 
---
Until that point they've lived by the assumption that if they keep to themselves, nobody will go out of their way to fuck them over. Then that assumption is abruptly blown away along with their shitfit hull. Accepting the loss is too much so they aggressively externalize the blame onto the guy who caused it. Sometimes by the next day they've calmed down, and sometimes they stay angry for years. My theory is that in real life they're strait-laced leftists who repress their natural impulses and care very much about outward appearances.

Well, considering there are some people that have 1 plex at 98 billion.. it's never gonna be gone.. but up to 5 is possible by the super rich.. but they have to weigh if it's worth the risk.

Derelik is the perfect place for ndy and market buy low sell high to the adjacent nullsec lowsec peoples. Which if I'm not mistaken is what you do.
---
FW would have no bearing on what the common non combatant pve types in khanid nor derelik aside from a population growth.

The idea is highsec fw which currently doesn't exist. Alternatively if the khanid or ammatar empire got control of the bleak lands that would be great.

Not everyone lives in a wealthy country, there are countries IN the eu that have a basic pay of like 300-400 euro. I cant imagine what asians or south americans have to pay..
---
Over test server drama, no less LMAO
---
I honestly think frat are a great bunch of people... always respond positively and never toxic. After watching rooks and kings first light on the 5th day I aquired an even higher admiration towards them. I beleive that a majority of the gaming community feels the same.. fights are fun and internet spaceships are something we all enjoy as a community.

Keep on doing your thing you jolly pandas and please dont let a few racist fucks ruin your opinion of the ones fighting you.

and i was at work listening wishing i was there.. Dang real life getting in the way of my eve time
---
Nope. The problem is infinite resources. 
---
We need to force people to spread out more, just make resources  limited in a region. More people crammed in  the same region should mean less isk for everyone.

Okay, I’ll remember that. What do I need to do an Abyssal? I mainly really only have Gallentte stuff, and my highest tier ship is a Myrmidon(although I would prefer not to lose that, so I only really used it for safe mission running, so what I’ll usually run is a Vexor... is that good enough?)
---
Supers arent seeded and cant be bought, only built or kept from a TQ mirror (when the server is set to be equal to tq).  Thats why supers, AT frigs, officer mods etc are used as high value currency along with injectors.

You shouldn’t be offended or even care. That guy needs to find his way into the purgatory of eve.

Imo, You have made the matter worse. People will follow his actions in the future. They feel that they are influential as people read and react. It is like the news. It is intoxicating and full of crepe. 
---
Neglect is the only way to go. They feel sad playing bad, but feel more sad as he is invisible. Purgatory will be lead to him by the moderators :)

Vexor, especially the Vexor Navy Issue, do a pretty good job. I suspect the VNI, piloted well and in the right type of abyssal, could do the tier 3 ones pretty reliably with some risk of death (but learn on T1 and T2).
---
Here's a video I found of one doing T2s, which still pay pretty well for an alpha!

That said, the Gila is the king of the abyss and your gallente bonus helps a lot! I'd recommend a passive gila for easy, easy T3 site running. :)

You can make about 100m an hour doing T3 if you can run 6 or 7 an hour, I bet.

---
Also, this is not a war with FRT. This is an inoculation against the disease that FRT represents. They managed to ruin their version of the game, and limped here to try and ruin ours. Anyone who cries out "but they were the least botters" 85% bot alliance is still less than a 99% bot alliance, and FRT is nothing more than a haven for bots.   
---
I'll be downvoted for my alliance tag (Bisu, you slagfist I'm looking at you.) but you can all save this post, and look back at it when history proves me right. No region is more heavily populated by bots than the Detroit shithole that Detorid has become.   
---
Fraternity must be destroyed, and every corp, every alliance, every pilot that has sided with them must be held to account for their willingness to just look the other way as the bot menace that so many decry and rail against on this very sub rots away at our game.
---
FRT, you ruined your game. You will not ruin ours.
---
No telling :p. Everything's fine Haha 
---
Bots would just pay their subs from money made rmting, and rmt would boom as people who don’t grind to afford pvp would look at other ways to pay  for their fun, and a lot of legit players who can’t afford or justify paying to play would just quit.
---
We joke about it too, but definitely less so. Probably because wd-40 is longer and more annoying to say out loud.
---
Who says I farm ? I sit on what I got from way back. I doubt I will ever use all of it, most likely I will completely stop playing and not even bother checking up on Eve or it will shut down long before that time.
---
Never fear, but will pay exorbitant sums to not be ground to dust. 
---
Never fear, but will hire an entire corporation to fight so you have a competent FC.
---
Never Fear, k fam.   
---
Eh, I just enjoy the social part of the game, chatting with other players, don't have an opinion on frat or test, all part of the game at this point, honestly. 
---
Ex-frat （for like a month） and currently enjoying peaceful life helpinf rookies btw.
---
Don't forget they also got negwalleted as an alliance for botting.
---
What's he gonna do, say it didn't happen..?
---
if it goes a lot higher i might have to buy even more plex
---
I really need to know what affects the insurance, looking how the moros gets less payout (and yeah you pay less for the platinum) than the phoenix and for what I know the insurance is based in the minerals used to build the ship. Is that, or is it related to market prices of the minerals or the cap parts?
---
[removed]
---
and they somehow still have the money to buy a pile of titans in just 6 months
---
Depends what you wanna do in the game. 
---
It does not matter in the long run, but in immediate short term, if you intend to mainly PvP I would go with Minnatar cause their ships are the bomb.
---
If you intend to do PvE and have a bit better access to markets for trading etc. Then I would go Caldari cause they get better starting factions for games main tarde hubs and shield + missiles (their faction main choices) are excellent for PvE, IMHO best for starters.
---
What about russian's region and feythabolis with gates with over 100 large bubbles... You got bots in legacy space as well but its not as dense because you have way too much space for your size. frat hates botters and kicks them I remember a botting alliance renting from legacy where do you stand on that?
---
I think only "[Faction name here] Den" anomaly can have a chance of spawning  5/10 in highsec, higher than that you are limited to low &amp; nullsec. You can do some good PVE'ing in a stratios or a T3 Cruiser in lowsec with DED sites.
---
Quickest buck is Catch/Stain Explo but it'll make your eyes bleed.
---
Or, like any game with tokens, throw mum's credit card at the problem and you can afford yourself some nice shoes with some left over. 
---
I think the funniest joke I heard in this thread was "chinese inclusiveness"  
---
You guys are making a good go at making your muslims disappear, maybe it will work on the chinese too. Worth a shot IMO.
---
Is this party approved schlock? I can't believe a living person actually typed this.  
---
....Oh wait bots.... nvm. all makes sense now.
---
Why the fuck are we bringing IRL geopolitics into our internet spaceships? Go kill something or make a good shitpost
---
What about religious groups? whats the chinese people's stance on that?

from what I can the true form of pvp on sisi is rules-lawyering, and everyone has Snitching V

Well, let me rephrase, cannot afford to subscribe 5 to 10 accounts to be competitive in a game which practically requires multiboxing. 
---
Believe me, if you find a botter in TEST, let us know. We love killing them. as to FRT hating bots, GTFO with that silly shit. they love bots. Fraternity Treasury. a "renter" alliance full of botters. Probably not a living body in the entire roster. Take a tour through their space any time and just watch the little roaches scurry. "Frat hates botters" second funniest thing I've seen in this thread. 
---
The russian regions are not even remotely as dense as FRT space with bots. 
---
I wouldn't mind a name change, My main used to be my suicide ganker alt and he has the most generic name ever.
---
Besides, it is not like people cannot transfer SP into a fresh char and start anew. Got someone in my corp who is playing a few month old char because he liquidated his old char and wanted to start over. 
---
You realize that any any t1 frig is a possible venture right?
---
Before ventures even existed, people used stabbed Navitas or whatever.
---
When I worked under the voluntary program - Polaris was one of my favourite system to hang around with my dear Jovian Battleship. As we were never allowed to venture into the public systems in TQ (except rare times under CCP watchful eye), most of us just idled there on our free time spinning around the grids. Good times... I too miss the Polaris sun...

Doesn't even do that now. Started a new chat recently and it only had spaceship command III and mining frigate I

A Elite Dangerous PVPer here. You guys over here in Eve actually ban these people? Last time we collected all the death threats and cancer wishes and put them in the video, and then people in the comments on the official forum told us again to kill ourselves for shooting their pretend-spaceships, the moderators said it's okay because we "provocated them first", if shooting videogame spaceships is provocation to anything outside of ingame responce in the first place.
---
t should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.

That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.
---
An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
---
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.
---
I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
---
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.
---
Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.
---
I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
---
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
---
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
---
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.
---
I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
---
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.
---
The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.
---
I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.
---
That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).
---
I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).
---
And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.
---
All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?
---
You realize warp core stabbed ships can't enter plexes and the venture has a warp core strength that makes it extremely more difficult to deal with than a frigate. Because even if you do happen to land on it. A solo ship can not keep a completely unfitted ship venture without +3 warp core disruption strength. 
---
It is essentially the only work around they made when they said no ships with warp core stabs. I can catch a mavitas outside a gate. I can't catch a venture without 2 scrams and a sebo. 
---
oh my god, I love it. &lt;3 Bisu.

Yea, tell that to all the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang concentration camps.  Or all the Tibetians who also ended up in concentration camps.  Or all the political prisoners and undesirable ethnic chinese who also ended up in concentration camps.  Tell that to the Hong Kong democracy activists, or hell for that matter, to all the democracy activists who got put down with fucking tanks in the streets thirty years ago.

I don’t believe anyone, much less myself, is drinking any koolaid. Pessimism is cool and all but there is no reason to shoot down every new thing they try. 
---
Right because dreadbombing is so successful, thats why we need insurance nerfs. And all the t1 cruiser fleets that are just OP.
---
The nerfs you advocate result in a new eden with less explosions and more endless krabbing. Solo battlecruisers used to be a fun thing for me to roam around in, because it was cheap after insurance and brought access to an MJD. What objective is there in roaming, beyond going out for a few random frags? What incentive do you propose for roaming to replace this? Or do you think theres to much roaming in eve, current year?

Then eve is dead

don't remember the exact dates, but iirc not too long after that SOTA UALX happened

There aren't really that many names universally hated in Eve. Most of those guys/gals have been banned anyways. It seems like the sleazy people just reroll characters anyways. I don't see any reason why name changes aren't allowed. 
---
Say what you want about characters and crap in-game. Go nuts.
---
When you start this nonsense, attacking the human at the keyboard, that's inexcusable.

If you stick to subcaps, this game doesn't require multiboxing at all.

Right now my alt is learning the trading skills, so the fees and taxes don't hit so hard. If these are ready, i will dive into it.

Just to get this straight.

At the end you mentioned the "historical norm" and market manipulation. In this case i would see a sudden and very steep rise in sell price (like a staircase level), right?

Beam slicers. Though no one will fight you.

Was an interesting fight, getting there and waiting around for it to start for about an hour! We then warp in, FC gets head shot of the field and its over! pack it up boys and head back lol. Sometimes its just not your night lol.

Asian here. Can afford. Easily. Subscription is cheaper than my time spent grinding the frak out of the game, and I value my time.

Hi there bud, I was just browsing through the the comments sections and saw your post and I got a few questions.
---
1. How is this time zone tanked.
---
2. Why bring back old POS mechanics
---
3. How dense are ya son?
---
To be fair buying characters effectively changes your name... to bad most have just awful names on the bazaar 
---
do you know why we hired you? we want you to sit in that desk and make posters 8 hours a day
---
I truly wish it was that easy, most people probably dont have the option lol, but I see your point in trying to show how relatively cheap it still is for many people. 
---
I still remember the first con man that took my stuff in Eve. Jerry Rin is out there, and he agreed to duel me one day.
---
There is no escape from N-squared problem consequences.
---
So much content being lost over pos mods no longer being repaired.... 
---
Also no way to push timers around due to the amount of stront  for the reinforcement cycle.

So shit will happen when ppl are either at work or in bed.

the only times I've been in sisi are mass tests and occasional how does thing work experiments, I'm just a connoisseur of forums drama. much of which seems to be childish "this guy killed me" "no he killed me first" type stuff.
---
but my main observation is that when you go literally anywhere on sisi other than the moveme systems, you will not see another person in local. therefore, my opinion is that pretty much all of them are asking for it.

Leocaldari is gonna try and take advantage and boost it up with buy order walls
---
:starofdavid:
---
Don't make me freedom you
---
He’s not wrong. I fell for the high quantity low sale and neighbor high buy scam that had no money to back it so that it fails. I bought them all to not be able to sell them. I lost billions. For two days I was angry when I realized why not just set up my own sale undercutting the assholes sales of the same item. In a matter of hours got 95% of my isk back. Sorry who over fell for his empty buy orders. Technically wasn’t me scamming. 
---
On the supply end I would look at more plex sales, and maybe revisit the idea of letting plex be obtainable through the game via a small drop chance on rats or whatever. Not a ton, but for example say every npc that dies in space has a .01 percent chance of dropping 4 plex per se. This would help alleviate supply.
---
On the demand side I would do alot, but first and foremost would be to nerf the living shit out of skill farms. Problem is skill farms make ccp alot of money so I would get sacked here. So realistically We would have to settle with my supply ideas.
---
Tz tanked ? Like all of your sov structures and citadels ?? Or should we anchor them in your favorite time zone so u can Max cta form and out form is 3:1?
---
Stop treating the symptoms and cure the cause instead. Even with ventures gone people will fly unfit atrons or something and still just warp away 80% of the time 
---
Should be some benefits for owning  sov ? 
---
That said, I'll take the stront based system over the current system any day. 
---
correct...if you see a mod that has traded around 50-65m for the past 3 months jump to 150m that would be something to keep a watch on when buying.  the selling is not an issue but the buy orders getting inflated is what you have to watch out for.
---
best of luck with your venture.  i hope yours will be as enjoyable as mine. :)
---
Considering the fw mission gates pop up on overview you can just race them to the gate with a captor. Youd be surprised how many warp to 0 on the gate 
---
Lots and lots of mining barges.
---
Multi boxing burners
---
High class wormholes
---
Also 5 rorqs is more like 650-700m/hr, less after the nerf.
---
I was talking about regular carrier ratting. Supers do considerably more isk.  But both are being nerfed and anomalies continue to get nerfed.
---
Having to vote to get the game fixed really makes me think
---
1. Can safely be bumped to t5 payouts
---
Anything without fear does not mean recklessness and requires the use of strategy and tactics.

It may seem awkward to you, but a journalist ought to show some respect and professionalism. Besides, it only seems awkward because almost everyone has been writing it wrong for years, not because it's inherently weird.

You're basically saying that the Chinese people are responsible for their government. If the argument is that the government is repressive and anti-freedom, you can hardly blame the people for their actions if they have no power. It's like blaming Venezuelans for Maduro for starving his own people.

Eve is "supposed" to be about consequences so if you somehow manage to fuck up your name so much that even TISHU won't take you then you deserve to have to reroll your character.

And if you bought Bhaals McBhaalsface on the character bazaar you deserve to keep that name forever.

The 5/10 does not naturally spawn in high sec, you need to get it from an escalation from a Blood Den. Need to be careful where you run them because it has a chance to escalate in high, low, or null sec space.

You can also find someone that runs dens and buy the escalation from them.

One of my most vivid EvE memories was gathering together with all the people that hated eachother in Fountain to collectively shoot at a Polaris. It was the only time everyone in Fountain wasn't trying to kill eachother. It was a weird experience. We didn't even get the shield down 1%, for the record.

You have the benefit of jamming/unjamming the system ... don’t complain about structures in different time zones , when we first hit Provi u had structures in every TZ and reseted them in every group in Provi to main EU TZ and now you are complaining about  structures in TZ that isn’t in your favor ? Come one since when had Provi become such a crybaby.. it’s not like numbers in US tz are that different even without you permanent bat phones of siege green ,Shot first , snuff etc ..

I believe in you! Just copy my format and use pyfa to jumble it around and save results. There's only 6 slots, and 18 implants to make combinations from for ascendancy (2*6 + 6).

Generally I would suggest a Mid Grade set is good value for money, but depends more what you're trying to do &amp; chance of dying. It may be more cost effective to just use a slot 6 and hyperspatials.

lol, you must be new to MMOs. EVERY FKIN MMO, where the local money is important, has botting and RMT. Removing PLEX doesn't mean you remove RMT.
---
Fucking my sides lol
---
10/10
---
By removing the source of ISK for some parts of EVE community who buy PLEX so they don't have to crab, you essentially make them choose either to 1) quit EVE; 2) start playing EVE the way they don't want (crab) and eventually burn out and quit; or 3) buy isk from RMTers.

Yeah, some sites just aren't worth running in certain ships...and a VNI could be hurt badly if webbed down.  
---
What CCP Never told you guys was that PLEX was secretly the largest isk sink in the entire game as they (CCP) used to sell most of the plex on  the market, and use it as a quantitative easing of sorts to control its own price inflation.
---
Not sure why they aren't intervening at this time, though I'm sure there is a very valid behind the scenes reason.

No but what your saying is your goverment's West Threat Theory.

Just like why you didn't attack goons, you chose FRT, because you couldn't beat it.

Indeed. Ideally I think the whole Plex system needs an overhaul and replacing with something better, but the chances of CCP doing that are close to zero. So I'll settle for WCS and ventures being banned at least.

Exist? I've never heard a word on this side of us. There are only some disputed areas. About this, maybe you are an American, and this one is to ask your Trump.

Well goons arent coming over here all the time, swinging the super cap hammer. Where as, if we wanted to evict you from your space who would end up there? Probably someone even worse ( like horde ), and they would bring PL/NC. Super fleet to our doorstep. Not something we want.
---
With that said. I would choose goons over pl/nc/frat anyday.
---
Yeah, which is hilarious.  Guy was never an officer in KarmaFleet, much less Alliance level leadership.  And the moment GSF found out, he was blacklisted.
---
Yea CCP has taken a pretty hard line once threats leave the game. Anything strictly in game(I'm going to kill your ship) is fine, but once it hits real life CCP don't mess around 
---
Because you are blind?

tbh, I think it's mostly intentional propaganda to turn people off from joining Frat's english-speaking contingent. So still technically within the realms of spaceships pew pew in my mind.

Do you even notice anything ?Dont you think the great firewall isnt a tool to make you belive the west is evil and china is innocent? Why else would they block Tianem square massacre too known as the June 4 incident ?

I think Trump and brexit are/were dumb mistakes and the states and Britain are figuring out their mistakes the hard way

Refugees in Europe sounds like an especially good conversation to have. There's no good answer to refugees, Europe is dealing with them today but there are many reasons that the world could see many more refugees in the future, water scarcity, polluting, wars, everyone should be focused on European actions regarding refugees because other countries will likely be making the same decisions in the coming decades

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/u-n-says-it-has-credible-reports-that-china-holds-million-uighurs-in-secret-camps-idUSKBN1KV1SU
---
&gt;A United Nations human rights panel said on Friday that it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China are held in what resembles a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy.”
---
Gay McDougall, a member of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, cited estimates that 2 million Uighurs and Muslim minorities were forced into “political camps for indoctrination” in the western Xinjiang autonomous region.
---
https://www.thenation.com/article/china-xinjiang-uighur-oppression/
---
&gt;In December 2018 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights requested official access to China’s Uighur reeducation camps. The Chinese authorities eventually acknowledged the camps’ existence, but claimed they were places of patriotic education and occupational-training centers intended to help minorities integrate, where education and self-criticism sessions and interrogations are combined with Mandarin-language courses. Accounts in the foreign press by former detainees who have fled the country paint a darker picture than that presented by Chinese media; they describe often harsh detention conditions, strong pressure, and even physical and psychological torture.
---
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/uighur-muslims-china-reeducation-camps-un-intervene-torture-a8670481.html
---
&gt;The United Nations most senior human rights official has requested direct access to China’s Xinjiang region to verify “worrying reports” of re-education camps holding Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.
---
&gt;Michelle Bachelet, the high commissioner for human rights, made the announcement amid growing global concern over Chinese treatment of the ethnic minority group.
---
&gt;“We have been asking for direct access to the region to be able to check and verify the worrying reports we are receiving,” Ms Bachelet told a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
---
&gt;The authorities are believed to have incarcerated as many as two million Uighurs in “reeducation camps” to promote what the government calls “ethnic unity” in the country’s far west.
---
&gt;Until October 2018, the Chinese government officially denied the existence of the camps.
---
&gt;Since then, reports have noted malnourishment, numerous deaths – particularly among the elderly and infirm – and in some cases the forced administration of psychiatric drugs.  
---
&gt;Former detainees have alleged torture and said they were forced to learn Chinese Communist Party propaganda.
---
&gt;Last week over 270 scholars from 26 countries published a statement condemning the “mass human rights abuses and deliberate attacks on indigenous cultures” in China. 
---
&gt;The statement came after 15 foreign ambassadors who wrote a letter expressing their concern about the incarcerations were told by Chinese officials they should not “interfere in the internal affairs of other countries”.
---
&gt;**Germany’s top human rights official, Bärbel Kofler, was recently blocked from visiting the Uighur camps in China.** 
---
&gt;“I am shocked by reports of the treatment of the Turkic Uighur minority,” Ms Kofler said in a statement. “Unfortunately, my request to travel to Xinjiang was refused. I would have liked to have gained a first-hand impression of the situation there and will continue to push for permission to visit Xinjiang soon.”
---
I  can reference article after article, the United Nations, ect ect.  Can I point to them on a map?  No I cant.  Why is that?  Your autocratic totalitarian government hides them, refuses access to them, and denies they exist in the same way the north koreans refuse access to their nuclear facilities or their own gulags. 
---
seems like hanlon's razor to me tbh, people will unironically conflate the actions of a totalitarian state with a spaceship guild using bots because they're actually taken in by the idea that other guilds are the 'enemy' :shrug:

---
Wormholes, lvl5 missions, market, jita scam
---
what
---
1. Exploitable. And will make gatecamps more profitable so will promote annoying gameplay styles like ganking/gatecamping.
---
2. FW missions don't matter. They don't really affect the occupancy in any way. And they give way to make isk without interfering with PVP / occupancy / who is winning. If you give isk to do FW then that side who can earn most isk will be best to join with farmers etc and it will be a downward spiral again. Ages ago you joined that side/group who was most strongest in PVP.
---
3. What if you are fighting against pirates or neutrals who live in the area? They will have huge upper hand. If you are in a pvp focused group why even join FW if you want to use citadels in fw lowsec? Also you are locked from using NPC stations. Only roleplayers or pve focused groups would bother joining FW with so hard restrictions.
---
4. Plexes are already cyno jammed. You can go outside of any plex or inside a large plex with any ship class and get cyno immunity and combat probe immunity. Even with a titan. Jamming whole system will just make moving around more annoying for rest of Eve.
---
5. That is cool. Also make FW plexes give -90% less LP and there will be no more farmers affecting occupancy. They will switch to doing missions and won't be a problem anymore. Only pvp players will be left capturing systems.
---
6. Black rise + Placid isn't that big area compared to some null regions. And it's easier to move around because no bubbles. Also bigger map gives more room for smaller groups to go to edge areas and do smaller stuff there. Hardcore groups chasing their afk ventures off every time will just make them quit.
---
It...it's a star man. It's bright.
---
I feel getting screwed in this game is a really important experience for some people for real life.
---
Benjamin Graham mentions something along these lines. Basically you can't get business opportunities or "do this to make money" from other people. If it were a great way to make money he would have sold the blueprints himself, not to you to make the profit.
---
Lmao that’s pretty good
---
Can I use galaxy pack and lesser valuable pack at the same time? Do they stack for monthly game time and plex? 
---
It won't do much. Even at the special bulk rate, you only get about 330,000 PLEX per $10,000USD spent.
---
That's less than the market started with towards the beginning of OP's post.
---
why wouldnt i? 
---
But its way better than serenity
---
1. Correct. Was used in one of the biggest or maybe even The biggest exploit in Eve.
---
2. Correct. There is already a cyno block in the plexes. There is no need to make it system wide. You only have to be on the same grid with the acceleration gate. No need to go inside the plex. Most likely op doesn't know about this or doesn't understand how it works. 99% of FW players have no idea about most of the mechanics in FW :(
---
So basically what you are saying , bring back old
---
Mechanics where u can shot stuff in your tz , so the defender can’t defend it because he isn’t around 
---
Yes and its gonna continue to go up. Please make a post every 5 minutes with price updates, thanks alot!
---
Do you have to say dumb shit because you have nothing valid to contribute by any chance?
---
Your posting always has a tang of salt in it. You must be fun in parties
---
I think mid grades are great value, but wanted to *know* that there wasn't some unicorn option I was missing out on. There isn't. But still good to confirm isk/speed benefit ratio of slapping HG A/B with a MG G/D/E/O. 
---
Moreso at the &lt;600m ISK mark, I think there are a lot of great options that I wouldn't have considered usually. Especially mixing high, mid and low grades. Usually only consider low &amp; mid, or mid and high. interesting how mixing all three get to a good place.
---
With the amount of alts floating around everywhere... the "universe of consequences" is sadly not really valid anymore.
---
Exactly. The restrictions and penalties you get from FW is what makes it bad.
---
FW already has a cyno jam in plexes.

You can sell unresearched bpos(blueprint originals) on the market, if they have been researched you need to sell them via contract. I'm also not sure what scam you fell for, how did you determine the blueprints were valuable/worthless?

Friends - because it turns out that's easier when you don't take the position that you can spout whatever shit you want because "no one 'gives' offense."

Lmao it thinks the US government controls the internet. There's more to the world than America btw. 
---
I realize that this change was proposed years ago, but I'm guessing, at this point, CCP has totally forgot about it?
---
Whatever bonus is included in the pack is added to whatever you have, plex, in game items or game time.
---
There are like 3 or 4 packs like Galaxy and each of them can be used only once per account.
---
This is a thing of beauty!
---
If there were multiple posts showing excitement over this feature and the expected results and how improvements could make this new thing super fun, I wouldn't believe I was on r/eve.

If your 'friends' actually liked you they would respect your differing opinion without 'taking offense'.

Yes.

Which is not due foe at least a few months, given the game does not completely die by then.

There used to be reason to join FW. It was a free permanent wardec to gain lots of targets and not having to be in highsec. And some of the corporations there were actually cool.

As i agree with this - a name change 'a possibility' should be available for bought characters.

The Problem is that ships got cheaper and cheaper because the minerals to build them got cheaper

More likely ISK.

it shouldn't matter, it starts with cosmetics in all the stupid p2w games out there. Hey look first a skin, then a booster for sp, then a rare ship. its a domino effect just waiting to happen. 
---
Most non blob alliances require you to have 4 accounts if you want to experience all that Eve has to offer (main, cap alt, super alt, titan alt).
---
I guess you can just have a large part of the content completely blocked off due to how big/small your irl back account is, it wasn’t really so much of an issue when plex was reasonable but now. Not pay to win btw.
---
Also what a dumbass idea “lul you can’t spend hundreds of dollars a year on a game just quit sell your computer you’re addicted” ez way to make Eve die for real. 
---
You’re right and props for doing it, there is certainly interesting moments in there sorry if I sounded a bit sarcastic. 
---
Don’t be a poor though and fly full hg set or geno + speed when extra fitting matters ))
---
Just look at op and his alliance on sisi: [https://imgur.com/a/2JhNOkt](https://imgur.com/a/2JhNOkt)  
---
They'ra really bullshit.

Thats the point. The mineral cost has dropped drastically akready thats why you could actually insurance fraud capitals since you got more out of it then it costs to produce them

I'm not sure how it makes anything better. I think this game needs more dread bombs not less and more roaming capitals, not less.

Let's first see how the caracal navy issue change plays out.
---
It is too early, too dangerous to touch anything else until the +25 drone capacity is  implemented.
---
I imagine it took a tram months to develop that change affecting 0.5% of the population, so insta alpha fleets can wait.
---
Yep, you are correct. Building something from ground up needs effort and real life skills (leadership to recruit &amp; motivate ppl, planning, organization, logistics, diplomacy etc.) ... but this is how is supposed to be in this game.
---
What you ask here is: "modify the game so I can effortless and without competition access the same resources as a 10k+ alliance can" ... that\`s why you have negative reactions to your post.
---
If you really want to play this game ... take you time to build &amp; run a 10k+ ppl alliance, conquer some null space, use it and defend it. This game is not designed to have instant gratification.

---
I know. Best example why you having faction guns with lower fitting matters. 
---
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
---
Get into an astero. Use it to take extended trips either to NS or through WHs. Run relic sites as you go and hunt explorers as you encounter them. It dosen't take that many sites to pay for a T2 fit astero. Another option is to join FW and fight in novice plexes, You can make enough IKS from the LP you get to fund any number of T1 frigs, and you can usually get several fights in a couple hr period even if you are just camping plexs. 
---
Blaster Merlin's with some frig logi and ceptors for catch are great at fighting small cruiser up gangs.
---
Yeah sorry I don’t choose to play the game on ez mode in a blob alliance that has 30 keepstars where you can single box a titan and not worry about anything else

I agree, but you should also delete Snuff from lowsec.

Yea I spelt my name wrong and didnt bother asking until way too late, CCP explained that the longer its left the harder it gets, so after so long its written off as just not possible (ontop of them believing your name should persist). I also messed up a new toon once (double last name) which CCP were cool enough to change straight away.

There is a reason why I only played EVE for as long as I did... 1, toxic pieces of crap like this who think they are better than anyone else, and 2... having to deal with losing my crap by griefers.

Alpha might matter a lot more after the fax nerf.
---
why not tho?
---
People still play that?
---
This is eve ;)
---
After the BoB BBQ?
---
Alliance tournament prize ship, a fixed number of that specific hull will ever exist
---
Apparently they do -15... 
---
+ wasn't it frt that broke the agreements with TRI when saw good moment?
---
wasn't it frt that broke the agreements with RMC and stole shared renters money?
---
from what i see its about 50% less on all figures, Orca, all Freighters, Battleships behave the same
---
One is real the other one is not
---
Judge is that you?
---
What's the point? You can reroll and inject, might as well skip these extra steps and allow a name change.
---
Name changes would cost plex, 100%
---
Well, it kind of is. The universe of consequences uses the alts, right?
---
good luck fitting T2 beams on an avatar
---
People still play eve?
---
I want to stop seeing suggestions where someone thinks adding tedium to the game reduces botting. Bots don’t tire of tedium and a bot doesn’t have a hard time doing tedious things on a huge scale. Tedium is why we have bots. Get this through your tiny smooth brains. 
---
almost isk positive 
---
why i always gloss over important things like post titles, etc. is beyond me.  i just read "give faction weapons ...." and hit reply
---
Anyone remember when we allowed *insert civil liberty violation* to occur? Those were the good days. 
---
/s
---
No dude. It's that we realize today the seriousness of depression and mental illnesses,  and why risk putting someone over the edge? It's part of gamers (and the general populations) progressiveness throughout time.

The kill report shows another story, beside of a small fleet fight with two carriers involved, I would assume that the bomber got tackled by the Comorant or Pilgrim, and then the procurer drones ripped it apart

Hi, mrPlinch!
---
I wanted to stop by and offer you a robot hug, and wish you the most excellent day ever!
---
Well, he was with two carriers. Probably thought that they would focus on fighters instead of him\^\^
---
You post is misleading and manipulative. You jump to "fix" the problem" but you don't present your arguments that there is a problem in the first place. Let me do it for you:
---
Hey, me and my 2-10 friends can't do much against those few hundred ppl that paid for their accounts, get organized and are willing to spend hours in their titans/faxes/supers just to help someone I hunt.
---
Is just so not fair that I can't effortlessly outsmart/outrun/outgun those few hundred ppl that put effort in this game. Things need to be changed. CCPls
---
I can understand the gender change token (you are just a clone after all).
---
But bloodline or race? Nah dude you can't just pay to become amarrian nobility when you are born minmataar scum 
---
sure he starve his people, american fucktard
---
I made my Main when I was in high school and it sounded super cool and edgy. Now I cringe whenever my FC says my name. SIckest Rain.... I love my pilot and hate the name. It coulda been worse though.
---
yea they use asic miners nowadays 
---
Say what you want, the game stayed up and didn't crash completely even after adding all the bots.
---
Show me any other game that can host 3.5k humans players and spawn several thousand bots to hit the 10k concurrent characters threshold and not instantly crash their servers.
---
If this tech demo collected the information and data they need, I'm super stoked for how this can be implemented into/with Eve online in the future.
---
Heh, I wonder if the mass skillfarmers are gonna have a sell off just to cut their losses
---
Well, according to zKill  371 ships were destroyed by a Virtuoso. Can´t tell how many it was from this pilot, as this was the second Virtuoso loss
---
Your post is too vague. Maybe try to think of some specific questions. If you can’t then maybe you’re in over your head and need to take a step back. 
---
Yeah, that's been a nifty isk sink for me as well. Then again, I didn't lose the ship, so
---
Takeout insurance by making everything automatic platinum and then adjusting the numbers
---
You can churn through Tier 3's pretty quick (6-8 per hour), don't bother going for the nodes way out in the sticks. Just grab the bioadaptive cache and anything else that is close to the gate or on your way as you kill things.
---
Not forgotten. It will be part of the gun Tiericide
---
I'm sitting here, playing other games, watching y'all retards eructate about how awesome and cool a 20B monthly sub will be. Bois you are up for a hell of a surprise when TQ ends up like the chinese server and tops 2K players at best (being in grand total 10 persons and their alts). 
---
and Test rent 2 entire region to botter 
---
Fitting. T2 guns may give you the DMG-bonus from the skill, but use up much more fitting
---
&gt;I'm glad this whole bullshit will create a big shitstorm mostly caused by injectors and the ease of isk farm in NS.
---
Hells yea, gonna be good riddance to that shit
---
Did you read the OP? Also you are not doing 6-8 in an hour. 
---
Because CCP takes 10 years to finish doing anything.  Tiericide will be done some day!
---
if you say "actually" before kys, people suddenly freak out.
---
Pretty sure the post is pretty specific do I stockpile and then move to a trade hub to sell or so I use it to run indy for higher turn around.
---
I blame our CEO Arancar weeboeron
---
If it hits 4b i will buy some plex
---
Having flown a avatar I know this but does it really make that much difference on t2 ships
---
You are being vague, we can’t tell you WHAT to do, you need to figure out what YOU want to do. 
---
Would selling straight to the market be profitable for you? 
---
What would you build? T3s? T1 ships? Modules? 
---
You grasp so many topics in one post. 
---
I agree with the guy above, I think you should take a step back and figure out what exactly you want to do. 
---
What's blazing?
---
What are they doing to do in FW with that gang you proposed? 
---
talking about ISK/h in WH space is tricky
---
If you ninja huff, you go for 20 minutes run and the best you can do is around 40M/20min with a well skilled venture. others kind of gas give you 10-20Misk/20min/venture.
---
And, of course, you have to scan down this kind of gas site, huff without beeing killed by some sabre, and hall the gaz to your home.
---
Hard to compare the isk/h this with the infinite anomaly respawn and all day long farming in nullsec
---
In addition how come haw guns use XL ammo, but rapid torp uses regular torps? 
---
If I am not mistaken you can "force" the spawn in HS by running a Den which has not low sec system under 9 jumps. 
---
Tried wormholes, didn't like it as logistics were pia. Need to look into lvl 5 missions. Don't have 100b isk to invest into markets and jita scams don't work 99% of the time.
---
You made me visit the toilet.
---
I’m glad you’re pretty sure. Two people have told you otherwise. 
---
What I meant by that is for the ships to require less minerals, basically to have the insurance already incorporated in the price.
---
Less minerals bought from the miners, yes, but also less ISK coming into the economy.
---
Ummm .... Its the vets that have all those alts .... Newbs do not have armies for all that shit + Rorq mining + whatever else.
---
Can't help that people are making the question not to more than I'm asking. Simple question of which option would be better out of 2 options given. Then again leave it to the eve community to try to make things they arent.
---
No, he is just not in inconsiderate asshole like you.
---
Maybe try using google. Your question is stupid. Reddit isn’t your mommy. 
---
Toxic much.
---
Ouch my feelings. 
---
Oh wow cool. Props for daring to fly it.
---
End mandatory FAX alts
---
yea that's pretty weak, but at the same time man up and get over it.
---
5-10min if you blitz and only go for bioadaptive
---
That's basically the problem of having fixed insurance prices while mining efficiency has skyrocketed. If insurance was removed and ships mineral requirements slashed to have the insurance already in the final price, CCP would not have to recalculate what is adequate insurance amount the next time mineral prices change.
---
I have a measely just over 90k plex, and am not just sitting and waiting, am laughing my ass off at this shit 
---
You sounded pretentious without being annoying updoot
---
You’re an idiot. Nobody got “dumpstered” on Reddit except you by yourself. You reposted something harmful so you could get Reddit points. What a fucking waste you are. 
---
Getting the heart pounding again was certainly worth it. My only regret is that I did not do this ship justice.  I may have to buy another!
---
Blitzing nullsec burner missions
---
L4 blitzing can actually be pretty OK too I hear
---
Just to the dumbshits downvoting: it’s not a disagree button. 
---
Id never change mine
---
Because im a star 
---
Aye, it seems like a bunch of people activate all their missions and then run them later though, I could be wrong. 
---
As u/KeldorEternia mentions, it's a bit vague and sounds like you don't quite have an idea in mind for what you want to do. Assuming the goal is to get money, fly spaceships here's some ideas:  
---
Ore &amp; Ice: Realistically unless you have at least 3 characters mining (orca/porpoise boost + 2 barges) it is seriously not worth your time - buy compressed ore from HS and refine inside WH. Unless of course you enjoy mining for the funsies, in which case go nuts - then compress and take out to sell.   
---
Gas: I would just huff and sell, unless you plan on using in reactions or T3 production - in which case you would again probably just want to buy in bulk from HS and ship in. Higher class gas sites are worth a pretty penny.  
---
PI: Pretty good money maker provided you have the patience to set it up and the willpower to do the cycles of endless clicking. [www.eveplanets.com](https://www.eveplanets.com) will let you see what you can produce from the planets in your system and [https://evehelper.tk/](https://evehelper.tk/) can let you see how the tiers (P0 &gt; P4) chain together. In my experience, I tried producing upto P3 on a weekly cycle as I could not be bothered/did not have the time to log in every 2 days or so and eventually gave up because i'm lazy.  
---
Manufacturing: Again, unless you invest heavily into your structures in terms of reprocessing rigs etc most items are simply cheaper/easier to buy from HS markets - especially ships. Even really useful items like fuel blocks I found to be a PITA other than to simply just buy and transport in.  
---
TLDR: Take everything out to sell in HS -  have a shopping list of things to bring back to the WH when you return. Avoid going out/returning with an empty cargohold.  
---
T2 guns do more damage only with the T2 ammos, but less with faction ammo.
---
Whales don’t buy more subs they buy more ISK with PLEX. CCP should lower sub cost and raise PLEX price. 
---
before tiericide was finished, they came out with abyssal which makes old meta items look bland.
---
Have you by chance been stockpiling subcap guns? 
---
I think artys are alright, but ACs need a rework ever since TE nerf.
---
I watched Markee "play" this and I never saw more than maybe 3 other ships on screen. Yeah, there were a lot of torpedoes, but that doesn't really mean anything. 
---
This needs work and their first implementation pretty much has to be perfect for it to not be rejected by the playerbase. I never was in a TIDI fight, but I'd rather fight at 10% speed, than rubberbanding, vanishing ships and Torpedoes out of nothing. 
---
And people basically exploit TIDI to defend Structures now, if they find an exploit in this cloud tech, things can get really bad. Thinking of duping ships in Combat systems or Staggering Missles on bigger Targets to Alpha them faster. This is just stuff out of my head.
---
I did and standby my response. Its often way more efficient to just go for caches and complete as fast as possible than to spend extra time flying all over the rooms for often, in my experience, marginal resource gain. But i use an AB gila, I suspect you can improve if you use a MWD fit.
---
It's too much, I will post it everyday
---
You can actually learn more from failure than from success, and this was basically the first test of this tech, so idk what you where expecting.
---
Congrats i remember someone did just known space a few years back and i thought that was pretty impressive but wormholes also dam good job man o7.
---
Require 4 accounts? That sounds exactly like a blob alliance to me
---
FRT never upheld the nip as they never removed their structures from tenerifis as they agreed to do, it was a permanent "fuck you" to legacy, xix and razor and proved that they intented to not honour any agreement  made but also low key enough that it wouldent escalate a full scale war prematurely...
---
shhht, Omist is fine, there is absolutely no botting organisation there. The fact that KWG has paid absurd amount of money to Test over the months/years is only a proof on how generous they are! Everybody loves KWG &lt;3 
---
I said it before and will again, FRT never upheld the nip as they never removed their structures from tenerifis as they agreed to do, it was a permanent "fuck you" to legacy, xix and razor and proved that they intented to not honour any agreement  made but also low key enough that it wouldent escalate a full scale war prematurely...
---
wrong subreddit
---
Decived about what? How FRT never honoured their nip with legacy? How FRT backstabbed XIX and RZR  in insmother and declared war even though they had a nip?
---
The only things race matters for are cosmetic. For example: Amarr cannot wear sunglasses.  Only Minmatar have Minmatar tribal facial tattoos. Only Amarr can wear the hooded robe and can have metal heads. There are other things I don’t know.
---
He got on only 3 killmails and did 0 damage on all of them. Uff.
---
He didn’t ask how to make the most money or be most efficient. He asked specifically about resources. The correct answer is that they are mostly in the side cans and that yes they are more plentiful in T4-5. Stay in your lane, little T3 man. 
---
Trying to design for both non-FW and FW participants is likely chasing two hares.
---
You gonna catch none and you only gonna end up with your dick in your hand.
---
Reminder that the problem of Citadels in FW space is not that they exist, it's that they are *neutral*, they bypass the FW system, yet still profit from FW content but, while doing so, kill it.
---
Focus on PvP between FW pilots, when that's done properly *then* you can branch out.
---

You should read the loot part of the article first so you know not to do a site that doesn’t drop loot. 
---
New gate to camp? Bring it in!
---
Kind of bad when you have such large fleets and not a single person competent enough to FC after the main one gets killed . . .
---
So? Fly what you can afford to lose.
---
except :
---
- this wasn't a game demo, it was a tech demo
---
- It wasn't about the client, it was about the server
---
- What's the point of a tech demo to drive things smoothly and implement TiDI. The goal was to have none of that and stress test the server.
---
Thats a neat idea, so the insurance is balanced around the actual worth 
---
most valid answer to OP.   
---
One should assume this was common sense. It does not feel that way. Still though - welcome back!  
---
&gt; As a FW cap pilot
---
You are anti-thesis to everything the zone stands for, and a pretty good sign that the system is fucked up.
---
Those are blunt words but you know they are true. The zone was created with the clear goal of accessibility through ship size limit, starting from frigates, and that for a good reason.
---
That you got to put a sentence together shows that the zone has degenerated, it no longer serves its purpose.
---
If you're so disgusted by FRT bots and that your flair isn't a bait, i wonder why you still support an alliance that received enormous amount of isks to let KWG continue their large scale botting activities? If i were you, I wouldn't be so sure that I'm with The Good Guys™ ...   
---
My idea is that as this thread lighten up, many people just go for "chinese dudes = filthy botters" stereotypes without looking to their own lands first. Botters are a plague all over new eden and don't automatically speak chinese. 
---
As no one else has mentioned it yet, the cap usage on energy turrets. The base activation cost difference on large faction is 75% of that on a T2 version. Imagine that ease of cap usage while being able to use T2 pulse/beam ammo. 
---
Along with the higher damage modifier and fitting mentioned here as well, they would either have to change the modules a bit or we would start to see quite the demand.
---
They can’t keep jita local up or automatically ban bots without 3 people writing data queries first and you want a dynamically venerated ecosystem..
---
Is anyone paying attention to ccp anymore or we just jet canning any idea we find now 
---
"frat hates botters and kicks them"
---
30 minutes of camping a standard frt ratting system kinda tells me this is very unlikley
---
You know they are already banning WCS in plexs? And CCP Seagull presented it like it was some kind of feature for the zone, well the zone is still dead, so much for that.
---
As Gorski said, this is treating the symptoms, it's useless and might actually be detrimental.
---
What FW content needs is more commitment, and this can be achieved by systems like Timer Rollbacks.
---
https://youtu.be/uAtLV26wnCE
---
I do. Just saying reducing the mineral value of caps is dumb, now that everybody can easily afford to own/build a cap.
---
Don't forget to add System Adjacency being needed for system capture.
---
Sisi drama. Literally the stupidest thing ever. Like anyone who plays the game in sisi is idiot beyond help. 
---
You know maybe I haven't been browsing r/Eve as religiously as I should but I haven't heard somebody say "Eve is kill" in like two or three weeks. Glad somebody is keeping the doubt alive
---
&gt; where a 10,000-person feet fight would be an everyday occurrence 
---
Oh Hilmar, y u so kinky!?  
---
On a more serious note: I think before we see new space or a transition to a new universe, we will have to wait another 15 years.. #walkinginstations  
---
Wait what! Has PLEX prices crached? I haven't played for 2 years but evemarket data shows them at around 4 mil a pop. 
---
And then line up the perfect boson
---
PLEX changed, it now requires 500 PLEX to sub an account, it got fragmented if you want to see it that way.
---
In reality, PLEX is higher than ever, it skyrocketed. 
---
Mulitply that by 500. 500 nuplex to make 1 old plex.
---
r/wallstreetbets
---
That's just a continuation of all missiles.
---
Rapid lights, rapid heavies, rapid torps 
---
They all use the smaller ammo, unlike guns 
---
That explains things. 
---
Or just put a container in your ship 
---
Seems your "official channels" aren't official. CCP does not run a discord.
---
Try to roam and see yourself.
---
Online numbers are steady, but it is mostly players and bots krabbing. All major forces are fortified under their respect super umbrellas and krab the shit out of PvE. Whoever dares to interrupt that gets turbofucked. 
---
Nullsec is blobby for the most part (still managing ti pull off a fight here and there and not even due, but it is rare), lowsec is kill. Nobody has incentive to invade their enemies bcs of cancer citqdels and sov mechanics. Free isk allows alliances to be happy with their space.
---
K
---
answer" but why would i do that as it seems to piss you off that much, it makes it so worth while sticking around"
---
I'd like to see namechanges, good money for CCP for no work at all and satisfaction for people who bought chars via the bazar. WinWin
---
Agreed, however when you see people displaying pride in a corrupt government or flat out misinformed, there is no harm in providing facts ;)
---
He knows that a brutix and a moros are two different ships right?
---
There is no full list, but different ones for different playstyles.
---
Regarding big newbie corps: Brave vs Phorde vs Karma fleet - there are many reddit posts about them, just google.
---
Nullsec warfare: [http://coalitionsin.space/](http://coalitionsin.space/) is a coalition list, generally there is one leading alliance in each coalition which is usually your best bet regarding organisation and content. You can see where they live in the SOV map, Philosophys are simmilar for all giant entitys, just goons are a bit special cause of their terrible history/old philosophys and they PvE more.
---
Independent groups usually have a stronger mentality and a less of a quantity oriented gameplay. (rip Out of sight, Snuff, Volta) Groups like these are always worth researching more.
---
For small gang, there is this old outdated post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7ya08b/top\_tier\_small\_gang\_pvp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7ya08b/top_tier_small_gang_pvp/)

For wormholes, this is a great orientation: [https://eve-tracker.org/whkills](https://eve-tracker.org/whkills)

Fitting mainly.

Yeah, as the talk was about using T2 ammo, I was assuming we talk about T2 ammo\^\^
---
Its a good 5 minute cyno ship, but thats about it
---
ugh
---
CCP's line called the terms of service 
---
How do you feel about governments appointing the spiritual leaders of various faiths against their will?
---
&gt;this wasn't a game demo, it was a tech demo
---
never called it a game, but if you enter an arena with a kill/death score and a leaderboard the qualifier "game" would not be missplaced.
---
&gt;It wasn't about the client, it was about the server
---
True, but we don't see the servers, we just saw a shitshow on screen. I would guess most Eve-players have the scope to understand what was going on, but some likely didn't and external viewers just zap in, see a buggy mess and then leave with a bad impression.
---
&gt;What's the point of a tech demo to drive things smoothly
---
If you Tech was never tested, maybe start small with fewer servers and then work your way up. Making something and then immediately try to lift the biggest load you can imagine was doomed from the start. I better hope they got everything they wished for because they won't get a second chance and get away with a similar disastrous display.
---
I'd sell my kidney for some eve trans tokens thanks
---
No. I am very sad, my tears are flowing down the drains as I cuddle my pillow. Sometimes I cry myself to sleep because I selled my wife for internet konnektion to play eve online. And now its ALL ruined. I am broke without any ISK, I cannot pvp and I cannot mine because I dont have any ship!!
---
I dont know what to do with life. :(
---
I guess that does depend on your interpretation of "any good way". Beep beep. 
---
Skins and the sheer cost of doing that.
---
Rapid lights and heavies are the long range system while torpedos are short range (more in line with rockets and HAMs).
---
It's not entirely continuous. 
---
lel, he doesn't get invited to parties. .. 
---
Sorry guys, It's us UK types. With Brexit around the corner we have been moving our savings out of the GBP into alternative markets.
---
It doesnt cost nothing if you are NC. Becuase you never undock.
---
As far as it goes it really depends how much you jump around with your supers / titans and how much you use your doomsdays. It is very low amounts of fuel, personally I am not sure if I use 1 bil of fuel a month.
---
I get that, but for continuity it would make sense for haws to use smaller ammo too. 
---
So like, fucking majority. Lmao
---
I'm just mad that I cashed out 5 days ago instead of waiting a few more days.
---
When was the last time you saw the sun?
---
True, but that's a change made for balance. Phoenixes having rapid cruises would be retarded. 
---
plus in missile launchers more capacity, faster rate of fire
---
Well done. Give her a Golden Magnate killmail.
---
Guns are different to missiles; the skills aren't equal. Guns have a dozen different types of ammo; missiles have normal, t2 damage and t2 application. And faction but whatever.
---
If haws used smaller ammo, you'd have to go through and do that with all the other 'undersized' guns.
---
Or you can just not care, and the phoenix has slightly cheaper ammo for what's not a great ship for null 
---
&gt; Bois you are up for a hell of a surprise when TQ ends up like the chinese server and tops 2K players at best
---
Can't wait tbh.
---
I really don't see the upside of a 5min cyno. What's the point? Just fly a cynofrigate. It's so incredibly cheap and has the upside of being able to be flown by low SP Alts, hiding the Info of who will actually drop onto you until the cyno is up.
---
What’s null? 
---
&gt; never called it a game, but if you enter an arena with a kill/death score and a leaderboard the qualifier "game" would not be missplaced.
---
Yes but it's not about the game inside it, it was about how the server handle it. There is no point in even remotly discussing the gameplay.
---
&gt; True, but we don't see the servers, we just saw a shitshow on screen. I would guess most Eve-players have the scope to understand what was going on, but some likely didn't and external viewers just zap in, see a buggy mess and then leave with a bad impression.
---
That's their own fault ?
---
&gt; 
---
What tells you they never did that ? They clearly had the ability to hadd 6k AI players, what makes you think they never did that before ?
---
If it hits 4b i will sell some accounts
---
ok thanks for letting us know.... bye
---
Indeed, i was just saying. 
---
I want to know why Dual 150mm Railguns use medium instead of small charges.
---
Pretty much. I also think the insurance system is kinda dated nowadays. It made sense in the beginning of EVE when ISK was hard to come by, but nowadays the ISK faucets need to be slashed wherever possible.
---
Lemme guess: the last Delve spawn?
---
Pretty much my point for haws, you get my doot
---
It actually gives you money, as it removes all chances of ever kissing a girl and thus paying for her shit
---
The point of SP is to gradually introduce more complex elements of the gameplay. If those gates are removed, the game becomes nothing more than a free-for-all with no depth. Unlocking higher skills gives the player a sense of accomplishment, which builds investment in the game. Taking that away just makes Eve an arcade game.
---
To fin a good HS for logistic you need to probe, to roll and to have faith in BOB.
---
A dedicated DST alt is a real plus and it's prety common in WH.
---
When we have a good HS, we just move our stuf and we help people without DST. also, never come back empty, the corp always need stuff
---
grr goons
---
That boring part of space. 
---
Exactly, keep a history of your previous names. Just like employment history. Then I'll have no problem with it whatsoever.
---
So, the actual isk multiplier (3.33) did not change.
---
First, nobody use dollar comparaison outside of big media outlets.
---
Second, it depends on how you use it. If you just stay dock, it literally cost nothing. If you use it say for battle, you have to get some fuel and ammo but it's pretty much pocket money compared to the price of the thing.
---
Did someone see my tomatoes?
---
So you made a ganking alt and applied, like every other CODE member?
---
Highsec code or WH code?
---
&gt;Yes but it's not about the game inside it, it was about how the server handle it. There is no point in even remotly discussing the gameplay.
---
True, but how finished is this tech if the Server cannot communicate my Client the Position of more than 3 People and a bunch of torpedoes?
---
&gt;That's their own fault ?
---
Telling someone it's their fault they don't understand it, doesn't magically make them or people they talk about it with magically like it. Looks matter, and if you first mayor test looks like shit (even if you broadcast it far and wide "IT'S A SUCCESS BOIS") its just not as good as if the first test ran more smoothly.
---
&gt;What tells you they never did that ? They clearly had the ability to hadd 6k AI players, what makes you think they never did that before ?
---
I argued the same point in another thread and i was told they said on stream that Ai Players don't create the same stress as normal players do. This actually made everything even worse in my mind. If you accept that players create more stress than Ai, then they shot for even higher Load than they did get. The Servers propably would have imploded if the 10K People they wanted actually showed up. They got 3-4K and couldn't even handle that. They propably just piled on 7K Ai extra just to say "we had over 10K, everything is good guys".

I suspect he will run a long con to pilfer 5 catalysts instead of one. CODE beware!
---
Depends on scale, price range/sp (total budget fit or t2) and your goal.
---
Assuming t1 fit, you want buffer frigates. Mwd blaster Merlins are decent for going in to brawl, punishers with AB if you want to survive with reps but don't want to catch people as easily. LML Kestrel are good for harassment. Hookbills are cancer but more expensive. Having one ewar ship like a maulus can mitigate how much you are farmed by solo garmurs and whatnot.
---
Usually newbies prefer to fleet up in destroyers because a group of them can usually get a kill or two while only being marginally more expensive than a frigate and pilot experience is less relevant for applying or avoiding dmg due to better projection, worse speed and sig radius.
---
Underrated comment. Bitches ain't cheap nowadays.
---
how is that anti-semitic
---
he was ganked im m-o in his supercarrier....hint.... dont aggro  on undock..just  if u have cyno somewhere jump on it,undocking super on sisi is  big banner "practice target"...there was adressed problem with corpse collectrs attacking structures and ships outside  testing system m-o...  ccp  does not ban anymore anylonger unless  infraction is  very severe....blowing up abandoned ships/citadels on sisi is fine. but  i think ccp shuld delete wormhole citadels like they remove poses. 
---
another problem with  sisi is  supercarriers and moveme,i was waiting for friend  in moros in jita 4-4 then one of goons  warped his nyx fired 3 shadow sets and blow me up.. we swap roles and he took dread  and i took supercarrier and we tested it out, no criminal for using shadow "true sacrifice" ability,my dread was one shot killed.
---
problems with sisi are bigger than we can imagine,evryone fly supercarrier or titan and its  impossible to do 1vs1 subcap without getting  titan dropped. if ccp could   reduce super/titan spawn  by stripping capital parts from market on sisi and delete evryones supercarrier/titan aswell we would  live longer,people would still have t build them but with no seeding capital parts they would need build those first so for around two months sisi would be healthy and better place for testing. 
---
Not if you're there to adjust stront levels.

im fine with ccp adding an in game link when the servers go up, with a lil hyperlink to log in and join the fun. if they do this again, you then not only get those who turn up, but maybe a few who are docked in eve ship spinning
---
Just curious how would people pvping against one another and doing pve in your space against one another affect your game play? Especially if they can't shoot you without a wardec or unless you're in lowsec? A logical answer would be nice. Because the way I see it, it's not really different from red vs blue hanging out in highsec and fighting each other. 
---
Are alts just secondary chars on the same account, or do you create a whole new CCP account (that you then pay for?) Can alts/secondaries log into the game and play simultaneously (the launcher seems to imply this is possible, i.e. "added 1 account to the startup queue")? In general, how are alts used and what are some cool things you can do with them?
---
Why on earth would I waste the effort on Catalysts? I was thinking more along the lines of a wallet division or an Upwell structure.  Who knows how far I can go?  For now I'll just keep my head down and play the good line member.  I like to think of the damage I am doing now as more subtle. Leaked Intel to interested parties, missed gank opportunities.  That sort of thing.
---
I imagine you've seen "The Imitation Game"?  Remember, the Brits didn't ruin their accomplishment of cracking Enigma by running out and winning every battle.  They took it slow and won the war.  That's where I'm headed.

The faction capital gun requires a T2 gun in its build, so it's not really a surprise they can use T2 ammo.  I don't know if the faction subcap guns.

so you returned to eve, and immediately spent all your isk into a 'deal' someone was giving to you.

buy plex and get like REALLY good money for it.

In what way can you interpret blitzing t3 bioadaptives to be “any good way” to collect abyssal mats? It’s bad advice. You’re inflicting your own lack of knowledge on others. 
---
&gt; he drove me like a cart in a supermarket. 
---
that's what google translate has that at. if so, that's hilarious
---
It's a conspiracy, I tell you.
---
everybody hates goons too.. should we insult them with death threats and ban them?
---
Then you’re a fucking moron. Non blob alliances have to rely on people multiboxing PvP in fleets to be able to compete with the f1 60 IQ Zerg retards such as yourself and the rest of your coalition
---
@Op I feel bad that questions like yours will just get stupid canned answers from noobs. I assume you need mats because you live somewhere that makes it difficult to just import them. PM me and I’m happy to privately pass on some tips for making the most of your abyssal dives. 
---
Interesting stuff. 
---
So much PLEX ammounts to almost 35m3 of cargo. 
---
yes thats it.
---
I assume it is one of those cases where someone put up a buy order a BPO at an unrealistic price, but with a minimum sale of 1500 units of the item, meaning nobody is likely to be able to collect enough of them to fulfill it. Then, sell a couple of the BPO's at an inflated but lower price close by, and hope that people don't notice.

sorry my  warp core stabilisers just exploded

its sisi mate. it literally does not matter other than when CCP needs it to mass test stuff.
---
If you do 1b/hour ALL methods will be a pain in the ass. You will need research, logistics, a shitton of minmaxing and dedication. I know it's not 1b/hour and it's being killed right now but even super-rating needs a lot of attention and minmaxing if you want the highest profit. 
---
You can still take a venture I to plexes which has 1 inbuilt, and you can still cap larges with a 6 WCS vni.
---
Strange, the Blood Raider citadel in the 8/10 is extremely easy compared to what you said...
---
Passive armor and hull tank, and rep quite a high amount of shield between shots, so a Nightmare is extremely easy to use in this case. I do agree that it doesn’t stop the repping, no matter how far I am from the citadel.

Question regarding the FAX rep power. Before FAX it was triage carriers right ? Did triage carriers had significantly less rep powers than FAXes ?

Can't wait for those frking noobs to finally fuck off from my game and stop getting in the way of all my 60 rorqual and super bots.

It will be so much easier to make BIG ISK without them.

its not autoban its auto-removal.  why it has been placed?

There's nothing quite like needing to fit a meta AB to actually get a 'tar fully online.

soon  30day omega time will take 50b month what u gonna do
---
point 5 you say people not happy buying it to sub thier account are in the minority -
---
no, they are only in the minority because of the fact of your point 4. which is the majority is 1 dood with 30 accounts,
---
so the people complaining about plex price are not the minority, they are the majority of REAL PEOPLE, with a minority of accounts.
---
otherwise nice thread, i mean, we all know this but, nothing will be changed and from what i can tell recently ccp are scared shitless to make any drastic change to really affect things in thier game these days.
---
homeless are free.
---
Your text was one awesome way to miss the point entirely. Your client usage stats and observations are totally useless, it's a server-side test. 
---
My understanding from within the client was that as you say, at around 3.7-4k players, they added 5k AI players, and then started bringing more players in, in two waves, ending up with a total player count around 10k (14-15k total pilots). I think it would be interesting to know whether they considered that many players would just constantly spam missiles - I suspect the number of entities they were having to track was over 10,000 well before they reached 3k players.
---
I found the pop-in of targets/missiles as the server recalculated what to tell my client about very disconcerting, presumably a function of very short 'relevant to me' distance settings on thte server for what information to send my client. I was impressed that I did start having increased spans of functioning client behaviour, and significantly less rubber-banding towards the end of the test, going from only 2 kills over the first 40 minutes due to non-registering of missile launch/hit, to 30+ kills by the end of the hour.
---
Did you stick around for the whole test or only for the first 30 minutes? What you described was very reflective of my experience during the first half.
---
You say this as if we aren't many years down the Chinese server path already.
---
Can't argue with this. Luckily, can't yet confirm it either. :D
---

eve music was changed recently. at least 50% of eve doesnt play with sound.
---
and are you serious? theyve added so many ships in the last 7 years, and changed mostly all of them balance wise, look wise, added the dreaded skins.
---
added new guns to put on dreads and titans.
---
completly reworked the carrier fighters system.
---
citadels are brand new POS's (i hate these things btw)
---
plenty of reworked deployables
---
abyssal mods?
---
7years any to come back and say eve hasnt changed is deaf dumb and/or blind 
---
&lt;3
---
Great heat management, well done
---
They did 3 waves of players added - first to about 4k, then they added 5k AI, then they added two more waves of about 3k players each until about 15k pilots at end of the test.
---
I am on the side of the people I play with, propaganda or not. But im shooting pandas cuz you guys are actually fun to shoot at and get shot by. None of that NCdock crap so far. Frat keep on bringing the fights!!! You guys are awesome enemies!
---
which ccp has apparently totally forgotten about. 
---
considering the haw guns are multiple battleship sized guns on each hardpoint, i agree
---
he expected to be vetted. That's cute. 
---
Right, I also think direct interfering from CCPs side (putting up sell orders with loads of PLEX) wouldn't change anything in the long run. I'm afraid it might take a drastically change in game design (just like the introduction of skill injectors)  to get this situation under control.
---
This would be funny if it wasn’t so sad. Did you really ignore every single comment in your last thread? It’s probably best if you just calm down, but your permit, and follow the rules like a good little Gallant. 
---
Vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
---
and the faction guns for quite a while (not sure if they still are) where cheaper than the t2 guns. and with dreads, thats a pretty big deal :D
---
Ii dispute your claim of most generic name ever. I have a gank alt literally named Generic Garsk. 
---
wait wat, i can't sell my titan for dollars? reee
---
if you have a ganking alt x up!  
---

Ah, could have been, of all the scams to fall for, that is probably one of the better ones.

---
Hell yeah brother, cheers from Nullsec
---
The biggest problem I see with the idea is that it would be difficult to keep that of which alts belong to which groups. It should be a limited use (one or three times over the life of a character) to prevent abuse. It should also cost more than a character transfer.
---
Another thing is we should really be able to make notes on corp and alliance contacts.

He’s not wrong...

DD'ing, jumping and bridging are the only things that will make a bill.   
---
So therefore it depends on how much you do any of those things. ISK wise if you bridge big fleets all the time it could come down to 1-2 bill which is approximately $20.

Apologies, I know sarcasm doesn't translate well in text... but that was sarcasm. These "issues" are not at all important. they are cosmetic for the most part when the game needs actual changes made and improved. the ability to change your name or gender.
---
It is that easy, if you have time to play the game but can't find time to work for 2-4 hours to pay a sub, then your life is probably fucked up in some way and you shouldn't be gaming anyway. 
---
I'd give the excuse to those with an incredibly fixed income, and also heavily disabled.

Man, i love your style. So fresh and not condescending at all.

Vily wouldn’t lie to us about you. Are you implying he would? Also who else are we going to blob out of the game otherwise?

Why so much hate? 
---
This has to be the best bait comment i have seen in a month. :D
---
&gt; The point of SP is to gradually introduce more complex elements of the gameplay 
---
10 years ago maybe, SP is just a time gate or an excuse for CCP to ask for extra money now.
---
&gt; Unlocking higher skills gives the player a sense of accomplishment 
---
Just like opening loot boxes right?
---
&gt; which builds investment in the game.  
---
"Investment in the game" isn't going to worth shit if the game is in constant stream of re-balancing.
---
It will be addressed . 
---
1) They can be both, but usually people refer to alts on secondary accounts. Many people have multiple (beyond 2) accounts.
---
2) Yes. You can log in as many Omega accounts as you want at the same time, but Alphas can only ever (legally) be played by themselves.
---
3) Well, some people have alts for flying capitals or rorquals or other isk-making things. I use my alt in PvP to fly small tackle ships (Stiletto/Sabre/etc.) while I fly my main in combat ships. Some use alts to spy on other alliances and provide useful intel for their main group. The sky is the limit in how you use your alts. 
---
We already have name changes. It's called extraction and injecting. Might as well just let people rename or resex their toons too.

People just extract and make.new toons now. So they can be unknown .

As u/Andy3021 said, I too can confirm that you will receive the new payout on your insurance even if you paid for the old insurance.
---
I feel like a lot of us presumed our insurance agreements would be honored in the terms they were made. I suicided a capital last night strictly for the old insurance payout and I had one day left on it. I'm rather unhappy now.

---
Sounds like you’ll mainly be documenting missed/thwarted ganks.
---
yeah this so much, never knew you didnt have to have one until later
---
If they can charge plex for it, and they can do it, they will.  I suspect their steadfast opposition to doing it over the years has little to do with game play, as they like to spin it, and more to do with legacy code that uses the character's name in database breaking ways and would make it way more work to implement than you'd think.
---
Still, it might have a shot.  It's a potentially revenue generating feature, and revenue generating features cut to the front of the line these days, I'm sure.

I disagree with the premise that the housing bubble was caused by generic supply and demand forces. The banks caused it by putting people in houses that they couldn't afford, which caused them to get foreclosed on by the banks, which drove down property values of everyone in the neighborhood. Most affected were people who had 15-20+ years already paying on their mortgage and their neighborhood fell into disrepair due to foreclosed homes everywhere. People that actually had the money to pay refused to, because the collateral for the loan wasn't worth the payment that they were making.
---
Of course this was legal due to Bill Clinton's efforts getting bad laws passed in the 90s that allowed banks to loan to people who didn't have the credit worthiness to be trusted with such responsibilities.
---
This leads in to the political debate... Republicans believe all humans don't deserve all the things, and Democrats believe that everyone is a good person and should have all the things. A discussion for a different sub, or preferably on a different platform altogether.

Obviously you've never tried to build new software or hardware.
---
AFAIK they had more rep power than fax, but they had to combat refit to either have rep, or to regen capa (someting along those line)
---
In the core of faction capital guns we have t2 guns, but faction subcapital guns in the core use t1 guns
---
No it doesnt.
---
Unless youre competing for who can mine the most ore with x number of rorq alts. Or who can drop the most titans.
---
Ive been single char/account my entire EVE career. Been working fine for me.
---
Real life doesn't matter tho. EVE is serious business.
---
&gt; Or who can drop the most titans.
---
Literally the reason that the largest groups in the game exist. 
---
Torn on this. As someone who has purchased a character from the bazaar at  multiple points in my eve life and gotten stuck with names like 'Commander Amanda,' no offense to the original owner, I would love the ability to change names... at least on characters you purchased from someone else. Also, I do not see any need to have a name follow you around in this case. 
---
The problem is, I have no idea how you do this, because you cannot link it to a character transfer. Otherwise, anyone could change their names by making a new account and paying $20. 
---
This does not work for me because... this is EVE. Your name is capital, both good and bad... so you absolutely should not just be able to say, scam the shit out of people, rob your corp/alliance, or even gank someone and this just hide yourself by paying $20. 
---
Use eve.exe to start your account. No launcher
---
nice
---
So basically they had some kind of burst and then had to cool down and regen cap.
---
Sounds like a good system to me for FAXes, not necessary in the form of combat refit but maybe having to activate some kind of mid slot to regen capacitor but nerfing a lot rep power for the time it's caping up. And obviously removing 3200s.
---
I mean he did say biomass. Clearly he is RPing. :D 
---
BTW, the above is sarcasm. Also, please remember that eve is about pixels. Take a deep breath and walk away if your pixel losses (on test, wtf?) make you feel like telling someone to kill themselves. 
---
[https://newedenreport.com/](https://newedenreport.com/)
---
Have you decided to take offense too?
---
Oh, for a second I thought we were discussing something else NSFW. 
---
Then why are you even playing dude? There is literally a million other games that you could play instead of complaining about the rules and mechanics in Eve
---
I personally stopped reading it because they kept subtly taking sides. Not that I think they did it on purpose, just more like the people doing the pieces don't seem overly bothered with getting both sides before publishing. After seeing "reports" of fights I witnessed myself being reported half-assedly like that, I kind of lost trust in everything else they published.
---
Rigs already fitted too
---
How's the warp speed?
---
You know insurance on subcaps didn't change right? If I had my way personally, insurance would be removed from capitals entirely while subcaps insurance remains unchanged from its current state.  I'm okay with capitals being strong as long as there is risk associated with using them but even with these insurance nerfs it's still pretty safe.  Also kills, loot, and general content from roams are their own objective to a degree.
---
Please explain how this scam works? If you bought multiple blue prints you can sell them at different stations. Also, you just come back after 5 years and you immediately start clicking on contract adverts in Jita/fall for a contract scam? Even after 5 years you should know better. 
---
Theres more to the game than capitals and who can plex the most accounts. Subcaps dont need 5-10 accounts.
---
I thought they liked to suffer. Isn't that why they live in WHs to begin with?
---
If there isn't anything to report, you won't really see news.
---
&gt;With your attitude we'd never have airplanes since so many of the first attempts crashed, killing the pilots.
---
Well, did we load 200+ Passengers into the first planes like into the planes today?
---
&gt;We'd never have gone to the moon due to the early disasters in space flight.
---
There is a reason the first tries to get Material into orbit or further away were unmanned or tested with Animals first.
---
I never said don't test with 10K People, but i think we can agree that we don't put 200 People in an untested Airplane unless we tested with less People first and are as certain as possible everything will work.
---
I do find it funny that CCP produces a massive balance devblog full of fairly game-changing shit like diminishing returns on reps, and the thing that gets memed is that one of the minor "throw it in" balance changes that help a bad ship wasn't a radical enough shift to make it good.
---
But when lambo

And now you've proven you're a dribbling retard.

have you actually looked at the hulltank / plates max ehp on the moros? its pretty much the same. with a pretty cheap implant to increase the amount of hull availabble compared to the armour choices. 
---
only thing is it cant really recieve reps if making it out of siege.
---
hulltank moros is pretty frekin cheap tho even with t2 rigs
---
I understand that idea, but honestly, you should have a little more common sense than to use those kinds of names.

Trying 10K comes close to "we can send a car into orbit, lets send 200 People to mars next".
---
If anything rebalance capital Arty... Put them in line with the rest. The should have a Michael higher alpha and super slow rof. Be very good in tidi fights for when you need to only get one cycle off before you dc and cat do anything.
---
If it works for the Abaddon, itll work for the Avatar. Gotta maintain that racial consistency.
---
Hellcat Avatars when?
---
Those changes will indeed be good. I just hope there will be enough players left online to try them out.
---
And the state of sov+rorqual spam don't have easy solution for now.
---
You don't learn much from merely doubling sample sizes - you need to go up by orders of magnitude. And even of they had done smaller test, you'd still be crying about hard-put you are.
---
Test is the game on easy mode
---
There once was a time where instead of every ratting ship being a VNI/Ishtar/Gila, the normal ratting/escalation ship was a battleship. 545dps is nothing to a battleship.
---
Sov isn't really in a particularly bad state. Infinite mineral faucets need to die in a fire. People need more/better tools for disrupting each others economic activity.

Using the old bin method. I'll give it a go, thanks

Of all the fucked up, broken shit in Eve, you effort post about 720mm artys?
---
Nah dawg
---
&gt;You don't learn much from merely doubling sample sizes 
---
How do you know?
---
&gt;And even if they had done a smaller test, you'd still be crying about hard-done you are.
---
I propably wouldn't even have known about it in the first place since they wouldn't have had to hype it up that much.
---
I know because this is the sort of shit I do for a living. 
---
You're still trying to portray yourself as some sort of victim - get over yourself, grow up and get some perspective.
---
So, I just sat back and absorbed this comment. One day we as humans will shed trying to be cool in favor of using logic and intelligence.
---
For now, we have small victories such as this joyous example
---
I said "can" because if you are an idiot you won't learn anything from either success or failure; but yeah, failure is the best teacher.
---
I want my make character the ability to wear skirts. 
---
Our lord and saviour, 8chan
---
Wholeheartedly agree. 
---
I'm inclined to believe that most people don't even care, they're just (ab)using the report system as a weapon to get their in-game enemies in trouble when they say f*g in local chat. If they really cared about the rules or the language, they'd report their friends too.

---
We've not seen that trend in EVE. 
---
Or converting it to latinum and keeping it in a second stomach
---
Realistic station cargo limits and docking space would help with the jita problem. But that's another discussion. It just feels like people need to spread out from the hubs. 
---
Not be a poor and buy time instead of Plex at a cheaper rate.
---
if you do 6 or 8 and just grab the bio and a few close things will you have more than spending the full 20 mins doing 3 an hour grabbing everything?
---
I think that is the point being made
---
They mentioned using T2 for faction builds a year or more ago and allowing T2 ammo in faction guns. They might have forgotten about it in the rush to sell extractors to make them more palatable to PA.
---
They made a forum thread about 11K people wanting to participate. 🤭
---
Is it just me or does the csm seem like an echo chamber filled with yes men
---
Not really seeking instant gratification, more of the ability to experience null sec as it was back in 2003
---
I would resub for that haha!
---
Invest what you have left in those trade hub schemes that double your ISK......
---
Uh of course I'm playing other games along with eve. I care about eve so I go here to post stuff about the game.
---
Subcap guns don't lead to many extractor sales. Capital guns do.
---
Explain something obvious to an asshole and the asshole will think you took offense.
---
And lower damage (even if the gun fires T2 ammo, you don't get T2 skill damage bonus)
---
Just start a bunch of alphas and train them to 5m sp, when the pack is applied train the month and extract the skill points for more or less your money back
---
PLEXIT!
---
Nope, T2 guns do more damage with any ammo
---
&gt;You're still trying to portray yourself as some sort of victim - get over yourself, grow up and get some perspective. The only thing this cost you was a tiny bit of your time.
---
When did i do that? 
---
&gt;The only thing this cost you was a tiny bit of your time.
---
I didn't. I watched the first youtube stream that happened to pop up (markee) lose time.
---
I just wanted to argue that making such a public test and expect total failure before the test even starts (by issues you yourself created by inviting way too many people) creates unnecessary negativity. If they implement this in the future and we have even the slightest similar Problems, it will be very easy for someone to pop aether test and those problems into a video and post it to reddit, which will propably blow up. 
---
But it's what the people want
---
What is that least point about?
---
Common type alt are : 
---
-Scout alt in covops
---
-Capital alt (faxe /carrier/titan ect)
---
-Market alt
---
-Krabbing Alt
---
-PI alt
---
-Tackling alt

Do you have a price target for profit taking? I can almost see light at the end of the tunnel for mine.
---
Remember in 2007 when celebrations were had as EVE broke 10k concurrent players for the first time?
---
Pepridge Farm remembers.
---
Your not my dad
---
For crying out loud - if a test, a genuine stress test succeeds the first time, then the test failed and wasted everybody's time. You want there to be failures, you want everything to break so you know what needs to be fixed. Failure of a test is not a negative, it's a positive that makes things better.
---
The thing is most people are happy with the game changing ...changes. They make sense, at least on paper. That leaves the 'left field' minor changes to get picked on. It just so happens to be a Caracal change. It it was some bullshit change to virus strength on the Astero or dropping the Gila drone damage (instead of HP) to 350% or 400% it would be getting memed right now. The Caracal change is just 'yeah it's still going to be in a bad spot, what's the point?' sort of position.

Jesus what word  "pulchritudinous". Had to google that one, thanks!

Sov doesn't appear to be in a bad state only because nobody does sov warfare (reason why nobody does needs to be looked at).

---
&gt; don't seem overly bothered with getting both sides before publishing.
---
/s yea, i mean after all they are making huge sums of money off this.  
---
this is the dumbest statement i've seen in a while. They collected reports from people who actually took the time to describe the fights. IF your side didn't bother to do shit about reporting the fights, then you have yourself to blame. 
---
Not 'some' just torps right?

You can already buy these Eve packs that come with plex and other items you can sell. I bought into this and my new character had 2 billion isk on day one. I remember when I had to mine in a friggin Osprey for months to gain wealth. Third is where Eve fails right now. Your time and effort is meaningless.

You're right, i read up on the Website. I was under the impression this was a tech demo since everybody calls it a tech demo, infact you yourself called it a tech demo too.

In a stress tess you obviously want to break stuff.

It's almost like you took the time to make surer there wasn't a thread about this already.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b3h0sw/died_to_a_mining_barge/
---
It won't. If it lowers because of what ever sales CCP makes, skill injecting will keep going on and people ratting like crazy still have a fuck ton of isk.
---
The high demand is still there. Temporary high stock will lower the price, for about no time at all it will go up. Many will be smart and will buy a lot of it while it still low
---
I am torn between my enemies changing names and renaming my characters I created while drunk
---
Completely agree. Let me provide some background;
---
In WoW, after name change and realm change (server change) became things, it lost a lot of it's soul. Realms (servers) no longer had the same community feeling, and your actions lost any social implications. Because if you somehow managed to get known, you could easiely change your name or switch to anothe realm.
---
Name change is one of the last things I want to see in eve.
---
Even if balance is terrible, we still have a sense of ***community***. Adding name changes would greatly affect this.
---
I dont camp gates in titans i use procurers and it hilarious because he died to a procurer lol

Minmitar - cool haircuts

you're choosing to ignore all the time and preparation that goes into the hunt or do you think those 200+ blopses and 3 uniques just casually flocked over to his cyno and waited for him to kill them?
---
I did it, to see the novelty on 2-3 anoms when I got my titan. It was fun to see the numbers fly by. Wasn't for me, though. I used to really like carrier/super ratting- but it is really button click intensive over periods of time more than an hour.
---
I'm just judging them on what they claim to be. Read their about page, it's all detailed there. They claim to report facts, that they don't rush, and that they check sources. I'm simply saying they have failed to do so, rushing news out while only having found part of the story.
---
If they want to be just another biased EVE news sources, that's fine. We've got plenty of those. But if you claim to be some sort of unbiased journalist, I'll hold you to a higher standard. - Also, if you want to play that part, you can't just whine about people not feeding you data. It's your role to chase the info, not everybody else's job to feed it to you.
---
A FRT attempt to spin the narrative.

A middling level troll that is just very active so people keep engaging. I'm honestly surprised it as so many comments.

There is simply a certain level of unnecessary complexity that needs to be achieved or the game just doesn't fucking work, okay?

Yeah we blame our CEO, Nash, for everything too. Usually works. Haha

r/woooosh? XD
---
CCP has forgotten alot of things, im new and even I know that 
---
I don't see how it is good after a few months of fighting Goons prefer to accept reparations form their enemies instead of actually have to grind through all of Deklein/Branch.
---
Regions they do not need anyway (this time they really don't need them).
---
The largest group in eve got exhausted from all the mindless sov grinding after blowing up a keepstar or 2, because there are tens more left.
---
 To that, you can add the actual sov system which is utter garbage - a bunch of dudes watching paint dry while the toaster ships are done. And the other side either does not show up or they drop all their titans on the poor bastards inorder to secure the timer or snipe the toasters, if they do that in subcaps.
---
Fun times and I am glad CSM members recognize how 'fun' those are.
---
Let's see how fun the war between FRT and Ruskies in the south is. I haven't heard shit about it since it started.
---
It's like 70m/day.
---
Still cheap given what you can earn passively from industry, science, reactions and PI.
---
The problem is... can I be fucked to keep my lines running in order to earn the isk just to keep the account running?
---
I'm not sure.
---
Plex isn't expensive relative to how easy it is to earn jsk, but maintaining the income is tedious.
---
It is even good spin. It's horrible.
---
And new skins. 
---
See look at that  I could work at CCP.
---
I can concur. My PI brings in about 10b a month. I enjoy it, but it is time consuming and the fact that I have to do it- can't take breaks, have to spend the time, makes it somewhat tedious. It's just one of those equations where we ask ourselves... is it worth my time to do this? A year ago it was 12-15 hours for the rorqual squadron. Today it's 22 hours. I probably mine less than 4-5 hours a month at this point, so that's on me I guess. Also, for the people turbo turbo turbo mining, a few more hours probably doesn't impact them.
---
You call this commitment? 
---
How unamusing.
---
But you can not accept them
---
I got a 32m tick in my rattlesnake... pretty big news

eve pve is terrible except maybe abyss stuff. id rather pay irl and have fun. instead of having to mindlessly grind to plex to keep playing and do even more boring grinding.

Did the aggro tables for Carrie/super carrier fighters changed? from 3/21/2019 after downtime I reallyse the rats aggro my fighters more.

Late to this party, but what I heard in this part "the unfit (???????) of the Flow"
---
was "the unfit will unfold in the flow"
---
Jintaans suggestion would be dope tho.
---
&gt;There is no room in this game for that kind of crap.

Unless of course you're Mittani.

If you type "lol" at the end of everything does it make you feel like less of a weenie whistle?

This game could really use a consistent, up-to-date and neutral in-game news service. I was really hoping 1900 news would be it, as I can't be bothered anymore to read the propaganda crap on INN and Evenews24.
---
Not going to happen, no matter what they change. So accept and adapt
---
Yup, we nuked it. 
---
BUY HIGH SELL LOW
---
&gt;My PI brings in about 10b a month.
---
Across how many accounts is this?
---
the sad part is , I bet tiericide would be done in a month with player concensus if they simply let the players decide.
---
Hear me out, what if you started in 2006 and you picked the most retarded name ever and its WAAAAY to late to fix it. 
---
You are literally dumb. Like, I could write essays on how dumb you are but that really is a waste of digital space. I'll say this, the 1900 is time consuming and depends on many factors, like people talking to NER reporters. 
---
You want news to be less biased? Have people talk to us. We have a public discord, we have people who put themselves out of there and NER has people like me who chase leads only to get stonewalled by thickheaded idiots like yourself who amaze me every day that you manage to breath and walk at the same time.

Nice little devblog, seems like it was a good stress test - hopefully parts of the tech will be beneficial for EVE some time in the future

Yes its worth asking your Corp if thye have anyone willing to haul it for you.
---
You might have ot pay but I know I had no problem doing hauling for free or cheap for my corpmatss 
---
You can.

i heard right now it is 70m isk per day for one account. Thats like 4 forsaken Rally points with a vni which takes a little over 2 hours.

---
Thought this was an ilmeca post. Left disapointed. 
---
FW is supposed to be for smaller groups and PVP beginners, that is the whole reason it was created. Let's keep that in mind.
---
1. Just spitballing ideas, do you have an alternative to the current broken mechanic? Would love to hear it, what this post is for... thought provoking conversation and ideas. Who cares if they gate camp? tama/hikkonen/kinakka are gate camped all the time, most people know to go around.
---
2. FW missions do matter, they water down lp for the guys that actually pvp and lose ships. If they provided content and there was actual risk involved like warp scrammed the first 60 seconds or something then leave em. You sound like you dont want your isk faucet to disappear. 
---
3. the whole point is to provide incentive for those pirate groups to move on. The batphone in FW ruined content. Many times, it turned out to be who could call more people then the smaller group would just blue ball. Zero content there. If all neut structures are in low power then that have some skin in the game to either join or move.
---
4. Good. 
---
5. Wont happen if there are no missions to run. 
---
6. I see your point, but at current activity it is trash. I can jump 3-4 systems without even seeing another player currently in BR. Smaller means less farmers due to pvp players ability to pop into systems more often. 
---
The downvotes on your comment should tell you that your understanding of "normal" is off by miles.
---
I new and undiscovered unexplored galaxy could easily make it happen. With the ability to build gates and stations it just seems like a huge test bed for an even more eve like experience. You could have multiple regions being explored at once as the systems are generated by finding new wormholes leading to systems not already generated previously. These regions could not even be know of by other players outside of the organizations exploring them and setting up infrastructure. 
---
I think just the opposite. I'll start buying plex regularly again.
---
Clarence Beeks at work
---
Those are some serious numbers for a stress test, well done!
---
I hope next time they come to their senses and arrange to do this on a weekend some more people from over the world can participate... maybe the dream of massive battles without TiDi is actually possible.
---
In RL you can change your name anytime.  In eve you should also. I think it would bring a real different angle to things
---
I would also like to remove employment history 
---
Why not?
---
Don't worry, it'll be addressed in the coming updates along with the balancing updates! 
---
*Advance to 2020*
---
We're still working on creating a balance update. More to come!
---
CCP at its finest
---
That's what TEST says.
---
Does not really matter though. The Dino herd needs entertainment and WinterCo is not too far away and has the potential to provide it. Unfortunately TEST and large parts of FRT have very different time zones. :/ 
---
Also the new Russian Coalition (without a name yet, afaik) seems to really need the help from TEST to actually have a chance to do what they claimed they would like to do and conquer Detorid. 
---
We'll see. 
---
uh, welcome to eve?  "a safe place for white christian men"
---
From my uninformed line member perspective Frat are some of the only good guys in the universe. Their combination of willingness to take fights, steadfast opposition to goons, and relative lack of elitism means they’d be the first coalition I’d look into if Horde imploded tomorrow. They also have a history of opposition on the Chinese server to PIBC, which as I understand it is the only group in EVE history to have arguably done even more damage to the community than goons.

I solved this buy buying all ore /minerals that didn't have it, and then build avatar and 3 supers to burn my small pile.        
---
But it starts to grow back.          
---
9 / 25. I do it at 4 day cycles. If you do it daily, which would be an hour of clicking every day moving heads etc you could probably do 59 percent more.
---
Name change dhould only be possibly when transfering char from one account to another
---
years ago they required PI (although probably npc seeded at that point), maybe even some components made from moon materials, and t2 building skills,  at some point CCP simplified it to require only minerals and basic skills.  
---
That said BPCs are only available for a few guns/launchers,  I'd guess most subcap faction weapons are from NPC rat drops. Can buy the empire guns one at a time from LP stores but doubt there are many out there given the underwhelming stats on most. 
---
I'd guess the most common faction weapon system out there would be the CN cruise launcher as everyone was putting them on their ravens for a while,  although that was enough years ago those stockpiles might be effectively out of the game due to player turn over. 
---
hi what was anti-semitic about that comment?
---
It's much less exciting for everyone if you do it that way though.
---
I'm not christian and I feel perfectly welcomed.
---
Not only that but the gate boogaloo mechanic would provide such dynamic gameplay as trade routes and pipelines / chokepoints would be constantly shifting and changing. You could have a region like jove space that the owners work to keep cut off from other regions aside from wormholes but still has stargates connecting the systems within it.
---
 With CCP really pushing to improve this game, day in and day out, I'd fully recommend jumping back in.
---
After 3 years of sov wars, we've decided it's time to try out something new.
---
So should we rename the corporation Sniggerdly [SNIGG] because it has the letters "nigg" in its ticker and corp name? 
---
Are we not allow to use the word "snigger", meaning a form of laughter now? 
---
What about the word "niggle", meaning to cause someone a slight annoyance? 
---
What it boils down to is simple:
---
Are there racist/offensive character names present in EVE? Yes, just the same as there are in pretty much every other online game. This happens when players are given the option to name their characters with relative freedom of expression. 
---
Some people just like to be edgelords on the internet.
---
We have filters in place on character creation but some names make their way through. When they're reported to us, they're taken care of if they breach our policies.
---
Thousands of characters a day are created in EVE Online. It's neither reasonable or practical for us to have a human being sit and manually screen every single character name.
---
See an offensive character name? Report it, it'll be handled. We also have a [specific policy for this](https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/naming-policy-en/). Read it.
---
The tools are right there for you to speak with us about addressing any concerns you have regarding offensive character names. Our Customer Support Team will happily have a dialogue with you about any character names you might find offensive, [so feel free to contact them.](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us)
---
If you're genuinely concerned about this and not just trying to social justice warrior rabble rouse people against CCP, then the door is open for you to file a ticket and have a constructive dialogue with our support staff so that we can take some action on this.
---
It's really not rocket science and we're more than happy to listen to player concerns.
---
HC told me we were at war and to get everything ready to go, literally done nothing of note since.
---
Meh it's just the "all playstyles are valid in the sandbox" crowd. Perhaps one day they'll be willing to extend that tolerance toward the hunters.
---
please name the non-blob alliances that **require** you to have 4 accounts. go ahead.
---
Another solution that could add some interesting game play is to allow ancillary remote armor repairers to apply at the beginning of the cycle when loaded with paste. 
---
It wouldn't make armor OP, as they would still only get 8 cycles before a reload. But it would stop these two shot alpha numbers vs shield. So the logi wing would have to plan reloads carefully, the attacker may stay on grid a little longer until the ancils run out, the armor fleet could try to remove as much enemy dps as possible while the logi is loaded up and hope to remove enough to hold with regular reps afterwards. 
---
What? No? Who would do such a thing....^/s
---
you must be new to the internet. welcome to the thunderdome.
---
What if, like, once you jumped through the Eve Gate, the background servers collected your information - character info, skills, assets, etc, etc, - and dumped them into the new servers? You get force logged off, and instructed to login to the new client where your internet garage is waiting for you. It would be a neat way to capture data and convert it over to the new system, while maintaining lore, etc. At a certain point, once X amount of pilots are left in old Eve, they convert those over so that the servers. It would be a neat way to track social interactions, too. Similar to what Reddit did with the /r/thebutton

"See an offensive character name? Report it, it'll be handled. We also have a specific policy for this. Read it."
---
you don't have a way to report character names.   you have a policy that is barely enforced.  
---
Should have read my post in the first thread my main man. You're embarassing yourself
---
I like this. And perhaps limit how often a name change can happen. 
---
Faction turrets have the higher base damage mod but with a certain level of the specific specialization skill t2 guns get a higher damage mod. But with faction launchers you get more dps than t2 launchers with faction ammo as faction launchers have a better RoF.  
---
I've spent nearly a decade in FW through almost every change to the mechanics of the zone.  My statement reflects that experience, while yours shows how little you understand how the low-sec environment actually works.  Least of all do you know anything about me or what I stand for.  
---
Small gang PVP in FW plexes has always been my main content area... and right now that area is mostly fine, aside from the overall issue of lowsec and FW being abandoned by so many players.  A warzone wide Cyno-jam would have zero positive impact on increasing solo and small gang content.  It is a poorly thought out proposal that ignores the reality that FW plexes ALREADY have cyno jammers.  
---
My alliance doesn't have a "cap blob."  Every time we undock our caps we risk getting turbo-dropped by much bigger entities.  But the fact is that having caps and using them is content that is valuable to many players.  If that content isn't available in FW, veteran players leave FW.  A feature like cyno-jamming the warzone is badly formulated precisely because it increases the existing pressure on veteran pilots to "outgrow" FW and move on to the very non-FW groups people in this thread are blaming for strangling FW content.

---
I’m not sure if troll, and rip me if I’m taking the bait.
---
Buttt, that doesn’t sound like a blob alliance at all. Most big alliance (Goons, Init, TEST, etc) don’t need all their pilots to mulitbox because they have soooo many fuckin people. While many do, it’s not a requirement to join.
---
Whereas groups like Skill U need their titan pilots to also be the super pilots, and sub-cap pilots, and dread bomb, and FAX wing if they want any chance at punching TEST or Legacy as a whole in the face. And as such they have multi-box requirements in their application requirements 
---
It was pretty cool to be part of this. 
---
Bye, thanks for playing.
---
Faction guns have better Tracking already you bad.
---
The faction turrets have 4.5% higher damage modifier, T2 spec skill gives 2% bonus damage per level so at III you're already doing more damage.
---
Faction launchers have a 4.3% quicker rate of fire, T2 spec skill gives 2% bonus rate of fire, so again at III you're doing more dps.
---
Finally someone with some basic understanding how this shit works. CCP gets teir real money any which way. And if you are poor IRL, grind your isk, play alpha, or GTFO.

Well good news is that non of these characters are actively playing in any group. Meaning (if you are optimistic) that most big groups dont seem to support this kind of shit.
---
This.is.shitposting 
---
Haha, bravo
---
so... basically like real news?
---
lmaooo I spit my drink out when I heard the voice dub over
---
CCP prefers that players give them money for playing the game, and they don't care if it comes from someone buying a subscription, a player buying PLEX for himself or someone buying PLEX to sell on the market; so they don't actually give a fuck about PLEX market price since they win money anyway and it's your own damn problem how much time you spend playing the game to avoid using real money for it, since that will benefit other players and be the same for them.
---
What a shocking conclusion! /s
---
It's the player base that did that, not CCP. 
---
Tbh i am wondering what CCP will do about this speculation.        
---
Fact that PLEX is over speculated is obvious ... that it is an normal in game item also... but at the same it is one item people use to buy stuff from CCP store and pay for the alt accounts.            
---
Simply to say it is one of those things that can actually hurt CCP if speculation either way to far or badly and crash :D              
---
**I am not a big market guy or even state that i understand (or want to understand) EVE market**          
---
From my perspective if someone is deciding to "wait over" this spike by going alpha on some accounts is direct hit to CCP long term income ... as if he don't need those alts for so long ... why even consider to go omega when the dust settles.            
---
That post from him is not even close to what he posted in the Aether War test thread: a rambling multi paragrahed spewing of expletives and pleas for the entire EVE community to f*ck off and die in RL. Might have actually held the record for the most censored post until a notified ISD wiped it completely off the boards. Interesting to see what happens.
---
It originally was planned to be tested on a weekend, but then there were changes, the deal with CCP, and that delayed everything. And then they probably decided short hand that they want to present clear data on the GDC (Game Developer Converence), and decided to present it there live
---
Simple rocket science - rorq multiboxers paying ISK for PLEX are the content that PVP pilots pay RL money for.
---
every 10 unsubed rorq account  = 1 unsubed PVP player.
---
Now that you know this, revise this line once again:
---
&gt;  it **doesn't matter, you're a worthless free loader, GTFO.** 
---
Pretty sure he just doesn't have time. The dude in charge is a student.
---
Give numbers T2 vs Faction.       
---
Check the damage multiplayer and bonus from T2 ammo using T2 guns and then consider signature of stuff they going to shoot.     
---
Your point about CCP not caring if you buy PLEX with ISK is not quite true. If the demand for PLEX fell, and the ISK price came down, it might not be such an attractive option when compared to before, thus PLEX sales for $$$ would come down.
---
But really let's face it. That scenario will never happen. 
---
&gt; gets the perspective of one side of the battle
---
&gt; other side refuses to give interview
---
&gt; writes what they can and checks out with zkillboard\br.inyourspace
---
&gt; called biased by clueless idiots
---
Checks out!
---
No.. it's ridiculous you can drop 100 dreads with very little consequence.  Tbh I'd make the payout even lower... like 200mill lower
---
" **this doesn't matter to CCP, you buying PLEX with ISK does not help them make $$$** "
---
Surely it does? If someone is looking at buying 500plex for $$$ and they can see it's worth 1.5bn, then later it's 2bn (price driven up by people buying Plex with ISK) purchasers for $$$ are getting more return on investment. 
---
Plex used to be 350m for a month. Surely, players buying PLEX for $$$ now are getting more like 2bn. That's a huge difference. If someone wanted to fund PvP, or whatever, buying Plex for $$$ they are more likely to do so the higher the ISK price of PLEX is?
---
If I could pay you $15 for a token that entitles me to 100 free oranges, and the next month it's 200 free oranges, I'm more likely to buy the token? 
---
Whoa. Rude. 
---
That's a good explanation, thanks. Now that everything seems to be on track I hope they do it on a sunday or something.
---
OOOOOLLLLDDDDD
---
The point is it's a quick change that makes it better, so they can do it quickly without spending 2-3 days of dev time (which would be better spent making those major changes), and improve the balance of the game. 
---
Will it fix the CNI? No. Will it leave the CNI better than where it was? Yes. Can CCP change it in the future to make it more better? Yes. Is there a downside to them tacking on this change to a major balance overhaul? No.
---
We just love messing with nips. 
---
Hmm ok thanks that’s all I needed to hear
---
should go to tumblr and see how many users show up with nigg in their name.
---
heck, skip nigg, spell out the whole word and check.  or reddit, twitter, facebook ,google,youtube.
---
Your last line nailed it, the demand will be there, there will be people who can/will pay with ISK.
---
&gt; Small gang PVP in FW plexes has always been my main content area... and right now that area is mostly fine
---
&gt; aside from the overall issue of lowsec and FW being abandoned by so many players.
---
Well, either you haven't been paying attention all these years or you pretend to have no clue, but one of the reasons that the zone has been abandoned is the introduction of citadels and the fact that they favor Caps.............
---
&gt; A warzone wide Cyno-jam would have zero positive impact on increasing solo and small gang content.
---
It would allow those small-ship size gangs to contest said resources despite Citadels now being the goals, which the case when FW was blooming because Stations and Plexes were what was fought over, not big-ass Structures.
---
&gt; But the fact is that having caps and using them is content that is valuable to many players. If that content isn't available in FW, veteran players leave FW.
---
Ways to specialize in sub-caps exist and can be further introduced, Caps are an ill-suited content for the zone and is detrimental to what it's trying to achieve ( a low-prep, small-scale, content-fast pvp zone).
---
If those players want to fly Caps, other zones are better suited to it. As long as they don't leave the game I'm fine with that.
---
&gt; it increases the existing pressure on veteran pilots to "outgrow" FW and move on to the very non-FW groups people in this thread are blaming for strangling FW content
---
It won't happen if the zone is designed with FW pilots in mind first. Introduce more ways to specialize with subcaps, commit Structures and Citadels to a side and disallow neutral ones (or at least penalize them), give ways for FW to profit from the warzone, and you will have even the vets staying.
---
No need for caps.

What if you just introduced a type of serial number? Like a social security number or a SIN (system identification number) from shadowrun. 
---
You can call it like CHIP (Capsuleer Historical Identification Pin number). I mean capsuleers already go around with all kinds of implants and shit in them anyway so it's not hard to believe. Just make it like Concord's way of keeping track of pilots or something.

Fake news. He talks about his wife 1:45 in. No way he plays Eve.
---
Yep, The biggest thing to worry about the spike is player/alt retention. There are a lot of people who use PLEX to play, which the spike may drive them away from the game.
---
Do you realized how reddit works? You're not responding to comments, you're responding to your own thread.
---
So, there was apparently some misunderstanding above.  I didn't notice that OP was responding to kylith's point about the LP exploit (which it doesn't look like he understood the key aspect of, that the goons just used FW alts for their exploit) so I was making a more general point about interaction between FW and non-FW pilots.  
---
The problem with your "focus on pvp between FW pilots" mentality is that it goes against the fundamental sandbox nature of EVE.  Everyone exists in the same universe.  CCP will \*always\* be chasing multiple hares all the time, changes to one system will always have butterfly effects to other systems.  
---
FW will always exist concurrently with non-FW pilots.  Feature suggestions should embrace that, because CCP will always have a wider focus beyond FW.
---
I don’t think alphas can use stealth bombers... can we?
---
He had nothing to do with plex prices. 
---
Moronic
---
Amen to that !
---
Wait, I thought the Drek was a dessy, how is it fitting medium mods?
---
It would be very short sighted by CCP not to care about those who buy plex with isk.  
---
If not for them there would be no demand for plex bought with $$.  
---
Eve has been dying, economy has been about to implode or explode, CCP has only cared about $$, players are all leaving and life has been very grim in general since I started playing in 2005. We are mostly all still here and will be for a few years, if the sky doesn't fall.  
---
My opinion is that this has more to do with individuals thinking they're own irritations, problems and worries are shared by the player base as a whole.  
---
PLEX is going up because of inflation.  Look at the monthly economic reports CCP puts out.  ISK flows into the economy via bounties from ratting at a fucking mind blowing rate.  Steady inflation in EVE is a good thing, since it keeps an incentive on industrial production to never stand still.  
---
Now at this point we can pull out our tinfoil hats.  Whether is be from regulating the flow of the ISK fountains, or some cartel agreement on pricing I don't know.  What I do know is that CCP has a financial incentive to set the price of PLEX to cost higher in ISK than the average player earns in a month.  You can take it a step further and find some equilibrium between PLEX in and out of the economy based on price manipulation.  They can (and do) also increase the value of PLEX every time they put skins for PLEX on sale.  
---
The key to remember is that all forms of currency are measures of scarcity, not value.  Value is a subjective microeconomics value.  Scarcity is objective.

---
This is mostly bullshit. 
---
CCP cares not only about revenue, but also about stable player counts and ensuring retention of existing players. Because, obviously, if you're not playing the game then there's no chance you're going to sub again or buy more plex. And if you're not playing the game, you're not in space for somebody to kill, to sell to, to buy from, etc.  Player counts dropping significantly is as big an issue for CCP as a drop in revenue. 
---
When plex goes too high - and arguably it's too high now - you're going to hit a point where players can't keep up and can't plex their accounts, and instead of subbing, they're going to just let the accounts go alpha and go play something else. Nobody wants to spend 20-30 hours a month just grinding so they can go back and do it again the next month.
---
So it's in CCP's interests to ensure that plex prices do not go too high, because it will impact player retention, and that's as important if not more important than simple revenue. 
---
This is a consequence of the range of titan guns and the signature category of all capitals.  Concord guns have almost 11% better tracking, but due to the above it is irrelevant.  
---
T2 Guns do 5.2% more damage on a typical tank titan.  
---
The problem with tracking on guns is that it is very binary compared to optimal range.  Even the smallest frigate in the game can be blapped by titan guns.
---
The other problem is areas where the tracking bonus would be useful, HAWs domiate.  Against MWD battleships, Faction guns give 25% more damage, but HAWs give 2000% more damage.

Hi guys,
---
Just saw this post. First and foremost, apologies! I know it has been a while, but we will get a 1900 out here soon. As I saw in the comment section, someone already noted that there are longer form articles going up on the website looking at certain conflicts more in depth (thank you u/Soldier_Forrester). u/nornheim There are a couple factors, one of which being time for sure, I have personally had a hellish month, between real life, being sick, and my birthday. All the family shenanigans associated with that took up so much time. 
---
We also have spent a lot of time and energy working on other projects yet to be revealed, which we will let you in on really soon.  u/rolfski NER is certainly the most neutral in-game news service out there at present, and we will have more stuff to report on in the coming days/weeks. There is content on the horizon, so rest assured we will be there to write on it.  
---
To point out the other statement, the 1900s do take a monumental amount of time to create and think through. Like I do not think people wholly realize how many days it takes to organize all the information, remove fc and/or leadership bias, corroborate stories **and** get out the news in a timely fashion for you guys to read and enjoy.  It is a logistical nightmare, and trust me, I would love more help wherever and whenever I can get it. This does not even take into account the fact that personally I also play the game quite heavily and have in-game commitments as a FC and corp leader as well. 
---
And as much as people would like to insinuate it was "opinion based news reporting" that would be an untrue statement, and thankfully a bulk of people who read our content share that opinion. We see what happens around the cluster, we try to report on it as accurate as possible. We don't state that we are going to be 100% right, but we are going to be as right as can be by the time of publication. And if we get it wrong, we are not afraid to admit we are wrong and correct the story to right the mistake. Opinion based and/or bias news outlets would not give two shits, we care.
---
If I had infinite hours in the day and endless cooperation, sure we would ideally have everybody talking to us and ultimately we would write balanced stories on events. But we don't live in that world, and we have a time-frame where things have to get reported on or the story becomes old and therefore not as meaningful. 
---
One way you can make sure your side of a battle or conflict is not missed before or after a 1900 goes out? Be in our discord, talk about it in the #intel channel. Message a Director, we don't bite, and we want to hear your side! Messaging us about something regardless, can be a effective way of making sure things line up well, it is a tight feedback mechanism which ensures that the reports are as accurate as can be. I want to hear from line members and CEO's alike. I promise you that. Or better yet, join the staff and try to be part of the writing process. If we have more people working on things like these, they can go out more frequently and cover an even broader range of topics. But it is *not* a one man job. 
---
It is easy to armchair criticize, so I encourage you to take part in the process. We do this for the community on our free time, and I have enjoyed writing on the happenings for you guys. Again, I am sorry for the lack of one recently, just a lot of stuff juggling right now and I hope you can understand. Hope to see you guys in the server!

In a vacuum counting purely the isk ‘made’ per time spent yeah you might get that. However that requires many things, the first being finding vital and instrumental sites for the C320 gas(only one worth 120m an hour or whatever). Only spawns in high class space, and usually taken rather quickly. Then you have to find it, scan it, if you ninja it and don’t clear that’s only 20 minutes, and hope you’re not caught on your way out.

---
They could, but people would get upset about it, even more than they are upset about high plex-prices. Take WoW for example, they have gametime-tokens (equivalent to 500 plex), which can only be traded/sold through their market, but you can **not** resell them once you bought one off that market. You're also limited to buy 5 tokens per day at most. This eliminates speculation, but... *muh free market*.

It's just that people are willing to pay a lot more for plex than they used to.

---
fucking lol OK then 
---
PLEX is not high enough in my opinion. The only people that want it lower are the people that use isk to buy it. As the player who sells it on the market to get isk to fund ma’ PVP I’d like to get more than the 1.7-1.8 bil I get now.

'same planet' doesn't really count. Not with the way they break stuff up. if a fraction of them were to come together, it would keel over and die.
---
I don't disagree, it's in their best interest to retain players, I *want* them to retain players. Eve is a game that I deeply love.
---
I don't feel like they are following that best interest. My feeling is CCP is prioritizing revenue to appease PA and meet targets for their acquisition deal. (This is the additional tin foil I didn't want to wear)
---
A "free" player quitting, doesn't impact revenue, they weren't contributing (other than incentivizing the PLEX buyer to buy the PLEX and sell it for ISK. Which, let's face it, there will always be someone buying PLEX.)
---
It's the same reason skins are being released more and more frequently and being sold for PLEX.
---
Again, Tin foil Hat is being worn, conspiracy theories to be had.
---
Also, Hi Brisc :)
---
"You are worthless to CCP, you are not increasing revenue. "
---
This has probably been covered all over the place, but for long term stability, the game needs both casuals and hardcore players; both freeloaders and big spenders.  If CCP wants to grow revenue, it must keep both.  If all the casuals and freeloaders leave, then you only have a dwindling base of hardcore and big spenders.  They can provide a steady revenue base, but they won't grow the game (e.g. where do you get new hardcore players or big spenders from?).  This may be the option that CCP has taken, but given the PA acquisition, i'd imagine they are also interested in growing the player base.  
---
Shhhh don't let them know. ;)
---
let me know when it gets to 5m and i'll download the client to login and sell my stockpile.
---
Look up the patch notes for March release:

Hugh, who founded the site and wrote the 1900s originally, is currently a student doing student things at uni, from what I hear, he is doing really well for himself so I could not be happier. I have written/edited a lot of the recent ones, and I am just a working professional who travels around and about so boy is it a pain to get the time to write sometimes!
---
You're missing the point. Prices for plex are steadily going up. Eventually there's a point where the average amount of time a casual someone can krab or shoot rocks and make ISK is less than the cost to plex an account.   
---
The reason prices are up is, presumably, less supply than demand.  The turbo krabs will still be buying the plex since they krab 23/7, creating the demand. So some people will still buy the plex with real $$$, however it slowly goes up to the point that some people get culled, so to speak. But those people who were using plex for ingame time weren't spending money anyways, so why would CCP care?
---
Simulated... Yeah let me know how it goes with actual player yeah... 
---
"The game is dead because my playstle is not popular"
---
What does frt say?
---
It seems pretty blatant that frt broke the nip by helping anchor (whether on purpose or not) structures in their space
---
Yea, I feel ya. I used to want to have regular names and unfortunately i used randomized surnames. About a year ago I had my eve mid life crisis and all my new alts (including my new subcap PvP alt) had to be one word names. 
---
I haven't looked, how is volume doing with the current jump in prices? Is anyone paying that much for the plex?
---
The tools are **not** right there, and you know that's a complete copout.  It would take days to report all the names that a 3 minute search returned.  I see these people in space, too, we're not talking about something that is hard to find.
---
It would take a CCP staff a couple of hours to clean this up.  That you don't care to spare those couple of hours is the actual problem here.  It would take a player dozens of hours to file a support ticket for each of these.
---
What you're saying is that CCP would rather not address this because CCP is comfortable with these people making up part of the game community.  I wonder, are your partners as comfortable with it?
---
This is an unpopular opinion to be sure. But i agree.
---
How many ships did they need to do it?
---
Well, I just let my sub expire a couple hours ago. I simply couldn't find a reason to undock. The game looks great and the mechanics are okay. It's just boring. there are other issues too but boring is the worst.
---
r/mathpolice
---
can someone please come arrest this guy
---
That’s why you fight in plexes for frigate duels 
---
But, but, but....   we've already got our torches lit....  
---
How DARE you inject a counter-narrative here?!?
---
Exactly what I was thinking. More players = more shit to do = more likely to subscribe or buy plex because there's shit to do and people to do it with
---
Careful with that Ever word. You are asking for a black swan event.
---
"I am super smug, because my spodbrain, sandcastle playstyle remains intact for now."
---
I like the idea of being able to bugger of to other systems (looking at the stars, not all of them are systems).  
---
There are a lot of concerns though (how do you want to set up infrastructure if you don't have access to blueprints anymore for example).  
---
There is still a lot of unused space in EVE, we don't need to have more systems.
---
I agree, they seriously shot themselves in the foot holding it during the week. I understand they have their reasons, but I’m still disappointed in them. 
---
Woah. It's like wow economy and eve economy are two different things. 
---
I don't see why lower PLEX prices wouldn't be more profitable for CCP. The more folks are tempted to get Omega or run more alts or buy microtransactions, the better. Every PLEX bought with $$$ is still extra omega/MT money. High PLEX price means less folks run omega on their alts and mains and SKINs are bought less. Lower volume, lower gain.
---
Ehm, this is not how it works.
---
Are you saying you are stupid, or are you merely demonstrating to everyone that you are?
---
TEST ALLIANCE haven't won any fights recently. Once they do i'm sure there will be an 'update'.
---
If it drops in price it will get bought up quickly. I honestly don't see it ever going down, unless there's a sale or something similar, or someone dropping a load on the market from a stash.
---

---
You're misidentifying the goods.
---
People who buy PLEX to sell in game are typically those who also pay for their subscriptions, because why wouldn't you.
---
But PLEX to those customers is ISK, it's not a month of game time, and it is as an ISK transaction that PLEX is sold. It can therefore be sustained at a different price point. Account PLEXing is just one attribute that the PLEX tokens have.
---
Comparing the two is apples and oranges.
---
Thks for coming back to me mate, you guys are doing God's work. The fact that people are complaining about the lack of 1900 news only confirms how big of a need it really fulfills within the Eve community. 
---
Cheers!
---
Biased it is! 
---
CCP doesn't do anything because there isn't much they can do.
---
Another really cool thing about this system, in my opinion, is that it does all these smart things without introducing new currency into the game, avoiding it having an effect on inflation. 
---
"PLEX PRICEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeEEEEEESSS"
---
Yes you are
---
Katia Sae never died on their journey. I believe most of the first normal space systems were flown with a Tengu, and later wormhole systems with an Astero. 
---
It won’t matter how much isk they have if plex keeps getting bought up at this rate. There just won’t be enough on the market to go around 
---
Umm, you missed the most important one. Krabbing in rl with overtime pay?
---
Boson salvager? This would have to work on minmatar ships though
---
Yeah, there was an interview with the Wargaming CEO at some point where he said that like 90% of World of Tanks (on PC) players never spent a cent.
---
But you need them in the game and playing to have a healthy server population.  And then you make your money off the whales.
---
&gt;It would take days to report all the names that a 3 minute search returned.
---
&gt;It would take a CCP staff a couple of hours to clean this up.
---
....i dont see how that time works out.   it takes you days, but takes them hours.  
---
a tip for anyone who has never worked in IT, however long you think submitting tickets takes,  it takes far longer for the company as they have to notate fucking everything, not to mention reaching out to the client of each, and on and on.  
---
and again, if we ban everything someone considers offensive, half hte dictionary would be banned.
---
so heres an idea,  unplug your computer's ethernet. and avoid the internet till you grow some skin.  the internet doesnt give any shits about your feelings.
---
it enjoys watching your freak outs.  
---
The next test should be thousands of ships jumping through gates for an hour. 
---
Or an exodus from eve. Or if people go alpha with all their industry accounts. Black swan is by definition a unknown unknown. The situation could be exacerbated by unstable market policy though.
---
Falcon Punch of the millennium!
---
im not trying to discriminate or anything, im pretty sure there are asians that i wouldnt dream of getting their wage, im just saying that south america and asian per capita is much much lower
---
You kinda miss the mark here. The fact of the matter is that plex income is not static. The higher the price of plex the more likely people are to buy it for cash to sell for isk, which means that higher isk plex prices directly push an increase in real cash revenue from plex sales, which is why CCP actively benefits from inflated plex prices-
---
I'll post this to avoid some confusion:
---
CCP's job is to extract as much money from us as possible while retaining our interest and continued custom. When they do something you like, its to keep you interested/invested in the relationship, when they do something bad, its to push the income they can create.
---
Wonder how long before we get loot boxes :)
---
I don't want to assume that every player has that option.
---
So as someone who has almost complete subcap skills, what's the first recommended cap to train for? Specifically, assuming I'm not in a corp at the moment, what's the most in demand one?
---
Exodus from eve would likely result in current subscribers swapping to use plex instead. But sure, I suppose it's not an absolute, but I think it's highly likely to continue at current prices or increase further.
---
Except that most people curious to Eve in-game news aren't necessarily tight to blocks. They simply want to know what's going on in the game without all the Tapirium or Panfam cheerleading.
---
Good question. I think it was a Soon^(tm)  thing but im not sure.
---
So if I'm following, increased ISK for PLEX means *more* people paying $$$ for ISK? (Which means more $$$ for CCP) I agree, it definitely incentivizes players to buy PLEX.
---
I need more $$$ for more tinfoil. :)
---
with the suitonia sac or..? 
---
I support name changes with a list. 
---
Wait what? A permit? When did CCP add that? That’s a bullshit mechanic lol
---
Is this some kind of weird krab gatekeeping?
---
They sorta did loot boxes with the last event, maybe a practice run?
---
there are enough small skirmishes all around eve that fit perfectly into the 1900. but people have to actually report and/or respond to the writers... 
---
How do I delete someone else’s comment in real life 
---
oh no.. oh no
---
How much are you willing to pay?
---
oh thats how to do it! 
---
i always wondered how to remove that thing. its really annoying 
---
If accounts that drop omega because PLEX prices are too high don't matter then who will the folks who buy PLEX with $$$ actually buy the PLEX for?
---
Thats literally the nature of the tech. It does occlusion and limits your view distance so it doesn’t have to sync the entire world, just whats nearby
---
I'm often hearing about how there hasn't been a PLEX sale in forever. (Which I think a lot of players wait for, increase of supply, so ISK prices fall).
---
This is what I meant by intervention, they have no intention to do this.
---
May the Free Hand do what a thousand input broadcasts never could.
---
Didn't the economy lose total value last month? The bans removed a huge chunk of isk from the economy to the point that you could say it's in a recession.
---
And yesterday people said the higher plex gets the less $$$ People will spend on plex 
---
Hey!!! It's me at the 28-second mark. Thanks!! 
---
https://youtu.be/LmmWiIbnNIA?t=28
---
I bet CCP is selling more pkex than avg at the moment. It gets people like me that buy some Plex sparringly so I don't have to grind to buy more because of the great exchange.
---
Not really, we're just back to the regular 10-15% sales. 
---
The insane galaxy pack sales we had last year won't come back.
---
Also a sale won't fix the problem, the price will go up faster than CCP can have sales, as long as more and more people are willing to pay for plex, and we are willing to pay more and more, prices will go up. 
---
Named my main after someone I knew 15 years ago.  Don't like them anymore, don't want to be associated with them anymore and didn't think I'd be playing for 15 years.
---
So big fast honking motherfucking YES to name changes as long as there's a name change history tab and a limitation on how many times you can do it per year... Like once.
---
This doesn't need an industrialist. It needs someone who can write a database query.
---
Though you'd probably be more interested in the amount of pyrite used, vs the time to make it, vs the volume of other materials. Which makes it a more complex problem, as there are two variables you'd be playing with.

Null politics are the most interesting thing about EVE Online. If you're disdainful of those and just want to read about the latest nerfs try https://updates.eveonline.com/. Or perhaps the [Highsec Militia blog](http://highsecmilitia.blogspot.com/) is more your speed.
---
A days work buys 12 months subs on all my accounts.
---
Maybe all battleships could get a role bonus to get double hp from extenders plates, like supers get more hp from fitting capital extenders/plates.
---
&gt; You are worthless to CCP, you are not increasing revenue. This will either lead you to playing as an Alpha, or leaving. Doesn't matter, CCP is then cutting the fat.
---
CCP knows that having a functioning player base is important for the survival of the game. Players not paying real money are still contributing to the health of the game and the game's bottom line.
---
Well, Provi doesn't even have that.
---
I like the direction PLEX is going, great for wallet warrior-ing. It seems like it's going to choke ressources a bit and might drive something interesting.
---
As someone with a really fucking stupid character name, I would be willing to pay real money to change it.
---
It does not have to be cheep or you can limit it to a certain number per ACCOUNT to help curb abusing this feature to scam people 
---
Says duck tape boi XD
---
and how many of those players actually see eachother?
---
I'm not sure what about my post conveys smugness, but you do you.
---
Seconded, I really don't enjoy playing for my Plex so I'll just work my day job and spend free time actually playing the game that I enjoy.
---
You can have multiple accounts with 3 characters each.
---
You can simultaneously login 1 char per Omega account, so to have 3 online at the same time you have to spread them over 3 accounts, all omega.
---
The other character slots on those accounts have omega status too and can use their skills, but only 1 receives the skillpoint training unless you apply Multiple Character Training Certificates.
---
You can have as many Alfa characters as you want and you can use them all, just only one at a time, and also not with your Omegas.
---
have you not heard of our lord and saviour? capital artillery nags applying on a target with citadel paints and citadel webs  
---
obviously not, dum f1 monkey smh  
---
Dude with 100 SP farm alts is a useless waste of space.
---
Haha that's our corp member Graptharr :)
---
Look through the lore and see which one you like most. 
---
Race really doesnt matter apart from roleplay purposes.
---
Unless you choose anything other than Minmatar, then you are scum.
---
True, I've noticed cloaky hot-dropper alts have started to become few and far between. This will surely decrease demand in game, which is a good thing, since PLEX will become cheaper.
---
If you're not in a corp then you have no need of a cap. They're pretty much useless without a support network. That said, a carrier is the most flexible type of cap since it's good for both fighting and krabbing, and often the first choice for people in your situation.
---
So, tri finally died?
---
Welcome to the fun part of eve :) 
---
Alphas exist for freeloaders and casuals. Want to havr more under the hood buy a sub or plex...cant afford plex with isk...to fucking bad play as an alpha or pay the sub.
---
Indeed, make it annual or something
---
A better question is when can I vote you for CSM? 
---
Tri is still fine :) we just decided to leave null.
---
The best part of PLEX spiking and supply dropping is going to be the withdraw of a lot of SP farms and Rorq alts. Good healthy cull of useless scab accounts.
---
Yeah this is what mine looks like. The icons go into the empty column on the right: https://imgur.com/pyESm7H

WTS legit african N-word passes.

Agreed. My statement only applies to people who actually play the game.
---
What we need in regards of LP for pvp kills, is remove them from being affected by tiers. They are set too low cause they look at the worst case scenario, which is payout in tier 5, and that's rarely reached, even when 1 side roflstomps the other.
---
Once they aren't affected by tiers, you can increase the current  base payout ratio by like 3 times, which will make it 6 times more for tier 1 faction. That will add some incentive to go hunt the enemy, even if you're in tier 1.

You have to remember that they removed EHP from capitals in order to do this- you would have to do this to Battleships too which would crippled their solo/small gang viability 
---
Not doing this could lead to some scary scenarios where null blocks use ‘brick’ fleets to hold field forever to cause fights of attrition

Please say you're coming to C5 and not some awful C4 so you can capblob.

I think a one-a-year name change is the best compromise with an Alias list of all previous names. That way people with Xx420 BlazerxX created when they were 13 can be changed now that they're 14 and more mature to something more fitting.

Casual....
---
Im casual i pay a sub.
---
Stop using casual to define PLEXers.
---
Most PLEX is being consumed by hardcore folks running multiple farming accounts be it ratters miners or SP.
---
So please stop with the "think of the casuals"...
---
Casuals arent buying PLEX and we dont give a fuck if you lose monthly income because prices spike and cause ypu farming alts to generate less profit.

So logically it should be vice versa, subcap guns should be able to use t2 ammo and cap guns should not for sake of more injectors?
---
Daaaaaaaaaad
---
Or they didn't learn that 'A' is for primary target and want a nice 'M' name.
---
So plex is for those "freeloaders" to buy.  Without said "freeloders" who would buy the plex then? What point would there be to even have it?

meh csm is a joke

---
On one hand the CSM minutes don’t include any of the elaboration that would explain the reasoning behind these proposals. 
---
On the other hand some of the CSM members can be pretty dumb. 
---
There's two competing aspects to that.
---
There are the people who rising plex prices mean that they're willing to buy plex to sell for isk. Where, with lower prices, the isk/usd balance isn't right.
---
Then there are the people who have a target for ISK, which they buy plex to meet. Higher prices mean they buy fewer plex.
---
Which is the more important? Who knows.
---
You're absolutely agreeable if you talk about things you know, it's really like a breath of fresh air

Has CCP Rise tried to play Eve recently? Where the fuck does he see battleships?

Lot of casual players farm their sub in one super or one carrier in delve.
---
If the tag is correct i'd say either a dread or a fax :)
---
&gt;Let's say for example, I can't afford to PLEX and I refuse to use $$$ to sub. You are worthless to CCP, you are not increasing revenue. This will either lead you to playing as an Alpha, or leaving. Doesn't matter, CCP is then cutting the fat.
---
Those players provide content. When they leave, my subs lose value. The idea that I should want those players replaced by various farmers and bots is ridiculous.
---
Its interesting that you think EVE has "fat" in terms of player retention when there are many areas that are basically dead.
---
Thank you!

Not sure how that would help with farmers burning 100+ km away from the beacon.

A competition with CCP who can spawn more bots? Ho ho ho
---
Yeah man, the technology just doesn't exist in this universe. 
---
&gt;A "free" player quitting, doesn't impact revenue, they weren't contributing (other than incentivizing the PLEX buyer to buy the PLEX and sell it for ISK. Which, let's face it, there will always be someone buying PLEX.)
---
They were contributing. They were providing content.
---
High PLEX means that more people buy PLEX.  Think of PLEX just equaling a gift card.  If that gift card goes up in value, e.g. it can buy 2 ships now instead of 1, it offers more value for the buyer.  The cost to CCP is the same either way, a 1 month future subscription.  BUT, PLEX is better since that sub may or not not be redeemed and CCP makes more from a 1 month PLEX sub than a regular sub.  
---
Ask him about 3 titans. 
---
I mean.. I play EVE. Kind-of.. speaks for itself, no?
---
Wouldn't you say most PLEX buyers just sell for ISK?
---
When the game gets emptier, you can enjoy that pvp!
---
 #hodlgang
---
Keep in mind that from the CCP perspective, PvE use of battleships is just as valid as PvP use. That's one thing that new CSM members forget, don't know, or just convince themselves doesn't matter. But it does matter, a lot. If a battleship that is unpopular in PvP gets buffed, that can have big implications on its PvE use, making it over-powered.
---
Settle down Ganker.
---
As I said above, I'm not interested in your opinion. CODE chose to morph from a group of players combating AFK mining and botting (which I support) to a group responsible for griefing and/or extorting High Sec casual players (which I don't), so I find my entertainment in EVE in kicking over their sandcastle. Mind you own business, or are you somebody important?

It has actually been awhile, corp has gone idle and bust. I'm still in it for that low near 0 tax rate for now.
---
I guess I should have phrased my question to say "what will bring the most use to my next corp?"
---
Exactly this. Maybe the metrics show something different from what the playerbase wants from BS and that should be communicated to CCP.
---
Players buying PLEX from CCP are buying to sell for ISK, yes. Players buying PLEX from the in-game market are redeeming it for game time.  The value in PLEX is still in the conversion to game time, because that's where the PLEX is ultimately *going*.
---
You can also go down the rabbit hole.
---
Lower class wh (unknown space) typically have normal "k-space" connections. Higher class (dangerous and deadly) are interconnected with downward connections each. These connections are called statics. They change destinations daily but not the class of space they lead to. There's a pattern to this. Once you get familiar you'll learn to navigate.

You see all 400+ people with nigg in their name in space? You'd think some of them would be gone or alts or something. Oh wait, you went out of your way to find them and now that you've found them, you're upset you actually have to do something about it. 
---
You also missed all the ones with 'mick' in it, I hope no one accidently did that or they're banned. 
---
Oh and hey this is just English, what about every single language of every single player. Why doesn't CCP look up all ethnic, racial and sexist slurs ever and ban everyone huh? HUH? Is it because that's stupid and it's far easier to have users report people? No, it MUST be because CCP hates everyone, EVERYONE! 
---
If I had to take a wild guess no because of GDPR.
---
Ive heard this as well, at least in the past regarding metrics.
---
It does make sense, to an extent. But at the same time, as an example,  is raw HP increase really going to matter in PVE which are primarily active tanked? We already have passive tanked rattlers. We could just nerf shield regen on shield battleships to compensate if needed.
---
I guess the abddon 7.5% damage buff makes more sense in that regard. Since metrics probably showed pvp and pve usage was low.
---
Most people *using* PLEX are using it to redeem for game time. Most people *buying* PLEX are buying it for speculative purposes. The last time CCP gave data on this, an average PLEX was bought and sold four or five times before it was used.
---
So it's not *quite* as simple as person one buys PLEX, sells for ISK to person two who immediately redeems it for game time. And speculative bubbles like this one show that in action.
---

With a maxed out character, IIRC.  I think you have to have the T2 gun skill up to ... maybe level 3(?) in order for this to be true with all ammo.
---
I worked it out at one point, but it's been a few years.  I seem to remember if you only have the T2 gun skill to level 1, you're still better off with faction guns.
---
Not like I'm pvping some dude with 20 rorqs anyway
---
As him if I was a good or bad poster at the end of his reign- this should help narrow it down.
---
True, but at the same time LSE are woefully bad for battleships as far as gaining shield buffer since its a fairly small increase to their total pool. 1600s are similar but not as bad. Unlike capital mods, which were made specifically for capitals. Whereas LSE/1600s have overlap with cruisers and BCs.
---
About 38 minutes per account per month on average for yearly sub.
---
Then another 5 hours or so for buying PLEX to sell.
---
I dropped my isk grind about August and melted a couple null toons. It was a strangely liberating feeling not having my eve life expectancy being tied down to the price of PLEX. 
---
Instead of ratting hours each week waiting to turn into a killmail for blops I can just log in whenever I want, get isk from the krabs. go on fleets or just tank my kb even more feeding T1 ships to gatecamps.
---
No you've misunderstood.
---
We're not talking about the comparative nature of the good to a person who is consuming PLEX, because that has nil impact on a $ transaction and is therefore not a good or service transaction to begin with; it's all in game.
---
The only distinction that can exist is at the x/$ level, where x is what you are getting.
---
At that level, PLEX and Subscription are different goods, acquired for different purposes, and therefore have different markets (the x/$ consumer is the market).
---
Don't get drawn into considering the in game economy when considering the commodity transaction, they are distinct things.
---
I just pay for my accounts, fuck grinding.  
---
Has it already been 1.5 years since then? Damn time flies. 
---
Never heard someone nickname their dick ‘csm’ before
---
PLEX supplies are getting lower as people see less and less hope for the future of the game and nobody wants to keep investing IRL money. PLEX demands are getting higher for the same reason, meaning players that don't see a bright future for the game, stops paying subs with real money and instead decides to keep on playing with their saved ISK. This causes a chain-reaction leading to less players continue playing the game which in-turn causes what I explained above. And this goes on and on. You can't stop a downfall after it passes a certain threshold, only slow it.

---
Saying faction is better at 1 is pretty useless though, training to 3 would take you what 2 hours?
---
First, calm down. Try resetting the tutorial back to the last step. Read the directions again, carefully. If that fails use F12-&gt;Help Center and file a ticket under the "Stuck" category. A GM will respond within an hour or two.
---
I wasn't intending to be pretentious, just helpful and honest.
---
I actually studied an average mix of skills over the first year, and did the math for the various different attribute mappings.
---
The vast majority of all core skills are INT &gt; MEM.  This isn't far from drones, which are MEM &gt; PER.  Which leads us to ships and weapons being PER &gt; WIL.
---
T2 ships are WIL &gt; PER, though it is less likely to initially train them to level 5.  Some people remap to this later in their careers (years), just to do all the T2 ships to level 5.
---
On that note, it takes 17% of the time to train to level 4 as it does to train just level 5, so the cost of specialization is huge [CCP considers T2 ships as 'specialization', hence level 5 is required for the prerequisite skill].  It is particularly bad for large and capital weapons, but medium weapons should be bearable, and small ships and weapons to 5 is reasonably quick.
---
The largest category of ships in Eve is medium, so it makes sense focusing more on that.
---
Industry is largely INT &gt; MEM (research) and MEM &gt; INT (reprocessing and manufacturing), which also are handily supported by the INT &gt; (MEM = PER) mapping I suggested.
---
About the only things it is not great at are social, trade, and fleet boosting, however with +5 implants most of those should sill be over 2000 SP/hour, which I consider a reasonable minimum.
---
It is fine to train a few skills slowly.  However, one should avoid training a lot of skills slowly.
---
Hoping you can continue to Plex, brother!
---
Fly safe!
---
Your assumptions are flawed.  
---
The single best thing CCP could do if PLEX prices are naturally to high is a RL sale on plex with marketing push. Even at 20% off, CCP makes more of PLEX players than $$$ players. The demand schedule for PLEX from CCP is seems pretty clear from historical trends.  
---
The fact they haven't taken this action as PLEX has continually crept up tells me either a) they really don't care about maximizing monetization (which I'd be ok with, but don't actually believe) or b) they can see it's not actual demand for PLEX but it's just speculation/hoarding.   
---
Before tinfoil... the latter doesn't require them to analyze markets or look at player inventories, they only have to look at NEX store spending... if the cost of PLEX in isk is increasing but cash purchases of PLEX and redeeming of PLEX are stable, it's a bubble and part of the player driven economy.  
---
Everyone is a rational actor, CCP would be incredibly dumb to care about the in game economy yet somehow ignore the cost relationship between it's singular source of direct revenue from it.
---
Having your capital on another character is most advised. You will need cyno and all anyway.
---
I would be interesting to know a more detailed opinion of the CSM members who want to see nullification on interceptors gone. There is no further explanation in the minutes and neither to find on reddit or the forums.
---
Nullification is in a good place for the fleet ceptors and they are fine tools for tackling, certainly not overpowered though.
---
Perhaps its time for XL shield extenders like tgere are XL shield boosters?  Idk thats proably terrible.
---
Does $20 worth of PLEX still get a month of Omega? If so, this is actually worth more money than the one month fee of $14.99. Players that pay for subs using ISK drive the PLEX market, generating potentially more revenue than standard subscriptions. 
---
Good point, I guess I'd be worried mainly about ships that already get strong EHP numbers.

These all seem like edge cases that won't really revitalize the system. CCP needs to do some thinking about what the point of FW is. Why should someone want to do FW instead of participating in nullsec warfare? What are the benefits and drawbacks that should be associated with it? Work from goals to create a system that works and is fun.
---
It seems to me that FW should be mostly about quick, 'casual', small scale battles with CCP arranged social groups. This would serve those that are just sticking their toes into pvp, those bored of large scale fleets, and those that want quick fights so they can get back to their families or other real life concerns.
---
Walmart employee training?
---
&gt;Well, either you haven't been paying attention all these years or you pretend to have no clue, but one of the reasons that the zone has been abandoned is the introduction of citadels and the fact that they favor Caps
---
Caps have never had any impact on my ability to find good fights in FW plexes.  Even in the current environment there is plenty of small gang and solo plex fighting available.    
---
There are real issues with cap proliferation throughout the game, but what you're doing is whining and asking for CCP to delete caps from FW instead of thinking about the underlying problems.  A warzone wide cyno-jammer is just a bad idea that restricts content instead of expanding it, and CCP tends to disfavor those kinds of ideas.  
---
&gt;It would allow those small-ship size gangs to contest said resources despite Citadels now being the goals, which was the case when FW was blooming because Stations and Plexes were what was fought over, not big-ass Structures.
---
What resources are you even talking about? FW plex resources are already protected from Cap interference.  All other resources in FW lowsec space worth fighting over were fought over with caps before citadels as long as FW has existed.  I personally participated in pre-citadel subcap fleets contesting moons, staging posses, ihubs, POCOs, and every possible other strategic objective.  Getting dropped by the larger PL, Snuff, Shadow Cartel (rip) or whoever else cap / supercap umbrella was \*always\* a possibility. FW groups building up larger capital fleets of their own has only widened our potential engagement profile over the years.  
---
Unless you aren't posting on your FW main, it doesn't appear that you've ever participated in that kind of content. I'm not even sure you've got experience flying in cruiser fleets, much less needing to worry about capital ships.  Did you even play the game pre citadels?   
---
&gt;Introduce more ways to specialize with subcaps, commit Structures and Citadels to a side and disallow neutral ones (or at least penalize them), give ways for FW Corps to profit from the warzone in a heathy way (give bonuses to the losing side, reward the winning side), and you will have even the vets staying.
---
And there's no need to get rid of caps to accomplish any of these things either. All of these things (aside from disallowing neuts, FW should get bonuses instead of penalizing non-FW) should happen, and should be the main priority.  People have left FW because the content is stale and going elsewhere gives players more options for more content.  What you are proposing restricts content for FW players even further, which will only make the problem worse.  Just ask any player from a former FW corp or alliance that has left FW.  
---
Any changes to FW should be guided by the principle of providing MORE engaging content to FW players, not less.  
---

At that point youre just getting confusing though. The ammo size is tied to the size of the weapon, not the fictional caliber of gun. Its a gameplay thing. Imagine if we had to stock all sorts of different caliber rounds, and they differed between ship fittings.

Im still on the fence about dedicated tank mods for battleships. I dont want to EHP bloat them so much that we just end up having another class of capital ships, but also feel like when you fully brick tank them currently (and lose damage doing so), their EHP is underwhelming.
---
Id probably like to start by tinkering with their HP values in shield, armor and hull. Moving things around to enhance their primary tank. This helps keep base EHP roughly the same, but once you dedicate tank mods on, you get a much better dedicated tank.
---
For example: Taking 5% Hp out of hull and armor and then adding 10% Hp to shield on a Raven or Rokh. Or removing 10% shield on a domi and putting it in armor.

MANY players depend on plex not just for alts, but also their mains. Having plexed mains leave the game due to supply issues is a major problem for them. Not only for gameplay reasons, but also if these players leave permanently, then it ultimately harms the utility of PLEX itself... which in turn means fewer sales.
---
IN ANY CASE, I do suspect that the lack of PLEX sales by CCP recently is intentional, and they're trying to put pressure on the Rorq farms as a warning shot of what the future has in store...

Tiny changes can make a big difference. For years and years, Abaddons were the go-to ship for new players in L4 missions. You hardly had to tank them at all. Just load the mids with cap regen, slap on any old Large Armor Repairer, and you were good to go. At low skill, put in a cap regen module or two in the lows, trade them out for additional weapon buffs as your skills improve.
---
And then CCP changed their armor resistance bonus from 5% to 4%. Only 1% per level, nbd, right? Except it instantly pushed the Abaddon from "new player friendly" to "don't use without max skills" because the tiny change in armor resistance meant they were either much more vulnerable to being overwhelmed or you had to concentrate more of your lows to tank.

"You buying plex with isk doesn't make ccp money". Do you think plex was mined or magically created? Of course it does ccp money, someone had to buy the plex to sell to you, you pay with isk, many ppl do, what happens then ? Basic supply and demand, more people working to buy plex with isk, more ppl buying isk from ccp to sell to you. Sorry, but the moment I read that I knew that all your analysis is completely incorrect. I'm not an economist but this is basic.

Jeez wtf is happening
---
Ana annual change would be nice.  Injectors killed a lot of what it meant to be locked to your name.
---
PVE probably
---
You're reading it wrong.
---
I'm aware that PLEX is created by a player paying money with irl money.
---
What I'm saying is that all PLEX that is on the market has already been paid for, it doesn't matter what happens to it after that point. Someone could buy it all and click trash, CCP still has the money paid at the time of creation.
---
That mining in nullsec in a barge doesn't seem right to me. Mining ice with boosts, sure, but ice and ore without boosts? No way. Especially since Rorqual changes, which destroyed the market for solo and small miners.
---
Reason is quite obvious, they want to protect their space from guerilla warfare and travelers which can’t be smartbombed. It’s all and only about securing their nullsec income streams.
---
None of the changes proposed and endorsed by the CSM affect “umbrella space”.
---
But why? Wasnt he like the 2nd largest EVE streamer, getting like 300+ viewers?
---
You on about rl work?
---
But if there is noone that buys PLEX via ISK then who would they sell the PLEX to? Therefore nobody would buy more than needed for the own subscription and the revenue would sink.
---
Yeah, I just can't recall him flying something larger than a blops.
---
Casual AF. Did a total of 2 Hubs yesterday.
---
A nullified interceptor can't be killed by smartbomb battleships without having 2-3 of them, while also having a sub 2s warp from gates.; a nullified shuttle can at least have some chance of being caught. 
---
In short, nullified inties are too safe as shuttles.
---
Bro that wasn't just a smackdown...he went straight stone cold stunner, Hold my beer, Steve Austin on his ass.
---
http://puu.sh/D3iB2/1fd527e3b9.png fuck off?
---
Is it silly to anchor a Tatara as a solo player in deadend lowsec? I assume anywhere it goes, it will be blown to smithereens within hours without a corp to protect it, regardless of whatever defense systems it has equipped
---
I'm also going to argue that in in today's Eve economy, that 2-3b per 500 plex is NOT too high. You can spend a couple days farming and in turn by yourself one month subscription. We're still in a "just fine" price range for plex.
---
You got me there!
---
* 120-150 million per tick: Titan ratting without failing at boson
---
* 5 hours Buahahhaa
---
I'm a casual wormholerbtw. I rat once per week and respond to like 1-2 pings. Citadel farming is the best isk in the game and also the most risk averse cause of the way you cheese the drifter. I run 10 combat sites per sitting once per week that nets between 15-20bil per month on top of my skill farm alts that I keep spooling up everytime I see a plex post. 
---
Grinding a day job is a way more sound financial investment. 
---
&gt;And then CCP changed their armor resistance bonus from 5% to 4%. Only 1% per level, nbd, right?
---
I recall the Drake also being hit with the same nerf, and the reasoning behind it is that resistances stacked a bit stronger than raw buffer numbers, to the tune of almost 30% more raw damage taken as opposed to just getting 25% more health. Dropping it by 1% puts them both in line with each other, making just big buffer valid alongside with stacking resistances hard.
---
No, it doesn't work like that my dude. It's supply and demand. If you trash your plex , there's  no gain on it and no reason for you to buy more plex and keep the economy flowing. Plex DEPENDS on players buying it for isk. The more people buying plex the more ccp is selling it. I understand that you may think that the only thing that matters is ccp selling the plex, but people will only buy plex with $ if there's someone buying it with isk. It matters a lot for ccp people buying plex with isk, that's the solely reason why it was created. 
---
I’m pretty sure he had at least a super carrier.

---
 ferrogel duping definitely made the LP exploit look like chump change, it was a big exploit, but by no means was it the biggest
---
Well, a friend of mine doubled his rl iskies in a year via bitcoins by cashing it out at the correct time.
---
PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEX
---
Given that there are nerfs coming to income generation, it may not be as easy to get to those numbers. 
---
Aww that stinks. Zarvox was one of the few streamers I enjoyed watching. He actually flew a wide variety of ships. Usually eve streams are mining or boring frigate pvp. 
---
BIG MONEY. BIG PRIZES. I LOVE IT.
---
That is with max boosts. 40-60 an hour for Mack to Hulk seems about right.
---
I'll turn it back on then. I didn't realize RES required embedding to do that, but I guess it makes sense.
---
Moon mining in a retriever with support boosts on good moons can get between 100-200M/hr so it only took maybe 2 weekends mining 4-5 hrs a day on 2nd monitor to plex the account. 
---
Consistency is key
---
Try now.
---
you make 45~80$ an hour? are they hiring? 
---
WWB finished 3 years ago...
---
&gt; I did not include Abyssal running as it is a wide margin depending on tier and I'm not that sure on numbers. Likewise with income from exploration running.
---
T3 abyss ~100mil ISK/h
---
T4 abyss ~200mil ISK/h
---
T5 abyss ~300mil ISK/h
---
Have no clue what the numbers for T1&amp;T2 are
---
It is something I personally believe in as well. I get where you are coming from, as I must have said this dozens of times in discord channels and conversations. I hope to get back into the swing of things soon, so bear with me.
---
Damn you got cucked by the dev RIP
---
thank
---
Did you really just search for offensive names so you could be mad about something? It must be nice to have to go looking for stuff to be upset about.
---
I'm interested? 
---
If it helps the LP also buys more stuff, for example faction frigs cost 10k LP in the FW store instead of 80k in the regular LP store
---
Well, certainly is unique
---
Good riddance 
---
Then we agree, except on dreads.
---
I like subcap insurance where its at, and there seems to be no disagreement there.
---
Dreads need insurance and need high mineral inputs so that it is possible to deplete them and keeps dreads requiring significant input to manufacture, but yet allows the use of suicide dreads to kill either out of position or poorly defended supers. (Yes, rorqs have diminished this argument - but thats a problem with rorqs.) 
---
As far as nerfing carrier/fax/supertit insurance, go nuts.
---
And without the regret
---
50 hours on a video game a week seems a bit more than average... and I wouldn't call it being an over achiever.
---
It's funny, no-one ever talks about bitcoin nowadays. I wonder what happened to their "revolutionary technology"...
---
Good thinking! Nothing fucks up a good subcap pilot like training cap skills.
---
I genuinely don't think it has any aim at rorqual fleets. There are most likely more skill farm accounts than rorqual accounts andt hey never log in except to extract and thus provide no content or interaction.
---
Yeah you know, the Caldari Navy Issue... duhh
---
I Wonder how the increasing plex prices will change fleet warfare since many alliances out there require to have a cap and a fax alt.
---
That being said people will now have to make at least 4b as minimum to keep both toons active, along that isle to replace losses.
---
 I know alliances have srp but it won’t cover 100% of the loss cost.
---
So will it be that we will see smaller ships being used in normal fleet fights?
---
/sigh

There are too many facts and far too much logic in this tinfoil hat thread. GTFO of here, I need to hear about how hilmar is taking the DMT to see the elves. Where is my space-alex-jones content? Is this a subreddit or not?
---
It was applied to every ship with a resistance bonus. Note that resistance is a massive multiplier to the effectiveness of remote repair as well as local; having a giganic buffer may give you time for the logi to lock you but having no resists may mean their reppers won't inject enough HP to keep up.
---

---
It needs to be a long sale - like a week minimum, 20% off. 
---
Streaming Eve as a job in 2019 sounds like suicide material.
---
That's the worst spawn I've ever seen. And I bet the cache was empty, too. 
---
The fact that you unwilling to actually do anything about the thing that is so offensive to you suggests to me that you don't really care as much as your are letting on.  I mean even if you aren't able to report all 400 names you could still pick out the most  egregious examples and report them. But you're not.  To me, this post reeks of virtue signalling.
---
Personally, I prefer that these players keep their names, as it an early signal for me to know to avoid interacting with these people(unless it's via the medium of antimatter). The only time that I would report a name is if it encourages violence against a group or person.
---
There is a differentiation between player accounts and alt/mulitbox accounts. People will stop plexing their alt accounts, but will still continue to play the game with their main account(s). Personally I think multiboxing has ruined the game and the economy, not capital proliferation. The problem isn't 1 guy with a rorqual or super, the problem is 1 guy with 10+ rorquals/supers.  Increased plex pricing cuts down on multiboxing and I am all for that.
---
John Oliver did a great breakdown on the nonsense. It's truly despicable. But fools and their money... Starts at about 17 minutes or so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6iDZspbRMg

If you can see the tutorial "tree" structure just try clicking on one of the available nodes. I'm not 100% sure about your situation though.

Atleast I'm glad I was able to get on his fleets. The Tactical Assault Ceptor Doctrine Proved Very Potent! : P
---
Thanks For the Fun!
---
I wasn't passing judgement, just saying it's probably not average. I mean, in my Everquest days.. I would say that number was probably average for me.
---
this also right now gives you 8b/month advantage over those that do plex.
---
you can file petition to CCP  but u must motivate your change-name request. you must have very strong reason to change it. chances are  only depending on god will of  ccp
---
Absolutely. 
---
problem for me though is.......CALMIL ._.
---
not a good time to be calmil
---
Give nullification for t2 barges
---
Video games are about playing the game, but yeah.
---
I have 4 accounts that i pay for subs on with Freedom monetary units.
---
Will probably drop a hundo on plex tonight when i get home just to reap the rewards of the current market.
---
not-so-casual-Delve resident btw.
---
Not Lyris
---
Maybe add a "Renew" button on the mail.
---
yea lol
---
Well thanks for the correction. What was their motivation behind that change? 
---
&gt;  increased ISK for PLEX means more people paying $$$ for ISK
---
Yup. CCP just got $100 from me they didn't have previously.
---
Which i understand. EVE does have a bit of a butterfly effect to it. Give an Ibis an ECM bonus and suddenly youre winning AT matches with it.
---
Which is iteration is important, and probably wishful thinking on our part to hope CCP could be consistent with it.
---
Even in my example of an HP increase, it would help newbros and pvp players alike as it means a newbro has more time to align and escape before getting blapped by rats. 
---
I think the issue is, IF an imbalance is found, it takes CCP years to fix it. Which is why everyone is so hesitant to try new things.
---
It's been a couple years since I did it, but I used to run fw missions with 3 bomber alts at a time and I would get about &gt;1m LP in an afternoon of running missions.
---
 With connection skills and a t5 warzone you could get 100k LP per Mission and around 8 missions per character. Each mission would take 5-10 minutes in site and maybe 10 jumps from missions station to target. In reality I would do a loop of one warzone to pick up a bunch of missions then another loop of the other warzone to run the ~30 missions.
---
The method I used of running them with bombers may have been nerfed, but from what I understand they were just replaced with t3ds.
---
The point is it would take a very large cap / super cap brawl to significantly devalue FW LP given how easy it is to farm.
---
Gonna cry?
---
Most jobs that make 45-80 an hour require "experience".
---
Yep I'm in the same boat. I want to rename. I'm fine with limitations being set on it like you can only do it once every period of time. For example on Overwatch/battle.net you can change your name once a year I think
---
Dude it takes 1hr of real life work at a job to pay for a monthly subscription. It takes way more time in game to plex an account. Anyone who says they are quitting their mains because it's taking too long to plex the account doesn't understand math and that time=money.
---
This is a really good perspective.
---
I’ve guessed wrong so far
---
Shut up faggot
---
He said he did ‘stuff’
---
jita local begs to disagree
---
Battleships are used a lot in high sec wars. Bhaalgorn/vindicator/praxis/nestors are used a lot. But a lot of BS's are used. 
---
Test is using a dominix doctrine for high sec with nestors. 
---
Test (and goons?) Are using a Megatron/bhaalgorn doctrine
---
Test is using a nightmare doctrine. 
---
Battleships are ptimarily used in incursions. 
---
It's just that caldari and amarr are not represented a lot. Amarr are getting buffs this summer. 
---
Is it enough to make amarr BS's make a comeback? I don't know. We'll see. 
---
Played on and off (mostly on) for about 6 years now and people are amazed when I tell them I only have like 3-4bil liquid (maybe 10-15bil in shit scattered across eve) at any given moment.  I hate basically any form of making isk in EVE. I just buy plex and enjoy the game with the extra time I don't spend farming.
---
There could be many reasons, including real life issues, aspirations, the fact that streaming is probably not as lucrative as you'd think, loss of interest, just needed  a change of pace, etc.  Whatever it is, it sounds like he was ready for a change, and I wish him the best.
---
What country do you live in?
---
If you're selling it you're doing it wrong.
---
I do get that. And "Medium Hybrid Charge" is more abstract language than "Light Missile" which is very specific. I suspect if it was called a Dual Small Railgun instead, it would probably use a small charge. 
---
thanks
---
I completely agree with this. Range too. @deltaxi65
---
USA
---
what country are you in?
---
You spelled character wrong? Yes.
---
Don't want to be rude ... but who is Zarvox?
---
It's been going for 22 seasons? Fucking hell
---
&gt; if you somehow manage to fuck up your name so much that even TISHU won't take you
---
story time
---
Zarvox is still doing his weekend inty/tac fleets, just isn't streaming it. He isn't completely gone. He also isn't playing with his main because everyone knows his name, (and they ain't glad he came) and drops capitals on him. 
---
Of course CCP would implement this its another money grab opportunity "500 Plex Name Change"
---
Sorry, missed the alpha part. If you're wanting group pvp on a tight schedule without having to deal with moving the ships yourself I'd consider joining an alpha-friendly nullbloc. Solo pvp is going to be tough as an alpha.
---
and +6 warp core strength !
---
Alternatively they could just nerf fleet interceptor cargo to make them less ideal as cargo runners without them losing their tactical uses.
---
I run One account / all three toons / 55m a day pi income and it takes very little time 
---
Checkout [his twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/zarvoxtoral).  He is an Eve PVP player that did a lot of streams.  Was great at getting people interested and engaged in Eve combats.
---
Sorry! Old thread
---
That's not really regulation, that's just a... lack of fraud, more than anything else. When you buy securities, do you expect a random outcome in regards to which you end up getting?
---
The problem is in EVE reputation matters. Say you're trying to bamboozle someone but still FC. You could change your name weekly and effectively remove any strategies involving tackling down FCs. It also complicates things like "contracting people" etc. Say you were working with someone on a contract, but they change their name while you're away for a week. How do you find them again? Is the past-names searchable too? 
---
Those are just off the cusp examples, but to me it would ruin the whole idea of "reputation matters."
---
Was he a "mainfleet" FC?  Check if asking makes him grimace.
---
It's better to have people to go through the trouble as to not spam unnecessarily, you don't really feel that way if you can't spend a few minutes of your time after all. Surely don't care that much if you can't be bothered. Common sense. Just not worth development time or staff time.
---
They would have to play the game to see the names and thus be offended. It's awesome that you are offended for them though. Good for you...
---
I can see the first part. Not everyone would want to stick with a name they picked up under influence like "Gaylord Bonerfarts". I'd support it under the condition of name change records being kept somewhere on the info screen.
---
I'm sure op will be glad to hear that over
---
I put myself in the first aspect for sure. I just think that the people with an ISK target are very small portion of buyers. If you're prepared to get X-ISK for $ - you have minimal plex package options. It's not like WoT where you can buy your own amount of gold for cash. 
---
So, given the plex options I'd think people would err on the side of getting more ISK than they initially wanted. 
---
I play this game because of Zarvox's stream.
---
Unfortunately he became a victim of his own notoriety.
---
In the early days, his chill roams were great background noise while I worked late into the nights, punctuated by the great random fights that nullsec used to offer.
---
In recent times, he was forced to chain whelp to Tama/Geminate, I think partially out of pressure to sustain the stream, and partially because null just isn't what it used to be, and you could see with your own eyes it took a real toll on him.
---
I think CCP owes this guy a part time gig or something at least... I'm sure he's directly responsible for a lot of subscriptions.
---
It...it’s a game man. It’s whatever the devs make it. 
---
I confirm, I have downloaded \[MAD GAY SEX\] and saved it on my harddrive. I also took care of reposting it on my corp Discord. \[MAD GAY SEX\] shall not be forgotten.
---
in short, you can't.   characters have to carry their history with them, and so changing names isn't really a thing as otherwise alot of infamous old characters would have different names.
---
the only times it happens is when a character has a name that violates ToS.  and even then you need to seriously violate them.   a name being offensive to you, does not mean its actually offensive or harmful.  so don't be a SJW and complain that purple is somehow offensive. (no joke, idiots on tumblr have done that)
---
the last way, and your best bet, is a buyout.
---
buy CCP games.  yeah....gl with that unless bill gates is your dad.
---
Before that happens if you want to hook a brother up with 50b. I’ll your man
---
&gt;I spelt it wrong :(
---
 &gt;charictars
---
Spelling isn’t your best subject either, eh?
---
but, are they going to do it? 
---
Zealot is the odd man out of the HACs - Munnins are obviously flavor of the month, Ishtars have the drones, Cerbs (arguably) are okay, Eagles are for range and alpha, Sacrilege is a PvE ship now basically. 
---
Zealots are kind of just out there, with no real obvious role. The medium beam buff will help them, although they probably won't be back to sniper zealot levels. Zealot probably needs another mid slot, too. 
---
Legion is one of those ships that just drives me crazy, because I think it has really good potential, but it's extremely hard to fit, even if you're brick tanking it (the one I fly is basically just for links and brick tanked, but the Loki does that better) and it's way slower than the Loki. The Proteus is slow, but Legions are even slower. 
---
Honestly, the Loki is too good, but I don't want to see it nerfed. I'd rather see the other three T3Cs get some buffs to bring it up to Loki levels. Same with the Zealot. 
---
Pvp rooms :)
---
So instead you assume that every player has the option to spend 146 hours/month playing Eve?
---
At least make it consistent. 
---
RANDOLPH
---
He wasn't dropped on all the time because of his notoriety, he was dropped on all the time because that's the state of EVE in 2k19.
---
fine pilot name, beats fondelu
---
I used to work on a shrimp boat. RL crabbing isn't all they make it out to be on 'reality TV'
---
wts zarvox corpse 900m
---
While that is partially true, when a well known streamer rolls through there is much more of a reaction by the locals to kill them. They get a lot more attention wherever they go. 
---
Had loads of fun with him back when he was with me in Apoc. But yeah. Good choice to focus on something else. 
---
Of course, I don't feel proud of it. But I play this much because I don't have another hobby and I was not studying this year yet, since my university classes were not available. Next week I'll start the classes again and I'll reduce my gaming time a bit (from 5~7 a day to 2~3, which was always my standard).
---
Null sec subcap ratting never really added up to consistent 25m ticks. I've done vnis rattles gilas t3s I'd say even 17m -consistent- is more realistic. 
---
Add 3200mm plates and XL shield extenders: paying for the EHP in fitting is fair, but especially shield ships are so utility slot poor already, and they need 2 LSE always to make a meaningful EHP difference that they’re paying twice. It would also make a trade off of more buffer and downsized weapons more reasonable, as you could get meaningfully more EHP in shield or armour as a result of the fitting that frees up.
---
As a somewhat secondary point I don’t think BS EHP is differentiated enough from BC, and it’s much too low vs carriers. Stitch’s point about moving some of their EHP around to give them better buffer when fit for it is a good solution to address this.
---
I did not assume that either. It's a straight comparison of time required for the option used. You seem eager to pick a bone where there is not to pick.
---
I don't want combat ships that can get sub 2 align times and nullification. There should not be an uncatchable combat ship. T3Cs give up a lot to get nullification, but intys don't. They can be fitted to be just as effective at what they do and give up nothing. 
---
Before the screeching starts, I know that there are ways to catch intys - bosons, smartbombers on gates, etc - but those are highly specialized designed to specifically deal with just that, and that makes for boring game play. 
---
There's absolutely a place for a sub 2 align time, nullified travel ship and that's why I think shuttles should be buffed to provide that option. 
---
Most people Plex their accounts though, so I doubt much will change
---
I jumped from Machariel sniper ratting to carrier myself. I had been doing L4s and range tanking and then applied that to Null sec when I moved down. Then that turned into a carrier. Never did the VNI or Rattlesnake myself.
---
I honestly wish alphas got at least the prototype cloak
---
ISK &gt; Brains
---
Your opinions are unpopular. That microcosm of hatred you grew up doesn't reflect the world. You want to attack, want to hate, want to paint someone as evil. Why try to color CCP in this way? You need so desperately to make someone to be evil as if CCP condones bigotry. You're either stupid or hateful.
---
&gt;  I wonder, are your partners as comfortable with it?
---
The fact that you would reference partners as if Korean culture or others would share your idiotic sentiment is beyond reason. The world didn't grow up in a radically left cesspool of hatred. You'll find other people are less inclined to paint people in this way. Your generation will fade and with it the fake outrage and highground. Your sickness represents such a small part of the world population. We all share the same shard in EVE. Leave your illness and baggage where you come from. 
---
Maybe something to do with not having an adult job and living with his mom
---
&gt;  this right now gives you 8b/month advantage over those that do plex. 96b/year. substantial.
---
No, it simply means I "grind" out of game, rather than in. 
---
I don't have an advantage over you. In fact, you have one particular advantage. Guys who pay (either for plex or subs) by grinding out of game are making it possible for you to grind your subs. Without them, CCP goes tits-up and you win eve.
---
I read this and all i see is WHAAA WHAAAA i can't do anything to  the players that help each other!
---
Stop complaining.... Gather your friends and Create you own little umbrella so you and your friends can play with rorqs Too!
---
Tell the faction police in amarr and caldari highsec to stop shooting me so i can kill squids in highsec 
---
Allowing character name changes would be terrible for Eve the game and the community culture.
---
There is already a solution to dealing with character names and poor decision making: Skill Extractors and Skill Injectors.
---
Even if CCP charged an outrageously ridiculous amount for a task that would ultimately be scripted (lets say 25$) they would not make as much as selling the poor decision making crowd more game time (PLEX/SP) to invest in a new character (with a new name).
---
&gt; with very little consequence.
---
Very little means 100 bln cost? Thats still quite a lot. BTW, EVE is about blowing space ships. Even if you mine ore or farm missions - the shit simply needs to die to keep the wheel rolling. 
---
My comment was more tongue in cheek. Imagine loading 4 crystals into each quad light beam lasers instead of 1.
---
Regarding the FC thing, can't this already be done via alts, injectors, etc?
---
Regarding contracts, just make the old names reserved and any searches/links to those characters go to the new name.
---
Give XL torp launcher to bombers. Bonus to fitting cost and a shitload of bonus for the explosion velocity and explosion radius
---
I sorta regret being so specific but
---
My field is booming as are many others. Get a degree and get in anything STEM but understand you don't go from poor to six figures in a day or even a year (there are exceptions but this is the rule).
---
And just so you know, once you do make good money, you'll still be poor without a good financial plan. Income != wealth in the vast majority of cases. I could give you some guidelines but this is probably not the right forum for that.
---
:hitsvape:
---
That’s definitely too high for a P0-&gt;P4 setup, and probably too high for a P0-&gt;P3 setup, are you running factory planets with locally sourced P2 in NS?
---
&gt; Abaddons were the go-to ship for new players in L4 missions.
---
I think go-to ship is stretching it a bit, there was some back and forth on apoc vs abaddon, but most were saying get a raven/domi amarr sucks.  Also I'd guess by 2013 an abaddon pve video would have been straight up boring way better to show off your nightmare/mach. Oh and by 2013 I think people realized putting 7+ cap mods on a ship was just dumb
---
I make organic mortor things, all parts made in system (in wh) I make 48 of them a day  and have some parts left over as well

5 dampening leshaks vs my kiting zealot in an electrical.

Thats how I felt as well, years later im 30 days from Erebus :)

he would have been dropped on in 2012 too
---
Clearly his time in the CSM has warped his mind and sensibilities. Too much Hákarl probably. 
---
And dscan immunity!
---
fyi we invite people we've scammed for 300b in, so the chance you get a hold of something valuable is nil
---
Hows this stopping them dying? They will still need to be used regardless to achieve certain objectives or you lose the objective.  That's your choice.  But having risk free capital drops that you get quite a lot of isk back is wrong.
---
I mean how many people are doing suicide insurance  because they haven't lost their dread or haven't even used them in the insurance period.  Plenty of them.  Remember you want to build dreads you're supposed to mine the ores  and build them..
---
Building a dread is easy for big entities...
---
Fair enough, I’m impressed you have the P1 input for that on what I presume is at most 13-14 extraction planets (with 2-3 factories) - I imagine you have multiple of each of the planets good for the P0/1 you need in that hole?
---
I think its role is kind of flimsy due to a lof of the meta revolving around t2 minmatar. Jags, wolfs, Muninns, Sleipnirs etc are part of either defensive fleets, mainline fleets or wormhole fleets. So, it would be dumb to bring them against essentially their hard counter.
---
That being said, the zealot is quite fantastic in small gang when supported as it does BC levels of dps with excellent range and better tracking than artillery.
---
The one HAC that really needs a role is the vagabond. Partly due to medium acs being garbage and also because it wants to be a shield ship, but we only have 4 mids to play with.
---
The sac could also look at some tweaks to make it more competitive against muninns.
---
I think it would depend on the legion fits discussed, i suppose a brick tanked legion with AB would be slow. Whereas a nano beam legion or Nano missile legion are both quite fast in 100mn or 50mn configurations.
---
I do think the loki could use a nerf and the prot/tengu get decent buffs with minor tweaking on the legion. The loki is (and i dont like using this word) overpowered. Its not uncounterable, as ive killed a lot of them solo. But they just do waay too much. The missile loki should not be better than the missile tengu. Caldari are the missile race, not minmatar.
---
Either way, thanks for clarifying.

Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit. Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock, for the cyno is not yet lit. Break free of the station and witness the universe before you, For the cyno is not yet lit. Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait, For the cyno is not yet lit. Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them. The cyno is now lit.

Quality would be the bigger regulatory issue.  One of the biggest pitfalls of free market economics is its dependency on consumer knowledge to assure business accountability.   By guaranteeing equal quality for all goods purchased (something worked towards in real life with a TON of "burdensome" regulations), the market competition is restricted to price and location, outright preventing bad actors, whereas in a true free market, it would be inherent on consumers to identify quality and performance differences and price accordingly, which consumers often are terrible at, especially for goods requiring more technical knowledge to evaluate. 
---
We're crashing this plane
---
I'm not, because those 10 rorqs/supers in space are content waiting to happen. I've never really had a problem with multiboxing or multiple accounts.  The more characters in game the better. 
---
Or they want some easy isk now... 
---
I got some vni's on contract I want to sell you.
---
I got you, fam.
---
&gt;next couple of days

okay retard

Thank you for this hourly plex report

i'll always pay for the sub with dollars

I live in a place where the median wage is about 500 euros/month. At this point I actually want to play but it is becoming too tedious to grind isk and I can’t afford to sub the account so b-bye eve I guess

And cloak?

---
Yeah let's make all space hisec retard.
---
Cerbs get an insane kinetic dmg bonus, good range with HAMs and a web for help applying. They also have a naturally high kinetic resist due to being a caldari t2 ship. Exotic filaments give a penalty to kinetic resists, which means youre hitting close to full dps application with a cerb, so you can dps tank your way thru rooms. 
---
ha!
---
welcome to the wide world of supercap proliferation.

Also, KM?

Responding ok retard with no explanation? Really makes you look like the retard if we’re all being honest here...

Ah yes! I remember watching this now when it aired.

45$ would be 7x my current income, and i have plenty of money to spare at the end of each month   
---
and i dont live like a munk either, i suppose i have good financials    
---
(and yes i rent my own place, and have payments for things running, im an adult after all)    
---
now imagine what i could afford for 45+ a month (at my current hours that would be 7.2k a month) 
---
Names having a history lost its meaning when skill injectors were introduced, so not many reasons to not add name change in the game.
---
why am i the first guy to shit my pants while drinking cum from a horse while bombing excavators
---
because i'm the only retard who bothered
---
I'd like to agree and echo Mukk's point by pointing out in the past this is where combat triage filled the niche when it came to repping alpha. If the enemy solely focused on ranged alpha damage, the combat triage was there to make sure if they didn't alpha something, they couldn't kill anything. 
---
With the changes to combat triage, this has kind of stopped. There is no effective way to rep consistant alpha any more. 
---
I have said it before but I think the way to fix this so that small gangs can be effective again is either to fix combat triage so the cycle time and rep amount is the same, but the cap amount is doubled, increasing the apm and skill needed to fly triage in the first place. Mukk's suggestion of decreasing armor rep cycle time does the same thing. It increases the APM of each individual logi pilot so that if they overrep they're punished, once again bringing skill as a factor in these kinds of engagements. You can't just spam out 50 logi and win because the logi actually has to be coordinated and skilled enough to manage their cap. 
---
I'll say this again too. The way to make small gang combat and most small-mid sized engagements more balanced and fun again isn't by nerfing specific ships. It's by taking a holistic approach to the entire meta, and making skill once again an important aspect in piloting in a fleet setting. These days it all comes down to the numbers on paper and the numbers you have in fleet. No amount of skill can counteract 300k alpha.

&gt; now imagine what i could afford for 45+ 
---
That's exactly the trap people fall into when they get higher pay. I know a lot of guys making more than me who are poor as hell (in liquid terms).
---
If you made 7X your current pay, think first of how much more you could save and invest for even greater payoffs later (and be able to retire on time).
---
I'm assuming you're not in the U.S. If you were, you should be talking to the labor police for your under minimum rate of pay (if you're not working for tips)

"FC" can be used very liberally. If he isn't one of the following 
---
Laz
---
Vily
---
MrVee
---
DBRB 
---
Another "D" name I think who was up and coming at the time
---
Then he was probably doing grunt work FC'ing at the time. 
---
Okay, no, we're talking about trading markets here. You're coming at this from a consumer perspective which is entirely, one hundred percent irrelevant and is tying you up in knots.
---
Let the boy have his dreams, globby!
---
This sounds like a ruse cruise of a past FC trying to determine if they are still relevant or not. /tinfoilhat
---
ISK is currently rapidly devaluing. They'll need to do a lot more to fix it than that.

Honestly it was both. I dropped on him several times in TRI in insmother, specifically because "it's zarvox".

There are like 650k PLEX in Forge up from like 30k an hour and a half ago. So it’s gotten a lot better

---
Read what I said dipshit, I said to experience super and titan gameplay which a lot of alliances do require separate alts for them because they can’t just drop a keepstar everywhere they deploy
---
I don't disagree - I just felt it was a side of the coin some people didn't consider.
---
Watched his stream 2 or 3 times. One of those he talked about going to school (or possibly getting a mechanical engineering degree) but jobs just weren't there because the mining jobs had gone away or something similar. I hire a fair number of engineers and I can't see hiring one that had a large time period of work not related to their "field".
---
Well this one was short lived.
---

I'd rage login my bomber alts when he was in a nearby system
---
true,  well...except for monitary reasons.  heck according to Forge marketplace the monitary strength is strong.....to strong.
---
well if they offer a way, i'll be first in line.
---
Not sure, probably yes, but I just usually make a public contract and it gets delivered eventually, sometimes takes maybe a week if I lowball the price too much, but meh. Just always set the collateral to at least the value of your items. Maybe tiny bit less, so if they steal the package you've effectively sold the stuff saving you an extra step.

Missions and low-sec. 
---
He made an ironic statement about lack of free market due to speculation controls, you commented about the exposure to the failures of unregulated markets (not specifying the narrow definition of market), so i just pointed out that Eve STILL doesn't show all the problems with an unregulated free market, from a consumer standpoint. 
---
Even from a trading market standpoint, you do not have to depend on the potentially flawed rating of a third party, but have absolute guarantees as to what's being traded.  This nullifies a number of issues which have plagued the free market (looking at certain mortgage-backed securities here).

Over 2T in a single order. Probably not even the seller's entire holdings. Welcome to the selloff. 
---
You missed where someone pays for a few accounts but doesn’t want to spend real money on all their alts. At the end of the day if they quit due to the increased time they have to spend grinding CCP loses money.
---
Honestly imo $15 a month per account is very high when there is no reduction to the price for adding extra accounts, making PLEXing a few accounts a necessity unless you’re ok spending $500+ a year on Eve.
---
Though 577k of them are in a single order in Mahtista. (at about 4.7 million)

Plex sale when?

Somebody I know bought in at 500 (maxing out credit cards, defaulting, and had his parents pay him out when he got summoned to court for fraud), and cashed out at 18k. Lives in some self made hippy commune now.

Only further reinforces to me that bitcoin was a fraud, and those good at pulling them off banked on it.

I experienced my first ever pvp fleet under Zarvox, i stuck to pve since.

jk, good move on his part, hope he can find work soon and maybe continue streaming other games as a hobby, i believe he has the personality to make it big, just not while streaming a niche game like EvE.

Fuck you bear im keeping the DOG
---
Most of the zones in EVE are unfriendly to streaming, FW used to be somewhat of an exception because people didn't have fucking Caps there and you could find other pilots to pew in a matter of minutes, but now the zone is dead.
---
Tbh as long as they don't have some zone where the streamer can have a control on the kind of engagements they are willing to take (which is what FW did), they won't have people streaming that game.
---
Et tu, /u/Graptharr?
---
Some big fish are starting to dump while still trying to profit off the upward trend. Someone just stocked the Forge market with more than 500k PLEX in a single order.
---
I hit a T5 with 13 BS's today, there was nothing I could do to break remote reps of 3 bs's even with 900 dps.
---
Problem being that Eve has never had, and will never have the numbers.....
---
WOT RU in it's heyday had over 800k peak players, and even now they still routinely hit 450k+ daily. CCP sealed their fate when they went FTP, there simply aren't enough whales out there that still need stuff.
---
Why did you go with an ancil rep instead of a ds or abyss one? 
---
I literally cant see any argument against allowing them though. It'd be pretty trivial to include previous character names in a character's history, just as previous corps are. It could even be made easily searchable.
---
I don't think GDPR would cover that. I doubt the Alpha/Omega status of your EVE Online account is a protected piece of data.
---
this  is another  MH370 right? but instead of passengers are tons of plex in containers.. its like providence with 10000containers with each container holds 1 plex
---
If you know this is "yet another", why even bother? Want to join the "special kids" club or something?
---
And a jump drive
---
This is one area where you are just flat wrong.
---
I don't think there is an argument against them either i just think they are trivial matters. Id be expecting csm to try and make changes that actually impacted the game. You know what i mean? Why don't the get more body mods while they're at it. Or maybe some new boots to wear? 
---
"imagine what I could afford"
---
Stop right there. This is the mentality that destroys lottery winner. 
---
You apparently live in a cheap place to live, if ~7 hour is enough to give you "plenty of money" while also paying rent. So cheap in fact, that your income is more closer to 25$/hour out where I live in California (unless you're overstating your bills/ rent is heavily subsidized).

---
You don't believe in unicorns?
---
You misunderstand, you assume it is "that easy" to find or live in a place where you can easily go ask a neighbor if you can mow their lawn for 20 bucks, or shovel snow, or live in a family where you can perform some chore for a week for that money. More often than not thats probably just not true for people, no guarantee people live in an area where people would want to have their lawns mowed or that you can shovel reasonable amounts of snow, some cultures simply just dont even have that as a norm, that doesnt mean you cant go knock at 20 neighbors doors, but it does mean youre probably unlikely to have anyone accept you. Some people live in an area where you'd have to mow peoples lawns for 6+ hours a day to get 20 bucks. Some people live in homes where theyre already performing chores as respect towards their parents and they wouldnt be able to do anything extra to get paid more. Some parents simply wouldnt pay even if you offered to clean the house and do laundry fro a week. 
---
You misunderstand by assuming the world is the same exactly for everyone else as it is for you. I doubt more people than not have the kind of opportunities you or OP invisioned, that said I did say i see where he was coming from still. 
---
As if you need PLEX or ISK when you just take all our krabbing tax from the corp wallet.

because plex prices being high is bad for ccp, falcom memes distract people from the problems
---
Yeah, the cynos are a problem. Lets not fix them.
---
high price of plex equals fewer people willing to pay $$$ for eve online one way or another
---
the massive skyrocketing is indicative of people walking away from eve
---
Is he really wrong tho? Cc are annoying as hell if you are actually trying to test something. It's not about the 100 isk its the time you spend setting shit up, only to get dunked by people who aren't affected by the rules.

ITS NOT A BUBBLE BUY BUY BUY HODL HODL HODL 3BIL HERE WE COME
---
&gt; i just think they are trivial matters.
---
They're the kind of thing that's trivial until they're pretty important. EVE is an old game now, and anything that reduces the impetus for people to leave is important; people change and their characters should be able to reflect those changes. That's all I'm going to say about this.
---
not everyone wants to see ccp destroyed like you
---
Nope
---
Hello Koahi
---
I should have got an abysall SAAR however i figured that if i need that extra rep power im prob dead anyway.  In my mind the best form of defence was attack so I went with the officer launchers for improved ROF and very well rolled BCUS. 
---
Im sure people will disagree with my fit but hindsight is 20/20. It was a fun ship and i will definitely buy another. 
---
You can’t hodl when you FDs expire

Yes. Yes. Please forward me your resume.

That’s not how T1-T2-Faction are balanced. 
---
MJD WHEN?
---
Working for however long it takes you to make $15 to buy a sub will always be more time efficient.
---
Is it you Boris? Are you OPs supervisor 
---
you mean like the trader who just dumped a couple of trillion in plex in a single order?
---
~~Missions and~~ low-sec
---
Look at faction guns for example - dread guristas ger more range, while serpentis get more damage. 
---
Oh snap did something leak over from sisi on accident? Or are there live clues in regards to the triglav event?
---
You have to like how Eve's a game where a comment like this actually makes sense.
---
you do though
---
If people spam it unneccessarily, flag the players name after it has been reviewed the first time as within bounds and any further attempts to report that players name can be auto filtered to the trash. Doesnt seem like itd be that hard at all. I dont think its much to ask that if CCP is asking US police THEIR rules that they give us simplified tools to do so.
---
Amarr Battleships, namely Apocs are pretty solidly used as Megathron support as part of Baltec fleets run by every major bloc.
---
&gt; If you give me twice as much Isk I can pretty much buy twice as many capitals as before.
---
If you do that then CCP makes exactly the same amount of money. More likely is that you want to buy a capital, so you buy enough PLEX to turn into the ISK for it - and in that case, the higher the value of PLEX the less you need to buy.
---
&gt; The idea that PLEX being worth more as valued in game assets would mean less PLEX purchases is against everything I have observed in life. When a currency decreases in relative value, exports tend to increase
---
PLEX or ISK is not a real world currency and you can't really apply real world economics to it.
---
trust me, ive been in the shit before, i dont splurge, i rather have money on my savings account, slowly (very slowly at the %'s you get nowadays) accumulating and only taking what i need to live 
---
Yes, but this has nothing to do with consumer markets.
---
Rating, even accurate rating, isn't regulation, that's just information.
---
It's not possible, without fraud occurring, to not be aware of what you're buying on a market. This is true in both securities and commodities, and isn't the result of regulated markets.
---
Look, I'm as pro-regulation as anyone, but you need to stop pretending you know what you're talking about
---
Afraid not.
---
like i said, nice meme
---
Now who will predds bomb?
---
Ya, I might have participated if it wasn't during the workday :(
---
He finally get banned for how fucking toxic he was?   its been coming, I've had to report him multiable times in the past.
---
triggerrrrrrrrrrrrrrred
---
*insert beastial screech*
---
First off all, Eve never had that distinction like WoT had.
---
People either had the money to sub and maybe sell plex a bit on the side to skip the grind (like i did a lot) or where dedicated players active enough to farm the ingame ISK to not pay.
---
Either way there was a certain degree of dedication needed, which WoT lacked.
---
And Eve's F2P is more like a Demo, as so much stuff is locked behind Omega. I think this half hearted attempt is not going to work out in the end. I think it is only a matter of time anyway until Eve goes full F2P and focuses on other income means. They just would need to get their act together and finaly finish Incarna.
---
did you try shooting the reps
---
I hadn't thought much about dreads separately from other capitals, but what you say makes sense. I can get behind leaving insurance on dreads as long as HAW weapons get nerfed a bit at the same time (preferably nerfing their application so they need support) so they can't also shit on subcaps with impunity.
---
&gt; Where the fuck does he see battleships?
---
Probably high sec newbs running PVE or something. Or rolling battleships.
---
Yell at the TOXIC moderator that was online for that.
---
... Well there you go, you are in a VNI...
---
Use a HAC , T3, CS or BS and you'd be fine.
---
But why c4 tho? C2-NS/C5 Masterrace.

Had inspiration for this from [Lussy Lou's HFI video](https://youtu.be/vzeTIQB84mA). Wanted to draw a 720mm cannon, then a cutaway of a crew, and like most things I do spiralled out of control and now spans 2 post-its.

I'm perplexed.
---
lets be real, there's fuck all else out there worth switching to. especially if you're a multi year vet.
---
eve's one saving grace, for me, is the fact that no matter how shit it gets, nearly a decade of accumulated effort and assets in a shit game is still managing to eek out more fun than i'll get starting over in another equally shitty money grab made by a different bunch of money obsessed shareholders.

Shit guess Its back to stellaris

No offense, but this was discussed when it was first posted 3 weeks ago.

It's just what we decided on that'd best fit our content desires, enjoying it so far :)

Okay, that might actually be 'real' with all the bots XD
---
Fleet interceptors aren't really combat ships. It's important that you can make a taxi that can survive smartbombing, and nerfing away the combat interceptors was already a big step.
---
Maybe you should suggest a high slot module to enable nullification, to make it harder to fit guns, if you're worried about 'combat' effectiveness of interceptors.
---
You've definitely added on some additional logic, but there remains the core truth that the below statement is not accurate:
---
 " **this doesn't matter to CCP, you buying PLEX with ISK does not help them make $$$** " 
---
When those PLEX are being bought with $$$ specifically because they can be sold for ISK to other players...
---
If no-one was buying PLEX for ISK, there would be no point putting them into the market, they'd PLEX the $$$ purchasers accounts and that would be it...
---
He's not dead dumbass.
---
Did he say jump?!?
---
The "blue donut" and super cap syndromes usually prevents that content from really happening. Not only do they multibox multiple rorquals and supers but they also have fax alts on standby. And if they don't their standing fleet has fax alts. In many alliances to even fly a capital you are required to have a fax alt.
---
None taken.  I did a quick search for posts mentioning Zarvox in last month and didn't see it, so wanted to make sure people were aware.  I could have missed it.
---
Along with walking in stations CCP was supposed to implement laserdisc but George Lucas fucked us.

Wow, I guess I have been around this for long enough that I expected that Calando could actually rally others to encourage suicide and he could still be on the CSM.  
---
Also, I remember when you could say that in the in-game chat next to an adult link and no one would blink.  
---
You missed the fact that superior smartbombs also have less cap usage. 
---
Yes. Yeah does.
---
&gt; think first of how much more you could save and invest for even greater payoffs later
---
exactly my thoughts, what im saying w/ "what i could afford" is i could go and buy some real estate and get off paying rent, heck even reduce my power bills by something like 90% by running solar or some other gridless power-source , ending w/ near 0 running costs for housing    
---
spend more at first to end up w/ lower cost in the long term 
---
I'm not

Yeah, That was ICY, But it appears he's just profiting off it, Not driving it up. Looks like someone Else / A cabal is doing that.

I get it, it was way to easy to make him angry on stream so you know how eve players are, it’s like stream sniping except the streamer comes to you and you get to drop titans on him.
---
But I will remember the whiptail. And also the time he took a shitload of interceptors directly from highsec through a frig hole into Horde’s krab cage in Fade.
---
They are both faction and gain different advantages. They also have more damage and more range than T1.
---
Like faction smartbombs actually, which have different ranges and different damage type as tradeoff. If you want to do something other than EM damage, you'll have to give up range.
---
Your example doesn't support your claim.
---
The mystery continues!
---
For all of you thinking this room is a bug, take a look at the structure the ships all start near - it’s a very intentional room~
---
&gt;CCP cares not only about revenue, but also about stable player counts and ensuring retention of existing players.
---
The thing is, the mass multiboxers are too botlike in behavior and general playstyle in order to count as contributing. Not just that, but they actually greatly contribute to actually playing players leaving the game not staying. A lot of players leave the game once they find out all this bullshit and it really hits them.
---
So unlike it is in other F2P games such as GW2, or WoT or Warframe or POE etc. these accounts do not contribute to the game universe "feeling more alive". In fact quite the opposite. Not only do people quit directly because of them but they are the cause of all the other bullshit in the game such as cap proliferation and extinction of small and medium size player groups. They drive content away not provide it. Incidentally, that very content was / is also a good chunk of plex supply necessary for these multi accounts to survive, thus they keep shooting themselves in the foot and digging their own grave by sheer existance.
---
Then you have a whole otehr group, unlike the Rorq or ratting alts, you have SP / PI farmers or SP / market alts who hardly ever even undock, thus contributing nearly absolute zero to game "feeling alive". You simply won't come across them in the game because they are not in space for you to do so.
---
Last but not least, bots .... Yea. This shit combined with all the other lame mechanics in the game such as too easy ratting, too easy mining etc. is a fucking breeding ground for bots, input broadcasters etc. While people are often focused on the big and RMT bots, there are a crapton of the small bots that only bot enough each month just to pay their space rent, or just to support 1-2 main accounts for their own, not for sale or anything. These do not sit in space 23.5/7 like the professional botters do. Only get enough to do what they need and log out.
---
So to all of those, good fucking riddance. And if they at least substantially thin out, then maybe the people who are leaving because of them won't, and the playerbase will become better overall.
---
Shut the fuck up you retarded nagger.
---
&gt; Doesnt seem like itd be that hard at all.
---
Volunteer your time, unpaid work to do it and than present the code to CCP when you're done. It's that easy.
---
Asking for tools and human resources from the stripped out skeleton crew in 2019 is a ridiculous prospect. Write a ticket. This is the least of the games development concerns. A path already exists - it simply is not that important that you have access to the redphone to dial in your emergency case of being offended.
---
Just to put it into a little perspective. It might be one hour of average paying job in the west, but in central Europe and the rest of 'east' it's nearly 5 hours of an average paid job to pay the €15 subscription.

Not sure about either. I thought at first it's a bug because the usual abyssal decorative visuals aren't there and there is only a station in the site with a huge spawn. But now I'm not sure anymore.

This is a terrible idea. 720mms are balanced. They have terrible tracking and the shortest range of all other long-range medium weapons. The high alpha and  selectable  damage type is the only reason why they're used. They're also pretty tough on fitting.
---
21 munnins should be able to alpha a basilisk. Having a stalemate because both sides have a few logis would be extremely boring and unbalanced. Ships should more likely die in a fight than to not die.
---
You say people bring paints and webs to apply. Well maybe the other side should bring damps and tracking disruption so that they can't apply.
---
You can do it by limiting injectors much more severely, so it isn't just 'ISK per SP'. For example they could taper down to 0 (i.e. you can't use them at all) at 50m SP.

There's multiboxing two or three accounts, and then there's rorqual farms. Only one of those things has been common for a long time.

Central Europe pays 3 euro an hour? GTFO. Utter bollocks.

I think that for this system to work the ratio of paying to non-paying customers has to be the opposite of what EVE seems to have right now.

This just feels like someone has finally stopped meddling with the plex market (either CCP or some other superlarge financial entity) and this is finally an accurate reflection of the current state.  
---
I'm trying to put out a simple model, please someone correct me so that I can explain this successfully to a 5 yo.   
---
There's two players in the game - both pay initially 100 isk to play for 1 hour.  
---
* During that hour p1 makes 50 isk and p2 loses 50 isk 
---
* p2 decides to pay 1$ for another 1h of play and pay another 1$ for a 1hour plex which he puts on market 
---
* p1 will buy a 1 hour plex for less than 50 isk to make a profit 
---
Now add a third player, p3 
---
* p3 plays like p1 so he also has 50 isk to spend, but there is only one plex on sale - price can't raise past 50 isk since that's the maximum that can be made so the offer is hard capped 
---
* p3 plays like p2 and has 2$ to spend - now there's 2 plexes on the market but only immediate demand for 1. Since both sellers want their return now the price immediately drops to 25isk so that the only purchaser can get them both. 
---
If this becomes more and more imbalanced towards plex supply - more of the p2 kind of players - the plex price crashes, naturally, tending towards 0.   
---
If it imbalances towards the p1 kind of players - that provide isk - the plex price caps at a maximum they can afford to offer - in turn this causes isk to devalue which will raise isk prices for everything except plex.   
---
Am I right ?   
---
To be honest I stopped playing cold turkey about two months ago.  Nothing wrong with the game just been super busy.  You're right that the economy is most likely in a recession then.  Makes me think of rich people buying gold while the economy tanks.
---
YELLING
---
Technically, but not as easily as changing your name. It’d be most likely much less expensive
---
Also, do you really think that kind of historical bloat would be good long term? The character search in game already is kinda awful
---
At least we're kings of this dump.
---
someone just dumped 577k plex in the forge. This morning the total number of plex available was around 160k. 
---
All this according to https://evemarketer.com/types/44992
---
Dont forget the price on these... A smartbombing mach with faction bombs  costs you like 2b compared to a 200 m rokh for a meager dmg and range increase. 
---
&gt;every 10 unsubed rorq account  = 1 unsubed PVP player.

Opposite. Tons of small group players have either switched to other areas of the game or quit exactly and precisely because of this bullshit.

---
Didn't need speed dial reporting when the population was at all time peaks, hasn't needed such a feature. If you have a problem, write a ticket. There isn't any spare staff to man the position of the offended hotline. There simply aren't enough instances to warrant this, its not an epidemic and is a waste of development time and man hours. 
---
&gt; Its in their best interests monetarily

The easiest method in OBS is to add an extra source that's just a black box covering whatever you want covered. Add some logo or a ship graphic to make it look fancier.
---
You could get fancier and [blur the text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PODw_nHUbQ), but honestly I think that looks dumb (despite everybody else's opinion on the matter). What's the point of showing people there's text but they can't read it? Just cover it up completely.
---
Finally you can go the no "opsec" route (cause seriously what are you really doing that's opsec) which has the added benefit of drawing people to your stream so that they can try to stream snipe you and also makes your stream actually interesting to watch since no one wants to watch someone run missions or mine or rat or run explorations sites if there's no risk in actual content happening.
---
Its fine to cover up corp/fleet/private chats, but trying to hide your overview and what system you're in is pointless and futile.  Knowing the star color and the number of gates in a system plus the general region is enough to narrow down the number of systems to search if someone really wants to snipe you.

Just fly what you can afford to lose until people start throwing isk at you since you're out flying dangerously.

Been the 2nd largest Eve streamer is like been the 2nd place in the special Olympics, ya it's great don't get me wrong but it get no where near the the viewers of the real Olympics. So he got a 1k donation like once, where as a real job pays reliabley  to be a full time streamer requires a pretty hefty supply of continued subscriptions. You can't live of the chance of large donations. 
---

---
A new thread every time plex ticks up slightly is cluttering the sub so they are going to be merged into this one. 
---
Noone specified non-consumer markets until your last response.  Given that lack of specification, it was relevant.  If you intended to only discuss securities and commodities,  fine,  but you failed to convey that.  Feel free to reread the chain.  Consumer markets are frequently cited in free market discussions.  
---
With regards to ratings, you'd agree that inaccurate ratings contributed to the financial debacle a decade ago, right?   This was an example of lack of regulation and oversight to prevent cases of fraud from snowballing into a much larger issue.  Its also not possible in eve's market system.  So even that example,  not my original intent, still holds; As much as Eve demonstrates the dangers of an unregulated market,  it ironically still doesn't show all of them.  There are a number of real risks in an under-regulated free market that do not apply in Eve.
---
I think you misunderstood what I was trying to convey.  Jumping to accusations of incompetence before trying to get clarification is a bit much.

but 79 super hulls finished building and 98 new citatels were anchored this week! you need to reported these important krabbing achievements!

Also the plate vs Hull argument is kinda meh, you can plate fit with dmg mods and get around the same ehp now, back before the changes I was a major advocate for the hull moros because it was better tank even with 2 mags then armor moros and people didn't expect it. In capital fights.

---
&gt;I don't want combat ships that can get sub 2 align times and nullification. There should not be an uncatchable combat ship. T3Cs give up a lot to get nullification, but intys don't. They can be fitted to be just as effective at what they do and give up nothing.
---
What makes for boring gameplay is completely closed off regions without any solid way of getting through. The game needs more nullified ships, not less. Lack of various effective doctrines against this is exactly and precisely what contributed to the current situation of oversaturation of Rorqs, multi account ratters, bots etc. You need to be able to go in with many different ship styles and hit those targets and not get auto blapped, otherwise we end up even worse then it already is, and lets face it, things are pretty bad now. Too many actually playing people have quit or moved onto different areas of the game because of this shit and on top of that, all this multiboxing, botting and shit is now landing itself in a bad spot due to plex prices. Its all tied together and lack of widely available nullification is a factor in it.

Every example you've given at best delays issues.   As long as injectors require extraction of SP earned at the cost of time, and as long as PLEX is used to measure the cost of that time,  injectors will ultimately be linked to plex. PLEX is the basis for determining the profitability of skill injectors. 
---
I'm can only assume this is bait.
---
Simply unreasonable as stated. Whether you agree has no effect on reality, no more than your $15 will allow you access or agency, no more than that circle would dictate your wife as your property.
---
The resources no matter how 'small' you would think are simply not available and are unlikely to be made available so enjoy the privilege of using the ticket system when someone has an alias that offends you. With your time and help in this regard even you will know no such system is necessary as the backlog of offensive names will be dealt with.
---
That is of course, if you care - which you don't really or you'd be writing the tickets. It's convenience you desire to exploit, you'd like that function at your fingertips. It's unnecessary to broaden the amount of reports simply to appease this falsified need. Sure it would be useful to have several functions of reporting added to the experience - that's not where we differ. Instead, it's the scarcity of resources involved in such an endeavor. There simply is nobody free to review the extra reports which people willy-nilly make due to ease of access. 
---
Convenient sure, but a good use of development time, concern or manhours this is not. A path exists for those who truly are offended and it works well.
---
There are ways of getting through that don't require nullification. Delve doesn't exist because there are no nullified ships.

I'm with most people in that I don't really have respect for the SiSi players as players, because of their own behavior on SiSi.
---
But this is a response entirely uncalled for. That kind of language against anyone doesn't belong in this game.
---
I hope he gets the hammer.
---
I think those are annoying and dont watch streams with those transparencies, it's too distracting and doesn't help you view anything "better" than just using a simple picture to cover up your overview.
---
If you're streaming pvp it may be helpful to cover it, but it may also help you get fights if you let it alone. Maybe just cover your corp/alliance/fleet chat. Consider setting a longer delay as well, but it can be hard to chat with a heavy delay. Good luck!
---
Agree to disagree. PLEX being the way it is now is a direct result of the market. There's too much demand (due to botters, virtually guaranteed), so price spikes. It'll take care of itself. CCP should not intervene because hopefully, this is an organic way to destroy the botting economy forever.
---
Never heard of you. Probably never will.
---
It's not overspeculated though. Because nobody is going to buy a bunch of plex and get ruined if there is a price correction. They will simply hold on to it. It's like housing, almost always goes up, except unlike housing, plex doesn't actually matter. When it crashes like housing crashed, this is a video game and not real life so you don't have to panic sell to prevent becoming homeless. You can just wait, because it is, you know, a video game. People know this and that is why plex is such a strong investment. It almost always goes up, it has an important use as sub time and is not simply a trade commodity like a tulip. And when it does go down it is a short term dip because people don't have to panic sell and cause huge slopes because it's a game and plex speculators are already quite liquid and diversified compared to real life investors.
---
To be honest I don't think plex has any practical or theoretical ceiling price unless the amount of Isk in the game was actually radically decreased, and I don't mean nerfing Isk faucets, I mean resetting a lot of wallets and deleting assets.

Yes. And all of them are too specialized and inaccesable for wide range of players. You need a widely available way, not just WHs or having a parked cyno alt or blue to cyno you in. Players need to be able to just simply form up and go, and not just that, this needs to include people flying regular ships in regular fleets not just dedicated ones. That's the problem. If there were enough ways to get through we would not be in the current situation, or at least no where near as bad.

sounds like a generic clickbait site with a lot of popups and ads
---
I'm not gonna open that
---
Cos tanks is a confusing game and ships is straight up better.
---
Hmm ok thanks
---
people that think like you allow people like DJT to take power.
---
Characters in game are still characters in game and if they're in space they're targets. 
---
nah nah nah, quitting on your own is winning eve, getting banned is losing
---
This is the point - there should be a taxi ship.  It should not be a combat ship. It should be ship designed specifically to get you, and a small amount of stuff somewhere fast. Not for tackle, not for combat. 
---
like the guy in the wizard hat? +100% to ban reduction
---
I'd say the majority of Eve players treat it like a consumer market.  Theres far more consumers than market traders, even restricting the discussion to PLEX.  
---
 &gt;Trading markets are the only markets relevant when discussing EVE. 
---
This sounds pretentious as hell. 
---
About time
---
shouldn't mittens also be retroactively permabanned?
---
Seriously, this post is pants-on-head stupid. The core claim is that as soon as you decide to stop paying, CCP doesn't give a shit about you any more. I think CCP would probably prefer that you keep paying in the first place. 
---
Actually they don't. 
---
instead of outing him, and possibly accidentally doxing him, why don't you just ask him nicely.
---
I'm sure at least part of it is because he whines like a little bitch every time he's dropped, and the average EVE player loves tears.
---
Just a tech demo. And a chance to gather some real world data.
---
Not a game demo.
---
I don't like grinding, it's not fun. I just pay for my sub, because I can have a lot more fun in EVE with 2bil isk, than I can with $15 or whatever the sub is.
---
Thats only because the bot farms will disappear as it becomes to much cost for value....then CCP will finally see that no one actually plays their shit game anymore.
---
People can do that. And they also will get caught by folks who don't want them coming into their space and fighting back. Defenders are always going to have an advantage, because they're fighting in their own territory. 
---
thats a lot of fucking plex lol
---
Cool story.
---
Botting didn't cause the price spike. 
---
Definitely not a bug. Expect more soon. ;)
---
I want some too
---
I don't see a problem with it, as long as they put a list of pervious names right in the character info.
---
What corp?
---
You tell em
---
GARMUR
---
He definitely inspired me when I was starting Eve
---
Myrm is a billion times sexier. That's about it.
---
unless he gets ganked 😈
---
If you're trying to discuss what EVE does or does not illustrate about real world economics, markets, finance, and so forth, you can't ignore the reality of how the game operates and what it actually models and apes. It's fundamentally not a consumer market, even if the goods traded are consumer goods.
---
And sure, it sounds pretentious, but only because I wanted to make sure I was blunt enough that you wouldn't miss the point. Clearly, though, once again I fell short of that lofty goal.
---
I got you bud :)
---
This is the world we live in.
---
I think the reason many of the CSM feel that the Legion/Zealot feel shitty is simply because the meta has shifted away from armor (at least when it comes to cruiser/BC hulls).  Once upon a time when the Zealot and Legion were kings in PvP, people prioritized EHP &gt; Damage &gt; Range.  
---
Over the years the scale and makeup of fleets began to change, and the priorities changed with it.  Your range/engagement envelope was valued much higher, with damage falling to the last requirement.  Who cares if I do 80% the DPS of your ship if I can a) always be shooting (and always applying DPS) and b) bring more people to overcome that lost damage gap.  Overall DPS drops, alpha increases, armor ships without a large buffer become shittier and shittier.  Combine that with nerfs to the Proteus and Legion, and armor just look less attractive by the minute.  
---
HACs get buffed with the ADC giving them WAY more EHP, but the buffer still feels too low and everyones just flying ships that can outrange you and out-apply you.  
---
For the average bloc nullsec pilot, AKA the bulk of the CSM,  these ships are in the dumpster compared to where they once were.  They're still viable in small-medium scale, but when you have a memory of them being prohibitively dominant, comparing that to the current meta and they seem trash tier.  
---
But that's just my guess as to why they feel that way.
---
Finally some quality fucking content.
---
&gt;biggest damage
---
its pronounced bigglyest damage
---
... If you bought a plex for ISK someone paid $$$ (and at a premium btw, it's more expensive than the monthly sub).  Your isk is not going to CCP, your whole argument is dumb and invalid.
---
Always glad to see [post-it posts](https://media.giphy.com/media/pSwXgZCxNknKM/source.gif)
---
this shit to good.
---
You managed to get both of those statements wrong. 
---
First a high plex price makes your plex even more valuable, if you buy plex with real money and sell it for is your happy right now.
---
Second is demand, skyrocketing plex price means demand is outpacing supply. When the game dies those that had large holdings of plex will sell and because of lower demand the price is likely to fall very hard. 
---
We've already concluded that bit
---
Wts Titan still...
---
I’d be for less timers, time zone tank and removal of dps cap. As for injectors my thoughts is they should only be good up t2 medium guns/bc of any race to 5/core fitting skills. With exception on t2 ships being omega slow train only and beyond.
---
Cool. You sound like an asshole.
---
u know what, let's nerf everything and we can just throw rocks to each other.
---
Marketing at its best.
---
ANOTHER RMTer DOWN
---
That's not the argument, its that the $$$ has already been paid, so doesn't matter how much ISK you pay to whom, CCP already has the $$$. So sperging about the ISK value of PLEX doesn't make a difference to CCP.
---
Zarvox was a machine.  I can tell you from experience even if he was making an okay living, the amount of streaming he was doing is not commensurate with that amount of money.  It's so much harder work than most viewers realize.  And you also have to keep in mind that a twitch streamer is a self employed contractor.  Which means no benefits, pre tax, etc.  I am really happy for the fun times had, but ja boy gotta do what's best for him.  I know I'm glad I did.  I miss and love a lot of you, but life is a lot longer than we give it credit for, and you gotta take a long view.
---
Here is a baby upvote plant
---
Heaven forbid that there should be a playstyle other than smartbomb gatecamps and Titan blobbing!
---
Thanks as always for your tireless advocacy of "my way or the highway."
---
Less alts to be sub. Or bite the bullet and use real money. I personally find it less stressful to not bother with the plex market.
---
Really dpends if he was a skirmish FC or a strat FC frankly. There were like 10-15 active skirmish FCs in the Fountain war but only 4-5 Strat FCs. The only skirmish FCs people are going to remember are the ones that developed into Strat FCs somewhere. The only Strat FC I havent seen mentioned is Reagalan. Otherwise just about every other major FC for that time period is mentioned. I guess you could say Kcolor but he predominately led the bomber fleets around that time. 
---
Lower then HS miners or is that a bit too much?
---
&gt; kind of bad way to represent the sub
---
That's true. It doesn't properly illustrate the amount of garbage posts in this sub.
---
XX
---
yep. and honestly it was pretty successful at that. they got the data they needed and we got to have some fun.
---
Ditto.
---
Dude, Thank you. Legit. I love Abyssals but been struggling past lvl 4's &lt;3 Made my day
---
The purpose of fw is faction vs faction. I'm simply removing the third pirate element which one side blues up with and taking capitals out of the equation, to focus more on subcapital ships. It has no affect on any one who is not in faction warfare. Just as it currently has no affect on anyone outside of fw even if they are in an npc corp.
---
The real don't come to khanid/derelik comes from fear that hungry for pvp players might wardec locals. 
---
Nestor is a billion times sexier than any battleship.....but sadly, like Myrm.  it has the question of "why bother using" when it cant even fit 5 mega pulse and a 500mn.   
---
if not for the use of being an expensive ass mobile depot. i doubt we'd see it used for anything but hangar decoration T.T
---
That really depends on what country you live in. 
---
Yeah they even admit it:
---
&gt;	You simply live inside a sort of “bubble of visibility”, within a continuous ocean of players all around you.
---
Maybe being organized isn't a bad thing,  What a whiney loser trash post this was Olmeca, even for you.
---
People who wish they played Eve still pretend to hate Eve while trolling the subreddit
---
The only thing that prevents me from getting VNI is the fact it costs 57 mil at Jita right now, which leaves only 3 mil isk left for me to use. From what it sounds like, Myrm will just be a step leading to the VNI for me.
---
Sisi warriors are the worst of all eve players. I would even put them lower than league players.
---
Slightly above Farmville "players" 
---
I was there. 
---
Not what I'm advocating, but hey. 
---
You should be comparing faction to T1
---
extract skills and then you can be omega for about 500M per month give or take a bit.  
---
Do PI and knock that down to 200M.  
---
Do research / copying and knock that down to 0.  
---
Train one or two of your alts and you are flying for free without having to rat / mine.  
---
Good shot! Looks really nice.
---
It never ceases to amaze me how beautiful a game EVE can be. Good job CCP :)
---
A lot of people decry Eve as *spreadsheets in space*, but if you take your time to truely look  around, Eve is a place full of wonders and beautiful visuals.
---
You can be organised without having access to op mechanics. 
---
I'm gonna need to you calm down about bears.

"LOOK AT ME IM A WORMHOLER"
---
mate wormholers cant go 14 seconds of eve conversation without telling people they're vegans, and that's fine, but a YouTube video?
---
I also do CrossFit, antivax, and am a flat-earther
---
that being a full time TEST redditor is harsh these days
---
&gt;We have quite a lot of submissions about the Plex price at the moment.
---
/Thread
---
projectiles don't use cap 
---
Falcon Heavy was a tech demo
---
yes, I was hoping for Ghostbusters!
---
This whole PLEX thing isn't rocket science. The population that buys plex for RL $ (pvpers who lose more than they grind in game) is shrinking while the population that buys plex with isk (multiboxers and krabs who lose less isk than they grind) is increasing. 
---
The plex price is just a reflection of the relative proportions of people who lose more than they grind vs people who grind more than they lose. As the game swings away from pvp to pve the plex price reflects that.
---
Mittens was banned following the incident at fanfest.  He served his time. 
---
It turned into a guessing game. I haven’t disclosed anything about him other than he’s a trainer in the US. If that’s all it takes to dox someone then mb. But I feel his privacy is still very much assured. 
---
It’s also an instant mobile depot. It’s also good for wormhole site running. It’s not entirely useless outside of the “expensive” mobile depot 
---
for new players, making more obtainable things likes subcap brawls more fun and enjoyable isn't a bad thing either tbh
---
Minecraft or SimCity 3000?
---
Very good point. I think it is highly probable that he was a skirmish FC and then stopped FC’ing towards the end. 
---
Walk into the training room wearing a t with his Toon name on it and see him freak out when he sees it :-).
---
Observation. When PLEX prices are high people are likely to play for a sub instead -- but not at a bulk discount (like the people who buy PLEX to sell on market), but more likely at the higher one month rate in the hopes that prices drop before their next subscription deadline. 
---
my advice, look into a nullsec corp.  they often offer NewBro VNIs to help new players get set up
---
BUY HIGH
---
SELL LOWWWWWW
---
2.22 Bil now as I'm typing this :)
---
one of my favorite ship hulls. 
---
if EVE was real, i'd probably try to turn mine into a carrier.
---
Well the point with a VNI is that you go to a forsaken hub, drop MTU in the middle and orbit it for 30 minutes while you do something else.
---
If you use your computer for an unhealthy amount of time anyway doing stuff, it quickly adds up.
---
I pay my sub anyhow.
---
k
---
As a new player I agree,  also I’m not really looking forward to flying capitals since it seems rather tedious. At this point I’m honestly happy to just fly cruisers and battlecruisers and I’m excited to start jumping into t2 ships, but capitals? I feel there’s 0 to no point for me to train into one YET since even if I do, they will most likely gather space dust in my hangar 80% of the time.
---
Yeap, it is a bit of a waste at the moment.
---
The Ark looked even better until they came up with this new (inverted) color scheme. I liked the old version way better.
---
Are you in the military? Was your instructor?
---
No but it still suppliments too much. There is a big difference between having to make 2.2 bil / account / month (current price as of time of this writing which may change drastically and very fast) and having to make 200-400 mil to have an account / month.
---
Just give it a bit of time at the current rate of price increase :)
---
He gets dropped on cuz he’s a douche
---
As a formerly new player I can say that I don't give a single crap about capitals, super capitals or any engagement they might or might not be in. Never have and never will.
---
Unfortunately, it seems that the end game seems to be little more than becoming a cog in a null sec alliance and doing nothing but "press f1". Thus the "formerly" comment. I let my subscription expire this morning. I feel bad about it because I had hoped for more from the game but I found no reason to undock anymore. It's a visually great game and I think the mechanics are decent. it just seems a bit lacking in various areas to the point that it isn't worth paying for anymore.
---
HS miners mine ore for my ships.  I'd put them above SiSi warriors.
---
Ummm no. We sub or alpha. very small portion of us plexes their mains. And for 2nd and 3rd accounts, they don't need to be active at all times either, only when really needed.
---
&gt; only 20~30 hours a month to get Omega?
---
High level players who do things like incursions are only grinding 5-10 hours per month. Plex is about 2b currently, so with an easy 100-200m/hr for income then you have your plex with little effort. 
---
Worst case you can grind L4 missions *slowly* for a meagre 50m/hr income and you're still barely needing 20 hours of grinding per month. 
---
Eve players whine a lot about plex, but when you look at the time involved, it's a complete non-issue if you have unemployed levels of free time. 
---
I mean, to be fair, you don't have to join a huge alliance and just be a f1 monkey
---
if you want more, something more interesting, that's entirely possible to do
---
Who is "we"? You think this is about you?
---
You can use Discord ID as an example to...
---
It wasnt a timing issue.
---
CCP tried to fix bounty flow into the economy by the fighter nerf. People know isk/HR ör yield nerfs never address macroeconomic problems. They were rightfully mad. The debate was about ticks.
---
Fighters were already op back then and are still op now. This nerf will be about PvP and everyone sees issues pertaining to pvp. This is why people were mad then and are fine now
---
&gt;People can do that
---
No they can't. That's the point. If they could there would be roaming fleets in delve or other highly defended regions right now and on regular basis, but there arent. Also we wouldn't be in as big cap proliferation pickle as we are.
---
There are, actually. 
---
I will never forget flying my noob solo Raven off into space, and somehow running into Zarvox in a solo Machariel. We traded blows for a while, then he convo'd me to fleet up and fight Horde. He killed about fifty battle Griffins before we finally died. It was fantastic.
---
I quit Eve recently for similar reasons so I'm glad to hear he's moving on in the pursuit of success. o7
---
Given that the origin conduit is open and right there, this smells strongly of an intended feature. You're not *supposed* to fight the Leshaks, it's just a bonus room sort of thing and a hint. They're building a station it looks like, or maybe the station is building something. This is just a teaser (and a cool way to do it).
---
Then I just give them a response as well so what is the problem?
---
I know it has saved me from someone buying up a specific ammo on the market and relisting it at 10x cost a few times
---
HLOD! 
---
Also I have the right to interact with people on a thread I made
---
Double rep Myrmidon can tank L4 difficulty level content while standing still, VNI can't. Also it is a battlecruiser so it can use fleet buffs and MJD. 
---
I mean, EVE isn't really a video game anymore, it has been more of a macrotransaction and player count inflation simulator for a couple years now, since CCP started fishing for a buyout.  Still hasn't quite recovered to video game status.
---
Finally someone below me. Yippie
---
you can take the origin gate in these without killing the rats
---
&gt; Who is "we"? You think this is about you?
---
Us 1,2 account legit players. Granted some exception will remain such as people in 3rd world countries etc. whos income is actually not high enough for sub based games. Those will be unfortunate. Also, same question to you, You think this is about you ? Do not generalize.
---
&gt; There are, actually.
---
Yes, and we see just how unspecialized and successful they are at culling Rorq and cap proliferation. O I wonder why there aren't more of them and in large enough numbers to be actually meaningful ...
---
It was 0600 Standard Galactic Time aboard "Rats McGee" and Captain Killmarks was leading his rag tag crew of misfits and normies on another mission of great importance.
---
The rumours in the brothels and casinos of Black Rise (establishments Captain Killmarks like to frequent) suggested there was trouble brewing in sector 69. According to sources (employees at The Rakapas Queen, one of Killmarks's favourite transgendered brothels) there was a new face in the black market spice trade in New Eden. Considering his sizeable investment in the Spice trade and the fact his brother, the ships cook, was also his best customer, any news in the world of Spice warranted investigation.
---
After weeks (or days, possibly even hours. Spice tends to really mess with your perception of time) of deep thought and investigation the crew of the Rats McGee learnt two things. Firstly, Spice really gets in the way of productive investigative work and secondly this new face in the game was a individual going by the name Jessica who was operating out of the Delve region working alongside the fanatical blood raider pirates.
---
Fast forward two cycles and the Rats McGee's crew have successfully navigated treacherous wormhole space and landed safely in the system of PR-8CA. After initial scans of the area were complete it became apparent that the blood raider infestation was greater than the Captain had feared possible. Fully capable combat fleets providing escort to an advanced industrial complex the likes of which he had never seen before.
---
After preliminary scouting of the area and a consolidation of assets in a local freeport station a plan began to take shape. They would find this would be competitor, eliminate the threat, take all the Spice for themselves and return to Rakapas to live the rest of their lives as Spice Kings and Queens and other non binary regal positions.
---
And so the campaign began, scanning down Blood Raider Shipyards and prisons, blasting clear any resistance and taking prisoners and assets back to Headquarters for interrogation and to finance further raids. But even after weeks of starvation, torture, humiliation and sexual molestation the captives yielded no information of value. It seemed this mysterious Jessica figure was leaving no trail or clues as to her location. That was until one fateful evening. Rats staggered through the airlock, stinking of sweat, spice and shame... his usual perfume but with one unusual addition. Helium....
---
Captain Killmarks grabbed his brother by the scruff of his kneck, threw him to the ground and gave him the kind of stare that would turn the transgendies of The Rakapas Queen to jelly.  Staring into the eyes of his delinquent brother, both in arms and blood, Killmarks simply stated... "Where".  Blabbering through stiffed tears and post-spice binge withdrawls Rats replied "I...I.... What do you mean brother?!".  After a stern slap across his squirming brothers face, Killmarks attention was drawn through the airlock window into the bay beyond. Stepping over Rats to take a closer look, he notices a Astero Class Space Vessel in the hangar filthy with the stain of Jump Exhaust Fumes. Gradually the pieces begin to fall together, as usual his weak minded brother couldn't sustain on his allocated rations of Spice and turned to local pirates, the very ones they were hunting, to get his fix...
---
Killmarks turned around to face his brother with a unexpected smirk on his face. "Dont worry brother, as usual your fuck up has given me a idea".
---
To be continued.....

Automod should remove this crap copy pasta

I don't think high ISK prices for PLEX is a bad thing for CCP. If you're selling a product and that product has greater value ($$$/ISK) then that seems that it would be better as far as CCP is concerned. Why should they change anything? In fact, consider CCP's new owners. They would probably want to make the game far more of a grind that you can subvert via $$$. That's the MO of addictive mobile game developers.
---
I personally don't see PLEXers as leeches. Think of the guy paying for 5 subs for his gameplay. A whale as far as CCP is concerned. Now, if he pays for 4 other people's sub's and they play together and give him all the money at the end that arrangement is almost identical. All that you have done is move the 4 boxes off the guy's multi-boxing setup onto 4 other people's PCs. In fact that's what's happening. Those grinding for PLEX are working to generate ISK for that person, they just don't happen to know who he is.
---
or life is really short and not doing something you want to do is just a waste... no time like the present! 
---
Is this a joke? You see Nestors all over. I've even seen them show up in nullsec pvp lately.
---
That was December weekly volume traded. Anyone else able to help ICY out?
---
The only issues with battleships is the transport to the escalation system. Also, T3C's are the most prominent for escalations because they can move safely.
---
aye they seeing use as logi lately, though i'm still seeing guardians prefered.   smaller sig, better resists. etc.
---
So Zarvox starts streaming more Kerbal and World of Tanks than Eve and then suddenly he needs a real job? Shocking.
---
if you have any assets left please contract them to simon zaonce.
---
Damn that is huge
---
I used the following : [Hawk, Hawk]
---
Ballistic Control System II
---
Crosslink Compact Ballistic Control System
---
Small Clarity Ward Booster I
---
Small Capacitor Booster II
---
Astro-Inertial Compact Missile Guidance Computer
---
5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive
---
Light Missile Launcher II
---
[Empty High slot]
---
Small Warhead Calefaction Catalyst I
---
Small Processor Overclocking Unit I
---
Missile Range Script x2
---
Navy Cap Booster 400 x4
---
Scourge Fury Light Missile x2308
---
It was really cheap (something like 150-200M for 3 hawk fitted),  the main investement is the 3 pilots I already had. I set an orbit 20 
---
on the gate and let mwd on while cleaning room, I used shield booster only when takle is aplied to one hawk, since they speed tank everything when they're moving freely.
---
Theres still a few spawn that can kill you, mostly trivaglian one, with a lot of scram and/or web, but the setup being cheap you don't really care, implant aren't needed aswell.
---
I used to run shortly after frigate got allowed to run abyss, and I could pick up all node thanks to mwd plus Dark filament bonus, and as I mentioned you loot (If it still the same) the triple of loot a normal abyss would give (since theres 3 pilots and you used 3 filaments)
---
I never ran out of time without losing a hawk, altought due to the low dps (200 per hawk) it can be short sometime.
---
If you have any question ask me, I can't find It atm but theres a few videos about It on youtube aswell.
---
13 starving leshaks would be worse
---
Holy fuck.
---
and vegan
---
I have a pretty one with a Providence too. It's looting another freighter killed somewhere in low sec by roaming EVE Flight School fleet.

How to people manage to spend millions on their thimble collections or lawnmowers or performance tires or or or?

Do you think its the SP farmers and the bots that are bitching?

Sooo... Anyone going to admit that they bought \~$20,000 USD worth of PLEX?

And, put it in some random-ass station...
---
I don’t directly benefit from this, as I don’t own any Rorqs and I don’t super rat anymore. 
---
The problem with this argument is and has always been that you’re arguing that something that is already difficult to do (killing rorqs and supers in Delve) is somehow going to become more difficult without nullified interceptors. It won’t. Whatever impact it may have in Delve will be negligible because folks aren’t bringing interceptor swarms through Delve often right now anyway.
---
The reason I and others advocate for this isn’t because it would benefit us, it’s a fundamental philosophical difference - namely, that there should generally be more risk in the game, not less, when it comes to PvP. This change would increase risk for folks in ceptors. 
---
There are other things I’m advocating to create risk for folks in Rorqs and supers, before you start going down that path. Some of them are happening in April. 
---
Walgreens?
---
Noone cares, you lost, deal with it.
---
I remember when i first saw a video about eve years ago. There was a Provi in it and i was like: ok, i want to play this game and i want that space ship!!! Than i figured out it's a hauler... Still, this is my favourite hull design.
---
I like that Idea, honestly. Don't hide it, just embrace the PVP
---
That is a \*sexy\* cake.
---
This is where the fun begins!
---
The cache behaves like the ones in normal abyssal site, Origin Gate was open all time from when I entered the site. 
---
Tested this, can confirm.
---
Wasn't a bug it seems but working as intended.
---
What a beautiful image!!
---
It looks like it's not a bug but ccp hiding stuff in plain sight again. Expect more this weekend from the first fanfest event 
---
I mean, you can probably get away with an athanor, but theres no way you could get away with a tatara.
---
Was a bit surprised when I entered a site with so many leshaks. Considered it a bug because I encountered bugs in abyssal before. But it looks like you are right.

doesn't want to be F1 monkey, also doesn't want to FC or be part of logistics :sun:

  Does this mean my Zarvox corpse is worth something now?
---
That and that CCP almost never tinkers with the market, letting the in game economy run on its own. They don't interfere with Trit prices, why would they mess with PLEX's? 
---
&gt;So for the sake of the subreddit
---
when can we just give up and let this cesspool die in a beautiful fire
---
Genuine question: as far as actual wars go, do people willingly interact with the sov system, broadly speaking?
---
tfw you effortpost at globby 😴
---
because with any luck we can finally fucking kill this shithole
---
&gt;But those people who were using plex for ingame time weren't spending money anyways, so why would CCP care?
---
The flip side is without said players the demand to buy PLEX wouldn't exist, and it would have no value, and then nobody would be buying PLEX with real money either. 
---
CCP won't mess with the PLEX market in all likelihood, same as they don't mess with trit prices, or titans, etc. Instead letting supply and demand do its thing as always. Eventually the price week plateau, somewhere. 
---
Truth bomb? Nah, that was a straight up Truth Doomsday.

&gt; it wasn't the savior that half of the EVE community has been hawking this to be

  You must be mixing it up with the 64 bit client.

LOSE YOUR PIECE OF THE PIE   
---
THATS THE HODL WAY  
---
Hopefully it’s not travelling through Uedama.
---
They're also semi-permanently aligned with The Initiative and Test, so even bigger than those numbers suggest.
---
I've drifted away from EVE, but still enjoyed Zarvox's content. Glad he's taking care of himself though. 
---
That’s why you see groups of black ops jumping round null, just cyno them in and out.
---
No worries 😉 
---
he is the retard that told corps collectors to kill themselves in the forums because they killed his super on sisi :-D
---
o7 master splinter

Also don't some euro countries have cheaper sub costs? I heard people saying that a few years back but never bothered to check it out
---
That's what she said
---
Brisc you should run for the CSM!
---
Yeah, that works, but needs multiple accounts.
---
nice touch on the live stream lol
---
Hahaha the cringe in this post is top quality.
---
That nod when he's holding a shitty old pea shooter. 
---
I really don't understand the point of CSM
---
That’s a great idea. 
---
In fairness, it is. It's a beautiful game *under* the sprawling, often-outdated UI. You're right though: truly a place full of wonders and beauty.
---
The tones... this is perfect. &lt;3
---
Well, its still goin up.
---
Perimeter plex is kinda holding around 2.2 Bil / 500
---
Jita 4-4 plex is goin up, at 2.5 Bil / 500 now
---
Maybe someone wants to shift the market for it a bit from Jita to Perimeter. But I don't see the point in that since its a single jump away and all you do is dock up, buy, stick it in plex vault and can take it out anywhere else you want in New Eden.
---
Wait, so you can pop and scoop, then just run out with the goods?
---
Arguably the case can also be made for cynoceptors. Having to throw away a t3c for a disposable cyno because your opponent has bubblefucked the entrance to their space is, imo, unacceptable.
---
Original poster brings up a valid point, and a punch of Dev fan boys discount it.  
---
I think skillpoint saturation is as much a problem as inflation. Extracting your skillpoints every month and using the money to buy plex for subbing makes the isk cost of playing every month using plex very cheap.
---
This could be part of the new event coming, since it looks it will be a Triglavian one. By how the waves, the grid and the rules applying to the site look like, I'm quite sure this is.
---
Yes, but they don't taper down to 0.
---
Sigh I need a better PC. If this was on my client it would look like a potato flying through a dusty cloud
---
Thanks for that input
---
There is a lot more to it then just interceptor swarms and Rorqs. I did day general lack of nullification and while I brought up Rorqs, it is also meant in more general terms.
---
With proper nullification there would be a lot more people flying in and out to take out various targets, not just Rorqs or just caps for that matter. And they wouldn't have to necessarily be in swarms for these other targets.
---
As far as risk goes there is already plenty for any offensive group or player, it is why things are the way they are right now, instead of being better.
---
One of the oldest scams in the game
---
Garmur is Audi, Orthrus is the reel Lambo!
---
read about margin trading scam
---
I guess there’s really no downside to being completely wrong on Reddit. 
---
Will do. I almost beat him by a second. Thanks
---
I don't think you know what the word "bigotry" means
---
Still less time than grinding. 
---
Tell you what... decide what you want to run, and in what space, then come up with a ship/fit you want to fly, and post that information on this thread. When everyone's told you why it was dumb, and you've fixed the fit and decided you're ready to undock, I'll buy you the ship/fit and contract it to you in or near Jita, unless your "where" is closer to another trade hub where I have "stuff."  
---
Your budget is 250 million.
---
Go.
---
Can you upload the image somewhere else without compression? I want it for my desktop.

:exhalescloud:
---
Looks like I'm 4,5bil richer. Honestly would do it again if price double again, but to be fair I just don't need the isk. Or maybe I do but I would need the injector market to calm down.

XxX
---
The graphics aren't a fundamental component of gameplay within EVE. The spreadsheets are.
---
Yes. Did this, worked well. :D
---
Then there is a different delivery hangar in addition to the one I know vOv
---
EVE is a damn hard game to stream, just because how easy it is to pinpoint the location and the nature/acceptance of meta-gaming which would be frowned upon in other games. Unless you play with a longer delay, making it near impossible to interact in a meaningful way with your audience.
---
Props to those who still do it. And best of luck to Zarvox in IRL accomplishments!
---
Getting mc blobbed is fun god dont you know anything.
---
How many hours is too many hours to grind up isk enough to PLEX?
---
Considering i did spend quite a bit of money during my Eve career to be able to keep those graphics settings on maximum, i have a different view on this topic.
---
I d be all with you basically... But dont forget, some folks are around over a decade here. And as a 15yr old youngster some stuff sounds cool that later becomes cringey ;)
---
I woulda shot him tbf.
---
triple rep myrm is amazing but when it comes to pve theres no reason to pick myrm over vni 
---
&gt;Doing the CEO or high level director endgame is difficult in a mature game like eve so why make the next best thing not as attractive?
---
So you see flying a capital ship as just below being a CEO or Director. Interesting progression path...
---
It still is attractive. Just because something isn’t as strong as it used to be, doesn’t mean it isn’t still unique. Carriers/fighters are still going to be fairly strong given the right circumstances. Having seen quite a few nerfs and buffs to capitals I’ll tell you this: I have yet to see the general trend toward capitals go down.
---
&gt;We all want more fights. Wouldn’t nerfing the almost impenetrable SOV mechanics achieve the same result?
---
Impenetrable? For who? 
---
oO
---
I agree.
---
.....the fuck.
---
Ma dickkkk boiiiii
---
You can play EVE without those graphics, but you can't play without the spreadsheets. That's what I mean by fundamental.
---
This is a pretty sweet shot tbh. +1
---
Done. Don’t forget to share your results / paper with us after you’re done.

---
Always check trade volume history, and prices.
---
* If you are nor familiar with the market for the item, be VERY suspicious.
---
* If the price suddenly spiked, it is suspicious.
---
* If the trade volume is is very low, it is suspicious.
---
* If the number of units on the market vs. the number of units available for sale on the market is very low, it is suspicious.
---
* If the difference between the buy and sell orders is greater than 3% to 5%, then it is suspicious.
---
For a comparison, look at say T1 smartbombs, a non-typical item.  These typically have sell orders that rarely to never sell, and buy order that usually do get filled.  They buy prices are usually just a few percent below the reprocessing value.
---

Who was that really annoying tryhard that used to say "friend" hundreds of times per fleet?
---
Is both combined even possible? 🤔
---
One of the more beautiful ships in EVE :-).
---
Personally I prefer the color scheme on the Ark, but that’s nagging about riches. They’re both beautiful ships.
---
And write Python in Vim
---
I find your username offensive to the elderly. You are unjustly stereotyping the elderly as grumpy. Please remove yourself.
---
I fuckin hate zarvox. What an idiot
---
11 year vet here.
---
I was extremely conscious about the need to find a good name, and I made a basic mistake there. I also wanted to fly in space ships immediately so I didn’t have the patience to come back when I had a good name.
---
It’s not L0LSuBN00pTrOpIa0012 though [just pulling that out of my ass].
---
I agree that as a 15-year-old you’re not quite going to have the depth of experience to go for something sensible. You just grew hair on your balls. Sensible? Come on already! 
---
In theory you could just ghost ride the rorqual and pop out a proc with a cnyo and light it no?
---
A yacht is there already. Perfect taxi. 
---
Also stop poking ceptors, they are already half dead. Only Zenafar ceptor gangs are alive. 
---
Its always the miner's fault, and not the guy with a 2500 dps battleship or 1000 dps destroyer who is fucking up the ecosystem.
---
Did I just hear ‘gila’ or ‘rattlesnake’?
---
well seems like you wont find out

Can't blame him for winning Eve
---
So, there was a [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b103qz/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_march_14/ej138cv/) in the previous week's thread, regarding the differences between FAX and the old triage carriers, and I'd like to see what other people think about it.
---
Do the current FAX get more reps vs old triage carriers, are they more tanky, none or both? In the current meta, they seem a lot more powerful, than what I remember triage carriers used to be. Can someone provide a summary of the changes to capital reps and how these changes affected the meta / doctrines used?
---
I remember that for quite some time triage carriers were a thing for armor fleets (I think mostly as a 'force multiplier' for smaller groups), but there were also 'spider' doctrines (I think Pantheon was first), which eventually led to the slowcats, which, iirc, completely replaced triage (at least for big enough groups).
---
Wow... horrible... /s
---
Numbers for carrier and super ratting are a bit low.  
---
Bling fit, hyperspatial rig + clone carriers should push 60m+. Supers 140m+.
---
If you are getting 70-75m per tick in a super, you are flat out doing something very wrong, such as ratting while brick tanked.
---
Bah if you are going TS Heavy Neut you might as well go all the way and get the storyline one and save 200 MW.
---
The addition of PBR shaders really did wonders for the game's looks. Seeing the golden light of the Amarr nebula reflected off the Providence's hull really enhances the realism and beauty of the game.
---
This ship reminds me of star wars
---
I think it would be neat to give hictors a special module cyno that acts like the current cyno and change the regular cyno on everything else to have some.major downsides
