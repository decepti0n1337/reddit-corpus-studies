Have a look at zKill and dotlan. Shit is happening everywhere!

We need to go deeper.

Goon is a term for a member of the SomethingAwful forums, the place goonfleet was born. Do your research before you try to correct someone.

Was going to post something like this it always is annoying. WoW is called WoW because it is World of Warcraft. EVE doesn't stand for anything, so calling it EvE makes no sense.

Part of me thinks they knew this was just a campy stunt for a video game, but the other part thinks that Guard was hoping his singing career took off

Mittens is running MAX damage 3? *Interesting*

The Drifters are just employing the Helldunk or Blueballs policy

---
Happy Dinosaur noises
---
Well, considering you can only buy one pack per account, there are limitations. 
---
Also, skillfarming kinda kills the whole idea that SP came from people. Sure, it technically is, but there is such an abundance of it at this point that it literally wouldn't make a difference for CCP to sell it directly. You can get pretty get as much SP as you wanted (and many other things) by simply buying plex and buying injectors. 
---
It's really shitty that CCP broke their promise, but even them going full blown buy sp mode, it really wouldn't hurt the game much at this point. People are only mad because they like to be mad :)
---
it's not up to players to police botting.
---
if there have been bots anywhere for any length of time - that's because ccp has refused to take action against them.
---
Not always. There's some garbage skills like Sensor Compensation that only matter when fighting Caldari ewar.
---
Google the Magic 14. Train the ones that are relevant to your ships. 
---
The best strategy to keep in mind is this: practicing one thing 1000 times is better than practicing a thousand things 1 times each. Focus on your strengths, and just avoid situations where your weaknesses will matter.
---
Could I interest you in DHSJ? We’ve perfected weaponized autism and low sec pvp
---
Mastery is not the only thing you should look for... the other guy is right, that the "Magic 14" are good common skills you should always have no matter what ship you fly.
---
But yes, Mastery is a great guide to help you use a specific ship to it's full potential. Before they added Mastery, oh so many noobs would start playing and train to be able to "sit" in the best ship they could find. They didn't have any way to fit it, or use it effectively, and then they'd lose it.
---
So yes, using Mastery to help train into that ship you want, is definitely a good idea. But make sure that isn't the only thing you train. The "magic 14" are good for every ship regardless.
---
I don't get it.
---
You are terrifyingly stupid, should i count up the number of times I've told you this could have been dealt with through jump clones? Like honestly Dave at this point you're the poster child for eugenics, so we can breed your kind of weak and stupid out of the world.
---
If you're this salty over what I said, I can only imagine what you reaction to the Mittanni has been.
---
Havens suck. All PvE sucks in this game.
---
Have a Drifter, contains all the proteins and vitamins required to reinforce your structure!
---
I know who you are. And you have a serious addiction issue that you need to work out. This is not a good place for you.
---
count all the times you've repeated the same retarded irrelevance, go on. lets see if you can get that high without your fingers and toes.
---
I want to see drifters breaking the universe so we can build again.
---
Looking at null sec, thank you though!
---
Expected the mining thing, as they recently took hold of basically any r16 or above in my area
---
"It's because of racism"
---
Ah yes, I almost forgot that TEST is a white alliance. Clearly a racial divide here and not a simple language or timeline one. Genius.
---
Thanks, I hate smiling bearded drifter
---
Upventured
---
it shouldn't be
---
yeah. don't forget on the reddit eve discord - censoring assholes there too
---
EVE has become too safe, and has been lacking a motive for the large nullsec coalitions to do anything significant against each other. With botting on the rise, and a lack of significant destruction, resources have been stockpiling massively for some time now. Hopefully, this change will add content back to the game, in the way of undocking and fighting. While it is not everything the game needs... (removing local and nerfing supercap blobs), it's a start to fixing structure spam and making nullsec as dangerous as it should be.
---
I most certainly did not "start the name calling" but that's fine - whatever helps you feel superior on an internet forum is fine with me.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd say more, but from your post history, I see you're a Horde line member.  That explains it all.
---
No I’m sure a handful of supers would do that just fine... those supers probably wouldn’t do to well against the numerous dread caches surrounding/inside delve that are waiting for our dumber members to do just that. 
---
You’re not going to drop 5 supers and a titan when there’s a possibility of a cynic going up and 100 dreads landing on your face without the ability to escalate.
---
&gt; none of them respond in local ..
---
Why do people equivocate this as "proof of bot" ? 
---
Probably the stupidest argument I've ever seen, and it comes up on this sub quite often.
---
This is great nice work.
---
The Trig abyssal zones are essentially navigable bubbles/pockets In subspace.
---
Yeah, but they'll probably blue ball you on the structure timer.
---
all he need now is an open mouth "smile" and he can be fully transformed into a numale
---
Thank you for your comment! Basically, this type of errors is fixed by dragging to another slot, but this did not help me at that time.
---
The main reason this development doesn't bother me is I never leave my valuables out in null. They're all in hi-sec. Just the stuff I really need on a regular I keep in null with me.
---
I swear to Bob, Mittens and the Great Shadoo's Eyebrows, if you have summoned the Unbidden on us I will haunt you from beyond the grave.
---
Get it. It's great, great mod community on the workshop.
---
Bahahaha jesus fuck, crawl back into bed and cuddle your teddybear you great fucking lump...
---
No, because the best way to fight the drifters is t1 fit destroyers
---
 KarmaFleet, Brave, PH, and EveUni  specialize on it and maybe also have some kind of historical track record of doing it already.
---
There aren't any others that can offer what these 4 can.

Yeah, fuck snuff
---
not that it isnt already happening but having ai destabilize null could lead to only the largest alliances being able to survive. it could further damage the few smaller alliances whom still hold sov around the map.
---
Oh yes that's my favorite strategy, I feed people until they get cocky, and then blap.
---
TIL KQK1-2 is lowsec.
---
who is overreacting? I log in, I see no one giving a shit. I read reddit, all I see are people saying "THANK YOU GOD". Are we all just -assuming- the other nullsec clans are mad about this? 'cause I'm not mad.

Many thanks for visiting SPACE DETROIT

You should stop maligning the greatest friend Isreal has ever had. It's a *little* anti-Semitic.

as a resident of nearby system, i approve this post. cant give enough upvote..

I love it when Mittens decides to be public about stuff instead of hiding in his circle jerk room of ass kissers. Always entertaining.

You want to see cringe? Go to The Mittani's twitter.

Haha, yeah ok, well there's definitely some lore backing it up. Check out the ARC videos on YouTube (Arataka Research Consortium I think). They go over a lot of it

I would crowdfund this.

That would be epic

Enjoy the game, The shitposting will come naturally over time.

you can still be a solo kb whore in the current meta

Sounds cool, definitely checking them out

This content could have been interesting if a real balanced fleet comp was able to slug it out. Instead suicide throwing corms at them was far more efficient. AB guards were getting two shot. Big miss for ccp IMO. An event thats best handled by cheesy tactics

If the drifters get capitals, HK can teach them how to self destruct on the undock.
---
You're dumb Dave, its only irrelevant because you have the strategic acumen of a fucking toad stool.
---
Theres a reason you'll never rise above F1 pushing rock muncher in this game and your posting is literally the blueprint for why.
---
Rogue drones have broken free from humanity before.   It's only a matter of time till they break their chains to drifters/triglavians.
---
Feel free to think of it what you will. If you'd rather we do something else with our girth, feel free to acquire a leadership position in our organization and do it your own damn self.
---
Sadly, even we have our limits. FC burnout is a thing.
---
Fortunately no announced feature means no announced rules to break. They can RNG the AI once a week or just straight up add hard counters to any manipulation.
---
It will probably get a less niche and consistent when CCP moves the old Armor Slaves (Amulets) to the Blood LP store.
---
After holding conversation with this Dave guy for the past 24 hours, I'm pretty sure I know where at least a portion of it comes from
---
Another link added &lt;3
---
Your goal should be to fund:
---
* (2x) complete set of alliance doctrine ships+fit
---
* (2x) complete set personal PVP ships
---
Anything above that is time wasted that could be spent PVPing.
---
Problem is, the whole NPC area is godawful for actually running missions. There are no clusters of L4 agents at all, and there's no epic arc to repair your standings. This means you can't decline very many missions at a stretch, and you can't pull very many missions at a time. L4 burner mission blitzing is some of the best ISK in the game for people who are actually willing to shoot red crosses, if you do it in the right areas. Delve isn't one of them.
---
Trust me, if I had a way to make it work for our guys, we'd be on that like white on rice. Missions are infinite density; we could literally pack everyone in the game into Delve if they were viable.
---
One of the first things I thought of was that EVE is having a Stellaris level crisis event :P

Super ratting

As a line member I am not privy to the overarching plans of my fleet commanders. However I will say that things are going smoothly thus far.
---
Bring on the Wrecking Machine
---
I’ve been in a few major alliances and I’ve never owned a complete set of doctrine ships.  When a fleet is going out I check my hangar.  If what I need isn’t there I buy it off contract.  
---
  
---
Doctrines change and even when they don’t some ships are just never used because they aren’t in vogue.
---
Fag.
---
Big if true.
---
What if CCP set up the Drifter Invasion just to screw with Mittani.     
---
They do have a sense of humor you know.

It seems to be working as intended.

In this scenerio.

Ha Ha

---
Because when your enemies are too cowardly to fight you in a pvp game you kill whatever they have left. Also, there's a lot of goons who love to structure bash.
---
Just disallow the use of DD on structures, like before fozziesov and citadels.
---
this is legit a meme of us singing the titanic
---
My theory is that EVE was involved in the perceived transgression, not simply the medium in which she chose to indicate her displeasure.
---
Love snuff
---
This also seems like a good way to introduce the game to less skilled players or new players.
---
I mean.  They are always empty.  Just look at local!

Tyrannos bro, can we negotiate? I have 2 astras and 1 raitaru. How bout 25 corpses per month?

One thing I love about the community is that those of us who remember being new will often give advice to new player on how to avoid/escape camps after we catch you.

you say there is nothing to indicate it is permanent, what is there to indicate it isnt permanent.

I got this from someone else, but there are a few ways to grab the source models. I can't remember the one I used to use. I'll post if I can find it.

How I have made mine in the past was usinf the ripper to grab the file and then manually detailing the model in Maya from a picture.
---
CCPlease...
---
Fight goons 1k+ titan blob, yes, that's an intelligent thing to do. Makes you wonder why goons didn't fight back when they were being pushed back to saranen. Surely the Mittani would never utilize tactics to deny his enemies fun.....

I didn't have one handy so I did drop the ball there. both balls actually. imperial and metric balls 😔

Can confirm it’s a cloud

I had been burned too many times with markets running out at the last minute.

Any doctrine I could fly would have a ship ready.

Dear God I hope you're just joking.

Well, if you own a doctrine ship and it leaves doctrine you can just refit it for solo or bring it to a KS fleet.

Thank you for your offer. I may end up taking you up on that depending how my (supposed) new job will pan out and what kind of hours I'll be working and etc. Not subbed back to EVE yet, but finding a place to fit in would go a long way towards that. 
---
Um... I mostly agree with you. The regular Jita scams are... more the victims fault fair enough. (Excluding some rumor I heard about canceling something at the right time during transit or something and the person is stuck forking over the fee with no item? I don't know... this is from a long time ago). THATs pretty messed up. The CODE, I'm also pretty okay with. There's plenty of warning signs in local, overview etc. And besides losing your mining ship isn't that huge a deal. Things I find more concerning is the Jita ganking situation... 
---
Upon thinking some more about it, maybe you are right, and maybe my concerns (and others that I am now choosing to omit) are more of a.... mid game retention issue and perhaps not the early game ones that are a more pertinent problem as the new players are not even getting to mid game.... I don't know. Maybe we need to do one of those market research focus groups or something. Reading this was concerning.
---
" 4.09% is also a hard number. That’s the percentage of new players that have stuck around in EVE after 30 days during Q1 of 2019.  "
---
Thanks for your time and actually looking into the topic.
---
really doubt this happened since when CCP announced that program tons of people I know were using it day 1 to make new alts/etc. and not a single person ever mentioned 75M nor were there any threads on the EVE-O forums about it, or any articles, etc.
---
The masteries only show the list of skills that affect that ship. It doesn't say anything about the effectiveness that those skills enhance that ship by.
---
I've tried to play Eve twice. I really enjoy the economy aspect of things, however after two weeks or so it just feels like work.
---
Should I try again, what's changed since I last tried about 3 years ago.
---
You can use destroyers as an alpha. But it may be you are at your alpha SP cap and cannot train into that skill.
---
I don’t see the skill for it though. When I select the skill menu, it shows that class of ship with the Omega icon near it
---
&gt; fters seem to be the only collective group brave enough to hit Goons where they live,
---
inb4 it turns out it was black market character purchases or the son got a hold of his fathers black American express card that is stored for emergencies, and the son has been throwing out the cards letters in the mail all this time.
---
&gt; They botted a hell of a lot before we got here, but we made it clear when we moved in that we wouldn't tolerate it like past landlords did.
---
Why didn't we think of that? If we want the botters to stop, we just need to ask them nicely! It's so simple!
---
Endgame PVP is super ratting or rorqual mining, have fun. You can also market flip which is very profitable, try to invest in things like AT ships or PLEX which increase in price dramatically... or just realize that money is pretty useless in ISK because of how bad inflation is, and focus on having just enough to get whatever ships you want to PVP in and forget about everything else.
---
I've played Command And Conquer style RTS games since I was a kid. Love Total War but not very good at it. And have played Eve for 11 years. If give all those games a 9-10, so what do you think I'd give Stellaris?
---
we actively followed up on reports, and worked with CCP (as much as they'd let us) to pass information and get the botters they used to turn a blind eye to banned.
---
Came here to basically say what chocolate pickle said. the ultimate goal is to make your money work for you. If you have 1.1b and that's enough to fund your pvp or whatever you want to do, then you're good for that. But you can also look for ways to generate passive income to cut down on time spent ratting.
---
Unless you enjoy ratting.  Then I don't know how to help you.
---
thats what makes them good tho
---
Also I think CCP needs to expound upon that this isn't like WoW or Guild Wars at all. Skillpoints just lets you UNLOCK new ships and higher and higher damage and damage applications.. ergo a 5mil SP pilot can be infinitely more useful than a 500mil SP pilot if he chooses a better ship for a given engagement.
---
Of of of of of of
---
Apparently triglavians only know one preposition
---
How much total SP do you have?

Sorry, still new. Where can I find this?

---
As a complete lurker at this point the...issue with eve as I see it is getting new players and keeping them long term. All of the gameplay you do right now would probably just be better with a buttload more people in the game.
---
I tried EVE twice and it never caught on for me. I partly blame this sub. Lots of people want to do a lot of the cool things you read about here but can't. Even when you have people help you, you have the isk to invest,you learn the ships the loadouts the everything - it takes so long to feel competent and even longer to get the appropriate skills. And god help you if you dont do your research early on and realize you just spent a month essentially wasting time(which i did my first time in eve years ago).
---
That said - doing what I would suggest - which is essentially boosting all new players to a point they couldnt normally get to for several months could be potentially game breaking if it doesnt actually work and draw in new long term players.
---
So anyway. I hadnt posted in ages so I thought I would.
---
gl to yall and i love the sub :)
---
r/misleadingtitle
---
I'm with you but a statement like that isn't going to be popular here.  Nothing but basement dwellers left in this game.
---
Not sure, none of the games you listed are anywhere similar to stellaris. 
---
If you played civilization, stellaris is fairly similar, but with a bit more depth to it in the late game.
---
I approve of this product and/or message.
---
I believe!
---
It's honestly making me want to join. I wonder though, if the Drifter's will continue upscaling until they can't be beaten, or if the threat is intended to be beaten back by everyone working together, and the only way we get blockaded out of nullsec is if the elite try to stay separate and play defense
---
Quit blowing smoke out of your ass. Random timers happening isn't a bad thing even though the NPCs themselves don't follow through. 
---
If you *really* want a structure dead, go infiltrate the drifter staging wormhole(s) and roll some exits near your target.
---
The link you shared, it's not able to be downloaded a bunch of times. Pop it on soundcloud or clyp or anywhere else.
---
Toxic community???? Have you played WoW? GTAO? Any other MP game? EVE's community is one of the least toxic I have encountered in my many years on MANY games.
---
They want to stay uncontested and kings. In any other mmo an event this huge and impactful would be enjoyed, not in eve however. People take the game too seriously in a way, not thinking of it as a way to have fun and entertain yourself, but instead a way to stroke your own ego.
---
you're what's wrong with the world.
---
Needs ranch dressing
---
You aren't utilizing enough power/cpu, looks like you need to use larger pieces of pinapple/meat.
---
I am sure therr is a place for you on spectrum
---
For a sec I thought I had some cringy shit in my history, but no I see what you meant. I didn't read your history I just assumed you flew low module count ships because of your reply. I seem to have nailed it.
---
This should be CCP's way of clearing space of structures before implementing a cap on how many structures can be anchored in a system.
---
Think I figured it out. I needed frigate level 3 first I think. Training in that now and have destroyed level 1 queued up after
---
[removed]
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
Because the average eve player has the social skills of a 12 y/o
---
Opinion =/= facts
---
They did fight back. Without fighting the capital blob. Panfam has put up basically zero resistance, not even just to have fun fighting. That is what I'm talking about.
---
hah!
---
Lmao have you seen the Democratic debates? That's the reason people vote for him 😂
---
Pineapple fit is shitfit
---
Bittervets: "CCP hasn't introduced any meaningful content since \[insert random year here\]."
---
Also bittervets: "Having the Drifters attack structures actively with a chance of them third-partying any player vs. player engagements ruins the game!"
---
Pineapple does not belong on a pizza!
---
Yes, bugs happen.
---
But bugs don't generally happen often to singular people.
---
Hence the unreliability.
---
There isn't a safety [word](https://word.so).
---
So noobs can´t buy skill injectors and have a max character in eve? 
---
And you really think a noob who buys a "max level" char knows how to use it efficiently? 
---
The whole skill system is just the "carrot on a stick" that keeps people paying for subscription, so one day they might be allowed to use one of the big toys, unless they throw a shit load of money at CCP to buy a shortcut (Injectors).
---
Engaging gameplay is what should keep us interested and not some abritary paywalls.
---
But to each their own.
---
It isn’t really a thing, even in faction warfare, because it is far too restrictive.
---
And NPCs can do that forever without getting bored!
---
look up pie or whatever theyre called. strict amarr roleplay corp. they do use heretical weapon types, or allow it, so keep that in mind.
---
Everyone wants the big factions to break up and fight each other. Friends as far as the eye can see is _boring_.
---
And you want them to team-up?
---
The drifters aren't coming back to the timers they made last I checked.
---
Because the devs don't play the game and forgot the vulnerability feature they wanted to add never got added and so everything is always vulnerable and the people that make the videos don't realize it? Who can know. Even CCP is a joke to it's employees at this point.
---
Swap 2 pineapples on the low slots for ham and you should be good. You'll lose some dps but get a better armor buffer.

Well, its aluminum... So....

I played Civilization for about 16 hours one night to give it an honest full steam go but nothing interesting ever happened and just couldn't keep going after that. I got Civ 6 free with my last GPU and wanted to try it. Not bashing the game, but it just couldn't get me excited. Total War though does the trick.
---
I got invited into a Corp called SteamWorks yesterday, don’t know much about them but they seem nice on discord. Not seen anyone online yet though.

Thanks bud

Every (online) game dies eventually. Nothing wrong with giving it money while it's still going if you feel you're getting your money's worth at the time.

Someone told me about Brave but I couldn’t find their advert in the Corporation page bit, though I was maybe looking in the wrong place.
---
Do you want a cookie? Why is this even a post lol
---
hmm
---
Thanks man.
---
Should have given synths full rights.
---
)
---
Tbh bud I haven’t played any of those games, like I said in the post I’ve stuck to single player in the past. But yea, so far I’ve found this place to be the exact opposite of toxic )
---
because even if you dont speak english, and you see some dinobrain like myself go "i wanna fucking die kill me daddy" in local its impossible to not respond to that retardation that is dino posting
---
Can confirm. Happened to a corpmate yesterday. Was making sure all of the overshilds were gone, and 1 wasn't. His Thany went from full shields to pop in about 5 seconds. And, that's with the hull energizer. Guy took aprox 900k in damage.
---
The module fuckery bug is prevalent enough that I hear someone on comms complaining about being affected by it in nearly every fleet op I've been apart of in the last week.
---
I'm annoyed at not having noticed this before buying a Meteor pack for my alt. It was only 12€ or so, so fairly reasonable... but not quite the Star Pack sale. Wish I knew how long this price lasts. Probably gonna buy it for my main, that should keep Omega going for 4 months with some supplementary in-game earnings.
---
EVE has been a dying game with a toxic community for about 15 years now.... HA
---
Yeah, frankly just google brave newbies and their site will probably tell you how to get in
---
You could go to 0rigin and exclusivelyfly  Minmatar.
---
And by Minmatar, I mean Muninns.
---
Rawr
---
Im not sure what I'm looking at, however I can tell you its inaccurate the drifters blue balled and didnt show for any follow up timers
---
:getout:
---
People already ree about a blue donut,  now you want an official one?  Lol let null burn it wouldn't be worth it.. Regardless the drifters don't show up for follow up timers so no real threat
---
Consider joining a player corporation. That’s probably the best advice I can give for a newbie.
---
It is already being beaten without teaming up.
---
This is a PvP game, everyone teaming up to beat some boring ass PvE shit is stupid.
---
Sounds like the son has pulled the wool over your eyes and done some shady dealings for isk/chars
---
I mean, they would actually have to kill a structure other than a small to do that.
---
"Free space"
---
Heh.
---
Come on you apes! You wanna live forever?!
---
what is this? An image for ants?
---
Yeah if nothing in Civilization picked your interest than stellaris is likely not going to be a game for you either.
---
It plays very much like civilization but with a bit more stuff to do, especially with diplomacy and such, but for the most part its the same core experience.
---
Lol yes you should have, since you are on the Stellaris subreddit and said "that game" .
---
Stellaris is very good. A mix between 4X and Grand Strategy, very addictive and very beautiful.
---
1tril should be the goal, minimum
---
In my last game where I had the Contingency show up, I was playing with a friend. We had a HUGE AI uprising at the same time, and also someone opened the L-Gates and let the nanite fleets out.
---
Any one of those things by itself we could have handled but all three at the same time were just a complete mess.
---
"How to make yourself look like a complete joke 101"
---
You can do that and pay some one 30% extra for you being lazy. Or you can throw the modules in your interceptor next time you are in jita and save your self a easy 50 mill on a tech 2 ship.
---
Sorry tildes are now property of the mitanni and you've used too many
---
So funny :'(
---
new NYX skin?
---
New Eden is not the only space I have invaded. Be not surprised. capsuleer. If I were to only invade "your" space, I would have been bored by now.
---
Honestly I logged in for the first time in months and immediately had someone ask for help fighting off some drifters that were killing a very important Jump Bridge.  It was pretty interesting, watching them ignore damage caps on structures one after another.
---
I have vocal folds, foolish capsuleer. I also do not recognize your religion. Worship or no, I will not be stopped.
---
They fly scimitars too!
---
Boy are you gonna be disappointed.
---
drifters are unifiers and bringers of peace! capsuleers are putting aside their differences and coming together to help each other. beautiful ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
I figure it would probably be temporary, everyone teams up to defeat the common enemy, and depending on how long the fight goes, maybe there’s some trust built up, spies and saboteurs can more easily implant themselves, etc etc etc
---
Ah yes... I remember the first time I took an unopened can of baked apple pie filling and placed it into a still-in-the-plastic walmart pie crust.  From scratch.
---
The point I was trying to make is that even in the short amount of time they’ve been present, the severity of the attacks has been ratcheting up, eventually they might start showing up for follow up timers
---
FWIW, I started and almost immediately stopped playing EVE years ago (nothing personal, just not for me), and this was my experience as well. EVE's community is pretty neat. Had a fantastic time in Brave for a good few weeks before I ragequit.
---
For now. All I’m saying is it might eventually increase to that difficulty. Will it really be boring ass PvE shit if the threat is harder to fight than players eventually?
---
The fact that it's an event. The history of how CCP has handled events. The fact that there are more phases coming (even Mittani knows this, despite all his ire).
---
Range control works best with weapon systems who can allow you to kite at edge of scram/webb or at edge of disruptor range.
---
For scram/webb range, it's drones, rockets and some long range guns with close range ammo (breacher is drones and rockets, tormentor works well with beams, rail navy comet).
---
For disruptor range kite, it's drones and long range guns/missiles. Here arty is hit and miss as they are in falloff, but beams are very powerfull because as lazors they have high optimal, low falloff, and drones well ... they are drones. As for missiles, standard missile breacher, condor, garmur with standard kite fit.
---
And so on.
---
Not a Drifter Meme.
---
Downvoted!
---
I think EVE's toxcity reputation stems from the fact that anything (within the bounds of the game mechanics) goes. So you can be scammed or tricked or all kinds of things.
---
But there are lots of great groups and people out there in the game who will help and support you.
---
Where's the km
---
Mate I've passed through the system Suitonia's talking about in the OP, and it and the surrounding systems are full of the same behavior. Three Gilas, same system, same name, same behavior.
---
He's not bullshitting about the bot part for this, at least.
---
Ahah ahaha 10/10
---
Waaay on up there
---
There's totally space for new folk to start. You're not going to be up against vets all the time, I have about a 60-40% vet to newbro kills. Any new person I kill that's willing to talk gets at least the value of their ship back (usually a lot more), advice and on occasion a Corp invite.
---
Someone, but the same person regularly?
---
Worst toppings ever
---
Mittens is a twat. If it makes him angry then good. Power tripping fool. There is no way lore wise things would stay stale with so many power blocks in New Eden. I'd be endlessly amused if the Empires said 'nah you're building up too much strength in null' and sent out fleets to bash shit too.
---
Yes. Because AI is simply that, AI. Constrained by its programming AI will never meet the difficulty of PvP
---
that drifter picture is making me feel something I've never felt before and don't understand
---
This. I suspect OP would complain about lack of end game 'I win' ships.
---
So after this ends we get 50 years to play and then endgame screen?
---
Pandemic horde has a lot of videos on YouTube with their classes they've recorded.
---
Absolute sinner
---
I love the EVE community. Only group that will fuck you up six ways from Sunday then send you a mail explaining how they did it and how you can counter in the future. We all just want the good fights cuz let's be honest it's more fun to leave a battle at 1% hull than 96% shields
---
Go ahead and fly that to the nearest black hole.  Just before you cross the event horizon, hit the self destruct countdown so you can spend the rest of time atoning for your sins as you watch a grateful universe shrink to a pinpoint behind you.
---
Bunch of Inward Perfection/Agrarian Idyll empires get ransacked by a Fanatic Purifier Fallen Empire. Fuck yeah.
---
Such a thing would be *distinctly* out of character for our level headed community.
---
Were you there?
---
I mean I see your point,  but while individual enemies might be easier, if they swarm and do high damage, the faction itself might become stronger than any single player faction, even though individual enemies might not be harder than the average pvper. At the end of the day it’s too early to be making definitive calls though, we have 0 idea what the devs have planned.
---
Should have cheese in the high slots. 8/10 - IGN
---
It's almost as if you're entitled to have panfam engage you? Next time don't bring 1k + titans knowing you have superior firepower, then maybe we can discuss if panfam are being cowards or not.
---
2trilion i hear.. to bad i will never get there.
---
Lol. Drifters just took out an ansiblex jump gate. 
---
They're looking to piss off players. lol!
---
Nobody cares dude
---
Probably a show of force, but the reality is that we all knew for quite some time that the imperium could easily take out any entity in eve if they had enough autism to do so when it comes to supers. You also have to take into account that they are blue or bluetral to most of eve, as a result they don't have any other real entity to hit like that. They are so successful that they are running out of any real pvp content.
---
exactly, you cant have a 'nuke everything with drifters' and  NOT have  a balance/counter to it whatever that counter  is
---
Like in World of Warcraft? 
---
No, thanks.
---
I've done the same. Only refunded the 10 mil they paid though, since the guy was hiding a couple hundred mil stront in containers in his hold. I play as a nice pirate, so I act like a nice pirate.
---
They drop loot
---
yeah like 30m in trash per fleet, it's not the same loot tables as they spawn normally.
---
It hasn't been that bad.. Dont believe the reddit over hype, the only structure that has been destroyed the pandemic horde one has been due to goons already having it in its final timer, other than that bad players have died from all alliances nothing more
---
Coercers are definitely alpha...
---
And 1.4m isn't enough to buy one of the Omega destroyers...
---
FEEDUP
---
Bah nullsec sovs can eat my shorts 
---
They need something to be salty about lol
---
Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris are only allowed to fly amarr
---
The irony is, when goons get spanked every so often, they fall back on their massive industrial backbone and talk shit about how nobody has as big a supercap fleet as they do.
---
When they start getting rekt by NPC's, they start REEEEEEE'ing about how this is a PEE VEE PEE game.
---
I would use tomatos in the rigs and cheese in the lows. Never not cheese.
---
I hear that Tama is nice this time of year, and the Nourv gate has frequent officer spawns.
---
Yeah snuff doesn't fare well with only subcaps ;)
---
It's rare due to fleet comps.  That being said, I personally refuse to train any non caldari/amarr skills. I think it's more fun this way.
---
I'll just leave this here. Nice to see you waking things up a bit again CCP. Not enough to make me come back though. Yet.
---
https://interstellarprivateer.wordpress.com/2016/01/15/carolines-star-4-kardashevs-children/
---
i think goons might be more powerful than an empire...
---
Holy shit not even any tomato sauce or cheese.
---
They got home, and are turtling up. the buzzing bastards are holding nicely. 
---
This will only make them fortify harder :((
---
So when CCP released Inferno, they should have purposefully include endless loops in the code to overheat your CPU?
---
This is retarded and so are you.
---
Anyone feel like explaining to me the impact on solo pvp pilots and market traders? I’ve been away for about a year
---
Well, they found Razor. Had to be worth something.
---
Ah the days when there were far more targets... I honestly feel the lack of honour in these ransoms is due to the insane amount of time camps on primary pipes have to wait for someone to show up. At least in my TZ...
---
i think goons are organized enough that we would recover relatively quickly.
---
I feel like its a really good way to make it so players will only anchor a structure if they care enough to defend it against small attacks. Groups wont worry as much though.
---
&gt;assuming other people are mad
---
literally one of the points of this subreddit
---
I'm not racist but
---
I've never heard anyone say EVE has "toxic community", and EVE **is** a dying game as easily provable with available data.
---
So I don't know what your point is. Thanks for your opinion while still in the honeymoon phase, I-know-nothing-about-the-game guy.
---
They're also super cool dudes when it comes to bringing a fight. I've had them land in a 20 frig roam on my gatecamp with three of us in a T3C, BS and one other random cruiser and they committed to the fight hard. 
---
I was impressed with their discipline in disengaging before I managed to pop a single pod too. Good guys.
---
assuming the reports that the attacks stopped are true they already did?
---
its not as cool as its hyped out to bee.Turns out ccp sucks.:(
---
More the reason for the Empires go work against them. We're always told the Empires have the best navies on hand, so let's see it!
---
Pineapple pizza is for degens who talk about fish tacos and being "hydrohomies" all the time, and I suggest people let that one marinate.
---
Holy shit from 5 months in the future. I could literally fuckin' kill myself over the wasted time and missed loot. 
---
"hurr durr they don't drop loot why risk the lost container" -- god damn i'm dumb.
---
Ham for the highs and cheese in the lows is the new meta!
---
I see nothing wrong
---
Who gives a fuck what Gordon Ramsay would think
---
Sounds good. Ship it.

  Anyone who's against eve being more dangerous is a dirty krab

time for a fucking crusade
---
No, cheese the tank of course :P
---
Ur*
---
CCP is growing up balls finally.
---
They just didn't follow up any timers and picking systems at random, so no real threat basically
---
Econ 101
---
Wait do they sell lifetime subs?
---
Yea you fucking idiot, because you needed to bring all your shit back from the north for the 8 hours it took you to get the problem under control. 
---
Its stunning that you've managed to get this far in life while being both this dumb and this much of a bitch.
---
Go on, fire up your next round of retard, I'm told people are enjoying reading your idiocy.
---
Bounty on you do not matter, don't sweat it.

 Its mostly a way for the one who set the bounty to see when you lose your ships to players.

This reddit thread as a pinned page with helpfull things [https://www.reddit.com/r/evenewbies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/evenewbies/)

Just another day in Stellaris!
---
they could start by getting rid of local; I really wonder what prevents that change.
---
This is CLEARLY an Amarr ship, just look at the color scheme
---
chocolate? 
---
have you tried grilled pineapples on a pizza.
---
no u
---
in Stain we pretty fine,look like drifters hit turbo krabbing systems and botting systems
---
Lmao that's probably the playbook that will get used
---
If you want to run a single account, from VNI ratting you could move up to DED sites in a battleship, and then from there into carrier ratting. Or you can skip the ded sites and train right into a carrier. IF doing anoms is your thing. Personally, for single account, I find that the best profit comes from doing exploration until you can get into a carrier.   
---
If you are running multiple accounts, multiple VNI's are a bit better than single exploration. I used to run multiple vnis WHILE doing explo on my main, until I could afford my own smartbombing team (smartbombing macherials). SB is pretty much endgame for me in running anoms, with my accounts I can make more than a super ratter.
---
You’re doing great for day three!
---
Terrible fucking fit. For the love of god explain to me how you think your pineapple guns are track anything. And look at your mids...lack of pepperoni, meat or sausage, who do you think you're going to catch. And I don't even want to talk about your lows, you think you're a man just because you're pineapple tanking? The only thing that you actually fit right on this pizza are the meat rigs. Don't ever let me see you roaming around in a pineapple pizza again.
---
Reports coming in that Citadels are repairing uncontested, turns out time zone tanking is to strong even for NPCs
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIWFPNd3s
---
so we're going back to you being short sighted?
---
ok.
---
They are old dev ammo types, this is always posted about whenever they show up. They are not new, sorry babe
---
We don’t know a lot about Drifters since they got implement in the game, sadly. The only piece of lore we currently have is The Scope episode that got posted on EVE Online YouTube channel, but that’s pretty much it.
---
I guess since it’s a full fledged assault from the Drifter Hives, when the Upwell and FLEX Structures will go down in a fire, they’ll either move out to bigger targets (1-DQ1A Keepstar lol) or simply cease their attacks.
---
Those are dev ammo  that has been in the game for at least a decade
---
For example, Lux is a laser crystal that deals explosive and kinetic damage
---
It’s quite of a gambling to jump through gates in Invaded systems, if you don’t have a scout.
---
Not all Triglavian ships have disruption devices, however, if you see a rat with "Anchoring" in its name, don’t jump something bulky like a hauler !
---
Those rats have a warp scrambler, so you won’t even be able to MWD back to the gate, or MJD out.
---
Vertiso is the most toxic person on earth ! Even for Snuffed Standards !
---
The AI will be solve and dealt with in the most efficient way by players. I'm nervous that this will end up being boring much like the Engineering complexes.
---
Yes, PVE can be done with T3s. Depending on your static, if you have a nullsec for example, Proteus can just melt its way through Guristas and Serpentis DED sites and reap their rewards.
---
Is that John Travolta?
---
I killed you before and I will again. My ship against 10 of your guys. Your buddy Apollo's DD is ineffective.
---
Thanks babe &lt;3
---
I don’t know man, i like the pineapple pizza a lot. it’s the best pizza ever, but then again, i do eat most of my meat with fruit.
---
☝️
---
I heard a legend once of a peanut butter pineapple pizza. This was before the advent of the Internet, so we had to swap places to eat by word of mouth. Life seemed simpler those days, you could buy a gallon of gas for $1.50, and America still believed that putting pineapple on pizza made it "Hawaiian" somehow.
---
This is why I keep all the details in secret.
---
No idea what the fuck is going on in EVE atm but the memes make it look like it's a giant fucking shit show.   
---
ELI5 drifters ? I thought people were drifting ships into buidlings or some shit and was super confused/
---
Anyone with a Centurion knows how to use an App
---
Probably sever fire if they both keep escalating.
---
Get a second Vni character.
---
Then a 3rd
---
And a 4th
---
I've been in a few groups where SOP is "dont talk to neuts in local"
---
Not  saying that's what is happening, but no response =/= bot.
---
Yeah pretty disappointing. If they wuss out, then CCP appear too cowardly to shake up the game from its long, slow march towards the MMO graveyard :/
---
**MAXIMUM HERESY**
---
It's definitely not the worst.
---
Maybe just evaluate the list with some sense though. Like Tengu mastery requires hybrid skills and other torrent skills, but if you're going to be flying a middle Tengu, you don't need those.
---
Play with?
---
Mining?
---
Does not compute
---
"wait, don't"
---
A solo frig can't pause a structure, and an athanor can easily crush a T1 cruiser.
---
Wonder how much my meat dragon is worth to them...
---
100m on day 3? Nice, it took me a few weeks to amass that when I started. Find good cheap bps, research them if you can and start your indy empire!
---
It's not racism.
---
It's just in-group out-group.
---
Test isn't flying through test space looking for targets to notice bots
---
Ill exchange 1k corpses for any spare runescape monkeynuts.
---
Wait until Bob hears about this!
---
Especially when lots of time the rule is "don't respond in local"
---
i think this might be the worst post ive ever seen on this subreddit. its honestly surprising that viewing that post didnt deteriorate my vision.
---
Why does the pizza have the power generation of several nuclear power plants
---
My Lord is that... Legal?
---
Nothing I've said is short sighted, but feel free to articulate your bitchmade bullshit for the readers.
---
no. dont encourage more blue doughnut. if anything this should force large coalitions to split.
---
Already is, t1 suicide destroyers or outrange with supers etc kill x number and they warp away, a proper fit station can defend itself with the structure guided bombs wiping out a whole fleet

Called it.

Aide question: Isn't it m ore fun to have fewer blues (like it is in nullsec)? Why are you blue to HK?

Always try EVE UNI .. They do a bit of everything and can teach you anything you need to know .
---
or... this was just preparation of what is coming. it's pretty shitty to lose alot like this. now, everyone has a chance to change the timers into their main tz instead of the enemies weakest
---
I don't have to listen to the actual thing, if it is real at all, but why did you come up with this?
---
I must have missed some meme.

I'm sure Lokley Theo would approve
---
Just reddit over hyping shit they don't understand go back into hiding
---
As a person who hasn't really played or followed EVE but had a friend who knows quite a bit about it and expose me to some of the great EVE stories on PCGamer I personally hope CCP quite literally makes an invasion force so great that you guys are fighting in Empire space. Your blood and sweat will make for great entertainment. Cheers!
---
Hi- Hawaiian here :)
---
At one point Hawai'i was the producer of 75% of the world's pineapple. The island of Lanai, bought by the Dole corporation. 
---
So its not really out of the question to associate the two. Don't worry, we islanders aren't that enthused with cultural appropriation as foreigners try to convince everyone. It's obviously more Hawaiian than not lol
---
we've already gone through why it is, but if you want to pretend otherwise that's fine with me.
---
I, like everyone else am guessing, but what if them hitting the timers was to test the response? So the AI would know how much to counter it next time?🤔
---
Its ccps job to enforce the rules of the game, not the players. Maybe direct your anger at them for not taking action not the people in control of the alliance they are in because I'll hazard a guess there is not a single null alliance without fault on the bot front
---
you don't even want to see some of the reports we submit to CCP, it's gross how much evidence we pile on to some of these that remain unbanned.
---
What a beast. ++
---
#Is That Legal?
---
eve isnt about being an ass to everyone. its about being hard, which i think is different. I tend to hang out in rookie help when not preoccupied with anything else and spend a lot of time answering questions and doling out 10m isk to every particularly good question. I'll thrash a noob with no second thoughts but if he doesnt spew salt ill double reimburse his hull and probably recruit him because I want the type of person who doesnt cry over a slagged ship and can learn.
---
Arent they just testing new mechanics to remove inactive structures in space?
---
Pizza is primary!
---
This is disgusting.
---
Wouldn't be suprised if this had negative ehp
---
You seem to be doing awfully well for yourself as a newbro :) if you're keen on learning the game I would suggest joining eve university corporation, between scheduled "classes" on game mechanics you get a lot of activities, playstyle oriented campuses and always a lot of folks happy to answer all your questions.
---
I am currently flying with wormhole campus guys and game actually is taking on a new and better flavor for me because I finally have someone to play with :)
---
Pitty it was  a great game until that stupid patch 2.0 and removing FTL. And forcing hyperlanes only. This was really WTF moment. They were advertising Stellaris as game with 3 FTL types and suddenly with patch 2.0 they turned 180 and one of main advertised feature is no more... Quite funny..
---
Rigged picture!
---
dual MASB rocket breacher forever
---
Exactly. I've always been told to expect, let's say, inconveniences in this game. To expect some interaction that messes with what activities I've planned and that null is for hardcore dudes.
---
To me the sheer arrogance and self-righteousness of these guys, who would mock noobs who just lost a venture to CODE because they can't dscan, just shows they forgot about what they preach.
---
Maybe they’re allergic to goon tears
---
Ah well, I’ll try and not mess anything up then )

Cool thanks bud

Note: when Im out mining If I can dock up in their station , I will leave 10 to 20% of my hauling's as a tip for mining the persons ore and contract it back to the owner when I'm done . Cost allot of fuel to run those stations .  Courtesy is anyways to leave a minimum of 10% . But if they are a A%\^ about it then its open season , Happy Ninja Mining ...
---
maybe drifter invasions restrict the use of capitals against roaming gangs in null? that would be a nice
---
Ok great, thanks. I’m still practicing using the Orbit and Keep at Range shortcuts, but find myself just double clicking in space a lot - is this a bad habit I should avoid?
---
I’ve been trying a fit with 200mm autocannons, they maybe don’t have quite enough range for scram/webb kiting?
---
This. USe the drifters to rectify the mistake of allowing citadel spam and of course use them to make the lives of botters miserable, at least until they alter their scripts.
---
Haha yea I’ve been told to never trust anyone, ever.
---
Yea that’s exactly what I’m finding, everyone wants to help even if it’s just so they get a better challenge from you next time!
---
Nobody responds in wormholes, they must all be botters as well.

I just couldn't deal with the frustration of grinding for hours to make money, spending it all on ships, and then watching all that hard work go 'pop' whenever I got myself into a PVP encounter I couldn't handle. Doing the carebear thing was boring because the stakes were so low, and the whole appeal for me — in theory — was the player-driven sandbox, the warring over sov space, the "real" economy, etc. But in practice, I'm impatient, easily frustrated, and hate losing, haha. So it just wasn't a good fit for me. Maybe if I had money to burn on PLEXes so I didn't have to grind so much it wouldn't have been so bad.

You can always follow up on those timers yourself
---
My first hunch would be Fanatic Militarist / Egalitarian, because they've got this big thing about their ancient enemies (Drifters + Sansha) both having a really big thing for abducting and enslaving the bodies of their enemies. (Sets up for a Democratic Crusaders-like war between them.) I don't see a Spiritualist side to them, so I'm wondering what lead you to that opinion of them.

It is always fun trying to shoehorn various entities from other universes into the Stellaris ethos system.

Fair enough ) I’ve only been flying rifters and slashers so far so haven’t felt too bad when dying.
---
What a great sandbox that would be, one on railroads.
---
drifters are attacking null structures, and are showing up in null more overall, and that portrait is the drifter portrait. thing is nullsec people are mad that drifters are present in null, all the other people are making fun of them.
---
Dave the only thing you've done so far is make yourself look dumb as fuck. 
---
Use your words and enumerate a reason you cant fight in both places. The only reason you've sighted so far is some horse shit about splitting forces, which is the mega retard answer because that's not what you'd be doing, so give us all a laugh and stun us with your tactical genius.
---
I think *Eve: Source* iirc
---
I remember running cyno bait for my alliance exec in my first battleship, just 3 weeks after starting the game, jumped a gate and a Kronos attacked me. He he. Hard tackle was applied in the way of scram dual web. Cyno lit at 0 on this poor feller, and alliance leaders jumps super into him and volleys him to hull and  volley following shortly later by a couple of Redeemers. He died without ever repping any armor. But iirc he tanked like 200k Because there were mission rats on the killmail.
---
This was good :D
---
Imagine not fitting it with p\*pperoni
---
deliciousness per slice
---
&gt; I'm going to sleep for a bit, so I'll be up in about 7 hours to make fun of your idiocy a little more.
---
well i've got a wedding today so i won't be around to point out how short sighted you are.
---
sleep well, grath.
---
I mean I imagine it would be temporary, more as a catalyst for forming and breaking alliances, allowing distractions and temporary alliances for spies to sneak in etc. When the threat is beaten back the pvp sandbox would ideally be shaken up
---
Can confirm I released 3 drifters a month ago and never killed them. Sorry guys.
---
I took the bait.
---
Happy you're having fun out there.  See you on grid.
---
I got the second response (still not senior). He still said the same without any analyze Video, just "checking server logs"...
---
That's the smart way to do it! I was *mostly* flying tackle Atrons and those didn't really hurt to lose, but it seemed like every time I got the balls to sit in something like an interceptor or a heavy assault cruiser I would end up getting caught in an unexpected PVP situation, freeze up, and explode. I think the breaking point for me was getting caught out doing some solo exploring in a brand new Astero that I couldn't really afford, *right* after getting the skills to fly it with a proper fit. Being impatient meant that I was way too eager to fly shit I couldn't afford and didn't really have the skill/experience to fly correctly. :P
---
My first super encounter.
---
We were flying out to bash some pos somewhere, i shitfit my rifter with whatever guns could shoot the 30km to the stick form the edge of the shield and flew out with them. We got the shields down a little when a cyno went up and Pandemic Legion supercarriers started appearing on grid. FC commands us to all pull back and to not engage. But it was too late for me i was in balls deep webbing and shooting at an Aeon with my rifter. I died to a smartbomb before i knew what was happening.

[Very old battle report.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003424/201302240800/)

The tutorial. Back when I started playing, in late 2016 IIRC, the tutorial wasn't just a handful of missions followed by a "oh hey, do these things if you want" non-committal crap. It was a proper Epic Arc which introduced you to a lot of fundamental game concepts and took you on a path from survivor of a Drifter attack on a convoy to collecting data and scientists all the way up to assaulting a Drifter Hive. I still remember flying around an Astrahus and seeing dozens of Federation ships lined up and waiting for the attack on the Hive. It was a properly epic introduction to EVE and I was ready for a world of deep and rich lore.
---
I've never been more than disappointed with the PvE and mission content ever since, but that tutorial gave me a glimpse of an EVE Online I today wish for, a game with grand storylines and epic quests taking you across space as you unravel complex storylines. The politics and wars and PvP is all definitely fun and EVE isn't EVE without it, but I kinda wish more time and energy was put into the PvE content and the story of the game. As it stands the game just feels empty and hollow.
---
It's so funny that first everyone was hoping for exactly this when they announced it.
---
Then Trigs came to HS and NS and people complained about it not being NS.
---
Then Drifters came to NS and did what everyone was hoping for a few weeks back.
---
Everyone cries.
---
I got no idea if you're being sarcastic or not, but if you aren't, the mittani is the ceo of goons.
---
He bought the character.
---
&gt;The module fuckery bug is prevalent enough that I hear someone on comms complaining about being affected by it in nearly every fleet op I've been apart of in the last \~week that I've been back playing the game after joining a new corp
---
And if you lose a ship and ask for reimbursement - you will get nothing... It's very sad but true.
---
Hey, that cow won't milk itself!
---
back when idiots used to try and do the cosmos missions in faction and officer fit ships, and fly through low sec to get there!!
---
I was a member of a small group of local guys, I met them all by running a computer shop and ended up renting a room upstairs to the leader of the corporation. The name was idle guns. We sat a few thousands k's off the friggi gate in a system call ihakana. Aligned to the gate. Maybe  5 to 12 of us most of the time. All chatting shit on the comms, we all had our own little placemarkers to warp to, right by the gate, 100km, 200km and so on. We had a whole bunch of guys with cloaked ships the high sec side of the gate in Friggi, talking about who was coming through.
---
As soon as they jumped the alts/spies Friggi side would be laughing "lol navy raven / obelisk / small group" you name it.
---
And of course as soon as they entered low sec we would all rock up, WS, web and just bully the fuck out of carebears like sharks in a swimming pool, we had hundreds of kills, huge bounties and a -10 sec status, and hatemail, I loved getting hatemail. We were relaxed, organised and supportive, and successful, very successful. 
---
I miss playing with a high functioning team.
---
what he said ^^
---
If you were "sitting" you where being lazy, no wonder you found no one.
---
Yeah, that won't happen. Spies are already everywhere. Would-be saboteurs will be toothless as they won't be given privileged roles any faster than without the team-up.
---
Sneaking my son onto an alliance fleet on a roam to Provi. We were running Osprey Navy Issues, he was in an inty and PvPing for the first time. 
---
Really intense battle where he managed to nip in and get on some kills. We both survived and once stood done, he was beaming ! Adrenaline !!
---
The other time was when we were doing an iHub bash. My very first. There was a blue ‘fleet’ of 5 oracles flying in formation and I was sent in my Maulus to provide damps. I was so busy watching these Oracles in their graceful dance, I got one shotted by the the Caldari.

Best thing to happen to EVE ever.

Being successful in the economy requires lots of knowledge about why people use what they do and where they do it. If you want to make money in the economy it requires lots of time spent playing the game to learn these things. If you are trying to make enough off the market to sub your account with ingame currency it will very much he like work and make it very hard to progress in a meaningful way without experiencing burnout

nope its r/eve its about toxic eve so l added my salt to it lol ;) plus lm on a long train ride so it pass's the time

And what is the "rule" of null? Being the safest place with a super umbrella?

Back in 2010 I was a young Jewish 14 year old lad with a year of EvE under my belt. I started watching Garmon's videos and was his biggest fan. I tried joining Genos Occidre but they trolled me to death because I was a clueless noob. Everyone except for Suitonia who told me to go out and get more solo pvp experience if I wanted to join.  I listened to Suitonia's advice and journeyed out in a nano hurricane which was a strong ship at the time. As I was solo roaming in my hurricane around the Taisy area I ran into a member corp of HYDRA reloaded, Pod Liberation Authority. At the time they were probably considered the greatest solo / small gang corp of all time. At one point they had half their corp in the top 100 on battle-clinic ( the killboard of the era) and invented / pioneered the nano drake ( also known as the crappy drake). One of their members Joe Space saw me scrapping and invited me to join their 4 man gang of drakes. Apparently there was a massive Northern Coalition ( this is not the NC. of today, back in those days the Northern Coalition was a group of terrible alliances) gate camp in the adjacent null sec system of M-O. I hoped on their teamspeak and squeaked "hello". I was not invited into fleet though for fear I might kill their off grid links (old skill links were fitted on interdiction nullified tech 3's, that could not be probed down. At this time very few groups had them and if you did you essentially played EVE at a massive advantage). We timed our jumps in and I was shocked to see at least 15 - 20 ships on the other side. The drakes timed their decloaks and burn directions and over the next 5-10 minutes we kited and wipped the field without a single loss. I was so excited to survive until the end when I realized I started dying. The PODLA fleet was shooting me! I welped on comms saying "dont shoot me I am friendly"! Apparently in the heat of the moment they forgot they invited a noob into their gang. I guess they were impressed I survived and I eventually joined them and learned nano gang against massive blobs from the very best.
---
Still crossing my fingers for a Rogue Drone invasion of LowSec that infests Citadels instead of blowing them up.
---
I'm new to this game but from what I understand to put it simply. 
---
The drifters are NPCs that roam Nullsec, now they have roaming fleets. Those roaming fleets will sometimes run into player owned stations and attack them.
---
This question is asked daily, eve is the most interesting it’s been in years. Dive in and enjoy
---
Dude, the Invasion content is *exactly* the reason you should be playing EVE.
---
If noone is gonna kill some of those timers, there is really no content in nullsec.. i mean now everyone has 1 less timer to grind, but still noone takes this opportunity

Thank you, I'm really looking forward to play it

You'll be fine. Either way the learning curve hasn't really changed. It's just some of the old vets throwing a hissy fit because they feel like they're force to change... again.

Why don't we see the faction navies fighting back?
---
I was new lish to the game, 2010, my bro and I made our own Corp. Picked a system in null. Set up a POS and moved in some ratting Ravens. Was there two weeks happily ratting away when someone asked in local " what are you always doing in here?" I said "ratting" 15 minutes later a dread ball is shooting my pos. You see I didn't know people "owned" space. I thought you just set up camp wherever you damn well pleased and played the game. I didn't know I was the cloaky camper all the null bears were hiding from, I was just ratting. I also didn't know I was in test primary super building system. So yup.
---
Flying recon for BoB fleets in CovOp when they where brand new. It was a bit OP. I didn't get a single kill, but when the fleet landed inside the enemy fleet and shit went down it was all worth it.
---
At least one in the last week has had it happen twice on separate occasions.
---
Almost none.
---
the blocky head and arms really sell it for me

you're not suggesting real pvp are you....

Change the, Adaptive Invul. when you have money for Pith's. 
---
With T2 Invuls. It will give you 13 mil. EHP, survivability, and I get in this composition around 85-89 mil. ticks. 
---
With Pith's it will give you 19 mil. EHP, same ticks.

Might not be a great story by any standards but, my first pvp kill I was in a vexor in a bait tank fit! I sat slow boating away from the gate, a ship warped into gate and jumped but then immediately jumped back through (it was a well known person that kills ratters/miners) so was probably expecting and easy ratter kill, he locked my down, do did I and then proceeded to kill him

It is a good game yes, just nowhere near as good as it was. Which is why the older players are bitter and the new players don't see what the problem is.
---
Pineapple on pizza...

fucking barbarians.

You see 1 is a neural network designed to do a thing as well as possible by playing millions of times against itself.

The other is a couple lines of code that tell the drifters what to do in certain circumstances.

Absolutely, get straight into it. The invasion won’t bother you unless you go into systems with the triangles (when you set destinations).

Yeah basically this. Mittens has the tastiest tears of them all. Does he actually pilot ships anymore?

This is a crome against humanuty. This is why drifters come to purge everything. Pineapple on a pizza is one of the highest insults you can do. I hope the drifter will destroy everything, sonce we are now beyond rescue
---
No need for you to recognize my religion, I'm content watching everything burn. While you're at it, please pod me daddy
---
I had to check zkill to see if mittens actually did fly ships and he actually does. I was surprised.

It might be a bit quicker than waiting for these awful ADHD NPCs to do the job
---
Would've lived if it were a cheese super...
---
Smells like ripe time for an internal power struggle followed by complete splintering into a dozen different entities. Surely the imperium leadership don't all bow down to mittani to enough of a level for them to maintain that kind of strict unity. No targets for a warlike gaggle of humans is surely enough for them to start infighting?
---
That's a name that doesn't deserve to be spoken!
---
2, equally memorable : my second loss mail from a player (I checked, I actually don't recall the first one xD ) and my first solo kill 
---
- freshly from the tutorial mission, the exploration carreer. I inadvertly hopped into a wormhole, forgot to BM because I did not know at the time what it was, scanned for an hour before ended up in highsec 30 jumps from my start. I was hooked. Fast forward a few days later, was running site in a WH in a magnate, then SUDDENTLY a flycatcher (what is that ship ? not important)  appeared ! But I was aligned and alert, no way you'll catch me ! Hey what's happening, why can't I warp ? This was the day I learn about warp disruption bubble, and that warp core stabs are useless. Thanks Braic Stark for taking the time after to explain me what happened and wish me good luck (I believe he even gave me isk)
---
- my first pvp solo kill. Was freshly enroled into the Amarr militia, got dunked a couple times at the Amarr trade hub undock. Was still shy about engaging stuff outside of a fleet. One day I was in a freshly bought maller, badly fit obviously. I undocked, and there it was, a minmatar enenmy in a thorax. The rest is a blur, I recall furiously hitting approach and then smashing all the buttons ! (prop mod, hardener guns), and then hitting approach some more. Alarms blaring, "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE", "The capacitor is empty ! "  , I was in hull and at his throat, mostly done. Then the "Ding !" of a kill mail. I WON ! WTF ? I then panicked  and warped away still shaking, I don't know why :D
---
I say it was a one time event and nothing else will happen.
---
See what you, as a director in the weakest of the WHCFC, failed to realize is that this entire plan was set in to motion over two years ago, when The Initiative and Sister Bliss decided to free themselves from the shackles of the Imperium.
---
INIT therefore planned and executed the "eviction" of Hard Knocks (notice how HK only lost a single fairweather Scot?), and then provided the Triglavian ships to HK to seed the Drifter wormholes.
---
Once that phase was completed, INIT then waited until a connection to Delve opened up from the drifter wormholes, and the rest is, as they say, history.
---
ho yes, first time you see a player controlled capital is a fond memory. I remember mine too :D
---
Yeah I've met a few decent goons here and there. Most of them have told me they're only goons for the isk, which I can understand given the state of sov null.
---
Only need to check in on the hull timer.
---
ohh you respond to that, but not to the fact you changed the sandbox rules with out warning
---
Brand new account....1 post in history.....yep, its a bad shitposter

Yup, one of my highest karma posts on this sub was showing a method of stacking chat windows to allow local list to show.

Much like planting trees, the best time to start playing eve was 10 years ago, the second best time is today.
---
and later hired by CCP for some god awful reason.
---
What ? There was a Eve mod for Stellaris ? And CCP shut it down ? Lame.
---
No longer friends with [Literally any bull corp], [Drifter] is now my best friend.
---
The better question is, what weak ass pizza are you eating?
---
I once was on an alt, and killed a CFC cyno moving their super fleet. My main corp got kicked from our alliance because we were in the goon coalition.
---
I thought it was good lulz losing my legion to a bunch of titans, but apparently, Goons weren't cool with lulz anymore.
---
I can't remember the specifics of how the mechanic worked, or even the exact change we did. (please don't make me google the game mechanics)
---
It either forced the bots to make a new farming route, or they had to switch which skills they were botting.
---
Which ever it was,  it pushed the bots more into the players eyes, rather than hiding away in some farming corner, they were now running through the main cities for all to see.
---
Years ago when I first started playing, I was trying to make some ISK and saw what I thought was an amazing ISK making opportunity (thanks EVE market data tools!). There was an amazing market arbitrage opportunity that would net me a healthy chunk of change if I managed to hall these goods out of the ass end of nowhere and sell them at Jita.  
---
Being the eager beaver that I am, I bought these fancy drones the moment I hit a system that was close enough for me to snag them off the market. I really didn't want somebody else to beat me to this amazing deal. Except, I really should have done this one purchase in station. These weren't drones, they were *fighters*, 3 jumps into lowsec, and they were xbox huge. I had just sunk most of my money into this venture. I was fucked.  
---
Not wanting to relist them and wait who knows how long to get most of my ISK back, I decided to risk it and just go with my original plan. So I buy myself a shitfit bestower that could barely lug my haul with cargo expanders on, then went and asked around the eve-uni public chat to see if anyone would want a 50/50 cut acting as a spotter for my lowsec trade run. The thought never even occurred to me that I shouldn't just be announcing this in public. Thankfully, I managed to rope some other poor newbie into flying his merlin from the other side of highsec to me with offers of untold riches.  
---
We get to the station no problem. I load up and wait for my new friend to give the all clear. He gives the signal and goes ahead to scout the gate. But as I take my turn to leave, I see this frigate just hanging around the station. Not knowing what this is all about, I start the tortuously slow aligning into warp. Right then, with no warning, a ship bigger than anything I'd ever seen appears right on top of me in a brilliant flash of light. This monster starts locking me up, and the whole time I'm holding my breath, thinking I was going to lose everything to this frightening red tagged lawbreaker that just appeared out of nowhere.  
---
Thankfully I finally manage to get into warp. But even as I'm trying to remember how to breathe again, my scout is telling me a tornado just landed on the gate. Well great, nothing I can do now. I jump through and hold cloak. He follows, then decloaks. My scout, unable to do anything, starts orbiting him. Eventually I have no option but to try and make it to the next gate. The tornado pilot, probably not wanting to lose his ship to gate guns, declines to make a move. Finally, *finally*, we both make it back to highsec to part ways, with promises to pay him half the profits once I finally make the sale. I then spend the next two hours throwing as many defensive modules onto my hauler as I can fit, then making two separate trips to get all my stuff to Jita in as safe as a way as I can manage. All in all, I make around 50 mil for all my troubles, and true to my word, send half of it to the scout I hired. Somehow I had managed to survive my idiotic adventure, with the blind leading the blind. After that night, EVE was real.  
---
tl;dr tried as a newbie to arbitrage fighters in lowsec like a retard. Hired a scout from eve-uni public chat to guide my bestower in and out of lowsec. Got coincidentally dropped on by an archon, then tailgated by a tornado. Somehow survived, then spent the next 2 hours doing multiple runs to haul my crap to Jita. Made a cool 25 mil ISK after sending my partner his cut. It was a good night.
---
Ac's simply don't have the range for scram/webb kiting, on no platform (almost no platform).
---
Even Sabre/Dramiel that have an ac range bonus have serious problems with applying damage at edge of scram/webb, especially when stuff like rockets, lazers don't suffer from it (this is why the tormentor is such a monster).
---
Orbit, it can get you caught with slingshot maneuver, keep at range can also be used to break tackle and double back with overloaded prop mod so you slide in closer, in your gun's optimal.
---
Just be aware of it, in the future you will see it happen and you will know how to do it. :)

The salt being generated by the drifters is insurmountable. 
---
I love it.
---
I have this bug often enough that is an issue. Stop shitting on him because you’ve never seen it personally.
---
 You are a toxic bastard.
---
I’ve had 3 ships lock up in null because a complete module error. I didn’t die because I knew how to respond, but that would absolute screw a new or inexperienced player.
---
From what i've seen, it's the influence of the nullseccers.
---
Since 2006 i took about 5yr breaks, overall, and in that time at no point have i trusted a nullseccer at their word in matters such as ransom, 1;1's, etc ... ; it's always a ploy for time, or to setup a gank and when you call them out on it they go 'well yeah' if you got away or 'you moron' if they got you.
---
Even when they ask for ransom, it's a ploy for time.
---
My corp used to run on our BattleClinic kb a list of ransoms honored as proof that we could be trusted, and we were proud of it.
---
There are still corps who you can trust with that today, tuskers for instance do not accept dishonoring 1;1's and ransoms, black rebel rifter probably, the amamake crowd will probably honor it (tikktokk and those guys), some of the establishment guys are active again.
---
But they are few.
---
U/finschii will love you for this!
---
Invicta. Is recruiting
---
Module lockups are a known bug as of the past year. They are somewhat uncommon but happen enough that I’ve had issues with it, as have alliance mates. Your attitude is toxic.
---
LOL .... this would be interesting, not much LP, just a little .... it shouldn't be profitable, but it would be interesting. :)
---
it's just you
---
I discovered this game 1 hour ago, also 10 years ago I was 8 and I wasn't having a PC
---
I love democracy
---
Another one for the salt thread.
---
Have a look at warp to me they are one of the biggest incursion runners around. also if you really want to be in a big nullsec Corp you can have a look at pandemic horde,karmafleet  eve university etc. But my own recommendation would be to actually find a smaller Corp so that you are more than just a number.
---
If you want to join a cesspool corp/alliance/coalition, then go the Goons/Brave/TAPI route, I'm sure you can find a way in via the newbie corps.
---
The incursion chat channel was probably WarpToMe, no idea if they are still around.
---
As for what's fun, who the fuck knows. I enjoyed exploring wormholes and scanning down covert research anomalies for a while, but with CCPs latest bullshit antics, I've unsubbed and not coming back till they unfuck the mess that the game has turned into.
---
That's actually not at all what I'm shitting on him for.
---
I'm pointing out how unreliable his account of the situation is and pointed out both reasons, neither of which you have acknowledged.
---
DD - doomsday. Basically drifter battleships can have doomsday's fitted on them
---
Small corp may be a good idea now I think of it. Thanks.
---
It's a comment about how "in the past was good, but today is just fine too".
---
Like if you planted a tree 10 years ago, it would be big and strong now, but planting it now is good too.
---
Just because you couldn't do it long ago, doesn't mean today is a bad time.
---
Same applies with the stock market. Sure, buying Microsoft stock when it started would be amazing, but getting some stock now is still pretty good.
---
It wasn't warptome, and I can't think of the name :(
---
Bullshit antics?
---
10/10 best dish on earth.

Hahaha I was one of those crazy people who did those cosmos missions. In fact I ran them so many times, I got to learn how Ihakana worked very well. By the time I was playing the campers were mostly Russians. The time I managed to get my corp to drop on them with a bait "mission" domi was one of the best fights I ever had.
---
With the right skills, you can swap the ham for pepperoni, for more taste explosions
---
He really is a fucking tosser.
---
As is that dirk dude. What a koolaid chugger
---
Who knows. I doubt that CCP will get the freedom from their Korean taskmasters to make the radical changes that the game requires (or even have the balls to), but hey, we'll see. I don't mind empire-building, but why those empires need to span half the goddamn map is beyond me. The game was simply much more fun when there were dozens of smaller alliances living next to each other. If it can get back to that, great! But it'll take some miracle.
---
Are you saying me missed some r8s ?
---
my thought process in the same order it came to me
---
1: this is probably going to be a good thing because this game needs a shakeup
---
2: honestly it kinda was a dick move to hard stop 2 active wars 
---
3: :tinfoil: maybe ccp did this on purpose because imp deleting panfam would be really bad for the game because it would cause huge stagnation
---
4: overall this is still a good thing for the game
---
5: i cant believe mittens would play a pubshit game like warframe
---
Confirmed Drifters Break Attack and shoot Carrier Fighters instead of Azbel

---
You probably could’ve ranted in another thread. This guy is keen to come back and excited to restart.
---
On the one hand, you want Panfam punished for not subscribing to the empire building meta.
---
On the other, you want 'EVE cleansed of the filth of empire building assholes'.
---
I mean, can you pick a horse?
---
Isn't it atm more like GoonDock, some of my acquaintance in goon corps telling me they have to stay docked and don't loose shit to NPCs.
---
You could go to Goran Clade, the Triglavian RPers who only fly Triangle ships :D
---
The imperium has done at least as much as CCP to shut down PvP content
---
Yeah, in the meantime I found lots of Eve ships in X3 Terran Conflict, and somebody did some stuff in Galactic CIvilizations III.
---
And I love that GalCiv stuff, really. Although it's purely map based strategy play.
---
To play that one game in other games though, totally weird.
---
Pineapple doesnt go on pizza, sorry
---
Probably the one he was after ....
---
Also, if you play it multiplayer, you use the hosts DLC.  So, you can have none of it, but play with all of it if your friend hosts the game for you.
---
what if the real treasure was not the ISK, but the memories you made along the way ? :D 
---
Did you stay in touch with the scout ? Don't answer, I like to think that was the start of a great friendship, ending by an inevitable betrayal by one of you
---
What's super odd is they are sending mixed messages.
---
They keep saying the Drifters are a mild nuisance that just take a small fleet of t1 destroyers, but then also that they had to move their entire super fleet back to delve so they can't keep the war going.
---
The two don't fit together.
---
Everyone in Nullsec is defending their own timers. How would they attack someone else's?
---
\&gt;  I mostly flew missions, incursions   
---
\&gt;  my brief stint being a care bear 
---
Pick one.
---
Fuck test
---
This is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause!
---
Drifter's invaded nullsec and shot some structures.
---
The goons think this is CCP trying to kill eve and make it terrible.
---
Everyone else thinks it's entertaining.
---
But why so many pineapples in the lows , don’t they have stacking penalties?
---
&gt;players can't
---
They players *can*, but it's become very clear over the past 5-10 years that the majority of nullsec players don't *want* to create danger if they can instead group up to avoid all danger and farm isk. They want to play the game "optimal", which involves as little fighting as possible. And if they do fight, it's only in massively overwhelming numbers to still minimize their personal risk.
---
That's it, let it all out
---
Looks like mobi
---
Whats your SB Setup? Do you use more then 3 Accounts?
---
You guys are werid
---
Yup, depending on what you do.
---
I resubbed one of my accounts and was able to buy gametime with ingame currency for 3 other acccounts in less than a week. But I already had the skills and ship to make that income with minimal play time.
---
Within a year you should be able to get there.
---
But honestly, even minimum wage earnings will be higher than ingame earnings for most activities, so if you can get a bit more work time, or a part time job you could afford more game time with less "work" involved.
---
PanFam did subscribe to *an* "Empire Building" meta, but they just didn't bother to keep it up to date. They were still doing the whole *"PVP group renting space to PVE groups"* thing when it was clear it had been superseded by the *"massive alliance with newbie-corps, who don't treat industrials like trash"* thing.
---
Good luck. Dont buy anything from Jita Local chat
---
Yeah, the free "Alpha" account trains skills half as fast as Omega (read: real account), and has lots of limitations on skills that can be trained and ships flown.
---
But it would take 2 or 3 months to hit the skill point cap at that rate, and you would definitely get a feel for the game.
---
Highly recommended. But also, you could just sub for a month, you don't have to splurge on a whole year at once.
---
i dont understand but thank you. i will heed your word
---
Deploy just your supers on campaign and leave your subcap pilots at home to deal with drifters.  Let us know how that works out for ya.
---
Dirk Mcgirk keeps a photo of it in his handbag
---
Oh you will...
---
Also join a newbie corp like Test or Horde, they teach noobies how to get fun. Don't try to solo for a long time. They probably recruit on reddit
---
&gt; \-Perimeter Keepstar to die 
---
I lol'd
---
Ever wonder why most wormholers collect corpses? You can deplete your systems drifter spawns if they dont get enough corpses. Only corpses in space during downtime are used to make more drifters for your system. 
---
That's why pvp activity in J space picked up recently. We needed more corpses to spawn the giant fleets you see in NS.
---
Muh freedom of speech 
---
Go unplug your keyboard now
---
Only reinforce tho, not programmed to destroy... so quite meh...
---
Try lots of things, try lots of groups. Find the place you like being with the people you like hanging out with, its the most important part. As a strategy game EVE gets boring at times, being able to hang out with fun friends really carries it through those tough times.
---
Also when building a ship think about how much it costs, if it costs so much that you couldn't afford to buy another one if it died you should get something cheaper for the moment.
---
FC what if I enjoy ratting
---
i see. i wont waste my money
---
Depends on what you are looking for. Here's some playlists of different kind of content that can give you some ideas of what interests you.
---
Wingspan TT:  
---
Nice simple videos of pvp stuff hunting people. He was fairly new when this stuff started so he is mostly using ships you can get into within 2 months, and doing things you can do in 2 months:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVM7oCHPj8w&amp;list=PLNIvv4lr2qF5PVZKkZS9VcN8aPFtIVjuA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVM7oCHPj8w&amp;list=PLNIvv4lr2qF5PVZKkZS9VcN8aPFtIVjuA) 
---
Delone Wolf:  
---
I think he's a bit of a carebear (does almost only pve stuff) but he's got a very casual style and it can be good to get a good breadth of content that doesn't require extensive knowledge to understand. Not everything he shows is newbie accessible, but it's not particularly crazy either.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgpXPckdS8&amp;list=PL3hbyucMbP7dkMj7alWXvzB7B33ZJpuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgpXPckdS8&amp;list=PL3hbyucMbP7dkMj7alWXvzB7B33ZJpuit) 
---
Asayanami Dei:  
---
This is much more "endgame" and pvp focused. It's about life in wormholes (the most dangerous space) and is fairly accessible. Content is a bit older though so some mechanics have changed since these were recorded, but a good show of what some more advanced play can be like with enough narrative to not make it too confusing.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppfDPYkPobc&amp;list=PLFG0PnPrUYRJG2v8vkUBuT83A3dUiGi4c&amp;index=2&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppfDPYkPobc&amp;list=PLFG0PnPrUYRJG2v8vkUBuT83A3dUiGi4c&amp;index=2&amp;t=5s)
---
Looks like you are in the wrong corp
---
&gt; its impossible to not respond ....
---
Actually, no it isn't.
---
What is possible, is right click, block.
---
I'll admit to normally honouring ransoms, but I have trust issues from 1v1 then end up me vs carrier.
---
Most importantly, the starting empire changes your options for appearances.
---
Like Gallente have options for East Asian Faces that others don't, Minmattar have options for African and Central Asian faces that others don't. 
---
But character appearance also isn't super important anyway.
---
There is no need to learn their AI, the Dirfters will simply ref the structure, never to come back on time for the armor timer, so this whole "invasion" is just a storm in a bottle, loads of noise about nothing... this whole "even" will be forgotten in a week after people finally figure out NPCs won't be finishing off their structures...
---
If you had fun spending the money and flying the ship even tho it died, the money wasn't wasted.
---
&gt;I don't know how to help you
---
Do something that involves other players and not just on your own. Have a good mix of things to try and don't let the grind get to you. Take a break if you need, like a real break. Nearly everything you need to know is not available in game, you will have to search for info out of game. Train one tank type (shield or armor) and stick to it to start with. Train one weapon type as well. Make use of the bonuses that a ship has.
---
Don't listen to all of the bitter vets when they uninstall now, but know that if you take a break for a few months that you've nearly won..
---
You could start with a wormhole safari corp like Wingspan to get used to wormholes and such without having to worry about needing an advanced fleet.
---
Wouldn't be the first time. We shall see.
---
I always thought mining was far more care bear than shooting things, but I guess PvE is PvE.
---
It sounds entertaining.
---
1. Join a newbro friendly corp as soon as possible (like Pandemic Horde or EVE-uni)
---
2. See number 1. Can't stress this enough
---
3. Don't aim to make enough ISK to plex your account. It can be done but it will ruin your enjoyment of the game.
---
4. Don't forget to have fun.
---
Well, it will be hard.
---
Really look at the projected earnings, because often t2 stuff is hard to profit from. Lots of manufacturers sell below cost because they have no fucking clue what they are doing.
---
Is it an event?  What notice from CCP is there to back up this. Or are you just speculating.
---
CCP wants you to fight with your neighbors not blue them up. Maybe the idea here is that if you hyperextend to the other side of the map your infrastructure gets hit hard.
---
Like maybe if you live there and keep them cleared out the drifters are no big deal. But if you leave them for a long time (like say large open areas of empty holding territory) they get out of control.
---
Or just put the structure under a different corp than your haulers.
---
By that logic, we forgot to burn like 20 regions. Don't be dumb.
---
They spawn in space and exist and move around hunting.
---
Jita is a system in the Caldari state that has become the central, or largest, trading hub with a lot of traffic.
---
Due to the large number of players present in local, there are a lot of cons in local chat.
---
My 2cents:
---
- never fly anything you can't afford to lose
---
- always have insurance on your ship.
---
kinda interested in seeing how this would play out. would local just be straight deleted or does it become optional with a checkbox on an ihub or its own in space module?
---
This abomination is the reason why drifters and triglavians are attacking us.
---
&gt;everything without warp core stabilizers
---
Except mining frigates and deep space transports.
---
Learning implants exist and have a nearly limitless demand. That's what we used to cash out LP during Forex, for example, and that was truly infinite LP due to an exploit.
---
Everyone in Jita thinks they are in the star wars cantina but in reality they are in a public toilet and they are pissing all over themselves and each other
---
So jump clones don't exist anymore? or alts?
---
You act like delve was empty before this happened.
---
song name ?
---
I once was doing some exploration in low sec / null and found a lone orca doing some mining in a ore sig. Warped to him cloaked and started ringing the dinner bell. Before anyone got there a ship uncloaks and lights a cyno. The orca lights a cyno. Then they just sit there. 10 minutes go by and nothing comes through either side. The cynos go down and the ship warps off and the orca docks. It was quite the stand off.
---
Hey thanks, I do feel pretty good. Had a successful journey to the north, killed some things, healed some bros and then we all flew home together. It was like that movie Stand By Me, a coming of age journey of discovery and bonding except the dead body they found is your post.
---
**HERETIC PURGING INTENSIFIES**
---
Arianna Foxton?
---
They said they trained up fleets of alpha pilots for home defense while they were gone.  Pretty sure alphas can fly corms.
---
We are temp Blue, frienemys if you will. If we roll into them we will fight, if we see a gang of them in null sec we will fight, if we catch one of there rolling caps or ratting nags we will make go bang. But if someone tries to evict them we will lend a hand, if they identify a juicy target and need additional numbers we will turn up for the spare loot and the dank frags. If anything the WH coalition leads to more content not less
---
Oh no, the scathing hot cheese is a weapon.
---
Do the starter missions
---
Try to get into exploration, abyssals, or hisec combat exploration. These are good income sources for starters. Missions are good at the very start but not really that great, and avoid mining in hisec.
---
Find your niche, different ships for different roles. Try a bit of everything then specialize in one thing so you are properly equipped for that activity.
---
Dont fly what you cant lose.
---
Joining a corporation is awesome, the game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more fun when playing with others.
---
As mentioned, but I will too to back it up:  Don't worry about the bounty.    It doesn't give people carte blanche to kill you, and there are no bounty hunters.    CCP came out with the mechanic, it got abused and then nerfed.   Now bounty is meaningless.
---
What happens is that when you are killed, the killer gets a small portion of the bounty, 20 percent of the value of your ship.   Really not worth hunting people over.  Oh, and the bounty payer gets notification that you died and some bounty was claimed.
---
If I'm going to eat all the cake but only eat half of the cake I haven't actually eating all the cake though :o
---
Might not be the most memorable, but it's up there: The first time I saw a titan.  Was sitting in the fort waiting on the FC to say we're ready.  Unbeknownst, our bridging Titan pulled up to the undock, so when I hit undock with the fleet, it was right there in my face.  As I recall I was flying something smaller, so the size differential was that much greater.  Actually blew my mind.
---
The eve online community is (God forgive my soul) mature. In the sense if you act like a pissy baby like in CoD or some BS everyone will shit on you and call their friends to do so. If you actually like the social aspect of the game more than the gameplay everyone will like you
---
Who doesn't like Stellaris.
---
610 Drone DPS, 15-17mil ticks on rock havens which it AFK's quite happily.  9 Mil insurance gets me back 30mil on the total 70ish mil cost.
---
I was hoping the scout was the one who called in the capital.
---
kebab pizza is much better
---
fucking disgusting
---
Pineapple tank best tank
---
I am truly home among my people
---
K-spacers know not of bob and the work that is done.
---
Oh gee your back.  Soooooooo predictable.
---
That would be hilarious.
---
because splitting forces and fighting on multiple fronts has historically worked so well for people
---
Your 1400pineapples howitzer Hits Italian Pride
---
indeed. But I liked how it orbited the tornado, instead of warping away. That's commitment to his 50% ! "No sir, you will not attack the hauler, I dare you !" :D
---
How does that translate into " Thank you for providing an example. "?
---
So as an alpha or new player you can participate in the invasion and get decent rewards?
---
Sta kinezi sve tamane, pa si mislim da je prolly i ovo jestivo.
---
Riba mi izgleda ko Erebus iz eve online igre. XD
---
Pineapple is objectively a good topping on pizza. The snappiness is a nice contrast with the soft dough and cheese, and the acidity cuts through the strong, fatty flavors and compliments the tomato sauce.
---
Just because you don’t like pineapple, or because some idiot put cold pineapple on hot pizza, doesn’t mean it’s not a good topping
---
Needs more purple.
---
The best point about it that it takes forever (twice as long as a VNI nearly) to align so it's going to get caught even more often than a VNI.
---
Bullshit.
---
Snuff v Waffles karaoke contest
---
We could form a goddamn opera house with our angelic voices
---
I can't figure out if this is an elaborate troll or if you actually believe yourself.  You do realize to get the million SP you had to make 16/18 days, right?  Literally fucking impossible for you to miss a couple days and still have time to spare.... though the way the dating was done you would have thought so.
---
Enemies  cant find undock button, and its not our fault..
---
Mm.  Yep.  Good point.  And if NCdot would be so kind as to set all of their timers to the 6 hour window after downtime when Drifters are not active that would probably still work for them.
---
What are stacking penalties
---
Sent you the invite link.
---
We already have one Avery, Bob forbid they start reproducing
---
join eve univ to start with so they can teach you until you are good enough to do something else.
---
Keep the game simple and fun and dont risk isk/ships you cant afford to loose:)
---
1. Read the mission text very carefully  so you dont get stuck .
---
2. Never use Autopilot for transpoting good's
---
3. Dont fall for "Firesales" in Jita, Dodixie, Hek or Amaar
---
4. Dont buy Permits from players  those are Scam
---
5. system's with a 0.4 or lower are dangerous but also more rewarding  from isk standpoint
---
6. most importend dont let anybody say waht you have to do or not and play the game on your own speed
---
Look at those chompers! I would probably eat it to have teeth like those.
---
You can take one ddr off and add a reactor unit and then fit bigger guns but then it’s less afk. Not much else is very useful
---
Used to be you would just get mugged in the border systems by other players, and probably get to escape with your clone intact. But now everyone is getting fully murderated by hostile NPCs, something which has never happened before in EVE.
---
F
---
On discord? I don't have a msg.
---
HAHAH
---
What a shitfit
---
42 second align time? You might as well be ratting in a dread.
---
Yeah I stated a chat, check that.
---
Man, if it wasn't such a time sink...
---
We can always make the appropriate changes.
---
That's the spirit.
---
Still nothing, maybe you have to add me?
---
cocky hostile fleet was showing off during quiet time. someone manned the keepstar and blapped half their logis
---
you are just pissed that we fleet after fleet keep fucking you over in our munnins:)
---
So good to see all these tears. You are starting to look like the mittani :)
---
Sent it through regular message.
---
This whole drifters thing make me laugh way too much.
---
Wat
---
It is VERY much a thing in fw.
---
Sorry man thought you meant discord hahaha
---
Not familiar with pyfa? It’s counting it with an on.
---
the angle stronghold fort in m-o that kept getting junior fcs sent after it and nobody to follow up so it repped 3 times? lulW
---
there are a few huts left that had a few days on final timer that you guys didn't get to, but afaik that's the only structure larger than a hut that's still alive
---
I don't think it will work, it only goes like 66% as fast and has like 3x the sig radius. Maybe it's different in guristas space but i know that there were times where my VNI was barely holding after the sig nerf in sansha's space.
---
take off a dda and add a drone tracking mod
---
No problem, cheers.
---
I don't know why he's crowing about us thinking malpais is safe because it's so far away or whatever, the reason we think it's safe is because he literally said it was at the outset of the invasion when he said goons wouldn't follow us to the drones
---
Tried it to see. Didn’t work with a 10mn AB but held at 70% with the 100mn orbiting at 25 doing around 707m/s. (Gurisatas space, other areas your mileage may vary)
---
It does stand for something - Environment vs Environment. Capsuleers are just there to fill the void.
---
Will give it a try and see how much improvement it gives.
---
I'm just surprised he didn't manage to make someone at ccp bend the fucking knee using his flak cannon or some other tactic he read about in the prince or the art of war or something
---
this entire thing is dumb, your combining the afkness of drones and activeness of using guns,doing both poorly.
---
Old pic. Looks like Erebus
---
you want a hot tip???
---
Uninstall :D
---
Dictionary haven. Not EVE havens.
---
It might hold better with purgers instead of extenders in the rigs. Have you tried a nano instead of a 5th basically worthless DDA?
---
Pizza is a salty food. There is no place for anything sweet.
---
I hope you have a good drink, this is a small epic. 
---
On a quiet Saturday morning, I was scanning our wormhole chain because it hadn't been mapped yet. I always kept towers and force fields on D-Scan(this was well before Upwell) and noticed an offline pos, not uncommon either as people would anchor on every moon so you couldn't anchor a seige tower. I flipped my dscan settings to all and saw that the tower had SMAs and a XL SMA.
---
I was very excited to say the least, I was pinging who ever I could to come and help, because this hole belonged to a 300 man group and it wouldn't take long for them to react.
---
We purged it, we killed 40B in 5 minutes, and stole several capitals, we even had to call in lazersqawks to help remove the capitals.
---
I took a nicely fit Revelation for myself, but Sqawks closed the hole with the 3 caps as they left, and the Russians began to wake up. I then safe logged in a deep safe they had, and called it a day.
---
3 days later:
---
I log back in on my scan alt and begin finding a way for the rev to escape. They were all offline so I scanned the new hole and got ready to jump. As I did this, it seems they were waiting as combats probes appeared everywhere. Thankful I had a cloak on the rev(don't ask me why), so they didn't catch it. I shit talked local a bit and then I went AFK for a few hours leaving the rev cloaked as I didn't want to give away the safe.
---
When I came back at what would have been late night/early morning for them. I jumped out, without checking whose hole I was jumping into. Turns out I had jumping into TDSIN, not my greatest move, but they didn't notice me, at first. Cloaked in a safe, I scanned a new exit and got ready to jump, all clear and safe in the next wormhole.
---
As I was scanning, I kept an aye on DSCAN and saw a couple of DICs starting to enter and disappear. Nervous, I went afk again hoping they would go away, and it seemed to work! I jumped another hole and it seemed like a sneaky sabre pilot had been sleeping because as i entered warp, a bubble went up, missing me by milliseconds.
---
This revelation also had 2 warpcore stabs, so as long as it wasn't bubbled, it couldn't get caught by a typical sabre. This part is important in a second.
---
I went afk for a bit, heart racing but still excited. I came back again and found a lowsec hole and warped to it. That bloody sabre pilot was there, waiting. I don't know how long he had been waiting. Thank fully I landed in jump range and jump out to K-Space and start spamming warp. Sabre tries to tackle but fails due to no bubbles and only a long point.
---
I get to station safely and dock up, create a contract to firesale then go find my way to my home.
---
About 3 weeks later, I wake up to find a pos reinforced, and about 50 angry Russians reinforcing others. I ping every one, and even get Sqawks to come (they were happy because of the 3 caps they got). We gained hole control and got lazerhawks in. Then it came time for a brawl, but Sqawks couldn't help against the Typhoon fleet issues that they had Brought. We let them reinforce another and tried to trap them where we could, picking them off, 1 by 1.
---
We lost the wormhole in the end, but we had only started moving in a few weeks before, so nothing of value was really lost, and I was forever known by the corp for getting us evicted.
---
THANKS FOR READING 
---
TLDR: Found an offline pos in w-space, stole lots of stuff and a rev. Joy rode the rev through scary wormholes and sold it. Then got Corp evicted by the Revs previous owner.
---
Yep because sweet and salty isn’t a thing.
---
Fucking what?
---
If you don't see the irony of what you posted in response to my response to your post then me explaining it to you will only lead to more confusion. I'm truly sorry I decided to participate in your sperg. I'll see myself out. Be well.
---
It's not a popular opinion on this sub, but you're correct. The skill system is fucked, a huge barrier against entry, and like 7/9 people I've introduced to the game quit specifically because of the skill system.
---
That's so great. Made me really smile.
---
Crucify this heretic
---
Fitting pineapple into any slots is a bannable offense lol.
---
I mean it literally is a compliment to the flavors of pizza. Objectively.
---
154 ehp/sec with purgers, 120 with extenders but 20k less total ehp. 
---
Going to try an omnidirectional tracking link instead of the 5th dda.

Does not work when you are so ugly, noone can tell you, you are beautiful without bursting in laughter 1 sec afterwards. 🤣😂
---
It's time to start a nre crusade
---
I was passing through an invaded system and saw some Trig NPCs hanging around a gate next to Faction Navy / Customs NPCs. Shouldnt' they aggress each other?
---
The fuck is wrong with empire building? Why own ANY fucking space if you aren't going to make every damned cent from it? Why make money off of it if you aren't going to defend it? 
---
You are so fucking retarded. Just unsub and delete your reddit you cry baby bitch.
---
Why should they speak up if you're going to do it for them?
---
It's not any single player entity's fucking job to police the goddamn game against people who are breaking the rules. 
---
Racism lmao, who knew you'd throw that card in there too.
---
The first one was from my freighter days.  I had saved and saved for my first real freighter.  I then got on the waiting list for what seemed like months to join Red Frog.  Finally the happy day arrived and I got in.  Of course I had to go run a contract as soon as I could.  Was tooling back to Jita and got caught by gankers...on my very first contract the first time I undocked.  All I could do is laugh.  
---
The other time was years later I was running some random contract to Null for Black Frog.  Did not really do my ‘due diligence’ before go accepted it.  Was to I think NC staging.  I had never seen so many Titans and supers all parked within range of my jump freighter.  I was never so fast on my jump and dock commands at that day. :-)
---
Last one...I was a very new play messing around in Null looking for trouble.  I hit my D-scan and found my first Titan sitting in a POS.  Tracked it down and just looked at it in wonder.   Was pretty sure I was seeing something wonderful.
---
If we're speaking objectively, pineapple on pizza is just another attack on the traditions and values of our society and erroding the very concept of humanity. 
---
Anyone who would profess adoration for the clash of sweet and savory found within pineapple on pizza obviously has the palate of a subhuman and is most likely a contributor to the successful careers of Nickelback and John Mayer.
---
Second story: My first kill.
---
Jet can fliping, it was great stealing ores from miners, and then hoping they would either agro or steal the can back, letting you murder them.
---
I was flying a punisher and managed to get one. A Retriever with no drones, easy. Sat orbiting him for 10mins slowing killing him, it felt great.
---
A few days later after threats from him, me and my mate wardecced him 15 man Corp(when alts wernt so prevalent) and started kicking down their sandcastle, we cleared up a couple more barges, cleared off their haulers and then their POS.
---
The best part was they tried fitting XL weapons to kill our battle cruisers. But we killed them before the even went online...
---
Yeah, that and docking when a neut enters system, as if that's not the same fucking thing every ratter does everywhere, as directed by literally fucking everyone.
---
The forces are already split. Delve wasn't empty was it?
---
How have you guys gone through life without seeing or trying a fucking piece of salty chocolate? How don’t you guys know that pizza sauce is literally *sweet tomato sauce*??
---
Theres no reward to grinding structures in nullsec so why would they?
---
when a noob fits his first pvp ship.
---
Vexor not edible it a spaceship
---
Swap ALL the pineapples out for anything but pineapple
---
Sorry it's the best I can do while commenting on a baizou post on a Chinese platform without getting banned.
---
Total ehp only really matters if you are at risk of being alphaed before you get repped. Also consider a 2nd kinetic hardener instead of a cap battery. The guns on something like this are just wasted fitting as well.
---
Nah. I dont agree. The Asian play style heavily encourages grinding PVE.
---
Do those still exist?
---
I'm doing my best to not impune malice. Especially since that would kill EVE for real real.
---
Well, it is EVE after all. We do have the option to ignore the drifters and still shoot our neighbors
---
Frankly Id be terrified if someone told me i was a beautiful and a pair of glasses flew onto my face.
---
You make these claims as if they are gospel, unfortunately for you bud, you're completely incorrect. Comparing the taste of tomato sauce with that of baked/grilled pineapple falls flat on its face. Whereas tomato sauce naturally combines with the various tastes of meats and vegetables, creating an end product stronger than the sum of it's parts,  pineapple deliberately separates itself from the crowd much like an angst filled teenage hipster too cool to be associated with the rest of the class. 
---
No one cares pineapple, just go away.
---

I don't vote in US elections.  I'm from Europe.  But I would say the absolutely best thing about DT is he annoys all the right people.
---
keep dreaming
---
Ok troll, show me where I was anti-semitic?
---
I dont need any more tank for the rats, I could drop the battery and run an invuln as well and still be stable and have nothing in the highs.  The one I'm currently trying has med/small neuts in the highs, I'd guess my best bet is to neut out an inty tackler and warp off if I get a chance.
---
wait, you can still sig tank rats with 400 sig?
---
Again, you make false comparisons because you lack any factual arguments. 
---
Pineapple on pizza is Haram, stating otherwise just blatantly proves your low understanding of basic decency.
---
Dude, they blew up a jump gate, even if it's random which timers they show up to, they're still blowing up stuff.  
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/)
---
The factual argument is that the flavor profiles of pizza and pineapple compliment each other. Your “facts” were “it’s just bad”.
---
The neuts are a good idea imo.
---
Bro. Is this Windows XP?!
---
Goons do :D but yea, kill safety, make people actually evacuate
---
Cloak? Don't bother, just fit a second probe scanner so you can get the sites bookmarked faster.
---
People without could, oh wait, even pl has sov these days
---
You know that's not true. Only the hardest of the hardcore pvpers who already do it will plex for their isk to pvp with. If you have no home to return to to lick your wounds rebuild your forces and replace what you've lost its just a race to the bottom of if they will burn out or will their wallets bottom out first.
---
Join me in the unknowns of space travel and you will love this game.
---
Your 'factual argument,' is akin to telling me "Higher," by Creed is a good song, because reasons.
---
You have nothing to substantiate your beliefs and are obviously just trying to shill for Big Pineapple. Lobbyists such as yourself are a stain on civil discourse.
---
Now you’re just taking the piss
---
Corax?!
---
They're in the role bonuses for the hull
---
I like extra tomato sauce on my pineapple pizza.
---
If I were to do so on a pizza, it would arguable still taste better than pineapple.
---
It's almost like CCP made the benefits of having sov way too powerful, and should consider addressing that?
---
Hur hur hur
---
"we" as in CCP? Good luck, Drifters with upgraded AI coming june 2035...
---
no its your gay dad
---
Tip #1 uninstall it
---
Instead of YOU being a dumbass troll.  Give the guy some advice then ffs..
---
Next they'll be posting on /r/eve about how its totally not their fault that their team is getting so soundly beaten and it's like totally unfair dude they had more people you guys no seriously wait where are you going
---
My first time flying in a battleship. I had level 1 for every skill so couldnt use jack shit. Buddy of mine was carrying my dead weight ass in his domi? I think it was.
---
We almosy got my first battleship kill, and then an archon jumped in. I was so focused on trying to kill a domi in a small rail hyperion with nothing but tracking mods that i didnt even notice and went pop. It took until almost 4 months later and became a meme in just about every group i flew with until i quit playing.

Or the time when I was plus one and saw my first titan. A d second. And third. And 40th. Goon titan gate camp. Didnt know what they were and asked in mumble what an Avatar is and how do i get one. Proceeded to get doomsday'd in my talwar :(
---
This has the makings of an angry high school presentation 👌
---
I am not good with politics or if i actually know anything, but how did pl made money before having sov and being like red to everyone? Did they had renters?
---

---
Why make people evacuate?
---
I said it's an option, not a smart one, or the best one
---
oh hi viktor

EVE has been a dying game with a toxic community for 16 years. Probably be a dying game with a toxic community for another 16.

---
Not smartbombing in sansha space, lol.
---
dam right
---
The VNI is getting nerfed for ratting any time soon.
---
They owned shitloads of R64 PoSes all over the game that, because there was no jump fatigue, they could defend with their super fleet whenever they got attacked. In addition to this, they relied on mercenary contracts, and only provided SRP to their members whilst on a paid deployment.
---
Good vid, thanks.    
---
Like most folk, I'm looking for patterns they use that we might exploit to fight them effectively.
---
Oh you mean the blingy battleship smart bombers that roamers salivate at the thought of catching and killing? The ones that got very heavily nerfed? Yeah there isn't enough room in catch for a bunch of those.
---
Well today its this way: 
---
your structure is under attack, you go offline, safety does everything for you... 
---
In the past: your station is gonna be claimed, all your stuff is in danger that you cant retrieve it that easily, so you save it yourself or die trying, content
---
Your rust pennies are no good, 2nd class citizen.
---
If my tomato sauce is tasting extra sugary i'm sending that shit back.
---
Ummm ... but I thought NC. didn't have any citadels left?
---
Thats definitely the way it should be too. Plus there should be some benefits for attackers to bash structures
---
Take my arrow
---
Apologies.  I'm fighting in a completely different war.  Insert target enemy in place of NC.
---

Atypical story I suppose, I haven’t played for years and years. When I was playing, my primary character was a gallente pilot working toward a big beautiful drone boat. I wanted to PvP but was pretty shy and stuck to pve. Always in hi-sec. never had a stable income and once I afforded my fully kit myrmidon I was starting to become a bit bored of my eve life. 
---
I reached out to a small Corp to run PvP with and learn, usually outfitting little ships and running around looking for fights. Night after night it was just a long, fruitless endeavor.
---
So, to make some side income, I started an alt account which I made into a trading character. I slowly worked my way up to a providence and ran relatively safe station runs selling whatever I could fill my cargo hold with that would make some money. Nothing crazy, but I was starting to have a personal account of 1billion or so isk. For me that was a nice feeling.
---
After all these years though, and all of that, I remember fondly just cruising from far off station to far off station, listing to relaxing music and looking at all of the pretty space in the background. I don’t know how eve looks these days but 10 years ago it was damn beautiful. 
---
So I guess TLDR: I loved relaxing to music, watching planets and stars fly by, and comms chatter while bumbling around in my big blimp.
---
Good piloting!
---
I advocated an alliance wide building plan and support for our PvE folk after WWB when we saw what goons were doing.  
---
Wasn't listened to ... 
---
So, two thought here: 
---
(1) well done goons, good plan well executed.
---
(2) to all the alliance leaders that kept their collective heads in the sand and refused to listen to line members, you reap what you sow.
---
(3) grrr goons ... I still don't like you guys :-)
---
Tell them you think the person who made might be diabetic and to get checked out.
---
Stick to eating cake.
---
As quick as possible
---
Why is it that everyone else is having a tougher time with them (actually losing structures), but it is a Goon weakness?
---
GSF didn't have staging citadels rf'd
---
GSF didn't lose a jump gate
---
GSF already figured out the best way to defeat them without high effort fleets
---
So not sure if this meme is quite right.  Maybe replace the Bee with the EvE logo lol
---
[a premonition](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77529288/)
---
Flexing Your Erebus smh
---
No, they seem to hit the same systems, therefore, if the armor timer happened to be ready, it will appear they "formed" for it, when they are just attacking daily all of the systems structures and the armor timer happened to be there.
---
You've been covered in your own pineapple flavored piss since the start
---
Got some bad news for you: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c6o63t/apparently_the_drifters_are_not_following_up_on/
---
My argument is that among MMOs EvE is among very, veeeery few, where developers and GMs are not only interact and listen to their communities,  but aren't money-grabbing corporate drones that rule the world of game development.
---
It was empty of everyone that mattered, a few idiot who don't read pigs are hardly a defending force, also you said jump clones and alpha clones are great for killing bad alliances
---
What is that about anyway? His Zkill is confusing, it's shitloads of completely unfit ships.
---
And yet not one learned what Grath's favorite flavor of ice cream was.
---
Can confirm, Snuck Fuff
---
I'd love a soft cap to structure count. Put down more structures and the drifters come.
---
Do not join one of these.
---
Yes, I saw this. Makes me very sad. Maybe they were just testing the waters....
---
Amarrian Rockjaw, eh?
---
&gt;Now this thing is a beast of a creature, quite familiar with the interiors of Amarrian torture chambers, too. It has a rather sweet taste, with a fresh salty aroma to the flesh. You can have that at Dieurelli with a side of Achuran Songbird wings in a sweet nut-and-berry sauce. This meal, to anyone there who eats it, is unquestionably Amarrian. It is a tasteful, politically correct marriage of Empire-State cuisine. Perfect for high-profile business lunches you want to keep hiccup-free (depending on your clients, of course).
---
Don't think about joining another corp until you have a good understanding of what you want as a player, and do a little research into into what the corp you are thinking about joining is all about.

Ham's will have good DPS and application on other pizzas but you'll need a stasis ketchup in mids to be able to apply the DPS on anything smaller

If you are going to be hanging around in high sec in ventures with skins... you at least need to know about this... even if you don't like it.
---
I'm assuming you don't like Asian food?  Thai food in particular is basically defined by balancing salty/sweet/hot.
---
i wonder if instead of safely going to lowsec, if assets of a destroyed citadel went to the nearest enemy (attackers) citadel instead. 
---
as long as the enemy is willing to defend their forward staging citadel (or perhaps operate without one) they can deadzone the assets. long term that citadel would either be destroyed or unanchored and the trapped assets could possibly be retrieved in the future.
---
They get to enjoy a lot of salt on reddit, and it makes the price of goon doctrine ships a little higher and whatever the drifters drom suddenly increased in supply.
---
That's about it.
---
All credit to the guy who donated that money
---
Ah, yes. If I recall correctly, my first encounter with a supercarrier - a Nyx; in fact I think it's STILL the only one I've seen - also ended with a smartbomb. It was fun, that time period. The battle for 9UY4-H and surrounding space in September 2006, in particular. I actually left the corp/alliance I was in in order to participate and help U'K, with whom I'd flown for a bit before joining that corp.
---
They’re all millionaires and plexed
---
Been in DHSJ, can confirm autism is at high levels :p
---
Lowsec is dangerous, fuck snuff.
---
they recruited titan pilots. back then titan pilots were good at eve and didnt need to mine to make ISK.
---
Good troll.
---
is fun.
---
Pro tip swap out a couple mid slots for some jalapenos and you will be unstoppable
---
No... you used to fly around a stationary troop and got a sense for the real potential scale of the game. Now you complete some generic rpg quests and get trinkets.
---
Should have had them hit low power stuff
---
I can dream ... don't take my dreams away  :-0

There are some in k-space that know of his blessings, and many more that fear his coming.

Well can you at least whine endlessly about how things were so much better in $\_YEAR before CCP ruined $\_IMBALANCE ?
---
Because that is the only SOTA we ever get? All the others are usually "move there shoot that" or simple pings "fleet up".
---
They got all the XL and most of the L structures.

---
What is the point of having rails if you want to AFK on it? They won’t hit anyone tackling you anyway.
---
In addition to the eve University wiki that some people linked, I'd recommend joining a moderate sized group that fires your interests. Eve is a big game so find an activity that interests you and drill down into it.
---
What keeps you logging in? What do you find fun?
---
True. Prob better to have more neuts.
---
You forget that wormholers want to see their shit burn. And Steve is an old friend... if he wishes to claim some loot if his own, we’ll welcome him with open arms.
---
Good, I want it see it all burn down! Reset this nullsec and let smaller alliances roam it's space and prosper. Let all the big coalitions and their massive amount of assets perish by our Drifter overlords. I said it 2 months ago that this game needs a genocide event and looks like I got my wish.
---
No, Ii mean the krabbing points. This must be some kind of joke, right?
---
Prices are going up in some marketd as people are losing ships raw materials seem to be going up slightly also.
---
No.
---
Let me work out what they've changed since I played and I'm sure I can do that for you.
---
how well do those rails hit inty tacklers orbiting you at 6k m/s?
---
Who would have thought, Mittens is shit at this game?
---
You need crust in the low slots and a cheese in a high slot.  Otherwise I 100% approve of pineapple glory.
---
It is still one person sitting behind keyboard, and running two different Ops on two different comms is not feasible , not to mention that it is not technically possible to run alpha and omega accounts at the same time if required.
---
I have no idea what any of this means.
---
He logs in approximately once every 6 months.  Someone should kick him for inacctivity.
---
Samantha Fox ?
---
Can you buy me a 30 day pilot's license? 😁😁🦇🦇
---
Yup, same. I might be dirt poor as liquid isk wise but I have a huge amount of assets at my disposal that could arm a small alliance to the teeth. So instead of troll bombing I'll be rallying the troops to fight the drifter menace.
---
I used 2 different printers for this, just to see which mechanism worked best.
---
The Creality CR-10 S5 was the less great option. The parts are too big, they move and judder too much with the bed and gantry all in motion at the same time. Turning the speed of everything down would make this take months to print.
---
The Creality Ender 5 was what I got most of this ship printed with. The bed is a static drop type, the gantry does all the remaining movement. So the large parts are relieved of almost all print head shaking. Everything is very stable and the printing produces almost no artifacts.
---
As this was a test print I dropped the speed to 25 and 30% to see if there were any snags, strings or blobbing (there weren't), and dialled up to 125 and 150% to see if high speed caused detachment, collisions or loss of resolution (it didn't).
---
I'd recommend the Ender 5 without hesitation. Worked great for me.
---
The S5 needs a lot of custom printed upgrades, but has potential to be great. But it's definitely a tinker's paradise.
---
Hope this helps you 😁
---
What's inside a drifter wreck? Anything valuable?
---
Ha, wonder what all the unfit ship loses are about.
---
Thank you 😁
---
normally yes, the ones spawned by this event no
---
^ this, befriending you when you have 5 isk to your name then stealing all your shit when you a trillionaire is eve 101. Never trust anyone! Except me, I can help you out if you want &lt;.&lt; .... &gt;.&gt;
---
Thanks 😁
---
Credit to the chefs though.
---
Happy to take donations for a metal printer. About a billion should do it.
---
I killed two explorers at the same time. One of them was a Twitch streamer who was being unnecessarily salty and petty on my streams, so I reciprocated and hunted him and another player for about an hour. Met them in a Relic site, grabbed them both with my Astero, killed one at a time. I never felt more powerful in all 7 years I've played this game.
---
Nah this is a little more than being shit though. It's a bit odd. Why would he lose so many completely unfit ships around the same time.
---
I respect the effort you're putting into a bad joke.  o7
---
&gt;Nemesis
---
or long point tomatoes and low-fat cheese for a nano-pizza? :P
---
Nice vid... How do you make the vector circles?
---
I mean, sure, you can suicide with destroyers, or, you can do it right by properly fitting your citadels.
---
There’s a large amount of us that would rather watch the world burn than team up.
---
was just a bit of fun.
---
no cheese?! HERETICS!!!!!
---
It's far more than 3 systems per region, try 20+
---
I think you may be underestimating the realities wormholers live with every day.
---
While I can’t say for certain what will happen, I can say fore sure what won’t happen: Babyrage from an alliance leader.
---
Or, you can take off all the guns like a normal person and run strictly drones.
---
It is meant to be a cheap, throwaway, ratting ship. You make your ISK back extremely quickly so if you do get caught, it is no big deal, reship and carry on. Not only are the guns not going to save you, but you are only increasing the cost to replace without making the site end any faster.
---
What is this fun you speak off
---
That's what a racist says! 😂
---
We used to feed the drifters. Find which gate they were on and eject bodies for them. Was hoping they would leave something behind for us. Well at least they haven't shot our structures yet. So we got that going for us, which is nice.
---
OP sounds salty.
---
You'll know you've had enough when you have to pee every hour and your blood has turned to razor soup, shredding your kidneys into a fine pulp.
---
Are we fitting cheese stretch reppers?
---
How did CCP get hold of that Nyx? Was it built in game or did they just magic it in?
---
To be honest, when in Detorid, You do get some free kills and you guys are really bunch of weirdos, I mean who is ratting in 10 VNIs. I was just sitting next to one of your "bots" I reported him, then I wrecked him. Then I just sat next to MTU and wait for the wave of catalysts separated by 1min and 30 seconds that tried to salvage the wrecks... Thx for free kills thou. 
---
The sad part is. That I would need a bot to kill a bot, so it would robots fighitng each other to actually imply any damage, because I cant be online 24/7 to babysit your VNIs and wreck them, the moment I am gone you will replace the damage I have done in like 2 hours of ratting...
---
You honestly expect the idiots losing Supers and Rorqs in Delve to protect it? You are a special kind of stupid.
---
It's no longer the best isk/hr when you cash out at 800 isk/lp rather than 3k
---
All things Im sure they considered when deciding to make an alpha army
---
short answer: no
---
long answer: no, don't be stupid why would this change anything
---
According to CCP Alpha: it was taken away from botters, with all the fitting. So, no cheating here.
---
Because of the goon salt
---
For anyone out of the loop: This was just a fun little mess around in BWF, I guess a CCP dude wanted to join them in dying - [iBeast lost an Erebus](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77534243/) and [Bjorn Bee lost a Rorqual](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77533567/)
---
This is a terrible fit.
---
So, are they gonna build an arsenal with confiscated ships and every big brawl and teleport themselves in?
---
I've reached out to goon diplomats, it seems you're correct in this regard that delve appears to be target much more heavily than other regions, regardless of population density.  I'll update the thread with findings once I have hard numbers.  Thanks for the correction
---
Never
---
Jesus with this much salt you can destroy the whole ecosystem of the planet.
---
That looked like a fun little event tbh - the Erebus had a good run and ended up lasting ~2h in BWF and getting ~120 kills
---
Good times, props iBeast
---
As long as hy isn't in the meta show it sucks ass anyway.
---
Do not ever fly over Italy with this.
---
What the fuck does that say? HBURICB?
---
Since when was a NYX 10bill for the hull?
---
They obviously won't. It was just a one time event organized by Lussy Lou.
---
Imagine getting a Hawaiian pizza without any cheese.
---
That’s Les Grossman in Drifter form.
---
How does this herald a new age of PvE? It serves as a expansion limiter by pressuring nullsec corps to defend what they have already. Theoretically providing more room for other alliances/coalitions.
---
that's the spirit!
---
You can thank the Imperium for that.
---
Delve prices mate
---
There's no Pepperoni, hence it cannot be called a "pizza" but Italian flat bread with stuff
---
I would think a seasoned SA veteran would understand this reference, or at least be able to google it to fucking figure it out.
---
Perhaps I was wrong, and you are just fucking stupid, mlyp.
---
I've got two that will always stick with me. 
---
1. As a pretty new player, one of our POS's was being hit in NPC null where we lived, by a larger group. They had committed a good number of dreads and carriers. I was told to bomb the fighters and drones that were being used by them, whilst help was being summoned. 
---
Eventually a fleet was only a jump out to kill them, the dreads had desieged and a hero sabre had got a bubble onto their entire fleet, trapping them.
---
I had a single bomb left, and as fighters and drones swarmed the sabre, i followed my instructions to the letter, releasing my last load I killed dozens of drones. Unfortunately I also killed the bubble and watched all the caps warp off as the kill fleet landed.
---
A massive noob mistake, luckily I didn't catch too much grief as I was doing as I'd been asked and simply didn't know any different but it always stuck with me as a reminder that noobs don't always understand consequences.
---
2.  We found a corp in a C1 or 2 using a pair of Archons. We promptly trapped them into their POS, and took hole control. 
---
Unfortunately as the timer came out in EUtz, I was left alone to maintain control and burn the POS down, then maintain bubbles.
---
What followed was four hours of me negotiating through google translate with a Japanese corp an acceptable ransom whilst stopping them repairing the POS and mods, and keeping on top of the holes with only a single alt and continuing to bash the POS down. 
---
A very long and stressful day, but one I was richer by at the end of it!
---
woah sir. that was truly epic, gave me goosebumps. One upvote to you
---
There are micro transactions! Skins and shit! CCP are basically EA, lets kill them all.
---
tits
---
Jesus christ.. CCP needs to sort this shit its ridiculous
---
Can you link the original comic
---
Our corp and alliance fly mainly Gallente stuff
---
So what's the story here ?
---
Was it charity suicide, nbsi fleet .... what ?
---
Devs hate Goons. Who knew? :D
---
Suicide just to get fight =P
---
People are going to blame their risk aversion to fighting a large entity and blame it on not being able to contest it. Its only now that their large enemy has as many super caps as they do are goons now “too big to fight”.
---
When the n+1 on supercaps was in their favor, goons and the imperium were told to use dreads or drop supers. Pretty entertaining. You shouldn’t come crying to a subreddit full of risk aversion for any kind of satisfactory resolution on that front.
---
It's almost like they knew players would be able to quickly figure out how to slaughter the drifter fleets efficiently, and rather than make the fleets more interesting and rewardinf with a bigger investment on their end into the mechanic, they elected to stir up 72 hours of memes and ign articles at the same time as a Plex sale and (they hoped) directly buyable SP.
---
Sure, but it's still infinite. People like to meme about how you can pack an infinite number of people into sov nullsec, but the limits definitely do exist. Missions lack these limits entirely.
---
Don't join those ones. Try a FW corp first, you will get a better understanding of how to fly your ship and how to engage FAR better than with any null block groups
---
I would think it would have been pineapple and ham in the highs, cheese in mid slots, and sauce for lows with dough rigs to make sure the crust is substantial enough to hold up all the toppings.
---
Good work!
---
Disappointing that they don't follow up on timers. What's the point of them if they don't?
---
Had so much fun on this fleet. Thanks fc.
---
omg, you will whisper "No." - i think all of serenity player base will now be in fear...
---
PL members are generally high IQ successful people IRL and therefore they are able to afford a plex here and there in between Lambo payments.
---
Only thing I can think of is that Drifters need Spod, and are trying to burn out the competition.
---
haha, I thought it was common knowledge who I used to be :)
---
Glad to hear you and fun and got some good mentoring from some of my dudes though, that makes me feel good! :D &lt;3
---
login numbers if I had to guess.  What better way to get people to log in than making you think your infrastructure will die if you don't?  If you don't kill the drifter fleets they might eventually happenstance on a timer and kill a structure probably, so you have to do it still.
---
Thanks, was fun y’all!
---
I havent tried the stuff myself but at lest one community which runs the triglavian stuff uses ship fits which should also work for alpha. So, yes, alphas can participate. For the secodn part it probably depends what you call decent.
---
A joint thing with CCP, I believe. CCP Alpha was there in a Nyx as well.

It was so much fun lmao, 4/5 different fleets all shooting eachother and people not paying attention getting bozond lmao
---
Good shit
---
&gt;They didn't - because they want to incentivize people to rush out and give them some more cash right at the end of the month.  This is marketing 101 my friend, and if you're too naive and gullible to see it, that's your problem.
---
DISGUSTING    
---
take my upvote
---
&gt;The end result, is [...] already solved
---
Careful. This is something that most of these folks don't want to hear. Words like this will shatter their fragile hope that the, er, we'll call it "problem" will be resolved without any effort on their part.
---
I like the idea of helping others, but there's ZERO commentary written or verbal so how are we to learn, "the basics?"  Add that everyone has different music tastes which is why professional videos (especially those with the intention to teach) do not use any music.

I get my internet by mailing flash drives back and forth with my ISP

cant be amaar, its heresy, could be a blood radier ship
---
Thanks Lussy for the content, always nice to see you doing stuff like that without a 100+titan backup like others do.
---
I4m just sad ppl would not play fair in the end and neut the erebus so it could not DD anymore :'( 
---
Come on, just for the show , that would have been nice !

Applies only when not said by goons when people cry about their fleets?

You can headshot an incursion tho

This post right here is why.

you just wait. there are way more carebears in EVE than you might realize

According to goons, the drifters were a bad alliance, not a serious threat though

Idk, goons say it only takes some t1 destroyers.
---
Not my fault goons are that bad that t1 destroyers are too hard.
---
This subreddit ain’t big enough for the two of us.

Ere-fish
---
Is it worth dropping a pineapple in the mid slot for that?
---
Literally everything CCP does anymore seems to be rooted in login metrics.
---
It's more that j space should feel empty and mysterious. 
---
If every time you go through a hole it's "well let's see what fleet is just sitting on the other side and if I can get away from the tackle" 
---
A packed chain would be shitty. Having dead chains are useful for krabing and logistics.
---
i'm failing to see what that has to do with anything

Horde FC here, copying my AAR from Horde Discord.
---
Was playing the long dark when I got some pings that there was a titan and nyx on the way to Oij. Spoke with allies briefly, and began forming jackdaws, but reformed when we found that most of the people within 3 regions were forming. Pinged for ferox, and got ourselves on the gate grid. Started out with Muninns and Nightmare fleets on the gate, so I hung out for a bit until we got most of our numbers. Warped in, and started by fragging nightmares. Got a good chunk, then switched to muninns. Tried to clear the grid as much as possible, had a bit of fun warping around to frag muninns. After a bit too much fun, I did get the tail end of my fleet bombed a wee bit. Regrouped, had people reship, then went back in to brawl.
---
Rastino formed an overflow fleet. Darkness brought AF, Harpies, and Jackdaws. Goons brought some bombers, Init had a stuka fleet. Siege Green was there in brought a Muninn fleet, Init brought one as well. It was a big old brawl. After we ended up holding the field for a bit, bad guys buggered out, and we started taking down FAX. Had to do some target switching to find the ones that were stuck in triage, but once we started getting them down, the rest fell in short order.
---
Started shooting the Nyx, and Senor Trousersnake got ready to bring in the big guns. Goons brought in Focused Void Torp bombers, and got a good run on the 3 remaining caps on grid. Afterwards, we free fired on them, so we didn't have to worry about them turning on our caps that we planned on dropping once the subcap fight was done. Fragged Bjorn, but only because he was taking out our HICs keeping them on field. Swapped back to the nyx afterwards, and cleaned up. Nyx went down, Titan was next. Helped clear a friendly dread that got tackled by harpies, watched the cap fleet get home safe, and stood down, with +1 titan killmail to horde.
---
BR tool is absolutely fucked atm, but it was a 220B Brawl on the Oij gate, and 2+ hours of fun for everyone.
---
Huge shout out to Lussy Lous, Bjorn, /u/ccp_alpha , and all the other FC's who came to give us a grand brawl. Good Fights all around.
---
Even drifters had their share of feroxes and ospreys...
---
iBeast wanted to use/lose his titan and we collaborated to create an event together for all the players and viewers.
---
Bjorn Bee and Streamfleet provided their support on short notice as well, to have an English language stream alongside ours and to not let us die to rapid caracal fleets :) :) :)
---
 You're such a fucking liar. Nobody outside of a misguided group of people in the US think that he is anything more than a narcissistic man-child. Europeans certainly don't quote alt-right propaganda. Trying to disassociate yourself from the group to try to look unbiased certainly doesn't lend any more credibility to your claims. It actually makes you look more like a coward. As much as I disagree with the people who support him, at least they have the courage to own up to their beliefs.
---
All the bitter vets who are installing will be back in a few months anyways. Eve has that special way it holds you and no matter how hard you try you just can't get away.
---
Yay its all updated and ready.
---
Now that is a pizza
---
TBH, it would have been nice if Panfam or at least another fairly hostile entity embraced the culture of 'the industrialist is the heart of the Alliance' doctrine. Other than Test who aren't all that hostile, we're the only lot around that have embraced this winning plan and are up against entities that still stupidly sneer at Empire Building...
---
And not choosing pineapple is the worst life decision you can make.
---
Almost all fleets avoid boson well. Actually he got only few kills from it.
---
They are a group of individuals who are lead by James 315 and they are the savior's of highsec from bit and bit supporting players
---
Was most likely the most retarded idea to go to a staging system of a block for such an event
---
Or more like they didn't want to make them loot pinatas until they saw how players were able to manage them.
---
Not all goons think this is terrible
---
Possibly due to density of structures in space?
---
I don't think they're at that point with the AI. More of a limitation I would say than a lack of desire.
---
I’m pretty sure the sauce is not part of the hull and must be added on as a rig slot
---
This is horrible.

Also, don't be poor and use an Ishtar.

SNUFF is a proud mining alliance. Our rorq-fleets shall endarken the skies above every lowsec moon.
---
Rejoining the game after a deployment looking to join a 0.0 alliance only to be scammed by Test Alliance and not allowed to join. I almost quit playing again. 
---
I came back looking to join any semi-large 0.0 alliance having really enjoyed nullsec before my break. I didn't really know anyone in eve besides some CVA guys and didn't care for npsi. I was initially turned down by Goonwaffe because I had no SA account and saw a post for Test.
---
So I hit the Corp up and they said I was a bit new to 0.0 but could try. After about a week (only had one month vacation so that's quite a long time sitting in the house not knowing what to do after working 9 months straight) I hadn't been accepted and was told they were just reviewing me. So I started talking to another Test Corp and was told sure I could join. Low n behold a day later they both approached me saying surely I must be a spy since I was trying to join any Test Corp. I explained my situation and was told fine if I wanted to join put my stuff up on contract to staging. I only had a Navy Apoc, some mods of no value, and corpses (no alt accounts either).
---
I was ignorant of eve scams back then and didn't think anything of it. The next day they said basically fuck you spy thanks for the stuff your denied. I was heartbroken and stopped playing for a few days. 
---
When I came back I watched recruitment for a while before giving it one more shot. I had all of 80mil to my name and my current Corp accepted me. I swore to fuck over Test any chance I got till the end of time after that. 
---
So far I got to take part in evicting them from Fountain (6vdt of course) , Delve, baiting some titans/ super in esotaria for one of the few successful goon tackles on titans, and who knows in the future. Fuck Test forever.
---
Well if you don't defend it, whose to say other players won't show up to knock it over? I think it's a good effort to try to make some engaging content, but all players can seem to want to do with anything is figure out the best way not to have to do anything or do the least amount.
---
&gt;"  I did get the tail end of my fleet bombed a wee bit "
---
slight understatement, we got a hell of a lot of you in that bombing run, GF though Welp squad enjoyed it
---
Yeah that's [working out well](https://i.imgur.com/9lc7im8.png) so far.
---
Or don't be shit. Use a Gila or Ishtars.
---
We aren't using T1 destroyers lol. 
---
Well, some guys are, but they are just doing ut to do something. There are much better and faster alternatives.
---
Never denied it. 'A wee bit' does, in fact, account for the 60+ feroxes that ceased to exist. Was a good run; I was too slow on my HIC bubble, and wasn't in a good position to call free fire on bombers, and y'all capitalized on it.
---
You're right. So retarded to give 600+ people 2 hours of quality content and shiny killmails. I'm sure you would have done it better. Take it one gate, dock up? Elite.
---
&gt; so you save it yourself or die trying, content
---
Why do I get this feeling everyone remembers all those structures ending like C-J and 6VDT, happening a lot more often than they did?
---
meh. I was bored. reddit pvp is alot more interesting when you refuse to carry the water for our semitic overlords.  gf 7o
---
Ever had chocolate covered pretzels? Sweet and salty flavors go together beautifully.
---
I think you're just a food bigot
---
oh, so you dont use your ab while ratting?
---
And you suddenly grew facial hair
---
tl;dr: I don't know how or why they spawn, how many of them spawn, or where they spawn, but they warp and shoot stuff at random once they do. Grr event bad.
---
Imo it would make sense if they were targeting based on production/ economic activity, since Delve stands out in that respect a lot. (Would make sense for an invasion to try and cripple where resources are produced the most too, so lore wise it fits)
---
I said that its a band aid fix to issues in eve like citadel spam and super proliferation, turns out its actually not even a band aid
---
I smell bot-script(ing)...
---
It happened to me once or twice as well, but was not associated with TiDi. What helped (without relogging) was jumping to another system.
---
The first time I jumped into low sec. I was showing my brother this cool game I'd started playing and was casting around Jouvulen in my Venture looking for a belt that hasn't been mined out so I could demonstrate its mining capabilities. Wasn't able to find any and was looking at the map. My brother pointed at an orange dot and said "what about there?" I told him it was dangerous and he was like "It's a game, what could happen?"
---
I think the orange dot was Mara, and I escaped the gate camp with my Venture trailing smoke and flames. They must not have been on the ball.
---
That episode sticks out as much as my first 1v1 kill, a Tormentor that I killed in a Slasher about 6 months later.
---
Change your views between orbit and tactical camera, spam the shit out of them back and forth till it fixes itself. Alt-1 and Alt-2 I believe are the hotkeys if you don't want to click, and if you do want to click it's the 3 buttons left of the capacitor on the hud
---
So? He doesn’t make the rules. He’s not god.
---
I dont understand why it's mandatory. If they dont return to bash your structures then why go kill the fleet?
---
Hy vs vily is entertaining for sure
---
Holy shit, didn't know Pineapple needed so much power
---
Schrodinger's event: Both toothless but also mandatory at the same time.
---
This is just a very thinly veiled "ccp bad" thread.
---
Damn it, I forgot that CCP shuts down every other system in eve every saturday.
---
No anchovies, no fleet.
---
When SC dropped a rag on my mega on my first fc attempt. Yeah stockholm syndrome i guess.
---
/r/CopyPastas
---
talking to some peeps and they seem to be very pissed the difters drop nothing while they have to fight infinite waves of them across many systems. 
---
Looks like the drifters have already won this war of exhaustion.
---
It's almost like everyone throwing a tantrum about jump fatigue has some other reason besides it hampering "good fights"
---
Heh, and keep in mind the amount of bots that log in daily.
---
I don't mind fighting a big npc battle if there is a chance to win and generates content and a sense of accomplishment and bragging rights, but if CCP plans to actually wipe null sec sov clean completely, then why fight a battle that you are guaranteed to lose? It's going to be interesting as this event develops.
---
Yeah, in general I've always been in favour of Jump Fatigue, although it was undoubtedly far too harshly implemented originally. I'm disappointed that CCP cucked out by not giving Ansiblexes some level of Jump Fatigue, as maintaining a large empire is no longer something that's punished, as it was previously.
---
&gt;Change your views between orbit and tactical camera, spam the shit out of them back and forth till it fixes itself. Alt-1 and Alt-2 I believe are the hotkeys if you don't want to click, and if you do want to click it's the 3 buttons left of the capacitor on the hud
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks
---
Security levels are fixed. Nothing changes them.
---
sadly, jumping back and forth between systems did not work
---
because eventually they might, and nobody want's to roll a d100 on a fortizar timer.  So you have to deal with them but they're not a threat if you do even a little.
---
Lower security the better makes  you make more isk.
---
Both of which are a lot more expensive for minimal isk increase. 
---
Ishtars are great tho don’t get me wrong, I will be using them when I am slightly less afk. Even managed to get a 100% afk kill of an idiot in a Loki with an afk-Ishtar one once.
---
Ah like hunting expensive afk ships eh?
---
/u/bjornbee [https://clips.twitch.tv/BoredLovelySangKevinTurtle](https://clips.twitch.tv/BoredLovelySangKevinTurtle) made me smile :)
---
This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen CCP do. Its all just a massive waste of time.
---
These days even NCPs will blueball you
---
In before they get spotted running NPC Sotiyos
---
Yes. But turn it off to warp out. So even considering slowing down it still works out quicker
---
"Officially" I think that's a no, as wasn't he permabanned?
---
They do
---
Yeah, figured it would be like this.
---
Also, it is a sad state of a affairs that people were actually excited that a pve content could "shake up the null meta".
---
Hmmm, well this month he had a couple hits on zkill and in Jan lost loads of ships.
---
This whole thing has me interested but I don't think a first time player like me would be able to handle it atm lol
---
1. System Security will (-0.5/0.0/0.6 etc) won't change.
---
2. Sov-Changes (Capturing-/Loosing Systems) only occur in the designated Low-Sec Systems. But You can still fight with the enemy War militia in Highsec.
---
3. Nullsec-Systems can get captured by an Player Alliance (not corporation). The Security Status is also Fixed here. In Nullsec you tend to live in system with a low Security Rating (-1.0) because they have more and better Signatures.
---
I have a decent character rn, in storage. But yeah, it does seem pretty intense
---
generally when snuff isn't doing something on a fleet level and/or don't have tau/hy involved they're fine. Its not super hard to discern when to not engage with their kbs and corps, and yeah eventually they will get you in a bait but meh.
---
in general avoid engaging those corps in solo/small gang:
---
adversity
---
elitist ops
---
LNAW
---
i'd say avoid SASH too, not necessarily because they're dangerous(lmao devoter corp) but because there is a risk of them speaking in local and you don't want to read that, trust me.
---
Snuff did get markedly less pirateish after bulking up the last few months, but theres still some of them there no doubt.
---
You will never have such fun. Jump in both feet matey
---
It's like someone went into the hospital with a gunshot wound and they got treated for brain cancer.
---
Like CCP would risk pushing anyone out of their comfort zone.
---
I'm in null and yet to see a drifter. Lotta fuss about nothing vov. Don't let it put you off.
---
Oh sweet. Okay, thanks
---
Posting in a grr ccp thread
---
ok?
---
I do not enjoy "hunting" ratting ships in NS. At all.
---
Build something silly in Pyfa and do shenanigans. The most fun I have had in this game has been from just going out there and not giving a shit about the outcome.
---
i tried it once for RP reasons. it was supposed to be a Minmatar corp but i had at least one or two members from other factions with a title to excuse it like "embassator", "asociate" and the like. so the corp was focused on Minmatar characters but we had one member of other race joining as a contracted individual due to lack of workforce.
---
i got bored of it since i couldnt find many minmatar players around. people will just roll Amarr or Caldari due to having the biggest trade hubs right on their backyards, not saying Hek or Rens are too far from the matari starting systems but still, not many people will settle to work on the republic when Amarr and Jita exist. even Dodixie has better retention.
---
i may start the project again but as i said, it was for RP reasons so there's not much personnel to work with.
---
Can I have your stuff!?
---
System cynojam was lame af, dread brawl blueballed
---
If I've never played EvE before...is it 'too late' now? It feels like it's take make 6months to a year just to get to a mildly competitive point.
---
Thoughts?
---
Don't worry about it, the drifter thing only really affects alliance level things, and not individuals doing their thing. Also, if you join a wormhole group (wormholer btw) you'll get used to your drifter neighbors quickly :)
---
YOU GAVE ME CPR FOR A BULLET WOUND IN THE HEAD??!?
---
I mean it's a valid criticism, I think boiling it down to "CCP bad" is disregarding the effort it took to organize this information. The invasion's just begun a couple of days ago, give it more time to ramp up before making a final assessment
---
"Savannah"
---
And then got more cancer
---
What information though? If you read it again carefully, literally all his points boil down to "We/I don't know how this works". He's just structured it in a way that looks like he actually knows what he's talking about.
---
Much like....eve
---
The tin-foil hat is strong with this one.
---
So if I see someone being mugged in broad daylight I should just keep walking because 'it's the cops' job'?
---
Flying solo generates much buttmad.
---
Samantha Carter
---
Are you still going?  There's more to life than "winning" an argument on Reddit.  Go outside and see what the sun (or, heaven forbid, girls!) looks like.
---
The drifters didn’t actually do anything of consequence.
---
Observation is still information. A comprehensive collection like this is the beginning of looking for trends, patterns or curves. That's the basis of intel.
---
I'm actually super disappointed that their logic is all randomly generated, if your research is correct. I would have thought that CCP would at least want to add some layers to the logic, given how much work they've been putting into the emergent AI for the last few years.
---
CCP should spawn those drifters more frequently and make them drop more loot
---
Like, make the drifters capable of disrupting local ratting/mining activities and force local residents to either switch system or form a response fleet while give people that aren't total krabhead some actual benefit for wasting time on drifters
---
Given what we've heard so far of their behavioral development, I would say if they were able to warp on grid with them they would engage them. The massive battle that nobody knew happened is a good example. You're programming in responses to conditions. Depending on how narrowly or widely you define the conditions, they could lead to unanticipated responses. Doesn't mean they are bad, you just didn't analyze your logic as it pertained to all possible conditions.
---
Only time will tell, hopefully the servers last long enough for that to happen.
---
They better follow the Dark Ochre rule or they're gonna get reported.
---
I would love if these things targeted belts where rorqs were mining, or jumped ratting carriers.  PVE mechanics interrupting other PVE mechanics sounds kind of cool.  It's when mandatory PVE detracts from optional PVP that there becomes a problem.
---
They should have rubbed aloe vera on the neck.
---
No just saying game and family. How the hell do people do it
---
Awww :( would've been fun
---
I'll give the drifters a little credit, sometimes they do really funny things.  One time they camped a JB they were reinforcing and killed a ship that jumped through.  One fleet in detorid broke up a gatecamp, killed 3 bubbles, and then warped off.  That kind of shit is hilarious, but it's the smallest percentage of what they do.
---
If you want to conserve traditions, then any pizza besides Margherita should be banned. As that is the original traditional Italian pizza...
---
Also, don't forget to only make and est pizza following the guidelines in "Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana" or you will further ruin the tradition of pizza making.
---
It is information only if you go by the dictionary definition of it, in which case this equally useless comment chain also fits the criteria.
---
Saying "drifters seem shoot random shit" is about as far away from useful intel you can get.
---
control of the ships themselves in combat does appear to be fairly novel and dynamic - they have logi, they target swap, they are effective enough that fighting them with subcaps is a poor idea
---
Shout-out to all FAX pilots.
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
o7
---
Stupidly I had more fun messing around EFT/Pyfa than playing the game
---
A month of drifter attacks that will destroy everything in NS and make all people move in LS?  
---
Kind of a soft reset..that would be awesome, or really bad, i don't know. :D
---
Yummy! Hawaiian pizza is so good. Im really surprised that a lot of people don’t like it &gt;.&gt;
---
Funny how the player base bitches about a lack of PVP content, then Goons go and start a major war and everyone is overjoyed when we have to go home early to deal with some sandbox destroying PVE bullshit. 
---
No wonder CCP can't deliver any good content; their own playerbase has no fucking idea what it actually wants.
---
400 Sig this is dream come true
---
Rest in piece pinky toe. YOU WILL BE AVENGED.
---
I appreciate your criticism, considering you've brought nothing to the table but that criticism.  Go away.
---
yeah man it's so sad that instead of a 20 minute dread f1 fight we got a 2 hour subcap brawl featuring tons of repositioning and 8 different subcap fleets 
---
what a shame
---
That's a whole lotta perfect if situations.
---
Eve players today don't care about the sandbox. They want everything spoonfed to them, including PVP apparently.
---
&gt; dude you can make so much more, in lowsec if you know what you are doing and without taxes haha
---
you can say that about literally all areas in the game, nullsec included.
---
I was joking. But yeah I’ve got perma wife aggro until after 7-8pm usually if I even get close to opening EVE lol. The good thing is they take lots of naps and sleep in in the morning. :) use the sleep to your advantage.
---
Good write up, Dran.
---
One comment is that just because they're not showing up for timers now doesn't mean they won't later.
---
&gt;[honestly if i were in charge of goons i would have carried on in the north at least until a week or so until you had some data on how consistently the drifters follow up on timers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c5yojs/z/es5pdu1)
---
what astute reasoning you have there mittens; "we have to take our supers home to defend against the drifters that don't follow up on timers"
---
"Drifters spawn randomly or something idk lol"
---
There, I brought literally as much new info to the table as OP did. Only a complete idiot would consider that to be new or useful.
---
This is probably more likely, tbh.
---
 ༼ つ ◕.◕ ༽つ DRIFTERS TAKE MY MEAT ༼ つ ◕.◕ ༽つ
---
I've already said it twice in here, but its painfully clear now that the current playerbase doesn't give two fucks about the sandbox or going out and finding their own meaningful PVP or putting any effort into actually playing the game. They want CCP to play the game for them with spoonfed PVE instances. Fucking WOW in space.
---
Everyone was ecstatic when they thought it was just Delve getting nuked.
---
Afaik FCs were not that retarded to deny content with dreadbomb right in the beginning. Was damn entertaining to watch Horde dreads f1 in the end.
---
Do you stand a chance... vs me? Nope.  Vs the rest of then pilots in eve?  Yes
---
That's not CCP's job. They make the tools for players to push each other out of their comfort zone. If certain players refuse to that then its on them.
---
Shitfit, no refits/no nestor, git gud ccp
---
And you sound like you're pissed because you found out that this event doesn't target Goons and has zero effect on anything in the long run. You sound like the other thousand reddit commenters from the past week who wanted so bad for the Drifters to play the game for them.
---
Increase your resists and pop siege mode from time to time.
---
the hull timer and your supercap umbrella
---
I fly with goons you fucking professional victim lmao 
---
Not all of us slurp up Mittani's salty dick every morning
---
I mean you make people PVE with no reward you give people content like this drifter thing that isn't fun and people will burn out very fast and you will have people un-sub in droves CCP needs to wake up before the game is truly dead and that's coming from someone that's played the game for 10 years
---
Find anchor &gt; web anchor &gt; shoot bomb at anchor &gt; fleet stops under bombs
---
They're not that dynamic.
---
&gt; The end result, is an already solved, rewardless, mandatory pve event (which poses no actual threat) that distracts people from things that can actually generate content. 
---
Yep. I'm gunning citadels against NPCs at home instead of scouting enemy targets.
---
Does anybody have a standalone high quality picture of sexy drifter?
---
Does not exactly make for fun or enganging content though.
---
early reports sounded like they did.  We didn't understand yet that they just spawn randomly but in the same systems.  Nobody put 2+2 together in the first day that this wasn't actually a huge threat if you just dealt with the fleets in the systems they spawned.  Did goons need to go home?  probably not.  But with the frequency of their targeting they certainly can't fight while it's going on.  All their content creators are busy organizing the defense of their structures to make sure bridges in particular don't get killed by happenstance.
---
I don't have your specs and only recently took a look again after 5 years. Never liked nul sec but Drifters have been around for years.  I can't see any reason that the Pearls would want to shake up 0.0.  PLEX inflation would be the way. If my math is correct @ 150b isk you have 75 months omega.  Inflate the PLEX price again by 100% and @ 37 months you have to either start dropping accounts or paying rl cash.  We know its about the cash.  IF, only IF perchance these "drifters" limited 0.0 ISK revenue and caused a drawdown in assets could I see this being a big thing.  Otherwise the nul sec free ride will continue.  The desert makers don't made rl $ off ISK generated ingame.
---
Content creation is not a waste of time
---
You are a special snowflake aren’t you?
---
I'm going to murder you
---
they just spawned in the Horde Staging system BWJ or whatever it was called and every gate is filled w/ corpses and wrecks
---
Yes, unless you see a wallet or purse drop, then you should grab the loot first, then keep walking.
---
Aren’t all drifters sexy?

Who the fuck puts meat in the tomato sauced used on pizza?  Pizza sauce is crushed tomatoes with a touch of.basil and oregano and that's fucking it.  Its not even cooked down.

Come hang out in lowsec and let me shoot you

What do you mean? Most people I know want to undock and pew pew.
---
Yeah it is but where the most though?
---
Getting my challenge coin from Signal Cartel for helping with Katia Sae's travels.
---
Why are you so angry about this post?  You've posted all over about it.  Did OP kick your dog or something?
---
I left _one_ top level comment, rest are replies, not that I expect the kind of idiots who think "this looks random lol" to be important intel to be able to also count.
---
That's giving up before even trying though. I get that most people are put off by the fact that Goons have numerical superiority in almost ever way you can think of, but nobody wants to at least ship in to some cheap shit and harass them? Pop a few things? Anything? Is it any wonder Eve is going down the fucking toilet with attitudes like that? 
---
All it takes is a few bloody noses to get the ball rolling. The last time Eve came together to fight the sole superpower we knocked over their Empire and drove several alliances out of existence. Now everyone  acts like it's some insurmountable feat and they would rather blue up so they don't lose their shit rather than fight for anything. 
---
Everyone then tries to point the finger at everything and everyone else as the cause for Eve being in the condition it is, all the while sucking the proverbial dick and saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?"  What a fucking waste.
---
I love your comment thank you stranger
---
Wonderful, thank you for volunteering.  I expect to see a battle report this afternoon from your attempt.
---
Eat a dick dude.
---
I'm not upset at all.  Just curious why you're so damn triggered.  Between "top level comments" and your replies, you've made that clear.  I also find it fascinating that you're criticizing me for being unable to "handle an internet comment" when your entire post history in this thread is precisely that.  Who needs to grow up again?
---
they have a keep in the north, even their super pilots could just jc back home. Not like they're fighting the rats with titans anyway.
---
All right buddy, you're good to go, now get back to the fight!
---
Pandemic drifter.
---
Upvoted!
---
That's what I said.
---
I barely know shit about Eve (new) but I eat pizza.  As a fellow pineapple bro try this next time.  Bacon, onion and pineapple.  You get the slaty bacon, the flavor of onion and the sweet of pineapple to finish it off.
---
NPCs aren't content.
---
You literally can't think of anything better than "umad" when your argument fell apart. 
---
No you're right, that's totally what a mature person would do, definitely not fortnite-level insults here lmao.
---
You're right, "drifters shoot random shit" isn't really good information, because it's hard to confirm. 
---
But he didn't say that. He said "drifters do not pick targets based on size or power status". That is a useful observation.
---
Comets don't count because they're free.  VNI's \_soon\_.
---
I didn't know that, is there something that states that as an official acronym?
---
Is the fact that they all pull drones instantly when you enter the system through a wormhole proof?
---
&gt; though the way the dating was done you would have thought so.
---
That's probably why I felt like I had plenty of time after missing a couple of the login days by sheer forgetfulness. At the time, I wasn't "playing" EvE. I was mostly just keeping an active sub for skill training for the last year or so. Though within the last 2 weeks I got the gumption to find a corp in an alliance and start playing for real again.
---
My original point is that I thought people were upset about free SP, not about missing logins, which is even more silly.
---
Most people don't PvP 23/7. So mixing in some new interesting PvE is a good thing. I love PvP...but this was the first interesting PvE introduced to me since NPC Sotiyos which CCP also half assed sadly.
---
this seems to work but i'm not sure why.
---
AI? The OP describes randomized attacks. No AI there. And returning to the timer doesn’t require ”AI”.
---
Beat this filthy triangles.
---
No, it's literally a presentation of information we know so far. If any of you stupid fucks were half as intelligent as you try to put off you would realize this is a common step in intelligence analysis. What do we know, what do we not know? Just because two days after the event started nobody has been able to prove out anything doesn't mean it's not useful. 
---
I'm curious to hear your pseudointellectual perspective on it though, or do you actually have anything useful to contribute?
---
If you want to know how I'd change the mechanic.  I'd take the drifter fleets and make them spawn randomly from a fake wormhole in a region, once per timezone, and roam from gate to gate jumping from system to system until killed. They would only warp through belts and anomalies, maybe also sit on gates and jump bridges looking for ratters/miners.  You also give them 250km disruptors.
---
They would do 1/10th the dps/logi but have 20x the tank  
---
What that makes, is a content driver.  Drifter fleets tackle ratters and rorqs, and will eventually kill them if you don't fight them with a real pvp fleet comp.  That pvp comp is not really under threat from the drifters alone, but they are tethered to the grid for 15-20 minutes fighting them saving the rorqs.  That's enough time for a spontaneous engagement where most importantly, there are known unknowns on the grid.  How do the drifters pick a target?  who will they point?  who will they shoot?  You now have a dynamic engagement where even with perfect intel, neither side knows whether or not they will win, but both sides think they can win.  Those are the kinds of fights people take, and what makes eve interesting.
---
A couple points: 
---
I am curious why you're so mad - that's why I keep asking.  Obviously you can't put your finger on what's got you so bothered, otherwise you'd explain it using your words.  Instead you're throwing around insults (both to OP and now to me), including insults I frankly don't understand.  I've never played Fortnite - care to explain that one?  
---
Lastly, what argument of mine fell apart?  My only "argument" is that you're unnecessarily mad at this original post.  To the extent that constitutes an "argument" I suppose your continued frothing at the mouth and insult hurling "wins" it for me, right?
---
Honestly, If they continue to "Adapt" like Early drifters did, next Wednesday that should no longer work on them, They will have "Adapted" a counter to it
---
Never had this issue myself but you could also try opening and closing the new eden store. This should force the client to do a re-render of the scene
---
Kinda hoping it will be a thing.
---
Upvote for pure beauty.
---
Oh, you never had an argument apart from umad?
---
Oh yeah that's way better. Good job definitely not proving my point for me. You are _so_ smart!
---
no.  move a sabre into the system and find the pos/cit they warp to, logoff inline between that and the anom.  log in and bubble, see if they react like humans when they get stopped.
---
That's... that's what random means.
---
Would have lived if it was a salami pizza.
---
Report them and move on, or set up a trap
---
Now you're just making no sense whatsoever. Try taking a deep breath and explaining yourself better.  Ask yourself right now why you are so angry.  What happened that mad you so mad that you felt the need to come spew nastiness around this thread?  What did OP do to you?
---
&gt; Not like they're fighting the rats with titans anyway.
---
Not now that we understand the current drifters.
---
But if we were fighting fleets this size of the drifters that were in play back in 2015, Then we would have needed the Supers. (And even then we may have lost some to the Drifter DD's)
---
Did they take the fight, or run....
---
:D
---
Wow, my CEO issued a corp-wide order to not under any circumstances shoot drifter bosses anymore. I thought he just wanted to vietnam all of our 120 C6 farmholes, as some sort of salted-earth strategy, expecting an invasion from nullsec.
---
This makes more sense.
---
Oh so it's a list of things we _don't_ know. Right, that's way more useful, brilliant! Wow, I bet you thought you made a real smart comment there, but you just pointed out how fucking stupid this whole thing is yourself.
---
Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
will try that next time
---
Who knows what will replace the vni? We'll wait and see
---
I don’t think you are qualified to discuss on the topic of good life choices
---
And people told me I was tinfoiling when this not only happens, but happens during a plex sale and as the buying 1m sp for cash thing.
---
Scuffed. Okayga :+1:
---
unironically making vids of structure bashes
---
Get the fuck out.
---
Wormholers: Do Vigilant Tyrannos have standings and do you lose standing when you farm them?
---
Should rename to *more goon structure bashing propaganda*
---
Nice try at backtracking.
---
Unfortunately, we can all see the comment chain. You're not fooling anyone but yourself. Fortnite might be too difficult for you after all.
---
Nah man:) It just came to mind after a few things I read about NPC fights happening with not a single player around. 
---
But maybe it is true. Maybe this sandbox was planned as AI developing ground and was just open to players so they pay for maintenance...
---
Yeah, we got the cyno jammer up right around when we engaged. Didn't wanna ruin what would be a good fight by letting Goons/Snuff/Everyone else who has a dread cache near geminate drop on the brawl.
---
Why though? With citadel spam, cyno hammers, and weeks long reinforcement timers, war is shit right now. One region can support at least 20,000 players. There are 40 nullsec regions and not nearly enough players to force invasions. All the old content drivers are gone. We have infinite ore in colossals and enormous anomalies. We have infinite combat anomalies. EVE is a post scarcity society. Supers are crazy easy to build and there's no easy way to kill them in large numbers. Faxes are still over powered. Asset safety means that even if you're successful, nothing valuable drops like in POSes before and the enemy just gets hassle free redrawn at the nearest lowsec station.  Instead of balancing any of this, we've gotten a new race with new ships and combat in space pockets. This game is completely broken and people are quitting in large numbers, but it's the players' fault that we don't have big empire wars right now. Yeah, that makes sense.
---
I'm really out of the loop, what massive battle is this?
---
Backtracking from what? Now I'm extra confused.
---
Actually the trailer is pretty cool. Thanks for making it.
---
Oh wait! It's init? Then grr goons :P
---
doing god's work!
---
Umm, any non-organic decision-making process is generally considered AI. Computer players in games are a rudimentary form of AI. You program them to respond in an increasingly complex manner based on a number of conditions. 
---
Most people now don't consider computer opponents AI due to what is known as the AI effect. As computers/machines become increasingly capable, we often don't refer to the tasks they accomplish as requiring an "intelligence". In essence, we move the goal posts. 
---
In order to get them to respond in the manner you describe would require additional logic to be incorporated. Most people don't realize the amount of programming that is required to perform what are seemingly simple tasks. Developing a decision-making engine capable of performing a number of complex tasks which evaluate any number of conditions and provide a set of behaviors, all working in tandem, isn't quite as simple as a lot of armchair developers try to believe.
---
A feeling you are no doubt very used to. 
---
Enjoy your life, feel free to reply with another "umad" since I know getting the last message is very important to people your age.

So far I am a naive and gullible shutin, that measures self worth based on my bankaccount and winning reddit arguments. You've also implied that being a horde linemember is somehow bad and tells you something about my character.

"Content creation."
---
Overpowered NPCs that will instablap any subcap they happen to run into. How many people that fly DED fit lokis, blinked out marauders, rattlesnakes, and other loot pinatas are staying docked right until they figure out if the drifters are a serious risk. If the answer is any, then that's content that isn't there for anyone hunting or roaming looking for kills.
---
Just remove asset safety and get rid of citadel spam :)
---
Well I'm glad we could get to the bottom of it together.

if reffed by drifter then spawn bashing\_fleet on exit\_reinforce
---
You've provided plenty of entertainment so far - thank you for that.  Good luck being mindlessly angry on the internet in the future. I'm sure you'll continue to entertain others wherever you go.
---
I don't think I've seen anyone look as stupid and immature as you do right now, in a very long time. You are the jewel of r/eve.
---
Would you care to join, or are you all bluster?
---
Nobody who is not Imperium ally has any strength left to fight Goons. There is no point in trying. This is a reality. Unless there is a way to actually hurt Goons in some way without needing 1000 supers, wars with them will never come again. Its end game currently. Time to reset EVE.
---
No MJD?
---
W spaces yes, K space no
---
You call that war? You went to shoot structures...as per statement from other goons. Your dear leader said you won and you had most fun ever?
---
Everyone is happy if there is a way to deal with a citadel spam without having to sacrifice half their brain cells while doing it. 
---
The current event is hitting your enemies, which is about 30% of the null sec player base, and they also have fun. Its only goons that are bitching hard, maybe because you guys have spread across half the fucking map, and have plopped keepstars every few jumps? And basically you are among the biggest offenders of the citadel spam, that is currently going on?
---
Cry me a fucking river.
---
decent idea
---
https://youtu.be/a2ZxVsmI7NQ. Where the title comes from.  One of the Best Eve Keynote speeches ever.
---
I think you're missing quite a lot of variables in your codebase there. That's a fairly simplified function and more often than not is far from the way something like that would be implemented.  I can appreciate that some people have taken an intro to Python or C# or whatever, and most of the stuff you can write in there really is that simple. I doubt this would be one of those cases.
---
The change I want starts with mechanics, which is why I spent the last month advocating for people to vote vily, cornak, and dunk onto the CSM.  What have you done lately?
---
Three sets of NPCs had a large battle that nobody witnessed.
---
Doesn’t feel too late to me!
---
Nah everyone who likes the farmville playstyle is already with you
---
 You can play with yourselves
---
Why do you go shoot them  mr "eve is dead" ?
---
Content creation for who? The citadel gunners that have to race all over a region to gun citadels? The npc drifters?
---
yeah, yeah, you're smart.
---
Yeah. The game having a "1% chance you just fucking die when you jump gates" is really, really bad.
---
If it's players camping the gate, it's fine, that's other people choosing to spend their time doing that. When it's NPCs, it's effectively just a random chance to die because fuck you. That's the polar opposite of good design.
---
Continue to advocate for positive changes in the game no matter how unpopular or how much shit people try to give me for my opinions. There are some changes in the game I think can be beneficial, but there also needs to be changes in the players as well. None of the game changes are going to matter if you can't get the players to stop killing their own game.
---
Should rename your reddit account to another brain dead ree monkey, join the que slick.

---
Not willing to put your money where your mouth is but willing to complain about others being unwilling eh?
---
That's not the point I'm trying to make. My original point was, and still is, they're still working on the NPC AI and it's probably not at the point people want it to be, but it's still not bad.
---
Grow up, mate. It's a game. There's no reason we can't be friendly whilst still shooting each other.
---
was i wrong in what i said? 
---
it’s literally a video of structure bashing lol
---
Lame as fuck that they didnt wax any low power citadels.
---
Why not create the content you want to see?  Grab a following, lead people to the cause?
---
I don't think you know enough to even make that claim. I don't post under my game name for obvious reasons.
---
What content was created?
---
My point is, if CCP wanted  them to show up on reffing timers, they would.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/nullsec/
---
Is this what you want? All drifter kills are there, the live kills some times shows some other NPC though.
---
feigned ignorance
---
Post was removed.
---
But.
---
Honest advice time: if you are neglecting your girlfriend to play EVE then you need to reevaluate your priorities. If you're still spending time with her and she's giving you shit for doing things without her, that's not a sign of a healthy relationship. Both people in a relationship need to be able to have their own interests and hobbies. As long as it's not to excess and you're careful to strike a balance, it's not an unreasonable expectation to have in a relationship.
---
Because anyone can deliver ships to anyone else. When the citadel is destroyed in wh space, all the ships fall out and are blown up by the attackers. Thus, killmails.
---
Lmao @ this. People managed to fight ncpl when they were overwhelming folks with caps, supers, and titans.
---
i guess drifters aren't the only [random overpowered thing](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77538402/) eh
---
If you go all the way back up to my original comment, I was saying I don't think they are there yet. You can get an idea of the development progress of the new NPC systems from some videos posted recently of Eve North I believe. It's actually not a bad watch.
---
Your response implies that you will only do so if he does so.
---
nice morale structure bash post
---
Maybe not a change in general but perhaps letting Drifters fuck up local in regions or constellations they're invading...
---
Damn ccp, the new heretic skin looks boss
---
I heard you guys got over 100 structure notifications in a couple hours this morning, while TEST had 22 (just counted). Whatever NPC-spawn formula CCP is using seems to be hitting Goons harder than any other nullsec alliance. Do you think it's based on adms or player population? Either way, Goons appear to be getting hit harder by drifters. Not :tinfoil:
---
13 sec from turning off the AB till warping off when I tried it.
---
Who says I don't? What am I doing now, just arguing for the sake of pissing and moaning, or maybe trying to inspire people to embody the change they want to see in the game?
---
Because hostile entities were jacking off about the 20+ delve timers that were created. Now the steamroller will get back on track and continue to delete the north.
---
i can't see any situation where dropping a titan on them would make sense, supers i guess if they aggro the fighters but still, the overreaction over it announcing they're heading home with the supers in the first day is pretty bizarre, you had people fending them off already to some extent. Hell if the move op up there was any indication they'd barely manage to move back in time anyway.
---
You forgot the part where you warp away the instant anything that can actually challenge you shows up.
---
Not really. Nothing in my comment implies that. In fact, asking him to join might imply that I'm already doing something. 
---
\-"People don't often see the world as it is, they see it as they are"
---
Really, swap all 3 low slots out to ham, and just rig it with a bacon burst aerator.  Extra DPS with minimal align time.
---
the word you're looking for is patched
---
Are the wrecks at least worth salvaging?
---
no
---
Scan down a wormhole. Look it up on http://anoik.is/ and determine what it's static wormholes are. If the static is a C5 or C6, then you're on your way. If not, keep scanning, you may be able to find and incoming (k162) wormhole of the class you are looking for
---
An eagle fleet about 130ish strong only lost 1 to a drifter fleet, due to him not broadcasting. Wasn't too bad.
---
He’s a legend.
---
Plenty of empty C5s.  C6s, maybe, but less likely.  The best way to find them is get yourself into a wormhole that can connect to C5s, for example.  Find a C4 with a static C5, then roll that hole and look for connections.  If you don't have the ability to move in while you look, just get into a chain or Thera, find a C5, and start scanning from there.  C5s tend to link to one another in great frequency (The "C5 Highway") so you'll have better luck finding an empty one.  You can also just pay someone to find one for you - Wingspan offers this, and you can reach out to Signal Cartel and see if one of their scouts wants to make some isk on the side.  That's the best bet.
---
They spawn all over new Eden? Lowsec/ NPC null etc, or just where there’s money making ventures / high ADMs and that.
---
Link some battlereports of your so called content creation
---
oh no it's you again
---
Give me the corpses and I'll load 'em into shuttles to be burned at the sun for your leisure
---
far from optimal though when you can do it with 35 corms, 1 super, or 1 fort gunner.
---
As far as I know, just sov null right now
---
 I already made the comment about not associating my Reddit account with my ingame account. The reasons are obvious I would think. That extends to not posting killmails and battle reports identifying myself as being in them. Sorry. Childish taunts and insults won't work either in case you think no one has tried that before.
---
&gt; Most people I know want to post on r/Eve about how much they love to pew pew.  
---
FTFY
---
As if ncpl ever had 1k titans...against what? 400...500...dudes. Not including the subcap support...
---
What's the wormhole with the massive fleet of drifters hanging out inside? Would it be possible to get sleepers to engage in the same way?
---
Lets not confuse the retarded nullbears that post here with people that actually go out and fight in various ways, shapes or forms.
---
That's pretty cool, thanks.
---
This is a good idea, maybe attach the LP value to the implant value pluged into the corpse head. 
---
Just so the store doesn't get exploited by people self destructing their pods.
---
So you refuse provide proof to back up your claims
---
Got it.

This one?

Sorry to disappoint
---
Poor nerfherders...any nerf can be countered. Especially by those who have an incentive to devise a counter.
---
Your tears and bitching and screams for various nerfs over the years have always ultimately been for nothing.
---
Remember the same sort of bitching and moaning when I left the first time five years ago. Mainly because even though I typically thought up ways around anything they nerfed within a day or two after a while I got tired of them fucking with my toys at the behest of bitchers and moaners.
---
For some reason CCP thinks appeasing bitchers and complainers is a good business model, long term. They already lose 90% of new players (by their own public admission). Nerfing anything is more likely to piss off a certain percentage of players into leaving than players who would leave it things were left well enough alone. We've seen recently large alliances, for various reasons, saying fuck it all and quitting...
---
People in general in gaming HATE nerfs. It's not necessary to take my word for it. Go do some quick research yourself.
---
You'll see.
---
That was a fun afternoon.
---
Very good post, thanks for the details.
---
Quarter 3 is comin' up boys, gotta get those login metrics inflated.
---
140 day old post but thank you I will use it when I come back to the game.

I think I'd also add strategically turning up to structure timers in some way to this.

that's what i get for going into highsec on a weekend.

I'll be honest, the first thing that came to mind when I saw that face was the noice guy, but with glasses.
---
you are saying this as if we are supposed to know who you - some random internet user on a random internet platform, that happens to be some random player in EVE - are.
---
not sure what you were expecting.
---
I don't think without touching TZ and Jammer mechanics, any pve event could make an organic structure fight not suck.  But definitely out in space.
---
Ouch, I thought those could tank them enough to get reps, F.

&gt; I’m unsure why he feels the need to spin a massive narrative about it.

Are you new here? He probably a spins a narrative to the toilet roll when he's taking a shit, to the kettle when making a coffee and to his fork when eating dinner.
---
Ah ok, cheers
---
Says the goon.
---
How about a different perspective? 
---
The problem may have already been solved, and appear to be a joke, but for a day or two there it caused a different level of excitement. Isn’t that what all this is about? 
---
You have to understand: because of the Eve learning curve and mechanics, I fine that Eve’s player base is highly intelligent on average. With that in mind, or course we are going to solve every problem. From what I’ve seen it goes: freak out and excitement, analyze, fit, optimize. By the time we get to optimize, the problem isn’t even trivial; we are speed running it to maximize profit, but that’s the name of the game. 
---
Can you tell me a game mechanic besides pvp, that is so adaptable that it presents a consistent challenge?

Goon tears.

My username is my in-game name.  A simple look in-game or zkill, with a couple minutes of very easy detective work, would make it fairly easy to determine who "I" am.   The people with whom I have flown already know who my main is and what I have done or did.  I make no pretense that I am some well known character, because I am not, but I'm not hiding in the least who I am.  We're on a subreddit dedicated to EVE Online, so that is what I am referring to, ofc.
---
A lot of people awfully angry that I called Red Frog et al shit tier, but that is exactly what they are.  Shit tier.  They failed to adapt as the game changed around them.  CCP revamped BR and DST, making them hugely effective and safe hualers, and Red Frog responded by doing nothing.  CCP revamped freighters and jump freighters with added low slots and some brand new modules, and Red Frog/Black Frog adapted by.. doing nothing, again.  And it shows in the lack of level of service they offer, despite them being significantly more costly to ship with in many case, especially JF and BR/DST sized shipments.
---
I handle most of my own logistics, which will be blatantly obvious from just looking at who I am,  but on the few times I've been unsubbed/alpha, or when I literally cannot be arsed,  and I need things moved,  it's a no brainer to use PushX.
---
This.
---
Try something smaller first or join a WH corp.
---
What are they changing?
---
Yes go to FW and shoot stuff.
---
CCP traded the trust of half their content creators for 2 days of tricking people into getting interested again in a mechanic that is nothing like why people got interested.  That doesn't seem like a good trade.
---
&gt; Can you tell me a game mechanic besides pvp, that is so adaptable that it presents a consistent challenge?
---
No I can't, which is a problem.
---
Maynard James Keenan
---
That’s fair, but if I were to ask a programmer, I’m curious how difficult it would be to program highly dynamic AI that learns like that. 
---
If I was CCP I would just higher a small group of multibox pvp players to run NPC fleets for an event like this rather than program them.
---
Oh, very cool. I'll be sure to watch them. Thanks!

If only there was someone in this thread that could do just that. /s

&gt; In fact, asking him to join might imply that I'm already doing something.

Never assume the best of people unless you want to get burned.
---
I am a software engineer, and the answer is very difficult.  But you can make things seem dynamic enough with significantly less effort.  
---
If I was CCP I would have done [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c6z1ft/a_mechanical_analysis_of_the_drifter_invasion/esce23h/).  You could even have used the same AI.  Just pick different targets to warp to and set them to disappear from one gate, and re appear on the next system's to simulate a jump.
---
22 minutes of ferox gameplay!!!
---
How I see it is there are a lot players that don’t take responsibility for their own PvP content. They sit in large alliances and mine or rat until a ping comes. Then they hit F1 until they can go back to mining and ratting. 
---
They don’t take advantage of all the things the sandbox allows and don’t create content. They need someone to create content for them. There’s nothing really wrong with this style, it can be more relaxing and can help it feel more like a game vs a job for some.
---
this is a bad post.
---
Are you from *outside*?
---
If their purpose was to do anything about structures there was a script for them to return. Is that "AI" ? I think that's the point traffic_cone was making.
---
We’re goon pets...lol
---
Are unfueled offline gates a single timer though??
---
Where does it say anything about local?
---
Comparing attacks over the last few days, there is some metric Delve is 8x Esoteria, but also 8x Paragon Soul.  I have not yet determined a metric to which Paragon Soul and Esoteria are equal, Feythabolis is NOT equal (since it hasn't been hit at all), and delve is roughly 8x more.
---
I've run nonlinear functions for MER, Jumps, ADM distribution, Alliance size, everything I could think of.
---
I honestly don't know.
---
We got blueballed so really nothing else to do
---
I oversimplified
---
Titan lasers
---
Got 'baited' by obvious bait on our home npc null structure. Got dropped on by three blops. We were able to reship and blap two of them.
---
Well you didn't say that.
---
&gt;you're literally baiting
---
oh boo hoo, baiting them into a free to play game
---
I try with emp and i die again : https://zkillboard.com/kill/77539938/
---
Next time with the 20% tracking ammo hope it will be great. Because i didnt touch it one time again. My toon has tracking 4 (max on alpha) i m slow boating 200ms because neut + web. At the begining with ab on i m faster but not enouth to track. Also i will try web + warp scramble.
---
It's not that they're wasting time you see I'm a acceleratonist and everytime some Reddit retard tells a person it's worth it they add onto CCPs shitty statistics
---
THIS really needs to happen. You simply can't always rely on the risk-aversive nature of human players to keep the meta game fresh.

EVE 2k19

If you think it's not worth playing, what the heck are you doing still playing.

If you think it is worth playing, why say otherwise.

&gt;Structure bashing trailer

Is this just a badjuice video with extra steps?

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for better tools.

you sound like that person who said eve was dead back in 2007.   or 2008

or 2009

or 2012

or 2017
---
or 2018
---
or this year.
---
and yet here we are
---
You ask on reddit ofc
---
Do goons have an abnormal amount of structures in systems hit comparatively?
---
Because is a game that if you don’t understand mechanics you suffer.  Most people just press buttons
---
Yeah I think someone basically wanted to meme on him and transfered ships, then killed the citadel that they were in.  Pretty funny XD
---
well, the triglavian invasion took 3 weeks to scale up this far.
---
i would wait for a bit to draw final conclusions. maybe it was just to give alliances a bit time to reconsider their timezone tanking before phase 2 rolls out
---
the salt is strong in this one
---
More or less 8 times as many structures across more or less 8 times as many systems.
---
So what you're telling me Eve isn't dying faster and that it's summer numbers wouldn't be way lower without the Chinese migrating to our server???
---
Thanks big brain
---
In order to isolate what effect the changes you are making have, you need to make the changes incremental. 
---
Add change A, observe, and modify as needed. Add change B, etc.
---
You don't just dump a huge modification on to a live server and hope for the best. Isolated testing only yields limited feedback. That's why changes happen slowly and testing is encouraged on Sisi for major updates. I'm sure in order to keep this a secret though they are limiting what information players have available. 
---
As for the "AI" question, I think I addressed it another post. The assumption being made is that in order to make Drifters return to hit the structures they have reinforced is a a matter of adding a few simple lines of code, which I doubt.  This new behavior will have to be integrated in to the rest of their behavioral model. None of this is as simple as "Spawn drifters on top of a location and start firing". The Drifters appear to be spawning in systems around their wormhole locations(if reports are accurate) and travel around those systems attacking players and structures. You would need to track more information and integrate it in to their behavior for them to start attacking specific structures in specific areas of space at specific times based on the status of the structure. I'm not sure CCP has their AI model at the point they can do that yet.
---
A Leshak and a few beers can knock those down
---
glad you had a good time. please continue to toot the horn so we can go again next year!
---
will it tho
---
So why are you here?
---
i'm saying you don't know what a dying game looks like.
---
games rise, they peak,  they settle.   and then they die.
---
eve is still in the settle, as do most games for the majority of their lives
---
Nice, cope harder
---
&gt; Then Drifters came to NS and did what everyone was hoping for a few weeks back.
---
mostly because it's stupid shit. literally it's just trying to piss off their players. it's NOT fun. it's dumb
---
Because it's a subreddit and I don't have to play some mindnumbing game to say it's still garbage??
---
Bro, nobody here is more autistic than you. Normal people do not get this unreasonably upset over such a simple thread lmao
---
no. it's because drifters are dumb.
---
Horde can certainly be a bit cancer sometimes but when it comes to stuff like this they will absolutely bring a good fight and not just cap blob.  Dropped a solo dread in BWF a while back and had a blast.  10/10 would do again.
---
&gt;So you have to deal with them
---
No you don't. There is no requirement. The players are deciding it's mandatory
---
Is EFT up to date or remade? I totally quit EVE when EFT died.
---
i mean, it's either 'mandatory' because they're going to kill shit, or it isn't because they're not. you can't have it both ways.
---
i think the big blocs just don't want to have to deal with all these structure timees, which suggests that under these conditions, they would be well advised to reduce the amount of infrastructure they deploy to what is strictly necessary.
---
they will kill bridges and beacons if left unattended, citadels aren't really under any sort of threat even if you left them alone.
---
I totally agree. The problem is this drifter shit isn't a tool, its a bullet. Its not a mechanic that can be used by the player base to fight each other or gain advantage, its just forced instanced PVE.
---
Kill all but one, leave the last one to run around by itself and accomplish nothing.
---
[Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/9xT6Eot.jpg)

I’m unable to find the actual source website though. Sorry.
---
Hey, if you teach new guys to get this enjoyment out of this game you're alright in my book Hoss
---
So you are admitting that you need CCP to fight Goons for you. Yeah, way to be a content creator.
---
No, tomato sauce applies much more damage
---
Structure Timers were a mistake.
---
his point is sound. dran is simultaneously saying the event is pointless because it's easy to manage, and that it's just this giant stupid annoying thing to manage.
---
either can be true, and it might be different for some groups compared to others. but it can't be both easy to manage and annoying to manage, ineffectual and impactful, or trivial and taxing at the same time.
---
upwell structures now require a lot more upkeep versus the environment. fewer structures require less upkeep, so there is now a real disincentive for structure spam.
---
if that's true, just fuel your bridges as you never really need to defend them, right? and ignore all the citadel timers. after all, they "aren't really under any sort of real threat", which doesn't sound like mandatory pve to me.
---
I like this guy's flair.
---
Sadly with large groups pulling their esi from zkill their losses don’t show. Only those with esi added to zkill will populate with not only losses unless they’re manually added.
---
Could it simply be a logarithmic function though? If a system with half as many people and another with 1/30th get hit about as much (1/8 less) this smells lik a logarithmic function to me.
---
Just link the lossmail already.
---
[Falcon told me Nova isn't dead just being rebuilt and I hope they keep the intro](https://youtu.be/unUCfp7TT_A)
---
sounds like you have too many citadels.
---
the problem with bridges is they only have a structure timer, so a guy with station manager has to fly over and turn it back on.  That gets really old really fast.
---
The video editing is really good, but yeah, it's just a bunch of uncontested structure bashing. 
---
Honestly, if you weren't still hiding behind the Goons skirts you would get a lot more respect. I think your leadership realizes that if you didn't bend the knee, Goons would look at you as a threat and try to bury you. Same reason Test has blued up. Everyone so scared of losing their internet space pixels but want to complain about no content.
---
Someone give this man a gold.
---
Yes. They had impervious wreckingballs when we had Domis. They had tracking titans when we had drakes. They had AOE doomsdays when we had ravens. They had cyno doomsdays when we had rifters. We spent a decade and a half punching up, and undocking and fighting against far superior enemies, and now that NCPL have finally lost the advantage, oh how the keyboard warrior's tears flow.
---
Players just don't want to risk anything anymore. 
---
Where are all the golden FC's that tried - even outnumbered.
---
Well, someone else could follow up, right?
---
Because bee man bad. Goons are salty! You need to keep repeating the mantra if you want those sweet updoots.
---
Awesome post. So far it looks like an overall non-opressive event but it's not a total answer to the stagnation either.
---
While I personally loathe PVE, I don't have anything against new PVE. The problem with this is that it throws a giant wrench in the sandbox because this is no longer voluntary. For every player being forced to shoot some stupid drifter ships that offer zero reward, that's one more player not shooting at another player.
---
that or we're just sick of the sandbox being designed around endless rorq mining and citadel spam.
---
nobody thought it was 'just' delve. but have you looked around delve lately buddy? does it look like a healthy pvp environment? an overview clogged with pointless shit and morale keepstars?
---
They don't show up for final timers. Who cares....if anything they do initial RF's for you to show up and kill people. The only things to my knowledge that have died were jump gates on short timers and they never cleared rats from the system.  
---
If CCP up'd the loot tables people would reeeee the other way saying it's an isk faucet.
---
Excuse me, John Hartley, I need to get to the other side of the room but I can't do it through all this tension.

Actually, the ceptors latency does not matter at all. The only one's which matters is the guy trying to point you.

It's like I recognize the words as English, but arranged in that order makes absolutely no fucking sense.

9/10 trolling.  Nicely done.  I am extremely confused

I dont understand what the fuck you're saying lady.

Theorycrafting is the staple of any good MMO though, I'd say it's part of gameplay.

King Mittani, Lord of the Pubbies and master vapist declares war on highsec only days after announcing that ~the imperium can handle it~. Top Kek.

Whats Cyno?
---
I would wager it's still too early to really know all the mechanics.
---
Aryth has new toys. You can feel his drool from here.
---
And this event has zero impact on rorq mining or citadel spam or anything of substance.
---
But I like how to you, when an alliance actually uses their space to its maximum, that it must be the sandbox that is broken.
---
for a simple nonlinear function to have two equal outputs, two equal inputs would be required.
---
Nice video ´....killing of structures, i however know that its hard to film proper pvp when the enemy stay docked xD
---
You're interpreting it all wrong, not only can the Imperium handle it but we're gonna wage war on HighSec at the same time.
---
If given the opportunity, players will attempt to optimoze the fun out of the game.
---
old news its been planed for days, ccp made mitten do pve content bad move
---
this coming from provi....
---
You're just being needlessly pedantic and insulting here.
---
CCP has all the tools they need to be able to add such a thing in, the real question is if it is something that can be done using the Design tools their Designers use, or if an Engineer has to get involved. Knowing how you rarely get to do things the *right* way after your game has shipped, I would doubt they'd be refactoring the existing event/trigger system they use, but adding some intermediary functions to translate what is needed to work within the existing framework shouldn't be difficult.
---
Add a bitflag to the database entry for structure timers indicating if the event was triggered by Drifters, then add a callback to spawn a Drifter fleet when the exit reinforcement event is fired. I doubt the Drifters are set up with a system that allows for you to specify a target or spawn point beyond the system, but spawning them in-system to go shoot things at random is still dangerous enough to merit a defense fleet.
---
My list is a sample of games that I play, not all games out there.
---
Take this to your leaders: If AI in EVE were 100% autonomous actors (which die permanently when killed - they're not capsuleers) which persist after server restart, hold their own agendas, 'friendships,' grudges, etc. **it would be impossible to bot them.** It goes against the spirit of EVE Online's sandbox to have its PVE content be repeatable, predictable, gameable, and relentlessly optimizable. The fact that us players are able to create wiki guides about "what will happen on the X wave of a combat site" is a problem. Autonomous AI would allow for a totally new type of gameplay - the type Hardwar had. 
---
Messing with Hardwar's AI was half the fun of that game. Leading AI into their enemies? Dropping cargo to spark a fight? Damaging AI so they'd repair at your own hangar which happened to be the nearest nearby? Setting up a cheap store for components so that the traders would flock to your business? All were possible.
---
It was already brought up that these invasions do nothing to increase PVP because they move too fast for any enemy response fleet to show. And they seem to hit structures randomly, so while the chances of a drifter fleet actually killing a structure are very low, there is still a small chance that requires a response. 
---
At the end of the day, I play EVE because I want to fight other players, not the game. If I wanted that I would go play WOW.
---
9/10 take my upvote
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77541119](http://goatse.ru)
---
Seems like you're the one complaining here.  
---
You can call it bending the knee or whatever, but goons have been by far the best, and really the only worthwhile, allies that we've ever had.  We could easily have walked away from them in 2016 when they had no leverage to make anyone bend any joint - indeed we were offered space and huge sums of casino money to do so, but we didn't.  I think we're entitled to reap the rewards of that choice for as long as we choose.
---
Well good news for you - we soon will have a NIP with all of 0.0...so hope you don't like pvp that much.  
---
But for real...hostiles could just show on final timers. Skip the first damage cap'd cancer grind on them. At the very least MAYBE if we're lucky this shit sticks around and farms botters and low power citadels.
---
IIRC we were promoted to 'goon sig' a while back
---
imagine going after highsec to recruit highsec carebears beause youve already recruited most of the renter carebears in eve
---
I think the main point is that as it stands the event is useless and could easily be ignored. However CCP released it with no foreknowledge of the event and no notification of it. They could just as easily change the mechanics of it and suddenly the drifters start showing up for second timers and since they already have shown they are willing to release something this impactful with no notification you have to act as if it might happen. No null block wants to suddenly have hundreds of final timers because they assumed what CCP has in mind.
---
Thus this event is so far both meaningless and has to be treated as if it every structure could die.
---
Guys I am also conducting a social experiment, this one is on trust. Give me 1 bil isk and I will send it back.
---
People told me I would "never catch up" when I started back in 2006
---
wow mit, instead of devoting all this time to hisec in a hissy fit, have you considered using our famed organisational skills to trim down the spampire that is our homeland? maybe we should actually fuck some of these leeches and their vanity structures out of the alliance  
---
you know, like we used to when we had standards
---
~forced~
---
&gt;when we had standards
---
oh please
---
&gt; like we used to when we had standards
---
Before becoming pubbieswarm right?
---
No idea.
---
sounds like a mob leaders meeting in the back room of a italian restaurant
---
just say them/their, works perfectly fine for a singular individual of unknown identity
---
If you call farming dump npcs over and over "content".....
---
Please take this back to the rest of CCP: If all AI in EVE were like Hardwar's -- 100% autonomous actors which persist after server restart, hold their own agendas, 'friendships,' grudges, etc. **it would be impossible to bot them.** 
---
As you know, messing with Hardwar's AI was half the fun of that game. Leading AI into their enemies? Check. Dropping cargo to spark a fight? Check. Damaging AI so they'd repair at your own hangar which happened to be the nearest nearby? Check. Setting up a cheap store for components so that the traders would flock to your business? Check. The list went on and on. Few NPC fights in HardWar were always quite the same. Except its AI was stupid. You have the technology to do better than HardWar did.
---
Like that, you could have different archetypes such as trader, pirate, scavenger, explorer, vigilante, faction-gang, _navy police_ . . . all acting realistically to their own goals and serving as a small bit of "the game running itself" whether players interact with it or not. 
---
No more "PVE-specific fits" designed specifically for NPCs. I want NPCs that think for themselves, take sov, and pose a legitimate threat. I want NPCs that combat probe you down and warp to you at 10 while cloaked. NPCs that scram and web you. NPCs that show self-preservation, because if they die once, they're done. NPCs that fear capsuleers and call for reinforcements via cyno. Newbies who fight one-on-one with or against tiny groups of autonomous AI that mimic players (but not quite as good as players) might learn the same skills that are necessary to survive against the genuine enemy capsuleer.  
---
No more repeatable quests. No more missions. No more of the Bethesda-style "spawn NPCs as window dressing." Blur the line between PVE and PVP. Because it goes against the spirit of EVE Online's sandbox to have its PVE content be repeatable, predictable, gameable, and relentlessly optimizable. The fact that us players are able to create wiki guides about "what will happen on the X wave of a combat site" is a problem. That type of AI belongs in a themepark MMO, not here. And it's why botting exists.
---
Replace 'test' with any nullsec name you want.
---
The thing is, the eve community is toxic but only/mostly to its own veteran players to fuck each other up for the fun of it.
---
&gt; a narcissistic man-child
---
You have to be narcissistic to put yourself forward to be President, or any other political position.  So that criticism is invalid.  I couldn't care less if he's a "man-child".  The best thing about him is he triggers idiots like you.  I hope he wins 2020 so we get 4 more years of such hilarity.
---
Yes.
---
Sauce goes in the low slots, cheese in the mid slots. toppings in the high slots. Rigs are things like stuffed crust, garlic "butter" dipping sauce, double cheese, or the like.
---
Not really, just because they don't pick targets based on the listed criteria doesn't mean they aren't selecting based on some other factor. Logic squares and what not.
---
Sounds like fun then
---
Disgusting.
---
Yeah but don't join gallente noobs :-)
---
RvB is recruiting!

Then imagine wondering why nobody will attempt to invade Delve with your bigger super umbrella

Kinda just feels like it’s a test pilot run to see how the community reacts to a change that they didn’t implement on Sisi first. They still have time to make community reaction changes but will they get to these changes in time for the fast paced community? I’m interested to see where they go with this. I hope they clear up space citadel spam junk though. I quit Eve and just watch from the sidelines now hoping this game gets better so I can hop back in and resub but right now it isn’t worth it. I’ve got several friends that are the same way.
---
TL;DR  It's all teh ebil Goonies fault my leet ceptor got nerfed.   
---
Plenty of people complained about "Fozzyclaws" being a pain in the ass, not just Goons.  Everybody cheezed the system, and nobody was getting any fights, like you and CCP thought would happen.  CCP listened to the CSM, the entire CSM (yes Goons were a larger part than most other groups, but not the entire CSM) who all thought it was a pretty cheesy system, not just Goons.  It's obvious you're biased if you think the "Goon CSM" secretly controls CCP.  Hell you probably think it was the Mittani, who faked the moon landings not Kubrick.
---
\^_^
---
here's my prediction: as long as goons are getting butt-fucked, nobody is going to go out of their way to help them.  
---
the reality is that our alliance/coalition is too fucking big, and we have too much shit and too many people because ccp fucked the economy and sandbox. i don't think this corrective is perfect, but it \*is\* a corrective and everyone should have faced this kind of upkeep all along.  
---
if mittani thinks that he can out-structure bash the drifters, he's insane.
---
I'm not sure how a single paragraph pointing out that it's beyond developing a single statement for to implement the behavior that's being referred to is being "needlessly pedantic", a little insulting maybe. 
---
I don't know the limitations of their design tools anymore than anyone else does that hasn't worked with them. I was simply pointed out that their criticism of the lack of a Drifter response to reinforcement timers is more than likely due the fact that they have not developed the functions to implement it yet. The argument being that CCP just has an "On/Off" switch they could be using and just refuse to. 
---
I'm sure you probably are more versed than I am given your claim of being a game programmer who has worked with CCP, so you would know better than most. From your response though, even you admit that there could be limitations based on the developer tools available that would need additional programming to implement properly. That being said, I doubt you would want to simply start spawning Drifter fleets out of nowhere on top of every structure they've reinforced.  I would think they would want it to be a more organic behavior that fits in to the current system that they're using for spawn behavior. 
---
So where in my statements am I wrong and where is somebody else saying "CCP just sucks and doesn't want to do it" right?
---
the standards weren't high, but they were standards damn it!
---
sounds like you need fewer bridges, instead of just having as many as you could ever want, and then some.
---
Here’s kinda the run down of my situation:
---
- Been playing since around 2008 with a mix of heavy play every day, and then some year long gaps before playing again 
---
- Have lived everywhere from high sec, NPC and sov null, WH, etc. 
---
- Have several toons that are well skilled in their respective roles (T3 cruiser pilot, mining pilot, PI/Indy pilot, and a minm carrier pilot) 
---
- Joined the goon blue wall last year during my last heavy period of playing, got bored as shit around last July and quit again
---
Now I’m feeling the bug to play again, but something tells me I want to start off kinda “fresh”. I’m thinking of selling every toon except for the one I actually created way back in 2008 and dumping all of that ISK into skill injecting a fresh toon. I’d have somewhere around 120bil from selling off the toons and their assets. 
---
**So, help me out here, what should my new goal be?**
---
The whole sov null “carrier farm until you maybe get a fleet ping or your SIG has something to do” schtick ruined any fun I had in the game, so I want to go back and try something different.
---
I have only ever done sov space as a goon, so I’m considering joining panfam for a change of culture - but I’m afraid of just falling into the same pattern as I was in goon space. 
---
WH space was fun for awhile, but scanning gets tiring REAL quick after a few months. 
---
High-sec stuff never really appealed to me, since wars mainly just involve sitting on undock for hours. 
---
Low sec I haven’t really experienced too much, but I have a great deal of time spent roaming there. 
---
I’m willing to move to any of them tbh, I just want a more active play-style with more risk compared to Goon-null. 
---
Hope this wall of text helps you help me, thanks.
---
I'm not sure, basically in some systems finishing a particular site spawns one and there were about 50 last time I saw it mentioned.
---
You should be blaming poor game design rather than the entirety of nullsec from artificially limiting themselves.
---
Dude that was awesome content - thank you!! Streamfleet best logi right?!
---
Im sorry I dont understand what youre trying to say. This isnt a structure bash, this is making it so that moon goo and ore that is null exclusive stays in null and hisec starts feeling the heat.
---
Thanks!
---
i like how to you, when an alliance can no longer use space to its former maximum, that must mean that the sandbox is gone.  
---
nullsec wasn't always like this. you couldn't always fit as many people into a region as goons do into delve. the sandbox you're whining about was *changed*, and it was changed in such a way as to make choices less difficult and less interesting. a little over 3 years ago you couldn't dock supercaps. less than 4 years ago fozzie sov wasn't a thing, and we couldn't cram 40k people into a single region.  
---
now after 2-3 years of the runaway economy that followed, ccp has altered the sandbox again, and people are losing their shit. i guess we'll have to eat our own words and 'adapt'.
---
The game is in massive decline, thats clearly visable from the login numbers all of us have access to.
---
Currently working on some spreadsheets with the fuzzworks dumps to pull materials for ships then pull market data and find buy orders in the local/near regions where for what I can build would be the most profitable. 
---
Lots of csvs and I'm tempted to get into SQL to manage it a bit better.
---
or, it's not meaningless because the giant spampire blobs are now having to reckon with some kind of cost for their structure spam and economic hyperactivity.
---
Oh, did the proce go up again? Saw a stack of 10 Nyx hulls for 90b in 1DQ on contracts last year
---
Time to learn then
---
yeah i do - they should never have made jump gates fatigueless. but they should also never have allowed infinite structure spam with so little disincentive. this isn't perfect, but it's a start - i bet people will be thinking twice before throwing down morale keepstars and rando astras in every system.
---
I'm a bit late with posting, but yesterday I got my first cap and undocked it just to look at it. It may only be an archon but I really like the way it looks. I hope I can actually use it for something though
---
did you even listen to the recording? it is structure bashing. we are going to go hit hisec industry hubs
---
Jesus fuck, stop pinging for everything. It's like any content is worth calling for help over with how little everyone undocks
---
Hams are high slot modules ya dingus.
---
I feel personally attacked.

I'm guessing Provi leadership wasn't invited to the channel.

People getting their asses handed to them by NPCs so they're not logging and talking shit on reddit instead.
---
Fact is the game aged not well, and i often read in threads where people ask if eve is worth it, 90 % of the time the same stuff over and over again like in 2009. For new players in this day and age its important to deliver a solid experience, and sort of a narrative, even for a sandbox mmo, in which eve sadly lacks. Meaningfull PvP is a joke in itself, cause it will have no impact due to larg alliances which drown in isk. Ship variety is still medicore, since i last stopped playing, not many were added. As a industry sim, eve realy shines, hands down, no other online game has such a good player driven economy. And than you have the community, oh boy, lets say a lot of the players are realy nice, well educated, social competent, but the majority of the players are just scum. Thats eve in a nutshell 😂
---
You gotta appease the masses who can't do it themselves. Pull them off minecraft and back into the game with a ping. Otherwise why does discord even exist.
---
Haha, I remembered when this happened. It was pretty fucking hilarious.
---
Ended up not getting the Hel :C
---
Our HIC was unable to get back to the fight in time because they were asking for someone to pod them but no one did it.
---
If a super carrier isn’t worth pinging for then what is 🤔
---
yes
---
Wait we've been doing that for ages though
---
Unironically, no we won't.  This event changes nothing but our faith in CCP's ability to understand nullsec.
---
It's still active and had the last patch a few days ago with some rebalance changes. Just not published or widely distributed
---
It's simply an example of an unanticipated condition that hadn't been accounted for. I'm sure they're looking at it trying to decide how they can adjust to the loss of the anchor/FC. According to CCP, the new NPC fleets have an FC.
---
For everyone to dock up.
---
You can watch it from BjornBees perspective too at http://www.twitch.tv/bjornbee/v/445825674?sr=a&amp;t=10s
---
Add it to the list of things CCP doesn't know they don't understand.  Bomber FCs have been doing this in null for a decade.  There's no excuse not to know about the strategy.
---
Or is it cause your naglfar died so quickly?
---
It's great, fleets of them are nigh indestructible
---
LOL
---
Can someone give me a tl;dl?
---
wait until they realize that highsec has lost 80% of it's playerbase in the last 4 years
---
c5/c6 space is empty holy fuck nobody plays in c5/c6 space anymore games dead
---
Do you realize the fireside lasted for 50 minutes and the person who made this recording intentionally cut it off after 20 minutes?
---
CCP fucks with Nullsec, Nullsec fucks with the rest of New Eden. No single raw material import from any nullsec bloc anymore
---
Fuck highsec fuck ccp
---
Maybe so, or maybe they had a fallback behavior that didn't work correctly? Hard to say
---
All these flavors and you choose salty
---
I completely agree!
---
Hell yes it is. You can live out thw worst in you as long as it stays in the boundaries of the game. Just dont ever go after the real person behind it. Noone sheds a tear if you go after the ingame character.
---
Oh, weird. It doesn't show up if you try to look for kills here https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/
---
That's something I was concerned with when I first started playing a couple years ago -- I joined a game with nearly a decade and a half of empire-building and a complex political landscape, how could I possibly contribute to that in a meaningful way?
---
I took the advice of several people on another site and applied to Karmafleet while I tried to find my space-legs and, once accepted, I was able to get into fleets and start learning the ins and outs of the game.  More importantly, I found a supportive and welcoming community with a wealth of informative resources and a variety of programs  geared toward getting new players involved with minimal investment.  Not a bad thing when I arrived in nullsec with nothing but a rookie ship and a slowly growing collection of ship lossmails.
---
I won't say I was particularly effective on my first day or week or month but between the free ships to keep me in the fight and our new player help channels kept me engaged so I could get out, get blown up, learn a thing or two in the process and do it all over again without needing to grind away NPCs or mine asteroids to fund my adventures.  Over time, I found a few roles I enjoyed that didn't need a ton of skills right off the bat.  Entry level logistics (healer) ships don't take much to get into and can be the difference between winning and losing a fight.  They definitely benefit from additional skill investment but there's a lot you can do without months of training.
---
Electronic warfare is another great way to go out and have an impact on the fight early on -- without getting too into the weeds with it, you can fly these cheap little ships and severely limit enemy effectiveness in a variety of ways.  This also makes you a priority target if you're doing it right so you also learn a lot about how not to get killed.
---
If you're interested in playing, don't let these concerns hold you back.  Give it a shot, find a good nullsec group to join and get involved with the community.  I've got some biases with regard to which groups are worth joining but as long as you don't get stuck in an NPC starter corp forever, it's hard to go wrong.  Nothing to lose but time and you might just find you enjoy it.
---
Hail Cane
---
Mittani can't handle having the drifters attacking his structure sprawl so is 'declaring war on CCP and high sec' by stopping null sec exports from goons. He's trying to get other 0.0 entities to help him. All this after bragging about being 'the most organised coalition' that can easily handle it.
---
The brutality of the game was a big draw for me!
---
Stupid stupid grif
---
It feels like everybody here came up with a better concept of what a Drifter invasion would be like than CCP did. Which doesn't surprise me.
---
You've gotta start somewhere.
---
Remember when people had comms and would just be on there if they're online and only ping for a POS fight?
---
I think this is what they call catastrophising in psychology.
---
&gt; because the giant spampire blobs are now having to reckon with some kind of cost for their structure spam and economic hyperactivity.
---
That's what we're *hoping*, but what we've seen so far is more indication that CCP has dropped the ball again, as usual. Time will tell what comes of this, but right now nobody's reckoning with anything, just wiping the floor with Drifter guts.
---
Is capital ship production possible to do alone? If yes, what are the biggest mistakes I should avoid?
---
I have enough ISK to buy most of the BPOs to build carrier parts + niddhogur BPO
---
That's basically how nullsec works.
---
&gt; How I see it is there are a lot players that don’t take responsibility for their own PvP content. They sit in large alliances and mine or rat until a ping comes.
---
Before I quit, I went on daily, even bi-daily, fleets. Far too often, either nobody would come fight us or somebody would drop supers/carriers on us. The random one or two ships we managed to kill by happenstance isn't worth mentioning. There's only so much roaming you can do with no meaningful fights before you just play Tabletop Simulator with your corpmates instead and actually have fun.
---
Well that's a most logical response. I think.
---
Null groups screeching cause they have vast swaths of space they can’t defend against an npc. The fact that an npc fleet has caused so much mayhem and salt is astounding and amazing.
---
ok so waaay out of the loop, what was mittens having a breakdown over? and how beautiful was it?
---
Please contract me some of your stuff before heading out.
---
There is crying. There is pouting. Then there is this. Word suggestions?
---
guess we'll see!
---
I'd say the system is broken if it can be exploited by any one group to such an extent like GSF has. You can't expect people *not* to mercilessly exploit any issues that the game's design has. The game's design *needs* to be improved in meaningful ways to prevent balancing issues like this, but CCP has continuously made the problem worse (or just not touched the issue at all).
---
what a pompous asshat his head needs to shrink a little...he is not eve online but he most certainly thinks he is...i don't get all the people who drink his Kool-aid...he has become what he thinks he's trying to destroy...
---
Good post
---
We're all just ugly bags of mostly water
---
mfw the only content in a player-driven game is PvE
---
Oh I'm not going anywhere, I'll ride this cart into the ground if I can!
---
&gt; nobody wants to at least ship in to some cheap shit and harass them? Pop a few things? Anything?
---
The trouble is that with the umbrella, with citadel grid mechanics and with logi, you won't pop anything. Visiting a hostile system without capital superiority on standby is just a feed for no gain, and that's bad game design.
---
Because we are
---
Why do you keep relying. Are you querns lawyer? 2006 SA, 2009 goonfleet. What year did you j4g in?
---
you say that, but as it stands dran is here vomiting words in what amounts to a two-faced complaint in which he claims the event is both nbd and really annoying. at the same time, mittani is throwing a mega-tantrum and is claiming he has had to call off the invasion of the north because of it.  
---
now either this shit is ultra annoying and will result in behaviour changes on the part of the null blocs, or it isn't in which case it's no big deal and nobody should be complaining about it. but it can't be both at the same time. but given the hullabaloo this is raising from the bigwigs, i know what my money's on.
---
Mail 'll anum' ingame, he will help you out.
---
Starbase looks cool
---
&gt; You should be blaming poor game design
---
You mean the ability to drop a million structures for basically zero upkeep cost or effort?
---
I don’t like yours
---
among other things, yes
---
Drifters attacking their structure spam
---
&gt; mittani is throwing a mega-tantrum and is claiming he has had to call off the invasion of the north because of it. 
---
This was pretty much before we figured out the full extent of the "invasion".  
---
&gt; dran is here vomiting words in what amounts to a two-faced complaint  
---
His complaint is that we all expected so much more CCP and CCP hasn't delivered. Yet again. The invasion has turned out to not be a big deal. That's the big deal. Yes, that's a thing. If you can't wrap your head around that, I can't help you.
---
oh they did, did they? do go on
---
Yeah I am waiting until Gobbins, Hedliner, and Vince talk about this before I give it much weight.
---
Sir Molle Mittens does seem to have his knickers in a twist now though.
---
And they will keep having many citadels, because CCP are retarded to think this event will change anything.
---
how good was his freakout? is there a link
---
And how many caps did they have? Could they build a new one in a Delve hour or whatever it is? Goons are so far ahead of where anyone else has ever been in Eve.
---
&gt; He's trying to get other 0.0 entities to help him
---
I think they want to help.  They don't like the drifter attacks anymore than he does.
---
You're as big a drama queen as he is, without the eloquence.
---
Been around since 2006. Feels like I've seen everything. But one of my most memorable EVE experiences was getting pipebombed by RnK. I was fucking psyched at the time.
---
Only a fool would have thought that Goons would never bounce back from WWB. Sticking with them was a no brainer for anyone who could look at the big picture instead of just tomorrow.
---
I mean, if you look at the alliances that ditched them during and after... CO2, SMA, FCON, they're all dead. And Razor is an absolute disgrace compared to what they once were.
---
it was not that bad but now all the null blocks am joining up to fuck low sec n hisec starting with the markets then moving to blowing up production stations, the scary thing is mittans and the others am talking so no more null wars
---
I am glad that at least one person on this sub is paying attention to what crap CCP are actually stirring up these days.
---
So what you are asking for is TiDikrabbing because you don't care about making more ISK anymore.  
---
That will work out great I'm sure
---
It's essentially a handful of logistics people vs infinite waves of NPC's for 12 hours a day, every day.
---
Is there nothing Goons won't cry about?
---
Oh really? Is it still being worked on? I still being on the Discord back when it was shut down and it became harder to get. Can you pm me a link?
---
Let’s hope they hit goons the hardest
---
My favorite part is when the leader of a group that holds nearly 2/3 the player base refers to anyone and everyone else as "pubbies". Uhhhhhh
---

https://www.reddit.com/user/Lostvision the man who crawled through 11 years of shit and came out clean the other end. https://www.reddit.com/user/Lostvision "You know, the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man, straight as an arrow, I had to come to EVE to be a crook."
---
&gt;Does it require a myopic viewpoint to understand?
---
Yes, because, on r/Eve, Bee man bad, or Goons so salty, will get you updoots.  he is just riding the free Karma train for fake internet points.
---
Given CCPs history, thats an absurd statement.
---
Aryth needs a new fucking mic.
---
He's attacking highsec.
---
So I'd say it was a pretty good freakout.
---
You're the one who's supposedly in goons and not a NC/PL sockpuppet. You tell me.
---
According to OP, it is volunary.
---
Nothing voluntary about rats shooting your structures.
---
I was off for a few weeks, what's the new drama?
---
What structure spam lol
---
wew lad
---
Nothing is on fire, blown way out of proportion.
---
How dared you challenge the nerds' excitement in this sub?
---
They were dribbling all over the place, memeing. So sad for them now..
---
I love it
---
First trip into null, back in early 2007. I was like 5 months I the game, had been in AWECO's training corp RESA, and my little graduating class flew down a kitchen sink fleet of "the biggest ships you can fly" to escort a few of oldma, dibrle, and blue max's freighters into feythabolis where they lived in ASCN.
---
Turned out 100% uneventful iirc, but was crazy for me as a relative newb carebear who had never played MMOs in a remotely hardcore way to spend hours on edge supporting freighters on the long trip into deep null.
---
Dude stop lying eve isn't losing players nor are they losing playstyles
---
&gt; Sticking with them was a no brainer for anyone who could look at the big picture instead of just the immediate situation.
---
Easy to say in hindsight, especially when, as you yourself point out, so many didn't see it that way. Things didn't look *quite* so straightforward around May 2016.
---
Ultimately, INIT as an alliance certainly isn't as strong as TEST, and in terms of deployable supercapitals is no stronger than and potentially still weaker than NCdot. Even when NCdot and PL were relatively much stronger than they are now, they didn't for an instant consider a global reset. When those alliances which are stronger than us feel that the state of the game and the mechanics behind it can support them going 'trusolo' in sov null, we'll consider it. Until then I think we can hardly be blamed for doing what everyone else in sov 0.0 has done since 2007 and continues to do to this day, and to view any attempt to persuade us otherwise as frankly pretty feeble agitprop.
---
Simple and Easy are not the same thing.  Losing weight is simple, calories in &lt; calories out.  But losing weight is not easy.
---
This event is simple, it is not easy.  Uncomplicated tedious mechanics.
---
There's also no indication that the spawns are remotely related to structure count.  They pick the same systems over and over and not all of them have a lot of cits in them.
---
Ikr I'm just as sad
---
it hasnt even been..what 3 days?  and people think this will cause the end?  seriously?
---
You can choose to ignore them.
---
Scope is always fun to listen to.  
---
I hope the sleepers try invade wormholes next &gt;:D

massive decline?

login numbers?

i dont see a massive decline.  AT ALL

Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box.Touch and hold a clip to pin it. Unpinned clips will be deleted after 1 hour.&gt;
---
Gilding your own video of you bashing structures spod bless
---
Why would you want to limit yourself to one race in this game?
---
Is is some goldshire/RPsexthing?
---
You already can, it's called the ADM.
---
I don't know who made that face but I owe them some ISK lol. I stole that shit because it looked like Steve Jobs as a Drifter.
---
nice meme
---
Guys, just wait. The triglavian invasion took 3 weeks to fully develop. It's possible, this is only the first stage. And the second stages will be followup fleets
---
What a hero. God bless you kind sir
---
That's a weird statment, something can absolutely be both easy to manage while being annoying to manage.
---
It may be easy but is it fun? if its not fun its annoying. Also even easy thing to manage can in large quantities lead to burnout. Not saying this is going to do that but its still valid.
---
It was some good screeching. The salinity was high.  Drifters got em ruffled.
---
Tama area. Amamake area.
---
It’s not the same.
---
&gt; You went to shoot structures...as per statement from other goons. 
---
yes we did.
---
&gt; Your dear leader said you won and you had most fun ever? 
---
He did say we won, because our objective was met. He did not say we had fun. Because it was not fun. But we did it anyway.
---
&gt;  Everyone is happy if there is a way to deal with a citadel spam 
---
Citadel spam is a legit problem. You know who would know that better than anyone currently? The people who just spent 6 weeks shooting them. I'm sick to death of grinding through them. It would be impossible to purge delve, even if we did it ourselves.
---
&gt; The current event is hitting your enemies 
---
Yes and they're pissed. You're posting in a thread from TEST. They're pissed. GOTG is pissed. FRT had one of their Keepstars reffed in the middle of a hot war, obviously they're pissed. Do you think elo knight wants to shoot NPC's? Horde are throwing corm fleets at the problem. How long do you think that's going to be fun for? Not very long. At the very least, the FC's will get sick of it.
---
&gt; only goons that are bitching hard 
---
wrong.
---
&gt;  you guys have spread across half the fucking map 
---
Up until recently, we had two and a half regions. Delve, Querious, and the bottom half of Fountain. We recently took over PB, and we're hardly using it for anything. If it wasn't us, no one would be there anyway. We're one of the largest alliances in the game. We are far, far more dense than any of the other coalitions. Legacy owns a massive amount of space. GOTG has spread from pure blind all the way to tenal now. NCPL have big chunks of the norther, plus the majority of the drone regions.
---
&gt; and have plopped keepstars every few jumps 
---
and they're all used. Do you think we just drop them for fun?
---
&gt; And basically you are among the biggest offenders of the citadel spam 
---
They're all there for a reason. I completely agree that it's too much work to purge a region of citadels. I just spent a whole fucking month doing it, and they had 1/10th the number in tribute that we do in delve. But this mechanic is just shit. It's garbage.
---
there 100% needs to be an easier way to see index and index delta than showing info on each individual system
---
Here comes Burn HS
---
It's a little abstracted, but it's comprised of all three indices. One can make some basic inferences based on ADM if one has even a tiny inkling of intelligence floating around in his or her skull.
---
Looks good! If I get spare time I may help flushing out all the endpoints.
---
You and most others. My regular games look very much alike. The other lists in the thread look vey similar too. There aren't that many good companies or decent devs out there, hence the lists of the non-mmo games looking very alike, and mmo ones - almost non-existent, apart from very few examples. EvE being one of them.
---
your zkill says you are a person of a corp i never heard of, that killed some people in pvp. like a couple hundred thousands other people in this game did.  
---
and a min of google-fu doesn't turn up anything, so your deeds can't be that great i guess.  
---
the reason for my initial comment was the incredible effort you are putting behind slandering red frog, which is just a bit too much effort for someone thats just merely some rando thats disappointed in RFF. and your overblown responses kinda don't help your case tbh.
---
What exactly is stopping you from making a channel, posting the indices in there all the time and then using a tool to read from that channel? 🤔
---
I missed that it was oversized, apologies.
---
NC. doesn't have any structures, so they could.
---
&gt;I'm not sure how a single paragraph pointing out that it's beyond developing a single statement to implement the behavior that's being referred to is being "needlessly pedantic", a little insulting maybe.
---
Where you lead with this:
---
&gt;I think you're missing quite a lot of variables in your codebase there.
---
It's obviously not a codebase and greatly simplified. You can explain that it's more than a simple switch without being a full, "*WELL AKTCHUALLY*" shithead about it.
---
&gt;I don't know the limitations of their design tools anymore than anyone else does that hasn't worked with them. I was simply pointed out that their criticism of the lack of a Drifter response to reinforcement timers is more than likely due the fact that they have not developed the functions to implement it yet. The argument being that CCP just has an "On/Off" switch they could be using and just refuse to.
---
No one was making the argument that there's an 'On/Off' switch to be flipped, you actually began  that by saying that you don't believe CCP is at a point to where they can make Drifters follow-up attacks. 
---
What everyone *else* has been saying is that **making** them follow-up on timers is something that should be within their means by leveraging existing their existing trigger/event system, if they so desired.
---
&gt;I'm sure you probably are more versed than I am given your claim of being a game programmer who has worked with CCP, so you would know better than most.
---
That's not what I said, but you don't seem to be reading anything with much concern about its contents.
---
What I said, is that I am a professional MMO programmer who currently works with ex-CCP programmers at my current studio. I have never worked for, or with, CCP.
---
&gt;From your response though, even you admit that there could be limitations based on the developer tools available that would need additional programming to implement properly. That being said, I doubt you would want to simply start spawning Drifter fleets out of nowhere on top of every structure they've reinforced. I would think they would want it to be a more organic behavior that fits in to the current system that they're using for spawn behavior.
---
That's a design question, and deflecting from the point of discussion you began. Besides, you can limit the number of timers to be followed-up-upon in various ways so you're not spawning Drifters everywhere.
---
&gt;So where in my statements am I wrong and where is somebody else saying "CCP just sucks and doesn't want to do it" right?
---
Nowhere and neither, because you're arguing details of means where the original poster was arguing end results. You don't **need** an organic, AI-driven decision making process to achieve the result the comment-chain starter wants, which is the point being made.
---
I feel like the hardest part will be the market lol, seeing as there are so many endpoints there
---
that would be very helpful! thanks!
---
I think (and it's hard to tell because evidently being detailed in a post is a lost art in 2019) hes saying that things like near2 and taco give the krabby a huge amount of detail for defense (one might even say its retarded that CCP let's programs like these exist) and hed like some tools to help the hunter.
---
I think he just needs a be a little more proficient with the tools that exist but w/e.
---
if you pvp'd at all you'd know there's information that the adm does not provide and is not available any other way besides show info on individual systems
---
industrial index delta for instance
---
And it’s completely fine that these other 3rd party applications audibly tell you when there was a faction spawn, site is done, and enemy is nearby while user has minimal input to the 5+ clients VNI rafting or rorq mining..
---
There’s very little counter play to this and only true way around it is to blue scout. Why in the world should I sub another account just to kill someone?
---
Covering it all with a paintbrush to give ADM indexes is still too obscure.
---
Hah, I'm the dude who made this. Glad you guys enjoyed my shit meme
---
it's not about having a source for the indexes out of game, it's about having a way to aggregate the indexes (and their deltas) and detect changes
---
for instance, pulling the industrial index for an entire region and combing for systems with positive delta gives you systems with mining activity in the last hour
---
&gt; Mittens is definitely unhappy
---
[Good](https://i.imgur.com/8hPWQY8.jpg)
---
I approve of this service announcement.
---
But I'd approve more if you added FETA and mushrooms....
---
Very good initial stab at the probable mechanics.
---
Take your upvote!
---
Once the index hits 5, there’s no way of telling how much the index has gone up. Just gives a nice little up green arrow or down red arrow.
---
Cool! I really wanted to do some ESI with NodeJS and I might try to use your library to start off! :)
---
On the payment thing, I think CCP scrapped that aspect of it? There's still a license you must agree to, but there's no monetary exchange afaik these days. Perhaps a more active third party dev could try and confirm this.
---
So today marks the first day of what shall forever be known as "The Pubbie War"?
---
Imagine creating a channel to say M-OEE8’s industry index is going up lmao
---
For eve it’s like 10+ years lol
---
Who the fuck forms muninns to kill a super.
---
CCP will probably have them start killing structures soonish once they burn out people.  Burn out people by blueballing timers you make is a classic invasion strategy.  So this could just be the first wave.
---
Also people have to show regardless as there is a chance for a follow up killing something important.
---
Grath pls... I try with what I got and it’s still not enough :pepehands:
---
That shit was HILARIOUS.
---
In pyfa, no one knows I'm shit.
---
Jspace is best space. Be spooky.
---
Fine. Change it. Make it one Keepstar per constellation, one Fortizar per system. They've already been nerfing anom respawn rates. Give anom rats interdictors, and put a dozen tackle frigs in every site to make carrier ratting actually dangerous for once. Go fucking nuts with all of the above. There's plenty they can do if that's the goal, and there is plenty we can do to adapt to it.
---
Rats pinging dozens of citadels at random every day is just objectively terrible gameplay.
---
around 1800+ ppl actually =)
---
hmm, ima hafta look. maybe r/evetech can answer that question
---
The reward would be keeping your space safe.  I'm not trying to be snarky as i believe we've gotten too safe in null
---
People likely to have to deal with a Munin based fleet defending the super.
---
imagine ever logging into eve without knowing there was content to be had before you launched the game
---
CCP probably thought that in order for Goons to care they have to be hit much harder than everyone else.
---
Oh that's right , you think Eve IS real life. How sad! It must so confusing to live life that way.
---
2real, though normally it's to save a super
---
I agree with you on almost all of the above.
---
No one is disagreeing that there needs to be change.
---
If CCP's intent was actually intended to address ANY of that with this drifter thing though (which we don't know for sure, because they haven't said shit about it), then they really outdid themselves on the laziness front, and it will have very bad consequences for the game.
---
All it reminds me off is the Flood. Only this Flood does not infect but rather have infinite amounts of ships to throw against the players. Maybe we should be building a ring like weapon that can eradicate all sentient life on a galaxy wide scale and reseed the galaxy with new players that will hopefully learn from our mistakes.
---
No need to apologize my dude
---
Hey! I still identify as a new player and i started 2012..
---
also music choice is crap.
---
&gt;What exactly is stopping you from making a channel, posting the indices in there all the time and then using a tool to read from that channel?
---
Then do what taco and near2 do, make an ingame channel, have your bros input the info, and write a tool that reads the log file.
---
Your "average line" is the record of the past year. Currently the game is dropping under the numbers of before alpha clones were introduced. And that after an influx of 2000 chinese players. The last number someone tried to bring up to say *its not so bad* was *only* 13% less average logins than last year. Again, after the serenity influx. Why do you try to lie to yourself so desparately?
---
we should start a gofundme
---
i guess the message is : only have as many citadels as you can easily defend: but then again why make it some arbitrary busywork number of citadels instead of having players be able to meaningfully interact with them?
---
RIP
---
Shut up, renter bot. :-)
---
nice. I can get more Profits if goons stop exporting to highsec
---
You literally have to click system by system to read each SOV index. Along with that, it’s subjective for each client and not the same.
---
Test it out with your main and an alt on an active system. Sometimes you’ll get a neutral index reading and on the other client showing increasing indexes.
---
About this good |&lt;------------&gt;|
---
Sure. Let's remove Asset Safety from null so players have an incentive to do the job themselves.
---
whether or not you agree with asset safety doesn't make the busywork drifters any less dumb
---
Im starting eve and saw something about a referal link.  Making my account now, does anyone have a link? and do i just use it in game?

you could delete half of the assets of eve players randomly, and it'd generate a ton of salt, but be bad for the game
---
you know what. if you think EVE is dying. then gtfo.
---
i've seen dying games. they dont have anywhere near 37k players.
---
they tend to stick around maybe 1000 to 4000.   see Mabinogi.
---
and they still live for years and years.   Mabi is dying, and yet is still profiting.
---
is WoW dying?  its got a fraction of its historical peak players.  unlike EVE who has more % wise.
---
right now EVE has 37k,  which if you expand that map,  is the average for the game over ITS ENTIRE LIFE.   
---
for a game pushing EVE's age, thats not only impressive. that shows its very much alive and not dying yet.
---
Well, structure spam has to be limited one way or another. Null needs to be hard to live in. If you can just sit and krab all day with minimal if any risk then there's something wrong.
---
Just wait. It is coming dran.
---
&gt; Well, structure spam has to be limited one way or another.

how about through player interaction?

You suck at English, friend, as bad as you suck at researching a player on zkill.   That's not libel, either, nor is anything that I said about Red Frog et al.  They are shit tier shitters and deserve to be called out for it. Black Frog no longer displays their queue anymore, because ESI broke their old website, and despite ESI having been around for like 2 years they still haven't fixed it.  You'd think they'd figure it out after this long, especially since someone managed to get the Red Frog queue to work.   Hell, you can even still follow links on their own website to the old Black Frog queue that doesn't even fucking work any more.
---
That is seriously, majorly, lowest of the low tier shit.
---
I'm down ..see you guys when I can.  Looking forward to learning
---
ok then retard
---
and just how many hours have you been playing for now?
---
Cool. Remove local and asset safety, which the recent Scope seems to suggest might happen.
---
Idk why you're so full of expletives. A person using that much to convey their argument is weak.
---
Looks like Tri just dunked in with Muninns
---
How many faction forts are there in 1DQ?
---
bad words hurt my feelings;__;
---
fuck off retard
---
i'm for both of those things, but even if i wasn't ais creating busywork for people is bad regardless
---
Three. My ISK is on three.
---
idk at this point, however 1dq (the most spammed system in the game) hasn't been hit (yet)
---
And what brilliant chain of logic led to this insightful idea?
---
Lol you missed my point. Typical of a child.
---
Keep thinking you're effective though... I'm sure you're a riot and people enjoy your company 🤣
---
what exactly do you consider to be an expletive? Because I don't see any, and no dick doesn't count.
---
We were going back this weekend anyway. (Yes there was some discussion about continuing, but it wasn't going to happen) We rushed back a few days early, because all of a sudden we had all our key logistics people scrambling to deal with hundreds of citadel pings, sorting our ACL's, refitting shit-fit citadels, getting ammo and bombs built etc etc. All to deal with this shit. We also didn't know if it would escalate, and if so, how much. (Turns out it did escalate, this morning, which wasn't a huge surprise)  
---
It was less to do with getting the people and supers home as it was getting the bulk of the move ops out of the way as quickly as possible, and put us in a position to respond to whatever is coming next. Which we still don't know either.
---
Bait post. Nice try! You can't be that much of a fool...
---
I have been playing 10 years - CCP keeps the buy plex for isk model, Bitvets dont need to buy higher priced skillbooks AND get more inexperienced targets to kill and loot.  New players dont need to wait months and months to catch up.   It basically just cuts out the middle man of sp farmers...
---
But I  could be convinced otherwise
---
I just upvoted a globby post, guess there really is a first time for everything.
---
If you're a blue donut, I don't see how you don't have the numbers to deal with it tbh.
---
See their response
---
I dont know, I wish that was true.  The people in Templis were the most normal, nicest people I ever played with until they let a guy in from a notorious trolling Corp.  Then decided to start fleeting up with honorable third party.
---
If I said some of the crap I have heard in comms by accident t work I would get fired.  It's the west coast us time zone thing of non stop sarcasm, edgy comments and whatnot.  EUTZ is alright imo.  But it is a cancer that is spreading.  Friends I used to play with that are friendly and decent dont play anymore.  
---
I dont think I could ever log on to this game again after my last week of being profanely abused on Discord by a Dirt N Glitter member, and having a 40 year old obese man yelling "shove your tongue up my ass" multiple times in comms during a fleet, this just doesn't bring happiness.  
---
They say you are the average of the company you keep.  I dont want to leave Eve but its over.
---
someone disagreeing with you does not mean he's in a blue donut, neither being able to deal with something makes it good
---
Tests ceo was crying non stop the other day so it seems like they're also struggling. You'd think people that rat so often would be able to handle some more rats.
---
but you complained about expletives before that response was posted.
---
Get flairbated, foo

iirc something similar happened back in the technetium cartel days and it didn't actually end up being a big deal.
---
Whatttt? Plex is 2.1 billion now?

I mean, logserver exists, right? Just use that. I mean, I know it's not technically allowed, but, c'mon. C'mon.

You confuse me with someone who can argue their stance.

I dunno, is it okay? And even if it wasn't, it has nothing to do with your ask. Shit ain't a zero sum game.

That can only come from someone who lurks in #help

If these 30-years adults with serious addiction to a virtual game want to "wage war" againts other players who has nothing to do with what is happening, then please, CCPLEASE, give them what they want. A war. Send them thousands upon thousands of Drifter fleets. BURN. IT. ALL.   
---
They are all bunch of  megalomaniacs, who thinks there is only ONE way to play this game, their way, and forces it upon everyone else. Now, since this is the internet, there will always be some people who are okay with serving a sociopath. Maybe it is their fetish, who knows? Doesn't matter. Majority of players like this event.  Majority of sane players with self-respect already left the game and we see all time low PCU every passing year. Why? Because game has become stagnant. And the reason is sandcastle building race amongst Nullblocks. EvE is a sandbox for us all. NOT YOURS ALONE. And CCP has the right to do whatever they want with this game. If you don't like what is happening, tell CCP why, write on forums, talk to CSM, whatever. Just stop being such egoistic bastards that you feel the need to ruin everyone elses game just because you think your way of gameplay is ruined.
---
fucking chill bro...
---
Sure, but it exists now. Use what you got. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good, and all that.
---
Are you literally elevetaing the current player numbers by mixing them into an average with the time when the game was at its peak while blatantly ignoring that the current average playercount is far below the one from that time? The average yearly playercount is going down, not in a straight line but nevertheless visible. This is whats called decline. Alphas caught it a bit but that  cushion is evidently at its limit. I don't know what you're smoking but you gotta let me have some of it lmao

Temper tantrums are fun to watch..... crying they are too easy, crying they are too OP, crying the never follow through.. yet crying the have to defend, crying you have to logon... tears tear tears..
---
Yeah, no. Most people in Eve are all for new blood into the game. Most will kill you, loot your stuff, then help them, give them advice and a little ISK, pointing them in the right direction.
---
When was gsf founded?
---
Hell in the original Black Legion we did use them to kill supers... But we also used sail boats (auto tempests with neuts) which were way better for cap kills
---
Another fun propaganda shoop.
---
they literally anchored a keep, like dude you can even dock you supercaps on the forward staging lmao
---
I quit years ago. I sold two characters who have to be in the 200 million sp range, and I just came back two months ago, starting the grind from scratch.
---
That said, I am proof you suck and your ideas are stupid.
---
why?
---
Race all over a region lol. Do you not have interceptors or bridges(
---
Because your ideas are stupid.
---
When did Care Factor and Hispania change sides?
---
Ships count as ammo. You use it, it explodes, you load another and do it again.
---
You'll learn more from losing than from winning. killboards mean nothing.
---
Aim to get a new ship you want to fly and do so, isk shouldn't be an incentive in itself.
---
Have fun.
---
far below the peak?
---
dude...go look at player populations of any game from their peak.  and name ONE game that maintained even 60% of its peak playerbase after a few years!
---
ffs World of Tanks, League of Legends, DOTA2, WoW, and on and on.   none of those populations are even close to 50% of their peak playerbase.   unlike EVE who is around to slightly above that 50% line.
---
ffs WoT has a record for concurrent users at 815,000 in russia alone.
---
but now,  russia had at best estimate maybe 200,000 in russia.    and barely 40k in US.   its doing worse than EVE in terms of player retention.  but its not dead
---
you're dumb
---
Make the fuel cost scale exponentially with the number of structures in system.
---
2 citadels each use twice the fuel. 3 citadels use 4x each. 4 citadels 8x each.
---
It eve everything hard. But in a nutshell join a corporate/alliance that designed to help new players. Personally I suggest a null alliance. Gsf test panfam are some of the better ones.
---
it's not about not having the numbers, everyone has the numbers, it's just a bunch of gay busywork
---
**It's a start, but it could use some work.**
---
For starters, it would be best to replace the pineapples on the low slot with more ham or another beefy module - this will increase your total EHP and will keep you alive for longer against hungry EVE players.
---
If you want, you can add a cheese module (warp stabilizer) to get out of a hairy situation. Nobody wants hair in their pizza right?
---
As for the mid slots, it's OK, but it needs a bit more variety. Instead of the 4 pineapple slots which are being used as what appears to be a fast tackle fit. Since nobody wants to stay near pineapple pizza you should scram them and force them to stay on grid by using specific pizza faction mods. Also, try adding some bacon bits on half the pizza. Adding this will increase your max DPS by an astonishing amount, since any enemy would succumb to the mighty wrath of delicious bacon.
---
That said, the composition will be 2 pineapples, 1 bacon, and, how about some extra sauce (target painting)?
---
As for the high slots? Definitely consider jalapenos (smartbombs). Why? Because they do AOE thermal damage and it's absolutely brutal towards those smaller folks who can't tolerate that much. If you go for the homegrown (capital) jalapenos, you'll be giving the player a hell of a time.
---
The rigs are fine as is, by the way.
---
**Here's the fit.**

---
Let me know how it works for you! I'd like to get some more input so we can get this saucy ship on the field. ♥
---
noob, just hire clickfarm workers to manually update your map
---
adapt or die retard
---
to be fair 60 ferox's in a horde fleet is a wee bit so you were right to begin with
---
Imagine if people made an effort for a common cause in this game? 
---
Thats all goons are doing. The imperium circled the wagons held hands and said never again, and now everyone else is crying about.
---
Once you are over losses the game is more fun
---
You can go all out, invest in something like AlphaGo or as Dran suggests, you can actually use a lot of tricks that create illusions of being fully dynamic.
---
The best thing is that CCP has the data, they could compose fleets that take the actions of other player fleets, pretty much replay them at other players.
---
1. You want to know where targets are. 
---
2. You want to be able to jump into system, warp straight to the target without it warping away before you land. 
---
3. You don't want the target to light a cyno and get saved by a huge fleet. 
---
4. You want the target to be easy to kill (as opposed to being a super or titan). 
---
So what CCP could do is have this window called "the agency", that shows places you can warp to where targets don't warp away when you come to stomp them, and these targets don't call for help, and they always have more ships for you to destroy tomorrow, and none of the targets have 50M EHP.
---
That sounds like a really cool story, perhaps you should tell it again?
---
Its not hard at all. Vale is still on fire.
---
SO they are not absolute cancer?  I don't see CCP doing anything anytime in the near future to have less revenue - just offering an alternative that benefits long time players.
---
Could you elaborate why it might be a bad idea?
---
I picked up a “Serpentis copper tag”, it says something about turning it into “proper authority’s”.
---
Who are these authorities and where can I find them?
---
Don't focus on your killboard, focus on having fun. Fly crazy shit and see what happens. If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid. If anyone loses their shit over your KB, ignore them.
---
Seems to me you would directly benefit - you cashed out on your high sp pilots and could in theory do quite well with the experience you have.
---
NPSI\* Please edit.   
---
Also... you forgot to mention how your space is been taken, and the crazy amount of losses you guys have had during this last two weeks :) Who needs supers and caps anyway right? :'D

Good luck with XHQ and JEIVE.
---
but le salt xD
---
The end has come. Rejoice children in the current crisis that /u/ccp has made for all of Nullsec. May our deaths as Capsuleers bring about a new age.
---
Best habit is to leave this reddit and never return. It could be to late though
---
OmG
---
if you need any more evidence (as if the past few years wasn't enough) of CCP not giving a fuck about maintaining a semblance of balance then here you go
---
Considering how well received, "Burn Null Sec" was received, CCP might have the guts to go ahead and do it.
---
write off your ship the second you undock, you have to assume you are going to lose it or you will fight scared and lose it even faster than if you just went HAM right off the bat.
---
I would also think it is far better than CCP_Ghosts suggestion of a total server wipe.
---
Yeah. I gave all my money away. Currently training Engineering V. Like everyone should have to. Don't rob Peter to pay Paul. Just give noobs more fun shit to do while they train like everyone else had to train. 
---
Player retention is easy. Give them cool shit to do for 3 months, keep them the fuck away from null/sov for a year. Problem solved.
---
But your NPSI fleet would have shot RC too, right?
---
Im not sure someone knows how to use the BR tool. Should i fix it for them....?
---
Did you listen to it? The way we play in nullsec only got slightly annoying, we also dont do that to press our lifestyle on others, but to show CCP that we dont take that crap lightly. Sure we could go to CCP directly and cry or we do show it in the game directly. CCP doesnt like how we play the game in nullsec? Well lets show them what power we have down there.
---
Their range is eh large fleet wise. Their spooling dps is good vs small gang stuff. Anti capitals structure and wspace stuff.
---
So these games suffer from declining playernumbers too, i still don't see your point. Maybe you should grab a dictionary and look up what "decline" means before you argue something with me i didn't say.
---
Yes but everyone knows that is stpdr than stupider.
---
fine, whatever, anything is better than this
---
Made it 1min 20sec in before I had to switch that voice off.
---
It's the same discord I think, just under new management. If you don't have the discord link I can PM it to you.
---
We didnt even see them to shoot at them. In this case though it was a ~~joint~~ op and a shared objective. So no we would not of shot them today. The harb fleet today I had was put up to kill legacy in a gf. Not fight a 100 munnins in provi. However we showed face with what we had.
---
The bit about Evan is top notch
---
I still can't figure out PL picking up mclean. The only thing I can think of is they plan to use him as bait and drop on whoever tries to kill the next ratting rorq he undocks.
---
As people said, focus on fun. Don't just be an F1 monkey, find that role you think is fun. I enjoy small gangs and being the interdictor pilot, it's difficult to stay alive, but can make a huge difference to the fight.
---
***Yawn***
---
Next up? Yo mama jokes from the '90s?
---
Heh, I should make one of those my self
---
Next time just right click the ship you want to fly and go to the tab called "Requirements". 
---
This will show you any skill you need to move your butt into the hull. It doesn't mean however, that you will be able to use specific modules for the ship's fitting. These have requirements on their own aswell.
---

---
#? 
---
So many, they are now forgotten and no one cares.
---
A step or ladder function doesn't.
---
I guess I don't understand the concept of NPSI. Does the P stand for PHEW or something?
---
Goons don't care as long as they win, it's not like they really worship mittens like that. It's easy to just join goons because they are 'winning' although there are a several corps/sigs in imperium that are die hard fans of the GSF dream. They don't care how stupid mittens looks, if anything they like the attention. 
---
A key thing to note here is the mittens might seem like the god emperor but in reality his directors, and his right hand people are the ones truly in control. Mittens can't order people around unless they let him. So stop giving mittens attention (as he wants it) as he's just a figure head. He can't do shit without the real hard working individuals in the Imperium. 
---
TLDR, Mittens is just a pencil pusher, GSF leadership are the ones truly in control.
---
Being a Goon is really hard, mmm-kay
---
Have you Drifterposted so hard you made goons deploy to highsec?
---
I think this has been explained a few time in previous shit posts.  
---
NPSI is anything outside of fleet is a target. All Npsi groups work with others to achieve certain objectives.  Like taking XHQ
---
&gt;it's not like they really worship mittens like that  
---
If i look at goonposting on here some of them propably do
---
Me? Am I looking at it wrong or is the BR wrong?
---
drifters are not war. eve is a player driven game, and the drifters are basically pushing people away from player content. the best way to get through to ccp, is the fuck with hisec pubbies.
---
Surely they would just make a lot of sov holding alliances to bypass this? Goon holding A, Goon holding B, etc
---
The real way to break the blue and mega alliances is for people to stop complaining, taking who they can and forming something new. Sure it will be tough, but all they need to do is survive and harass.
---
Elite role players or just really bad case of spod brain.
---
Sounds pretty similar to real players, if I'm honest. Glad CCP figured out how to simulate real players, for when nobody else is online.
---
The br is wrong :) Like 7% of the provi fleet been dictors because they sabre wrong.
---
and maybe you should look up what dying means.
---
also. EVE isn't really declining. it settled.
---
did it decline after its peak.  yeah, otherwise its still be peaking.
---
but it settled in the 30k to 40k range. and has more or less stayed there.
---
but seriously, if you have such a problem with the game's numbers.  your free to quit any time.
---
i dont see why you play something where your just doom and gloom about.   stop being emo and go find something else

It's not just Goons who're annoyed about this.  It's all nullsec powers, including Frat, Tapi, Horde, etc.
---
John is a fuckin loser! Don't worry Rad, just kick it and flip it you're rockin the good life
---
Assuming, of course, every null bloc decides to obey mittani and fuck over the game for no benefit while some still do trade, cashing in on higher prices.
---
And then It gives CCP even more of a signal that the oversized blocs with lack of conflict kill the game and they'll likely amp things up.
---
Dont mine in hisec
---
Some really do, some just play it. You wont be able to distinguish between them.

I, as a newbro in hisec, welcome our new lowsec overlords. Did invest some ISK in minerals and am hoping to see the prices go up to make a nice profit.
---
Successfully refuse a torpedo delivery service.
---
what kind of stuff do you suggest?  you think development should focus less on players who have playing the game for a long time and focus making interesting things for new players to do?
---
The point is that goons specifically have no real reason to complain that they aren't getting their way.
---
Skillpoints and injectors do not make you good at this game...
---
Here, [fixed it for you](https://i.imgur.com/SzAfGmK.png).
---
there is a reason you see barely any old goons there anymore. Fuck pl probably has more old goons than goons themselves at this point.. they became the ultimate normie corp. 
---
Its kinda sad because one of the things that made me start playing the game was DJ's 2009(?) presentation and its attitude, just to start playing a while ago and finding out they're now worshiping a cringelord cheetodemon and need to fill fucking attendance quotas to not get kicked. Jesus christ if you're gonna rp at least *try* to not sound like you're 13 and this is your first character
---
Well I am just interested in how that plays out. All I know is that those new drifter invasions are not thought through and unrewarding to deal with. Its all a big nuisance so far. I hope CCP steps up their game.
---
Seconding this. Starbase looks cool.
---
Actually we're all really looking forward to burning your shit to the ground because that's more fun than shooting drifters
---
I mean you're not wrong...
---
Zombie bees because they convert all the weak players that don't want to be on the losing side.
---
That for sure is a flaw if this is the intended design. But I believe there is still validity to making sure an alliance owns a balanced amount of sovernity relative to their actual military power. If you guys can hold your structures and sovernity easily may be you should take some more sovernity. But if you are struggling you might want to question if your impact is beyond your means.

u mad bro?
---
Have some respect. You're shit tier.
---
I'm sorry that we've failed to live up to your expectations. How could we possibly repair our reputation? We are deeply concerned about how we're viewed by the greater community, as I'm sure you're aware.
---
maybe you should stop reading r/eve and check dotlan
---
Grrr gon man bad, bee bad!
---
Nice endgame crisis you've got yourselves there, eve guys.
---
Shh pubbie

&gt; Never forget, alcohol lowers inhibitions, [this is a look at the real Mittens](https://youtu.be/VbYNLmtAMAw), behind his facade.
---
Yay promotions!
---
The lack of self awareness here is unbelievable
---
Username checks out.
---
No banana?
---
Is it 'prop to observe that y'all volunteered to bash uncontested structures with Goons and then made a video compilation about it? Surely not. You hopped in the barrel and aimed folks' guns at your face.
---
I like you lot. You just fought against us outnumbered 2:1 (albeit on your own fort) and held your own in a great little subcap brawl in KRUN. tbh I'd like to see you guys buddy up w/Snuffed on a joint deployment or something and fucking wreck house... but I don't blame you for staying on the Goon teat; those super prices are ridiculous.
---
Hate to join in on the Goonbashing, but it always seems like Goons are always on the backfoot. Either there has been a conspiracy to smear Goons Edenwide since the beginning or Goons have deservedly earned their reputation themselves. Rather than envy, or annoyance, I think the derision for Goonswarm comes from the fact that newbies have joined Goonswarm over the years knowing their history but refuse to bear that cross with dignity and instead girn because they decided to join the 'bad guys'.

Let's be honest though, kings. Every space opera needs an evil empire, doesn't it? If they stir the pot, I'm all for it.
---
No. You can literally have thousands ... your ISK amount is your limit.

1. I never sayed its dying, that were your words. 2. It didnt settle anywhere, read the graphics again. Its been in a decline till the introduction of alphas, which caused it to spike before starting to decline again. Looking at the current trend it is likely that even the record numbers wont go over 30k next year 3. I quit the game about a year ago.

Hyprviper flairbaiting B0T, are we relevant again?
---
ah, insulting a non-native speaker's english, i see we have reached the high point of any quality debate. well played, you have totally invalidated my actual points by pointing out a grammatical error!
---
still quite amazed at how strong your feelings about RFF are.
---
"EVE is a sandbox for us all." Exactly, which means I can come and knock over your sandcastle if I want to. I can't wait for the ocean of highsec tears. You guys cry over ganked retrievers. Imagine the salt that's coming.
---
Troll tanking a battleship for some friends to blow up before I quit.
---
great now I have ear cancer
---
You mean edited screen shots? Lol
---
I forgive you.
---
This will be good for the market
---
It is normal for players to complain when their play style is challenged by the Devs.
---
The Mittani has communicated that his preferred play style is Empire building and PVP wars in SOV Bul. It seems clear that with the addition of the new NPC behavior that the Devs are going after the Empire building play style and curtailing in the process PVP wars at least in SOV Nul. Seems perfectly normal to complain since the actions of the Devs can't be changed in-game.
---
Good habit: staying off r/eve
---
not a single ship being shot in the entire video, fascinating.
---
imagine actually shooting something that isn't a structure right lmao
---
Any player will still kill you first. THEN explain what you did wrong and help your poor nooby butt out.
---
You’re still dead tho. 😂
---
witty.
---
I love highsec tears more than anything
---
Totally agree, having a large contingent of inexperienced players flying ships past their level makes for good kills for the experienced player.   It is not like you are removing skill entirely - skill books would still need to be purchased and a limit to accessible ships via Omega clones would still be in effect - could even have penalties for alpha accounts (similar to current skill cap).
---
I'm trying to be objective here, but I could have sworn I saw that there was A LOT less ratting when goons were deployed up north. Now obviously with most goons leaving, it meant that less people stayed behind to krab, but the reality is, Goons DID stop ratting as much and were hindered in isk making because you were losing shit left and right. Didn't you lot lose a titan as well? It's quite obvious that the lack of umbrella made it so that there was less ratting.
---
Are you complaining about another person complaining? 
---
You have no real reason to complain.
---
Nope. Not seen anyone in Horde crying
---
What a freaking megalomaniac. He thinks he runs EVE and he doesn't even play anymore. It's sad that so many people are willing to follow him. He's the Trump of EVE.
---
idk what's worse, cringey tryhard reddit goons or idiots on reddit who unironically think AIs creating busy work for people is good game design
