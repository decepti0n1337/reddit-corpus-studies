On your second point, if players are collecting the isk, that will stop the attempted block to the already oversized "isk faucet." Too much isk coming in, not enough going out. What do you think about that?
---
---
---
&gt;Wait! So I will use an altcorp to destroy my own citadel, sending my stuff to asset safety system, under the effect of my own deployed mobile structure, so that I can pay 15% asset safety tax to my altcorp, when I retrieve my own items from the asset safety system? You don't realize how dumb you sound, just to stretch your points due to hatefulness, do you?
---

---
This is what I mean by "you lack foresight". People already asset safety massive sums of reprocessed ores or mass builds, this would allow them to loophole around the tax aspect which was the ONLY negative thing impeding this transactions. The thing you claim "I sound so dumb about" is literally already something in practice. Relocate entire arsenals of capitals from foward-deployed azbels to station @ no cost except cheap fit structure in system, yeah - sounds dumb alright.
---
&gt;Like the narrative change from "nobody likes Olmeca" to "he will just get himself banned".
---
I never said that, I still don't think people like you. You getting yourself banned is probably a high probability as well, but not what I meant. I just think your ideas are going to get shot down and dismembered like I just did that asset tax evasion proposal you just whiffed on.
---
&gt;Lol it must be even more saddening to realize he endorses me then.
---
Until he realizes it hurts his chances and fully embraces the level of idiocy within your suggestions.
---
Thats not hate speech. Careful what you call hate speech nowadays. It carries heavy connotations.
---
If you want to lament over sov that was actually awesome, research Interstellar Starbase Syndicate.

Oh i see it now, should probably talk more directly about low sec status systems and higher sec status systems rather than say 'they.'

---
So you're saying the ore anom changes didn't go far enough, and something like what /u/olmeca_gold is proposing might actually tip the scales?
---
neat.
---
If you need more, go find Lugia, and ask for some of “the good stuff”.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
You have my vote. Your EVE is the EVE I want to see.
---
Lol I wish! If I hit those numbers I would have quit my job and just made video game guides for the last 4 years. 
---
I'd say more than 97 percent of people downloaded it for free, and not everyone who paid took the full price. Overall it definitely helped cover stuff like site hosting and Adobe Creative Suite licensing which is expensive for a solo video editor!
---
But here is the difference changes like this make more thingassessable  to more players without infringing on anyone there is no reason not to welcome something that would be good emergent gameplay
---
Only thing that would have made that better would have been the freighter dropping an mtu and taking all that salvage then gtfoing
---
A follow up to this question, what do you think about changing the ECM bonus of the widow? Also, for WH blopsing how do you feel the current WH mass limitation would work? Do you think allowing them to use a module to shrink their mass to fit more through? Also how do you feel the DPS output should be reworked or should it?
---
I'm in a wormhole pvp corp and I have 2 subs going on. Since I have 6 character boxes, I was wondering what alts I could get. Preferably ones that have a short 30 or 60 day train, so that I don't have to spend too much $ or Isk on training queues. 
---
So far I've got:
---
First sub
---
1. Main
---
2. Scanner alt(could train something else on top)
---
3.?
---
Second sub
---
1. Secondary DPS/Sabre/Logi
---
2. Hauler alt
---
Since can only have 2 games open at once, the other alts should preferably be alts that are fairly independent, or that I would use with 1 other account. Only other alts I could think of are other scanners, which I guess are always useful to have.
---
Send  me what you have and I will double it.
---
Nothing? I wouldn't call those two Athanors we took the shields from "nothing", sir! Now you've gone and messed up.
---
Sounds like a bad corp.
---
They didn't, really. I ran myself out. They didn't help but it was time for a change.
---
As a new player I don't know that there is a way to fix it, but it sure is frustrating.  I'm in a one of the giant newbie friendly corps and even there all of the doctrines are 3-6mo out just to fit them let alone use them effectively.  The low SP doctrines aren't actually used.  I've already seen the main doctrines being used shift 3x in two months with all new support skills required.  I'm very concerned that by the time I train into the current doctrines it'll switch up again and I'll need to train a whole new set of support skills to effectively use them.
---
In the meantime it's really frustrating to see no progression.  Basically it's set up so you fly T1 Frigs and then eventually step suddenly into T2 or T3 cruisers/destroyers/etc.  You basically never touch the the ships in between.  Someone the other night remarked that it was frustrating they got told to fly a T1 EWAR while the FC begged for more logi, but the FC only would take Basilisk's and the person was only skilled for T1 cruiser Logi (Osprey).  
---
I get that there are good reasons for consistency, but with the end result being months and months of flying T1 frigs because the T1 everything else is ignored it's very frustrating and leaves some big gaps that feel like little or no progression.   And that's in a well organized group that makes room for newbies.  I imagine it's much worse in less newbie friendly corps.
---
Huffing wh gas is decent profit and with reasonably low skills you can run sites with others
---
I'm pretty sure people are manning all this dying spacejunk. #RESIST
---
Does it connect to Stain?
---
Well, the goons are nicer than test. 
---
They all start screaming in local for me whenever someone mines the wrong rock and is pretending to be AFK.
---
It wouldn't be "good emergent gameplay", though. It would adversely affect the spawns of higher-level anomalies and would actively make nullsec more casual, which is the opposite of what it needs. Not to mention, again, it is an unnecessary change since day-one pilots have no problem living out in nullsec as-is.
---
It's a waste of time and resources that is likely going to break something in decade-old code if implemented, it's completely unnecessary because (again) new pilots have ample content in null as-is, and literally the only reason why you want it is because you are butthurt over making bad choices in skills.
---
Fly dragons?
---
question: do you think the iki is killable by anything other than itself in abyssal pvp?
---
The proposed changes only tip would be in the favor of the larger groups he is trying to combat. By all means go ahead make those changes and in a year when goons are even farther ahead still controlling whatever we want and still leading the MER numbers what will the whining be about then? We got exactly what we thought we wanted and it hurt us more than goons?
---
That's nice.
---
&gt; It could potentially happen.
---
It has happened many times, and will happen again.  Eve often mirrors real life in that regard.
---
Got a link to the SF SOTA?
---
&gt;They care about the stories of EVE
---
Right, but this is, in a way, fundamentally the problem with EVE. People like *reading* about it, but the day to day gameplay is often not enough to draw people in. The whole cross server interaction thing *was* cool, and *was* hyped significantly in the gaming and social media, because it sounds absolutely fantastic, on paper. Without strong gameplay, however, it's all for naught. 
---
&gt;Game play looked okay but unfortunately it's "just an FPS on top of a ship." But if CCP said "Hey we have this shooter and whenever you win a match some EVE nerd loses an expensive capital ship" it would get a lot more attention.
---
Right, but I suspect that's why CCP keeps dancing around this particular issue. If Eve was younger, and pre capital ships, I could buy this sort of gameplay, because capitals would be rare and extremely valuable to whichever alliance had them, but these days they're pretty commonplace. Making sure to have a bunch of side-game FPS players in case your cap got boarded and you needed to defend it would make sense, but these days I doubt it would be valuable enough to defend, and the resulting gameplay would probably involve just stripping all the valuable out of an infected cap prior to its destruction. Or even doing so and blowing it up yourself to spite the FPS players.
---
I'm not opposed to games being connected/intertwined with the EVE servers, but I don't think they can expand outside their very, very niche population without games with good gameplay, even at the expense of complete integration with EVE.
---
to be fair that just gives his review more credibility

How would you do this? I would say you cant just increase the sell price of blue loot because that just pumps more flat isk into the economy, but J space farmers are heavily heavily outnumbered by bots on null so it'd be a drop in the bucket.

Minmatar is centered around being a chad. Caldari is centered around being a virgin. By mixing the two you create a quantum destabilization in the permaflux layering. You'll interfere with the chadiosis acceleration which will deteriorate the counterbalance of virgin-encabulation.

They could add a new region for the new faction, bordering Black Rise, Molden Heath and Stain!

Indeed. Show up at the armor timer and I will definitely reconsider my previous ranking of "nothing".

You are on to something here. I can smell it!

You’re in luck. Eve is built around the social aspect of corporations, alliances and coalitions. Take a look at the in-game corp recruitment tab and find somewhere who you think might fit in. I’d suggest anywhere but hisec.

To be fair HK never underestimated nullblobs. It was all the C4 retardos that sperged out about a WH CFC coming together and whatnot.

Hostile towards NRDS not NPSI.

Sure, I support your rights to say whatever. That's great. The game should be total freedom to do whatever. Just don't change the total freedom aspect.

Projectile/missile split, skanked out rusty Caldari looking hulls, slow but agile, ecm + painter boners, some sort of AB bonus (no MWD), armor resists? No drones but buff accordingly? Hrm.

Hk didn't underestimate null. We always knew null would be what evicted rage, not another wh corp

More scanners, maybe a jita alt? 2 rattlesnake pilots can make you enough isk to fund a 3rd account :)

By optimizing your sub-financial equity, you can definitely expect a return on investment which propagates capital influx.

Not sure, I'm only 4th best.

There have already effectively been battles that are all of eve on one side or the other.  a good number of forces dont fully commit because the server cant handle it.
---
Last summer, when Pandemic Legion joined Holy Drone Empire, Winter Coalition, and Triumverate to attack Legacy - we saw effectively a world war when Imperium then opened up a northern front, dragging GOTG and the rest of Panfam into the war.  We saw something like 100 titans die in a month span.

I think you may be missing a few key facts about structure timers there, my friend. There's no point in us showing up if you don't; we win by default. You have to show up, or you lose.

"Here's my idea for PVP welfare"

Sounds solid. Whats the next step after that? Is there even an 'end-all-be-all' money maker? I feel like most WH-ers with their fancy T3C doctrines dont all rely on huffing for isk.

Honestly in my experience most live the "I'd rather pay for fun than pay to farm" but last I lived there anyway c4/5/6 sites made amazing isk/hour.
---
Then just buy them separately.
---
The 'best' wh pve is running c6 sites in dreads, but you can only run as many sites as you get, which is somewhere between 10 and 20 a week. 8b/hour tops 
---
Below that is dreads in c5 space - probably looking at 2-3b/hour
---
Below that is running sites with tinker rattles/nestors and killing drifters with astras - 1b/hour maybe 
---
Below that is running c5's in tinkers/nestors and not killing the drifter because static sites suck - 500m maybe idk kinda sucks
---
There's also niche shit like sb nestors like dura lex (and feeding billions trying), rorq logi/cruise rattles, rr leshaks, etc.
---
Have you tried defending it while its unanchoring?

The game will start dying pretty fast if pvp doesnt pick up. Groups keep disappearing and new ones aren't popping up. SC just closed its doors today.

This is true, except the raptor, it has an optimal bonus. As a minor clarification, tackle can also include scramming, doesn't just have to be long points. But i understand that is mostly suicidal for a \~5k EHP (at best) inty, unless you go full tank raptor (which is about 11k EHP). Though even things like the crusader in its current layout is pretty potent at catching squishy kiters like garmurs and does solid dps (200-250).
---
An interesting option could be a role bonus of 25% (maybe 50%, but i think that would be too much). I say 25% just so they aren't encroaching too much on assault frigate territory. Also, it limits the possibility of arty claws making a comeback but still be semi effective in a combat role, and also prevent rail raptors slotting in with rail harpy fleets.
---
this was an excellent read. and i agree with you. passive income generators that would benefit small pvp groups would be a net positive for content in the game.
---
formatting is kinda meh but still well written.
---
forcing pvp focused players to do pve doesnt lead to more pvp, it leads to less...

so please CCP, we had this for way to long now.. can we go back? THANKS

i did this for a while with VNIs. im sure someone complained about botters somewhere referring to me because for about 3 days i basically just logged in and would watch netflix while updating 3 market orders for hours straight. the number of competing orders that updated often went from 6-7 initially to 3 on day 2. by day 3 there was one guy who updated occasionally. after that i just flipped VNIs in jita without much contest other than people in the opposite TZ as me.

Was a pleasure to fly with you, albeit in my time in WiNGSPAN you were in comms only once. I became burned out soon after joining as I was chasing money and not content.

"SBSQ and RR are renters" that's an interesting narrative you've made up there.

---
Thanks again for putting this together.  There is so much fragmented info on this complex game that it was overwhelming when I was starting out.  
---
Your videos got me to start playing this silly game (only every played SIM racing games before this).  Your guide was my bible when I left Signal Cartel and started hunting.  Joined WiNGSPAN and got to have lunch with you which was awesome.  You were the first person I ever considered a 'video game celebrity', and it was refreshing to learn that you are the same kind and goofy person irl. I have so many space friends in corp because of what you started.  You have impacted so many people positively and what you have started continues to connect lonely capsuleers from all over the world.

I killed most of his drones and couldn't break his tank. We both died to timer. Looked like a recharge fit but normally I can break those so it must have been pretty good.

Im sure there is something wrong with me, but what you did sounds perfectly reasonable.

Might be a stretch, but does that pattern fit astometricly? A different question, has anyone been in a Sancha shattered recently?

You seriously don't know the extent players go to to get an advantage? Auto aim bots. Rapid fire tech. Some even create lag. Many players in all games do this. Sad you are too naive to notice.
---
As a new player, I find the UI to be very clunky, and it's quite offputting.

Unfair pvp will always be disgusting. Cheaters will always be the scum of any gaming community. It's astounding to me that you don't know this.

The highest average player count over a year was 2013 with 45k. Peak is quite irrelevant, especially if it happens during AT.

"Truly new players" are joining Eve all the time, ask any new player corp/alliance, or make a Horde alt and see for yourself.

You won't fight even numbers lol.
---
I've always hoped that those jove space systems would be like that when/if they would get released to the playerbase.
---
Seems to me that they've stopped the bleeding. Average player count has been steady since 2015. Don't get me wrong, I think most of the changes listed in the post would be good for the game, but pretending that they would increase the player count is a joke.
---
On new players injecting, I think the evidence is simply against you. Horde has built a capital/supercapital force off the back of new players being very willing to inject to participate in that kind of gameplay. This idea that we could just tell new people "oh yeah you won't get to play with the big toys for about a year, but don't worry, it makes the game much healthier for you!" is farcical, especially in the current capital-heavy meta.
---
I love watching people who have no idea what they're taking about discuss this,  the truth of the matter if you made ridiculous changes like this then you will literally destroy the economy as traders will hike prices up to compensate for lost margins, also this idea got down voted to hell in the other thread what made you think it needs a topic of its own

Kinda takes away part of what makes Wormholes so unique. They're each a single Null sec system. You can do anything and everything in that system, but you have (hardly) none of the outside resources. You can't cyno in support from afar. All you've got is what's in there with you, or what you can bring in.
---
That said, I could see argument for allowing the new Citadel gates, assuming you can figure out which systems are geographically close enough to reach each other.
---
No, it isn't.
---
I agree a lot of the problem is the players. That's one of the many reasons I left null to go to wormholes, but when you want null to be a source of content and botting is so fucking prevalent, it becomes a huge issue.
---
Are you aware that zkill does NOT show content of double wraps?  
---
  
---
The loot was good :)
---
An inspiring story
---
Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We need dark in order to show light. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
---
You can't have them both active at the same time.
---
But the MWD is great for chasing someone down and getting into combat range. But once you're in range, Warp Scram will prevent you from activating the MWD at all.
---
At which point, you turn on the AB instead. That way you still have some extra velocity above what the naked ship would have otherwise. Even if they Web you, you'll still be going faster than if you were naked and Webbed.
---
Ive heard of people doing it with Abaddons in wormholes tol. Beam lasers that can hit out to like, 250km. The Fortizar cant scram out that far. They just jump around.
---
Yeah not much has changed other than a few new mods.

This, perfectly, explains: https://i.redd.it/boh5fixum5m01.jpg

Add me to contacts in game Yula Rissanen might be able to help ya out
---
Then don't vote for him dude. We've had goons on the cam forever and as their power has increased and the role of bears I'm the game has become more solidified, the game itself has become more calcified and boring. So why the fuck would I care what you think about the ideas of a CSM candidate you will never vote for?
---
So if you want to be a kiter you need dual prop?
---
And that's a good thing.
---
You don't "need" to dual prop, but it can be helpful. If you're trying to MWD Kite and someone gets close enough to land a Scram, you're boned. If you're trying to AB Kite, you will have a much harder time outrunning anything.
---
Or if you are trying to sig tank after tackling someone.
---
If goonswarm kills provi, wouldnt their content be gone, and they would need high sec for it? Seems like a double edge sword.
---
New emergent gameplay? 🤔
---
Based and Eve pilled.
---
Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Just a little indication.
---
I don't really agree with the passive moon mining of any kind for a simple reason. What would stop huge coalitions then from getting those "unwanted" moons for themselves instead, since they can just deploy and defend the structures that will passively farm those moons. CCP needs to rework the lowsec and FW especially in order to keep solo/small gang pvp alive. Few days ago i was roaming for couple of hours through lowsec and some FW system in a Sunesis, for those 3-4 hours that ive spent trying to find a decent pvp i realized that lowsec is dead in USTZ and the only thing you can find to fight is some small cruiser+ gate camps. I was also watching stream of Jebi Vjetar today roaming through FW trying to do some PVP and the only pvp he had was against one of the viewers who got bored and decided to provide some content at least. I am pretty sure if i start roaming through Greater Wildlands i will find more content than in majority of lowsec areas.
---
I have a gnosis, i can put a 50mn microwarp drive that gives me 1047m/s or a 100mn compact afterburner that gives me 713m/s, i can also put both. but you think i should just do the afterburner?

Just saw this, 47 LARGE SKILL INJECTORS IN .6 JESUS CHRIST
---
That is a pretty common tactic... to put an oversized AB on instead. Then you get near MWD speed, w/o the worry of a Scram shutting you down.
---
hahah yeah okay. make sure to get your prescriptions renewed
---
[deleted]
---
that would only work with one gate per system though
---
You have my vote, lol
---
I'd say something about whale hunting but Olmeca has copyrighted the expression.
---
Yeah, the chipspam. First time the clan was on the map we faced that from the South Americans we were up against. Treated the whole thing as a learning experience (we started knowing squat about map mechanics) and from then on we knew how to either avoid it or deal with it.
---
It's possible that you do remember me as I played WoT under this name. Solid green on the fringes of being blue before I burned out on the game. The two months I paid for premium time since kinda took the edge off my stats because the rust had taken hold. My main claim to fame in the game, tho, is probably being the clan boss who deep-dicked BAKED on the tier 6 map after their chief diplo, a Kiwi named Hans if memory serves, acted like an utter twat. He wanted us to give up well-earned gains on the basis of BAKED's prior ownership, was far from nice in asking, and landed his clan in a monthlong fight that resembled Verdun in terms of nightly intensity and overall movement of the front. My boys loved it.
---
Gosh. Like I'm going to believe you and your troll rant over what I actually witnessed. Yeah. Sure buddy. Keep dreaming.
---
I'm not that old yet. But seems like you're familiar with that kind of stuff. I won't judge you though. Cheers.
---
True, but it would be one more than the zero you have now =)
---
And you can realign the Jump Gates... it just takes a while.
---
AND lowsec?!
---
but it legit kills my cap, idk i have to test it out if i can fight with AB on + spamming cap booster + shooting
---
You have my vote.
---
&gt; People already asset safety massive sums of reprocessed ores or mass builds, this would allow them to loophole around the tax aspect which was the ONLY negative thing impeding this transactions.
---
It would only work if you destroy your citadel. So for 600m fee and with 20 days delay, you carried your stuff to nearest lowsec. I don't not a big deal at all compared to the positives of the proposal. If it was such a big deal, then being able to do it for 15% tax would already have been so bad. 
---
Besides, you already switched from "it's impossible to code". I see no reason at all to keep responding to you, as whatever issue with the proposal I respond, you'll throw smaller more irrelevant stuff. All due to hate.
---
&gt; I never said that, I still don't think people like you

---
&gt; I just think your ideas are going to get shot down 
---
This is entirely possible due to the empire builder nature of the CSM. I'm not overly optimistic about my ideas going into the game. But that's true for all CSM. I'm pretty sure they are solid ideas. People's reception of them also solidifies that point. And I already got devs to consult my expertise on issues. So the platform is already effective, even if I don't get elected. CCP isn't unaware of the complete 1-sidedness of the feedback they are receiving. So you keep hating on mate.
---
So that's why I don't see your fleets up anymore.... I had wondered why I never saw you online for the past while
---
Hah, exactly like me. Took a few years break, thinking what to do, never liked PvP. 
---
I keep wondering what are the odds a solo player can do non-high sec content, like low-sec missions or such? Are they worth it or is it just asking to get podded?
---
Welcome back to your people, you crazy bastard. Welcome home.

there's like 5 corps that could actually deal with that. the size of WH corps is much much smaller than you seem to think

If you take a loot at any [MER](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/5aL5TTP2JuB4S2e7SMQH3c/038f8c7b5a4cb335047a1c5ad4665c2a/9a_sinksfaucets.png), you'll notice Asset Safety is not one of the important ISK sinks. Besides, most of that sink is coming from people asset safety'ing on citadels which aren't under a threat. E.g. you loot something in nullsec, you store in citadel, you asset safety it. Or you buy 100 dreads from 1dq with a spy, and safety it to get out (I actually did this). So it's questionable how much of this sink actually comes from destroyed citadels. Most of this ISK sink will keep happening under my system as well.
---
Meanwhile, players collecting the tax from the citadels they destroy will actually bring its own tax. Players kill the citadel for the very purpose, things go into safety precisely because of the change, and players take the tax which they themselves have caused.

I am pretty sure we had billboards back in mid-2000s when I started playing...

Wtf are you on about? The new agency thing is actually completely useless for exploration. It’s not accurate, for starters, and secondly it doesn’t tell you the identity of a sig, just the number of sigs. So you can’t say whether nothing changed or one sig spawned while another despawned, you still have to double check every system. And again, it’s not accurate enough for that to work anyway. 
---
The optimal strategy is, and has always been, to set up a big loop based on dotlan telling you which systems are active, and loop it over and over so that you don’t have to waste time scanning down sigs.
---
Current wh limitations will alllow 2-3 blopses to go into null together with a big fleet. I'm fine with that if you want to disable more capitals from cynoing up, you should have more regional blopses staged. It's doable.
---
I'd propose making Widow a heavy dps platform with painting bonus (pasting another answer): 
---
Give it a target painting bonus, make it a heavy DPS platform. Panthers are agile/kitey. Sin has neuts vs active tanked whales. Deemer has tank in those rare large fleet drops. Widow can be the one with top notch DPS, best active tank, and the ability to paint/apply to small stuff.
---
Olmeca I wanted to mention that you've come a long way since you initially hit the spotlight, especially in regards having to deal with the haters. Your experience shows that you have figured out how to compartmentalize the filth, the toxic shit people say to you (for whatever their reasons). It used to affect you, in my opinion, but now it doesn't, at least not as much. This is a big kudos from me, and I want to mention that at least one of us who does not yell the loudest on the forums is listening and respecting you far more than the idiots who drool about how cool they are by demeaning others. You have my vote by proving you're a reasonable person in the sea of entitled shrieking.
---
The gate network there has been destroyed according to lore.
---
Well I completely agree with you and that's why I say shit happens.
---
For me the actual problem is the abyss pvp itself.
---
This "feature" should not be there in the first place
---
&gt; Does it not already? Anyone serious with krabing in j space uses 2 or 3 dreads.
---
&gt; Not sure. Last time I checked everyone was complaining about how everyone was using MJD battleships and how it was killing content.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; How would you do this? I would say you cant just increase the sell price of blue loot because that just pumps more flat isk into the economy, but J space farmers are heavily heavily outnumbered by bots on null so it'd be a drop in the bucket.
---
I mean, if there is huge inflation in the economy due to nullsec, I wouldn't say making the drifter drop more blue loot would be unfair. Why should wormholers have their relative income impaired just because nullsec is overfarming?
---
&gt; but wormholes also have much better ref mechanics, with less tz tank
---
This may be true, but can still set TZ and day for final ref, which makes evictions cancerous to prosecute and turns them into blobfests where both sides have to call in reinforcements in order to have enough TZ coverage over a week.
---
There will never be a non-blob eviction of a slightly relevant corp at this point, because you can't use any offensive caps on a fort grid, and you have to hold hole control for an entire week while all of WH space rolls tries to get in one or the other side.
---
You would be amazed at how easy it would be if CCP allowed name changes.
---
You and people like you is the reason CCP has such a hard time getting more subscribers.  *Hi Five*
---
Do you want to penalize organizations that got to a point where they can dump on anyone?
---
No implants on his clones in case he gets podded I presume?
---
Butt stuff
---
Sounds solid when you say it like that.
---
I played a game called war and order and this crap happened all the time. So many rogues with OP's skill and so many P2Wers who were way too gullible.
---
It might be easier to get away with betrayal but it would still be hard to implement it in the first place
---
Fit projectiles or missiles instead. Those don't use Cap to fire. Then you can save it for the Prop and the Tank.
---
That said, Neuts are very common. So you might want to consider having a Cap Booster anyway.
---
I think that might actually be illegal in China.
---
God I miss Eve so much. Kudos, friend.

Even if it did work it would promote more glassing campaigns which would force people more into hyper coalitions.

---
How can I updoot more than once???

Loved it!
---
I'm going to guess the initial person no, but whoever fixed it yes.
---
Suppose entire nullsec is 250k characters (in truth it's also near that number).
---
There are 40ish null regions. Suppose there are also 40 umbrellas (in truth it's a little bit less).
---
Currently you can fit 80k characters under the same umbrella. Goons fit 40kish under the same umbrella. Under my system, you'd be able to fit about 9.3k under the same umbrella. Goons would need about 4-5 umbrellas. Legacy would need about 2-3. 
---
Meanwhile, you could fit all people of nullsec to 26 umbrellas. That leaves 14 regions free. Some of those will be taken for more farm. But quite a few of those will be unattended, and smalltime alliances can carve their sov in them. If small alliances carve their space in those, there will be even more anoms spawning in their space. So large alliances are mechanically motivated to leave them be

What percentage of your rolls find MJD BS, and what percentage find caps in site? I can tell you from the last two years of rolling 5's that I've seen about 15-20 BS for every cap in site that I've found
---
Thanks! I really appreciate this response. I do feel like I've come a long way in that regard too. And still have distances to go.
---
I actually had a part in my video talking about this a little. How this is the part of some mega alliances' metagame and how we whalers at times need to deal with it. I decided to drop it. In hindsight it was a good decision. I learned that I can't engage with a direct shitslinging competetion with those who aren't open to my points. There are hundreds of them and just one me. The more I do that, the more I myself come off as the toxic center of all the shit. And those who are open to my points aren't interested in that shitshow to begin with. So I decided to prioritize talking about what I do best. Playing the game. Showcasing my gaming. Talking balance. Eventually I managed to repair my reputation a bit. It's still a work in progress.

Wow, there are quite a few posts here from people like who stopped playing for ages (I stopped in early 2010s...). Anyway, here are my questions:
---
1) I used to fly Sleipnir for PvE (missions lv 4-5). Was it nerfed? It seems to have went from 8 high slots to 5, and drone bay is now 25, was 40... 
---
2) why Storyline and Expeditions/Escalation stuff are marked in Agency as not available? Are they retired, or simply they don't show until triggered?
---
3) In all honesty, I never tried anything outside missions, much (I was a part of null sec for few months, so I am not a total n00b, but it was looong ago and I forgot most PvP skills :D). And I am now scared of non-high sec, since I like to us high-end equipment on my ship. So, first, how suicidal is it these days to do missions in low-sec? And I am trying to figure out explorations, but how to know which ones can take me into PvP areas? It seems some of them can very challenging, and I am not sure how to square the need for top-tier equipment with the risk of getting killed by a PvP pirate. I don't want to loose good fits to sudden PvP, but doing the same mission stuff over and over again is what eventually got boring enough I left the game... I finished the first 'epic mission' that I started ages ago, I see there are now more than one available, but at least the one I finished was like level 1 difficulty, hardly challenging enough to make me pay much attention to the game...
---
4) from the Agency, the Sansha Incursions, Abysal Deadspace, and the new Trig... Invasion sound fun, but can they be soloed, or do you need to join some group? And how safe are they from PvE?
---
5) Is there any point in bothering with "Pirate Strongholds"? Back when I was playing, those things were emptied minutes after game restart by local corps, etc.
---
6) I've noticed some 'Autothysian Lancers' outside a high-sec station, read up on them and got scared, particularly on the note that they call some OP battleship with doomsday-like weapons for help AND they pod you... what's the reasonable setup for taking them on? Can they be cleared solo?
---
7) Based on war/employment history all of my buddies from ~10 years ago seem to be inactive now, sigh. I thought about *maybe* joining some small friendly corp that likes to do PvE but... how to find one? Lol. I tried clicking on various player characters and structures and most lead to corps that have no description, or no recruitment info.
---
I dont see any death threats lmfao
---
Check my edit
---
The issue now though is that the game has evolved even further since the removal of passive moon goo. Now we are back to relatively fast travel across the game. So projection onto a place like Syndicate is possible again. Unless I'm mistaken, fatigue arrived before the moon mining change. So you'd have to do more than change citadels to return to that golden time of warfare.
---
&gt;Anyone serious with krabing
---
&gt;what percentage find caps in site
---
Your question was answered by my statement. You crit your holes and keep eyes up. You're shouldn't find caps ratting in J space unless you roll straight into their hole. 
---
On the other hand, you constantly run across dudes in battleships because they're cheap and take substantially less skill points to run. Finding more of a ship /= that ship or playstyle is better.
---
You're such a crybaby lmfao dude literally no one cares or watches eve videos so your channel isnt being "Sabotaged" and hint hint its called trolling, one of the art forms this game has seemed to lose over the carebear-ification of it over the past few years.
---
Grow a pair and htfu.
---
The way I see it there are two kinds of groupings in Eve. One is around daily safety (safety of Rorquals, supers, PvE ships, and so on). The other is around timer-based safety (safety of citadels and sov infrastructure). Due to the nature of batphones, timer-based coalitions are already hyper. Defenses and offenses are being made by almost half of the game either side. What actually matters is whether these hyper coalitions exist for daily PvP. And they do, when you cram 45k people in a single region. 
---
My anom rework proposal is about breaking those hyper coalitions based on daily safety.
---
The asset safety rework wouldn't change much, as people already form huge teams to defend their keepstars, or to attack others' keepstars. My proposal could go both ways. It could cause mega empires to glass entire regions chasing ISK. Or it could cause entire of Eve uniting against the biggest coalitions due to how lucrative it would be to kill their citadels with so much wealth amassed. Either way could create more fights and explosions. As far as I am concerned, the target would be achieved.
---
EVE: where being an asshole is not just acceptable, but applauded!
---
I have been a recutiter in multiple corp for the last damn 10 years. recruiting four or five people in only a couple hours is actually very very successful. recruiting is very different then it was a few years ago. Lack of new players, LOTS of options of different cops to join. (Karma fleet, horde, brave etc) means truly finding new people can be a challenge. 
---
the best tips I can give you are. 
---
Be honest about your corp. nothing is worse then joining a corp and being lied to. When I was recruiting for Phantom squad I was always honest about our positives as well as our negatives. People want to know what they're signing up for. Last thing you want is people to join then leave after a week.
---
Have goals, we want to do A, B, C, D. Goals can be simple as a mining op for pvp ships to go roam together.
---
instead of isk give your corp mates pvp ships and go on roams. even if you die in a blaze of glory. If you get laughs you win. 
---
Make an eve fourms post. the most successful time I had recruiting was when I would spam my very very well written eve o post. even if it was to shoot the shit with people that found it funny. 
---
Never be afraid of rejection. Reject people who you feel wont be a good fit. Be honest and tell them hey sorry mate I dont think were what you're looking for.
---
Building Bonds: as soon as new plays join build bonds roams, missions, content. teach them so they can keep the content going when you're not around.
---
I'll add more once I get home from gym
---
Post on Evejobs and forums

Mass mailing is good if you're setting up a bad hisec corp and need as many bodies as possible for tax

He is ragerolling wormholes to find targets. Doesn't matter if you crit your own holes, he can still roll into you. Meanwhile, battleship farmers roll their holes as well. So the selection is random, and if you find more BS farming in C5s rather than capitals, it means people do more BS farmign than capital farming.
---
Will you?
---
Anytime I can. I'm used to worse odds.
---
Done and did.
---
Are you me?
---
If you wanna mess about in a dual prop ship that you’ll have loads of fun in, I would suggest the cynabal.. I have one with 20 kill marks on it and I’ve lost only 1 of them in total and that was because I went afk on gate lol.
---
If you play right, you can get out of a load of sticky situation, tackle can’t get near me as they get shredded and I can still pop them in point range unless they warp, that thing is hella fast and does some pretty damn good dps...
---
Jf pilot is to lazy or retarded to avoid getting ganked in highsec, so instead he invested in expensive shit to survive a medium size gank fleet instead of being intelligent and never getting caught.
---
Idk mate. Sometimes I just feel like there aren't enough players to fill all spaces in Eve. There are equally vast empty spaces in null and wormholes.
---
I get salty too, because I do a lot of solo stuff, but at the same time, it's content for everyone and remembering that, it's not too bad afterwards. It all goes into the pile of experience.
---
Roadmaps are available as a loot box item for the low low price of 500 isk. If your loot box doesn’t contain the roadmap, please keep trying.
---
&gt; Your question was answered by my statement. You crit your holes and keep eyes up. You're shouldn't find caps ratting in J space unless you roll straight into their hole. 
---
I'm talking about ragerolling though, not scanning chains. A C5 nag is only a little more expensive than a pair of tinker snakes for something like 5 times the effectiveness, but MJD BS are way too safe for the risk averse to want to use something else. 
---
Also, having most of the isk in the site in the Drifters instead of the Avengers greatly reduces incentives to use caps, which means fewer of them get tackled and no real escalations can happen.
---
So if there is 100 billion worth of assets in an astrahus and you successfully deploy this module on it does that then "tag" the astrahus so that all assets that eventually go into asset safety will have the "tax" get paid to the deployable owner's Corp instead of as an isk sink?
---
How long does the tag last? What if we abused this and dropped them on every small corp and alliance we could find? Even if there was an expiration this seems like incentivizes large groups to be bigger bullies. That seems counter to your usual position.
---
This comes off as you trying to motivate assaults on strongholds but it doesn't seem fully thought out with respect to overall impact.
---
Adapt or die?
---
A lot of excuses being made by a lot of old guard that just grew older and had less time to fulfill the needs of content creation in the 2nd decade.
---
&gt; Is nullsec not already abundantly wealthy in respect to farm able anoms, faction spawns, and more valuable mining assets?
---
I can understand this sentiment and where it's coming from.
---
Nullsec is actually not that rewarding. You can take a Gila to Abyss or C3s and get way more compared to null anoms. A 7b investment Rorqual makes you 130m/hr. A 20b investment super makes you 400m/hr. Comparatively, if you do C5 sites in 2 Rattles (5b investment), you get 500m/hr.
---
The lucrativeness of nullsec comes from its being overly accessible (you can join any alliance today), its being low effort (log in, and start ratting), and its being extremely riskless (get tackled, and we'll save you). Most of my proposals are about fixing all these issues. If we do, however, manage to fix them, we'd have to increase the ISK/hr in null so that people actually remain in there, and that it's still a viable option.
---
I only knew CCP removed structure skins from their roadmap =(
---
&gt; So if there is 100 billion worth of assets in an astrahus and you successfully deploy this module on it does that then "tag" the astrahus so that all assets that eventually go into asset safety will have the "tax" get paid to the deployable owner's Corp instead of as an isk sink?
---
Only if the citadel dies under the tag. Else you can safety it with paying NPCs.
---
&gt; How long does the tag last?
---
Until the citadel dies or until you remove the structure. Else it would have no effect.
---
2. Who do you think will bother with that?
---
It’s flair bait 😉
---
Yes there is did you actually read my original comment? GMs will ban people who would do it regularity in starter systems
---
Nice, just got my copy last week!
---
I was sad to see your killboard hasn't had any new kills since February nor new videos. Hope you get back to it soon!
---
This sounds like something we could abuse very easily, I'm down.
---
I agree in general, but the thing I'd worry about is that we'd still have citadels instead of POS, which lack all of those nice things you listed that made them reasonable to fight over. I'd worry that due to citadels being cancer to attack you might actually end up *introducing* those far-flung moon empires even if they didn't originally exist.
---
There isn't a public roadmap... not for lack of trying to get one...
---
Thank you for the knowledge! I have learned some new things and I’m interested to hear what else you have to say.
---
People can counter it by having good discipline. At the end of the day you only get afk people's asset tax
---
An untanked raven with decent skills can trivially hit to 300k with navy or 260-270 with fury. Good skills, 300 with fury easily.
---
Absolutely amazing! Makes me want to try something like this
---
Do you mean the primary intent of this is to get people to bash unused/abandoned structures?
---
&gt;A C5 nag is only a little more expensive
---
&gt;5 times the effectiveness
---
So lets just say battleships are about the same price and 1/5 the effectiveness. Shouldnt they be a hell of a lot safer than a dread?
---
If they're that much better and about the same price, then why would people ever use battleships. You just run the faucet as hard and as fast as possible and the increased chance of death is completely negated in barely any time just because of how fast you run shit.
---
Dude. You saved my trader life :)
---
Great advice! so many people would be having a better time in game I believe if they were willing to expand their in game horizons a bit.
---
No I just mean people can asset safety their stuff out before the structure dies and deny you the money.
---
In wormholes they self destruct stuff and deny you the money. Nullsec is less punishing in that regard, but the logic is the same. You get tax only from those who didn't deny.
---
PS: countering citadel spam is one of the intents though
---
EVE Pride
---
&gt; It spreads out umbrellas of large alliances
---
What does?  Lowering the number of anoms spawned?  Because you haven't explicitly said that.
---
&gt;You're called a racist because you assume it is the Chinese and only the Chinese playerbase that bots, there are bots everywhere and from every nationality
---
I find it a bit troubling how quick people are jumping on this idea that those criticizing the Chinese player base for botting are doing so because of racism, i don't think nobody is denying the prevalence of botters from other countries. And i agree with the arguments presented here in this thread by some that the vast majority of the botting happens due to economic incentives in these countries rather than a cultural aspect of it.
---
At least from my perspective (which may be very limited as i haven't been very engaged with nullsec power blocs for the past couple of years) the biggest concern i saw from people about the Chinese player base was about the stories we all heard about the Chinese server. It wasn't a "grr the Chinese" it was a "grrr Serenity", because pretty much every story we heard about the economy in that server painted a very dark picture, and and the main reason given about the situation in that server was in relation to the prevalence of botters in their Server, and people were (in my opinion) understandably worried that an influx of that same player base could also exacerbate the issue that TQ have already been experiencing in relation to botting even further.
---
Of course i could be wrong and its just racism masquerading as something else, i'm sure that is true for some, but at least to me, i didn't see many examples of blatant racism against the Chinese player base, again not saying they don't exist, but i haven't seen any reason for people to be so defensive about it here on reddit.
---
Also i don't agree with your point about the Russians, they were definitely getting hit by some of the same arguments that are being leveled against the Chinese players, as well as arguments against Russians that were borderline hate speech mostly in relation to the botting issues plaguing the game. And of course if you were a Russian living in the drone regions, you were automatically a botter in the eyes of reddit a few years ago, so i mean, unless i'm missing something really fucked up happening with this community, i think the Chinese are getting basically the same treatment that the Russians got. Maybe the Chinese are getting a slightly worse treatment because they all need plex to keep their accounts omega (AFAIK they don't have any other method to pay for a sub with real money in China for the TQ server, please correct me if i'm wrong on that) so they will put more pressure on the Plex market than people from other countries that have normal access to the TQ.
---
I don't think ccp would invest resources to do something they already have rats doing. And maybe trig ships too, we'll see.
---
Yes. It's a long proposal with some math involved, so would be nicer if you to read the original post before discussing here if interested.
---
Admit the CSM knows more about the game than CCP does.
---
The real point.
---
I’ll take this guys idea and offer 0.09% difference!
---
If people become suddenly interested in clearing citadels, than the spam is an asset for CCP to keep a portion of the playerbase playing and subbing. NPC solutions almost never work.
---
I CAN DREAM DAMMIT
---
An actual genuine reply congratulating a new player for success. Where the fuck am I and who took my reddit.
---
Fuck it, I'll take the isk sink at this point.
---
TFW even the page that tells you about the upcoming unfinished mechanics is itself an unfinished mechanic.
---
Gettin' vibes about EVE Online entering a watered down form of maintenance mode. :(
---
Yeah, weren't they supposed to arrive around December of last year?
---
TBH I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't even an internal roadmap.
---
Maybe that's what you do. It's not what the majority of people do. Can just look at literally any day on the w-space zkill page and see that that's the case.
---
&gt; if they find more BS farming in C5s rather than capitals, it means people do more BS farming than capital farming.
---
Yea, but your friend is making the assumption that everyone can fly caps and battleships, but people are picking battleships. 
---
If you have a newer player then chances are they can't fly caps. However, he can do the pretty easy train into a tinker rattle, or nestors, or leshaks and start krabbing decently quick. Who's going to rat more often? The fresh J space and low SP dudes. You aren't entirely sure on how reactions are run, getting p0-p4 setup on multiple toons is a hastle you dont want to do for a while(assuming you have multiple characters), and hacking/explo really sucks compared to everything else, so you're gonna rat. 
---
I can see the SP of everyone who's ever applied to MCAV and leme tell you, the majority of players aren't ***picking*** Leshaks over dreads.
---
As the head of recruitment for the largest esi verification recruiting corporation in the game, my only advice is do not give your entire existence in game to finding new people. Don't forget to go have fun.
---
It can quickly become not fun when all you do is get other people going and in your corp, and finding you have little time left for you, which ultimately leads to burnout.
---
Keep having fun, and fuck the haters. (Maybe it's just me who has the haters?)
---
I think thats what I love about Eve. The learning curve is so high, the only people who make it past are fairly intelligent making for some really challenging and interesting interactions.
---
How many reddit alts did you create to upvote this?
---
:surprised_pikachu:
---
oh neat a line goon who doesn't understand the point of a change not aimed at his group
---
&gt;It's not what the majority of people do
---
The whole argument is that battleships are safe and people are picking them over dreads. I'm saying that there're more people using battleships because more people use them. Not because they're safer than dreads, but because it's a couple of skill injectors and boom you're in a nestor, or a rattle, or whatever doing some really easy krabbing. 
---
&gt;Maybe that's what you do
---
I was told to not train dreads on my main a buy an alt. I don't have the isk to get a dread alt, and I don't want to have to plex or pay for 2 accounts.
---
Don't play anymore but Tuzzy always loved your knowledge, good stuff.
---
&gt;Edit: It appears the table exceeds the page width but if you just expand your browser you should see all of it. If someone knows how to get reddit's editor to format the table better let me know, otherwise just deal with it.
---
The destruction is too girthy.
---
hope those undefended small structure grinds were fun with those 1400 titans that were logged in for the KS!
---
Don't you love eve 2019 with fozzie sov and citadel mechanics ........
---
at least when Goons evaced all the north in one go the attackers only had to deal with one of those mechanics
---
I made that one video where I miraculously defeated an 8 person gank solo, mostly due to their bad decisions but also due to an unconventional dual rep Stratios with dual Thukker Large Cap Batteries.
---
A couple days after the video posted demand for these batteries doubled, with prices staying inflated for a long time. And in general seeing more cap batteries on covops solo ships where previously cap boosters were more common.
---
Anyway I didn't consider my video would be so popular or I probably would have bought out Jita of cap batteries myself.
---
needs more :tallsting:
---
it's possible you have some form of script disabled in your browser that's stopping it from running, maybe html5 or java
---
Its a soup, since its a main component of the meal, but not a broth since it's not cooked
---
The meta has already changed to adapt to the absence of proper money moons! Just rent out your space to a bunch of totally not robots.
---
There was a time I thought nullsec folk were bold and courageous. It seems they are just as risk averse as your average highsec carebear. 😁
---
Isn’t the mantra: more risk = more reward?
---
I do love myself a good spreadsheet.
---
didn't want ... that ... anyway ..?
---
Did not bother me one bit to grind your structures.  Actually I rather enjoyed it.  Should have been done last year.  Look forward to you building a new sand castle so I can come back and do it to you again.
---
Use MWD to run away/chase down target/kite
---
Use AB to scram kite/mitigate damage within scram range
---
Made me chuckle a bit too loud, but exactly what I imagined haha! Also: new merch confirmed? (I'd buy this, for sure!)
---
GF. Yall really got us. Our western Tribute income has been destroyed and our memberbase is shrinking: 8 people left NC. today.
---
Have a feeling this is fake but have my upvote anyways stranger
---
&gt;Current market shows:
---
&gt;Eagle: 314m
---
&gt;Mach: 370m
---
Nightmare: 509 (where the mach was before the nerf). It's just supply and demand, any nerfs to 10/10s is simply making the little guy who pve work harder to get them, it does not make them more expensive.
---
The reason the nightmare did not increase or drop in price is because it is still in demand to replace the mach, however your solution which would result in the nightmare costing 800 mil, would result in people flying shield machs if they cant' afford them (and they do) because even a nerfed out mach is still better than a tempest fleet issue, which is (and this is really the important point), not THAT much better than a tempest or a maelstrom of half its cost.
---
There is also a point of how the meta works as I am sure you know, you either go cheap and cheerful or go blingy and OP, high-end alliances field 900mil nightmares and not so rich alliances or mega ones field tempests, this is not due to cost or money usually, just doctrines, the faction BSes have no place especially with current stats and fitting difficulty on it.
---
&gt;1400 titans
---
when you can't even get actual intel anymore and have to just throw numbers out
---
What is the last aura tip exactly?
---
I suppose it depends on how you define "new".  Any player less than a year old injecting capitals is exceptionally dedicated via either grinding or credit card.  I'm more receptive to the idea that injectors are helpful to midgame players (a year to a few years in) really looking to accelerate their growth (the only time I've used them materially), but that's really not NPE any more, and it's not helping at the point Eve loses the most players (the first few days).  Extreme PLEXers aside, you're not affording a cap alt's worth of injectors on VNI ticks, salvaging, or explo.  You might earn a few but those are more likely going into fitting skills, doctrine ships, and so on on the main, not ground-up cap alts.
---
The meta being so capital heavy is its own problem that should be fixed on its own merits.  The answer isn't "a cap for every newbie", it's "make a newbie useful without a cap".
---
“Destroy the Seeker by clicking the ‘Primary Weapon’ button on your HUD.
---
“Destroy both Seekers to complete your mission.”
---
Alright. That’ll work if I can’t do this.
---
This was in a week or so period, and our rorqual miners just discovered this is an enjoyable alternative to mining spod 24/7. You should make a spreadsheet with a dropdown box for "*Western Tribute*" substitution.
---
I thought you single handedly destroyed the goons... what happened?
---
Look for the Intergalactic Summit in the forums and in game look for the OOC and The Summit chat channels those are your best starting points in game to talk to people who do the more in depth roleplay.
---
AHAHAHA I remember BAKED getting fucked, that shit was great.  What a bunch of mongs.  I miss old-school clan wars, back before the days of retard strikes and box grind burnout.  Chip era clan wars was SO much better than 2.0 it's not even funny.  Talk about a game company being unable to get out of their own way.  Literally every change made to clan wars after the removal of disconnected gold collection made them worse.  Literally 100%.
---
It’s busy enough that there are people hunting me every time I take the Prospect-Venture fleet out.
---
Well goons lost an i-hub.
---
*Looking at my nyx always supported by several Fax and other supers from my Corp whenever i undock*
---
I dont know
---
Not sure. I was hoping there would be a key word that might be missed by a newer player lol. But it seems like it just says kill the two enemy ships lol. Not sure why it’s not working.
---
Hmm. Alright. I’m assuming it’s some kind of bug or other. Not a huge deal but it’d be nice to finish this one.
---
&gt; Total value of everything destroyed, that we can account for: **$800,562,155,829.48 isk** 
---
You should start with that.
---
Very nice. Thank you.
---
Large cap battery
---

Great story.

I remember reading this quite a while ago. It was really really helpful for describing and visualizing the missile mechanics.
---
Reminds me of Clash of Kings, Rise of Empire and Titan thrones!
---
WTB DELVE BUTCHER'S BILL..
---
Jaguar dual prop is scary because it can hunt things down and then range control or tight orbit even if scrammed. Makes it deadly against both big toys and other frigates.
---
Without a shred of doubt.
---
Flower is good people. Thanks for standing up for the guy.
---
Make blops anti-cap stealth bombers. Fuck cap blobs.
---
Think it just passed a tril with the titan kill a few hours back. Might be more idk haven’t checked myself
---
sexy!
---
doesn't matter had sex
---
Thank you very much :D
---
The hero we need but not that we deserve.
---
The groups make the safety them selves by committing more then the attackers. In fact most of your Whalers dont commit anything at all including you.
---
Content is a two way street. A lot of what killed roaming was roaming comps became unengageable. Forcing defenders to also bring unengageable comps. This leads to no one having fun. 
---
Making defense fleets not being able to deal with aggressors will do the exact same thing.
---
No. I’m saying you should stop crying foul when you started it.
---
Goons aren't known for their ability to tackle (or so the meme goes) :p
---
lol he actually thought that dscan was real? I thought NC. member were suppose to be smart?
---
Burner missions, dude
---
I appreciate your answer. I guess I inferred that you were looking to put a fleet of blops BS on field not just a few. Of course after rereading your answers, it would make sense that you would only need a couple on field and some mobile cyno inhibits to shut down the  cynos. I like your answers and your video. You'll get my vote.
---
Would you support WH spawn rates being proportional to the amount of npc's killed in an area?
---
The people losing suppers in delve are idiots, they deserve it.
---
Why?
---
Nice! 
---
Is it that shitty Final fantasy game? That had a similar gameplay. I played because my cousin invited me to it. Super boring, all they do is click and farm.  Everyone's goal is to blue up, farm, do some token wars and fighting but all in all, strive for world Peace, kinda like TAPI over here.
---
I just gave up on it.
---
With making it really possible for us to verify this story, I'm not really convinced either. But I liked the gist of the story and dislike that kind of "mobile games".
---
Unfortunatly you really dont understand lowsec and the true players there
---
Removal of passive moon mining ruined lowsec for content drivers
---
Most left at that point either disbanding or liie snuff and transfering more to nullsec
---
Its less the 'old guard growing older ' and more people wanting to stay in lowsec for content
---
But lowsec content nowadays is basically "im going to hit your structure that i dont care about, in the hopes you will fight me"
---
Did you take your meds today Hans? We are worried here
---
Maintenance when they’re moving the engine to 64 bit and completely redid the agency and just added a trig invasion.
---
Maybe CCP would pay attention to the shit that’s actually broken if people didn’t complain about EVERY &amp;£%#@ing thing!
---
EvE is a really fun game once you get past the learning curve. I hope you stick with it.
---
If only he knew that was just goons
---
They can use T2 missiles now.
---
I’ll try. It’s super complex and deep and I’m so far enjoying it. I’m amazed at the size of the world.
---
I suggest checking out some tutorials on youtube and the EVE University WIki, add me up; I'll help you out when i can! PM me your character!
---
I mean if a fake dscan is made to exaggerate one side by them, ima use it in the same context.
---
Karmafleet and Brave require you to apply out of game and then they’ll invite you after they see if you look like a spy or not. 
---
Pandemic Horde will accept in a few hours, because we decided it wasn’t worth trying to keep spies out when they get in anyway when you accept players that new. 
---
Eve university is extremely complicated to get into, but according to some people it’s worth it, I personally can’t comment on that
---
I dont play EVE, but damn, I need to install it today!
---
What I meant was if a region is over farmed, that specific region spawns less anamolies, forcing farmers to expand and find new spaces...
---
Just join fleets by other FCs. Mar5hy isn’t the only one doing them
---
Any plans to cover Dead Co rapid expansion into Tenal?
---
If only there was a repository of stories like this somewhere.
---
Muhh queeen
---
You Win have fun playing with yourself.
---
You make me laugh out loud.
---
I hope it's all real, and it's impressive!
---
Because this game really feels like there hasn't been any direction in the better part of a decade. It's littered with half-finished features and ideas that were never iterated upon.
---
Would NC/PL/friends have a way of proving to test they wouldn't put a knife in their back, but instead fight goons with TEST?
---
Because without that guarantee, TEST is never gonna take a swing at goons. The best they could do currently is a defensive stalemate, and the odds on that are long. very long.
---
Doesn't change the fact that they're losing stuff, just like PanFam pulling shit with last-minute structure transfers doesn't change the fact that they're losing stuff.
---
imagine having like half the supers in the game, taking all of africa to grind through this cancer and actually losing more from dying brainlets huffing rocks and bounties and then posting this.
---
Don't worry it doesn't count since you didn't defend them. At least according to the NER.
---
Look up Spectre Fleet or Bombers Bar
---
PanFam knows the war is lost, this has been common knowledge from Day 1. The objective of PanFam is simply to inflict as much damage and to drag the war on for as long as possible. So if the Goons show up in full force to grind down an empty structure then PanFam has achieved their objective.
---
Note that I said "achieved their objective" and not "won". PanFam isn't winning by any definition of the term, but they are at least achieving their objective of making the Goons pay for every system.
---
Hahah wtf, listing POCO's. How many Warrior 1's too?

The first war involving most of nullsec would have been in like 2008, with Bob + pets vs goons + Russia + NC (no dot).

I think I shall!

Haha! I sure love you for all the YT videos. Especially the beginning ones when you started your first trip to loot in Nullsec! So much fun to watch! These got me into Eve as well about 2 or 3 years ago.

I was actually really proud of a successful delivery killmail I got from ‚Von Dryder‘ /WindspanTT back in the days in my little Magnate exploring WHs!

I read your SB guide so often and trained up skills for weeks to finally fly one.

Well, thanks for playing the biggest part the first half a year of my Eve life as a mentor I never met :) !!

Can we get AARs for the fights to go with the numbers please. Good aar makes the numbers better

&gt; I've been saying the powerblocs desperately need something to throw their supercap fleets at,

Why? The supercap fleets killed fun pvp in eve. The less content they ever have for those ships, the better.

Inb4 the standard goon response saying dying in delve while being on deployment means it doesn't matter but then continuing to post on a daily basis claiming that bashing NC. undefended structures somehow does.

What a baller.

Not even CCP has the roadmap

Goonswarm in 2007? Rifterswarm

are you talking about war of the vikings or something because that game is utter shit.

But Delve!?

I am really unsure if there is *any* other content other than that. Unrestricted spam of citadels has obliterated faction warfare and lowsec content.
---
AAR: Panfam JC's north, kills dumb ratters, comes home.

Goons bash abandoned structures.

Cool story Hansel.

Well if we're counting pocos, might as well add the missed delve ticks.

The past couple years have been really tough on Lee Blackwood.  He had a crippling divorce, lived out of his car, and held two full time jobs to make ends meet.  Through all of that he built a Corp that grew to be sinners.  Over the past year even though he has been trying to build up the business he had to let go of due to his divorce, he has paid for servers for pathfinder and ts3 for his Corp.   On nights he was unavailable because he was spending time with his kids he would still make sure he had stuff moving for his Corp in the forms of ops and content.  Lee gave a lot to the Corp and was rewarded by a power grab.  Those of you in Sinners had
---
 an opportunity to support someone who was in need.  You failed.  You had an opportunity to comfort a friend who needed compassion.  You failed.  You had an opportunity to rise up above the toxicity that eve is known for to create a warming story that would inspire others.  You again failed.  Shame on you for claiming this is for the greater good after having a meeting when he cannot speak for himself.  In my Corp when my ceo was having trouble making time for eve the directors stood up and took on more responsibility.   We didn't usurp him.  That is what friends do for each other.  When my video card took a dump my Corp mates started a go fund me and bought me a new one.  That is what friends do for each other.  Don't sugar coat a coup as something other than what it is.
---
same thing happened to me too... started playing in 2008... and since then i cannot stand PVP in any other game.

it's just not the same... no perma loss... no real shakes...

I've been working on a Campaign Generator website that sets groups of Corp/Alliances against the other, so I can help answer that.

    Between 5th of March and the 5th of June - 
---
    NC./PL/PH         killed 1.84 trillion
---
    Goons/Init/TNT    killed 1.27 trillion
---
This is the true power of weaponized autism.
---
Well let me rephrase that.  
---
There will always be some ships that are bad and some ships that are better in doin the things you wish the other ships to do well.
---
Fast tackling with sustainable tackle? = Assault frigs. And there are other options than the ramjag, wich is just the strongest at the moment.  
---
I agree that combat ceptors are trash atm but turning them in Ass-frigs plus interdiction nully and tackle range and warp speed will just give us another power creep.
---
It is a good meme though. :D
---
You could still .01 ISK other peoples but orders to some extent. 
---
If We are both selling for the same price and you lower yours by 0.1% then I’ll just lower mine by 0.1% plus 0.01 ISK. This would then force you to lower your prices by at least 0.1% if you want to beat my sell order, but I can keep 0.01 ISKing you, but you won’t be able to do that to me as my sell orders are just yours minus 0.01 ISK (as 0.01ISK should be less than 0.1%)
---
Is CVA to TAPI as TAPI is to Goons? Obedient sparring partners with no serious drama.

These shovelware pay2win games are such potentially lucrative tear-mining facilities I'm surprised EVE players haven't set up a weekly festival for invading and toppling them.

idk, i kind of feel like the charlie sheen version of winning right now
---
Then fit them yourself, there's no requirements to fitting rigs as of like 5 years ago, and modules will just be offline if you can't use them.
---
Oh, TEST doesn't have to take a swing on our behalf. Once they're done with us, there isn't much else, only that you're up next.
---
I had this same idea more or less, and was told by a few people who were either on the CSM or had spoken with devs that it was never going to happen.  It's a shame, but I think if enough people pushed for it we could maybe get it into game.  I always liked passive alliance income and wish it would come back.

"Pirate battleship BPC need a drop rate nerf from DEDs."

Blops ships them self are not the problem. And people whine because the widow is not the solo-pwn-mobile anymore. It´s still usefull as the other ECM ships, in a FLEET. But the "meta" of ratting/pve has changed in a way that there is simply no need to bring BLOPS or you just dont want to because a insured carrier is cheaper.
---
The marauder is fine IMO, its a pve ship and not a pvp ship dont mix that up. But it´s a great pve ship with some really niche features. 
---
Pesky ewar? Bring a marauder.
---
Need that extra tank? Bring a marauder
---
Fast repositioning with mjd? Bring a marauder (there is a great vid about that)
---
Link the fit for us to see
---
Actually, why not. At least it made me smile, thanks :)
---
'Didn't want that structure anyway'
---
Yeah, good luck replacing all those structures without any PI materials.
---
Every time I read something like this it just makes me want to play Eve.
---
Oh yeah mb, when I get a chance to go online I’ll link it..
---
Are they making goons pay?
---
At this point I'm scared the insurance on my ships will expire before they die.
---
Theyre called NPSI(not purple shoot it) fleets. (As the people in fleet turn purple on your overview. But you could get in trouble with your own corp or alliance as you could end up shooting them (Remember, Not purple, shoot it.)

sweet ill send a application when i hop back on my main PC

When Eve Player joins other game. Average IQ in boty game Rise.

Dual prop is a pretty specialized fit. I use it on a phantasm most of the time but a phantasm also has an AB bonus which helps a lot.
---
Why do you think Legacy is bringing in alliances anywhere they can find them?
---
They know the fight is coming. If they can get supremacy in AUTZ, they'll survive. If they can get parity in USTZ, they can fight back.
---

---
Yeah, like it started off with like 1 or 2 of these games... but now? There’s like literally dozens of them; basically the same game but reskinned... tho there was one I found that tried to bring some new things to the table, and I respect them for that, freshened things up; game is Rise of Kingdoms if anyone was going to ask
---
Are Ranger regiment and PL fighting in Tenal?  I see sov flipping but no idea wtf is going on with this invasion of Tribute/Tenal, who's helping who and how's it going?  Also is anyone in the Northwest helping or are they returning the favor and saying 'you're turn to get screwed.'
---
HK lost a hole to Init...
---
After this post though?  That gauntlet has been thrown.
---
All losses count it's not that difficult to wrap the mind around.
---
\&gt;  I valued them based on current salvage market prices to replace them to rebuild.   
---
inflated the numbers. gotcha
---
Good read. Thx
---
u/Just_fearless already mentioned basicly all of the secrets there is to recruit (at least known to me), but I'd like to add one more thing.
---
As I have been a recruiter for several Corps already, it might be a good idea to go out into the public recruitment channels and put a Corp ad up, as it worked out for me quite well for me in the past. After having a well-written describtion of your Corp up, post it in the public recruiting text channels and post it with a similar format, to make it more appealing
---
&lt;Corp ad&gt;  
---
|&gt; &lt;Corp feature&gt;  
---
&lt;welcoming message&gt;! For further question join &lt;corp recruitment text channel link&gt; 
---
You can repost it over every \~2 minutes and people will get back to you. Different from the "spam mail" concept, hear you reach a large crowd of people who are actually interested in joining a Corp.
---
Fly safe o7
---
How do you intend to 'break the wheel' when you have some serious communication issues? I mean this sincerely. You have a tendency to just say your way or the highway then start calling everyone trolls (to the point they just start fucking with you). You also have an *intense* need to associate opinion with space guilds regardless of the opinion presented. With these 2 things in particular in mind - how do you plan to propose and work with CCP in a business professional manner to actually accomplish things? How do you plan to properly represent a diverse player base when you are against the, likely, vast majority of it?
---
As if this hasn't been like eve has always been
---
Interested in your site.    
---
Please do keep us updated!
---
Killing stuff in a warzone
---
Killing stuff/people too stupid to know the alliance is deployed.
---
I'll let you decide which is more important.
---
It wasn't a Goon dscan, lol. Jesus the NC. recruitment standard is really going down hill.
---
&gt;inflated the numbers. gotcha
---
lol imagine being this retarded.
---
If you're serious about starting your own Corp, [listen to this](https://crossingzebras.com/new-eden-story-time-episode-7-with-tim-nering/). 
---
Some very quick tldr:
---
* you're going to be responsible for your Corp's activity. 
---
* have goals. Define them as clearly as possible and make a plan to achieve them.
---
* having any plan is better than having no plan.
---
* never abandon your Corp's fun.
---
NOW as for recruiting: there's going to be a lot of turnover at first. This happens, it's no biggie. Focus on retention through content. Also, don't take it too seriously if people come in just to troll or whatever. Thirdly, people are gonna probably say things about spais or thieves or whatever. Mostly this shit comes from disgruntled corp members. Happy corp members don't steal.
---
Finally, this is all just general advice. I don't know shit about hisec specifically.
---
I would think yes and no. If CVA decided to turn on test they still wouldn't be a threat. But Test has the numbers and supers/caps to be an issue for goons if they were to stop being so agreeable.
---
Dragoons*
---
Hilarious story but hard to read, can you please create paragraphs :(
---
You running for csm?
---
Sure, loses in the home turf matter, but its about who loses the most. A lot of people would argue that loosing all of your infrastructure is probably worse... Because in a month or so, goons will go back to turbo crabing and everything for them will be more or less the same as before. But NC/PL - we'll see what they will do and when will they get back on their feet properly.
---
Sure, lossing some astras is nothing, but loosing rigged manufacturing citadels, loosing moon mining infrastructure, loosing PI infrastructure, clone bays, jump bridges, supercapital citadels etc etc. Sure, one thing is how much its worth, but putting all that stuff up again is a totally different matter and is a real pain in the ass - just ask any logistics/infrastructure bros... Especially if your manufacturing and PI infrastructure is destroyed and you have to import the stuff... Not to mention - what should we even put up if the goons are gonna come back in 6-12 months and clean it all out again?
---
I swear to god, if I hear this "welfare" argument again I'm going to stab a bitch. We're supposed to be playing a game here, not working a second job. The point of the sandbox is that should you WANT to make it your job, you can do that, but there should be more than one way to play, which is not the case today on neither a player nor a corp/alliance level.
---
I doubt you've even been playing that long, otherwise you'd know that today's EVE is nowhere near as alive as it used to be. Look at burn jita, lowest value ever destroyed in this last one. Everyone is complaining about lack of content, pve is still grindy, PvP is getting absurdly grindy if any kind of structure is involved. You may disagree with what needs change, but SOME change must happen, and op's idea is even tried and tested.
---
Imagine that the height of your gameplay is killing undefended turbokrabbers too dumb to realize whats going on.
---
Well, if you wanna say they are undefended citadels so they don't count, then Goons can say the turbokrabbers are undefended and don't count. 
---
Pick a narrative.
---
Alas, I wish I was a confident enough personality to undertake such a noble task. And had the spare time.
---
As an ex wormholer, I sympathize with the current state of  unknown space that you're put through every time you login.
---
My vote goes to Omelca Gold in the hope we get some reasonable change to nullsec and wormhole mechanics.
---
Fly dangerous.
---
I could only imagine the panic
---
You seem mad that no one cares that you're blowing up undefended turbo krabbers too dumb to deploy.
---
Grats on grinding structures I guess
---
\+1
---
i hope they don't target things with hangars, because finding unmanned treasure trove POSes is just about the only fun thing left in low sec outside of FW.
---
Contrary, I hope instead of deleting old citadels, they add ways for players to "hack" long-abandoned citadels to steal the loot inside.
---
Good job, however that wall of text could use a few paragraphs.
---
Well goons went there to burn sturctures - if they track this kind of stuff it is nice to know information.         
---
Like NCPL will need to spend a lot to rebuild stuff and the goon campaign is just starting.
---
lol
---
This is an quite unpopular truth among NCPL.
---
Always nice to see the rest of the story, thanks!
---
He is a prepubescent teenager.
---
lol bragging about killing ihubs and citadels ))
---
The game's name? Albert Einstein.
---
While you grind those structures - if you see any unanchored NPC gate, will buy 2 for a small project of my own.
---
That would be a hard no.
---
Titans sometimes die even in the umbrella.  Rorquals die.  Supers die.  There's a background level of people being dumb.  There's probably a higher background level in Delve than elsewhere.  So subtract that (you'd have to spend hours trawling through zkill to work it out) from the bill.
---
He doesn't go to Tama because he'd die to the ngsc
---
Halfway I realized you are not 15 years old, just your main is.
---
Nice work.
---
Having just read the comments....this is actually spicey stuff now.  
---
The founding of the corp was not what is it was described as in previous comments, and the facts are lost in the details and the spinmaster shenanigans going on here would be good....if they were in any way true. 
---
The agreement was not lived up to by the founding membership, and I'm not talking about myself here.
---
My RL was not something for 6 people to decide what was good for me on, at all.  In fact the 'discussion' was not even ALL the directors, and a few of them had no business in those chats as they weren't actual directors, but they filled a purpose of rabble and so they had a say in the highest end of Sinner's leadership.  S'pose they are directors now.
---
My decision to leave EvE had no real bearing on anything other than the way things had been heading the past 4 months or so. 
---
Ultimately, my departure from Sinner's was a power grab, the structures were stripped of fittings and the directors were fully ready to reinforce them and kill if I had taken the low road and disputed their decision.
---
That wouldn't have bothered me to see the fortizars and outlaying structures die, my hand stayed with my willingness to burn my membership, as it was clearly less than the director's will to hurt whoever to achieve control. This is what happens when people have secret meetings and want to pull a fast one.  I saw the potential for it coming and no one had roles to slip the structures out from under Corp control, again, I was protecting my membership and I am not sorry.  Ultimately, after the meeting I just decided the best course was to walk, I gave them the structures as all my valuables and recouperative costs were wisely gone from Sinner's home. I'm out of it and my hands are washed of Sinner's to whatever end they meet.
---
The idea was to use me for the benefit of a few, to be the workhorse and be a pawn in a culture and wormhole corp that I was instrumental in creating.
---
There was no invitation to remain a director, there was no conversation with me at all. I was talked at by the 'lead FC' and it wasn't a conversation, it was being talked at about decisions already made before the 'vote'...days before the vote.  I knew it was bullshit then and made my own preparations.  Which was started when I asked why the structures had their fittings removed.  Not a single word before than was exchanged about the 'problems' the leadership is crutching on. 
---
The last time talks of a new CEO was attempted, as I was there, it was a near unanimous vote to keep me as CEO.  The last and final meeting happened in a purely political and coordinated manner. One I wasn't to be there, two the strings of eve politics were pulled for months beforehand behind the scenes to gain support.  Three only directors that would support were let into the secret convo's and at the meeting. 
---
After all was said and done, The directors/leadership played other games per the usual in another ts channel in the 2 days I remained in corp. There was ZERO effort to extend any words with me aside from line members extending their apologies and many confided that the meeting left them feeling shit and they did not like it. 
---
After the verbal bashing I was given at the meeting, why would the leadership connect with me in any way?
---
The only actual director with the nuts to come talk to me during and after my departure wasn't even involved in the decision to kick me....
---
At this point it is another Eve story, and not a shabby one at that.
---
Should I ever come back, it will be with a purpose and I will create content once again.
---
Until then o7
---
For what it is worth you have my vote my dude. I hope for a day when I will drop my Nag on a Delve mining fleet without being DD'd after 3.7s
---
Overall, pretty much yeah. They're actually putting up a decent fight, not docking up and spinning ships as much as people claim. Credit where credit's due, I've seen Goons chicken out of more fights than PanFam these last two weeks.
---
So what you're saying is that CCP should 'suggest' to other mmo publishers that it sure would be a pity if anything *bad* were to happen to their games, perhaps they'd like to show a little appreciation to CCP for keeping us all busy here....?
---
Why? This just seems like a desperate attempt to mitigate Goon losses, just as trying to do the same to Horde would be. Just accept that PanFam is killing people in Delve, stupid or not.
---
Passive moon mining was VERY wrong for the whole game.  Simple.. if you want to make billions of isk then there are MANY other ways to do it.  Dont be lazy mine the good moons then isk is still there. Basically you want to sit on your fat lazy asses and expect money to just arrive.  Fuck that.  Dont adapt then you die and that's life get over it.  I mean tbh it's got worse youre now seeing massive rental empires and alliances now renting the friggibn moons so it's even more passive than before! SC cooks have rented low sec moons.  It's not right either that one alliance owns the whole of fucking lowsec either.  Snuff stopped being snuff when they ejected donnie who was old school snuff. 
---
Low sec still had plenty of stuff going on but no we only can fight with caps! 
---
Go move to null and have a low sec presence that's what jump clones are for. Stop making excuses and blaming CCP.  Yes they've messed a lot up but seriously this is purely down to inactive FCs.
---
And this is the problem, alliances rely heavily on active FCs. How many alliances die when they become in active.. many many do... this is why you should constantly train new upcoming FCs
---
*That* went for *$250*?
---
&gt;eBay auctions seem to sell like shit on these
---
Not hard to see why, tbh.
---
Dude. **Paragraph breaks**.
---
Hurr durr, infrastructure is worthless.
---
What the market needs is just more clarity and depth. We should see who we are buying from. We should give corporations ways to provide discounts and benefits to allies as well as refusal to sell items to hostiles, neutrals, or any configuration we like. We also need more benefits to sell items in different locations. I would also remove the possibility of selling the same item multiple times on the same character or corp. And finally I think the modification of items needs to be increased to at least 10 mins. 
---
Do all that and you have a far better market.
---
Why?  Because there's a background level of losses across the game that every alliance experiences.  You're comparing combined losses of Delve + Deployment.  I'm sure the level of losses in Delve has gone up but I'm also sure it's pretty high to begin with.  
---
It's possible to compute it though I do not have the time.  You can do it on a regional basis.  Once you've done it, you'll see losses due to the war, which is what this thread is about.
---
Come on, man, at least make your scams somewhat not obvious.
---
Yeah, they sold for $250 at retail. They're actually *really* nice, I wish I could get some pictures of mine, really good detail. They're a little bigger than a foot long.
---
Can you fuckoff with your scams on Reddit pls ty
---
It's called Nanogang and it is unironically the most fun you will ever have in a fleet.
---
nice video anyway :-)
---
Imagine the height of your gameplay is killing undefended structures.
---
If the citadels were forfeited, then so were the krabs left behind in Delve :P. Let's keep our narratives straight. Both are undefended, both are losing about the same amount of value. Both sides claim to not care about what is happening in their home and point to what is happening in the enemy's space. If you're going to accept one side of that, you should accept the other. 
---
Either way, it's great news for industrialists and traders.
---
Nice video. GF.
---
I mean, if they look better than the picture you provided then sure, $250 seems reasonable. But from the image you put up it looks like some cheap Chinese knock-off cast in a bad mold. I'm willing to believe it's just a bad image, though.
---
Those structures are within jump range of their supercapitals. The turbo krabbers in Delve? Nobody around to save em. Pick a narrative.
---
Damm, nice wheels on those goalposts of yours
---
That number looks a lot less impressive if you just say 800b.
---
Actually I think he does fly with implants sometimes, it's reasonably safe to do in LS even if your ship is on the cheap side, and it can surprise people to see a 5M ISK Slasher flying circles around them at 4km/s. But it's by no means a requirement
---
And those structures aren't in range of your supers too I guess ? Which you totally aren't outnumbering ?
---

I've never seen nanogang describe a gang of frigate but more ships fitted with nanifiber structure in order to kit away easily.
---
Anyone under panfam in priority on the "shit on" list is part of the imperium if you ask panfam
---
I don't get why ppl are trying to hype this goon deployment. You are superior in numbers, you could do everything in eve.  You are like a capenter whos bragging about every nail he hits, unfortunatly you just build the eve coffin.
---
Undocking until ISBox Setup of 10 Rorqus is warped to Colossal and TACO + NEAR2 are running so you can tab out the undocked accounts as there is noo risk or challenge .... just grind. Yes, that I am not undocking for ...
---
I'm not sure on why that matters? Are you seriously trying to debate that killing individual turbo krabbers is hurting the Imperium more than PanFam losing coalition assets. If that is your argument, there really is point in arguing with you, you're just not smart enough to understand coalition vs personal assets.
---
I am curious to see if Pamfam is going to replace the infrastructure that was lost once the Imperium achieves its objective and heads back to delve. Deciding to rebuild it with the possibility of the Imperium coming back in 6-12 months to do it all over again would be a tough choice to gamble on. It's also possible they abandon the region and consolidate in Malpais permanently, forgoing the costly expense of rebuilding Tributes infrastructure. 
---
Another thing to watch is if Dead Co will absorb Tribute as well once the Imperium departs since they are in the process of taking Tenal.
---
I'm not even sure I would disapprove in this case. You can have no more of a cat but her skin, as they say.
---
Well, that and a cool story.
---
It's a forgivable mistake, but goons arent attacking CVA, they're attacking NCPL.
---
&gt;i saw that 6hours later the zkill page i clicked on his own main page, said still in test.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;kicked from test and a bot cleared. props
---
please read all comments on a thread or message line, clearly. i had been shown this.
---
doesnt change the fact what i saw was what i commented.
---
Well played, my dude. This is how mobile games should be done.
---
HAHAHA Test scrubs downvoting me for saying what i saw on Zkill.
---
i mean, not like i was being cancerous. was just stating what the evidence provided.
---
most of ncpl don't needs to krab there since alts in frat or any other crap alliance are common....
---
yeh, your a CVA goonswarm scrub.
---
and ive done nothing but fight them.
---
CVA, like goons even when they outnumber and opponent will call for backup, i have experianced this and no ones got a fight because of it. Anyone who thinks that isnt weak and cowardly is dumb, and wrong.
---
enjoyed the read ! you are cool !
---
Oh yeah because goons lost so many titans per month before they deployed right? Smart.
---
OMG, this has been here three days and now a saw it. Immediately posted it to my corpmates. This here is true art my friend! I salute you!
---
go ahead and drop these undefended astras with your 600 titans, everybody needs something to be proud of I guess....
---
Shooting timers for hours that nobody actually cares about.
---
Shooting krabs and the home deff fleet and earn some tears now and then.
---
I'll let you decide which is more fun.
---
Oï ! Welcome back to our wonderful New Eden, things have changed a lot :)
---
I must admit that it’s been only one year since I’m playing, so I won’t be able to fully answer all your questions, notably the one concerning a possible nerf to Sleipnir... But I’ll try to help you the best I can :)
---
I’m not sure on this one, but I think Storyline and Expeditions are marked as unavailable in your Agency because you currently don’t have any up. If you were to run an highsec combat anomaly and get lucky to have an escalation, I suppose the related section would open up and show you where your escalation is, what entities are roaming it and some more infos on Escalations in general.
---
Doing missions in lowsec with something as large as a Battlecruiser will mean your ship will meet its end sooner than if you ran missions in Highsec. I don’t really know if there’s a plus to doing missions in lowsec (higher ISK and LP payouts, maybe ?), but if you’re afraid of losing shiny ships, maybe invest in a Strategic Cruiser and configure it to warp cloaked (you don’t really need the Interdiction Nullification, as you’ll never meet any kind of bubble in lowsec). Strategic Cruisers can reach battleship level of tank and DPS in a cruiser frame, however you’ll be giving up the Command Bursts of your Command Ships (although TIII cruisers can also be configured to have Command Bursts, but they’ll be less effective at running missions then, and your boosts would probably be lower than a CS anyway).
---
Invasions can technically be soloed, but you’d need a brick tanked battleships with near perfect skills, or a Marauder. For now, I’d say they aren’t fun to run as a solo player if you don’t have an alt following you in a Salvaging destroyer, as all of the loot is contained in the wrecks (rats don’t have bounties on their heads, and killing them don’t reward you anything outside of their wrecks). Everyone already know this, so you’ll always be followed by ninja salvagers that will just try to steal your loot in total impunity, since salvaging doesn’t give them a suspect time (picking items from your wrecks does, however). Concerning the safe factor, Invasions are scaled in difficulty by how far the system you’re in is from the central system of the Invasions. Two jumps away is called perimeter systems, they are the easiest. One jump away, it’s adjacent systems, harder. And the Foothold system is like an Headquarter system for Sansha’s Incursions, it’s the hardest ans you’d need a strong fleet with Logistic support to take on the roaming fleets there. Multiple groups have already formed to run Invasions, so you could contact them, and maybe even join them if you like them enough :)
---
Pirate Strongholds themselves are quite tricky. They are defended by "Diamond" rats, special rats with a diamond in their name that have a way advanced AI compared to regular rats, and will often use tactics found in PVP fleets, like strong EWAR and logistics. Some fits using Rattlesnakes or spider-tanking Dominixes can take on those, but they are hard and the rewards are often not that great...
---
However, if you’re in a constellation with a Forward Operating Base (or FOB, another way of saying Pirate Strongholds), belts and gates rats will be changed to diamond rats, and if you don’t have positive standings with their respective factions (for now, Blood Raiders in the south or Guristas in the north), they’ll try to shoot your PVE ship if you don’t warp away quickly enough.
---
"Autothysian Lancers" are Drifter entities that are passive, even if they’ll always have a red icon. They will never shoot first, but they can apparently remember pilots that wronged them in the past. Don’t shoot them, and you’ll never get bothered by that OP Battleship you heard, as they don’t appear outside of two special sites with a warpable beacon : Jove Observatory and Unidentified Wormhole. Be careful tho, on those beacons, they will always be hostile. Apparently, some specialized fit can take them on, but the Battleship’s doomsday have enough power to one shot a sieged Marauder. You could always try to take them on with high DPS frigates, that can get under their guns, but you’d still lose one to the doomsday, unless you have a clone with the "Halo" implants that reduce your signature radius, and a ship with a low signature radius to begin with.
---
Hope this help :)
---
RMT.
---
Also, where is the question &gt;.&lt;
---
Your first argument was : 
---
&gt; Imagine that the height of your gameplay is killing undefended turbokrabbers too dumb to realize whats going on.
---
Which if your think structure bashing is any better / more fun than killing rorqual, you're wrong. Btw, those rorquals matter as much as structures. The whole point of why you are able to outnumber NC/PL supers is those rorquals. Those krabs stupid enough to krab during war time are those pumping up your peace time MER you're all jerking off about.
---
Your second point was :
---
&gt; Those structures are within jump range of their supercapitals.
---
Which is retarded, those structures are within the range of your own supers. This isn't peace time rorqual defense were you turbo stomp What do you want, them feeding their whole super fleet ?
---
Is killing krabers better or worst than killing structures ? Structures are worst to loose for sure, but stop trying to dodge arguments.
---
Don't forget to read a disclaimer on the site. I did, was not disappointed
---
That is fair, godspeed in your campaign
---
Did you really make a thread to complain about mean words? Seriously? Ironically you complain about him getting his friends to comment on your stuff and you respond by posting his info so people will go harrass him. Not your personal army, grow a thicker skin.
---
Don't forget the jump fuel!
---
Oï !
---
As said, you could get a trading/hauling in an NPC corp, so you aren’t bothered by Highsec wars when you need to do your trips there.
---
Another thing I can think of would be PI alts, to do PI stuff required in fuel blocks manufacturing so you can help your corporation with the fuel bills. However, having nine characters trained into PI can become a logistic nightmare, so be careful not to burn out !
---
woawoawoa, duuuuuuude you are living dangerous with such an opinion on reddit.
---
Unironically yeah, 800b isnt that much. Although obviously as it represents structures it's obviously a 'strategic hit'. In the end though it's about 10- 12 titans (fitted) or so..
---
I really hope we somewhere this year will see an epic big brawl with lots of titans dying due to reduced fax reps and 64 bit clients (i.e. less client side crashes).
---
To be honest I would've bet that OP is talking about Rise of Kingdoms if I didn't read dragons in his post. Nonetheless, that should paint a picture about how similar games like these are and how much truth there is in your words "basically the same game but reskinned" ...
---
It actually started at $125, the info I had originally was bad. I edited the post.
---
The old moon model was bad, but the defender HAD to fight if they wanted to keep their moon and their income.  Nowadays there's nothing to fight over.
---
Should have\*
---
&gt; What would stop huge coalitions then from getting those "unwanted" moons for themselves instead
---
Cost/benefit. For example NC would pretty quickly get fed up of deploying to Aridia to defend some moons that keep getting hit by 10 dudes.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
&gt; You can do anything and everything in that system
---
well... no and no, but I know what you mean.
---
hi thanks that was my comment and it was downvoted to oblivion
---
The principle sounds very familiar to most mobile game base builders. Had something like that with tanks to play during shitting on company toilet ... the amount of money the top 3 whales of the shard (1 of about 70) invested was hilarious (about 500 bucks per month), even more funny was it to troll them.
---
Current projection isn't even close to pre-phoebe. You can can cover maybe 15-20 light years if you don't care at all about stacking fatigue and can move home tomorrow. Back in that era you could literally jump to the other side of the map in 10 minutes.
---
mad lad, thx for the post.
---
Give titan Doomsday a 0.5% chance to remove 100% of your SP
---
If they come north again we get to farm Delve again. I wouldn't be surprised if structures start going back up before they start to go home, just to try and keep them up north for longer.
---
It's literal renter space that nobody cares about
---
"Cloaking device is in use" made me chuckle.
---
I mean, I *literally* just accidentally typed in 28th of June into the time frame, and set it off on gathering **every** single kill in my database, locking up both the website and the database.  So I'm still ironing out the bugs.  And it needs a visual redesign badly.
---
But TL:DR it's going to have a Basic and Advanced version, [Basic just giving a general isk value](https://i.imgur.com/Nm2vY98.png), and [Advanced giving a rundown of individual characters and systems.](https://i.imgur.com/jvEHupm.png)
---
lots of people in "Rookie Help" chat channel will try and help you if you ask. many helpers have seen people having problems with tutorial missions and so may know exactly what step you are missing.
---
Sure bud, keep reaching.
---
Because the average goon has 643 accounts now, so if you can get the 2012 numbers bacK + the 11 folks that are still playing were hit the mark
---
It was your videos and handbook that brought me back into EVE after an 8 year hiatus from 2008. I started with WH bomber shenanigans and since then have expanded into so much more of this game that I never dared/cared for before. I've loved every minute of it.  
---
Thank you for re-igniting the passion for spaceships and silliness in me
---
'Entertain me, or die' - eve players
---
This a very interesting point.
---
Yeah, Init lives there now
---
We run stukas from it
---
Those ingrates dont even know it but you literally got them out of gaming and gambling addiction!!!
---
What i find interesting, is the in game activated war between NC. and goonswarm to my knowledge adds structures lost into the the equation.
---
it shows although total isk loss is high, goonswarm have still lost more than killed against NC. (war has being going like 3 months now meaning no transfers possible.
---
The war between PH and Goonswarm is much higher total isk, but when i last looked both sides had destroyed about 850billion isk from each side.
---
meaning the loss goons have had would seem to be somewhat similar to the loss the much smaller Panfam has lost.
---
and before goonies say 'but we earn this much blah blah' no, the linememebers earn that but that doesnt mean the alliance earns that. and saying 'we earn more so its ok' is just like saying, 'we didnt want that region anyway' lol
---
Props to the OP for this, its high quality to read, unlike most of my posts, i just cant be bothered with well structured wrighting on an internet chat place.
---
But with all due respect to date goons havent done much but lie, make stuff u, propaganda reasons im sure, and stating 'e checked before' and the rigs lost, unless its common knowledge outside of goonswarm i personally reject that information.
---
goons are making headway, slowly compared to first thought lol. but theyre making headway. nothing can take that part away from the fact no other entity could have given goons this much shit in this situation.
---
90% of your post is saying how silly my idea is without saying why it is silly, and then the only statement you make contradicts itself: “traders will increase margins because of lost margins”
---
Large Alliances *need* fucked.
---
If you don't follow the logic - and you don't because you presumably don't live in Delve and don't spend time on Theta coms, you don't know what you're talking about.  Sometimes Titans were lost - I remember two being lost in Fountain relatively recently - in peacetime.  Sometimes supers were lost, usually somebody not on coms or out of range.  Sometimes Rorquals were lost, sometimes carriers were lost.  Yes, there's a background level of losses in Goons in peacetime that's just people making mistakes or doing dumb things.   That background level is significant, mostly because there are so many Goons.
---
You can't dispute this.  My idea that you need to subtract this background level from both sides in order to get true war losses is absolutely legit.  If you don't believe it, explain why it's not.
---
All correct, nothing that wasn't said already many times before.
---
I had posts in some now disabled national forums about the implications of "Lifeblood" on conflict driving, income generation for smaller independants and the price developement to expect in T2 already right on patchnote release. As Miners are cherrypickers by definition it was clear from the start that there would be a massive lack of all the Low Minerals that were mostly mined as collateral on Staging/Content/Reaction-Towers. 
---
I can still spice up my food today with the salt collected back then with these posts.
---
good they deserved it welcome back
---
My proposal was 0.1% not 1% but even then your point is still valid.
---
amazing work bro
---
I will take that into account for sure! Thank you very much!
---
I'll check it out! Great tips!
---
She's certainly trying to do something different, and it's a hell of a video.
---
&gt; diplo dodge
---
I like how this sounds.
---
when entering a ship name, would be nice to see the resist profile being re-ordered decending from highest resist to lowest for a quick glance at weakeness
---
..And then everyone clapped? This is one of the strangest nerd fantasies I've read, but I certainly doesn't read as truth
---
Excuse me, this does not follow the narrative. Can you please add an extra 1 trillion on the Killed amount for panfam? 
---
Thanks
---
2/3 of the medium structures unanchored now belong to The Thieves Guild
---
Not sure how that's moving the goalposts, that's literally been the line from PanFam leadership since Day 1.
---
not just inflated. you should actually look at the EXTREAMLY high value he gave to these citadels lol
---
maybe if he goes through every goon loss and treats them exactly the same wed be getting somewhere lol
---
When are they going to start doing damage?
---
CFC is ded.

---
If everything you say will happen, I'll either quit or play the wormhole game. Some players actually happen to enjoy the game in his current state. You should push CCP to resolve tidi fights..
---
Here you want more explosions. Problem is you only see them from your perspective: Hunter/ wormhole player.
---
I am at first an Indy guy, I like gathering resources, building them... But if you make nullsec too dangerous again, where will we go? Highsec ? Epic lmao right? Nah, if I'll just can't undock either orcas or rorquals I'll just quit.
---
I like pvp. My kb is green, I hunt in stratios, or cheap caracals. Sometimes participate with bb or goku. 
---
BUT I want to have my home clean. 100% can't exist, but I feel like cloacky campers are a mechanic stupid enough to make me not log in during weeks, so I can't imagine more wh people coming in, and with new abilities like counter your own capital force. 
---
You guys from wh are rich enough. You can get in blingy Loki's, at least 1b, while lot of players can't even fly it, not afford it.
---
Most of wh people are veteran. But there are new people.
---
Stop this elitism bullshit. There is room for everyone. It's a sandbox. If you think things don't explode enough, please make specific part of space for this.
---
We should have peaceful gameplay options as well.
---
the idiots deployed in tribute deserve all the shit we all think about you for loosing so heavily in trying to get victory lol..
---
there is too many of you for someone to win, but this loss you guys are having when outnumbering so fucking hard is embarrassing to watch goons do to themselves
---
Bashing structures is like mining, except the asteroidi doesnt cry on reddit afterwards
---
it's a subjective truth more accurately. you can blurf all you want about how what you're killing is important but what we're killing isn't, but realistically that's your system of value, and ours dictates the opposite. if the structures you're killing were that important to us, don't you think we'd defend them?
---
WH-, my dude.
---
Not a single screen cap or mention of the game for no other reason than his imagination is seemingly boundless
---
I give it about 50/50 odds that the guy who wrote it is a dedicated EVE player.
---
I think breaks have been mentioned but this was actually some good reading 😊 The Ox Troll, haha
---
"haha the longer they keep our space unlivable, the more of their retarded cousins we get to slap!"
---
Interesting. I haven't coded with punchcards before. I must be young.
---
and 2? 3? huge fleets in exchange for a handful of dreads.
---
and titans and rorquals,
---
&gt;the linememebers earn that but that doesnt mean the alliance earns that.
---
What are taxes?
---
less than the total earnt dumbass :D
---
&gt;but the defender HAD to fight if they wanted to keep their moon and their income.  
---
But this is still true.  *And* they have to fight to defend their ships when extracting that wealth too.  
---
What you're actually complaining about is that you can't Push Butan Get Bacon moongoo any more, you actually have to take risks like everyone else.  Just say that you think low-effort wealth fountains are what you want so the discussion can move on.
---
I mean that's only 1 constellation watch this space buddy that number is going to sky rocket when keepstar start exploding.
---
**lets start adding in the amount goons ARNT making anymore now their at war to the sheets.**
---
**how much less are goons making because theyre deployed. meaning panfams strategy of prolonging the war adds more and more to the loss of goons.**
---
**then lets look at these fucking numbers xD**
---
I don't know about the rest of you but this makes me want to go on a road trip to whatever games he plays.
---
Even delve doesnt produce titans as fast as this smoothbrain
---
More than your alliance makes in a year and we don't even notice.
---
Imagine bragging about killing POCOs and jammers.
---
I can't.
---
Going back years, if you read up on what prior CSMs have said, all these ideas that CSM candidates have don't really matter, as the point of the CSM is for CCP to bounce their ideas off you, and not the other way around.  
---
In particular, if you read Jester's AMA from not long ago, you'll see that many people inside CCP aren't all that interested in hearing what you'll have to say, unless its on their terms, or their own idea.  
---
How will you handle it if CCP shows no interest in any of these ideas?
---
regarding your point about structures belonging to renter corps that drop alliance:
---
an effort is generally made to let renters know that they can sell unwanted structures on consignment via the rental exec corp, but not all of them follow through, particularly when they stop being renters for whatever reason
---
generally when we find structures belonging to ex-renter corps that have not been unanchored or transferred to the exec corp for sale we bash them, as renters have a tendency to do dumb shit like freeport them or sell them to our enemies, but we can only do that when we know they exist, and we don't scout our own space for derelict ex-renter structures all that often, probably understandably 
---
to claim that renter corps drop alliance to save the killboard from structure losses is just utter retarded nonsense
---
to point away from yourself in direction goons won´t make us to forget that NCPL is the real target, cause they started it all! ... so pls stop!
---
Big if true
---
&gt;If the line members are krabbing a fuckton of isk in bounties, it doesn't mean the alliance the is making a fuckton in taxes
---
...ok?
---
why bad?  didn´t PL had most low sec moon goo .... while they where able to move their Supers all over the map ....
---
He was talking about the black ops module to prevent cynos.

Can you please order the resists EM Themal Kinetic Explosive, not alphabetically, here?

---
Damn it why did it have to be an onion post :(
---
«My logic is undisputable and you cant deny it» Holy fuck youre full of yourself. Take a fucking look at zkill and notice how long ago it is since a titan died in delve. The safety of delve has exponentianally increased over the last year, and the losses have undoubtedly increased ever since papa goon left. Youre literally arguing against the people who get these kills.
---
Oh man we should've just sent a couple of people up there to grind them all down since they're of no value and not worth defending.
---
Honestly it's like fighting krabs. When they dock up, you just make them pay for it by camping or destroying other shit.
---
(I see map line just fine)[http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Tribute]
---
Oh look, these lines are visible if you squint really hard. I guess CCP decided that these were more important FOR me.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/O0pNcm6.png](https://i.imgur.com/O0pNcm6.png)
---
Well, I guess if those qualities means their dead, they've been that way for most of Eve's lifetime.  
---
Their goal is to secure Providence, the connecting systems in Catch, and patrol the adjacent lowsec regions. They don't go start wars elsewhere, and while they can and do roam outside Provi, there's longstanding rules about not fucking with other people's sov/structures elswhere.  
---
Now, they are a shadow of what they once were numbers wise, but the way they play the game hasn't really changed much.  
---
People like to shit on them for not even attempting to grow outside of the bounds they set for themselves more than a decade ago, but I think it's cool to have different types of entities holding space in what's supposed to be a sandbox game. There's already too much conformity as it is, so hopefully CVA never goes "dead".  
---
(Though, they could stand to cull some of the long term assholes that chase a lot of people away...)
---
don't be dense
---
the fact that you have 1300 titans deployed significantly increases the cost of defending them, in terms of materiel and effort, to a level that is worth more than the structures are to us. happy now?
---
i wonder what that could be :p
---
Have you opened up the mission in your journal? It might be marked as completed.
---
Tldr
---
It’s at the bottom
---
Better than bashing structures and mining.
---
Very wholesome. Good for bedtime story.
---
Just bought it, why have I missed this, love your videos
---
&gt;The eveappraisal links in the notes column are just to convey the information of what the fit actually was, before they ripped out the rigs.
---
i.e. the rigs were removed in an effort to save face. When it died it didn't match the scan from GSF Recon according to the OP
---
They weren’t your real friends anyway, welcome back.
---
but, hes upped the price like crazy on zkills with 3 rigs on them...
---
you saying he stripped the riggs, then they refit 3 rigs lol sure thing
---
good stuff packed and moved out. Both sides can easily afford to replace the structures and krabs, just that Panfam is having more fun while you're bashing structures.
---
A true beanliever here.
---
Right mate cuz 30k+ people sure are all the same
---
^^^ok retard
---
Just so you know, htp is in no way whatsoever anti npsi. It's our roots and we full endorse it.  Literally HTP was created to plant SBUs in y-mp for spectre fleet.
---
To be entirely clear, we aren't hostile to nrds either which I think is also a perfectly valid way to play eve. We are though the natural enemy of cva because of the uncomplicated reason of "we choose to be".  Hope that clarifies something.
---
Ah okay. You said they're an easy punching bag, Goon krabs are easy targets too, same to most of their ''PvP'' pilots. Mass is what makes them win, what's elite about that?
---
Thankfully I get to do both. While not to the extent of the krabs in delve, y'alls krabs in TKE and B0T lands are eating shit too.
---
They might not all have died, but sure, weakened enough that we can't rely on them. Anyways, going from "hey, there is a technologically superior power that might help us!" to "hey there is a technologically superior power that wants to kill us!" is a good change.
---
Someone asked Hilmar at EDU about EVE's roadmap. 
---
Basically CCP has over-promised and under-delivered so consistently, they decided it was better to stop sharing future plans with us
---
op, would you mind including the amount of isk goonswarm have not made because theyre players are deployed into your comparisons?
---
as isk not earnt on a goon level is loss. :D
---
Can't deny that instead of thanking Goons for providing the opportunities for content on both sides of the Universe now this does still sound a bit salty :P
---
if you can use t2 light drones a combat probing heron can be pretty fun, not that faction drones won't also work. I used a combat probe rail+drone heron in wh for a while and got some fun kills.
---
Been playing for over 2 years and it was the best corp I ever been in. Just as null isn't for everybody, nor are wormholes.
---
Or just use the old map. I only use the old map because it flattens everything to a 2D plane. So much easier to use.
---
Oh no, not the Pocos!
---
Fair enough. Thank you for your response.
---
Shit, at least the goon motto used to start with "not here to ruin *the* game"...
---
Wow thanks.. Was waiting soo long for someone taking 50% of my rewards.. I finally wont have to much isk \o/
---
Sorry man I’m super late to the party and can’t see if anyone has asked, how do you feel about delayed local when someone enters system?
---
&gt; On top of that two other WH corps kept an alt logged out in our hole and would scan them in daily. Don't have the people to fight the numbers/ships they bring
---
They might be nice people but that doesn't sound like a good wh corp. 
---
If you've been playing for 2 years, and the best corp you were ever in was camped like that, try better corps. Idk what to say tbh.
---
Why not go all the way and also add all the isk the north hasn't made by not keeping up with the meta?
---
because that isnt somthing caused by goons to NC. 
---
lol your answers are dreadful xD
---
&gt;1300 titans
---
Is it 600, 900, 1300 or 1400?
---
Nobody seems to know.
---
&gt;because that isnt somthing caused by goons to NC. 
---
Just like the isk lost by not krabbing is caused by goons doing a fullscale deployment and not because of nc?
---
but it IS a cost to the war itself.
---
whereas NC. following a meta or not has nothing to do with goons. are you serious on these statements? like wow
---
No I'm just going full retard following your tracks.
---
I mean surely NC not following meta is because it would allow goons to shit on their killboard, so it's definitely a cost caused by goons.
---
Bubbles and log off traps, though log off traps are fucked at the moment due to the huge delay / black screen when entering the game.
---
undock to find out (:
---
what prevent you from canceling and resubbing order at 0.01 isk ?
---
They joined horde specifically to blue tank a PL Corp and continue to camp a bait beacon, that PL took over, in Gem. Although BloodofGods has apparently done some fun little fleets that the hordlings enjoyed, I’m really glad it worked out for everyone in the end.
---
Isn’t coming here and enlisting reddit to harass his channel the same as if not worse than what he’s been apparently doing to you ? 
---
Just local mute the Corp and fly your ship, you’ll have a better time.
---
You have to consider plex prices rise due to skill farms too, nullsec isn't solely responsible here. More and more people are turning to skill farming as a form of income, it's far to safe and far to easy not to, all of this characters have to be plexed, creating further demand for plex, leading to higher prices. I know ccp would never get rid of skill injectors, but I would like to see some sort of nurf to them to reduce demand. Something like unable to be used on capital skills and specialisation skills, also potentially turning them in to booster so you get +45 to your training per minute attribute especially doubling your training speed. That way you will never need more than one injector per character at a time. There is also another problem with injectors that is far from harmful to eve than rising plex prices. If you have a skill farm character on a account that account is practically payed for and you never have to worry about plexing it/paying for it, filling another slot on that account with, let's say a fax pilot, that fax alt is aways plexed and ready to go!  You can apply this method over and over again potentially having an infinite number of fax/capital pilots, further leading to capital proliferation problem.
---
I love the taste of freshly extracted salt in the morning, it tastes like victory.
---
Far more limited and useless market I would say.
---
The current market system is absolutely fine, people should have a chance to fuck up for market PVP to be fun.
---
long story cut short here.
---
your saying the costs of deploying an army doesnt count? and that all should bow to the 100% efficianey goons are having in this war, and the entirety of PanFam have not undocked, all they have done is watch structures die, nothing else.
---
gotcha. your masterful ways have taught me the goon way of thinking. praise  the Wisconsin master
---
In a mineral market, even a couple of cents might mean a difference between black and red.
---
Not sure what they could do when some of the biggest WH corps in the game constantly bring 3x as many guys into the hole daily. Was a month or two ago anyway, no idea how things are going now
---
&gt; Holy fuck youre full of yourself
---
Here's the problem: (1) you can't do punctuation, (2) you haven't run the stats so you don't know what the numbers are (3) you're arguing with me without disputing the fact that there's a background level of dying in Delve that you need to subtract to get correct "cost of war" estimates, (4) Go fuck yourself you complete fucking idiot.
---
Use the old map like any sane individual.
---
That is some fantastic reading comprehension right there.
---
Less words more graphs please.
---
&gt;daily
---
Busiest wh I've ever heard of
---
I'd love to find a wh the biggest corps connect to daily and killing them
---
Which corp was it and who camped it?
---
i mean, i couldnt even guess how many billions a day goons arnt making now. if were getting into the small bits.
---
i realise goons havent exactly shown on grid success. so theyre reaching for anything they can get, but theres plenty more loos goons are having we can move onto if you wish
---
So it's true.... content really does die down in the summer months.
---
Nice wholesome post btw.
---
This sort of post sends a chill up my spine and makes me want to sub despite being offline the better part of a decade.
---
Awesome read... glad to see some bullshit p2w game destroyed in true EVE fashion. Good job mate!
---
They don't connect to it daily, I said they have alts logged off in the hole. We had a HS connection so he would just scan them in
---
TBH for sure if you had chance to defend them you would.          
---
Ok so how i see it :            
---
* Goons are objective driven. They have goal in burning your space and setting NCPL back at least a year and stopping development for at least one more year if they succeed. They have huge wallets and will gladly trade with enemy 2:1 as they have both full wallets, infrastructure and means to replace all this stuff instantly. ^(aka i seen a stack of 20 titan hulls on some screenshoot form some line member)                  
---
At the beginning of campaign they stated - no defensive fleet in 'jew land' will be active during the deployment. If 'jew' you will die. Deploy!                      
---
* NCPL is "zkill driven" and the "top dog" mentality.        
---
NCPL people are elite are have to be elite.           
---
Aka dropping corp when dying in a titan or pulling rigs worth tens of billions from structures that will die or putting so much focus on getting easy kills in Delve.               
---
In theory both groups are currently achieving the objective.             
---
NCPL is "winning" ISK battle with easy kills of ratters in Delve and pulling expensive rigs or structure transfers.             
---
Goons is winning objective battle by removing infrastructure.         
---
So in theory both groups can say they are happy **but the unpopular truth** is that NCPL is still sitting in the old meta. Meta where actually zkill stats mattered as you could not so easily replace your stuff.           
---
**In current meta if you have infrastructure and people willing to mine/rat you can recoup all loses during a war in less than a month ... but if you don't have infrastructure building one will take months before you will start to recoup loses.**                   
---
From my perspective goons are those who actually are winning this conflict.            
---
They are gladly willing to trade 2:1 while burning your space ... yet this "exchange rate" is much lower **even** including the fact that most of the loses from goon side are "not strategic assets" aka jew ships in Delve.
---
Ph use a some fun ones, windrunners is all the rage right now. Its lots of intercepters that warp in and out constantly then grab and one not paying attention. 80 maladictions vs 1 non-aligned egale 🥰 
---
Nanogang is fun when a FC runs it, so is Tristan and talwars will always be a line member favourite. 
---
All of these are cheap and great to teach you how to FC, if you want to get out there a create your self some content.
---
use the old map, the new map is bullshit, the old maps better but not by much.
---
So you're saying traders would lose money because mechanics would force them to? Majority of traders willquit if trading on a lot of things stops to be profitable, which would lead to a more monopolistic market or even a full-scale oligopoly on all trading and higher prices on everything. 
---
I really don't get the beef on 0.01 isk as you still have to pay broker's fees if the price increases. I don't see what's stopping you from making a significantly higher, or lower order right now. If it gets 0.01 isked, then it's not good enough.
---
Well to be honest, on regular battle reports we list single ships and fighter squads.
---
You didn't answer either question tbf. I can't imagine any pvp corps worth my left nut doing that
---
Dual prop fits are all about versatility, not about adding up the effects of both mods (if you want that go with an oversized AB and good luck turning), you use the AB to control range in scram range and either mitigate or negate the enemy dps, and mwd to catch kiters or gtfo is the situation takes a turn the wrong way.
---
My favourite dual prop fitted ships are the Cynabal, and the Jaguar, and the Firetail is also a ship you often see dual propped.
---
I don't need you to believe me. Was a month or two a go and I've moved on
---
more like 300 km range on the ravens, but otherwise correct.
---
Doesn't mean I'm not curious about these corps regardless 
---
Some of the biggest in wspace wasting time reverse scanning a lowclass with a hisec static baffles me, and I'd love to know which band of retards did that
---
smdh entire war was a ruse to get aryth a few more trillion from his PI stash
---
CVA has lost even number fights for a decade and counting don't try to act like its all about numbers, they even manage to lose when they have the numbers. I've been around the game since 2009 lots of thing change. But CVA never changes.
---
The biggest issue I have with mogul is that I can’t follow the cost price of items bought on market.
---
On an item with cyclic or fluid price history I would love to see the averaged cost price over periods.
---
Sotiyo rigs are like 50-60b each btw.
---
That’s weird, I thought your FC’s and leadership want passive moon mining back in some form, to have something other than rorq hunting to fight over ?
---
I honestly didn’t realise init had swallowed the mantra that moon mining used to be a lazy affair to enrich the few and brought nothing else to the game.
---
i was in a corp with that dufus. i think he is mentally ill. he RMTs all his losses (bragged about it on coms) and is a petty, vengeful character. i reported him to CCP but nothing happened since, maybe he also lied about RMT'ing.
---
try to ignore and stay clear of him
---
So... lowsec?
---
he is a notorious hot dropper with 0 skill. i flew with him
---
Good job there mate ! We do know summer is content death but yeah ! Even the capsuleers have to see the sun right ! :p
---
i flew with him. he is a brainless, trigger happy RMTing cap pilot.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76986150/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76986150/) 
---
what about this one. valued on his list as 28-29bill?
---
these rigs were not removed. and like ive said a few times now, if we are going to count with a fine tooth comb true losses, i would love to see stats on how much less delve and goonswarm area have made because goons deployed. that im sure would surpass any of these isk values.
---
I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE BECAUSE I LIKE IT AND MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT
---
FACTS?! ON THIS SUB?!
---
We only accept spin here! Be gone with you!
---
flew with him. this sounds reasonable. that guy is an asshole and idiot
---
Agree with almost all of your ideas, really liking the sound of it all. A couple of questions about this I've seen posted on reddit:
---
1) what do you think of the idea of all low sec fw systems being cyno jammed by the empires? Would it result in more small scale conflict, in combination with your own low sec docking suggestion?
---
2) what do you think of the suggestion that the combat interceptors (non bubble immune ones) are d scan immune instead, like some recon cruisers?
---
3) there was some talk in the last csm notes about removing bubble immunity from the remaining interceptors that have it (far future plans and speculation) and placing it on shuttles, what do you think of this?
---
4) what area of eve do you think is currently the most healthy? I would say wormholes but I'm interested in what you think
---
5) somewhat meta in that it's not about the game itself, but how do you think your ideas and opinions will mesh with other csm members and do you think you will be able to effectively but diplomatically voice your concerns or have your mind changed on why your ideas might not work?
---
You must really need that money if you couldn't wait to get home from work to take a proper picture of the actuall model you are selling... you should edit this post when you get one, noone will buy shit without seeing how it actually looks.
---
....wat
---
he was also bragging about RMTing his losses and being rich from bitcoin farms in poland. that guy is delusional
---
Snuck Fuff
---
Like I said about POSes persistence generally beats strength. If we get timezone tanking fixed on citadels (a bigger but seperate isuse), that'd apply even more so to athanors that POSes.
---
&gt;MJD battleships and how it was killing content
---
They complain about it, but look up any video of serious krabbing. They're using multiple dreads one cycling sites with another killing the drifter. 
---
Also it doesn't kill content if you're ready. I'd wager that most of the people salty are sitting there trying to either form a fleet or get them down chain and don't get there in time. So it's not the MJD, it's the slow get up and go from the fleet. 
---
&gt;I wouldn't say making the drifter drop more blue loot would be unfair.
---
Why? The drifter already makes up over half of the isk you make in C5 sites. C5 sites are literally just vehicles to bring you drifters to kill.
---
And ere's some guy clearing a stronghold in 30 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnbZQL_iiyg , which is pretty slow. I'm happy to have more free isk, but I'd rather my isk be worth more than have more of it. 
---
&gt;Particularly discouraging people from doing it in non-capitals and in non-home-holes
---
That's nowhere even close to the reason. People don't kill it in battleships because it's fucking obnoxious and a waste of 2 or 3 peoples time when you can just have 1 dude in a dread and a frig blap it. And what makes you think people are discouraged from doing it in non-home holes? Almost all sites in home systems are sucked up pretty quick, and C5 cash is over 50% the drifter, so you're encouraged to kill the thing.
---
Also, most wormholers i know who rat in BSs do it because they don't have the skills, characters, or initial capital to do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujQNeLPd8) disgusting shit. Krab holes are way more efficient than dread ratting out of your static anyway. You "can't" fit 3 dreads through a c5-c5, but you sure as shit can stick them in a farm hole the same region as the rest of your corp's farm holes and rake in cash using 4 dreads.
---
This is the most crazy Savage shit I've ever heard of. This got me excited. You sir are a fucking boss.
---
We all know that the north is not above dropping corp/alliance to save killboard stats. Your cringy reply shows how much you care about your "reddit killboard". It makes your niche example of why those corps would have dropped alliance less credible.
---
just to get rid of the sigs so they can go back to spod braining without fear of a wormhole right?
---
You mean goon ? Oh wait ..
---
It's reddit.  The typical user has the IQ of a small turnip.
---
er, what?
---
it was in no way ruined watch the stream it went amazingly and most people had wonderful fun, it was never about the plex.
---
Paola loved big fleets.
---
Multiboxing is the real reason i do not want to be in a nullblock anymore. It is their endgame do multibox 10 rorqs while simultaneously watch 10 systems with cloaked cmpers, while flying at least 2 ships in a fleet, while keeping a titan pilot ready to undock and drop on someone, while...... 
---
This sounds too much like a work, honestly. And after trying it with 2 acc, it just was not for me, i'll rather go by my own pace and maybe join a WH corp later on. :)
---
nullsec now is too safe and everyone ratting for injectors also ccp do nothing last 2.5 years after citadel expansion
---
Just throwing an idea: solo blops used to mainly focus on hunting DED runners. Pushing more of available income (relatively) from anomalies to DEDs would increase amount of DED runners, which means more targets for blops. And since inside DED you can't light a cyno or get a capital in, it still leaves some viability for blops BS and a target type to hit.
---
It's better by worlds, dont underplay it, the old map is likeabsolutley fantastic compared to the new, fuck the new map...
---
Great job, thanks por sharing
---
Jita local is that way ---&gt;
---
That some sexy formatting
---
&gt; formatting is kinda meh but still well written.
---
Yeah I just noticed that. I'd been piecing it together in another editor most of the day as thoughts came to me, gave it some proof reading then just copy pasted it and hit publish. Looks like the paragraph breaks didn't copy properly for some reason.
---
&gt;I've managed about 12 people in probably 4 or 5 hours of doing this.
---
These are good numbers.
---
My experience is mainly for a wormhole corp so we were a bit more stringent in our recruiting. 
---
But our baseline was probably about 1/5 people we talked too would join the corp and we'd only expect 1/10 of those to stay with us longer than a month.
---
After a year we went from 3 members to 50 active members that were on everyday and everyone was pretty good friends, to the point we played other games together and even 4 years after the corp folded due to the leadership (myself included) quitting theres still 3 groups that im aware of that are still friends from it. 
---
Finding corpmates is easy, finding good corpmates is hard and will take time.
---
Maybe it's something for r/HFY
---
Show us a screenshot of your UI settings. Have set transparency super high or something?
---
This is not going to happen in current state of the game.
---
The old map is better is so many ways it's not even funny. The new map, as with most "updates" these days, looks really cool but lacks in functionality and seems to be made by people who don't actually *play* the game.
---
The day they remove the old map and force me to use the new one, is the day I win EVE.
---
The upfront tax
---
Fuck, this has "Lineage II fifteen years ago" written all over it!
---
I mean, isn't that possible to do on every single classic MMORPG out there? Why didn't they just wasted your ass as you were running towards them? (seriously asking, never played Albion)
---
And while we are at it... what did you do to get blacklisted? Not some bullshit "I offended someone", please elaborate, because I'm somehow suspecting you deserved it.
---
You wont walk away with the sale. I will just 0.01 isk you and so will everyone else.
---
Give the value of Goons dying in Delve for the months pre-deployment.  It's not possible to calculate a broadly correct "cost of war" unless you do that and subtract the background dying from the current loss rate (in Delve), assuming the background rate remains broadly constant.
---
Goons decided to 'glass' Tribute. NC. / PL decided to let them grind down structures till they're bored. I think DeadCo sided with Goons and started taking sov in Tenal, while Goons are in Tribute. No big (super) fights though. Mostly structure grinding and some subcap fights.
---
Also remember oversized AB severely fucks up your ability to warp off
---
CCP does. new account + skill extractors/injectors
---
Yep, other games are full of players clueless of intel and obviously don't think a second they can loose anything.
---
Remind me of a stupid game where you basically had infinite resources upgrades (double the cost of your mine to get double the minerals, had to have 4 officers breaching the walls to capture the town, and could see incoming armies. So the typicall attack was full army followed by 4 officers, one by one
---
At some point I invaded a town part of a "Lets play together and be friends" small alliance, and started to get trashtalked (like it could hurt) and threatened of attacks, especially for a woman who acted like a protective mother.
---
As there was no defensive advantage (read : troop count is the only thing that matters), the only things that mattered were resources, plundering them or conquering upgraded  cities, but of course what they were looking for at the start was wining a few pitched battle, reclaim the town and call it a day.
---
I was outnumbered, but also bored of the game, so I unleashed hell. Send waves of fake attacks, planned troop and resource movements so that their armies will meet no resistance and no loot, but my army was back for their officers, or simply send armies to plunder/capture their town when their armies were  marching to attack some of mine. If someone asked for mercy, reveling their weakness, I rushed to deal the killing blow.
---
What was meant to be a quick punitive war turned out to be a bloody all out war.
---
I held one week IIRC, harvesting much tears in messages, before they allied with some more people and started to coordinate
---
If you have good frigate skills, run solo abbys frigates (you can do up to lvl3 solo with decent skills and a bit of bling, but even t1 is worth running solo), level 4 FW missions,  hunting clone slodiers in ls, or level 4 burners, all of which pay similar or better than VNI ratting
---
This is a terrible scam and you are clearly stupid, please biomass and delete your reddit account.
---
"If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a Diplo"
---
EVE needs more small groups and this would help make them viable and generate content on the side, so I'm all for this.
---
Spreadsheets or it never happened.
---
Roads? Where we're going we don't need road's...
---
You kinda can't smug when you have like 60,000 toons 😑
---
Could be interesting to compare with CCP official number. Beacause Zkill don't have all kill.
---
If you search they, they are attach in MER file in devblog ;)
---
one day tranquility will go down and all of the psychopaths in this game will be free
---
You mean the Keepstars like M-O that are in a corp that isn't even within NCPL?
---
Not sure you can count them in the losses for Panfam buddy.
---
Meanwhile, the Evictions War still continue in the drones land and the north ;  
---
\- Dead Coalition have launched a invasion of Tenal and have begin to purge some Panfam structures over there. SkillU and Co seem to be fighting Dead Coalition there too.  
---
\- The Spire is still a contested warzone between Skeleton Crew/Damned Brotherhood/Xcom versus No Visual/Murderous Mindset and various other small entities which are continuing the fight against Panfam. Unspoken have recently begin to re-assisting them after dealing with the their evacuation of ER.  
---
\- After the massive intervention of Horde, JAG, Bow Dow and Unspoken have been evicted from Etherium Reach. Slyce and TRI, the new Panfam allies, have taken the majority of the sov there and are doing the dirty job of cleaning all of the structures and sov of the ex Etherium Breach coalition, with some occasional disruption from the ex Etherium Breach folks.
---
They are blowing YOUR shit up undefended or not. Morale kills in Delve don't mean much. Instead of chasing those fkn defend something willya
---
Lol you're dumb
---
I so look forward to it :) thank you so much.
---
&gt;Nanogang is fun when a FC runs it
---
That's how you get people anchored on said FC lol
---
Nice show of objectivity for a "neutral" media
---
Yup. That's how it all begun iirc. Goons from SA doing a goonrush in eve with cheap throwaway ships like rifters.
---
Those were the days.
---
Is that proof enough? :o
---
https://i.imgur.com/tJIjTT6.png old vs new map.. even ccp knows the new one is bad, thats why we can still use the old one 2-3 years later
---
Then you get baited and smartbombed and all die in a glorious ball of fire leaving 2b pods on killmails.
---
So true
---
And X-mas is kinda of a peak, yeah.
---
So plan your wars in the summer :p
---
I also tried to find 'big' battles, but I could not really find them in any tops, which to me is quite surprising but a good indication of the scale of destruction that happens everyday. These big battles are big in term of value destroyed and consecutive players logged, but they barely make a dent in the grand scheme of things (just judging the number of kills).
---
I thought about it but could not find an easy way to import the MER in an automated way and was lazy to copy paste numbers. 
---
But I will definitely check for one or two months if I can somehow match the numbers.
---
I tried to spin a narrative around 'grrrrr goons', but unfortunately I do not have details on the KM, so I had to fall back to a somewhat objective conclusion :(
---
It was entertaining so idc if it's real
---
did you find the medieval spoof of eve any good?
---
The only advantage the new map has is that it can be opened in a window, for everything else I believe it's worse across the board. 
---
I tried turning it on for the last few weeks just to force myself to get some experience with it, and the major issue i have is that some of the filters are just less useful. For filters like 'number of pilots docked in system' or 'number of pilots in space 30 minutes' there is almost no difference in the size or colour of the orbs. On the old map a difference of 50-100 pilots is enough to significantly change the size and colour of an orb but in the new map you can't tell the difference without hovering over it.
---
I also found it more difficult to find what system I was currently in using the new map. It has a floating icon to say what system but I found that this doesn't always line up with the system you're actually in, sometimes it can appear as though it is in a nearby system. The old map just had a line pointing to it which was easy to understand.
---
I feel bad for them really they clearly put a lot of effort to try and make the new map a thing for quite a while but ended up giving us something worse than we already had and were eventually forced to just shelf it behind that 'try the new map toggle'.
---
Welp, you have my vote
---
Or Dotlan.
---
He moved / is moving from iceland
---
Maybe 1-2 systems connected is a nice idea to try.. not sure about whole constellation. 
---
Though if you wouldn't be able to place POS or citadels there it can be fun. Or if there was a very regular (say once every 3-4 days) cataclysmic event that wiped everyone on the map that isn't shielded\\tethered or docked and reinforced every structure instantly with a random timer in the next 1-2 days, that would be a nice alternative to just a boring ban. You can exploit more, but you will be much more vulnerable. 
---
Maybe we can also have new resources there too, or shattered planets that are much easier to mine or have a random assortment of PI materials\\moon mats harvestable?
---
Even a spodbrain having an iq of a rock that they mine wont find structure bashes more enjoyable.
---
he is buying a contract that lists a ship and rigs.  He doesn't want the rigs.  The price of the contract is fine if he can sell the rigs.  But if he has to trash them, then it isn't a good deal.  He is asking how do you tell if they are fit or not.
---
I see you crying all the time.
---
You could make a religion out of this.
---
Great to see you run Olmeca! You'll get my vote.
---
Jita is that way ——-&gt;
---
Impressive deflection attempt. But facts don't care about your feelings, as they like to say these days.
---
He does. He wants it fitted and rigged. Read the op.
---
Scanning the structures before attacking the region was a really smart move!! 
---
 
---
May I ask, how much value is in the remaining structures that are yet to be destroyed?
---
https://imgur.com/a/qvWGHpG
---
From my corpmates. :D :D
---
You say that yet one can be expelled from goons for specific and targeted harrassment so...
---
you can get the real numbers, the ids are incremental, so if you have the last ID for the day and the first ID you can calculate the total number per day.
---
No, we lost two. They outmaneuvered us and we were too slow to react to the threat to the second one.
---
I may be wrong but I don't think Dotlan shows number of pilots in last 30 minutes.
---
Yep. Helped them do it the first time.
---
Did you call 15b+ on a field which anyone can roll into at any time 'disgusting shit'?
---
Besides that there is no convincing evidence that the region affects site spawns. 
---
Dread ratting is high investment, high risk, high reward. 
---
Also, MJDs (or more specifically lack of site scrams) are a huge problem for ganking high class ratters. One site pays off your average site Nestor so if you get jumped you can MJD most of your battleships off field because initial tackle sabres can only hold so much, ignoring the fact that you could likely MJD everything out if you're watching Dscan. Very easy to cover that investment.
---
Well tell your alliance that.
---
This is not the greatest region in the galaxy.
---
So let’s talk about missions. They should add agents as a item that a Corp can install in a pos.
---
The thing is, those moons were so good and attractive that everyone wanted one so they were content drivers and FCs didn't have to bash 3 reinforce timer citadels no one cares about. You reinforce the pos and the next day you have a nice fight over it
---
&gt; of deploying to Aridia 
---
Which is on Goons' doorstep though..
---
He is moving to Spain shortly iirc. 
---
So free trips home.
---
Yep your right we should never change your null..... how long till you quit again?
---
Disagree
---
New player also, this tutorial bugged for me in the same spot. I skipped the true "tutorial" missions and went straight to the career paths/reps, no ragrets things are pretty easy to figure out little by little
---
"Example: I want to buy a fitted and rigged carrier. Someone contract that to me. How do i really know that the rigs in contract are plugged to the ship or are just inside the ship, same for the equipments?"
---
he is buying a contract that has a ship with rigs.  IT MATTERS if he doesn't want the rigs but would rather have another set of rigs.
---
Hey everyone - this guy is an example of someone who is completely clueless when it comes to knowledge of salvage, how much of it is collected and makes it to the market, how expensive it is, and how citadel rigs are produced....oh and how zkillboard values items.
---
Don’t be like this guy, or at least, don’t be dumb enough to say the things he said out loud because it just makes you look incredibly stupid in public.
---
Godzilla-sized egos power-tripping and executing whole scale betrayal and slaughter, all alarming as hell.
---
Welcome home, you wonderful person.
---
The map is an atrocity.
---
Yea, I've seen some folks get knocked down the food chain this week.
---
I deployed 2 Rorquals to mine the ice in Tribute - can't let it all go to waste.  Sposbless the efforts of Gsol!  
---
 Thanks Tuzy and all the others who make that possible. Scarred NC is running away in warp speed from anything that can fit a cyno and carry 350 Liquid Ozone.
---
It's literally where panfam announced they would create a supertit umbrella for safe rorq mining less than 2 months ago.
---
Not understanding how expensive upwell jammers are to produce and then gleefully gloating about your ignorance on reddit.
---
I can’t.
---
i posted this expecting an intellegent answer from the OP.
---
i praised the OP for his content. saying what nice quality to read it was. but because my view on goon statements is they lie and make everything propaganda. i cant trust 'we scanned it before and it had this on'
---
look at the complete rejection my comment had purely because i do not suckle on the teet of his motherland.
---
So he wants it rigged,as the first sentence says
---
YES, BUT IT MATTERS IF HE DOESN'T WANT THE RIGS THAT ARE ON THE ONE THAT IS BEING OFFERED TO HIM.
---
One of the corps dropped alliance 2 hours before a number of their expensive industrial structures all hit final timer and were destroyed. 
---
But sure it’s all just normal “rental corp management”. Nothing to see here.
---
There hasn't been a roadmap for years, just rumours.
---
That's not what he wants. How is that not clear to you?
---
[–]IamSoGreedy[S] -4 points 20 hours ago 
---
Yes, it does matter.
---
oh, so even though he directly disagrees with you, you know what he wants?
---
I'm gonna be "that" guy. 
---
Loosing is not the word.
---
Losing is.
---
Why does everyone always fuck that up?
---
God damn stories like this are amazing, anyone know any more? Of an eve player just ruining some poor babies' games?
---
I remember the first time someone explained it to me, it was so annoying to even think about. Just really needed a way to simplify it!
---
But that might reflect poorly on their Lord and saviour: zkill
---
He fucking says he wants it rigged. You even quoted it.
---
Omg haha.
---
&gt;He's a dick for forcing his style of gameplay on people who didn't want it.  
---
&gt;PvP server  
---
&gt;people ON that server clearly had zero interest in playing his way,
---
Is this EVE?
---
Go into newbie channels, answer their questions. Don't be afraid to reach out. You begin to teach the next generation how to EVE. They will come to you as quick as their ibis's can carry em.
---
Set up the content the rest of us F1 monkeys will show eventually
---
An unironic “*structures were undefended, they don’t matter*” but “*u lost an undefended titan lol TOTALLY MATTERS*” - at least we can build a replacement, NCPL manufacturing capabilities are starting to dwindle a little bit.
---
What "Goons" have lost back home has 0 impact on the alliance.  Those are all personal assets of players who decided not to deploy or do not participate. It cost the alliance nothing. We do however get a good laugh
---
I Guess:
---
New rats with missiles is now available on Tranquility.
---
Minor Conduits will be available.
---
again, and i cannot make this any clearer.  
---
THIS IS WHEN THE QUESTION MATTERS. 
---
he wants to buy a rigged carrier.  some guy offers a rigged carrier with the WRONG rigs.  The OP is asking if he has to destroy those rigs (aka they are fitted) or if he can sell them (they are not fitted). 
---
Example below:
---
OP: WTB rigged HEL
---
Friend: WTS rigged HEL with T2 CDE. 
---
OP: oh i wanted hyperspatials.  but thats ok, i'll buy it and sell the T2 CDEs.
---
&gt;In the end though it's about 10- 12 titans (fitted) or so.
---
and yet NC. was dancing in the street over killing 2 titans in delve after the deployment started like they had won the war...
---
Which is irrelevant to what he asked
---
so you stopping us from krabbing counts but us stopping you from krabbing does not....
---
We are in maintance mode and you still havent figured it out.
---
According to your alliance leaders no you wouldn't because you can't.
---
I've been playing EVE for 15 years and a couple other MMORPG's on and off for another decade.
---
EVE does *not* have the same distribution of behavior types as any other multiplayer game, at least not in the same percentages.  
---
EVE really does cater to the, how should I say it, more devious type of gamer than other games by a large margin.  Griefing isn't only allowed, it's encouraged.  Scamming isn't only allowed, it's encouraged.  Stealing from and screwing over the organizations you belong to isn't only allowed it's heavily encouraged and promoted as the best part of the game whenever someone writes an article about EVE.
---
Sure, you have all types of people in EVE, but as for the more devious, manipulative and controlling people, I would say that percentage of player skews a lot higher here.
---
Now, am I saying that's a bad thing?  Nope.  I've done my fair share of lying, cheating, scamming, stealing and even broke up at least four smaller alliances and could have cleaned house on Rote Kapelle when I left cause I had access to *everything*, but didn't because I really liked a couple members... who ironically don't play anymore.  (Lesson learned, always clean house on the way out if you can).
---
I like our style of play, but I'm not gonna kid myself when I hop onto Age of Conan for a K6 run, it's a completely different distribution of gamer over there.  Most of them would be shocked at the things I've done in EVE and wouldn't let me near the guild bank that I have full access to.
---
So you want to buff your preferred play style to become overpowered, while at the same time nerfbat your enemies into the ground?  Does that have anything to do with the largest,most powerful organization this game have ever seen?  Rorqual miner here, thanks.
---
Pick a reading skill then. I said it doesn't have any point whatsoever to be in a NER report.
---
Obviously losing citadels has a cost.
---
Holy... Best fanfic ever!
---
yet another classic story from eve
---
SHIT WINTER ORB DUDE
---
where did i say that? mr nobody goon member 23856 who is joining in trying to beat down the voices of anything anti-goon related XD
---
of course it counts, both side, i mean, my point being is i reckon, goons are feeling a tiny bit more of an effect on the income than NC. maybe im wrong, some smart who de who should graph this shit is what im saying
---
Nice strawman, dude. I never said we should make *no* changes to null, I said that *this* change is immensely stupid.
---
Wrong
---
The system is amazing and its what originally drew me to the game. Knowing that a Coalition acts very much like a country in the alternate world people call "Earth" with its own military, politics and culture is amazing. 
---
Sadly its all wasted with the current state of Null in eve online. 
---
We had a major war about a year ago that saw nearly 90% of SOV-HOLDING null alliances pick and side and fight/support in one way or another, and it was a steam roll. Imagine if in WWI, Archduke Ferdinand is shot. Austria goes to war, and then 2 weeks later they ceased to exist. Nobody would remember the war. Nobody remembers the modern wars. Powerblocs are just to powerful. 
---
Everybody remembers The Casino War / World War Bee. It was a megacoalition taking on a Superpower and winning thru hard struggle and sacrifice. 
---
The Great Eve War. A underdog alliance and friends taking on the undefeated Band of Brothers + Friends coaliton (Yes, I know technically the underdogs lost that war, but it was still fantasic, and for awhile it looked like they would win)
---
The Fountain War. A soon-to-be Superpower taking on a still large power in eve + Friends, and the weaker power holding their ground for quite awhile.
---
All great wars that people remember for years and years. Nobody will remember the Summer War. Nothing special happened. UALX, X47 combined didn't even equal B-R5RB from years prior.=
---
Microsoft Patch Tuesday baby! 
---
Let's hope the SQL DB lost all entries of Stain
---
I'm sorry dear, we won't show up. I mean why would we, we're not near enough people to handle the biggest blob in the game.
---
Also yes it will be shown, because even if it's not defended, it's still one big objective you achieved to destroy. If the idea behind your thoughts is that we'll have to leave our space, feel free to think that, because it's probably true.
---
That actually lowers the cost of the rig as market value should be higher
---
🔥
---
Man I trained into blops right before winning eve
---
Based on new numbers released recently leadership is willing to trade 5:1
---
A retribution is an assault frigate?
---
I have on good authority that we actually snuck 150,000 titans Into KQK.
---
Wait, so you are mad because you can't seem to unanchor your structure that is being attacked?
---
Are you in NC. or something?
---
you guys seem to flip a coin every time you talk about how many titans we have deployed.
---
No OP is correct. There's zero contrast in the new map
---
What you call burning bridges and such is in an other light having fun trying to keep as many unblue as possible so you can fight them outnumbered which is an outdated idea in current eve cause of injectors and such. They destroyed the whole investment of time for longtime players.
---
The problem is goon leadership cant survive two months of low MER.
---
Anywhere else ?
---
You do understand we CAN'T defend it right ? It's not like KQK numbers where people are AFK are superior to a CTA formup of NC PL and PH... oh wait they are. Why would we show up then ?
---
Winning against your blob in subcap is an achievment because we're mostly playing 1:2 to 1:3 odds, but don't expect it in every timer and not even for supercapital warfare.
---
It's a simple fact.
---
At EDU CCP said roadmaps are gone.
---
They make promises that aren't always kept so CCP doesn't intend to do them anymore
---
If you need an explanation you kinda need to look broader than your own little group and to eve as a whole and which coalitions are left and there standings towards eachother
---
" “*structures were undefended, they don’t matter*” but “*u lost an undefended titan lol TOTALLY MATTERS*”  The best part is they can make this argument with a straight face and just assume all of eve will accept this pants on head stupidity because they said so.
---
1300 titans... that's an arbitrary number to choose. Not accurate, but definitely arbitrary.
---
Johnny deleted all his old videos so it really is no contest
---
To be honest, I think it actually is.
---
It could help the north growing by removing a part of the renter model, which would be a good thing in the current meta.
---
10Bil for over one year of effort and a tainted character, good job? But i guess you showed those assholes who apparently did nothing exept be slightly annoying!?
---
Fuck them, amirite?
---
World ark nuking structures pls
---
this so much.
---
If they're doing pve they're not in pvp
---
&gt;Not sure you can count them in the losses for Panfam buddy.
---
riiiiiiiiiiiiiight cause its not like they just transferred it days ago solely to dodge the killmail or anything....
---
If it does matter, it shouldn't.
---
I'm expecting player structures to die. Don't let me down
---
It's just a tribute.
---
You're a salty bastard aren't ya
---
sounds like "ha ha you were so busy smashing someone's house in you didn't get to make money..."
---
It's definitely not like this turn of events is the long, drawn out conclusion to something triggered years ago and they aren't doing it for any other reason than revenge against a server that LOLdogpiled. This isn't bragging, it's a detailed and archived accounting of justice being delivered.
---
I view your approach as 'what to do'.  If developers refuse to give us games that aren't broken, then break them further and don't let them farm gamers for cash with terrible content.  My hat is off to you.
---
We make isk to build titans to burn enemies. We're at step 3 right now but don't worry, we'll be back to step one soon enough.
---
Delete all standings
---
Can you please explain how?  I genuinely don't know
---
&gt;There needs to be innovative mechanics for people to adopt a game as a multiplayer activity.
---
As a long time FPS player from Quake 2 and Unreal Tournament 1999 a game does not have to innovate to be adopted. 
---
It simply needs to slightly better than the last. 
---
PUBG did not innovate, it just did what Dayz did but better. 
---
Apex did not innovate, it just combined what PUBG did with Champions.
---
COD did not innovate, it just did everything so incredibly well.
---
Innovative mechanics can help, but they also can dilute the FPS experience and just create a bit of a mess. 
---
Take for example Splitgate, new fps that has an innovative mechanic. 
---
But it will die when HALO MCC comes to PC because even the Older HALO games do everything so much better.
---
Counterstrike has not innovated in 19 years, its effectively the same game it was when it released in 2000. Yet it still has a massive playerbase because it does the core of FPS well.
---
The priority around FPS should be doing the basics very well and maybe throwing in some interesting game mechanics around it.
---
DM me your username on Mogul and I'll have a look to see where the issue is.

I think a big thing you're missing is that safety and simplicity and accessibility creates scaleability. A 7b investment into a rorqual makes you 130m an hour yes, but a 140b investment in rorquals makes me 2600m/h. I can invest as much as I like in those rattles and dreads, I'm not breaking 500m and 2000m an hour respectively, and those numbers are of course lowered a fair bit once you take losses into account.
---
they actually got one?
---
i saw a dscan with 1288, it's not that arbitrary
---
Haha its all ancient history. One of the things that 401K did was end the bittervet hate for BoB by forcing our oldies to hang out with Evolution and RKK.
---
The alliance was quite well organized. The three founding corps were RKK, Shiva, and Evolution, with the first alliance leader being Alan from Evol. He had to step down shortly after and I was nominated as alliance leader, with the three leaders of the Corps (Zedone for Shiva, Galavet for RKK, and Molle for Evol) as my direct advisers. I would run day to day, and major decisions I would take to them for input and advice.
---
We had a lot of fun being a small fish in a big pond living out of Venal; it was a nice break away from the sov game, and a lot of folks appreciated it. Eventually we became enough of a nuisance that Vee and DBRB brought CFC major to deal with us, and hellcamp v1.0 was conducted in Venal to lock us in.
---
Anyway eventually things escalated towards the fountain war and it became clear that we would have to pick a side in larger scale coalition warfare. I also had had my daughter by then and the time commitment of being an alliance leader began to get to me. We eventually called it a day and I split the sovereign fun amongst all the remaining corps (we had snatched a fair few moons by then so the alliance had become tidily wealthy).
---
And the rest is history :)
---
who's you guys
---
citation needed
---
&gt; (war has being going like 3 months now meaning no transfers possible.)
---
This doesn't prevent things like Pl transferring a keepstar in M-O to duck a killmail.
---
how surprising...not.
---
Can't really be arsed to mine moon rocks for 200m/hr when I make 200m/3 minutes in my C6 tbqh.
---
i really think you're putting too much stock into this narrative
---
does it really take a holmes tier analytical mind to understand why renters in tenal might not want to be renters in tenal anymore right now
---
This is a great post, much better than the usual goon/nc shithead back and forth, keep up the great work and I'll be checking out your site
---
you're retarded
---
Requests about his were ignored on the forums, let's hope they listen to reddit.
---
hey leave the special kid alone ok? Its not nice to pick on the kids who's parents keep them on a leash.
---
Well, what NC. and PL have lost were alliance assets that were paid for by renters, that we've had a higher income for, every single month, for 6-7 years (?).  You really have no clue how much money we've made from renting.
---
It really doesn't affect any of us personally  (maybe except Elliot, but he's rich anyway).
---
That makes this whole excercise kind of pointless, don'tyathink?
---
The vision left with Seagull
---
Yeah like, "hate speech"?  Disregarding for a moment that there is no such thing as hate speech, his bar for reaching hate speech status is incredibly low, to the point that essentially any speech not in active agreeance with him would be considered hate speech by him.
---
People on the internet are dicks. Welcome to the internet.
---
&gt;From my perspective goons are those who actually are winning this conflict.
---
that's an awfully long post you wrote for you to then sum it up by restating my point for me
---
Wait...so you're mad that someone doesn't want to undock into a blob?
---
the idiots on reddit who cycle between 800, 1200 1300 and 1500 titans depending on who is posting.
---
You seem to know things about us that Vince hasn't even decided yet.
---
With FLEX gates aridia is only 3 jumps from P. Falls.
---
&gt; Hope that clarifies something.
---
It does, thank you.
---
What's the current relationship betweeen HTP and Spectre?
---
Not stirring things up, I'm trying to understand the landscape.
---
Kills per day look like they follow a log-normal distribution.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution
---
It might be interesting to fit that curve over a 365 window of data, then slide the thing through time to see how the parameters of the curve change.
---
have fun evacing??
---
Do you plan to interview all the candidates?
---
Only my opinion, but most of the astrahus/raitaru and all EC in tribute/vale/tenal are renters or corps privately owned structures, probably a third/quarter of the fortizar are too, as were most azbels and some sotiyos.
---
People packed what they could or would, and left the rest to rot. Can't blame people for not wanting to unanchor medium citadels.
---
Outside of the 15w keepstar and C2X sotiyo that we removed, nothing major for the alliance has been unanchored as far as I know. All 3 remaining Keepstars will probably fall by the end of the war and will be casualties.
---
Don't get me wrong, all these structure losses are a huge financial cost, but it has less impact on the alliance than most people think.
---
source: I saw a dscan of a titan flex with 1288 undocked and I rounded up in your benefit
---
LMAO
---
&gt;Back in that era you could literally jump to the other side of the map in 10 minutes.  
---
And it was wonderful~
---
He tried to get me kicked from a corp because i looted a wreck from something i killed on a bait beacon... LOST HIS MIND.... even jumped in the titan and sat it next to me to dick swing. Local was like christmas but with umami flavoured snow drops
---
&gt;its not just what panfam are stopping, its the krabbing that isnt happeneing because people are in tribute, daily
---
You realize that's the same thing right?
---
Yes, we all know 8 titans worth of structures are dead in the north, and about the same in the south.
---
Does it matter? Not really.
---
&gt;depending on who is posting
---
it's almost like we're different individuals with access to different information
---
&gt; Although obviously as it represents structures it's still somewhat of a 'strategic hit'. 
---
In eve 2019, no.
---
&gt;I really hope we somewhere this year will see an epic big brawl with lots of titans dying
---
Would be useful to add the other drone variants that do split damage ('Augmented' and 'Integrated').
---
unfortunatly not,
---
goons not krabbing because they have toons in tribute is a self inflicted cost from goons which is counted as loss due to the war.
---
panfam roaming delve, killing the krabbers who are carrying on, along with the rest of N.E
---
and the losses on the frontline in tribute while panfam and goons fight, THAT is what panfam is causing.
---
i shouldnt hate you for your small minded understanding, your surrounded by people who think the same way. its not your fault your a goon.
---
What "NC/PL" have lost back hom has 0 impact on the alliance. Those are all year old structures funded by renters they have had for years and years.
---
Do you think anybody cares about tribute Ihubs?
---
This will matter as much to the Imperium now as it did to money badger a handful of years ago when the whole of the universe pushed the Imperium out of the north. The only thing that differs over that time period is that one side decided to build an empire for a specific purpose and the other side helicopter dicked until the meta changed and haven't stopped QQing about the meta change preventing them from being elitist try hards anymore.
---
Totally cool and not important.
---
Yeah that realistic galactic map just does not work because star's are just far to close to each other for it to be readable, they need to adopt one of the many mapping systems that the community came up with.
---
I mean, I would have taken everything even if they hadn't annoyed me. This is eve, trust nobody.
---
You personally d-scanned down 1288 in a system or is this the third-hand sister brother mother cousin thing?
---
Well nothing has changed , just nowadays they use skillinjector titans and supers with t1 fighter  😂
---
That opinion is completely relevant!  Just because it's for you doesn't mean it would be for everyone.
---
The ammo desperately needs to be sorted by range. For instance, titanium sabot and depleted uranium should ne next to each other, as should proton, nuclear and lead
---
&gt;tfw no personal botter empire to tax
---
This is a lot of words for saying "CFC has 50k members, NC/PL have 4k - They will each play the game they see fit".
---
Makes me wonder who is having more fun in this war. Structure bashing in Tribute or whale hunting in Delve?
---
you edit a quote in, ok, i admit my structuring is lazy, i mean, im at work talking to goons that will never see reason even if i word and structure it perfectly. but so far, anyone commenting on my posts has only left sub 10 word statements.
---
Simple , I would add 3 things and another 3 option ones
---
MAIN FEATURES:
---
\-----------------------------
---
1) the one thing that EVE desperately needs is PVP.  Judging from the massive success of Fortnite and Dota clones its clear that people love to PVP.  Make it easy for people to find fights and fight each other, give big rewards for those that participate in PVP or reduce the cost of losing a ship. Add PVP even in the PVE part of the game making it easy for player to either co op, or going against each other for completing PVE quests.
---
2) I would also improve PVE by removing the afk element, starting from the skill tree then moving to mining etc. Punish people who afk and multibox this making the game far more meanigful. Reduce the grind requirements to make afking activities unnecessary and with high risk, instead of the low risk high reward they are right now  
---
3) Add a quest system , different storylines with big rewards for the players but also the ability to affect the direction of the story.  The quest system will start from the time the player logins into the game for the first time. Thus the quest system will serve as a huge tutorial for the game making the need to resort to youtube video tutorials completely uneccessarily and thus making EVE very easy to play compared to the over complicated mess that is currently.  Quests should encourage coop so that experienced players help less experienced ones again with big rewards. 
---
BONUS OPTIONAL FEATURES :
---
\-------------------------------------------------
---
a ) Add the ability for player content. Player becomes able to create his own content that includes, custom ship designs, new customized modules, heavily customized Stations, ability to create his own missions and offer rewards to entice new players to his Corp. Essentially modularise EVE so everything brakes down to little blocks that player can use to redesign the entire game. Offer custom areas/arenas players can enter and create a mini game with their own rules. Add a scripting engine in game to allow to heavily customize and reskin the GUI as well create new NPC enemies with custom behaviors.  Ephasize on diplomacy, creating a new game path of a politician/diplomat with actual rewards, meditation courts , customized police forces etc.
---
b) Improve FPS camera when flying a ship allowing for very precise maneuvering that affects combat mechanics. FPS should be focused at start only for flying the ship , later one if time permits add ability to navigate inside the ship and finally the ability to navigate space and ground stations. 
---
c) Create a new path for scientists, researchers and explorers. Tie in with the quest system and allow players to come up with new technologies doing scientific experiments on planets and starts, each planets offering unique opportunities through the establishment of scientific colonies. Thus overhauling the industry with new technologies to battle new threats. See Star Trek for inspiration.
---
None of the above feature require a deep redesign of the game because they reuse existing features and they can be very gradually introduced. Please some of those features can take years to get to a complete state but as I said the goal here is progress not perfection.
---
it was fun for you, yes, and thats good and all   
---
but liteally anyone who wasnt part of the PL fleet did not have fun and get murdered in seconds
---
\*cough\*botting\*cough\*
---
and income. and members? (renters?)
---
nah thats not important.
---
you actually made your members sit through all that structure bashing...thats just evil
---
your handbook was the one that brought me back to the game after i felt there wasn't anything else to do for me, and made me a lot of new friends for life :) thank you ravine, you rockstar
---
\*you're
---
So you are saying the peak of imperium gameplay is mine for 3 years and then shoot structures for 20 days while posting on reddit about people not giving them the credit they feel they deserve?
---
Sounds like a great way to play eve online the computer game.
---
Two years of spending time recruiting and enduring the pain that is high sec... for an amount of isk you could make in a long evening on a single r64 moon pop. Bravo and well done.
---
You could lose this in a couple of dread brawls...
---
[Explain this then](https://i.imgur.com/Nm2vY98.png) because as it seems right now your enemies are not only winning the ISK war, they are also winning the fun war by shooting ships, not structures.
---
A day one account that has millions of skillpoints injected is very suspicious.
---
The peak of Imperium gameplay is to recruit players and create an environment in which they can enjoy playing the game how they want without putting them in little boxes and telling them to ignore certain aspects of the game because some random people on the internet only enjoys playing EVE one specific way.
---
Aren't you guys getting tired of this little rhetorical game? No matter who is the attacker and who is the defender, the arguments are always the same and have been for years. /r/eve is stale af.
---
Deliver a torpedo and that clone will have fun for the rest of his life
---
It's unfathomable for them to imagine a way of life other than their own. That's one of the dangers of getting caught in an echo chamber; when all you hear is the same thing over and over, and you have no knowledge, much less experience, of anything else, it can be overwhelming.
---
Sadly the problem is exacerbated with so many entry-level players and this being their first foray into nullsec alliances. Heck, players who want to leave sometimes find it difficult because they don't know what they would do to move their titan or super out, since most of them won't know the art of moving capitals subtly through hostile space.
---
The situation isn't the same in Panfam. Sure we occasionally get players who get tired of the game due to frustrations (mostly the 'blob warfare' issue which a lot of people really dislike) but it's an incredibly rare player who quits to go join 'the winning side', as Goons call it, and the allure of a Delve style lifestyle really doesn't appeal all that much to folks who don't live on the breadline, ISK wise.
---
If you need help you can ask. 
---
I have already done a comparaison zkill/CCP number, and you have a change : zkill count npc kill, and not CCP. So you have only PVP activity. 
---
And you have newbro PVP beacause not all newbro enter API in zkill. 
---
More over if you do that you can identify some corp who don't use zkill at all (like some in WH). 
---
It's interesting :)
---
He massively undervalued several of them he has a t2 tatara there for 24bil. The t2 tig alone is 70bil
---
I don't need an explanation, I actually didn't understand what you were saying until the fifth time I read it.
---
 "holy fuck why is this worth arguing about?"  
---
being off on your titan estimate by a few hundred seems like a pretty big deal.
---
wat?
---
The official number is 950~
---
The reason its harped on is how the number varies by hundred by poster. Then again that dscan is the only posted dscan currently, fake or not
---
One dumb design decision (among the many) of the new map is the non-black background, instead having some washed out grey or whatever. That fucks up contrast, a lot. They should revert it to full black like the old map. There's more to it, but this is one of them.
---
It's weird how no one but you is bothered by it though, right?
---
Must be some kind of conspiracy, lmao.
---
No corp can do everything. Any corp that says they do nullsec, wormholes, mining, industry, missions, pvp all in their advert is lying. Any corp that says they do everything is actually doing nothing at all.
---
People like corps with a goal and a focus. I.e our corp lives in X wormhole and we want to pvp in wh space. Or our corp lives in Amakake and we want to gate camp daily.
---
There is no value in lying or misrepresenting your corp because thats how you get people to join for 2 days and leave right away.
---
The word "or" has a meaning, you know?
---
because unlike the old map the background isnt actually black..
---
Not understanding how eve online alliances work, posts an essay about 8 titans worth of 2 year old structures.
---
10/10 would read again.
---
if you killing stuff in my house counts me killing your whole house counts... but I wouldn't expect a small minded panfamling to understand that.
---
&gt;  I thought NC. member were suppose to be smart?
---
Based on what?
---
Thank you dude that is a great story! I was in gents when you guys came and deployed against us iirc it was 401K we had some epic fights in vale.
---
There are agents in npc null, they also pay more than HS or LS agents.
---
your idea  would just make it even easier and safer to make isk in sov null. It's already too easy and way too safe.
---
keep going
---
you make this look like a quote from my post, but youve changed moved and added words, badly i might add, which im getting roasted for.
---
and no, i challenge anyone to tell me otherwise,
---
linemember income, and corporation/alliance income are separate things. they are not the same as taxt is a cut from linemember income
---
Well since most people use the map for hunting Dotlan just having the NPC's doesn't really help now does it?
---
I disagree, nullsec rolls in cash already. In terms of attracting new players, it would be better to add more 1..3/10 to lowsec!
---
Nice video, revenge is a dish best served cold!
---
Also, falcon pilots need cum from like 5 different guys a day to sustain their existence, I pity them.
---
I can assure you as a line member who pays for his accounts with a subscription making isk is not my priority I have boat loads.  Way more assets than I need or will ever use.   My only focus is burning down the northern sand castle in the hopes something better will come along and actually contest us someday.  As far as all the chest beating goes about what dies in delve I actually applaud those losses.  They mean absolutely nothing to me and as far as I’m concerned the players who are losing big assets were never going to contribute anything to the alliance anyway.  As a goon F1 line member I hope that this conveys to you what I and a lot of others think and feel.
---
&gt;without putting them in little boxes and telling them to ignore certain aspects of the game because some random people on the internet only enjoys playing EVE one specific way.
---
What alliance actually does this? INIT?
---
well. it would. but PL isnt at war.
---
Id of kill are incremental but they count NPC kill.
---
Use the pvpv only give by CCP is interesting.
---
Nice! I remember GENTS!
---
Maybe it's just nostalgia, but I miss that period of EVE, heh.
---
Iiiiroooonyyyyy
---
wholesome story
---
Well if you have any hints as to how to do that, I would be interested.
---
I was just thinking of scrapping the files, if they respect a convention for file naming, but it does not seem to be the case ([https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/aws/community/EVEOnline\_MER\_Apr2019.zip](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/aws/community/EVEOnline_MER_Apr2019.zip)) :(
---
You wouldn't inject them before joining, and after joining there's an excuse of being able to fly all doctrines. Also you can spin up like a hundreds of accounts at the same time and put them into noob friendly corps to ripen.
---
The reason you can't do the same in eve easily is not due to lack of name changing functionality, but because of existance of various websites that track the player activity history, and people in general being more paranoid about security in eve.
---
i'm gonna go ahead and stop humoring you now
---
fair game but remeber it is not a loss if you mined it yourself :)
---
lol right because they totally aren't part of panfam, boy you guys can spin so hard you put goons to shame.
---
beyond a 2:1 titan advantage it hardly matters how many you actually have, again, it really doesn't seem like something worth getting as worked up about as the multiple goon posters currently badgering me about this
---
it's really not, and you're being intentionally obtuse if you won't admit that you know why
---
All of it, they embraced the industrial complex and empire building. Init tends to internally rib people for mining in a fun and pointed manner. Hurfblurf have to save damn carebear mining. I imagine it's like that everywhere though. But the big thing is that particularly goons embraced it whereas most entities in game have a big poo poo mentality that is anti carebear.
---
Nope, we're not playing their game.
---
Much like you stopped humoring facts or grammar. Good on you.
---
There is a simple way to check the cost added - get the rig material cost. Show /r/EvE the lies that are spread. And check the salvage numbers, is a market even holding as many items as you need to make the rig.
---
okay bye
---
Well, "most" people is not everyone, and you sincerely pulled that statement out of your ass.
---
Moreover, if you think Dotlan is useless you don't know how to use it (or are to lazy to even try, because it's pretty simple).
---
Again, I'm not saying the old map is bad, I use it from time to time, but Dotlan is a great complement and I use it far more often than the map.
---
o/
---
are you being serious? or playing dumb here? 
---
of course they are part of panfam. but you cant wardec panfam, it doesnt exist in the game only the players know what this means.
---
goonswarm declared war USING THE IN GAME WAR DECLERATION TOOL on PH and NC.
---
PL IS WAS NOT DECLARED WAR ON SO THE STRUCTURE WAS TRANSFERABLE EASILY.
---
garreth, seriously mate, considering ive seen you not even know about goons ihub being destroyed. proberly the only agressive action taken and you dont know it. im going to stop talking to a nobody. youve let yourself and goons down. 
---
how could you think i was 'twisting things saying pl isnt in panfam?' i mean its fucking PANfam FFS
---
For native english speakers its a common typo.
---
And for not native english speakers they sound similar and they get into the habiting of it.
---
I'm not saying Dotlan is useless at all, both are needed and both serve a function but one isn't entirely better than the other, there are some things Dotlan does so much better than the new eve map and there are things that the new map does compared to Dotlan. There's absolutely no reason to be hostile.
---
seriously? horde put you on their last position?
---
Unlike goons we aren't all a hivemind.
---
actually are we dancing cause your alliance lost around 1.5 T already while you shott structures. Now you can say whow useless krabs are nothing of value. And a structure is also nothing of value. So no matter what you think about is courently a win for either one. 
---
It is just diffrent point of views. From my point of view i love this Situation cause you never could kill juicy stuff in Delve since 2 Years.
---
From your point of view you win cause you galssing my home. 
---
So we both win. Let's grab some beer while it lasting...
---
&gt; The fact is the whole game is setup akin to pre-World War I
---
No, that was 2007-2010.
---
Currently the whole game is setup like a more extreme version of the current US Hegemony over the world, except the sole superpower has fully automated luxury gay communism and provides free healthcare, and also the second most powerful hegemony still thinks feudal serfdom is a good way to run their economy.
---
It's nice you try to help, but i doubt those acronyms mean much to a new player or outsider. x)
---
I highly recommend the "empires of eve" book. Especially the hard cover is just beautiful.
---
Can't really blame them. We've been bashing their shit for 7-8 years and are fully aware of the futile stupidity of it all. It's their time to learn what it means.
---
im sure his calculation are as good and honest as he could get them. 
---
but why? forever weve gone off zkill values. but in an attempt to make goons look better off he is digging deep to increase the total isk loss on panam side.
---
what i have said is if that is that case, how about we include the amount of isk NOT being generated at goonswarm HQ, s that would amount to something far larger than these slight slight increases of killmail value.
---
he can also do the same for every ship goons lost, running the same formula, and it would be significantly more come the end.
---
Wait hold up, you're getting ISK values from how they were previously fit, based on information only you can provide? Lmao.
---
Uh yeah dude I know for a fact that two of the three titans killed in Delve were decked out in full AT tier abyssal rolled officer modules, they just pulled the modules off before we caught them. Oh what you want evidence? Just going to have to take my word for it, the fits, I seen't it.
---
It's been the line since the last fight in X-47.
---
Yes, deliberately so.
---
Drone Region Federation. Same difference, just for reference. :)
---
Your empires are safe in my wallet. This is not a scam i repeat this is not a scam.
---
I don't know either. But talking about downvotes seldom help the situation.
---
So I did a little napkin math calculation: since May 19th, Delve has seen more than 431b in supercap losses by Imperium entities.
---
I have not included any losses from Querious or Fountain, nor have I included any rorqual/carrier/dread losses from any of the 3 regions. If we factored all those in, I wonder if goon krab losses would exceed panfam structure losses?
---
Also, what's the total losses when you exclude all the non-panfam groups? I think I saw fweddit, fedup, and evictus things in your list.
---
Thanks for the comment, I will try to fit it in Python then, should not be too hard (-\_-')
---
I plotted each [year independantly](https://imgur.com/a/sd0FtPI), looks like that you're right on the log-distribution, so I will try the moving window.
---
I could get behind that. As apart of this I kind of think sites should only be restricted on the top end not the bottom so a refuge should spawn in all space but a haven only spawns in null and should be special. I agree with you though that a good start would be with low sec.
---
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
---
your completely missing the point of this OP's post, this conversation, and how to equally count who is destroying what where.
---
how do you miss the part where goons are loosing billions of isk a day before anything is shot, destroyed or stolen.
---
yes panfam loose too, but god the differences are insane for sure.
---
'' if you killing stuff in my house counts me killing your whole house counts... ''
---
i actually agree with this completely, which is funny, because most goons are saying 'killing stuff in our house doesn't count!'
---
you are just to dumb to see what you have just said to me xD
---
And then we found out that our current lands suck, for that to be possible.
---
Why the fuck would we ever care about renter alliance killboards anyway?

Hell, we barely care about our own ones, lol. The only value a killboard has is as a record of history, to show that something happened. It's a real danger with a player driven game like EVE that when it collides with things like historical revisionism (e.g. what Imperium does with WWB) then there is a real chance the community will forget the past.
---
You are a angry person. Thanks for your input.
---
Me too dude and I really had literally no clue what or why things that where happening at that time where happening haha
---
We used to take fleets to venal and I did not understand why or what we were even doing, I just used to get on with it lol
---
It is a big shame groups like gents and 401K die out.
---
That would be interesting as well as the loss in renter income for the north.
---
All said and done it would be pretty nifty, esp. in the longer term picture ones goons go back to generating income vs the longer term loss of rental income.
---
&gt;This is eve
---
That's just a really weak excuse. It should say 'this is the worst of eve'. I can *somewhat* understand someone using director roles to take revenge for past events, but you're essentially fucking over many for the actions of a few higher-ups and doing so for trivial reasons is just a show of bad character.
---
CCP even made a video about the best parts about Eve called 'This is EVE'. They don't show some director dragging all Corp assets into a freighter and getting out as fast as possible because this is not what Eve's about. 
---
&gt;trust nobody, and especially don't give some stranger over the internet access to all of your corp assets.
---
The director did nothing wrong. At a certain point you just have to trust others with roles and ressources. He waited two years to give you access to 20Bil of ressources, that's more than reasonable. If we'd never trust others on the internet we'd all have family&amp;Friends run micro-corps with outsider having no chance of climbing the Corp-Careerladder.
---
can you ask them for a reward? like a trophy or something? i mean ... YOU WON
---
Well that is just it we need more ways to blow stuff up brining more players to null does that
---
Was telling a buddy that i want to live in abyss space. A day after that snuff puts up a pos, you dirty fkin mindreaders &lt;3
---
Guessing your change to null would be more super caps so you can afk bot in your vni better
---
there is so much to take into this 'who is loosing more' thing.
---
thats why this post is as much a bunch of bollox as the rest of the goonswarm shitstream.
---
none of them seem to be able to grasp the loss they have and are acting like a brainwashed soldier who just CANNOT reason with the truth if the truth is anti goon in anyway
---
ill bet you a beer that hes is an FC aswell
---
I planned on offering 3% taxes
---
As others have pointed out, this would only work if it weren't so insanely easy to TZ tank a citadel. If I can perpetually and pre-emptively put the RF timer for a citadel on a Wednesday at 4am, it simply won't die and won't encourage conflict.
---
We have an infrastructure to return to. We are killing nc.'s which if they want tribute will have to be rebuilt.  Which is more important the ships killed or the ability to build those ships that have been killed.  I would argue that your underlying infrastructure is the true power in today's meta. It is what allowed goons to catch up and surpass panfam in supers and titans in just 2 years.

Chronicle: [https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/children-of-light/](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/children-of-light/)
---
&gt; like what? I dont see a niche they can fullfill without turning them OP again. 
---
When were navy battleships OP? 
---
Examples of Navy Battleship progression/niche:
---
Tempest Fleet Issue:
---
7.5% Tracking per level
---
7.5% large projectile rate of fire per level
---
Can either add a gun or increase drone bandwidth to make up for lost dps.
---
The TFI would continue the minmatar tracking bonused fleet ships. The only tracking bonused projectile battleship is the Vargur, no pirate ship has a tracking bonus. This opens up a niche to have a relatively cheap battleship hull with a tracking bonus that doesnt overlap with the mach, t1 pest or mael.
---
Raven Navy Issue:
---
5% bonus to heavy missile, torpedo and cruise missile damage per level
---
5% bonus to explosion radius per level
---
-1 Launcher
---
+fitting
---
Applies better than a bargest with comparable damage. Not as fast as the barg, doesnt have as much range or the scram/point bonus.
---
Those are examples of how faction BS can be improved/find a niche without outclassing pirate battleships.
---
As far as marauders go, where in the ship description or ship tree for the marauder does it say its PVE only? Ships are platforms and EVE is a sandbox. Ships can be used however the pilot chooses. 
---
A rattlesnake can tank every lvl4 mission just fine, has selectable damage and can also MJD. Very rarely are you needing to MJD in a mission every minute. While some scenarios exist for that to move through a site without prop, do you really *need* a marauder thats costs 3 rattlesnakes to do it? No.
---
Honestly if they just imported Dotlan in game, it would be 500% better
---

---
Why use a map when you're soon going to be able to see local and who's docked at 3 jumps away using the Agency?
---
Shut up you fat cunt !
---
MFW we might actually get a wormholer on the CSM
---
Good work Olmeca, a lot of your ideas I agree with and this game definitely needs more explosions. Nullsec is way too safe. To me it seems like local chat and umbrellas are the biggest offenders. What are your biggest solutions to address the safety of nullsec?
---
I think it's to counter all the "but look at that you've lost" sperging that goes on while taking measures to minimize  kill board impact.  I do wish he'd have included the recon scans for verification purposes.
---
Both sides do loss minimizing in different ways, it's always amusing to see.
---
That's not that pleasant.
---
I agree it is bad character, I didn't set out to fuck the corp over and 20bil isn't a lot, but I'm not sorry for what I did, I saw an opportunity to make a bit of ISK when I left and I took it.
---
How does that work? Surely you aren't implying takeing 15 jumps by gate doesn't count? It also doesn't help you with the supers.
---
&gt; we barely care about our own ones
---
you might not 👀👀👀
---
i don't think pl cares about killboards per se, we just care about making shit explode and it's dope when the things we blow up are worth a lot of money. there have been alliances in the past actually rabidly obsessed with killboard efficiency to the point of being ridiculed, but we're not that
---
Ah to clarify my statement was one of incredulity, generally, and not aimed at you specifically :D
---
Sorry if that's how it sounded, though of course its good to hear your perpective too.
---
I mean a big fight might have a couple hundred extra kills at most.
---
&gt; people in general being more paranoid about security in eve.
---
entirely this.
---
the "you might not" part was a zing btw
---
Did you just apply in game or did you apply out of game? Most corps except Pandemic Horde will have you do an out of game application first and once that is approved you apply in game and are accepted. Many corps will also want you to do an interview on comms to make sure you're not an idiot.
---
Yeah I just graciously ignored it you cunt lol
---
Excellent question
---
What facts ? What feelings ? Wtf are you on about ?
---
Danm, lovely eve sociopaths &lt;3
---
Cant imagine how would be a post-eve life
---
it's just bants, it's more fun if we both play tbh
---
Isn't FEDUP a TAPI vassal?
---
“How do rigs work”
---
You think the reason theres not much PVP going on is because nullbears don't make enough ISK? What planet do you live on?
---
800 bil sounds a lot less impressive, huh
---
It's funny that nc/pl is getting a lot of credit for a group headed by olmeca and marshy and full of snuff
---
Certainly not CCP, apparently
---
And as an NC line member,  nobody cares about tribute or the losses we've sustained
---
Oh lookee here suddenly the war is 0isk to 0isk.
---
Youth can't just invalidate losses be cause you don't care.  On either side.
---
Yeah, I get that looking at the numbers, but I thought I would be able to see at least a bump :p
---
Yes but also no, and I don't intend to start again.
---
I think you missed the point completely, but that isn't surprising.
---
The point isn't that rigs were removed and destroyed, the point is the only source of what those rigs allegedly were is a source that is historically untrustworthy for impartial information.
---
But you've made that bed for yourselves, so you sleep in it I guess. You will gain comfort from the other GoonCo reading the thread who would be happy to lap up the information as facts, though.
---
No it really doesn't. It just makes bigger blobs even bigger and safer.
---
If goons, test or horde get another few players nothing much will change.
---
And in all of the above, 1 day old characters can make more isk, than any kind of hisec anomalys/combat sites, by salvaging or exploring and or asking for donations.
---
If you want more explosions, you want people more spread out, not having everything nice and easy in a pocket under the supercap umbrella. 
---
If anything they should buff npc null and ls, to get some more people to move there.
---
Even that's changed within ncpl tbh. It's not something specific to goons. You're not special lol
---
&gt;but I'm not sorry for what I did
---
That's good, admitting a mistake is the first step to redemption!
---
Now send 20B to Gerier and you'll be guiltfree.
---
To the basic extent, /u/Cpt_Soban covered it. But as it is, supercaps are treated as proverbial nuclear warheads for alliances. If they have to spend their stocks in order to survive, all the better. Less power projection, more localized combat.
---
Huh, 2 years to get a good krab session's worth of isk
---
This is like USA bashing a small country
---
Any thng that they do and have a feeling of victory, it worth much more than the mega massive goon blob
---
Its just not fun anymore. Congrats to goons, that learned how to play the game and how to win.
---
Other alliances just failed miserably.
---
No one is special.
---
I sometimes fly a  dual prop brawly  stabber fleet
---
Nice to fly, but there is better ship out there :D 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75375109/
---
My mom doesn't lie to me
---
Been a while since I've seen a heist post. High five.
---
It's a hisec manufacturing corp, nobody respects those. I always thought they just existed to get robbed.
---
Ask her about the disappointment.
---
Not gonna lie, im shamelessly stealing this idea and carrying it with me.
---
One of best names in game
---
That name, bumping haulers ahahahahaha
---
You make zero sense. What do you think adding sell/buy restrictions would do?
---
I interviewed 12 total, I didn't have time to interview all 40~, so I focused on getting a spread of candidates who I thought had a strong shot at getting elected.
---
Haha wow gottem lmao nice xd
---
Oh I don't need to to know I'm the family disappointment.
---
Hahah do you really think goons do not have bots? You had the safest space in eve up until you deployed to shoot static structure, mattani publicly announced that he would kick anyone that reported “friends” for botting. Yeah keep on dreaming... your alliance can shoot at timers all it wants, can count the 0.1isk buy killing Ihubs and poco XD we are nomads, your leadership will spin like they always have/ training exercise /they have all the bots/ they are baddy’s/ blah blah blah..
---
my man
---
Only for Jay
---
A weird homeless community that behave more like a distributed parasite looking for the right conditions to flourish, held together by Teamspeak and some new cross game kill mail system.
---
r/evegonewild is real, but 8 years since the last post
---
Rip no life industries llc
---
There are other old maps?  
---
Nobody who wants to use the map efficiently, ever uses the new map for sure.
---
If you have been on a goon structure bashing fleet, you would know the answer to that.
---
Great post that understands alot of the meta development in a very succinct way
---
The amount of gained isk is sooo abysmally low that i cannot describe the level of fail OP has successfully achieved.
---
Both are doing what they do best.
---
One side keeps on mining, but structures.
---
The other picks with with an opponent equal to them, retarded krabs.
---
Now all we needs is for the Invasions to head out to Null... and give them a decent fight.
---
That's a fair point!  You only released 6 so far if I'm not mistaken, so who else we have left to here from?  Did you interview omeca gold by any chance.
---
r/woosh
---
Baghdad Bob has returned.
---
atleast its not stained
---
Jesus, that’s awesome! Great tactic you got here, mind if I try using it?
---
Is this a meme or what?
---
I'd like to see an answer to this.
---
You might want to delete this one.
---
definatly. this is completly going over your head.
---
you cant comprehend how linemembers earn X amount. and the Alliance earn X/25%
---
so they are not the same
---
The difference between Jita and Delve prices perhaps?
---
Do I really need to explain how I am making fun of you?
---
The cope is strong with this one
---
For the people who don't often jump onto cynos, how big is 15-20 light years in the scale of the map?
---
Id imagine the majority of those small solo corps would be unable to field the dps to rf their own structures.
---
And all the thousands of dead pos towers would still start dying.
---
*clap gif*
---
i mean, now you have me interested that ive missed a vital part here.
---
if i have call me out on it, and dont be so fucking scared of just saying it.
---
Thanks so much for this post. People are only using the current online players as a tool to see how active EVE is, while Killmarks is a far better indicator for ingame content/activities.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Well done. This is how Eve plays war.
---
Thinking about it. Those big fight kills wouldn't happen in a vacuum. Get a few thousand people today for a fight, those people are now killing eachother, as opposed to anything else they'd normally kill. And if the fight because a 6 or 7 hour tidi slugfest, that might be notable.
---
Rage rolling a hole that can support 30 passes from a cap sounds like an absolute nightmare. We typically have to roll a hole multiple times a night before we get somewhere that isn't either completely empty or only occupied by bots and you have to roll again usually within an hour or two once the locals have given up fighting. What groups are you imagining would live in these c6s you're proposing?
---
They said EVE is all about excel and I wasn't believing it.
---
this feels like you saying this to try and argue goons will win this war.
---
of course goons will win, and come out on top. no one has ever said otherwise to be honest.
---
the fact is goons are taking loss. heavy loss, they they refuse to recognise.
---
you say goons have overtaken panfam etc etc, they have, but they know shit about using it. and theyre members and FC's are weak, or seem it. that or the linemembers who knows maybe they just dont listen.
---
but as powerful as goons are, this is no walkover. theyve lost more subcap value than they care to admit. they refuse to count capital losses at 'home' when they are a massive factor. and no one yet has counted in loss of earning (the true amount) into all of this.
---
What this guy really said: no u
---
use the enduring AB if using the 100mn one, also what are your navigation skills at with AB cap usage.
---
incase its not been said yet, oversize prop can use alot of fitting,
---
dual props usually are normal sized modules. both fitted for different occasions.
---
ie: blaster boat MWD's in range, grabs target, then uses AB to keep them there.
---
or a frigate MWDs into tackle. but then orbits with AB to mitigate the incomming damage
---
I don't see how stealing from a place where you make essentially no money is worth any timeinvestment. It's like going into the slums and stealing the Catfood of some hobo next to a burning trashcan and then running of to your gated Community.
---
The only real thing you're doing is disincentivate People to play eve and maybe go into low/null when they had their fill of Highsec.
---
I'm not sure what you mean exactly?
---
But I guess the fact that you are not 'creating' new player in a big fight, but just displacing them to all shoot at each other is the cause for that absence of bump.
---
I would very much like to look at value destroyed though, that would be a better indicator for these big fights I would say (people trading losing a few sub caps to a few expensive caps and super caps).
---
ask me about belly rubs
---
Or a gang smaller than a microgang. I get people bitching at me for using your definition sometimes. I don't know why.
---
Haha sounds fun lets do it 😂
---
Wait you guys DIE doing that now? God, what did I teach your FC team before I left?
---
Yes and no I would say.
---
But ships are still definitely dying, which is good. However, what is frightening and would need to be put into perspective is that the value produced increases with each MER, while value destroyed at best stagnates, which leads to the current ISK inflation that we are observing.
---
People do that. Faction war, spectre fleet, or any of the fun null and wormhole corps do frig roams all the time. Pretty much any pvp corp! While it's silly to call this a new idea I have no idea why people are downvoting it. It sounds like you're some hisec carebear waking up to the fact that there's actually a GAME here. Good to have ya.
---
for years people cried for more money, higher income, its not that change that has caused ANY issues.
---
the only thing that has caused issues is Skill injection. without that the growth rate is far more controllable. but im sure CCP will never let that goldmine go lol
---
It’s a good story and all but it sounds fake. So because people are carebears who apparently never PvP’d before and are just arguing, that caused an entire shard of a mobile game to shutdown? Cmon man.
---
&gt; How do you intend to 'break the wheel' when you have some serious communication issues? I
---
Anyone under your coaalition's toxic pressure would have serious communication issues. It's a miracle I didn't implode into full Gevlon so far. The very fact that I still have some reputation means I have good communication skills. And I have improved so much overtime.
---
Since you or your representatives won't be able to blatantly do that during CSM meetings/comms I'm not worried about that at all.
---
First you (Goons) said noone wanted to work with me. We got more than 10 entities cooperating together to kill stuff.
---
Then you said noone liked me. Now I got a solid shot for CSM election with hundreds' backing.
---
Now you say I don't have comms skills. That'll prove wrong too.
---
You just keep believing in narratives you either make up about me, or you directly cause. If you sling shit at someone as hundreds of people, it's only natural he comes off as the shitlord as the person in the center.
---
I never have used the new map. I stick with the old one since is so much better.
---
It's really not, if you're doing it longterm like the way this guy did it.
---
Smash and grab on hisec indy corps is always valid, if they're dumb enough.
---
If we're talking about retaining players and keeping hisec healthy, having a hisec where pos theft goes away is not an improvement. Pos theft ran RAMPANT in the healthiest days of the hisec economy, and it's a sign of success.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you on that one..however it did get to a point that they made so much isk and had such a large cap fleet like PL did that no one would attempt to take them
---
  Therefore rich just got richer and bigger and stronger.  
---
 CCP should have replaced that content driver with something else.  I remember when we only had a few 10/10 DEDS around and we would fight over them for control so we could make some isk and get some rare mods.  Now CCP have them escalating everywhere and they can be done solo.
---
There is literally nothing to fight over now.  Yes you can still fight over moons but now those alliances cant even be arsed to mine them.  So they literally rent them out (renting for me is a massive issue needs to be sorted btw) so now they make isk through another passive moon mining way lol.. its mental..
---
The issue is now everyone and mainly goons have got so big and everyone wants to protect that everyone is just blue.  So even if you do have another content isk driver they again take it and it never gets taken back (I've got my caps than you syndrome)
---
Even cap have got cheaper and cheaper ita just becoming silly
---
Citadels should be 10x the cost and take longer to build and anchor to avoid this spamming..
---
I mean really a space station is the same price as a decent fitted tengu? Wtf
---
Again supers and titans far too cheap, far too easy to build etc etc especially now rorqs are here...
---
I wish personally they would fix this stuff and then create a new instance for others to have a chance. Now it's got like this for so long that alliances have got so powerful so big (I mean a 10000 man alliance is becoming common) that they swallow everything up.
---
We need some real massive fundamental changes in  in every part of the eve universe almost like a eve tiercide.
---
This man speaks the truth.
---
snuffed out to disband? wtf did i miss while goons made all this noise?
---
Because it encouraged a totally passive income stream where the only response the average line member ever had to make to actually help earn those sweet R64 SRP bucks was when someone dared to bash the POS stick.
---
Maybe. We'd have to ask people rolling wormholes with no intention of killing farming ships though. We won't want to be invasive to other playstyles.
---
That's what I meant to say. I'm still not awake quite yet :p
---
"oh sir you claim you don't care about ihubs in the 12th region your alliance have lived in? LIES AND PRIPAGANDA! YOU ARE DEVESTATED!"
---
In an ideal scenario, the Invasion finally makes its way out to Null, and the Xordazh ships will essentially be mobile citadels. I want the Triglavians to put a *visible dent* in the big blocs’ forces, requiring the involvement *and hopeful loss* of the Supercap Umbrellas to overcome.
---
Nothing said before the word but really counts.  And what you said after the word but is basically calling him a liar.
---
In my post that I link I say that system will cause people to "cycle" regions. Any system in which people can "cycle" won't work. Many alliances do it for moon mining anyway. Won't be so hard to coordinate.
---
Well, given there's piss all to fight about in low now (and yes, Snuff killed lowsec so I guess it's a bit rich for me to complain about it), I guess the low-effort wealth fountains were good?
---
I see you have already begun your HTFU (Harden The Fuck Up) plan. Excellent. You will do well in this game. :)
---
zkill is completely irrelevant for things that don't actually get sold
---
Thanks!
---
im saying any investigation without evidence should be, and will be considered a lie.
---
guy should source the scan proof before posting or be fine with people not willing to believe a goon. how could he find that offensive. he knows it. you know it now.
---
like goon mining time loss, or goon ratting time loss?
---
 ok i gotcha.
---
“Crow” 
---
Dear god man. Stiletto or Malediction or bust
---
Lots, though the vast majority of them have moved out of hisec and joined the big nullsec blocs for better security and mining/manufacturing yields, as well as the fulfillment of doing war production for a major effort in the game's history.
---
How true that last bit is really comes down to the players lol. But yeah they're out here in null. Or in wormholes, almost every wormhole corp has at least some significant degree of industry going.
---
The map as a whole is a box about 80 ly up and down, with a depth of ~15ly.
---
What it's really about is you get 3 jumps in quick succession. First jump gives you ~1h fatigue and a ~6 minute cooldown. Second jump maxes you out at 5h fatigue and you have another ~6 minute cooldown. Third jump resets you back to 5h fatigue again and leaves you with a 20-30 minute cooldown. You can blitz those 3 jumps in ~15-20 minutes and get a little more than half way across low sec. Closer to 2/3rds if you can use the right gates in between jumps. [Shirshochin &lt;-&gt; Agaullores](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/route/Shirshocin::Agaullores) and [Akkio &lt;-&gt; Todifraun](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/route/Akkio::Todifrauan) being good examples.
---
To be clear on ranges, Supers have 6ly range, Capitals have 7ly, Blops have 8ly and JFs/Rorquals have 10ly.
---
Big shout out to pornmaker for keeping Snuff relevant the past year.  Being a director in the movie industry is hard work and I know how hard it is to balance real life duties with Eve.  Finding the right talent with the right size is a never ending pursuit and hope you still make some time to see you on zkill but not in local, stay out of my local channel. 
---
Best of luck maker o porn.
---
Cherrypicked examples are totally representative of a sample
---
I think you should come to terms with that Eve is a risk/reward game, and can't expect to operate/farm in places that's supposed to be dangerous with 0 risk.
---
In my system your isk/hr won't change. Because if we ever get to increase the risk sufficiently, I'd also argue to increase the reward sufficiently. You'd have to lose 15% of your farm on average in lost ships. But you'd also earn more income per hour to make up for it.
---
If you still don't want that, you can farm in safer spaces. Do incursions, do abyssal, and so on.
---
Probably because you're the only one using those terms.
---
doing the lords work my friend. Welcome back home.
---
well. i looked at loads. whatever your picking the point out that isnt important of what im trying to say, my fault im sure for bad posting.
---
i presumed copying his entire thread, and spamming it inot one huge post would of gone down nicely.
---
You would just claim the scan pastes were faked even if they were posted
---
Probably got AWOXED lol
---
Wasn't there also a post on that sub by someone bitching about an infiltration and asking the ark devs to ban people like that, which caused the sub to get flooded by EVE players?
---
Considering that zkill doesn't show any of these, by your argument, yes.
---
if thats what you feel you needed to say, fine.
---
you are however, the usual state of a goon
---
:)
---
Here is a sentence from my CSM bid, before making all the suggestions:
---
I also recognize the fact that CSM is ultimately a focus group. People seldom get their own specific ideas inside the game. But voters still deserve to know what I think the ways to fix Eve’s main problems are. And CSM candidates should be elected with their ideas showcased.
---
Pandemic Horde.
---
In a shocking revelation, it's fun to harp on a guy for believing something that is ludicrous.
---
I think it's too invasive. Instead, I propose a single local delayed ship type which would be a solid bot hunter (pasting the relevant section of my document:
---
----------------------------------------------
---
So here is the compromise: A new ship that is local delayed. Here are the specifics:
---
Upsides: Covert cloaky. 0 recalibration. 150 seconds local delayed. Agile. Fast warping. Good ongrid speed. This ship would be a +1 scout hunter.
---
Downsides: 0 damage. Has tank similar to recon ship. No probing or ewar bonus. Can’t light covert cynoes. Can’t take black ops bridges. No use at all as a mainline fleet ship.
---
I believe this ship would be ultimate solution to making local a little less safe. And it would be the ultimate solution against botting.
---
Where's the proof?
---
you have both fitted, then you click on the one you want, then it works
---
Upcoming are;
---
Thursday - Olmecca Gold + Jurius Doctor
---
Saturday - Stitch Kaneland + Matthew Dust
---
(Fri or Sun depending on how fast I edit) - Cable Uta (RIP) + Cornak Firefist
---
in a shocking revelation, i have literally never cared about your opinion
---
If I have to cite for you the many examples of Killahbee saying this then you are not as inormed as you claim to be.
---
That's fine and all. You're still a gullible dope.
---
This is why EVE will never be mainstream. The world is not ready.
---
Horde certainly don't have an antikrabbing mentality.
---
Can you explain to unaware populous what that number actually means
---
&gt; don't give a flying fuck about our space          
---
Why have so much in first place?
---
A gang of nano cruisers was and is often referred to as a nano gang. You haven't had your coffee yet.
---
TIL that the logistics director of one of the largest alliances in the game has no idea how alliances work.
---
Yep it is, you are right.
---
AMEN
---
True. 
---
But if NCPL declares Goons their arch enemy, while goons do the same.          
---
It is hard to deny fact who is stream rolling who.
---
Which is why other game companies should pay CCP for containing us on TQ :P
---
Those first few weeks whaling in delve is the most fun I've ever had in this game. Meeting people from different parts of New Eden, listening to their tall tales while sitting on that blops, waiting for some of the best hunters in Eve to catch something. Those weeks fixed my goal for the next few years. I am going to be one of those hunters.
---
Ow, probably about a trillion. Does that pay for depleting Jita of Bhaalgorns? I suspect you guys are green on the invasion at this point.
---
Roger that!  Thank you for your effort, I thoroughly enjoying this
---
Possibly. I mean they did welp like 300b of bhaalgorns the other day.
---
thats perfect
---
By the way this is probably due to the formatting issue, but the evepraisal output from pasting the scan information is the far right column in the table.  It might be cut off for you.  Same caveat with regards to rig prices since it's about as accurate as the price for an Upwell Palatine Keepstar.
---
The problem is botting and the fact that real players are on the decline. The players that ARE here are really fighty and active. We can definitely turn this around.
---
Fucking 10/10
---
I don't understand how a structure that is still providing the same income as before. Is suddenly unwanted. It just sounds like everyone got butt hurt over having to align with some kind of logistics group to reap the rewards of the moons they held.
---
The moons never left, it just required more people to harness no?
---
Your arrogance is yet to surpass your stupidity yet it is not far off..
---
My bad, I lost the thread and thought we were talking hs more generally. Apologies.
---
WOW yeah we totally faked a dscan to boost your titan numbers :D 
---
O M G are you actual really thinking this way? I mean come one you are just trolling.... right?
---
all in all. my point in trying to make, isnt the credibility of this mans post, as much as my bad wording makes it out to be, it is infact how superficial this is. and how very one sided this view is.
---
guess im sick of seeing goon propaganda said as fact all the time lol
---
yeah i loled too there :D
---
&gt;If we're talking about retaining players and keeping hisec healthy, having a hisec where pos theft goes away is not an improvement. Pos theft ran RAMPANT in the healthiest days of the hisec economy, and it's a sign of success.
---
Well, i guess it's a sign of success for the concept of a sandbox, but I have to question it's success when it comes to the detriment of leaking players, especially in a place that is supposed to be for newbros.
---
&gt;Smash and grab on hisec indy corps is always valid, if they're dumb enough.
---
Again, preying on their inexperience of how autistic and evil EVE players can be is just the worst. You even admit it that they have to be 'stupid enough' for it to be worth it, so maybe just don't do it at all? They don't have to be robbed to learn that eve is a harsh place, let them join a bigger corp and someone will tell them.
---
one or two pepegas away im sure
---
Will admit that I shed a tear at the end.
---
Other than some bad grammar with the They're, there, and a lack of theirs, i very much enjoyed this read.
---
Test alliance used to have just such a method. It was called game of the month. I think the last time we honestly went overboard on another game was archage. We stole tons of property through bad game mechanics, blockaded entire PVP ports slaughtering hundreds of other players, and generally had most of the rest of the server absolutely despising us..
---
the best part, these were simple players coming from games where actions did not have consequences. Multiple times I heard statements like "dying in &lt;insert their other favorite game&gt; has consequences, it can set your whole guild back or ruin a raid". imagine facing that mentality where people were even remotely scared to actually lose large engagements, meanwhile eve players are over here basically playing in god mode because they know if they die none of their shit gets dropped with it. Add in the fact that we could muster 80 players easily, and still have that be a fraction of our total alliance, when the next a largest in game guild had 60 members *total*, and it's a recipe for some interesting gameplay. 
---
Unfortunately At the time we should have realized through kermity stealing half the property on the server that maybe theft was sort of his thing -.-
---
perhaps I should have added that this dscan originated from us.
---
But sure, everything is about you.
---
Well, the thing is - the people dying in Delve were told to deploy and stop fuckin krabbing and eating shit. They're not on the strategic map, they are just losses due to stupidity and/or botting. They shouldn't be considered as part of the strategic objective.
---
Differ from TEST losing a ratting super, where it's lost in our home space, to the enemy, while we're fighting a border war - we could have possibly saved it depending on how stupid. So that counts at least tangentially as a war loss.
---
When it comes down to it, them welping baltecs a few times means their isk victory isn't THAT crazy, but denying a whole region ihub upgrades? Ow. Sorry, but as much as I personally hate goons, they're winning this war.
---
Keep killing their shit at home with the rest of us pls, it's funny as fuck and hopefully it hurts em.
---
\&gt;loses regions along with infrastructure
---
\&gt;tries to hide those loses in alliance-less corps
---
\&gt;loses ratting income
---
\&gt;loses PI income
---
\&gt;loses mining and moon income
---
\&gt;screeches "but muh Delve kills!"
---
Look, the killboard damage done is about the same. Thing is, Goons are gonna go back home and keep on getting fat. What is the NC. gonna do? Take the region back and everything goes back to normal? This is hegemony war to fortify economical and supercapital superiority. And NC. isn't even trying to remain in the game.
---
The question is - can they/will they bother rebuilding?  
---
Seems to me that after the last war, when we glassed x47, that area didn't get rebuilt.  There might be a few things, but when I did a casual fly-through a week or so ago, it seemed pretty empty.  What will this area look like in 6 months - same emptiness?
---
That would be worse, allowing only one power to move between them. Fuck no ansiblexes in jspace.
---
Making wh constellations would allow for a larger space for a few people, like a super duper giant c6. You'd have to take gates to move through, so they're contestable. It's actually kinda interesting.
---
I mean, it's not incorrect...
---
best structure bash I've ever seen
---
holy shit that's great
---
Do you bitch about CODE. too?
---
Newbros don't get robbed, they watch the robbers drive off with their boss' stuff.
---
I made a character! I haven’t finished Aura’s tutorial and there’s so much to read and learn. But, I made a character!
---
That first battle was wicked confusing. Not sure what happened or how I survived. 
---
You seem friendly, can we keep talking?
---
My username is the same as my reddit username: romper_el_dia. And my character’s name is: Rocio Gabriele Montenegro.
---
So you screwed up some guys you shared two years with over virtually nothing at all, tainted your character's name (the most valuable thing in this game) and feel proud about it?
---
Not even bad, this is just lame and shows a deep lack of undertanding of what EVE is actually about.
---
We are all strangers over the internet, and without trust, loyalty and common work noone in this game would have achieved the milestones we did as a community. Great heists are a part of that aswell, and those imply a lot of planing and execution.
---
This is just a lowly theft, made by a kid that didn't even grasp what a true heist is.
---
The mining channel is mostly filled with cancer and trolling.
---
People cried that it wasn't fair for super heavy groups to have a print isk button. So CCP made is so you'd have to work for it.
---
The value of the moons is still there. Heck CCP even buffed our ability to mine it at the same time. Change Athanors to a more attacker friendly mechanic like the old stront system and I don't see any reasonable reason groups shouldn't be fighting over them, other than 'Effort".
---
That's fine dude nothing happened.Thing is I really like eve and as botting is one of the major problems right now, I really can't stand people doing it, not even to pay the bills.
---
So by this measure, Goons likely could have just done a smaller deployment and maintained a cap umbrella (maybe not the full cap umbrella, but enough).  Goons could have kept krabbing (although with maybe a small to moderate amount of increased deaths) while still glassing the northern region (although maybe at a slower pace).
---
You need to read again the conversation I think.
---
it's OVER 9000!!
---
I only dance ballets wearing my cape.
---
haha
---
There is hope for you my friend.
---
You mean C7s, because I am not proposing putting these in C6s. The C6 proposal is just giving standard null statics (3m) to them.
---
Just like you need 3-5 "rolling battleships" to roll classic 2/3m statics, you would need 3 "rolling carriers" to roll the wormholes I propose. It's not that insane in the age of proliferation.
---
&gt; If we get timezone tanking fixed on citadels
---
Yeah, that's basically what I'd be worried about. Assuming that's fixed, I'm all for it.
---
I would say a deep knowledge guy. I consider myself pretty community focused, but there are many more people who can claim that title better than I can. I think I have a pretty fundamental understanding of eve at its core, enough that I can leverage that to help give CCP solid feedback on its future.
---
Might explain why they have become so successful!
---
Thanks for the answer and that’s a good sounded solution, I’m a hunter but agree delayed local could be too OP. Got my vote on that and others ✌️
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
Once again, nice strawman. Try actually arguing my points instead of deflecting.
---
1) I see no problem with it except maybe there needs to be a few systems retained to maintain capital travel routes. Needs to be closely studied.
---
2) Works for me. I heard multiple other suggestions that works as well. Bottom line here is that combat ceptors need something to be viable again.
---
3) Frankly, the added expiration on mobile bubbles changed the ecosystem a bit that you no longer have too much of these systems with permabubbled gates. So that's one reason to care less. But I think people need some otherwise harmless ship to cruise around to go from point A to B in nullsec without dying. Not sure if yachts are enough. I'm not a fan of basing all ceptor changes on entosis warfare. That's just one way to play the game.
---
4) Wormholes. People like to say it's very hard to find mechanics that introduce diminishing returns to getting big, anti-n+1 mechanics, mechanics that defy Malcanis' law. Wormholes are a great example that's false.
---
5) I think there is a wide room of agreement between CSMs on big picture problems such as;
---
- Eve needs more explosions/PvP interaction
---
- Nullsec sov warfare needs attention
---
- Risk/reward mechanics need attention
---
- Botting needs attention
---
- Citadel mechanics need attention
---
And so on. If we agree on at least some of them, then I'll have the venue to propose my own perspective and specific ideas.
---
Exactly, and ideally not even just a visible dent, serious expenditure of resources. Make it an EVE-wide arms race, people trying to fire up their CSAAs as fast as possible to get it all back, and the subcap fights to prevent them.
---
But you said this:
---
&gt;  if the structures you're killing were that important to us, don't you think we'd defend them?
---
Inability to defend them doesn't imply you don't want them.
---
"What is sound balancing?"       
---
-OP
---
sounds alot like tribalwars or some clone :D good times
---
Dirt and Glitter has retris booze and worse music
---
I had a comment a few weeks back, that we should turn another game into EVE l. You've done it my friend.I am proud to be part of this community
---
If the table is just a copy of the spreadsheet we have maintained (I can't get the formatting to display properly), an evepraisal is from a recon scan and individual valuations are simply commented as such.  As for the one-sidedness that is simply the nature of **any** war related post since people don't generally post things unless it makes them look good.  Excluding something from the last war where someone posted a BR that was negative for them simply so that we wouldn't be the ones to post it, BRs are almost unilaterally posted by entity that benefits.
---
I feelsbadman for nc but the sweeties must be eaten!  muh-green-kill-boards!
---
Needs more upvotes.
---
i mean, hence why people like myself spend out karma posting anti goon stuff on thier shit, because its useless and only half the picture
---
to add this post isnt on the terms of a BR, showing loss of both sides.
---
I would highly recommend *not*  reading into how to play. I played as an alpha for about 6 months before upgrading. Run the starter missions until you get bored or see something you want to do. Take advantage of the sandbox aspect of the game. You can do literally anything you want.
---
Fair enough thanks for the reply. Good point about the capital routes in point 1 though I would say, as wormholes show, capitals don't have to be the main mobile force.
---
Agree completely about wormholes and defying n+1 situations. By far the healthiest place in the game.
---
And agree completely with your last additional points. Definitely need you on CSM imo
---
I feel you. What the fuck is this.
---
haha yea stupid fucking elite pvpers, didnt want those supers/rorquals anyway!! have fun with your "dank killmails" while we burn your whole house down!!!!
---
Haha, the gap isn't anywhere close to that big.
---
Well then, what I understand is that alliances will have to fight over regions for resources to accommodate the farms, expand umbrellas and get into conflict with neighbours or push them back, means more chances of conflicts. I like it. 
---
I'll vote for you.
---
That wasn't the point of using BRs as an example and you know it.
---
I'm in Horde and I endorse the comedic value of this propaganda. lol
---
Insert: \*Have you seen Delve\* or \*Have you seen High-sec\* comment here.
---
Ha ha!
---
sorry goons have 50k members, NCPL have 21k
---
what I want to know is why you think your version of this rejoinder is so much better than the 37 other ones that goons have already posted and had responded to that you think deserve your own individual answer
---
You were gonna burn it anyway.
---
same with all of their self created content like the last few rewinds that inevitably get downvoted into oblivion
---
&gt; The peak of Imperium gameplay is to recruit players and create an environment in which they can enjoy playing the game how they want without putting them in little boxes and telling them to ignore certain aspects of the game
---
The little box you put them in was the Imperium. If you really could do anything (you can't lol) then it would be a redundant step anyway.
---
Did I hit a nerve? Punctuation has nothing with the argument to do whatsoever, but sure feel free to try and derail the discussion. 
---
Have you run the stats? Or maybe just forgot that only a single fucking titan died in delve since 2017 pre goons deployment? And 3 new ones have died since then? 
---
Im sorry you cant take any criticism about your videogame space alliance, as is seen by your post history...
---
hey hey dont turn salty like the rest of goons. stay with me here, your actually ok in responses. showing intellegence.
---
im not calling out the BR selectively.
---
to furthermore enlighten, ANY war post on anyside that shows true picture of loss on both sides to compare. doesnt get any shit from me.
---
posts like this which are very much one sided and useless information until mixed with proof of facts and fair investigation given, get shit.
---
You have just shown that it appears Zero fucks are given
---
Where you've said we should have peaceful gameplay as well, remember this is eve. You are never 100% safe unless you are docked in a station. That's not a detrimental thing about the game it's the essence of it.
---
Its not elitism. It's the game. Yes cloaky camping is a silly mechanic but it works which is why people do it. If you want a safe place to play "peacefully" then high sec is the place to be
---
lets be honest. unless the person is playing classical music or ironic 007 sound system you should watch the video as eve should be played: completely silent.
---
The point in using BRs as an example was not to use them as an example of a one sided post in a vacuum.  The point is the selectivity of who posts which BRS was the point.  The information which one chooses to post vs not post is important.
---
sure sure, but why a single HML among the RLML's
---
The propaganda is so high that I feel I'll get shit on for simply pointing this out but..
---
Since when did we count krab losses outside of the war zone into the war tally? If a goon solo kills an NC member in dronelands, does that now also add to the butchers bill?
---
Nice heist, but 2 years and still not having 10bil, damn hisec.
---
I don't play but I kind of follow the memes. The fountain war if that one guys crowd funded autobiography, correct?
---
yes, and who pots isnt what matters, what matters is a BR shows facts (as good as it can) and is showing fair truth of loss from both sides.
---
this post however, even if KillahBee posted this himself. i would still be pissed off that its so one sided lol
---
who posted doesnt matter (its just always goons who post this one sided crap)
---
all other posts ive seen regarding this war have shown information of loss on both sides. except this one, showing only loss on one side.
---
*looks around nervously for shelter before Viserion arrives to burn a hole in this wall*
---
Thx, that was a great post !
---
A half decent EvE Player is John Wick or Jason Born in any other MMO.
---
Lol don’t bother trying to explain this concept to bees... it is above their pay grade
---
great, another bunch of supers to goons xD
---
Oh fantastic look another whine from poor distressed nerds who dont want to work for isk "for the good of the game"
---
&gt;14,000,605 to 1
---
google it real quick, im still in the habit of not spoiling those 2 movies...
---
1) You'll probably love heisting in triglavian invasion space
---
2) If you truly are as resourceful as you claimed to be then your paragraphing skill is clearly mismatched
---
Moving to Null was the best decision I ever made in EVE
---
You would have to burn tribute 15 times to cost them what they have made off renters. would be in excess of 21T
---
Very cool. What library are you using to plot?
---
man i think i would absolutely love to take a code cat fleet into a lowsec pipe and catch some dorks with a bait prophecy used to warp in some cats to 0 
---
just imagine hitting salty perma campers with a "calm down miner". betting at least one would say something permaban worthy.
---
&gt; People cried that it wasn't fair for super heavy groups to have a print isk button.
---
Please at least respond to the post. The nonsense behind this is pretty much the #1 thing I was trying to refute.
---
If you insist on being beaten over the head with a 101 course in rig production in order under to understand how this works....
---
1.  [Sotiyo Lossmail](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77111338/)
---
2. [Our recon scan of this structure](https://evepraisal.com/a/m7f7h), before the owners stripped the rigs off.
---
3. The stripped rigs were:
---
     * Standup XL-Set Ship Manufacturing Efficiency I
---
     * Standup XL-Set Equipment and Consumable Manufacturing  Efficieny I
---
     * Standup XL-Set Structure and Component Manufacturing Efficiency I       
---
4. Lets give you an absurd benefit of the doubt and stack the cost odds in your favor as much as I can. In order to do so, we'll assume:
---
     1.  We will build these rigs in nullsec
---
     2.  We will build them in a T2 rigged Sotiyo for rig building
---
     3.  We will build them in a system with a manufacturing cost index of 0
---
     4. We will build them with fully researched blueprints
---
5. All three of these rigs, take these T1 salvage to produce: 49,662,793,389.51 http://evepraisal.com/a/mifr4, each, and that's assuming you're buying them all from buy orders, slowly, over time to keep the price low.
---
6. The zkillboard lossmail valued the loss at 24,044,688,189.35. 
---
7. The zkillboard lossmail @ 24,044,688,189.35 + 49,662,793,389.51 + 49,662,793,389.51 + 49,662,793,389.51 = 173,033,068,357.88 billion isk. 
---
Now you can consider yourself educated about how this game we play, Eve Online, actually works instead of having everything you think you know in your peanut sized brain spoon fed to you by tools that you don't understand.
---
The Imperium is the big box with some in each of the columns amigo. All sorts and all types. The good and the bad. But no single "best and only way to play" which is a good type of community.
---
good thing killah bee isn't a leader of my alliance then, huh?
---
Ok maybe the wording about "who posts matters" wasn't worded particularly well.  In either case, this is just a raw dump of an internal tracking spreadsheet.  We're obviously not going to bother tracking everything in Delve since we don't care.  Just like NCDot is never going to bother tabulating these since they also don't care.
---
10/10 wish I could be there to watch M-O butn again! Was there for Co2’s turn and now...
---
Eee-yup. I've been teaching bort the wonders of small gang and it's been great for the amount of red on my kb lol.
---
thanks fam it's all good
---
let's just play eve okay?
---
that's just like, your opinion, man
---
qed i don't care
---
Two fucking years.
---
At what point does it change from a heist to just a shitty awox because you got bored.
---
8. isk amount shown on your list has changed, it did show 194billion.
---
 well done. now do the same for all the other poppy cock youve posted xD
---
&gt;So CCP made is so you'd have to work for it.
---
oh yes because taking and defending said moons is something automatic, lowsec says hi
---
I just exported the resulting df as a csv and I am using PowerBI (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) to manipulate the data and plot everything.
---
I find it easier for me to do some exploratory plotting that way, as my python skills are not that extended :D

---
Updated: Total value of everything destroyed, that we can account for: $859,265,005,334.71 isk
---
so. OP reclaculated for me, and has djusted the largest sotiyo lossmail from 194billion down to 173billion.
---
OP's calculations were out.
---
&gt;comparing a miner-suicide gank to the theft of all of someones assets and then saying 'it's okay because muh sandbox'
---
okay
---
&gt;Newbros don't get robbed, they watch the robbers drive off with their boss' stuff.
---
sure, every highsec CEO is a cutthroat and exploiter of newbros. Whatever makes you sleep at night.
---
maybe you could help him do the entire 'sample' instead of a chery picked one
---
i detect a lot of salt from "elitepvpers" XD
---
Hey look everyone this TEST guy gets it.
---
Ruin a few sections of the economy, make T2 ships and mods prices soar and make rich richer and poors poorer. It's not hard to imagine some group deciding they want a monopoly on some moon materials and siply refuse to sell it to anyone but allies while holding the majority of the supply. This can be done now, but with gated off market it becomes even easier.
---
I doubt "detecting" is within your paygrade.
---
Considering how volatile the salvage market is that doesn't surprise me.  Plus you're admitting that Tuzy recalculated it for you so I don't see your point.  At this point we're better off just agreeing to disagree since it's not going anywhere.
---
Tribal war indeed. The game was meh, but setting the whole surrounding area on fire was fun.
---
What.
---
I adjusted the blueprint calculator to give you as much of an advantage as I could, allowing you to produce the replacement rigs in the most ideal conditions possible and giving you the additional benefit of the doubt of allowing the salvage to buy bought from buy orders, and not sell orders And the structure was still valued at 173 billion isk instead of 193 billion isk.
---
And you cant to somehow claim that as a victory?
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Not everyone in TEST has a massive case of spodbrain. Too many of em do.
---
The goon sure seems to care about zkill with all these posts. You got so many options of stuff to harp on us for, but you cling to this old care about zkill meta that really only flew with 2011 aaa
---
I know sigs exist and are a cool thing. I've seen Space Violence, EG, Reavers and Freedom Squad do tons of cool shit, and even GSOL way back when were pretty impressive. You have to admit though that the folks playing a contributing role in those kinds of groups are a tiny minority in comparison to the average line member that basically just wants to derp around doing some mining and ratting here there, maybe join a fleet now and again, and is excited about the idea of a big war more than the reality of it. That's the playstyle the CFC/Imperium (less so INIT) have catered to for the better part of a decade.
---
Personally I don't see why you wouldn't prefer to just join a group that is fully focused and good at what it does.
---
So the movie 300 is bullshit? Dammit
---
Does this number still include the non-panfam structures in your list?
---
I fly rorquals. And i get tackled a lot of the time, since I'm neither test or goon, or any huge block. Those rorquals are hard to pay for themselves, what's your 15% ? Because I don't really earn money where I live.
---
Imagine being able to choose whether or not you want to mine or pvp for your income. Nah, shut it down. Get in the belts, nanotards.
---
&gt; You think the reason theres not much PVP going on is because nullbears don't make enough ISK? What planet do you live on?
---
No. You're totally misreading my pounts.
---
I want to increase risk in nullsec. If I get my way, it'll be increased to the degree that you'd want to increase reward adequately so nullseccers don't stop farming.
---
&gt; Also ganking rorqs isn't really fighting.
---
I didnt say whaling is necessarily "fighting". I said it was "content" which people play for. FWIW Whaling situations do create lots of "fights" though.
---
I myself have a bias against your prearranged wormhole fights. I like there being actual stakes. I don't make up my mind about game balance with my personal biases about different kinds of pvp though.
---
ik stfu reeee
---
You've made it abundantly clear. I believe you.
---
You're still a dumbass.
---
Most regions are empty, it's just not worth it to rebuild shit that's not getting used.
---
Doesnt talk about Bots, post is irrelevant
---
undefended structures don't count
---
lol. infact. where some have been saying your statement you posted here is factual. my argument is its all one sided.
---
with no real showing of both sides. or losses from both sides. to add to that, you made your post to be 'as much in the swing to Panfam as possable' and talking tous 'readers' that we know its not that case.
---
yet now your showing that infaqct it was not numbers shown best possable to be sided with panfam, but infact, the most possable a person could spend to purchase those rigs.
---
either or. this entire post is a waste of time, correct or not, it doesnt show anything but achievement on one side.
---
where is the loss from goons to make this a high quality post. its just propaganda, thats fucking boring that i will comment against.
---
use your amazing skill with numbers and figure out the total loss on both sides, including true ship value cost on every mail, every structure, how much rental Panfam lost, and how much tax loss goons have had. with all capital losses included in delve and goonswarm homes. then include the fuel usage for goons to get where they are. and continue this attack.
---
then, we are talking.
---
Well. PanFam dudes keep telling me I have bad killboard stats, as if that's supposed to hurt me somehow. So sure seems to be something they care about.
---
The tears added in the end were just spot on.
---
i "detected" a pl fortizar dying yesterday you stupid pubbie lmao
---
ok
---
Sometimes you have friends that have different play styles and you want to have it all under one roof.
---
It includes anything we've killed within Tribute that was a structure and some other panfam structures we killed in pure blind, lowsec, etc.
---
My CSM bid is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_pSzzvWytG2142bx7O8WKGA84TcOiAoSwIPGlbGzN6g/edit).
---
"Anomaly Rework" and "Mobile Cyno Inhibation Rework" are proposals designed to counter umbrellas. "New Local Delayed Ship Class" is designed to change local a bit so at least bots are vulnerable.

Can you elucidate exactly how you think the situation would be different if passive goo returned, assuming that snuff would still be a part of the picture? 
---
Do you think snuff would somehow be less oppressive in that scenario?  Or would it be that the big nullblocs would take all the good moons again, leaving snuff relatively worse off compared to their losec rivals?
---
...he says as a bean
---
goons currently are the biggest mineral producers in the game (by a decent afaik) allowing them to restrict selling to other players would probably be bad for the game.
---
No that referred to Goons, possibly putting me in last position.
---
I'm higher on Horde's ballot.
---
Game of thrones: conquest?
---
As the person who knows exactly how many titans we have because I've ran queries in our SQL database that stores all of our ESI information, I can tell you the "1300" number dscan was fake.
---
1. The number is wrong
---
2. Our various move ops happened at different times over 2-3 days. At no point was that amount of titans in space at the same time where a dscan could have been made of them to achieve that number. 
---
I have no idea who made that dscan, but I can tell you that anyone that touts those numbers as being the truth are a naive rube.
---
minerals and razor margins would be fucked while everyone would just keep 1 isking each other instead of .01 isking.
---
You contradicted yourself in 2 different comment chains - no one that I saw pointed that out. You can evade this point if you like, but you're still arguing against yourself, friend!
---
Ok I misinterpreted what you were saying then.
---
I still disagree though for a different reason, at least on the increasing reward thing. Every negative change to null always seems to be sold on a "but" that makes it okay. We're taking away outposts and giving you destructible citadels _but_ there will be asset safety. I listened to people for years talk about how there was no value in null sec stations, yet for a decade people quite happily called them home. Now we're at a point where an 800m unfueled Citadel takes longer to kill/flip than a 30B outpost _and_ has asset safety, yet it's not fair to suggest making them easier to kill. I know this isn't necessarily your point or even something you disagree with, but it's a clear example of the overton window shifting.
---
If you think something needs to be nerfed/buffed I'd just come out and say that rather than trying to bargain with people who'll be hurt by it. Most of them are going to complain no matter where you draw the line.
---
&gt; I myself have a bias against your prearranged wormhole fights. I like there being actual stakes.
---
Funnily enough I left WH space. I'm in Snuff now.
---
I think what I failed to articulate before is that I don't disagree nullsec should be more risky, I'm just not sure it's quite so far out of whack on the harassment front. You're playing on nightmare mode in Delve trying to harass literally the strongest entity that his ever existed in the history of EVE Online right in their front yard. I think if you spent some time applying the same sort of pressure to other groups you'd be shocked at how easily the fold.
---
I agree Rorqual scalability is huge. So is the scalability of VNI bots. And only constant respawns null can support them.
---
I take that and other factors (afkability, ease, safety) into account.
---
I pretty much mention reward increase just as a compromise with nullseccers, so at least we can argue that "with increased risk you'll also get increased reward, which means your current isk/hr won't reduce". At the end of the day we'd have to negotiate with them to get anything done.
---
This was a great read OP.  Welcome back to the S U C C.
---
Give me a grouping of 8 alliances or corps in any configuration (1v7, 2v6, etc), and I'll run it through then.  I'm not familiar with what's going down in Delve.
---
Come on dude, you can't really be saying that FedUp/Fweddit structures in Pure Blind are panfam structures...
---
Obligatory, "But eve is Dying"
---
Ah now i see what salt you detected lmao.
---
I guess they dont want to fight your blob and just want some fun instead? Space is meaningless
---
got him!
---
dont your industrialists actually BENEFIT from losing stuff in delve, you have such a cache of minerals that need to be sold via caps/supers.
---
So really, NC and PL and Olfeca Silver are helping
---
Many of the changes I argue for are actually against my interests. We got 300 cloaky campers, I argue 1 person should have 1 CSM vote. I steal drones from regions heavily condensed with Rorquals, I argue to make them less condense.
---
For 10 years empire builder CSMs buffed their preferred playstyle. It turned out to be damaging the game's ecosystem for anyone who's not a Rorqual miner. I want to balance it back a bit.
---
Out of curiousity, did you get any higher roles after your little.. incident? ;D
---
oooh sharp. Did my flair give me away?
---
God, please do. Skillfarming is rotting out this game fast.
---
Didn't want that region anyways ;p
---
He said funny not fun
---
I did? Which one. I might have made a legit mistake and valued a t1 rig instead of t2?
---
which corp
---
Nothing is wrong worth you. You are acting as intended. There is nothing to see here.
---
What game? The one you just lost?
---
15 years of cultivated autism in new eden unleashed upon another world. Other world dies.
---
Honest question: is your character's name worth anything in eve, considering theres injectors, easy alts, and all that?  
---
I mean, sure, you got some "high profile" people, that would quickly get recognized, but some average joe, heisting 20b off some carebear corp?
---
&gt; Since your representatives
---
This is *exactly* what I'm talking about. As a member of the CSM *you* are my representative. How are *you* going to represent me on the CSM? 
---
&gt; First you (Goons) said noone wanted to work with me. We got more than 10 entities cooperating together to kill stuff in your space.
---
I am not 'goons'. You're posting exactly what worries me about your being a CSM. You're attacking me for the narrative of some null politics garbage that I'm not even a part of. I'm here asking you what you have to offer as an elected representative of *me* to CCP and you've gone and built an entire goon straw man around me and attacked it (While also complaining about logical fallacies see: communication issues). 
---
Do you not see the issue here? As a CSM member you would have to be *above* null politics and instead advocate for the state of the game. I asked how you would pull your head out of propaganda and represent us in a business professional manner and you replied with propaganda.
---
Yeah they are. Also Fweddit has no affiliation with panfam as far as I know, and I'm not sure if Tri losses in Pure Blind really count either. Are Tri officially helping panfam in this war?
---
And there's a few more POSes and an astrahus that definitely aren't affiliated with panfam.
---
Bruh you got my vote!!!!! :)
---
Looks like we found one of your ex-corpmates.  I for one enjoyed the story.
---
do you lick microphones
---
Honestly, I'm not sure I'm not confusing missing the old pre-Dominion  POS stick gameplay model, with moon goo being "better".  
---
I do remember fights being more "engaging" (read: shorter) that one guy in a citadel wrecking my shit.  I remember there actually being fights on something other than the final timer, even if it was sitting in a Chimera repping the shield timer.  
---
It was almost certainly more oppressive but, honestly, anything valuable will always be taken by someone strong enough to take it.  The only thing I think would change is you can't cyno 12 jumps in five minutes to defend any more; you by default can't be the 'passive' Pandemic Legion of old.
---
Fraternity
---
Cool if thats where the goalposts are now then we didn't lose a keepstar at UALX either, lol.
---
First one of these that made me chuckle. Have my fucking upvote.
---
The issue is you won't achieve much. There are actually lots and lots of people doing DED's in Delve. But you won't be able to hunt and drop blops there. There are so many people that you'll attract attention and die.
---
Serious question - what did you end up doing wtih all that isk? If I fell into that much one day, I don't think I'd know where to start spending it.  Do you just start buying AT ships? Market manipulation? Genuinely curious, if you don't mind sharing.
---
I mean, you can argue we shouldn't, but as I understand it, a goon solo killing an NC member in the dronelands would absolutely count in those numbers.
---
Rigs are all salvage. Salvage is light-weight and easy to move. There is virtually no difference in price between Jita &amp; Delve when it comes to salvage. I wish I could mine salvage with my Rorq, but alas...
---
OH MY GOD.  
---
That dude is a fucking joke. Getting a 1v1 out of him is gonna be hard, considering that he brings alts even for single ships :-)
---
Why are you so angry about this?  It's stories like this that made me want to play Eve in the first place.  If you don't like the thefts/spying, don't do it, but this is Eve and those are part of the allure.
---
We have atleast two posts per week from olmeca alone bragging about killing drones...
---
Goons shot rocks for *years* to earn the right to shoot undefended buildings and whelp fleets every time they are engaged.  If this is what victory looks like I'd be happy to be on the 'losing' side.
---
Home losses + whelped fleets have goons down like 3:1 in assets destroyed this conflict.  "Winning".
---
We lost 1 I-HUB in Delve and one Stargate that I had to replace. The Stargate was ~ 1.5 billion isk and the I-Hub had a beacon upgrade, ratting 5, mining 5, and the hull itself so...about 1.9 billion isk.
---
Therefore we've lost 3.4 billion isk in structures.
---
OH I almost forgot. We tried to drop a blocking jammer in a system in Tribute that we lost that was ~ 1.3b. So....
---
4.7 billion isk losses for The Imperium.
---
There ya go. I gave you what you asked for.
---
Even through all your grandstanding, there remains very few, if any, who actually care.
---
lol. nice try
---
100mn is a battleship sized afterburner. If you're trying to dual-prop, you (probably?) want to have a 50mn and a *10mn* instead. This will give you much more fitting room. I'm not sure I'd dual-prop a Gnosis though. Even with the afterburner, you're not getting away from much that scrams you due to your low base speed.
---
No, your post history.
---
Should've gotten a better one then smh
---
I enjoyed downvoting him
---
Cool thanks for sharing
---
The last two items of your three item list where largely an unnecessary waste of time.
---
this was great haha have my upvote!
---
Then you must have seen that i'm a good bean and never "detected" anything. Just like i should. See, i'm trying to be a good example for these goons stepping out of line.
---
Ive been wanting to run a dual prop cynabal but the price range is a bit high for me. Can you recommend a cheaper ship to practive dual prop with? Preferably minmatar.
---
It's also important to note that MMORPGs were far more popular 9 years ago than they are now, with most new players liking instant gratification and action and most older players settling down with families.
---
I'm sorry that reality doesn't conform with the delusions in your head.
---
While I'm not disagreeing that the game really needs updates, balance-centric changes like 'fix citadels' are a design problem. There's not a clear right-answer to the question, if they swing it too far in the wrong direction, we could be in a worse situation than we're in now. 
---
Getting 64-bit client is a development problem. There's a clear direction for the devs to go in.   
---
The stuff we're usually complaining about is much, much harder to fix, so I'm not shocked that CCP hasn't made a balance-pass yet.
---
I think so, serious corps will do a background check before giving important roles to anyone, and being trust worthy is a great asset to have if you wanna be anything else other that a F1 monkey.
---
People trusting you (or even becoming your friends) will open more doors to you than you can imagine. 
---
Just as an example, I have had people I befriended playing EVE give me ships or isk as gifts, helped me achieve my in game goals, invited me to join important corps (as in "well known with good rep") in all sides of the political spectrum, give me advice, tips or access to tools you don't share with everyone and so on.
---
Of course, if you just want to play "solo in the middle of a multitude" and just mine/rat all day, press F1 in fleets and just do your own thing, having a good or bad reputation probably won't matter.
---
I once killed a Wingspan member when a few of us were bashing a POCO in a C1. No idea why he landed on us at zero. We were fully polarized and destroyed him quickly. 
---
That's when I researched Wingspan and found the videos. I'm still tempted to join. That kind of gameplay amuses me a great deal.
---
Don't forget RvB, They used to do NoobShip (now corvettes) roams with civilian guns.
---
mlyp
---
&gt; It's stories like this that made me want to play Eve in the first place.
---
No clue why you'd willfully subject yourself to that. Let's hope your CEO is not the kind of person you're trying to defend. 
---
&gt;Why are you so angry about this?
---
Eves playerbase get's more and more divided between the experienced bittervets and the newbros. And of course the bittervets will fuck over newbros if they want to, but EVE needs new players. Right now eve is floating because every bittervet has like 10 alt-accounts.
---
This isn't a heist.  This is just someone who chose a boring path in the game, got bored on that boring path, and turned shitty to people who had until that point given him exactly what he had asked for from them.
---
The problems of eve don't lie in the game itself. They lie in the player base that, as a whole, grew up in an Era of empires.
---
Associating to form a large group is the most efficient way to play because you can specialize your people so they can do what they want, you can protect yourself, you can provide all the goods of the game. The only reason for people to not join a large coalition is for the challenge.
---
And once a handful of coalitions own the game, no fight will happen, because everyone's interest is better served with peace.
---
The next step would be organized pvp between coalitions, so there is no more stakes in the battles. Players would have achieved victory over ccp by turning their game into something else.
---
Ccp would need to find what break societies and how to hand it to players so that the game can stay in a feudal state. And somehow that would go against the will of most players. Because in this state their position would be far more fragile. There would simply be to much risk when playing. Even for eve players.
---
The equation will be hard to solve.
---
I flew with you in BB. I've always seen you as an open minded person and pvp explorer. You have my vote.
---
Yeah I don't know what this guy was doing with the graph but FEDUP and Fweddit shouldn't be on there since they're not involved in the war. Yes the losses are minimal when you negate those structures but I would prefer factual info instead of pushing something like that out that doesn't consider politics into it.
---
Minor Conduits ? You mean Invasions are stepping up ?
---
k
---
10/10 well played
---
But you can't because that would be way too much of an increase percentage wise. Meaning you'd have tons of orders for 3 or 4 isk, all the same, meaning market bots doing the 0.01 isk shuffle don't work anymore.
---
Boo hoo.
---
I'll let our recon guys know that their recon scans are "historically untrustworthy". Our FCs should probably be told to so we can pack up and go home if all of this data we have on enemy infrastructure is all a lie.
---
The Tribalwar forum invading Tribalwars and forcing the devs to change the ruleset was good times.
---
still don't care what you think
---
daaaaamn
---
So good, and so real :D Take my upvote
---
i don't know that i have my guy
---
&gt; This is exactly what I'm talking about. As a member of the CSM you are my representative. How are you going to represent me on the CSM?
---
I don't think I'll represent you. It's a very American Republican kind of thinking that all representatives represent everyone. It's a rather twisted way of thinking about democracy. Things don't work that way, because the interests of people diverge. There is only one way a representative can vote. 
---
I'll represent many ideas which won't converge with your Eve views. I'll represent people whose ideas won't converge with your Eve views. That's exactly the reason why representative bodies need to be diverse. You won't agree with these, but it doesn't matter for me.
---
If you agree with my ideas, then vote for me and I'll represent them. If you don't, then don't vote for me and I won't represent your side of things.
---
&gt; I am not 'goons'. I am me.
---
I'm not randomly making my inferences. You are one of the main creators and echoers of the toxic content that's going on in your echo chamber. As far as our past interactions go it's rational for me to believe that you do endorse those 3 statements that I referred. If you disagree with them you can say so. If you don't, then I don't have time for your metagaming BS.
---
&gt; above null politics
---
I've always been above null politics. All I did was killing ships. Arguing balance. Arguing against bots. Correcting Goons when they said they had no bots. Goons are the ones who pull me into politics. That's because your alliance utilizes punching bag personalities to direct hate. It uses this to create cohesion and unite members. INN literally functions like Fox News. 
---
Again, all this doesn't mean I'm gonna be a CSM to destroy Goons. Should I ever get elected, I'm sure your alliance will create a narrative that I do so. I'll do my best to fight it. I just want a balanced game. All my proposals are about that. And many people seem to agree.
---
but why?
---
Too bad we aren't using titans on them. I'd have way more killmails. Instead peasants in subcaps get them all
---
Fini
---
The problem is really that there is no counter to mass supercaps. Battleships shpuld be the counter.
---
Also large alliances need more small targets and infrastructure to hit.
---
Don't you have this anymore? This sounds too awesome to drop it tbh
---
So it would have been more honourable if I’d set out to rip them off from the beginning?
---
Don't forget to clean guild bank when leaving
---
tbh i assume like 1 -2 constellations in drone lands in order to safely build supercap/titans
---
Oh yeah, rvb is good
---
Well it unirionically is just slowly
---
Oh I know. I didn't mean to imply that TEST didn't as a whole. Just pointing out someone who gets it who isn't a Goon.
---
They are hostile to us, therefore they are the enemy and must burn.
---
PL and Co are all a bunch of sad shits.
---
There really isn't any more, or less to it. 
---
Enjoy Low and High-Sec.
---
LOL. Oh god no, TEST spodbrains almost as hard as goons most of the time. We're improving tho.
---
Goons aren't *that* dumb
---
&gt;some other panfam structures we killed in pure blind
---
Everyone who isn't blue(tral) to you is Panfam? Ok, that makes sense now.
---
You’re post makes me want to play Eve again. I started in 2003 but I’ve been gone for about 8-9 years. For some reason I’ve recently gotten the itch back. It’s come and gone over the years. Eve never really leaves a person I think once they are really into it. 
---
I got back into my old account recently when I learned that Eve now had a free to play aspect. However I have no idea where to start. I found myself sitting in a station at one of our old corporate bases.The Corp now being disbanded for nearly 10 years. What do I do? Where do I go? I guess the good thing about eve is wherever you want.
---
Hell, I already stole an entire guild along with the fully upgraded guild city.
---
Guild leader didn't show up for 180 days, so I petitioned the GM's to take control of the guild.  The GM's made me the guild owner, I booted everyone but my characters at 3 am one day when no one was logged on, changed guild names and looted the coffers.  
---
Made out like a bandit on that one.  Won't need gold again for a long time, that's for sure.
---
Quite an epic tale, maybe I should try subbing on eve
---
If it is bugged you can petition it and a gm should fix it for you, if you file a stuck petition they're usually pretty good at getting it clear pretty quickly
---
The problem with your dscan flex is we never moved 1300 titans or had 1300 titans undocked at once so....
---
True joy can only be found in ~wulfpax~
---
This is why the internet was made!
---
Top kek
---
I included them because their structures died within the timeframe of  when the war began and they were killed by INIT, as I assumed since a member of The Imperium was shooting them, that they were hostile to us.
---
Is this not the case?
---
All the goons seething in thread about NC not feeding into them smh
---
"We were going to lose anyway, why try?" must be great for morale.
---
Who is talking about honor? I'm saying you chose to play a video game in a shity way, turned shit to people who were helping you, then came here to try and brag about a petty theft.
---
I think it was a jab at the fact that Snuffed Out was founded with the sole purpose of challenging  Shadow Cartel.  Now that Shadow Cartel is dead, Snuffed Out no longer has it's original purpose and should therefore disband.
---
You mistyped  Jebi's name, comrade. Should be "Jebi Vjetar".
---
P.S. Here is a heart symbol for you &lt;3
---
honestly would have been better without hell march
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Maybe you should run for CSM?
---
Wow. Just....wow.
---
What warzone? It's not a war if nobody is defending.Atleast in Delve there are fights
---
What would have been better is if you picked a mark worth hitting. Having that kind of rep attached to your name isn't worth a measly 10b.
---
You shouldn't give your username to people, it's only used for login ;). Feel free to dm me if you have any questions.
---
No. If you look FEDUP is associated with TAPI/TEST and fweddit is their own LS alliance. Please check these before you make posts like this. Skews some of the numbers. And as we all know politics in eve matter to alot of people. Just next time fact check before hand. Otherwise well formatted post
---
The corresponding Freighter skills used to not require Advanced Spaceship Command and the ships themselves required only level 1.  So as to not remove the ability to fly a ship from existing pilots, they left the ability to fly the ships at level 1.
---
Believe this has happened a few other places as well, they generally try to avoid ever removing your ability to fly a ship that you could in the past when they make changes to the skill tree, so you end up with these slightly odd requirements.
---
So... you want Invasions to spawn FW sites in High-Sec?
---
That aside, Invasions *need* to hit all of New Eden. They need to wreck *everyone*, *especially* the Null blocs.
---
NC. deserve some credit tho for the following:
---
\- The one sadling that actually stays in station launching bombs.
---
\- The couple of fuckboys showing up in interceptors just to shittalk local and get smartbombed (incl. 3.5 bil Pod).
---
Again, I never picked a mark, I just saw an opportunity and took it. Reputation means nothing now that I can extract everything from this character and inject into an alt if I have to.
---
Some ships can draw vs it
---
Well when even *Hilmar* acknowledges it...
---
Yeah, it’s a game, so what? It’s not like I cheated. An opportunity arose and I took it.
---
He said 10b was 100x more than he ever had before stealing.  In two years, dude hadn't made 100m.  
---
That's not a highsec problem.  That's a shitshow player.
---
Bronze, it is Olmeca Bronze.
---
a big shit story.
---
Again, you missed the point.
---
Goons have spent the better part of the last decade actively trying to change facts and hammering half truths and narratives to their linemembers.
---
So colour the rest of us skeptical if we don't take your supposed 'scans' at face value lmao.
---
It's funnier that you feel the need to justify them. One second we're the ones worried about saving face and obsessing over killboards, and you only care about the infrastructure you have gutted. The next minute you're bandying about figures in a desperate plea to justify that you have, actually, inflicted more loss than you have taken.
---
Which is it then? Do you care about the ISK war that you spend so much time maligning? Or do you only care about the end objective at any cost narrative, in which case, what the fuck is the point of your post, other than some kind of circlejerk memorial?
---
At least when the entire game blobbed us out of the North we had the common decency to hang around and at least pretend to fight back for a couple of months.
---
Also, we don't want their space. We just want to destroy everything *in* their space.
---
That video is fucking great
---
Eve corrupts everything it touches. We are all worse people for having been exposed to it.
---
The UN needs to set up a quarantine before it's too late.
---
Notice how quickly NCPL went from blobbing supers on every conflict for a decade to "we only want gudfights" as soon as they lose their titan supremacy.
---
&gt;I never picked a mark, I just saw an opportunity and took it.
---
This process is called picking a mark. You picked it because it was easily accessible right now. 
---
&gt;Reputation means nothing now that I can extract everything from this character and inject into an alt if I have to.
---
Dude sick you made just enough isk to extract and inject a new character! Eventually people will recognize you from out of game signals. Especially if you start getting into alliance level stuff with SSO and forums external voice programs and such. It's not so easy to disappear on the internet as you claim it to be just because you can change your name.
---
If the players are incompatible with the game CCP should clearly seek new markets.
---
I heard cats don't really like to blob, the game should be renamed "Luna Online" and the interface changed to not require thumbs. Small brains won't be a problem, that has been implemented already.
---
Hope dies last. (But eventually it dies)

I mean, we still organized playing other games together but a stink was raised do to it pulling a lot of attention away from taking care of serious spaceship business. It wasn't like an official called action or group, people just happened to start pinging discord or jabber to organize playing other games together and it hit a peak where 150 members would be logged in playing another game together when a critical stratop was happening, and only 60 people are in fleet. 
---
On the flip side it's part of why I love being in TEST as a whole, the "culture" makes it real easy to do shit outside of Eve together.
---
Jokes on us, he sold the title to the car to his granny 5 minutes earlier.
---
That is some horrible math skills you have there.
---
Oh so then you are just another random idiot like myself running off at the mouth about things you know nothing about. Good to know we have clarified that.
---
Pretty much this. If you’re a self sustaining player you really don’t need to depend on mega alliances. But there’s an abundance of players that wouldn’t know how to make a living without the infrastructure and super umbrella. 
---
Some are self sustaining and just enjoy the mega alliance life style. It is a sandbox after all...
---
Dude I've been watching wooly for like two years now. Seeing him on the up and up in the eve community more is really nice. he's just a genuine dude who likes laughing and shaving his beard(when he makes dumb bets) ;)
---
Again, nobody is talking about cheating.  I'm saying you were playing badly, blamed others for your shit play, acted shitty, stole a petty cash box, then came here to try and convince people to congratulate you for that.
---
Yes, I'm pissing on you, but it's a kindness.  Your life is clearly on fire if this shit is what you celebrate about yourself.
---
Not sure if related, but we have had a lot of issues with our FCs disconnecting recently, like since the last patch.  At least one of them said that he is still running the 32bit client. Not sure about the others.  The latest one that I can think of, the FC said, "take this warp," no warp command came for us, then he disappeared from my watch list and was DC.
---
Using $ for isk values REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
There are rumors that you are on inits ballot. Is that true and are you on the top there too?
---
i can get behind some of that, especially the 90 day inactive i guess, tho still having the button to trigger it cause you are abandonning a forward staging post takes out the risk of hauling assets out that used to be the only option.
---
still, id be fine with that compromise if ccp implemented it!
---
Yeah piss away, it’s what I deserve, I’ve never claimed to be a nice person. Just thought I’d share this story.
---
That’s ok we’ve already learned how useless csm is so why even campaign?
---
Tri hasn't really shown up for anything that said they did just get handed new space in etherium reach so take it as you will
---
You forget one thing.That this is a game and we play it to have fun.Now I don't know how fun is to grind defenceless structures all day, but hunting krabs in Delve is very entertaining
---
Especially anything having to do with The Agency.
---
I'm not sure to understand your post. It just seems like you are proud to make a robbery.
---
Basically are you saying "yep, i've screwed some people, sold stuff they have make effort to gain, then disapear with the money" ?
---
Hi not sure to understand your post. it just seems like you are proud to make a robbery.

100mn on a cruiser is a common fit for so called nano fits. You usually don't fit a mwd with it because the 100mn gives you enough speed. It's hard to manouver tho and you need to manually pilot because hitting orbit or keep at range will certainly kill you or lose your target. 
---
Also don't expect to be able to do a close orbit. But if you fly well, it's great and rewards your skill as a pilot immensely.
---
no
---
ccp have buffed defense and removed content providers and the incentives that surround them. it is harder than ever to provoke a fight. it's not the player's fault that citadels take 9 days to kill and only die at 4am on a Wednesday
---
I did read it. Twice just to be sure.
---
From the outside looking in it just seems like these old PVP groups didn't care to adapt to a more balanced logistical/pvp group format.
---
This part stands out to me. 
---
"If we seek proof of the lack of engagement in this mechanic with the players it was specifically targetted at, I need only point at the dramatic price increases across the board on T2 products. Many nearly doubled in price in the months following the patch and none have recovered."
---
So the value in the moon is there, just no one seems to care to go get it. Even with all the more powerful mining options.
---
I've played for 12 years and this reeks of the old "Where is my content?" "Well bash their pos" "I hate pos bashing, it's boring" excuse making. 
---
But this is EVE the space ship corporate warfare simulator, and you have to force people to fight.
---
Lets just assume that they make citadels or at least the Athanors more attacker friendly. Via a stront system or some other way to mitigate timezone tanking. Then what is the excuse for low-sec groups other than they can't be bothered to support a mining group(Which is currently being multiboxed by solo guys all over EVE)
---
One more attacker friendly balance pass on Citadel reinforcement mechanics and I think you have more than enough options to create content. 
---
Something that has yet to be mentioned. Is the proliferation of Battle Royal genre at the same time CCP made sweeping changes to mechanics. EVE always had the advantage of PVP like no other, random, unpredictable. 
---
I think some of that has been lost in the BR offerings. I know dozens and dozens of EVE players that have fully moved on from EVE because they can get that thrilling pvp feeling of the unexpected in other games now. Without all the "2nd job" feeling.
---
Can you please not? Just go bot like the rest of calmil.
---
&gt; enjoy playing the game how they want 
---
Well, except the PVPers who'll suddenly realize that no one wants to fight them. Or literally any playstyle at all when no PVP leads to the inevitable extinction of all styles of play in eve.
---
I love you Kommandah Tooni!
---
Goons are keeping track of the blood for the blood God's internally, last time I looked it was over 1 trillion.
---
The question though is does this matter to them? The lost Titans and supers didn't go to war, probably didn't go last war and probably wouldn't the next war. Hell, decent chance they don't help with home defense either. If they don't matter in regards to a fight why care about their loss?
---
I was looking at it in perspective of other things you want introduced - mainly reduced player density in null. And with that I'm considering more of a shift to DEDs (with potential re balance) from anoms for income, mainly due to their much worse horizontal scaling (scale income with amount of alts) and much better vertical scaling (scale income with isk/sp investment for player).
---
&gt;Corporation is specialized in mining/indy with a little pvp
---
it's a trap
---
That wouldn't have changed anyway when we are talking about people that only wanted to helicopter dick their supers until they didn't have the numbers advantage and then docked up for good. So.. what's different?
---
Bad bot
---
It’s just a story about something that happened. What’s to get?
---
You keep trying to turn this into something it's not. I never talked about nice or mean. I'm saying this is lame, petty, tiny, insignificant, pointless, dumb bullshit.
---
I don't have smaller words to say this.
---
You came here to try and brag that you spent two years trying to convince a someone they could trust you, then took their pocket money. And now think it's a story you should share.
---
This weird roleplay thing you keep trying to do about morality is just fucking creepy on top of everything else.
---
There will never be an incentive to not just have red vs blue in eve. It always has been this way in null and will never change. Obviously it took a while to get to the level it’s at, but even with a split it will just be remade under a new name as always. There used to be a gap in sp and capitals which allowed for smaller orgs to spearhead larger ones, but that was worked around with capital proliferation, injectors, rorqual retardation, and imo t2 production being fucked into costing 2x more (and legitimately making t3 almost cheaper than t2, made obvious with commandships)
---
Nomads? Ya'll been living in the same fucking space for damn near a decade. Goons require pvp fleet participation and that ultimately eliminates botters. Your kind harboured them since eternity and now you're building yourself up to buy the bullshit. We will hit your useless fucking ihubs, tear down all of your citadels and we'll watch you run into hiding and wait out our return to Delve. What we've "lost" back there so far is barely TWO DAYS of Delve krab time. Whereas we've already taken out years of your poor defenseless and passive rental krabs.
---
I like your scorched earth policy.
---
Have trigs deplete all the belts and moons before moving on. (I would like to see this in Null also.
---
I mean I don’t know if you read the story, I actually set out to try and be a miner, I was genuine at the beginning. Got bored and decided to have fun by ducking them over. 
---
I’m agreeing with you on the petty tiny dumb etc, I just don’t care, I had fun that’s all I care about.
---
You seem upset about how other people are enjoying the game friend.
---
You ok?
---
Encouraged Even.
---
Translation: OP is salty they got mutually killed by the timer due to a blingy hac being able to tank them indefinitely.
---
&gt; Every negative change to null always seems to be sold on a "but" that makes it okay.
---
I feel like we got a convincing point only if we ensure nullseccers that increased risk in null will be coupled with increased reward, and their net isk/hr won't change. Remember these people experienced nerf after nerf to their yield and bounties, as that's been CCP's typical response to null overfarming. Instead, it should have been increasing the risk.
---
But hey. I got perhaps 10 ideas on my list. I'll be extremely lucky if I get 1 of them inside the game. If I do get one, I won't suddenly start arguing we should buff bounties. Most of these points are merely talking about what my ideal Eve would look like.
---
&gt; Funnily enough I left WH space. I'm in Snuff now.
---
You should come down Delve. We got lots of Snuff helping us here.
---
&gt; Delve trying to harass literally the strongest entity that his ever existed in the history of EVE Online right in their front yard. I think if you spent some time applying the same sort of pressure to almost any other other group you'd be shocked at how easily they fold.
---
I actually collect data on these things. For example, 5% of all mining in Eve converts to mining ship killmails. In umbrella regions it's about 3%. 
---
There are many factors that go in safety of a region. The umbrella strength is one. But "irrelevance tanking" is one as well. If there are less people and targets in a system, there will be less people hunting it. That's something many regions enjoy too. It's a healthy mechanic. But provides safety to some smalltime regions. If "irrelevance tank" wasn't a factor, then umbrella regions would have a risk much below 3%.
---
We talk in these abstract terms of risk/reward it might look to you like I fail to see smalltime regions have it harder. I can understand why you feel like that from my abstract talk. While talking like that, I have to ignore nuance differences that you might be sensitive about. But if you look at my proposals, almost all of them are designed to bridge the safety gap between regions like Delve and small regions a little. Mobile inhib revamp is one. Anom rework is one. FAX diminishing returns was awesome in that manner. Etc. So I just want to ensure you I'm not insensitive to safety differences in different regions.
---

Meh it’s a game, so what, not like it matters 😂
---
I SOLD MY HOUSE FOR THAT IKUTURSA
---
Might be, might be not /shrugs
---
I have 0 idea.
---
I remember a time when there was 5 active coalitions relatively equal power.
---
The game never recovered from 3 of them ganging up on 1.
---
We've *never* cared about killboards or ISK ratio. The Goon strategy has always been to blot out the sun with wrecks until the objective is met.
---
Guess what the MWD is dead, Long live MDJ, fit it on all your comps and stop crying.
---
I can also steamroll anyone in eve if i outnumber them 3:1 in titans.
---
I know because I did exactly that for some 8 years after titans was added to the game.  v0v
---
I'm going to come back to this thread in two years, edit this post to say something that isn't allowed on this sub, then post my epic heist story. 
---
Some people apparently think that's fun and have such tiny, petty, pointless goals in their hobby that something like that is worth caring about.
---
!RemindMe 2 years
---
Lmao.
---
*My internet spaceship computer game title makes me a voice of authority*
---
Does this mean smaller groups will move into the torched North?
---
I'm not opposed to all of new eden getting hit.  I think that null at least should have severely reduced rewards for doing the sites.  Make null fight them to save their space, not farm them for income.  Lowsec spawns would probably just get ignored.
---
My thinking with hisec though was to put enough reward in to offset losses and make them lucrative to hisec bears, but also put them in a position where pvp was going to happen.  Competing fleets where only one could get paid out for the site, krab fight for money.  
---
The high hisec rewards would only really work if null was nerfed to the point it was a chore they wanted to get done asap in order to get back to normal life,  otherwise null spawns would be an uncontested krab party.
---
If Frat is NCPL then Legacy is goons.
---
Still 3:1.
---
Such is life in eve, if i outnumber someone 3:1 I would also steamroll everyone.
---
But I am no interested in finding 70k new space friends.

Also you obviously don't give a fuck about your renter's space either. That's cool, they can move to our neighborhood once we're done burning down yours. We even fix the plumbing and the AC in a timely manner when it breaks.
---
You say that first part like it's a bad thing
---
Alright I'll remove them. Its just a token amount of structures so doesn't really matter in the end.
---
Didn't want those structures anyway
---
I'm not part of any big group like test or goons. How am I supposed to be 100% safe

I don't know dude l, I agree people all just hang up but last time the server was west Vs east CCP introduced JF making everyone abandon space
---
You've seized their means of reproduction it seems
---
TL:DR - things are so bleak on the content front that the largest and the strongest coalition in the game has to brag about shooting structures.
---
Hope this isn’t archived by then. And I hope you get more than 20bil. 
---
Aim high.

---
Oh god we did this to so many games. 
---
Dozens of rust servers were ruined. 
---
Durhurrdurr got us all banned from Ablion. 
---
Then we decided to host our own rust server... We lost multiple corps from that mistake.
---
It's goons and you manage 800B? 
---
Wow. This is on a level with that one guy who just posted about robbing a highsec corp for 20B after two years of membership and thinking people would be impressed. For the expected scale, this is a big letdown.
---
Shame that the highest DPS HAC can also permatank the highest DPS HAC if you spend money.
---
YES!
---
Accurate? Check.
---
Funny? Check.
---
Bean is a fucking legend? Check.
---
Just take my upvote and leave...
---
Because the heavy go 61km rather then 31km.
---
And so this is useful to destroy containers.
---
Upon entering a room, burn to 60km of each container and send one heavy missile on each. Then go near the next gate and deploy your tractor beam structure, orbit it and destroy all opponents.
---
You can send drones and 3 assault launchers on targets, while the single HML take cares of containers.
---
Gets bored of own playstyle, conspires to steal his friends' stuff to fund a playstyle he hasn't even tried. Lmao you're a dirtbag, like seriously. You could've asked for some isk or ships to help you along and get you a good recommendation into a new corp with roles to start. Instead you got 10B to blow on shiny shit you don't know how to use and a character nobody is gonna trust. You literally played yourself.
---
Its even easier now that there are not account API keys. I can have three spies on a single account and none of them are the wiser to each other.
---
Damn. First time I am quite agreeable with what Paq says. What has come to all of us =\_\_=
---
Honestly at this point Eve is a containment zone holding back catastrophic autism from the rest of the unsuspecting world
---
I mean, from what I've seen, panfam could afford to replace these structures like 20 times from their rental money, so does this really matter to them? Welcome to EVE 2019, where any loss literally means nothing. 
---
Without either massive internal defections, or significant loss of their industrial base, nobody could beat goons in a straight up war, and it's unlikely that anyone will be able to build to that level. Honestly, the only way I could see goons being beaten is if their krabs get demoralized, and start to think Esoteria looks safer than Delve, so goons see large-scale losses of krabs to TEST. Honestly, given the overpowering numbers of Titans and Supers that goons can field, I think krab losses might legitimately be more dangerous to goons than fighting ship losses.
---
This is hilarious. 😆 I too brag about Delve killmails when my region is on fire
---
Assuming you're not a troll I'll answer seriously. You are not meant to be 100% safe anywhere. Eve is not that sort of game. As soon as you undock you are vulnerable. Test and goons have some of the best super umbrellas but as soon as one of their line members undocks it's possible they will get blown up.
---
If you just want to mine and manufacture stuff and not worry about getting blown up high sec is the safest most likely but even then, don't autopilot on gates or mine in a t2 barges that isn't a skiff or people will kill you still
---
Find their recruitment channels, in-game or out of fame and ask to speak to a recruiter.
---
Yeah that guy is dumb. He should totally stand in front of the tank.
---
So you admit that GSF is not some shining beacon of empowerment and self-actualization for the EVE pilot and a refuge from those big bad northern groups who squelch and limit a pilot's options.
---
Holy shit, the irony of someone who has obviously never been in an alliance outside of PH talking about an echo chamber. You should get a spy into to Goons to see how good we have it. Hell, we even have weekly classes teaching new capital pilots how to safely navigate and fight in their shiny new space coffins, unlike your "new player friendly" alliance apparently.
---
But you must be new to the game. FYI, Goonswarm has doubled its member count since being booted out of the North and moving to Delve, so perhaps there is something about us that is appealing to players, new and old alike.
---
Nobody’s given a shit for the last 3 years so it cant have affected me that badly.
---
I dunno Im a mere F1.
---
It was sarcasm. I know.
---
The point was "I am not safe. They (goons, etc) are
---
Balance 101!
---
Bet he does it with account to account trades. A trolly ass move would be give him a buy list, help him move his stuff into null, and eject from corp. Then he gets to asset recover it all into low and tagged undesirable again.

---
What does your history look like?
---
Can I have your flavoraid when you're done with it?
---
Because those helidicking supers were almost half of null by themselves in terms of numbers and had an entire region entirely dedicated to make them as cheap as possible while also being almost untouchable because of your already existing strategic advantage? Notice how this significantly differs from reality? So I'd say that's the fucking difference
---
Obviously, what you need, is one of the new small structures with 1 timer and only function being moon drilling.
---
You made my day.
---
Probably because you joined people who didn't know how to scrape the info or bother to message your old corp. You got lucky it didn't effect your 2 years of SP on the character
---
I am a shit player I'll admit it.
---
150 seconds is a very long time indeed. It's enough for a small ship to completely traverse a system (and then some). Does the "delay" mean that it will never appear in system local if it exits in 149 second? Or will it show in local when it's no longer present? 
---
Also: Does that mean that someone logged off in a system would take 150 seconds to appear after logging in, and they could warp while cloaked and light a non-covert cyno?  If you don't think that would be useful for fleets, then I think you need to be in more fleets my friend, because oh boy would goons make hay with a ship like that.
---
My main issue with your absurdly OP idea is that while it would indeed be an effective bot hunter, it would also be utterly oppressive to human ratters. I feel like bots could fairly easily be re-written to be near permanently aligned at 100% warpable align speed and instawarp as soon as your hypothetical hunter decloaked, while a human ratter would inevitably have fallible reaction times. The logical consequence of such a ship would be that humans would only rat under a reliable umbrella or in completely disposable ships; everywhere else would be restricted to millisecond-reflex instawarping bots in fairly disposable ships.  Basically, it'll just be VNIs; VNIs everywhere - most of them bots and the rest trying to compete with the bots.
---
Yeh
---
Yup
---
Dual prop firetail is the best kitey-frig hunter out there, if only because it's so much less feared than the Cyna and Jag.
---
But you can't drop your blops inside of a plex either. Got to do it at the gate. So you already need to be hunting with 2 characters. 1 to tackle and 1 to light the cyno. Then 3e char as blops. 
---
Would be more effective to just have 3 characters to fly around and hunt. Or even just 2.

I mean, there is a bug report feature ingame

---
ROFL so accurate
---
I mean this is a sandbox game, we should encourage people to have fun in high sec if that's what they want to do. Low level heists isn't my idea of fun but not everything has to be about making the big money in Eve.
---
&gt;at least pretend to fight back for a couple of months
---
CCP feels that it has become too predictable. And that the roadmaps ultimately didn't help much. The ongoing story has entered into one of mystery and therefore not knowing what is coming next is part of it.it would be nice to know at least some details about what is coming next be on pirate implants, and hopefully we will get more information in the upcoming Eve to her events now that Invasion chapter 1 is out. speaking of which, the mere fact that it is called chapter one sort of implies that they do have some kind of plan.
---
You should! It's free to play after all, get a taste for it.
---
You'll have to excuse us. We're impressionable youngsters, and after hearing this line spoken towards Brave Collective and TEST for multiple years, we didn't know not to use it ourselves. Clearly, there's some nuance we haven't mastered.
---
Cruisers or Frigates only
---
You want Invasions to generate pvp content beyond just suicide-ganking ninja looters? Here’s my solution: Due to the challenge of directly repelling the Triglavian threat (the player-accessible fleets in Invaded systems are just what slips through the cracks, therefore), CONCORD is forced to redistribute assets away from their Overwatch fleets. 
---
As a result, *Invasions result in a decrease of Security Rating for affected systems*- by 0.3 in the perimeter, 0.4 in adjacent systems, and 0.5 in the core system.
---
That would be cool. Like vocused voids but with the damage of a titan DD. Or maybe less than that if you want to bother with boring things like "fairness" and "balancing"
---
My only regret as a Goon is that all of the best blops targets are blue.
---
If only NCdock and friends would bother to show up to the party. 
---
*sigh.*
---
You need something to prevent AFK ownership.  I could see this working only if whatever was passively collected was based on X% of whatever rocks were left in the field when it expires (ie you get 25% of whatever rocks were left when the field expires as passive asteroids).   This way the people who actually live near the moon could ninja mine the field if the owners aren't around.
---
Not necessarily, but... *why*?
---
Yeah the count every killmail ( but NPC kills are not a issue if they are constantly counted )
---
4 hours in a Boat fleet is a pretty heavy payment.
---
No, the difference is that is was ok when the north was the big scary monster and it's not ok when the shoe is on the other foot.
---
My how the once mighty have fallen.
---
so a few things:  
---
* use out of game utilities (/r/evejobs, discord, [eve forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/corporations-alliances/recruitment-center), [eve-corps](https://eve-corps.com/) )
---
* have an in-game recruitment channel where interested people can come chat with recruiters, put a link to it in your corp bio
---
* have a discord or other out of game channel that people can come chat to recruiters while not currently logged in  
---
here's the biggest thing though... Be honest about what your corp does and what your vision for the future is. Not only that but have a plan on how you aim to reach that goal. Don't try to recruit everyone who shows interest, recruit the people who you think will fit.
---
Already done :)
---
Only the best memes here folks
---
Part 2:
---
No wait, EVE is about finding out how to fund a new campus for your training corp; you have to get all the diplomacy stuff squared away, make sure you're not stepping on anyone's toes, because neutrality is how you've stayed alive this long. It's about finding volunteers to take care of processing, administration, updating the website, writing a mapping program, preferably in C, but you'll take whatever works. It's about writing a new OPSEC, and clearing it with the corp management, most of whom you have personal numbers to, and stay in a private IRC channel with almost constantly. You barely even log into the game anymore. It's like a second job, but you enjoy it. You love seeing these newbie pilots grow up and get the chance you never got, 10 years ago when EVE was new. You don't have much taste for fighting anymore, but new blood is always good, and it's a fulfilling feeling.
---
No wait, EVE is creating a new character, slowly training their skills to be a decent combat pilot. (note that this means you can't train your main character, who is on the same account) You post on the RP forums, about your backstory and [mostly made-up] adventures. Another pilot joins in, and you regale tales of near-misses and close battles, slowly becoming friends. Or what he thinks is a friend. Soon after, he invites you to join his corp; you accept, and the few dozen of yall spend many merry evenings on mumble, getting drunk, brawling accross your pocket of space, and writing verbose and over-embellished stories on the forums. Months pass, and one of their long-time members leaves the game, due to IRL commitments. Leadership roles get shuffled around, but they realize they need another person to fill in the hole; Long story short, you start getting responsibilities. More months pass; you are now a vital part of the corp; you've met up with some of these guys irl, gone drinking with them. You've seen/heard some of them get married, and listened to a couple of them tell them their dark secrets. They trust you. Little do they know, that the last 10 months has all been fake, a long, drawn-out revenge. They are part of the support of a major alliance, an alliance that ganked you long ago. Now, they will pay. You wake up all the members of your real corp. "It's go time." You steal everything. All ships, all modules, all the money, everything; everyone you can take roles away from, you do; everyone else, you kick. You take everything, and you run. In the morning, confusion abounds; you listen while trying to stifle your giggling until they realize who did it, and you are kicked from their comms; nevertheless, the impact you had was felt; the alliance fell apart two weeks later. (Now you may be thinking, why didn't CCP, the developers of the game do anything about it? I mean, this guy stole from so many people! Well they did do something about it... they made a fucking expansion and trailer based off of it. Stuff of legends :D ...)
---
No, wait... EVE is about spending tens of thousands of man-hours assembling and transporting the equivalent of tens of thousands of US dollars of ships accross the galaxy to one station, loading them with one round of ammo each, and giving them out for free to your alliance. Oh and this one station, is the largest trade hub in the game. Literally thousands of people are here during peak hours. All of the most expensive and highest volume stuff comes through here. And if you shoot anyone you're not at war with, CONCORD, the faction-less space police flying the most OP ships ever imagined, will neut you to nothing, infinite-point you, infinite-ECM you, and kill you mercilessly. Hence, the one bullet. For DAYS, Jita burned, and burned, and burned. CCP had to alter their code for how a system with this many people in it at once worked in the middle of this. All trade in the entire galaxy ground to a halt; mineral prices were 1000% more expensive, or higher. Ammo, ships, modules, couldn't be purchased anywhere. And still, Goons had more ships in Jita. CCP... well, they made a "news report", gave them even more publicity on the log-in page, and made a dev post that stated, "this... this is what we want our game to be. o7"

No wait... EVE is about conquering half the conquerable space in the galaxy, setting up diplomatic relations with the other half, so that no one'e fighting anyone and everyone is bored. Then, one small faction has a spat with another, tinier, faction. They call in help from the big boys. Eh, we're bored, we'll come. One guy, who is famous among the nullsec guys because he's a Fleet Commander of the biggest coalition in the game, pushes one wrong button, and instead of bridging a fleet to this little tiny outpost, accidentally strands himself there. Then, like sharks smelling prey, one of his old rivals jumps a fleet of caps in to kill him; in his pride, he calls in reinforcements. They call in more reinforcements. About 2.27 seconds, literally EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE FUCKING GALAXY, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, KNOW ABOUT THIS. CHAOS ENSUES. The CFC, the biggest power block in the game, has just dedicated a large amount of their cap fleet to this battle, and literally everyone else is coming in to curb stomp them. Only, they get in a lot of kills as well. Thousands of people, all fighting simultanously, TiDi (Time Dilation) is so high that no one knows how slow it's going, literally the largest multiplayer battle in gaming history is going on on hardware that wasn't even designed to handle this load. Night shift at CCP shuffle stuff around to another node, lag goes away but TiDi is still there. Battle goes on for hours, tens of thousands of dollars lost on each side, history is made, makes the fucking news. And you tell your buddies, I was there...

EVE online is a game about groups of bastards competing to be the biggest bastard in a battle for money and power. It's about spaceships fighting other spaceships in a fishbowl. It's about real world skills, not grinded levels/ gear/ items. You won't get far by just doing the same thing until it works. It's about earning trust and respect. You won't get accepted to a corp if you've been having a lot of conversations with their enemies. It's about forging your own path. No one will tell you where to go or what to do. It's about being an immortal pilot with a spaceship's worth of electronics in your head, allowing you to control an entire ship by yourself and learn skills hundreds of times faster than a normal human; the reward for your first tutorial mission gives out tens of thousands of ISK; one ISK converts to about what you'd need to live comfortably dirtside for a year; and a pirate you can kill in a matter of seconds has a bounty of over a million, you regularly fly ships of hundreds of millions, or even billions, and if you ever lose your ships, you get a new (shitty) one, for free, all paid for by the taxes of the citizens of tens of thousands of worlds in thousands of systems. They revile you, and curse your existence; all the while, you routinely kill ships with crews of hundreds, for pocket change.
---
This is EVE. Join the fight.
---
I never understood the complaints about the new map. I started in 08 and love the new map. I can see lines just fine and you can make them more visible.
---
the only thing better without hell march is an already existing hell march t:mad:
---
by that I mean it doesn't need a second hell march all up in its grill
---
What’s the alternative? Sit around and do nothing?
---
its a strong independant hell march that dont need no other different hell marches
---
&gt; So the value in the moon is there, just no one seems to care to go get it. Even with all the more powerful mining options.
---
This is where you are fundamentally misunderstanding my argument. By this logic there is infinite value everywhere in EVE. There's rats in that belt, there's rats in those anomalies, there's drops in that DED site, there's blue loot in that wormhole, etc. The players in all of these groups are getting a cut of it one way or another. Some might be doing jita trading, some might be ratting on alts in a renter corp, some might be doing capital production, whatever. No individual is lacking for ISK or expecting passive income to provide it. What we are talking about is income for the organisation, not the individual.
---
&gt; I've played for 12 years and this reeks of the old "Where is my content?" "Well bash their pos" "I hate pos bashing, it's boring" excuse making.
---
I've been the FC in that situation plenty of times. I'm happy to tell those people to get with the program. If I shoot a POS the goal is usually a fight but failing that we'll get some corp/alliance income and a pile of killmails. If I mine on a rock on an Athanor all I stand to get is a personal wallet tick which could in theory be taxed or donated entirely back to the corp/alliance. It doesn't further any goal nor get me any closer to doing what I actually want to do in what is ultimately a computer game, it's just mining.
---
I usually fly a dual web arty fit, but I've been wanting to try the dual prop fit... if only because there are so many people flying kitey bullshit in LS atm.
---
LOL. That alliance history explains a lot about you.
---
Supercap in isk spent, I guess
---
"Years" - more like at most a couple months to reestablish the ihubs and such.
---
I see the goons are ignoring the weeks of 'delve krab time' that is being lost as they are deployed?  If you figure that in, and goon numbers are to believed, goons are out 10's of trillions so far this deployment.
---
Seriously, you keep bringing this up. Is this the last, best defense you can muster, that we're not making enough income while we steamroll your space?
---
And whew, look at that member slope. We're bleeding members faster than NC is bleeding infrastructure.
---

---
Two things, 1) you should put the gigantic wall of astra KMs in a hyperlink so your post isnt 10 pages long
---
2) I wonder what happens to gotg/deadco/whatever the fuck they call themselves this week when goons go home? I don't know if they really have the numbers to not get farmed unmercifully the second there aren't a bunch of goons to batphone, and goons certainly aren't likely to stay deployed for more then a couple months.
---
CCP has change rule of km during time (exemple : fighter kill mail).
---
Why is fedup shit listed. Those are/were your legacy pets and have nothing to do with the north anymore. So like I said in another comment, nice inflated numbers
---
wholesome meme, take my energy and upvotes
---
You're very welcome to explain that statement since historically, most alliance leaders have recognized the very non-political viewpoint I have held in the game.
---
Hi olmeca you still strolling through calling everyone a bot?
---
Passive income is not a good idea and never was.
---
PH, explains all. The only idiots taking Eve Online to another level just because they always come in second.
---
meh
---
I should likely take a couple of samples down the line see if i can get a couple of months worth of % of what get's killed ( on zkill ).
---
What is interesting is i'm not sure how good Zkill is historically given it has not always been the universal standard for killmails.
---
lmao
---
You should try that number again, but this time change the dates to the actual war. 
---
Or you really go out and normalize for krab kills in Delve before and after the start of the war.
---
This makes me sad, itsme did his best, constantly provided content, but the move to low sec provi was the wrong one, at that point Paquito should have taken control, I always saw you as a presidential figure, allowing others to lead, but stepping in when they were making the wrong choice, I suspect you tried. 
---
Move back to aeschee, if you build it they will come.
---
Calm and collected voice.. TEST.. you almost had me!
---
Yes, according to your initial argument, it literally does.
---
How do you use the old map? Last time I played EVE, the "new" map was like "Map Beta" or something so you had two options. Is the old map buried in the menu or settings somewhere?
---
&gt; 150 seconds is a very long time indeed.
---
If the idea is ever seriously discussed, we can talk about the optimal time.
---
Yes, the ship would jump gates without being seen in local. That's against nullsec locals' own absurdly OP mechanic, the intel network.
---
&gt; Does that mean that someone logged off in a system would take 150 seconds to appear after logging in
---
Imagine a 30 minutes timer starting each time you enter a new system. You are local delayed for the first 2.5 minutes of it, then you can't be local delayed until the 30 minutes expire. That timer doesn't reset or expire during logoff, or take a wormhole and back, or take a gate and back. But the timer is unique for each system. So you can jump system to system unnoticed.
---
Alternatively, we can make it an active module with a proper cooldown.
---
Each time I propose a big ticket item I get many people (particularly those with prejudgments about my personality) pointing out many technical details. In fact, you can do so for every single big ticket game change in Eve. I don't think people are being charitable when assuming I should have all the technical details worked out, already presented, in my initial posts. Yet, none of the technical issues I've heard so far weren't unsolvable with a fruitful debate.
---
&gt; permanently aligned at 100% warpable align speed
---
You can either write a bot that slowboats to align point, or that uses prop mode but isn't prealigned. You can't do both. The hunter can cloaky bump the ship if it is prealigned. There are also different ways to get the bot. You can catch him in-between warps. Or you can have a logoff trap in a sabre, and utilize local delay for intel. Given that the delay is about 150 seconds, you can even locate the bot, anchor a bubble in his warpoff spot, and catch it there.
---
&gt; it would also be utterly oppressive to human ratters. 
---
Given current statistics about how entire Eve loses no more than 5% of their farm in forms of PvE ships, I don't necessarily see more human ratters dying as a problem.
---
since when is picking on retards a fight?
---
how about both matter
---
i don't see anybody from ncpl saying that these losses don't matter. they're saying that they matter as much as goon losses in delve
---
goons are the ones claiming their losses are irrelevant but everyone else's matter
---
Frat has appeared just as many times helping nc/pl as phorde. As far as legacy goes I've seen them during x47 and ualx working with goons which was only due to the colossal amount of potential super and titan kills. Frat and phorde show up together everytime a baltec fleet forms....
---
&gt;Why does everyone always fuck that up?
---
Because most of us have english as 2nd , 3rd or 4th language wich means we occasionally make a mistake.What i find a lot more annoying is native english speakers who usually only speak 1 language feel the need to point out spelling errors when they can perfectly tell what the OP was saying even with the spelling error.
---
or, and i know this is wild, all losses count and anything else is just narrative
---
It's not so much stats, it's just a level of competence in dealing with the harassment. Goons have people ready with faxes, understanding with comms, and an unwavering willingess and ability to drop an overwhelming number of supers on the problem. Most groups don't have that. Even if they can drop 6 or 7 supers often and deal with it, they'll get baited out eventually and killed which stops them being so keen in future.
---
++
---
It’s nice on paper, but population density proves that while wh has it’s draw, most prefer having local
---
Yikes. I thought smart people played this video game.
---
i'd be curious of the avg pilots per kill. I reckon the avg kill has alot more pilots on it now in 2019 compared to previous years with small gang content being in such a sad state right now
---
Best one of the war so far, got me a good laugh.
---
Accurate (-:
---
I mean if your an alpha you have already been screwed by CCP by being told you can play eve and have a full free to play experience.
---
I find your lack of spreadsheets disturbing.
---
Afk ownership is prevented by the fact anyone can shoot them. The owner needs to turn up and defend it. Timezone tanking might save you now and again, but anything of actual value and autism finds a way.
---
Well we have evidence he has a weak old brain, but other than that no.
---
you can still get scammed, rob people, awox, spy, and call people a fucking worthless braindead scumfuck bastard pile of trash mental dickface that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerate you are
---
seems fine to me
---
I literally didn't read his post, just scrolled down to the comments for the comedic value.
---
Because the double-o has the right sound.  The single o in "Losing" should make an "ah" sound like in octopus, but it's one of the random exceptions in English.
---
This is the type of content that keeps me subscribed on Reddit despite not playing the game in years.
---
imagine having to damage control this much after mindlessly grinding undefended structures
---
So ... you’re saying goons (&amp; pets) are loosing? 😂
---
Or they could just be visible.
---
???
---
you missed the joke dot jpg
---
I always thought that it would be pretty amazing to have instanced pvp like what the alliance tournament does. I know you COULD prearrange small gang fights but thats not the same.
---
Oh DeadCo isn't friendly with NC./PL, so NC./PL are fighting on 3 fronts atm?  Goons in Tribute, DeadCo in Tenal and the various people trying to steal the Spire in drone lands?
---
Just a dog pile or is this something more?
---
Dude the rivalry is over... Let that dead horse die. Goons won. And I mean goons not Init.
---
You said it. It can be done now. Which is why you're wrong in your assumption it would ruin the market. Why should I sell to a known hostile to help them fund their war against me? It's common sense. Besides it would open the doors for new players to provide a market and compete. So you're 100% wrong.
---
&gt; Most groups don't have that.
---
True. And that's why I specifically target umbrella mechanics which allow people to have stuff at ready, and have one of the biggest capital forces in the game, and that's enough to ensure near 0 risk to all their members. 
---
It's such a mechanic that encourages alliances to non-selectively grow bigger and bigger. I think it determines sov null scene as well. If you want to look at reasons why one side has 2 times titans than the other, and replaces them 3 times faster, you should look at why people are joining different alliances in the first place. And that is mostly determined by safety of PvE capitals, essentially.
---
Why not? It's not like it's challenging to do
---
Lol, north so poor they dont even get real kool-aid, just flavoraid.
---
I mean, it was a really good video. I still think any one of the Clarion Call videos is better. You still have my vote, though :)
---
nobody is making that argument. goon losses matter, so do ncpl's.
---
it's retards like you who try and disown the retarded crabs we have in delve. just because they're retarded doesn't mean they don't count. it just means we have a lot of retards
---
&gt;Unfortunately the gameplay was extremely gay and boring.
---
Top notch analysis.
---
Lasker Emanuel makes some pretty good Youtube videos.  He put up a blurb in one of his recent videos mentioning that his corp is recruiting, and it caused a bunch of folks to come our way and show interest.
---
Granted, it works better if you have an existing Youtube following, but making a video of the kind of content your corp is all about, and putting it up on Youtube might help.  The people who watch your video will be the kind of people who like your kind of content.
---
Recruiting can be hard, I know it burns folks out.
---
It's important work. Mittens told them so.
---
Or be great for other players... besides they could restrict it now if they wanted.
---
Looks like its really bothering the OP that the people they invaded could give a fuck less that they got invaded.
---
Same, but different.
---
\&gt; One second we're the ones worried about saving face and obsessing over killboards, and you only care about the infrastructure you have gutted. The next minute you're bandying about figures 
---
Those are the same thing. Your side cares so much about the numbers that it went out of its way to transfer ownership of the largest structures and then pull the most expensive bits from the structures you just left. Your side obviously cares, so Tuz here is just going out of *his* way to show both sides how much there is to care about.
---
It's not hardcore. Never has been. You can choose it to be hardcore if that's how you play... as with any game.
---
i mean it's hard to scam if the only new accounts are rorq alts and Chinese converts lel
---
Man that would be the dream. Citadels on nearly every moon just collecting isk for you with no requirement for actual effort. All at damage cap and timed for some ass end tz so np content actually came of them. Oh wait.... that sounds like shit. Maybe if there weren't three timers for a fucking small structure and tz tanking.... otherwise good for ccp not doing this
---
Hey, and you were the sole cause! Nice.
---
That’s not try OP! You can get accused of hate speech too!!!
---
/s Yeahhh it was all over by the time we had pearl abyss.
---
Holy paragraph breaks Batman.
---
&gt; Hell you should've gotten Lord Maldoror to narrate your video
---
Oh I wish lol.
---
I thought about getting another narrator. But thought it'd be stupid for someone else to tell the story.
---
Oh I see, so you only care about killboards because we supposedly care about killboards?
---
What makes that even more hilarious is you yourselves are the ones who have convinced yourselves that we care about killboards.
---
So not only have you worked yourself into a frothy rage over something, but hilariously, it's something only you guys care about lmao. You guys are just great.
---
11/10
---
I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about. Not much has changed on that axis. It's easier to recover, and I WISH it was easier for NEW players to recover, but that's largely due to the efficiency of industry over time. I'd like to see it get harder for the soft squishy krabs and the vets that have lost it.
---
In one side, 13000 people shooting citadels and other ancorable stuff, with no pvp  
---
At the other side, the remaining people on the server, joining fleets, raiding, killing and doing some pvp.   
---
Yeah goons, you totally winning
---
I was in the CFC during WWB, i don't remember there being a fight put up at all from goons. I remember we in SMA defending fade alone as long as we could while goons ran to low sec.
---
Imagine believing that NC/PL hadn't done subcap deployments since before goons lost the north
---
Dunkey?
---
No, because no "small group" will hold any valuable moons if a "big group" can just trash the Athanor and set up another passive mining station
---
I hate to see a skeleton cry
---
Running out of straws?
---
If you take the sov, but lose the goodfights, is that really winning?
---
Good spin attempt, you need some grease on them wheels though
---
flair checks out
---
Already done. Non strategic assets were secured before you even moved North.
---
soft squishy krabs that have 6 minutes invulnerability button on top of 100k tank
---
fucking unreal
---
Timers are pretty valuable tools to keep smaller corps and alliances from getting totally steamrolled. However, there should only be one timer on a structure. You get one chance to defend it and that's it.
---
Obligatory Dreddit is recruiting.
---
Your good at this, ending is debatable though
---
I think you're underestimating people a bit much.
---
The truth is they did underestimate goons capability and model when they started building like madmen, and that was the mistake.
---
But people stopped QQ'ing about this meta long ago and started to adapt, way too late I agree.
---
Also some people seem to be allergic to krab whatever they may offer to you or your alliance.
---
A passive moon extraction module only usable in low sec would be nice if you only consider lowsec and its inhabitants. The problem is current 0.0, which the goon baddies &amp; "friends" (Legacy etc.) have basically won. If such a module would be available in lowsec i can see a nice little goon-sig taking all the best moons and just waiting for attackers to drop dreadbombs or even Titan blobs. They have more than enough money to build up fleets of those ships just for lowsec moon-defense. Nobody could realistically take those moons and they would get even more money while doing basically nothing. As long as there are no drastic changes to 0.0 to break up the mega coalitions it will only get worse... and the longer CCP waits the harder it will be to really mix up things.
---
Tried Invasions for an hour... won't do it again. CCP forgot the bulk of players play solo and scanning more boring than mining.
---
It's not like most of the people who did this pre-Phoebe could easily inject a carrier character or at least buy a second carrier and use jump clones
---
Dude asset safety and invincibility buttons lmao
---
We harpy fleet a small gang every day through FW space
---
I know this is probably just bait from a salty player, but I'll play.
---
Your perspective is just altered because you play and understand the game. It's no different than someone who beats dark souls saying it's actually an easy game. The fact that you can still be scammed, risk everything the second you undock/off tether, and how easy it is to be exploited, suffice to say the game is still pretty hardcore. Just compare it to any other game of similar stature, such as mmos or space sims, and see how much more brutal than it than other options.
---
But I guess people will never be satisfied until the game murders your whole family, burns your house down, and drains your bank account when you get podded.
---
I honestly miss when toxicity was more commonplace in this game
---
Been trying to get that going. Most people want to krab or drop caps though. Message me direct if your interested in growing that with us.
---
I think its generally a bad sign that we're morale posting about EVE.
---
Posts like this warm my heart
---
That's funny, because I remember Goons literally having to form fucking *defensive ratting and mining fleets*  to go to Fade to try and prop up monkey sov indexes because your shit alliance couldn't be bothered to actually undock and defend it themselves.
---
I remember Theta Squad fully deploying to Fade first, and the rest of Goonswarm a few weeks later, to defend your space for you for a month or two before Deklein was under siege. 
---
But I can't actually expect someone who obviously has no idea what actually happened during WWB to understand SOV mechanics.
---
I've not, that's why I'm wondering. Judging from the average bashing op though, whale hunting looks like a whole lot more fun.
---
They're there... just hard to see. I suppose I could try adding horizontal rules to break it up a bit more.
---
LMFAO you are killing POCOS?? oh my sides
---
why i call them drone lands federation and DRF is beyond me.  whoops.
---
It's not over until the Imperium stops enjoying it. But I'm glad you think you speak for the entire Imperium. You must be someone important, who are you?
---
Lol, goon comms are something else.
---
I mostly hangout in no chatter and watch netflix, but a lot of people sit in the regular comms channel and just bullshit.  You get a lot of interesting discussions.
---
Good job. And yeah suddenly supers is pretty much a norm now.
---
Its just a litany of shit dead alliances.
---
This dude is the Typhoid Marry of EVE Alliances.
---
TIL NC. needs to deploy to defend vs 10 dudes.  
---
Probably even need to move the 11 carriers back that are deployed in Provi
---
I'm familiar(ish). Bob is Band of Brothers, considered god by some in EVE, was a massive powerhouse alliance that had major control of EVE in it's early days. Pets, I believe, are corporations that are used as allies but with much less priority or reputation, like a pet. Something an alliance nurses and raises on their own rather than another fully-fledged corp joining their cause.
---
Goons are obviously Goonsquad. Russia, at least right now, is Winter Coalition and related areas of space  occupied by allied Russian players in the South East regions. And Northern Coalition was an coalition of northern alliances created to stop BoB from controlling the game. Not sure what happened to them after BoB was defeated. And I know Northern Coalition. (with a period) is just a single corporation that (perhaps) is using the name to their own benefit.
---
Lets just say that a lot more of my former alliances are still alive and kicking than yours.
---
youre trying to hard
---
Wasn't my intention. I've had this saved for curious potential new players for some time. Just happened to see it in my bookmarks and decided it had been a while and might be cool to re-share it.
---
LMAO yeah you've astounded me with the breadth of the game you have experienced. I hope you have enjoyed your transition from feeder corporation into a smaller conversation when then got rolled into GSF by the corp leadership, lmao.
---
&gt;OP's calculations were out.
---
No, your literacy was out.  Go read the post again, and this time notice that he specifically adjusted the calculations for you to give an unreasonably low price instead of the original, far more likely price.
---
You need to realize a few things:
---
1. zkill's prices are based on things actually sold on the market, and XL rigs are generally not sold on the market.  So the prices on zkill for XL rigs is incredibly inaccurate.
---
2. The cost of building something in EVE is variable.  From experience we can make a good estimate about how much it cost, but it's possible to build something cheaper or more expensively.
---
I think its hilarious, I mean, when we defended tribute and vale, we held out for over three months against nc/pl/ph/gotg/whatever other batphones they still had at the time. Meanwhile, they just roll over without any meaningful fighting.
---
Its fucking hilarious.  I cant wait to shoot at the second keepstar to die in M-0.
---
You're special kid. I'm surprised you're able to hold down a job irl. Not gonna lie
---
You have to have the region/constellation actually selected for the contrast to brighten up. More often than not, most of the map sections will be subdued at any given time.
---
You could do with trying just a little bit more.
---
Haha I love this...
---
No, but we can see your side does, so it just adds to our enjoyment.
---
And if you don't care, why transfer all those structures and pull all the rigs?
---
And who's frothing?
---
When does the M-O keepstar come out?
---
Could you name these hegemonies?
---
It's always amusing to find the people who've never built anything more than the frigate in the NPE.
---
Hey, at least rorqs create big fights when they get tackled. We've had tons of big fights over rorq dunks and rorq saves lately. So on one hand the krab has an easier time, but on the other hand I get more fights.
---
You know which one I care about more.
---
Well played this was a good one
---
Wow! Nice kill man!!
---
[Hmmmmmmmm](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77129065/) that hurts
---
Yeah thats the original km for that pic
---
but panfam arent wholly reliant on ratting and or mining for isk.
---
&gt;  Honestly, the only way I could see goons being beaten
---
...is WWBee II imo
---
Yeah and you went afk for two days and came back realized you are evicted
---
That sounds like good gameplay
---
I'm you but stronger.
---
It's closer to a sandbox than arbitrary timers
---
Well you can still have the unfortunate luck to join an alliance where the tax wallet is more or less the leadership titan fund. Leaders who anchor very few structures for you to do reactions and industry in, and mining and ratting from, unless you already have the isk to cough up those structures yourself. In such a case you could have a very bad time trying to earn a fax or carrier, let alone a supercarrier or titan, based on linear income sources (your goal divided by your ticks equals how much effort you must put in). 
---
On the other hand you could have the good fortune to join an alliance where you get a free head-start to get started in salvaging, mining and ratting. An alliance that anchors tons of structures for you to react and build in, and tons of structures for you rat and mine from. In such an alliance you can turn your first hour of salvaging (100M or so) into reactions and/or industry, and get 120M back, and then next cycle the 120M becomes another 20% extra, then 20% more next cycle on top of that, etc. The more money you accumulate the more money you make for your effort. Then earning the isk for whatever goal you want, is quick, easy and fun. You could even easily plex your accounts and play for free with very little grinding so you can partake in all the content you want. 
---
Real talk though, I wish there was an imperium delve economy in every corner of the galaxy,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            that would result in a lot of big capital fights.
---
&gt;I mean, from what I've seen, panfam could afford to replace these structures like 20 times from their rental money,
---
Torching the rental lands could have an effect on this.

1. A frigate or destroyer cannot run a haven like a vni or at all for that matter 
---
2. Having more content available in null space does not infringe on play styles that already exist it provides more options to a wider variety of players. 
---
3. More players doing more activities in space that is pvp ready means more loss and it’s good for the market
---
Now you argue my points without saying git gud newb fly a vni
---
Not recently, why do you think a Sansha Shattered would be different than normal out of curiosity?
---
Why not pull them? Trophy denial and scorched earth have been valid combat tactics since forever. If we know something is going to die and our actions won't effect that outcome, then why not do everything that will make it more annoying for the enemy to conquer?
---
So we fueled up dormant, unused structures to make you grind more timers, slapped on armor plates to make the grind longer, and pulled unnecessary shit like rigs because it will produce gold like these threads, lmao.
---
There already is a passive module for those structures. They are called rorquals. Kill those rorqs. Put out some of your own mining ships instead (doesn't have to be rorqs) and reap the reward. I've seen this done already first hand. I'm renting in period basis. A group came in, killed the rorq that was mining R64 goo. They brought in barges and cleared the goo.
---
Really? You dare say that with that flair?
---
Or add more npc null and buff it. But I kind of like the fact that eve leaves things up to the players I just think they should offer more options to corps that hold sov maybe a i hub upgrade that allows spawning of all combat sites let the players choose.
---
/r/thathappened
---
I see your 9 day old pilot has injected into hicters.  Nice going bro!
---
As they say actions speak louder than words. If you want people to believe you don't care about killboards, your actions need to reflect that. Dropping Corp before a Titan loss or transferring a keepstar before it dies are actions that don't affirm your words.
---
It has the same relative worth.
---
You really need to find a better source for Titans if they're costing you that much.
---
This is exactly what I am saying. I don’t think this works the other way around. For example if I said that havens should spawn in high sec that is just dumb, but putting low tier low reward content into null hurts nothing and only would encourage more movement.
---
Wish he'd burned the writers of Season 8 instead...
---
South coast of England here
---
Well we haven’t killed any keepstar a yet. Those are coming next week. Stupid reinforcement timers
---
I already have.
---
This is why I've periodically created new characters over the years, random fresh starts with little to no history.
---
This makes me think of the movie War Games. With the amount goons make any war would be a loss going by this standard.
---
The only way to win is not to play. Would you like to play a game of chess?
---
Sorry for the wall of text and the late question.
---
I like most of your ideas, but I have concerns about your local delayed ship idea. 150 seconds is enough time to D-scan every single anom in the system and warp to your target, all the while staying cloaked. What would be the counterplay to this?
---
You say it has good on-grid speed and the tank of a recon, if we look at the option of the kraber killing the ship tackling him. 
---
\- Subcap mining ships can't do anything to it, you need a combat ship on grid for support. Works for mass multiboxers, doesn't for solo miners. (I'll admit this isn't that relevant, since, with the exception of moons, small scale subcap mining is trash isk)
---
\- VNIs: Krab-fit, I asume they wouldn't be able to shake it off, otherwise it's not a very good tackle ship and has no chance against anything bigger. Let's say it's good enough to force VNIs to adapt their fits, lowering their ticks, which I would say is fair, but why not nerf the VNI directly. 
---
\- Ratting battleships: A bit better at self-defence than VNIs, but also more expensive, especially the pirate battleship options.
---
\- Carriers: Carrier ratting is already a shit way of a making isk. You can make the same isk/hr doing hi-sec incursion, just to name one example, with half the APM, half the ship cost, and basically no risk of losing your ship. So if the carrier can't reliably clear tackle, everyone with a brain would stop carrier rating, which means no more pve carrier kills.
---
\- Supers: You can't tackle a super with a solo ship, but what you can do is provide a perfect warp in for your hyperfit sabre. Obviously if the super is aligned it can still warp off, so I feel it impacts this ship class less than all the ones previously mentioned.
---
\- Rorqs: They tackle themselves with their siege, they are affected the least by this.
---
\- Subcap mining fleets (e.g. on moons): Very little influence on them, they can have a few anti-tackle ships on grid, as well as with large enough numbers mining barges can put out some hurt.
---
DED ratters/mission runners: can see combat probes on D-scan in most of the cases
---
Hisec krabs/abyssal runners etc. : Unaffected
---
The second option is "Get friends":
---
\- Unless you're krabing in your staging system, the response arriving to clear initial tackle before the DPS ships land on grid is virtually impossible, unless you're cynoing in capital support (not exactly the response we want to encourage)
---
\- This leaves us with your friends coming to fight the fleet/solo hunter trying to kill you. Content generation, right? Let's say the defenders are arriving 1 minute after the attackers land on grid. In 1 minute anything subcap except of maybe a well tanked battleship, will get killed by even a solo t3c. If you have a decent amount of bombers (obviously they'd had to gate not blops) or other whaling ships, you can easily kill a carrier in a minute. You can kill a supercarrier fast with a dread bomb too, but then again he's probably gonna be using his cyno to save him.
---
So what kind of isk making activites would this change encourage?
---
\- Stuff that doesn't leave you vulnerable in space (hisec, abyssals, industry/PI/trading etc.) or requires the hunters to combat probe you
---
\- Big, expensive, high sp ships that can be protected by super-umbrellas, like rorquals and to a lesser extent supercarriers
---
\- Camping pipes leading to krabing pockets (imo gate camping is the most boring type of pvp. Also not that effective against cov cloak ships)
---
\- Doing PVE in groups
---
Now the first three are something I don't think we would want to encourage further (I guess more combat site runners would be cool, but meh).
---
Doing pve in groups or in more pvp capable ships is, with a few exceptions, not viable right now. Would you push for changes on this front to go with your proposed new ship class?
---
P.S. With regards to boting, I'd just want to remind that a bot will always react faster than an actual player. So a supercarrier ratting bot will warp as soon as the dictor character shows up in local, the carrier bot could potentially warp/jump in the time between the tackler decloacking and locking him. The 24/7 VNI bots have more time to replace their losses. etc.
---
P.P.S. The use of this in not hunting oriented scenarios (conflicts between exclusively pvp ships)  seems limited and not what this ship was intended for.
---
Just across the water from Seattle.
---
This got my so hard I didn't have time to take my pants off. +100
---
he's not your friend, guy
---
I agree with this. I have been playing with a few really new players they can’t possibly make enough money to feel safe anywhere else but high sec mostly due to the fact that in order to go on an adventure into null they would have to clean out thier wallet to afford a ship. Would be fun to play with these guys in some really cheep ships and go explore without the risk of losing everything.
---
The colors make it much easier to see linked systems and it's very easy to see obvious differences in whatever you're looking for due to it changing size and color whereas on the new map everything looks the same with a tiny size difference.
---
For example, pull up 'jumps in the last hour' on both maps - the old will clearly show the busier systems, while on the new one every system looks about the same except maybe perimeter will be a little larger than the others.
---
I'm recently back from a long hiatus, but before that I used to regularly killed hundred-plus mil garmurs in a t2 fit firetail.  Just have to make sure you hit your overheated ab the instant their long scram hits you, and you'll coast into your own scram range on momentum.
---
[Example](https://zkillboard.com/kill/59878621/), [Example](https://zkillboard.com/kill/50153078/), [Example](https://zkillboard.com/kill/50095019/)
---
It sounds like what you really wanna blot out the sun with is posts about zkill
---
Lmfao
---
I mean the rental money they've already earned. I doubt anyone has the energy to perpetually torch rental lands though. The renters will be back.
---
Like basically in any alliance you mean. It's basically the experience you get from any daily home defense fleet channel.
---
From a gameplay perspective though, structure bashing ops without any opposition don't bring all that much fun to the table. They're typically not the most popular strat ops within alliances.
---
It's often wise to hide your power level.
---
After B-R5, a conversation about Eve occurred at work due to the press coverage the battle got. I got involved, and eventually the topic of what alliance I belonged to came up. I answered truthfully: "Goonswarm Federation." Turns out, the head of QA had been scammed by a goon at some point in the past. While I reassured him I hadn't done it, personally (as I don't scam on account of a dire lack of talent or skill at the task,) things were never the same after that. He pretty much stopped talking to me unless he absolutely had to.
---
It's a 1 to 3 man site.
---
Imo most of null is pretty empty and it should get a overhaul to attract more players.
---
Then it’s great ! We’ll finally have more to do than running around in Battleship fleets just to catch some roaming forces and get the loot stolen by a ninja salvager in a Catalyst.
---
Every single structure bash I have seen go up has had a full fleet.
---
Maybe it is a goon thing, but we seem to enjoy structure bashes.  It has actually been a bit annoying trying to get into fleets because they fill up so damned fast.
---
Yes you get to mine
---
SERIOUSLY YOU GET TO FUCKING MINE
---
If we did that, would that mean we tipped the scales into fullblown sociopaths?  In EvE, you know what you are getting into.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztZI2aLQ9Sw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztZI2aLQ9Sw)
---
Triglavians called them out as an enemy
---
I genuinely don't think that would do it. Even if Legacy (and GOTG? they seem pretty friendly) turned on them, I actually don't think the rest of Eve could take them down. It would be close, at the very least.
---
Mate they are ashamed to admit in real life... Online happy to admit it...!
---
That's the thing, yeah. They have to get to that t1 explo frigate, and have the first one come back with some loot, before they can really get going. That's kinda why I actually recommend the real new newbros do some relic sites in abandoned lowsec first. It's totally dead, and they can 20m of loot out pretty quick and start dangerzoning their stuff in null without as much risk.
---
It's also that exploration is one of the only good options (ninja gas huffing being the other option) for a newbro to make that kind of money. My mentees make their first billion in a week or two for that reason, but if everyone did that we'd have ridiculous competition for resources. There should be other newbro income sources that offer a similar baseline - and teach a valuable skill. Gas huffing and exploration teach you to move around dangerous space, which you'll ALWAYS need to know how to do to play eve.
---
We need facwar to have a bit more of that. Hell, maybe even a more simulated pvp style of NPC combat mission.
---
I mean, being inside for 6 years I don't see it, but if you are vOv. Is it really different than you guys jerking about your preferred spreadsheet(mer) about a spreadsheet game?
---
Salty...
---
I don’t know why you get the negativity. You EVE your way. You decided you were going to take your EVE life into your own hands and you did what you did.
---
That’s EVE. No need to get cranky about it.
---
90 days ago he was one of the most despised posters in /r/eve it's funny how this community changes with the wind.
---
&gt;I doubt anyone has the energy to perpetually torch rental lands though
---
Methinks you haven't noticed that the Goons are quite happy torching right now.
---
As for renters coming back, the recent camping-then-burning drives demand and thus the price down significantly.
---
Possibility.  
---
As to the downvote on my post - serious hypothetical question, not talking shit.
---
https://youtu.be/6uAmMfsfeAA
---
There's always plenty of salt to go around in EvE.
---
I think someone is salty
---
Well done man! Also I have roamed a lot past 3 months, only once or twice I've had capitals dropped on me. So dont believe the hype. Its not as common as you think. Does depend on tegion, timezone, alliance somewhat though
---
Tryhard.
---
This is supposed to be funny.
---
Your alliance literally almost died because of the choice you made to try and hold the north.
---
Wouldn't be the first time a Northern Coalition rolled over and lost Tribute.
---
I know it is really unpopular but I would like to see a centralized pvp system that matches pilots into fair fights with other players. Load in with a destroyer you meet one other player destroyer, load in with a small gang of frigates you are matched against a small game of frigates can’t leave till someone is dead. All you have to do is look at ship buy prices vs ship manufacture cost to realize that not enough small ships blow up.
---
I've met a few eve players, as GSF has lots of monthly meetups in cities across the US. I'm lucky enough to be in one with a good chunk living nearby/not a far drive
---
...
---
In the minor pylons thingies ?
---
Yes our builders are reaping the benefit now.
---
\&gt;  ending is debatable though 
---
\+1 couldn't care less about being homeless again
---
Seriously.
---
I have called him that on Reddit for a year now (different account of course)
---
10/10. well done lad
---
It would be nice to see the game get more activities for small groups in general. There's a lot more to it than ppl think, and I wish I had time to teach it, because maybe more players would join the game in these activities.
---
I am struggling right now to captivate a few of these true new players. So I agree.
---
Instanced fleet pvp is actually an amazing idea. You can focus on fair fights (numbers wise) instead of roaming nullsec for an hour with a microgang and then accidentally running into a 100 man fleet. 
---
Maybe it could be like 3v3, 5v5 and 10v10
---
It will actually FUEL more pvp.
---
you have link for the beta mumble, for sure i'm download correct exe
---
New players need a fair fight in pvp to improve and I don’t think FW is really that new player friendly. We need something else
---
Not bad.
---
You got BoB quite right, they were not at an numerical advantage but mostly by organization and elitism. 
---
These days every alliance except 2 (those are goons and NC.) are called pets in a derogatory manner. Basically every junior partner in any diplomatic relationship is considered a pet now. 
---
Winter Coalition is mostly Fraternity (who are chinese) + allies.
---
The one coherent russian coalition right now is FI.RE, allies to legacy coalition (TEST).
---
Northern Coalition was not an alliance, but indeed a coalition based in the north in the BoB era. Some alliances are still around who were senior members in the old NC (Razor for example). 
---
The new NC. alliance are actually remnants of BoB, naming after their old enemy out of spite, i suppose.
---
Maybe i got some details incorrect myself, i was mostly writing from memory what i read in empires of eve rather than my own memory. Sadly i only started much later playing eve myself.
---
I made a really similar fit but with a nos instead of the rocket launcher. And yes, I have a very similar fitted Dram (but with lots of bling, because why not) but people usually ran away from it.
---
It's certainly nowhere near as hardcore as it was but it's still considerably more difficult then the average MMO.
---
It's a good job nobody has ever needed your approval
---
To be known as the tightest of tryhards, in the history of time?
---
Noone would be so silly as to try to deprive you of your chosen role?
---
Most of us never leave the house so you would never really meet a eve player
---
What losses are goons taking articulate that. Which one of our deployed supers and titans have we lost?    
---
Sure we have lost ships in Tribute, meaningful losses ?  No, they are subcap ships that can be replaced in a day. If you want to talk about killing ships on Delve go for it, it costs the alliance 0 isk, that is personal wealth. You are killing supers and titans of people that are not participating in the war effort so again tell me what the alliance is losing.
---
It took you a year and a half to realize that, or was your posting only anecdotal evidence of your intelligence?
---
Eh, we very well might see a big brawl, but Panfam is going to have to plan it right.  When it occurs, it will likely be from goon overreach with valuable assets and how quickly the support forms will determine if goons get smacked or if panfam becomes an even less viable supercap entity.
---
The hardest part about eve is dealing with the bitter vets that refuse to accept the game needs some changes to bring in new players
---
While EVE was never 'hardcore', it certainly has not been anywhere near that since at least 2015-2016.
---
He was just chilling 1000km off a gate like it was nothing.
---
Honestly, I personally don't care.
---
What you sow, you shall reap.
---
In fact with time some player have make some "universsal link" with all ressource in same place. 
---
My last download is january or February in the worst case no one has a recent link with all data.
---
Because we could do it, get paid and do what we did.
---
Fuckin good .....poor poor poor NC.
---
The attacker should get to set the timer.
---
I got the positive side of that with our former head of security having also been a former FC for Rooks and Kings in the glory days. Great stories were shared, while I was learning to FC for TEST.
---
Sounds like you should move to provi
---
"Tryhard" is the weirdest fuckin' insult.
---
What're you guys doing with the newbies? How big is your corp? Where are you located? I'd love to offer some of my theories on what we can do at the moment. Lemme help.
---
Outside of meetups the only eve players I've meet organically have been wormholers. Whichis wierd given its a relatively small portion of players.
---
That post was drivel.
---
Don't know if it's changed since I last played, but this is my experience. People will troll you, but if you played along with it, they'll help you out (usually). Sort of friendly ribbing. 
---
My first night in the game, I was running around in a frigate, ratting in low-sec asteroid fields. Some guy in a... Phantasm, I think it was, murdered me and my friend. Instead of bitching, we asked him for tips on not sucking in the game. He gave ups a few million ISK each and invited us to his pirate corp's newbie training corp. 
---
Basically, EVE players are jerks, but friendly jerks, unless you get salty with them. Then all bets are off. It's an odd culture to be a part of, really.

\- The amount of ISK gained for the reputation hit was not high enough.
---
\- Heist was not *meta* enough.
---
\- Heist took too long. Due to this, the HISKPERH  (heist ISK per hour) was not high enough.
---
\- Heist was done to a high-sec corporation (WH/Null corporation heists are much more popular).

Hope use enjoy :)

He was in a theter range or pobably already with full speed and aligned, if shit hits the fan
---
If small groups held moons pre-Phoebe (and they did), they'd damn sure hold moons today.  The whole point of "persistence beats strength on the fringes of the sphere" is that small groups hold moons there.
---
Damnit, you're killing the party with your damn facts...  
---
I was enjoying all that rope!
---
Holy fuck both sides are super cringe. Jeeeeeeeeeeesus Christ.
---
This is so 100% accurate
---
^ preach it man, 
---
I cannot fathom how full-grown adults decide to waste their thousands on some shitty mobile game that's boring, simple and not actually making them happy. I learned to stop wasting money on microtransaction p2w games when I was 13. 
---
Imagine what you could do with that money. Those thousands spent on that shitty mobile game could've been used to do meaningful things. Such as travelling the world, starting a business, or investing.
---
One of the best things about EVE in my opinion is that it discourages P2W mechanics by being as harsh as it is and requiring actual skill.
---
Zkill use CCP KM.
---
If CCP standard has change ... Zkill standard to. So it's why if we want make a true comparaison we need to take same kind of KM.
---
Remove all NPC/FIGHTER km for exemple. i don't remimber if girst mobil tractor unit give data when kill or not.
---
I fail to see anything wrong with what I just said.... But hey, whatever makes you happy, lol.
---
I straight up said that the Corp was getting the moons because the gm e-fucks the executor of the alliance and didn’t deserve them compared to mine that did actual work, I was right but cast out. I won in the end
---
I am torn apart: this is a repost, which means I should not upvote. But it's a very good one, which means I should. Fuck dude
---
Well it’s just a group of about three i have had the most exp with the game and the others are as green as it gets. I flew with one of them last night he had his comorat fit with a mine laser, a beam laser, 2 pulse lasers, a salvager, and one rail gun with no ammo. I have been trying to do some things with them like frigate abyss space but they just don’t seem to latch on. I think you really need to want to play eve and get into the research of the game to succeed.
---
seriously though, i'm brand new and don't know anything about the game.  i just want to take a screenshot of a bunch of rorqs.  also yea i don't know how to join fleet.
---
I think elite is better than eve, but eve is still very good
---
just delete panic
---
let fights escalate organically
---
That would really go against the spirit of eve, and the sandbox. Matchmade pvp would get us players, for a while, but I think it would either create a divide in the game or just kill it. If even 10% of the current crop of small gang players only played this other game, it might start a landslide.
---
A better idea is to simply have NPC scouts in faction warfare reporting enemies on an intel board. I don't see why they wouldn't be able to track everyone's movement in FW, so players would be able to see who's looking for a fight where.
---
Report them on gate grids, station grids, and inside plexes (not outside, camp away!) in enemy systems. Players with negative security standing would get reported as well. Players with positive sec standing and players friendly to the militia owning the system would of course pass unmolested. This gives some benefit to space ownership, and at the same time lets you throw up an "I'm looking to fight!" flag to the enemy militia very easily.
---
Of course it would end up being a flag for everyone because we'd end up with spies on both sides putting this intel on an automated out of game board.
---
I think it's a more eve solution to your idea. You see a small gang of frigs in Huola you can take your gang there with something you are confident they'll fight. What you don't know is if there's a Rook sitting in the plex they warp to looking to 3rd party you.
---
It's been 6 years if that makes you feel any better
---
The game itself is nothing special, the players and their interactions are just like Eve. Petty, vindictive, spies, near exploit levels of autism and game breaking techniques, I love it.
---
its probab;y better than having them docked in lowsec
---
I've found FW fine when I was out as an alpha, but it really is dscan pvp. There are no fair fights in eve, and being able to win a fair fight is not the most important skill in eve.
---
I'd like to see more content that teaches the basics of pvp fights, but losing an unfair fight can teach you a lot if you're willing to learn.
---
I miss when"toxicity" wasn't a buzzword that means "words I don't like"
---
we're on the same side. bring back freedom
---
I don't think you understand the definition of 'passive'.
---
Go play any other mmo, no seriously, they already have this why are people trying to turn eve into wow with spaceships ?
---
&gt;EVE online is a game about groups of bastards competing to be the biggest bastard
---
This is how I always describe EVE to friends.
---
If you are thinking in terms of what was destroyed and the cost to replace you are thinking about modern EVE wrong.
---
This is a war of economics. NC/PL can't replace things as easily as Goons. Pay attention to the MER. 
---
This will deter future renters and deny future income.
---
Goons can come back over and over at virtually zero cost each time NC/PL rebuilds anywhere in the game.
---
More perspective...Paying for all loses on both sides is up to just over 2 days of economic activity in Delve according to the DTU.
---
NC/PL can never catch up and ever loss hurts them more.
---
I've never met anyone who i didn't know online first who plays any online game i play. Be that wow, psu or eve.
---
You're catching on!
---
Unironical smug about you wasting your time shooting them...priceless!
---
Please explain why small gang instanced PVP would ruin Eve?
---
\&gt; Real talk though, I wish there was an imperium delve economy in every corner of the galaxy, that would result in a lot of big capital fights. 
---
Also goons: deploys to shit on the other large alliance in nullsec, to halt their economy
---
I like that. I know the arena idea is really not good but it would be fun to just be able to go fight someone fair and learn a ship in lots of situations.
---
you're fucking stupid
---
hi you're stupid bye
---
Sounds like a gameshow.
---
We held to our word and honored our diplomatic agreements, even if that meant we were badly beaten.  I also ironically note you are saying this now when your alliance gave us shit for years after we evacuated vale in order to prevent our death.  While now your alliance cedes tribute and tenal while putting up no real resistance.
---
Say whatever you will, unlike you we dont declare all allies 'allies of convenience' and stab them in the back the moment they are no longer useful.  Like you guys did to us, and to co2, and to brave, and ect.  We fought for as long and as hard as we could, unlike you.
---
Thrilling pvp sounds like! Pew pew pew!
---
That's not exactly easy because it would mean querying the content of every killmail.
---
I agree this is kind of the path I am on right now.
---
I'm sure all the good fights your getting now are paying off for the move. Wait, you guys wont leave the sh1 constellation.  RIP
---
TBF I enjoyed your fleets. But you just couldn't accept that there are more strategic things do and the line members don't revolve around your premade fights. Successful FC's in the imperium know there is a time and place for gf's and a time to eat the shitty structure grind. 
---
It's too bad your ego is the 143rd largest in eve. And that's only because your alter ego takes up the top 142 slots
---
playing eve, no time to go outside
---
If you scroll back far enough on my kb, you'll see I started with the same fit but with a Nos too.  I eventually decided DPS was more important than being able to tank for an extra 10-15 seconds, especially since I usually run out of cap and nanite charges at about the same time.  IIRC, swapping out the nos let me fit both the rocket launcher and bigger (200mm) guns as compared to my old fit.  
---
The way I fly that fit--often sliding into gangs in plexes and burning off to draw out one or two eager beavers, then turning and murdering them in sequential 1v1s--really requires the dps to drop someone before his friends arrive.
---
Sounds like this is your true specialization: 
---
&gt; \-Corporation emphasizes on getting new players acclimated to the game and helping them figure out what they find fun, etc. 
---
Not mining and ratting. I think you should focus your effort on this emphasis of yours then it gets easier to figure out where and how to recruit. 
---
The biggest corporations in the game started out as "fun for newbies" corps who then started teaching newbies and growing their member wealth. As they got more officers they could each have their own emphasis on what they spend their time on, and as they got many officers multiple people could help out with the workload in each area. 
---
If you try to be a one-man-band that does everything you'll burn out faster than you can say "grr goons".
---
Congratulations man, you single-handedly got thousands of manchildren to wake up and get off their asses.
---
People say EVE players are sociopaths. I argue that we are actually helping humanity and the economy.
---
This is more due to Cruiser online than anything else, a big mistake from CCP has been to not keep adding new ships with increased performance and cost. While “gear inflation” is something allot of people seem to dislike it’s almost required for a game. We are still using “mostly” the same ships as we did 10 years ago but we have been able to accumulate wealth for that time meaning everyone is richer but don’t spend any more ISK then we did back then.
---
If we are not using more expensive ships the total cost of losses will be the same or slightly lower each month as we loosing some people
---
&gt; While I reassured him I hadn't done it,
---
yea, but you are a goon.  why would he believe you?  :)
---
Pirat are fucking idiots tho and were doing it wrong.
---
During war time this is true for strategic purposes most the time. During peacetime no. No one cares if you welp as long as you learn. Idiots that never learn on the other hand...
---
I bow to your superior logic.
---
Haven't played Age of Conan since the early days, when we made Addiction rename their guild to RP Shire Style and started a war that had my account hacked multiple times, they xferred my main to a damn pve server the first time, when that didn't work they hacked again and deleted my characters
---
Amazing.
---
"Prettiness" over functionality seems to be a common theme at CCP.
---
If you think this, then your perspective on what is or is not 'hardcore' has been so massively skewed by playing eve that you have lost all commonality with the rest of the gaming universe. Eve may or may not be less hardcore than it once was; this is a matter of opinion. However, relative to gaming in general, Eve is still light years apart in terms of being hardcore. They're barely even in the same galaxy.
---
eve-kill.net and to a lesser extent battleclinic were the main killboards back then my man
---
I'm a wana-be director in one of the oldest member corps in Goonswarm. I've been playing this game since before your first alliance was even founded. I was already a bitter vet when Goons and the rest of DekCo spent a month trying to save your second shit alliance when your own members couldn't even be bothered to undock to defend your home system. I was a Goon when your third alliance didn't even bother to put up a fight and sold an entire region to the CFC for pennies on the dollar, rather than fight. I was a Goon when we trolled your sixth alliance so hard that they disbanded. And I'm still a bitter old Goon as we once again burn down your home.
---
But please keep applying your narrative bias to my history.
---
Gas havens are fine too I dont see why everyone cherry picks rock
---
Undefended structure lives matter
---
I'm going to lose more personally than the current total for Tribute , but in 2019 the \~900b isn't the end of the world. Time to start over elsewhere , pay off structures , and wait for goons to come knock over the sandcastle again :)
---
I don't think anyone really disagrees with you
---
for clarity, my actual position here is that you're stupid and it's not worth the effort it would take to even try and connect to you on a logical, reasonable level, let alone convince you of anything
---
i don't owe you shit
---
you're stupid, and i'm refusing to engage with you
---
someone repost this to one of those cringe subreddits tia

I'm sorry, but how is transferring ownership "trophy denial". We still get the kill.

And you pulled the rigs to win the reddit war?

Your explanation for how you aren't confined to a polarized viewpoint is to justify how you are, in fact, biased. Nice work chap.

good they need to learn spread the glory of eve to every corner.
---
Given the public-facing image of the Eve playerbase, I'd never admit I played it to another adult - much less admit it in a professional setting.
---
No. Gtfo
---
Not that hard in fact. Just more time to compile data.
---
Yeah after flying around aimlessly for two hours yesterday i just logged off bored. I'm definitely competent and willing to use mics and discord to take orders and learn the game. Only problem is I have no clue where to even start. I don't even know what null sec is or all the different "modes" I see  when I click on the agency button. How do you apply out of game? Looking on the eve website after logging in i don't see anything. I really want to like this game after many videos watched but man I'm on day 4 and trying my best.
---
I can't change your mind because I believe that most of the player base are high-sec care bears that play in Null Sec with Blue Donuts. 
---
Change my mind.
---
If it's not a problem why have you and yours been raging about it? I mean; it's a nice attempt at deflection but it just reinforces the formal fallacy in your argument? lol
---
My dude you need to step away from your keyboard and take a look at yourself. If you need to spin the discussion so hard to reach any conclusion where you can be the winner, then perhaps you're taking this a little too seriously.
---
Oh come on, a little trolling doesn't hurt.
---
&gt;Also goons: deploys to shit on the other large alliance in nullsec, to halt their economy
---
Those other alliances in nullsec; "Goons went home, lets fight among ourselves, king of each of our molehills, instead of combining into one or two huge economies."
---
https://youtu.be/2poDZ7jUqXw
---
That video explains, and showcases how dual prop is effective
---
PLease we're docked in SH1, get ur narrative right
---
Most are.
---
whats not full about the free to play experience
---
The key is to take out the allies first. Not to mention that goons only have to loose a *single* stand-off capital battle to realize they can't win on open ground. Because then they will simply stop undocking in any serious force for the rest of the war.
---
Line member participation will then quickly drop to an alltime low as nobody likes to be in loosing battles and the 90% krabbers, not being safe anymore in their mining belts stop loggin in altogether. Which means it's eviction all over again to look for safe grounds for line members.
---
MER numbers simply don't mean shit if you lack the pilots to man your blingy titans.
---
I care even less about the MER than I do about killboard stats lul
---
I'm not a goon, FYI.
---
Yes once the site is cleared you get to mine a new type of ore. Which anyone can mine.
---
The price thing is a good point, but I'm pretty sure panfam is renting space in Vale, Tribute, Malpais, and Kalevala. Even if GOTG can keep Tenal torched, and the local groups can keep The Spire burnt, that's still 4 rental regions that panfam have. If rental prices get cut in half, and some systems aren't rented at all, I still estimate Panfam would get at least 75b per month per region. 
---
Burning systems is an extremely non-linear thing, so take this with a grain of salt, but to burn down all of panfam's rental regions, it would take roughly 4.5 more months at their current pace. I doubt goons have the stamina to deploy for 5 months every year just to keep panfam's rental regions torched. Even one untouched rental region would bring in at least 900b per year for Panfam, so their losses might even be sustainable, if they can keep their infrastructure cheap enough.
---
Wrong! Wrong! Did I fucking say wrong yet? Don't cherry pick the relic and data sites.  You lose isk in the long term and end up leaving it for you enemies. An example: A level 2 data site in Gurista space with its primary can hacked will still have 7-20m typically left behind. 
---
Yesterday i pulled 30m from two cherry picked data sites in Tribute.  All you do when you cherry pick is lose the isk game and delay the site's respawn time.
---
For ease of use, I think it might be better to combine the weapons that use the same ammo, so there's less repetition (e.g. combine beams and pulse, since 8 of the ten ammos are identical) and simply specify which weapon the T2 ammo types are for (e.g. Aurora is "T2 beam long range" instead of "T2 long range").
---
It also might be nice to have a reference for PvE damage types as well, both for resists and damage dealt! (similar to the [chart on the EVE Uni wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_damage_types), just so that it's all in one place)
---
Forgive my ignorance, but what’s a goon in Eve?
---
But was I wrong?
---
And don't think that I haven't shot *at* Goons during my EVE career. I've spent plenty of time on the other side, and believe me, it wasn't as much fun.
---
It sounds like you may know the game well enough not to get 'screwed' or scammed for the way that you play and those you play with.  Other new or experienced players venturing into something new take big and unforeseen losses all the time (hence all the fun stories). 
---
I don't understand calling any game 'hardcore'. Some people may take an approach that can be described that way, but my opinion is that the game itself is just open, complex, and available to different levels of effort investment by the players.
---
that is true
---
Looking at your antagonizing response (there is always an option to let it go and move on), I would say you're right there with him.
---
Htfu bruh.
---
Yeah yeah whatever...but have you seen the MER?
---
Well, most replies seem to disagree with you.
---
Great Exoo fan.
---
All around nice guy.

---
Whose raging. We're calling you guys out and making fun of you for caring so much, and then going so far out of your way to seem like you don't care. 
---
Its cool man, your side's identity is as elite players who win the ISK war. My side is a bunch of chucklefucks who somehow manage to stumble into victory once in a while in spite of how bad we are.
---
I've been playing solo for 4 days and I'm about ready to give up lol It's seriously boring roaming around in space, maybe shooting a few npc's that the blue chick tells me to do. I've seen videos of fleet commanders and big fights and looks like a lot of fun being a part of team. Struggling to find that (being a part of a team). I'm trying to like this game but man this will be day 5 in a row of applying to "Noob friendly" corps and telling them im new and willing to learn, have mic yadda yadda, getting denied, then sitting on my phone while my ship floats around aimlessly in space for two hours.

He has my vote.

Regardless of being F1 nullsec monkey

No one had any fun? over 130 people in stream making jokes and laughing ?

Honerable PVP \*blinks\*

If you thinking you can beat that with skill, I'm willing to concede you're hardcore.

calm down miner

One of the most fun things I've done was back in 2015. TEST was running a low sec incursion group. They would go to a no-station lowsec system and park all their ships out in space in the pos shields. I managed to get their password and one night whilst they all slept I got my pod in the shields. Stole like 3 Bhaals, 2 Ashis and some Domis. This was back when Bhaals weren't over farmed and pirate ships had a bit more value. Don't think I broke 6 bil with the heist but it was still fun. One of their early bird EU dudes saw me as I exited with the last ship and was asking me to return them. Shit hit the fan on their forums and iirc the group more or less imploded shortly after.
---
someone you shouldn't trust.  They are addicted to the spod and will do anything to get their fix, including scamming the hell out of you.
---
Well, it didn't exactly get funded.
---
I don't think that there are many old timers who don't think EVE needs some change. Hell, I would argue that its us old players that are shouting the loudest for change. But the difference is that we've been around long enough to have a good sense of what will work, while still keeping the parts of the game that make EVE so unique and so different.
---
This entire thread is based on made up numbers v0v
---
There should be a mechanism to directly steal ISK from alliances.
---
Oh my god, 11/10. Love it.
---
I've been playing this game for almost 15 years, and I managed to lose a jump freighter a few months ago. Just because the game is getting easier does not make it easy. It is still very easy to make one small mistep (say docking in a kick-out station) that leads to a major fuck-up. There is little room for error.
---
Oh it’s fun though, some serious stuff gets done sometimes, you arn’t that guy going on trying to compare pirates that ganked his venture to ISIS are you?
---

Ha.

Ewwww, being called a *miner*. Now that's hitting below the belt.

---
Gottem, lmao yeet
---
Good repost, but what if I’ve never played another MMO, except Earth and Beyond?
---
Have you seen the other MMO options in 2019? EVE screws you plenty more than _any_ of them.
---
I'm just saying the time for people logging in their titans once every 6 months when someone tries to pop their moon goo passive income is over. Now for moon goo, you must be able to provide infrastructure, a proper full time defense, active(ish) characters to mine, etc. If people want to be nomadic and pvp, that is still an option. They will now have to work for their isk or create large renter regions.
---
Damn that was funny. Ty kind stranger.
---
tbh if you manage to lose  jump freighter due to personal incompetence  I dont respect what you say.
---
&gt; defensive ratting and mining fleets
---
Ah, yes. The goon version of "putting up a fight".
---
Attacker should get to set the day, but not the exact time. That way you can force a weekend timer but you cant make them wake up at 4am their time to defend their shit

Deleting panic and balancing Rorquals around not having it could work. They do need to be able to tank a while, to be able to give anyone a chance to save them - otherwise, they won't get used. If you can just light cyno and alpha them into next year with bombers, that's also no fun and they'd probably get used a lot less.
---
Oh no what r'u doin to my drones
---
Daw. Fluffy newbros. Don't push them too hard, and see what they want to do instead of going "ey let's do frigate abyss space and make lotsa money".
---
Their first goal is probably going to be to establish some kind of self sufficient identity for themselves. Have they done the career agent missions? What about eve interested them to get into it?

I feel like this is bait. Either way. F for nc bait

You can always arrange fights. Maybe create a Reddit post about it, create an ingame channel, and see who bites for training 1v1s? I suspect if it's newbro oriented not too many people will try to helldunk it. You could always do it in hisec.
---
Then there's a bunch of other little segments that might apply to you lol

I don't lower myself by reading the opinions of the general idiot playerbase

bait what, to kill more of my hard earned structures? This is fucking bullshit. Asset safety doesnt save pods. i cant even get insurance on my structures. This makes zero sense at all.
---
If I ever meet another Eve player I’ll never tell them who I am in game, “just a independent wormhole corp” will be my answer for what corp I’m in, I’d totally talk about any thing else though.
---
Around xmas I was running video slides for a org, for reasons I had to use my personal laptop to start testing the projectors, I had the Permafrost wallpaper up on two 8’ screens for almost a minute while all the band and organizers where setting up, I kinda hoped someone would say hey, but no one did.

Not so much incompetence as indifference. I also fit deadspace mods to assfrigs and T1 cruisers when I fight because, why the fuck not. Its only pixels.
---
But please show me what you actually risk in the game and then I'll respect how "hardcore" you are.
---
Goons have Megathrons, which mean Therm/Kin which means Shield Battleboats are good. We could Rohk them all day with rails and farm them but instead our unnamed FC wants to use jackdaws to "alpha their logi"
---
I dont get it
---
Must be nice going through life in a world where it's all black and white.
---
It's called becoming a director with access to the wallets.  It takes time and effort.
---
I work at a catering company. thankfully our food isn't as salty as this sub.
---
I've only met 2 other players IRL that played Eve.  One was in Goons and always seemed wary of saying anything about in game stuff.  The other was somewhere in droneland and all he talked about was building something or other and how cool it was. (Midwest USA btw)
---
&gt; you cant bring supercarriers into abyssal pvp moron
---
FTFY
---
Lol, I do love this wright up, some of this kind of stuff has happened to me, the fact stuff like this that can happen is why I don’t care to play anything else.
---
I also like technical stuff, spaceships, and explosions, so Eve checks all the boxes.
---
NC/PL's propaganda toolbox contains one item, a hammer named gaslighting, and every situation is a nail
---
I think it's actually the singular reason I actually despise their collective culture
---
Their cheating, cowardice and preying on the weak is just Eve played competitively and I appreciate the challenge they offer, but their propaganda game permanently resides in a place I find it impossible to muster any respect for
---
You used to be able to play Eve [on this](https://static.raru.co.za/cover/2017/11/08/6151526-4-l.jpg?v=1510146288) but then 64bit

Yet that is exactly what happened back in Syndicate as outlined in TFA.

But but.... "Delve is burning !!!1111!!!"

Will mine play it?

the last place someone wanting less blues should go is legacy lmao
---
We know, we've seen your posting.
---
advice, join a group that has the balls to fight and actually defend their space ...
---
Eve isnt a mainstream game, trying to turn it into one is pointless.
---
The game certainly needs change, but it doesnt need to give up everything that makes it unique to appeal to the broadest audience.
---
You know, its fine if somebody starts Eve and quits because they dont like it. As long as some people stay, the game is fine.
---
K you've convinced me along with that EVE in shitty f2p mobile game post.
---
why do people ask this 95% of the time you can run it. Any PC Within the last 10 years can run it.
---
From what I can tell it's because the spawns are easier to manage and there aren't any remote shield boosting structures in the pocket.
---
l thought eve was about killing boars and completing quests
---
I have played Eve with a very similar laptop...big huge battles with lots of ships it will bog down. Other than that you will have fun.
---
Eh, it went way overboard back in the day. I talk like a drunken sailor in a Thai whorehouse all fucking day and all fucking night, but even I drew the line at "rapecage", even though it was the perfect word for it.
---

I'll bite.

Jackdaws are cheap, fast, have good projection, cheap, hit hard for their pricetag, can GTFO if carriers appear, and are cheap.
---
Ok thanks for the comment
---
do you even know what you are saying
---
(*snerk*)
---
Reminds me of an old meme in VS debates when someone asked who would win in a fight between one of the factions from Total Annihilation and literally anyone else. A poster would list all the assets of a particular race or empire, sometimes going into loving detail about their industrial capacity, fleet numbers, and bullshit hax technology, describing how they were preparing everything they had in preparation for the coming war.
---
The end of the post consisted of a lone sentence. The exact wording varied, but the most common example was: "Meanwhile, on a backwater planet, a CORE Commander builds a metal extractor."
---
I take it you have already purchased a Mining Permit. That was a good call...
---
So they both die? Whats the prob?
---
never not hover over 20 systems to find out if it's 1 or 20 active players - a true pain for roaming
---
Well, you know it has to be Fortnight... soo good luck making that place any more terrible.
---
wow. awesome read.
---
I was going to write an effort post explaining this, but I figured it would be lost on you anyways, so its just easier to laugh and say that we've always played to our strengths.
---
Also, love the fight you guys are putting up against us right now.
---
Where's my damn tl;dr . 
---
I'm on reddit, I can only stand to maybe read A paragraph.
---
they can carry thousands and thousands of cap charges, shield command burst themselves, run csb+casb for 100k tank with as many smartbombs as you feel like.
---
they're fine
---
Yes you can but it will run like ass since that PC only has integrated graphics. You need to get a laptop with an actual video card (amd (ati)/nvidia).
---
Also whats the point of having a 16GB pcie hdd? It's not even big enough to install windows on, Go towards an ASUS machine, HP is garbage.
---
Ok, I take it back then, well done.
---
If you don't mind, could you explain what I asked in the second paragraph?
---
You can definitely play it on this. Eve will run on most potatoes.
---
it's a technical term dammit
---
Thanks for the advice, will look into the DPS... but I was able to fit the nos and the 200mm; it's tight, but most of my fits are.
---
And yes, I usually fly with mid-grade Snakes and 3% turret/armor implants.
---
1. Already on it
---
2. Shitposts can't be shitposts unless they're shit
---
Yeah but the issue is, the logi ARE FAX, so i dont get the call at all.
---
I WASSSSSSS making jackdaw bows and the shields, but that isnt happening anymore
---
Honestly here's an unedited recording https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc7z8YDIug4&amp;t=4s see for yourself
---
I'd really like to hope we learned the lesson of the Casino War, have immunized ourselves to the compulsion to overreach at that scale, and that we will be quicker to recognize and react when a change of circumstance results in the tenability of our position eroding as it did when the fozziesov changes made much of our low value sovereignty a pointless burden
---
Well all but one;) yes. On the other hand, TEST gave the area back to provi after that.
---
Being supportive is one thing, being the protective shield something else
---
Thanks, will do!
---
Is it trolling if I have to read like 1000 words by Tuz about why structure bashing totally matters?
---
Or an AMA by some ex goon FC about why he’s now ascended to glory by joining the other blob?
---
If it is I’m missing something. Otherwise it just looks like super cringey sperg.
---
&gt;  we've always played to our strengths.
---
As have we, which is why you have lost more stuff in Delve than you have killed in Tribute since this campaign started. Not saying that your way is wrong or bad, we just don't share the same set of goals in this game.
---
in a wormhole, probably
---
Cheers man :)
---
Absolutely this.  
---
While taking apart someone’s infrastructure is not the most engaging game play, building one from scratch is the definition of awful.  Even more so if you view yourselves as ‘leet pvp’ players.   
---
Goons are simple creatures.  We don’t, for the most part, really mind blowing up ‘the bad guys’ stuff.  Gives us a chance to undock our big toys, anchor up, and blow stuff up.  
---
With a infrastructure, an manpower, and a high level of autism, almost any loss is easy to recover.  If you are missing any of those three you are in a world of hurt.
---
I'll helicopter-dick you for it.
---
Yepp new poe league strats friday anyway. We already got tge unsubscribe ping.
---
I wonder if that was a consequence of # people flying logistic ships now compared to then
---
&gt; Given current statistics about how entire Eve loses no more than 5% of their farm in forms of PvE ships, I don't necessarily see more human ratters dying as a problem.
---
Given current statistics about how many cloaky campers lose their ships, I guess you wouldn't see a system-wide decloaker available as a sov upgrade as a problem either? That would be a good equivalent approximation for how oppresive this would be.
---
Ni ja mine their moons and asset safety the ore.
---
neither is goons, we don't tax mining and ratting taxes are a small part of our income these days
---
it would mean doing like a 10k query's per day it would take multiple months to pull all that data.
---
He is very accurate there.
---
&gt; around and at least pretend to fight back for a couple of months.
---
Yeah and look at how that worked out for you! NC. Is just trying to speed the transformation.
---
&gt; Also, we don't want their space. We just want to destroy everything in their space.
---
And that, ultimately, is why there’s only a token defense where you will only find a fight in favor of the defenders. If you were wanting to actually do anything if real consequence maybe people would care.
---
But you don’t, so nobody gives a shit.
---
[chieftain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chieftain_\(tank\)) tank, for anyone who's wondering
---
dead
---
We are definitely the angry vegans of EVE.
---
Informative as always Blights. That 3v1 with the tormentors was a sick fight too!
---
What?
---
The group has to mine it. That's the work that they seem so unwilling to do. You telling me that a pvp group can't post an OP and blaze down the field for the SRP fund? You might get lucky and get attacked. Yay, the content you claim to crave.
---
It looks awesome, and probably more of an accurate render than you'd think. At that size it would be all but impossible to pick out surface details from the distance needed to see the entire ship like this, they would all blend together into an indistinct pattern like what you have here.
---
Come to think of it, as much as I love seeing gigantic ships that can eclipse suns with their mass, I'm also wondering what made the Iapetan titans necessary to build in the first place. We know that the current titans' doomsday weapons can cause extinction-level events, and having one explode in orbit of an inhabited world will cause an ecological and humanitarian disaster; Iapetan titans can't even get *close* to a planet without doing the same thing via gravitational pull, which puts significant limits on where you can use them if you don't want to wreck the entire biosphere.
---
Furthermore, the utterly ludicrous amount of resources needed to construct one of these mobile planetoids is so prohibitive that I really wonder why the empires didn't construct a larger number of smaller vessels that could be used with more flexibility and in multiple locations.
---
Maybe it was just the Empires getting into a dick-waving contest, I dunno.
---
Everything's better with Hell March. Gotta be one of my favorites from the C&amp;C franchise.
---
To be fair, disadvantageous fight is what we have everyday. It's more rewarding that way isn't it ?
---
But too much is too much.
---
That story of the archon hit close to home! Was actually my first cap. Was not triage fit, but slowcat fit. First battle did not lead to anything major, but the second...if ky power did not fail, my second ever outing would have been B-R. Under the Nulli banner at the time. Would have been glorious!
---
There is a London meet up coming soon I believe
---
I accepted it and decided that I didn't want to be a part of it (again). I did my time in the last war, more time than anyone else did and stayed active instead of going AFK. I did the grind. It's boring. I am having more fun now for sure. :) 
---
Miss you SSTAT guys, tho.
---
For most small groups this is way beyond there ability, so most well died.
---
The Imperium (consisting of Goonswarm, Initiative, and various other smaller groups in Delve and Fountain) is the US, while Panfam (consisting of NC., Pandemic Legion, and Pandemic Horde, and debatably Brothers of Tangra) are the second most powerful. Smaller groups like Guardians of the Galaxy, Legacy Coalition, Fraternity., ect tend to fall into alignment with one of the two most powerful groups
---
 "We make isk to build titans to ~~burn enemies~~  shoot empty undefended buildings. "
---
&gt; low-sec nobodies being payed by an RMT casino camped your entire alliance in station.
---
Man, that’s some koolaidthink.
---
That's fair, they could be defensively fit to stall. Seems like we need a rorq blasting public test to see what a no-PANIC rorq could do. Rorqageddon on sisi and go fro mthere?
---
You overestimate the "losses" too much. A quarter of NCPL players can foot the bill ten times without breaking a sweat, not even mentionning the alliance.
---
But ISK war is dumb in 2019.
---
Goons are winning this war for sure, but there was no hope they would lose anyway.
---
Hi panfam dude sockpuppet account pretending to be a goon. Your bad-faith arguments are obvious.

Haha any evidence? And pls dont link me a battlereport with structures. I get that poco lives matter but on you bill are only or most kills above 500mil and not a fucking vni or a dominix. I suggest if we would list EVERYTHING you where far in feont of us. 
---
Only delve postworthy kills are at 1.2 tril.
---
There's a 1TB 7200RPM SATA listed as well but yeah most of that I'll agree with.
---
Yes. Potato mode will be able to handle at least three clients.
---
If you guys don't want all of these structures then I'm glad that we could help you rid yourselves of them.
---
The issue is that there's one ship, that if you spend enough money on, is so strong that it comfortable beats every single other ship in the game. If we ignore shield fits, which shouldn't take a genius to explain why it's suboptimal, the ship has a literal 100% win ratio against anything other than another Iki.
---
Good video
---
Does highlight everything wrong with eve these days, running what 80 accounts to kill people who are also probably running 80 accounts all because CCP likes to make sure you can hide or run and not be involved in pvp unless you want to be or have 80 accounts.
---
I mean, your rental prices and availability have been available in public spreadsheets for the last 6-7 years too, so I think we have a pretty precise estimate :P
---
Moreover, considering that a non-trivial fraction of the rental activity under the NC/PL umbrella for those 6-7 years have been PVE alts of NC/PL players whose corps maintain... certain image requirements... I think it's a bit disingenuous to dismiss the damage as afflicting another party
---
advice, quit bastion as soon as they leave delve and join goons ...
---
&gt; when goons lose anything “ALREADY REPLACED DELVEVTICKS HURFBLURF”
---
&gt; when literally anyone else loses anything “LOL YOU GUYS ARE SO DUMB LOSSMAILS ARE IMPORTANT”
---
To be honest, there is not much of an infrastructure to begin with, keep in mind most of it is privately owned.
---
Will be helping in the future.
---
In clash of clans you can buy an extended shield timer to keep your base safe from raids.
---
Let’s get rid of multiple timers, and instead if a small guy needs to take a break for a long weekend and has no coverage, he can buy a longer window that lets him set a timer to pop only after he returns. ( gone Friday to Monday?  buy an extension that makes the timer cycle no earlier than next Wednesday).
---
Imagine keepstars. People might need sitter toons again...
---
Gonna ride on that.
---
Imagine spending that amount of isk then placing your modules like that.
---
what did those poor drones ever do to you?
---
My math says that if you have 2:1 losses but can recoup twice as fast we are at a zero sum game.
---
&gt;anything if real consequence
---
*Important* stuff, like killing undeployed ratters?
---
Courently it dosnt 😂
---
They sure are winning, they can't lose with these numbers can they ?
---
But the region upgrades don't really matter, NCPL can fit in 6 systems at the rate goon is doing it, rest are renters. Tribute is pretty much empty these days, and vale lost a lost of renters when we took the systems back. Not sure about Tenal.
---
You're misunderstanding me actually. I'm assuming that the alliance holding the moon would strip the fields as a group activity just like any other op for the sole purpose of funding operations. Not individual miners being taxed or using the moons for personal wallets. Why couldn't groups like SC just mine their moons for their larger organizational needs? I'm still not seeing how passive income is the factor here. Other than it was "easier".
---
Also regarding the PUBG example. You and I may have a different itch than a line member. Most people in my experience are not FC's,empire builders,politicians,diplomats, and spies. The vast majority of pvp players(especially solo) are in it for the fight and thrill of the hunt and nothing more. There are definently more survival/edge of your seat options for pop now than even 5 years ago.
---
Btw, I appreciate your responses, I like the blog. I'm just feeling that there is way more things effecting EVE than just the current mechanics.
---
I can't tell if real toxic edgelord or not. Please take a picture holding up today's newspaper on your Twitter account while frothing at the mouth about Penif Smash trying to get CSM members banned so I know its the real you.
---
How dare you care!
---
Why do you think we had "infrastructures" to begin with ?
---
instanced pvp is pretty lame tbh.
---
I didn’t say the Delve deployments were strategic. It’s for fun, because doing anything in Tribute is toxically boring.
---
Delve is getting defended like Tribute, you guys just brought Titans to grind structures with. Everyone has real fun and the real war continues to be TAPI and WinterCo.
---
I thought about specifying, but I figured anyone who read my post would understand. Clearly, I was
---
&gt; Wrong! 
---
First off, we're talking about **sleeper** data and relic sites here, which are different from pirate faction ones. Second, we're talking about wormholes, which is different from nullsec (although I ran some quick numbers in my head and I think cherrypicking a single can is a losing proposition in w-space too).
---
Sleeper relic sites have giant loot. A single C5 sleeper relic site will fill up a Helios several times over. I don't cherrypick those when I run them because I'm running them with dual Nestors with hacking as filler while I'm killing the rats, and the cans are arranged in a nice ring anyway so I might as well hack as my webbed ass slowly boats by.
---
Sleeper data sites have on the order of 10k isk in their "dud" cans, and there are lots of them. I tend to take anything that's not "Datacore - X Subsystems Engineering", and I finish hacking before I embark on the site's hard waves. If I wanted to take those, I'd still be hacking long after the rats were dead and I could have been working on the next site.
---
There isn't! It's just the one level of debuff which can still lead to a lot of stablemates, which sucks.
---
It's not great, but they would have to be careful adding more debuffs. Ships like the Orthrus can kite all day, increasing debuffs over time could let them stall out opponents and spike damage when it got high enough.
---
Ultimately, it needs a mix of conditions to push people out of a stalemate condition. Smaller arena size over time paired with increased damage over time may be enough?
---
What ship beats a Hyperion 1v1
---
Yeah, that's not how that works
---
CCPLS lurn2history
---
Well I think the issue will be the new ikitursa.. as crazy as it sounds a blinged iki can stalemate another blinged iki even after the damage debuff, which sounds bizarre but it’s a thing that exists. There should be a scaling debuff after like 15 minutes, like a flat 1% debuff per minute after 15 minutes
---
"They will come to you as quick as their ibis's can carry em." Gave me a good laugh.
---
Dunno. After the yacht incident I'm pretty sure Tenal's all bots.
---
If it exists, we make it stop existing.  POCOs, citadels, refineries -- it's all going to burn.
---
LOL 75B per month per region is 300b isk.
---
Three Hundred Whole Billion
---
PER MONTH
---
ahahahaha
---
Yeah you're rich alright. Either that or you have no concept of the amount of isk alliances earn and think that's actually a lot of isk.
---
Who said anything about already replaced? I couldn't give a rat's ass if the shit being lost in Delve is replaced or if they biomass because of it. I still have a home to return to after this.
---
Nope, you're toxic
---
I don't believe we have ever stabbed anyone in the back. We have always been upfront with our allies regarding when and under what circumstances we would be friendly and after those situations played out we would return to neutral standings.
---
Again this comes down to what we enjoy doing in this game and permanent blue-doughnut empire building is not part of it.
---
&gt; Who said anything about already replaced?
---
Sigh.
---
&gt;  I couldn't give a rat's ass if the shit being lost in Delve is replaced or if they biomass because of it. I still have a home to return to after this.
---
So will NC.
---
What the fuck is your actual point?
---
FORTY QUID? ILL SHANK KEVIN FOR HALF
---
I did this in some game where you had little knights that fought other little knights. It was a 3 on three 3 and it was entirely based on what armor you had. 
---
You could buy crates that would give you better armor. I found an exploit and was able to open crates to my hearts content. I found that to find the best armor it was about 5000 crates (which would cost about 10k). Sooo that pretty much ended all my thoughts on RMT games.

time to stop breathing tbh
---
Stopped reading at fair fight.
---
No fight in eve is fair, that’s how you win. Some more so than others, especially if you are going at it alone.
---
This is an MMO, you’re doing it wrong.
---
I mean, grinding structures, killing mindless krabs, aren't we all doing the same thing at the end of the day?
---
Would love to read but jesus man press enter..
---
Dual rep vexor vs 5 thrashers, and you died before you got two cycles? Sounds like you didn't have any buffer in rigs, or enough resists. This was winnable. Honestly I'd call that on the edge of a fair fight, you can permatank 2 or 3. If they were arty fit, and you were able to apply to them, you win.
---
Impossible to avoid gatecamps? Where? I haven't seen a gatecamp in low in ages.
---
In low and NPC null, making isk isn't bad if you've got a fit that can align and warp or crash gate before you're tackled.  Depends how you're makin isk, but when I was making isk in low it was mordus/clone soldier hunting or abyssal sites. In the former case I'm doing that in a pvp fit and would fuck up anyone looking for me.
---
If you're plexing, it's not free isk either. That's what's awesome about lowsec. Everything is one step from a fight.
---
Malware.
---
Well, I'm fairly new, but the draw to Eve has always been the politics and scale of the wars/war efforts, no?
---
I guess if you're using hardcore in the ARPG sense where you lose all of your shit and have to start over, then yeah, Eve's not all that hardcore
---
Yes, in those sites it makes sense. Regular faction sites it literally pisses me off.
---
3rd rock from the sun.
---
&gt;'disgusting shit'
---
1 cycling sites is disgusting yea.
---
&gt;high investment, high risk, high reward. 
---
High end dread ratting is yea. Otherwise you just solo krab for 2 hours in your dread is paid off easily after insurance. 
---
If you try to get anywhere close to dreads profit wise you need to put way more on field assuming 
---
&gt;are a huge problem for ganking high class ratters
---
Like I said earlier it's he said she said. Do we have the numbers on just how many ships get away just due to MJDs specifically? Are you ***owed*** kills. How much safety are battleship ratters owed for their low isk/hr and investmet for that? Which ships would you put scrams on? 
---
Ratting battleships die all the time in w space, so how do you quantify what is a good increase?
---
The best advice I can give is to try the official Forums recruitment area.  Find a Corp that fits your interest and time zone.  Talk to them, find thier recruitment channel and talk to thier people.

A thanatos since you aren't restricted to single same class ships.

They'd need another power to jump in with them, and TEST has its own war. We're just killing both side's renters/bots and enjoying the shitposting.
---
I miss when blue donuts were smaller and there were more opportunities to batphone out of this kind of shit. Since everyone's already taken a side, nobody has any batphones.

go to wormholes, join a group
---
wormhole society, opsec, they usually have something going on
---
wormhole fights are the best fights
---
IWI got butthurt because a few directors in SMA got into a pissing match with their directors.
---
IWI paid a bunch of low-sec mercenaries, nul-sec randos and anyone else who had a beef with the CFC to camp SMA in and do hit-and-run sov wanding in interceptors.
---
WWB was payed for by IWI.
---
As soon as the war ended CCP dropped the banhammer on IWI and everyone involved because of, to quote CCP "large-scale Real Money Trading", seized 40 trillion ISK and made casinos illegal.
---
Where am I wrong?
---
I guess the nice thing about test winning a few objectives lately with some big feeds is that we fought.
---
I only got one cycle off, maybe i should have gone with a trimark rig? I don't know, and i somehow doubt it would have made much difference. The problem is having so short time to react that i couldn't even get my drones out before i was dead.  
---
Low sec gatecamps aren't bad, but there's still a bunch around, i'm mostly talking about nullsec. Sometimes you can dodge them, but if you get caught with unlucky timing, aka trying to warp exactly when it's deployed, you're screwed. Especially since you don't get a message for the warp failing and you're just wondering why the ship isn't warping, until the bubble is fully covering you.  
---
I don't mind there being risk, i just mind risk being super onesided, where people with the right resources and right amount of people have no risk, while new players, less experienced, or solo players are totally screwed over very quickly. It kinda makes it easy for me to see why people don't hold on for long.
---
I would prefer to have ESS actually implemented properly and none of this fully spawned anom BS. 
---
Then add a new mining ESS that gets launched for corp and is invulnerable until 24 hours after the next moon pull is mined-out/despawns, and comes out of reinforcement in a 1 hour window of the defender's choice but the timer shows the start of the window so at any second during the hour window, it can come out of reinforce. It would store the taxed ore in a citadel of your choice in system, and hostile ESS can asset safety the ore.
---
nice haha
---
&gt; And maybe that's the problem
---
*narrator*

---
USTZ is really risk averse everywhere. Thankfully there are a few corps around with my mentality in Frat USTZ, so if I show up at their door with 10-15 guys I get a decent fight. Past that it's whaling or bot hunting.
---
But shouldn't the game strive to be more enjoyable for more people? I'm not saying every fight has to be fair, but it's frustrating that it's so hard to get a 1v1 or something with even slightly fair odds.
---
Elo is defending anyone dumb enough to kiss his boots. At least people around this war zone give me fights.
---
To 1-cycle a site you need a good warpin, and 6 caps on field (except for in a RG where you can sometimes get away with 5). There's nothing disgusting about it.
---
As for the battleships, I've never claimed we're entitled to kills. However if you want to run the highest value sites in the game (and even tinker snakes in a C5 are better isk/he than almost every form of income in null) you should be forced into some sort of risk.
---
Any ratting BS that dies is either not watching D-Scan or they're just unbelievably bad. If you're any good at it it's basically risk-free.
---
thank you!
---
It most definitely will fuck your shit up.
---
Lmao this is probably the biggest lie on r/eve
---
You ran just as fast as PANFAM
---
I'd like to preface this by asking: Can you show us the lossmail that led to this?
---
&gt;There's not ever a single fair, and thereby fun fight in this game.
---
Well...yeah. Battles aren't won by playing fair, they're won by finding every advantage you can and exploiting it. Maybe you'd be better served by trying to find advantages to exploit rather than expecting everyone else to hobble themselves to give you a "fair fight".
---
&gt;Want to go to fw complexes? Get jumped by 5 thrashers killing you within 10 seconds tho you're in a dual repped vexor.
---
I want to see the lossmail that generated this, because even with my shit skills I could still win that fight. I mean, dual reps? Against only 5 Thrashers? And you say *they* dropped *you*?
---
&gt;Want to make isk in low or nullsec? Constantly deal with people trying to jump you or gatecamps that are impossible to avoid.
---
1. That's risk for you. No ISK without rISK.
---
2. If you have a problem with "impossible to avoid" gatecamps, try the MWD+Cloak trick, a neutral hauler alt trained in DSTs, using a delivery service like PushX, or any combination of the above.
---
&gt;Want to make isk in high sec? you'll bore your brains out.
---
Well, yeah. Highsec isn't intended to be the place you stay in forever. It's a starting place for new players and a place for experienced players to buy and sell with a reasonable degree of safety.
---
&gt;Bubbles instantly unfolding although visually they haven't caught you yet.
---
Okay, so act as though you're bubbled the moment the interdiction probe/mobile warp inhibitor pops on grid. And, again, I'd love to see the lossmail for this.
---
&gt;Not docking to stations instantly when trying to warp to 0 and dock. I mean having 5 seconds before docking is pretty bad. And no I don't want to waste my time doing workarounds like instadocking bookmarks.
---
Warping to a station shouldn't be safe. Nothing in EVE should be safe. The main draw of EVE is that nothing undocked is safe. Also, I haven't had a 5-second drift to the docking ring in over a year, 9 times out of ten when I warp to a station I instantly dock and the 10th time I'm only vulnerable for \~2-3s, not enough time for even the most dedicated gankers to do anything.
---
&gt;Why do i have to press V all the time when i want to dscan? there's no point in it not being automatic, everyone is using it all the time anyway.
---
Again, lossmail. And this feature exists because otherwise Dscan would just be local with a range limit. It would also prevent you from using Dscan to hunt people down, a perfectly good mechanic as-is.
---
&gt;So many moments of frustration in this game, and there's not really much to compensate for it. Especially if you don't have the patience to wait for hours for a fair pvp fight.
---
I'm curious, if you don't have the patience to wait an hour or so for the perfect fight (rather than, you know, taking every fight that looks even roughly even and having a good time regardless) then how do you have the time to wait days, weeks, or months to train into fits?
---
Oh, right, injectors exist. Because credit card warriors will always be a thing.
---
Hear hear.

I've played Conan Exiles for a few months last summer. On a quiet server, but with a fair share of griefers and gankers. I wasn't envolved in any of that, played the game for building only. Similarly, I've played Elite:Dangerous for a couple of years - they also have plenty of player killers etc. 
---
One thing I found funny was when people were complaining how terrible others were, or that I was so calm about getting killed and losing stuff. After a decade of EvE - all that is really lightweight. After being self-relient with my own logistics in EvE during hostile space take-overs, where I would risk everything I had made in years - being careful in Conan and not risking more than I was prepared to lose - was damn easy. And in Elite - losing 15% of the total cost of the ship+fit when killed... that is 85% less than in EvE.
---
Or when they try to smack-talk to someone... after me being in one local with Tri, Test, Goons for years and years...

The "evil" and "toxic" players there have no idea what evil or toxic means.

Take the guns off them, and people would fight over them all the time.

Nope. The contraband mechanic is yet another half-baked mechanic from CCP that never amounted to anything.
---
Great.

What’s your point? Structures are still cheap and easy to spam. As a goon, you should know that.

---
Main dps + ewar backup
---
Hauler + scout/escort
---
Yeah, you guys don't so much stab people in the back as much as you just kind of slink out into the night while your "allies" house is burning down around them.

Ask Test about what great allies PL were in the Fountain war.

That's the kind of non-sequitur trollbaiting I'm referring to - both the person you're describing and you shoehorning it in here.

It's just internet "look-at-me-ism" and it's prolific on most the public channels in any game with a f2p option.  It makes them largely unreadable.

Got a Killmail for us to look at? Did you agreed first on a gate and take damage from gate guns?
---
Would be useful to see more of the details
---
I just watched your video properly and see what what you were getting at with the tax thing. Sick video I honestly don't know how I missed it when it was posted.
---
You're right about the war thing, but personally I've just viewed as a lack of willingness to mine on the part of NC/Panfam dudes more than a keenness on the goon side. For goons they're PVE tryhards so they'll do it no matter what, for groups like PL and NC it's a chore to be minimised.

will you ever do an interview in TEST comms if you were allowed to? :D

Exooki probably best candidate since noobman and those are tough shoes to fill

I've thought about it a few times, but i'm kinda afraid to deal with mostly super blinged out abyssal fits.

We have a history

I respect people who disagree with me or the points i make, but people in the community with attitudes like this is also one of the reasons i get tired of eve.
---
There sometimes makes mistakes
---
I don't think cloaky campers have to take an inherent risk. Eve is based on a risk/reward balance. The higher the reward in a region of space, the higher the risk is. The reward is there in the form of PvE income. The risk is there in the form of dying (to harder NPCs or to other players). The game design is supposed to be like if you do PvE in hisec, you die less but get less money. And the opposite for null and wormholes. That and only that is what I'm talking about, in terms of risk/reward. That's the balance that needs to be actively maintained and protected by CCP.
---
When nullseccers apply the concept of risk to their hunters, they are just misunderstanding everything about the very concept we are talking about. Firstly, the cloaky camper is not making money off the environment (in fact, is losing money) by camping you. Secondly, whoever using the cloaky camper chooses to get into a PvP interaction with you. The risk hunters take is entirely emergent. You can blap them, you can make it hell for them, or you can die. CCP doesn't need to introduce and maintain risk factors for campers. That is particularly true if you already accept my claim that null PvE is too safe. If null PvE is too safe, and you make the lives of hunters of PvE ships riskier, you actually make PvE even more safe. That'd be against the very risk/reward balance CCP needs to actively maintain. So unless you think PvE is too risky, you have no reason to argue to make it even safer.
---
Outside of the abyss you can smoke an iki 1v1 with a vigilant running EC-600s.   Tested multiple times several different iki fits various levels of bling.  If you could get the vigilant through the site you could eat them there too.

---
I don't generally recommend joining one of these big newbie corps right away, but since that's what you were already trying to do, I figured I might as well assist. Note: I found those links by *literally googling eve + the name you listed*.
---
I get as many 1on1's that I have time for in FW. Just avoid the obvious traps. Plenty of people that want 1on1's. I think you're a bit rusty. Learn HOW to avoid gatecamps (most can be avoided), use d-scan, learn whats bait etc etc. 
---
Also: 5 thrashers vs a vexor? Sounds like a fun fight tbh!

---
I of course still appreciate constructive criticism, ideas/whatever.
---
Agreed! Even before Iki you'd end up with a lot of stalemates, such as a /u/gatorgrips and his beatiful Caracal ransoms on slow blingy ships, or when two cancer Vagabonds encounter each other and can't break each other's tank. It's why I stopped PVPing in the abyss. I don't want to get involve with it until a better stalemate resolution system is in place as its a horrible way to end a fight.
---
It feels like shortsightedness on CCP's part to not see how the Iki would clearly the #1 ship in the abyss when the Vedmak was already so dominant. It really needs a stalemate rule revisit.
---
I make billions a month doing exploration in null sec.
---
We ran to lowsec because staging a defensive war against those numbers is impossible when our staging station could be ref'ed so easily. Personally, I was not happy with the decision to pull back to Hakonen, but it was the right call. We still stayed and fought a guerrilla war for months, knowing that it was futile, which is more than can be said for NCPL.
---
We have a Keepstar highway from 1DQ to Branch. Good luck with that.
---
A solo player can absolutely do non-highsec content. Is it worth it? Depends on the activity, but *in general* yes. Can you do non-highsec content in a system where people are actively out and looking for PVP content? Of course not. You're prey at this point, and you have to think like it if you want to succeed.
---
10/10 would read again

SMA did fuck all to defend Fade. Goons sent carriers and such, but it didnt really help that much and SMA leadership continued to claim it was all fine. FCs didnt do much but tell everyone to run their own fleets. It was sad. Anyone says says any different is just repeating EX River's verbal diarrhea.

Absolutely.
---
To convince TEST to vote for me? Or to publish?

A vedmaks counter was the curse.. an ikit’s counter can be a curse but to fit enough neuting power to break the regen on one in a reasonable time you have to gimp the fit to the point it’s unusable/dies to everything else. So now we’re truly in a time where there’s nothing better to fly than the ikit, and it’s just a matter of how blinged the others is and whether they can get enough lucky wrecking hits in a row to win. But some of the fits I’ve seen can easily tank 3k+ dps from another ikit, so even with the flat -25% debuff they can comfortably tank the enemy iki
---
The helios is dope, get into it. Make sure you have the scanning rigs, 1 of each scanning upgrade in your mids and a relic analyzer or combined unit like the clavicula.
---
Do your wh thing but keep an eye out for a null wh and scan for relics in null. You take anyhing you find in the wh then go cruise through null. Don't bother with data sites and if you really want to min/max you replace a scanning upgrade with a cargo scanner and cherry pick the containers.
---
Gee, I'm sorry. Would you like a hug and a cup of coco? I am a very toxic individual so I often cause feelings in others that I don't understand. Please accept my most groin-felt apologies. Namaste.
---
Or you can man-up and meet me at the Sun in Jita, Nancy.
---
You like killing stupids, we like making you homeless. It's a good balance, I think.
---
Ive never met another eve player thru random talk about the game, and I live in the middle of nowhere Indiana
---
My advice is always to go to the providence nullsec region because of the nrds ruleset
---
&gt;I'm playing solo, i should mention. And maybe that's the problem
---
tbh it is, every single thing you mentioned would be a ton more fun with someone, but like you I also play solo since I left null life and just came back for this invasion patch to check it out. 
---
Join some NPSI communities for a change, maybe you click with someone.
---
&gt;There's not ever a single fair, and thereby fun fight in this game
---
Yes there are, hard to find but I understand the frustration
---
&gt;Want to make isk in low or nullsec? Constantly deal with people trying to jump you
---
I mean you are in low/null you should expect that
---
&gt;or gatecamps that are impossible to avoid
---
I lost my first praxis the other day to one, I could have avoided it with gatechecker I guess but where is fun in that?
---
&gt;Want to make isk in high sec? you'll bore your brains out
---
before joining nullsec alliance for fist time back in WWB I used to do standard and superior sleeper caches in higsec for isk, it was fun as hell because it was new content and really nice haul but like everything PVE it becomes pita because you have done it hundred of times and you lose interest
---
&gt;Why do i have to press V all the time when i want to dscan? there's no point in it not being automatic, everyone is using it all the time anyway
---
Imagine all those afk krabs and bots in nullsec having automatic dscan every few seconds and how much strain would that have on TQ
---
&gt;Especially if you don't have the patience to wait for hours for a fair pvp fight
---
Try Spectre fleet for a change if you are tilted about not fair and solo pvp, I used to fly with them ages ago and had the best moments in EVE with those guys, there is not many people roaming solo these days in EVE so if you do go out searching you might spend hours just jumping around
---
Where theres a will...
---
Remember all those times you blew up the old Outposts and looted all the enemies' assets?
---
No? Me neither.
---
Not a bad fit. The reactive armor being replaced by another energized adaptive nano membrane could have made a difference. 
---
Though I’m inclined to think you weren’t expecting or used to the damage and didn’t preemptively activate your repairers
---
Happens to me when I’m flying something I haven’t much experience with
---
Would you please explain the nrds rule set or link to an expiation?
---
Thank you for the helpful reply.
---
Except all those changes made for new players, that make it worse for the vets, without actually helping new players.
---
I'm definitely not a credit card warrior if that's what you're trying to imply? Sorry if i'm misunderstanding. Waiting for months outside of the game is very different to waiting ingame imho. You can go around do your daily activities w/e while not using much time, all you have to is pay for game time or play a few days to get a plex. I know they've tried to pursue a sort of faster gratification with abyssal sites, and i honestly think they should do more stuff like that. They still seem balanced when it comes to risk so it's just a way for people to not spend all day in game to make isk or whatever.  
---
Anyway some other points.  
---
killmail here since you're interested.  
---
I figure that's the thing with bubbles, but still it's pretty frustrating that it's the way they work. There should be a better consistency between the visual and the actual thing happening imo.  
---
well i hadn't had a 5 second drift either until i had a suspect timer in a pod. Very unlucky timing. Plus i didn't dock even tho i was within 1500m? Oh well.  
---
I mean you could still make it directional even though the refresh is automatic. I just find it annoying having to press a button repetitively 1000's of times in a day.
---
Strange. I have found a completely different experience after coming back a few months ago. 
---
I never pvped much in Eve so when I came back I decided to force myself into it. I got started in a rocket condor and got a few kills solo and swapped to a TD scram kitey slasher. 100 solo slasher kills later and I’m having a fucking blast in FW. 
---
Yeah, you have to work it. You have to constantly Dscan and check zkill to avoid the bait but it’s super satisfying to get those kills. 
---
I can’t get a single friend to try eve out and play ffxiv on the side with them but I still find a shit ton of enjoyment playing eve a few hours a day solo roaming FW and way too much on weekends. 
---
Maybe I’ll hit the wall when I eventually ship up to cruiser but idk.
---
Hah, sure. Kicking holding corps to hide structure loses from your alliance kb technically means it's still green. But it's not fooling anybody. We know who those losses belong to.
---

Easily.
---
Well said
---
Go to lowsec and null instead of WH
---
Using local you can immediately know if someone's in the system.
---
Do NOT ignore data sites.
---
Learn how to navigate safely, make bookmarks, gate perches for systems you visit frequently, safespots and turn 60mil/h profit easily. The better your skills become the better money you make per hour (faster hacks, scans etc.).
---
NRDS means Not Red Don't Shoot afaik.
---
Nobody  should hunt or shoot you if you're neutral.
---
What kind of fucking retard compares outposts to citadels?
---
Remember all those times you blew up a POS and looted all the assets?
---
Yes? Me too.
---
It doesn't stop them getting steam rolled at all it just drags out the pain of the inevitable.
---
NRDS = Not Red Don´t Shoot
---
Provibloc (which live in Providence) have this policy in place and it basically means as long as you do not shoot anything there you have nothing to fear from the local residents. If you start shooting there you will end up on a KOS (kill on sight) list and not be welcome anymore by the locals.
---
The NRDS policy of course doesn´t safe you from roaming gangs, solo pvpers or anyone going there to kill things. Provi is basically NullSec Light.
---
It's a great way to make money and always has been, also very beginner friendly and good fun for most. If you don't like it, try something else
---
Lol ya I bet no one in eve would ever try to shit on new players
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEgThIUyfOA I started here. I am up to my tenth Caracal but I have learned to pilot well enough to do all the flavors T1-T2 filaments reliably. It's a kitting ship. I am hoping to be able to do the 1v1 and try to collect ransoms.
---
It's almost like r/eve went to shit and filled with krabs :thinking:
---
Lol I lost a 350m+ Stratios to a highsec ghost site last week cause I got sloppy and missed that that was what I was running.
---
I have been doing exploration as backup income when beeing cloaky camped. I prefer to go to npc nullsec ( to not collide with blues from neighbouring systems) and look for relic sites. Its always RNG but if you search reddit there has been a post which compared the different Regions (nps wise) for their average output.
---
Maybe someone here finds the link.
---
Just my 2 Cents.
---
Fly safe and have fun mate
---
The big optimizations for earning via exploration are speed of hacking, and quality of sites. The latter is improved just by hunting in nullsec. To improve speed, the best way is to get skills and modules good enough that allow you to bash through the firewalls and defenses. This is most easily accomplished with the Zeugma integrated analyzer. It can hack both data and relic sites. Then you get a 'Blackglass' hardwire, which greatly increases strength of your virus at the cost of durability. Finally, add rigs to increase virus strength. The result is you can get 60 strength on your virus, meaning you 1-shot most of the defenses and 2-shot everything else. As such, you can basically spam through any have without fear of failure. This means you have very quickly, and can hack more cans per hour and thus get more isk/hr.
---
I’m sure you’ve already looked up the info on wormhole sites, but just in case. Be sure to only go to the data and relic sites with some kind of faction name, like Sansha, or serpentis, or guristas, etc... The other data and relic sites have rats that will kill you.
---
And as for every wormhole has a Corp. If what your saying is that every wormhole has structures built in it that doesn’t necessarily mean there is a Corp living in there. A lot of people have what is called a bearhole where they have a few alts in an astrahaus and use it to farm isk for their main. Most wormholes have structured in them yes, but much fewer have active people in them. 
---
Remember to always be checking d-scan while traveling and hacking. And if your concerned you can warp on grid with the structure in system and see if anyone is online inside. There is a number in brackets of how many inside when you click on the station in space.
---
Not red don't shoot. As long as your neutral you will have access to the citadel network to tether and scan and there is a market hub in provi and it's 1 jump from high sec all these make relic hunting even as an alpha great isk the only problem you might have is competition from other relic hunters
---
&gt; IWI got butthurt because a few directors in SMA got into a pissing match with their directors.
---
Hard to say an opinion is wrong but if that’s how you feel, it’s how you feel.
---
&gt; IWI paid a bunch of low-sec mercenaries, nul-sec randos and anyone else who had a beef with the CFC to camp SMA in and do hit-and-run sov wanding in interceptors.
---
It’s fascinating that it came to be called WWB though, since apparently it was just some Lowsec mercs and nullsec randos. I wonder how they drove the games most powerful group to leave their home.
---
&gt; WWB was payed for by IWI.
---
IWIs payments formed a significant reason for sone groups to get involved. For others it was simple a chance to offer the CFC a much needed lesson in Goon history from a different perspective and a chance for the CFC to humble itself and reform. Which it did.
---
&gt; As soon as the war ended CCP dropped the banhammer on IWI and everyone involved because of, to quote CCP "large-scale Real Money Trading", seized 40 trillion ISK and made casinos illegal.
---
There’s some weird conflation here, as well as some suggestive wording regarding the timing but that’s pretty normal now since that’s been passed around.
---
Raging incompetence doesn't mean the game isn't getting softer though?
---
Lol it's 2019, Eve is the only hardcore game left. I come back to Eve every few years for the hardcore experiences.
---
You're fucked now, last couple years this sub's been filling with the same incompetent f1 monkeys that CCP started catering to.
---
God damn, I spent so much time ratting my ass off in b-r back in the days of ISS/Sylph. Got a nightmare bpc out of there once, good times.
---
Here's the original announcement for its launch. I haven't used it though.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8j2hnr/never_lose_another_training_clone_clone_guard_app/
---
Octane is a HD Accelerator and not a SSD Drive itself... pretty underwhelming compared to a native SSD
---
Remember those times you didn't need to defend your outposts because your stuff was always safe and accessible? 
---
EVE used to only be "free" if you played on a limited time trial, but do bitch more about how CCP letting you play free forever without constantly having to make a new account is unfair and mean.
---
Speed of scanning is of equal importance imo.
---
I look for the sites that are NOT Unsecured or Forgotten. Per the chart [HERE](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_site#Is_this_site_.22safe.22_to_warp_to.3F).
---
I did a few when they were released. I prefer roaming and creating a situation where I’ve killed a vni or something and they get pissed off and chase me.
---
From what I’ve seen there is a very restrictive meta in abyssal space so it doesn’t take long to run out of options and start throwing ISK at your fit to gain an edge.
---
The only thing it has going for it is the guaranteed 1v1
---
as lame as blobing people In non instancied pvp.
---
I've only met two other Eve players organically, one Spectre Fleet member and another High-Sec carebear.
---
Rapecage is a very official and technical term, and if anyone disagrees they should pilot their titan into a rapecage (ingame ofc)
---
Not really
---
Thanks!  I wrote that (I was the one that flew the Lif) the week following the events.  When I saw this reddit post and the vid you posted from the fight, I had to copy our internal post here.
---
Come to EvE Toronto or ENE in August and when you see someone from TDSIN, they'll find someone to sing it for you . . .
---
Well, none of the "authorized" residents will shoot. But it is also an extremely popular roaming destination so you can trust anyone, especially if you are not a member of a group with access to the KOS list.
---
Imho exploration is a good way to start but only in the beginning because it's quite boring.
---
If you don't want to join some nullsec corp try to different things, the game has so much to offer that is a crime to limit yourself to exploration, try missions, and when you have enough skill points and money you can try to make DED complexes or incursions in hi-sec (there are several groups that organize them and are free for all, you just have to fly the right ship with the right configuration).
---
Imho for a single player DED is the best way to make money, but is much easier and profitable if you are in a big group with a lot of people selling DED bookmarks.
---
Consider also PI, it's a great way to make passive income, for a basic setup you only need a couple of weeks of skill training (add 1 month for advanced PI setup).
---
With an advanced setup you can make more than 400M isk every 20 days per character, and it requires really low effort.
---
ec-600 die easy, and I'm not sure how a vigilant kill an Iki actually, even outside abyss In low cost fit, not even talking Into the pvp room.
---
A lovely group of rogues who inspire jealousy in all who see them.  Also followers of the great Mitani (PBUH)
---
You seem upset about people not receiving nothing but praise, fella.
---
I have never known it any different.
---
If you look at the kills it's an npsi group with heavy snuff and volta involvement of which nc/pl members make up around 20/30 percent.
---
Hi 5 brother.
---
I would ignore some of the data sites, such as the ones that have the cans like 75 KM away from each other and you land like 120 KM away from the beginning.
---
Yep your doing good then.
---
Damn those Venture !
---
Because it's Reddit and anything typed here doesn't matter because of downvotes/upvotes
---
Whenever you think of a change like this, its always best to look at it from another angle. Instead of thinking about how you'd fix it, ask yourself how you could *break* it.
---
That being said, I like the idea of citadels having a progressive fuel cost as more are powered up. You could have the exact way it increases change with sec status, favoring either polar (1 or -1) or median (0.0 exact) securities. This creates a soft limit on citadels that are in use, and while it makes it harder to establish a beachhead, it costs the defender a lot more than a hard cap would due to them having to pay the bulk of the fuel bill.
---
You're right, it's still eve, so stay always alert and use dscan looking for probes if there's someone in local :)
---
Actually even cheaper than jump fuel is the terrible koolaid they keep feeding you guys.
---
Theres literally nothing interesting to do that involves fighting goons doing things like this. Enjoy grinding structures and shit. You don’t even know why you are actually doing any of this when it very obviously has no point.
---
What do you expect to happen? Panfam to feed it’s entire superfleet *and* lose its structures *and* quit the game or join goons?
---
To be fair, most regions are full of bots right now.
---
Classic.
---
WoW Brandnew idea!  
---
Villore Accords is recruiting. Join us and learn to know the power of Atrons...
---
~900dps from range and damage bonuses blasters and a 90% web.  Even the new 5sec jams were plenty to allow the tank to catch up and force the iki to respool.  600s are the medium ones.  More hp and a higher chance to jam.  If he focused the drones even better because the object was simply to keep its dps off me for a few second here and there.  10 seconds of unanswered dps is HUGE.  That's two jams under the new rules.  Or roughly how long it takes to target and kill 5 medium drones.
---
#truth yes people have plexed their way into a titan from scratch, but they sure as hell didn’t know how to play that, got killed, for frustrated, and quit. Wasted 5 grand of real money
---
Did small groups have passive income from moon goo before the change?
---
&gt; Sick video I honestly don't know how I missed it when it was posted.
---
&gt; You're right about the war thing, but personally I've just viewed as a lack of willingness to mine on the part of NC/Panfam dudes more than a keenness on the goon side.
---
Eve has 40ish null regions. Suppose it had 40 regions divided by "titan ranges" (in effect its less). Call each of these ranges an "umbrella". It also has 250kish players in corps that hold sov in null.
---
Right now you can fit 100kish of those 250k people in 1 umbrella out of 40, and address their farming needs (basing the number on how utilized I think Delve systems are). And there is literally no reason not to. The more people you stack, the better your defenses will be, the safer your Rorquals will be, the more capitals you farm, even more members you get, even safer you get. Plus, if you have the largest umbrella, nobody will contest it head on, diminishing people's ability to actually attack your PvE ships. What this creates is huge groups of people flocking, less importantly under same alliances, but under same region, same infrastructure, to get rich while depending on one another. They have no reason to be in a smaller alliance, or the alliance has no reason to selectively recruit. We then end up in a situation which one side is uncontestably bigger than the rest of Eve.
---
Under my anom respawn rework proposal, you could only fit 10kish people in the same umbrella. That means people need to spread to 25 umbrellas to do farming (assuming optimal efficiency, in effect maybe 30ish). Then again, the proposal also mathematically guarantees 1/3 of all systems (13 umbrellas) to be empty. This means that while people can still be in the same coalition, they won't depend on one another for PvE safety. This is all that matters, because for citadel/timer safety, it all works in a different way because of batphone mechanics. So at the very least, you won't have these groups of 50k people depending on one another, in the same boat. When that is ensured, people can change allegiances if they want to. Or you can apply pressure to one part of the bloc, instead of having to face all the bloc. Which is exactly what happened in WWB.  And in this system, selective recruiting would have to come back because you'll want the best of the best people in your 10k-sized umbrella.
---
So all in all, the way I see it, "farms and fields" is what's essentially behind whats happening today. "Elitist alliances not wanting to mine", or things that you care about more like "removal of passive farm" has a secondary effect, not primary (although still important).
---
Technically yes, so long that you DO NOT use the 64 bits client. And you’ll also have to fly around in Potato quality, but I suppose you shouldn’t expect anything higher :)
---
Yeah the Tama - Nourv gate is one of the most infamous gates in Eve. Probably want to steer clear of it as a solo player.
---
Remember all those times you docked you titan in a outpost to have it magically appear in low sec for a small fee when you lost your sov?
---
Don't get to caught up with corps in WH space, most of them are AFK, you can warp to the structures to see if there is anyone docked up (Helios would make this a lot safer).   
---
Be careful of WHs with HS statics, especially if they are close to trade hubs  
---
Forget about data sites they suck.   
---
Get Astrometrics and the other scan skills to IV for now (Astometrics V will change your life). The faster you scan, the faster you find sites.
---
Well cool you have 900 dps but the iki tanks comfortably over 1500 dps before the stalemate timer, and ~1500 dps after the stalemate timer, at which point you'd already be dead.
---
&gt; With a infrastructure, an manpower, and a high level of autism, almost any loss is easy to recover. If you are missing any of those three you are in a world of hurt.
---
so we should all just not have fun in order to keep playing eve? Compelling.
---
So i tried it and tried changing a web for an afterburner. However i just got 9 people this time, so not much luck there either. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77135082/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77135082/)
---
I'm talking about stockpiled wealth
---
Can't say you're wrong, got any tips for finding the proper corp though?
---
1) relic sites are RNG you can get big money or garbage. As a new player you have 0 forms of consistent income which will always pay out huge.
---
2) wormhole diving is not your best option for relic sites as a noob because you immediately handicap yourself with no local being so inexperienced and you can get plenty of sigs which turn out to not be what you want.
---
You want to make money doing relic sites? Go to the Null sec regions where Sansha and Guristas pirates reside. That will be your best possible isk from loot drops. 
---
Also you are going to die. Don’t be afraid of it. Your ship costs less than 1 relic site so if you do this you will easily net a profit. Exploration is probably the best way and least skill intensive way to make money while still enjoying the game as an alpha or new player.
---
Is it not obvious? I'll ask a question then. What if the massacre (and financial ruin) of those who are not participating in the deployment was intended from the beginning? Does fat need to be trimmed?
---
Few minutes ago i managed to get from Goon Home system to the North in my carrier.
---
I did not expect it, but i made 38 jumps in my Nidhoggur safe and sound. Not thats a hell of a war deployment. Who needs Move ops ?
---
Goons are ruining Eve :))
---
P.S. i am a Goon
---
Btw   ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  happens during the video :)
---
Cool thanks! Is there a csv somewhere? I am lucky enough to do this for a living so I might be interested in playing with this. 
---
I see some large outliers in the bottom right chart out at 30k and 40k kills, but they do not appear in the table in the bottom left. Am I missing something? What happened on those huge days anyway, surely there was a historical battle invasion or something on at least one of them.
---
And i streamed it live
---
I second this. Most of these issues are avoidable except for the High sec being boring.
---
Less than you'd think, especially if you ask.
---
&gt; Mitani
---
Use wormhole to get to null, do explo there. Don't bother focusing on wh for explo sites. Unless you get a hole from some dead lowsec pocket into a wormhole with only one connection out and a ton of sites its likely either relatively high traffic or camped already.
---
The biggest improvements you will see from skills happen at Astrometrics 5 simply because of how big the bonus is (but also t2 probe launchers for a cheaper than sisters but more effective than t1 launcher.) Hacking/arch 3 for access to the frostline analyzer. Hacking/arch 5 for access to the Zeugma analyzer. Cybernetics 5 for access to the blackglass implant. And finally from racial frigate 5 for access to covert ops ships that have better exploration bonuses than the t1 frigates (you can use an astero to end run this train but the eventual bonuses to exploration only are smaller than covops 5.)
---
Keep in mind those are not in order of fastness to train or biggest benefits.
---
Flair baiting goons telling people to quit eve to make blue donuts smaller is not new kiddo.
---
You mean NullSec Right
---
Lesson learned. Any good systems you know of?
---
You are looking in the wrong places. Set your destination to Samanuni, and enter Black Rise from there and make your way to Kinakka or some other system where u saw a  solo kill on zkill. Dscan plexes. Take fights where u know u have a chance. If u figure out person in ship, check zkill for fit and stuff, plan accordingly on how to engage.
---
Tama is a really bad place to take a solo brawling cruiser looking for a winnable fight.  Several pirate groups live there or within a couple of jumps of there, so you're going to get batphoned on every single time.
---
Try wandering slightly less populous systems (Heydieles, Abune, Pynekastoh, other shit further afield) and waiting for a roaming gang to try their luck.  It'll take longer to get a fight, but you may actually win.
---
Iki sensor strenght Is like 24, Its hard to ecm actually (Me and Gustav spend the 10mn our Iki mirror to drone war,I think 3 jams happened on that time). If you go with a 900 dps fit at web range, you'll be at the mercy of Iki's occult, and he got strong t2 resist and an assault damage control, while you get the basic resist and 6 low slot without decent fitting.
---
Lets ignore curse, shield fits, any implants and you right ofc!
---
Optane is Minmatar engineering, it's duct-taping a small SSD to an HDD in order to turn it into a hybrid drive.
---
Honestly I almost kinda think they knew this would happen with the Ikitursa. I agree about the stalemate rule. The resist debuff should probably ramp tbh.
---
I'm fairly sure not many people are enjoying this unbalanced instanced PVP shit.  Evidenced by the fact that 95% of the day, there's not even enough people in there to spawn the PVP gate.
---
You can sit on the sun in Jita without the police murdering you?  What sort of a hardcore PvPer are you?
---
It did tank it easily with active adc.  Not so well once it was burned.  
---
Tested against multiple fits and pilots.  Different tactics were used.  It loses the range control battle every time to the vigilant.  All it takes is a cpl 5 second dps breaks and its game over.  The 600s got several jams off every fight.  I did not lose a single vigilant.
---
I did try in a max tank deimos too, but even that cant keep up with the damage past about half spool.  Even if you save adc for the point where your tank is clearly broken.
---
More people exploding is good.
---
This will hopefully be part of the next skill recombinations that they do.
---
It's probably like this because the original design was done flying by the seat of their pants.
---
The point I'm getting at is that in your haste to promote bot-hunting, you're proposing solutions that *comparitively* favour bots over human ratters.
---
Eve is reposting other people’s without assigning credit.
---
Well you tanked more. If that was a rematch I suspect you would have tanked much more than last time
---
Awesome viddy! Nice to see you fighting multiples and the fight vs the ass frig, love it!
---
Use the 600s not the 300s.  Huge difference.
---
BB RESUB
---
Your totally right, panfam should have pinged like tomorrow and formed hard for 1 lonely little nid
---
It's sourced with a link at the bottom of the main post and the name of the poster. 
---
He aggregated these things from others but there's no way I'm tracking all those down.
---
I mean he is sporting an Mcav flair. Could start there
---
DUCK PICS &lt;3
---
Legacy
---
Code
---
Also, as an alternative, if you already know how to get around in wormholes a better option for beginners I think is ninja gas huffing.
---
Basically you warp to an untriggered gas site, set a timer for 15min, huff gas then warp out as soon as the rats appear, sometime not long after 15min. 
---
Especially if you go after C320 gas in instrumentals or vitals from C5 or C6 wormholes you can get great isk/hour this way as a beginner. But the low class gas is good isk for a beginner as well.
---
IIRC the Post Processing Setting actually changes the visibility of shit on the new map lol.
---
Should be at the top.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77056401/ Curse dies 1v1, even with high grade pod and abyssal rolled neuts. The Ikit very easily tanks the neuts long enough to kill a flimsy Curse.
---
Stay out of WH space, explore in sov null space.
---
People who tell you to explore WH space are idiots, or pvpers in wh space.
---
Woah there brother, provi isn't  all nrds, there is a group down there moving about that does not follow that rule. Htp and various other corps move in and around ther. They will probably try and hunt you down if your exploring.
---
EVEs true purpose is to train the psycopaths of the world and keep them contained until one fateful day when they will flip the switch to 'off' and untold hundreds of thousands of highly trained sociopaths will be loosed upon the world at once.
---
Most definitely. I sometimes run eve on a laptop with worse specs (4GB ram, intel core i3, and intel graphics -- so no graphics card). That too 64 bit.
---
Have to run it on potato mode however, it handles 2 clients just fine stable at 50-60 fps and also stable to 40 fps in big fights (500-1000, beyond it can be frustrating).
---
I am not tech savvy, it may be worth asking someone around, adding a graphics card will definitely make it very easy to run the game for u i think on the laptop at mid graphics or mb high.
---
I'm talking about with ADCU off you mongoloid. Not my fault you fit 5 damage mods and a small rep thinking that's a good fit.
---
I have more balls than brains and [I suck](https://zkillboard.com/character/93059766/) at pvp. We can duel in T1 Merlins. I buy.
---
just do it.
---
I did not fit the ikis.
---
R/eve is a circlejerk of hate, pessimism and partisan concern trolling, kinda like the playerbase :p
---
Just from seeing how shit your posting is it was already obvious you were a Goon.
---
why did you think it would be worth posting then?
---
I've personally started exploring about a month and a half ago. In the first half a month I lost 3 Stratios(2 to WH ganks(but more to my carelessless), 1 to C5 relic site), and 2 Astero(1 to Covert Site explosion and 1 to Limited Cache security can explosion(WHY IS NO ONE WROTE THIS CAN HAPPEN)). Yes, sure, that's close to a billion in ships and loot lost, BUT thanks to that I learned a lot of things. Like flying into WH mostly in Astero, because that ship is much cheaper and faster. And being afraid of every thing out of the ordinary and spamming V key every 5 seconds, even when flying, hacking, eating, sleeping... Oh god, there is an enemy Heron on podscan, it must be a bait! *hides under a bed*
---
But most importantly, I'm quite ISK positive at the moment. Exploring is a pretty decent way to make money solo, but it's also extremely luck based. One day you can fly for 5 hours and get like 200 mil, and the other you can get 700 mil from just one forgotten C2 system. Sure running lvl 4 missions with my set up can also be decent and risk free, but it becomes boring and repetitive pretty fast. We need more FUN pve missions.
---
And yes, if you go exploring, you neeed at least 3 hours to do it decently. I recomend using wormholes inside wormholes, and preferably not exit ones(K162). The farther you go from high sec, the better your chances of finding good stuff. And yes, trust me, getting better skills helps a LOT. I've invested pretty heavily in hacking and exploration, and it's like a night and day when you skills get better. Also, Astero with 1 rig for stronger scanning is a must. With it you can scan down sleeper caches, which are 50-200 mil per site(just today I had 300 from one though, very lucky on blueprints).
---
I will link my Astero fit here a bit later. Be mindfull though, if you want to complete Standart sleeper caches and Covert sites, you need Stratios. More expensive, more risky and can't go into Limited Caches, so it's your choice.
---
I'll add,
---
EVE also makes our carebears grow some claws.  The bears that stay in eve are harder and more 'evil' then the ones that bounce after there first death or can;t take it.
---
Cant orbit rock if no rock 🤔.                    
---
                
---
Last i did them they hit harder on a vni than the rocks but its been a few years
---
I used the "I don't know how to join a fleet, just warp to this moon I'm at" excuse on some guy that was telling new player systems..... Just because you're in high sec doesn't mean you shouldn't dscan that moon. :-P
---
Ok well you're testing with retards so nice work
---
Because CCP were drunk and in tyool 2019 they can't change it without everyone's ships turning into rorquals
---
That is the draw but not necessarily anything to do with it's "hardcore" accept. Eve used to be MUCH more difficult to play. The tutorial was non-existant, it told you how to lock stuff, how to warp and dock and that was it. You didn't even start with enough isk to convo anyone (you had to pay 10k or so (you could change it at some points) isk to intiate a conversation. There was no overview, gang (old fleets) were limited to like a dozen people, there was no broadcasts (so f1 monkeying didn't exist). You couldn't warp to 0 at anything (aka when you warped to a gate you warped 15km away from it), people got around this by making bookmarks 15km behind the gate from every other gate in the system which caused a lot of system issues and they added warp to 0 so people would stop. There was no contract system, instead there was escrow (which blew dick).
---
Alliances weren't in the game, neither was sov. Local didn't have standings in it. Also systems didn't have anomalies and there weren't complexs or anything, if you wanted to make isk you mined asteroids in the asteroid belts or killed rats in the asteroid belts. As you can imagine people made WAYYYY less isk, like 10m an hour was considered good money. Corps/Alliances (there was unofficial alliances as the game didn't support them) didn't have any way to make isk so there was no such thing as SRP. Players flew their own ships, and the average person had &lt;200m in their wallet so losses were often quite hard which tended to end wars after only a few "large" battles. 
---
There was also no pos, citadels, or outposts, the only stations in 0.0 were the NPC and Conquerable stations (and even the conqs weren't originally there). 1 refinery and 2 factory stations per non-npc region, and VERY rarely were their systems with refineries in them that had good ore. So you mine whenever the ore is, take it in your t1 hauler (there was no freighters or deadspace haulers, just regular t1 haulers) however many jumps (there was no jump bridges, or even caps/jump drives) to the refinery. Refine it, then haul it a factory station 10+ jumps away with as many trips as you needed. Or just mine the good shit in 0.0 and take the high end (zyd/mega) to highsec and sell it as because of how much effort was involved very few things were built in 0.0.
---
Or the list can just go on and on and on.... But the game was considerably more complex back then compared to now, not to mention many systems just were a huge pain in the ass to use. Between simplying things and the many QOL of changes that CCP has done EvE has become progressively easier to play in pretty much every aspect. However they have added a lot of tedius stuff to do, so it in general it is a lot more WORK, but not particularly hard to understand. That compelled with the subscription fees tended to weed out a lot of the shittier population of the MMO communities. But the QOL changes, overall simplification of many systems, plex, skill injectors, and alpha state is why you have people like frank the bank which would never gotten into the game before.

What makes you think I'm a Goon?
---
At least one of them is a solid pvp pilot.  
---
0 bling on the vigilant btw.
---
Amazing! Grats for a top production!!!!!
---
Too late.
---
A solid pvp pilot doesn't die in a 1500+ dps tank ship to a 900 dps ship, so I'm fairly certain he's shit
---
No, just undock.
---
&gt;use provi for anything but easy kills
---
Yes now we all know we should disregard every word you say
---
&gt;everyone's ships turning into rorquals
---
Honestly, out of all of the possible ways the game could break that's probably not even the worst.
---
So you should be picking your career path based on your interests in the game as the skills you train will translate into your pvp role. Explo is good if you're interested in scouting, cartography, combat probe hunting and/or black ops/bombing/t3c/t3d's/recon ships. If you arent interested in any of these you might want to try something else. (Missions, ratting, gas/ice/mining, courior contracts, market trading, etc.)
---
The scanning and hacking skills really are worth it and add up. Once you can fly cov-ops and get the cov ops skill to lv4 you'll be scanning better than a maxed frigate bonus t1 explo ship or a soe ship. (yes 2.5% stronger makes a difference and adds up with the other skills) at lv5 cov-ops you'll be scanning 12.5% stronger than any other ship besides the Nestor (which you really dont want to use for explo in most cases)
---
Cov-ops cloak isn't super important but you'll find in some situations the added utility will save your life.
---
t2 hacking moduals give a huge boost once you get there.
---
Once you give these things some time to stack up and refine your player skill you can make huge amounts of isk. And before then you'll still be making solid isk with some dedication.
---
All the ways to make isk in this game get boring after a while so choose the one you enjoy and translates into your pvp goals and juat commit to it.
---
you mean they were switched to non alliance corps to avoid the coming killmails? \*looks at M-O keepstar\*
---
&gt;nobody is making that argument.
---
you mean other than the all people posting on reddit from Panfam's side of things?
---
But what would the Goon armada do without structure timers?
---
Why tho? It’s more amusing safely sitting somewhere else and watching you guys freak the fuck out about it.
---

Because there was a time where it did make sense but they changed the names of those skills to make them easier to understand for plebs.
---
Imagine being able to turn off PvP mode, the people complaining about mining are the once who in affect want to turn of PvE mode.
---
Exploration is fineif you live in NS. Otherwise it's quite a pain in the ass.
---
Haha yeah let's make the game even more simple so every common retard can subscribe
---
I said at least there are fights,it's not a warzone either,but since some goon sigs like welp squad are deployed there it's not only catebears

cause hes a goon, he allready stated that - therefor he has a severe case of spodbrain

I've gone on a few profitable exploration roams in Stain.  Here are some of the things I would say about it:
---
   •  Watch out for gate camps, FERRA are douches  :D
---
   •   There are a few low activity pockets with 3-4 sigs each system
---
   •    Data sites are generally not worth the trouble, except sleeper caches and covert research, both are generally scan strength III or higher
---
   •    Take the time to learn how to do the lesser sleeper caches, worth it!
---
   •   If you are an amoral prick, use a cargo scanner to cherry pick good cans (I dont do this but it does increase isk/hr)
---
Using this as a rough guide, I have gone out for a few hours and come back with close to a bil in loot and 6-7 blueprint copies worth varying amounts.
---
Bonus Tip:  stock a pvp refit in a neutral station, blowing up other explorers is the most fun and lucrative part of exploration!
---
No, you can afk 99% of your time and only show up to timers
---
But you are ok with forcing PvE players to PvP i take it?
---
Any excuse will actually do
---
Lol feeling competetive today, are we ;)
---
&gt;  comparitively favour bots over human ratters.
---
This is wrong.
---
This is a good guide but it's been out of date for a long time now. It still says the only battlecruiser available to alphas is the Gnosis. That hasn't been true since late 2017!
---
You're pretty upset
---
I have heard that PI is great passive income. Do you have a guide you recommend I read?!@?
---
LOL
---
This. Obviously if you've been playing for any length of time you've probably scaled the foothills in order to be able to play effectively. Even then however you will still occasionally fall into the deep crevasse of gank now and then. You only have to listen to the salty whines here or on the forums to understand just how brutal the game can be
---
I still do not understand statics or how to look them up properly
---
you are right but the game is EVE, not Valkyrie. You need to build things to be relevant.
---
Oof.
---
&gt; ve has 40ish null regions. Suppose it had 40 regions divided by "titan ranges" (in effect its less).
---
The line is a lot more fuzzy than that. Look at Fountain for example, Central Fountain and Northern Fountain aren't well linked by range, and the south side of the region is completely disconnected. Then you've got all the weirdness in drones you're probably familiar with like how Oasa/PFalls/Malpais are all mixed in on top of each other so that south PFalls has better range to west Oasa than to north PFalls.
---
Sounds good in the main though, I'm a fan of the idea of spreading people out more. Thought you mean directly changing balance to make things riskier.
---
I'd have thought you could get a vigi through a T3, couldn't you?
---
Imagine Eve war in Classic WoW lol
---
I live in Jita, also USTZ, and I'll be home from work in about 30 minutes. Let's dance!
---
OP can come watch and do her needlepoint...or knitting...make us some samiches...
---
Yeah which takes a lot of effort. If it doesn't take a lot of effort then it is by definition in your sphere of influence and we're having a different conversation.
---
Probably, but you'd have to do it without using your drones because you need the ec-600s.
---
Cheers man :) would like to have more fights against multiples is just difficult finding a group small enough to engage in a frigate usually its either solo dude or blob as i am sure your aware of also.
---
&gt;Imho for a single player DED is the best way to make money, but is much easier and profitable if you are in a big group with a lot of people selling DED bookmarks.
---
also isnt this more about combat than actual hacking?
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77135906/ well i think some of them are in delve
---
There is more day to day content and ISK lost with Rorqs then it ever was with moon mining.
---
&gt;Gib sp back
---
The cruiser and frigate skills aren't bad.. but fuck training up the t2 bs/capital skills.
---
The posting from goons this war has been terrible
---
Remember that pretty much all games are far less hardcore than they were 15 or 20 years ago. I remember corpse runs in EQ. If a game incorporated these sorts of mechanics for today's snowflake generation of casual gamers there would be a public outcry.
---
yes
---
 Autocannon firetail with that same fit is pretty legit, but ACs in general could use a buff or three CCPLS
---
The issue is I dont think I have ever found a sleeper cache? What do they look like on the probe scanner UI?
---
I dont think ive seen a single limited cache. Why do I need a stratios? To kill the npcs?
---
I love your preamble. Like you, I miss the old system. The Rorqual changes and moon-mining changes fundamentally changed Eve in a way that I do not like. With that said, I am not sure your math works. 
---
I accept the premise that the valuable moons in Syndicate were collectively worth around 50b per month in the good old days (that squares with what I was told our income was once we took those moons). That was enough income for a mid-sized alliance to be scrappy. It was worth fighting for because it was valuable and all you had to do to protect it was to be willing to fight. You could spend individual time doing what you wanted.
---
I simply do not see how any group strong enough to do so could justify the persistent effort to control all the valuable moons in Syndicate for a mere 6-8b passive income a month. 
---
Additionally, a passive mode that earns 15% of max yield will not turn very much profit after fuel costs.
---
There is the additional problem that if the passive mode is too good, then there is no real incentive to do the active collection. More people will switch to the passive mode if they can collect great income while not having to be active out in space mining ships. It will inevitably mean that many moons in a region that are not currently fully exploited due to lack of pilots become useful as passive alliance income. Large alliances will benefit from your change as much or more than small ones.
---
There must be a balance point between those two extremes. I think the best way to find that balance point is to make the active collection of moon goo slower. To me, for starters, that means keeping Rorquals off moons completely (no industrial core allowed on grid with mining structures). Barges and exhumers with Orca boosts as the only real way to mine moons at the top end would be a good start.
---
I'm hoping that my torpedos skill being 5 will give me large missiles 5 so i don't have to train cruise missiles. But i want t2 cruise missiles now so its just ughhh.
---
did you even read what op wrote?
---
It's done a bit like drones, one skill per weapon (of course for drones its simpler as its sizes and there's only 1 per size).

Just a sample from a couple of day's 
---
Now to known if it's a NPC kill mail you have to get the json from the eve api. 
---
Now unless you ask squiz to do a bulk dump it's reconstructing it means using eve api ( that isn't call a api but is total an api ). 
---
Then you have to check if this is a npc killmail or not, this means every one of those numbers ( total zkill represents a webrequest ). now to be fair you can do like the 10k request for a day in like under a hour but but well that means doing a bunch of request my experience says as soon as you fire off more then 200 of them CCP will go no.
---
Bad trolling does
---
&gt; We still stayed and fought a guerrilla war for months, knowing that it was futile, which is more than can be said for NCPL.
---
&gt; knowing that it was futile
---
fyi i know this probably sounded better in your head but it just sounds retarded
---
Nice video, and GF's from PIE. (You blapped my cni in your coercer yesterday 🙃)
---
Fix FW arenas before trying new ones.
---
Thank you man and yeh remember that fight gf my friend :)
---
it does not really matter how much isk you earned from it as long as you had fun. A lot of people are playing this game wrong since they are so much obsessed with isk that they sacrifice the fun part of the video game in order to become space rich and keep telling themselves that they will start having fun once they have enough isk. But in reality you don't really need a lot of isk at all to have fun,the key is to find a right group of people to play with.
---
thank you
---
How much are those two items you suggest to get?   I see the analyzer is 175 million.  That is a huge amount for a beginner, especially if he gets blown up. 
---
I get some pretty good finds in C1 holes without the extra costs.  But it does take quite a few holes to find some good sites.
---
Congrats on being an idiot
---
you're the ones complaining nobody is talking about your bashing feats, not them
---
Well you see, we're burning more in Delve, having more engaging gameplay compared to you guys and we have you all salty over here, so it's actually better than what we hoped for, hence, the expectations are exceeding reality, therefore, morale is actually just fine. 
---
You all seem salty tho, hope it's okay over at your end.
---
OMG this made my day/night
---
Thanks for all
---
You mad?
---
Not our fault PanFam don't want to undock and defend their coalition assets.
---
You’re damn right.

We thought Muninns were a new type of structure. Were quite confused when they shot back.

I'll be working for another half hour or so, at least, and my commute is kinda long.  Call it 7:30 USTZ?
---
&gt; I don't think I'll represent you. It's a very American Republican kind of thinking that all representatives represent everyone. It's a rather twisted way of thinking about democracy. Things don't work that way, because the interests of people diverge. There is only one way a representative can vote.
---
So you're not going to represent anyone you don't like or who might disagree with you (Do we even disagree?). Sounds to me like a lack of compromise is bleeding through.
---
&gt; I'll represent many ideas which won't converge with your Eve views.
---
You don't even know my Eve views, you're making an assumption.
---
&gt; I've always been above null politics. 
---
This is a bold faced lie. You replied to me - asking you a simple question - by running some anti-goon propaganda line. I don't give a shit about space politics for this thread. How are you going to represent my type of player - which you haven't even asked what type I am yet. 
---
Instead, you're ranting about goons again. Can you stay on a topic?
---
Just realized I need to replace that reply:  I can't go to Jita, lol.  I'm -10.0, so I'm afraid I can only meet in lowsec or null.
---
You can play eve on a calculator if you really want
---
I want to see the highsec world ark fights be the players helping the faction navy to kill the world ark.
---
Once the world ark is up, the first step is to kill it's cyno jammer, then the empire navy brings in an Iapetus Titan, rapid fire doomsdays swinging, wiping out trig ships left right and centre while triage towers are repping the entire player fleet at once for their entire hull+armour+shield every cycle, all the subsytems individual, targetable entities. (And similar for the world ark) Then the world ark hits armour from the repeat fire doomsday hits, and goes into reinforce...
---
Then the Iapetean starts channelling power to it's primary weapon, and as it fires you can see the original week-long reinforce timer on the world ark ticking away. But since the titan's standard weapons are now offline, the onus is once again on the players to tackle the ongoing stream of trig ships entering the battle through the world ark portal, who are now split between a group targeting the titan's subsystems and a group targeting the players. If the trigs are allowed to run rampant, the power subsystems on the titan will be forced into reinforce, the main weapon shuts down, and the world ark escapes...
---
I can dream.
---
I think you're projecting your own saltiness onto me, friend. Have fun ambushing dummies who don't even know we're at war. Nomadic life really suits you; which is fortunate, since you're not going to have a home to go back to before long.

So vulgar...try saying the same thing without so much profanity. It’s unbecoming. You subhuman cum dumpster
---
Didn't someone steal a huge chunk of PL's tournament prizes in the second half of last year?
---
It's PvE, you have to check the site and use the right fit (which are quite expensive for high level DED sites, but they are a good investment), shoot npcs through different stages and loot at the end.
---
Some of those sites are quite tricky but they're always the same, so once you learn you can do them very easily.
---
They are also safer than regular combat site because people must scan you with combat probes to find the site, enter and catch you, so when you have neutrals you only have to use dscan, and warp to a safe (and eventually cloak) when you se probes on dscan.
---
In some DED sites you can make more than 1B (my record in sansha space was 1.7B for a single DED site done with a blinghy tengu)
---
I thought cancer was a disease caused by uncontrollable cell division

Whose freaking out? We're going to burn your home down whether you undock or not.

A++++++ would burn again.

*enough* people gotta stay to keep it going, though

That's a hell of an endorsement

We would love that you stay and camp North for months to come. Please, do it.

DeadCo is working directly with goons to attack NCPL, although after goons go home I doubt deadco is going to hold on to their newly taken territory for long

Saying it over and over won't make it true.

We are all proud of you. It brings tears of joy to my eyes.

I mean, structure proliferation is close to that
---
With the new jump gates without a fatigue its has never been easier traveling,Aridia for example is only 2-3 gates away from GSF staging system. Most of the decent moons worth taking in LS will be taken by a big nullsec alliances because everyone loves the passive income. Sending fleet every now and then for defending them also wont be a problem since what else people will do when there are no wars.
---
Good.
---
And?
---
 Nobody cares ffs. You can keep saying it but it won’t make it matter. Do something and move into Tribute if you want anyone to give any shit at all. Even then there’s so much space that it doesn’t matter. Beebrains taught us that.

Why does a skill change the performance of aiming weapons, at all? It's not like anything you do will change what a cruise missile does. Unless you release them in the opposite direction of your target

We killed 215b more in structures since this morning. Post updated with the new total.
---
there's a salty Fortnite player.
---
I never said building things isn't important. But eve used to be a game about constant war in a dystopian universe, and now it's basically turning into farmville in space, but instead of cows you milk pirates and instead of farms you build citadels. At in nullsec anyway.
---
good stuff!
---
Not true. In fact, there were some big battles at the start of the war. For instance the battle in M-O, after which CO2 left the imperium. 
---
Panfam trying to rewrite history again.
---
WTF?

Citadels did not come to substitute POSes only.

---
Assets safety to me, is a problem but not that big compared to others.
---
The greatest cancer in eve is the amount of isk generation (ratting supers) + capital spam (rorquals) + capacity to safely dock it.
---
Anyone can own a super and dock it now (docking a super/titan is a cancer). Cooking a super/titan is SO EASY and ANYBODY can do that. So, we have a massive spam + we can dock it = FUCKIN SAFE.
---
Then, injectors. WTF. Injecting skills is GOOD but it SHOULD BE LIMITED to like 24 injectors per year, maybe?
---
After that all, we have the asset safety cancer. RIP Eve
---
We can generate massive amount of wealth in a very tiny region of space, we can cook really big shit so fast and safe, then, we can literally keep it docked or just teleport it via asset safety.
---
Going from EVE to other multiplayer games is like going from Seal Team 6 to the local laser tag venue
---
Milk? Lol what
---
Obviously its not a ton of isk for an alliance, but considering how proud you are of killing 850b in structures, it seems like a decent enough number to bring up. Before the invasion, they got 217b from Tenal rent, 375b from Vale rent, 166b from Tribute rent, and about 155b from Kalevala rent. I'm not sure about Malpais, but I'm guessing it's pretty close to the Vale income. That gives us an average per region of 257.6b. Now imagine they cut prices in half, and 40% of their renters leave. That's still an average per region of over 75b. 
---
Basically I'm looking for a worst case scenario. GOTG keeps Tenal torched, the local groups in The Spire keep it torched, goons keep Tribute torched. Panfam reduces rental prices by 50% across the board, 40% of their current renters leave, and they can't find any replacements. They still make enough rental income in 4 months to replace the structure losses you've caused so far. To summarize: 3 groups are actively burning down regions whenever Panfam sets up there, and their existing rental program essentially collapses. They would still recover from these structure losses by the first of October 2019.
---
That's my real point. It's not that 300b is a large amount of isk, it's that even 900b is a relatively small amount of isk. It just impresses me how meaningless loss is in Eve 2019, that burning Panfam space to the ground doesn't even really put a dent in their income.
---
Got any links?
---
Good for you on quitting your space job in high style, but it took you a whole year? I've stolen entire corporations (by totally legal methods that I'm loathe to describe) in less than a day.
---
or you're an embarrassing retard and i'm not
---
the isk war is simply not relevant tbh, because imo there is something bigger going on: goons trashing and burning ncpl's space and evicting them, basically because we can. and the fact of the matter is that they couldn't do the same to us. that's why we're winning, and no matter what they say, they're losing. 
---
but as soon as you start posting isk values you invite the legitimate comparison with kills in delve. and it IS a legitimate comparison on those terms.
---
the reality is that those are just ganks; we're prosecuting a war of eviction. and that's the difference that matters
---
get fucked, tard
---
Hmm, a neutral explanation is gonna be hard. A "goon" is a poster on Something Awful. Goonswarm Federation is a corporation and an alliance in Eve that was created by users from SA. Over the years they've pissed a lot of people off for lots of reasons and are now probably the most powerful (certainly the most infamous) player faction in the game. Members of this power bloc are also called goons, although they may not necessarily post on SA.
---
That people who can read usernames and remember stuff for more than ten minutes are smarter than you?
---
Your honestly bragging about costing the NC/PL less than 1t in isk, lets say its 3t or 5t, its seriously pocket change, as it is for goons, they were making that (3-5t if not more) per month from rental income, its such a low amount to be bragging about, its the equivalent of your average player loosing a HAC. With regards to time and effort to rebuild, i think your forgetting that's one of the things that some, i would argue most eve players secretly enjoy doing and when its a group effort its actually uniting as it was for the goons. 
---
Come back when you have wiped out there super caps, until then stick the goon forums.
---
haha skillu we'll see whos laughing when gotg controls all of tenal and ur still plfam pets lol
---
Snag.gy? no i've never heard of it.
---
odd flex but ok
---
Tbf the keepstar killmails haven't rolled in yet.
---
Anyone know how many keepstars NC/PL actually have between Tenal/Tribute/Vale?
---
Not against people who unironically think having the support of TikkTokk and Gobbins is a benefit. Yikes!
---
I'm not a huge fan of anything passive, but this idea isn't bad. I do think we need to carve out a space for nomadic pvp oriented groups though. I think there definitely needs to be bigger spoils in war. I'd like to tweak asset safety a bit, but that is usually of the table. Maybe citadels drop a small portion of assets like ship kill ails, or LP style credits, or something to that effect.
---
We definitely need to bring back the terror that nomadic alliances used to instil.
---
no, they're not. tuz posted the "butcher's bill" which invites the comparison to the losses in delve. and the reality is that we will probably end up losing more in delve than they do in the north, because we have so many spodbrained retards.
---
isk is a good way to guage a battle, but not a war. the allies spent more money and lost more men than the axis in ww2, but nobody is out there arguing that they lost the war. sure the soviets fed a lot but in the end it was the nazis who lost all their sov and disbanded.
---
retards like you and tuz making these shitty hypocritical iskwar arguments only shift the terms of debate to ncpl's advantage. stop arguing that some kills matter and some don't, it's dumb. they are being evicted, we are not, and they couldn't evict us if they tried.

Hi, I'm the creator of that software and will answer your questions. You can find the most important info concerning your security at [https://www.clone-guard.space/information-safety](https://www.clone-guard.space/information-safety)

The purpose of this tool is that you know about your implants the moment you undock, not when you're in battle, which would be shit.
---
wait a second ...
---
I was actually talking about the crime watch change and the addition of the red yellow green safety toggle. But I agree that one of the biggest problems in Eve is isk inflation which carries with it capital proliferation. I remember when having a capital was a big deal. Now it’s obligatory to not just have combat capitals but also suicide caps. Hell, people were talking about suicide Titians the other day. It all points to their being too much isk in the game and not enough destruction.  So what does ccp do in response to this?  Adds roquel mining and new forms of pve. Sure abyssal pve lead to some destruction of expensive ships in the beginning but it’s being farmed for isk now.   And to add insult to injury the whole alpha thing has made it ridiculously easy to bot the game which has lead to even more isk being pumped in.
---
Thanks, I'll try those, i  got some isk to burn :)
---
you would still be the worst poster in skillu even if you let them use r/eve

Yeah but that’s just glamour shots of ships. We need a place to log stories of when eve players slip out into the mainstream.

I'm a non-political person who likes to kill ships and argue game balance.

If we are losing billions a day from not being able to krab what are NC/PL/PH and the rest of them not being able to make per day since all their space is hostile or cloaky camped? If we're counting ratting ticks then count both sides losing them.

People feeding them 18b in return for 2 sabres and 2 jags might play a part.

Nah no way. Eve ruined me for other games. The environment the game fosters encourages spying, stealing, and griefing which is something basically no other massive games. It takes a certain type of person to be okay with losing literally years of work for just trusting the wrong person. It's not a bad system but it's a system that fosters a certain type of person. I played back in the era of Moo and Curse Alliance and played until Capital ships became the mainstay in warfare. I despise cap ships so I quit. When I quit and started playing other games its just different. My cutthroat mentality in Eve translated uh... Oddly to other games. It baffled me when I was given access to guild banks in a matter of months. I could easily just lie my way to game assets because while what I did wasn't illegal in the game it was encouraged so no one did it. Eve definitely has a more uh devious player base. By a huge margin.

Eh I wouldn’t suggest a new player get that analyzer or expensive implants.

It's safe to use. If you grant the app access to your location info then it will send you a warning mail if you undock in an expensive clone (you can configure what expensive means).

use marauders, run sites in eu-prime, use deadspace to optimise

You should join Stay Frosty, even if it is with a random FW alt that can fly pvp fitted frigates.

---
They look like data sites which are the hardest to scan down. Superior cache needs 104 scanner strength to scan down and you need to zero all your probes on it. And as I said, you need Stratios to survive Covert Sites(can explosions deal from 6000 exp damage in hi sec to 12000 damage in WH, plus rats shoot you after that for a while if you get caught) and to complete Standard Sleeper Cache(towers will kill frigs warping to the far side). You can do half of Superior Cache with frigate, but to complete it you need some very serious tank. Look up all the info on Eve University btw.
---
Here's a fit btw, cheap, good cargohold and will pay for itself after a few hours of good roaming. And take mobile Depot with you to boost your scanning strength on the go.  You will warp in 2 seconds, but if you locked, use ECM drones in hope of dropping the loc before dropping your ship.

The question is why missiles and turrets are so different. Blasters and rails have about as much in common as rockets and light missiles

The tank on those things (when fit with capital ASBs at least) is ridiculous even before PANIC.

It'll run EVE, but man, you are so much better off with something different...
---
I am honestly surprised you are getting so much hate. If anything EVE needs more heists, big and small, to fuel more grudges (which lead to more conflict / pvp).
---
&gt; people
---
That's the issue. There just aren't that many people willing to do the work. A few people managed the passive moons, meaning the ROI on real people time was high
---
A good many more would show to for the fights.  But there's a near zero interest in making spacebucks "working" in lowsec. Almost everyone I knew in lowsec owned multiple caps with dedicated characters and at least half had super(s).  And if you want to rorq mine, use the dedicate alts in a dedicated nullsec corp with no risk.

I've been complaining about this for years. Mainly because caldari capitals.

Honestly, I'd love to see more small-ship PvE opportunities in nullsec. Some gated sites that only let Frigs/dessies in, but offer a nullsec-level challenge? Maybe require a small fleet of frigates to accomplish?
---
Some fast-paced action for smaller ships to contrast the slow, lumbering pew pew of the cruisers and above used for most PvE in nullsec.

I'm glad that fleet abyssal sites exist now to provide some content of that type, but I'd really like to see more!

pve happens all the time. there was belt mining, and anom mining, and even rorq mining, before there was active moon mining.
---
and nobody is asking for active moon mining to be removed. they just want passive moon mining brought back as a viable, albeit less lucrative option for a different playstyle.
---
nobody is saying that ccp should get rid of rorqs

Few years ago in my normal job I had one of our clients working with me getting their project set up just right. She noticed my laptop background (of some Eve ships) and told me her son played.

So a few years ago I emptied a certain low sec corps hanger after deceivingly convincing the head of industry that I was a previous indy buff who had recently re-rolled a fresh indy toon to help the corp flourish, I used past members identity and a little trickery to convince them that it was me and I cleared out the corp stock(minus some faction stuff), but i found myself in a predicament... I now have all this shit and no where to go with it...   
---
So I rubbed shoulders with some smaller band of low sec guys, shot the reds, got on comms, befriended the group. But there was one pilot who would like to call himself a nomad, a man with no association and only space bushido to keep the thin line from breaking between us and himself.
---
he set up industry in the system, he shipped in his assets and he made it a home away from home if you like, after 6 months or so of alliance I decided to test his code of honor I asked for the favor of a lifetime. 
---
**1 single use of his JF in order to move some ships from system A to system B**
---
I genuinely played on his trust and kindness with no expectations, but he conceded. He allowed me use of the JF as long as I payed for it if it was destroyed(lul).  
---
I have him send it to an alt, less than a minute later I contract it to my newly trained JF toon, now he had no knowledge of where it had gone, I packed up all the stolen assets and POOF the JF and the alt disappeared into the night, gone forever, never to be found.  
---
It was less than 24 hours later I notified him of my indiscretion and let him make a call on his next move. Furious he calls the "gang" he explains to them what had happened and at that point the group split down the middle... chat lit up, one one side we had the pilots of honor and dignity, on the other we had the true lowsec blood, the all for one and one for himself type... my type.   
---
Cast out by half of the group claiming KoS of any of my known toons or alts, I retreated to a haven nearby, I cloaky camped and I watched. I still had access to several citadels in the system which caused frustration amongst the group, some days i had docking rights other days i didn't, it became a shit show with weeks of pleading to return the ship from both its original owner and the men of honor in the group, claiming no harm no fowl if the ship was returned. **It never was.** The group slowly faded away to nothing over the coming months(unrelated to my incident), some members returning to old corps, others disappearing off the face of the earth, including the victim, who skill ripped his toon and injected into another.  
---
With what was left, me and the remaining pilots made our peace, but it would never be the same, I packed my bags and I left.  
---
After a few months of predominantly solo play, no fleets, no comms, I found myself burned out, tired of loging in, I went back to null but that just didn't scratch the itch. it wasn't the same. I won eve a few months later. 
---
The only reason i'm here telling this story is because I logged in yesterday and I can feel it's allure once again, drawing me in, that enchanting ambience. 
---
**EVE the Siren, luring me to my demise.**  
---
So 2 lessons were learned here.
---
1. Never trust anyone in eve.  
---
2. You never know what you've got until it's gone.
---
TL;DR  
---
I awoxed a corp, then awoxed a bluetral group for a JF to move the stuff.
---
Honest question - does your leadership feed you this information or do you just come up with it on your own? I'm genuinely interested if the Horde average line member is generally this brain warped.

if there was no asset safety no one would use citadels. You can't have a mechanic where you run the risk of losing everything because life gets in the way of you playing a game for a week.

I think CCP could go a unique route with Marauders.
---
Turn Bastion into a module that accepts scripts. The scripts could emulate T3D modes (sharpshooter, defense), with super-heavy tackle replacing propulsion mode (point bonus to tackle and potentially a cyno inhibiting effect).
---
It's not passive, I make 5B/30days and it's work.
---
Tether and PDS are awful mechanics as well. Camping people's staging stations to force them to form is some of the best fun I've ever had in the game. Why fortizars, cheap as they are, have the ability to create a multi hundred kilometer sphere that three shots frigates and destroyers I have no idea.

Yes.
---
And, shockingly, I wasn’t in the CFC. Which may explain why I have no clue what the “official story” is. I’m sure it definitely didn’t involve Sion shitting up relations with literally everyone for years prior leading to some hilariously bitter animosity though.
---
Nor did it include the impact of the Viceroy plans and the literally terrible reception that made.
---
Of course WWB was just a fully funded hit job by a guy conveniently banned by CCP for cheating immediately following the end of the war. Previous versions included accusations that CCP was actually helping everyone against Goons as well but that seems to have died down.

More than likely, your problem is that you’re checking a bunch of holes with highsec statics. Go just a couples jumps farther, and find C1-C3 holes with low/nullsec statics. These will have way more for you to pick clean. Also, a lot of the sites only have 5-10m worth of junk in them. But that tenth site can sometimes have 50-100m in it, making it all worth your time.
---
Goons are having fun.  
---
I am not sure what your point is.
---
I don't think most high paying vets would know what to do if they weren't griefing newbies one way or another.
---
true but i went through 15-20 WH today and got 0 sites so fuck that
---
this is a stereotype. "i know your type", it's like judging sexy clothes on a woman and call her a whore. Assumption is the mother of all fuckups
---
Even a t2 fit Hyperion can tank a Leshak at full spool.
---
What I used to do if I live in a certain area I would color code my enemies I have fought before. 
---
A guy that gave me a fair fight? I'll set it as orange -5
---
A guy in a medium plex. But has a couple of dscan immune recons waiting for you. Set them red -10 and be extra careful with them next time.
---
With adaptive hardener yep. You can neut the hyp pretty hard....but the hyp would have upper hand for first 90 secs or so until spooled up.
---
Astero is better than a Helios for relic hunting because it is faster to align, focus and rig for relic sites till your skills are high enough to use a integrated analyzer.
---
Totally do WH sites, you need to be ready to warp out and dscan all the time, stay at 2.1km off the can so you can cloak instantly but still pick up the loot.
---
All I do right now is huff WH gas, PI, and relic/data hunt, I fly a Astero with a Frostline analyzer and a Blackglass implant and it's just the best thing.
---
At least you covered the ship cost. Yeesh
---
&gt;  Snuff killed lowsec so I guess it's a bit rich for me to complain about it
---
if a single entity can kill an area its a game mechanics problem, hardly a player's. And I say this as someone who probably holds the record of evictions by snuff in a single year.
---
If you don't think that EVE has been a bunch of F1 monkeys since 2004 you're obviously new here.
---
Inside the abyss the bling tank plus reactive means that the vigilant will not smoke the ikitursa unless he's not dual rep, and some single rep fits can still tank that
---
You don't care, you are in a cov-ops ship, treat EVERYONE as if they are hunting you.
---
&gt; Astero is better than a Helios for relic hunting because it is faster to align, focus and rig for relic sites till your skills are high enough to use a integrated analyzer.
---
You only dscan while at the site ... otherwise you are invis while scanning, correct?
---
Id love an Astero but it is a whole 50 mil which I do not have lol
---
How do I properly look up statics. People keep mentioning them.
---
Pretty good tip, thank you.
---
TIL consistency is a bad thing.
---
Or would you argue that the Small Hybrid Turret skill should be split into Small Blaster and Small Railgun, and so forth?
---
wow... just wow...
---
Use dreads
---
Lmfao, you must be completely out of the loop. FYI, we just so happen to be shooting the same enemy of our enemy. Maybe you forgot last year when PL and BL attempted to take Branch. It’s ok though, I need more salt for my steak if you don’t mind...
---
God damn. Well said.
---
Ok so the recent influx of these stories is so far the best thing here in 2019.

This is why you always say you like hisec exploration and live in a solo corp. A irl friend turned white on me when i casually told my alliance. Things were not the same after.
---
Go take a look at how the gun skills are done. 
---
Then don’t complain about the missile skills anymore and be glad you are not trying to train T2 large/capital guns.
---
So you're kicking them while theyre down?
---
If you want to use subs, just go to c5 space. Dreads are the way to go for c6 space (and c5 space tbh). 
---
If you really want to run in a c6, you probably want/need to use a cata hole for the rr bonus.
---
They are, just actively fighting rocks.
---
I saw the inyourspace br and thought "oh it's not that bad" then flipped over to zkill
---

---
As an extension to this line of thought: I would like to see sites with a level of difficulty that 2-3 high-skill players in assault frigates could run, but unlike fleet abyss sites are not capped in terms of the number of ships in order to allow larger fleets of newer players in T1 frigates to have access to the content as well. This way, low-skill players new to the game have some more accessible combat content in nullsec, and aren't limited to activities like mining and exploration, where combat isn't really involved.
---
I see, I think I'll end up doing something like what you're suggesting. I was trying to avoid using dreads but it seems the way to go in C6 space.
---
like, it would have been subtle and understated instead of over the top and kind of cringy you know?
---
Whale hunting helps trim the unfit from the great vast whale herds of delve.
---
Eve is pretty dead actually,
---
yeh man ac are not in a great place especially mediums feel like small and larges are not to bad but may need a look at.
---
congrats, but next time hire more recruiters in your corp. i applied twice and nothing happened...
---
Goons wouldn’t even notice until the patch notes fixing it.
---
If you ever took 1 look at outposts you'd be able to see that basically all they had in common with citadels was the fact that you could dock and do things there. POSes are far closer to citadels, and have far better loot and reinforcement mechanics than citadels. Kindly return to the official forums until you understand the game

Just make sure to replace Mcafee with windows defender.

itt gooners terrified of a proposed change that doesn't explicitly make the game more about pve

If you think that your own incompetence means the game is remotely close to what it used to be you're obviously retarded
---
I said Midwest, not shit hole /s
---
no excuse... you probably hate Lynard Skynard covers on SEC gamedays too don't you?
---
I hardly think you won Eve. You just fell victim to greed. Nothing to be proud of. Thousands of players can do what you did right this second... because they don't makes them way above where you'll ever be.

oh just working in software development and playing eve. currently 1 x corpie on the team. i think weve had a full development team in corp over thr past few years. errr i mean... hiding in my moms basement :)

Sales tax is paid to the Secure Commerce Commission (SCC).  It is affected only by the 'Accounting' skill.
---
Brokerage fees are another thing, and unlike sales tax, can be avoided (with 'immediate' duration orders).

You can eliminate it by using orders of immediate duration.

Play solo in a massively-_multiplayer_-online rpg?

Well maybe the problem is not with CCP.
---
You wouldn't try that in AUTZ!!! (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)
---
No you'r dumb
---
?
---
Honestly, that's explo for you. Keep trying, you do find some sooner or later.
---
Fly safe
---
i haven't paid attention to the SEC since i left georgia, is that a thing that happens now?
---
You don’t show on dscan when you are cloaked, you do all other times.
---
But while you are hacking smash “V” all the time to watch for core or combat probes from someone trying to find you.
---
Ok, I thought you where already in a Helios, a Imicus with a non covert cloak is great too, keep cloaked up while scanning.
---
This BR is amusing, those look like the same fits that they were losing too for like 9 months with the wrong ewar for the job and the expensive mods removed.

I would definitely contact Hard Kocks about their C6 wormhole rental service. They have an excellent repository of guides and even instructional footage! The rent is very affordable (I moved in with just 6b upfront!) and they’ll even give you a free nag!

You should share your goals, and timezone. Do you want to do PVE, industry, mining, PVP - Large scale PVP, small gang PVP, bubble camping?  Are you Omega, are you Alpha?

* Missiles were never originally intended to be a primary weapon system.
---
* There is no requirement, aside from OCD,  that missiles have a similar skill-tree to turrets.
---
The Raven originally had turret hardpoints.  You can still(?) encounter NPC Ravens using rails.

Long gone are the days of strapping a citadel missile to a bomber.

I mean.... so can all the other command dessies.

Bring back clones states, no skill injectors, no asset protection, safety light, and starting professions/bloodlines and I'll say it'll be hardcore again.
---
It's considerably easier to make isk, there is no penalty to getting podded outside of isk where you used to lose skill points if your clone wasn't upgraded enough. Starting profession and bloodlines made a huge impact early on and learning skills were hilarious but it kept the casuals down and the people who cared ahead of the game.

What salt? The last people I fought from Darkness where poor souls fleeing form your shitty alliance into lowsec, just before they dropped corp for a better one.

Meh no. I'm not presuming. I literally know him. I've had enough interactions with him to rationally make up my mind about him. And he belongs to a player type. A player type whose overrepresented influence on the Eve game balance I aim to counterweight.
---
He is one of those metagamers who spends more Eve related time outside the game than inside the game. He derives his joy from the social aspect of Eve. From being part of a larger entity, having long term friends, having people to chat with. Managing reddit channels. Managing discords. 
---
It's all fun respectable until the point it isn't. He is relevant in his alliance due to his social influence. The alliance use that influence to fuel a propaganda machine. Part of the [openly admitted](https://youtu.be/G2B6A3bzwJw?t=269) job of this machine is "making their enemies lives as miserable as possible". That includes out of game. So what they do is to create punching bag personalities to rally their alliance against, and create cohesion. They create narratives about these people. Talking about how they are mentally ill. How they hate Goons. How they are obsessed with Goons. And then they echo these narratives among themselves. And then influenced linemembers come here and echo the same thing. They literally learn to dislike people. It's a very peculiar phenomenon. Certainly worth to be studied by a communications or sociology academic.
---
So here I am, with my balance ideas or Eve accomplishments. I want to share it to reddit. But first I have to get past their dogshit toxicity. When I beat their metagame, it turns out I have so much to contribute, and my message and ideas catch on. But to do that, first I need to beat the downvote machine, beat all the shit throwing, beat lots of other metagame. Even on the very bottom of this thread (or my video thread, which has about 1k upvotes) you'll see the very same people. Meanwhile, while this guy is a reddit mod who's supposed to foster and invite all valuable opinions, and should be impartial, he is making self-admitted plans to get me banned from this subreddit, by getting me to say bannable stuff on reddit. In this very comment tree, he is not actually interested in my viability as a CSM, but is trying to pull me more into his bullshit politics. Because he knows my strongest suit is my game knowledge and expertise, and the more I talk about it, the more recognition I get. But if I talk about me vs. Goons instead, he changes the conversation into political dogshit which he can manipulate to his benefit. And he is achieving it, because he just made me write an essay about it. But I can't not respond to that. My best strategy would be making it explicit, which is what I am doing.
---
People like Mittens are the epitome of his gameplay. Lots of content creators and lots of players left Eve as a direct cause of their bullshit approach to playing Eve. You can see it somewhat in other alliances as well, but nobody plays it at their level. Meanwhile, due to the extremely hierarchical structures of null alliances, these people who typically never undock unironically think they have competitive knowledge in Eve's problems and how to fix them. Some of them get elected to CSM, or get CSM/CCP ears, and get to influence the game, causing even further harm. At the end of the day, they are actively bad for the game, and part of why I'm running is to balance their influence.
---
meh i have no side in this fight but if i had to, i'd rather be over at delve turbofeed edition honest
---
For the love of all that is holy don’t be another “We do a bit of everything” Corp.  Have a focus.  Be a mission running group, be a mining group, be a faction warfare group, be SOMETHING.  A group that tries to be everything virtually always ends doing nothing together.
---
Yeah, I am avoiding the broker fee by selling my orders instantly to the NPC seeded orders, but is there any current way to make sales tax lower than 1%? I have seen multiple older sources say that you could get as low as 0.75%, but i'm not sure if CCP increased the minimum tax at some point.
---
The last part is false youll get permabanned now
---
Garbage of the galaxy does it again.
---
They should just let the Branch VNI bots do the PVP for them as they are probably more competent than any of the human pilots GOTG has to offer.
---
They could have also batphoned their goon daddy but they are probably to busy bashing structures in Tribute to care.
---
Skill U would never try this in AUTZ e.t.c.
---
Is that like the new word you read about today so you keep using or something? Do you even understand how is it used?
---
as far as I know you can't, 1% is the best you can get
---
Think he’s referring to skill injections.
---
I was cracking up reading that. I'm pretty sure I've seen the same post word-for-word regarding EVE. Same thing with Elite.
---
Alright, that makes it simple at least, thanks.
---
I figured. I assumed you were "satisfied" with your major accomplishment and quit playing. Don't get me wrong, I'm okay with what you did. I just think we all could do it. It's like being proud because you stole your mom's purse with $100 in it and then bragged about it in a overly worded wall of text seeking some kind of glorified justification from others. Nice job mate. You got em!
---
I Think 0.75% was with good standings and accounting in 5. But ccp changed the way standings work with trading to like zero
---
I thought Horde and BL attempted the Branch Invasion and NC and PL were mostly against the deployment and stayed neutral.  Am I wrong?
---
Join CODE., praise James 315, then come back to me.
---
Holy shit. I googled that game just now. 
---
I played that. I was 14 when it came out. I totally forgot about how I became interested in EVE. Earth and Beyond ended, and I was searching for the next space MMO... I've been on and off EVE ever since. 
---
Thank you kind stranger for reminding me.
---
Up voted for the excellent song choice, Hell March ftw!
---
Don't make me come back.  Don't dangle the carrot so temptingly in front of my ice cold capsule.  I languished in mediocrity on and off for a while, each time coming back promising myself that is do better this time...
---
Your spin machine is working pretty good, keep it up.
---
Would allow for Siphons to be a thing again too.
---
CCPlz. Siphon play was great, despite the idiocy of APIs.
---
the shared skill could grant access to both sets of modules/ammo, with specialization granting t2 usage of the specific mods/ammo.
---
like i get you but i'm still mad at ccp
---
&gt; It did tank it easily with active adc.
---
you don't say
---
Nice to see Dorkness FCs are still trash. GOTG is really on its last legs if they're losing to a 3rd tier alliance like SkillU when they have equal numbers smh.
---
well, that's the thing
---
they can tank hilarious amounts of damage for a ridiculously long time, but usually they don't. why? because they're fit like garbage because they don't need to tank, they push cyno and panic and their tank is the teleporting supers and faxes
---
make fitting choices matter for rorquals too
---
Other than Jita JF trips, I know of no one that hangs out in high sec or is a high sec care bear.   
---
Truthfully,  when we roam out from null and have to go into highsec, many of us forget the safety button and we lose a few every trip to dumb things like shooting some guy that is neutral or the local police chase us because of bad sec status for awhile and we lose guy here or there to that.   
---
Lastly, Why be a highsec care bear when you can be a nullsec care bear and make more ISK per hour?
---
Funny, cause that's what I kept hearing from GOTG and even Pandemic Horde about their relationship to PL and NC.  It's where the term "bluetral" came from.
---

More so in delve when we are home its a wild super fleet appeared
---
Yeah, talk to the boys in the SU8A pocket. You can run a long enough campaign of pure harrassment and keep your income secured. 
---
Those fights happened all the way up to the moon changes. Citadels on moons aren't going to go away, but the mechanics around their timers can and should be changed to be more in line with POSes. It was a more balanced approach to structures, even though I enjoy the QoL changes that citadels have brought.

Imagine thinking anything else would happen when you have 10x the members of NC.
---
Hey. I don't make the stats. I just report them.
---
&gt; f. And yes, trust me, getting better skills helps a LOT. I've invested pretty heavily in hacking and exploration, and it's like a night and day when you skills get better. Also, Astero with 1 rig for stronger scanning is a must. With it you can scan down sleeper caches, which are 50-200 mil per site(just today I had 300 from one though, very lucky on blueprints).
---
[WIKI LINK](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/3P38_Sleeper_Nexus)
---
The wiki on  Sleeper Caches claims that you need a Data &amp; Relic Analyzer II. Have you found that to be true?
---
Yeah, when you can let your skill queue expire then make a whiney support ticket and have CCP give you all the SP you would have earned had you been training instead of being told to fuck off, you know Eve has gone soft... I remember when they wouldn't refund SP when you're queue ran out because you couldn't log in due to them updating their game and breaking it.
---
Check out it's [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwGbLVdQBig) very Eve feeling.

Reduced skill levels as well as only having sub optimal fits.

Carry a mobile depot. When anchored in space while you are near it you can refit your ship without docking up.

And just imagine that rush when you finally make the breakthrough, finally achieve something worthy of greatness ;)

&gt; not watching D-Scan or they're just unbelievably bad

"Well they're not real gamer. If you're going up against real gamers then you can't kill em." That's "not a real j spacer". If everyone played perfect it'd be an issue, but as shown by zkill, people aren't perfect and die all the time. How do you quantify what is or isn't enough death and how is it not going to be completely arbitrary?
---
I made a new alt that has good scanning skills, archeology 5. I made 1 billion in 2 days of light exploration mostly in J space. My best advice is to find a low class wormhole and go down the chain a few holes looking for C1 C2 and C3 wormholes. Exploration is definitely still a fine way to make beginner isk.
---
A T2 fit single Mag stab Hype tanks 1.6k dps with hardshell 3, improved exile, no links and no askleps. A T2 Leshak with 2 Rad sinks does 2.1k dps with no drones and a clean pod. With 4 Wasps that number goes to 2.35. Even a single rad heat sink Leshak spools to 1.8k with no drones, no drugs, and no implants.
---
A T2 fit Hyperion most certainly doesn't tank a Leshak at full spool, and a T2 fit Leshak can definitely tank a Hyperion at Void - which does 800 dps with 1 mag stab, and 950 ish with 2 mag stabs cold. This is of course with Neutrons with void in optimal, the best case for Hyperion. Of course, a 2 mag stab Hyperion tanks only around 1.2k cold. 
---
We're not even talking about the fact that the Leshak's cap is way better than Hyperion, or the fact that the Leshak has 4 utility highs to the Hype's 1.
---
There's a thing to orbit.

Keeping it real
