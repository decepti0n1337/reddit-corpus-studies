My first week or two of Eve I traveled there late at night.  Got in and out completely unharmed (no cloak either iirc).  One on my most memorable times playing this game.  Later I was scouting lowsec systems for good PI planets with low customs taxes and happen upon that dead end chain.  I spent about two months in lowsec completely alone just logging in learning/doing pi and the logistics of doing pi in lowsec.  Good times.

It’s EVE related - I do have a very powerful pc (can play most triple A titles with max settings) and EVE is the only game with issues. Freezes, lags and so on. Don’t know why. I’ve cleared the cache, did a fresh installation - but all problems are still there.

Yeah, exactly this. FW has slowly died almost completely. Only few players left. Bit sad because it is still excellent place for newer players to train pvp basics and earn huge amount of isk while doing that. The restrictions to gameplay are too huge though. It is great for really small groups or solo players but no self respecting ceo of bigger corp would want to touch that pile of turd.

That's what Aether is for, it's a massive parallel "cloud" platform they can run a new Eve backend on. They have MS Azure branding on the promo now, so that's the server service they will use.
---
Right now all Eve players are clients on what is a central mainframe, if this works for ccp they can be free of maintaining their own hardware.
---
Or you play with other real people. But this is also hardcore mode i guess.
---
I realized that after two toons with 10, had to change up the game plan. Damn market forces.
---
I wouldn't say it was PERFECT, but people really overreacted.
---
But that's the issue when you let a game go towards certain play styles and then change it. The people that like it were already driven out by the other stuff, and now those that moved there don't want it to change, even if it is better.
---
The main issue is that it could have benefited from having some other changes occur with it.
---
Nullsec is mostly only profitable for the bulk of players due to the safety they can basically guarantee in areas near their home space. Without that, highsec missions become competitive because of their relative safety.
---
Having some things that increased the reward potential to those willing the brave the space could have worked well. As it stood, it was blackout without the payout that wormholes have, with the main difference being the ease of logistics which is also a double edged sword as it is easier for people to come hunt you the easier it is for you to get stuff out.

But DAMN people flipped their shit.

Dude, the company that owns the game reverted the change. That ought to tell you something.
---
This is very VERY hard to pull off correctly.  Fitting something that can both run the escalation AND pvp is not easy.  You lose a lot of the optimisation needed to run the harder escalations when you use midslots for tackle and application.  Aside from this you need to consider the likelihood of anyone actually coming after you.  I used to run escalations in lowsec in my pvp vargur, i literally did nothing else for 3 months straight and in that time there were maybe 3 attempted drops on me.  One time IVANA bridged a black ops BS fleet and then sent another vargur + recon + gila as tackle.... Lol.  Didn't stay for that.  Another time someone dropped two carriers on me.  Couldn't even stay on grid long enough to dunk their tackle proteus, I just had to get the fuck out.  Third time I actually got a fight that I could take, but I went a bit too hard and dunked their tackle so quickly that the rest of the gang bailed.
---
Ever heard of sticking points on recons or other ships that have a flex mid? All you need is one guy not to fly a cap and BOOM you have tackle.
---
I hear t3cs tend to be really good at holding tackle.
---
I interested one of my alts into a super, but she only every flies noon tackle frigates or sabres. I would rather have that toon in a super, but if we need tackle, she tackles
---
The elitist attitude that you are too good to fly tackle (or whatever ship) is wrong. Fleet fights are a team effort. You need to do your part, whatever role you are given. If they ask you to fly tackle, you fly tackle, because that's what the team needs.
---
Hi, what system are you in?  Asking for a friend.
---
You fly noob-proof supers instead.
---
Yes it tells me that the percentage of whiny carebears is too high already to turn this game around to a good one again ...
---
You could have non noobs flying tackle.
---
There have been no changes to WH space yet. Besides increased spawns in drifter hives.

Is it possible that the code for upwell structures is sufficiently different from POS and their mods that this type of change isn’t possible?
---
After all, we can have multiple citadels per grid.
---
Can you please submit a bug report from in-client on Sisi so we have your user/corp info etc?
---
Cheers for the replies peeps. I guess it makes sense, less logistics, just sit there and suck rocks. Like the early days I played and you'd find a single hauler with a mining laser point at a rock for 2hrs. I used to turn up in a hulk and melt the rock.
---
Beginning to wonder if I should resub, but then...
---
I just have the screenshots from my mate and I am still in office. Try to poke him to submit a ticket. Thx 4 reply.
---
That's a good point, remove all that.
---
The second isn't exactly accurate.
---
You can still pass bookmarks around by using a shared folder. It's just a bit more of a pain to do. So you can sell your escalations. you just can't do it in a fire and forget kind of way.
---
Yea that's just stupid. Please don't do this ccp. It is another limitation without any purpose in the game that will fuck people over when implemented.
---
No1 is talking about the real victim here: Remote Hull Reps.
---
That's a pod. I full pod majesty.
---
Hmm, change fax into a carrier and give it 2 rep tubes and 1 support fighter tube.  Now that could be interesting (note: make triage impact the fighters rather than local/remote rep bonuses and remove the ewar penalty from it).
---
It's possible and I accept that's a lot of work for ccp and have suggested multiple other options before.
---
They could allow us to anchor two per system to let us replace them without taking the entire system down. Jammers already have this attribute with multiple anchored but only one online.
---
Alternatively they could reduce the anchor times drastically for the next week or so and then shut down all in range of structures. If it took 1 minute to move instead of 1.5 hours it would be much better.
---
why would i not last long??
---
Alternatively, remove them from all carriers and if you want SS you bring subs to grid.
---
I'm of the opinion that the benefits outweigh the negatives on this one. They are changing how bookmarks work so that we can get access list bookmarks. The upper limit of 20k bookmarks is not something that a lot of people are going to hit. The hardcore hunters that have tactical on tacticals, sure, but your average Joe won't. There's probably performance considerations as well.
---
Gaining access list bookmarks outweighs losing the 60k bookmark slots.
---
There is definitely more wormholes to nullsec
---
pls feed to me
---
As it stands now, everything above 20k personal bookmarks will just get deleted......
---
I like the blue and white. The red is weirdly bright.
---
worst part is the spam corp invites/evemails from the channel
---
I'm upset ccp thought it was a good idea to let the gates be 200km from a Keepstar as a "content generator".
---
yes i have 6 fleetmates in supers too to tackle the guys I can't tackle
---
not again :(  
---
this region is populated by assorted small alliances. dont confuse test with legacy (a coalition of alliances). TEST live in eso for the most part... again with the bad assumptions...
---
You learn by doing. Losing ships is part of the process. Just make sure that each death teaches you something and eventually, it will balance out.
---
Thats really not the point. People keep assuming that increasing "must dos" will improve a game. It really really doesnt, that just means you have more obligations. And that shit kills a persons will to play a game faster than anything else.
---
Boredom and fun dont go hand in hand, you either pick boring changes and basically force people to do more work for the same activity or you develop new activities with a better fun factor. Guess which method works best for player retention?
---
It's still a precedent, and ccp should be looking for way to stop players from players to have to sit and watch timers. I understand it's hard to love them but there are plenty of easy solutions that hell alleviate the work they created for players.
---
&gt; The problem here is ccp designed these to be much weaker compared to their pos variants.
---
How are they weaker?  By pretty much all metrics I can think of, they're heavily buffed over the old POS based ones.
---
There's no practical difference between an ESS save and a Rorqual save. If you are just cashing out personally, the only difference is warping to the ESS to cash out for 30 seconds vs just docking.
---
Hmmm, interesting.... learning new things everyday!
---
AUTZ will have a strange rise in the amount of structure reinforcement across all space. 
---
Unless said structures don't offline until structure damage is incurred. Probably won't happen until 2 months of constant goon navigation structures being hit.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Esoteria#jumps24 highest jumps below 4k you doubled the number fair enough how many characters did test have again ?
---
Very true. Seen it. Nothing is totally safe. Just rolling the odds.
---
Yep hell I've seen a PL fleet 40 strong come out of a WH into my home system in dessies and they went after a few orcas hoping they were afk and didnt have their invuls running or aug drones out.
---
&gt;who have turned EVE into Cookie Clicker didn't like it.  I would argue that's mostly fine.  People often don't like restricting mechanics that make the game successful.
---
Yeah, the null sec local blackout was completely unbalanced, because unlike w-space things like jump bridges, covert jump bridges, cynos, and covert cynos stupidly ramped up risk in a way that was *virtually* uncounterable, and then the cyno changes hit, which combined with the blackout just cemented the cheap cloaky bomber meta.
---
This made null sec so unfun for a large number of people playing the game there that they stopped logging in, which made the game unfun for their friends, who stopped logging in.
---
Legit, CCP pulled the plug on the blackout *not* because some of us were screaming at them to look at their numbers, both concurrent log-in numbers and subscription numbers. They pulled to plug on the blackout because someone at CCP *finally looked* at those numbers in a serious way, and CCP as an entity realized that this change was actually going to end up hurting their bottom line.
---
Keep yourself safe o7
---
So damage caps are good or bad, because it seems like people say they are good here but also say they are bad?
---
Check your loss mail
---
Details aside, you still havent responded to the massive surge of defense responses needed. Thats my main issue. Whats the positive side of this? Like why should we accept an atleast tenfold increase in pings? 
---
What is the reward for it? Cause I ofc see the upside for the roamers but what is the upside for the people living in NS? Like beyond a week of it when the fatigue starts to kick in and people just dont respond to pings anymore and slowly start to leave the game because the shit just got ten times more boring.
---
What do you want to give them to ensure they stick around?
---
I kinda have to steal it. Eh I mean I said it first. Ye, Sinatra is a good nick for it.
---
The positive side is that the ESS eventually ramps ratting income to 125% of what it is now, with an up to 1 Concord LP given out per 5,000 isk in raw rat bounty.
---
Thank you for your service
---
I agree there's a lot of cool potential even maintaining spacehonor and not abusing things.  I often look at UI mods and other tools commonly accepted (required) in other games and wonder what the EVE versions would be.
---
Are overlays in general banned?  I remember CCP suggested using Overwolf to get an "in game" browser back when the IGB was removed, so I wonder how much can be done within the rules.  Tools like PLH or PELD can float over the client, so I'm curious if there's anything else worth superimposing.
---
RIP to undock insta warp JBs from structures on a gate grid where they are closer than 1500km to the gate

God I miss how comparatively simple POS warfare was compared to how modern citadel warfare is. Only thing that CCP got genuinely right is being able to fit the citadel quickly (no 2 minute timer between modules), everything else could go away and I would not miss it.

No dude.  He was not "just saying" that.

There was a whole snarky-ness real and implied.  RE poster below also commenting on that.

OP asked for t3c fit.  Respondents here offered lots of "git gud" snarkyness...  Without any knowledge of the OP's pvp prowess...
---
You want to be nice, be nice straight off.  Something like: Dude.. I have no idea where you are on the pvp learning curve.  If you are on the "newer" end maybe consider cheaper options... that said, if you are dead set on t3c here's a fit...
---
Instead we get sarcasm, and put downs?  Get out of here.
---
"Are you really going to argue that the fit posted is a good fit to learn PVP in?!?!" - Sarcastic dudes in this thread offered NO fit, and fit above was posted well after the thread started.  I did not evaluate that fit, but if more people offered good fits and discussed their merits OP would be better off already.
---
Oh great, now I'm filthy cheater. Fuck you CCP, -15 Omega accounts for you.
---
Dope I’ll let you know if I can cut out of work
---
If you don't leave it the system won't leave it for you (not since the new chat system at least). However, if you're under 30 days old, the game will automatically rejoin the channel for you. So you can leave the channel on your older characters and it should not rejoin. If it does, please file a bug report about that.
---
Damn.  This post is full of comments like this.  I thought Spodbrain was just used as a basic insult for null players.  There really are players who are only good at mining and pressing F1 out there, huh?

---
she looks... dis-balancing
---
No, you put all those structures up. Now do the work that come from managing that much sov.
---
I mean, technically you were a filthy cheater as of three years ago or so
---
Playing video games has been a big part of your life since you can remember...but your life has changed, and that attitude has to change to accommodate it, and that means proper time management skills.
---
Just remember that your family takes priority.
---
Other than that, just find activities in Eve that suit your time available.  Don't let the game dictate the amount of time you have for work or family.
---
I see issues. But honestly, I dont wanna be the guy that sits there and shits on others ideas when I dont have any of my own. I can say I find it interesting tho but just not feasible. Its too onesided and gives the power over to roamers way too much.
---
If your corpie quits the game after losing a ship, you have some shitty corpmates.
---
Ah, the wonderful Goatse Nebula of Khanid space.
---
What kind of castrated corp/alliance are you from?
---
As a newbro, I've noticed that the EVE community seems to use the word "content" in a weird way that I am still trying to figure out. Is "content" another word for kills, in the context of EVE?
---
Pfft, what a poor.
---
Hi there and thanks for your answer. Iam absolutely with you. Of course the family is more important than playing games. Some friends of mine stopped gaming completely as they became Parents and not all of then are happy with that. I know that i would be unhappy too, so i look for a game that is fun to play in that few hours, when i have time. I guess i wanted to avoid comments like "Just stop gaming". But yes you are right: time Management is everything!
---
"I am speed."
---
So because it doesn't personally affect you it's not worth discussing. And when ccp creates something that costs you thousands of man hours that will aslo be fine?
---
Maybe we shouldn't support cresting arbitrary work because they have no foresight on how these things will work. No one is surprised these have to be moved because we all saw it coming but ccp still did it. What about if CCP decides citadels need to move? Are we going to have to pay trillions in rigs to move structures?
---
If you invent some kind of ship skin that says [Journalist please don't shoot] you might have a career idea, otherwise you'll probably run out of ships quicker than you'll get paid (or fly something cheap and be destroyed before even getting your pictures)
---
If they move them then people would just whine that it's in the wrong spot. Simpler to say "fuck off, *you* move it".
---
Forcing a handful of people to physically move these structures doesn't generate content.
---
I am not opposed to moving them, my problem is with the amount of work they are requiring players to do to fix their mistake.
---
Thank you, super appreciate the kind words! Takes me about 10~ hours normally to put a news update together :)
---
Because it starts messing with server performance.

---
Should wait for easter so you and doom bunny can do a duo special
---
These people can't decide if they like damage caps or don't like damage caps. They flip between how ever it supports their current argument.
---
Yea it's weird. So far I've understood it as "stuff to do". Since it's a super sandbox game there aren't the focus is less on what the game tells you to do and what you can make for yourself. So for example, if I go out looking for PvP, I am generating content for whoever runs into me. That's how I've understood it at least
---
So not nearly every metric. Just that 1 thing makes them better.
---
That would generate some content.
---
Believe it or not, I’ve interacted with Doombunny 0 times
---
This applies to all flex structures.
---
So the absolute highest number is 580 mil ISK per toon?  Even with some alts this seems like chump change?
---
Some smart person, please explain to me...
---
**edit: I do better than 580mil ISK per toon blitzing burners in HS for 3 hours.
---
I’ll let you know for sure before Tuesday
---
Hey man thanks. Who you with?
---
They're really good! I would say one thing I'd love to see more of is some of the FCing on smaller or unique scales. There were some things in the Loroseco podcast that were absolutely amazing that folks in other parts of the game would have no conception of, like how the type of static (a null static for example) can be a super important feature in thinking about evictions. 
---
Finding little things like that and just letting your guest kind of go on a little tangent into those areas is awesome. I'm sure Faction Warfare FCs, Wormholers, and small scale FCs have some really interesting things to say on those subjects.
---
PI for passive income and just do pvp small gangs. I basically docked when I had to regardless if in fleet as you need to be able to leave when required.
---
Boooooooo lore

Gtfo with that useless drivel. When will you pathetic lore people learn that the real lore of this game is the history of the meta and the players who participate in it.

Haha agreed.

Thanks so much!!!

What's your Gila fit look like?

Awesome, thank you!!
---
Hey!

As I already explained in the bug report and also mentioned in a different topic here: There is indeed an upper 20k limit, but this limit is only for how many bookmarks are being loaded from the server to the client. As soon as you either delete bookmarks or move bookmarks to a different folder (and then offline this folder) you can get further bookmarks from the server (but you need to either relog or first offline the folder and then online it again, to force refresh it from the server). There is currently a risk here, that you might delete a folder or subfolder, which contains bookmarks on the server, but which you are not seeing yet and I am investigating ways to avoid this. Btw: On TQ there is currently no properly enforced limit, but if you would have too many bookmarks, it will just fail (and we had an open bug about this for a long time).
---
In my last check there were about 100 players on Tranquility affected by this 20k limit and we are planning to contact them directly about this problem. Btw: How would you prefer to be contacted about such an issue? Per eve-mail? Through a regular email to the email-account, which is registered to your game account?
---
Just for completeness the full limits in the current version on Singularity:
---
* Max 5 online personal folders with 3000 bookmarks each 
---
* Max 3 online shared folders with 500 bookmarks each
---
For the case that folders are overfilled due to the migration:
---
* Max 20k bookmarks in total can be loaded from the server
---
* Max 3k bookmarks can be displayed in a single group (subfolder or directly in the folder) - to avoid client freezes (we have also included several client performance improvements in this area).

Btw: We considered your suggestions for the migration already in the past, but they would have increased the duration of the database migration considerably (our current estimate for the current version of the migration for TQ is about 30-60 minutes. For Singularity the migration took 1h 45 minutes).

Pando is just a puppet of the Imperium. Change my mind

I have gate tacs for like every direction in 40 + jumps

You can have shaded turrets or functioning local chat.

“IF you can rep the DPS” is correct

&gt; It’s rough that people are gonna have to do work to move them but like... is anyone gonna pretend that this wasn’t necessary instead of grandfathering existing ones in?
---
The change is necessary, the "Welp, we fucked up, guess you'll just have to deal with the hassle of cleaning it up even though you did nothing wrong," approach is pretty shitty.
---
If it's just too much trouble to literally move them, they should whip up some kind of reanchoring beacon that can be associated with an invalid structure and adheres to the (new) valid anchoring rules.  Let us anchor them, and then relocate the existing structures to the beacon coordinates during a downtime.
---
Those don't happen all at once, furthermore that again goes back to the point of a limit per system would be more realistic for performance concerns (you also would almost never only have 1 bookmark read per transaction).

I've been considering going solo/smallcorp

I like it and would invest.  CCP could easily regulate this and build in game mechanics to avoid scams (similar to how the FCC might regulate a hedge fund and FDIC insure your investment up to a 150k limit per account)

Jump in our discord dude come.say hello

Can you elaborate, I don’t really see the problem here.

Link the access temporarily to an „dummy“ when you create a token, after the player uses the token the „dummy“ gets replaced by the player ID.
---
I don’t know the first thing about coding but that sounds like a lot of work for a few CCPers to just “whip up”.
---
Plus that way we end up with all kinds of wonky beacon placements and other stuff going wrong.
---
If seasoned logistics guys didn’t immediately realize that they were going to have to move them themselves then they weren’t as seasoned as they thought. 
---
People who are complaining don’t realize that CCP was just at Vegas, talking about getting the biggest bang for their buck in regards to Dev time, (I presume) while they complete the projects that the NPE Teams are working on.

Heh, that's cute ;)
