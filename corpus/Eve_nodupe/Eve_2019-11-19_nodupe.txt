mediocre attept at storry spinning, nothing of value really
---
---
---
I think you're forgetting why passive moon mining was bad and why it was changed. All it does is allows the big groups to spread their holdings further, beyond what they actually have the manpower to mine, because they can drop the hammer on any attempt to take away their ISK printers.
---
Give it two weeks, they'll be smoking 90% of the people in the game like a fine Cuban.
---
You'd make more money in Fountain, so try Initiative.
---
Well ccp already has prosthetic arms in game which you can use to identify with yourself. While amputees and gender are extremely 2 different things and should not be compared.
---
I'll be shocked if Rote does anything relevant, all they know how to do is camp M-0 in AT frigs.
---
How would one know or what are the indicators of a bot?
---
Are you doing this for Nullsec AsteroBots? There are some stupendously obvious ones that have been at it for months now.
---
When I used to do it, I multitasked. Hack a can while scanning the next 3. I always had time to hack 2 cans if I was fast.
---

---
Alternatively, I became speed. Screw scanning, I tanked my frigate against pure explosive damage (which is the can explosion damage type). Hack 3 of them, if the fleet shows up, cancel hack, eat an explosion, and warp off before the fleet shoots me.
---
Just provide the API key for your old char and explain that you don't like the name.
---
ha tears... good old nullbear get back to mining.
---
man that explains the total lack of clavo fleets I've seen lately :-(
---
this is not how i want to find out, not like this.
---
10 hours a day of burners is an Origin members wet dream tbh.
---
Your obsessed mate, it's kind of sad.  Your little chums in SV would (unsolicitied) send me all your chat logs of you acting all superior and how you despised Havish and I.  We had a good laugh over those.  The more you badmouthed us the more we pinged fleets out.  If I had raged quit mate, I could have plastered them all over the forums.  But I didn't, I asked to be removed from the roster, then spent a leisurely week sorting out my affairs before departing for INIT.
---
vexor navy is good. might smuggler on a few l3s, myrm like the other buy said is a good choice. drone boths are the go too for pve.
---
The people who don't dance don't reply ab, you've danced before and you will twirl again. It's who you are.
---
That being said, I would be surprised if you were not accommodated within 2 years - just not to the peril of anyone else's gameplay. Development the right way. 
---
There will be a battlefield for you.
---
Play in the snow with the other snowflakes
---
vni is now kind of hit or miss...dps and application depends on the fit you running: worst case scenario 3 x T2 heavy drones w/ guns = 389 DPS with all lvl 5. In order to apply more dps via guns you need to be short range and at this point you sacrifice speed tanking + it takes longer since you will have to chase after rats.

Did you let Theran in? This level of riposte is right up their alley.

ugh fucking shitposting shit poster

hahahaha wonderful

Take guides, wiki, some good advices in this topic and dont read r/eve again

Its a toxic environment for a new player
---
Lore wise it is agreements between the empires to prevent capsuleers from growing too powerful and massively destabilizing their non invasion pacts. Concord left a backdoor hack in all capsuleers as part of the process that effectively disconnects you from the ship and leaves you inert in your pod.
---
we are the strongest coalition
---
Thank You!
---
You want rogue drones, Thats how rogue drones are made.
---
"Let's go be dicks over there to those guys."
---
Yeah, it would.  Rapid diminishing returns on tanks or offense means more leeway for fitting things like ECCM or tracking on non-specialist fits.
---
If you have specialist frigs doing 1-2 things well, then it seems interesting to have a non-specialist BC or BS doing 2-3 different things to influence the battlespace.
---
Good bot.
---
It is technically possible to instalock even a pod, so there is no such thing as "untargetable" when it comes to avoiding getting locked via a low align time.
---
Usually you will be fine if you have an align time of under 2  seconds (2.01 seconds = 3 seconds, due to the game mechanics), but you can - and sooner or later WILL - be caught.
---
Yep, keep an eye out for the Rapid Fire update
---
Likely around Nov 26 from the rumblings I've heard.
---
In spirit with other changes, CCP will probably keep quiet until it's actually on TQ
---
next week it'll be every 4 weeks

Tell the whole truth and provide proof to recruiters, we like to look at ALL of you.

Baited on a free flair.

But he has not stated his side he could be flair baiting... while I, I am a GOON and you must GRRR.
---
Its just so depersonizing and, paradoxically, lonely in a group like that. Noone matters because there is always line member #1173 waiting to do the exact same thing as you. 
---
And no, ive never considered that because its not really that many groups ive joined that were trash. Just the large (newbro focused) nullbloc entities. Id say 90% of the groups I've been in have been quite solid people and fun to play with. Its mainly horde, karma, brave, etc that I take umbrage with. They throw you into a myrmidon to spin anomalies until you are told to hit f1 in a fleet where you don't think, you just anchor up and wait for the button press. Otherwise you are ignored and when you reach out to, yknow, find someone to play the game with, learn something, have fun, there is noone there because they dont have chat open on any of their rorquals.
---
There lies truth but the words you used arent well thought over.
---
One of the things that I monitor on the MER is ratio of Delve to Horde's income. They went from being less than 20% compared to Delve at the beginning of the year, to ~35%. The blackout affected them less and they recovered much faster than the Imperium did. While the Imperium is still building up steam, PanFam's location is very difficult to bring dreads in to kill krabs.
---
It's gone already, didn't you read?
---
If you want to believe this, go ahead. I still have enough contacts to Condi to know that a lot of your alliance mates are also pissed by the "goon way" of blueballing. 
---
I really wonder if thats anything goonswarm is able to do these days, since almost every competent FC and a shitload of ex - sv members is already gone...
---
Let me guess... conduits, right? They are a great bot trap. I suggest people in highsec just to check out their dscan and see the amount of trig wrecks there are and give the trig sites a visit. Trigs do not scram and warping at 100 is pretty much save even for a frig to see if the site is run by bots or not.
---
Yeah used to run a similar set up back in the day , Hecate is by far one of my favorites. Awesome job man
---
&gt;n0b0nus4hilmar

  Interesting name choice while throwing around a wild accusation
---
Tbh I'm not sure what evidence would be convincing enough in this case. A 15 minutes long video of mining while keeping a named depot in view?
---
Can confirm
---
Fuck.
---
The typical will happen. They'll make some idiotic change (like you said probably to autocannons). Then the community will point out all the problems connected to that change. They will half fix that change then. For that they then want to be padded on the back although it's still far away from a good solution which could have been achieved with the same work or even less.

You don't believe me just wait or see ansiblex changes.

#BUTTERY MALES
---
Really Brisc? 8 variations? It sure sounded like only one reason came out if you pay attention: "I was a scapegoat" basically. Like can you seriously sit there and listen to that for over an hour and come away with anything else?
---
If he wasn't scapegoated, why were other Capital FCs/Coordinators/Leadership on the drops? And why weren't they kicked from the Alliance? That's called scapegoating....
---
Jgamp isn't perma bubbled by some Australian dude.  Strictly inferior.
---
&gt;  I get triggered by ships that have more physical hard points than actual hard points because the model looks off
---
#Hecate has eight hardpoints and five turrets.
---
According to the forum last patch was at November 12th, so the next one should be expected around 26th.
---
Wow, please tell me you haven't actually been baited this hard.
---
I would definitely put the 2 examples on the same level. Hate crimes everywhere.
---
Does it count that I am a dick sometimes towards explorers? (ingame)
---
That's one dude.  We aren't all that rich.  We're mostly a roaming alliance, but FE has been taking up our normal roaming times recently.
---
Time to hunt
---
Yeah I saw some people are having the issue after messing with monitors, I didn't change anything with my monitor setup, the only thing that changed was the Windows update, but my launcher started going black before that so I have no clue
---
But I see opportunities for locally strong groups in Lowsec again to take back moons they can conquer, but usually not actively mine (Lowsec too scary, no people willing to mine for hours). Like after Phoebe patch ALL of the R64 of the richest R64-lowsec region belonged to 2 local alliances with 550 and 300 chars (LSH + AXIOS.)
---
And be sure that if passive moon sticks were back today, Aridia tomorrow would have dozens of reinforced R64. If you want to control the moons you would have to live there and deploy your big toys there
---
It's very frustrating. I have had it go black after an update previously too and unfortunately a complete reinstall was the only way I found fixed it.
---
If you can salvage your overviews from the eve folder it will make it far less of a chore.
---
How expensive is very expensive? Looks like i can get a good 20 mil out of my old character
---
Lawless Yellow Penis
---
Yes I know; which is kin of my point.
---
Running someone like him really doesn't seem too far fetched. These are the people who coined the term honeypot. Their job isn't justice, its infiltration and corruption. They love this kind of dirt.
---
otoh, If you tell someone you are CIA and they believe you, All he really needed to do was be able to convince the right person to tell the judge that. 
---
It does sound like the Judge believed it and acted on it. Whether it was true.... really could go either way.
---
You should check those rules yourself. What he did was not breaking any of the rules posted on the goon forums.
---
All the chromosomal abnormalities meaning people have a mixture of  male and female physical features would disagree with you, and that's before we even look at anything that isn't basic and physical.

so looking forward to anti-cap bombs to finally have a counter to brainless cap drops
---
I've had a random MTU named MTU X being renamed to default sometimes. It's probably not limited to your 4th June, but just an irregular bug.
---
That's a dick move ))
---
Hero bubbles and tackles just feel amazing
---
yes sure, botters take space wherever they can. but they are not "set up" and extra protected by these groups.
---
On the other hand, until proven otherwise, they are considered "normal" renters. Pitty that players get booted for that, but I understand it's not that easy to distinguish.
---
Anyways, with the very much improved sentinel tool. It seems that CCP finally got a firm hold on the problem, reliefing alliances from the constant need to scan allies and renters for bots...
---
Will make it simpler to make newbros understand the whole thing.
---
For example stealing over a trillion in excavators helps
---
Except all the non-residents.
---
Oh please would you stop it. I used to be in TEST and had some chats with some of the bigger heads in the alliance. They said they knew that there are many bots in Legacy and TEST renters but they do not kick them because else the botters would just go to the enemy and they get all the free iskies.
---
PI + skill farm

That always comes to mind when someone says two weeks.

With of course capital abyssal sites and chance drop. Capital tractor beams gonna be a thing soon
---
Maybe the humor missed you. This is not an epic PL video. This is a shitpost about ourselves and Overman’s excessive saltiness after we fed. That’s all it is. It was a couple guys on a Friday night making bad decisions and having some fun and not taking life so seriously.
---
lol "it's CCPs fault"
---
Pi + skill farm + drops makes it easy especially when you can drop expensive shit. He also has an insane amount of isk from stealing excavs. I think he said he also has alts in major alliances for ratting/isk generation. It's really more of a time issue than anything else.
---
Yup. Some tricks involved to make it all work but mainly catching them without rocks and NOT in keepstar/fort range is the main goal
---
Wonder if the relic bots still go around..... "time to hit Zkillboard to check out"
---
Thats just not true. I spent a month and a half on an alt in horde and very rarely would anyone reply to the requests for help. It would be like 8 hours before an NBI would be on. I was handing out isk because people couldnt get replacement nbi ships and shit. That was daily for weeks. And I play in ustz
---
Unironically: yes
---
What about uncle Myrmidon?
---
Dran will be in soon to tell you how he doesn't tolerate bots and if you report them to him he will fix it, he has no way to know if they're bots otherwise :headtap:
---
In other words you ran away.
---
Dude the simple idea of playing like that makes me want to puke and almost makes me have a stroke that would end it me shitting my own pants. It's painful really. 
---
(btw you're not killing anything, sorry to tell you)
---
the erebus has a bonus to drones? O\_o
---
isnt the standard goon answer "its not our leaderships job to punish botters. thats CCP's job." I assume that's also true for their TEST pets.
---
Diminishing returns exist in j space too, there just are more than enough holes to farm than people in j space.
---
Ok goon-mer

Twit.

Fits got not an issue if your taking gates with enemy Sabers in system.

well thats rule 4

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

they would never answer a question like that. it would give bot writers more information to avoid detection.
---
I had problem joining a null sec alliance because I mentioned I used to play the game 8 years ago but sold my characters for isk....
---
Had to recover all my old accounts and show screenshots of the transactions showing I sold 2 characters lol...
---
seemed to help that I had spent real money on my new char to get him up to 20mil sp in one month though..  
---
TLDR: when joining null sec never mention you used to play the game years ago.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Boomer
---
He gets paid to camp delve as well. So that on top of extraction and PI
---
Doesn’t prove anything. They were probably just spies pretending to be boting in order to discredit Legacy. We tend to have a lot of those.
---
i always thought project discovery and bot detection could be merged somehow to have players help with the detection process.
---
You bring up a good point, though im not sure what the ramifications will ultimately be
---
This is a lie.  You don't just want the fight.  If you did you'd just go attack some random Athanor regardless of whether it's moon mining or not.
---
You just want the income from doing precisely fuck all.
---
lmao Olmeca Judy
---
Ahh. DTU's are a major turn on.
---
Hey look you found the problem with the rorq you win the prize of... An unbalanced game.
---
Good to know that CCP fights botting more serious these days.
---
Yes he lit a covert cyno to bridge in the recon cyno for the dreads. It's a smarter way to do it than gating a recon through Delve. It both guarantees your cyno gets to the right place, and doesn't give away your target location until the cyno is lit.
---
Ahhh good ole ghost sites
---
You 2 are adorable
---
Yeah Delve KS's lock up to 490 which should be the DD range. I could have cynoed the dreads a bit further. Idk what happened in this case. Probably nobody gunned it on time. The whole ordeal doesn't take more than 2 mins.
---
Ah so kinda sounds like he doesn’t have complete control over who shows up then
---
This is a serious hit to Delve economy. Should pe posted on reddit! ... oh wait.
---
Just wait till the powerhouses blue them and start mentoring them to SC ratting and Rorqual mining lol.
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99009553/
---
Still going to cost you much more than any gank ship now. Caps are also omega only, so you've got to commit to a paid account to gank with them.
---
There could be a high sec capital pilots license that you need to pay for in ISK, that gets revoked if you gank with it or something too.
---
Ganking capitals would be damn near impossible too, unless they aren't tank fit, so that's another issue. It shouldn't be easy to gank with them, but it shouldn't be impossible to gank them either. Currently the only high sec caps are freighters for that reason.
---
I'd be interested if CCP did implement them though
---
Ah nice, ad hominem, incompetency, childish rants ... are you 12?
---
Eve has rules?
---
sounds like you wanna gank, not fight
---
Afaik CCP is working on Dx12 and Raytracing at the moment. they mentioned it during Evesterdam if I remember correctly.
---
Panaemic Horde Reeeeee
---
.......does anyone think the vaga is weak?
---
790 billion? Those are rookie numbers.
---
Or, it could all just be a cloud of bullshit obscuring why he was actually kicked. Honestly, the entire interview sounded like every narcissist I've ever heard desperately trying to point out that everybody else did things wrong except him, and he must be the victim. I don't know why you guys are so easily bamboozled.
---
Goons have how many members, and there are what? Four dudes and me here, and I'm not even in Goons?
---
I'll take athanors not being able to target ships and more nerfs to the PANIC now that the blackout is over tyvm.
---
Hard to leave when you're not a member.
---
This doesn't even make any sense.
---
If you don't gate around and dscan your path before warping you're fine.
---
Bubbles only work if you warp after they're set up. If they're anchored you see them on dscan. Easy as that...
---
Yes absolutely, when we go into a staging system with a Keepstar on a Gategrid with 30 people docked with our totally OP gang of a brawly T1-Battleship + a Battlecruiser + a Cynabal and wait for 40 minutes (no shit) for them to form 25 people with HAW-Dread-Backup, we totally wanna gank ....
---
Usually *just* skillpoints. You almost never see GMs even try to recover assets.

just report them

THIS LINE FOR APPLYING FOR A TIS-DISCORD-INVITE
---
Passive income used to fund all the alliance SRP that every line member recieved in the past, Krab alliances have switched over to ratting taxes for SRP since its removal.
---
The removal of passive moons encouraged more renting as it is the only viable income for a pvp alliance. 
---
I've only heard arguements for passive income to return from everyone with a brain. Even [smooth brained Mittani](https://clips.twitch.tv/GlamorousNaiveVelociraptorOptimizePrime) confessed on the meta show that he was wrong and passive mining should be brought back in some form.
---
be careful you can be kicked from Goonswarm for not doing your duty
---
Jokes on you when I disband they are returning to you
---
I dont think you understand how insurmountable 20bn net worth is to new players. Thats like telling a college grad "oh yeah starting a business is easy, just use your 50 million dollars to secure angel investment, its simple" i know plenty of folks who have played for near a decade that have never had 20 bn net worth, or even close to it.
---
nah... definately Sharon from HR
---
WHAT IS TRASH IN EVE?
---
I don’t buy into stupid Reddit narratives about who does or doesn’t undock for fights.
---
They way bots react towards other players. 2 years ago I made a post about relic bots and how they operate. Those bots have a scripted path set up for them to follow everyday. If someone reported a suspected bot in intell in a certain system I knew exactly where he'd be going next. Also soon you killed one you' d be put on a system wide avoid list for all the bots that operate under the person they belong to. They see you in system they'd just skip scanning and moved on to the next. Soon you killed one and let the pod go he'd just warp to the next system and idle on the other side as the script that normally would order the bot to drop probes can't do that due to being in a pod. AKA script broken. 
---
Now for ratting/mining bots in null it's play easy. They instantly warp to safety soon a neutral jumps in system. And after 20 min or so they warp back to the ratting/mining site. Neut comes back they insta warp to savety again and wait 20 mins, and so on and so on. 
---
Highsec conduits bots Gila version will just ignore you completely, even if you steal all their shit and they'd still continue ratting. 
---
The Rattlesnake version is a solo bot and will drop an mtu. Allot of people started to shoot the mtus and soon it explodes the bot just warps off to get a new mtu has drones set to passive to avoid the mtu murderers getting a green light to engage due to drones going yolo and shoot the attackers. Allot of the highsec mtu KMs with trig loot in them are from bots.
---
Always can leave goons my man. Fleets nightly here. Just building up us tz with less spodbrain
---
It doesn't.

Covert cyno on bomber -&gt; Recon bridged in -&gt; Recon lights normal cyno -&gt; Dreads jump in.
---
What part is subjective?
---
Investing 500 percent more effort for 20 percent more ISK?
---
Aye. Choices. 
---
You want a no commitment return you have alpha.  
---
New interesting content that a player wants to binge on.  You have 1 month on Omega.
---
Those are options for high use players.
---
There are few options for those who want to casual play and who don’t mind a few restrictions if it permits them to dip in and out at their leisure.
---
The DLC options can be good, particularly when they 50% discount them, as another option. 
---
Give the wide variety of players a wider choice of membership.
---
Ayup!
---
Someone running 20 bots devalues it many dozens of times more.
---
I mean, let's not confuse it with the next Civil Rights movement or something, but remembering Tienanmen Square is probably a good thing on its own merits, especially in light of the CCP's recent attempts to enforce their lies on the outside world.
---
I can definitely work with a profit margin like that. Now, the hard part is getting everything down in my system lol
---
Was wondering if this would work on wormhole fires for an eviction scenario. Tried it with a friend and got a sub 1second lock on an interceptor on PYFA. Tried a few times and I WAS catching the inty. Notb100%, but it is possible.
---
Yeah on the same page.
---
Koreans like hard games. Give them a hard game.
---
Yes

I figured the same, but eve has enough drama over stupid things I couldn't be sure.  I would have been shocked if goons got angry over coms for anything less than like 2 titans.
---
ANY OF YOUS COME AT ME, ILL DEADLIFT ANY OF YOU AS LONG AS YOU ARE BELOW A CERTAIN WEIGHT, AT LEAST UNTIL I GET STRONGER
---
Not defending anyone here but I'd multiboxed domi's a lot and that could have easily been them pre-aligned fleet warping to a structure (basic ratter tactics) and then them going afk because they think they're safe on the tether. I've seen it happen before.
---
I've yet to see any actual evidence of of botting in this entire thread, other than names - and there are people that really just don't give a care about their character names. "Jita Alt 1" must be a botter right?
---
I thought Flat Earthers didn't play EVE
---
ALPHA CLONES ARE NOT REAL PILOTS, THEY ARE JUST LAZY LEECHES #OMEGAPRIDE
---
The point is I could add a zero to my net worth in six months, so after one hour of salvaging you have 0.1bn and in six months with zero salvaging whatsoever, you can have 1bn in delve. Easily, because its quicker to double it the smaller the initial amount is, contrary to the real world. If you salvage just ten hours total in two months, six months later its gonna be 10 billion. 5 billion if you spent your first five hours of salvaging on a selection of t1 alpha doctrine ships (that you can get endlessly reimbursed as you lose them in important fights). 
---
That humanity as a whole shuns compound interest is only a reflection on the past, not that individuals must follow that behavior in the future.

Some follow up questions:
---
• When you talk about getting comfy in jspace w pirate/relic/data sites, what does that mean, exactly? Does it mean “stick to C1,2,3 holes, and be aware that those are also PVP enviros and keep my fingers crossed  when I’m in jspace in the Vex or Dom?”
---
• Should my jspace Vex/Dom fit absolutely be a PVP fit?
---
• Is there a measurable experience threshold that I can work towards in jspace, beyond which it would be time to upgrade to a better ship?
---
• In order to be happy in jspace am I going to have to be happy with lots of PVP interaction?
---
• Have you been at this for a while, and what TZ do you play in?
---
And yeah, from what I’ve read, my PVE fit Dom wouldn’t last 1 minute against an experienced PVPer in well-fitted hunter. and while I can afford to lose it, I’d really rather not.
---
You know what, you don't even need to bring your RL into this. Your job *in Eve* is to be a dissembling, misleading politician for the Initiative. Anyone can see who's really spreading 'clouds of bullshit' here and it's the Goon side.
---
Sure. It's not cheap though. If you want a cheap ship, run a Rattlesnek with t1 mods. \~750 mil and 700 of that is the hull. This Rokh'll set you back a few isk.

8x Heavy Neutron Blaster II (Null M)

2X Dread Guristas Adaptive Invulnerability Field (Anything with 37.5% or better resistance works, doesn't have to be Dread Guristas)

Federation Navy Stasis Webifier

2x Magnetic Field Stabilizer II

2x Dread Guristas Drone Damage Amplifier (Drone Damage Amplifier II will work fine)

You'll need to reinstall the game and reformat your hard drive

SIEGED DREADS ARE AN ODD FORM OF SMALL GANG
---
I imagine you could RMT that for a sizeable amount, tbh. And when you burn your bridges that hard is it a problem to have the account banned?
---
only go to sites with pirate names (guristias, blood, angels, etc)
---
the other ones are wormhole sites.
---
I just wish the circle would end with people actually giving me the information I ask for rather than wasting time virtue signaling about a problem they're unwilling to help me solve.  I don't care if they assume I'm bluffing or not I just want the reports.
---
Literally, if you think I'm shit PLEASE call my bluff.  Come to catch, hunt whoever you think are bots, take shadowplays, and then send them to me.  Then if I don't investigate feel free to go make a Reddit post about it.

*calls alex jones*

UWOT
---
Lol you sound exactly like the french after germany conquered belgium in 1914
---
How long do you think it takes botters to create a new fake account and inject him into an astero?
---
SPEAK UP CUNT
---
Is it even worth it though?  You traded 6 dreads and a carrier for three rorqs, and they owned the field after the drop.  Hell, if the rorqs had launched their excavators instead of leaving them in hull you would have barely been above even on the isk count.
---
idk, this was a really cool drop, but are moves like this really worth it except for entertainment?
---
Even msm has more credibillity then imperium news  and msm is a complete joke
---
Meh would have been dead quicker if I wasn't hitting the bong.......
---
Matteral is indeed full of horseshit 
---
Biased and powerhungry
---
Good point. 
---
Guess it was me thinking about there being a level of commitment required to get the discounted monthly sub.  Not sure how you would charge plex for a Delta sub. 
---
Plus I guess I had an unnecessary concern Delta might be a new way to unfairly max farm isk for funding another omega account via plex but I guess that still is all good as it fits the profit model.
---
Beauty, thanks for the detail, much appreciated! I most definitely do not know what I’m doing... but I’m learning!
---
Outstanding move
---
Where did you end up?
---
Props to him for using it.
---
Yeah the resemblance is striking. I wonder whether the censor overlords consider this acceptable or whether they will demand the trigs to redesign their ships to protect our fragile boyish souls.
---
Yes, it’s called the ship tree in an app called Eve Online.
---
:sob:
---
&gt; EDIT: NOT FEATURED THERE IS THE 40-MAN PL JACKDAW FLEET THAT DIDN'T DO JACK SHIT
---
I AM SHOCKED BY THIS EDIT. ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. WHEN WILL PL FINALLY GET PULLED FROM LIFE SUPPORT AND KNEEL TO KING GOBBINS?
---
You could try Neocom II, I think that may be what you are looking for. :)
---
As long as they are finishing the sites and not cherry picking, it's not a problem.

As a Slav (of southern flavor) i can tell you that these names have meaning and might be relevant to speculation. For example "narodnya" clearly comes from "narod" which means people, in this form it can be people translated as possessive form of "people" so "people's \[something\]". Navka is interesting. In some Slavic languages there was a tendency to replace "u" with "v", so if you do that here, this sounds very much like "nauka" which is literally "science" (might be "education" in some langs?). And koschoi; this one i dont know, but it kinda sounds like "kost" which means "bone" and koschoi would be a group of people with prominent bones?
