Try fitting *something* on your ships.  I don't believe they scram you so you could have just warped off.  Especially if you had fit agility modules to warp faster and/or tank.

Goons on the offensive vs the world: a horrible slog where nothing changes hands for a long time because supers only get used on the defensive side while the sov war is slowly fought to take down jammers.

My IQ dropped 50 points just reading that thread. Bob have mercy.
---
this is gonna sound weird but i appreciate the people that say things i disagree with here on r/eve. sometimes my opinions about the game get a little too strong and it's nice to be reminded that i don't have all the answers.
---
Wonder if this will lead to a low sec revamp with faction warefare getting a boost. So if my corp is loyal to trash i can take systems from kador
---
I haven't tried EANM. Does it render which IDs go with which accounts/characters? I always had to figure that out by hand launching EVE and seeing which char/core .dat files changed.
---
I need a good case for why I can listen to the FC with voice chat and it won't make me swear and be a target for pedophiles.  I'm 13.  Any ideas?
---
Can you repeat the question
---
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME NOW
---
also shoutout to anyone that's responded when i say "hi friends" to your fleets when they enter local. you guys are cool.
---
Yes but, what, just a random rat that comes and insta blap you? 
---
wtf?
---
Can confirm. All I do now is log in, poke my head out the null static in my retribution. I shoot anything that gives a km, while I harass the locals with insults in order to bait put a fight, then when they undock 3 battleships and a frigate to deal with my annoying retribution, I kill the frigate and gtfo while shit talking more in local.
---
Learning how to do my own programming has shown me just how difficult it can be to make an actual working product instead of just a simple collection of minor functions. I don't know how bad they have it at CCP, but with EvE being *sixteen years old* their coders must be in hell.
---
I hear this is actually not true... Theran Alliance in Vale btw
---
Shouldn't there be more duct tape?
---
Yeah but no. Haven’t you seen the steady decline in player numbers because this game is stagnating exactly because of the wishes of that large group of players.

Running the AT is the least of things. If they just got the tournament tools back up and running then we, the players, could host tournaments.

CCP already made changes to cynos which, as well as making blobbing on roamers harder, makes dropping an offensive cyno harder too. I've said in a few places that the next step after deleting local should have been to look at hot drops, for which there isn't really much of a counter.
---
Yeah, Exooki said that and suggested that his own space be made riskier and an exploitative way to generate isk be addressed. How many nullsec representatives supported anything like that for nullsec? Also, CCP has already done something about wormhole safety (increasing the spawn rate of wandering holes).
---
But ganking is dead..... And permits exist......
---
Yes that was basicaly the CSM high point
---
and yet people still lick his nuts around here after he does nothing but spin spin spin
---
And the liasons all have their own agenda and cannot be trusted
---
According to Dotlan they have been with NC. from 2010-09-28 19:29:00 to 2019-09-27 13:16:01. This is  '9 years, 11 months, 29 days, 17 hours, 47 minutes, 1 second'. I would have tried to get this as close to '10 years' as possible, but thats just me. Come on, this was so fucking close!!!
---
Are you saying there will atleast be fights involving 1000s of players? 
---
Sounds better than one-structure bashes.
---
That looks amazing.  ^.^
---
Logi can be boring when nothing is happening, but nothing beats the feeling of saving someone out of low structure. I still remember the first few caracal fleets I was on, when I flew an Osprey because I had no missile skills so my missile range was 20km shorter than the distance to the targets, and those were amazing. 
---
Honestly, that’s probably some of the most fun I’ve had as logi. Big nullsec fleets, everything is either alpha’d or saved easily. Wormhole fleets, it’s just a dps race, do your guardians rep more than enemy leshaks put out. Neuts and ecm are factors, but they just change the equation a bit. 
---
But flying in 40 man caracal fleets, against equivalent sized gangs? There were so many times people came within an inch of dying, and then your reps would land and they’d slowly come back to 100% shields.
---
The liaisons are on the record being against most of the things that people say have ruined the game. Rorqs in their current form, injectors, the version of blackout chosen, the list goes on, CCP is the issue not the they pay to be ignored.
---
What’s the reasoning behind this, anyway?
---
Capsuleer clones are grown in a lab, so it’s still technically vegan
---
Too expensive to risk in null ngl
---
Every single group I've played with in well over a decade of Eve have all been keenly following every AT, every year. People alarmclock to watch the streams, have AT parties, take fucking time off of work to watch some of those matches, and so on. 
---
If you don't understand how the kinds of people who are very much into the AT, both as participants and spectators, determine the content ratio in the rest of Eve, you're kind of deficient. 
---
Both the participants and the spectators will have a sizable amount of content generators, FCs, active PvP pilots and enthusiasts of every stripe and even just *one* missing AT has dropped several of these people from the face of Eve entirely. This has effects far beyond their immediate surroundings, compounding themselves every time more people find less content and thus less reason to ever log in again.
---
Without the core of turbonerds generating content, fights and enthusiasm about undocking, Eve can't even survive.
---
This entire reply chain is full of fucking morons.
---
Any other large nullbloc in the game would nuke you from orbit for having the balls to come to their staging for "gudfites", ie. why wont you whelp your kitchen sink bullshit into us cuz leliskpositive. BRAVE finally has enough and tells the rest of you to fuck off, and suddenly THEY are the shitters.  Get over yourselves.
---
Oh, and it's not the blue donut or the krabification of Eve. It was the 2013/2014 Catch turbofarm by still-peaking PL, the embarrassing shitshow that was COUPBOIS, and subsequent mass exodus and poach of 75% of the corp membership by PH and Karmafleet. BRAVE has been a tumbleweed blowing through a ghost town ever since.
---
This is the attitude that is killing eve.
---
Accurate!
---
Love, love me some Mitch.
---
An EVE themed D&amp;D game... I can't think of anything nerdier. I LOVE IT!
---
The issue with this approach is that n+1 favors alphaing anything that hits a "kill zone" of ehp... which is the ONLY solution to the current fax meta, but exacerbating the balance to more alpha-heavy doctrines isnt going to end well
---
I'm melting!!! Wat'a'world!
---
eve themed DND?
---
_im in_
---
We called it.  I'm not shitting on the optimists that held hope at all, there were people who loved the AT and justly so but we need to face reality.  The game is dying and CCP is doing everything they can to reduce overhead and max profits. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the "chaos era" was just to try to build steam in the positive direction just for damage control for this announcement.
---
It was a good time, what time we had before Pearl Abyss sunk their greedy fucking teeth into the ass cheek of such a unique experience.
---
Scrapheapchallenge would like a word. I forget what the other major Eve forum was called.
---
I said convenient.
---
Thank you for that. I didn’t catch that.
---
I think it's because they want to make nullsec small gang friendly so they can roam and kill any ship without any issues and CCP is listening this minority (for once they listen them heh) 
---
wormholer btw
---
back when I lived in nullsec, we did not had to blob any guy roaming around
---
Maybe you can answer what happened to Atlas? Did they Widot into Sm3ll?
---
I know right.....
---
I did exactly the same thing.
---
F
---
It wasn't. 
---
It's always been the myth of Eve, someone's ideal fantasy of what the game is. There's always been some truth to the intrigue, but never to the degree people pretend.
---
Similar to the claims of Eve's autism, or Eve's trolls, etc. So much about this game comes only from trust and reputation that trolling is much less than any other online game I've played. 
---
Part of that is probably due to there being no universal chat that all players across the server participate in. In stead, just a large collection of community run and moderated chats of various sizes and interests. Local chat during a large fleet fight (and Jita) is the closest the game has. There you have trolling.

"I have a thermal armor class of 16, so he misses that, but he rolled an 18 on a kinetic attack roll so I take half damage"

---
Alpha heavy meta will not happen as this is subjected only to faxes . subcaps still rep you the way the rep normally which means triage will be more effective in keeping caps alive due to massive reps while being less than useful to subcaps. Which solves most of the problem what the CSM is discussing about . With Hull energizers and so on alphaing caps is still a rare possibility .
---
I must have missed something
---
There’s no accounting for taste, but by and large I’d rather fight thank gank.  But if all the people I’m trying to fight want to do is gank, all I /can/ do is gank.  
---
I’m not going to just feed ships to a super.
---
It's true, it was less convenient. But it was also expected. You knew that there were forums where people talked about games, and if you were invested, you asked or found out about them from other players.
---
But those forums were far more insular than the large social media sites are, and were thus greater echo chambers. Cliques formed around their associated forums, and the people who frequented them espoused the same ideals, and would brigade and troll other groups they disagreed with. EG, the really 1337 forums for the high end players would fuck with the forums that were frequented by the more casual players.
---
Now that social media is far more concentrated and easy to find, you have more mixing of voices.
---
Under the missile launcher you'll see a new tab, "Used with" that shows you what ammo it can use. HAM's cannot use auto-targeting missiles, you're probably thinking of regular Heavy Missile Launchers, who can fire auto-targeting heavy missiles.
---
What an asspull of a statement. You need people to run it and you know they were trying to get enough staff to do it.
---
Depending where you are, PaySafeCard
---
And yet, 90% of this sub reminds me of the same things being said over and over then, as they are now.  Eve is fundamentally the same game it was when I started playing it 13 years ago.  The largest difference is in how WE play the game.  Orbiting rocks, orbiting rats, orbiting salt pockets, it's all the same.
---
6 month non compete clause 😂
---
Is there a way to set drones to only defend me, and not attack enemy ships that aren't attacking me? I'm thinking of using a hurricane as an artillery boat with drones for self defense against things that get in close
---
You can put deep core miners on it though, not sure why you would bother when the jump to barge is only a few days.
---
No, all missile skills apply to both short and long range missiles.

This week on Icelandic Masterchef CCP Convict presents his toilet jenkem spaghetti.
---
CCPls replace players.
---
Couldn't agree more. Just don't mention porpoises, that's a trigger word.
---
The reward has increased over the past 2 years overall. More and more people are skilling into cap / super pve under the super umbrellas.
---
Just look at the titan prices and isk faucets in Null.
---
I would not agree with the last sentence since Dread ratting is riskier than he gives it credit for. But everything else he says is essentially accurate.
---
Ccp plz replace my pvp with pve
---
&gt;Are you saying there will at least be fights involving 1000s of players? 
---
Nah.  Fozzie sov node "fights" where 1000s of players wait on opposite sides of gates waiting to see the outcome.
---
My discord bot (talked about at 
---
https://reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cuh5sp/introducing_matcalc_a_discord_bot_for_industry/) does exactly this with the !build command. It even shows you the number of which types of ore to mine in order to get enough minerals
---
They are designed to be self-sufficient solo miners that take very little attention to manage, and are essentially invulnerable to direct engagement.  Properly fit, they can take all the abuse of a 15-gang talos gank and keep on trucking and still be isk positive to the gankers if it goes down.  The worst that can happen is a nano-machariel shoving you off grid.
---
Isk per hour is probably close to 60mil per orca.
---
The point is( and I know I might be a rare case there): I m not in EVE for any particular goal. OFC I like getting new ships and ISK and whatnot. But, I m also the generation that spent hours over hours on Tetris with no lasting reward at all. The amount of RimWorld-Runs/Civ-runs/Stellaris-runs/CogMind-runs/Rogue-runs I started and either lost or aborted is astronomically. I m playing for a joyfull time. vOv
---
Most MMOs you just cant avoid making some sort of progress when you re playing them and, well, why should I avoid it? btw I also like just ramming some random ship in someone elses till one blows up at times. For the very same reason: Its fun in that moment, fitting the mood, or a game-bro is asking "Hey, wanna join?". vOv
---
Gorgeous art!
---
Put meat I slow cooker with some spices. Let it cook for at least 6 hours on high. It's ready when your can easily pull the meat apart with a pair of forks. Experiment with spices you like, there isn't really a wrong way to make it unless it tastes like ass. That's probably a bad thing unless that's what you were going for.
---
I would want high slot target painters and webs before I ever gave up more of my mids to dps and not utility.
---
&gt; Multiple gates is no worse than multiple wormholes - you can either have multiple people watching them, or you can just watch the ones you think enemies are likely to come through, or you can take the risk. Same as we have to in J space.
---
There is no Dotlan map of WHs that instantly reveals when and where you are active, and gives people a known path to reach you.
---
&gt;Cloaky ships still show up on dscan when they jump in.
---
&gt;If you get blobbed so hard you don't see them coming you didn't dscan and scout the next system well enough
---
These optimizations are trivial for bots and punishing for humans. Bots don't get bored watching a gate 24/7 on an alpha account, and never miss a dscan.
---
The question now is what is your longterm goal.
---
If you want to be a space mogul, with billions of isk and hundreds of contacts, you should join a merchant corp(may be hard to find)
---
If you want to build up a large supply of isk and ships, join a large null entity(goons, test, brave, etc)
---
If you want to become a marauder, pillaging as you go, join a wh pvp corp (waffles is recruiting)
---
If you want to become an industrialist, join a nullbloc again, and provide various items needed for large conflicts.
---
If you want to survive with a small group, find a small entity in any part of space.
---
If you want to lowsec fw, good luck. There are active groups, but good content will be boring or brutal until you learn.
---
If you want to make safe isk, go into highsec incursions
---
If you want to be a solo hunter, run around and shoot everything you can until you figure out what you should and shouldnt shoot.
---
There’s lots of possibilities, and most depend on finding a group..
---
Nope. Gotta reactivate every time you lose a target afaik.
---
"I'm orbiting at 4000 meters per second at a 500 meter radius orbit around the Rokh. He can't hit me with his attack unless he rolls a nat 1 on a percentile die." 
---
"The Rokh activates his Smartbomb special ability 8 times." 
---
"Fuck. Hand me a new ship fit sheet, will you?"
---
C4 dwellers are not wormholers. They are absolute heretic degenerates that delve in raging homosexuality tactics. As such they have no rights and can be abused and executed by the law of wh honor code.
---
&gt;Add to that the fact that Goon Swarm has largely moved on from Eve  online and they were the largest group actively organized in opposition  to white supremacist recruiting on there, and it isn't surprising that  it's taking off again. 
---
Holy crap. What is happening out there in the real world. Is /r/Eve actually among the saner of the subreddits? I thought *we* were the crazy ones.
---
Also. Why haven't I gotten an invite into this supremacist thing? I'm both hurt and offended.
---
Just have a few medical questions. 
---
1. Do you mine? If yes how often?
---
If answered yes it could actually be spodbrain please consult your local pvp fleet
---
We stayed in comms and watched the stream all weekend... but sadly another fuck you from ccp.
---
thats really annoying for bigger groups of enemies
---
I'd say mediate between pvp and some pve to fund anything else and bide time for skills to train, if something   
---
I can work on the side of doing lv4's for example? that would work well as im comfortably doing those already and slowly building isk free to spend, i dont intend on going for marauders for lv4's as it seems like overkill for something i can already do with such a big investment
---
Pfff... Other games having flying ships and all that jazz... I like the idea :)  
---
Question at the side: Did "your D&amp;D Minmatars" escape some slavery and fled to that islands, too?
---
Are they capsuleers? What else is Eve about it?
---
Woah! Inspires me to start a Starfinder campaign themed around the time period either directly after the Eve Gate collapsed or sometime during the rise of the four empires, or maybe even the "ancient" Jovian empire
---
I love how ccp psych brings old graphs and was unprepared for the meeting yet when asked about it...don't worry about the fact the i don't have relevant data points so I'm just showing you old graphs to fill time...
---
Pandemic Legion happened to him/them.
---
Sure, but they seem unaware of even what types of bots exist.
---
Clearly soon ^(tm)
---
Did you expect any level of pilot competence from SEADC?
---
How the fuck can I join? I don't play Eve anymore but would love to get in on this.
---
2017 is a frikkin long year, it seems. Almost 1000 days  by now...
---
I'll be sure to report to them my main mining locations. Thank you.
---
So Rahne abused it and its gone. Thanks for confirming
---
You're welcome citizen!
---
CCP Hellmar is a fucking idiot.  Myths and bad science.  Please let there be dragons in is next AMA.
---
It’s not so bad, typically you’ve got a full cycle’s time to select your next target. I run with weapons grouped for PvE. Usually I can Beal a target in a couple cycles.
---
So the reward hasn't increased just more people are using. Thst is significantly different than ccp has been buffing the reward.
---
yes you kinda do. even the most organized entity in the game, goonswarm federation, couldnt host the anger games cause of it.
---
Just wait a few more years...
---
Which is basically my point. There wouldn't be some new awesome content if goons unblued everyone.
---
The idea is that the islands were all their own governments and tribes that were fighting each other until the Amarr enslaved the whole lot of them. After a rebellion (eve lore, I know), they banded together to form the Minmatar Alliance to act as mutual protection and prevent nightmares of the past.
---
&gt; Sure, but they seem unaware of even what types of bots exist.
---
Easily possible even to a veteran. Bot detection doesn't inherently involve gameplay.
---
A quick check for that guy also shows he's only been in the CCP corp since may, which means he might be new.
---
Nah, it's still a high fantasy world, just with eve elements stolen
---
Thanks, but it's for a group of IRL friends. You should make your own and DM it!
---
Biomass fucking retard
---
Currently in a 2 year long campaign already. I also don't know nearly enough lore to run a game based on Eve but think it would be pretty interesting.
---
This wasn't an easy decision. Props to Mercie1 and all directors for taking the time to examine what we need as a corp, and moving us in that direction. See you soon in alliance chat Hordelings!
---
I mean your not wrong that optimal isn't all that great, but making the gap smaller between optimal and non-optimal playstyles should then be on your goal because the smaller the gap the more likely people are choice a non-optimal playstyle. 
---
Right now all the HQ is doing is adding a cost to people for not playing the optimal style while doing almost nothing to nerf the people that are doing the dec and camp optimal approach to wars.
---
But they did in the past. Thats why they spread microwave-ovens that actually are brainreading-microwave-routers over civillian households. \*nods frantically\*
---
Eh, the nice thing is that the lore doesn't need to match up. I'm stealing the four nations, their basic premise and demeanor, but I have my own story arc planned
---
Isn't the age of chaos the antithesis of a roadmap?
---
C4 degenerates
---
BOB and mercy? You must know a different BOB than me ;)
---
True enough, reading "four nations" I immediately thought there might be some similarities to "Avatar: last air bender"
---
I love that adaption, as an EVE-player as well as a D&amp;Der... :)
---
Man, and here I was thinking Hilmar has terrible ideaa...
---
 Use autotarget missiles.
---
&gt;Both the participants and the spectators will have a sizable amount of content generators, FCs, active PvP pilots and enthusiasts of every stripe and even just one missing AT has dropped several of these people from the face of Eve entirely. This has effects far beyond their immediate surroundings, compounding themselves every time more people find less content and thus less reason to ever log in again.
---
OK
---
&gt;Killed by trigs in hisec in a system that is not being invaded. HOW?
---
By not reading patch notes or reddit
---
THATS RACIST AND DEHUMINING YOU FUCKING NAZIREEEEEEE
---
Guess you could say you have been REE-strained?
---
xdddddddddd
---
The nice thing about pvp is it can be very cheap, or even profitable if you punch above your weight, ships like the retribution are cheap, and only require midlevel skill to fly decently and can punch far and up. 
---
Isk making is versatile. I’ve tried just about everything, from 10/10 ded escalation purchasing to carrier ratting to multi-box rorq ice mining, trading and reprocessing, officer hunting, buyback services, capital production, pi, and more
---
It all works and, and you arent married to it.
---
Buy all the male ones and trash them
---
moved to a new area over the last week and I think I like it there. Space is nice, folks around are talkative. I had thrilling, funny as well as surprisingly productive moments( datt 150mill faction-web casually dropping from a rat killed while mining o,O ). Got some rats toasted, some sites scanned, some rocks mined. Had a nice talk with a local I ganged up with for mining and no one got ganked. And I aaaaalmost managed soloing a Sabre, but the guy got away, cause teh rusty me forgot that this Jag now has drones, too. :D  
---
Looking forward to the next day of gaming :)

Which normie alliance?

NC bbq is vile and disgusting. Get that vinegar away from my beef and pork.

Just bait them and counter when you want to rat.

make it so

What can possibly go wrong by giving the individuals with trillions of isk the ability to kill people by making payments
---
It’s like world war bee, but with mercenaries that don’t get tilted, don’t sleep, and don’t give a damn about losses
---
Once we set up in a C3 with a intermittent C2 and a null sec static.
---
Man we made some Russians angry.
---
We eventually got starved out because we couldn't get a consistent refueling window for the tower, so we moved out. Was fun while it lasted though.

Read all of the CSM minutes. Or just the last three pages, if you want to skip to the part that'll make the post make sense.

Fight for your right to be autistic space brother. It was a lower case ree to with only 2 ee's.  That's like the most basic quiet starter ree one can do.
---
Aren't these complaints which nullsec always wishes though? Funds to fund wars and players that login more?
---
I might not have been clear. I am referring to the skill Guided Missile Precision. The skill description doesn't state what types of missiles it applies too, so I was assuming all. Google shows posts from a few years ago, stating that they did not apply to HAMs. Wasn't sure if this changed or whatnot since
---
You can target multiple enemies and when one dies just click on the next one once and hit F1 (or whatever you have mapped to the weapon). Quick and easy.
---
I got kicked by my dm for botting

Catching Asteros in a Sabre is easy if you know where they’re warping to and what they’re warping from. For example, if they’re going to be coming in through gate A and going to gate B, warp to gate A, and from there, warp to gate B at range. Watch the other side of gate A with your scout. As soon as the Astero jumps in through gate A, pop your bubble and align to gate A until you reach the inside edge of the bubble (single pulse of MWD and Control+Space work well here). Jettison something from your cargo for help decloaking. As soon as target decloaks on your overview pop another bubble, approach and spam target lock. Pulse MWD and overheat tackle as needed.
---
This is a joke right?
---
:(
---
I've thought about doing something similar with my Starfinder game.
---
I scanned down a wormhole signal that began with HIV... I went inside the hole anyways.
---
You're not wrong
---
safest space in eve is still the best quote.
---
Yeah I'm gonna need some more of this please
---
I want to join.  Pls tell me you live near Cincy.
---
Yeah its partially my fault, just got the ship for pi so didnt fit any tank, also, out of curiosity, how did you manage to find my kill report?
---
OP never said CCP buffed it, OP said the reward of null was increasing and the risk decreasing.
---
That is well known as more and more people used the umbrella mechanic.
---
designing npc's to play the game for you, because the game is such a shit show people don't want to do it themselves is a sign the game is already dead and should just be put out of its misery.
---
You mind pointing out some examples here? I honestly don't follow.
---
The Rupture/Muninn/Broadsword models *already* look like boats.
---
No you idiot that's the cover story i can't believe you people fall for that shit.
---
I always thought it was just a little resentment.  You can't cyno in wormholes as a get-out-of-jail-free tactic when shit doesn't go your way. Wormholers can just close the connection and walk away when they feel like it. Ratting is safer and more lucrative. But wormholes require additional knowledge and experience of the game's mechanics that throws off a lot of players who don't know wormholes that well, and it's much easier to say "fuck wormholes/wormholers" than it is to say "I don't understand how this works."
---
I see that one as well... but once again space radiation face so idk
---
You were the only NPC kill in Malma today.
---
Was a very good fight. Was scanning relics on my low sp alt. This dude warped in and went for me.
---
Nope, sorry
---
Pics of ships or eve stuff in a high fantasy setting?
---
I'd play that shit more than I play Eve these days...
---
I would love to try whatever that dude took before writing that. Must be some real good stuff.  
---
Goons somehow being the floodgate keepers for racism and white supremacy, ehmm ayyy k seems legit
---
... Bruh
---
I don’t... my memory consists of: shit I need this skill to use this thingy, shit I need these 10 skills to train this other skill.
---
Or my favorite, I need this skill to fly this ship..... yaaay I have skill!  Shit... I’m still utterly useless in this ship until I train these 6 other skills... shit one of those skills requires 7 other skills before I can train that skill.
---
Oh and each skill book costs 100k to 5mil... oh and I’m only able to make a few mil a day because I suck.
---
I reached a point where I just wanted to load up my skill queue for 6 months and just play other games and get into Eve later when I have skills.

Reminds me of when battlecruisers were in a good place, because they were measuring PVP damage to including suicide ganking....
---
At least he'll eat ass in a somewhat hygienic manner!
---
They are sold on the markets by players, and yes they do take a bit jump in price when you buy out the entire stock in jita 4-4.   
---
One of my corpmates did just that with the male variant and shoved them in an itty V with no fit and started bumping a wartarget and [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/70944990/) was the result.
---
That stuff also made r/EVE back then like a year ago  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8urlbw/man\_someones\_bachelorette\_party\_got\_some\_bad\_news/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8urlbw/man_someones_bachelorette_party_got_some_bad_news/)

Wait.. I insurance is good on a carrier ?

If you didn’t know that this would happen during AT XVI you weren’t paying attention.

No, that's just the Down's.

Gross.

Fine allow safety to local fort to fire sale now it’s the same as old stations.
---
Wait till you see where you end up to see what type of rats are there. Basically, it works like this. You will have a travel fit, cloaky/nulli and then when you get to the system the site is in, you refit to your combat fit.
---
i know how to do it i have been doing it for years, they seem much faster lately and sabers seem slower. when the last astero pulled 4k before i was up to speed even aiming at them with 2 decloaks as backup he was out of bubble range on the first cycle . seems a little broken. "It feels like something changed" is what i should have said because asteros are harder to catch on gate than ususal.

Click the hamburger icon on the drones window and set to passive.

More like a nat 20 on it's d20, but that's the spirit!
---
i appreciate the single-world sandbox.  if my friends play eve, they play in the same world i do, and that's really cool.
---
specifically i appreciate that there's no 'daily quests' or stuff i feel obligated to log in and do on a regular basis - when i have time i can spend it here, when i don't have time i don't feel like i'm missing out in a big way.
---
just came back after a pretty long break and brought some frens into hisec, refugees from a more stressful game and period of life in general.  we are having fun just learning and relearning together, even if we're not turning a huge profit we're having a good time just chilling and trying out new stuff.  i'm really glad eve is still here because there's nothing else like it and i'd miss it if it wasn't around.

They accuse me for being a outsider and didnt trust me, I just want to mine i said, they said okay..

Next day one of their exhumer got ganked, talked about frickin coincidence....

\+1 for the cap battery tengu. In Fountain I would use a Heavy missile tengu. Only bling you really need is the shield booster and amp in my opinion. I always used T2 adaptives.

Even for the average r/eve/ poster that's absolutely insane.

Exactly what's stopping them, Considering i've been running a tournament and getting it solid.

No, it's not.

No, I'm thinking you have more time to align because they take longer to warp.

F, indeed.

Lore: It crashed in an ocean planet and locals are now using it as a boat.

This is the kinda thing that scares me playing Eve sometimes.

I fully expect to cross someone someday and my phone to ring.

My discord and anything else I use for Eve are on burner email accounts.

wormholes are the vegans of eve online. change my mind

While we're at it, I know this is semi personal info but I'd love to see info on the isk registered there, esp. compared to how many characters the person had.

The other cool thing would be highest SP delta on a single char. Who's the worst injector junkie?

GIGAREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
apparently having a bit more tank to stay alive for minute and half in 60 mil ship against 500 mil ship and being on comms to call your buddies is too much work.

If I'm on comms that means I can't watch netflix so ccp bad
---
Everything changed when the Amarr Empire attacked.
---
It's a fun fight though.
---
Idk...feudalism has worked pretty well in Stallaris...
---
1. Recons immune to dscan
---
2. Covert Cynos
---
3. Recons and Covert Cynos with a deep safe
---
4.All sides try to manipulate the narrative. Best answer is usually in the middle of the extremes.
---
Stellaris's mechanics try to make every government form viable and most of them aren't really that distinct from each other. You can run a literal bandit kingdom, but all your planets pay their taxes on time and in full, and your admirals never decide *they* should be in charge and go to town on your current warlord. Somehow I don't think an actual bandit kingdom would be that functional. 
---
Also, the Royal Houses have pretty divided and often self-centered politics. I don't think forcing them to build bigger, private fleets, loyal first to their own house and not the wider Empire, is going to go well. We're less into Stellaris and more into Game of Thrones territory here.
---
ah, because they had to be corp jobs. i thought you were talking about the "look at the sotiyo and see the titan being built" feature they gave up on.
---
Not to mention the Probe and Cheetah!
---
CCP actually fucked up the august numbers.
---
You can calculate sleeper loot faucet by multiplying the total commodities by the percentage of commodities that sleeper loot makes up. In this case it's 23.8 trillion * (100-25.7-14.0)/100 = 16 trillion. The graph on the right shows ratting bounty from all of null for August, which was 17.3 trillion.
---
Oh yeah, this is not going to end well for the Amarr, will probably have a civil war or coup soon
---
Bob giveth and bob taketh. He hath no mercy and is just, blessed be his name.

Boss tells you to line up, so you put your toe on the line.
---
A few weeks ago someone broke the NDA and sent a pic of Jita Trading Hub's new model from EVE Ech
---
And dude was it MASSIVE
---
It's like, probably as wide as two keepstars placed side by side
---
The problem is the players. They decided to blue everyone and took away their own content. Now we have no risk nullsec making infinite wealth to buy neato ship skins. 
---
That's really what Eve has become.
---
Big pirate boob-ty?
---
Dude sign me in
---
And that's why I always get paranoid when I've more than 1 bil in my astero.

ikr, krab mindset is what is killing this game, not the krabs themselves.

He went for you with that fit and carrying 2 bil in cargo? lol!

---
Barely any change, the bulk of manufacturing in Delve is supers and titans.
---
I feel like you're just making numbers up, as the "breakdown" doesn't even add up to 10 tril for commodities total...
---
Does someone need to take a good hard look?
---
shut up nanofag
---
By default, drones won't auto agress things that aren't red boxing you.
---
CCP is into killing community made events not bolstering them, look at EVE Vegas that was originally community run, now its CCP run and they're killing it next year. Fuck you Hilmar.
---
Just join the voice chat.
---
It won't make you either of those things.
---
CCP messed up the commodities breakdown bar chart in August. [This is the one from July for example.](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/5QcVDuFLTRViKa9WWJoX7k/d1f0e653f864a8b7de6a2c7a6da3917c/9a1_faucets_breakdown.png)
---
Can't wait! Have not seen that, and I will hold off on ruining the surprise for myself.
---
As far as proteolytic marinades go, you have to weigh them by their phosphoric acid content.
---
Had over 700 days at one point when finishing off Titan 5 and all the the T5 capital related skills. Still haven't finished that train because I unsubbed that account when CCP decided that the Nullsec would be better served having unlimited resources and rats in every region and completely  negating the need to go to war. So it's probably still sitting at 500+ days because fuck it why train for the big war machines if there is no reason to fight. 
---
I did up a perfect Rorq with injectors in under 4 hours. (Not including hours worked to buy the Plex that paid for the injectors but less than 20) 
---
Now I can just afk mine and afk fat  rat ticks....while I endgame in HS incursions in my Pirate Faction fit Mach. The way EVE was meant to be played. Or something.
---
Hey at least they gave you a warning, if I was FC I would have just kicked you immediately and had you awoxed on sight
---
Okay so what's your point?
---
People stopped ratting so much in Null. And?
---
I think the first thing we need to do is fix sov and create a push and pull system for space in a region.  Sov needs the be linked by constellations... alliances fights for constellations. Thereby making neighbors fight to expand their space. 
---
An alliance can only hold space in one region. The end game goal for alliances is to hold all systems in one region to then acquire a mega structure. 
---
Sounds a hell of a lot more fun than now
---
Lol
---
I hope it's an automatic biomasser, you can just approach and dock into it, and it biomasses your characters.
---
Wow... 36 Toons yes.... 
---
They do have to be omega as alpha accounts are excluded from PI. 
---
Yes, there is ISK to be made, but (1) needs training time of 40 days per toon.  And (2) a fair amount of work in restarting extractor heads and hauling.  (With PI even p2 materials are bulky enough to need moving with industrials).
---
One of the better badposts I've seen on /r/eve.
---
honestly i could really do without 12 year olds crying on reddit that somebody spent an hour making content for somebody besides themselves.
---
Eh, he was playing Deathwatch, where 1 is The Uber Roll.
---
You absolute madman! That idea is so horrible, I think I like it!
---
shut-up russian bot/troll, anything you say that goes against my personal belief is hate speech
---
Wormholers were going to be a ''collateral'' in CCPs own words during HIC changes lol what are you talking about
---
Eve-cs
---
all the major subreddits even somewhat related to politics like r/news are completely bonkers
---
I really never believed that goons could ruin the game like everyone says until they basically boycotted chaos era en masse and CCP caved.  I basically have no hope for the game anymore because CCP has shown its hand; they will cave to the largest group in the game every time.
---
Doesn't even need to be true, just that this game thrives on manufactured conflict.
---
Right. Then, after about 3 weeks of wormholers screeching, CCP created your little loophole module.
---
If they can keep you for 6 months, they have you for life.
---
It seems CCP ignores mostly everything. CSM is effectively a filter.
---
Just focus on the major things like injectors.
---
Reality is they both need to be fucked with.
---
It was fun there - thanks for running fleets. Still playing?
---
It's necessary to do it. It's broken right now. Just too strong.
---
It's interesting they are against automation that affects core gameplay, but have no problems with automated free intel based on killmails that affects core gameplay. Dumb.
---
Deadspaces &amp; Drifters
---
Nooooo! It'll rust!
---
(spoiler i fuckin eat dick in the end reeeeeeeeeee VNI reeee)
---
Is that confirmed?
---
I noticed the model was different and speculated.
---
It just seems so wildly different than the current look that I figured it was some other reason.
---
Not 1 skill. 50 skills.
---
And Hel looks like a boat house... In case of extreme danger to the tribe whole willage becomes a massive fleet and burns everything.
---
Imagine getting triggered over not being allowed to scream in a fleet
---
So WHers were given one small thing, and....?
---
minmatar boats would be a wooden palette with 2 barrels strapped to the bottom
---
Switched to vaping, no longer coughing up blood wormholer, btw.
---
I never even looked at it when I docked there :(
---
I mean, it IS annoying when you precede every single sentence with REEEE, it's like people are spazzing but ironically or something idgi
---
Pretty sure passive will only attack if ordered to, agressive will defend you if attacked. Even in aggressive, they won't seek out targets.
---
cause your first name in game is the same as on reddit
---
I had enough time when i found out to train one to 5. I trained them both to 4 because for some reason that made sense to me. If i could go back and punch myself...
---
Mmmmmm. Ham.
---
at what point does CCP's repeated lies start to become false advertising?
---
With a low enough sec status it could
---
They weren't given anything; CCP attempted to make a change to HICs, and rather than adapting, wormhole dwellers complained until CCP created a special wormhole module to maintain the status quo. A module that literally only exists so that wormholers wouldn't have to face the *possibility* of having to scan themselves out of a collapsed wormhole in a megathron.
---
Anyway, it’s not even fun when watching ppl abusing cancerous ships and tactics fighting each other.
---
I mean it may be accepted, but it's wrong.
---
/r/mildlyinteresting
---
Dscan and accept risk.
---
Boi tf you smoking
---
"Wait why does this sound fam-"
---
"Lannie you bitch"
---
Being a company mouthpiece and lying through his teeth to tell people what they want to hear even if it isn't true isn't really a good job.  I mean, yeah, its a good JOB (as in, his job, which is to basically lie), but does not make him good for the community, likeable, or worth listening to.  At all.
---
o7
---
ok so which one is noraus if he was there
---
You know it's funny when you think about it because I assume you're talking about getting them from damsel in distress, and that mission your kidnapping them so those exotic dancers you picked up are prisoners of yours
---
I want your notes...
---
Nice office
---
Lmao yeah
---
more like high enough
---
everyone wants classic eve, well there you go, you have it.
---
We will see MER after blackout, and in 3 month PA monthly report how much CCP lost.
---
Russians didn't actually pay us to attack Atlas.  They paid us to not shoot them after we killed a Nyx of theirs or something :joy:  
---
For the final timer for their staging, Bobby told all his guys to call in sick because they would fight no matter but then he blueballed and went for chicken wings
---
I'm not 100% but I think they will
---
Minutes are not a verbatim copy of what was said.
---
Hearty chuckle
---
Can? Yes.  Should? No.
---
Make sure that you don't end up being a NullBear even if you aren't much of a PVP person. Sure, you don't need to seek out PVP, but the people who complain about PVP happening to them when they're out in the part of space with no restrictions on PVP are annoying.
---
I fucking love my industrialists. I'm less of a fan of their prices, though.
---
Unlimited if fiftyously.
---
Eh, it's in salt water, there will be plenty of rust.
---
*breaks out my spreadsheets*
---
Warning: the sky is falling, at every server restart EVE's population is zero.
---
No, CCP won't bring your easy cynos back, so that you can drop titans everywhere.
---
We all understand you are a genius, that discovered Eve-Offline, bu sorry, you are nit that convincing.
---
EVE themed D&amp;D ?? That sounds quite interesting and the image looks too good too, very nice job.
---
Man I don’t play that often myself anymore, but damn I feel like you’re right.
---
&gt; Add to that the fact that Goon Swarm has largely moved on from Eve online and they were the largest group actively organized in opposition to white supremacist recruiting on there, and it isn't surprising that it's taking off again.
---
I have no idea what this is supposed to mean.
---
From the moment they took away the ability to bet on AT matches it went downhill.
---
How many years do you think we have left? I'm guessing 10 more years before it dies.
---
I'm not sure if you're being serious, but if you are, thanks.
---
Pretty sure that's Goons.
---
Player count always drops during this moon phase
---
You should thank these people for not letting you "be yourself"
---
Don't tREEad on me
---
Yes, i was 500 of them, totaly not botting
---
Yeah, he really needs those cyno and rorq changes back for all his retribution kills.
---
The biggest online that i remember was over 60k
---
And logi on kill Mail
---
it will not die
---
but where is fun where you'll be flying thorough empty systems? even now it's already visible how many people is not playing anymore
---
Corps leaving NC for PH, lmao. Fucking ouch
---
I keep seeing people post this but I *still* haven't seen a single goon complaint. I mean, I guess keep trying to push your narrative but usually there has to be at least some truth to it in order for people to really buy it.
---
😄 no bots here
---
We had a few 60ks
---
Cringe
---
They tend to have superiority complexes and look down on non-WHers, maybe that's why. I dunno, I haven't seen any of these negative comments myself.
---
The irony of PH poaching from NCPL is amazing
---
Nah I'm not a bot or a crab leleleelell
---
Cringe is saying reee over and over
---
You've discovered why charity in general is not necessarily benevolent. When you give someone something they haven't earned, you make it harder for them to learn to provide for themselves. It's the same reason you aren't supposed to feed animals in national parks, but for some reason people get asshurt when you apply the same logic to people.
---
I actually did the same recently, but different. I'm using the Risus ruleset which just allows all kind of PNP adventures to be run (and is free). My players don't play eve so I took the universe as a nice scifi setting where I know a lot about backgrounds and so on. And they don't. They played normal humans on a capsuleer astero on the way from Highsec to venal to look for information about the coming triglavian Invasion. But their capsuleer got paid off by guristas and left the ship in g9d so they had to take control and either destroy the gila or run away. Was great fun and meant to be a one shot. But they want to play again so I really need to get some new story ideas. Maybe WHs because they are scary.
---
Its a lot better than a faction battleship
---
I don´t call that insane. Or at least i don´t hope i am insane.
---
I own 17 accounts and (not logging in now to count all of them) i guess about 40 characters across them. Not all of them subbed at the same time but accumulated over the 5 years i play(ed?) eve. Why? Well, it just happened.
---
Started out the hs miner route which i used 4 accounts but when moving to null my need for additional characters rose pretty quickly. i maintained a jf route to the krab lands while the rest of the alliance (and naturally the jf services too) were on deployment. thus i needed my own cyno chain.
---
after the alliance got a foothold within the campaign i rushed forward and while all the big guys started building up the industry i made several dozen jumps within a few days between jita and fade to help building up a stockpile of the lower end ships which of course were not supplied at all. after a few days of course my industry also kicked in; several more toons.
---
A few more accounts were used as 1-2 months throwaway scouts, tackle, dictors and then subsequently used the referral system to make a new one.
---
Personally i am actually the type of person who isn´t exactly fit for eve, i am a t3: a jack of all trades but not perfect in anything. While i played eve i dabbed into almost every aspect of the game and took part in it, thus needing a lot of characters to make each task independent from the other task so i could do whatever i want whenever i want.
---
It used to be that rockets/HAM/torps were considered 'unguided' and the skill guided missile precision didn't apply to them so the old info you saw would have been accurate at the time it was written. CCP patched it a while ago to apply to all missiles though.
---
Yes
---
It takes brave so long to form up when you bring them something. It’s sad.
---
Well that was a challenge for me as I tried to find for max isk/hr activity with the optimal fits and plan for the skills and I enjoyed that more than anything in my gaming history.
---
Why am I not surprised. NC is dead.
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
And that's the average at 15 Eve time
---
Why are you people like this, Why are you trying to spin the narrative, friend? HIC change was made SPECIFICALLY to address nullsec gatecamps and HICs in general being able to move at frigate speeds while having bubble up at all times. HICs rolling wormholes was never a problem, it was an emergent mechanic found by players which CCP has stated on maaany occasions that they absolutely love. Perfect intel on the other hand is something that has killed several different playstyles and even CCP believes its a problem
---
Wonder if its like cloaks and they dont work if you fit two
---
By 22 those numbers went up by another 5-7k
---
We need separate currency for each faction! And space exchange, with trading capabilities. Debt trading mechanisms will open the way to global crisises and new wars! Cool. We need you as CSM.
---
They aint brave or new...
---
That's actually really cool.
---
If only they could dispatch some coalition FC’s to keep the peace
---
Clearly the return of local to null is killing the game.
---
Plex is the reserve currency. And ccp wants this to be a natural economy with little to no outside interaction.
---
Used to be a wormholer like you until i took this spod to the knee
---
Mabey don't rile up your coalition to complain about Eve-Bet (the best part of AT) and we would still be interested
---
I have mined just about anything except gas and the new moon mining thing, but I’m all for it.
---
Bring on the gas harvester. It should have an appropriately offensive name too.

If i remember right pvp in wow was lvl limited 1-19/20 so you lvl to 20 on an alt getting it all the best possible gear by soloing the dungeons on your main.            
---
              
---
You then have the gold magnate of pvp toons and farm the novice plex patting your self on the back for being leet. Difference being your gold magnate respawns.
---
Holy shit. White is probably one of the best CEOs in the game, I hope it works out for them
---
My understanding of alpha and omega clones is that you must continuously subscribe and pay to continue to use omega skills that have already been trained while paying. Is that correct? So if I came back, without paying, to a 3 year paid subscription character after a one year break, I'd only have the alpha clone skills available to me?
---
Very cool. The minmatar probe looks like a little sail boat.
---
Please. No more isk printing massive crab ships. 
---
Please.
---
Thank you.
---
Still my favourite time in Eve. Wind Spirit was the only dude to continually undock to fight our cloak y camp.
---
Yes. You would only gain the benefit of alpha skills. Your omega skills will still exist but they will give you no benefit until you re-subscribe.
---
Gas harvesting is lucrative enough as-is, and T3s are cheap enough as-is.
---
...because that would be absolute fucking cancer?
---
If your plan is to run DED and scan drone sites then you want a covops refit to move. I tried HAM’s but found the webs and travel time in most sites make HM a better choice.

Never lost the loki’s but they fit something like this with a missile range mod in the extra mid with precision script for frigs. Seed drones and missiles around your circuit.

Regardless what this stupid community thinks and trying to act cool and fun, these numbers are concerning.
---
Watch as CCP have to explain to PA how they managed to fuck up so badly and why the revenue is so low
---
Waitresses hate this because they continually have to ask is Pepsi ok? Of course it is, all your fountain shit is going to be mixed just poorly enough for it not to matter.
---
I'm kind of glad I burned out before things went south. I'd hate it to be some kind of Firefly thing where I feel incomplete after EVE shuts down. Still sad tho, such a great run.
---
Does it include training skills in realtime?

Good luck with your poolside open bar for employees and maybe that one guy in FW that lives in CA and made the drive.

It's Halloween season, people are outside apple bobbing not inside playing games duh.

No, we need more belt.

I hope you have a better battle plan than shit posting on reddit, bruv.
---
We already had that, called driver invasion, no one liked it except of high sec Snd low sec scrubs who didn’t had to defend their stuff 24/7 against some op as fuck npcs
---
Yah daily rewards
---
not a plan, a vision
---
Goons aren't ruining the game, they're just the best at exploiting the dumb mechanics that would exist anyway.
---
The data's pretty biased towards people with lots of alts because they're the ones who would be most interested in this tool.
---
&gt;  To constantly live on the edge whilst doing what should be calming isnt fun. That is a stressor and nobody would manage that long term, thats a fact.
---
Who said games should be calming or relaxing? Many people enjoy the struggle in games. Some play them exclusively for such reasons. Also some people manage long term stressors just fine. It´s about the good old competitive vs casual mindset and BO was a way to test who and how many of the playerbase fall where on the spectrum. 
---
&gt; Eh na. Thats just a bunch of nice words that dont mean anything.
---
It´s a lot of words to say if people don´t do shit in a a player driven sandbox it´s dead and not worth playing in. 
---
&gt; So at some point they need to actually take care of the product or they will have lost hundreds of millions of dollars
---
Not really. They bought the whole company which includes tech, assets, the IP, manpower, real estate...
---
To armortize the purchase through Eve alone would take them 50 years by last years profit margins. And that´s with 2018 player numbers. 
---
&gt; We as players should have done what?
---
Take responsibility. 
---
&gt; Muh blackout bad. 
---
Yes. Never claimed it wasn´t. I offered solutions on how not to be a whiny victim under these circumstances.
---
&gt; Dont blame the stove
---
If it´s a shitty stove, why wouldn´t? 
---
&gt; And blocs have a shitton of dedicated players as well. 
---
Less on average.
---
&gt; If you stop for a second and actually consider people in the blocs to be human beings instead of cows then you will perhaps understand some things better.
---
Oh, i understand that perfectly fine. That´s why all sandboxes that rely on player generated content run on bargained time. The overwhelming majority of humans will be lazy if they are given the choice to be. Nullsec blocs do just that for a large amount of players.
---
As someone who played in 2006, and doesn't like people, I am good with this.
---
He will see a large bias to more accounts because the service was aimed at helping people manage the skill ques of many accounts.

What's up with "crabs" and "blue donuts"?
---
But if I don't keto, how else will I get gout so quickly?
---
Cant someone else do it?
---
Seriously though goons are only a threat to spod. you dont wanna be a dank rock in delve.
---
Ain't that some shit
---
the one you see panda i guess
---
Is it too late to train for rorqual? I mean the time it took to train and the expenses. How long is the ROI? Will it be nerfed before I can pilot it?
---
Crabs are people doing some kind of PVE to get money. 
---
The blue donut is when everyone is allied or non hostile towards each other; donut shaped because Nullsec is a ring around the rest of New Eden.
---
Does this vision involve just waiting around for someone else to do the heavy lifting and difficult big brain stuff

Does anyone know the in game channels for Triglavian fleets, fits and groups?

Let me FTFY: Groups who represent themselves... not a lot of the game players!

 the ingredients are present in the game, only the right man in the right place is needed

it's the meta

The Dachau?
---
There's everyone's internal conflict to sub or not to sub.
---
TBH its right up there with your INN spin.
---
Agreed
---
So who is the one in red but not allowed at the table?
---
Holy Shit!
---
Firstly have you had Botox? If so I think you need to stop and instead buy plex with that money.  
---
Secondly if you have not had Botox then you maybe allergic to the last thing you ate. You should get that checked out right away.
---
I was thinking the name Tresker, which is Norwegian for harvester. In the narrative, maybe have the chief designer's last name be Tresker, and therefore the ship bears his name in honor.
---
All those in agreement for unconditional surrender raise their hands ☝
---
Their numbers would always run low with the AT.
---
It's good to know you guys still kicking around, even you know - while eve is dying and stuff.

So true it hurts.

Maybe they realised that CCP actually at least try to enforce anti-botting on TQ.
---
Make a strip mining gas harvester. The kicker: give it a 50m range, and make it mine proportionally to how fast the ship is travelling. Make people manually pilot their ships for it to be effective.

I like it. It’s direct and uncompromising. CCP will never allow it.
---
Yep, i had the chance to witness them all
---
When the game went F2P or Alphas.
---
This obviously masked the decline and it was hoped to introduce more players to Eve.
---
It seemed to have worked, but as per many have said on here, it has been CCP making poor choices that have ultimately caused the players to stop trusting them.

Nothing about LS, nothing about FW, mostly giving visions to CCP after the blackout. I'm going to stay unsubbed for sure.

Yep.  Just couldn't find it...
---
Watch out for Am’ ARRR!
---
oh man, I really hope not. It looked kinda... Unpleasant. At the very least- it looked very out of place.
---
A couple bots were kicked from alliance. Esi stuff
---
There is not because CCP wants to have their cake and eat it too
---
No it wouldnt. Communist
---
It's not really for us to save, and no one is going to unite the universe. Besides, then what? Wars are a temporary state of play anyway. Will a temporary state save the game? No. Goons are just doing Goon things in Goonland, they aren't ruining anything. Don't be a child.
---
I most certainly was!!!!!
---
This were the days of real fun too man miss it. So many things have been nerfed and ruined since then it's amazing
---
Eve has music?
---
I was pleasantly surprised as well.
---
Buy omega if you like the gameplay. And dont let "you can buy omega with isk if you farm enough" fool you. Its doable but not for a newb.
---
And then it's Christmas season, and then its spring season, then it's summertime, and then its Halloween apple bobbing season again
---
I heard some guys named marmite collective fight a couple ppl lol
---
Do you really want CCP stomping into the economy to "fix" it?
---
ok
---
Well you heard it first here boys. CCP won't bring cynos back. Let's see what time decides.
---
70% of the attendees probably did not even have to be there, yet directorate rep who organized this consider it crucial for everyone on the team to *align their goals* and *sync on the topic*
---
Immediately, unless you want to wait out getting what core skills you can get trained as an Alpha at 1/2 speed for free then upgrade the account.
---
Old eve would be interesting, but POS, and lack of QOL is pretty gross
---
Why are super caps a problem requiring deletion?  It's not fair some people grind the game long enough to acquire multiples while you wish you had one but won't put the effort in to get it????
---
Supers are perfectly viable (super carriers and titans) it's just that titans need an explicit new role that doesn't involve having a boson. They need a REASON to be used frequently
---
Earn space bucks, buy Plex.
---
But honestly, paying the sub and focusing on using the ISK you earn for in game stuff is probably the way to go.
---
Briefly. I took a long break a long time ago. When I started high player count was 20-30k.
---
You run a 2v2 tournament.
---
Thanks!
---
I used to be in a corp called Mass Collapse that I must have spent 1.5 years with, probably the best time in eve for me. It really sucks to see that at least 90% of the core members dont play anymore. I wish I could recapture the time I had in that corp but its hard to even motivate myself to play anymore.
---
Who the hell are the going?
---
Sissy feminist liberal lefties
---
If I'm reading you correctly, it would mine faster if the ship were moving? I like that idea. I had also thought that as one of the ship bonuses, it reduced the damage amount from cloud explosions by 5% per exhumer level.
---
I always hoped if eve died, ccp could release the code and someone else could host it. But then I remember what crazy hardware ccp needed to run tranquility.
---
😂👌
---
You can always check a site online that sells isk it's very cheap way to get a ton of isk and very fast

All it takes is 99 more shitposts, showing Eve-Offline graphs.

Well thats not tinfoil though. The group that chanted the hardest for blackout was/is WHers. And the blackout well, you can see the results yourself.
---
Yep. My skill queue flips on its head every single day. I think I might have to get an injector or I'll never train the skills I need lol
---
EvE does have sound....  I did notice the abyssal music today... But i dont think CCP have it on there soundcloud
---
So you do agree counters are lacking? Then why are you arguing?
---
Ye, cause its way way to safe. When your shit actually starts dying in a way that will make Exok say, "okey now its fine". Then we can have this discussion again. Until then I only see a bunch of people who have the safest/best isk in the game attacking the place with the most destruction and pretty shitty rewards.
---
You want balance, then balance it all the way, not just turn off a switch and expect people to be idiots and keep on doing what they used to do.
---
What???
---
Wait are Triage such a massave problem? I have not seen a single fax in a subcap fight since i came back to the game 5 weeks ago. and has everyone forgot that dreads are a thing?
---
It is doable for a new player.... If you risk running a retarded VNI bot for about 3-4 days. Not recommended. Other options include exploring and incursions.
---
You know what? 
---
We had a good run.
---
Rip gas prices?
---
The ~nullbloc CSM~ told CCP that all the design decisions they were making in this direction were bad. Go read the minutes about it - They just didn't listen to us on that front.
---
The CSM was basically the only reason we got Citadels 2.0, as CCP wanted to just push forwards and make structures for the next 2+ years without addressing the fundamental flaws in the underlying mechanics, as they refused to believe they were an issue.
---
I'm saying that removing local is a great thing to do and CCP should have then made further changes to balance null, rather than putting it back so we're back in the same low risk high reward place as before - which they can only balance by nerfing rewards, which isn't fun, since there's no way they can actually add risk if they keep local.
---
Pretty funny that you argue in favour of local but claim that wormholes are "way too safe". A well prepared wormhole (which takes effort) may be safer than null without local, but nothing is safer than sov null with local.
---
And 2006 to 2013 were the best Days in eve... Just need to wait for CCP to change something so its like that again.
---
I am a wormholer. Can confirm that I poop on my self. Scat is fun.
---
“You think you do, but you don’t...”
---
never heard of it
---
I think this is awesome. I am a big fan of real life meetups. I think they bring a sense of community and empathy that normally one does not get in the digital space. o7 Pandas.
---
Ah the fucking serpentis. Be sure to keep rapid heavy launchers for the DPS and sensor boosters since the damps suck ass.
---
Probably, I had just started playing a few months before that date.
---
Not necessarily. Give the ship a proper cycle time penalty to compensate for mining amount and it could balance out. My thought was to design a ship that wasn't as flimsy as the Venture/Prospect for WH gas mining. Something that could stand up to the gas explosions and rats and have a decent survival chance.
---
It's pretty sad. To me, the AT was the one thing that I could work towards. The thing that kept me playing. 
---
When I started playing and learned about the AT, I made it my goal to become good enough to join a team. Two years later I participated for the first time. My main goal when playing the game still was to improve and be better in the next tournament.
---
It was one of the few PVP opportunities that actually mattered.
---
That's what I used to do when I was in SEADC. Give a newbro 300mil to buy a ship and a deadline to start doing things. I would check with them before the dead line to see if they have any problems. Check with them again later and hopefully they are flying and making isk.
---
Seriously? 
---
..... the price of Titans / Supers and the ISK Faucets produces by cap / super pve would argue that point.
---
Plus, at the rate I've seen pilots consume boosters, I don't see it being much of a problem.
---
&gt; We want to focus 80% toward new players
---
&gt; Ignore the easiest PvP to set up
---
If you have an older playerbase it certainly needs to be calming. If you are teenager then sure, you can have uppity action all the time. Now tell me again, which group are Eve players? The sheer complexity of this game combined with its slow pace makes it perfect for older players. And they already have stressors in their life so they dont need it in their game, they prefer choices.
---
BO might have been a test for that sure, but you got your answer pretty fking quick didnt you? 
---
Well thats a given. But what you see as nothing happening I see something else. If you just focus on one thing, small gang vs. big gang then sure you will get one result. But the game is bigger than that. We in Legacy have been fighting non stop for almost 6 months, were having fun. And this war still didnt kill off as many players as the blackout did in mere 2 months.
---
If you believe that the IP isnt worth much of that and that depends on them actually having a working portfolio then idk.
---
Less on average but a shitton more. Small gang isnt keeping the lights on, blocs are. 
---
No, the overwhelming majority of humans will choose not to play an overly tedious game, especially when they grow older. And they dont also think theyre still teenagers that can run around having their hobbies be filled with stressors.
---
This is just reality dude. You and CCP need to understand that the old Eve is dead. People grew older, the game grew older. Tryna get back something that isnt possible is going to kill the game, thats a fact. Can you create something in between? Sure, but that takes years of work and has to start in the right end. First bring in younger people that have the time/patience for it then slowly adjust losing a portion of the older playerbase. 
---
But what you dont do is just kill of the older playerbase first since that will kill your game.
---
And in this equation, sorry, small gang doesnt even compute. If blocs die the game dies, if small gang dies well...
---
Caracals suck. Buy a Gila or a vexor if you have a bil. Cheapest is 500mil or less for Gila. With a very lucky skill book drop you'll get 700mil from one site. There will be blueprint drops. See if you can make a profit from them. If you can't don't build them.
---
Longer for you to re-ship.
---
&gt;Communist
---
Dude, take an economics class, *please*.
---
Please come krab here :)))
---
Yeah I checked their Soundcloud and I didn't find the music.
---
Try the game out and if you like it buy a subscription. Don't let other people lie to you, EVE is a P2P game.
---
There very much is a summer. Almost too *much* summer.
---
As soon as you decide you like the game enough to do it. The full skill queue and training speed are useful from day 1.
---
I'm too busy working on my gender studies, white male privilege, and political arts degrees
---
Sure, but this time it plummeted to levels not seen in more than a decade. The *"well it's just the summer dip"* excuse doesn't really work with these numbers.
---
Given they folded into Pirat, probably not.
---
Sure!
---
Damn been a while since i checked into their activities. Didn’t know they did that
---
Which is what Ive been saying for 2 fking months. It needs balance. The issue was that CCP wasnt going to iterate, obviously. And in that scenario, i.e., like every thing CCP does, the blackout would be detrimental to the game. Which is true.
---
Like dude, if you actually listen to what people are saying instead of reeing you might get further. I never wanted local back in its current form. But the blackout was just moronic. You dont get a better game if you lose the people playing it, thats just how it works.
---
If blackout had come pre-balanced and tweaked it would have worked. But it didnt so it didnt work. Which is what most of us against the BO have been saying from the start. It was always a question of proper balance, not about "ohh not more risk, please stahp". 
---
That was your groups narrative and honestly, that messed up any form of discussion. Your group kept arguing that if you dont like it, leave the game. And people did just that. So CCP stopped the test. And now you are arguing that people shouldnt have left the game? Like schizo much? You guys got exactly what you wanted, a culling. Now fking enjoy the results. But you didnt realise the consequenses.
---
Yet Exok argues differently right? Ill take his word over yours.
---
Can I bring my Los Angeles to this docking party?
---
Hue hue hue
---
&gt; Your group kept arguing that if you dont like it, leave the game
---
I don't believe I ever said that. And the whole "adapt or die" thing is a meme (after nullseccers have been saying it to PVPers for the last 3 years).
---
&gt; Like dude, if you actually listen to what people are saying instead of reeing you might get further
---
So this is a very low level of self awareness because apparently you support the same thing as a lot of 'our group' (whatever that means) - no local but balance to other risk factors and then a look at rewards. Yet you've been consistently hostile on reddit.
---
Possibly but I like pods. Especially if you liberate them from their HG’S.
---
I can argue that plex is a controlled currency. Not by volume but by price. CCP controls the price of plex in real currency. That rarely changes. But when they notice inflation getting too high and plex prices in isk are too high, they can make some sales of things like plex, skins, or extractors and control the isk price of plex in that way.
---
Take a look at plex price history.  It was up on 4 million and they made changes to VNI and blackout came so the price crashed. Towards the end of that they did extractor sale and pushed the price back towards normal. After that ended and they did cyno changes and it came back down a bit. Not blackout has ended and it is slowly creeping back up again.
---
Very interesting game mechanic, I like it. The only issue I see is tuning the ship and harvester module cycle time numbers down low enough that you could complete 1 cycle per pass through, or the modules would shut off and you'd have to start the pass over again.
---
10,000 bots at least
---
&gt;are they seeded?
---
not yet they aren't   ( ͡\~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
People didn't pay subs for bots back then . Waste of money.
---
Nice
---
When you play battle royale or call of duty game, does the gun just keep shooting by itself or do you have to press a button to make it fire?
---
That's what she said.
---
Ahh, true. Unless there was some clever variation of the falloff mechanic that allowed the module cycle way beyond optimal+falloff. 
---
There's probably more problems with this too.
---
I'd consider a new character that focuses on pvp. Put them in a good corp like idk, Brave Newbies and enjoy all the pvp content you desire.
---
This keeps your isk making safe and always there when you need it, but gives the option to log in for pvp when you feel like blowing things up.
---
Nut up, and jump a WH guy ;-)
---
Yup, that's when I was most active. I came back for 'chaos' but it increasingly looks like a dud. I think the game is going to quietly slip into oblivion unfortunately.
---
Wtf is this?
---
Seems cool.
---
How to joinyou guys for next time?
---
I really wouldnt know, but there were definitely bots and it would definitely be worth to pay for them if they paid for themselves 3 to 4 times over a month.
---
&gt;dont shoot it down because you dont want your gas harvesting income to drop
---
That's not why I think adding a ship with gas mining bonuses is a stupid idea, but okay fam.
---
The can says it's a fruit drink, which fruit however, is not specified...
---
the bots are back in business...period basis got ishtars 10 days  old all belonging to PLA,1/ SYSTEM(goons maybe is time to clear ur shit cuz bots ruining every1 game)...i give 1 year to plex to reach 5 bil...
---
some ppl hold pods so all the fleet can get on it, or to farm local salt if they think you will be mad
---
fun story, the salt case is how i lost my gold pod implant, i got killed and they hold my pod talking shit in local so i started to self destruct and unplugged all implants 
---
protip: read the varning text :-) 
---
20:58:36    Question    Implants are lost when unplugged. Are you sure you want to remove this Genolution 'Auroral' AU-79? 
---
just a small 2,7B missclick
---
No clue I just log in trick and copied dat file and changed name. Worked perfectly in 5 minutes.
---
player count usal goes  up after summer hollydays
---
This is what happens when you spend 80% of your dev time on New Player Experience. EVE is a hard game to get into but they should focus more of their effort on player retention.
---
I'm not saying supers should be deleted from Eve currently. Just that if there were an entirely new game of Eve 2.0, there shouldn't be supers and possibly caps as they currently exist. Having huge, expensive hitpoint sponges with high damage projection makes it impossible for smaller alliances/groups to do real damage, which therefore forces people into large coalitions and is not healthy for the game long-term. 
---
It's a little too late for the current game and I agree that it wouldn't be fair at all to delete things that people spent a very long time grinding for.
---
To my understanding, harvester modules don't fall prey to the optimal/falloff mechanic, they're either in range or they're not, correct?
---
Well, I suppose I can tell you about a small WH conflict from last week that we interjected ourselves with. It's in no way deserving of a thread of bragging though.
---
On September 22nd, one of Squid Squads. scouts reports that we've ran into a C5 Wolf Rayet with several structures in timer.
---
Azbel, Fortizar, Astrahaus. 
---
The Azbel and Astra timers were &lt;24hrs until kill, and the Fortizar was the same timer to ref into it's final timer. After doing some quick zKill voodoo, we estimated loot drops to be 20b, and found that the group doing the eviction was a group called Ronin One.
---
It was determinted that Ronin One was the same size as us in terms of weekly active PvP members ( about ~18/week ) but they had only pulled https://i.imgur.com/7POFdPH.png 10 people for the eviction.
---
So, we were expecting a max show of 10 dudes currently in the hole - great news, out of our active members this week, everyone's a try hard and focused on PvP.
---
Within 30 minutes of rolling into J142438 we had setup a large POS and started stront checking the Ronin One pos with our Revelation. It came out in about ~30 hours, from what I remember.
---
We moved about 15 confessors into our POS (~10 for people, 5 extras), about 5 guardians, and I suggested a few of us pickup some LML Legions, which were able to pump out about 1100 to 50km - so that we would be able to maintain grid control even if we only had a couple of people on - our main fear fighting Ronin One was that they were able to find an exit to k-space and get their friends, Singularity Syndicate in the hole.
---
Only about half an hour after finishing up with the pos, someone rolled our chain home (with our help), locking out some rollers, people, and other stuff. Five minutes after that, I rolled my Revelation into nullsec, as we had taken a Phoenix through the home chain as well.
---
This left us a little bit unprepared, as we only had one roller in the target system, meaning that unwanted connections, and the static c5 was stuck open for about 20-25 minutes every time it spawned. We rolled it a few times, and got the rest of our assets in, and then doorstopped it for the rest of the night. (Doorstopping is putting a rolling ship ready to close a hole on the far side, waiting for someone to jump through, or to lock out a fleet landing)
---
We had the hole on lockdown from here until the end of the op, rolling out about two or three Ronin One scanners.
---
When Ronin woke up, they reached out to me and said that if we are going to kill the people they were attempting to evict, they will leave the eviction to us - despite intel showing that they had already been in this hole for about a **week.** They also explained that they had personal beef with the people in this hole, as they had wronged one of their new members.
---
We still wanted to bang - but we also knew that the defenders, despite being massive krabs, have a LOT of capital ships in this hole, and also could be a problem. We decided to have communication silence with Ronin, as we weren't sure just how many caps the enemy may throw at us, and we didn't just wanna have them moonwalk away, either.
---
First conflict happened at the Azbel &amp; Astra timer, Ronin one arrives with about 3 Kiki and 2 Thalia to contest our 5 confessor, 3 guardian, damnation + support fleet.
---
Yikes.
---
We caught two Thalias after they warped to our cargo can with 1 ammo in it, and the kiki's moonwalked to their POS.
---
We finished off the structures, a rorqual dropped, and we looted the field. The non-main structures loot totaled up to about 10b all in all.
---
During the timers, the group that lived in the hole said in local something along the lines of "We hope they kill you, Ronin. We're glad the big boys showed up, we wont be working with you"
---
The rest of the eviction went pretty unremarkable. We podded a lot of Ronin out, we had the hole doorstopped for two days until the Fortizar's final timer came up.
---
Sometime after we killed their POS, Ronin warped around the last 4 kikis and astero that we didn't loot from their POS, and went out in a blaze of glory. Props to them for not just SD'ing. 
---

---
A few hours after that, everything came crashing down - I wasn't around for this, but we rolled the static for some reason, possibly to get someone in, or something. I'm not quite sure - but this resulted in us almost losing the eviction. First we rolled into Vision Inc's (hole control) home system, fine no problem. We rolled that one off without issue with our now two rolling battleships ~15 minutes. We then connected to Beyond The Last Horizon's (again hole control) eviction. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/c3hbHsw.png
---
we had some panic pings, but as thankfully it was their 20 man eviction fleet and they were already well into it, they just rolled off the connection for us, -1 roller for Squid Squad.
---
We killed an unfit revelation that the people that owned the hole wanted to just throw at us (we thought it was fit) and then finished off the fort. After all was said and done, we went home with 30-35b worth of assets to offload for SRP and scout incentives for a couple days work. We probably made an enemy with Ronin - I thought they were cool dudes and would be happy to invite them to future ops if they were interested, but I feel like we may have muddied the water since this was an important and expensive turkey shoot. Turns out the 10 characters on the structures weren't all in the hole after we took the eviction from them - and Singularity Syndicate - as expected, was going to turn up even if we didn't show up for the timers. 
---
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.
---
A few hours before the Ronin One pos came out of timer, we had an incoming nullsec. We gated our revelation 5 jumps and then used it to finish off the POS and to hit damage cap on the unmanned Fortizar.
---
Overall, it was our first planned op as a corp that was setup as a  siege like this, I think we nailed it. We've been around for about a month and a half now, and I'm quite happy with what we've been able to do in that time.
---
We look forward to the next time we get to contest someone's timers, but it probably wont be a sleepover.
---
Shoutout to the 12 or so actual dudes who showed up and did their part. Squid Squad recruiting btw
---
Nice.
---
the problem of eve is the lack of content and plenty of isk in game,therefore is no incentive to fight...u go after some1 area?ok we move  further isk is plenty
---
This character has definitely been in a wormhole, i think it's only counting system since I lost eve and came back last week.
---
Plex was relatively new. And the playerbase wasn't a bunch of shit carebears back then. There's wasn't ratting capitals or rorquals. Belt ratting bots isn't an attractive option . 😆
---
No reason why they can't be set to use a different mechanic. 
---
At one point in the past, remote-reps didn't have optimal+falloff.
---
Yeah the sov system is old. The citadelss aren't balanced and the playerbase is a clone of one shit f1 ape/carebear
---
Ah, gotcha
---
Nope it's totes true, ask anyone
---
Muh safety
---
You could scope fax reps through signature radius like capital neuts and call it a day.
---
Its amazing compares to t2 or faction ships. All t1 ships have great insurance (except supers? Ive never checked on that)
---
I'm noooooooob
---
looool That's far from ruin my game. But you guys are pro.
---
As boats and shit yeah. I love the rifter. It is by far one of my favorite ships since I started playing. I really like this image and would love to see what else yall can come up with.
---
If you were to institute the falloff mechanic onto harvester modules, I'd think the logical effect would be to increase the yield the closer you got to a mineable object, not the cycle time. Except in the case of ice harvesters, which have a static number of units mined per cycle.
---
Urban legend.  They don't exist.

The ingredients are in the game. Unfortunately Panfam and the Panda Bros followed the CCP recipe and added Dr Pepper to food and Test were all like "wtf is wrong with you, don't do that to food". Also panfam don't use knives and forks, they put their fingers in their mouths when they eat.

You just can't erase that kind of thing. It sticks in your mind. Forever.

Mind sharing a bit about the plot? Really cool idea!
---
&gt; If you have an older playerbase it certainly needs to be calming
---
Or you need a new playerbase. 
---
&gt; The sheer complexity of this game combined with its slow pace makes it perfect for older players
---
Sure, but Eve at it´s very core isn´t a casual game and can´t work as one on a global scale. Trying to force it into that role didn´t work. Which is exactly what we have been seeing for the past 4 years of accelerating player drain and stagnation on top of the aging playerbase. 
---
&gt; BO might have been a test for that sure, but you got your answer pretty fucking quick didnt you?
---
Ofc, which is actually pretty swell for CCP. It also showed that even at this point in time many and especially in the blocs people just kept playing because of sunken cost fallacy. Which is why i said PA or CCP will have zero incentive to actually invest in the game besides working on the NPE to do something about the stagnation on a larger scale. Because it would upset what has now become their definitive main target audience. Casuals that you can milk until it´s no longer economically feasible to keep the game running.    
---
&gt; If you believe that the IP isnt worth much
---
The IP and the company, sure. A 15+ year old game that pulls a few millions in profit while binding enormous amounts of resources and manpower to maintain and upkeep? lol no. 
---
&gt; Small gang isnt keeping the lights on, blocs are. 
---
&gt; If blocs die the game dies, if small gang dies well...
---
Sure. It also dies because of them and the one isn´t without impact on the other. Sandboxes are always trending towards stagnation and casualisation over time, indepentendly from playerbase aging. The question is wether you recognize that fact and do something about it either as a developer or as a player. In this case both didn´t. 
---
&gt; You and CCP need to understand that the old Eve is dead.
---
Me and the droves of players leaving the game in the past 4-5 years understand that very well. So does CCP. But there is no new Eve that will rise from the ashes of the old one. That´s what a lot of people cowering around the last remaining spots of embers still fail to realize. 
---
&gt; Tryna get back something that isnt possible is going to kill the game, thats a fact
---
Exactly. But you need to make sure wether it´s possible or not before coming to that conclusion, no?
---
Very nice dude! Also really like your hel and kikimora drawing!
---
Unnecessary
---
There are a ton of small stories that popped up when they were gathering stories for the comic book years ago - it was really fun reading about all of the player stories that fly under the radar.
---
Sadly, they ended up trotting out the same old BOB treason story.
---
You got april fool'd so hard....
---
Sexy
---
&gt;How is local chat anything to do with 'players having put time and isk into ... the space'?
---
Its not you missed my point completly.
---
I explained how Null currently has a high reward but that comes at the cost of capturing, upgrading and securing a system, building infrastructure to support ratters and miners and having a defence force to assist players. Thats something that requires a huge outlay of time and isk to achieve.
---
CCP added further requirements to using the space (Blackout) and made the effort vs reward balance no longer fun for ratters and miners. And they left.
---
Hopefully CCP have learned that they cant force unfun gameplay onto the majority of their playerbase to appesse a tiny minority of players.
---
I mean, I unsubbed again after they put it back. v0v
---
PH welcomes all 5 of them.
---
It's like theres a fucking frig on gate and I'm the only person that has the speed to scram it before it runs. Only one thing, I accidently clicked a fleet members name and now I can't fucking click on the guy in space.
---
I don't think he does either...
---
Welp. Might put my alt in. My main shall stay in wh/HS.
---
If it was the safest space in eve more people would live there. Take nullsec for example
---
If you want to grind that omega then rattle wh, or go fly incursions and no life.
---
Go back to your safe space.
---
Wow
---
Are there any private servers?
---
I recently tried an MMO called screeps, and they allow you to basically set up private servers for testing code and such, and I've heard WoW has private unofficial servers as well. I was wondering if There was a hidden world of private EVE servers with something like a dozen star systems with it's own stories and such...
---
You can’t avoid them.
---
I see what you [did here](https://youtu.be/zYWT4uYOPvs).
---
Except that is true. 
---
In a WH the lack of local is balanced by the only entry points being the wormholes. A cloaked player on esch on these can report on the ecact number of people entering and leaving and give an almost exact count of ships.
---
Null has stargates, standard wormholes, drifter wormholes, and more importantly cynos both normal AND covert.
---
In a WH 1 ship entering is just that 1 Ship. In null that 1 ship can bring in 100's of ships and no-one would being the wiser.
---
So WH are easier to defend, can be easily locked down with a CCP supplied module, has better ticks, and better intel than Null.
---
No, I'm a 2011 player, I think.
---
Someone already tried and failed.
---
No they didnt. Watched back the entire thing.
---
Holy shit that's awesome
---
Can I have your stuff? Dont let door hit you on the ass as you go we just had it painted.
---
Have some more mushrooms then because yours needs work.
---
Troll post? I can’t be assed watching it again but it is there
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
You didn't fit anything. Never undock without a fitting. And read patch notes.
---
I think CCP is trying to Brexit onto mobile games to cover that 400m Pearl Abyss spent. When statistics are like this, you should start to question your business tactics. Has anyone ever noticed that since CCP Guard left and Pearl Abyss took over?
---
Remember. Goons aren’t here to ruin YOUR game, they are here to ruin THE game.
---
More like tried, succeeded and then lost the peace. It’s like someone put Woodrow Wilson in charge.
---
Is it only on the test server at the moment?
---
*Ehem* Tempest.
---
Only one baby ree was said.   The ree that launched a thousand ships.
---
Calm down dude
---
Lol they expect me to switch over to an eve 2? I have too many things in game and have invested too much. There's people that spent 13 years in this game and I have a year. It's gonna be difficult to get people in.
---
You’re misguided because you keep assuming things that simply don’t fit into my argument or are outright incorrect. I never said, nor do I claim that it is the case, that all ships need to trade evenly so an overwhelming force doesn’t exist. What I am saying is that capitals provide an overwhelming force in the hands of few to deter the many, making it hard for smaller gangs of reasonably contestable ships to launch any type of attack. 
---
Furthermore I get the impression that you think I’m one of these hunters that I seem to be defending (which I am not - I am commenting on the debate). That’s not the case and though I do occasionally roam around I’m mainly in the home defense fleets that deal with the marauding gangs and protecting the krabs. 
---
My main issue is that the krab play style is looking for mechanics to deter player interaction, meanwhile for the game to remain successful we need to encourage that same player interaction. Krabbing in safety creates content for one, krabbing with substantial risk creates content for many more. The safer we get the more isolated the content. 
---
During the blackout, I didn’t need to go anywhere to find content. Hunters came to “farm” the krabs almost constantly. Which created an environment where fights came to the doorstep which creates content for me and the hunters and forced krabs to interact with everyone else to call out invaders. When blackout stopped l, the krabs left comms (those that remained at least) and stopped interacting. 
---
The overwhelming force that deterred hunters during blackout was eventual blobbing (which has its own issues) but nonetheless after repelling a gang, the gang got content, the defense force got content (and a feeling of accomplishment) and the krabs got to go back to krabbing. 
---
How does making things safe create this level of content and player interaction? I’m not sure I can think of a real way but I am certain open to hearing reasonable opinions.
---
You can play for free as an alpha and no other servers.
---
Don't let your dreams be memes.
---
Get a rapid light a-type shield boosting rattle. Keep MTU and depot on you to collect and switch loot while in sites. You can skip the depot if you have 3 cap mods in low and 3 dda and gecko+salvage drones. Why rapid lights? Because they apply nice. Mid slots can be cap battery and rapid lights or missile comps. Make sure the rattle is stable with only 3 cap mods in the low. 1-2 thukker cap batteries will be enough in the mids to make it stable. Remember to keep 2 active resists fit in mods. Cap rigs should be fitted.
---
There's a thing going on in Vale right now. If you're patient enough, wait for a Lord's Servant post about it, but be forewarned: he does write like Jade Constantine.
---
&gt;This entire reply chain is full of fucking morons.
---
Considering no one has replied to you yet and it's just you and me in here, I'd tend to agree.
---
Reading the minutes from CSM 11 until CSM 13, it gets a could of mentions but the things that need changing the Void bomb nerf isn't in the minutes anywhere that I could find, the only thing I could find is a request for the Low power change and some complaining about Astra drifter farming. 
---
Like this quote from CSM 11 sums it up nicely.
---
&gt; CCP Seagull asked what does the CSM find exciting to do with their groups. Aryth replied they really like their citadels, with other people agreeing that their groups also are liking them.
---
Join a different Corp and do something different.
---
Join up with the Partizans group and go on an offensive deployment with their small gangs.
---
Go WH daytripping
---
Sounds like you should start stockpiling the fuel and recons to lay these entities that are going to evict goons because its going to cost a lot of money to move the north + northeast side of the map to the southwest.
---
it seems clear, no bubbles no campers .. but I still wouldn't jump in without a scout
---
This is a good one :D
---
Yeah considering another character makes sense for just going straight for pvp and being able to pass isk between them thanks for the direction.
---
If you wanna fuck with roaming gangs fit a Hyperion with triple rep and full tank, no damage mods. Fit a grappler web and scram on mids and just wait for them to make the mistake of getting into scram range to stop your MJD. The ship insured costs so little to lose and it's fun to be able to fight so many people at once.
---
It only started tracking statistics since the implementation of the activity tracker. Anything done before that doesn’t count.
---
Sounds fun, have to try it when I quit being a pussy
---
Assumed as much, I'll start looking around. Thanks!
---
Try finding some PVP in WH. It's a bit tougher, but chances are, you're not gonna get 20 assholes on you + supers. 
---
Or join a WH corp. Whatever you have isn't that hard to move with asset safety or even just your alliance logistics. What's the most valuable is friends and connections.
---
Void bomb nerf was ABSOLUTELY discussed at length at the summit so that's a failing of the minutes. You can feel free to ask the devs about it if you really want, as Fozzie/Rise were adamant at the time they weren't presenting a doctrine diversity issue - You may need to look at the balancing section specifically as that's where we talked heavily about it IIRC.
---
CSM 11-1 was also ~3 months after the release of Citadels and most people had not had to deal with the horror that was actually grinding them/timezone tanking by that point.
---
To pull some quotes from 12-1 in order to prove my point that you can read [here](https://cdn1.eveonline.com/community/csm/Meetings/summit/CSM12-S1.pdf);
---
&gt; Jin'taan has stressed that vulnerability windows are hamstringing opportunities for strategic combat, and that timezone tanking is causing lots of problems.
---
&gt;Void Bombs were brought up. Jin'taan brought up that the most recent change seems like a bit of a light nerf. CCP Fozzie explained that the changes were aimed primarily at significantly adjusting the radius first, while only mildly adjusting the amount. He then continued that the long-term plan is to replace the bomb launcher with the supercarrier projected effects. The CSM explained that currently citadels are perceived to be oppressive with their offensive E-War options (especially Void Bombs and Tackle) and otherwise aren't really interesting otherwise. Jin'taan brought up that the current state means that the number of fleet types that can be brought to fight a citadel is extremely limited. CCP Fozzie responded that they expect they will have at least one more pass to citadel weapons before they expect they can swap over to super carrier type projected effects.
---
It's pretty sad that SkillQ shuts down, but I 100% understand your decision. The new smartphone app is covering this functionality.
---
I remember the days of Battleclinic, Osmium, etc...
---
There are so few 3rd party applications now.
---
Makes me a bit sad, tbh.
---
Ran out of money which held the whole thing together. The forces assembled actively tried to reset each other for good fights whenever possible.

I would bet a small WH corp might have a similar experience, especially if you don't go high-class. It's not entirely "private server" as others can get to you, but your system is somewhat isolated and in the small corp, individual contributions matter a lot. Give it a whirl, might be fun for you.
---
Caldari lowsec near fw warzone is fun.
---
Gallete/Amaar gate?
---
Man, are we even talking about the same game?
---
I was thinking about it, but I only have 6mil so or so and it seems like wh have a high sp cap to do anything profitable. I'll have to work on PvP too, or do you suggest the trial by fire approach?
---
I like farming. All I do is industry. It is full of content for me. Blackout pushed me to quit.
---
to be fair, that would be the true eve way of doing things
---
The biggest of oofs
---
Boosters aren't the problem, gas size is pretty small compared to the enormous clouds in W-space. 
---
Maybe it can have some specialty crystals\\ammo\\whateves to buff specific gas extraction? And make it curve so there's not much high-end gas improvement, but some garbage like C84 gets a good boost?
---
It feels like yesterday when NC. had horde neutral but PL blue and would just farm horde all day. Or the time NC. had a Titan DD a horde alts carrier during a drunk fleet. How times have changed a lot. We're either living in a cursed timeline or some time traveler really fucked up for these string of events happen. Bless horde, really good alliance and I'll always have a soft spot for them. Hopefully Burning Napalm will have fun joining the Horde.
---
More duct tape
---
C2\\C3 farming in Praxis or Drake are not very reliant on skill of the pilots. There is also exploration that is a bit random but can get you 200M in half an hour if you're lucky, or a billion from one site if you're super-lucky. 
---
As for PVP, either trial by fire or find someone to fly duo and help you get the ropes. Fleets are not gonna teach you much.
---
&gt; All these people talking about how sad they are that their starter corp declined just need to look in the mirror to see why. Ya left ya bois.
---
That might have had something to do with the leadership spending years making it an actively hostile place for anyone who actually knew how the game worked or wanted to be half way competent.
---
Sounds like eve isnt for you.
---
It sounds like you need Faction Warfare. It's a great place to try out PvP. Join a Corp with 100 people or more. Try out Ushra'Khan, Guardians of the Gate, or Red Vs Blue.
---
PvP in FW is usually over gated complexes, which restrict ship sizes. This means that a lot of inexpensive T1 frigs, destroyers, and cruisers are actually good in the micro meta created inside.  This means you can learn to PvP cheaply.  My favorite ship is still the kyte Tristan.  You can get those for 10mil and have a blast.  You can also learn a lot about small gang PvP.
---
As for finding targets, your Corp will be in a decently active area because they all love PvP too and they aren't a part of a huge blue doughnut.  Still, it is VERY hard for a new player to be "good" at PvP without first flying with those that are more experienced.  I highly recommend you always be on comms and always be in a fleet.
---
Don't move over right away. Grind a billion or two in nullsec and make sure your neutral alt has a blockade runner.  Your PvP main won't be able to access highsec because it will eventually go pirate.
---
PM me for more information.

We had a fun one in a C2 wormhole where a guy decided he was going to try to wreck our shit. He plopped an Astra shortly after they came out (which we almost killed as it finished anchoring, except that a secondary group that came in and scared us off while we were bashing...)
---
It was a pain in the ass for a long time, because he and a buddy would try to pop our towers without enough firepower.
---

---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/59635538/
---
That first group that scared us off while we were bashing the Astra initially turned out to be from Wrong Hole. We got to know them pretty well, and they helped us bash the Azbel.
---
Then the group that 5h3ll had continually batphoned got pissed and turned on them, helping us kill the Astra a couple weeks later.
---
We all won the game a few months after that, but it was my happiest moment in game.
---
There are private testing servers yes. These are sometimes opened up to the public for mass testing but mostly these are closed off. Singularity is the public testing server. 
---
You also have the Thunderdome server, which was a server used for hosting tournaments, including the Alliance Tournament. Access to this was given with the go ahead from CCP.
---
Yeahh- yea-heh! Woo!
---
They are dropping resources from EVE to this a  "brand new, revolutionary action MMORPG".
---
Makes me sad. The AT was the only "official" e-sports like event for EVE. Tbh, when they announced "no AT in 2019", I remember saying to myself "It's the beginning of the end".
---
They could have subcontracted it to EVE NT. The cost is minimal (for an international Asian-European gaming company anyway) and maintains presence during the low months of activity.
---
The argument that the format is stagnating is stupid. It's based on EVE's gameplay. 
---
CCP is not in need of money. They have PA as sugar daddy. They should rethink this.
---
Involves me logging on that does

Hmm can you go and ask if they have 2 for sale?

Lelob isn't in a crab alliance (supposedly).

Maybe the game just isn't for you.

And think, tranquility has accepted all he Chinese players and yet the login count is still low.

---
What ever you do, make friends... To me even has always been a social game. Even when I'm doing something solo like moving stuff around or solo over, having some one to talk to makes it worth logging in.
---
inb4 Hilmar does a whole load of goalpost moving and narrative and statistics spinning to prove to PA that the "important" numbers have indeed increased, like that podcasts a few months back where he claimed that some MAU and DAU, whatever the fuck they might be are the highest in the past 5 years... that statement probably aged so well...
---
Always a cloaky thing hiding
---
That's all that's in the minutes about the void the bomb nerf, so from the minutes it seems CCP has made the decision regarding void bombs without the CSM input and it seems to be a pattern almost all the changes a CSM member takes credit for are not part of the minutes, so either CCP is consistently failing at recording positive impact or CSM members are overselling their advocacy of popular positions. 
---
CSM 11-2 also has no mention of void bombs.and 4 mentions of citadels, drifter farming, and market data.
---
Really bro?  You are going to repost this hours after the dude who actually made it posted it?

I genuinely recommend staying away from the big mega groups for new players.  It's hard to find your own way in there and the content they provide is largely aimed at strategic blob level objectives.
---
The best thing you can do for yourself is find some close friends to play the game with.
---
I stopped my sub for 10 accounts after they placed local back. It clearly shows they have 0 plans about the future, and they only follow the money trail.

Imagine how hard was EVE as a new player in 2006-2010 era. And yet the players were incredibly involved in that, learning skills, alot of lvl 5 skills required that now you only need lvl 4 to train, no injectors, etc. And yet ppl played. Now eve is wayyy eaaier to upgrade as a new char to a specific point. But seems CCP thinks its to hard for new players. A bit contradictory.
---
22k on a friday evening. EVE is truly strugling

I would recommend moving back to HiSec, join a small corp and learn and get more comfortable with what YOU like and want to do in Eve.  Null can be a good life but, only once you've got some basics mostly mastered.
---
This fits so good with the game! Love it.
---
Those are called “women.”
---
When flying around in a BS, just be prepared for people to drop blops/caps on you. It'll happen eventually. (Happened to me within 4 minutes of undocking once)
---
Looks at my Echelon
---
Usually reddit tells you when something has been posted before. I didn't know it was posted...
---
:chill:
---
Lol, sorry that this a subscription game bro, can't just slide around on the free trial expecting to use everything.
---
Ei oo

Fw space would be good place for you to learn solo pvp.  And can fly cheap ships.  Message me in game for fits and tips of you want.  I've killed a lot of fw pilots.  Knuk Eh.

---
Yeah. my char hit the 5mil skillpoint cap and I can no longer be fucked to log in, RIP.
---
Trust me people who live in wspace bitch a lot more about those issues than they do about nullsec
---
Pretty cool if you ask me, one thing that is pretty unique to Eve is the real life friendships and close knit sense of community that is built in many groups.
---
Agreed. Please expedite this immediately or at your earliest convenience so I have a reason to resub.
---
The gameplay/skilling/outfitting is easy for a newbro.
---
Finding lasting enjoyment, a sense of purpose or accomplishment, or just plain fun is the hard part.
---
&gt;Your challenge after that is bribing/paying the toxic forces of elite pvp to blue each other 
---
Precedent shows that it's not really *bluing* on these occasions, providing that the dank frags are assured enough and someone else does the hard work.
---
En tunnusta.
---
I don't think game mechanics exist to allow it.. the blob got blobbed a few years ago and basically just turned the game off until the threat died of boredom.
---
Yup, 2007 player and I'm still playing daily.
---
You are a legend
---
Guess the „smallest war“ is RC version Provi bloc. atm
---
was just casually browsing reddit but now im projectile vomiting
---
Did you jump jump jump?
---
&gt;No. Goons are just doing Goon things in Goonland, they aren't ruining anything.
---
but but but the MER... :(
---
Don't Fleet my REEEeeee you carebear faggot piece of shit!
---
Something stainguy didn't post.
---
Dat feel when CCP expect players to also market the game for them free of charge because CCP is so incompetent it amazes you how they even got to this point in the first place...
---
I feel the same here fam.
---
&gt;The forces assembled actively tried to reset each other for ~~good fights~~ dank rental cash whenever possible.
---
ftfy
---
should be proud of yourself, it takes some people years to reach the same conclusions
---
so meta
---
Try finding a smaller group, you can easily feel lost inside a big group. Especially where horde gets so much traffic in a day; you are just throwing yourself at a wall without learning much.
---
You would if you played the game. :^)
---
Welcome Burning Napalm! Glad to have you guys in Horde!
---
I love Frat's logo.
---
The above comment is a good one. You don't need to feel like you have to leave PH, you can try a change of scenery by joining a smaller Corp within the Alliance and try making some closer friends there, or have some "smaller scale" experiences while not necessarily losing touch with the bigger Alliance ops.
---
My experiences with Partizans are just when fighting them, especially recently as they deployed to Curse to hit us in Scalding Pass. It was brief, but seem like a great bunch of pilots.
---
Just don't be hard on yourself. The game already does that. You are right in trying to find some new goals, but don't overthink that.
---
Sometimes it's good to just get out of the biggest "newbro" Corp into a smaller more tight knit one, and who knows, maybe just the spam on Slack/Discord will make your spinning in a keepstar experience worth it ;)
---
not saying this to inflate the egos of people who do AT, they certainly wouldnt need any help at all with that, but when you take the predator out of the ecosystem, everything is affected all the way down to little worker ants.  I cant believe im hearing that AT relied on CCP volunteers, although it is CCP so maybe I shouldnt be surprised
---
i didn't know this kind of stuff was added to game.        
---
Like why?
---
Not true. I've been through periods where i feel just like OP. But nowadays I'm having a blast.
---
Guarantee it's a trap, way too quiet.
---
You sure? Saying "its just the coverstory" might be a ruse to cover that its not the cover-story... \*keeps folding that tinfoil-hats\* \^\^
---
That’s a voice I haven’t heard in a while
---
Jump in an prep for the titan decloak and boson spool
---
listen the only redeeming quality of the CSM minutes is 3 pages of a recipe that I get to try, everything else makes me overly depressed about the state of the game. pulling out the slow cooker today.
---
Its sanctum
---
Hey, i love this idea to an unteasonable degree. If you want to advance this worlds time period/ tech level to more resemble new eden (eventually, boats are rad and there is a lot of fum there) check out the 3.5 spelljammer stuff. Lot of really cool spaceship stuff there
---
I’ve unsubbed  10 accounts.
---
Imo being deecent at pvp takes patience and practice. I krabbed all my play time for 6 years even when I was in another null alliance but started pvping after joining Horde. Keep flying cheap small ships till you feel comfortable enough to whelp more expensive stuff. Once you start to get the hang of it nothing else will be more fun.
---
- Also give exploration a shot. 
---
- You can do PI for extra passive-ish income.
---
btw, just getting your assets to places where you can access it when leaving your current gang can be a fun task already. You re a smuggler moving supposedly precious goods through hostile territory, scouting, checking, quickly charging through a gate and hurrying off to some premade safespot on the other side, hoping no probes appear on dscan... I kinda enjoy that at least :)  
---
And as others said: Just move somewhere else before you start getting angry at those in your current group for not providing the gameplay you d like. Be aware that eventually you cant be doing stuff in smaller entities you re eventually used to do. But EVE can be fun without Rorqs and flinging Caps left and right.
---
Find the EVE you like, its out there somewhere :)
---
Honestly it's plain scary at this point how clueless CCP are... How does a company get so popular with a certain community while having absolutely zero clue of what the fuck they are doing? 
---
Or is this whole thing just riding on the success of people that are no longer working for CCP?
---
Hey u/SweatyNerd6969 You should try gas mining in wormhole sites. The level 3 sites are worth a lot of money, and you can huff a decent amount of gas before NPC's spawn. This is a really good way to fund some PvP ships. You're also more likely to catch solo players or small gangs instead of 40 man fleets in wormhole space.
---
Woooosh /s
---
I've been around 13+ years mate, was making a joke at how fucking ridiculous training level 5 skills are.
---
Join a smaller group, in the huge null blocs you're just a face in the crowd and your actions have pretty much no impact. In a smaller group, yes it will be tougher in some situations, yet you learn so much and you have more impact. 
---
Shop around for a new corp, it can be another NS group, it could be even a Wormhole or a LS group. All areas of the game have more smaller scale entities that you can join. Don't rush into a new corp, take your time and evaluate and see what it is you want.
---
You can mine in highsec, get your logi cruiser skills to Max and join an incursion group make a bunch of money then contact me when you feel your up for something more
---
&gt;It's in no way deserving of a thread of bragging though.
---
WTF? Jeez, man. Thats good, grade A1 small-scale shit right there! Push up your self-esteem, you deserve it!
---
This is what so many people don't get.
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
Actually, reading through the minutes gave me some respect for him, as he was showing he does in fact understand the issues a number of people here (myself included) were arguing with him about during the Blackout.
---
He does appear to genuinely want what is good for the game, I just think he's been focusing on the symptoms and not the cause.
---
As everyone is pointing out, FW is a great option!! Allowing for that smaller level of PvP to learn. I would just like to plug my last guild I was in. Last Rites, a gallente FW guild. We almost always had fleet up, and the guys who ran them were very knowledgeable and willing to teach you even mid-combate!
---
Buy Omega or play the game your way to earn isk for Omega.
---
And yet people still watch their favourite team even if they completely disappoint.
---
I had all intentions to grind to omega as a newbro. Made it to 300mil before giving up.
---
\#YeaManFuckMan
---
No shit, there is at least one at the table.
---
Dang someone must have smoked around the newborn clones again
---
True, that worked so well last time.
---
Nah wasn't her.  I feel bad calling out people so left out name.  Lets just say she's probably not fun at parties.
---
Oh look at mister fancy pants and his fancy eating tools
---
If you change your gameplay, you can enjoy eve. Everyone is holding onto the past, and crying. Let the past die. It will never return, for the time/effort spent on complaining about it is a waste. 
---
Want some content, AVRSE is waiting for you in Obe.
---
My point is that I already paid to train those skills. I feel that I should be able to use them
---
&gt;I called righteous fury down from the heavens
---
Don't use his name in vain. He's sleeping. :|
---
TREASURE PLANET!
---
You aren't the only one who feels this way. Early days/weeks in any Corp is about finding you feet, you could do well having a one on one talk with an NBI. they will speak with you and help you set goals before advising on how to start off towards those goals.
---
I have always been a fan of Vegas, and have traveled there with my kids when they were that age and younger.  
---
The trick is having a good  briefing before going and a good debriefing after.  More important with younger kids, but even teenagers need to be able to ask questions about the local ‘wildlife’.  
---
Having been to lots of different Fanfest, Vegas could actually be a pretty good time if your son enjoys Eve and talks. People are friendly.  Their is a fair bit of just hanging out where you can chit chat with people.   There are also lots of non-Eve things to do in the city.  Shopping and people watching.  The pools may still be open, but sadly it’s getting near the end of ‘pool season’
---
What’s inconvenient with kids...most of the evening activities are 21+.  The other thing is that lots of groups enjoy hanging out and chit chatting at hotel bars/lounges, which will frown on anyone under 21 hanging out.  The areas around the conference though, the last time I looked, were ‘all ages’.  
---
Just keep in mind that their is not one ‘right’ way to do an Eve get together, especially Vegas.   Lots of people love to go solo, hang out at talks, and then do independent things.  Others never go to a talk, don’t buy tickets, and just hang out with friends.  Most people take the middle road.  
---
Just dive into the hole and have a great time! 
---
If you see Allbur Chellak hanging around come over and say hi!
---
Great seeing Eve nerds meeting up around the world. Love from the Imperium London crew xoxoxo.
---
In eve it's not what you do, it's who you do it with. You can check out the evejobs sub if you are looking for a group to play with.
---
Have you spotted any Drifters lately?
---
Eve university is where I grew up at. Ventured into Red vs Blue for awhile as well. Then I settled down into horde after I felt that I had the basics down. But your always going to run into some adhd nerd with elite piloting skills if you venture out into space often.  If you want to learn solo pvp or small gang, I would recommend recording your adventures so that you can review them at later time for potential mistakes that you made and work on correcting them over time.  Only way to get gud is to be bad. 🤘
---
lmao this is retarded
---
Looks like you went to a Hollywood lip puffer.
---
&gt; but a all-in war against the largest threat this game has, Goons.
---
Because that went great the last time.
---
The minute goons relocate the coalition formed against them crumbles and forgets to keep on applying the pressure.
---
So thats where they finally put the low sec gate to Stain
---
Guess what? Again, new skin are red and gold.
---
People push new players to hop into big groups like horde. I think it’s a mistake.
---
Horde isn’t what brave newbies was. That’s gone. 
---
Eve is a social game; join a small corp, with a few people. Make friends. Do stuff together :)
---
Did you try looking on Eve survival?
---
Nope, but magic creates an extra dimensional space where the stuff can be stored (think the Harry Potter tent).
---
How to fix the NPE: fix the fucking default overview
---
Being a goon id be happy for this content
---
Singularity is pretty damn close to a private server
---
None of tide are changes made by ccp? Find me one patch note of ccp increasing the reward.
---
Vale is the wild west atm. Constant conflict among many groups and from all surrounding areas.
---
A threat to what?
---
Kinda why its strongly discouraged to do it until you can do it without draining even half of your wallet. It eats fun, your sanity and makes you feel like you're at your day job.
---
&gt;I'm docked up in the beanstar in r1O, and I haven't really found a reason to undock
---
Because you fell for the meme and joined a huge nullbloc Corp
---
Gave me 2 years of entertainment, on and off. Not gonna complain, just not entertaining enough to sub :)
---
ei
---
That's the problem they just pointed out. 
---
It shouldn't be standard that people need a premade overview just to play the game.
---
Near, far, wherever you are
---
a Proteus will always be with you
---
Denial: the game is fine guys, it's just bots unsubbing
---
Anger: You fucking salty bittervets are just scaring off newbies with your salty bitterness
---
Bargaining: M-maybe they'll announce something at EVE Vegas g-guys, they're not done yet!!
---
Depression: Most of /r/eve
---
Acceptance: your post
---
It's a beautiful thing to see
---
Have you checked Default-&gt;All on overview? Maybe it is just a category change. I used All for this mission anyways.
---
Can't really help you but want to ask, where did you get the mission(ie. Which nation?) Kinda want to try getting back to L5s and try the theoretical cheapskate setup I made. 
---
Oh one more thing, if you're sure you can't get the objective done because of a bug, ask the support to complete it or reset it.
---
I'm kinda the reverse, the mega groups are great for showing people the ropes and the generic fleet stuff **but** you grow out of it quickly.  The key is once you get the basics down, like OP seems to have, in order to advance you need to find groups that don't have the luxury of a guaranteed 50+ person fleet.
---
Winter 2011 was Peak Eve imo
---
&gt; it's because wormhole space in the eye's of many shouldn't work, it has all the mechanics that nullsec claims case stagnation but somehow it's alive and doing relatively well.
---
&gt; it has all the mechanics that nullsec claims..
---
Ya, no cynos, no supers and no local..
---
&gt; somehow it’s alive...
---
So basically, the Chaos Era concepts actually work, without all the salty bitches crying about their sandcastles...
---
Just facts tbh
---
&gt; NOW
---
nice meme
---
Do make sure you have seen every thing we have to offer:
---
BFL, easily the best PVP fleet (thx cphixs bottle of wine). Normally 20-30 dudes max, there is a lot of room to step up and try new things in this group.
---
1HP, huge fleets but are desperate for scanners, tackle and command dessis. Step up be the dude who get first point on our next titan kill.
---
Also we have a lot of vouch corps in horde these people do there own thing most of the time. Like any good pvp corp they require a vouch, to get that just step up and and start talking to these dude and be useful.
---
Make sure you do not get in the habit of logging in and just waiting for content, you would not do it in a small corp and you should not do it in a large one. 
---
The fcs can ping just because you are online, you sure as hell can.
---
We trained him, well....?
---
Ive seen over 500. Its unlimited duration almost certainly
---
It's an important fact that people denying the game's collapse have ignored.
---
It's a contraction for 'we are' we're = we are
---
Hopefully I don't have to struggle though any terrible titles
---
Join Stay Frosty for a bit in lowsec to really learn how to fly in small gangs and get to know your ships well, then from there decide where to take your talents!
---
He's a new player, he shouldn't be feeling bored of the game.  
---
It's easy to bullshit him but it's more likely that he's just not that into the game.
---
game is dead ,fucking game...today s content suck balls
---
around 100 joined ranks in period basis bots
---
Ronin ONE ceo here - yeah we've put the loot on your tab. :P
---
We look forward to running in to you guys.
---
Its something like 40 hours of null ratting (assuming 15 million ticks, which is waaaay higher than a newbie will get in a myrm) to plex. Its not really viable even with optimal math on your side
---
This may have been mentioned (I'm lazy and have not read all the comments), but maybe try joining Eve University for a while. They'll teach you a lot about PvP (and everything else you want to learn in Eve) and they do a lot of small gang fleets.
---
This is why I tell people to avoid these newbro alliance feeder corps. You got told to go to PHorde because it's what everyone recommends new players do. But you're one of thousands. You're no one to anyone (I mean no offense by this). Go find a smaller group that is newbro friendly but isn't a part of some big bloc, learn the game from them, and naturally you'll make some new friends which will make the game more enjoyable.
---
EVE isn't fun without people who help make the game fun around you. Find the right corp until you find friends and fun.
---
Stellaris leans into the Space Opera epic story thing, and it's really good at that. These days it's also a pretty good economy building game, but it is most definitely not where you look for any sort of realism when it comes to governments or civilizations.
---
CK2 focuses on characters and their interactions, having great political, diplomatic and intrigue mechanics. Every character has their own story and that's where it really shines. It has a decent approximation of medieval feudalism for a certain time period and certain place (high middle-ages western Europe), but not totally accurate or as complex as it gets. It's about as good as you can reasonably put in a game. If you play at a date earlier than it's default 1066 start the feudalism is anachronistic, and if you play somewhere other than western Europe or with a different government type (Muslim, tribal, republic, etc.) it doesn't make much sense. It basically approximates all those to "Feudalism but..." which isn't accurate.
---
So the CSM is useless because CCP doesn't listen to them, and CCP listening to CSM is also how we ended up where we are today?
---
Hmm...
---
&gt; looks like it takes hours
---
If you didnt know already, you can fit a rig called a "Large Higgs Anchor" which doubles the mass of the ship, pair that with a large prop mod like a 500mn mwd, you can increase mass of your ship up to 300m which lets you close a wormhole in a c3 in about 4 passes.
---
If none of these things work for you, then it's ok to play another game or do some other hobby for a while.
---
The open secret is that people drop out of the game for months all the time - actually it's one of the reasons why GSF has so many characters
---
[deleted]
---
So how does a Barbarian - Sorcerer hybrid class look like in EVE ?
---
I'm going whether or not. The gambling, drink and food will still be there.
---
Your in R10 with horde, why don't you apply to a different Corp say within NC, tri or slyce? You would learn a lot from the first two. I don't know what's up with NC, slyce I don't know if that's worth much either. Tri is by far going to have the best skilled pilots to learn from in your region, but I imagine their requirements would be pretty high for a new player to meet. PL is around there too somewhere but I think they're dead or afk/dieing of atrophede 
---
I mean your in an alliance right now that is a huge blob by nature so really you are just a number. Try something not so big is my suggestion but you don't have to go halfway across the galaxy either!! If I was you the simplest way is what I suggested if you want to learn pvp
---
bye noob
---
My will to log in
---
sick, I'd love to test myself and find out how bad i truly am :D
---
That’s the point, the changes where years ago with citadel / skill injectors / jump changes.
---
Their effects have been compounding over the years as the super umbrellas build and more people use them.
---
WARs CANNOT BE FOUGHT DUE TO GAME MECHANICS, THANKS FOR LISTENING.
---
Grade-A response
---
For a large period of it's existence, this number was substantially higher. The trend also isn't pointing upwards
---
No, we cheered for our AT teams, no matter how well or how stupid they played.
---
So nothing ccp changed in the past 2 years has made it easier to make money as the original claim goes?
---
And if I come with a list of changes from the past 2 years that made making isk harder in null are you just going to disregard those?
---
The AT brings tons of viewers to Eve on Twitch, which in turn moves Eve higher up on the browse page, and has a better chance of people checking Eve out. 
---
Twitch is one of the greatest recruitment tools for Eve, the AT would help so much with this.
---
Hi coreaxe
---
the prophecy of ZE Big Blue Donut?
---
Yeah, I was gonna say. Small world!
---
Single-tether can repair the ship, but double-tether makes the crew healthier, too.
---
I feel your pain. I haven't undocked in weeks. I refuse to be part of blued-up null alliances but due to my TZ I can't find a corp that's active when I'm on. EVE has peak game times now and when you're not in those peak hours it gets rough. Most advertised corps are smaller than 100 people which rules out a lot of people. When the corp is too small I just end up still being solo. Solo can be okay, but it means there is A LOT I can't do.
---
So yeah. Not having a reason to undock is a common thing.
---
You absolutely must update your overview to ensure you can see them. They destroy you quickly.
---
Stupid question time! ! Isn't doing this the same thing as buying bubbles in a mobile game?
---
make it community event again, now is the time? :)
---
Tethers get red as you get to their extreme range, as a bit of a visual warning that you're about to exit tether distance and lose tether.  In this case it seems that they managed to place the two structures close enough so that you're within the safe tether distance of one structure, while being in the extreme tether distance of another structure - thus allowing for overlap.
---
This is true.😁
---
Shitty gimmicks to entice new players with no back end story, dev or player driven, and skill injectors meaning no time or energy is needed to utilize better mods/ships. Anyone who is shocked by this is either trolling or retarded. Anyone who says it isn't an issue is just retarded (hey Radakos)
---
ALRIGHT WHO's PLAYING EVE IN RALEIGH!
---
Join a Nullsec Corp and kill NPC's in the biggest ratting ship you can fly
---
The range of tether isn't that long, no way you can place a structure close enough. Just undock from one and you'll see the ring of lights around the station, which marks the thether's perimeter.
---
When you're thethered and warp off from a structure the wire doesn't disappear the instant your ship is outside of that range, it lingers for a bit. I'm guessing this guy warped his ship to another structure, then took the screenshot while still in warp, in range of the new thether, with the old wire still in place (but not actually thethering him.)
---
Or it's just a simple visual bug :,)
---
Join a highsec incursion community
---
For maximum isk/effort, join a nullsec alliance, afk rat in a myrmidon while watching Netflix. Just keep an eye on local and intel. 
---
If you mean most isk/hour, exploration  or trading is your best option. If you join a wormhole Corp you get a few more like c3 ratting or gas huffing in a c5/c6, but doing those things while not in a good wormhole Corp isn’t really worth it. 
---
And don’t try to plex yourself, unless you want to burn out and quit
---
Well your problem was joining a large null block to start . That's just like having a second job. You don't learn much or get any challenge to become skilled . So try a smaller entity. Something different.
---
No his original claim was that reward has done nothing but go up, when ccp has actually been reducing the ability to make isk for the past 2 years. These are contradictory statements.
---
dont think a bus warps fast enough must be a bug
---
Larger corps / alliance makes it easier to make money but really kills some of indenpendece thinking of PVP because its all handed to you like a spoon. No doubt thr FCs and top leaders have a ton of fun but if your just a cog in the machine its kinda boring.
---
It was a trap :) Either saying I was a degenerate for eating ass, if I defended my self saying I did, or a prude if I said I didn't, and it didn't make me a degenerate.
---
Drekavac/Guardian fleets every other day. With T3C support obviously.
---
Everything is better than the 17-Lokis-fleets tho.
---
Ive been running abyssals for a year. Never, not once ever, have I ran out of time. But I have had 5+ unlucky wrecking shots from a tyrannos putting me below peak shield recharge and fucking me over, and been neuted out. Cap and tank is easily the most important thing in an abyssal site, especially in 4's and 5's.
---
And they will never mute their microphone in voice comms. Like EVER. They will blast it directly into it and if you say something after 4 hours that maybe he can mute him for a minute or two because it's getting annoying they're 100% like "WTF YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT I DONT SMOKE YOU ASSHOLE OMG"
---
as if I need to be thankful that they decide they dont wanna ruin their own body (?).
---
They also - when meeting another one of their kind - constantly talk about the newest models and technical details, it feels more religious than apple users, damn...
---
Sure, but doing an hour of overtime is easier and more profitable than an hour of krabbing
---
The reward -has- gone up. More and more people are embracing super / capital ratting under the umbrellas. They are training more alts into those ships.
---
End result total reward is going up.
---
BuT WiNgSpAn ArE nOt WoRmHoLeRs
---
yes
---
The reward for a player has not gone up and has actually gone down as ccp makes it harder to rat and mine. Those are actual changes ccp has made.
---
just periodically delete all &gt;-10 characters tbh
---
I would look into a small low sec alliance if i were you, alt will have daily small gang stuff, its what has kept me playing
---
true, but even emptier these days
---
ya can loomk up Skepy corp, they helped and help me alot
---
Yes i'm sure, the mind control ray actually comes from that black radar dome under your fridge.
---
Wah wah wah EvE is dying! Wah wah wah bots! Wah wah wah cyno! Wah wah wah etc.
---
Play the damn game, or don’t.
---
Ok ... let’s try this again.
---
Citadels / Jump Changes / Injectors / PANIC made super and capital pve widely popular under a super umbrella. That popularity is only increasing as more people inject into it and upgrade.
---
Before those changes the majority of pve was subcap based. Minor reductions to super / capital pve doesnt change that.
---
In other words ... of your making 10 USD an hour, changes come to buff that to 100 USD an hour, and then reductions come to reduce that to 80 USD an hour. Your still +70 USD an hour.
---
Someone is getting bored in JU standing I see
---
Say you can mute your mic if it's a big problem with your family. You can get by alright by responding in text chat.
---
Or you can just use voice like everyone else, you can block any weirdos if the situation arises. Dont go around sharing any personal information. You will find most players keep their IRL identity seperate from their game one.
---
Yes indeed
---
Yeah I agree with you here. The huge new player groups beat the shit out of the 2-8 man highsec turd corps where you'll never see another player and they have zero ambition or abilities. 
---
But you're also right people outgrow the new player blobs and there is only so far they'll take you. Nothing wrong with that, I think even the guys running the new player blobs would agree with that.
---
Neither of them are anywhere close. Second galaxy is a crazy p2w mobile garbage and albion doesnt feel like eve at all

3v3\* and you could actually scale up our methods to 5v5 But frankly. And I don't even see what that matters either.
---
that's ight, check it out sometime.  [https://eve-cs.com/](https://eve-cs.com/)
---
Come do some FW PVP with us in lowsec. We're about all skill ranges and experience as long as people are having fun.
---
Jesus finally a breath of fresh air among those endless "new player here, this game is so great, i played a whole 10 minutes"...
---
&gt;So have any of you guys overcome this problem? What do you suggest? I wanna love this game but it's kinda hard in my current situation
---
Just stop playing, don't get addicted to this endless void that consumes everything while providing nothing in return, just let it go and find something else to do, there is plenty of other games to play...
---
Have you considered getting good?
---
I agree 100%. But you can’t do them while watching Netflix
---
Dunno, i mean Horde has a whole program to help new players with handouts, people to guide them, loads of info on allllll the things you can do in EVE and loads of regular fun fleets/roams and similar. I have been really impressed since I joined, had more fun in the last few months than I had in the last few years doing small corp stuff.
---
oh you and your facts, r/Eve does not take kindly to people who state the truth when it hurts their itty witty bitty pretty game...
---
I'm not ready to give up yet, I've decided I'm going to possibly change my living situation, but I'm definitely going to try something different. If that doesn't work I'm probably just getting burnt out.
---
Wait I thought this was a thread about why people hate wormholers, not the standard practices of nullseccers?
---
You watch dscan and the anom windows for new stuff instead. Podcasts and audiobooks are the way to go.
---
Is that near Stain?
---
The real question is.. has Hilmar sold his shares yet?
---
Well I warned you, remember that when you end up in the ditch that Eve is going to leave you in...
---
Just trying to stay positive :)
---
Yup. But local is perfect intel
---
Soon you will forget what that word even exists... soon you will be one of the many lost souls here... I gave you a chance to turn back, you chose this path, remember it until the end of your days!
---
Hey Sweaty!
---
Dont give up! I passed through many shit in the begining and i am still here! (PLEASE HELP ME I CANT LIVE THIS GAME, IT FUCKED MY WHOLE LIFE FOR 6 YEARS ALREADY, HELP, I CANT QUIT)
---
Its good
---
Typical eve player:
---
In one of those 2 days that they leave their basement, they see a lot of EVE stuff in "real life".
---
=P
---
Thank you Squizz!
---
As it sounds very clear, you had a great tool for SP farmers like me.
---
Thank you again for your service towards eve and comunity! o7
---
Tower defense in space
---
You still have to be targeting sleepers and pressing f1.
---
I had more than 8 or 9 bits in alts there i think lol
---
awesome
---
You're at the point where solo PVP is only viable if you know who to hunt and where to play, also called meta-gaming. While I agree that there are issues with the game preventing you from fully enjoying it, if you don't have enough experience to know where to get fights it's your own problem
---
You want to have an impact on the world? That sounds like every Millenial ever during a job interview.
---
It would be more foolish to launch a sequel in my opinion. Unless they were to just make a big update to original game that DOESN'T affect my assets.
---
The new Trig hs sites are, I hear, extremely low effort and about 100m/hour.
---
My suggestions are scamming and contract flipping.
---
If you can find me a 50m ehp super carrier that still makes sense to risk to rat with hmu I'm interested.
---
Recon change effectively gave us a way to circumvent cyno inhibs if you aren't sold brain.
---
All of which happened over 3 years ago. The past 2 years have just reduced it repeatedly.
---
I never said you did. Your group is more the people who were for the blackout. You know the rhetoric that was thrown around. And fk the NS people who have said it as well, all players are needed.
---
I have never said anything different than that. My position on the matter has been rather clear from the very beginning. If properly implemented sure it will work and it might even be enjoyable for all. But this was not it. My problem wasnt with the idea of a delayed local, it was always with the approach. I knew this  would result in an exodus which is why I was very hostile towards it.
---
Everything works if properly executed but the devil is in the details. The simple approach of just turning of local was never gonna bring about anything other than players leaving. My issue will always be that I dont want players leaving, any action that will bring us that will always be argued against by me.
---
get on horde discord
---
look for a pvp fleet to form. join fleet.
---
0 900mil8 8 uouo
---
For the longest time they were unique, if you wanted the Eve like experience it was CCP or go play some other genre, with the end of them being unique comes a willingness of a larger number of people to stop ignoring their faults and expect more of a company that has been running the game for a decade and a half and they just aren't capable of it any longer having driven off/fired most of the people that lead to the original success that made eve popular.
---
Give advice rather than just reinforce he has a prob?
---
I was just making a comment on the sheer amount of SP needed for general core skills that aren't gun or ship specific.  I wish CCP scaled down the number of core skills TBH.
---
Are you actually claiming that the changes over the past two years have reduced super / capital pve to below the level of subcap pve?
---
None of the ‘reductions’ have changed the reality that null sec is a massive / safe ISK faucet that is increasing as more and more people adapt the umbrella model. The entire point of the op.
---
I am claiming the past two years have made it harder to make isk than over 2 years ago. There has been nothing in the past 2 years that made it easier. Those are facts, it's not an opinion.
---
Yes, I'm intrigued as well.
---
\#WagonWheel
---
Sure, but theyre not here right now are they?
---
Listen dude, Im not sitting here defending CCPs past actions. I have hated the Rorq for a very very long time. If only they had never implemented it. The game would have been in such a better place. And I am still very much against the Rorq in its present state even though its not as detrimental anymore. I dislike the fact that everything became capitals online even though I love capitals. Im even okey with us removing all of them from the game requiring that they need new mats so that the server can catch a break. 
---
But it needs to be done properly. Most will accept it if its balanced and not just 2 lines of code.
---
Or they could perhaps realise they can make more money if they just actually give people what they want? Like its not unheard of for a company to actually give their customers what they want right?
---
I dont know the real numbers so Im not gonna argue for or against. But I dont think PA bought them to just scrap them.
---
From what I gather, there is no other MMO like Eve, especially considering it high playerage so one cant really argue anything based on other games. Eve is unique and it requires unique solutions.
---
The new Eve needs work. The foundations has been built, now you need the walls and the roof. But tearing up the foundation in order to attract players that left isnt a good approach imo.
---
It was never possible. The main assumption is that people left simply because of changed mechanics. I dont believe that to be the case. I simply believe people grew older, the world changed and the gaming industry got more diverse. People have more choices today than they did 4 years ago, and also less. People have more responsibilites, some perhaps arent even playing any games anymore. 
---
Why people leave isnt as straightforward as some have said. Which means that the gamble to bring back old players will not work imo, its just gonna kill off the only customers left.
---
You have to be at the keyboard for drone ratting because rats don’t always redbox the ratter. Half the rats in 2 of the waves just yellowbox the ratter and the drones don’t engage.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Depends where you live. In Geminate I never had a problem with rats not redboxing me. In Serpentis space they almost never redboxed.
---
Circa Three Years Ago ...
---
CCP institutes numerous game changes that makes Null a massive ISK faucet.
---
Over Last Two Years ...
---
CCP slightly  reduces Null ISK faucet while more and more players (and their alts) jump on the ISK train in Null. This greatly increases the total wealth / reduces build costs.
---
Fofalus ...
---
CCP IS REDUCING MY ABILITY TO MAKE ISK. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I remember guristas space being easymode compared to blood raiders and serpentis. They are way more consistent on player aggro.
---
The release date has been iterated on
---
o7 from next door
---
Depends on where u live and what you do. For 500 plex i have to do 10 hours of overtime.
---
Anyone know of a fun PVP / PVE Corp near Jita (or Lowsec beer Jita) that actually has fleets running past 3:30 eve time?   I’m in the USA west coast, my current Corp has hundreds but shit all happens past 3:00 Eve time... kind of a bummer
---
You must reactivate your weapons for each new target. Select multiple targets at a time (Hold CTRL and click on targets in your overview or hold CTRL and click and drag in space) that way when your weapons stop firing, you have your next target already locked. Saves quite a bit of time. Also, learning the keyboard shortcuts for things is very helpful. Check your game settings to see what keys do what.
---
This is a lie.
---
Very Simon Stålenhag-esque.
---
When I saw the post I was not expecting this!! Whoa, this could be an actual official artwork sold by CCP. They need to subcontract you out for their products and merchandise division.
---
Have you tried to go out hunting with a friend?
---
Or NPSI groups?
---
I think somebody might have seen that coming 2 years ago (certainly not the devs).
---
Btw, you don't want your titan orange tethered like that.
---
You don't have ez mode cyno now. :(
---
No, if someone says the isk making has been buffed for the past 2 years and we can both see ccp has been nerfing it for the past 2 years, I am going to call someone out as being wrong.
---
It wouldn't work.
---
Because of the fact there isn't actually a real economy as far as currency is concerned. It comes from nowhere and disappears to nowhere.
---
Why? You aren't paying the subscription.
---
Have you looked into the SIGs (Special Interest Groups) that your alliance and/or corp has?  I'm in one of the larger alliances myself, and I much prefer the smaller and more surgical ops that these sub-groups run, to the massive tidi-fests.
---
The point that has been proven time and time again is that the ISK making IS going up as more and more people (and their alts) jump on the isk train.
---
Arguing against that is silly and wrong.
---
T5 abyssal sites in a gila
---
v0lta is trash.
---
I've trained past the point of alpha - I'd definitely have to sub to get my full skills back.
---
It's a shame there aren't private servers out there.
---
OK, thanks!
---
What's a high class wormhole?
---
Well, what's wrong with that?
---
I haven't hunted with anyone personally (kinda hard to make friends in a megacorp), and what are NPSI groups?
---
If all your loot is T1 I would just skip it and get a new ship and try again. By the time you invest in getting another smaller, faster ship with MTU and flying back and forth. It wouldn’t be worth the isk per hour.
---
Not widely reported that before the sale he spammed texts to PA executives telling them he would double their money.
---
Reward has not increased, even your made up numbers to describe the situation show the reward decreasing. Nothing has been done to increase the reward a player gets for mining or rating in nullsec. I have provided proof of ccp decreasing the effective reward and you just keep saying but no the reward has increased. Show me where something has increased what a player gets.
---
People management is much simpler in your format, as is the way you represent information without using the tool, scaling things up would show the problems in production values caused by this. 
---
A smaller format also lowers the viability of a lot of comps and reduces the ability of comeback wins, as well as decreasing the general complexity, which is what a lot of viewers are interested by in the first place. 
---
I respect what you do with what you have, but it's not even close to an AT replacement.
---
How many people in the world end up making world changing impacts? Now, if the rest of the people (99.9%) that don't.. set that as their ultimate goal, it becomes something of an impossible goal. People should set realistic and obtainable goals and scale from there with each achievement. It brings far more happiness and self fulfilment.
---
When you mention getting in a new ship and then dying getting into a ship and actually having the correct skills trained well is different I would aim for t4 in the ship and weapons at least before trying it if you already haven’t.
---
This game has a lot
---
If niches which people like to do some love exploring some love pvp etc it’s just finding the right thing to do.
---
Small gang pvp is a lot of fun and solo can be ok but these days most of the time you will be blobbed the second you appear on intel.
---
Try different things find what you enjoy and do that.
---
My skills for the ship are usually at least lvl 3 before I take it out, but I meant more skill wise to use it. I see your point tho
---
Apparently The Rogue Consortium is at war with CVA, but when I asked CVA about it their response was “who?”.
---
Pretty much. It makes me sad.
---
Period Basis is nothing but Chinese bots. Skill injectors and PLEX are going back up again (no surprise) because the same people are back to grinding for ISK to RMT.
---
haha lol he did the meme xd
---
It has taken away some of the excitement thats for sure.
---
In this particular case, the CSM objected to CCP using *Most Time* as a way of measuring where someone where someone 'lived'. And they're right. It has problems. There are edge cases that will mis-classify a player as something they are not. A large part of the problem is that we can't measure player intentions. e.g. Running missions in High-sec to fund your Null-Sec roaming.
---
Aryth suggested that we ignore Jita when using the *Most Time* segmentation, and that idea has merit.
---
Ultimately, we don't use a single method to assign you as a player to a single security band. We use many methods such as: most time; any time; aggregate character minutes; ISK earnt; ISK lost; etc. to try and build up a comprehensive picture.
---
June 2019 (monthly mean of daily pct):
---
 Location  | Most Time | Any Time
---
:--           | :--:      | :--:
---
**High-Sec**  | ~59%      | ~77%
---
**Low-Sec**   | ~5%       | ~21%
---
**Null-Sec**  | ~29%      | ~36%
---
**Wormholes** | ~5%       | ~11%
---
* *Most Time* : The player spent the majority of their non-afk time in that area of space, across all their characters and accounts.
---
* *Any Time* : Players that spent any time at all in that area of space, across all of their characters and accounts.
---
*Final Note*: I'm well aware those percentages don't add up to 100%. I've carelessly dropped decimal places, and excluded some locations (such as Abyssal space). Also *Any Time* should by definition be more than 100%!
---
 Ships are getting blown up.
---
NPSI is Not Purple Shoot It.
---
Basically people from a bunch of different corps and entities just come together to pvp. Shoot anyone who isn't in fleet.
---
Like Spectre Fleet or Bombers Bar.
---
So... you want the Blackout back? Cus I can totally get behind that. =)
---
The problem is not "there are cloaky ships (AFK or not) in my system".
---
The problem is "you know for a fact that there are cloaky ships in your system".
---
There should not be 100% guaranteed sources of intel like that. There should not be an automatic method of telling ratters or miners that a stranger has entered their territory. Especially when those methods have been proven to lead to Bots which will immediately trigger a warp back to base the instant a stranger enters Local.
---
1. Stop lying.
---
.
---
2. My stance has never changed. What the average player in Null Sec IS earning is going up as each player (and their alts) continues to utilize the umbrella mechanics.
---
3. Your refusal to respond to the actual argument is breathtaking. Keep spinning Mittens.
---
Oh ok I haven't heard the acronym, I was thinking about doing some bombers bar stuff but haven't really tried pursuing it. Might give it a go.
---
This is something new. Used to be that crowded ppl in a system complain about afk cloaky camping. I guess its not good times if the actual campers are starting to complain about their point of view. I agree they should undock and die like cattle in a slaughterhouse to you blops alt.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
nice
---
Hey bud. Bobby tried to come back to eve for a few months but decided rl was more fun and has been winning eve for several years now. As for how sm3ll became sm3ll yea we merged a few of the more pvp focused corps to try and make the best of a bad situation when atlas fell apart. There was a pretty big divide between the pvp and industry guys that I am sure is written about somewhere but it sure was fun while it lasted. 
---
As for this move from NC to Horde sm3ll, like most corps, is trying to find the fun again in a game that is slowly circling the drain and I hope they find what they need. I stopped playing for the most part about a year ago but still check in from time to time. Mercie1 is the CEO now and is doing a damn fine job. 
---
Happy to answer any other questions while watching this Alabama v Old Miss game....Roll Tide!
---
yeah thats the idea... it will encourage more content which is good for all sides.
---
What am I looking at
---
hehe
---
Any specifics you can tell about?
---
It is. I smoked a j here two years ago
---
But this is bad.           
---
I am nullsec player, i have prepositioned characters in multiple places, most of my chars are in nullsec but my most active characters will be in higsec, and around higsec.         
---
I look for targets, monitor movement what and where people move stuff - especially those i consider hostile alts.           
---
When i am bored i take some trashers and move around and pod people in higsec, especially when i see some 10 year chars autopiloting in pod.            
---
How you can even consider me a higsec players.
---
Thanks homie! Wish I was still making people proud but had to try out rl for a while. Xoxo
---
Miss you too bud. Hope all is well.
---
Sure, as long as fitting a cloak also disables fitting a cyno so any fight is strictly between you and the ratter and not you and 40 people on a blops.
---
well think about it this way... if you dont know if there is a cloaky neut in system then it will encourage people to do more hybrid pvp/pve fits which is a martha stewart good thing.
---
Maybe think about more interactive ways to engage in combat with ppl. Not just sitting cloaked for hours for a vni kill/.
---
You must be in a dead alliance
---
Its stunning, very nice.
---
Join Legacy and Goonswarm. Make ISK with impunity. Quit the game because you're bored.
---
Bot
---
okay just make it so an active cyno shuts down all locks while cyno is active... that way if the ship does light a cyno they loose the point and it gives you a chance to warp out.
---
Pretty big problem since FAX can tank between 2-3 times as hard as triage carriers both active and passive fit due to capital cap injectors.
---
goddammit ron stop being so likeable!!! now i wanna hugg you like a big old teddybear
---
Just like a real corporate meeting! Did you waste most of the time explaining basic shit to powerful people that do literally nothing but show up confused periodically??
---
No, 100% unable to fit cyno
---
I sometimes play eve while I'm on the toilet from my laptop but that doesn't mean I'm a wormholer
---
Eve has the most engaging gameplay.
---
&gt; 2 WH corps that dont like eachother
---
All wormholers hate each other and are constantly trying to kill one another.
---
Wormholer btw
---
Glad I'm doing my part.  Used real money to sub 4 accounts havnt logged in since the chaos shit started.
---
I'm losing that war too.
---
Because they are playing the game EVE was supposed to be. From Hillmar AMA:
---
&gt; I think wormholes are as close to the origins of EVE as can be. Frankly a  big part of EVE back in the day was about 3rd party tools to cope with  the cruelty of EVE. I am not sure I would want to change that but often  we have coopeted features from 3rd party tool into the core experience  but that´s not a big priority right now.   wormholer BTW 
---
Also whers are universally hated in nullsec because they usually use hit'n run tactics, fly kitey shit because mass constrains, retarded capital application to subcaps and general non trig battleship uslessness. Basically just a bunch of dirty savages disrupting glorious automated resource gathering activities of entitled nullseccers. An annoying bump on smooth road to Serenity.
---
83 systems.  Congrats!
---
CPU's only used as a plural is incorrect, and that's a fact. Could you name some of these grammatical authorities please just so we're on the same page?
---
Put it in the suggestion thread with all the other terrible ideas please. Ty.
---
Use bots. CCP doesn't really care
---
They nerfed wardecs so everyone doing them basically had to consolidate into 1 alliance and pool their resources in order to keep doing them.
---
&gt; after 15 minutes when a person cloaks up in a system, they would no longer register in local
---
Granted.
---
Minor addition: only in high sec.
---
inb4 cyno poem
---
Impossible goals only serve to allow someone to say "well, I tried my best" when they failed. It's the same mentality that makes participation trophies a thing.
---
So you'd fall into the 36% any time?
---
My 22m SP pilot has been parked for like 8 years lol. I still have the urge to play a lot though
---
But i also fall into the WH Lowsec or Higsec constantly for the same reason.            
---
You need to travel you need to do various stuff but i am not a higsec, lowsec or a WH player.  
---
If a Wh spawns in area i check it and where it leads.            
---
I need to loging lowsec cyno chars to move JF.     
---
But in the end i don't play in WH or in lowsec.      
---
I hunt in higsec but i often try to target enemy alts.       
---
Like killing the 20bil NC alt or forcing enemy JF to jump back to hit enemy logistics.
---
Your graphs show a decrease of 2 trillion isk in production because of the blackout. 
---
You'd rather have no blackout so delve can go back to full production? 
---
I'll take the slowdown any day.
---
In fact, these graphs show we should make rorq mining even more difficult on top of not having local.
---
tbh i cant game now like I did in 2006. game's veteran population is getting older while the niche of it is failing to retain fresh blood.
---
Damn i seen your freighter so many times, scanned it also.      
---
Over the time you had only like once enough to kill you ... but on the lower band and mostly you make nice tools  so people ignored you :D       
---
Like you are constantly hauling so little that why are you even using the freighter.
---
r/monkeyspaw
---
Another newish player here (I've been playing solo though).
---
Fit up an astero and be a wormholer btw. You can go either pure explo or gank frigs or both if you don't mind carrying a refit and a mobile depot in your cargo (don't use a mixed fit, they're the worst of both worlds I've found.). If you have the money, SP, and balls, do the same thing but with a stratios. 
---
If you want to focus more on actual pvp instead of cloaky bs, there's a bunch of NPSI fleets that form up regularly and a few that focus on small gang stuff. That'd probably be your best bet short of joining a dedicated small gang corp (which are likely going to be wormholers btw, but that's just the nature of things, null is mostly for blobs and n+1 F1 fests).
---
alright thanks you
---
That is like asking "why does stainguy shitpost so much". Honestly, why do you shitpost much?
---
Visual glitch that the Keepstar still has it tethered.
---
Bud you register as a WH when a WH spawns in your system and you check what is inside and if any connections inside are nice and lead to some populated nullsec.           
---
If you run a cyno chain to lowsec then you are lowsec player ...
---
Eve wasn’t designed as a 4 player game, and what would be the point of that anyway?
---
We stan the NCMA!
---
Praise James!
---
It really can't be overstated, being in the right group is what will keep you in Eve... If you're immediate move after logging in isn't to get in comms and ask what's going on then you're in the wrong group. 
---
That's often hard in a really big corp, but SIGs help, or even just try to find the dudes who are doing the kind of things you wanna do in your TZ and set up a WhatsApp group so you can ping for dudes when interesting things are going on... 
---
Don’t be afraid to keep doing solo shit even if it doesn’t always work out... cheap battlecruisers like the Myrm, Cyclone or Prophecy work well cause if you get mobbed, you’ll live long enough to get one or two kills maybe...
---
If I was playing eve on my laptop from a public toilet then I'd be a lowsec player.
---
They're drinking Beer. Good old eve boys. Nothing important happens in eve without a beer.
---
Monocle and tophat requirements or it ejects you out.
---
The ring isn't tether distance. It's dock.
---
Tether extends 10km past that 
---
This picture is not necessary visual bug, but an application of the tether bug due to warping
---
Then why dis the wormhole CSM say it ??
---
Try making a base in FW space. Keep a JC and some pre-fit faction frigs. When things are boring in your null sec coalition of choice, JC over and do some solo pvp in fac war
---
Didn't need Plex to have bots.
---
Sell isk online
---
They are all mittani alts anyway
---
Can I share items and resources with other characters within my account?
---
My main character is Caldari, but I want to create an alt for hauling since other nations have better haulers. If I create a Gallente alt, can this alt access the resources of my main character?
---
The Want Ads
---
Where is here?
---
Hilariously enough the bot owners made sure to keep their esis all up to date to avoid purging
---
Here too please!
---
They arent close enough for that, no way to do that, its just a visual bug that happens sometimes
---
join goons lmao you can pm me
---
You can trade, contact, and deliver items to other characters.
---
You can also just train gallente industrial on your caldari character
---
Gotta have the isk first to sell the isk. I'm trying to tell you it wasn't a widespread problem everyone did. It was a few people . Wasn't like now.
---
I just don’t care when someone is afk cloaking in my local. I fly stuff with scrams and neuts and live a “wish a motherfucker would” lifestyle.
---
Tackle me at your own peril.
---
Jeez do you work in a sweatshop? Sorry if that is offensive but £1.80 (equivalent) an hour is criminal
---
More people already do.
---
...yes...the botting provided the isk to sell.
---
I have more than one freighter. and they're not all in corp ;)
---
And, generally, volume.
---
More structures = more pilots docked = more taverntime
---
Counterpoint: WH overlords coward agreements
---
We all miss those days. I remember when you could roam through high sec looking for Exhumers to gank and actually seeing a bunch. Now, it’s all three week old *REAL PLAYERS* in groups of 4 or more with Orcas using Mining Drone II’s. 
---
Try having a Hulkageddon now. It’s slim pickings out here :c
---
I enjoy the recent news.
---
sounds like eve is finally dead, unless you call being left in a vegetative state alive...
---
Good guys win again
---
Lol no one I know before Plex was paying 14.95 to run a botting farm. We didn't have those kind of shit tier playerbase then. Now maybe yeah it's an epidemic. Because you can Plex it. Pay for 30 rorqs a month cash. See how you feel about it
---
 😆
---
honestly ccp fucked up the balance of the isk flow for so long people don't really pve any more unless they're retarded
---
Mind sharing your Astero fits? I’ve been looking around for some WH hunter/explo fits these last couple days.
---
Wumaos spotted
---
because it was in context of the null blackout at the time. 
---
yes wormholes are safer than null without local.
---
The point is going full afk. Terrible isk/hr but you have an almost 0% chance of getting ganked, and you can basically perma-tank the rats
---
At what range should you be using the long range sentry drones and are they considered better than heavy drones for ratting?
---
The epic Astero killmail.

fuck, i must be autistic af
---
Not the way it was worded in the minutes.
---
Join whs my dude. Best place to play the game I promise
---
What use is panic if people are afk or botting. If they are afk then they won't hit panic and die, if they are botting then they'll come out of panic and still die. Unless you are suggesting that bots are now coordinating response fleets to come and save them which would be pretty impressive.
---
Wormholes are fine though because they are next level dangerous because reddit said so
---
PANIC module for bombers pls
---
This just also came on the discord we are using with bunch of friends.             
---
Quite probably most of them are now registering as a higsec players as big part of them made a chars to run the most broken PVE we have currently ... abyssals ... and to do it in higsec.          
---
Like the only reason is that they do it in higsec is because **it is 100% safe to do it in higsec** like you just need to be away from jita and no one will ever bother you.
---
There's a dude who has been in querious a while named Femalo-something (can't spell it). He got his alliance evicted by goons from QFC. NSH dropped by to fuck up querious and since FeM is a long time friend of mine, I recruited him to help us fuck shit up. When NSH left, FeM stayed behind and with like 5 alts and some other people has been killing all QFC in querious. It's pretty fucking funny. 2-3 guys killing querious.
---
What would paying $14.95 matter if you were selling the isk it made that month for $50?
---
I mean, you know someone is in system.  When it's working.  Maybe.
---
&gt; i don't consider myself as a higsec player.
---
Thats the crux of the problem. Disappointingly, the data won't show what you *consider yourself* (aka your intentions). Thats firmly in the realm of player surveys (which have a different set of problems).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
It may help to know that, while for some days certainly you'll be classified as a High-Sec player (as did Aryth, Merk and Innominate), on many other days you'll be classified as a Null-Sec player (as did Aryth, Merk and Innominate).
---
Given your description of your unconventional play-style, I'm not sure what methodology would correctly identify you. Which is why we use a wide range of methods.
---
Lastly, those two particular metrics aren't very useful on their own, however interesting. Population numbers alone don't give any indication of the underlying ecosystem.
---
PANIC modules are totally fine. What isn't fine is that you can easily scale up to 10+ alts into rorquals because mining is so passive.
---
it's not too hard to get that from the data he's basing it on ( isk generated vs ships destroyed ), something that at the time of the CSM meeting wormhole space was massively spiking in, now it could be ExookiZ still believes that right now wormhole space is safe I'm highly skeptical of that personally, now I'm all for ratting nerfs in wormhole space because I'm back to making my money in null anyway mostly because it's a lot easier and safer.
---
enable all brackets.
---
Honestly, I don't think null is a good place for most brand new players, just because of the culture of most of the groups there. I'd suggest finding a smaller group of players (&lt;=30) in another area of space; lowsec, C1 or C2 wormhole, or even a highsec corp that organizes roams into low/null/wh. There's a lot of fun to be had if you find the right people!
---
Like i told you "enemy alts" you are not part of enemy nullsec group.        
---
TBH this is mostly why i am quite annoyed about bumping changes as i could locate a NC or PL guy hauling on alt a lot of PVP related stuff and 'call for nice people to kill him'.        
---
This is gone now.       
---
Same for JF bumping, you cannot now disturb enemy logistics.         
---
Like honestly WHY CCP removed this from the gameplay?      
---
Bumping an empty JF moving back was **the only way to do it** now it is gone.
---
How do you fit your rorquals properly?
---
Why should it not go unnoticed?
---
10+ Rorquals isn't all that common.
---
Interesting OP. I can see what your saying but I don't see it as a competition. The person is spending all this time in game krabbing away to support an alt habit. One that has either isk or real money upkeep costs as well as time costs. These folks are always going to brag about their best case scenario to excuse an unhealthy lifestyle.
---
Let them, enjoy life.
---
Because it shows up a lot of informations.       
---
Many of those informations were argued on r/eve.
---
I wish a cloaking device blew up a ship it was equipped to after more than 10 minutes of cloak.
---
Wormhole income is fine if it's actually 4-5 people doing sites but in reality it's people multi-boxing 4-5 accounts and it's broken af. Just collapse all the none statics, and leave a scout on the desired static and you are almost entirely safe. Sure but if someone does this or that, they can kill you. But again in real world that's gonna be combined effort of 10-20 accounts that could make billions themselves with the time/effort they put in only for a chance to kill your Nestors worth maybe 5 billions at most that you can krab back in a blink of an eye. Wormholer always say if wormhole is so great why don't you come. First they don't actually want a mass migration into their precious krab holes, they say that cause they knew you either do not have 4-5 accounts with proper skills or do not willing to multi-box 4-5 accounts.
---
When did I ever suggest Rorquals are not the problem? Rorqual are a far larger problem than Blackout because they are high yield and extremely survivable in blackout conditions whereas regular mining ships are free kills for blops gangs. If CCP really wanted to clamp down on mineral flow they should have gone after the multi-box capability of rorquals rather than blackout, which fucks barge/exhumers far more than Rorquals.
---
Powers you don't rat or mine, you make all your money from reactions.
---
Delete excavator drones more like! And boom now it's back to 30 hulks in belts, out come doesn't change just the tactics!!
---
Joking aside tho, ccp really did royally fuck up rorq rebalance, it's supposed to be a mining support vessel and that fuck can mine more than mining ships, it's retarded
---
Does /u/stainguy get removed as well?
---
It will have an automatic doomsday that fires every 2 minutes, chaining through anyone within 1000km of the structure with a criminal timer or -10.0 status
---
I'm running a bit more tanky than ganky because I like the extra margin of error and explo frigs still pop easily without maximizing DPS. You can downgrade stuff depending on skills/ISK but I wouldn't recommend it (though subbing in T1 rigs will drop the price by about 20M for not that much loss of tank. If you have to cut corners, do it there first).

---
Please brake it down for a bit more special folks
---
You need this data as company as this is pretty important to see where players are active.                  
---
We have account management page, all our accounts are linked by email.      
---
**Please give us ability to fill a "short survey" there that we can adjust over the time**       
---
I will fill you what kind of gameplay i am interested, what area is my primary focus or what i want CCP to focus on at this moment (solving an issue or expanding some gameplay).         
---
This don't have to be free fields.            
---
Because it is email based you can easily motivate players to fill this kind of survey when you want.         
---
For example :            
---
You send a notification to all player mail boxes(ingame) and state that this only apply once per player and all people that fill this information get (one of the items) :             
---
* a skin    
---
* a gnosis       
---
* a cerebral accelerator       
---
* a 50k SP pack             
---
^(but mostly a much healthier game)          
---
In a redeeming system directly or they get a key on their email when they fill this survey.          
---
This way you will know how many people consider themself higsecers, nullsecers, wormholers or lowsecers.
---
dude fuck ur f1 pushing yeaah?
---
How about breaking down players by kill/loss distribution. I know that CCP has that data available since it's part of the MER and CCP knows which accounts belong to the same real life person.
---
Break down a person's combined kill/loss ratio by space type, assign the most "active" character for a real person as the "main", and assign them space usage things that way.
---
Alternatively/additionally you could also do the same for industrial output.
---
#lalalalallala all bots/we don't need krabs
---
(Or some other stupid statement)
---
&gt;reeeee unsubbing all 10 accounts
---
Where have I heard this one before?
---
How do you not know they are there? I know this is a lore type question, but if they are connected to the same Concord sever that does stuff like provide a client list, map data, gate activation, communication, etc. Why would a module take them off the client list? Now if they were blacked out from all that shit by "going dark" so be it. Just have it where the normal weapons timer is required to have the ship systems reconnect to the fluid routers. Nothing is possible, not even having your clone data update after death. Maybe perma-death as Concord has no idea you died while dark, to know to even activate an old clone data state.
---
I haven't played in a bit so I might be a bit out of date, but what helped me get comfortable with losing ships and getting destroyed was buying 20 fully kitted low cost Tristan builds. It ended up not being too expensive.      
---
    
---
Then I made a day out of trying to get all 20 destroyed as quickly as possible. Turns out you learn fairly quickly when you are dropping ships like flies.
---
Gaming is different now than it was in 2006 though.
---
Well clearly quite a few times as tens of thousands of players left the game.
---
But they were all bots.
---
I know this because idiots told me.
---
Are you saying E50M is disgustingly good or disgustingly shit?
---
&gt; Please give us ability to fill a "short survey" there that we can adjust over the time
---
Much like the CSM voting, this will be manipulated and abused by the largest organized groups (the few specific megacoalitions) to present just whatever suits them best and drown out everything else with their many alts.
---
Yes. I am not. But I previously paid to gain those skills. In my view, I essentially purchased those skills, and it doesnt seem fair to be required to pay to use something I've already purchased.
---
Cheers thanks mate.
---
Wouldn’t a disruptor make more sense instead of the web tho? You’re already fast af with that mwd.
---
Also, how do you fit for sites?
---
Appreciate it. :)
---
The reddit gods think that this post is too steamy
---
Except you didn't purchase those skills, regardless of what happened in your mind.
---
You seem to just not ha e understood the transaction you took part in.
---
And needs to be REE-trained
---
Remove Rorqual drone mining bonus, give Rorqual Industrial Jump Portal Generator.
---
AT was what i would call "barely a competitive" tournament. Isk needs, High Buy in, the inability for viewers to build specific relationships with teams/players over the corp/alliance identity. Also not splitting from those entities doesn't allow for complex team building/drafting.
---
Also, what i do can be scaled up to 5v5's without too much trouble. Any larger and you have a problem with promoting specific players/teams. As well as building those relationships.
---
Also managing people is managing people, it had litterally nothing to do with AT tools.
---
I never claimed to be a replacement for AT, I claimed that i run a tournament without CCP's tools, and without much help from them.
---
Btw this is not an unconventional gampeplay style.       
---
Like i have channel when our group meets.       
---
Currently it is 83 people including me - there are others groups like this one.             
---
EvE gameplay focused on gathering various information sounds strange, but it is a fun gameplay ... for some people.           
---
Like can we please removed tether from structures as i cannot see what people are moving in lowsec in JF any more.            
---
Can we get unfocused (aka burst) cargo scanner module that scans only capital sized industrials - sometimes it is hard to scan all the ships on station undock.       
---
Can we get cargo scanner/passive targetter look like. Like if you have one active and cycling all stuff you lock don't know you did it.             
---
Those are niche gameplayes but they have huge impact on the game. I PMed CCP Convict partial effect of this data gathering - but simply to say, monitoring higsec routes let you see not only what enemy will bring to grid, but also how their supers and titans are fitted and by running locators on some chars - where they will deploy before stuff will be even announced to higher ranking members.
---
If you were to say this during blackout you would have been crucified.  But it was evident even before that.  PA taking over was like a stage 5 ass cancer diagnosis...this game is just going to shit out all that keeps it healthy and tumors of malcontent will spread.
---
Here's mine
---
https://imgur.com/a/Gyasb3w
---
So the take away is that most players spend time in high sec followed by null
---
N-NANI? Multi-structure tether?
---
It is according to the narrative.
---
Just like everybody has 3 supers and a titan. And also multiboxes 15 Rorqs. And injected into all of them
---
What a pointless comment
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
&gt; Break down a person's combined kill/loss ratio by space type, assign the most "active" character for a real person as the "main", and assign them space usage things that way.
---
What about players who don't lose or kill (they exist! think null-sec industrialists), but then lose a random ship in WH space or to a high-sec gank. Are they now Wormholers or High-Secers?
---
&gt; Alternatively/additionally you could also do the same for industrial output.
---
What about players who have an industrial alt in High-Sec while considering themselves Null-Sec PvPers?
---
All good ideas, but all with edge cases :). We generally don't look at a single classification method but instead try to get a comprehensive picture to answer whatever question we're asking.
---
The Blackout is over gate is green!
---
#cloaked cowardice doesn't need a buff.
---
This don't have to be the only data source, but if you are part of the megacoalitions then you are a nullsec player.     
---
If you don't want to fill it this way you will not do it.         
---
This information is also easily verified :             
---
* like many accounts using the same email (and you need to fill this only on one of the accounts).                     
---
* checking if this account is active ... so in the main analysys exclude accounts that are not active or are obvious alts (if 50 responses came from same IP or accounts are accessed by the same ip ... )   
---
CCP need to know this stuff as CCP actions need to address issues for majority of players if game is to be healthy.           
---
TBH most of nullsec players will tell you that structure spam is an issue and rorquals are huge issue.              
---
But honestly a system that can qualify me as a higsec players is bad. Not even mentioning the fact it can show me as lowsec or WH player.
---
&gt;There should not be 100% guaranteed sources of intel like that.
---
Finally, someone else who's against being able to see how many people are ratting or mining in a system before you enter it.
---
That's 100% guaranteed intel too.
---
Or is that the good kind of guaranteed intel?
---
/r/evejobs
---
My favourite part about your last few posts is that you've basically outted yourself as a highsec wardeccer who's only really interested in buffing that.
---
If you've been following summit minutes for a while this isn't new information either. There was mentions of it in the 2016 and 2017 summit notes. I've been having this conversation on and off with people for years.
---
This.
---
Cloaked cowardice is the most risk averse playstyle it is. They can fuck off as far as I'm concerned.
---
In June, only 36% of players spent any time in Nullsec.
---
That's players, not characters. (CCP have been working on how to join them together. They're reasonably confident of it now)
---
Or even better.      
---
Give me ability to choose this on the launcher - big slider on top where i can select area of my gameplay - and each time someone login on some char you can have also this information sent to you.         
---
Character logging in in higsec/lowsec or WH ... but player consider himself a nullsecer.
---
It's called "roaming" for a reason. You hop around mashing Dscan until you find something to shoot at. If you find a bunch of Rorqs jerking themselves off in a belt while their outrageously expensive drones rake in pure money for them, then you engage and remind them that Null Sec is supposed to be dangerous space. "Risk vs reward" as they say. All that profit, means you may end up dead.
---
I already said why. Gas and T3s are cheap enough as it is.
---
&gt; You need this data as company as this is pretty important to see where players are active.
---
Ahh but your conflating two different concepts. We can see exactly where players are active. The data clearly shows that.
---
What the data doesn't show is what location motivates (aka considers themselves / aka intentions) them.
---
We do send out surveys :) I don't know as much about that process as I do the empirical data side of things, but I know we ask those sorts of questions.
---
No, it still works
---
I mean there is someone cloaked on the other side of the gate waiting
---
Which part is lying?
---
The average player has to expend more effort as ccp continues to nerf it over the past 2 years. If we compare today to exactly 2 years ago making isk was eaiser based on all the changes made.
---
Check me profile on EU, Ew_ is the nickname. Decide for yourself :)
---
It may be lower effort, but it is not safer. The return is much higher in a wormhole. Especially with an Astrahaus.
---
&gt;It's called "roaming" for a reason
---
Roaming implies you have to actually search for things tho
---
I declared only once a higsec war on an altcorp to kill a target of opportunity.           
---
Like 2 years ago.   
---
I am totally not interested in higsec wardecs, but i will gladly come and kill WAR HQ for the biggest wardecer group in higsec because they are abusing new player groups and with proper timing they are counter playing the base idea behind War HQ.
---
&lt;3
---
Nobody is going to evict Goons from Delve. We’re pretty motivated to keep our space. You’d have to grind through a Keepstar in every system and fend off a literal blob of supercapitals. 
---
Even if every other major power dived in on this, people would get bored of structure bashing before you got close to 1-DQ.
---
Well true, like no one was expecting something different.          
---
But we don't know if those are alts or mains.             
---
If a guy is running abyssals or burners in higsec on alt to make ISK  for nullsec PVP is he a higsec player?    
---
I don't know, CCP data will not show this either.             
---
**But adding a slider on launcher** letting know CCP that player consider himself a higsec or nullsec player give a lot of input for CCP.             
---
Like higsec player doing PVP in nullsec is fine, but nullsec player doing PVE in higsec mean that something is wrong.
---
&gt; Wouldn’t a disruptor make more sense instead of the web tho? You’re already fast af with that mwd.
---
You don't need a long point because you should be decloaking/warping within scram range. If you want to beat stabbed fits I'd go for a faction scram before dedicating another mid slot. The web lets you hold more pvp focused AB fits close in. I suppose you can go point/AB instead of web/MWD but I prefer the extra speed. You can also do an AB/web fit and speed tank, but you're already incredibly tanky as is and a MWD offers more qol/utility. 
---
&gt;Also, how do you fit for sites?
---
For that fit, bring a depot and do the web/relic analyzer and mwd/ab swap I mentioned above. As for pure explo, I use a covops (helios) as it's cheaper and better at scanning , but you can look it up and see what other people recommend. Just don't go full coward and fit 4 stabs in the lows because your locks will be miserable and you want a fast align with nanfibers/istabs (an "instawarp" of ~2s is ideal).
---
hahahaha
---
lol  acces denied
---
Any metric where players self categorize will be so abused
---
I posted this in few places already, but i don't remember if it was under your post.          
---
**If we get a slider on the launcher allowing us to select what kind of player we are** ... we can give this information to CCP each time account is logged in.          
---
So if i set this slider to "Nullsecer" and i am logging in a higsec account to run abyssals ... thats a lot of extra valuable information for CCP.
---
I've been playing for 12 years and have always wondered if it was possible to get in good with the pirate NPC factions.
---
Yes.
---
cAn SoMeBoDy tHiNk aBoUt sMaLl gUy?!?!!
---
Cloaked ship is harmless and that small guy is probably the one who camps you and your botting friends, not other way around.
---
Other post :D     
---
Slider on launcher - i select myself who i am consider to be and all the extra info you can get by adding this simple thing is free for you ;)        
---
Aka.        
---
* Nullsecer loging in a char in higsec to run abyssals             
---
* WH player doing burners in lowsec or in Venal              
---
* Lowsecer running C6 sites on alts          
---
We have the launcher and most of the players have all accounts on them.        
---
Like let us say who we consider/want to be.
---
But all that camping is also costly.
---
Almost zero reward, for almost zero risk.
---
It's sort of true. Regular rats in belts, missions, and anomalies/combat sites will shoot you no matter how good your standings with their faction. However, the roaming diamond rats (which are much more dangerous) will leave you alone, and even come to your assistance if you get attacked while they are on grid if your standings are high enough.
---
"I'm a krab in TEST but let me tell you about this idea to help the little guy purely out of the goodness of my heart"
---
Take out risk free cloaky camping so i can risk free crab pepega
---
'Make the game that feels like a job, more like a job!'
---
Sadly yes.         
---
But this changes in the perspective of NPC mining crews, they will even protect and rep you ... but at the same time don't apply to the same rats that are connected to NPC sotitos or fobs.
---
That's the spod.
---
no u
---
papo  try the game in different point of view you play how do you want to be played  , explore and do things with other people is the best part  not really need to be in a hig sec corp  you can still be on horde and fly with others on differents  locations of eve 
---
set your goals and  try to do them  you will find so many wonderfull things 
---
i can tall  it is hard i play from cuba and  was unable to log in in a almost 2 weeks just cause i doñt have internet time and it sucks  so my advice is go and  be yourselft and found friends  on eve comunity  and you will love it
---
&gt; Caps can drop in and do a quick kill rorquals/ ratting caps then go cloaking
---
If they have a Cloak fitted, it's going to take them days to lock onto a target.
---
&gt; a player with alts can afk and camping a whole constellation to shut down a corp or small alliance economic with ZERO risks on him
---
The cloaked ships don't shut anything down. The rivers of piss running down your pantlegs b/c Local is telling you there's someone out there, is what's shutting things down. Your absolute and inescapable terror of the boogeyman in the darkness, is what's making you a sniveling useless member of society.
---
Cloaks don't need anything. Local needs to go away (again).
---
Thanks for providing the service for so long squizz!
---
Holy shit i just googled this, had no idea PA bought CCP.
---
No wonder this game is going to shit
---
...it's expanding. That's frame being built.
---
Shitposting is more fun if I don’t have to explain it to you
---
There shoukd be NO module that  allows you to walk away from your  keyboard for more than 5 minutes or you are effectively a bot, and we all know the hatred we have for bots.
---
Set the indy cyno to be lit in high sec and you're good to good!
---
I hope the next thing you eat gives you mild heartburn
---
If you want to kill my krabbing ship, come and slap me in the face. What's cloaking for ?
---
Or not shoot at all.
---
Sure. The map tells you if there's been traffic in the last 30 minutes. It doesn't tell you what's happening right this second. So you have to wander around looking for hotspots and see if anyone is still around since that 30 min window.
---
Bots play the game. Cloaked ships cannot do anything while cloaked. They're the opposite of a bot.
---
Your responses.
---
The argument in question is very singular. That a growing number of players are injecting into super and capital pve while operating under the super umbrella mechanics. This is resulting in a massive net increase in pve ISK in null AND reducing the cost of capital / super production.
---
The changes that allowed this came three to three plus years ago. Since then CCP tried several fixes to reduce the safe ISK faucet Null has become. Said changes have had a small impact on the safe ISK faucet of Null.
---
As a result more and more players (and their alts) are injecting into super umbrella pve ratting over the last two years. PvE Capitals are becoming super capitals. One rorq accounts are becoming two, then three. The players ISK income is spiking massively versus what was normal for the game three plus years ago.
---
This is the issue at hand. You understand the issue. Your responses both in this thread and historically show a deliberate effort to distort and ignore reality in an effort to protect your preference for a pve umbrella.
---
Different people.
---
It's also easy to do graphical changes because they don't affect the game.
---
You just need to make sure they aren't broken.
---
No balancing and theory crafting necessary.
---
don't think i stated anything that would qualify as crying. just my own opinion. thats hows adults communicate.
---
Wally, is that you?
---
It sounds like you are upset because you believe what people say on /r/Eve  .  That's a pretty bad life choice.
---
You can camp whatever you want, but like a person. Make any threat or leave, not leave the PC or go play wow classic while camping
---
I have no preference and am not distorting facts.
---
First off I haven't mined or ratted in 5+ years so it has 0 bearing on my play style.
---
Second off, you can't actually determine if a player is using more and more alts. I am only going off raw changes made by ccp, which support my stance. A player attempting to make isk today would have to do more work than they would 2 years ago. This is not a debate on opinions this is factual based on changes made.
---
If you wanted to argue safety has been buffed I would defer that slightly in 2 years, pre cyno change it has due to ansibelex but we are now living in a world where compared to 2 years it is more dangerous and takes more work to make isk in nullsec. Again this is based on changes ccp made.

I legit see that many rorquals pretty consistently. More before blackout but the point still stands.
---
So afk camping just another kind of bot
---
whats your ign ill send you some isk for your troubles
---
No local, no cloaky campers...
---
a few years at least, twitch had it on the front page for the duration of the event. considering it's a few weekends a year and there's no actual monetary prize i think the return on investment is pretty good even if just a couple hundred people check out the game after watching the AT.
---
  
---
not to mention, i think it's good for the game to establish that kind of prestige among alliance teams for something outside mass fleet pvp - especially considering how many content creators took part in the event year after year.
---
i think two  big meaningful changes would be nice though - being able to bet *something* on the AT, maybe a set amount of gifted "tokens" or something you can use to redeem prizes later on but that can't be bought or traded?  and the other being a better prize to incentivize people to actually send their best.
---
They do make people afraid to undock while the camper go play other game, botter will find a way to continue botting, real player not.
---
This can't be a real reddit account
---
Cloaks don't make you a coward. Local telling you there's a cloaked ship, makes you a coward. Local is making you afraid to undock.
---
Blackout only proved one thing. There are TOO many cowards playing in Null Sec. And if they don't have their Local safety blanket to help them feel safe, then they don't want to play.
---
This works with no local also, you have limited time to do something with your target before you run out of cap
---
Then learn his active times and rat outside of those...
---
Their fleet. Their rules.
---
They might have not been botting in the ships they were killed in.
---
If you come for content why need to cloak for hours ? If you sit there cloaking for all day you probably something else
---
I both miss you.
---
Definitely not DJ Sploosh
---
There wasn't giant isk faucets back then. But sure if you want to breach the EULA go ahead. 🤷🏾‍♂️ Enjoy that belt ratting all day
---
I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in sniper school
---
Well we disagree here.
---
You're calling a small lore article bullshit, and saying that the resources should go somewhere else, as if the programmers and artists are the ones writing the lore articles and it somehow took away from the content creation you personally approve of.
---
That's a fairly narrow and selfish point of view. There are generally game changes that are preceded by these pieces of lore and there are plenty of people that appreciate CCP trying to keep the lore of the game in line with game changes, not just the role players.
---
As for the role players, they are a group that usually only ever gets content from ccp doing things for every other group in the game. There are a good number of rpers that will get hours of content rping about this article and its consequences in the lore, as an adult maybe you can appreciate that some people enjoy this content. 
---
I get your frustration if you feel like CCP aren't producing the content you are, but it comes across as really childish to be upset about a couple paragraphs of lore being written to proceed the inevitable change to the game that's going to happen after it. No-one is delaying a game change to write this article. 
---
Just my opinion tho
---
i miss u xoxo
---
small gang players and wormhole players aren't the same thing
---
You really are on Mittens level of dishonesty arent you?
---
You have a distinguished post history supporting and defending super umbrella pve mechanics. 'No preference' is clearly and laughable false.
---
You are again deliberately ignoring the actual issue at hand that has been explained at length and in detail. Your responses are designed to make it seem as if the current state of Null PvE under super umbrella mechanics is not widely broken in regards to risk / reward in favor of reward. 
---
Your timeline is carefully selected to deliberately target the era when CCP realized how broken null PvE was and started attempting to fix it. Even so, those fixes by CCP are not adequate as is clearly seen by the current economic reports coming out concerning Null PvE under super umbrella mechanics.
---
Your continued dogged refusal to acknowledge the actual issue and attempts to falsely portray null PvE as 'nerfed' are both inaccurate and insanely dishonest.
---
The latest 'you cant determine if people are using alts' is even more laughable given the current status the game in null. 
---
As for 'dangerous in null' .... seriously? Super umbrella mechanics make capital / super pve in null one of the safest and most rewarding options for pve in the entire game. You also know this. It is why you are so doggedly defending the super umbrella mechanics.
---
Well first they bitched because they had a "war" going on where they previously had been bitching about the opponent "running away" from their "small" coalition and having to do endless uncontested structure bashes.
---
They complained about having to go back to defend their own structures against npcs until ccp put a stop to that part of the whole affair.
---
Then they bitched about the local blackout, but it was worded in such a way that they were *only* moaning about it because it "hurts the little guy".
---
are you suggesting bots cant operate panic?
---
Achievement Unlocked: Attend a gaming guild meeting that should have been an email
---
Greta Thunberg, is that you?
---
Well, that's a pretty ambiguous statement.  Across how many systems?  Are they all the same player?
---
For example based on this data 5% of eve population is responsible for 12T of blue loot and whole T3 materials we have.             
---
If you include the fact that you cannot do it in c1 and c2 and it is mostly done in C5 and C6 then this is much less than 5% of eve population.
---
Its their IP so they can literally use anything I make based off it
---
Well now imagine yourself 2 sliders.       
---
Who you are and who you want to become.        
---
If many new players select Higsecer / Lowsecer and quit in few weeks this is priceless information for CCP.
---
Boting bans
---
Oh, so *that's* the retarded angle you're running.
---
Falkirk wheel?
---
Regular rats still will, diamond rats won't
---
I'm a bit confused about the point you are trying to make. 
---
Are you saying that RMT prices need to be lower?
---
If not, are you saying CCP needs to step up their game or are you saying that your probability of being caught is less than 66%?
---
Holy shit, look at all the babies downvoting because their invulnerability button is being talked about negatively.
---
dank purpz
---
Cloaky ships should lose their overview and/or ability to d-scan, change my mind.
---
Yeah man. It's as big as
---
YOUR MOM.
---
But yeah, I also docked at it 100 times and didn't look
---
I don't think a lot of players really know what they are, a lot of them will set them to something they think they are but are actually not.
---
I don't think there is a lot of valuable information for CCP that they don't have with this idea, we probably should let it slide.
---
My own spin on the phrase... 
---
 Always a cloak-hidden thing lurk-hiding, yes-yes
---
😳  Yes. 😶
---
1DQ1 is really a capital of the world, lol :)
---
People aren't afraid of the one lone bomber cloaky camping. They are afraid of the 30 blops ships waiting for a bridge somewhere in jump range.
---
This subreddit has always had a chronic inability to distinguish between "EVE isn't doing well", "EVE can't be fun" and "I'm not having fun". If you've been following EVE/CCP for some time that comment is absolutely spot on, however that doesn't mean that a new player starting today can't have fun, nor does that mean CCP haven't made major changes the last few years which make it harder to have fun.
---
EVE is a unique game you can absolutely have fun in and I'd highly recommend going for it if you're interested, but anyone telling you things are fine is lying or oblivious.
---
All the screeching about intel. And being cloaked does not prevent you from gathering it. Cloaked on a citadel you can see how many are inside and what ships come and go. On a gate you can see whoever takes that gate.
---
No.
---
Reading all your posts tells me it’s time to go to sleep. You gank pods and freighters in high sec and want a slider on the launcher so you can tell ccp you are a nullsec player.
---
wrong place to ask :)
---
Just give it a try.
---
I’m rolling an alt specifically to cloaky camp you.
---
Whoever typed this out did a great job. the bit about Aryth getting outed as a carebear was hilarious
---
Stop following/checking r/EVE and start playing. Go find your fun, whatever it is. Make your own goals, set your own challenges. That is where the fun is.
---
&gt;will probably have a civil war
---
time to resub?
---
Awesome stuff
---
😂
---
It's redundant all the same because it's still possible. It's daft to assume it doesn't happen just as it is to assume it always happens.
---
Bet you didn't say shit or leave after being told told off though.
---
The ree thing is a dumb and demeaning meme, I'm glad you got checked.
---
Absolutely not, might as well go out and whelp some Frigs before things get REALLY weird.
---
There's even more fun to be had if you don't care about longevity.
---
There is almost never an NBI on, the free ships are near worthlless, and the person in charge of new folks is a raging egomaniac, their space is farmed for cheap kills waaay more than any other group. Horde has massive issues. Ive spent the last 3 months messing around in horde on an alt and its pretty shit. I spent a day just watching newbeans chat and seeing dozens of questions go unanswered until I stepped in. 
---
But all that to say, if youre having fun, disregard all I said. Its just an opinion after all.
---
Wait, after everything over the last however many years of CCP bullshit, you're blaming Pearl Abyss?!
---
run their missions and you get standing like every other faction.
---
Angels and Guristas are the easiest since they have epic arcs you can start at any standing and can reset every couple of months.
---
Oh cool, thanks.
---
How can I hear weapons being fired? I just started the game 20 minutes ago, I am in my first fight, and I can't hear my missiles being fired or hit. I see the enemy health going down, but I can't hear anything. I am on laptop btw if that matters.
---
In the reprocessing window what is   
---
'Ore Processing Skills Average'
---
Does this mean my average across all reprocessing skills now effects reprocessing?
---
No cloaked ship has ever killed a ratter.
