I don't think I'm judging the WTM community as much as providing constructive feedback. That shouldn't get anyone angry. I would even say, such things should be encouraged by a community seeking to improve itself. In fact, I would consider myself a semi-attached member of WTM. That's how I witnessed this.

If objecting to the collective weight of every snowflake with special needs and sensitivities demanding that his condition be accommodated makes me a dick... well, we could stand to have more dicks in this game. Yes, I'd gladly take a dick any day.

You keep repeating that you are not personally offended, as though that lends you credence and impartiality. Apparently you have no skin in the game. Yet here you are passionately intervening on behalf of hypothetical people. That makes you an SJW white knight of the sort the OP was referring to.

Thats the beauty of Eve. You don't have to super rat if you don't want to is what I'm getting at. There are plenty of ventures to make isk in the game that don't require a super or a rorq but most people believe that is where the end game isk is.
---
It's only like 5m less per tick to throw in a haven after the two sanctums.
---
Not really that big of a deal lol, 100m instead of 105m
---
No I mean the Supers have the umbrella.  People rating and mining in subs don't.
---
You obviously havent looked at isk/lp recently. They were like that a few months ago before horde crashed the market, gilas/worms are 2k isk/lp and crystals are like 2.4-2.6k isk/lp
---
Just bc I’m Goon doesn’t mean I’m willing to spend bookoo dollars on a video game
---
I will do. Cheers mate 
---
Prices of consumer goods have stayed the same or gone down with the reduced mineral prices. You can whelp more shit with your isk than ever before.
---
The only product of significance that has gone up is Plex, which is in line with the average nullsec income. Old money that you aren't willing to replenish shouldn't be the benchmark for the value of plex.

That was my point.

I couldn't say whether it would be more efficient. But hauling 8 characters' P0 is a real chore. That shit is bulky. Most folks who have done PI for a while gladly sacrifice efficiency for convenience. The ones who don't tend to burn out and then their ISK/hr drops to zero.
---

There's a lot of discussion about missile mechanics, like travel time, missile application, and explosion velocity and what not but that's not as important as just knowing how to PvP.
---
If they want people to actually play when they pve, they're gonna have to make it much more rewarding, both money wise and enjoyability. The whole reason people afk their money making is because it's boring as all hell, and about as grindy as it gets.
---
I've had this. Was given roles in the Corp when I was new. Then I apparently learned Eve too quick cause I knew too much and was stripped of roles before I could steal the Corp wallet. Travelled around but ended up back happily with the same group. Still don't have Corp roles and IDGARA.
---
Hey, at least you have something to work back towards mate. You'll get there! Unless you actually know the person personally, giving roles to a new player just seems like a really bad idea on their part.

&gt; He can't hurt the guys really minmaxing, with super ratting and Rorquals - they get saved by the umbrella. He's hurting the little guys who maybe do a little ratting or salvaging, or mine in subs. Not everyone in Delve has multiple Rorqs.
---
I said we kill those minmaxing people. Super ratters, and Rorqual multiboxers, and so on. The umbrella is there, but it can't save them. We found ways to circumvent it. In my case by booshing/bombing drones, in mar5hys case by afk camping.
---
I heard a rumour CCP Falcon was personally involved. 
---
He promised not to blink his eyes or yield his gaze at mortals until the SP was handed out.
---
Cool thanks

I'm not sure why you say that. Can you help me understand your point by offering some evidence of it?
---
Virtue Signalling is when you express some view but dont actually act on it . From wiki
---
&gt;Virtue signalling is a pejorative term that refers to the conspicuous expression of moral values.[1] Academically, the phrase relates to signalling theory to describe a subset of social behaviors that could be used to signal virtue—especially piety among the religious.[2] In recent years, the term has become more commonly used as a pejorative by commentators to criticize what they regard as empty or superficial support of certain political views and also used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing appearance over action.

---
Guess my ratting carrier will become another combat carrier!
---
Congrats on your boldness. There's not much point in investing at this time. It could take you months of effort to double your principle and that laudable accomplishment would only represent 2 days worth of profit. If you have nothing to spend it right now, just save the ISK some place out of sight, like a corp wallet. If you don't have a corp you can use mine [PWCMG].
---
I have already agreed with this point in great detail with my own example. I'm not sure who you are arguing with.
---
Cambridge Dictionary has it slightly different than wikipedia? (which should never be used as an authoritative source) : an attempt to show other people that you are a good person, for example by expressing opinions that will be acceptable to them, especially on social media:
---
Virtue signalling is the popular modern habit of indicating that one has virtue merely by expressing disgust or favour for certain political ideas or cultural happenings.

I like the idea. I do also think it would present a new challenge to gankers, and they are probably bored at the moment.

GFs. The video makes me wish I would have been recording from our side, but I, and most, probably didn't expect much to come of it. We were just scanning a new chain and saw you and Jovian about so we kept lazily poking not a care in the world. Eventually we saw a couple of real ships aside from the helios (Oracle, Strat, etc) and a few people grabbed nano small gang stuff. I would have recorded, but it was basically 2.5 hours straight of rushing around fighting with the only break being quick crap crap crap refill the drugs, refill the drones, go go go, oh switch doctrines, redock/undock...without thinking of starting a recording.

I said the real capsuleer 
---
Pretty sure that 160k m3 is too large for a regular hauler since the largest haulers are the Bestower at 45.8k Iteron Mark V at 42.9k both fitted with faction cargo expanders and cargo rigs. 160k m3 is getting into jump freighter territory.
---
Not to mention that fitted like that the Bestower and Iteron are made of paper mache and wishes.
---
Eh, that's not really what most people are looking for. If they did, they'd say stuff like "shed members," "make the alliance smaller," or things along those lines. No, they say "spread out." This means they want the krabs to continue doing what they're doing, just outside the capital umbrella. They may also just want us to try and control more territory, with the hopes that we'll stretch ourselves too thin and make ourselves vulnerable like in 2016. Either way, it's a dumb idea and if we can't keep Delve as dense as we do now, so be it.

Thank you for a fast response :)

Didn't know this was an option. Saw it in GW2 and liked it and didn't know why they didn't do it here. Thanks!
---
Ok I see where you're coming from then how about anywhere between 60-90k depending on how you fit and spec it. 
---
so.......Gallente PI and mineral haulers we already got?   but with more space?
---
And here I was betting he had joined the Night’s watch.
---
You can make each faction have their own and give the ability to still be nullified if you fit that module. But if you don't you could take something that give you more space or align time. The options and potential are great.
---
more like the details of who knows what are "need to know", and reddit doesn't.
---
A change from the release today (the fix for not correctly expiring nullsec wormholes) made this problem accidentally way more frequent. According to our investigation it is possible that the fix for this will also fix (at least some) old cases. Let's hope that it does not cause any new problems - we'll know more soon. :)
---
Oh btw: The internal ticket for this old issue is from 2013 (and a older version of it is from 2012) and they have together nearly 150 bug reports attached to them.
---
Please be sure to report any remaining / new problems after the next patch, so that we can react to it. Unfortunately there are quite few problems with wormholes, which are not really happening in test environments (although the case from today was happening there as well with the correct steps), so unfortunately we need to rely to some extent on bug reports and logs from Tranquility.
---
&gt;Because evidence of goons doing what goons do in every game is needed
---
translation, I have no evidence of anything except for the fact that I hate goons so much they just HAVE to be cheating, and to me that's as good as evidence because that's how much I hate them.
---
nullified....does anyone else think warp disrupt bubbles to common atm? 
---
eh.   i'd like a mini jump freighter.  where it can only carry minerals/PI/ore.    
---
but a problem...is only Gallente and minmatar have a 3rd hauler to work off of.
---
Caldari and Amarr would need a new t1 to base it off of.
---
You rolled the hole that I was having my friends go through, maybe this was ccps way of telling you that you did a mean thing.... you made us go a whole extra 3 jumps to another hole!!! Do you know how long it takes to go 3 jumps? Like 2min lol. Anyhow interesting bug

I think this is the point where someone should link this because it now applies to your argument: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-v1TTUyhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-v1TTUyhM)

I think 60k for a specific type of hold sounds fine. Assuming you would lose some of that for fitting options like scan nuli, cloak or tank.

That was a ton of fun.

I do see where you're coming from but I feel like if this does happen it should be for every faction. It would make the game more interesting and more diversified. 
---
&gt;There was no objective, no narrative. 
---
this is why eve is dead
---
We already have 60k haulers, they're called DST's.

Totally agree. There are so many economic problems and plex price is definitely not one of them. It’s a symptom and the cause is whiny poors.

There might be but it's probably easier to use http://evemaps.dotlan.net/factionwarfare

---
Awesome. Thx for the statistics too, super interesting
---
Thank you for the TL;DR
---
To be honest it is starting to feel like everytime a VNI dies its called a bot. A dude who has 3 mining toons afk mining ice in HS gets ganked and is called a bot. Everytime someone is outbid on the market its a bot. FFS you guys are making it sound like actual players are a minority in eve and eve is populated by a bunch of bots.
---
you tried
---
Well god damn. You guys are class acts. You guys brought one hell of a fight, that heavy armor fleet was REALLY well played. It was one of the most memorable fights I've had and the memes in local were hilarious. We couldn't stop talking about all the crazy stuff that occurred after the event. It's nice to hear this type of thing once in a while.
---
Good fights bros. o7
---
Stay Strong Friend &lt;3
---
I'd like to buy 1 weed please
---
Rampant inflation? The cost of supers are going down because the supply is exploding. The price of PLEX has gone up because it got granulated. So every little change is now magnified x500. It's not socket riance.
---
Not everyone needs to follow and be told what to do.
---
Kim Cattrall! Kim Cattrall!
---
Making anoms take longer doesn’t stop botters, it empowers them. As a regular player you’re not going to sit around with your dick in your hand waiting for anoms to come back. As a bot you don’t care since you’re already going 24 hours a day. In fact botting may become safer because the bots will change to warp to a citadel/pos after every site. 
---
The context of the fucking post is the possibility of rampant inflation due to botting. What are *you* talking about?
---
The context of the post is about botting.
---
That was a great fight. Wish we could have joined in, but we only had about 4 or 5 guys on and not enough experience to do anything but feed kills to a fight like that. I did find it funny my poor Myrm kicked off such a massive fight though. T’was tons of fun to watch, hope to see you guys both around 😊😊
---
You need a narrative to sacrifice ships to our lord and savior Bob?
---
I use [borderless gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases/tag/9.5.5) for some games that don't have the fixed window option, not sure what you're finding odd about fixed window though so I don't know if it will be any better for you.
---
Thanks MCAV! It’s weird to see a POSPY post that’s not hate :) We look forward to great fights again in the future.
---
Wormholer, btw.
---
He has solo kills and actual activity on his Zkill. It's more likely he's just bad at ratting safely.

You can already get 60k universal storage using a DST. Hell, you already get 60k specialized storage using T1 haulers like the Epithal, Kryos, Miasmos, or Hoarder, all of which can be fit to be somewhat tanky. 
---
Ahhh High-sec, the measure of true wormholers. You know, we'd probably go for that if we were allowed to stray from orbiting our B274's
---
&gt; does anyone else think warp disrupt bubbles to common atm?

Have you ever played before the mobile warp disruptor bubble changes? There were more bubble fucked gates than clean gates in some regions. 
---
as if the most vocal people are people who still play the game...

I mean don't tell us, tell ccp on their forums. Anyways. Can I have your stuff?

Burners don’t change no matter what faction you run them for. Team burners in Angel space will be run the same way as team burners in Guristas. 
---
Most common missions to blitz are the team burners. I almost exclusively blitzed those and made great profits. All of them can be done with the same Garmur fit. 
---
Some of the agent missions aren’t too bad to do either but IIRC they require precise juggling of overheating and are a step up from the team burners. 
---
I’m not sure if the guide mentions it but pulling alts are the best way to improve income here. Involves grinding and sharing mission standing to your alts to get them to be able to pull themselves. Then you just need to abuse the 4 hour free decline and stack up as many burners as you can (have to bookmark the gate of the mission) and then blitz through them as fast as you can.

I'm a complete noob to eve. I've only put around 10 - 12 hours in the game and I'm wondering what part of the game should I dive into? Preferably something that is gratifying to play. Thanks!

Just some good fur nothin redneck corn growing sun of a gun

You could consider investing in Sisters exploration equipment, but you may want to save that for when you get more experienced due to its price.

The largest DSTs the Impel and Occator do not fit anywhere close to 60k m3. They fit 26.5k and 25.9k respectively. And again, with 0 tank.

good riddance

I really wish messages like these, showing the power of Eve community, would make me happy. But I got to be honest here. More often than not, I walk away with feeling that hardcore escapism/time sink games like Eve go hand in hand with depression.

The fact that quiting is generally regarded as "winning Eve" doesn't help much either.

I think the general consensus between our corp is we know a lot of the Pospy "hate" is just banter or memes. We play the game how we want to play it and others may not like it but we dont care. We are blood thirsty space pirates who will come at you over and over again until one of us run out of ships or pilots. That's how we like play and we dont need cap battles to get our rocks off

---
It's pretty hard to make a recommendation on which of the numerous activities you might find gratifying, given the scant information you've provided about yourself. Why don't you have a look at the [career chart](https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg) and see if anything stands out to you?
---
Are you thinking about the wrong ships? An Occator a 50km3 sized fleet hanger, and once you factor in the prerequisite Racial Industrial 5 it's 62.5k m3, plus the base 3.9k m3 cargohold.
---
And there's no way you can say DSTs have no tank. On top of having battlecruiser base buffer, they have considerable tanking bonuses. My slaved buffer Occator, with overheated hardeners, has over 500k ehp. 
---
Cheers dudes, awesome fight.
---
Can I get a TLDR on that TLDR
---
I was not aware of its fleet hangar. I'll take another look (i'm not a hauler.)

9) time to feed and cry on reddit for nerfs

Oh Thanks! I think I'll getting into exploration.

I have to say this is beyond fucking annoying. I understand the problems this game has but literally deleting the ability to super or carrier rat was not a solution. Losing half the usefulness of a 20+ bil investment is not fun either.
---
Rather then rework the sites or actually change the content all they have done is barred people from running the sites due to the spawn times. 
---
yep...

Please stop

I been lurkin' here for years. So i know that a cursory glance at the spreadsheets is already enough to make you an expert so.

Thanks MCAV!  Was a super fun fight.  I lost 3 ships that night and loved it.

I have never ever been a part of NGSA nerd
---
Read the NIP again and stop humiliating yourself.
---
Wait what, the relentless terrorism that PMCUnit runs?
---
That guy is such a tool, the corp isn't even worth mentioning.
---
Storytime:
---
Me and my boys were havin fun in placid about 4-5 years ago, PMCUnit comes around and invites us into his alliance (Black Flag Security Forces) or something like that.
---
I joined 1 of PMCUnit his fleets and that dude produces more salt than our ocean holds, as me and our boys did not like this dude we decided we were going to take over his alliance that we got invited into, it took us 3 days to get all the votes cast in our favour and become executor corporation, 5 minutes later we disbanded the alliance and seized the assets, me and my boys then got picked up by Initiative Mercenaries into Project Abscond which is now part of the Initiative.
---
Yeah have fun trying to work up a system that's at 0 military...rofl.
---
Can't spell pmcunit without cunt. 
---
This is also not wrong.  When people were saying 'make people live in the space they own,' there were a hell of a lot less anomalies per system, and people weren't carrier/super ratting.  But really what you're getting at is that the \*mining meta\* is what's ruining the game. 
---
My alliance is pretty new to wormholes, but we already learned a few lessons.
---
Some guys (e.g. Of Sound Mind) fight and give a gf despite stomping us hard and eventually leave after the fight is over. not gonna pretend we engage 2v64 like Sparta. but we always fight, even at disadvantage as long as we see the opportunity to kill at least SOMETHING in return. and if it's just a sabre. we almost always get stomped/killed. we managed to snack a few ships here and there and it's getting better, but we're still pretty bad.
---
But then there are the people that think it's incredibly elite pvp to wait 14 hours nonstop on a highsec exit with 12 lokis and 4 sabres to prevent it from getting rolled when they dont even need it. Just to get cheap megathron or daytripper kills. (we dont have the ressources to effectively negate these tactics yet) that's like the equivalent of gatecamping in tama. i mean cmon. camping for 30 minutes - okay, but 14 hours?
---
for now i can speak for ALL bigger wh entities one of two points:
---
1) we have not fought against you yet OR 2) the fights were nice, more of that, please
---
The only group that I really begin to dislike a lot is "Stranger Danger." Fuck these guys, srsly. More annoying than Wingspan, holy shit.
---
Daddy
---
Just use an Orca... SMA, large cargo hold and fleet hangar. Also ore hold for transporting your ores and ofc a mining, boosting, logi and dps all-in-one with a massive tank...
---
You're welcome

Something smells like bullshit.
---
Rorquals don't generate ISK though. Ratting does.  
---
Yes and if we want to go with perfect situations, a Vindi with dual web scram would melt any PvP tanked frig in under 10 seconds.
---
What's ur next perfect counter bullshit scenario?
---
Oo I got one!  A beam retribution would easily kill a smart bombing machariel!!! OMG you are so right!

I think I just started watching this reference. Only half way thru first episode tho.

Can I? I'll give it back when you return!

As a former director of a very large corp in WI. I am both proud and proudly disgusted widot has become a meme. However, even though I can probably guess.... what does it actually mean to "widot"?

You are trying to say that the incursion community, which is a microscopic amount of people relative to the population of the game, is the reason eve is dying.
---
It is a laughably wrong statement with no logic or reasoning backing it.
---
This is what FW was supposed to be about, but isnt :(
---
1/5 pts for contribution. No point was made but lots of venom still flexed ... :D
---
The funny part is we spend way more than 8 hours a day ratting in systems, so our ADMs will be just fine...

I'm looking forward to it too. I really enjoy t1 frigate pvp but it takes a long time to find engagements, requires a lot of investment (for me anyways to save up for ships to blow up), and half of engagements are bait for a blob or you have to take the fight against the faction ship b/c nobody else is around. I'm hoping for the same pvp experience I had from eve online just a few years back and hopefully it is easier to pick up and set down in smaller sessions. I also like the idea of a reset eve.. I just hope there is J space. I'm also worried they'll mess up electronic warefare b/c I don't see scrams and webs in the trailer that is out. 
---
THE CONFLIct in the south is heating up prepare for war my friend
---
I suppose we have been slacking and need to up our game.
---
Sounds like you need to consolidate your members into a space they can use instead of bloating your sov holdings. Look how well that worked for us in both cases. 
---
yikes.
---
&gt;My slaved buffer Occator, with overheated hardeners, has over 500k ehp.
---
Mother of god!  Thats insane...
---
I notice you have no real point you make yourself in this entire thread full of your posts... its almost like you posting just to see your own words show up on the screen.
---
Its not a glitch, its the path of an ansiblex warp gate. They work similarly to the way normal gates work except that they can be destroyed, require fuel, supercaps and above cant use them, and you have to pay to use them. Think of them as a toll road. Also, green on one side means you can use it from only that side, red on the other end means you can't use it to get back.,
---
Wingspan is in an odd place because it's a pretty incoherent entity. Sure there are the more active suspects but it's probably closer to Stay Frosty than an actual corp. I used to dislike Stranger Danger a lot because Lee is unbelievably obnoxious sometimes but after he took half of the active Strange Danger population to form Chain Smoking he seems to have toned down the autism a lot. Chain Smoking seem to give some decent fights from time to time at least. I'm not actually sure what Stranger Danger does now as I never see them in chain compared to like a year ago. At this point I'm hoping that Lee can keep the sperg under control and grow into a pretty large respectable group able to bring full fleets against some of the C5 blobs.
---
Upvoted that. I made better isk blitzing t3's than grinding t4's.
---
The overheat bonus on DSTs is no joke. I used this for baiting once or twice, but it's also good as an insurance policy in case the cloak-MWD trick doesn't work. 
---
I have an Impel fit lying around somewhere on my hard drive that's over 1 million ehp. It's High Grade Slaved and has A-type EANMs, but you can get respectable tank numbers using cheaper mods and a cheaper implant set. 
---
Was flying real ships last night or I would have been there!
---
Everyone's character pic is replaced by that image for the day.

I think the question is why shouldn't isk be inflated? It kills off poors

literally the second or third biggest lowsec alliance left since snuff ate everyone else already.

It's when an alliance merges into a single corp and joins another alliance. The originator being Wildly Inappropriate [WI.] forming the Wildly Inappropriate corp and joining goons.

to roll all of your members up and join a different corp together in order to stay in your alliance when your corp is leaving

Was a fun fight!  Thanks for brawling it out with us.

I'm not playing defense here, that would be you, the guy trying to defend the CCP conspiracy theories about leaks. And its not my fault that every time you post the nonsensical crap you posted applies to you better than what you are trying to complain about

Feels like you've got some unfinished issues you're in dire need to reach closure on...i'm here for you buddy, if the back and forth is helping you reach that new mental stable heights you so clearly seek... then keep at it bro.. together we can find the closure you need.

This really goes a long way towards showing why the whole thread here is people telling you you're wrong. You have no point and when called out on it you resort to insults and put downs because you have nothing of substance to offer in the first place. 
---
Hedliner your defo just an age of empires monk wolololing all the good mbers from each corp... Good play tho
---
Is that all, or do you have more to go? ... i feel like you can dig deeper than that...that felt like 10% effort to be honest.. we need to get to the root of this festering issue... as in, you're spending a lot of time analysing me as a person and my behaviour in this "thread"... so... where is the jump off point...what is the conclusion to this story arc.. or did you need me to offer rebuttles to keep the back and forth going...
---
Like...are you getting closer to an actual point?
---
Working on it. 😊
---
point: you = bat shit crazy.
---
Still only takes 2 or 3 sites to hold lvl 5... not like respawn delay on a lvl 5 system is going to make any difference to that
---
Hey fanbois.
---
Just because someone works for CCP doesn't mean they are right. 
---
If CCP employees were always right the game would still be in a healthy state and everyone here would still play it.
---
Ok, so thats the final rest point.. ...thats you're last remaining thought on the subject... so...closure yet? or is there more in the tank?
---
I like the T2 corvette idea better.
---
&gt; Idk the specific reason but it’s likely due to how insanely fast fighters are, which would ruin any attempt to balance application based on tracking (current application arguments aside).
---
I think that's a part of it, but another reason is probably server performance. One of the reasons for the switch to new fighters was server load in big fights.
---
Standard turret damage calculations require a comparison between two objects to calculate angular velocity, while the missile only has to get absolute velocity of the target. But a true missile is a lot more work while it's in flight since it's a real thing moving through space. The fighter weapon is the cheapest parts of both.

Best thing to do first is find a new-bro friendly Corp.  It will make the biggest difference in game play for you.  I can't stress this enough.  I went through a few Corp's before I found the right one for me, but it was well worth it. 
---
I've been seeing vastly more VNIs just fit a single Warp Core Stab and be immune to solo ganks. Ran across 12 of them in Detorid/Wicked Creek while roaming in my Retribution.
---
Bot or not, I don't believe this really increases the risk at all. It just cuts down on the total number of sites that can be run per day. 
---
What ships do you like flying?  I put my un-used isk into ships and modules.  That way I don't end up spending the isk on dumb things.  If I ever go broke, at least I have ships and modules to fly with.  
---
Da faq ? 
---
What do I need to run level 1s? Can I just do it in the mission frigs?
---
But he wasn't kicked for "fee fees". He was asked to change it. He was kicked for refusing a request/order by the FC.  The only people whining about fee fees are those that are "offended by why he was kicked" - to use your words.  So harden the fuck up.

as long as you slag the VNIs, ya it works.

One change I'd like to see, maybe it would help, maybe not:  increase tackle, speed, and application mods by the ships in anomalies.  let the frigates be capable of 3k/s
---
Long way to travel for such a small isk delta.

The items finally after contacting support, and waiting a day, showed up in safety cans in the station.

I just wanna point out my in cyno lived through all that hellishness. :D
---

---
BR puts six Lokis killed last I looked. 
---
We were speculating that the intended batphoned cyno was on a tempest that died with 150 LO in cargo, and that the cyno devoter was an emergency backup as we were murdering the bait fleet. Would love to know how that went down on the other side.
---
We killed 6, I didn't look too hard at how many were yours.
---
It seemed like your drop was textbook Murphys Law. That devoter really shouldn't have pointed anything since it was the only cyno you guys had left. 
---
Meh, it was a fun brawl. Are you... Are you salty?
---
Idk we jumped in, some of us sunbounced and died, then we jumped in caps and cleaned up the grid
---
Do what people everywhere else in the game do, when an anom is taken, they hop over a couple jumps and look for one that isn't. Shocking I know, but that is actually how it works ...

Mmmmhhmmm. I can't wait til this happens, more Rorq accounts plz !!!! Let Plex climb up and keep on climbing. Let it hit 5 Bil, then 10 Bil, so on and so forth. Am all for it.

&gt; Rather then rework the sites or actually change the content all they have done is barred people from running the sites due to the spawn times 
---
Whats stopping you from doing it like the rest of everyone does it ? Simply jump over a few systems and find some extra anoms. 
---
Also what makes you think they aren't reworking the PvE itself as well ? Just that a simple change to spawn timers is very fast, does not require lots of man hours, whereas a PvE rework does. I would not be surprised at all if they announce something soon or make some serious changes to ratting anoms across the board starting with VNI ratting and going all the way up.

---
Fingers crossed, but historically changes to nerf income have not been followed up to that extent. If they do it will be nice but I won't be surprised if these spawn tweaks are all we get for some time. 
---
Why? As Frat found it, its content doesn't actually mean anything.
---
What kind of integration with pyfa would you like? All fittings are already exchangable between pyfa and EVE Workbench using EFT format. 
---
Not really, unfortunately, for example: Auto Missile Passive Drakes. Oldie but goodie from before the drone days, still work like a charm.
---
1st and foremost, this change is not about botting, but about supers being idiotically out of whack in ISK generation and causing major damage to the game. NS ratting in general too, but supers in particular. 
---
I love and hate this "feature". We were hunting an Orca doing a jita run in a wormhole one night, we see him on the k-space side land on the hole, jump in and hear the hole fire. We waited to see if he was just holding cloak, nothing. 60 seconds later someone calls Orca on D-scan so he was spat back out of the collapsed hole right to his citadel.  
---
Better post than the OP, well done

Wheeler you're better than this
---
&gt;  My point is that this inconveniences real players, not bots
---
My point is that those incovenienced players have been fucking over everyone else in the whole game by breaking the economy just for starters, and this change is not about bots but about a particular fuckingly broken and out of whack ISK faucet.
---
Peronally I think they didn't go anywhere near enough, they made a tiny little change for PR reasons to say that they are doing something. This shit needs some serious attention, not symbolic gestures like this one.
---
hhhhhh wth

In my personal opinion, the mining is not too bad off, save for the invulnerability issues behind rorquals. T1 should be cheap when you compare it to T2, and it is (but still not dirt cheap), so I quite like all the mining. I'd say mix up the rorqual invulnerability a little bit little until both sides are whining equally as hard (sardonic solution).
---
 On the other hand I believe the endlessly respawning and infinite spawning anomalies is an issue, and it always has been. My personal solution is to treat bounties like industry does: diminishing returns. It'll keep turbo umbrellas expensive and the little guy won't feel it as much. The numbers can be adjusted, of course, but it'll be easier to tweak than working in absolutes [such as rock havens only spawning in x amount of minutes]. I don't think we should discourage the Imperium types necessarily, and certainly one nyx shouldn't be able to reach the soft cap of diminishing returns.

"I dont want to put even minimal effort into maintaining my isk balance but want to be able to sustain myself indefinitely."
---
Makes sense 
---
Back then you’d make 30m/hr in the max pimped CNR, in the safety of highsec nonetheless. You could make more if you knew what you were doing, but generally the pimped krabs made that, so 4 hours for a GTC.
---
A maxed out rorq makes about 500 plex in 4 hours now just mining ice, more if your moon mining a good moon ofc.
---
Was that you looting the field while we were duking it out?
---
Or afk in faction warfare plexes, CCP likes that too, right? 
---
Or better yet, upgrade to Omega and afk mine with Rorquals, *CCP likes that as well, right*?

Hmm, i was wondering because my wife streams. And she's been getting into eve. But i don't want the fun of the game to be ruined for her because people single her out due to being a streamer while she's still learning the ropes.
---
Can you remember who won that tournament?
---
Yeah right? Don't think too hard, no one can. The only thing people will remember about that AT is that CODE. won it even before it started.
---
CODE. undefeated in the AT. The CODE always wins! ALWAYS!

Oh and BTW, CODE. still exists but the AT doesn't

Creating a ship just for the sake of creating a ship shouldn't be directive.
---
I'm /r/OutOfTheLoop, what's going with this person's face being photoshopped?
---
In all honesty if she's knew, she most likely wouldn't be in any position where gankers would single her! If they did, and they did it consistantly, you could submit it to CCP and they could possibly ban that person for harrassment. If she's flying in the same space and the same natives kill her over and over that's different. But if she's streaming, and the same people are killing her constantly all over the place, then you can bring it to CCP. 
---
That's CCP Falcon and that's his face from the thumbnail of the latest Eve Pulse video. 
---
Who cares about the spin?
---
Sure, its ols school to have a reson why we are attacking someone.

But most of us simply do not care.

Its more fun to have a story behind a war, I guess.

&gt;  One of the best moments in Mobile Gaming I've ever had was when I was driving to the mall with her. She was in the passenger seat playing nova and all of a sudden she yelled "Our alliance is under attack!". I pulled over at the first location I could find, turned off my car, and opened up my phone. We had a great battle and It was the first time my girlfriend has ever experienced "the shakes" in a game...Her and I have been in love with mobile gaming ever since.

active hull tank... that would be nice as you have med slot reppers and low slot tank modules, wich makes its fitting uniqe from shield (med/med/low util) and armor (low/low/low util)
---
&gt; In all honesty if she's knew, she most likely wouldn't be in any position where gankers would single her!
---
null ratters are already the main and sometimes sole target of people coming into our space. My concern isn't with a handful of people killing her its a conga line of people that file into GE- looking for soft targets to shoot at.

Pfew! Thanks for the good joke on this morning :D
---
I think that people are largely mistaking the ennemi here. 130m for the APM of Super ratting and the ship's price is not such an aberration to me. I've done Super ratting as a main income for a moment and what made me stop is the debilitating number of clicks it takes, but is it really so bad ? I don't think so. A Super is like 15 billions for 390m/h (assuming you do 130m/tick) where a Dread can do 700m/h in a C6 (correct me if I'm wrong on that). What ultimately makes a difference is the fact that a Dread is static and sieged when a Super is aligned, this here is the real problem to me, not the actual tick of the ship. 
---
3 were ours. Our backup cyno that came in with the first wave bounced off the sun with some of the Loki's.

I've had the most fun just being cloaky.  I've witnessed many fights (1v1) right in front of me, and when the fight is nearly over I decloak and help kill the loser, then proceed to kill the winner.  Had lots of salt doing this.  LOL.  
---
So, collect salt?
---
I'd highly suggest joining one of the larger null newbie corps. There are many upsides for just a few downsides.
---
Downside wise you will be a face among thousands and have to make a name for yourself to ever be anything more than a line member. Also its a nullsec corp that is often wardecked making a return to high sec while still in corp dangerous.
---
On the upside they are tailor made to teach new or inexperienced players the ins and outs of many activities in eve running from isk generation, large blob fleets, cov ops, and FCing. Most of the big newbie corps have special interest groups you can join to focus in one area. They also hand out free ships and skills for you to learn different aspects of the game.
---
Even if nullsec is not your thing joining for a month or two to learn new things and then moving on is a good strategy. Nobody ever bats an eye at a newbro corp in somebody's corp history. 
---
give me your stuff? j/k
---
join RvB or something, socialise with your fellow capsuleers, blow stuff up and have fun. The spark will soon come back.
---
Greetings friend :)
---
I came back from inactivity back in August and I was at the exact same point as you are right now. Scared to try stuff, confident that I would just fail at most things I tried or that I would just stay in HighSec / run in some Wormholes here and there when they popped up and try to make some ISK through that.
---
Alas, I decided that this is a game that needs you to explore more than just the space in it. It has amazing communities and people that are willing to help you in every step of the way. And this is what you should focus on. Find your spot in this world. Find the people that make you want to log back in the game every single day.
---
Despite of what I will propose, you should do just that. Try and find YOUR spot.
---
With that said, I joined Dreddit back in August hearing stories of grandeur and amazing battles throughout New Eden. Here I found people that helped me figure out the game, what I liked and gave me an amazing community to go back to whenever things become hard in RL. Dreddit is the core corporation of TEST Alliance Please Ignore and stands in one of the richest places of New Eden, Esoteria in sovereign null sec space.
---
We offer mentoring programs, huge fleet battles and dedicated groups that do all sorts of things from bombing to hauling, to marketeering. No matter what you are looking for in the game, we can probably offer it. And (as I already mentioned many times) we have an amazing community to back it all up.

Yas, thats number one reason why i hate him, he literally agreed to bring dudes to come fly free fucking ships, then turned his back and decided he wanted to bring a squad of napocs. If he kept to his word we would have been able to bridge all 50 abbys on their stationary eagle fleet and fucked them.

Find a goal. It has to be realistically attainable but not easily so

Found only super/titan and plex sales.

Yeah I didn't think they'd leave low sec, despite what like 5 directors all promised.
---
this is a fascinating aspect about EvE I learned during my 1,5 years that I play this game. you can shittalk in local like crazy, shittalk here on reddit, spread hate for other corps/alliances ingame, but as soon as someone has any real life trouble this all stops and eve players unite to help a fellow capsuleer out. be it the death of someone from this community, mental health problems or anything basically that would impact someones life negatively capsuleers stand together and try to help. I've never experienced something like this in a gaming community before. o7 to all of you guys
---
can you guys stop being so bitter and let people enjoy what they like? 
---
I fail to see how small alliances can be viable without being in some sort of renter agreement with the nearest nullbloc.
---
Great AAR, sounds fun

the 20au grid range. It used to be something like 250km, then it was upped to some obscene number like 15kkm, and now as you can see they've done one better and its up to 20au!
---
No.
---
It's great when you meet someone IRL that you have been blowing up and they have been blowing you up. All that animosity and shit dissolves and you just hang out talking about 'Hey remember that fight in system XYZ? Yeah I died there but it was shitloads of fun! Where you there too?' This sort of thing is what makes Eve such a great game.

---
I was in the same position when i originally quit in 2012, when i rejoined in 2016 i made a few friends and it really enriched my experience and now i play constantly so here's what i'd suggest based off my experience. 
---
Firstly, see if you can identify what kind of role you enjoy doing, Industy, PVP, PVE, Trading etc.
---
There is tonnes of stuff you can do in EVE so just doing a bit of research into that specific area can really help you get started, if you're not sure it's not the end of the world, as i'll point out in the second point.
---
Leading on from the first  point, and arguably most importantly, find a suitable corp for your interests, most corps cater for a wide range of activities anyway so if you enjoy a broad range of activities or are unsure it's fine, you'll likely have the opportunity to try out anything you want to. 
---
have a look at some of the newbie friendly corps/alliances and join their recruitment channels to find out more information about them: RVB, Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, EVE Uni, Karma Fleet etc.
---
While you can do a lot of stuff solo, EVE is very much a social game and doing it alone can really hinder your experience and having other people there to do stuff with can be really motivational and is a sure way of making good friends.
---
Playing solo is great if you know what you're doing and you're very focused, but even solo players are generally part of a big corp where they can work with others when they want to.
---
Hope this helps

---
Thank you Torvald, 
---
You have summed up exactly why streamfleet was started and why we continue to work so hard as a community. The whole purpose was to bring content to the eve community - to assist the streamers in encouraging collaboration and enjoyment. 
---
As you mention - getting into streaming is not that scary, you dont need much tech kit and you  simply (ha) need to hit the start button and talk away..even if its just to yourself.
---
Yes, there will always be stream snipers - but its rare and there are ways to avoid it should you wish - there are of course many a pvp player who welcomes the interruption and conflict..
---
We are so proud of what has been achieved over the last 2 years and look forward to an exciting year of more content, more people streaming and more events.. who knows... I may even stream more often myself.
---
Should someone want to create a small alliance and carve a small space in null, space should be available. That was the idea behind Fozzie sov. People used moons and other stuff before it, so alliances held onto vast unused space. Now there is space available, on paper.
---
Fozzie sov failed to reach its goals (of legitimizing small alliance gameplay). Not because space is unavailable. But because it failed to distinguish between 2 kinds of space safety. The first kind is infrastructure warfare. Warfare that happens over timers. As a small alliance, you can manage that warfare with batphones, diplo, attrition, or irrelevance-tanking (nobody attacks you because why). You have plenty of options.
---
The second kind of safety is safety of ships in space. That kind of warfare happens simultaneously. You have to have a plan if your Rorqual or super gets tackled. In Eve 2019, you will just get obliterated without a supercap umbrella. So what is the use of having your space, if you can't Rorqual mine in it, whereas large alliances are non-selectively recruiting? Of course, you will join a large alliance.
---
Now my proposal aims to do two things. It aims to keep the first kind of (infrastructure) safety for small alliances (fozziesov's only achievement), but aims to diminish second kind of (ship) safety large alliances. This hopefully would bridge some of the lucrativeness gap between the small and the large alliances. It doesn't mean joining large alliances won't still be the most lucrative when it comes to minmaxing profits. But if you are a small alliance who doesn't like being told what to do, who doesn't like to rent, who doesn't like to live with huge herds of crabs, at least there is less gap between the "carve your space" option and the "join large alliance" option.
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
its pretty rare that this happens - but there are ways to avoid it and work around it - please ask her to join our public discord where there are many eve streamers who would be glad to provide advice and guidance to her  -https://discordapp.com/invite/GH3nWDG
---
Solo structure bash?
---
That is really good.
---
Lenin in user name, checks out.
---
Client or serverside? Either way, fun
---
If your peak content is ratting the only entertainment value coming from that stream is the inevitable stream snipe 
---
"One sec we're midding"  
---
"engaging now"  
---
"well.... be there in a few mins"
---
&gt; It doesn't mean joining large alliances won't still be the most lucrative when it comes to minmaxing profits. 
---
Precisely, but also with this change, large alliance might be reluctant to accept you (as opposed to what they do now, when there's no economic incentive to not accept anyone).
---
Yes, I'm entirely supporting this idea. I mean I also get the narrative from the goons saying "yea well you wanted people to live in the space they own", which should hold true. The implementation from CCP, though, was very imprecise and didn't take into account the sheer amount of people you could cram in "your space" of a piece of a single region, compared to the amount of people actually playing the game.   
---
Your proposal will definitely change this. Thanks for taking the time to write it, now we just need to make sure it reaches the proper people. 
---
Doing station sanctums and gas havens may be less ideal than rock havens and ring sanctums, or even Hubs maybe. That doesn't mean they can't be flown, right?
---
As already suggested, buy a bunch of cheap frigates and go join FW.  If you find it hard to find targets, go for the locals and go pirate :)
---
It is what I have been doing since my return, tons of fun :)
---
Sounds like burnout.
---
I got like this after the second delve war and even though I found a more relaxing activity It got more and more to log in, spin ship, nah cant be bothered.
---
Needed a good break which tbh was nearly a year and came back to it bit by bit.
---
Maybe just try a different career path or use a different alt with a totally different playstyle if you don't want to take a break.
---
i'll never understand people that reach so goddamn hard to find a way to enjoy a game when the answer is obviously that they're over it, stop wasting your time and move on, plenty of other great games out there for you to experience.

He was asked to change it because it hurt the FC's fee fees.  Period.  The rest is just consequence.

Find a reason to log, a goal or something, personally it was to get a titan, now I have one it's to have a second one and some nano nyx to do solo pvp in hostile territory

Did you hear about the ECM changes ?

people like you make horde look bad

It is far less autistic than super ratting, far less tiring, far less boring, and has better Ticks (except faction Capitalspawns in Havens), also I do it fr about 2 hrs a week. Autistic are nullsec guys logging in to circle Anoms for hours every single day ...
---
I see what Hugh did there!
---
ah yes, when Burner Fits were made there was no Damavik, maybe I have to check this. But I cannot imagine how a Kitsune would help me killing faster, safer yes, but faster?
---
so you came to reddit to cry about a guy crying and write low effort snotty and condescending replies?
---
me too
---
Play another game, and come back in 4 months.
---
Sounds like you're gonna have to move your krab toons from B0T to Nancy proper.
---
Price check in-game channel still a thing?
---
What would you recommend?
---
Yes the LP conversion rate is volatile, depending on market situation for faction mods, faction tags and so on. For me over the last 3 years it was between 2000 and 4000 ISK/LP average constantly, the peak rate for low amount items is at 5500 to 7000 ISK/LP. For me burners always were between 350 and 600 Mio. ISK/hour.
---
What I like in Burner Missions is the NPC Strength that actually gives you the feeling of a pvp encounter (shipstats wise). Off course the KI cannot match a (skilled) player but killing a F1-pusher in the same ship would be easier ....
---
So..... While some players do plex their accounts I suspect it's a tiny minority. If you have data suggesting otherwise please link it. Everyone I know that plays has a subscription for the specific reason that it stops being a game and becomes a job if you have to play to earn the isk to play. It completely ruins the game for most people so those that want the stuff that comes with Omega accounts but don't want to pay for it probably do leave after a while due to that reason but frankly they're not the people we or CCP should care about. They were going to leave eventually anyway.
---
Calling people names is pretty silly, by the way. Especially when said name-calling is hypocritical, as is the case here.
---
Ah true :D Lol, when i cared to try to hunt those guys all of them jammed my tackle.        
---
It was quite a while ago and so annoying that i stopped to hunt those.        
---
Way before the ECM changes :D
---
hell yeah! I have about 50 in my hangar to burn right now. Mine doesn't quite do the 1000 DPS but I have swapped a 3rd mag stab for an armor repper for a bit of longevity. I also don't use any drugs or implants, I run them to get the best bang for the buck. 
---
The comet was my fav ship for a while, but I've changed to the hecate, it's just a bigger, badder, faster-warping version :P

Ive been playing kenshi off steam ATM. Its a weird post-apocalyptic sandbox game. If you like eve, you may enjoy it. Its single player though.
---
Join PL. Go to a couple of his fleets. Let us know what you think then.

True story time: I was a newb in Horde for quite a while.
---
Then one day randomly googling something EvE related, I found a post by Gobbins where he argued with a member of an opposing null bloc. He pulled his post history on some political issue, immigration I think, and said something along the lines of "this is the poster child of x organization".
---
Regardless if I agree with him or not politically, how stupid do you have to be to do shit like this, especially on an issue where polls show that the camps on either side are fairly evenly divided in the 30-70% range depending on the country and the polling format, in an Alliance with 20k+ people? It's generally just bad business for organizations to take a staunch position on such hot issues as you run the risk of discouraging large swathes of potential "customers". It was at that time I realized that Gobbins lacks organizational skills, a good leader should lean towards diplomacy and pragmatism over peddling his own convictions.
---
I was in the process of planning to leave for other reasons anyhow, but that act sealed the deal for me.
---
Please sir can I have some more!

if you ask FC for a bio break, but he says no because the feeding must continue right now, do you shit your pants or do you have a bucket already within close vicinity ready?

I always hear how bored people should join FW, so I did. It was pretty fun, but gets old very quick. I don't know why... I think at some point it became about loyalty points and I would spend too much time capturing bases. 15 mins is just too much, and it would always take longer with the NPCs and neutral pvpers looking to fight.  
---
No, you don't have "ways to subvert the umbrella".  The umbrella isn't there (mostly) for people who aren't on coms or who have shitfits or who don't have inhibs on overview, etc.  That's fine by me.  People who don't follow instructions learn by losing their stuff.  AFK camping isn't "subverting" it either because the people it affects most can't call it.
---
Stop trying to make this highfalutin moral philosophy out of what is in essence your greed (you like stealing excavators - who wouldn't) and Marshy's hard-on for Goons. 
---
You don't know what we are doing to get our kills. Perhaps acquire more knowledge before having an opinion.
---
I'll grant you that.  I get the feeling that World of Wuss-craft is slowly invading too.
---
Thanks for the tip! I use this "link format" for text e-mails and find it easier to just use it everywhere instead of the markdown syntax.

I just made it the size i wanted in windowed mode then changed over to borderless mode.
---
Joining a larger entity would sure go a long way of getting more involved. Could try your hand at being in a lowsec or a nullsec corp, one that does PVP preferrably so you get to be part of the big fights.
---
Nullsec entities are probably a bit easier to join to, only downside is the fact that moving around can be a pain in occasion due to bubbles and random roaming people but honestly, you'll have a great time. If you think you have in it you, or interest to FC, give it a go in them. r/evejobs or the official forums could be a place to find a nice new corp to have a cozy home at.
---

Sort of me as well. I watched a Nestor get killed in a C6 to a drifter and looted 1.2b of his wreck. I thanked him in local of course.
---
anybody got any of dat scrotium repair paste
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---

---
was too busy inserting into your mom.
---
Dumb idea, get lawst
---
Was going for max dps and forgot to play around with the lows from my actual fit, i fixed it.
---
The best advice is honestly to find a different, better game. Elite Dangerous is fairly good.

---
Y'ALL GOT MORE OF THAT PASTE???
---
Well the Russians already talked with legacy about invading FRT. it's no coincidence that the NIP between the Chinese and Legacy ends in less than a week.
---
FRT Know that the same exact thing that happened pre NIP signing is going to happen to them in a weeks time - Legacy dogpiling them while imperium hangs around for good fights, except ofc imperium shoot FRT first on grid. So trying to act as if legacy was only called in because of FRT getting support from Skill Urself is kinda disingenuous.
---
Both sides are just making smart diplomatic decisions for the enevitable conflict that's on the horizon.
---
I don't know why both sides feel the need to sperg out and to spin up some master narrative when it's all just obvious strategic moves. 
---
Exit Strategy
---
Wormholers with heaps of active players and heaps of content.
---
lmao
---
currently thats the only content keeping us alive in eve . so i would say keep it going
---
At the same time, if there's that many people going there to kill them already, then perhaps her streaming wouldn't likely be the catalyst that gets her killed. If you're too blingy, you may get stream sniped, if you're an easy target, you may get stream sniped, but if you're either, you may just get killed by a regular person and think you were streamed sniped when you weren't. There's lots to stream in Eve, and it's not all in low/null.
---
I scrolled down to the TL;DR
---
This coming from the crabbers that lose a rupture fleet daily in Geminate
---
It's okay, CCP almost remembered you existed but then *wormholer*
---
:(
---
41
---
&gt; We could kill either.
---
No you couldn't.  Don't lie.  I spend every evening on comms and I hear and see what dies and why and what doesn't and why.  It's almost always (like 99% of the time) one of the things I mentioned.  Dreadbombs are rare in Delve these days.  
---
&gt; we hurt the minmaxing rich the most
---
That's the thing, you do, as you're stealing expensive drones and dropping low-hangers.  Marshy doesn't though.  
---
&gt; and not the poor as you initially claimed
---
Cloaky camping does that to people who want to rat and mine in subs, if they don't want to feed.  As I said but you seem to be deliberately ignoring this because it doesn't suit your argument which is, again, some kind of virtue signalling when the reality is you're not doing it to hurt the rich as you're presumably rich yourself.
---
Umm, have you not followed my conversation. Topic is about travel fit which I’m saying is dumb. Full tank super isn’t dying in a several seconds before down time. When the server restarts. Everything stop and everything is logged off. So even if you are caught, its nearly impossible for you to die at 30mil ehp. I shouldn’t have to explain this.

Don't reply with them here because that would be silly.

But if you open up the launcher. you can click add account. It will ask you to enter your username and password for the account you want to use, enter them there.  
---
To save you time in the future too you can have the launcher remember those details so you can just click play and hey presto you're in the game.

You can also add multiple accounts and set them all to launch in a group., just be sure they are all Omega or else only the Omega accounts will launch.

We see that alot of you are importing your fittings into our database (thank you for that!). But we also see that they are all private.
---
It could be that you are just testing our system or because the system is not clear enough.
---
**This is how it works:**
---
**Eye** = Public, when you click on it you will make the fitting ***private***
---
**Eye (with slash)** = Private, when you click on it you will make the fitting ***public***
---
**Users** = Its published with your name, when you click on it you will make the fitting ***anonymously***
---
**Incognito user** = Anonymously, when you click on it you will publish it with **your name**
---
Also added this to the post itself. But we really need the public fittings ;)

Regardless of the validity of the request any fc will kick a pilot arguing on a fleet.
---
Stream sniping isn't really that bad until you start getting into battleships and larger groups. Even then you have a few tricks up your sleeve to deal with it, and there's only so much damage they can do when you're expecting it
---
If Eve is one of the only games you are playing and you lose the spark or motivation to play, then you shouldn't continue to log in and attempt to recapture that magic. This is the problem when Eve is your only game and you become almost trapped playing it when in reality you don't have to.
---
If a lack of money isn't the issue, then feel free to explore anything that catches your eye on Steam or that you have seen on Twitch or wherever. You're more likely to get a natural interest in playing Eve again when you take a break, play other games and come back when you want to, not when you have to.

EVE University Headquarters may be located in a high security system but they do have several campuses (headquarters) in various systems to cover all aspects of New Eden (except sov null) . They have Hi-Sec Campus, Low-Sec Campus, Null-Sec Campus and Wormhole Campus. They also have specialized communities like Incursion Community and Mining Campus. You can also experience how to live in a hisec island (where you have to take route through low/null sec systems to reach there) by joining Solitude Campus.   
---
As a former member of EVE University I can say that EVE University is one of the best corporations (let alone starter corporation) out there in New Eden. They may have disadvantages (strict rules about neutrality, not having a sovereign system and etc) but they do have many advantages as well such as;

Supporting New capsuleers with Skillbooks and Full SRP for Doctrine Ships
---
Friendly environment
---
Basic Corporation Services (Buyback, Blueprint Library)

and PUBLIC Lectures

It’s too complex of an idea and you add no value to the proposition.

I was a member of EVE University and a member of their High-Sec Campus for a long time. I can easily say that your claim about not undocking against wartargets is wrong and misleading. We always try to take the fight whenever possible when wartargets come to our HQ system. We definetly fight back and we do counter-offensive operations against wartargets too. Check the AAR (After Action Report) section of the EUNI Forums. You will find them illuminating. You can also check Reddit for EUNI's operations against wartargets. So we also learn how to survive wars and fight back.

I though the correct way is help the loser just enough that when one of them dies the other can be one shotted.
---
are you sure about that

Star Trek reference?

Imagine being a dick to someone who’s fcing for the first time in 2019.

#RORQUAL NERF.

no way to multibox them - who i am kidding ......

See you all there !

Lol, you combing through my post history because you’re mad I called you out on your retarded Xenuria post?
---
t3c's can't run drone 10/10s anymore, PLEASE CCP 
---
Please fuck shit up. Please rorq nerf or supers/titans. 
---
If you really aren't enjoying it then there is no point, go play something else you do enjoy. or try something in eve you haven't tried before.
---
Rip Carriers
---
It’ll make their space farmville all over again.
---
Hf logging into a hic
---
i would love it, simply to experience old versions of the game, versions i never played but only saw cruddy 240p videos about 
---
I'd learn the basics in high sec first.
---
Then go join horde and rat in a vexor or VNI.
---
Nothing teaches you the game mechanics required to stay aware and alive faster than ratting in horde.
---
Please Nerf Rorqual, Munnin, Ferox.... Hard
---
Please Balance Navy and Pirate ships. 
---
Thank you. 
---
So Griffin Navy Issue will not be useless anymore?
---
Its tied to time mining and rats. The fuck are you on about? Use the space.
---
Just adapt :)
---
Holy shit how can someone be this dumb
---
You need a goal. Find a personal goal, find a corp which aligns with that goal and adopt the corp goals. 
---
We think in stories. If there is no story, there is no drive. 
---
I'm not sure if this is a good thing, I could be fired if I orgasme at work.
---
Wewlad this guy is bad at NIPs
---
Write down the things you normally do when you login and actually undock, write it all down.
---
Now make a second list of the things you can do in EvE that you don't do, does not matter if its something you don't enjoy, have never tried, just assumed you wont like just write it all down.
---
Now take your first list and burn it, grab your second list of the things you don't do and pick something, roll a dice, close your eyes and point it don't matter, just pick something on the list and make it your mission to go do it, don't stop till you'v had success,.
---
You will either exhaust all the things and finally win eve for real, or you will discover something that's fun that for the longest time you thought would be crap. either way you win in the end.
---
I have no idea who u are
---
\&gt; -  Minor *text* fixes 
---
Hah, just reported this same thing last night... http://imgur.com/ftXYtaf
---
Context, please? 
---
If there is a camp on a HS get some tornadoes and blap something before it can jump through and then warp off.  Repeat as necessary. 
---
Are you guys seriously recommending a seemingly very new player to go solo mine in null sec with a rorq?
---
Has he even been outside high sec?
---
RIP drone boat ratting, now you have to manually tell your drones to shoot.
---
Yes.
---
funny enough is that this will not affect VNI in any fucking way ... ccp is just hopeless as shit, instead of removing autoaggro on drone boats ...
---
Second half of the week so it’ll probably be out today.
---
I'd rather a T2 or T3 Battleship based off Hyperion/Maelstrom etc.
---
Something that has a type of Siege mode, a point defense mode, and a travel/speed mode.
---
Go ahead, gotta catch me first. If and only if you do, ill just wait a few days or a week and do it again. You can’t do shit about it.
---
Nerf panic not rorqual! (rorq is fine panic is not)
---
This game has a lot to offer community wise.
---
4 years ago I was really down, I am not a suicidal person but a chain of events in 2015/16 really hit me in the guts hard. In a short timespan I lost my job just to get the news my beloved Grandma that partly raised me was going to die of lung cancer (although she never smoked her whole life) within the next few months. At the same time the Basketball Club I had founded 15 years ago and built up towards a 120 people organisation with 1st team in highest amateur league and and 5-6 youth teams had financial problems and started to crumble under personal differences and egoisms. Also one of my best childhood friends I built up this Basketball Club with was a big part of the problems, starting meth at near 40 and going fully nuts (like stealing money from a club that had none). With everything tumbling down I still tried to be a good grandson, and took care of grandma daily 24/7 (unemployed now) until she died in my arms. On her last conscious day 3 days before she died I took a break, to work at an event in the city my Basketball club took part in for free 8 hrs, to gather some money for the broke club, so I only saw her when I brought her to bed that day. I totally retreated to my flat and had no motivation at all, and EVE was my only vent that days.
---
During that time I had one great guy from Australia (hey GG o/) that spend my nights in Germany with me on comms. we talked about a lot of things, unrelated to EVE or my current issues. That really helped me to keep going and rise up again. 
---
I found a new job, that really suits me and pays well, moved out of the town that had so many bad memories for me now and people I did not wanted to see anymore. Moved into a really nice and quite luxurios appartement, focussed on my few true friends that I had neglected for the years all my energy went into my basketball club. I am a quite happy person now ...
---
And then there was time to payback all that, as we got the horrific news, that our australian mate lost his son 8 years old suddenly due to a blood cloth in the brain area. So it was our turn to support him and give him a mental pillow he could fill with tears. On the nights we talked we gained some knowledge of what his son was like and what he liked and from that we created the idea of a worldwide memorial on his funeral day. So many of our group (back then with german backbone but also many Russians, few Americans, an irish goblin etc.) bought balloons in his favourite colors blue&amp;gold, attached pictures of him and farewell messages and let them fly all over the world. We sent our vids &amp; pics to him and he was like "wow". A personal facebook site was created as memorial for his son, with all thes condolences and many pictures from happier days. 
---
Writing this down, someone must be cutting onions nearby.
---
So I urge you to let stupid ingame narratives not hinder you in treating the other players as human beings too. You might make someones life much better or even save it.
---
Dont worry u wont mine a lot from today little panda:) 
---
Guys.. what ever skill I just spent months training into will the the one that gets nerfed.. that's just how it always is..
---
Limit of 15 excavators per anom at once, Delve on suicide watch. 
---
CCP doesn't have the balls to take away the Rorqual PANIC mod.
---
have you attempted to talk to us ? we also take every fight we get, and will honour arrangements before fights. sometimes we blob, sometimes we get blobbed. next time you see us, hit us up. i personally find even numbered honour brawls the most enjoyable, and we do do those if approached
---
Looks like a fun fight.
---
NDA
---
I get it. A 40 ship fleet is a lot to keep track of. That's why I would suggest that people be a little more accommodating and maybe not demand stupid stuff for petty, personal political, SJW, or virtue-signalling reasons. I think they succeeded in alienating this guy from WTM and possibly Eve if he was not very invested/new.
---
We all want a healthy Eve community. Petty tyranny and SJW speech codes can only serve to destroy the Eve player base. It is toxic and people in authority should realize that. 
---
We’ve heard you loud and clear. We’ve dropped the speed and increased the time for damage ramp up on Triglavian ships. We also feel that T3Cs are still too flexible, so we’ve removed the ability to refit or repackage them. We’ve also been closely tracking fleets across New Eden, and have realized HACs are used again, so we’ve increased fitting costs on ADCUs while decreasing the fitting room on all HACs. 
---
Finally, we think that capacitor warfare can be too oppressive, particularly to new players, so we’re removing the utility high on Dreads. 
---
I’m sure there are some cool skins in the store for you to buy and look at while you spin?
---
I have 2 days left on med auto cannon spec V.
---
I dare ccp to make them worse.
---
yes it is - there is a public discord - where we welcome streamers and friends of steamfleet - in fact i think you just joined :)
---
cant wait to see the paste cost of a a 98% heated capital trig gun 
---
I mostly used EvE as a paid chat client with fancier graphics until I finally quit...
---
Do you believe in miracles also?
---
we dont think its elite pvp. we are a social corp above anything else, so we do stuff with ALL members online. sometimes its a roam, sometimes its black ops. and sometimes its hs camping, because itd that kind of day where we just wanna relax and chat together. this is absolutely not because we wanna roflstomp newbs with 30 t3s (although that is fun occasionally), but because "it might be mean to drop 30 ships on 5 dudes, you 20 guys on comms are excluded from participating" is not a practical way of managing a socially oriented corp.
---
No droneratting allowed?
---
The funny part is that whatever CCP nerf to mining do now ... will just boost goons as every one else will have hard times to catch up. 
---
Rorqual panic only to subcapital mining ships around it not to the rorqual itself. 
---
Soo.. Start skilling cloak.. Now!! :D
---
I hope for your sake they get buffed
---
Maybe all those #CCPFalconChallenge posts weren't the best idea?
---
That's not what OPs post is about but nice strawman.
---
Probably several pages of 1 m/s speed tweaks for t1 frigates 
---
I want to believe tho
---
If in doubt, medium pulse spec V is next in the queue.
---
Yeah because it's not like bots can control drones or anything
---
And that is why God invented sitting tethered and watching the free reps while giggling. 
---
I don't know maybe you just leave the fleet
---
combat ceptors will get d-scan immunity i hope

---
Minor tweak: skill injectors will continue to be in the game
---
How does Steam subscription work? It looks like it's half the price of normal subscription in my currency, but it says "pay 56PLN now and 33 recurring every month", is there a first time fee? Does it occur every time you buy a different subscription?
---
Also, I started playing yesterday on normal account, so is it worth it to reroll on Steam? Do I have to repeat the tutorial? 
---
Gobbins did bend something, wasn't him or the knee. ;-)
---
Needs a palatine keepstar worth of nanite to repair.
---
Everyone spouts this, but not nerfing it is also a boost to goons and everyone else will have a hard time catching up either way.
---
Goons were the first group to optimise their playstyle to the new features and due to this, managed to far outpace every group in the game. Not balancing the game based on the fact that they have out produced everyone won't help other groups catch up, it will just speed the economic implosion up
---
No. But I believe in tooth fairy and santa...
---
I can afford 1 over-heated cycle and then I'm going to need SRP.
---
OH SHIT maybe he just saw the "\*plzz buff pilgrim just a wee bit...\*" post in b/t all his photoshops.
---
The world became a better place when they became useless tbh 
---
shitposters are the real mvp
---
His tweet doesn't imply that it will be out this week. In fact, reading in context, it sounds like it's something he'll be working on for the rest of this week (i.e. the copyediting and formatting).
---
I'd love for it to be out on Friday, but I'd also like us all to not lose our shit as a community if it isn't lol.
---
Change: one can not move items to asset safety after citadel lost it's shield.
---
Minor tweak: after citadel destruction all items moving to asset safety with 20% fee.
---
corax going to be usable?????
---
You have a grace period of like 3-4 seconds. So unless you are logging \_lots\_ of accounts, you can do it manually pretty easily.
---
I don't say don't balance the game.      
---
Like frigates doing damage to capitals or supers - total nonsense.      
---
It is like a guy with a 9mm shooting a tank. 
---
Triglavian capitals. Please stop I can only get so erect
---
Change: Cyno inhibs instantly snuff out active cynos within it's vicinity when fully anchored.
---
🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽

We love you man! Whenever good guy CCP Devs get mentioned you're usually on the top of the list! Standing in front of the camera is never easy, especially when you know it's gonna be THIS audience watching. Tip of the hat, you did really great. Hope the growing of the community team will go well.   
---
PS: Say hi to guard and mimic from me please.

PPS: Whisper "bombers bar skins" each time you walk past the skin-design team please. :D   
---
downvoted for 'ergo' upvoted for 'super'
---
*Minor tweak* : Anchoring time 5 min
---
Cyno inhib suppression range is changed to 5 km.
---
Sorry for the late reply! 
---
 
---
"SF Spectre Fleet" is the ingame channel. 
---
The website is https://spectrefleet.com/
---
50
---
Tbh, I'd be okay with this.
---
I like how 2 people already failed the thread.
---
Maybe a little extreme but maybe something like 50km would still be viable
---
hey guys look I'm a CSM I'm important and I know what's happening before you guys :) 
---
- the judge
---
Nerf PANIC or I call BS.

Forgot to say, it doesn't prevent cynos anymore.

😂
---
As in lighting new cynos?
---
&gt; Minor tweak: after citadel destruction all items moving to asset safety with 20% fee.
---
Isn't it like, already the case ?
---
So...what are you training?
---
I'm both excited and scared shitless. 
---
I'm willing to be it's going to take a pretty decent nerf.
---
I think that should read: 
---
TFW POSPY Brings piles in more numbers than 90% of WH Corps out there. 
---
Mods please remove this if it counts as a shitpost. But I had to prove to the community that Mar5y has steered to the right way and stoppen input broadcasting. /s
---
Honestly this is one of the updates I'm looking forward to. It's been way too long since the last notable balance pass. Let's just hope we don't do get something that seems pretty half-assed like adding a light drone Bay to the zealot
---
have you adjusted your resolution once you changed to borderless window? It should fill your monitor completely when having the right resolution, and will always keep your window open in the background
---
“We need more wood ma-lord”
---
I like the idea of the PANIC module providing a defensive boost to subcap mining ships rather than the rorqual, but I would seems more like detrimental to the subcam mining ships than anything else, since self-tackling subcap is pretty much guarantee their death (considering they are generally guarantee death anyway)
---
Sure, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. However, with the same playing field, there's at least a possibility. When the doors are shut behind you, though, you have NO possibility. Which would you prefer?
---
yes
---
We've awoken the Beast!
---
We Didn't Listen!
---
and ffs give fighter mechanic to excavators ....
---
How about this, appears to be a bit Orientalist. Look it up. 
---
local immunity pls
---
Fixed window for life man. I’ll never go back to full screen for eve or windowed
---
Who?
---
Did anyone else read the title as “anus player”?
---
lol since when does that keep GSM from leaking ?
---
just finished titan 5 on one, currently almost finished DD operations 5, capital ships 5 on another just done..
---
&gt;Make sorting options and columns individual for each Overview tab
---
try to fuck that one up
---
Feel free to keep overheating, it makes my profit margins from producing repair paste look fucking good!
---
Not faster, just easier with literally no risk. I used to quad box frigs, having 2 frigs on 2 burners at the same time
---
hmm, the drug is called "reality check" you get it if you already attended such events
---
This is so retarded it actually hurts
---
so, ASMR?
---
Hey, bro... I make between 30 to 40 bill a month from trading, probably 3 bill from exploration, and maybe a bill from super ratting--when I am super bored--because other than when Mar5meca dread bomb fails in Delve, I've got not much used for my damn super. 
---
In other words, I don't really need to adapt, that is not to say there aren't going to be others here whose primary source of income is super ratting that aren't going to feel this. The only reason I posted above is to give a realistic analysis of what spawn changes will affect in the game when it comes to those people. 
---
Frankly, I am just annoyed at myself for skilling into a super at all--regardless of the ratting changes--because I not only skilled into mine the hard way, I have \*literal\* perfect skills in the damn thing, including all of the Fighter skills to 5. 
---
Meh
---
Ok, makes sense now, if you have to split up atteention more safety is a clear plus
---
Stop with that shit.
---
I cant be walking around with a boner at work.
---
I don't understand what you mean or where you got the "frigates doing damage to capitals or supers" from, that has not once been mentioned in this post
---
Overtiew tabs now limited to maximum of one(1)
---
/u/hypeswarmfederation we found your new biggest threat ;)
---
I'd prefer the game to be balanced regardless. The current status quo does nothing but harm the game. It may seem unfair to some that goons have had all this time to turtle up and farm but there is nothing that can be done about that unless CCP were to somehow penalise you guys to try and balance it again. They won't do that, nor do I think they should
---
Guns have always taken shitloads of paste to repair
---
This isn't in any way new
---
My fellow goon, if you really think supers are what they used to be, then you clearly have not been playing this game as long as I have. There was a time, when these ships were nearly invincible gods of the field, completely immune to ewar and absolutely invincible in low-sec. 
---
Then there was that time when they were super FAXs in addition to DPS machines. 
---
Now they are the poor man's alternative to a Titan, who are at times purposefully excluded from certain ops because there are enough Titans they aren't needed, and a gazillion fighters cause tye die and DCs.   
---
maybe join a small tight knit group on the borders of space where everyone needs to help each other to make it...

Change: Being pointed on an Ansiblex (w/e) they are called prevents you from taking the Ansiblex.
---
that's 900 paste to rep ~20% damage on a small gun. pretty sure it's a bug
---
I yesterday rolled my C5 static with my thanatos, upon return in my own hole i was immediately on my fortizar, not having to warp back.
---
Aura: The entire nanite paste GDP of New Eden is insufficient to do that.
---
You: \[Sweats\]
---
Yeah, don’t overheat the Trig guns unless you’ve invested in a nanite paste farm. 
---
ITT two bloated NIP-heavy alliances call each other out about NIPs on one monitor while rorq mining on the other.
---
+1 can relate, same for me.
---
ITS ABOUT TIME
---
My expections:
---
* Rorquals now use fighter mechanics
---
* Capital ships can no longer access Empire space (that includes low sec)
---
drugs
---
he's not
---
You lived in Mandaria eh? Or was it Cantonia? Or maybe the DPRK?
---
I understand that, but see my other response. People can internalize racist or eurocentric stereotypes. Really, the term we are looking for is Orientalism. 
---
And as an analogy, if I said the majority of obese racist people in the world are Americans, and I know because I am an American, I would hope you would call shinanigans on me as well. PS. In my experience with games, most of the people employing 'hacks' haven't been Chinese, they have been teenagers from North American and European countries. Should I now attempt to develop an explanation about how culture in capitalist countries rewards cheating, and therefore we have a capitalist cheating videogame culture? 
---
I could. 
---
Roll back to 2012
---
Ecm bonus replaced by bonus to large blasters, no fitting changes
---
Doesn't your corpname say you post good? Bet it lies on the other statement too ...
---
Pish posh, with your baseless accusations. The Imperium has never had a CSM member removed for leaking. Other organizations, well, have less rosy histories.
---
Beep boop new lines of code accepted
---
That would kill the game...
---
What are you on about? 
---
Total removal of local.
---
If this happens, it might be the thing that makes me win Eve. 
---
Is there a way to test PVE fits on sisi? I know you can buy crates of abyssal filaments, but anomalies don't seem to spawn at all.
---
Make bumping illegal in Highsec
---
*gigx urge to cut off intensifies*
---
I'd say a max of 2 minutes &amp; 30 minutes at lvl 5 skill.
---
Unless it has to deal with nerfing citadel spam, citadel mechanics and removing panic. Idgaf
---
He has many names.  Some call him Marshy.  Some Mar5hy.  Some Don Trolleoneonoelloenoneeonee.  But mostly he's called "+ the usual camper".
---
Oh it's only at 20%, I missed that. Although it is probably balanced around the equivalent of several guns, I doubt it'd be that much.
---
It'd be interesting to see how much 90% damage would need in paste...
---
The Astero model has been updated, and now has a warp animation
---
Without crunching numbers, which would be fairly easy, it would likely depend on which race. For instance, Amarr drones are the tankiest with most of their HP being in Armor, having high resists to EM/Therm. So for Amarr i bet the faction drone would win. Then compare that to Gallente drones whose HP is mostly in hull and has no resists. In that case I'd expect the T2 variant to win. Caldari probably faction and Minmatar a toss up.
---
All that said, this isn't a particularly useful exercise. Depending on your build and objectives, sometimes you'll want the damage and other times prefer the drone buffer. 
---
* The Griffin Navy Issue is now a faction fighter with strong jamming capabilities.
---
*Nice.*
---
Join comms, if you're in a corp. Chat with others, see if they are doing anything of interest to you (e.g. spergy gatecamping, welp roams, kitchen sink fleets, etc.). If not, suggest something and see where it goes.
---
Otherwise, jump clone to Jita and try your hand at scamming or station trading?
---
So the launcher will work
---
On one hand, yay balance update.
---
On the other hand, the "mother of all balance posts" sounds like it's going to be huge sweeping changes, which is bad for balance passes. It doesn't take more than a subtle nudge to affect the meta. Huge changes, especially if there are many at a time, make it impossible to know how the game will be affected.
---
Knowing CCP, they'll accidentally make it better.
---
It’s something they say in age of empires :p
---
Sounds like r/TheMonkeysPaw/ 
---
Just having it in the game is dumb as fuck with as tanky as they are anyway.
---
In the end it doesn't matter anyway, nobody in this game is defeated due to running out of ships, you break morale not wallets.
---
/me takes notes. ;)
---
inflated prices huh?  I expect this will be mentioned in the coming 'balance' dev blog.
---
A change that makes you actually the game would make you stop playing? interesting.
---
The muninn just got good
---
Oh i agree it should 100% be removed no ships has anything like this. but this is CCP so I'm going to underestimate the change and be surprised if they remove the module. 
---
You can rep for free instantly inside the structure as well, usually faster even with session change timer
---
So, buy skill books now?
---
minor tweak: tethering available on ansiblexes
---
10% across the board?  Titan skill from 5.5b to 6b.
---
This is from TQ, not from SISI.       
---
"Price changes are here!"
---
This is TQ, not SiSI- changes where made at DT. 
---
Minor Tweak - Undocks from Jita are now queued. You are number 5000 in the queue
---
No lowsex cap blobs?
---
You know what would be funny? If people would buy tons of skillbooks now, but CCP in the end decides not to increase the price of certain skillbooks.
---
TBH expected bit more, it should be bit more for this book.    
---
But tbh it looks like more or less 10% price increase on more expensive books that really matter. 
---
Ouch 
---
"Triglaivian spool time is 2.5 minutes but when fully spoiled, the capital can do 40k damage with two entropic radiation sinks. "
---
What hurts worse is I can see it happening
---
Yeah it's annoying but the upside is you're only overheating one module, meaning the heat can stay on a long, long time. Dock up at structure for free repps.
---
Oh, ship has sailed then. 
---
Default overview has now been replaced with something more useable.
---
Change went to TQ not SISI - this is why i named it "Changes are here" but now i think i should include the TQ in there.      
---
No, this isn't balanced around the several gun thing, it is just a drawback of the weapon system. They can overheat an extended time but the cost of overheating is the large amount of paste to repair. It will basically force you to just tether up and wait. 
---
TIL that getting caught doing something wrong and not doing it are the same thing
---
looooool
---
Far cry and red dead for a little rpg shooter pallet cleanser 
---
*Working as intended*
---
This is obviously going to be a devblog filled with all the Falcon memes we have made over the weeks.  
---
I took 3 titan books , 2 carrier and capital ships expecting much, much bigger changes like a week ago.     
---
So i think i saved 3 bil probably. 
---
But are those changes live now or just planned for the next patch?
---
There used to be a term, what was it, HTFU
---
You may need it
---
I went on a spree 2 years ago and injected almost every skillbook I could get my hands on.
---
Didn't get titan or super skillbooks, but I have 0 interest in them. I think I'm all sorted

Some of us have a full time job with school and kids also. I only have a few hours each week to actively play and do what I want. The rest of the time I vni rat while I do homework so I can use that isk to buy shit to have fun and go pew pew. I would rather spend my time doing what I want and not grinding isk. I could buy Plex to fund my shenanigans, but I already pay for my subs and I have other things that take priority. 
---
think already live. checked evemarketer for titan skillbooks and they are at 6bil. some people selling it for less than that though
---
o7 fly safe and take care of yourself
---
Given that CCP (well, everyone) pays about four times as much more attention to us than everyone else, you can assume that if we were, we'd get caught.
---
RIP Snuff.
---
Ahh, scratch my comments than. When I usually see hoboleaks, I associate it upcoming changes...
---
If this is TQ then i guess they are live.

---
I bet one of the goon CSM members leaked him some information.           
---
^(who i am kidding, right? RIGHT?)                 
---
Was a fun fight, can't remember the last time I lost 3 ships in one day. 
---
You cant change overview anymore, everybody has to use the new default
---
Bumping now gives both ships a suspect timer.
---
Rorq, titan and fighters nerf
---
It defaults to using half the screen and can not b resized.
---
GSM already know, goons already preparing way ahead of everybody else... news at eleven.
---
If only
---
all they need to do is disable activating cyno while in panic and vise versa.
---
I would believe that if I hadn't had once been in goons and know how well critical information is compartmentalized. You can't get caught if you capitalize on leaks slowly and don't tell loud mouths you are doing it. By no means am I accusing anyone of anything, but you're crazy if you think just by having the name "Goonswarm Federation" makes you a target for anyone besides r/eve
---
Compar Anomaly respawn ... 2h ... :P
---
Could it be that promised balance pass that faction ships have been waiting for years?! *_*
---
Make it only affect friendly subcap miners on grid and not the rorq it's self. Still very useful support but not the aids we have.
---
Does it sound like I'm complaining because someone offended me? Or, does it sound like I'm complaining because someone was too easily offended? 
---
I would be ok with a titan need ;)
---
But they still managed to get it wrong. 
---
Who's this op who doesn't like to have any fun?
---
They are upgrading the exploration and hacking mechanics to use the Planetary Production UI.
---
Change: Supercarriers can no longer use light fighters and LR FiBos have diminishing application to cruisers and below.
---
Predict a lot of hype before it comes out. Followed by a gigantic "meh" afterwards.
---
Nobody of importance
---
Turn off your computer, go outside.
---
You forget and load a heavy fighter into the wrong loading bay. Your super carrier has now exploded and the price of SC have sky rocketed due to piloting errors. 
---
minor tweak: ansiplex can now point to several destinations
---

[Raw skillbook changes data if you want it.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-iCrXYSZFOx7gn-h_2c8XRxxy693fVUvlUnwneLUuHk/edit#gid=0) (thanks to ficti0n for the idea)
---
And other orgs don't compartmentalize? In that regard, we aren't special. However, in other ways, we are. If you think CCP isn't looking at Delve and isn't looking at how we do things, you're insane. They have to -- we're pushing at the raw edges of the sandbox, seeing where they break. Suffice it to say that there is zero room for us to leak without it being fairly apparent. Besides, why expose yourself to stupid risks by leaking when you can just send the dudes that you'd want to hear the leaks to Iceland in the first place?
---
That is not something that we are implementing at the moment. However as some prices just went up today, and the Character Sheet applies a 30% increase on top of that, you may still be well within your profit necessary margins. I'd recommend investigating the skill on TQ.
---
Change: Wormholes are closed.
---
Tweak: Statics change weekly, not when rolled.
---
I just use the faction warfare window. It shows all valid faction warfare systems.
---
The change is in today I'm afraid.
---
A change that makes the game more tedious without any changes to the reward?
---
Yeah that is definitely a change to quit 0vee if your main income source/activity is ratting.
---
the guy you feed and try and camp
---
Minor tweak: You cannot anchor another inhib in the system, as long as one is already active.
---
That is the point. You made it sound like you forgot about that.
---
Rimworld. I've heard it referred to as a "war crimes simulator". I am testing how far I can go with that theory.
---
Tweak: Cyno inhib now takes 3000m3.
---
It's fun to bait people into thinking you missed the ECM changes and then hit em with dualweb TD.
---
Yeah, making the panic just something you can pop to stop your subs from getting bombed would be nice.
---
Lmao too bad ur point is equal to my IQ? Learn to code friend... 
---
Anyways turns out a solo machariel could easily force of a solo retribution with light drones well before it dies.
---
And also of this is so easy and so common please link me all these killmails that I must have been missing.  I would like to see a solo frigate killing a solo battleship, at least 40 times in the last 12 hours, because it's so common u know?
---
Minor tweak: Individual overview options will only be saved temporarily until downtime.
---
Minor Tweak: they will still be able to reproduce.
---
Tweak: Remove collisions from the game.
---
2nd one is dumb as fuck and would basically make moving caps literal aids worthy if just quitting the game.
---
Minor Tweak: Warping to 0 to a gate means you will land not closer then 5000m and you can only jump within 1000m.
---
Tweak: Supercarriers now use gain a bonus per level to fighter application and damage vs. subcaps.
---
*cringe* oh god my heart (but it kinda undoes the Change :P)
---
&gt; Emo Knight
---
I know, just wanted to make a low effort joke :)
---
Tweak - Super can now use Heavy &amp; Sentrys along side HF and LRF
---
Meh, you skill get NPC or near-NPC price. 10% margins up is good.
---
Worst case scenario everyone overbought and some bigger fish is willing to eat literally *all* your skillbooks at NPC -5% for a longer position.
---
You can construct a stargate over both ends of a wormhole to keep it open longer
---
Sorry.. had to follow the rules! They could just revert it to old style.. but I truly fear what someone multiboxing supers all with 25 drones set to assist on a trigger man in a gate. Even with a max of 2 supers.. that's stupid murder and people would do it. Or just make super size afk VNI.
---
You aren't supposed to provide your own Tweaks. 
---
Tweak - Wormhole systems get smaller and smaller until they disappear forever. 
---
brutal, love it
---
You cant break an NDA you've never signed 
---
"Minor" tweak: collision damage tho
---
Tweak - Both stargates explode in both system on the first jump destroying everything in either system.
---
love those salty ecm falcons after the nerf
---
If the pve was more engaging I then I wouldn’t be afk. But as of now I use afk ratting and pi to fund my fun. I’m not a mouthbreathing cellar dweller that has all day to make isk.
---
AYYY lmao
---
Inb4: 10% increased falloff for medium autocannons
---
Change: BLOPS gain covert cloak.
---
Do you even play this game or do you only play Bad Post Online
---
Change: Remove panic from Rorquals and change siege cycle to 1 minute.
---
Tweak - Energy from the Cyno is collected and redistributed to the field wiping everything out in 250KM
---
This was leaving a gap between the bottom of the client window and the Taskbar.  OCD said no fucking way to that. 
---
So.. Rorquals will be deleted from the game?
---
Minor tweak: Changes max ship size to frig
---
This would be badass and also game breaking at the same time
---
It could also imply that it's soon to be posted, and that he expects to get absolutely roasted on here + the forums for the next few days...
---
Do a bit of research on the various new-player alliances/corporations  out there, find one that sounds the best to you, and go join. Some really good options are Karma Fleet in Goonswarm, Brave Newbies and Pandemic Horde. Because I'm a Goon I'm biased towards Karma Fleet. They will take day 1 new players or year old players who are looking to make the jump to null, help you get out to our home system, hook you up with free skill books and free PVP ships, show you ways to make good isk your first week, and they even have dedicated mentors and an entire forum section just to helping you learn the game. The Alliance also holds daily training fleets to get you hands on learning with everything from basic fleet PVP to advanced mechanics like flying logistics and interdictors.
---
It took me almost 2 years before I ventured out into the unknown and finally joined a good group of people to play with, and the difference was night and day. There's this myth that EVE is a game. Not true. Its actually a social networking site that just happens to have spaceships thrown as an afterthought.
---
;-P
---
Nice, also biggest change for rorqal book ... so i guess they will not get nerfed so much as players wish. 
---
[Footage of Mar5y in action](https://youtu.be/KlJ8eTuFe9U)
---
TC-KL (Tactically Challenged) is AUTZ, Located in Catch.
---
Change: Unfueled structures no longer have reinforcement periods. You can kill them in one go.
---
Runescape-like random minigame events during Rorqual mining so 90% of the poorly coded bot software fails.
---
Everyone in *my* alliance knows all about everything the CSM is told. ;)
---
(for people who don't know, my alliance is Vote Steve Ronuken for CSM, and consists of me and my multiple personalities)
---
Yo stain guy... I got some information... from a see ess em... about a gate they may impliment, somewhere south, that’s to lowsec. Got isk?
---
can never go wrong with torpedo's. 
---
you deserve upvotes my friend.
---
Add in an additional shield, armor, and structure timer at 50% each
---
If I had a nickle for every game I've seen slowly destroyed by people who don't have time to play a game, and therefore demand that the game cater to their inability to actually play it, I'd have....well not *a lot* of money but I could probably buy like, a smoothie or something.
---
I remember way back somebody did that with some useless BP, having seen it massively increase in price on the test server.  I think he bought 50k of them or something idiotic.  He went all in with all his ISK.
---
Anyway CCP reverted the change for release and he posted a complaint on the forums.  Somebody made a meme of it, built a website with some amusing pictures and a looney theme tune.  I wish I could remember where it was because it was a classic.  This is like... 10 years ago or so.
---
Tweak: Unfueled structures change into a defensive mode increasing their resists by to 90/90/90/90
---
Bumping allowed on undock.
---
Wormholers already brawl with DSTs on field, fuck it. 
---
All Citadel Structure HP amount has now been increased by 5000% regardless if unfueled. 
---
Tweak: Citadels now require 30% less materials to build
---
Some dude chilling in local while I farm havens, not much of a talker.
---
Just have a script that's totally not a bot to spam F.
---
That last line though.. too real for me.
---
Anti-minor tweak: The destructors get LP for a Asset Safety corp, for every Asset safety fee-isk that was paid due to the destruction.
---
too difficult (as in: expensive) for CCP as it would require changes to the physics engine (scary dragons are lurking there).
---
However: it would be sufficient to calculate the time you'd usually need until warp and warp out when that time has passed no matter what.
---
Wasn't there a guy chain panicing to keep his mackinaw fleet invulnerable all the time?
---
revert to before injectors and remove all injected skills from current characters
---
999million SP, per character on an account, right?
---
You can kill the rorqual with this change, thus break the invul. 
---
Industrial cap skill +100%
---
Change: Crimewatch: Remove the fleet hangar looting exploit in highsec
---
Tweak - Injected skillpoints are removed at random and at random amounts over the course of 6 months.
---
15 drones again on all ships that have enough bandwith
---
That's already at v!
---
why is it such a big deal that only gallente gets specialized haulers? all industrials are just large boxes no matter the race, and in the end they all do the same thing. you just train into whatever gets the job done.
---
wat?
---
Change: cloaking devices and cyno generators can’t be fitted at the same time in a ship
---
I was more like - goons don't have 2 csm members (i think, can be wrong).        
---
1 CSM is long standing higsec representative , other is elo... hmmm i guess Elo got leaks from goon representatives that don't 'have to' like him.         
---
Capital Industrial Ships increased by 500m/100% i approve, but it aint enough!
---
Tweak - Cyno is now a low slot item.
---
Checkmate: A turd is more useable than the default overview.
---
MAXHYPEREDPEN420BLAZEITSHITPOSTINGCTA GO GO GO
---
So basically no difference compared to now.
---
rorqual nerf super nerf rorqual nerf super nerf rorqual nerf super nerf rorqual nerf super nerf rorqual nerf super nerf rorqual nerf super nerf rorqual nerf super nerf rorqual nerf super nerf 
---
Supers and Titans can no longer dock in Keepstars 
---
Tweak - All ship have in-built cyno generators and beacons which are always active.
---
I would mostly love to see a decent range of subcapital balance, just to mix up doctrines a bit and give some of the ships that rarely get used a bit more of a viable role. 
---
All of you traders better stock up on hull reps.
---
I have been banking on hull rep buff for 4 years.... CCPLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ I have like 30b in hull mods.
---
I think "interesting 2nd half of the week" implies that it comes out around the middle of the week.
---
Game needs ton more than that.
---
For those who can't be bothered to listen throught these files:
---
Elo want's to focus on Nagalfars because he has heard that there is a balance change coming which favors them against TEST supers. He then mentions that said change will happen in the next two months.

@ 2:15 with 10 or seconds of context.
---
Miner tweak: You can now mine ansiblex gates to gradually take them apart.
---
Please don't forget about the poor Widow...
---
Miner tweak; bumping compresses ore in hold.
---
Better be nerfing injectors.
---
minor tweak: all drone bandwidths are now multiples of 7
---
SAVAGE!
---
I’m not saying cater to my ability to play it. My way of making money for fun is through afk means.Then when I am actively playing which is about every weekend I can make the most of my time. Also, when I’m afk I’m usually semi afk. I’m at my computer and I’ll alt tab and talk to corp mates while I type up papers for one of my classes. In all honesty I probably wouldn’t leave because I have way to much time invested at this point.
---
Minor Tweak: injectors still exist and are used to purchase upgraded clone grades, which are reintroduced. ;)
---
Change: tethern no longer exists during armor reinforce and structure/armor repair phases.
---
How do you know to check these changes on that site so soon after they go live?
---
Supers &amp; Titans are still tethered when attacking. 
---
And there for new and exciting
---
my body is ready
---
Minor Tweak: the offspring are inbred. 
---
It too can impling that they will never release it, merely formatting it and put the files in a secure safe inside a secret underground bunker fill with deathtraps and combat drones. Then they gonna toss the key of the safe at the bottom the Atlantic where the Cloverfield monsters resides in large numbers alongside of bitter Collosal Squids
---
All of this because why the fuck not ?
---
Tweak: Skill points now train at a half the rate for every 50M skill points you have
---
I mean, it is Chevis "Special" Preston :P
---
Graph for what?
---
I don't think there is an alternative for what you are looking for.
---
EVE Overmind is a great fairly unknown website tho, just like EVE Eye.
---
Byeeee
---
Sorting overview columns will now include a 5-second animation and loud, un-turn-off-able sound effect.
---
Minor tweak: session change
---
minor tweak: gate/station guns now shoot suspect.  Jita 4-4 gains 30 guns.
---
Expect it to be made public during evesterdam 
---
This is true, we were told this in Imp as well. 
---
Change: Widow receives meaningful combat bonuses, axes ECM.
---
Change: all modules have small chance to fail each time they are used. Chance increases each time they are repaired. Higher increase if they are repaired with paste.
---
I heard they fixed the respawn rate of a low-sec gate to stain from 20 years to never.
---
Wouldn't that just make rorqual mining "safer" in that it would be harder to boosh/bomb drones? You could F1 cycle lasers, then Q control them to sit next to the rorq for instant recalls. Or maybe I'm missing something.
---
Fuck should probably buy all my cooking super toons still books now
---
Minor tweak: Ships with fleet hangars are no longer allowed in highsec
---
This is absolute proof that fuzzy is planning ahead to produce more tools to shill his own website which is free with no adverts. Clearly trying to get more page views with that advantage
---
lol thats nothing, should see repair cost of a 98% damaged large. 
---
FC flat out stopped the fleet and forced me to repair in a citadel 2 jumps over.... 
---
Straight theft yo
---
&gt; hey guys look I'm a CSM I'm important and Goons know what's happening before you guys :)
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; the judge
---
FTFY
---
No capitals involved. I call this one fake.
---
Ammo for PLEX. Omni damage type, +50% tracking, +30% DPS
---
Not even close. I said I know rorqs can die. I also said that's not the problem.
---
Change: HAW guns for battleships to blap frigs/dessies
---
Minor tweak: attacking structures in any space now requires a mutual war
---
Yea regular PVE is boring as fuck and I don't have hours to scan out sites to run.
---
oh damn
---
that doesn't really follow
---
Oh shit, that's interesting
---
Hey typos bother the fuck out of me
---
And 95% of active players fail as well because they are bot-aspirants, but not quite as good as bots.
---
Auto cannon falloff too high and tracking off deviation of medium weapon system.
---
In turn to balance we took 15% falloff and 12.5% tracking.
---
If they nuke the panic mod, give me tripple ancillary boosters back, that shit was so friggin fun and trolly.
---
is there an video/image of it somewhere?
---
can't seem to find it and i'm stuck at work for another 5 hours at least :(
---
because every patch he yearns for that lowsec gate to stain obviously
---
I like lowsec for learning pvp. Highsec requires dying usually to get any type of experience. 
---
As someone who has flown with Vastly Outnumbered for a while now, I can say that they are a solid group to play with. I do have my own personal issues with some of them, but the pros "vastly" outweigh the cons. As for the group(s) that felt the need to do something like this, it just shows that they can't beat Vastly or Shoot First straight up. In the end, we are able to get in comms and have fun with each other on a daily basis and that is what drives these people to such an act. It isn't as much about the victory as it is about the experience. That said, the ability to look past superficial things and enjoy people for the diverse mentality they bring to the table sets Vastly Outnumbered apart in many ways from the usual suspects in this game. If you want to trash talk on them, at least stand up and do it to their face. Anyone with the time to develop a site like that would have more than enough time to do something constructive with them. Whether you like them, hate them, or don't give a damn, no one deserves to be attacked by keyboard warriors without at least transparent ownership. Cowardice at its finest imho. Keep doing your thing Vastly, and to hell with the haters.
---
It's all about those sweet patreon bucks. ;) 
---
( /s if it's not glaringly obvious)
---
Wait
---
\------
---
If this devblog comes out and in typical fashion, is for next month's patch... next month is April. Which means, April Fools. This whole devblog could be a lie!
---
Incoming Capital reps now have a very long stacking penalty curve. 
---
lol, that's one way of saying "we won", ignoring everyone in your fleet's but your own alliance's losses
---
Change : Proteus gets 15% bonus speed
---
1.) Did you ever try to manage fighters actively for more than 2 hrs?
---
2.) Did you ever try to actively multibox carriers or supers?
---
3.) Do you think it is possible to input broadcast fighters or does this need a screen captcha script?
---
That would answer your questions ...
---
Because what they mean is go do pvp, not capture plexes.
---
Yep. And for reference, the CSM didn't get to see the changes in advance. Because you just *know* someone is going to accuse us of that.
---
Sounds fun.
---
But- but- this goes against the eve-is-dead /r/eve narrative!
---
Ccp long forgot about this game and only cater to the biased gooncsm, theyve fired all their staff for skinmakers and the koreans are gutting the company and the game is on the decline because the max logged in players is lower than before!!
---
(/s i love balance changes, even when they hurt my playstyle, adapt or die my spacebrothers&amp;sisters)
---
Poor Orca, and poor Deep Space Transports.
---
It actually still will be for now. We have a good plan for it I think but couldn't fit it into this patch :/
---
MOM HE TOUCHED ME
---
In before removing capitals.
---
Minor tweak: Widow no longer has a jump drive.
---
Tweak - Plates now reduce speed by 20% per item. 
---
Minor tweak:all corps now have to choose a FW side.
---
So he broke an NDA he never signed because he's not CSM? right.
---
Change : C6 gets a dual static
---
Minor tweak: Anti-capital guns for frigates/destroyers.
---
Drake master race
---
Rorqual excavators use fighter mechanics. There are also now different kinds of excavators.
---
Change : Jove space is now freely accessible by Capsuleer 
---
I personally sold my super before DT yesterday and invested in DSTs, because the GSM are turning DSTs into the hottest new pvp ship sooner than you think.
---
You heard it here first hecause the GSM isnt just a few greasy nerds that get to suggest stuff to a couple devs, they actually run the whole show down at ccp hq.
---
While I might call you out for being incorrect, or ask for citations, I wouldn't call you a racist or even unamerican. If I called you anything, it would be "wrong".
---
How would that break the game? Genuinely interested in your thoughts
---
🐸🐸🐸
---
Minor Tweak: Will only have 2 rounds no matter what type of gun and reloading takes 3min
---
Triple the cost of Triglavian Heat repair.
---
if you run explo sites, you're basically committed for 5-minute intervals.  It's the least committed form of PVE I can think of, besides manufacturing.
---
https://youtu.be/yNSVYsCsYHo
---
The second static is always to the same J Number and never changes. 
---
would be legit amazing. 
---
tweak: they are visible to everyone on overview and warpable/destroyable
---
GOOD
---
Join us in Pandemic Horde (or Karmafleet or Brave) and see if you like null life.
---
Literally anybody can take out fleets w/us, so you can see if you like FCing. You can scout for some fleets, see if you like that. Fly logi, multibox a swarm of mainline dps/links ships, herd a gaggle of miners/ratters and get paid to do it, scout juicy chains and enable our whalers to snag fun frags, set up your own shipping service, sheet your way through industry, do some spying, etc.
---
EVE: Dementia 
---
Capture sites once in a while, but dont wait 15 minutes, go find a fight, even if its with a local pirate or mission runner.  How people sit in the larger sites is beyond me...oh wait they are LP farmers..
---
Do what you enjoy and don't do the boring stuff ;)  Mix it up to keep the enjoyment going, join a PVP corp, try a bit of WH action, sneak into null in a cloaky ship and annoy the locals...
---
are you sure you’re not a mouth breather cellar dweller
---
I just kind of assume anyone who PVE’s for isk is because if not they’d have a job irl
---
&gt; And other orgs don't compartmentalize? In that regard, we aren't special.
---
Let's agree to disagree. Considering the size of Goons and the larger coalition, it is a testiment to the vetting that gets done there isn't more leaks.
---
&gt; If you think CCP isn't looking at Delve and isn't looking at how we do things, you're insane. They have to -- we're pushing at the raw edges of the sandbox, seeing where they break.
---
I agree here. If you let 40,000 players run unchecked utilizing every overpowered aspect of the game it would spell disaster for the rest of the community. I disagree about one part, I don't think CCP would base all of their balance decisions on one group. 
---
&gt; Besides, why expose yourself to stupid risks by leaking when you can just send the dudes that you'd want to hear the leaks to Iceland in the first place?
---
Isn't that worse though? Going back to pushing the edges of the sandbox, unless the plan is to expose how dangerous a group of players learning about future game changes is. I've never been a fan of the CSM. I think the same result could be achived some other way. 
---
Except talked about since panic came out
---
Yeah I'm aware he was never a CEO . He was probably the most vocal number though. Kinda like the overdose or querns of the Eve FB group. Least he wasn't the stryker guy. The story I was originally told was a decent chunk of SD leaving with him and merging with dark sky, maybe that was incorrect. I've slept around C5 for a while though, dunno why SD seems to be scarce now.
---
Minor Tweak: At least one ice-field will be available now in every system.
---
Honestly that would created some interesting change 
---
People would live in two hole, and look for the best things, i can already see some kind of hole war for that 
---
Ie : C6-&gt;C6 with a static static to a C2-0.0/C5
---
Alternately - All ships have build in cloaking devices
---
minor tweak: panic mode extends to excavators
---
I’m ok with this
---
alternatively - cloaking subsystems are always on on covops capable ships and are part of the ship not an equipment. There is no targeting delay on decloak and you re only decloaked if you target or are targeted or use an offensive aoe moduel 
---
&gt;Having multiple compromises the existing one
---
Well, that really depends on the scope. If you're using the umbrella primarily as a defense of roaming fleets, you don't need a great deal of concentration. If you're expecting an invasion (and let's be honest, there are rarely surprise invasions because of spying) then you need the massive concentration of a single umbrella. I imagine you could stage the smaller umbrellas within range of the staging system so they would be able to mutually support the primary staging fleet.
---
Nags make the most sense for where they are going to tbh. If you are going to be fighting with FRT against the nuRu block and TAPI then having the ability to do selectable damage types and have a decent LR platform the nag is the only real choice.
---
to little, to late
---
Thank you for your service
---
instead of repairing they just apply a repair over time effect on the target ship
---
This is one of the best game communities a person could find. B4r has always been a place for me to vent. Or to help someone in a difficult time. A good group for veterans is called the best of us. Those two groups are the only ones I can think of unless there’s more.
---
Are you in a Corp? Just get on comms but don't log in. Maybe someone's hunting, or being hunted and could use a partner. Maybe someone is mining and could use a friend to kill the rats, or share boosts with. Maybe there's a fleet going out and they need more logi, or someone to fly a dictor.
---
Sometimes it's ok to get sucked into other stuff and just be another number. Usually that leads me to pursue things I then really want and keeps me engaged 
---
God if only
---
Oh noo

Were about. Been doing other things here and there but we've a decent core of dudes :) our corps always been more social than most with real life first sometimes life just gets in the way but we've been hovering around 40-50 active since Christmas on zkill which is fine by me :).
---
Were at 36 this eek though :( need to go out and find some shit to kill tonight I think.
---
Well don't leave us hanging. Just how expensive was the repair bill originally going to be?
---
Some wormhole systems are now permanently linked with mass limited, but mass infinite connections. 
---
Ye, if you're a retard.
---
i recall ending up in a system like this one of my first exploration forays. there were probably 100 bubbles on each gate. it was solid bubbles for 100km in each direction from the gate.
---
Change: cloaking devices now need fuel
---
Minor tweak: all structures/modules can be refueled remotely 
---
Still kinetic locked
---
Okay let me add onto it. The position of the wormhole changes every 30 minutes requiring re-scanning from both sides. 
---
Just look at what items spiked/tanked their prices before today, you’ll get a pretty good idea of whats getting changed and how. Thanks csm
---
&gt; begins flexing REEEEEEEEEEEEE muscles
---
haha i was going to write the same idea (with a 5/10 minutes timer) on this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b0l680/comment_one_change_youd_like_to_see_in_the_huge/eifj3ip/
---
Tweak: Citadels can now receive remote repair effects from pilots.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Please add the Corax to the list of ship to make not-horrible. It is too pretty to not fly. 
---
[Here's the model](https://imgur.com/x51Vu8M.jpg), and the warp animation involves those two antennae at the front of the ship retracting backwards, and the two circles in the mid-section (where the turrets go) flipping over to hide the turrets.
---
Would be fun as fuck: rageroll a hole into enemy staging, build the Death Star-gates and nuke everything in system.
---
Sleeper site waves spawn at gates / belts in Jove space but don't drop loot
---
***Cowabunga it is.***
---
Minor tweak: All pilots are set -10.0 by Jove Empire
---
Enforcer: Added a 25 mb/s, 25 m\^3 drone bay
---
Maybe [Eve-Prism](https://eve-prism.com/)
---
Immensea - Derelik gate confirmed! #hypebois
---
I can live with this 
---
If you are trying to decide which to use, ask yourself two things: 
---
1. Are your drones being shot at and killed? -&gt; Faction for tank
---
2. Are you shooting things with your drones and having dps issues? -&gt;T2 for damage
---
Drones are situational.
---
WIDOW!!!
---
Well they are for *deep* space. 
---
Get out
---
Fuck you
---
There should be options between regular small hauler and gigantic freighter though.
---
Tweak: ships can now refit themselves while having an aggression timer, and without needing to be in range of a mobile depot, refitting service or ship maintenance bay.
---
Don't you know that some people pull up the starmap and only use the overview to play on their potato?
---
Fix: when you warp to a planet to 0 and then try to warp off sometime you will kind of crash into that mini station that I don't know how it is called. Fix that damn thing please, if you're in low/ nullsec/ worm that can be dangerous, and that's also dangerous if you're in hisec and your sec status is low, concord will not attack you while your warp in active but still you can't either move from that shaky situation
---
I am a mouth breather yes. But I moved out of my moms basement at the young age of 35 so I am no longer a cellar dweller.
---
Holy fuck this sounds awesome.
---
This makes me m o i s t
---
Well, I guess if Nags are getting a big benefit in this dev blog coming out, this can the the evidence Falcon said  we needed to go after the CSM :P
---
By not trying to be 'elite pvpers' and have a culture of 'fuck krabs/krabbing' for years.
---
Basically goons was one of the only groups that didn't actively demonize making isk. So everyone who was interested in the industry/pve side of the game went to goons.
---
1.) Yes, both carriers and supers in PvE and PvP
---
2.) Only in PvP
---
3.) I have no clue.
---
While I think I understand where you were going with this, the difference between carrier/super ratting is that the rats die much faster than an asteroid. If excavators utilized the fighter UI, you could still select the 5 excavator "fighters" and press F1 to cycle the mining lasers indefinitely until said asteroid was depleted. This is no different than launching drones and pushing your hotkey/telling them to mine today.
---
Tweak: excavators now have MWD modules.
---
I've been led to believe that was PL's MO for years, was I lied to?
---
Do you mean the Customs Office?
---
\#MAKETHEWIDOWGREATEAGAIN
---
Tweak: these new connections show up on the overview and are named 'stargates'.
---
7k.
---
You're abuse of your ellipses makes me want to go to war with you.
---
Please don't get my hopes up. I keep buying skins for that beautiful ship that never leaves the hanger.
---
inventing widows no longer possible. all widows are now collector items.
---
WH space now behaves like maps on Battle Royale games, shrinking over time with the exit at the middle that only allows one ship.
---
It reinforces the idea of being in a big blob and krab safely to be able to hold our sov.
---
It's the new meta :/
---
Balance devblog does not imply coming changes. Communication is great but we've had a lot of communication - let's hear some real plans and see CCP sticking to timelines before we get too excited - or too upset. 
---
Tweak: Supercarrier skills get reduced by 1 when ship is destroyed.
---
Out of curiosity, how is this video three years old? The model changes just came through.
---
Hard cap on the number of citadels a single system can have in any space. 
---
If somebody suddenly bought a massive amount of the books that ended up having the biggest jumps in price then yea, we would. CSM are defending their "didnt leak" by saying they didn't know about anom changes. But there are future changes coming that having a lot of extra space may benefit as well.
---
Guess we'll see if Elo saying Nags are going to get a big buff according to a source is fact or fiction, and go from there :D
---
So....MORE rorq mining? You think that's a good thing?
---
?
---
Vertical supremacy for a tall CEO. Makes sense.
---
It wasn't a model change. They simply enabled the animation for Warping in the Astero.  
---
&gt; Enabled a warping animation on the Astero.  
---
[Source](https://www.eveonline.com/article/po1p6y/patch-notes-for-march-2019-release)
---
Like skillbook prices excluding capital related are almost unnoticeable in your expenses. 
---
Well elo can't break the nda if he's never signed one. But whomever leaked it to him, if true, can. 
---
You don't even need any sec to solo run a super, how is every system being ran?
---
Tweak: To refit themselves, ALL modules must be offlined before refit.
---
yeah, they're going to pay 30 percent markup on these new raised prices for sure 
---
Tweak: modules no longer require a minimum capacitor percentage to be onlined while undocked.
---
Meta.
---
Well, that would be short-sighted, would only mean RIP to semi AFK ratting. 
---
Boters will just add one line to their code. 
---
So typical CCP, says one thing does another. Those edges don't look sharp at all.
---
the funniest are carriers +50mil .... like who cares.       
---
CCP should do :       
---
Titan  10b         
---
Capital/Dreads/Carriers  1b         
---
Rorqual 2b          
---
It's going to be a balance change to CCP Falcon putting his face on the launcher.
---
I'm talking about running 6/10 or better sites, not doing regular exploration. I should have mentioned that, my bad.
---
Get out of here with your fancy facts, noone cares!
---
Christ those are TQ prices - this went live. 
---
It's not our fault your CSMs don't tell you the info.
---
Simply checking 2-3 times a day 
---
OLD, like really OLD
---
Lokis into Bhaals wasn’t so great.  
---
Minor tweak: Higher FW levels now modify that factions capital/supercapital jump range (increase up to +100%), jump fatigue (reduction up to 75%), and damage bonuses (up to 50%) - in ALL space.
---
minor tweak: if someone anchors a citadel over the cap, every citadel in system gets destroyed
---
Interesting. I fly the Astero pretty often and I don't remember ever seeing the rotating antennae bits. It looks like the antennae were always retracted before they enabled the warp animation, so they were already there, but hidden.
---
I play the game, but i do not really consider grinding bilions of isk just in order to be competitive, to be actually playing it. So yeah, in order to be able to play in a good way and make content for everybody, i often need a few hours of semi-afk ratting to be able to afford it. 
---
There are two possible outcomes for me. Win EvE completely, or start mining (which would basically mean the same). :) 
---
I trained into Stealth Bombers years ago only for everyone to tell me they are pretty much useless.
---
I've come back since finding out they are a perfectly viable PvP choice, even for solo.
---
As long as I am cloaked I can relax and not have to worry about anything. I can even have a toilet break without worrying about coming back to a floating corpse.
---
#make_marauders_great_again
---
they will turbofuck supers&amp;titans 
---
Wait you don't play eve on maximum zoom out ?      
---
Like WTF?       
---
How do you see what is happening around you?
---
Yes sir
---
&gt; I just kind of assume anyone who PVE’s for isk is because if not they’d have a job irl
---
That is the thing with assumptions. Most of the time those are just smelly ass bullshit. :P
---
*Change*: reduce (not eliminate, just reduce) isk bounties on all NPCs, and instead drop more dog-tags or items that can be turned into ISK once delivered to proper faction navy stations or concord stations (or maybe some equivalent of "in-space datacenters").
---
*Change*: revisit and rebalance the entire list of Loyalty stores for each faction, specially faction modules that can be obtained there, eliminate ISK as part of their equation and instead add items + LP (ex: a faction turret, use LP + normal turret + materials). Keep ISK + LP for exchanges for faction BPCs, faction SKINs, faction clothes, implants, hardwirings or consumable items that are components later used in other tasks (nexus chips or datacores). Modules/ships becoming material sinks, the rest ISK sinks.
---
ARMORHACS ARMORHACS!!!!
---
OK, time to postpone my resub. This could be very bad. 
---
tweaking the tweak: usable by everyone\* 
---
Hacking is cool
---
Poison pills always go down easier when you coat them in sugar.  
---
hey man i just like playing games ok
---
minerals continued their downward slide, along with basically everything else
---
plex went up, along with injectors and extractors
---
they're buffing plex? 
---
I think I saw one of those first time back in 2010 or something. But I'm sure they're older than that.
---
Take a break and come back when you feel the itch to play again.
---
Well then - Minor Tweak: Warping to a planet now lands you at 10km of Custom Office, but they have warp scramblers fitted 
---
Yeah, they were retracted, and the Astero has two animations built in; one (Siege) where it extends the antennae outwards and flips those two turret discs, and the other (Normal) where it does the same but in reverse. Prior to today, the Astero was permanently in the Normal state, with no way of triggering the Siege animation.
---
Looks like they changed it so that the Astero starts off in the Siege state, and then plays the Normal animation when it enters warp, before playing the Siege animation again once it lands.
---
I assumed that's what you were talking about because it's the more common option in nullsec, but I thought I'd throw in that hacking is a great way to burn small chunks of time.
---
IMO it's actually pretty fun too, all things considered.  Like playing scratch tickets that require an element of strategy.
---
I think you need to swap to a lite version of the crack cocaine you're smoking.
---
I believe it when I see it, and will temper my expectations accordingly.
---
Change: Bombs no longer get damaged by other bombs of the same type 
---
fuck that, whisper "bhaalgorn model"
---
first two blood raider ships have unique models that are beautiful. big daddy bhaalgorn gets the ancient geddon model? this is a crime
---
Yes, shit on a potential new content creator, wonderful idea. That's exactly what eve needs these days, fewer people leading nerds out to get fights, space is far too busy right now.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/uL3tKuR.gif](https://i.imgur.com/uL3tKuR.gif)
---
Wait, do you want to tell me, that when i minimize all those windows i play on, that i could actually see how my ship looks like? That is preposterous.
---
All DPS caps removed.
---
\&gt; dropping the CSM to focus on balance changes
---
Sheild supers -&gt; choosing damage holes -&gt; dropping on test supers slow boating on the way back from ops -&gt; sniping titans that bounce with LR nags.
---
Most logic fits with elo’s known gimmicks.
---
or dock and repair for free... 
---
Change: Launching drones takes time based on drone size. 
---
I wont care as long as you release the Leviathan Steel Cardinal Skin so I can complete my collection
---
don't faction drones track better... like precisely 10 percent better
---
Change: all citadels require additional components as part of their upkeep (i.e. PI/Structure parts in addition to fuel to maintain services 
---
Minor Tweak: Enforcer can only carry mining drones. 
---
Tweak: Weapons do double damage to ships that are cloak capable.
---
how did you find my soundcloud....
---
yep, just another %-s
---
:( 
---
minor tweak: Ansiblex minimal anchoring range from citadel is removed
---
Wouldn't that be solvable with an alt in system that warps to you and then cynos when you're tackled? 
---
Minor tweak: Replaces bomb launcher and only has space for 4-5 shots just like bombs.
---
I don't know what I expected, but that was perfect haha! 
---
minor tweak : cyno inhib uses 500 strontium as fuel and need to be fueled after anchoring.
---
&gt;Jackdaw movement speed decreased by 1m/s.
---
&gt; Golden Jackdaw Skins
---
&gt; 322 MB
---
minor tweak (to patchnotes): clarified meaning of "caps" as in "capitals" (i.e. dreadnoughts, supercarriers and titans), citadel dps caps are still in place
---
Cus having to use dscan and/or be at risk is devastating to some playstyles.
---
I'd even be okay with this
---
Wow, these changes are so minor I wonder why they even spent developer time on it.
---
Not trying to be negative here, but I bet I am not alone when I say I believe these changes will have a very insignificant impact, regardless if you are a rookie or veteran.
---
I am however oh so happy with the ability to buy skills anywhere. 
---
would that really be a bad change tho? more shit in space and easier to kill. win/win
---
Same, and I'm even more scared than before after reading several comments with possibilities I hadn't thought of before.
---
minor tweak: dreads are allowed in higsec
---
Tweak: ALL skills get reduced by 1 when any ship is destroyed.
---
well at least you would be able to shoot it
---
minor tweak : subcapital weapons have 95% reduced efficiency against capital targerts. 
---
Changes : Faxes rep to a subcap are mitigated by the sig on the ship receiving damage  
---
its almost like bots aren't the only problem the game has, shocking I know.
---
it's kinda incredible how leddit works, bots have been working since release and just now nerds are treating them like they were the end of the world and the only issue to be tackled.
---
Pretty sure cyno stays up even if the ship that started the cyno dies
---
Sunday, but I wouldn't expect anything before Thursday's later working hours (in Iceland), quite probably Friday.
---
Just set up a dread hole, make 2-3 billion in an hour, use that to fund your PvP. It's pretty simple. I wish they'd use the same model in kspace honestly. Massively nerf the number of anoms, make them hard enough you actually have to pay attention, and add point/scram to most of the rats, and just increase the amount of isk you make from each one to compensate for the lower number you are able to run. Spend 1/4 the time to make the same oak, and bots are tackled in site so hunters rejoice.
---
:barf:
---
That's another cute strawman to try and dissuade further discussion since you had nothing to contribute 5 comments ago.
---
Credit from folks who get it lmao. God that's rich, who. Goons? Anyone who's just bored of your autistic screeching about  how cool what you did was and how you totally did it alone and it's initiatives accomplishment on their own rofl.
---
Also find it funny that using language that's been part of my life since high school makes me an it guy with a thesaurus. God that's honestly pathetic if that's your only explanation for why someone uses words you don't.
---
And you're welcome to call me a nobody mr csm flex, but I am heavily involved in the community, I'm just not on the spectrum enough to need constant recognition about who I am.
---
Nope, and depending on timings people currently jumping to the cyno will get dumped at the sun and bounce. 
---
Tweak: Capitals have damage caps like citadels
---
Oh a near 10% increase across the board? Thats by far not as bad as i was fearing. But it makes me wonder why bother changing the skill prices at all then (except rorq skill prices). Seems a tad bit insignificant. I hope it didn't eat up much dev time and meetings :) 
---
Lmao clearly you've never seen or used a cyno in your life
---
Tweak: also like battle royale games, fitted ships are spawned into WH systems and can be freely boarded by anyone. This includes titans, supercarriers, and faction (super)capitals.
---
uh oh, is Dotlan down?
---
Literal u-boat in our space submarines game
---
But muh skins?! :'(
---
tweak tweak: cap is hidden and changes over time
---
This would be an amazing change, no lie
---
Tweak: dog-tags and other NPC commodities can now be placed in the PLEX vault.
---
This is older than pangaea
---
Try Abyssals! They work great for short sessions and help create short term goals for me. First it was to clear a T3 in a cruiser, then I wanted to clear T5, then ultimately I cleared a T5. 
---
There are frigate variants you can run with friends and I had a goal to clear the T5 there (done now, too).
---
My new goals are different. Hit a certain ISK value, kill someone in a Sabre as it's been like 10 years since I last did that, and I want to blow up a Citadel just to have done it. After that, who knows?
---
Find a goal; what have you always wanted to do?
---
Tweak: stealth bombers can now only carry one bomb.
---
#Imacontentcreator
---
When do the prices go live though?
---
Change: Multiboxing limited to maximum of 2 accounts at the same time.  
---
(yes, hate me ;D)
---
Tweak: drones are now much faster (with improved application to compensate) to account for the slower deployment rate.
---
Way too late for that. You'd be nerfing new players as the established once have already taken full advantage of the current state of injectors. 
---
Tweak: these components are cheap and sold by NPC sell orders in every station in New Eden.
---
Late reply, but the idea is to use sisters to increase scan strength correct?
---
Tweak (for the first): Delivery stations are always in wormholes.
---
Minor tweak : a drone damage bonus is dependent on how low your sec status is 
---
Why do you need billions of isk to be competitive?
---
Take a frig to FW space, get yo solo frig pvp on
---
To be honest, I am probably wrong about that, but as far as I understood it was to prevent people from just popping their disposable cyno so that they didn't have to wait 15 minutes for their cyno to finish 
---
I could be wrong and I don't actually remember where I read that from
---
I do have a (recently trained) carrier alt but have not really used a cyno in a hazardous situation (eg been shot at) so if I'm wrong I apologise
---
Updates to counter betting by increasing times on anoms, then updates to UI and Graphics. Nothing about ships, structures, etc, CCP has no time for that. Let's be honest...
---
Tweak - All 3 character slots can now all train at once at no extra cost and can also all be played at the same time. (Yeah, Fuck you) :D
---
minor tweak: exit is frig hole
---
Because the only way to nerf the rorqual is through skill book cost changes? wtf lmao
---
That's a great idea for a fix! Add covert cloak and torp fitting/application. Make it a bomber without the bomb launcher. 
---
;)
---
tweak: bombs are now targetable
---
lmao willing to bet you just PVE and dont even PVP.
---
Minor Tweak: so is the damage from all capital-size weapons, including Fighters and FiBos.
---
Change: Titans can no longer fit high-angle weapons, and the bosonic field generator is removed from the game entirely.
---
tweak: recalled drones must get approved 'docking request' popup before entering drone bay
---
Well, shifting values from 300 items up by 10% and for some up by 100% does not take as much time as you expect. This was a two hour job and for that, the changes are ok.
---
Heh. nice one :D
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
amazing
---
Capital guns now have ridiculous high damage &amp; tracking and also cause massive AOE damage. 
---
Finally decided that after 6 years of flinging shit wildly at everything but...that drones are a non viable standalone weapons platform?
---
fair enough! I thought that it stayed up to prevent people from carrying a bunch of disposable cyno ships and just popping them as soon as the ship jumping to it arrived, bypassing the 15 minute cycle time.
---
I will edit my comment
---
Is easy fix mr computer man u just to put the ship where it is supposed to be instead of where it's not supposed to be!
---
Clean your ship maybe? 
---
tweak: additional components are added to fuel block requirements
---

---
*eyes emoji*
---
yeah, but then when you guys welp it will be that much harder to replace. Noone in eve welps ships as hard as Goonswarm, so the "smaller" entities wont be hurt as much, since most smaller entities are in every way better then goons, except for speed of sweating, and industry.
---
Tweak - Bombs are now no longer a thing. Introducing the new Kamikaze Module only useable on Stealth bombers.
---
Ratting is an easy entry level activity for learning systems. Mining and ratting are probably where she's going to be learning the basics (shes already mining rocks and gas.) I'm not sure where else i could teach her the basics aside from fighting alongside standing fleet which we also plan on doing.
---
Division 2 just came out
---
pls buff corax, caracal navy issue, nighthawk, widow, chimera useless ecm bonus, navy battleships being shit/stupidly expensive, black ops battleships being more expensive than carriers, etc.
---
stop
---
hehehe, who ever said about auto-repeat being available.

yes I too clean my brand new ship just assembled, and also no that doesn't help.
---
Oh sure, because we need more capital ships in game :eyeroll:
---
Someone else said goals.  My goals right now are to hit 20 billion isk.  As soon as I do I'm buying a golem and full crystals and flying it in standing fleet
---
Honestly at this point its just the circle of life
---
Nerf Panic AND Rorqual AND excavators.
---
Keep them in line with Porpoise and Orca. The Drones are OK but will not out mine a hulk, ever. They should be Boost ships with some utility (Porpoise has some remote reps for smaller shit, Orcas have Stronger Reps and great Ore hold, Rorqual has the best reps, Biggest drone bay and can Compress Ore)
---
INDY Core should give zero Drone Bonus's. It should be used much like Triage, Makes reps more Efficient, makes Boosts stronger and the ability to Compress Ore. Make Indy Core cost less Heavy Water
---
the faction drones would always win I would think, the extra EHP still matters despite poor resists because they have so damn much structure on fed navies.
---
i3wm
---
fuck you
---
Track better and have more EHP. 
---
IKR! So let's alienate the guys who still play the game and fund it from semi-afk ratting in order to get them to stop playing at all, or engage in superimmersive mining fleets which are obviously better, or just inject to a carrier and load a bot script.
---
So.
---
Much.
---
WIN!
---
"Heh, Time to genocide guristas rats" \~ Edgy Edgemaster Gila
---
Minor tweak: Explosion radius 1,000,000m
---
if you used one of those bobbing duck heads that Homer Simpson uses to press Y all the time, would that count as botting...
---
I would actually not be against something like this. 
---
- Comeback of nullified, sub 3s align, 11au warpspeed tengu
---
- Cynoinhib module for blops
---
Because i do. 
---
I play games to fly big ships and see them blown. If i wanted to see something small fail miserably, i would try having sex. 
---
What’s the plan?
---
That's chump change. Who doesn't have 7000 isk?
---
Uhh, last I checked Nanite paste was ~30K each.
---
210M?!
---
Jesus christ.
---
huge tweak"  if doomsday weapon is fired throught stargate,structure gate and structure cyno the doomsday weapon will continue and damage anyone near  gate on other side.
---
I'm actually in favor of afk isk farming mechanics as long as there is some risk involved (reee remove local). I'm just saying I'm tired of seeing "I have a family and full time job" as an argument for changes to games in general.
---
Change : Every cap using jumpdrive has a very very very slighlty chance to fail and explodes with AOE damage
---
Change:
---
All structures now drop its contents upon destruction, like WH structures, instead of asset safety kicking in. 
---
There is no reason that World of Warcraft mechanisms like asset safety remain in Eve. 
---
chori it is clear that you have too much lighting in the station :P
---
capital sized warp disruption bubble deployables.  mobile huge  warp disruptor,mobile grid-wide warp disruption generator and  system-wode warp delay sphere. the last one slow down any warp within area of effect,anyone jumping into system with travel ceptor will travel half time longer.  gating the titans wlll be futile in that area.
---
Minor: Cyno in range of an active Cyno Inhib cause a sun bounce.
---
polarized structure weapons  developped based on drifter tech.
---
So if you like to fly big ships, you should expect to have to spend longer grinding isk for them. 
---
Frig PVP is actually more interesting than large ships imo anyhow, as it's more of a test of your skills, rather than pressing F1.
---
It doesn't always show here or in game, but there is more that unites us than divides us.
---
It makes me proud to be a part of a gaming community like this one.
---
Change: Dev's actually learn how to play the game.
---
You don't appear in local for the initial 60 second cloak from taking a gate, if you're in a combat recon, and/or if you have a covert ops cloak fit.
---
To bad the evidence is against a guy that's *not* CSM. So it doesn't actually help.
---
That's my argument against cloak timers and other anti-camping measures people like to propose here.
---
It's really damn nice to be able to step away from the computer without having to log off in space, or fly however far to a friendly structure.
---
Tweak: Enforcer gets a -100% Drone Damage Role Bonus
---
&gt;You can only crab for so long before it becomes pointless.
---
Last week's incursion and the existance of goonswarm in it's current form suggest otherwise.
---
Tweak - Dev are allowed to spawn any ship in they want and eventually take over the whole of null sec. 
---
Well, good point is that it will make it cristal clear if CCP understood the game's problem or if they are definitely going full retarded. 
---
Except if he got it...he got it from somebody who *is* in CSM. So it does actually help. And if they cant find the person who *did* leak it they should just axe CSM so it doesnt happen again...again
---
Lol, that's pretty disappointing 
---
That's something I can't comment on, yet.
---
Please, we’ve been sperging about this for at least two years.
---
I was hoping someone would say, "Dev's only like highsec and refuse to do anything but missions". But yours is accurate to what I would expect.
---
How much dps you get for loading nanite paste as your ammo?
---
Tweak - Look is scattered individually in cans around between 250km and 1000km. You cannot warp to them or scan them down. 
---
And then later on 0% of bots fail because bots evolve and real people don't typically.
---
i have best idea to stop bots,afk cloaking 
---
when ur undocked  in space doing notthing for an half hour you get warning bell ringing for 30seconds. then message popup that u are too long inactive and will logout in next 30seconds.
---
this includes afk ratting belts or anomalies and afk mining.
---
new tool available.. reporting sack.. if player is reported for  abusive actions its recorded. if there are 10 legit records,player gets banned,legit record means he was recorded and  video placed on youtube. if he  was caught 10 times.
---
Hell no...the idea is that you have to move them to cash them....a omnipresent vault defeats the purpose
---
7000 Nanite paste
---
I mean who wouldn't want to do that if they had dev powers :D
---
Or just die in your 90% insurable mining boost ship
---
to be fair, it is rather hard to generate heat damage in it unless you leave overheat on.  being that your firing just one turret instead of 6 to 8.
---
but yeah..the repair is more expensive htan the gun itself (which was 80m).  talk about the repair walk of shame
---
Good luck identifying who out of the 10 CSM members leaked the information. That's near impossible to determine. I seriously doubt they'll axe all 10 members because of one leaker.
---
&gt;would only mean RIP to semi AFK ratting.
---
Good.
---
we can all admit, it is too good. It can move 2400m/s, hit other cruisers no problem at 70km for nearly 3k alpha. Come on
---
Sorry but blue loot and other things already need to cashed in concord stations...sleepers / drifters and other assorted wormhole npc are already in line with my suggestion
---
Thank you, 1,000,000 Died To Make This Sound was the song I was very interested in :).
---
Funny that all but one of the directors are staying in PL. Spend more time polishing your crystal ball next time. 
---
If you don't like it, send in a ticket. They refunded my Plex because the skin I bought was also very dull.
---
for killing supers with only a handfull of players thru fax reps
---
&gt; Capital ships can no longer access Empire space (that includes low sec)
---
Um..... yes please
---
Change: All faction Battleships receive application bonuses akin to faction BCs and a speedbuff, Navy Scorp reworked for hybrids, Navygeddon for missiles.
---
T3 procurer. Have a mining subsystem, and a bait subsystem with a bonus to tank and only 1 high slot for a cyborg.
---
How quickly we forget who won the last two major supercap throwdowns.
---
Well if they fixed this I'd be happy. https://i.imgur.com/wInHlGc.png 
---
A) undock them and see them in space. 
---
B) different segments glint at different angles, and will appear brighter/darker depending on the local light source.
---
Also.. when you get a burger, do you really expect it to look like it does in commercials??
---
Hedliner plucked the Ronald from the Black Legion scrapheap. The only legacy left behind was a stack of exceptionally salty ex-Waffles.
---
Sounds good, I'd do one thing differently though. how about this: the panic mod ONLY protects the mining fleet and not the Rorq, which has an absurd tank anyway? That way people would actually have to choose between tank and yield for the rigs. CCP's investment for the panic mod wouldn't be in vain and they could also remove the awkward *target roid first* workaround.
---
I too only want bots to be able to rorqual mine.
---
Remember, adding tedium like requiring someone to be there to push a button every 60s but not adding any actual engagement *encourages* botting it does not stop it.
---
I once forgot to update my clone and had to train most of Sentry Drones V twice. You know, back when this game had consequences and whatnot ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
But gold (well at least yellow)
---
I mean the fact that having a sun in the system you're flying makes it look as dull as on the picture in the post, is very dissapointing.
---
Bad bot.
---
That is a decent compromise, that sounds alright!
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.85699% sure that mothyy is not a bot.

grind simulator
---
Ore and combat anom nerfs, panic nerf, caps (and especially super caps) vs subcap nerf, tweaks to dozens of underperforming and over performing hulls, tiericide finished, tethering made less dumb, low power made weaker, FW revitalization efforts, further fixes to widow/gni/etc.
---
It's not a mother of all balace dev blogs if it doesn't do half of that or more.
---
I'm waiting to be disappointed!
---
I mean i was just memeing about the shape 
---
Fly safe capsuleer.
---
Yeah, how quickly we forget that the server went to shit, most of the kills you got were people that were DC'd and half the FAX modules were not working, since they cynod in, and you were already there.
---
Lets not pretend for one second that goons are actually good, lmao. 
---
Horde has no caps ;)
---
Normally what i do for disposable cynos is start self destruct and then cyno up with 15 seconds left to not lose use of the account for 10 minutes, yes
---
Make excavators require fighter skills too
---
Not everyone likes wormhole mechanics or they would already be in wormholes.
---
Pretty sure it's working as intended, as all trig weapons require a very large amount of paste.
---
Wtf you kind of supposing it's normal that it happens? 
---
The Rorqual should never have turned into a mining ship. It should have stayed, as you recommend, a boosting ship. 
---
The change that forced them to be on grid was reasonable in the sense of the PANIC mod, strong local tank, and passable DPS (especially when DPS fit). 
---
The tradeoff it SHOULD have received with the on-grid change was strengthening the boosts applied to barges. Barges, while definitely multiboxable, are not as easily multiboxed as Rorquals. There are multiple things you need to do with barges to keep the lasers going and the ore holds empty. Multiboxing 20+ barges is cancer (I should know, I did it a lot before I quit). So you might have still had the material inflation but because it's not as easy to box barges for a long period of time (compared to Rorqs), I don't think it would have manifested itself to the degree we see.
---
Recalling a post by Olmeca, however, it is obvious that the intention was to create the high-cost multibox gameplay of the Rorqs - they definitely had a dramatic impact on people buying Injectors (which has direct impacts on Skill Extractor and PLEX purchases). I highly doubt CCP sacrifices the value of the Rorqs or dare pisses off the customer base that invested tons of $$$$ and ISK into their multibox Rorq fleets.
---
At that point just buy a new one 
---
You are wrong.
---
haha &lt;3
---
I don't mind going on camera at all, personally. 
---
CCP is flexible enough that if I didn't want to do it, I could just say "nope".
---
I just tripled my productivity!
---
minor tweak: there's coffee on my screen now
---
every single change is going to alienate someone, if it's an improvement to the game at large it's irrelevant. what is the catchphrase you people really love to toss out to others who have their playstyle alienated in favour of yours? oh yeah
---
just adapt
---
Yeah that's the drawback of using heat on those powerful modules.
---
I think we are in agreement. I don't believe the freedom to manage your corp or fleet should be forced into any particular rule-set. I am simply pointing out that, as you say, your rule-set affects the quality of your group and, by extension, Eve in general. Further, having a raging snowflake, SJW guy (not the FC in this case) as a person in leadership, pilot B, who will take every tiny opportunity to take offense and seize the moral high-ground at the expense of some guy who answered your ad and didn't do anything to anyone, for something as trivial as a ship named "REEE"...results in pilot A going away from your group and becoming alienated from both your group and Eve. Finally, there can be impacts well beyond pilot A for your group and for Eve. 
---
Roger that. Corax speed buffed by 50m/s to bring it line with other plated cruisers.
---
pls no
---
this has to be one of the worst excuses for blobbing I've ever heard so far :))) 
---
Finaly, my dream of becoming space garbage collector comes true.
---
Hey i want it back for dreads and fax as well
---
Nothing major will change. Even if it does the supernerds who base their entire existence around this game will find the best way to exploit 'whatever' within a few days and then complain that it wasn't enough change or it wasn't the right change even though it would have probably worked if this was any other game where the playerbase actually left their house other than to go to their job or to go to the store to buy Hot Pockets.
---
It's not at that level.
---
Think of it as SAT's, except you can only take it once a year.
---
It literally, LITERALLY defines your life for many. Not only do many colleges look at that score and only that score, doing badly will even have your family turn on you after a while.
---
SAT's, you can take more than once. Do somewhat badly, or even average? There are many colleges that will take you. 
---
These exams? You're treated like a failure if you don't get into decent or great schools.
---
People literally take these exams over and over, for years at a time after high school just to have a shot at getting into a good school. And by that, I don't mean 2-3 years; I mean 5,6,7,8 years. Can you imagine getting into college when you're 26, with your only experience being studying for years by yourself?
---
Note that I am not Chinese, nor do I know the Gaokao exam. What I'm basing this off of is a very similar system in Korea, and afaik it's the same in Japan.
---
It's very different from the SAT's.
---
idk that might be kinda cool
---
Somebody watched Stargate i guess.
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. 
---
I will, i already have botscript ready for this eventuality.
---
make excavators have to be assigned to a mining barge in fleet with the Rorqual. so for every Rorqual in the anom / belt there also needs to be five mining barges to get max yield. return it to a fleet boosting role rather than the only mining ship.
---
Can you spool that up on a rorq in panic? I think it would be dope to alpha a rorq as it comes out of panic.
---
Different lighting environments will change the look of you ship, in conclusion, you bought a skin yes you were scammed
---
I just fuck around with fittings
---
Fair enough, I thought that wasn't possible. Or I forgot, either way. Makes travel a lot easier B)
---
if they nerf them, people will buy extractors, CCP wins
---
have fun studying for 7 days a week, until 2-3AM every day, waking up at 6. 
---
Have fun in a society where you're considered "falling behind" if you haven't already covered the entire material of your grade and the grade above by yourself already.
---
Have fun especially if you're born in a family that can't afford to send you to as many cram schools that can fit in your schedule.
---
Have fun studying for exams where the organizers purposely put in questions that are designed to cover things that schools don't cover to "prevent a lot of high scores".
---
Have fun when covering that said question becomes the norm.
---
&gt;What advice would you suggest for someone who has been away for a while but still can't find a reason to care?
---
My advice is just don't. Forcing yourself to log in is a quick way to burn out and never come back. Step back find something else to do and come back when the itch catches you again.
---
I can't look away.    ^help
---
Joke's on you, I wanted it for ECM!
---
Finally, were bringing back clone grades!
---
Big oof

Dude knew how to blow shit up

https://zkillboard.com/character/543271018/
---
That's a lotta damidge
---
-Phil Swift 2k18
---
fix it with flex tape bruh
---
They could just remove excavators or the Wetu.  Excavators were a good idea but poorly implemented since they aren't really at risk.  
---
Your ideas work as well.  I'd add that a downside is that rorqs right now are probably one of the biggest drivers of content for drops.  If you take that away you are going to have hunters complaining left and right.  
---
Take away my combat rorq and I will end you reeeeee
---
fuck logi, jam the bigger ships and break the DPS , logi can go and eat ECM drones 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kills/rorquals/ 
---
Yep most of the kill are 200 + guys or maybe not...
---
Are they going to make Battleships and Battlecruisers great again?
---
*fingers crossed*
---
make them not appear in local.
---
OLD NEWS
---
Bastion has been bleeding rorqs the last few nights with Northern Coalition killing 3 rorquals last night. 
---
Small tweak, titan dd's can fire to a cyno location
---
One guy hanging out for a few days? Whatever. 
---
The same cloaky eyes/blops droppers camping in your systems for months on end with literally 0 counterplay? Fuck off with that shit give us something anything.
---
Rule #4 of the 10 Crack Commandments is,  
---
NEVER GET HIGH ON YOUR OWN SUPPLY.
---
Implement these pls. 
---
Init is busy so our renters are keeping their heads down.
---
Change: only manual piloting from now on, no orbit, keep at range or approach.
---
not an excuse. we fly fleets with corp members that are online, if its 3 or 30 doesnt matter. about 2 years ago when i joined stranger danger i was a lot like "blobbers are the worst, they dont wanna take risks". When a corp grows, youll find yourself turning into those blobbers involuntarily, simply for the fact that you have more members that wanna participate. Sure we could only take 10 members out, and when somebody with 20 guys shows up, start reddit sperging how xyz are blobbing assholes. or take the guys that we have, have some fun, and live with the occasional bs on reddit. I am not trying to belittle you, but i understand where the frustration comes from as i have been there, and i can tell you "blobbing" isnt something that always comes from malice. I can promise that stranger danger loves honour brawls, so if you ever come into contact us, just chat us up
---
Please don't give them any ideas.
---
Yeah they should just do a database search for loose, there's at least one more instance of this.
---
Do you regret not paying attention in English class?
---
I play either rainbow six, far cry 3, or heat signature. They’re all games you can play casually for 15-20 minutes and not worry about consequences.
---
That was a very fun skirmish,  thanks for taking the fight...
---
Jesus christ that was quick..
---
Hunters will just drop on fleets of hulks now. 
---
You kill the stream snipers.
---
exactly, look at the thread
---
Thanks for the post. Streamfleet is awesome in every way, great community and awesome people to be around.
---
Fax nerf: Swing and a miss.
---
Yeah, I'm sure no one expected the server to go to shit for a huge supercap throwdown. Are you seriously trying to make that excuse? Everyone on the field knew exactly what the server was going to do. Hell, hostiles made it worse by using smartbombing frigates to intentionally generate lag.
---
Also, we can look at X47 round 2 and know that while we adapted to what we learned in round 1, hostiles sat, slack-jawed, and did the exact same thing. If we're not "actually good," then that makes hostiles really, really fuckin' bad.
---
it would still have high drone DPS, just not yield
---
Let it have it's time in the sun.
---
&gt;We will be adding a modifier to any ship being targeted by remote assistance. This modifier will then be applied to reduce incoming reps as they stack up.
---
totally out of relation. i just quickly checked 5 killmails there and all of them were utterly shit fit or not under umbrellas.
---
give me statistics how many rorqs are undocked and mining on average per hour. then tell me how many get tackled but also get saved...also in which region this happens.
---
then we can talk killmails
---
Fuck yo rorqs
---
Minor tweak: you can d-scan when cloaked or in a combat recon. ^^
---
Minor tweak: -3 launcher slots, down to 3 total.
---
Came here to say this.
---
lmao, so just like the USA. God forbid a student is studying material instead of looking at dog cocks on snapchat.
---
whether or not some paper pushers stay in PL, the corp defo stayed in lowsec: [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98151818/top/year/2019/month/2/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98151818/top/year/2019/month/2/)  
---
looks like his crystal ball was pretty spiffy, although you wouldn't have to be mystic meg to guess that one
---
Minor tweak - citadel damage cap has been lowered to 500 dps
---
buff medium autocannons pl0x
---
Minor tweak: collisions with all objects cause significant damage. 
---
WTF I feel...robbed!
---
CCPlz compensate!
---
Minor tweak: it's high sec now
---
Man, I remember when this was the *honestly suggested* way to get into Jita, because the sheer number of people in local (typically idled at 150-200-ish at the time, I think?) would cause even decent machines to falter and outdated potatoes to die.
---
pfft.
---
You don't understand.
---
Dank updates incoming: Everything you didn't want and nothing you did. 
---
change: when a ship cloaks it disappears from local  
---
[include a lore patch to fix why that wouldnt work for lore reasons, cause thats already got plenty of holes, it dont need a new one]
---
people pay player markup currently for the convenience of getting everything they need in jita (or whatever nullsec staging system). if they can pay a slightly higher markup and get them where ever they are currently you dont think they will? my guess is player sales will drop significantly.
---
&gt; Along with the changes to fighters, we want to add more risk to using the very powerful Networked Sensor Array by disallowing ship warp while the NSA is active. The extremely high locking speed is very powerful, especially for PVE or in combination with Sirens for PVP, and this will add another layer of risk to using it.
---
Dis gon b gud
---
Perfect.
---
How do you wanna cut the losses then?
---
It's worth noting that it's not a traditional stacking penalty and only kicks in at extremely high scales - On a day-to-day level this doesn't change anything with how RR works.
---
no please, tell me why it is so horrible to assume a student should study?!
---
My cousin studied law in Italy, he worked his ass off and spend a lot of sleepless nights studying what he was supposed to. He made it because of hard work. He WANTED that career opportunity.
---
I have been in the military for over a decade, i know all about 
---
&gt;Have fun studying for exams where the organizers purposely put in questions that are designed to cover things that schools don't cover to "prevent a lot of high scores".
---
Just about anyone going for E7 or E8 know that there are a lot of "Stump the chump" questions.
---
"What is the lead absorption rate of a child under the age of 3" Why does someone in an electrical field need to know this.
---
STUDY
---
jesus christ, are we really backing up cheating, lmao
---
God bless.
---
lmao the cargo asset safety. lets just make it so you don't really lose anything.
---
if they can catch them.  but fleet warp says no.  rorqs are easy targets to catch because of siege (easy to catch, hard to kill).  
---
plus since hulk pilots are generally at the keyboard they are also aware when neuts enter system. 
---
The changes to Rorquals will not impact their use by larger entities and make them more risky to use (when mining with them) by smaller ones. However, it is good to see they are making changes in the right direction. Now if only we can get that Alliance Tournament properly funded and back on the table.
---
Not backing up, but trying to make you understand why the culture became like that.
---
&gt;JUST FUCKING STUDY
---
All i'm saying is it's not as easy as just saying, "hey, just study".
---
Have you experienced both education systems? If not, I don't think you can talk about, **Specifically the comparison between the two systems**, better than me.
---
So this is the big-fleet fax nerf that tons of people have been advocating for forever, making it possible to fight titans with FAX backup using raw DPS instead of DD alpha?
---
fuckyeah.jpg, finally fixing the sovnull meta
---
Roll back ECM changes.
---
Literally look at the lp store calculator on fuzzwork rn lmao
---
EVE is an empire building RTS  get your pvp shit out of here
---
I've seen a couple of people mention that but the differnces are actually not that uniform. Most changes were minor adjustments, but some skills have been significantly increased in price.. Also a small percentage increase in some cases means a lot of extra ISK for some skills, while for others a large percentage increase can be potentially insignificant for vets.
---
The Fax changes are honestly confusing and will make logistics a bit of a headache. The performance impact of diminishing returns for logistics doesn't seem to be worth it to nerf fax in this manner.
---
I see capital nerfs and subcap buffs. I am a happy capsuleer today
---
Make faction guns use tech 2 ammo, and add more types of tech 2 ammo
---
It could have been something less obvious so I had to ask. Like, I dunno, the alliance leader welping a capital fleet.
---
Minor tweak: Dreads can jump without cyno to dumpster Rorqs
---
Yep so fly it to the sun, and then spin your camera to precisely the right angle .... there. Just as advertised. 
---
maybe a better top end payout for places where they give up the ability to fly titans and supers. Just a general increase in value of lowsec and highsec space.
---
Yes please
---
Yes you are supposed to do so - &gt;example from OP
---
I do the most elite of pvp. I pvp on the Jita undock.
---
literally who didn't want a fax nerf and a carrier application nerf
---
FINE PRINT BABY
---
I'm surprised they went with this type of nerf while not really addressing the real problem: Apostles.
---
Major tweak: fighters, bombers significantly lose application to subcaps, requiring large dedicated application ewar fleets to support them (could be a module called "Assisting Sensor Sharpener" which gives ONE fighter out of a group of fighters the tracking it needs to project its damage to a subcap).
---
Yeah, to make scanning down sites easier. 
---
Lol
---
Heh, that dreadbomb nerf.
---
I'm not sure whether to grumble at you for using such risk-averse tactics, or the carebear you were shooting for cowering in his structure.
---
I'm guessing some of your fleet had shield fits and bigger sig radii which allowed the structure to lock faster.
---
I don't personally think it will do all that much - It's quite a cautious approach to that scaling for now, which is probably for the best, but you're also probably not burning through tonnes of FAX reps on any well fit titan.
---
https://media1.tenor.com/images/8f161b8964ccc500c58a590b82d9e16a/tenor.gif
---
They actually listened. For once, good job ccp &lt;3
---
Ignoring the lack of quality of this idea, is this balance? I thought balance was just changing preexisting values? Not adding new things
---
You make it seem that in china they say "Ok, today we will learn about Radio Propagation Theory in the absence of the Ionosphere"
---
Then test the students on Carpentry.
---
Every class has a subject. That subject has books associated with it. A person of reasonable intelligence would read the text related to the subject matter and take notes.
---
Fun Fact by the way, NOT ALL OF CHINA ARE CHEATERS. There are many people in china that are disgusted with this, there are a multitude of colleges that hunt down cheaters and expel them. There are many people from china, that come to America with their degrees and are better Doctors or Architects then ours. The people whining about not being able to cheat are fucking losers and will always find an easy way through life. 
---
I'm betting we hit 1000 comments on this - Any takers?
---
Rorqual excavator volume increast means that only 3 will fit into a wetu. Here's a question for CCP - why the fuck is depot ref still a thing? Why are Rorq pilots allowed to save a huge chunk of their ship's value in the first place? This is already on top of 7 minutes of invulnerability (now 6 minutes, although hardly an adequate nerf).
---
those are a lot of reasonable and interesting changes, props
---
fax nerf is mostly a thing for blob fights, they will still be oppressive in small scale, but I am still very excited for a lot of these changes
---
also, excavators being made bigger means you can't stash them all in one wetu now
---
Really CCP?  Your just going to keep on fucking me? [https://imgur.com/a/4NxypX1](https://imgur.com/a/4NxypX1)
---
Minor tweak: subcaps can no longer deal damage or tackle capitals.
---
I think all the folks saying “Nullsec CSM will never advocate against their own interests” will be quiet today. Maybe. 
---
Twist: Every cap using jumpdrive has a very very very slighlty chance to fail and explodes with AOE damage on login. 
---
The poor Gilas! 
---
&gt;Change: We are planning to introduce a new diminishing returns system for the effectiveness of all remote repair and capacitor transmitter modules.
---
jesus christ how can you fuck up balancing something so hard. at this point i wouldnt mind ccp coming out and saying they have no idea what they are doing with capitals and try something new.
---
&gt;High Angle Weapons are a huge perpetrator here, especially when used by large groups of Titans. Easily putting out 5k damage per second each
---
:cripes: Overall this is a good change but the messaging is fucked. Only 1 titan can do 5k DPS and thats the ragnarok with Gyros. If you are using a gyro rag your application sucks because you have a shield tank (unless you don't in which case hello 9m ehp titan)
---
Overall HAW change gets the jay amazingness seal of approval but ccp's messaging of it sucks balls.
---
&gt;Change: Increase explosion radius for all fighter attacks by 15%. Reduce explosion velocity for all fighter attacks by 30%
---
This is good. It encourages people to actually bring subcapitals when using carriers and supercairrers for tackle. I would personally like to see supercarriers lose a support tube and see carriers lose their support tube altogether.
---
Overall, decent change but maybe this will be need to be looked at after a while.
---
&gt;insurance change
---
this is pretty good i guess. fuck poors.
---
&gt;medium lasers optimal increase + harbinger PG buff
---
could be interesting, we will see. the harbinger will still suck though because: 
---
&gt;ferox changes
---
STILL HAS THE DOUBLE OPTIMAL BONUS REEEE
---
&gt;Rorquals
---
Nerfs to mining yield which is pretty much expected every 3 months at this point lol. The increased the size of 'cavators this is pretty good on a few levels. It means you cant store as many in wetus so if you kill a qual then you at least get a few drones. This also kinda hurts people that steal excavators as they have to fit more cargo expanders to scoop the drones which sacrifices some agility.
---
&gt; shield booster and panic nerf
---
this is a good thing.
---
&gt; boosts buff
---
this is probably the start of pushing people back into barges
---
Overall. Some good stuff. Some bad stuff. 6/10
---
thank you
---
TL;DR:
---
-&gt; REPS have diminishing Returns
---
-&gt; Titans lose 50 % HAW Damage
---
-&gt; Fighter Application Nerfed (NErfed Explo radius and velocity)
---
-&gt;Insurance payout nerfed by up top 50%
---
-&gt; Rorq loses Local tank (50% nerfed), excavators lose yield, are bigger now. Panic reduced to 4 min base / 6 Min max. 
---
Notable Subcap changes imo: 
---
-&gt; Gila bonus reduced to 250% (from 500%) 
---
It doesn't really effect anything. You won't be sitting there trying to DPS through the 20 - 30 fax that it'll take for the diminishing returns to matter... I mean you can try and DPS through them while I chew through your dreads lol
---
I have no problem having hulk pilots at a keyboard. That is a step forward.
---
If your PVP fringes on "did we catch a mining fleet' your PVP is probably shit
---
Ccpls
---
Faith in CCP restored
---
please excuse me, i am very sorry. Leave my badger alone.
---
i like this
---
OH FUCK HOLY SHIT
---
I'm sure it will in some way benefit goons and therefore be a sign that EVE is going to die and a reason that the GSM should be disbanded!!!!!
---
hey, that's pretty good
---
no
---
Well i meant more along stainguy posting. beat me to it by a couple of seconds but damn. 
---
Tweak: can only fly two drones maximum.
---
i've also had a sour taste in my mouth from mobile games, but i'm really hoping Echoes will change the industry a little...I really miss playing EVE but I just don't have the time to sit down on my desktop for hours on end.
---
Is this a dream?  
---
Amazing changes CCP. Amazing.
---
What got nerfed for dreadbombs?
---
haha no worries man - I'm not complaining, just asking to own it - like we do.   
---
you can bet we're gonna blob if we can and we're going to do our best not to get blobbed - the main thing is not to pussy out and take the damn fight if you have reasonable numbers and not be afraid to lose the damn ships :)   
---
stranger danger is always invited to our little corner of space and we throw the best nestor disco parties around this block  :)
---
..... Sigh..
---
Comment one change you'd like to see. #Others ruin it with an additional change in reply.
---
Fax nerfs are good it's just that these fax nerfs aren't the real problem with them IMO.
---
It was a joke.
---
If anything this is going to make TiDi fights even more cancerous with the additional calculation overhead needed. They say it won't have a large impact on performance but have they realistically tested it?
---
RIP. Pouring one out for you brother.
---
The math may say 3 volleys, but it's 2.   
---
By the time you account for ticks, human delay, locking time. You area only guaranteed 2 rounds before getting targeted might happen on the third. 
---
Beautiful
---
Skins look very different in different regions of space, and I like it.
---
Change: All Titans and Supercarriers are being removed from the game. 
---
Minor tweak: Characters with Rorqual trained aren't eligible for multiboxing. Circumventing this restriction is permabannable on first offence.
---
That NSA change is dope, fuck your aligned carriers
---
How uniformed of you, my friend
---
thnx brother 
---
&gt;Rep reduction should probably happen faster and harder.
---
I'm hoping they'll rebalance it upwards over time (maybe?)
---
insurance
---
Imo it's mainly in X47 level fights. It's theoretically possible to "win" a fight like that by dropping 2000 dreads now, whereas before, you'd be better off SDing your dreads on your own undock and keeping all the loot. 
---
This has major implications for sovwar generally, since in the current meta, titans can *only* be countered by more titans - so the game is just "get more titans on our side, nothing else matters." A change to this has been sorely needed for many years. 
---
I just like to tell stories...For Example this one from EVE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7q10d5/my\_heartpounding\_supercarrier\_travel\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7q10d5/my_heartpounding_supercarrier_travel_story/)
---
Minor tweak: local disabled while cloaked.
---
What time zone? Also the members have until April to be in fountain. So some will still be bearing in delve and only log in combat alts for fleets. Also, not every corp is based in o-p.
---
Main effect of the bigger excavators: 
---
You can't cram as many into a mobile depot when a red shows up.
---
max size of a mobile depot is 4000 m3. used to be you could fit 5 in it. now you'll get 3.
---
Holy shit, you guys have NO fucking clue what you are doing. Srsly? These are the worst changes I couldve ever imagined. Umbrellas still not nerfed, dreadbombs nerfed, fax changes dont matter but nerf subcap logi, NSA doesnt matter for krabs under the umbrella, esp as its even less ISK effective to kill a super now, but they completly fuck over anyone that does meme supers/carriers.
---
Slap on the wrist for rorqs.
---
The only relevant nerf is the HAW nerf, which is fair but doesnt change the underlying problem.
---
Srsly /u/CCP_Falcon ?
---
RIP: 
---
vexor navys, 
---
gilas, 
---
excavators, 
---
any carrier with an NSA running
---
"Small group" are either renters or pets in NS right now. I've yet to see rorquals being defended by them. Actually I've probably seen more of them self destruct then being saved.
---
it's not an advertisement. I just wanted to share my story...
---
*my mind is going*
---
( loses large gun V )
---
*I can feel it*
---
C O R A X B U F F S
---
frigate balance pass? ♡
---
I really don't like how these Rorqual nerfs only touch smaller guys without a proper umbrella.
---
CCP good changes-  but you just killed drone booshing with this change.
---
I feel like there's a better way of fixing rorquals than killing the sole effective way of impacting rorqual mining.
---
Upping the m3 means it's no longer possible to scoop the excavators....
---
It'd make.no difference, noone lives in whs anyway..
---
Thanks ccp.
---
TLDR:
---
**FAX Changes:**
---
The more FAXes rep a ship the less effective the reps get. Look at the graphs they explain it in a fancy way.
---
&gt;By the 15th rep added (around the 5th FAX) your reps are still 80% effective.  
---
&gt;Your reps hit 50% effectiveness at about 38 reps applied (10 or 11 FAX).  
---
&gt;With 150 capital reps on one target (45 or so FAX) you get a little less than half the total repping power you would have before the change.
---
**Titan Changes:**
---
&gt;Reduce damage multiplier for all High Angle Weapons by 50% and give a corresponding 100% increase to HAW damage from Siege Mode. 
---
HAW Titans Bad -&gt; HAW Dreads okay.
---
**Carrier &amp; SCarrier:**
---
&gt;Increase explosion radius for all fighter attacks by 15%. Reduce explosion velocity for all fighter attacks by 30%. 
---
NSA online -&gt; cant warp away must cycle down to be able to warp (alignment is possible with it online i think)
---
**General:**
---
&gt;We have adjusted the insurance contract cost and payout multipliers for many ship classes, with larger T1 ships generally receiving lower multipliers than smaller ships. This change will be most significant on supercarriers and standard capital ships, which will see their insurance contract costs and payouts reduced by approximately 50% and 33% respectively. 
---
Basically less insurance money for your blown up spaceships.
---
**Subcap Changes:**
---
Basically just tweaking some numbers. Gila looses half the Drone HP role bonus (500%-&gt;250%) VNI looses Drone max velocity bonus. 
---
**Rorqual Changes:**
---
&gt;Reduce the bonus to shield booster amount provided by the Industrial Core to 60% T1 Industrial Cores and 75% T2 (was 120% and 140% respectively)  
---
&gt;Reduce the base duration of the PANIC module to 4 minutes, up to 6 minutes with max skills (was 5 minutes base)
---
&gt;‘Excavator’ Mining Drone base mining yield decreased to 800m3 (was 1000m3)  
---
&gt;‘Excavator’ Ice Harvesting Drone base cycle time slowed to 310s (was 250s)  
---
&gt;Excavator drone volume increased to 1100m3 (was 750m3) and Rorqual dronebay volume increased to 8800m3 (was 6000m3)
---
&gt;Increase the bonus to mining foreman burst strength provided by the Industrial Core to 30% for T1 Cores and 36% for T2 (was 25% and 30% respectively)
---
I'm also fine with your changes and they would be a step in the right direction.  Just saying that if you nerf rorqs it might actually lead to less content which is not a good thing.  Maybe add siege to carriers as well to provide something for people to catch.  
---
I’d recommend MALRO (Malevelon Roe). It is a high sec corporation run by PocketsDK and Ashterothi, both from the Eve podcast community.
---
They are mainly high sec mission runners and also do Abyssal Deadspace BUT have close ties with Federation Uprising (a Gallente Faction Warfare/NullSec Alliance) which is also part of Legacy Coalition (Test Alliance, Brave Newbies etc).
---
So potentially you can start with MALRO to find your feet (they are very friendly), do some low sec roams with them and FEDUP to get the PvP addiction ... migrate to FEDUP, then if the desire is there you could move somewhere bigger like Brave or Test.
---
It’s like there’s a career path ! Stop where you want or carry on until you dominate New Eden.
---
PM me if you want more info and I can put you in touch.
---
Best of luck, wherever you land.
---
&gt;Nerfs to mining yield which is pretty much expected every 3 months at this point lol. The increased the size of 'cavators this is pretty good on a few levels. It means you cant store as many in wetus so if you kill a qual then you at least get a few drones. This also kinda hurts people that steal excavators as they have to fit more cargo expanders to scoop the drones which sacrifices some agility.
---
Just inject more rorq alts I guess
---
holy shit rip the Gila lmao
---
#We also will be picking up where we left off with module tiericide efforts, which have been on the backburner for a while now.
---
Tiercide is back! 😃😃😃
---
Ah, but it's only like a 1/3 reduction in payout. Gladly pay that fee if we get more super kills thanks to the fax nerf in exchange. 
---
I came through a convenient frig hole so bombers made sense given ship choices. I also expect the structure owners to put up a much tougher defense for later timers. With regards to fits, none of the bombers had shield extenders and no one turned on mwds. The astra was not fit with either a targeting rig or sig amp at least before the bash started.
---
RIP my Gila. :(
---
&gt;In July we are planning to introduce some long-anticipated implant sets. We also will be picking up where we left off with module tiericide efforts, which have been on the backburner for a while now.
---
**OH GOD OH FUCK**
---
Since most of it isn't controversial, I doubt. Will sure see a lot of comments for sure tho.
---
Minor tweak: Proposal removed from the devblog altogether.
---
These all look like solid changes honestly. I wish the FAX nerfs and the Rorqual panic nerf went further, but I understand not wanting to go full 100-0 instantly. Most likely a similar approach to how they are scaling back on NS anomalies.
---
Tweak:
---
The game plays a mocking musical riff when this happens.
---
:D
---
This patch will nerf everything Ive worked so hard to build...  And I couldn't be happier.  This is going to do a lot for the health of the game.
---
same with the NSA change. What goon cares when u get tackled? With dreads nerfed theres no way to kill a super isk efficiently. 
---
All the small entities that will be vulnerable due to the NSA will just go join the blob and krab there. Everyone doing meme supers/ carriers? ya, cucked over.
---
Change: Instead of being a security mission, gates are now regularly camped by rats with more frequently used gates being camped more frequently. 
---
I prefer mooching around in WHs
---
So even less dread bombs because of higher cost and independed people / small corp members won't ever use carriers and supers for pve so they will switch to botting VNIs?
---
I suppose technically it's changing the value of the CanUseT2 flag from 0 to 1
---
i am glad you feel that way :) yeah we rarely turn around. has lead to some rather hilarious losses. 
---
Nestor disco DOES sound fun
---
VNI's will be fine since they can still field 5x Heavy Drones. Your choice is to either armor tank and use drone navs or get slightly lower ticks. The cost of the VNI and it's continued ability to AFK sites means it will still be king in its field.
---
Cap ratting is dead.
---
Yep. The longterm legacy of not understanding anything continues...
---
Literally the only good thing to come out of this is the fax 'nerf' and even that is largely irrelevant outside of the the bi-yearly NC+Horde vs Goons+Test tidi fuckfest.
---
Ccpls kamikaze module tbh, detonates all ordnance you can fit in carfo
---
Sounds good
---
I'm still in doubt whether I missed something in the patch notes, but I'm not sad or upset about this patch, which is a weird feeling.
---
I fitted up a Rorq for my alt for several billions just yesterday. Since I ve read that dev-blog I cant stop throwing up. Vomit-levels are about to reach the ceiling... Cant... breathe... HALP!
---
Nerf mass scale skillfarming then. All they have to do is disable extracting a given skill more than once.
---
As far as I know, subscriptions should be exactly the same on Steam or otherwise, else everyone would just take whatever option is cheapest. Tying your account to Steam also leads to various complications down the line, so I would avoid it. 
---
If you do reroll, you'd probably have to start an entirely new account, which means new characters, but you can skip the tutorial at any point. 
---
yea this is really big and impacts a lot of aspects from catching ratters who cant warp off to some dumbo super pilot who cant turn off his NSA when told to before a fleet warp.
---
I think the meta will change for ratting supers though. They would just fit sensor boosters and can still be very safe while ratting which sucks.
---
You might be right, but I know that I was targeted within the 15 second warp disruption timer that starts when you agress the structure. That would be &lt;2 volleys and much too short for the astra to achieve unless it was able to carry over targeting from the previous set of volleys.
---
Yeah, actually even less, since the cost is less, its closer to something like a 2/9ths reduction. 
---
Oh? What'd I miss? Dreads receiving less insurance is a nerf. It ain't a big one, but it is one.
---
Quick, someone photoshop and post Falcon with a Nerf bat
---
Thats the problem, any buff to them is a massive buff to those with a super umbrella
---
Any nerf is a massive nerf to those without a super umbrella
---
Also you guys just had 2 big corps leave you for goons
---
Very good nerfs, the rorq panic could be nerfed a little bit more though
---
Good one CCP
---
That diminishing returns on reps thing is a loooong time coming.
---
The second Elo Knight decides he's burnt out, probably
---
Please don't grief yourself over taking that break with your grandma. You do have a right to have a life beside your obligation at least for a few hours, especially when caring 24/7 for months. That club was important for you at that time. 
---
Furthermore, I have repeatedly heard that people on the verge of death often prefer to be left alone. They know it's over and have accepted the fact. It's hard on us, not on them.
---
Maybe this was Bob's doing, who knows.
---
Peace Bro
---
Minor Tweak: Can only be used when you use Proteus Augemented Speed Propulsion System. It takes 5 lowslots away.
---
As u/Ask_For_Sources said.
---
the fucking expectations and the social "norm" of how much studying is necessary **is the fucking problem**.
---
Supporting that is not an easy way through life; supporting that is supporting a *reasonable* way through life. That's what you don't understand.
---
I haven't supported cheating one bit in any of my comments, so fucking read properly before counter-pointing a point that never was mentioned.
---
Anything you're seriously trying to rep with that number of logi e.g. 40 guardians is likely gonna be getting volleyed through anyway, so I'd say might not be an issue.
---
you can bring a blockade runner with your booshing group to scoop the drones.
---
HYPE
---
would be great to disable the fitting of sebos to capitals
---
Heh, those multiple rorqual nerfs
---
Holy moly fuck me dry and dirty I can't believe that CCP actually are doing this. Falcon if this is an out of season april fool's joke I swear to Bob I'm gonna glass Iceland to the ground !
---
Me happy right now oh boi
---
CAN WE GET 1000 LIKES ON THIS POST
---
You know I haven’t been more excited in a long time for eve
---
Nice changes I say.
---
Their original plan was to move real slaves to a different lp store and have sansha do shield slaves
---
Xenuria still talking to himself in O-V local?
---
Minor Tweak: Excavators now have their own session change timer and will request docking permit, which needs to be processed by internal rorqual workers. So docking uses traffic control mechanic and can take up to 180s
---
Nestor discos sound fun.... Feel free to mail me in-game and let's make that shit happen 
---
i dont think disabling the fitting of a core module like the sensor booster would be the right way to go. Maybe just fuck the scan res without the NSA into the ground. So its like you use the NSA or you have 40 second lock times.
---
Diminishing reps have been talked about for years and I've always been scared they'd implement it in a way that just made the game into an N+1 DPS race but that curve actually looks like it could be really interesting.
---
But at least when tackling them with sabres it’s way easier as they can’t just insta lock you + the application nerf 
---
Whats the cycle time on the NSA?
---
Not everyone flies carriers, ty.
---
minor tweak- its a photo of CCP falcon sexyposed
---
60 seconds
---
29
---
It’s ok I won’t shoot your badger haha. One day I would like to have a badger fight club or t1 industrial fight club. Or maybe a cannonball run around lowsec with them. I usually do dumb stuff like this when I’m playing. 
---
I guess it was worth 6 months of recurring reddit threads, although the last month was even fucking worst than I though. I eagerly await for this patch to hit live. The NSA change is gold, that's pretty big for hunters no more "yeah my super was aligned get fucked". Rorqual got the nerfbat they deserved, I didn't though they would nerf the boost amount would rather have PANIC be nerfed even more but honestly, I will take it.
---
The diminishing return on logi is hard to guess. I don't know large capital meta that much, but I still feel like you still have to focus FAXes first in case of a dread bomb. Good to see subcap balance and here about other stuff (calling it now, trig dread !)
---
Absolutely love these balance changes. A huge step in the right direction by CCP.
---
The new aura (at the bottom of the devblog) will increase player retention by at least 9001%
---
As soon as I saw CCP's Falcon memes I knew that patch was gonna be good regardless of the details... and holy shit it is indeed, praise CCP!
---
Awesome, thank you for answering.
---
60seconds is plenty of time to get a sabre or an interceptor onto a ratting carrier. I love this change.
---
These changes look great!
---
Medium beams though ccp? Really? Out of all the medium weapon systems needing tweaks beams is very low on the list.
---
BRING BACK AUTOCANNONS 2019
---
&gt; Basically just tweaking some numbers. Gila looses half the Drone HP role bonus (500%-&gt;250%) VNI looses Drone max velocity bonus.
---
did you just chose to ignore the buff Medium Beams just got.... 10 fucking percent to optimal.
---
Thats a HUGE buff
---
No i forgot to put that in there -.-
---
True. As a game it sucks. It's the people making it alive.
---
Dont stop it, I'm enjoying the fuck out of this.
---
I've been wanting this for fucking AGES now. I'm glad CCP are looking to get tiericide done again.
---
looks like CCP fixed the carrier issue with NSA change, YEE HAW
---
yea thats the main issue with rorquals as long as they are still as good as 1 hulk they are worth using because of the survivability of them
---
Entirely conjecture, but that almost looks like "glow in the dark" shaders on the green bits in the ship preview (compared to the well lit station hangar). "Metamaterial" applies to materials that have properties like glow-in-the-dark effects iirc, which would line up with what I'm seeing here.
---
It's definitely something i've thought about but i don't know how she would feel about being bait.
---
The NSA has a really long cycle time, gankers are going to have a field day. Not sure the nerf needs to be this heavy.
---
nah.
---
Holy fuck rorqual eating 2 nerf bats at once.
---
You hang out in the same hold for months on end?
---
i mean who wasn't expecting that shit
---
i wasn't expecting a dreadbomb nerf
---
When and why did they introduce FAX?
---
not really
---
Exit strategy. Autz WHs
---
It has a 1 minute cycle time which is pretty balanced, any less and there is no point in having a nerf, any more and there is no point in using it. Gankers will only have a field day on people who a) are botting or 2) not paying attention. Both of which deserve to die.
---
Holy moly
---
Right, except Orientalism is real, and there is a very clear history of the classification of the Oriental "Other," not to mention that, despite someone else wondering otherwise, non-caucasian people from all over the world have been racially categorized and had that categorization used as the justification for European and American colonialism, and discrimination in both Europe and the Americas for hundreds of years.
---
Still 3 too many
---
Guacamole
---
it's a ~50% nerf to the indycore tank bonus.
---
it rolls out to like a ~30% tank nerf.
---
If you say so.
---
&gt;best balance patch in 5 years
---
NO NIGHTHAWK BUFF? FUCK YOU, I'M OUT!
---
Looks great. Why is there still insurance on ships if I don’t insure them? Maybe limit to T1 ships BS and below?
---
Its possible just harder, the command dessies lose a lot of agility to accomplish the same thing.
---
wonder how many my ship wouldn't warp tickets they get in week one
---
The fact that it isn't both rule #1 &amp; 2 explains some things about crack dealers
---
Whole point of eve balancing is diminishing returns.   
---
1 Faction BS is better than 1 Regular BS, or a Regular BC, or a Regular cruiser, etc etc....  
---
1 Faction BS also loses to a tiny fraction of its isk worth in frigates.  
---
So too should it be with supers - the whole point of titans/supers is that they're a way of consolidating power into less players by spending obscene amounts of isk.  
---
What little balance there was with stuff like Init getting raped by the losec groups and whelping a revenant and some(iirc more than 1) titans because they weren't prepared with proper fax basically vanishes because the one good advantage dreadbombs had over supers was insurance.  
---
CCP did little to nothing to balance caps vs caps and instead further buffed the "supercaps helicopter dick everything with almost no counter." The fax reps were a good change in the right direction as it would mean more large scale dread bombs might have a chance at doing some damage rather than feeding and whelping a dread fleet (as NC, Test, Goons, etc etc) have all learned by experience when deploying somewhere without their own superblob.  
---
While NC/Test/Goons can still do this due to their immense income, the smaller groups now have little chance as insurable dreads was pretty much their best shot.  
---
TL;DR - Dreadbombs got a chance at being actually useful this patch, but were quickly smacked back down by becoming entirely pointless as dreadbombs still feed hard to supers (as they should) while losing their only advantage (cost).
---
Nah man. if they fit sebos, that means less tank or less omnis/application. I'm happy with this change.
---
Nah, I do think there should be SOME reward for rorqual pilots who are actually paying attention.  They can't save all of them, but if they are on the ball they can save a few even if they mess everything else up.
---
This patch might just break r/eve.    I've never seen such positivity here before.
---
Wow! These changes are great! And tiericide hasn't been forgotten!
---
Why spend a few hundred mil to gun your ship when you can inject and use T2 weapons?
---
good.
---
&gt;ombs because of higher cost and independed people / small corp members won't ever use carriers and supers for pve so they will switch to botting VNI
---
Fax nerf is not going to affect small scale dread bombs which get hammered by these changes by increasing costs.
---
Oh yeah what a fucking shame, I mean we just got carriers, rorquals, HOW titans nerf, various improvement on subcaps and other incoming long waited items and ships but yes, sorry, really sad to not see ECM in this.
---
What an effort. I like it, but it’s painfully slow to watch. 
---
It would actually make more sense if those antenna extended when you dropped probes, and was nothing to do with warp.
---
youre just dumb
---
I heard the reason they don't want to do shield slaves is because shield has passive recharge, and that can be (dunno if true?) affected by your total shield pool. So like, a purgwr rattlesnake already has massive passive, non-neutable shield recharge. Adding high grade shield slaves to that would make an already pretty bonkers setup even more nutty.
---
Could be talking out my ass though, don't know the actual numbers. If true, lol purger ragnaroks? Lololol
---
[Falcon Balance Expert](https://imgur.com/a/qxNJqPW)
---
#*falls on floor sobbing*
---
... I had almost lost hope
---
What I like is that it means if carrier pilots are paying attention to their intel channels, they might still be able to get out if they are active and checking.
---
This change is really going to fuck up bots, which is nice :)
---
ehhh, if we're doing the net insurance it's still a 1/3 reduction as the cost and payout are reduced the same.
---
how dare you
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
\#falconchallenge
---
If you are being targeted and then cloak and decloak before the timer is up the lock may be successful. You need to be cloaked at the time the lock would finish to 100% not be targeted. Had this problem with sleepers.
---
Maybe they can make the fucking things cost less. With this a rorq will do what, 100mil ish an hour? What even is the point then to risk an 8-10B ship for it. :\\
---
lol yea speaking of the devil.  Also increasing the size of excavators so they don't all fit in the wetu.  
---
Holy fuck, well done CCP.
---
I for one salute our new overlords, Pearl Abyss for making the impossible happen.
---
fair
---
So if I were to rat in a VNI, would I clear more than a carrier considering the spawning changes, the fact NSAs might be dropped and fighters are nerfed?
---
I'm just wondering if they will re-balance passive tanking to compensate for shield slaves. You can already get 1.2k EHP/sec on a passive snake, now add a 50% bonus to that with implants.
---
i mean i'm happy that you got your rant out and all but all i was talking about was the insurance
---
a nerf can be a nerf on its own merit without considering the wider ecosystem
---
Sadly it also kills excavator booshing/stealing, which is :sadface:
---
tiny nerf to VNI
---
I wouldn't say "Hammered". a 30% decrease in insurance isn't *that* massive. 
---
Also, the FAX nerf starts to kick in around 10 Faxes which isn't that wild of a number for responding to a dread bomb. 
---
And with the NSA change we might get more chances to drop on  supers.
---
I guess killing TEST carriers is fair trade.
---
It'll mean more drone deaths in the Abyss to people who aren't paying attention. Gilas will still be the go-to event ship though, it's not like they're loosing any DPS or application.
---
I wonder if dual sebos will be a thing again.
---
Okay, thank you for the clarification on mechanics.
---
The point is that most people with them have already invested, and made back the isk.  On top of that, it is super easy, basically passive and safe isk.  Yeah, it takes a while to make it back, but most people make it back while watching youtube or netflix, or running so many of them it doesn't matter.
---
Making them cheaper would discourage the booshing, which while annoying, is an interesting and innovative counter to the rorqual spam.
---
This will surely make the botters of the Dronelands extremely happy from Excavators getting killed off with each Rorqual kill.  CCP be like, let's get rid of the botters, but at the same time let's throw them a bone so they can still make heaps of ISK.  This way the players are getting what they want, and we keep getting botters paying us more money.
---
Killing any carriers is good. This is a great patch.
---
everyone with brain will just turn that off when whole wave is locked and then again for another one and so on ... 
---
nothing really big happening here unless you are brainded
---
So what's the over/under on faxes getting nerfed?
---
Same thing here. Use the Gila all the time.
---
They didn't say anything about NSA preventing jumping.
---
From what I've read in many countries the prices on Steam are very different for some reason. Or maybe Steam lies about the prices, I don't know.
---
Wonderful
---
Only the gila
---
Look how they massacred my boy ;-
---
chain booshing still not nerfed :thanging:
---
Silver Mt Zion are pretty rad.
---
Add shield slaves but make them have a shield recharge penalty.
---
Why not just reduce fax rep power, the ship on its own is op able to cancel out 3 dreads worth of fp. This change does nothing to affect the small and medium level cap fights and fax will continue to oppress them.
---
Considering how the last goon I tried to work with (tiberizzle) quit the capital balancing group, I can understand how that would fly above your head as a rant. Enjoy the rorqual mining. ;)
---
It's dead, unless you have a cyno.
---
except these changes hurt the little guy while making it so that the big blocks have literally no difference their gameplay
---
LOL.  Guess you need to open a second account to get that blockade runner alt made.  CCP wins again.
---
Show him some mercy.
---
how is this diminishing return on reps gonna affect tidi battles?
---
if i understood it correctly the server will calculate incomming reps per second and diminish it accordingly?
---
thats gotta add a lot of stress on the node in the next x-47/ualx fight
---
This mentality is incorrect, and unhealthy for balance discussions as a whole. There is no ship change that is going to solely effect the larger groups while leaving the smaller ones untouched. Justifying a lack of change on that basis will kill balance ovetall, and entropy favors the already entrenched groups.
---
The best way to nerf the hyper dense null groups is to force them to spread out, stretching their cap umbrellas as far as possible, while supporting mechanics that will severely limit their projection of massive force (basically nerfing cyno mechanics/buffing inhibs)
---
Any changes that support subcap viability and nerf capital viability hurt the umbrellas, which is a good thing. Dont drink the koolaid man, these nerfs will hurt the big guys too, no matter what they say ;)
---
Wait, if we get tiricide, shield slaves, and nerfs to capital application, insurance, and FAX reps, What will we have left to complain about?
---
SKINs are meant for deeper enjoyment of ship spinning.
---
The big guys in mining (pretty much goons at this point) have been saying for a while that any nerf to mining will impact smaller groups more.
---
The problem is, you have to stifle the bleeding somewhere.  Yes, it is going to be harder for other groups to catch up, but if they don't stem the bleeding at some point, the mineral market is going to continue to be crushed.  I am glad they are cutting the losses on this one, even if it is going to mean that other groups can't catch up it HAD to be done.
---
inb4 titans passive tanking entire fleets of dreads w/ slaves
---
I mean this might be a pretty optimistic view, but it's not a particularly intensive calculation. Something like "a single fighter squad" is pretty wildly complex because all sorts of things like cooldown, tracking, position/velocity vectors, ability CDs, etc all have to be calculated, which is computationally expensive as shit. 
---
For this, it'd be similar to calculating damage, but with a little averaging on top to calculate the scaling debuff. Only needs to be done on the ship receiving the reps, not all the ships delivering them, too.
---
I don't know shit about how CCP mom's spaghetti code is written so for all I know they might have some wildly funky implementation that makes this all moot but it seems logical. inb4 "it cant be that hard just code it in all the pieces already exist"
---
What's your issue with the RR diminishing returns thing?
---
are we all supposed to unsub now? someone tell me how to feel about all this.
---
I wonder how the sig radius increase will work for damage taken
---
now that FAX are nerfed, plus the fact ratting supers are almost never buffer fit + resists, a handful of dreads will do great
---
&lt;copypasta&gt;  
---
People often conflate the CODEdot alliance and the New Order of Highsec. The New Order is the original meta movement created by James 315 that claims Highsec and sells mining permits to the people who try to live there. Anybody can join the New Order simply by declaring support for The Code and ganking stuff. The CODEdot alliance was created independently, under the New Order "brand", by those interested in attracting incoming wardecs. Membership in is entirely optional and CODEdot is a strict subset of the New Order.
---
&lt;/copypasta&gt;
---
the NSA murders your cap, if you are just using sebos it's very likely you can just cyno out if you are paying attention  as you won't be below 71% cap.
---
Really? These changes make you happy? "the mother of all balance patches" and this is what we get?  
---
I get that CCP understanding the issues is great considering they haven't done any balance changes lately, but these changes don't really change anything. These are a minor footnote at best tbh.  
---
HAW titans will just be bring 2 instead of 1, fax changes won't really affect anything, ferox nerfs in the completely wrong area.
---
Maybe I just expected a lot more with how they hyped it, but these are just really underwhelming.
---
Get the hell out of my Hierarchy
---
each other?
---
Good point.
---
Most avid ratters don't leave the thing running, they pulse it.
---
Three years ago with capital changes
---
\*looks at his KB\* I dunno what you re talking bout o,O
---
Likewise but meh. There is no point playing to make isk after this as nothing makes any sort of viable rate unless you have a HUGE number of VNI alts, or like 10+ rorqs :\\ Will be what, maybe 300mil/hr with 3 rorqs. It just isn't worth bothering once this hits. Less of an issue for those who have already scaled up and got in when it was very powerful though.
---
Can you jump while tackled?
---
it doesnt address the issue that faxes are still 8m ehp bricks that will need to be killed first.
---
Idk. Small groups without massive capital umbrella are going to pay the biggest price.
---
K, good point :D
---
The core issue with shield slaves is that all of the shield supercaps are already balanced around them not existing. So the right way to look at the current state of affairs is that armor supers have to buy slaves, shield supers get them for free.
---
wtf i love ccp now
---
I like trains
---
Are you referring to the Wetu?
---
8 subcap changes
---
M O T H E R O F A L L B A L A N C E P A T C H E S
---
Slam few more extenders to a pontifex.
---
really though, adding a mechanic to keep wormholes open by constructing a player owned stargate that anyone could travel through, with a couple reinforcement timers would be fun as hell.
---
Maybe make it use a ton of fuel and if the fuel runs out the WH dies, and it can be killed
---
Maybe we can finally get that lowsec gate to stain!
---
it's a rant, you're going off on a bunch of tangents about shit i ain't even talkin' about and that have no relevance to my point
---
just disable capitals
---
CCP, go home. You re drunk.
---
&gt; The Fax changes are honestly confusing and will make logistics a bit of a headache. 
---
Honestly, this is the most interesting part for me.  Yes, this is mainly a big blog thing, but it has the potential to shake up some norms (fleet primaries target -&gt; other fleet gets essentially all reps on it -&gt; repeat) in those big fleets depending on where numbers end up.
---
Yeah i'd petition that, shit looks way different than it should.
---
This might be a stupid question, but is there anything preventing someone from just anchoring two depots? Could an alt do it?
---
we are currently in the process of figuring out how to run a standing fleet, we just learned that two fleets are not a good idea with 20 players. Please stand by as we learn how to undock. future plans may also include training members on the proper use of the F1 key but may take some time.
---
Quality. Patch notes released, medium beams buffed
---
I mean whats the cycle time ... if long enough, it's still risky ... wh's boyyyyyys :D
---
Minor tweak: it's all C4s
---
Its going to hurt wormhole ratting.
---
So many krabs are gonna die. It will be glorious.
---
fit an armor rep and 2 sebos there u go
---
P much
---
Blackops can fit capital torpedo launchers
---
TIL.
---
I was looking for an easily recognized subset of CODE. for the joke, thought CODE. and New Order were synonymous.
---
Hello the Algerian dude apparently with a pretty heavy accent IS FUCKING ME and i'm the most lovely person in the univers and of all times everyone know that kneel now.
---
Thanks to all the people who have in recent times made a lot of noise, let their subs lapse, quit and sold their characters, or even biomassed.  These changes may be years late, and nowhere near significant enough to reverse the sad state of the game for small-scale and competitive pvp, but at least we know CCP will listen to *something*.
---
Rorq tank nerf, yield nerf, panic nerf, capital insurance nerf, carrier application nerf, escapeability (don't think that's a word but whatev) nerfed, haw titans nerfed, fax reps nerfed, and nothing but buffs for some subcaps... how could I not be happy about this?
---
Only things that would make me happier would be to delete local, panic, and asset safety. This is a good day.
---
i mean its a good set of changes but this is not "the mother of all balance patches"
---
if ccp keeps this up monthly or bi-monthly i'll change my mind but tbh if this turns out to be the one balance patch this year i'm not exactly happy
---
Both the Wetu and the Yurt.
---
they all rage quit because of the rorq nerf.
---
Someone should also tell us how many people actively hunt rorqual and how many doesn't play this game anymore and just bitch on reddit (don't take it personally, I've met people who did not log for the last 4 years but know what and why eve is wrong right now).
---
When it comes to rorq people aim for the biggest thing : Drones, ask Olmeca how powerful rorq tank/panic mod is against his boosher.
---
I am so happy for these upcoming changes!
---
Still works you just need to be quick with a blockade runner etc
---
So you would turn every super into a Scorpion Navy Issue (30-40s lock times)?
---
SNI approves at sharing its burden.
---
Minor tweak: citadel resists bumped up to 90% Omni to compensate.
---
You're wrong. They said they're reducing cost by 1/2 but payout by 1/3rd.
---
Just to be sure here: Does "disallowing to warp" include "disallow to jump out" for sure?
---
did you not read supers get a 50% decrease.
---
So now, 20 Dreads, around 40billion isk will drop on a 40bil combat fit super. If it kills the super, the dreads get back way more isk then the super will.
---
Dreads are created quicker, and easier to seed.
---
I understand that the dread pilots get back less isk now, however that isk can be made up with market trading, contracts for a group, or recovered via moon mining.....
---
I have known that to be there like forever.
---
It also means that small pvp groups can't use 100mn gilas as effectively. It's a really gay fleet comp, but it's excellent for small alliances with competent multiboxers.
---
that doesnt hold true for subcaps though
---
Yes you are right, it needs to be at least 90% nerf.
---
second one could be done, but has to be at least 6km away from the first. 
---
Not impossible, but still some more risk.
---
Check my number of rorq kills this year mate
---
*is* 10% that much? A 50km optimal is now 55km. It doesn't seem that huge imo.
---
maybe for a battleship do like 20 seconds but yea. its the only way that the NSA wont be removed from fits for the sensor booster
---
Granted I don't have all the ships in the game and haven't experienced all the content, but it doesn't feel like we really need to be balanced. They need to focus on risk vs reward, on hi sec, and the war Dec system.
---
Where the citadel nerfs
---
The ruinous capacitor requirements of an NSA should help with that. I guess you can clown fit your carrier to be at jump cap with the NSA running, though.
---
Fucking finally. Super happy with the changes but I fear little will change in the carrier meta. Also delet panic
---
Also really hope CCP actually iterates on this one.
---
Why? Fighter apply less so you need the drone application mods even more carriers dont have infinite fitting space. With the changes you now have to choose between nö warping, no application or no lockspeed
---
All I see is everything costing more ISK. Thanks CCP. Industrialists will be richer than ever.
---
You still have the dmg cap and only if it's not fueled. Cit spam would be even worse lol
---
yeah, 95% nerf is reasonable, i agree.
---
Check your intel channels, keep your scouts out if you're in a super, and set your NSA to auto-repeat OFF.
---
Really not that hard.
---
A recognized subset of CODE. is The Conference Elite, although I'm not sure how well that would work in a joke.
---
Just imagine the outrage of all the redditers if lets say bomber-DPS would be mildly nerfed by 30%.
---
seems pretty good
---
also lolsec https://imgs.ovh/i/Jb5V4H.gif
---
&gt; There is no ship change that is going to solely effect the larger groups while leaving the smaller ones untouched.
---
Actually the scaling fax nerf does just this - it makes it a lot less helpful to bring more fax once you have about 50 on grid, negating one advantage of having a bigger fleet. 
---
I don't see any good way to apply this to rorquals, though.
---
&gt; There is no ship change that is going to solely effect the larger groups while leaving the smaller ones untouched
---
-0.01% yield for every pilot you're blue to
---
Compared to now when they're aligned and ready to warp 95% of the time, they'll now be able to warp what, 50-70% of the time? I don't carrier rat so not sure of the exact time but every cycle of the NSA is a 1 minute window where they can be caught that they couldn't have before.
---
&gt;May not be deployed within 6km of another Mobile Depot, within 50km of Stargates or Stations, or within 40km of a Starbase.
---
The tank or Rorquals as it were was just retarded.
---
Sweet, you ran the best fleet I ever did in WTM. You didn't even have a caustic SJW toady screeching at everyone.
---
It's buffing its links to more throwaway barges which is good and which is supposed to be the point of them anyways.
---
And if you want cheaper Excavs, go farm Elite Drone AI in Drone Patrols out in the east and run ORE Missions for the bpcs
---
Super insurance hasn't mattered since circa 2009 or so when they nerfed it the first time to be basically useless.  
---
20 dreads can certainly kill a super, but I'm more concerned with 50-100 dreads dropping on 50-100 supers kinda scale. Groups like old school BL being able to feed mass amounts of insured dreads to kill several supers/titans and be isk positive is a good thing for the game. It puts a check on the 'risk-free' super dropping that started with turd carriers/slowcats and continued with alt fax.  
---
This change directly impacts that, which I feel is very unhealthy for the game.
---
What again leads me to not the Rorq being the problem, but the supers. Especially their ability to be anywhere in territory within seconds. I m still thinking capitals shouldnt be jump-capable at all.
---
Why all those gila bpcs dieing lately jafeel someone had inside knowledge
---
About time, I guess?
---
Idgaf anymore though I think. Oh well.
---
**High-grade Virtues** ***ccplease***
---
Only slightly better than a phoenix.
---

---
where is that screenshot of the new sets
---
from fanfest years ago
---
no love for med autocannons :(
---
Good timing.  Just bought a Titan.  I expect the build cost is going to go up now.
---
&gt; Cyclone CPU increased by 25
---
You mean I can finally use a T2 scram on a battlecruiser! Wtf I love CCP now.
---
Minor tweak: if a FW side is not chosen, you are at war against all factions.
---
the only thing it'll really force is more coordination between fax pilots, instead of "everyone rep this guy now" as the numbers aren't really dramatic enough.
---
I have 3. I haven't made fuck all of the value back :( Mostly due to being in an awkward time zone, and being cloaky camped for months on end. Once the nerf hits its 300mil an hour total for that, knowing that when you do get dropped you are guaranteed to lose 6B in drones (ish)  at a minimum because "fuck you" and have even less time to actually get a response fleet.  Buy plex. Much easier to make isk that way.
---
Excited to see how this plays out, but the changes to remote rep stacking are something I've been thinking about in various forms for a while and I'm glad to see ccp at least shaking it up and giving themselves some more levers to pull if it's wrong in either direction.
---
wait... this is an april patch... is this an off season april fools?!
---
First DPS caps, now RR caps... What will they think of next!
---
I was about to suggest they shouldn't be able to fit a local rep but I guess 95% nerf is good for a start
---
CTRL + F: Enforcer
---
Goddammit!
---
Also, was anyone else expecting a quicker dropoff in reps stacking penalty?
---
Look carefully at the sub cap changes as a whole.
---
Medium Beams+Harbinger buffs and Ferox speed nerfs and sig increase (also, abaddon buff).
---
Put them all together, and its CCP going "Use a medium beam harb to counter Ferox fleet now". A plated harb might be faster now than the ferox (will need to check numbers), which means a Ferox fleet can't just sit at range and out kite the harb, and the harb now has more range to hit the Ferox.
---
The Abaddon damage bonus is interesting, probably unrelated to Ferox stuff. But you're going to get some crazy damage with an abaddon now.
---
I love how the tank nerf will do absolutely nothing to the parties that contribute the most ore to the problem.
---
Yeah I can't wait to fit a T2 MSE on my ~~plated cruiser~~ corax!
---
TL;DR does it add a lowsec gate to Stain?
---
Wow an extra 6% will make such a difference and totally make up for 20% nerf to the actual mining volume of rorqs. I guess the kicker is being later to the party means you get nothing, vs those who got in when you could pull 450mil per hour with rorqs.
---
GL having jump cap if you have been using an NSA for more then 2 sites
---
Minor tweak: Targetting range gets reduced 3% per level
---
It's back in July, assuming it doesn't get delayed. But it's back!
---
&gt; The only relevant nerf is the HAW nerf,
---
Just....no...
---
It's extremely easy to fit a ratting super to be cap stable at 71%. Dunno about regular carriers.
---
And the "why" was to get away from spider tanking (super)carriers.
---
&gt; Excavator drone volume increased to 1100m3 (was 750m3)
---
U/Olmeca what say you??
---
I could live with this.
---
I'd wait until we actually see the numbers or it gets confirmed somewhere, but you can read the change two ways as posted.
---
1. As you say, cost is reduced by 1/2 and payout by 1/3. I think this unlikely.
---
2. Alternatively, Supers get a 50% reduction to insurance cost/payout and regular capitals get a 33% reduction.
---
The latter keeps the insurance cost:payout ratio consistent across all ship types as now. Using your interpretation, the cost of a platinum insurance contract would drop from the current 30% of payout to 23% of the payout.
---
It will slightly increase damage taken?
---
The bots are doing something. They're just doing it automatically.
---
Why are you wanting to nerf rorqual mining value so badly? You realize they are 15-20B isk ships and another 50B isk + worth of skills right (bc everyone injects that shit)? If anything you should be wishing for them to drive the rorqual tank straight into the ground and increase yield so more people use them and more simpler targets to murderzone!
---
Oh I didn't even see your interpretation on my reading, that's an equally valid reading. Sorry for my assholishness, good spot
---
Why can't you just find a use for your super then? Or are you too scared to venture outside the goon super umbrella?
---
&gt; fax changes dont matter but nerf subcap logi
---
you got it backwards, my dude.
---
Beam Zealot shoots to 90km now.
---
Makes sense, has CCP told them to multibox yet?
---
Passive shield tanks require capacitor to regen, so they are quite neutable. Shield power relays fuck your capacitor too
---
I know people are all excited about this, but it really doesn't do much beyond fighting the occasional bot and semi-afker. Those who pretty much already instawarp off grid when a neut comes in will do the same. Even if they have to wait a whole cycle, the amount of time it would take to dscan, warp, and tackle a carrier is probably going to be more than the NSA's time.
---
50 faxes still tank a ridiculous amount of DPS when combined with deadspace resist mods and command boosts. It definitely makes a difference but you can still tank 75 SR dreads with 45 fax in a passive fit erebus which has just about the worst resists of any supercap.
---
big bad Fcore bear too scary?
---
undock, go to a darker corner of the system, station lights are washing it out
---
The directors intended to sure, but the corp didn't.
---
Who fucking want to fly a 10b loot pinata when you can fly a 500m barge and have the same yield as long as one rorqual is in belt ?
---
That makes sense. Thanks!
---
No plex sale, no addressing citadel spam, lowsec or wh woes, simple shit like default UI setup, etc. Don't get too excited yet.
---
I mean, CCP botches chat for 9 months and nearly has to backtrack on it and has to pay out SP repeatedly. But they can fuck up capital balance and gilas/VNIs and rorqs for YEARS and win everyone back just by moderately nerfing that stuff and managing to not mention new skins for 5 minutes?
---
s n i p e r z e a l o t s
---
I always knew they'd come back
---
mass exhumer fleets are bomb bait
---
There's a lot of work left to do but it looks like a great start. Shit after 3 years of waiting I'm glad these problems are finally being taken seriously.
---
I like the fax nerf and all the others but I think the diminishing reps curve is a little too strong imo. Fax 11 being 50% effective is pretty aids and, meaning (fuck doing the math) number 17-18 is 10%? Should be more like fax 30 imo
---
mining ship - combat ship 
---
see the difference?
---
I’m referencing this man’s interpretation of facts on the ground and y’alls response to said facts on the ground. #vilyandprogoddidnothingwrong
---
Small groups will always bear the brunt, unfortunately. They are least able to adapt.
---
Holy shit...BOYS WE ARE AT
---
#HAPPENING DEFCON ONE
---
Yeah I agree - overall decent balance changes. I wouldn’t mind more HAW damage nerf % with increase in % tracking though, it’s kind of silly a gang of assault frigates could effectively afk orbit a titan and kill it. I do, however, appreciate that CCP is trying to establish a tangential line in escalation from small subcap &gt;&gt; big subcap &gt;&gt; capital &gt;&gt; super &amp; titan.
---
I don’t understand why they keep nerfing rorqual yields though, if anything they should buff the yield and nuke the tank to like a carrier or something. Nerfing the yields just influence people to stop using them leading to less targets and less content. People don’t realize rorquals are a pretty significant content generator in today’s game.
---
Just my after thoughts.
---
Not happy about it with my 2x LSE fit. Armor tanking isn't all that great in Angel space either :(
---
That’s a bridge too far. :)
---
Smash that mf comment button
---
Fax nef to supers - check
---
More risk in super ratting - check
---
More risk in Rorq mining - check
---
Caps more painful to lose - check

Bit of laser love - check

Reason for every bloody doctrine to be less Ferox - check
---
Potential for the cyclone to be used in some way - check

I will take this one... good job
---
you are like the dumbest idiot ever LMAO
---
Booshing drones isn't the sole effective way to impact rorq mining
---
They nerfed the tank, you see...the rorq dying will also impact rorq mining I dare say
---
Quick? Don't forget the actual timeline on these issues because of how quick it seemed like falcon edited the blog since his tweet. They've had years to make most of these changes and only just got to it now, when malcontent was reaching pretty fairly high fucking levels.

[heres a picture of how old this is](https://i.imgur.com/ntLDtgf.jpg)

\^ This \^ 
---
EVE is the game that everyone you meet "Used to play back in the day"
---
So, I can confirm that the SKIN is appearing correctly in client (I just double checked in case someone accidentally deleted a pattern).    
---
There are a couple of points of interest here, though, which might be worth mentioning:  
---
1. The polished gold material of the Metamateria SKINs has such a high specular value (it's particularly reflective) it appears more pronounced in highly lit areas with bright reflection maps. The fitting window (and 3D Preview) does not have as strong a light source as the hangar, which is relatively bright. We have plans, and work is already underway, to adjusting the hangars and their lighting situations in near-future releases.
---
2. As others have stated: each sun has a color which determines lighting in the system. That color can have a dramatic impact on the overall look of the scene: it can have a truly noticeable effect on Sisters of EVE ships and the Purity of the Throne SKINS. But it always applies to all hulls, celestial objects, and structures in space. The fitting window (and 3D Preview) works with a generally neutral light, which carries none of that system color with it, so will almost always look slightly different than the ship in space. This hue was considered the best for allowing players to make decisions about how to outfit their ships.
---
None of this has a bearing on specific customer satisfaction with a particular SKIN, I know. But I thought you might like a dev response here (in addition to the one on the Bug Report). Anyone having problems of any sort with their purchases should definitely contact customer service with a support ticket.
---
The 10b loot pinata has a 300,000m3 ore bay and you can compress ore. With a hulk you're having to pop an adderall to constantly micromanage your ore hold and worry about hauling the shit back every little bit.
---
It IS a combat ship. Even CCP gave it that title.
---
It would have been interesting if they applied the triglavian scaling damage to remote repairer scaling rep amount.
---
You do know where elite drone AI s come from right? If I am the dumbest idiot then why do I see what is coming once a bunch of excavators are getting killed? Considering most botting programs use the same process name you think CCP would be able to figure it out already.
---
Praise god
---
Muh rorqs :(
---
 Capital changes:
---
All look great to me, everyone has commented on them, so i'll leave it at that.
---
Subcap changes:
---
&gt;Medium Beam Lasers  
---
&gt;Optimal Range increased 10%
---
Cool, as someone who uses medium beams quite frequently, i appreciate the extra range. Beam zealot is going to be extra mean now.
---
&gt;Harbinger  
---
&gt;Powergrid increased to 1550 (was 1425)
---
Seems random at first, but looking at the changes to the Ferox and Medium Beams, this looks like a clear indicator CCP is trying to make the harb viable against Ferox fleet
---
&gt;Abaddon  
---
&gt;Bonus to Large Energy Turret damage increased to 7.5% per level (was 5%)
---
This one just seems very random. I'm guessing CCP's metrics showed the Abaddon was getting barely any use, and figured they throw it a bone. Its cap is still terribad and the same amarr BS 4 mid layout kind of cripples it from doing anything interesting. Still, might be fun to tinker with.
---
&gt;Cyclone  
---
&gt;CPU increased by 25
---
Meh. Guess it might make it easier to fit double links or do double XLASB fits
---
&gt;Caracal Navy issue  
---
&gt;Drone bay and bandwidth increased to 25m3
---
This kind of irks me, this is a half-assed change and 1, goes against what the original design goal of Naracal is (A pure missile boat that gets all its dps from an extra launcher over any other navy ship and an application bonus). Should of bumped its damage to 7.5% per level and moved a low to a mid and add some PG/CPU. 
---
&gt;Corax  
---
&gt;PG increased to 53 (was 48)
---
Good change, Corax was choked by shitty grid
---
&gt;Vexor Navy Issue  
---
&gt;Bonus to Drone Max Velocity removed  
---
&gt;Signature radius increased to 145 (was 135)
---
Seems alright i guess. The increased sig might help with the 100mn shield fits against rats getting hit slightly more (probably not, but we can dream). Removing the drone velocity bonus i am mixed on. The VNI is/was probably the strongest navy ship, but i don't think it was due to the drone velocity bonus. Might kill some unique fits, but not a terrible loss.
---
&gt;Gila  
---
&gt;Drone HP role bonus reduced to 250% (was 500%)
---
Seems fair
---
&gt;Ferox  
---
&gt;Max Velocity reduced to 145 was (150)  
---
&gt;Mass increased to 14250000 (was 13250000)  
---
&gt;Agility reduced to .66 (was .63)  
---
&gt;Signature Radius increased to 325 (was 295)
---
I know a lot of people are going to meme them about adjusting max velocity by 5m/s and effecting mass/agility. But, a major issue with Ferox is that other battlecruisers that actually had the range/tank to potentially engage were slower than the Ferox (plated harb). So even if the harb could maintain a similar range, it would get "kited" by the Ferox where it could never catch up.
---
These changes, combined with medium beam optimal bonuses means that a harb can now project out to ferox range using aurora, maintain a nearly identical tank and be faster/same speed. Which means the  Ferox can't just kite away. Also, with the Ferox sig now being that of a battleship (pretty much), it also means battleship guns will very easily apply to them. Which, the proper counter to BC's is battleships.
---
colossal grade slave pls
---
They've been saying they want to look at passive tanking and cap recharge stacking as part of tiericide.
---
96% and it cost heavy water to activate
---
they  buff harbinger.... fking cocksuckers forgot about harbinger navy,brutix navy
---
CCP doesn't give titles, only time of death certificates
---
What backwards mouthbreather rats in a Gila in WHs?
---
Spawn rate for Nullsec combat/ore sites are now on the same schedule as wormholes.
---
But I've got a question, does nerfing the rorqual will make all non-goons play the game again or make those who still play this game leave their VNI fitted with 4x warp core stab and use something bigger ?
---
Didn't they feed like 3 rorqs last night lol
---
no wormhole buffs. they need more connections to lowsec and highsec too
---
Yes let's all ping falcon for this inane shit
---
this is a turning point in eve
---
angel dread/titan when?
---
If you were a krab at the bottom of the ocean I'd hope a krab cage would sink on top of you and suffocate you in the fish-shit encrusted ocean floor tbh
---
The haw titan DPS numbers remind me of when they nerfed their scan res into the ground on the basis that every titan in the game would run multiple cormack sebos. Even when there were only a few hundred titans in existance instead of the thousands there are today it was a ludicrous balance justification.
---
A 50% haw tracking nerf would make more sense to me, I don't see too much issue with haw titans except titans (especially the avatar) being able to blap sabres at 100km. Not too much of an issue on dreads since they dont have full implant sets, racks of faction TCs, and have to chug exile/blue pill instead of frentix but when you combine all of that on an avatar the scorch range is quite ludicrous.
---
and these rorqual "nerfs" are just a bandaid on a severed limb
---
rorquals shouldn't be mining ships period. the whole problem with rorquals to begin with is that you can afk print money for hours with little risk with a super umbrella which these changes to nothing to address, they only nerf small groups
---
ok but if everyone else is also making less isk then plex prices will go down and you won't need to spend as much :)
---
what are those
---
Stop making me want to come back to this game
---
Cant wait to se my moldy and rusty ragnarok. But it said in June there will be something interesting.. Maybe shield slaves? :D
---
Try undocking it. No really, the station hangar is lit up brightly and the view ship windows are standard space sun lighting. It will almost certainly look better under darker colors outside.
---
No it's stickied, which ironically means less people will notice it.
---
youd think theyd keep the lp for the implants and or new things you should invest in rooks though
---
10 hours ish to pay back the rorq skill with one rorq on the new changes... so yeah.
---
ill go with stratios for bigger dronebay
---
I'm not sure about how triglavian logi work but I'm assuming the rep ramps up over time just like the damage guns do?
---
If that is the case how will rep diminishing return work for the Triglavian logi shipline work?

---
nope it wont,do u rat in wormholes with rorquals?
---
Read my reply to the other post.
---
Also could be taken in the context of the twitter post by falcon..
---
buying every medium beam laser in jita, brb
---
50% nerf is still a 50K EHP active tank.  Nerf need to be bigger. MUCH bigger.
---
lol, you can still make a fuckload with Rorqs with them being more survivable. The fact that CCP left the PANIC module in the game instead of deleting it wholesale is a pity, but at least they nerfed it.
---
And considering how the CPI on the MER has been cratering despite all the previous nerfs Rorqs faced, I think this is a pretty fair trade off.
---
can we get a Preview window with lighting controls please?
---
Diminishing returns on reps is a MASSIVE change, and one I'd given up hope for because it needed a lot of new code in the background.
---
99,99%  total hp reduction. better to have rorqual  with frig ehp than frig with rorqual ehp
---
Other nerfs incoming.
---
Is this the "post a change you'd like to see" thread from earlier today or is this actually in the dev blog
---
You're making quite a large fitting sacrifice to fit multiple SEBOs to a carrier, you're either losing a lot of application or all your tank.
---
&gt; I don't know large capital meta that much, but I still feel like you still have to focus FAXes first in case of a dread bomb.
---
Looking at the numbers this look to be the case. I don't think this is an effective nerf to FAX at all personally.
---
I did. That's how it starts but you end up capping a base because there's either no fights or you're waiting for one.
---
i  crash trains
---
If only these changes were implemented over one year ago...
---
in act of james 315 your keepstar from maila system wil be bumped for being afk for too long
---
don't you fuckin dare, combat probing nidhoggurs are my guilty pleasure
---
You forgot the loss of the drones speed bonus on the VNI. Or it's just minor in comparison.
---
also whos the guy from  CODE  alliance logo?
---
Remove cap booster 3200s. Then subcaps can reliably neut dreads and FAXs again.
---
I'd pay to see someone pull it off with an Iteron Mark V
---
Because the Brutix Navy is already great?
---
well, currently it is a ''everything'' ship, which is complete bs
---
What was it previously?
---
also bastion is gonna die in 5 months
---
i want  SOE capitals so i can  use  capital gravity capacitor upgrades i manufactured,got the bpc's from some relic sites
---
Fuck the dd volly meta
---
Overall, I think these changes are a good start. Still more work to be done, but we are making progress. I’d still like to see a FAX ehp reduction, changes to Sirens, reduction in Titan HAW and LR gun tracking, among others. But this is the most progress we’ve made in years.
---
just slam few more cargo extenders to your pontifex, ez
---
They said something about rebalancing capital shield modules when shield slaves hit. Back when cap tank mods were introduced.
---
waaaaa my 200m/hr fully afk ship cant tank 100+ subcaps anymore waaaaa
---
I'm not sure how much a wetu holds right off hand.  I'm guessing probably 3 excavators will still fit in one?  If that's the case, will 3 excavators be equivalent to one hulk?  If so, I may just change my mining to one rorqual with 3 drones and the rest of my guys in exhumers.
---
The hole thing was a waste of development time... changes will have little to no impact and the 'help the newbies thing' I don't see how they help them when they increase most of the newbie skill prices by 50-100% lol add the 30% if they buy from chr screen
---
what is meant by module tiericide?
---
Wait vni's are still afk able? I thought you now had to manually assign drones to each target, like with turrets and missiles? Or was this fake news??
---
Nope, that’s right.
---
Abbadon gets 5%-7.5% buff on Large Energy Turret, I would say this is a big impact as well
---
Just to break it down...
---
1. Meaningless Ferox change, Optimal Range remains which means you can sit at coward range and most fleets are unengageable.
---
2. Rorq mining nerf is a joke, who cares about 1 minute on PANIC, as we saw last time CCP tried to nerf yield, people just injected more alts.  
---
3. HAWs were the least oppressive Titan gun, LR guns untouched.  
---
4. NSA nerf meaningless for ratting, just fit a capital armor repairer and two Sebos and you're the same.  
---
5. Structures untouched.  
---
6. RLMLs, Medium Autocannons untouched after CCP promised changes to them two years ago.  
---
7. VNI drone bandwidth remains the same, meaningless speed nerf which you can just use an armor fit and a drone nav comp for.  
---
8. Chain booshing untouched. 
---
9. Insurance changes meaningless, because the economy is still fucked either way, and the problematic ISK faucets aren't capital insurance.  
---
I mean, some of these minor changes are a step in the right direction, but is this the "mother of all balance updates" Falcon promised? Hell no.
---
overwatched  but wait,.. if you piss into stargate  the urine will our on other side. 
---
i remember one episode of stargate  where  was  a world with only one-way stargate and throught stargate was food coming only,they could not dial due to lack of DHD but by manually moving the stargate ring they did dial, some asshole step on front during activation and only his shoes left on ground. 
---
what about non bullet weapons,would they go throught like lasers? what about  playing a pingpong throught stargate hmmmm
---
**MESON EXOTIC PLASMA ANI!**
---
I mean i forgot a few subcaps but imo the only Significant one is the Gila. Obviously its a pretty personal opinion
---
For one to a few pilots, it's easily manageable though. For the guy flying 404 rorquals, he doesn't care anyway, does he ?
---
Also we have guys running 40 hulk at the same time these days. Not saying they don't cheat.
---
I think they added the diminishing returns solely for blob fests. 
---
We will probably see more work on FAX. They can tweak the DR's however they want to compensate nerfes to smallscale FAX while maintaining the status quo für huge battles.
---
I like it.
---
You can fit your astero to run away. Or fit it to fight. You can't pick fight and flight. 
---
If you want to fight, get rid of those lows and throw on some tank. Damage control, repper, maybe adaptive invuln.
---
Look through zkill and the eve uni wiki to see if you can find a fit. Someone might link a proper one here instead of my ramblings.
---
Right now you're melty. Anyone who drops on an astero does it with the assumption that the astero is combat fit. If you engage, you'll die. Sub 2 second align is instawarp though, so you'll be able to gtfo pretty easily
---
theyve been back for a while in nano..  
---
Now theyre just better
---
Sorry, you will have to speak louder, I can't hear you from inside those NPC stations.
---
Whelp... hope you werent training haw titan, carrier, super, or roqual...
---
 :D
---
I agree but I don't think it should go too far
---
You can't start SD with a cyno up iirc but you can cyno up with SD active 
---
Or you could last time i played, anyways
---
60s
---
My god... Kill it with fire!
---
How have we missed your CCP Flair? 0.o  Can you shoot me a quick DM on Discord or get Falcon or someone flaired to send a Modmail.
---
Zelden#1134 on Discord
---
JUST ADAPT
---
Won't really matter with intel channel and ships being 1/20 of the rorqual price.
---
First actual minor tweak in this thread, also fuck you
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with a large assault frig gang being able to orbit and kill a titan since they are the toppest of the top in terms of anti-cap warfare. They don't need to be great at everything.
---
brb reinstalling portrait pack
---
this is the correct answer
---
Rorq isk is going to be 100mil/hr. With an 8B ship investment and no way to even save 2 of the 830mil drones. Hell even the skillbook is another 500mil now. It just isn't worth it unless you can run 10 of them at once, with a good umbrella.
---
Low SP players. For C2 wormholes, its a good choice. Its doable for C3s as well.
---
THANK YOU CCP ... BIG STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION!
---
With the dimishing returns, why would anyone shoot logi anymore?
---
Sure you wipe out 20 fax out of a 50 man fax wing, you kill like 15% of reps, thats hardly anything.
---
I'm with the changes just some seems sbit harsh. Insurance is harsh and harms the little guy.
---
Gila drone nerf rather than tackling pve sucking balls and being afk sigtanked.
---
Ferox nerf could've been more, same with rorq, other than that i like the changes.
---
It lets them easily compete with rails for range
---
Or just bring a prowler with you.
---
&gt;I don't see any good way to apply this to rorquals, though.
---
There are quite a few.
---
You can arbitrarily nerf its mining ability when several are on the same grid, though this is game-y and inelegant.
---
The best option is simply to have an actual scarcity of (good) ore to mine in existence, which has the added benefits of both spreading players out and making holding a larger amount of space more valuable.  This in turn drives conflict, which means more exploding ships, which makes the ore even more valuable, which... you get the picture.
---
In this scenario, larger groups are forced to spread out and their isk-making activities are riskier and their space more difficult to hold.  Smaller groups may have more competition for their space as a result, but at least they'll be falling behind larger groups in something more akin to a linear fashion rather than the current exponential one.  They'd also have a lot more agency in their livelihood via good play, as with a spread out playerbase you have the potential for more small-scale fights and effective harassment.
---
*On a side note, demand for space (alongside real scarcity in that space) would also go a decent way toward getting rid of the ability to set up giant rental botting empires.*
---
Lul. You might have reasons to come back man. It's not perfect, but it's absolutely a step in the right direction:)
---
I'm pretty sure you can be out of cap and still have passive shield regen going on.
---
Ive always paid for sub with RL money. It is hard to motivate myself to make money in game when nothing (esp after this patch) is worth the effort. Buy plex, sell them. In terms of time/money it is by far the best use of your life unless you have a fun isk making activity.
---
I can mention it to the decision-maker(s).
---
 *Change*: Supers and Titans are able to jump through wormholes, instantly collapsing the hole and blowing them up, splitting the wreck between both connected systems.
---
Oklol
---
Put 2 faction cap rechargers on and congratulations you're cap stable at 71%+ with NSA on.
---
The balance changes look like something youd expect from any other developer on like a bi monthly balance pass, They are most welcome however. No changes to t3c's r to the trig ship line up, no nerf to the direct rep and local tank of faxes which are very much needed. 
---
The AT died for this
---
The issue is how many dreads you need to risk to reliably break it
---
It's gone down to like only 3-4 now which is on par with the price of the rorq itself, including the 1-2 excavs it'll lose when it dies now
---
Implant set 'Lucky' Set bonus +10% chance of finding 'Rare' and 'Epic' items in lootboxes.
---
# Overall solid changes. MOAB changes? Meh, but definitely a step in the right direction. A few key points I would like to get feedback on and I hope you all disregard my ~evil gewniez~ affiliation and really think about what I say:
---
**Rorqual nerfs:** Why is everyone so infatuated with seeing the rorqual mining yield get nerfed? You are not considering the long term effects of this. Sure, nuke the tank down to a carrier level - people will still shitfit them and use them. Once you start nuking the yield people stop seeing incentives to use them, or to start poor fitting them with just mining drones. Pimped rorquals w/ excavators is a top 5 content generatating aspect in eve currently. People scurry from across the galaxy to hunt rorquals - making them easier to killed is a much better alternative vs. making them much less appealing to use.
---
**HAW nerfs:** This is overall pretty good. I like how CCP is attempting to create a gradual laddering up of escalation scenarios from small subcap &gt; large subcap &gt; capital (dread) &gt; supers &amp; titans. Just keep in mind it's quite silly that an assault frigate gang can afk orbit a titan for hours on end, assuming no reinforcements, without any repercussions. The triglavian damage scaling works will - how about implementing a scaling tracking % or damage % with HAWs so that if you are still shooting a titan in a rifter after an hour he's gonna blap you.
---
**FAX changes:** Meh. Mehhh. Consider a scaling repair amount over time vs. diminishing returns. 
---
**VNI &amp; Gila nerf:** Meh. Just reduce drone control range, much simpler solution. They still have the firepower they just can't be kitey at 100km.
---
**NSA:** LOL - I like this. With that said if we are going to lock ourselves in place at least introduce a little risk v. reward like tracking speed increase or something.
---
**Pilgrim buff:** Didn't see it, did I miss it somewhere?
---
Woah this must really hit you hard for it to produce so much salt
---
Just less able to bring more people, which sometimes equates to the same thing, but not always.
---
Honestly love all of the changes except the carrier application one.  For people who like to do small gang carrier stuff, it's a little annoying that CCP's line is to just bring more tackle.  The NSA nerf though is really good, as it makes those fights much more committal.
---
&gt; Sub 2 second align is instawarp though, so you'll be able to gtfo pretty easily  
---
Oh yeah I know, I've been using this fit for a little while now. I know there's no such thing as safe in Eve, but I'm as safe as can be since I pay attention when I'm out there.  
---
I realise I can't do both to perfection at the same time, but with d-scan watching I imagine I can still escape quite easily if I see probes in my area.  
---
Thanks for the info.
---
They truly just do not give a fuck about the small guys.
---
What about a full fleet of dreads? Or 2?
---
That's what this nerf is about. At some point you can't match the piling dps of ever more dreads (Or super/titan gun dps) with more FAX.
---
&gt;Zelden#1134
---
Pretty sure I had flair at some point. u/Jibrish probably revoked it on account of me being an absolute jerk.   
---
Which is fair.
---
the good news before all the PA changes
---
HAW titan is the one thing I don't understand why it even exist. I don't understand why would not even touch the tracking when it's the one obvious issue with it, it should still barely track BS ...
---
No drones at all?
---
Most people on reddit dont actually understand the dynamics of pvp and how any of this works. 
---
The only meaningful change is the rorqual shield boost nerf. 
---
But hey i'm real glad they added 15 bandwith to the cni, thats really gonna do it. Where are the people saying database changes are totally impossible and eve is totally impossible to balance because its so complex. I wonder what sort of complex algorithm they ran to add some PG to a ship that had an obvious PG deficit ever since the BC rebalance like 5 years ago (actual years yes).
---
I believe Rorquals will still need more nerfing to the Panic module.
---
So just make them only work for sub caps?
---
The payouts don’t change based on where you open them, but the abyssal trace (from mid and high tier sites) can be scanned down, and you’re easier to gank outside of high-sec.
---
I meant it literally. They literally gave it the title combat ship. Pillar #2 and later on, word for word, "It is also gaining massive bonuses to drones that turn it into a **combat powerhouse** and a mining operation all on its own when used alongside Excavator Drones."
---
Combined with that they said, also literally word for word, "If enemies realize they can’t break through the remote reps and decide to attack the sieged Rorqual directly they’ll be in for another surprise as the Industrial Core provides the Rorqual with one of the **strongest local tanks in the game**"
---
Not much point in an insta-align-and-run fit, is there
---
As per kal's comment, this seems like it's targeted explicitly at X47/B-R scale mega titan brawls; it's not gonna impact whaling fleets/smallgang fights or even most standard dread bombs. 
---
This is still a **huge deal** though, since null alliances spend most of their time prepping (mining, building, conducting diplomacy) for the next big titan brawl. Changing the nature of that fight will have cascade effects all down the meta.
---
I didn't want a carrier application nerf for what it is worth.  Small carrier groups that don't have access to CCP's solution of "more tackle" didn't really need that sort of challenge in their gameplay.  The NSA nerf is great, and is exactly the sort of hurdle and gameplay modification I wanted for better balanced and more engaging carriers.
---
Not going to lie making them easier to kill would be better vs nuking money making.
---
if you're halfway competent with dscan you can find a carrier in about 10 seconds, and warp time on a sabre for 15 au is about 20 seconds or so, from align to warp time to landing and bubbling. Good sabre pilots can easily tackle a super in this timeframe.
---
Now that's assuming that the mea cycle just startwd. If you come in at the end, rip lol
---
HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA LOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOOOLOOOOOOL
---
Oh no you have to actually play this game to play it? Fuck
---
LS, citadels, FW, chat system ... :D
---
yeah i wont pretend to be an economic expert, it just irks me when people complain that their isk making method has been nerfed when it's gonna affect like 90% of the people playing this game and it's for the good of game health
---
It's going to be per tick most likely.
---
Wh income stayed the same ;) 250 mil an hour rattle ratting in a c3, 400 mil am hour tinker ratting a c5, 2 bil an hour easy dread ratting a c5
---
Wormholer reaction: https://imgflip.com/i/2vybwz
---
Yea you guys got em with those half dozen kills of yours over the last few days.
---
Lol yeah, a praxis is cheaper and clears faster. No point to gilas in wh space for.pve don't think, unless your spethial and running c1 or c2 sites
---
Finally a real nerf to what is killing the game - abundance of minerals. Thank you CCP that you realized that 2 years later.
---
Says someone who has never beed saved by ECM hornets. Though I think those have changed in the last year so Im not sure if they are still useful.
---
Even combat drones can help, Not everyone remembers that they can warp off when they really should be warping off.
---
Well you got your wish \\o/
---
TL:DR - Nerf everything
---
Orca + Hulk and Rattlesnakes it is then. Full circle back to what I did in 2014.
---
Sure there is - I scram you in my covops I just happen to be doing relic sites in and I have no guns but I do have one drone. You're a dead astero when you very easily could have killed me with 5 shit t1 drones.
---
What's that? The spodbrain is affecting your mouth now, I can't make out what you're saying. 50% nerf is not enough? I agree, let's make it 100%
---
Oh I'm aware of them and all but if my align time is 1.75s and my method is to fuck off as soon as I see probes near me, I should be okay.  
---
That said, drones will of course come into play once someone suggests a more combat oriented fit. I'm not going to be hunting others as such, it's more about if the opportunity is there while I'm exploring I'm kitted out to kill them.
---
Yeah, the phantasm hype is real.
---
Hnnnnng these changes
---
Yep, robbed.  While the 20 billion worth of skill books I still own went up in value a bit, the replacement cost of the 10 billion worth that sold in the last 3 hours went up higher.
---
Please post comments of sympathy below...
---
Lmao quit your fucking hysterics. Mining gneiss will be worth 160m an hour post patch, unless youre mining veldspar or other similar ores you're still making 100+ easy. Fir moons you'll still be getting 300-400m/hr for R16, 500-800/hr for R32, and so on.
---
Wetus still have 4k m3 capacity allowing you to save 3 of your drones. The tank has been nerfed so now instead of needing 130 nerds to kill you it will _ONLY_ take 60 or 70. Meanwhile you get a super scalable income stream on par with carrier ratting.
---
Heaven foebid CCP try to give it back its original role as a boosting platform and try to control the flood of ore and minerals on the market, or the skyrocketing plex, injector, and super proliferation.
---
\&gt;  abused by your blobs fc  for bringing a widow. 
---
This is some real spodbrain F1 monkey horseshit right there, not even sure how to process the level of downs syndrome in this post
---
Is it possible to scram me when my align time is 1.75s and I've gone as soon as I see you on grid (I am very attentive fyi ;p)
---
Fake news. They got 10m sig increase and lost drone speed (25%). Still gonna be the most seen ship in 0.0 :(
---
Fucking hit that rorqual with the nerf bat until there are no more teeth please
---
Scenario 2 - I'm in a cloaky bomber with a long point and no targeting delay so I get you disrupted at 20km but my torps apply like shit to a small target. But crap maybe I can hold you long enough for my Stratios buddy. You drop 5 T1 drones as you burn away and force me off. Your Astero lives to explore another day.  
---
5 T1 drones costs like 100,000 isk. Don't fly the ship without drones.
---
So....Another Nerf to Logi.
---
Goodbye Tech 1 Logi, Making Tech II Logi mandatory incoming.
---
CCP at it again, and here I was wondering how can they make this game less new player friendly.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
This is brilliant. All round solid balance pass. 
---
Keep it up. 
---
Keep the momentum. 
---
Keep the transparent roadmaps at the bottom of devblogs.
---
We love communication like this.
---
Entiendo.
---
shouldn't matter. it's based on amount of hp being repped, not number of reppers. t1 low skill logi will still be veru valuable
---
Good one ;)
---
These changes are in right direction, but if these are just as they are, then the smaller guys gets rekt a lot more than the big guy.  
---
What needs to happen along with the existing changes is:  
---
Diminishing returns per region the more it's mined/ratted. This is something that will have the most balancing effect and force null empires to expand out more rather than just pocket it all up.   
---
These changes alone arent really going to balance out the game, big null empires will remain big and small guys will get fucked a lot more.
---
thats a vedmak
---
Well right off the top, that fit you posted has an empty mid slot. Why? You should never have empty slots 
---
Stick a faction scram on that bad boy and bring a full flight of warriors/hobgoblins
---
You won't be able to kill other Asteros but that's all you need for buzzards and imicuses. If you want a real astero PVP fit on a relic-running astero you need to bring a mobile depot so you can swap out your fit for 1v1s.
---
There are two types of people  you will run into.  The ones with insta warp fits like yours that aren't going to stick around and fight and the ones that are prepared to fight.  You won't get many kills and probably will lose a few ships before you figure out what to do. But basically, you'll need to go full pvp.  So all your lows should be geared towards damage and tank.  you'll need a scram on your mids and possibly more tank.
---
Yeah at a certain point it becomes not viable to fly and then people lose the one of the top targets in ~elite roaming pvp~
---
brutix navy has more lows than Harb navy how the fuck does that make sense
---
It literally takes 1 second of distraction to get pointed by a ship with no targeting delay on breaking cloak.  
---
How is keeping 5 T1 light drones in your fit not worth it even if it only saves you 1 out of 10 times.  
---
Your stupidity or cheapness is literally blowing my mind. Can't figure out which one it is.
---
Sounds reasonable.  
---
I do actually have drones atm, I just didn't include them in that fit because, well I guess I didn't think it was relevant since I'd be changing the whole fit more or less.
---
Also it means sacrificing mids, which is usually tank for a ratting carrier, either way it's a good thing
---
Think the game should encourage the use of force multipliers when outnumbered. I always thought Capitals should be buffed to increase attackers need to use them in defenders fielded them.
---
I'm all for medium beams to be competitive. I guess it just seems like 10% doesn't *sound* like much.

So bring two?

---
Only just upgraded to Zeugma today and I don't know what to fill the spare slot with  
---
Thanks for the info!
---
So you just assume it's not mining just because of its hull type? That's insensitive.

You can't store stuff in other people's mobile depots though, can you?
---
Pyfa. Simulated the 50% nerf by turning off the torp launchers. As you can see the battleship fit titan has ~230 more DPS than the properly fit titan. 
---
Maybe this has more to do with how much missiles suck than the proposed nerf... but it is freaking stupid imho.

Woah, I'll have you know that I *sent you a mod invite*.

Also we have no idea why your flair isn't working. I'm guessing someone pushed a commit they shouldn't have. I'll check git when I get home to figure out wtf happened.

This made me chuckle!
---
Given that a carrier currently makes in one tick what a single VNI makes in an hour, that'll be a no. It just won't be sustainable 23/7.
---
inb4 "long awaited" implant that reduces the plex cost of skins in the store by 2%...
---
&gt; Seems alright i guess. The increased sig might help with the 100mn shield fits against rats getting hit slightly more (probably not, but we can dream). Removing the drone velocity bonus i am mixed on. The VNI is/was probably the strongest navy ship, but i don't think it was due to the drone velocity bonus. Might kill some unique fits, but not a terrible loss.
---
The VNI as a PvE platform is enormously robust.  Kinda like its bigger brother, the Dominix.  However, with the drone speed nerfs,  making up the dif would have to be done using drone navs (mids) or rigs.  I think this change was made so that a VNI couldn't AFK dunk a non-bling tackle frigate and get away too easily.

This guy is probably a scientist or something

I mean no, not really. Because if you can tether, it's a citadel. And citadel repairs inside the station are completely free.

You forgot about that, he was talking strictly about stations.

Help I don't know anything about programming
---
&gt;I've had a handful occasions where there's been a Buzzard or an Imicus warp in on me, or vice versa, and I've had 0 dps and I've rued the missed opportunity
---
Because you are contradicting yourself when responding to advice that others spent time to give you, for questions that you asked.
---
I guess the effect is compounded by the (up to) 50% optimal bonus on the hull, so ends up being a little more than 10%.
---
When did I contradict myself?
---
They already are. Changed at downtime this morning.
---
I mean, saying for ages but nerf rorqs per system, force spread, probably nerf ore anoms. Also ill be interested, not seen numbers of anything close to 160 for a long while. Spod being the main option, which seemed to be 120-130mil/hr.
---
That VNI nerf does nothing but nuke the 100mn PVP VNI, which was barely usable and costed a ton to fit. The best way to go about it would have been to make the bonus only apply to heavies, like the Ishtar does.
---
&gt; if you're halfway competent with dscan....
---
This only applies is you are in a very small system.
---
If CCP hadn't of introduced injectors it wouldn't even BE an issue since the scaling wouldn't have happened like it did. Dunno, as someone on the small end of things this stuff hurts far more than those who already have made a fortune from when rorqs WERE crazy good. As said, there isn't much reason to play for ISK at this point.
---
&gt;Not much point \[for drones\] in an insta-align-and-run fit, is there
---
Between T1 and T2 modules, there are the so called "meta modules", which used to range from meta level 1 to meta level 4. Now for most cases, meta level 4 was simply the best - in some cases even better than the T1 equivalent - while the other meta levels were barely if ever used.
---
In order to change that and introduce meaningful decisions, CCP started the tiericide in 2014, where they were going to remodel all meta level modules, such that there isn't a gradual increase in "goodness", but those meta modules being specialized. A good examples are the propulsion-modules, where you have one that uses less capacitor, another that is slightly faster, one that uses less fitting-space and also one that has reduced drawbacks (e.g. less mwd-bloom).
---
While some were sceptical, this turned out to be a good thing, that offered more meaningful choices and also the attribute names now match the type of specialization (e.g. enduring for those that use less capacitor).
---
Sadly - for some unknown reason - ccp stopped in the middle of remodeling all modules, so some modules havent been tiericided yet. Finally they have recognized that and will hopefully go ahead with their efforts.
---

Interesting that your Pyfa gives you 1263 dps when my Pyfa gives 1578 with the Rapid launchers...
---
Not accusing you of messing with your character skills in your image but, did you?
---
```while(true) press_key("f");```
---
tbh you don't need a data analyzer. It's a waste of time, datas are garbage - the payouts from w-space/null sec relics is way higher :)
---
Put a cargo scanner there if you're not gonna pvp btw, scan the relic cans and only hack the ones that are worth your time.
---
you should write a book.
---
Don’t bring logic into this thread
---
Except my small 10 man group could form tackle support alongside our tiny carrier fleet... It's the large groups that didn't form support since it was safer for them to just throw another carrier at the problem.
---
I want to believe this is real
---
no reason to come back.
---
How is that a contradiction? I was genuinely asking. From forum posts I'd read up til now it seemed if you're sub 2s warp, and your game plan is to just run away at first sign of life, there's not much point in having drones.  
---
Jeez dude, lighten up
---
I meant it literally too tho
---
And I will still make tons of isk because they can't kill us fast enough.
---
You cannot boosh with one account unless I am missing something. You would need to get your 6th account...
---
I dont do it so I guess I wouldn't know. Or maybe you are doing it with friends.
---
You could be right, I'm only basing my postulation off my passive onyx fit that is out of cap after 6 minutes...3k/sec regen though. I'll have to educate myself better
---
Hmm, I just checked, everything is set to all 5 for both setups.  
---
I have no modules or implants either.  Did you check your implants?
---
Could actually reliably tackle people by rage rolling too, which before practically never happened.
---
This is a mixed feelings update for me.
---
I know it's great for the game, so I'm super stoked about that. Shame is that it's nerfing my personal playstyle.
---
I've handled a few data ghost sites that have given me a good amount. Besides, the Zeugma does both so that isn't an issue.

It's literally in the title of your post.

You have "Factor in reload timer" checked

&gt;9 subcap changes
---
Well, im dissapointed
---
Alright dude, have it your way. I was engaging in conversation and asking follow up questions because I'm new and I like getting all the information. If you're gonna be cunty about that, whatever, you do you.  
---
When someone suggested drones, I asked if that's necessary, hoping that, indeed as you did, someone would provide a scenario where they can be useful. I then responded to you saying "that seems reasonable".  
---
So I really don't know what your random problem is.
---
Holy shit, this is a big change. 
---
With how cheap minerals have become, I'm all for more destruction.
---
At least there is some time before these changes will be implemented (probably almost exactly as they are listed here, as usual). It will give me enough time to figure out what I want to do about it.
---
Another case of CCP pushing an update that  **||seems good||** because all of their updates are shit, but is ultimately, and unfortunately, low testosterone.
---
We will add this functionality in a future update indeed.
---
What are you on about? Exactly. What should I change. My current fit, the one I posted, is to run away.  
---
What does the title of the post have to do with anything? Jesus...  
---
You're clearly trolling me now so I'll just leave you to it.
---
Thats fair.
---
Imagine all the carrier bots we can catch now. *hunting intensifies*
---
You're not going to last very long here.
---
Yes, this is true. I'd expect a high grade shield rattle to easily tank 5k+ dps passively. Drakes/Rokhs/Scorpions/Ragnarok/Carriers/Nereus could all do ridiculous things with the set as well
---
trig mining ship.
---
beam where the longer its aimed at asteroid the faster it aims.

the catch? you need to manually align the beam, like a bomb.

Good joke but the wealth inequality in this game is insane. There are many players with trillion isk wallets.
---
Me reading this was basically the increasing excitement meme resuming tiericide, Rorq nerfs, cap nerfs, Abbadon buffs, Diminishing logi, gila/VNI nerfs, this blog has everything. Literally the only thing its missing is medium projectiles and a lowsec gate to stain.
---
You can passive gila in all c3's, maybe even c4 if it's pulsar
---
obviously. its a 50% nerf, I simulated that by turning half of them off. Idiot.
---
My thoughts on the patch.
---
**Remote rep diminishing returns**: I think they designed this pretty well. Personally I'd like a 5-10 second "burst" window where there were no diminishing returns and then the system as-is. This would give really on the ball logi wings that are working in unison a chance to save ships immediately but they could still be powered through afterwards. Still, more attrition is a good thing. Titan fittings may change to feature resists more than effective HP because resists make reps stronger, however tanking doomsdays is still your number one concern so you'll have to be very conservative with changes. 
---
Also, I haven't seen anyone mention it yet but there's a HUGE way to exploit this offensively if you think about it, it took me about 3 minutes to break this system in a way that makes these changes MUCH more powerful.
---
**Haw changes**: I don't think this is as big of a nerf as people think it is. Maybe for like 3 or 4 titans it is but it still means there is a "no fly zone" around big titan balls for subs because haws still track just as well. I personally would have preferred a haw tracking penalty for titans, I realize this would basically make the weapons platform unviable for them but I think that's probably how they should have been in the first place.  One thing is does do is kill titan ratting entirely, RIP.
---
**Fighter Application**: Good changes overall. Probably not aggressive enough but I realize it's a fine line with fighters so I'm glad CCP is taking an incremental approach. I haven't looked at the numbers but hopefully this stops fighters from blapping frigs/destroyers entirely and really hurts their application to cruisers. Unfortunately I don't think this will stop them from killing MWD cruisers especially with groups that are smart enough to bring a lot of dromis (luckily groups like horde don't really do this, but NCdot does). One way to make them apply "worse" to cruisers while not gutting them entirely against subs would be to increase the cooldown on fighter MWD, decreasing their effective mobility. You could still pulse them and "latch" onto a target but it would be longer times in-between. That way FCs could decide if they want to pull range and leave their caught ships totally out to dry (let's be honest if fighters are already on them they probably are dead anyway) or they could stay close and try to rep through the damage. But this way if they make the choice to pull range they lower their loss rate. 
---
**NSA change**: A good change, make people make some choices. Jay already addressed this in the comments but I imagine people will be stocking up on shadow serp sensor boosters (buy 'em now before the price spikes!). It will result in more ratting supers dying which is a good thing^TM but overall this is actually more a nerf to super ratting ticks than it is to danger. Most people will go sebos which, combined with the fighter application nerfs, will lower their ticks. By dropping the NSA they will be aligned and at jump cap so, perversely, probably even harder to catch but you've lowered carrier/super ratting ticks an appreciable amount which is a good design goal on its own and an elegant way to do it. 
---
**Insurance changes**: The super one might be a head scratcher to some but I was working on a t2 suicide wyvern fleet. With how cheap they've become and the insurance amount you get for them this was becoming a viable idea, and it's probably not something people expected to see. This pushes that idea back further, overall I like these changes. Cap losses should hurt, right now they really don't. 
---
**Medium Beam Laser + Harbinger buffs**: I already thought the hearty harby was a sneaky viable ship but when you combine this with the ferox nerf I'm starting to smell a new meta boys. Some major bloc will be running a harbinger fleet  soon (probably not us because we move at a glacial pace, but someone).
---
**Abaddon**: Good change, will this make arty abaddons a thing of the past? Probably not, but at least the abbadon as an immobile monitor style gunboat is more effective. Drop a bunch of these guys with high DPS pulse lasers on top of a capital fleet and watch what happens (ok, what happens is they get absolutely melted by supers and tracking titans, but it's a fun thought).
---
**Cyclone**: Needed more fitting, good change
---
**Caracal Navy**: A garbage hull in want of a role, this ain't it chief. 
---
**Corax**: THIS SHIP NEEDS FITTING ROOM MORE THAN ANY OTHER, great change! Probably doesn't make it viable but at least it elevates this cool little hull from garbo tier to usable. People will still use talwars, but rocket coraxs could be a thing.
---
**VNI**: Combat VNI fleets died for your ratting sins.
---
**Gila**: I've said before that I think the 100mn gila fleet is the best skirmishing fleet in the game except for one giant weakness, the smartbomb. Well, this just made that twice as apparent. The combat gila fleet died for your ratting and abyssal sins. 
---
**Ferox**: A fleet in desperate need of nerfs and these ones just say "Bomb me". Seriously, vaporizing ferox fleets will be so easy now. I like what they did here, they didn't really cut the offensive power of the hull at all, they just made it easier to punish. A good ferox FC will be fine, mostly. But mistakes will be easy to punish.
---
**Rorq changes**: Making them easier to kill is a good thing. I really enjoy killing these suckers but their local tank was just obscene. 
---
**Excavator and yield changes**: I feel like I just got hit over the head by Malcanis' law. On a macro scale yield needed to be hit. On a micro scale I am not a big producer like some people, I already feel like I don't get that much from my rorq, now I will get less. It's a feelsbad on a personal level but I understand it on a macro scale. As an economist I approve of these changes, as a capitalist I do not. 
---
Overall happy with these changes, all of them are good in my mind.
---
eh they'll adjust it for missiles.  otherwise a 2x dmg bonus for dreads would make Phoenix overkill in the extreme.
---
missiles got a wierd siege set up vs normal guns.  and they'll no doubt take this into account to avoid 6k dps phoenix HAWs
---
Because Harbinger has more letters

they should make pods only affect subs

You have reload on i bet

Well yeah, that's the point. Those who hull tank take the fucking like a man, no need for weak ass little reps like those pussy armor/shield babies. the proper way to armor tank is to make sure the other guy is dead before you need to repair.

Why does CCP make a mistake every time they make a good decision?
---
These changes will only make super cap response times even more important. And if your a small or medium size alliance your not gonna feel any measure of safety rorq mining or super ratting, which joining the big group would be more attractive to do so.
---
The ones who benefit the most from hunting will be GOKU/STUKA bomber FC's. Lower rep power from Fax's combined with Nerf'd fighter application to bomber sig radius and Panic mod base time....oh boy
---
Imagine, just imagine for a moment, if we could, somehow, harness that energy
---
Ore titan
---
In the off chance this is being read by a CCP employee: Good job!
---
The capital balance changes that you are proposing, is exactly what was needed. I've wanted diminishing returns for Fax's since forever. 
---
Have you considered doing the same for DD's? - Diminished damage depending on the amount of DD's hitting a ship, over a period of time. Effectively making it impossible to alpha ships of the field, AND reducing the incentive to just stack titans to a critical number. 
---
In regards to the rorq changes.... oh boy.... This is a very CCP typical move. You're effectively trying to cure a symptom by adjusting a few numbers, without looking at the real problem behind the scenes. 
---
eg: 
---
1. Scaleability of using rorqs in regards to numbers.... 20% less yield? ... I'll just stack another account on top of the 5-6 i already have. No problem! Let me fix up a few injectors, and the issue is resolved......
---
2. The safety that big entities offer while mining.  - You really can't lose anything as long as you don't make silly mistakes. Call for help, and light that cyno.... Issue resolved.
---
3. The almost infinite amount of ore you can mining in a system/region.
---
4. The sheer Opness of how you can just AFK you're way into getting ore.... Again scaleability.
---
You really need to stop nerfing the rorqs yield, and instead look at the core issues behind it. Making regions/systems get diminished returns on respawns. If you mine an area excessively  it should stop spawning prime ore every cycle.
---
This goes for ratting aswell btw. Less spawns the more you rat in the area....
---
Honestly, with the Astero's already great base align-time (2.62s w/ all 5s), I'd say it's a bit of a waste of the hull's potential to fit all these mobility modules just to run away with. You should only be scanning in near-empty systems and ensuring your checking both D-Scan often and zKillboard of whomever is in your system, this preliminary intel will mean a hell of a lot more than being able to align a second faster.  
---
The Astero is pretty damn lethal for a ship designed primarily for exploration, and you can definitely get some bite out of it without leaving yourself unable to run away. You can use all of your low slots for armour/drone damage, leaving at least one mid slots open for use (two if you use an Integrated Analyzer rather than seperate Data and Relic).  
---

---
Two mid slots are left open for your choice of either two specialised Analyzers or one Integrated Analyzer and a wildcard (Point or whatever else tickles your fancy).
---
Maintains the 2.62s align time of the base hull, while providing a good amount of DPS (105 w/ Hobgoblin IIs @ my skills) for dealing with other small-sized ships, with a decent burst tank of 66.1 EHP/s. It also keeps very good scanning strength (100~ with my skills) letting you scan down every single site you can run in this thing including Limited Sleeper Caches which, long as you keep the MWD off when you're in the clouds, this thing can easily tank long enough to hack all the containers.
---
It also has good room to bling if you're willing to spend some good money on your home-away-from-home. You can upgrade both the SAR and MWD to Deadspace modules to _greatly_ increase the cap stability of your ship, as well as buff up the tank to decrease the risk you're taking when engaging in combat. All depends on how comfortable you are in your ability to keep yourself alive long enough to get a return-on-investment when doing Null-Sec sites. I'd definitely make sure you know how to MWD-Cloak before you invest any serious money on it, at bare minimum, Sabres are very common.
---
Brave tweak: gotta use salvagers
---
Nope. I was talking about anchoring a second.
---
I feel completely betrayed by CCP and with these changes will be seriously debating unsubing. It's like they dont even attempt to see what the players want and dont care, it's all about forcing plex sales. More and more risk, less and less reward. But you can buy plex to make up for not being able to mine, buy plex cause you lost that carrier. What a bunch of crap. Making the game pay to win!
---
yes. I do. on purpose.  34 missiles (less for t2) go very very quickly on a haw leviathan, you will need to reload in any serious combat.
---
Little disappointed they didn't just admit HAWs and PANICs were fucking stupid and doomheim them. Both nerfs are welcome I suppose but don't actually fix the problems caused.
---
Holy shit bros this is it! EVE is still alive!
---
It feels like mad is the default response to CCP dev blogs, but I'm confused this time. I'm a logi/fax pilot so I feel like I should be mad at the diminishing returns thing but I love that change. Should I be mad at the VNI/carrier ratting nerfs? Watching ratters die is too fun for that. I can't find anything to be annoyed at and that's odd.
---
Implants that give you cat ears. We all know its that
---
which is good
---
ratting and mining is way to safe nowadays and carrier ratting is super stupid anyways (yes supercarrier as well)
---
Renaming the cluster fuck of metamodules which makes no sense into a systematic naming convention.
---
Maybe also the same with their stats.
---
The preview has dark green as the base color. Why is the base color gold on the kikamora. Not sure lighting makes it that much of a difference?
---
unfortunately one have to pay actual attention, wow ;)

Noooo RIP HAW Phoenix :(

Well, they are clearly listening to player complains and most of the changes seem really solid. All around a very good devblog that I think a lot of people have been waiting for quite some time.
---
This is pretty great tbh, I like it... but if I may complain about a single thing: WHY THE FUCK AREN'T THEY BUFFING MEDIUM ACs AND INSTEAD BUFFING LASERS?!?!?! FFS CCP!!!
---
the dream is still alive because its a nerf to titans

but its still only a dream because god damn is the phoenix ugly

"im out of fuel on my rorq, can someone bring a mach?"

---
Minor tweak 2: all gates have Drifter gate-guns
---
Do you even math bro?
---
I think your missing something. Eve has already gone through an extended period where a small number or very large organizations have controlled large portions of the map. Even today, you have have want amounts to 3-5 coalitions controlling all nullsec depending on how you divide the map. 
---
What you want is it to be hard to defend large empires and easy to defend small ones. The current anomaly system does a much better job of that then previous systems. Despite its many flaws, it still requires you use the space to gain any tactical benefit. 
---
Reducing the supply of ore (or ratting bounties), through either anomaly nerfs or yield/payout nerfs does nothing to help small groups. Forcing large groups to spread out doesn't help them either. 
---
It will drive conflict yes, but the bigger fish will always win. Want to help small groups? Make it so that large orgs have to cram in to smaller spaces. Too many people competing for resources? That will cause more groups to spit off and form their own alliance. 
---
Change: Medium Autocannons dps, range, application buffed to be actually useful.
---
this post should have never been made and your brain should be harvested for research into swine behavioral science studies
---
Believe it or not groups actually exist outside of NS that use rorquals without a super umbrella. I like the changes but they do affect the small groups disproportionately more than those who live in the umbrella. Though I'm not sure how you could ever make a change that would affect large groups without hurting small groups in regards to rorquals.
---

---
Nobody tell him.
---
Right but how would you use an alt to anchor a second usable depot? Alternatively, how would you anchor two depots in exactly the correct spots with a rorqual?
---
Would you position them with a faster ship before bringing the rorqual in? 
---
Perimiter: battleroyale 
---
added tweak: the static J is always another C6 
---
Hopefully this relieves everyone screaming about no AT tournament and this game going to shit, etc, etc. 
---
Hence the "slight" increase. The loss of drone speed is bigger. I kind of doubt even together these nerfs will do much, but at least they make the process slightly more annoying and riskier.
---
Well, if a super-group cant break through a bubble-camp then somethings wrong. Or the gate-blockers are really dedicated and deserve the likely big fight they re provoking.
---
This is a neater way to nerf rorquals. Nerf ore availability not rorqual strength. Nerfing rorqual strength disproportionately affects the smaller guys. 
---
Goons defend with the biggest umbrella. Their rorquals will always be harder to kill. 
---
Every dead rorqual raises mineral prices. Meaning every living rorqual gets a small price bump. 
---
If more rorquals are dying outside delve vs inside this means the goons are gaining relative value. 
---
If you hard cap the ore in a system it doesn’t matter how many rorquals you have. You need to spread out in order to find more places to mine. Unlimited Instant respawning ore anomalies are the problem not rorquals. 
---
nullseccers say "shut up wh. you want us to come in there for you?"
---
structures can now tether each other
---
&gt; big null empires will remain big and small guys will get fucked a lot more.
---
Maybe you should get bigger?
---
Seriously, there's almost nothing CCP can do to nerf player choices to concentrate their numbers and in doing so, concentrate their power. 
---
I wasn't talking about using an alt. And I didn't say it was _easy_ :D
---
(I'm unsure if you could get them both within range. it would be difficult to set up.)
---
This is an absolutely fantastic start.
---
I think there will still be more to do re capital application in subcap fights (the NSA and cynos are still going to be problematic), but nerfing HAW titans and fighter application is a great start.
---
And nerfing PANIC and excavators is also excellent, even if again I suspect rorq multiboxing will still dominate the mineral game to an unhealthy degree.
---
The balance changes on subcaps look good too, even if I do use a gila a lot and it will negatively affect me.
---
This is why I miss you being a mod.
---
i dont think you understand how oppressive sabres can be on a multi-jump move op....
---
tfw you wake up, pile of quafe cans everywhere, *Auroa bong* **skill progress lost**
---
Meh full coverage intel of a entire region lets me know if gangs are close by.
---
If i get tackled ill just shadow my carrier with a couple of Huginns.
---
Then theres the Full POWER of the all mighty CYNO
---
And u need 20 points to hold down a super.....
---
The current mods won't even let me post a thread without removing it. All of the nu-mods below jibrish are literally just hitler
---
&gt; Pilgrim buff: Didn't see it, did I miss it somewhere?
---
It's hiding in the closet with autocannons.
---
dont have such a focus on making isk. You already probably make way more than you lose. The game is best played when you dont treat it like a wallet simulator
---
What change makes you need to have 10+ rorqs all of a sudden?
---
You can't expect me to run around with 800s in my snake.
---
amen
---
This is great info, thank you.  
---
I have a quick question - when I google stuff or get answers like yours, people will say things like "fit another tank rig/cap rig" etc. How do I know...where to look/browse for such modules and rigs?  
---
So say I thought "oh yeah more tank would be nice and I've a spare rig slot", how would I go about browsing for something?  
---
Thanks again!
---
This all looks great
---
It's okay I didn't need heavy fighter V anyways.
---
levi able to use 6 launches.. 1/2 of 6 =..... 3? quik mafs
---
Praise James 
---
Yeah, I don't get why depots get a ref cycle when MTUs don't.
---
You are correct. There are a lot more sheep in NZ than China. 
---
Oh, I ve seen that and been there. They d need as subcap wing to keep the field clr of that pests then.
---
My thinking is making all that big-ass capital ships( and I own several of those myself) keep their ongrid firepower and stuff and just make them more a "huge, slow group of war juggernauts used to secure or push borders" instead of "suddenly supers" everywhere. Giving subcaps more overall importance and let caps be a tool to be used in real block wars.
---
"You guys don't have directional scanners?"
---
I hate to say it but that single change has me pretty excited
---
Ah ok ill go to Hophib and shout it
---
Will carriers be able to JUMP with the NSA ON?
---
I wouldn't put it past CCP to completely overlook this
---
I like green KB ;)
---
Oh, good thing I spent 2 years training specifically to optimally pilot the Phoenix and Leviathan which I recently finished.  I didn't wanna pilot it anyways, it was all just a joke  
---
haha funny reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Any requests for ship nerfs? I’ll start training for that, and as soon as training completes, the nerf will happen.
---
That face when you realize wh space recieves the least frequent changes out of all areas of space.
---
Flying subcaps in 2019
---
Suddenly freighters become the most feared ships in eve
---
That's because rorq tank is massively OP and bomber DPS is not.
---
Don't look at the JF loss of yours then
---
I keep hearing rumor of possible Trig capitals?
---
Have a reread of how it works. 
---
&gt; Because the modifier amount depends on the actual rep amount being applied, rather than the count of reps active, cruiser sized logistics are less effected by diminishing returns
---
I'd say it's more effort than 95% of the spodbrains are willing to invest, which means regular excavator drops which is ok by me
---
sabres would have to get a combat timer for dropping a bubble.
---
Still isk efficient vs titan blobs, which is a huge change. 
---
If it becomes possible - even in a semi-theoretical sense - to fight titans without having more titans of your own, a lot of the current null meta (which is entirely focused on getting more titans on your side) changes. It'd be possible to take greater risks with caps (since if you get dropped by supers, you have counterplay other than committing titans) as well as supers (if you lose a bunch of titans you're no longer out of the sov game, you can defend your space with dreads). 
---
Ah, sorry. Point's a pretty common term, so I just assumed you'd know it. It refers to Warp Disruptors, they have lower scramble strength than normal Warp Scramblers and don't shut off Microwarpdrives but have far longer ranges.
---
And to find rigs, I simply think of what I want from my ship, and then just browse the market to see all the rigs that are available. For instance, if you're in an armor ship and want more tank? Armor Rigs under Ship Modifications on the market will show you all the Armor Rigs. More Cap? Engineering Rigs. You'll also begin to just innately know what rigs are available as you fit more ships and get more game knowledge.
---
I was hoping for a bit stronger FAX nerf - there have been numerous times our little fleet of a dozen or two people would get ahold of a couple sub caps we could usually easily kill, only to have a FAX come through and ruin the fun. But still it’s a positive change so I ain’t mad.
---
and that's a good thing 
---
Sounds Swedish
---
Was talking with my friend Wix about this a couple of days ago. Said it was a really good time and I'm glad you guys had fun :)
---
The biggest thing about the Zeugmas is that it gets benefits from data and relic bonuses. Meaning the blackglass data hacking implant affects it hacking relics.
---
I would be 100% fine with this.
---
Honestly for last few months ive made... pretty much nothing. Cloaky campers are a pain :D 
---
there's the range, but you also have to be in range of both, which gets tricky
---
lol perfect response
---
Sure, sure. Thats why roundabout 1 out of 3 fleets these days is NOT in bombers and why Rorqs never call for safe-fleets since they can tank everything dropped on them.
---
Snap that hurt me i dont even care about chavish.
---
DO PEOPLE EVEN UNDERSTAND SARCSAM ANYMORE
---
Sweet, thank you. Yeah there are a handful of PvP specific terms that I'm pretty clueless about because I've only ever dabbled in PvE or exploring.  
---
Would you mind having a quick look at my edit when you get a minute? You've been a great help, thanks.
---
but medium beams! we're almost there.
---
Its really awesome, although there is no iteration on the timeline and knowing ccp this is all we will get for at least a year.
---
* cap umbrellas are nearly unchanged - although dreadbombs may work.
---
* dropping caps on roaming subs is still a thing as long as sirens and dromis exist and fax remain as powerful as they are.
---
* panic hardly received a nerf. 
---
really good changes although you wont see small gang making a revival just yet.
---
downside is against a large blob you will very quickly drop below a threshold where you can break titans I bet.  combined with the insurance nerf - I doubt dreadbomb on supercap fleet will be effective (unless you get a staggering imbalance).
---
Point 1 and 2, let's say I can understand, but I never am going to do it that way.
---
Bad for me I guess.
---
Point 3, roleplaying as member/follower of slaveowner religiously extremist aristocracy, and complaining about political incorrectness in a way typical for slaveowner descendants and religious extremists is the thing that I don't understand - especially aligning with FW group which is actively fighting against Tribal Liberation Force.
---
I mean, we are in video game, I get it, it's fictional universe, but still this move is highly illogical to me.
---
Props to the active community who are consistently giving feedback in one way or another. On the other hand, those that fly off the handle and biomass their pilots won't be missed. Good riddance.
---
K
---
eh that kills a decent chunk of brawling bs solo fits. i don't think that's the way to go.
---
Had another one of my posts removed yesterday for no fuckin reason vOV gets super annoying. Fuck that noise, that's mega-bullshit.
---
Mods need to stop removing random shit and let the community decide what the upvote and what to downvote to oblivion.
---
sounds about right
---
I feel special.
---
What features did Eve Hunt have? Looking for a webdev project to work on, maybe something like this.
---
This would be an interesting change. I wouldn't *like* it, but it could do interesting things for the game. Right now, a DST is my go-to hauler for basically everything, and it all goes to Jita or Amarr. Banning DSTs from highsec would open a tradeoff between high volume hauling in lowsec or using less optimal haulers in highsec.
---
The rorq yield change hurts, only just scaled up to 3 rorq accounts. With the reduction in yield i fear a titan, which ive been working towards for 2 years, will become unobtainable again. With 35b liquid i was 10b from a titan hull and 25b from fully fit. Really disappointed with these changes. Unsurprising nobody stuck up for the little guy aiming for a titan, I'm sure every member of the CSM has their titans already so was more than happy to see prices increase.
---
The Phoenix isn't getting nerfed. All Dreadnoughts are getting a double damage bonus to HAW weapons on siege. 
---
TITANS GOT A FUCKING NERF TOO HOLY SHIT XD
---
yo i might just start playing again
---
This post has already been removed

Noooooo!

[Literally bragging about removal](https://i.imgur.com/2H2Qf3l.png)
---
Some random guy agrees with me
---
Because it's in the game and they can't just make it disappear. This is generally a good change. Miners now risk 2 or more drones at the minimum while still being able to swap out modules as needed.
---
10/10 cover bro
---
Maybe ur CSM candidate shouldn't have gotten disqualified but anyway. P sure at least 2 of the CSM don't have or use supers.
---
But yeah perhaps they should have gone after ore anoms respawn rate/ore content rather then the hull itself.
---
\&gt; the little guy aiming for a titan 
---
That's the problem. When titans came out they were in noway meant for the 'little guy'. Now every little guy is getting a titan and its fucking the game up.
---
zzzzz
---
oh, don't mind me. i'm jsut here for a nap and front row seats to watching hte mods smack ya again
---
About your edit; yeah, that sounds to be about right. The main skills you'll find useful for specifically the Astero's combat abilities will be;
---
* Amarr Frigate, simply improving your armor resists making you harder to kill and making your Armor Repairer more effective.
---
* Any skills that affect your armor or armor repairer (Hull Upgrades, Repair Systems, [resist type] Armor Compensation), 
---
* Anything that'll help your capacitor go further (Capacitor Management, Capacitor Systems Operation and High Speed Maneuvering)
---
* Drones skills (as many as you have the time to get after you've got Drones V, ones like Drone Interfacing, Light Drone Operation, [faction] Drone Operation, etc.). 
---
Preferably, you'll have as many of those to at least level 4, with the 1x skills (like Hull Upgrades) to V already. They're all very good general purpose skills that will help **all** your ships in the future, not just the Astero.
---
Gallente Frigate can be nice, but you can give it a pass for specifically the Astero, it'll be just fine at level 4 at the most as your drones generally won't get targeted instead of you when you're in a Frigate.
---
Back in my day, harvesting nanoribbons gave you a decent wage. Now we just let them rot in the field.
---
dont forget about the 35 second reload the rapid torp levi has
---
Damn, son.  
---
I'm always behind on EVE updates because I play other games more regularly, but that seems like a lot of damage for haw weapons.
---
Now that's an important question.
---
They removed the re-post
---
vOv don't care
---
mods can fuck off. 
---
Yes fucking please. Something with at least 80k so we dont need a freighter or a rorqual to haul large structures. Or something like the orca but with different bay sizes so you could have like a mini bowhead, or a large dst, or a mineral hauler.
---
My Body is Ready
---
or maybe, just maybe, people who are not in the same alliance/coalition can nevertheless actually be friends because it's a fucking video game and who gives a shit? And so "well who leaked to him, let's determine based on ingame politics" is just moronic, even assuming there had actually been any sort of leak?
---
You only need to just be below 2s, anything lower is a waste of low/rig slots.
---
CCP Nerfed the base damage of all HAW guns/launchers by 50%. This is to reduce the damage done by HAW Titans which are currently incredibly oppressive to subcaps.   
---
Dreadnoughts are getting +100% bonus in siege to HAW weapons so the damage that they deal is exactly the same as before the HAW nerf. So nothing is changing for Dreads, and max tank HAW titans are losing about 1.5k-1.6k DPS. 
---
bring back omegafleet
---
How's that?
---
im not actually baiting he's literally just being an idiot
---
Ah sorry I was thinking of Serpentis
---
yeah I know vOv 
---
I've had enough posts randomly removed without explanation to know the moderation of this subreddit is basically North Korea right now. 
---
If you have any pull anywhere it'd be really nice to have some actual non-bullshit moderation here
---
jacks not trying to make excuses, hes explaining why the drop was so much less effective than it coulda been hahaha
---
They should make rorquals be boosters primarily.
---
Remove excavators and see to them mining slightly less than a boosted hulk. (So the single required booster on grid doesn't get fucked autmatically)
---
Bring back barge/exhumer fleets!
---
r/eve is dying.  mods don't give a shit about normal players, they just want to collect all that sweet sweet sub money from the multi boxing posters and bots.    
---
It is a vedmak from side rear
---
Holy crap...those skills from years ago are going to pay off for the Phoenix...just made myself a rev and nag. And boom my levi skills might as well stop them now. 
---
I imagine a "Wah Wah Wah" trumpet sound
---
uhm, sorry but did we read the same blog? If theres enough fax on grid to penalize the fax, then the bomb already failed anyways.
---
The weapon’s base damage is being nerfed 50%, so dreadnaughts will not see an impact, only Titans. 
---
I asked myself the same question. But i came to the answer that a couple hundred calculations probably aren't affecting the server too much. 
---
I was a moderator but stepped down due to the fact that Jibrish and I were the only active moderators. I made a lot of good changes with him to the subreddit, but ended up burning out of eve. The people that Jibrish brought in have been nothing but trouble.
---
sarcasm went away the same time people started finding jokes offensive and britain began arresting people for it.
---
Excellent, thanks so much.  
---
24hp/s is dwarfed by your mentioned 66 - what would help this in particular? Repair Systems and what else?  
---
That's my last question, you've been great. Thanks again.
---
You can mine to your hearts content. I dont even think yield should be nerfed, the isk /hr /account is already dreadfully low. The issue is that they are invulnerable. 
---
same tbh

only about 4 years after they were first announced.

---
Inb4 collateral damage
---
&gt; how they hyped it
---
you mean one tweet. a few hours before it came out?
---
Change: five “Sansha wormholes” with stain static and a static to a system undergoing an incursion.
---
Is it just me, or am I the only one who sees the insurance payouts on supers so laughably low already, I never would dream of paying for it, unless I knew I was about to go on an op that I was *certain* there was a good chance I was going to lose the ship? 
---
Not really quite sure what nerfing the payouts does (unless there was an insurance fraud problem) other than further convince people not to waste their isk using the insurance isk sink. 
---
Maybe I am totally off base here though. 
---
&gt; Ergo, throwing a ton of nanite paste at it is the only solution.
---
Or warp to a citadel. I don't care whether he docks up or sits in tether.
---
Good the more they touch stuff the more it goes to shit
---
I care
---
Ah, that's because I was talking about a different metric; the in-game fitting screen shows you raw HP per second, I was talking about _effective_ HP per second. If you have 100 health, and 50% resists, you effectively have 200 health. So if you have a module that is repairing 10 HP per second, with 50% resists it is effectively repairing 20 HP per second. So in actuality, your repair rate would be a lot closer to the one I stated.  
---
To get EHP/s, you'll need to use an external fitting program. Try getting [Pyfa](https://github.com/pyfa-org/pyfa/releases) set up, it's far friendlier and easier to use for trying out fits, and it displays things such as the mentioned EHP/s. So with the Astero fit, which has _at least_ 65% resists on all armor resistances with Amarr Frigate V, 24HP/s would turn into easily at least 60 EHP/s
---
Yeah it seems fair to factor in reload time when comparing a rapid launcher with a regular one, especially in long fights. 
---
:munch:
---
Check new post
---
It's at least enough for a malediction or sabre to get a jump on a carrier occasionally. Especially if said carrier is only watching local and not adjacent systems. 
---
Rorquals getting the bat again 
---
ECM drones will break lock on you in the unlikely event you don't get off the grid in time. They aren't for fighting, they are for running. Think of them like an emergency backup.
---
Change: you can boosh in hisec
---
this is a good post.
---
good
---
the subreddit is damned to dust. just like the game.
---
Yeah, because everyone exclusively flies in space where they have a friendly citadel they can use.
---
You must never leave your blue space.
---
&gt;little guy getting a titan
---
Titans used to be alliance-wide efforts. Lmao
---
Just like the game, it doesn't have to die quickly though.
---
Tbh i was expecting someone to put Falcons face on that running, gasmask wearing, bat-wielding guy
---
Aha! Thanks. I installed Pyfa a while ago but don't really use it since I don't play with fits. I should get more accustomed.  
---
Thanks for all your help.
---
&gt; i remember one episode of stargate
---
That was a prison planet, hence why the DHD was removed. People would stand in front of the opening wormhole (killing themselves) with the idea that it took freed them. 
---
&gt; what about playing a pingpong throught stargate hmmmm
---
Stargates were only able to active in one direction at a time.
---
Corps that couldn't bear to leave the umbrella. Just shows what their priority is.
---
Why did you write all these words just to say `Can we please just decrease mobile depot capacity instead?`
---
rip off the band-aid and move on. this place deserves to die.
---
they are bringing  implants to make capital guns  replacement for excavators. you will have  pet guns  shooting asteroids
---
Bait my ass, spend time and money on this game and for what!? 
---
Rip Hard Knocks lol.
---
Says the man who has deleted it twice, spamming "SHARK WEEK" in discord, and accusing me of "baiting retards". 
---
No problem, good luck out there!
---
&gt;olmeca gold.
---
CCP just wouldn't understand Caps are either going to be extremely powerful or gotten nerfed enough to be just a niche
---
And here we are, again, only the math shenanigans
---
Why not make it great again
---
Another great GSM accomplishment
---
I would that Chessur were alive to see this glorious day!
---
:thonkerguns:
---
good bot
---
Hah I won a bet. Cheers olmecca
---
Corax is so horrible right now though, it needs another buff of some sort other then the CPU increase that they are giving it. Something specific to give it a niche would be cool, maybe sig reduction + movement increase, or better missile bonus, or better shield, not sure.
---
i would love  increasing mining yield over time....triglavian mining barge would kick ass and evict  t1 barges
---
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Guess you have to improve your skills to adapt to these changes :P
---
You'd need to drop it from 4000 m3 to less than 2250 m3 to achieve the change CCP wants. That would be too invasive to other uses of mobile depots.
---
PS: I have to write a lot of words because each angle I did not include is a counterpoint for those lurking this subreddit to shit on my posts and balance opinions at all costs. I'd rather supressing them in the OP than engaging with people in toxic 1-on-1s.
---
Wow i wish i had paid more attention to this i would have stacked up on books a week ago. 
---
i see..  i would  have to activate the  gate throw the  pingpong ball. close gate wait for them to reopen then wait for ball wait for gate to close then activate and return it..  if it was stable both sides would be fun
---
Roll back to beta
---
Cry more.
---
Death of AT
---
Adapt or die might be actually the best answer here?
---
I mean, you have a good point about how this affects that niche gameplay (and don't get me wrong, those activities engaged by few players with enough creativity and skill are one of the things that make EVE stand out), but even if the changes will make it harder to boosh excavator it hardly makes it impossible; you will now have to make more significant choices when fitting your transport ship, which by no means is a bad thing imo.
---
Nah, goons will simply throw in more capitals to compensate
---
Nothing would change with those number game
---
This was probably one of the biggest low key anti botting balances CCP has ever done. Rather than trying to keep up with the massive tide of constant new bots just remove the ship abilities that they use. Sig tanking drone boats, carrier NSA warp. Pretty solid. 
---
Did someone bet on I wouldn't make a post about this? That's just dumb. Congrats to you though :)
---
What are you smoking, and can I have some?
---
Kinda want the NSA to give back the fighter penalties.  
---
If it's extra risk, give a good combat incentive to keep running it.  
---
Explain your logic. 
---
Pretty sure /u/ccp_falcon was just photoshopping his face onto some stuff for a laugh there at the end. Most of those numbers look pretty well-reasoned, though I think the rorq and HAW titan nerfs are too-little too-late. I'm happy to be shown that I'm wrong on those counts.
---
this is an adequate post
---
Ok I banned Chevis
---
&gt; Adapt or die might be actually the best answer here?
---
There has literally been no Eve-related situation where this was a good answer.
---
&gt; hardly makes it impossible
---
Nerfs don't make activities impossible. They nerf them.
---
&gt; you will now have to make more significant choices when fitting your transport ship
---
Booshers are the ones scooping drones from the field. So it's not the "transport ship fittings" that change. It's the boosher fittings themselves.
---
Chevis is only interested in back cum these days.
---
Who are you again?
---
There is scan res implants
---
This is your brain on spod, kids.
---
Are you kidding it's one of the least shit ones ...
---
weren't we complaining about too much isk in the game? I agree with you, but it could be something tweaked easily if dreadbombs suddenly die out.
---
&gt; accusing me of "baiting retards"
---
Looks like you caught one lmbo
---
Yeah! I discovered that when doing some Googling which is what prompted me to make the push for it. One-shotting my way through the mini-game is a joy.

They sig tank anoms, I'm curious what the tiny change will do to that.

This is all because of the Goon CSM whose entire agenda is to personally go after Olmeca - the one and only brave soul ~~~the resistance~~ - who is standing in the way of our mighty RMT empire.

If only Asher has a popular forum from which to espouse his thoughts and wax philosophical on the patch notes... something like a podcast maybe?

so plex prices will be  3bill for 30day of omega.   good riddance. ccp  are putting their hands in guilotine  with all that nerfs..  best solution was to remove excavators  then give 300% mining yield to augmented drones  and 250% for harvester mining drones and 200% for tech2 mining drones..
---
excavator drones are total bullshit and ccp  development mistake.
---
nerfing  rorqual  tank . bueheheheheh pathetic way to do so... use other method: give ALL subcap ships bonus  100% damage agaist capital industrial ships then then whatever fits rorqual,it will always go down. 
---
capital nerfing  hmmm . give  subcap ships  additional resistance agaist  HAW weapons just  give them 50% bonus,then haw titans would still eat  sand.
---
fax changes are good but i would make the reps like triglavian gun,they would  repair while spooling up and after 1-2 minutes they would  gain full repair ability and  these two minutes could change evrything,before fleet can effectively rep it would be already dead.
---
carrier nerf with  NSA - good change no hit and run while being aligned to citadel/station/safespot when  NSA is activated.
---
If you think this is bad content you can downvote it. 
---
Bait
---
More like Mao.
---
hey look different space has different strengths
---
i mean there's always goons to complain about right? 
---
We'll have to see the actual impact on ticks but most likely it just means either a nav computer instead of a tracking link, or active target management by the pilot.
---
Tl;dr: slight nerf to AFK ratting, minimal impact on semi-AFK. 
---
You should have taken a SS of this, if done in local, and sent a support ticket to CCP. CCP has zero tolerance for this. 
---
At least this decade's balance patch is a good one. I'd hate to have to deal with poor balance for the next 10 years until the next balance patch.
---
So .... About the upcoming new ship / modules ...

Mah speculation: Trig Dred or Trig XL weapons for Leshak or a module that enables / coverts some battleships to equip XL weapons, marauders maybe with a different style bastion ?
---
Nah, we learned the lesson. I bought logoff freighters for everyone in corp. Will be nothing at all to loot next time. 
---
You're doing God's work
---
You mean Sweaty Ass Sugar
---
Will probably be similar in calculating as damage cap on citadels. 
---
The judge and amazingjay are mods now. That says it all.
---
You actually think us ‘nullseccers’ don’t enjoy this change? Lmao
---
This is the best shit ever
---
The NSA change I can see.  That would make them easier to catch, as if they aren't already considering how slow they are.  But a 45% nerf to all fighter tracking is a bit overkill.  You're essentially taking a huge dump on everyone that worked hard for those Super Carriers in favor of drying the tears of those crying because they don't want to work for those things.
---
While there would be some use, it's not subcap pilots clamoring for them.
---
Not even 3200 cap boosters?
---
just give booshers an Excavator bay of whatever the new volume is 
---
That's actually pretty well thought out. 
---
That's not necessarily true at all about larger groups, nor does it really address my problem.  Plenty of large groups utilize tackle ships at the moment, and with more pilots comes easier access to tackle.
---
But even if they didn't, post-nerf they will.  When any new gameplay just requires more pilots, it hurts the smaller groups disproportionately.  That's not always a bad thing, because larger groups are looking at different bits of content, and should have some advantage earned in regards to their size.  In this case though, I'm not a huge fan of being able to use carriers less, as they have actually been a good option against superior subcap numbers.
---
I really do think the application nerf vs the nsa nerf illustrates exactly what I want out of balancing efforts in eve.  The nsa nerf will require carrier pilots to adapt new fittings, pay more attention, and be more committed to fights.  The application nerf just decreases utility until additional pilots are added to fleet, either rewarding additional blobbing efforts, or decreasing ship usage.
---
Jesus fuck
---
Triglavian bomber would be nice.
---
A Vedmak mining t2 mods from some krab maybe?
---
Between this and Halo coming to PC, it's been a pretty great week.
---
No one cares Chevis
---
&gt; And u need 20 points to hold down a super.....
---
Or one sabre.
---
I was waiting for a good lolmeca post following these changes. doesn't disappoint 
---
&gt; Work that paint
---
God, you gotta at least take me to dinner first.
---
Learn to write for one. Not everything is against you, but I will let you keep your tin hat. 
---
Especially since the main forums are all screeching. 
---
Delete excavators. Delete PANIC. Give Rorquals a Modulated Ion Asteroid Blaster II instead.
---
Bless 
---
Would be excited if I was still playing, but it isn't enough to bring me back. Hopefully they continue down this road.
---
I appreciate your effort of obfuscating a decent balance topic for your alliance interests. Mod behavior people should aspire to.
---
thank you!
---
The Zeugmas double dips on data and relic bonuses and penalties. But heres the sticking point: The blackglass only debuffs data analyzers and not relic so the -40 is only applied once. 
---
So you get +50 health from Hacking, +50 from Archeology, It double dips on the bonus from a Covops/Astero for +20 health. It double dips on the Poteque 'Prospector' Environmental Analysis EY-1005 for another +10 health increase and you can put a +20 health rig on your ship (doesn't matter either one will give the same benefit.)
---
With all those bonuses you will have 160 Coherence on your Zeugmas. With -40 you end at 120 Coherence, 15 less than a T2 relic analyzer.
---
So all totaled you trade 15 coherence and 2 utility slots for +30 attack power.
---
Excavators are the only risk factor for most Rorquals in the game.
---
No, and the issue behind a steeper discounting function is that it would absolutely turbofuck medium and small scale engagements. WHs especially would get fucked if, say, 5 FAXes repped as much as 3. 
---
Implying the better bots aren't already reading intel channels.
---
Alright I'll bite
---
Oh wow.  
---
Although, I currently have the Prospector implant...aren't they both Slot 9?
---
&gt; Unsurprising nobody stuck up for the little guy aiming for a titan,
---
yikes
---
When have Plex prices ever gone down?  But this Nulsec mining Nerf should mean Plex prices will rise slower
---
They did say a while ago they will be making a pass over all Navy ships, we'll see if that happens.
---
well the server is already calculating incoming reps 
---
because they are repairing your ship
---
Hey if CCP is going to NERF all the capitals ships by about 20-30% how about you nerf your subscription and plex costs by 20-30%??? I think that's a good trade off. 
---
Most of it is a big hidden nerf to all non-umbrella rorqs. 
---
Is this ship a tornado?
---
Minor: Bumping now knocks skill points from ya heed
---
Dibs.
---
&gt;at least before the bash started.
---
And once a structure has been hit, and thus has either a Repair or Reinforcement timer ticking, it cannot be refit. So it still can't have those modules.
---
Yes it is
---
these nerfs are a great start, though. Local tank needs a substantial nerf, FAX will still be oppressive in small-gang warfare. I would also like to see sig radius reduction applied to cap reps.
---
Capitals aren't exactly going to be worthless in the slightest. They're just not going to be as destructively overpowered as they are now. What's the issue?
---
When reddit started it was modded by guys that claimed the address, and it was fine. A mob rebellion made them hand it over to the people that posted the most - no other qualifications. They turned it into a playground for shitposting and pretty much made it their version of a fun place. You mods (most have left EVE), if anyone, are responsible for driving away people. Moderation sucked.
---
But a much higher chance of killing the target seems worth to me. Especially since the same insurance nerf applies to the supercap you're trying to kill. 
---
Honestly I've lived out of wormholes and it's fun to not have a local.
---
Let's bring this to nullsec where there isn't a limit on the size / mass of ships that could enter at one time.  This means, in theory, everyone who has an old true deep safe could hide their whole fleet  of 500 Titans in the same system as a upcoming big fight just by leaving them in deep safes and logging on in combat ceptors.
---
basically the only groups I could see this helping would be the most massive of null-blocks and a couple niche small gang roamers.
---
Not sure I like all the changes.  Rorq mining may be safe in sov null, but it is already sketch AF in low sec and about to get more so.  Thanks ccp.  Also  WTB munnin nerf.  
---
&lt;3 Logi love =)
---
slow your roll just a bit. They haven't been committed to TQ just yet. It's not to late for CCP to fuck it up.
---
I'd say DEFCON 2.5
---
It's based on total reps coming in in the past second. more reps = more diminishment.
---
Yang gang yang gang yang gang 
---
T2 ABC is heavy bomber?
---
Huge nerf to non-Umbrella Rorqs, the opposite of what the community (not the CSM) had been asking for. 
---
they are fully legitimate and power moderators with a lot of control over the subreddit 
---
The titan equation is something like 2.5d = 80t if you kill 5 titans, you can afford to lose 160 dreads to have isk parity. Those dreads replace a lot faster.
---
You might now be able to do it instead of just killing an insufficient number of fax before the titans and super clear the dreads off the field. Especially since most titans are HAW titans it seems and they just got their non-DD DPS halved.
---
The issue is all the time and money spent to get there and the risk vs reward is just not there. Everyone just assumed that everyone with a capital is sitting on a huge load of isk and they need to be knocked down a peg. Well what about all the people who have worked hard to get here and ate now being chopped at the knees?
---
not saying if this is a good or bad thing - just that suicide dreads against titans might not be as effective as some might think, even if you kill 1 or 2 titans now compared to 0 before.
---
I think we are on the same level then.
---
Can regular caps use them? And is it fuel-cost-prohibitive to use it to move normal caps?
---
Nvm I forgot, ccp doesn’t know what low sec is.
---
&gt; A mob rebellion made them hand it over to the people that posted the most - no other qualifications.
---
That's not how it happened. It was done via upvotes and most of that team is no longer present, or is on hiatus.
---
&gt; hey turned it into a playground for shitposting and pretty much made it their version of a fun place.
---
It was shit posting long before the current team started modding here. Your rose colored goggles kick in after only 3 years, apparently.
---
&gt;  You mods (most have left EVE), if anyone, are responsible for driving away people. Moderation sucked.
---
I hope we drive your posting away.
---
wtf hahah, i had nothing to do with this 
---
Man, I got vaccinated by my parents and I'm still catching autism here
---
just like the game. 
---
Either/Or.  Both are correct.  
---
&gt; engaging with people in toxic 1-on-1s
---
You should start a blog. That way, you can filter exactly who replies and make sure they're on-message. It's a lot less work than arguing, after all.
---
&gt; Rorq changes
---
As a part-time Rorq pilot these seem ok to me. Panic timer adjustement is ok since you can still cyno while its active and it was either no cyno while panic or this.
---
However:
---
&gt; Excavator and yield changes
---
To me these changes do not justify the use of a Rorqual over a Orca anymore.
---
I use a Rorq and a Hulk to mine (2 accs) and after finally maxing my mining drone skills I was able to keep up with my Industry needs (keeping a small surplus of minerals after building for the local market).
---
With the reduction of the mining output but no reduction in drone cost the risk as a mid-level Industrial seems way too high to bother flying the thing, which is a shame if you ask me.
---
They could've done much better with just making excavators a sepcial type of fighter with their own ore hold so they can sit a few cylces before they have to be recalled. 
---
This way you wouldn't see 20+ afk rorquals anymore since that would no longer be possible(unless through the use of a bot of course).
---
Can't really talk much about the other changes since training into a dread or more combat oriented ships is a bit further down the line for me.
---
The Logi change wont affect me either for now but from what it looks like I'll still be able to heal stuff with my Guardian which is always good.
---
&gt; Pimped rorquals w/ excavators is a top 5 content generatating aspect in eve currently.
---
That you think this is a good thing is troubling. People hunt rorquals because there isn't anything else worth hunting. 
---
&gt; Just keep in mind it's quite silly that an assault frigate gang can afk orbit a titan for hours on end, assuming no reinforcements, without any repercussions.
---
gosh imagine what would happen if people didn't leave their unsupported supercapitals floating in space, or perhaps fit a smartbomb to their titan class super capital ship. if only there was some other bonus titans had that might make them hard for ships to hold down, like some sort of inherent warp core stability 
---
&gt; Meh. Just reduce drone control range, much simpler solution.
---
it is definitely much simpler to change a fundamental mechanic used by every ship with drones than tune two cruisers
---
y i k e s
---
The problem was that the risk/reward balance was skewed seriously too far in the direction of reward when it came to capitals. They pumped out way too much ISK for way too little reward. Capitals will still be able to make just as much money for the time invested, there will just now be more risk in the risk/reward equation.
---
It is p2w, it should be about time spent grinding vs risk vs reward. Right now they keep pushing people to plex instead of rat/mine because it will take longer to get your return on investment and as such equals more risk of losing the investment. It sucks people abuse this but for those of us who just enjoy playing it's a real slap in the face.
---
Kind of agree.  The combined nsa and fighter changes seem a little too much.  Thematically it makes zero fucking sense that light fighters can’t hit a damn cruiser.
---
Haaaaaaaaaaaaahahahaaaahahahaaaa
---
in lowsec a lot of people use pirate implants for casual pvp, it's perfectly safe as long as you warp off instantly and dont get smartbombed (so keep a brick tanked punisher in every station around your home and you're good).
---
That´s it? Good riddance this game. 
---
It's actually very bad. Right now if you drop 12-13b worth of dreads to kill a 14-16b super, you'll be isk positive by a large margin even considering that the defenders get to loot your wrecks. If you reduce insurance payouts by 30% not only are your zkill stats less elite, it's 30% more expensive to gank the same super. It's a pretty sizable nerf to smaller/medium size groups, considering that larger groups have many caches of dreads and faxes already produced &amp; paid for. 
---
hell has frozen till further notice
---
Interesting to see where this takes Eve.
---
Have you looked at how many capitals get popped every day? Tell me again about risk vs reward
---
Worked hard to get there lel. Sure.
---
I liked the 2 miner 1 dronea i got was very excited about them.
---
Honest question, and i know this is going to sound like a dick thing, but so be it.
---
Why do you need your Titan to do so much damage to subcaps? Do you think its good to have 1 ship that can do thousands of dps to a subcap that can barely do anything to it?
---
Sure, a fleet of subcaps can hurt a single Titan. But a fleet of HAW Titans will certainly hurt a fleet of subcaps more (which is a current issue). Now your Titan is equivalent to roughly that of a high DPS battleship. So now, instead of bringing your Titan to fight some subcaps, why not just bring out a battleship? 
---
You've probably never ran FW missions, wormholes or t5 abyssal sites
---
Actually if we start fightong a war it means we will lose shit. That means minerals will stsrt going up in price. THIS MEANS TITANS OVER 50BIL IN DELVE AGAIN FUCK YEAH!
---
You probably have Poteque 'Prospector' Archaeology AC-905. This is the slot where the Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40 goes, the Poteque 'Prospector' Environmental Analysis EY-1005 goes in slot 10.
---
&gt;Sabre
---
:) 
---
Eve has always been P2W, what´s your point? 
---
&gt; The big guys in mining (pretty much goons at this point) have been saying for a while that any nerf to mining will impact smaller groups more.
---
I'm sure they were saying that out of the goodness of their hearts and how much the care for the small groups. 
---
Please turn in your eve license, you are not allowed to actually think a change might be any good.
---
Exactly.  Means nothing for gone but hurts smaller groups.
---
&gt;*I hope people would get on my ass too.*
---
this I believe
---
and still we are getting more and more of them...
---
The entire reason for this is all the people crying that they can't have Super Carriers and that they can't kill them.  The people that only want to PVP and don't want to farm and make money to buy the ships and equipment to use against the bigger ships and bigger equipment. That isn't really feasible.  And taking such a huge cut against fighters is entirely unfair against the people that have spent all the time and effort to get there.  Now adding in an implant, or a super carrier specific mid slot item that would counteract this is one thing.  Not touching light fighters at all is another thing, too.  Regular carriers are very easy to kill, I lost one to a gang of destroyers and only took out two of them in the process.  Nerfing light fighters will make regular carriers entirely unusable in all situations.
---
By your own numbers an estimated 300 extra drops are going to die in killmails from the Weit changes with 120 of them dropping as loot. 
---
And it’s going to drop drone boosting by up to 210 drones per month on a worst case. 
---
Seems like a overall greater loss of excavator drones is the better out come.  Yes boosters will take a hit to their wallet but as you have said repeatedly you guys male too much isk anyway.   
---
If we get nerfed you get nerfed with us. 
---
It is, but it deserves more
---
Oh Noez! Your cargo tanked sub-3 second warping cloak n MJD glitching drone stealer ships are going to require you to A.) slow down a bit or B.) fit implants!!!!!!
---
The upcoming balancing is worth it just for this.
---
Was the bet on # of paragraphs his post would be?
---
All the same, they want to see the end of the game by killing off new player retention. 
---
Same
---
In a battle of purely drone-vs-drone mirror matches, drones just killing other drones, the 2x Armor/Shield / +10% Tracking of Navy Drones will win out over the +20% EHP / +10% Damage of T2 drones.
---
This CSM is developing a habit of leaks, aren't they?
---
I tried rorquals but I did not like it, so I liquidated the isk and stopped mining. I have a super, but I don't use it for ratting. I have a fax but don't really care anything about them. I don't really fly the subcaps in the devblog.
---
So yeah. :)
---
How's CVA doing nowadays? I'm out of the loop with Provi.
---
Aha! Yes you're quite right.
---
That's because of the raw amount of capital ships there are now across New Eden. They're so worth training into that this many people have them.
---
Got to give Goons credit on this one. Influencing game balance, now that’s meta gaming.
---
"I'm travel fit, I didn't want to miss the op.", I respond
---
"Dock up"
---
Wow a lot has changed since I played with &lt;3 &lt;3 fam &lt;3 -&lt;-&lt;-@, but it should be like:
---
WTF who forgot to dock up his fucking usless alt????  Aghhh its MAIN? What is this Dude is doing in that FUCKING CROW, dude are you trying to bridge IN THIS? Get out or take gate take proper shit or logout. \*sigh\* Dock and someone give this guy a ship
---
I am not saying they were... Doesn't mean they aren't correct
---
I heard we're always looking for Enyo Pilots
---
I don't understand why the Panic duration reduction was so tiny
---
it has, except in the space where you can help new players. But its not jsut me.  CCP too. and most vets I talk to.
---
Are you the Asher?
---
he's the 32nd best FC in the imperium, son. You better respect that.
---
Jibrish said he would make me a mod in Vegas but never did :(
---
Goon and crew meta gaming at its finest. 
---
Major Change: Reporting a suspected bot auto-bans it until the moderation team can review. (What could go wrong)
---
Oh poor thing
---
It depends on how much time you have to play. For me it took a lot of enjoyment out of the game to just pay subs. But more time making ISK means less time for PvP, so if your time is limited then paying for subs is definitely the way to go
---
Were still Provi. The kicking out last year didn't stick, holder alliances got shuffled a bit, mostly returned to business as usual.
---
the problems is is that you can drop two or three carriers on s gang and decimate the opposition.  right now its 100% caps&gt;subs making subs useless in the current meta.  Carriers can still be great support for a smaller fleet, but now the carriers themselves will not be able to wreck a small gang on their own.
---
Shit changes, and yet afk cloaky camping still remains untouched 
---
What on earth is this guy complaining about? 
---
Hmmmmm i dont see ccp saying anything and the vets you talk to are nc. And pl not like theybplay eve to begin with.
---
It's not +50% everywhere; Navy Drones have the same Structure as T1 drones but 2x Armor+Shields. T2 drones have +20% EHP everywhere.  
---
*Augmented* Drones meanwhile are +50% all EHP over T2 drones \[so +80% over T1s\].
---
I would do unspeakable things for whoever does balancing if it means getting a med projectile buff and stabber navy buff at the same time.
---
I'm pretty sure there's a fleet for every corp in there...
---
What members? You realize their biggest USTZ corp left and went to INIT months ago... and they just had like 5 more corps leave over the last month... so again I ask, what members did they have to move? All of the decent ones have moved on since they drug their feet for a year to even announce the move out here. 
---
Sure, it'll cost a bit more, but dreads aren't that expensive even more medium sized groups. Also it might be more viable now to use smaller ships and fewer dreads against ratting supers. 
---
With the Fighter and NSA nerf it gives a bigger window to get tackle on a super in an anom and easier for subcaps to tank them easily enough to be able to stay on grid and apply extra dps. 
---
I'm not saying it isn't a significant nerf, but it's not a crippling one, imo. 
---
hope you're well friend
---
I am going off of personal experience as well, albeit quite old experience.
---
Eh, if you reduce the wetu's capacity then they'd no longer work for swapping out capital modules. You could then reduce the size of capital modules, but that would have balance effects as well. It ain't as easy as just doing it and calling it a day.
---
Fw is dead, wormhole life sucks, and abysmal sites are an isk sink. I hope I do find better ways of making isk but as newer player this is what I have looked forward to doing.
---
Bill have you put up more bubbles yet this gonna be funny to watch.
---
Here I'll go by your example:
---
10 seconds to dscan, 20 seconds for the 15 au warp, and we'll give a generous 5 seconds for getting on top of the target. So assuming the target is awake and aware, you have to get him under 25 seconds of his NSA cycle to actually get to him if he happens to cycle the second you hit system.
---
That's ignoring the fact that people will probably just cycle, lock, decycle. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a step in the right direction, but it absolutely doesn't mean all the ratting carriers go pop.
---
tweakyboi: booshing ravens flags you as criminal
---
Im not all that tribal. I talk to anyone that will talk to me.
---
The brutix needs mad love.. ship should be as nasty as it looks..  
---
See I thought tank for a ratting super was bringing in a fax
---
Sarcasm is from the Latin, "tearing of flesh"
---
The best thing CCP ever did for wh space was forgetting about it entirely.
---
Those of us who aren't space rich right on the edge of or having just gotten our first capital get bent over and shafted without lube by these changes.
---
If they add an auto-dscan option I might consider living in a WH. Not keen on spamming V all day long.
---
by the time the rorq nerf kicks in they won't have any more rorqs at this rate...
---
Hey ccp. lets not do this -.-; your changes by and large. with the wetu today. are just hurting people who arent in Goonswarm. or the bigger power blocks. do you not care about every one of your players? or just the big blocks? 
---
They said a 50% nerf to the damage multiplier, which means your numbers are probably a little off. Essentially, I think this means that for Torp HAWs and Torp HAWs alone, the 50% bonus for Kinetic and 40% bonus for other damage types will drop to 25%/20%. I can only assume this is what they meant, as unlike most guns which have an inherent damage modifier bonus, Missiles don't appear to have this attribute.
---
The best way to edit this is to go into the attribute editor in Pyfa, edit the Leviathan (fields ShipBonusTitanC1 and ShipBonusTitanC5) from 50 to 25 and 40 to 20. Then turn on overrides and create a new Leviathan fit. While the numbers aren't much better than yours, this gives us the following with DG launchers and Scourge Rage (and no damage mods):
---
* Pre-change - 2972 dps
---
* Post-change - 1910 dps. 
---
So, essentially put - yes, HAWs will from now on be kinda crap. No, I don't think turning off half your launchers simulates this change correctly.
---
I think you should learn what sarcasm is. You should be smart enough to.
---
I mean you can, but with how many battleships there are I can't imagine its time efficient compared to other options. 
---
brutix  should be  capital vasriant of talos.  8 cap turrets :D
---
Because they are shit at real pvp (subcaps)
---
Do you really think a 300 mill ship should have the same damage output of a 70 billion ship?
---
Also, i dont have battleship skills. I cant fly battleships.  I mean, I have battleship 3... because you need that for the cap skills, but why the hell should I be forced to fly a puny gnat of a ship, instead of my cap, because some 'dicks' whined enough that it is unfair that the huge valuable precious thing which takes YEARS to train into and fly be able to tickle a ship that a 10 day old alpha toon can fly. 
---
But I live to hot drop... sub caps are lame.
---
Yup, really weird this time, got kicked from certain chat channels and cant rejoin, also got DC'd and couldnt reconnect the first few tries.
---
I won't tell you I made more isk/hr running t5 sites than ratting in a supercarrier even in pre-anomaly nerf
---
Anyway, just to tell you there are way more things to do in this universe than sitting in Delve and shittalking in chat(despite shittalking is an really important aspect of the game)
---
NSA cycle time is too long with this change imo.  
---
Remove moderation
---
That doesnt mean that bombers are iverpowerd. It is a sign that all other subcaps are underpowerd. 
---
like right after dev blog post.. lmao
---
Yep +5% max
---
GevMar5MecaPreston
---
Agree, HAW just needs to be entirely removed entirely. The only things caps should apply to are other caps and structures.
---
Scan res, fuck off
---
Um the nerf for rorquals every time they got nerfed the last 2 years. 
---
Also they are just looking at the old rorqual recommended ideas discord chat. Before they turned rorquals into panicking beasts. 
---

God bless cloud services...

---
They don’t even know you can use a rorq in low sec.
---
Not all fits, right now you can go passive shield + speed, active shield, or active armor + speed. At worst this will make a couple of those strategies not work, which is honestly just going to mean tankier vnis, and maybe a slight reduction in ticks.
---
It might also mean that you can't tank a dreadnaught with a vni, but i think they patched the glitching reps method already, so there's no point in doing that anyway.
---
because more 50 IQ players like yourself have them so easily available
---
Aside from losing more drones what does this really do? The dps is still extremely high for a cruiser. 
---
Should of added a cap reduction to the Abaddon guns.
---
 Rorquals changes for some of us = +1 account. 
---
HAW change only really hurts the leviathan.
---
Insurance = a bit more srp increase to offset the cost.
---
Capital remote reps is nice to see and makes insane fax numbers less relevant and comes down to a true dps and fc calling rate.
---
The hull energizers for a super might become a thing now.
---
Everything else I am impartial to until I can sit down and play with numbers.
---
It becomes a habit...
---
I now dscan in k-space, being excited about finding 5 hulks in dscan until i realize i'm in highsec

Seems kinda pointless then. Maybe find some mods from the subreddit to put in some work so you have less to do.

in practice it will have almost no effect on the 100mn AB fits, but depending on the rat damage type it might hurt the 10mn armor fits quite a bit.
---
See my comment above XD
---
I'm just happy b/c it seems like everyone else's income is going to go down, but it doesn't look like CCP will be touching relic sites any time soon.
---
And I'll get to other things, just wanted to learn, grow and establish the funds to do so. Feel like all the options I've chosen lead to nerfs and I never make as much as I would like which makes the risk not worth it. And honestly if it wasn't for goon SRP I wouldn't pvp very much. And yes I love the shit talking, best part of the game.

I used to think that the mods of /r/wow were oppressive and authoritarian. And then i came to /r/eve

why the fuck would you join eve to fly capital ships? why the fuck do you even know what they mean in the context unless you play it already? were your parents related?

Its kinda true for most changes tho.

How come that didn’t work out for FW though

I'm not sure, but i trained them when i finished everything else.

I'm sure these words will still be true in 10 years when you have a balanced sandbox with 1000 active pilots...
---
Yea I'm terrified I might make slightly less than enough to make me rich.
---
Unfortunately, CCP's answer to capacitor issues with laser boats is that you should downgrade the crystals. Don't hold your breath on that one.
---
someone who gets it! (kinda) enjoy your downvotes from the retards!
---
If they did that, sure. 
---
And if they did it that way, it would make the battleship launchers 'worse' too, so people wouldnt fit battleship launchers on their titans... probably.
---
But that is not what they said, and it is not a 50% nerf. 
---
Please elaborate on how this hurts us, I’ll wait.
---
Boner achieved
---
It's either steal all drones and warp slower or steal some drones and warp faster. Am i missing something here? 
---
I use a rorq army with regular mining drones and just go afk. Literally nothing to lose with the insurance payout
---
Nothing wrong with not wanting to feed.
---
well.. its true tho.  wont really affect goons. but it definetly will affect the little guys. but in a positive way.
---
the little guy is finally somewhat able to harass the big guys.

these changes are gold :)

Yeah this morning, I’m down to only 198 large t2s now... gonna have slow down a bit.

dude I d-scan in other games. you trying to shoot that lifeline thats ressing her teammate? you wrong, you're melee'ing because you hit V so often it becomes a natural habit.
---
Trying to type out an important email? you have V's in every other word.
---
It is a problem and a habit I can not break.
---
People don't use a nav computer in the mids?
---
Tracking usually isn't the issue on heavy drones, it's speed and optimal range mostly. Also I doubt the sig increase will matter, battleships will miss anyhow on the 100mn version.
---
Keepstars now can dock in Titans
---
I feeeeeel
---
All this is for mining is +1 rorqual. Until exhumers exceed rorqual amounts rorqual are the best way to go.
---
If you're dropping a Capital ship on a, as you said it, Small Gang, that small gang should be decimated.  If you want to kill a super cap, you should need lots of big ships that deal lots of damage and can take a beating.  
---
Signature radius mechanic for reps. Bonus to logi for it.

How are you behind? These updates come at a glacial pace, with 1-2 year gaps

RIP HAW Titans lul
---
VNI botting / AFKing will be a bit more difficult now because they will get targetted quicker by the NPCs and take a bit more damage, but more importantly, their drones will eat shit unless there is an actual pilot recalling them in time and actually piloting to pick them up quick enough, so no circular permament orbits or you lose drones. Can't drone rat without drones.
---
Except rorqs literally CAN tank everything dropped on them, at least for the duration of the panic module, something no other ship in the game can do.
---
Brainlet spotted
---
The rorq change to wrecks its viability as a mining platform all together. For a 10b ship your making less then 2 vnis.
---
that was cool as fuck. i love ccp now
---
&gt; there's almost nothing CCP can do to nerf player choices to concentrate their numbers and in doing so, concentrate their power. 
---
Nerfing anom respawn rates is a good example of doing what there is "almost nothing" to be done towards. Increasing DR on N+1 krab/ratting rates is good for nerfing "concentrate their power" by requiring defense of larger sov areas and more organization/strategy in that defense. You should have to defend a wider umbrella the larger your income, and ideally, it should scale superlinearly.
---
This is the most underrated change in this patch. 
---
You sound like a botter.
---
Reported.
---
No Plex sales. Plex needs to be depleted, game needs less multiboxing, not more.
---
Make an appointmet with your Eye Doctor. That ship is shooting at another one (very small in front of that Asteroid).
---
So no mining in that picture.
---
Dude, I can see your post. That's way better than in-game chat at the moment.
---
Yeah, cause no one lives in [New Eden](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/New_Eden)
---
Then what would be the point of playing, what's the end game content!? Upwell stations were a joke so that's not it. What are people trying to obtain!? Bigger ships and wealth! 
---
I don't want to use my carrier to solo pvp i want to use it to make money so i can afford to whelp subcaps learning to pvp. And to use it for capital deployments to crush people who have been harassing our space.

Lol.. Delete local and all that !!

I'm guessing you didn't get far in life.

holy fuck can we double upvote?

I guess the wormholers are getting what they wanted
---
Should be reduced with this change
---
I experimented with this myself and spent about three weeks with a nav computer in the mid and tracking link in the low, and found I consistently got lower ticks than I did with tracking mods in both slots.
---
carrier isk/hr is around 150-180...
---
highsec incursions are around 150 PER ACCOUNT
---
........ use your brain
---
Exactly. 
---
CCP forced the rorq changes before even though everyone and their mother said it was OP as fuck and stupid to do. CCP being CCP seen dollar signs floating witht he changes and went ahead with it anyway. Fozzie sov was also told to be retarded and still is and that coupled with rorqs is how we have come to pass now. CCP forced everyone to huddle up where sov is concerned andhave now NERFED the rorq 3 times by actual ship/mods/drones and once by anom repsawn time. Current meta is ALL on CCP, they never listened. 
---
Current CSM claiming this is their contribution should be ashamed of it. This doesn't affect botters in the slightest, this hurts the eve player who plays for only a few hours per week and smaller groups who will just not be able to cut it now.
---
\_Triglavian HAC\_
---
Hell no
---
A 50% nerf to damage multiplier is not the same as a 50% nerf to damage, since one ignores the base damage numbers. See, Dual Giga Pulse Laser IIs get an inherent 1.26x multiplier to damage, which would presumably mean they're reducing that number to 1.13x since their wording is "**Change: Reduce damage multiplier for all High Angle Weapons by  50% and give a corresponding 100% increase to HAW damage from Siege Mode.**". This is not the same as 'Reduce Damage for all High Angle Weapons by 50%'. 
---
Rapid Torps do not receive an inherent damage multiplier, and as such I don't know how else they'd handle it.
---
if you think capitals are "end game content" you either
---
A) Only been playing eve the past 2 years
---
B) Have a very small imagination and have never flown small gang
---
End game is whatever you want it to be. Topple someones mining industry in SP, harass a lowsec group that vastly out numbers you and outsmart them at every turn (lmao whats up hullpen you retards)
---
Capitals are fucking broken and they are finally on the road to fixing them.
---
Rip snuff
---
Question:  do the fighter needs affect standup fighters?  
---
because the depot is designed to act as a dockless station for nomadic pilots.  It only sees extreme use as mining equipment because it fits the excavators.  In normal situations, they should only be full of ammo and loot that a player uses to resupply in remote locations.
---
Basically miner wetus are emergent gameplay.  The mechanic serves a totally different niche and has been co-opted by clever pilots.
---
\&gt;  Did i miss something?  
---
Yes, you should probably read patch notes.
---
Wouldn't it have been simpler to just nerf spider tanking on them instead and make all caps / supers rely more on local reps ? Would have been more balanced too cause more vulnreable to neuts. Instead they made Faxes ...
---
....
---
Yes, because that 300mil ship (realistically 800-1b ship to reach 1500 dps unheated) doesn't have millions of EHP, doesn't provide boosts, can't jump itself and can't use bursts. There is more to a Titan than the dps you see in Pyfa.
---
1500dps is still a lot to a subcap, it'll do a bit more than tickle it. Also, combining that 1500dps with your millions of EHP along with the 300-500 other titans in your blob fleet is more than any battleship fleet could muster (since it has to fit lots of tank to not get alpha'd, which reduces battleship dps).
---
No one is stopping you from flying your Titan with HAW, just accept its damage is lower now. If you want high DPS HAW ships, then fly a dread. Or put XL weapons on your titan and perform the role it was intended for, which is an anti-capital support/boosting ship.
---
Selling tin hates 
---
this has to be bait lmfao
---
No. I miss them really and the only way to open them is alt+n and alt+g .  They literally just deleted the buttons, the function is still there.    
---
Am annoyed on a daily basis and still reflex moving my mouse over to the neocom bar ever 2 minutes only to be annoyed again.
---
Damn that GSM making rorqual mining riskier.
---
Oof
---
&gt; Seems like an overall greater loss of excavator drones is the better out come. 
---
Yes if you ignore below nuances
---
- Changes will make less people lose their stuff. The dying Rorquals will die anyway, but now will lose 2 drones. But now less umbrella Rorquals will lose their stuff, so a reduction of the net amount of people taking a risk.
---
- Changes will punish the non-umbrella Rorquals with 2 extra drones, making another case to move under the umbrella. The mother of all problems of Eve is there being too many advantages of living under the umbrella space, and almost no caveats.
---
- Booshed drone numbers are only current. Might increase with more people beginning to boosh. Which means more than 210 drone steals would potentially be blocked by the nerf.
---
- I'm OK with a nerf to umbrella Rorquals indirectly being a nerf to booshers. Such as, if Rorquals had to spread around more due to an anomaly nerf, then booshing would be nerfed. But in this case non-umbrella Rorquals are being nerfed. We don't even steal from those.
---
Anything being posted in there now would probably be buried. 
---
Just bind it to a key right next to your bind for refreshing probe scanners.
---
I understood nothing yet am still wet
---
because this comes up a lot lately, what is good moderation, in your eyes? 
---
Obv not, and that's not the intent I'm sure. It's just that now, 99% of carriers just instawarp the.momwnt a neut hits local. This at least forces them to make a choice between almost 100% safety, or better ticks by fitting the nsa, but not both.
---
he's meaning to say that they were just saying that as a roundabout way of going "i'm not mad" while seething on the inside, and he's right.

---
Battleships are only really good at fighting other battleships, with all the T3's and T2 assault ships flying around. Also if you have a titan you probably have a pricey set of implants that you'd prefer not to lose
---
Even if you drop a battleship on a small gang of caracals, you'll probably still lose
---
I’m excited the abaddon got a buff. I love that ship.
---
Not going to hold my breath on it, just an observation due to using 8 guns it has the highest capacitor cost of any battleship of the game. 
---
Oh man... seriously?!
---
I used these buttons since 2007... Why in Devinity's Edge did they delete them?! WTF?!
---
&gt;I more or less know who is in the booshing business. These days about 500 to 700 drones are stolen each month (my part of it is only about 200 these days, and I am not the most active boosher).

K. Remove panic. But then allow that ship to just warp off at any time. What you want? A stationary, giant target that cant run away AND cant tank? It has to have at least some option to GTFO or hold itself till eventual help arrives. If you want idiot-proof victims, go ratting.
---
If you're not flair-baiting, that makes it even fucking better.
---
Welcome to EVE balance, the way its been for years. Battleships are countered by smaller ships. That being said, i fly battleship regularly, and they are surprisingly good at killing T3's if you know what you're doing. HACs are also easy, its mainly AF's that are your death in most cases. A good example of a cheaper, smaller ship countering a larger more expensive ship.
---
"But why does this 50m frigate counter my 1.5b battleship! CCPlz"
---
Well, having gone through the (in)famous *Summer of Rage* i can assure you they have done much worse in the past, but this is a little, yet very annoying evil that they did for no good reason i can think of.
---
wow.. this is some seriously twisted thought process.  
---
a 10 day old alpha toon, will not do 1k dps in their battleship.  
---
and a titan does not take years to skill into since the addition of skill injectors &amp; rorq mining. 
---
adapt?
---
Bombers ARE overpowered. Or how many frigs you know that reach those DPS with simple Meta-weapons combined with reasonable speed AND a cov-ops-cloak on top AND the option to do AOE-damage?
---
See. I read 1.26x being reduced by 50% to mean, the new number is 0.63x
---
1.26 to 1.13 is only a nerf of about ~10% dps, and literally no one is interpreting the change log that way. 
---
If rapid torps, however they do it, only receive a 10% dps nerf, that is not so bad, and would still be used... but again, I dont think that is the nerf they threatened us with.
---
iTs a cAPiTaL sHiP

---
Some people just play to flex with big toys, but dont actually appreciate the game.    
---
agreed, this shouldn't be nerfed
---
maybe, i'm not the one who made such a garbage post I deleted it tho.
---
Looks can be deceiving. The metal might be really thin, so it will cut anything it touches.
---
I still feel like it'd be better to have a cap resistance implant set than a shield slave set. Or better yet - an implant set that re-adds reflective capabilities to cap batteries.
---
The fact that this sort of patch elicits this kind of reaction out of the players... and yet CCP almost never does these sorts of patches even when there's enormous outcry for it... that should temper your excitement about CCP and what they can do with eve, imo.
---
For every s-tier patch they've done, they've delivered three years of "we're basically ignoring all the issues that get everyone really excited and spending our time in the agency window, shitty ingame events, and new pve instead."

Ah get fucked, fan boi

rorqs are only 1.4 bil fitted in delve bro
---
The tracking link increases optimal range too though.

Also, for armor VNIs you have to choose between between a nav computer or tracking, alternatively replace one DDA in the lows.

Rip 2 weapon systems on the leviathan. Capital cruise are the only effective weapons now.

Why my post was removed? Wtf mods
---
IN subcaps? move the fight about 50km to the left. That triage ain't gonna follow.
---
&gt;Medium Beam Laser + Harbinger buffs: I already thought the hearty harby was a sneaky viable ship but when you combine this with the ferox nerf I'm starting to smell a new meta boys. Some major bloc will be running a harbinger fleet soon (probably not us because we move at a glacial pace, but someone).
---
Only really viable with a double utility mid setup IMO, and hoping that your ~5k less eHP and slower reps can hold out v feroxes higher DPS at longer ranges. Will be crap at larger stuff. Double optimal just too strong. 
---
Armor repping a shield super to lower incoming shield triage.  
---
Interesting idea asher. 
---
Vedmak Heavy Assault Cruiser!?  
---
I have such a boner from this video  
---
Even the people who are directly effected are (mostly) satisfied because they recognize needed, well-reasoned balance changes that will improve the overall health of the game.
---
I'm currently cooking my first carrier alt and was worried about an incoming nerf, but I can't argue against the changes that were made, and it won't stop me buying one.
---
why not remove reinforcement cycles from depots?
---
Yeah, they've been pushing that bullshit line a while because any nerfs to their gameplay they're afraid of, and they need a reason to push back against it.
---
It's just like all the other bullshit they spout "if you dont want titans dropped, don't attack our space" or "Just adapt" at the end of the day goons tend to be more self absorbed than most it seems, they just really want to seem like the nice guys vause its harder to be an attractive geoup if everyone lnows youte full of shit. And they understand as well as anyone how important n+1 is.
---
And make sure to tie it to a mining pve event, like the RvB skins.

it's sad you need weeks of negativity to finally force you to make good changes to the game
---
why can't you just fucking do good things jesus christ
---
It's 200 drones living in the umbrella space saved from booshers, in return for 300 non-umbrella drones dying to killers of Rorquals.
---
I dunno how you'd possibly balance active-rep caps as the meta without it either being oppressively OP in small gang or useless in big warfare.  Regardless, triage as a mechanic existed as a carrier mechanic, and CCP chose to go that route, and it matched the playerbase's desire for "more cap deaths".

I mean, a roaming gang of assault frigs can hold down and kill a battleship. Why on earth shouldn't they he able to do the same to somethimg even bigger and more ponderous? That's one of the best things about eve, you can absolutely take out big shit with little shit through proper use of
---
sig tanking, fit etc. Why would titans be immune to that?
---
No way ratters will want to do that to mess with their navs/omnis. And rip shield fits that try to get away with both.
---
I mean its still a good change, even if there's a loophole it still requires a non-insignificant gimping of the fit to get the workaround.
---
I wouldn't call them glass cannon. Either way you will still see a lot of gila's for abyss.
---
Large Dual heavy turrets suck, it'd be nice if they tracked significantly better since they deal significantly less base damage. Why would you ever make the change if you never have higher effective dps vs small/fast targets... ccplz buff dual heavies plz

Sure, unless you're trying to kill a structure or hold a grid

If you go hyper rigged, one excavator drone is bigger than the cargo bay of any boosher. So you will end up stealing 0 drones.

Your flare is appropriate, I’ll admit I didn’t like his posts,! but banning him? Kinda makes him look correct, and that’s a terrible idea
---
Oh for sure. It's not crippling. It just does little to swing larger engagements. Mega-alliances will still drop dreads and just pay a bit more in SRP, no big deal. Smaller alliances and lone corps might have to be a bit more judicious. 
---
what problem?
---
My favorite idea for shield slaves is to bring back the passive resistances on active shield hardeners and add passive-resistance-bonus-to-active-hardeners implants.
---
The end result would be that active hardeners when turned off would still give okay resists such that hardeners would be: active-offline &lt; passive &lt; active-online.
---
Serious buffs for krab hunters.   
---
I would've liked to see some more/better counters to supercap umbrella tactics, (i.e. buffs to Cyno-inhibs), but it's certainly a good start.

I'm guessing to stop a flood of "local is ded" threads from being posted.
---
You can theoretically tank Guristas dreads in an active shield VNI (outside its neut range), but none of the other faction dreads. Active armor/shield VNIs should still be able to do so after this change. Passive shield VNIs will likely get instadunked by them now.
---
Some passive-fit VNIs will no longer be viable overall, and armor VNIs will be more appealing to get Drone Navs to compensate for the huge loss of drone speed.
---
Armor fits = fewer DDAs = lower ticks. It's a very subtle but effective nerf that goes a lot deeper than the surface appearance.
---
I was /s ... and memeing about the shape as well =P

I honestly don't care how it gets buffed into usability ... just that it does =)

---
There's already a thread up on the chat server problems. Just join the discussion there, imo.
---
The drone speed nerf can potentially reduce ticks by 40-50%, and maybe 20-30% when you compensate for the changes as it will cost you other slots. I expect armor VNIs with only one or two DDAs to be the standard in a month or two after the changes are live.

Idk. I'm not against having good PvE that pays a lot, I just want it to be risky. The NSA things forces you to choose between risk+reward or safety + worse application/damage
---
Time to resurrect goryn
---
Risk is an interesting concept. It can't be applied to everything.
---
PvE ratters should be under some minimum amount of risk because they are getting a reward, money. Risk/reward balance is inherent to the design of this game.
---
Blops fleets are not getting any monetary reward but killmails. They do not owe taking risks to you you or the game, more than any other PvP fleet. They are actually a crucial part in the imposition of risk to PvE'ers, and if PvE risk is too low, then blops should be made easier, not harder, to balance it.
---
I've legit seen battleships that fit a cargo expander to use more 3200s. That kind of uniqueness is granted by the existence of 3200s and overall they're great for battleships. Definitely something to keep. 
---
I'm reasonably confident 3200s wont be as big of an issue when these changes go live as capitals overall are going to take a big hit.
---
Exactly
---
who?
---
Stop being reasonable. There is no place for that on r/Eve
---
But this are the main forums.
---
A bit out of the loop - was there a changelist or devblog documenting the anomaly changes?
---
I agree, the smaller tier turret(s) do need to track better. The dual 425 autocannons are actually decent, as i've used them on fleet tempest and tornado with no real issues, but more tracking would be very nice.  
---
I fly the Napoc (not t1) for PvP, only because it has better grid and speed than T1. But, i fly it polarized for gang support. 800dps out to 65km with scorch or 1100dps with conflag. Lots of fun, but squishy (obviously).

As far as moderators we have a full team. The issue with r/eve lately isn't a moderator one - it's all of the people with something interesting to say or a story to tell just up and quit the game. The issue doesn't just exist here - look at all of the meta forums / media. It's all in a dead spot.
---
Was gonna say thats a lot of t2s  sir
---
I’m not trying to imply they not be able to take a titan down, I meant that a Titan should be able to take a few down with it at least.
---
Are we back to caps only game?
---
Slower and bigger. Easier to bomb I guess?
---
Why would you assume falcon did that? That's kinda weird, dude.
---
Well they are getting shield slaves and more cancerous to kill though.
---
&gt;Also I really enjoyed Olmeca tears when you did it ~~last~~ every time.
---
Ftfy 
---
The only thing i have an issue with is interceptors and small ships, when those pilots know what they're doing, its challenging. Anything larger than that, and battleship tracking/application is sufficient. Hell, i'm flying around in an arty tempest right now and getting kills with it (small gang).
---
At worst, those "good pilots" will just not engage and leave as they're faster than me, or comeback and reposition. Almost every time i've died, has not been because i got out brawled by a cruiser, its because i was outbrawled by another battleship, or i got held down by a frigate and couldn't kill it before the blob came.
---
Maybe a good null sec compromise is it shows you how many are in local, just not the names so you don't know if they are friends of hostiles.
---
I think the dude is serious.  He's thinking Delve is going to be far less safe now for him afk rat his 10 VNI's while watching filipino midget donkey poen. 
---
Depending where you are, try something new. I ve been an "on and off HS-guy" then decided "Try something new" on one return and joined a null-gang. Had some mad moves since then, dank ISK, dank losses, great as well as sad fights, ragequit several times cause of several reasons... But never felt bored :D  
---
Maybe a null-gang, a WH-group, or any other kinda group going ways you havent wandered so far might suit you.  
---
Good luck on wherever your warp-drives take you :)  
---
Just a patch note detailing that there is/was a change but never specific changes about what is changing, which anomalies are changing and how they're changing.
---
They leave it to the playerbase to find out what half the changes entail since they fired the guy doing the patch notes. (i think?)
---
I'll show you oppression.
---
Also a damavik hull with 3 beams active.
---
...so the nerf is close what it should be - removing titans altogether.

once it is locked you can't cloak but once you start locking it will cloak before you can lock it 
---
How long to break even?
---
At least this isn't a hard cap. Can you imagine getting 'deflected' notifications while repping people?
---
Perhaps group booshing will be more appealing now, since you could want to use a DST for transporting the now-massive amount of excavators
---
Well, did you kill any?
---
&gt; shadow serp sensor boosters (buy 'em now before the price spikes!) 
---
Too late
---
My main point is dreads won't be able to take advantage of this new opportunity as well
---
Not going to be able to fit all your excavators in a wetu anymore.  Depending on the final number that will make the minimum rorq kill value a lot higher, or have a scoopable pinata 
---
Because CCP Fozzie isn't funny enough to do such a thing?
---
Sounds like an improvement from: \*someone enters local\* \*I press warp\*
---
The guys have been great honestly.
---
I think it's 2 parts amusement, 1 part pity and at times a splash of frustration at how green I am with pvp/skills etc.
---
Everyone has really given me a chance (and seem to like me! &lt;3) and i think I've been doing pretty well filling in whatever limited support roles i can take.
---
That's the point and the way balance was for a fucking decade 
---
I have never seen a 300-500 titan blob fleet, let alone with haw guns.  That is not why I got my titan, and unfortunately, the tidi fest battles are so laggy they simly are not fun.
---
Nor, by the way, are titans actually used in those fleet support roles.  Which, I think is really bad. I think all large subcap fleets should be lead with a titan at the helm, providing its phenom generator bonuses, and a super carrier or two to provide burst projector effects.... Like a naval battle right? You have your battleships, your carriers, and then your screening force... not the stupid current meta of 200 subcaps of one type, a few dictors and a logi wing against 200 subcaps of one type, a few dictors, and a logi wing seeing who can out alpha eachother. 
---
What this nerf does, is tells a lone titan pilot that he should not be able to defend himself against the small gang with two or three logis, or even an actively tanked rattlesnake pair. "but you should use a dread to engage that!" sure... I am sure they will let me dock up and bring that right out to them.
---
But more than that, it says how stupid the stats are of the weapons that the titan weapons would be literally worse in every way than the battleship version of the weapon.  It already is at low titan skill levels, now it will just be that way at all skill levels.
---
But you are right, what is the point of trying to have fights with one titan, when you could just light your cyno and have a whole bunch of titans come in and just scare them off.  That's 'content' right there.  The only way we should be allowed to fight is by bringing in more dudes than the other guy. Super fun.
---
Somewhat decent changes. I don't think its really going to alter much at end of the day...but is nice to actually see an effort is being made.  
---
Titans, and Fighters still going to blap Subcaps, Rorqs still going to mine pretty much immune to death.  
---
Yeah, honestly this is one of those things where harb vs ferox you expect ferox to win but harb vs ferox vs bombers the calculus probably changes somewhat. 
---
For your second half there, if you poor fit a carrier, then if you die, then after the payouts, that carrier probably only cost you like, a bil or less. Makes them relatively cheap.
---
Bingo.
---
Find those you aren't allowed to joke about.
---
Last I checked. 
---
unlikely to be at jump cap if you have been running an  NSA for more than 10 mins or so
---
Nobody will use DST/blockade runner as it takes at least 30 seconds longer for them to scoop all drones from the grid and warp off. Will be so easy for people in umbrella guarded space (ergo natural booshing grounds) to hunt them. That's a bigger risk/steal denial compared to taking the hit at warp speed.

Well, I hope you're wrong. I don't really have the experience to confidently disagree though.

https://eve.nikr.net/jeveasset can give you a good idea of what you have in terms of assets
---
you have 2 options with regards to assets in null that you don't have access to/can't safely move:
---
1) sell it where it is to locals through contracts or similar - just put it up at ~80% http://evepraisal.com value and link it around in some busy local system, it's fairly likely you can find a local guy who will buy it off you
---
2) asset safety it all to some lowsec system where you can move it to empire to sell it. https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289365-Asset-Safety explains that a bit

(r)Eve is dying
---
Players can still reasonably sell goods at a respectable price and any business has only time as a barrier to entry. They aren't cut off from participating.
---
You and I probably can't be oil executives irl but anyone with time and dedication in eve can mine with a bunch of alts and sell compressed ore, and the Rorq changes affect the 1% just like everyone else.
---
Not really. 
---
T2 armor rep + adaptive hardener leaves you 4 DDAs, and fitting a fifth is not worth it because of stacking penalties. Mid slots are AB, battery, and either 2 nav computers or a nav and a tracking link. Both of those are more effective than an omnidirectional tracking enhancer anyway. 
---
Wealthy people don't keep their wealth in ISK, that's how you lose potential money.
---
T2 rep and a reactive hardener is going to eat shit to Angel Cartel rats, and probably Sansha too. Maybe serpentis/guristas are tankable with just that though.
---
It's been a long, long time since I was this excited for a game.
---
I think i gleaned a few things things about this:
---
1. The Triglavians are descended from the Talocan
---
2. They really hate the Drifters (or Azdaja, as they call them) and Sansha's Nation.
---
3. They're obsessed with something they call "The Flow of Virage" and seek to ensure it keeps flowing.
---
Been gone for a while now.
---
\[...\]  new life to laser platforms. \[...\]
---
What exactly did I miss here? 10% optimal range buff for the toughest, meanest medium gun that has been in place for quite some time?
---
This would fit our theory. According to logs it looks like we fixed the problem successfully, so it would be very interesting to hear, if you are still encountering this problem after today's patch.
---
Seems to me like the best option is going to be getting your cloaky hauler to grab the drones directly instead of the dessies, though it would mean having to add a few alts staged in the systems you hit regularly or jumping them around constantly like a madman
---
Correct, but the portrait pack just changes the portraits in your cache. 
---
That is also a good idea.
---
Oh man, it would be absolutely amazing. 
---
The story i've heard is that CCP absolutely hated those signs, but whoever added them to the game was let go and now nobody knows how to get rid of them because legacy code. 
---
minor tweak: fired the moderation team.
---
oh dear your risk/reward got ever so slightly modified
---
better cry about it on reddit
---
because it didn't forget about FW. It killed the moons that were throughout it. It undermined the system capture mechanic by spamming it with citadels. It buffed caps enough that they dominated the lowsec that FW is in
---
Thanks! That's the answer I was looking for, cheers.
---
It takes 30 extra seconds for a cloaky hauler to scoop everything and warp off. And then there is the fact that a cloaky hauler is a single big target rather than 5 split targets (e.g. there are many cases where you give up 1 boosher/drone to get 4 drones). People will take the warp speed hit instead of relying on blockade runners.
---
afk krabbing under a super umbrella needs to be looked at. No reason it should be a viable way to make money with little to zero risk. Also does not create content still. 
---
looks like punisher frigate
---
Its not my reward that's getting reduced. It's the umbrella Rorquals' risk that's getting reduced.
---

---
Turns out the triglavians were just a normal russian alliance and no one knew this whole time.
---
Minor tweak: Iapitans are added
---
And it only took them 3 years! Thanks CCP!
---
It's a triglavian excavator drone with raging roid rage.

offensive capital hull rep triage to nuke enemy triage of all type. 
---
Honestly, a whole new 3d model viewer updates would be amazing. It would be cool to see different animations, lighting, and backgrounds.

oh i see olmecaposting is a public service that only coincidentally lines up with whining about what increases olmeca's risk or reduces olemeca's reward, but that's just a coincidence.  no link there at all.

thank you for clarifying.

Show me a fit that doesn't give suck ass stats for a battleship

Should we let him know about fozzie sov?

I'm glad Asher made his own topic. Kind of hard to find decent analysis from the lead fc's in the main topic with people upvoting low effort posts because of our meme culture.

Now this will make the last guys besides some pubi-gankers leave. You re a happy bunny?
---
Yep! Essentially, to them the Abyss is effectively the paradise souls go to after death. Hmm...
---
I don't think that's right.
---
Read the Triglavian ship descriptions. They all heavily hint at the Triglavians being able to manipulate time within the abyss.
---
Or alternatively, maybe the abyss *is* the Vyraj and we've been punching too many holes into it.
---
Check out the public channels of corps and alliances there. That's how I got rid of my stuff. Most are happy to take it off your hands. 
---
I have a fitted Navpoc too but I've not flown it once, I just feel like it'll be blapped instantly in a roam/focused if I go to aid someone in it, and an FC is never going to go for it... it's just a 1bn isk ornament I guess haha
---
Props to you for flying yours though
---
Häh? How could you possibly notice a warp-animation on Astero? 
---
Or wait - you don't warp uncloaked, do you ...
---
&gt; Work that paint.
---
2 thin coats are better then one thick coat.
---
Right move, but for the wrong reason.
---
Also poorly timed.
---
I have previously argued about actual balance changes to Rorquals that'd nerf my yield isk/hr hard, [such as adaptive anomaly respawns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/).
---
I get it for people like you posting on balance is only meaningful when you are defending your personal interests. It's not the same way for some others. We just like to see a more balanced game. CCP saving a couple hundred Delve Excavators will not bring that about.
---
Ive tried Gilas in C4s before just for kicks. It does work but not super well
---
Until they know you use an expensive implant set and they'll make sure to bring smartbomb before your ship blows up to destroy the pod before it warps off. 
---
What about using one hyper rigged boosher and 5 cargo fit ones? Unless the cargo ones land 5 seconds behind the hyper rigged one they’ll still get booshed and everything will go normally, right?
---
OR... You could make a meaningful choice in how you fly.it. If you want more ore, sure, siege up, get massive bonuses to output but you risk getting dropped on. If you want safety, don't siege up and stay aligned. It's like this whole risk vs reward concept that eve has...
---
Yeah mutey, last week I applied 2mill SP towards my first rorq pilot :D
---
When /r/EVE picked the guys with the most upvotes to run the place, it didn't pick the right people.  A forum needs respected people, not "liked" people. To keep being liked, some mods weren't very mod-like, it got so bad you saw Gorsky weaponizing Reddit against Sion in 2016.  Mods needed to mediate clashes, not pick a side that will be "liked."
---
So how to moderate: Pick a voice, deal with problems directly and privately, and check in and nurture the good posters. Cultivate good people. that might be rules for a smaller community like TIS. Mods are the gardeners, not the sun, not the rain.
---
The reddit problem is long-standing. Whether people know it or not, the signal-to-noise ratio has been a problem, a moderators problem. People want to learn about EVE and talk to each other about what's going on out there and they want to do it with some humor and fun.

Glowing Triglavian Uniforms in-game when? CCPlease
---
just rat anyway and fit a cyno? 
---
I agree with that statement and will add to it. PVP with little or zero risk should not be viable and does not create content.
---
Yeah I've already considered it but they only specify shield and armour, usually hull is exempted from special rules (like in the AT for instance). Either way armour benefits from this more because shield reps are useful for armour a lot more than armour for shield ships. Like **A LOT** more. 
---
I think cloaks in general need an overhaul. Give them fuel or something along the lines of how leadership burst modules work. There's a lot of annoying tactics carebear cloakers use, which need to be replaced with actual fleets with humans behind them. 
---
Even with a 10mn ab as well? I run only that for tank, and the only wave I get into even half armor is the one that split damage types. 
---
But yeah, I do run guristas, so maybe that’s it

and just because u chose to poop on the apoc.

here is a quick, and totally viable lowsec kite t1 apoc.  fly it in a gang, and be the dps.

You like pulling numbers out of your ass don't you?

Exactly. That‘s why the supercapital nerf is a good first step into the right direction.
---
Ships with covert ops cloaks are in a good state though, their PvP too.
---
For me, EU - Germany it's exactly the same as any other subscription. There is no first time fee for me and I can open a "my subscriptions" page in Steam and channel them at any time. Eve support can unlink your Eve and Steam account if send in a ticket. 
---
shelby is unironically a mod here, are you sure we have to prolong this
---
Works for me.
---
Potential is def there for something cool, hope they fellow through with storyline and not just throw little tid bits of info here and there 
---
yeah i understand how shield reps benefit armor fits.
---
however, we dont know how these stacking penalties will be implemented, so capital hull reps might also exploit the system.
---
and as we dont know how this will be implemented just yet, its entirely possible that this exploit will not work at all.
---
if the stacking penalties are calculated based on how many individual reps of each size are activated on the ship, then the exploit may work.
---
but if it is calculated each tick, based on the actual amount of HP transfered, then it wont work at all; because if you rep a shield fit super with armor reps, before it is taking armor damage you will see that you transfer 0 armor hp to the target.
---
this really needs clarification, as it could be very damaging.  (although im all for supers dying more)
---
i can only assume that makes you jealous
---
I feel the opposite. A titan is a big ship meant to be in capital brawls with support. If it manages to be caught by a gang of assault frigates and doesn’t have any help it should die cause it’s focus is high damage on big targets not shooting small things like frigates. 
---
Splendid post, I broke. Like local today. :D

Is there any way to see the systems names in the map at any time? The old map had this but with the new I have to click a constellation to see the system names. I don't see the names of the nearest constellation even if I'm zoomed in and it is the nearest system.

How exactly does not being able to protect all drones in a WETU lower risk?

Buy the black glass implant, thank me later.

300 dead Rorquals per month would beg to differ.

now if only they'd let us reset all our extractors without going to each one individually.....
---
You can't really build a wall in space, it's 3 axis...
---
Probably explains why they hate Drifters and Sansha so much.
---
Drifters fuck with your body and then forcibly reanimate you with their tech after you've died. Sanshas fuck with your consciousness (or probably what the Triglavs view as your "soul") after you've been captured. Both factions severely mess with the notions of death.
---
60 attack power makes cans a joke
---
You remember my Excavator-fuck-up a few weeks ago? I fixed that by plundering my meager ingame-savings and pulling out the RL-wallet. I could have drunken beer for about 20 EUR instead if I knew that those things will be obsolete next month.  
---
I m pissy at Gozilla-level atm.
---
&gt; Or alternatively, maybe the abyss is the Vyraj and we've been punching too many holes into it.
---
That's kinda how I'm reading it too.  I don't really know where all they're going with it, but it seems to fit a bit too well for it not to be connected.  
---
Also, we've got to be careful not to be too literal with the "translations".  Flow might well not be the standard definition that we associate it with.  I suspect it's something more along the line of the Tao.
---
As a side note, I noticed last night that there are some "Netherworld Striker" SKINs that recently appeared:
---
*"Developed to celebrate the efforts of capsuleers striking into the depths of Abyssal Deadspace, when this high visibility nanocoating catches a stray beam of light it makes an impressive showing, even in the netherworld of the Triglavian Collective."*
---
I love it
---
Legion doctrine bois!
---
Nah. Prices would crash.
---
Killing defender ships is generally really easy. Have your fleet kill them first then bomb them. 
---
All this isk needs to go in somebodies wallet. Wealthy smart people don't keep their wealth in isk. 
---
It certainly feels that way sometimes. 
---
fair enough. guess we will see.
---
A Rorq is basically useless unsieged. SO there is no point bringing it if you dont siege it. Now there is the question if sieging it is worth it, and no, imo it isnt.
---
Mining AFK for hours.

Roll back to 2012, including deleting all supers and titans that hadn't been built as of May 6, 2012.

oh you poor baby, if it nerfs me, it can nerf you too...HTFU
---
We can hope
---
If it's based off actual rep numbers that will penalize ships with lower resists, basically making t2 hulls and less extenders more powerful. Also the way the article is phrased makes me think it's based off number of raw repping power. Even if they make it based off rep number it's abuseable. 
---
Way to prove him right and you wrong.  This sub sucks, just like the game and for the same reasons greedy people in charge without a clue. 
---
Little more than tricky.  You'd have to be within 2500m of two things that must be 6000m apart.

Check the numbers instead of accusing me of shit, you slack jawed cretin. New rorq post patch will be 648k m3/hr MAX. At those rates, you are making very income on par with carrier ratting that is incredibly scaleable. Gneiss is 170m an hour, crokite and ark are still 140-160, spod is at 160m, you dont approach 100m until youre mining veld
---
We can't pull in the minerals needed to build so many titans in just hulks or something. 
---
But but but what about the AT!!!!! :'D
---
If you're dropping in rep range I think you're almost always better off dropping those pilots in dreads, not faxes. 
---
&gt;Not impossible, but still some more risk.
---
I'd like to hear how you can be within 2500m of two things that must be 6000m apart.

How are you seeing a 40% reduction in drone DPS being preferable to a (max) 25% reduction in drone speed?

Dunno, we were already promised a night of summer tiericide for the rest of the modules like 2 years ago.

save the pod with that dank hg shield slaves

Dude you make the same as you do ore mining with an R8, anything above that will make you more isk/hr. Hell, even if you just crack standard ore moons, the 15% variant is pretty hefty at the end of the day.
---
I'm sorry your alliance doesnt have an R64, but seriously fuck off with that logic. You have to purposefully seek out moons that are worthless in this day and age.

Ha. Gay

I’m good with all the changes except for the Gila. It’s quite obvious that they didn’t like the fact that most people are only using one hull for their new pve sites (even though some people prefer hac’s). So instead of fixing the pve issue, they nerf the hull? The gila was perfectly fine as it was.
---
Even if you look at abyssal right now the cost to get into it vs what you get out of it, makes it not worth it to most people (just go carrier ratting). On top of the fact that if rng doesn’t like you one day and gives you a bad chain of spawns you can literally just die. You can see that there was literally no issue here, but nah nerf the gila.
---
The game should balanced around pvp not pve. 
---
it might mean that you need to run a T2 rep instead of a meta one, which slightly increases the SP requirement. that or add a single extra tank module.

What's the difference in your yield using mining drones instead of excavators?
---
Please elaborate this. I don‘t see a inherent connection if cloaks/cloaky ships and super umbrellas.
---
So I guess the Talocan BUILT heaven for themselves? And are moderately pissed about the Drifters inhabiting it, and supremely pissed about Sansha trashing the place in general. So... I guess they're gonna try and genocide both factions? 
---
Might mean we're gonna see Triglavian capitals soon, and possibly an incursion type event.

This is actually the best I could get out of it, it needs the slot 6 zainou gypsy cpu management 603 implant, and both fits just suck so bad... you may as well fly an oracle lol
---
I don’t think it’s a real problem though.
---
The only dumb thing is the fact you can cloak  while you are pointed by the structures "you shot me point"
---
I could see it happen 
---
Más que un juego, debería ser un complemento como lo es  World Of Warcraft Companion, algo que nos permita por ejemplo crear contratos, comprar en las diferentes tiendas, estar en los chat´s, por que llevar un mmorpg a un móvil debe ser una verdadera proeza.

HOLY SHIT THANKYOU CCP
---
There is literally 4 dudes who do it, that is it.
---
Even virtually AFK, you obviously have never owned a Rorqual.
---
Nerf rorq’s 
---
 Need more nerfs! 
---
They should limit the systems or longer respawn times for sites or something, this update will only make all other alliances weaker and goon stronger
---
China pets
---
Sold my rorq a week ago lmao
---
Thanks for the advice! Anything substantially different with wormholes recently?
---
I know they’ve always been VERY lucrative. 
---
No you can’t cloak until that timer expires.
---
&gt; the problem with rorquals isn't the tank 
---
&gt; while being virtually unkillable 
---
Pick one
---
Also the real issue is getting hit with all these changes. See above as to the fact that you haven't thought your argument out.
---
Just remove everything bigger than a cruiser, then we can listen to how cruisers are OP for two years and eventually become frigates online.  Sounds fun 
---
Locking bots in place. Fucking glorious
---
i stand behind you brother

Nice. Have fun!

---
reply 1 if I should ban wally or 2 if he gets to stay
---
&gt; Make it so that large orgs have to cram in to smaller spaces. Too many people competing for resources? That will cause more groups to spit off and form their own alliance. 
---
No, because that is exactly what Delve is.
---
You know this sub is shit when people fall for obvious shit posts.
---
And the pendulum swings from "grrr coalitions" to "THINK OF THE LITTLE GUY"
---
Are you sure? I have done it awhile ago and I'm sure a Corp mate whored on a structure with a scanner and cloaked the other day. I could be wrong thou. 
---
I usually keep 100-200b liquid 
---
If you run Havens then you don't need the 2 Drone Navs anyway to be honest. I've tried it today and my ticks are the same.
---
&gt;You know this sub is shit when ~~people~~ mods fall for obvious shit posts.
---
There FTFY
---
Thanks for the hint. Done.
---
Can't you just kill the drones instead of looting them? I assume you're more interested in the tears than the cash.
---
Sure but we're talking about plex 
---
As do Capsuleers, who it looked like they included as corrupted entities. Incoming Triglavian invasions maybe?
---
Cyno. Then faxes
---
Yep! And if the Drifters are the Others, then they may be suborning the Sleepers, not necessarily cooperating with them.
---
Ha. Well they said they were adding 13 pwg so
---
&gt;the problem with rorquals isn't the tank. The problem with rorquals isn't the panic module. 
---
&gt;...while being virtually unkillable is obscenely game breaking.
---
So is the tank and PANIC a problem or not? I’m getting mixed messages here.
---
Pontifex can have 1.28k m3 cargo with 5 Expanded Cargoholds. So you can still fit Hyperspatials, but sacrifice whatever you had in your extra low(s).
---
We should all just play as alpha’s. 
---
I don't mind some markets having a prohibitive barrier to entry so long as the market overall is viable for players.
---
Lmao
---
\*slow clap\* Well written.. cool story.  &lt;3 great post.  P.S. i read it in the voice of Sir Michael Caine.. the butler from Batman.
---
Most still could not be bothered to set up a supply chain 
---
I've always liked the idea of having resources in an area only last for so long, then you'd be forced to move. It would create a shit ton of conflict. 
---
RIP TIKLE
---
Sense of community is amazing - thanks for sharing.
---
The changes aren't live yet. With 900m/s wasps or 1100m/s bersekers things wiop be very different.
---
The speed loss kills them.  VNIs were already iffy for running event sites,  this is the end. 
---
Flow might refer to time. If they are descended from the Talocan who were masters of space-time, they might have some sort of interest in making sure time in the abyss and other parts of space flows correctly. Capsuleers punching holes into the abyss and Drifter and Sansha creating wormholes might fuck with that.
---
The Virage must flow!
---
Nobody cares.
---
According to some self-proclaimed experts across reddit you can not kill Rorquals, cause their tank is too OP atm.
---
I'm fairly sure the root issue is injectors. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/17843 good day indeed.
---
The might still be fine for afk ratting/botting,  but they are dead for active pve against challenging content,  and the substitute, the Gila, just died as well.
---
So yeah..  anyone want to buy 5 years of drone skills?  I won't be needing them. 
---
15+ plus... challenge accepted!
---
CCP going into hyperdrive today. At this point I'm really excited to see what they have for us at the world tour events. Could they really be able to progress two of the biggest hanging threads in eve lore (the sansha and drifter story lines not progressing for years) and bring the Triglavians to be an even more cool thing?
---
Correct. Your 1 ship should not be able to defend itself against a group of pilots. 
---
welcome to eve
---
I like it . Glad they're going to Nerf super carrier bombers against subcaps. That was super op.
---
beautiful video, thank you
---
Is the Others you refer to something from triglavian lore? I'm only familiar with the Other as the entity that was part of Jamyl Sarum, who I thought the drifters were against since they are awakened sleepers? Or do I have this wrong? Mind imparting some knowledge oh lore master?
---
Plex buff implants +3% game time with a corresponding nerf to plex. Only available from the store
---
It's a big nerf to AFK VNI ratters survivability vs solo roamers. There are a lot of nano T3Ds/Destroyers and kiting cruisers that previously would get absolutely shreked by 2.6km/s Navy Praetors with no mods that can now out-run them and frag a VNI. with 2.06km/s Praetors post-nerf. Also, it's just a generic nerf to VNI ratting ticks, also makes them take longer to recall if someone enters local and you try to scoop drones before warping off. Which is all good.   
---
I Still think the VNI will be a powerful navy cruiser for PVP. 
---
Bombers and recons are easily countered with interceptors or T3 destroyers. Blackops battleships too.
---
i spent a few minutes trying to explain why your post is dumb. 
---
Then I decided to play apex and just call you dumb. 
---
Half the health?  The drones are going to drop like flies. 
---
Lower Buffer means lower response times for your FAX. 
---
Those who want to watch netflix while ratting. Fit a passive tank, release drones and align out.
---
I have dscan bound to the side button on my mouse, makes it super easy to smash constantly with my thumb
---
You just manually cycle it at the start of each new wave. 
---
"the problem with rorquals isn't the tank"  "The problem with rorquals isn't the panic module"  
---
...
---
 "while being virtually unkillable is obscenely game breaking"  
---
Can you make up your mind?
---
That's a bold statement.
---
Can an Alpha extract Omega droneship skills?  asking for a friend..  
---
Completely agree. Making cloaking require fuel. Someone should not be able to afk cloak, you are either at the computer actively playing the game or not. Simple as that. 
---
Been saying for a year that the change for rorq mining should either be anom spawn rates OR "number of rorqs per system" So they are forced to spread out further. 
---
Positive. You can’t cloak until the 15 second timer is done.
---

---
So should we hold all balance changes until all little guys have their own personal Titan fleet?
---
Just in-case you don't want to read the youtube description.  
---
This video was a special project for a certain group and kind of a test for my new hardware.  
---
As I had never actually participated in one of these ceremonies, only seeing the map grabs and what not of the active cynos in a certain system, or across a region, the impact of actually being there was slightly staggering.  
---
Although the above video started life as a special project for a single capsuleer; the N7 soul and message coupled with eves video assets really struck me and I wanted to share it here for anyone else whose experienced loss. 
---
&gt; other then the CPU increase that they are giving it
---
They're giving it more PG.
---
Here is my best attempt at a transcript. I am still missing a couple words here and there due to static/voices talking over eachother. 
---
We are Zorya Triglav.
---
We speak for the Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle.
---
We are an emenation of the Clades of Perun, Veles, and Svarog. Hear the words of our prayer, and heed them.
---
The Ancient Domains beyond the Flow of Vyraj are lost to us. Intruders in the Ancient Domains (???) are closed.
---
Intruders seek to corrupt the Flow of Vyraj and the Domain of Triglav.
---
The Ancient Enemy Azdaja must be extirpated. 
---
The Deviant Automata must conform or be extirpated.
---
The Corrupted Narodyna must be extirpated. 
---
Human Augmented Narodyna must prove the direction of their Flow.
---
Narodyna moving through the Flow of Vyraj may be fit to enter. Narodyna without fitness will be expelled from the Flow.
---
The Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle invoke Cladistic Proving. Glorification of the fit, and mortification of the unfit (???????) of the Flow.
---
Triglav Outside the Struggle will be glorified anew. Nothing can halt the Flow of Vyraj. 
---
Well HAW dreads are actually really cool ships that are pretty fun to fly.  They aren't really oppressive because subs can counter by staying out of gun range, plus if they can bring it down in 5 minutes or less, fax cant save it.
---
This type of gameplay can be fun and engaging for both parties, and lots of content creraters like Lasker would be sad to see it go.  
---
Titans with HAWs on the other hand are a nearly unbeatable home defense platform.  They can move, they can load up on tracking mods without sacrificing survivability (fax tank), and they can take remote reps from fax.
---
That's it, I'm coming back to Eve
---
This was a great event in memory of what i know to be a dear friend of SNUFF. A great tribute Sam!
---
Change: Make cloaking devices require fuel, so people cannot afk cloak a system 24x7
---
... for non-supercap umbrella only 
---
Change: capital guns can be fitted to black ops battleships w/ 100% reduction in powergrid/cpu requirements.
---
Carrier is still viable
---
What aggro changes? If your drones get constantly attacked, go to a safe spot and eject from your ship for a minute. And launch drones as soon as first rats yellowbox you, not sooner. My drones almost never get attacked.
---
Jay and judge are cool, no worries
---
Impact font meme this shit is trash
---
You are dumb
---
This can be said about almost any change. X biggest alliance will always be a bigger advantage over the other despite the changes doesn't mean they shouldn't be done for the health of the game.
---
Armor repper VNI with drone navs; I've been using that shit for ages.
---
I'm surprised they didn't increase the cycle time too. This is an oddly moderate nerf in a time of wild swings in balance updates. 
---
No tank, no application, slow af for a frigate
---
HACmak
---
Boring bait but this game/sub unironicaly isn't dying fast enough
---
Yes. That's why battleships aren't dropped to deal with subcaps, I answered the dudes question? Lol wtf
---
when I used to rat in a carrier I was. Just set autorepeat off and you're gucci
---
okay
---
&gt; CCP nerf rorqual
---
&gt; Olmeca already crying more than average goons rorq miner 
---
I love you CCP 
---
On his back.
---
Lol rorquals totally unkillable https://zkillboard.com/ship/28352/losses/
---
TBH IDK if these changes will be good or bad but what I can say is that my group's discord is scrolling so fast I can't read it. People are excited and this is a good thing. Keep it up CCP.
---
Says the Goonswarm cronie whose entire alliance is toxic.
---
Since you posted here your killboards are a good example of how out of balance and overpowered bombers are 1 personmultiboxing a few of them can kill  lots of excavators with no risk. Also i dont think blopsing could be made any easier than it already is.
---

---
Most rorqs live in Delve so he’s not wrong 
---
Let me guess. That was the day you finished your Titan?
---
Of course there is. ECM drones will save your life. DPS drones can force a tackle to move off. 
---
Have all the tools in your toolbox. 
---
Carrier? With the spawn rate change a carrier will clear a system pretty quick so not a sustainable way to rat any more
---
Spread out to another system then.
---
Reply 4 if you think jibrish should step down as a mod
---
If your dropping on armour supers swap out capital neut on dreads for small shield remote reps 
---
Frvankly thvis is complvetely innacurvate, i lived in wormvholes for vyears and have never had a prvoblem of vthe sort
---
if you think this is bad, have you seen the price of drones, under 800m now
---
I play this game at a glacial pace at this point since I don't have time anymore to get into the politics and such.   I've been playing I guess for 5 years and I have 0 personal friends on the game. I just show up every now and then and press F1 for some killmails.
---
That's why I had the patience to literally sit in training for 2 years to sit in a fully optimized Leviathan without changing the skill queue.
---
i also have a rorq alt that stays docked up.  I might have to dust it off to make enough ISK to actually buy one I guess.
---
Watched this on phone so a little bit hard to tell, can someone clarify. After 1.00, were those triglavian drones with beams attacking moa/gila or are frigates that small?
---
A decent system will still sustain a carrier between havens, sanctums and the odd hub here and there
---
I'm guessing that doing that will net you a really nice ammount of isk in not that much time, leaving you free to engage in more explosions-related activities and escape the krab syndrom that compels people to gather large ammounts of isk just for the sake of it.
---
I'd take a guess that you can't jump while NSA active too then.
---
Krabs are just killmails waiting to happen 
---
It's a solid start though. But yeah, I'm still waiting for my FW overhaul, and might be waiting until servers close.
---
ABSO FLEET 
---
Ban me, the sub is bilge anyway more often than not.
---
People with longstanding reddit presence or other modships (like you for example) make sense but this sub has a slew of mods that are eve players first and redditors second, and we all know how eve players think eh. 
---
I'll get my coat. 
---
Yup, however this and a few other changes are thinly vieled nerfs to the rampant botting instead of being aimed at the folks who are actively ratting as they will most likely be able to cycle it down with a half decent Intel channel. 
---
simple bombing run usually takes care of most sceptors and t3ds
---
Indeed, but I do enjoy fights where my opponent(s) are also looking to kill me more than the ones where I just get a killmail from someone that's probably afk (or semi-afk).
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favour of shooting everything on sight, it's just more fun when the fight is somewhat even.
---
Maybe the Talocan built a heaven (Wormhole space) and a hell (Abyssal space) for themselves. At some point they were forced to abandon W-space and retreat to Abyssal space, maybe by the ancient sleepers who invaded to take W-space (they refer to the drifters as the enemy). They mention the things outside the "flow" are lost, perhaps abyssal space was once like wormhole space, but collapsed as the Talocan fell from power. The abyssal pockets are pockets where the flow of space-time still works, but now capsuleers and drifters are punching holes in it causing that flow to collapse. They are Drifters and Sansha are also punching holes in space-time to make wormholes and using W-space, perhaps the trigs aren't happy about their "heaven" being used like that.
---
That was a lot of tinfoil for not being able to understand half of the video. This is some good shit.
---
My drones barely made it past 1/4 shields. I think they'll be fine.
---
After losing their drone speed bonus they will be spending a lot more time moving than they were before.
---
On normal sites it wasn't too much of a problem, but it was a big problem on event sites. 
---
Implants for jiggle mechanics.
---
that actually sounds hilarious ngl
---
In practice it doesn't really matter either way. You could already copy paste a kestrel fit on to it with the addition of an ACR rig. 
---
The problem was and still is the speed which renders it unusable. 
---
Seems like such an obvious exploit that I'm almost certain the omission came in the write-up rather than the design of the mechanic. Surely?
---
The brawling VNI will still be ok but the 100mn one will be absolutely gutted without the speed bonus, you already had to rely on geckos to make it usable.
---
I say just Nerf everything to the point a day one nub in a Corvette can kill anything they bump into. No need to sub just play as a Alfa. Turn EVE into a FPS let CCP figure out how to keep the servers running without anyone paying to play. 
---
Inb4 April Fool's!! We are buffing rorquals again!
---
Although you make a couple of points I object to several so here's my piece.
---
&gt;This is my third-time posting this thread, because /r/EvE moderation won't even allow proper complaints against them anymore.
---
Completely untrue. Only last week we had a large discussion thread where Olmeca lodged his complaints about Goon bias. I suspect your first post was removed because it was an all caps rant. Personally I would have left it but each moderator to their own, I can see why it could have been removed.
---
&gt;20% OF ANY /r/EvE NEW POSTS ARE ONES I'D CONSIDER INADEQUATE... WHILE SHITPOSTS WITH POTENTIAL, THINK 2013-2018 /r/EvE, ARE BEING HEAVILY MODERATED.
---
This is complete conjecture. Moderation of post quality is mostly devised by upvotes and downvotes, as it generally should be on a website such as Reddit. There are exceptions in the case of low-effort memes, and of course automoderator removes a quantity of empty text posts etc. If we removed all posts that were "low quality" then there would be barely anything left in /new.
---
I don't know where these magic 2013-2018 shitposts are supposed to be, but they aren't in the removed queue. They simply to not exist.
---
Generally speaking, there is a lack of appetite and a deal of apathy when it comes to post quality. People just aren't doing write-ups of battles, deployments, etc with few exceptions, and the same threads about balance are repeated frequently. This isn't anything Moderators can do about and to suggest otherwise is fallacy. 
---
We regularly take suggestions and discuss them in Modmail. Only this week have I been talking with /u/joecuster with an idea he has to bring some flavour to the weekly posts. Feedback is always welcome.
---
&gt;THE CURRENT MOD-ALL POST IDEOLOGIES IS SIMPLY FOR THE NU-MODS TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE SHARKS IN THE POND OF R/EVE.
---
I don't completely agree with this but I can see why you have this idea. For those that don't know Chevis has been left in the Discord modchat and so sees conversations that happen in there on occasion. For reasons unknown it seems that every few weeks there's a suggestion of a "mod strike" or "shark week."  Personally I'm against such things, we should just actively and consistently moderate. These ideas are suggested due to a lack of consistent moderation which in turn leads to a rise of content which is banned by the subreddit rules slipping the net.
---
I have personally suggested taking on some AU TZ moderation to help with the UK early-late morning area which I don't cover. I wanted to post a form allowing people to apply for the position and offered to oversee the entire process myself, however this has been rejected with the idea that we "take on someone we know."  No-one has been taken on.
---
&gt;WE NEED A CHANGE IN MODERATION, LEST THE SUBREDDIT BE DAMNED TO DUST.
---
A change of moderation will do nothing to increase the number of quality posts. Though fresh ideas and input are very welcome.
---
Enjoy the rorqual nerfs :)
---
This does not have the CCP logo on it. Is this leaked?

---
They explained that the small reps won't influence capital mods as much.
---
"And for the same reason cruiser sized reps diminish more slowly, you won't be able to sabotage enemy fleets by flying up to rep them with small repairers. You can see this here where the first few reps used are FAX sized, then 25 small reps are used, then more FAX reps are added. The second group of FAX reps are still over 90% effective, as they would have been if the small reps were never added"
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pobbb9/spring-balance-update-incoming?origin=launcher
---
It won't make much difference honestly. The problem was always the speed. Even after the "buff" last year, a destroyer which is slower than most cruisers is not something that's fun to fly.
---
Who would reeeeeeeeee first. Olmecca or someone else. I won 50 billion isk
---
&gt;It is, but it deserves more
---
no u
---
Mods on this sub are a joke!
---
Been there, it was too scary and bright. :( 
---
Also if we're doing dank mod chat leaks, I'd just like to throw this one out there from the time Chevis quit modding:
---

---
Ok so lore reasons for the pvp gate for abyss space. Maybe soon you HAVE to pvp to get high level loot.
---
Honestly i hope everyone who posts regularly on this subreddit just dies (ingame)
---
Title says its from Hoboleaks so yes.
---
A cap reduction would have been sweet. But I’m still happy about this small boost nonetheless. The abaddon is one of my favorite looking battleships it just sucks for capacitor. Literally. 
---
Each Commander needs to more or less adhere to the official Rules and Regulations, but aside from that, they are given a good amount of flexibility in how they are allowed to run their fleets. 
---
Each FC is their own person. Everyone has different views. Some will be more 'tolerant' of offensive BS like this 'Reee' stuff, some won't.
---
Regardless of the FC's views, each fleet member is responsible for listening to the FC and following their instructions. Failure to follow instructions often equals a kick from fleet. If that person who decided to troll instead of change ship name was REALLY concerned about remaining in the fleet, they would have listened to the FC in good faith.

Don't meme the propoise its my favorite nano link ship

PAGING u/ChessurSB
---
ITS HAPPENING
---
COME BACK DAD
---
The real question is, what will you do when you run out of isk, and lose your one and only passion in this game, being a boosh.
---
Will you stop playing the game? will you go alpha and earn through lvl 3 missions.
---
would ofcourse be a joke if you start mining in a rorq or go capital to farm your isk, become that what you hate most. a number in a big well organized umbrella.
---
Are you sure this is an Onion article? This one seems spot on lol.
---
This video is basically concentrated tinfoil hattery, and it's amazing. I think you might be more right. 
---
Who runs an NSA for more than one cycle at a time? 
---
You were saying?
---
That is literally the balancing factor for it having such huge dps and EHP...
---
So, the Other as TonyG wrote it is just one example of the Others as a class; they're (usually?) read as sort of emergent intelligences that came about in the Sleeper construct. There are theories that the Drifters are possibly being used as drones by Others who've broken free of the construct. Essentially, imagine Agent Smith from the Matrix hijacking a body from a pod and going on a rampage.
---
HAHA I KEEP MAKING THE SAME JOKE ABOUT BEING AN ASSHOLE. HEY WHY ARE YOU GUYS UPSET WITH ME IS ONLY JOKE
---
Overall I’m happy by the changes. Aside from the abuse you can do armor rapping a shield super/Titan to get its shield reps dropped so you can punch through easier
---
Lowsec does not approve of this comment. 
---
&gt;What this nerf does, is tells a lone titan pilot that he should not be able to defend himself against the small gang with two or three logis, or even an actively tanked rattlesnake pair.
---
NO, he shouldn't and never should. Why should the largest ship in the game be able to shoot any thing and everything, surely it should only be able to track capitals, in the same way a battleship can't track frigates.
---
It's the lamest form of tank in practice though honestly. No micromanagement, no relevant drawbacks for the rigs, no stacking penalty. The vast majority of hulltank setups hardly benefit from someone being at the keyboard. Just activate blasters and click approach while hoping your enemy dies first.

&gt; bad you saw Gorsky weaponizing Reddit against Sion in 2016.
---
was gorski the mod doing that, or was it gorski the player who was constantly getting smeared by the cfc? the mods should still get to be participants in the community, don't you think? If you don't think they should which your gardener comment kind of implies, then communities should find mods from outside of their groups. I don't really like that idea though.
---
I find that in every sub theres a loud and whiny contingent of people bitching and moaning about how toxic or shit whatever community is. Oftentimes, its more that they just don't like whats being posted, not that what's being posted isn't relevant or funny. Then they brag about leaving, and expect everyone to miss them. Most don't. 
---
Assuming t1 rigs, reasonable cost fit maybe 8b all in, t2 core is now what t1 core was, so on good standard ore moons (not fancy moon goo) you’re looking about 120m/hr - 67 hours mining with those numbers.
---
I don't know why you would repeat things that have been [disproven](https://youtu.be/A92Ge2S8M1Y?t=89). We love new players in the New Order and encourage all of them to become a fully fledged capsuleers. In fact, James 315 just finished work on an Eve Online New Player Guide.

My worry is how this will affect sub cap logi. They focused on how it affects the capital meta. I didn't see anything about this affecting caps only, but I could have missed it. 
---
Me either, what he said literally happened for 10+ years. 
---
Haw revs to the rescue, almost
---
Only two rags ln the video? Still haven't gotten them replaced after being bbc'd?
---
How...did they jump him before he joined fleet, if he was kicked from fleet?
---
As someone cried about the other day: if you nerf the respawns too much it will affect the ADMs for smaller sov more than larger sov holders. They would have to change that part too to keep it in line. 
---
I guess I'll just have to take the Wetus out of my Rorqs and replace them with my massive tritanium-plated balls.
---
Kite apoc is legit. Have you ever used it?
---
So, the Triglavian put a huge amount of faith behind the idea of proving things worth through tests. And tests are generally, but not always, combative. Our access to the Abyss in the first place is allowed by them to test us. And the pvp arena at the end of tier 3-4, the Proving ground, is an additional test. May the strongest survive. 
---
I doubt they will lock the best stuff behind pvp. But pvp will, as it currently is, be tied for the best possible from the hardest pve reward. 
---
50%, so based on my experience (and skills), that's gonna hurt a lot. 
---
flair doesn't check out?
---
Have you ever actually flown a bomber of interceptor and gotten bombed? If so, how? And, a bombing fleet will have focused void bombs, not damage bombs. This is a non issue, cloaks are in a fine state, accept some risk is inherent and stop whining. 
---
How do you limit how many ships in a system though? I can see lots of potential headaches from trying to implement such a system
---
Have you tried fighting back or setting traps? Thats usually good counterplay....
---
Everybody would have to run locust fleets with protection for their miners, given the problem of infrastructure (that you can't warp off in).
---
However I do think that a universe-wide dynamic change, of the kind you see when you do PI, such that resources move around over time, would have been the better path to go down as far as conflict drivers are concerned.
---
Of course the downside would be whoever initially controls it becomes much stronger than those chasing it and the benefit would compound over time such that you eventually become invincible.  The "democratic" way resources are spread around Eve now allows other groups to grow doesn't it.
---
Wormholes. LUL
---
yeah he's literally went through all the memes in a single paragraph, no way this is real
---
No, your post definitely comes off as judging the entire community.
---
Carrier ratting and rorqual mining still good. 
---
I don't think so.  It takes hundreds of hours of mining to repay the cost of injecting one (+ the ship and excavators).  Only very few people would be able to pay back the cost of it, i.e. people without day jobs.
---
No idea, i mean id thought "industrial cores active per system" or even maybe per anom. 
---
Bombers make make pretty good isk both from pve and pvp.
---
It will weed out the moderately lazy.
---
The less lazy already only cycled NSA occasionally to stay above jump cap.  The truly lazy would sometimes forget to activate NSA and just pop a couple BCs while little stuff was locked. 
---
Still good change though. 
---
Rental life tbh :\\ 
---
Oh just don't bother with data sites... For a far less expensive ship, a better analyser and more ISK per hour from your explo...
---
No-one will care to help you when 120 bombers drop on your face because you were ratting with a neut in system.
---
You are gonna be dissapointet Boys, Thats for sure just a Another event with Triglavian this Time, the fancy op vedmak will only be as a visual there and you Need to mine probably a fuck Ton of ore again 
---
AFK Curse makes 5-6m ticks in forsaken hubs with medium drones.
---
Big threadnaughts like this give me hope
---
I was able to translate the characters at the beginning, i'm beyond pumped
---
&gt;!get fucked pubbie REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&lt;
---
I think you're making broad generalizations without looking at the evidence at hand. With each rorq the turnaround time gets less and less. I work a full time job and have several rorqs from minimal time investment. Almost everyone I know who has rorqs buys injectors to make more rorqs. Because they scale so well. Or they are using rorqs to buy injectors for supers/titans/fax alts etc. Things that used to take a pretty set amount of time. Now, it's a matter of how fast do you want that new toon?
---
Holy shit!!! CCP IS FUCKING KILLING IT WITH THESE NEW GRAPHICS!!!
---
Generally the people that won't read Intel and thus already be safe. 
---
I too just bought plex today, oof indeed :c
---
Yeah I agree they won't lock it. I'd just like to see the shit show that would result. 
---
I love that gif haha
---
Would probably work out cheaper too!
---
I sold a bunch of PLEX this week. Thank you for your contribution. 
---
Who cares what you think? You quit and had an embarrassing meltdown whilst doing so.
---
I gathered it's something like 95 hours to repay the cost of the Rorq + drones (assuming non-shit fit).  It's about 23 injectors, which is another 180 or more hours.  I honestly can't imagine I'd ever pay that much back just with a few hours in the evening and weekends, assuming I was minded to do that.

This... it should take stront, ozone or topes. And have an ammo count so it requires refuelling after an hour or so close to burst numbers. Wont hurt anyone but cloaky campers. Only addition change is probably a fuel bay for cov ops ships with this change there wont be the room for ammo n shit in the cargohold. Oh and something like a min reload time so you have a chance to probe someone who is actively cloaky camping.
---
Should in theory fix any and all cloaky camping issues without hurting anything else unduly 
---
I have wanted the medium beam harb to be a thing for SO LONG. 
---
Medium beams are SO COOL
---
Stupid question incoming...quit the drugs 2 months ago, slowly going mad. Looking to no life in eve to take my mind off things.
---
Spying. Newish player in Eve, dabbled for a few months here and there over the years.
---
1. Plan to make multiple accounts and join several corps at once as new/ish player, can multiple accounts do detected by API logs? 
---
2. VPN to connect to eve client, worthwhile or overkill?
---
3. Proxy when joining corp fourms, worthwhile or overkill? 
---
4. Online presence in things over than eve worth building up for email addresses to be used for multiple accounts, worthwhile or overkill?
---
5. Other resources? eg Mittani eve fanfest vid, guiding hand social, The Judge
---
Wallet warrior master race! 
---
Well if you wanted to know about anti-semitism in Chevish just look at his corp flair.
---
Got to compensate for the NSA nerf somehow right?
---
Truth: 
---
Them "why did you go to iceland?"
---
Me: "omg let me tell you about eve online"
---
They have to be completely clueless. They balance for fleets large enough that balance essentially doesnt matter outside of a few exceptions. Relying on "risk" as a balance mechanic is simply dumb. Its as if people were bitching about ECM when jams failed.
---
I can see why all this happens in secret without community input. Who the fuck could successfully argue those changes are even remotely enough?
---
Fighters still do insane damage to subcaps, sirens broken, logi broken, cynos everywhere, ACs total shit, everything injected.
---
So has anyone done the new math on dread bombs vs supercap fleets with fax support yet? 
---
Still suicide or possible to actually kill a tanked Titan under fleet level fax reps without a DD Volly?
---
Yea I can now do 1000 gun dps at 100km without needing implants.
---
I would be fine if they will just remove the ecm bonuses and Change it with a Missle/Torpedo dmg bonus +20% per Skill Level and giving it a Application bonus
---
Found myself actually almost about to upvote a WTB\_Killmarks post; but decided to play Apex and just write this reply.
---
Yes, there's only two times they are vulnerable. During a drop and right after downtime. And you need to know their approximate location, to get their tacs, to setup a trap for them.
---
And they don't take bait. So you have to catch them when they drop on a freighter or something. And they can drop on a freighter and kill it in the time it takes me to switch to a hurricane (10s session change) and undock.
---
armor hacs **armor hacs** *ARMOR HACS*
---
Just make it so you cant indycore within x km of another indycored rorq.
---
&gt; huge valuable precious thing which takes YEARS to train into
---
This has to be bait. Titans are less than 40b hull cost and injectors exist.
---
ITT stop being poor.
---
Yeah the 20 of you guys (when you add LSH) are way scarier than the 75 to 100 man NC. whaling fleets.
---
dualboxing a FAX and Dread, what an experience... Thanks for the fight boys o7
---
That would be pretty cool though. Knowing that a player died for every of whatever ship/mod or whatever they lock behind pvp would add something to them IMO.
---
Looking forward to more imminent PvP content, and this was a nice continuation to the fight at the nearby Tri astra a moment earlier - gf gf. 
---
wouldve been nice if they did something to marauders and the widow
---
I honestly cant tell if sarcastic or not.  The changes do literally nothing to the tracking situation. They dont hurt a haw titan blob at all, because it doesnt matter if you are overkilling a target by 10x or only 5x.  
---
What it does hurt is ratting titans (by a lot), and solo titans. 
---
but just for funzies, let's take your thought, and compare to the real world just a tad. 
---
A tank usually has a machine gun on the top, in addition to its main gun.  That way it doesn't have to try to use its main gun to try to shoot infantry.
---
Battleships have smaller batteries, in addition to the main batteries. That way it can put more firepower on weakly armored close ships, while still engaging other capitals.
---
Carries have point defense, in addition to its fighters...
---
but somehow, in space, in only eve online, how dare a ship have secondary armaments to take care of annoying little things. 
---
Shut up Chevis, this is literally the best update announcement in years.
---
 Cr4ster &gt; i already reported you to CCP
---
Cr4ster &gt; i cant mute you on all accounts
---
Lazy and so scared of the anime and being wrong GG 
---
HOLY SHIT BALLS BATMAN
---
Yes to flying both and i do accept and take risk. Bombers and t3c cloakies should be risky to fly as well which right now they are not. 
---
That could actually work
---
Wouldn’t that work even worse in reverse then? Since armor applies at the end, offensively shield repping an armor tank means that armor reps would never apply fully, whereas offensive armor reps would have to wait through a delay? Or they would essentially pre-broadcast primaries.
---
Also, it seems to me that there is definitely some sort of threshold between when you are offensively repping enough to reduce their tank, while not just increasing their added hp to a non-focused tank. 
---
In WTM you get invited to fleet off the waiting list. You undock and go join the rest of the fleet. He was invited and joined the fleet roster, but on his way to join the actual fleet, he was booted. This happened before he even got on comms with the rest of the fleet.
---
Really? I don't see how. The vast majority of the WTM community is not talking on comms, nor did they have anything to do with this incident. It is clear though, that management is aware of this sort of activity and they condone it. I think it would be better for everyone if that wasn't so, but it's up to them.
---
My bad, sorry!
