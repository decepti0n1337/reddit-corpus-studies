* Reduce market functionality along sec status or inverse range relative to market size. aka you can't sit in null sec market trading high sec. 
---

---
* Make high sec smaller. Like maybe .7 and up or just redo the map.
---
* Make low sec great again, it really should be small gang heaven.  Maybe FW should have an affect on high sec boundary, or something that makes low sec important to the game.
---
* Reduce out of game information like instant kill board, market info, etc.
---
* Keep reducing the button mashing and clicking required.
---
* Right click find in contracts should remember last perimeters or not auto search. I rarely *want* to search public contracts.

As much as free ships to throw into a fight sounds fun, you'll want to hold onto them for the future, cause maybe it'll get better one day and you'll want to be the one flying those hulls into the oblivion.
---
Or...one of the major alliances in the game got dumpstered by opponents who had a much larger super cap advantage, so when they managed to escape and regroup, they made it a point to push their members to krab and get wealthy, invest in supers and ensure that what happened before never happened again. 
---
You guys were a flea on a dog’s ass the entire time these guys were fighting empire wars in nullsec.
---
Good lord. I've got about that much free SP across all my accounts... That much on one character is nuts
---
Babe you're a broken record. Which is bad because if you were a broke. Clock you'd be right at least twice a day. You're talking in circles but you're just chasing your tail. You just called me a coward, why though? What am I afraid of? Losing my space pixels to an overwhelming force? That really wouldn't bother me much at all. Hell I've been more bothered by all the hot young banging my mom has got in FPS lobbies over the years than I would be occasionally losing a spaceship.
---
So back to the original point, yes. At some point you'll be on the blobby side. And when you are I want you to come back and say you're sorry and maybe we could watch Clueless or something one weekend. I'm big Silverstone fan.

Underrated comment, why is it getting down voted?
---
As usual, your overvalue your own place in this narrative.
---
Are you not the elected official and Grand Dragon of the "elite PvP" crowd? Is not your first inclination to despise the krabber? It sounds that way in your interviews.
---
Also, don't sound so surprised goons have weaponized your autism. It's emotionally intelligent to turn a negative into a positive.
---
Don't delete or give away you're stuff. Just incase you decide to come back someday. 2004 player here so sorry to see you go

Did you just compare Jesus with Olmeca? 
---
Are you brain damaged?
---
SIGH
---
Nope, POS is brand new. 
---
That TCU is back from 2014 though.
---
83 days of training and you are better skilled in a frig vs 95% of eve
---
What was B-R? Oh that massive tidi f1 lag fest that some people died in? Yes i read about that, sounded terrible.
---
They wonderful world of mission rejection 
---
So many accidents dipping below 7
---
That’s the fault of your teachers. Approach scram die. It’s perfect training for F1 fleets
---
What's the context? PvP or PvE?
---
all of mine are like that, I just have nothing left to train, really... other than shit I never use. sure I could use them and extract to sell, but that's suspiciously too much like work
---
&gt;No it means if you lose your stuff you start over. Your skill points are still there. It's not hard to start fresh with you come back. Even just running some l4 missions you can make hundreds of millions of isk in a week.
---
Dude, fuck off.
---
"It's not hard" means something for someone playing casually. It's a hard "nope". If I had to run Lvl4's, in highsec, ever again, I would not ever entertain the thought of coming back. Your example is literally the stupidest argument for playing Eve, that I've ever seen someone post. Congratulations, I guess.  
---
&gt;The fact that asset safety makes spending (weeks?) Destroying a structure gets you nothing is retarded.
---
Go away, entitled little man-child. There is no reason that you should profit from bashing stationary structures.  None. Zip. Zilch.
---
Your argument is self-serving and just simply fucking stupid.
---
&gt;Current system makes smashing structures insanely hard and nearly worthless.
---
That depends. Your myopia is obvious, since you seem to only care about ISK. I can personally kill any structure in the game, with the assets I have. The only problem would be interaction with the rest of the universe, which is kind of the point of an MMO.
---
If your vision of Eve came true, the rest of us would really quit.
---
You'll have a better time if you play the game as it lies and start forming your own opinions, instead of distracting yourself by hearing what the old timers have to say, right or wrong. 
---
Have you ever started watching a movie which seemed interesting, then stopped in the middle to read its reviews, and then lost all interest? That happened to me with Ghost in the Shell starring Scarlett Johansson. I never was able to re-suspend my disbelief.
---
The game is very old, you have a lot of veterans on here that have collected a lot of topics to be upset about over the years. The devs don't live up to a lot of this subs expectations, after a decade playing the game some of those expectations are valid. Having said all that-There's so much to explore as a new player, I'd suggest you ignore the sentiments of this sub and enjoy this fascinating game.
---
&gt; obsolescence
---
The lack of obsolescence is what allows people to duck in and out of EVE whenever they feel like it.  EVE is unique in that respect, and it's great.
---
Basically: The centralized spawn-point for rats in rock-havens cost you less travel-time with your fighters aka its less time you make no money. But if you ask me: Just the hassle to avoid gas-havens aint worth the effort, but that might be just me...
---
I really like this.  Teleporting assets was never a good idea.
---
And there's a lot of gameplay in having stuff stuck in a system.
---
How do you folks like to fly the dramiel for solo stuff?
---
If you were pointing out your side you should add to the conversation and comment what ways you think player numbers could be increased. But you're just saying "you're wrong" with no actual response behind it. It's easier to point the finger than to come up with an idea for a solution eh?
---
\&gt;Saving the entire world/galaxy or whatever is pretty hard to conceptualize, its too big.
---
It depends, on the idea, really. In Star Wars it wasn't too hard. In Starship Troopers 1 either.
---
\&gt;Their loved ones
---
Who aren't immortal and would die either way
---
\&gt;or personal values being challenged is also a threat.
---
Not really for an immortal - just work for another year or two.
---
\&gt;And capsuleers can die, by the by. They only death-clone when in their capsule, if they are out in station and are killed, it is true death. This was an element in the old lore chronicles. 
---
Is this why station walking was slashed?
---
\&gt;Many capsuleers would never leave their pods and became antisocial, strange beings.
---
Hmmm... Interesting.
---
\&gt;I think a smaller drama set around normal civilians/navy personnel dealing with sansha/guristas/blood raiders and having it be a true conflict, with perhaps them recruiting a single capsuleer in a supporting role. If the capsuleer was the primary hero it would be 82 minutes of watching a myrmidon orbit a Rock Haven, which is just about the worst tv you can imagine.
---
I can see what you are talking about. As a matter of fact, the idea that I'm thinking of is not too far off. But I shall not speak of this at the moment.
---
Fighter bombing. Rock havens all the rats spawn at same spot. Warp to haven 30ish deploy fighters bomb kill all but last wave bomb again and finish them off. Can use all 3 bombs fairly easily without moving fighters much
---
I'll still play EVE. We're not to that point yet, but if nothing changes you can bet this game will be milked by it's new shareholders until the game is little more than a pond of whales.
---
Fair nuff.  The TCU is really all that matters anyway :p
---
what was the fit tho, is the real question
---
Pando is strong man. One of Eves strongest mens.
---
Ok lets think critically. There are 2 scenarios at play here.
---
A guy quits, and all of his stuff moves into asset safety after the destruction of his citadel. 
---
Scenario 1: he has quit permenently and never returns to eve. His items will stay in asset safety forever, effectively removed from the economy.
---
Scenario 2: he eventually returns to the game after awhile away, and find his items in asset safety, pays the tax (isk sink ahoy), and gets back to creating content for everyone, giving ccp money one way or another, and contributing to a healthy playerbase at large.
---
Whats wrong with either scenario? The isk sink exists, it puts them into a lowsec citadel which is risky (if we are talking about null here), and it allows players to return happy and not need to grind c-type adaptives to get back to playing the game. If a player was to return to absolutely nothing and had to repeat the grind (liquid isk aside), I doubt there would be very many returning players at that point.
---
That narrative was exclusively pushed by big blocks. 
---
Our PvP is down substantially without blackout. We are back to camping with cloaky alts everywhere. Black ops drop is the only way to catch and kill anything in TEST space and if their FC even gets a hint of a fight you get rage ping for 25 more dudes!!! 
---
Neither they nor us have gotten a decent fight since blackout ended. We will keep trying though. 
---
CCP caved to crabs but it is up to us to adopt.
---
I'm not the only person who raised arguments against mega empires, krabbification or capitals etc. then attracted tons of flak in the Meta Show or some other medium inside the echo chamber.
---
PM me in game with your system you rat in and I will come and assist you in real time. Godbless your ticks.

I logged in my FW alt and went roaming in high-sec. If you're quick, it's not a problem.
---
o7
---
I dont think asset safety needs changing really, but for the sake of the argument that wouldnt really fix anything. It would just lead to alpha "holder" accounts to keep asset safety, not to mention people that quit would still have a few months of "risk" of losing everything after they quit, but before the "few months" kicks in. That solution doesnt work at all.
---
Cynos, triglavians being better than any other ship in theyr class,vni,almost a month of anti null pve changes,npcs fucking over players instead of players fucking with eachother (drifters in null and triglavians in high)
---
Definition of Fuckwit: /u/Gerier
---
&gt; Edit: Just saw you wrote an academic paper on Eve. Proving my last points.
---
Lol wut
---
Did you have a stroke typing that?  Holy hell it was difficult to read.
---
Shouldn't you be petitioning CCP to ban ganking and bumping?
---
It's like eating plain chicken and rice for years. Sure, it's not bad, but not the best thing you can think of to eat. And the. You start eating steak for a couple months, what a change, finally a bit of flavor in your life. Then the bills roll in, you realize steak's fuckin expensive and you won't be able to afford anything soon. So back to chicken we go, but now you marinade it in teriyaki. It's better than plain chicken, yeah. But you've had a taste of the sweet life, so the only thing that makes sense now is to stop eating completely. Maybe not the last part, idk
---
Damn i got an annoying laugh :X
---
TBH between the benefits of Chaos (blackout) and the reality of listening  to every imbecile (crab) cry on the forums endlessly and the shit posting of ideas. Give them local back, let the block players strangle their own game to death (already hearing the cries of no content again).  As soon as anything else space related comes out eve will just plummet due to its own induced boredom. 
---
Sooner its dead sooner we get eve classic , or star citizen finishes and can move on.
---
Tama
---
Have you considered a change pace with a different group? If by your flair you are indeed in Pandemic Horde, I recommend a smaller group! 
---
Here are the three I recommend:
---
1. No Vacancies (Wormhole)
---
2. United Federation of Conifers (Small nullsec entity)
---
3. [ORGNC](https://discord.gg/0kCRVItfTl2qAwf1) (Small lowsec entity)
---
Everyone knows everyone in these groups. You matter and to me that is what makes EVE special. There is no "peacetime" in these groups because fuck having a huge blue donut. Fuck the blobs. We're here to make EVE great again by fighting against the huge groups.
---
Pointless speculation if they are afraid to undock, regardless of how likely you are to be right :)
---
&gt;#they're paying us
---
By 'you' its the overall of the people that do what I said not you specifically, I honestly dont even know who you are so how would i know what you decide to do with your time. Apply your brain and read a bit more carefully the world doesnt revolve around you friend.
---
Im not sure what you mean by going in circles, ive been saying the same thing the whole time, its not my problem you are trying to convince me that blobbing is cool? I guess? As i said if thats what you need to do to make you feel better about being blue with the biggest coalition in the game then go a head.
---
Cool thanks, and what’s allowed to light the ndustrial Cyno? Only a force recon alt?
---
It’ll probably be anchored in a c1. It’ll be tough to kill when restricted to Battlecruisers and down
---
You have the point
---
I think null was newer supposed to be have so many instruments to guarantee 100% safety in the first place, and CCP missed the point when it all came together to today's eve state.
---
But now people got used to it and not ready to accept any risk at all, as for them it will always be step down
---
Sad that CCP didn't see in coming earlier, I think 2013 community could accept blackout much easier, there was enough players who would keep playing anyway.
---
I've probably only got about 150m so across 10 characters. Be a while before I'm done.
---
It’s firmly a transhuman sci-fi.
---
You’re immortal. You re-sleeve into a clone body for convenience. You inject brain-juice to become more skilled instantly.
---
I saw H-29 is in Perrigen Falls.  How did you and your corp end up there?  Did you guys drop the station egg?
---
Contract your stuff to James 315. He's one of the few people trying to maintain the old standards. Your investment will preserve your name in history and pay ship replacement for struggling gankers.

you arent wrong.
---
&gt;blackout bad for fights REEEEEEEEEEE
---
roam post blackout, interceptor hits local of one person
---
&gt;every goon within 25 jumps docks up immediately
---
What that you're queued?
---
Don't tell me, 'cause it hurts
---
that was a dank play tho
---
My failure to pick up on it was due to lack of clarity by my conversation partner ;)
---
That's exactly right you read about it.  Thank you for repeating my point.
---
I'm looking forward to hearing the spin when we see those numbers continue dropping after ending the blackout as well.
---
Definitely tell your story, in fact someone should start compiling all the capsuleers stories into a compendium.
---
I'm a 2007 player, btw. Chaun Meneam in game

In fairness sake, spvp in GW2 was a joke in day one.

Starting with the Nerf of the Hammer/GS Guards because I dumpstered some Anet thief in the Hammer Thunderdome. Yea that got fixed. &gt;:/
---
Your gameplay is actively suffocating all the content out of Eve, but okay man.
---
Meta-game badass, I guess
---
i have considered it aye.
---
currently looking at wrecking crew.  but wh is tempting as well.  
---
i'll be honest. i'm not very confident in lowsec groups. i just dont really see how they do much with npc stations all over
---
Is the PCU showing any sign of recovery?
---
If you are trying to make a decent, dramatic story its too big to conceptualize. If you are doing a putsy fantasy action movie, sure you can do a "save the galaxy" story just fine. And starship troopers was a condemnation of fascism, not really about saving the galaxy from anything. 
---
Re: loved ones, think bigger. Think immortal. They would grow fond of families, entire lineages of people, like an ant farm that you can talk to. Those can be threatened. 
---
Re: personal values- thats not what personal values means. Personal values are things like morality, justice, honor, etc. 
---
Station walking was slashed for financial and tech reasons, but I'm glad it also had the side effect of removing that particular lore problem. 
---
If you ever want to bounce ideas off a willing ear, I'd like to hear em. Eve lore is a big passion of mine and while I doubt any eve media will ever be made, its fun to dream.
---
Ccp misses alot of points unfortunately. And as long as they are willing to listen to screaming crabs to the detriment of the game I doubt I'll be here much longer. Hell I was tempted to unsub when they anounced it was coming back. But the most egregious error is not having a plan or road map.. at least seagull had a vision. Burger.. seriously feels like a meth head everyone keeps yelling at hilmar but BURGER is the idea man, hilmar is just there to say yes do it. 
---
I just wish but they stuck to their guns but but instead they gave into the screaming crab. and you know what I'm not even trying to say they shouldn't have a voice they should everyone should. But CCP needs to understand what that information actually means. Because crab screaming that they're dying to cloaky campers is nothing new why they listen this time as opposed to the last 10 years I'm not sure. Oh right cuz Mr 35 rorqs unsubbed most of them guess that's great game design too
---
NS shouldn't be safe besides having friends to fight with you. It shouldn't be any more safe than shit like wh space. Concord has no jusistiction in NS so why the fuck so they give us local in the first place?
---
 From an in lore economic stand point the consumption of he5 I think it is. Is astronomical vs even hs and ls combined. Why would Concord WANT to pay for this.. 
---
Sorry if some of this doesn't make sense im using Google's voice to talk
---
Because it's a lot easier to just mindlessly bomb the rock havens while you semi watch/listen to something ealse more entertaining.  Everyone takes place in this cycle when they first get into super/titan ratting. At first you mix max your ticks like a freak. After a bit you will memorize the wave comps and start correctly guessing the exact numbers etc. Allowing you to kill waves faster. Properly keeping the heavies safe will become second nature. And then you wake up and realize you are bored as fuck. But the income is nice. So you go mindlessly bomb rock havens and you start to forget if this is the 5th or 8th one but it's all just a blur and you are on the 3rd episode of that show you all ways meant to catch up on.
---
Yep. Been 1200-2000 players up every day this week over the comparable day last week.
---
They are actually back up about 1000 people at peak times since the roll back so far, whether that rebound continues or not is still to be seen.
---
Don't speak
---
This is why it's good for even vnis ..oh wait.. myrms? Lol 
---
Point is. It's travel time only ships great for gas Haven's is cruise/sent rattles as they don't have to move at all. But still costs you travel time for the missiles.
---
Scantums less so much smaller area to spawn way more predictable. It's almost always the next structure thing in the row. Unless you get a station scantums.. those are shitty
---
Dude, I never knew you guys were so chill about things.
---
Still not jumping sides!
---
Just proves were in the age of crabs online.
---
Why is this a surprise? We've been doing to provi legacy TCU's since 2015 or are you just out of touch.  I could do the same thing in ZT- too btw.
---
Yeah I stopped giving CCP money long ago
---
Be good to yourself. Remember the game is there for you to play on your terms. Be the best to yourself that you can be.
---
Barring that... Scam the hell out of those you don't care about.
---
Can I have your new stuff?
---
Wish I could say the same lol don't live in NS so I'm hardly effected by the ChAoS ErA yet**
---
Altho there was rumor that k162s have spawned more. But haven't noticed myself lol.

Eve Echoes.
---
I know this may be hard to understand but I will throw it out there.
---
Blackout was a test, it didn't curb the dangerous behavior of Titan ratting and scaled rorquals. It did curb subcap krabbing, including the good kind to near non-existent.
---
Cyno changes are new test, the first has ended. The question is, will it curb capital krabbing? So far it has. We shall see.
---
My only evidence of this is CCP saying blackout was a test, and them ending that test at the outset of another test.
---
No - it's not like that at all. I want those Made In Nullsec items to blow up more, both on my ship and on ratting ships. This means more danger for the producers. But it also means the mods are worth more, and Eve gets off the track of inflation. The root cause of the path is excessive safety.   
---
In short, more danger is good for industrialists too.
---
Sadly with eve it is the best approach lol
---
Good news, thank you!

---
Speaking personally I used to have 2 accounts, and I did carrier ratting as my main source of isk.  Now I have 1 account and the biggest ship I own is a battlecruiser.
---
I wouldn't say this is necessarily due to the blackout, but more due to the "chaos" in general.  I was slowly working my way towards buying a super, with the idea of using that to eventually get into a titan. But when the devs give the appearance of flailing about randomly... it makes you think "what's next?"   
---
Are supers going to lose their ability to make isk? I'm not even sure if that's a bad thing, but if the only thing I'd end up doing with the super is letting it gather dust in a keepstar waiting for a super cap ping, then I don't really see the point in having one. (when was the last time there even was a decent supercap fight?)   Same with the titan.
---
Is asset safety going away?  I'm not sure that'd be a bad thing, but if it **did** go away I don't think I'd want a 20bil+ isk ship sitting in a keepstar...
---
Eve to me isn't a "short term" game, it's a *long term* one.  Whether you are in null trying to decide to get a capital or a newbro in highsec trying to decide to train T2 drones vs T2 guns (that's a long train when you're starting out) you need to know what the devs have in mind for the future to be able to make any plans yourself.  
---
Without that your desire to plan for the future dries up, and often your desire to play along with it.
---
My opinion about the blackout was mixed, but the cyno changes *killed* carrier ratting.  Now supercap ratting is the defacto best way to rat (which is kind of messed up to be honest.)   Combined with the fact that ~~most~~ all of the fleets I see going out are subcap, (and most of them either bombers or assault frigs) I wondered- what's the point of owning a cap in the first place...    
---
Since I no longer have any capital goals, I don't really need the 2nd account so much. And now that I'm focusing on subcaps I need less isk, so I do less PvE.  I hated AFK myrm ratting, so why do it? And that 1.6 bill in my wallet goes a lot farther for the kinds of ships I use now.  All-in-all that *does* mean I'm logging in less. 
---
Now, you might say "so what", but *before* "age of chaos" I had a carrier in space often (that someone could have hunted down and killed) and now I don't.  Nowadays, CCP is getting half the income from me than they were, which they could use to ~~pay devs to improve the game~~ make more skins.  So a net loss for both the hunters and CCP.
---
Thanks for listening to my TED talk.
---
That's actually you from the future so unfortunately you are the only one, but your not alone, you have yourself..... or your other self....
---
As a hunter, I love you.  
---
And if blackout had gone on,  I'm sure I would have learned to fear your traps :)  
---
Also if blackout had gone on - your isk would have become more valuable, or at least stopped losing value a hair-raising pace.
---
There is a lot of content and backstory behind Eve.  Lots of history and plot twists.  A bountiful universe with endless possibilities....just saying.
---
&gt;started playing yesterday
---
Stay away from this subreddit. It's full of people who hate the game, but can't get over the fact that they used to play it.
---
 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University)
---
No maybe about it rorq numbers will fall and ccp will scramble to get them back this blackout revert just proves it.
---
If player counts drop aka rorq alts they will pull any change.
---
Blackout was.. ignoring how it ended... A potential huge point for eve NS. Observatories could have been added changing NS as a whole.. but no they flipped a switch and turned it back on with no planning no for thought.. just bend the knee. It's honestly sickening.
---
Yeah but why would both red and blue join one faction.
---
Good amount of spice and salt this is what I’m here for 👌
---
I'm still just amazed that CCP looked at the state of the game in 2019 and said "how to keep this train going, and maybe even improve it for the future?" and their thought was "Chaos, make the players constantly on edge"
---
Not spamming dscan while running an escalation feels so, so good.
---
if rl issues need sorting out, i'm sure you can tank a little bit of in-game damage. it may be unfair, it may be not, but eve is a continuous single shard and that takes priority over absent player problems.
---
The first thing you said was sad. The fact you're here being a douche about internet spaceships when you don't even play this shit game is really sad.
---
tbh I think that's just more wormholers rolling for content because of the changes.
---
This guy gets it....
---
The fact you care so much is what's Really sad. ☹️ Awwww....
---
I too get trigger baited on a troll post.
---
Probably should've left a POS on it then 
---
or done something when you got the notification that the POS was going up 
---
or RFd the POS in the last 24hrs
---
You chose option F, let your ihub RF and cry on reddit about it.
---
Good comment meiqur
---
That was tough too, but just fueling alliance assets like JBs and cynos is slightly more difficult when you can see very little. I had moved a lot of stuff to high sec for money making because I could basically afk make isk there because doing logistics was now incredibly time consuming to avoid losing tons of alliance fuel and isk.
---
Yup, POS is brand new. I anchored it late last night while the locals were sleeping.  
---
Care Factor was too cheap (or too broke) to keep paying the fuel cost of the POS. Soooo.... opportunistic gentleman that I am.... I placed a POS there myself.
---
Let's recap. Pussy, burthurt, son, trigger, baited, troll post. I think we've got a sweaty try hard bingo here. But you're right, it was totes a troll post you memed me so hard I'm literally triggered. Melting snowflake over here.
---
All I can say is I’m in the same boat, before the blackout I was mostly a carebear that liked to do the small fleet roams and battles, now after the blackout I just can’t bother logging in and many of the people I know are doing the same thing. It’s unfortunate as I’ve played since 2005 but I also suspect that is why I haven’t already pulled the pin during the blackout.
---
Exactly. CF  has a TCU up on that grid for the longest time then took it down. We saw it and of course had to meme. Soooo.....
---
can we not post videos of people dying on this subreddit? thanks
---
I came from a small town of about 50,000 people and I saw a car parked in a parking lot at the grocery store that have that same EVE sticker on their window. I almost wanted to wait for the owner and strike up a conversation about EVE with them. I've never met an EVE player IRL even now that I live in a "bigger" city with almost a million people.
---
The best part about all of this is that you can try them *all* out to see who you mesh with best. 
---
With regards to groups living in lowsec, the main benefit is in my opinion is the low commitment. No structures are required if you don't mess with supers and logistics, depending on where you live, are really easy.
---
This
---
true.   though it would also be easier if i had a place to store supers xD
---
don't want to sell it due to memories.  and dont got an alt to hold it
---
Because it's easier and they're not actually hostile to each other?
---
Are you still so dense?
---
He’s blue ah ba de ab ba die

Reeee I'm.mad on Reddit Reee.  😆😆😆😆😆
---
He still remembers and cherishes that one... Single... Event... Rolls it out every time he needs to "connect with the community"
---
My favorite time in Eve was flying under Gigx. Say what you want about the guy (he had failings - don't we all?), I recall more than once him saying, "we will probably all die, but fuck these guys...we will fight". And we did...sometimes the dice rolled well in those engagements, sometimes we got podded home but we fought.

Who was it?

I'll give you the few days notice. And time invested. But time invested means nothing if your not willing to stick with the changes. 
---
Yes pvpers adapted heater of course they would! It's there job to adapt.
---
But your wrong on the they can't do anything OMG you have to watch d scan.. OMG you have to move your carrier isead of stand still OMG you can't just undock and be safe watching one window?! Oh noooo my game is ruined!!! 
---
I would love for ccp to do blackout across everywhere. Come play in our wormhole hell for a c!
---
Not meaning to insult you but your wrong.. crabs left cuz they're lazy and refuse risk. Yes ccp sould have done more to keep them opposed to nothing and just buffing cloaky campers.. as that is why they left there is no real counter to cloaks.
---
TFW you realize you turned your game into farmville.
---
Yes. The guy who's channel logo is a cartoon of him wearing a cap with the CVA symbol and for whom TEST was at least three alliances ago (though after his long time in CVA) is a TEST shill. Because that makes sense.
---
There was a launcher patch in the last 2 hours. Guess who is back on the launcher.
---
Yea no doubt there. Probably right. Then again it's really hard to tell with whs as they're random to begin with.
---
It's part of the game mechanics.. 
---
I mean.. talking about it on reddit trying to acquire some kind of empathy won't work..
---
Need all NPC factions to roam space and blow shit up. Do things that represents their factions pursuits be it indy or combat. Make them a threat or make them a target, something something dynamic encounters. Maybe even some dialog out of them.

This needs at least two more emojis and a couple more edge lord tropes for you to really prove to us all how you were only pretending.

Have you tried not letting people anchor poses in your capital system that close to your tcu? Feels like there's just a few brain cells that need to be missing to be able to complain about this

why do we keep pretending like it's difficult to move your shit to hisec or liquidate a super

Didn't they get caught up in the old Dec Shield issue years ago? I seem to remember that happening.
---
Not in the PVP realm you’re not. And that’s almost 3 months. Not the 1 month that you said it would be. Keep on going ass mouth.
---
alliance or horde?
---
Nope. CCP confirmed they upped the spawn rate of K162s.
---
im too old to play eve like i used to
---
Both. Mainly Alliance, though.
---
How do you even know how many killmarks a ship has? Surely nobody just zooms and and starts a tally.
---
Thats ok we all have annoying laughs
---
I think this is just a troll thread for people to farm karma insulting Test for blueing someone else.
---
Boomer fkn Sooner
---
ah. my first toon back in 2005 was a nelf druid. went with an orc hunter tho now when classic came out cause all of my old irl friends went horde. Normal server tho so I cant camp STV or Stonetalon.
---
Nothing you guys did, either in game or outside, were significant enough to make a real impact. If anything, it was just something to joke about.  That's the point - your multi-paragraph explanation of the rise of krabbing greatly overstates your role in all that stuff.

Well you are in Test obviously. You're butthurt over what I said. So what do I have to prove. This shit proved itself 😆
---
Well, we did have skynet fighters for quite a while
---
Atreen universal check it out if you’re curious ask about their project it’s interesting and great people just interested in having a good time in a game plagued by negativity
---
i live next to that area n00b
---
Yeah but for the most part that wasn't a massive deal.
---
I usually run with anywhere between 3-7 people, the keres is quite common in smallgang tho since it can double as both ewar and tackle. I do solo or fly with a partner aswell but it's not as much a "gang" to me at that point, more of a pair.
---
I beta tested WoW, so this is all nostalgia. My first character was a Tauren Druid. Rolled an undead mage on Herod but the server was so fucking jacked full of people we got tired of it, and switched to alliance on Netherwind. Have a priest, a pally and a warlock over there now, but Priest is the main. Pally is for streaming with my kid, who is playing his first MMO.
---
I am not saying delete or change any of that. Saying ccp has too many safety nets that Indy means nothing. To that extent people arent willing to fight to indy.
---
That is quite the issue of having a super on your main account. You would have to join a group that holds a Keepstar and typically small groups do not own their own keepstar without bending the knee to someone.
---
yeah its all nostalgia, but its beginning to wear off. I have a wife and kid, job, home maintenance, and so on. cant be spending all this time on a stupid tedious video game. kinda why i just stopped caring about EVE too.
---
Yeah, if I wasn't playing it with my kid, I'd probably start waning my attention, too.
---
You can actually give the warp command while the mjd is spooling and it'll start the warp sequence after the mjd.
---
I think at that point you take hole control, put down your own citadels and start building battleships/caps
---
might be too late but you are listing up winterco members. for some reason you forgot vindictive. :-&gt; we are the strongest eu/us tz alliance and within the 3 biggest alliances within winterco and winterco actual as well. we let know the hosts of sovmaps twice already but it has not yet changed for some weird reason.
---
Asset safety
---
How about warning other people? I had no idea this was even an option!
---
It turns out that if you have retired game mechanics incorrectly, some people won't know about them 5 years later?

I downvoted you because at this point, it doesnt really matter and I figured I could get on the killmail. F to your karma, my guy.
---
It's amazing that this sub seems to think that saying "well you're in TEST" is an insult. You realize there's there's thousands of people in TEST right?
---
Vily seems like a swell chap but I'm not going to go out of my way to defend him. I went to New York once but I don't mind if you make low effort "totes a pretend troll bait post" about Jay Z.

yeah literally living my dream right there

That’s a lot more effort required than it would be if you put it literally anywhere else
---
dual prop shield buffer with scram feels like the most natural dram fit to me

engage what you can kill, disengage what you cant
---
Yeah, à couple friends joke that every nerf done to a class is because an anet employee tried to pvp/wvw and got fucked on by someone.
---
Do you actively read patch notes? The most recent one they released that has t been implemented yet has a warrior warhorn 4 skill 'charge' changed. I haven't heard a single person mention chargé being op, or even strong, but I have heard a bunch of people complaining about *bulls*chargé, being too low cooldown, immob cleanse (or ignore), high damage and stun. I'm completely convinced that anet confused the two and just totally did some random arbitrary changes thinking they were doing something productive. It's so totally and completely out of touch.

So Care Factor knew. At some point in the past 6 months, they took down the POS they had on this moon. I didn't even realize it was gone until I went over to make tacticals &amp; plan out taking it down. CF just made it that much easier by removing their POS.
---
o7 dude thanks for the content if we're ever crossed paths. If not, thanks for making eve what it is.
---
I once made a hypothetical question, what would eve look like if not for alts? I was laughed at. I don't care, it would have been a better place.

Cheers mate

---
Who would have thought when most of 0.0 is blue or has nip or deal to not harass... no reason to play.
---
Was same for me until i left my nullsec alliance and moved to a WH corp. Now I'm enjoying the game again. Living in nullsec became dehumanising in recent year or two. Instead of quitting just liquidate your assets and join another group in WH/low/NPC null or even smaller nullsec alliance currently fighting for Pure Blind or Tribute
---
It's not that difficult to implement too, or at least, shouldn't be. CCP simply needed to extend the Asset Safety lockout to \[insert whatever time appropriate\].
---
Yeah... I can see why bull's charge would get a nerf tho. Combine that with the stun damage rune and hammer spec and you effectively execute people if you land the Bull's Charge. Combine with spellbreaker to dunk on all scrubs. Ah well.
---
Are you implying this is massive?
---
Not everyone plays that way, don’t dictate my sandbox.
---
The guy will let you know, trust me. Killed a 20 Kim Loki, and he bitched in local for a while about it dying

No I'm implying no one cares until it became a mass abused exploit

But the argument here is that the 95% would drift away. How can you ever conclude such a thing? You dont know if those people were gonna come back at some point. You literally cant say anything about anything when there are so many unknowns. And I dont understand how people are so willing to accept data like that. People treat data as if its delivered by fking unicorns. Data is always riddled with assumptions, Im arguing against those, not the result of them. You can always fiddle around assumptions to get the exact answer you want to get, that cant come as a surprise?
---
It can't become a massive anything. Once the last handful of POS-located TCUs die there won't be any more.
---
You get game win De notification when one is deployed, so we'd have 24 hours to check every system for it.
---
2009 player here and the game is better now than it ever has been.
---
Don’t fly main fleet? Jump in a sig and get to know your fellow pilots?
---
Perfect field goal....until the posts got moved. 
---
Holy shit it's over a year to get all those to lvl 5. Though I dont think you need to get all of them to lvl 5 to start getting kills. Damn alpha rate sucks
---
I added at the bottom that even to get them all to 4 at alpha rates would take almost 3 months.
---
Almost every fit I see recommended for alpha clone starters (the proverbial new bros) is like 3-10 million ISK. After doing the career agent missions they can afford like.....1-3 of those fits maybe.
---
Pretty sure that NullBloc line members aren't a tiny slice. But they certainly do whine about being persecuted despite sixteen years of being catered to.
---
Did you seriously say you were trying to get people to quit playing the game?
---
From Pve prospective i have an idea i dont know if it is any good but i will say just to keep it out there:
---
So We all know that we all did are belonging to a faction when starting but it was never used in a good way, however what can happen is that when The factions like Caldari , Amar , Gallente and Minmatar fight each other i.e. like think they went to war with each other , each member of their faction  like i am gallente . I get a notification from Gallente  that we are at war and need your help , this can be an alternate to incursion but u fight with the gallente fleet and fight like caldari , the enemy can be People as well as NPC combined. This can be small skirmises like the triglavian but  gallente doing these or big out war. This can be one of the biggest war from eve Prospective.
---
Yeah I saw. I thought that was the lvl 5 one at first because all those skills are low ranks and like lvl 4 didn't usually take long. I triple checked it was so shocked. 
---
Though new characters do start with a lot of those skills at 2 or 3 and I think a few at 4. But i imagine it would still take over 2 months.
---
Make T3 Cruisers? 
---
I like going to WH space. Not sure if any WHs came to me though.
---
Lol are you using this to somehow prove your point? Let me break this down for you. 
---
15 days cutoff point for a new player? Are you fking joking with me? In this game? You dont have shit to gank within those days. You cant even sit in a barge can you within that time can you? You cant haul expensive shit can you?
---
The very assumption that people who get ganked stay because they are ganked is equally stupid. 
---
And none of this is even means anything. I can literally write anything I want on a PP and present it, does it mean its true? The underlying data, the assumptions make or break science, not your presentation of it.
---
Dont fking call this shit "facts". You clearly dont understand that word. Something like this requires a much large cutoff point, like 3 months. And it requires surveys.
---
Well People Never leave eve they just go on a Break , so hope to see you soon, Plus if ur that bored in null just leave null , goto wh or Low sec both quite active in their own way.
---
Ye small gangs are sooo different. They are these amazing fking unicorns that make the game better purely by existing. Get real dude. 
---
And hey, if small gangs would actually be worth as much as youre trying to put it, why dont more join? Is it because they are the ugly people of Eve who never even try to make themselves look good yet just sit there and bitch that everyone is so superficial? Fking fix your shit so more people want to come to you.
---
Ahh good brother. Considering how many we have lost these past months I would hate to lose more. Especially the charming ones like yourself:)
---
meh try harder
---
I don't think that has any significant relationship to using his credit card. Anyways, the war down there is probably the most interesting thing happening in the game right now, when Legacy has blued itself with most of the game.
---
&gt;   though it would also be easier if i had a place to store supers xD
---
Asset safety?
---
And when the coalition setup gets unfucked such that there's actually a fun time to use them, you can pull them out of asset safety.
---
Oh my. Perhaps you need a nap?
---
Sleepers have defacto 2 cap pools. One that is infinite and one you can nos/neut. The finite pool can be totally drained and the sleepers will still be fully combat capable.
---
Cheap.
---
Listen dude, you can take this whatever way you want. But I knew the writing was on the wall for FRT when 2 fights after eachother we got blobbed, atleast 2:1. That was a signal to goons to actively engage in the war because now their enemy had turned up to the fight. You cant bitch after the fact cause goons show up now for timers, not any more than you can complain about mangos fighting offensively after starting a war with them. Or is that somehow our fault aswell?
---
The whole idea was sickening.  It was a desperate attempt just do anything with zero forethought.  They could have done observatories when they announced blackout.  Nope just a bs chat channel garbage move.
---
So you agree then, you’re just talking out of your ass instead of actually contributing anything?
---
That’s all you come back with?
---
You will be back in 6 months.
---
&gt;i'll be honest. i'm not very confident in lowsec groups. i just dont really see how they do much with npc stations all over.  like FW sure..but outside of that...idk
---
That's Fweddit. Sure, they're based in Villasen, a system in Black Rise (I have no idea what they do with their two systems of sov, but they have those), but my interactions with them have mostly involved them taking wormholes to somewhere else and fighting whoever the local NullSec people are.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd say to cut out the middleman and live in a wormhole, though. If you want to fight stuff in wormholes, a C5 corp is what you should be looking at (although I don't know how many alts you have, most require you to have at minimum an alt with scanning skills on a separate account, preferably more on separate accounts for use in fights). If you want to fight stuff in K-Space, a lot of the elite PVP types have moved into C2 wormholes with Null and C5 statics (killing stuff out of the Null end, krabbing with Leshaks and Nestors in the C5 anomalies). This includes WAFFLES and Tuskers, among other examples.
---
But don't knock LowSec. It's a great place. I cut my PVP teeth there and it's a great place for small gang stuff.
---
U/ccp_falcon  can you give us some hints??
---
Sorry that as a 38k player alliance you cant beat a 18k player alliance without the help of a 45k player alliance. Lmao Tapi victim complex in action.

Theres not point man. We are the worst, its been decided. Never mind we fought 2 fights heavily outnumbered before goons got involved which actually was the starting point of goons being involved in any real way. Nevermind that their friends couldnt keep up their deployments and thats somehow our fault. And nevermind they started a war with mangos, thats our fault aswell.
---
And also, never mind we are fighting in their tz in which they outnumber us in all relevant ways, in their fking staging. And its our fault they cant muster a response. But the 60 man goon jackdaw fleet surely tipped the scales. Fking lol.
---
i have considered asset saftey.  problem is figuring out what station it would end up in...i mean TKE......i got a capital ship cold storage in Akora.   wish i could asset saftey it to there
---
Not even the goon super cap fleet could save it. We have to sleep sometime. Noone is going to volunteer for round the clock duty to guard the fucking thing.
---
I mean I like no local.. it's the lack of follow through that's sickening. Ccp is desperate at this point they have no bloody idea why eve is stagnant NVM how to fix it. We screamed at them citidels would be a problem.. fucking guess what.. they're a problem.. ccp would rather plug their ears and be a 5 yo. Lalalalalalala I can't hearrrr youuuuuu, than actually fix anything.
---
&gt;  fast frigates/destroyers **scramming** around me
---
highlighted part doesn't imply warpable distances  
---
careful on the sarcasm
---
Na sorry that SOV is timetanked so our 38k means shit when you had superiour numbers in the relevant timezone but couldnt manage. Whos playing the victim card here bro? Fking blaming the losses on 60 man goon jackdaw fleets. "oooh look they are batphoning". Fking lol dude.
---
Youve made tons of mistakes in this war. One was involving Panfam, secondly starting a war with Mangos. You dug your own graves, but sure blame it on us. Dont question your leadership by no means, blame the 60 man goon jackdaw fleets. Yet again, fking lol.
---
The screeching was coming from the WH'ers who wanted easy risk free ganks when the go null roaming.
---
#Local4Wormholes
---
That’s how all NPCs work right? Like they have a cap pool, but it doesn’t actually do anything.
---
Sure
---
No, the fun Null roams are when a subcapital response fleet shows up.
---
That’s exactly what I’m sayin too.  Blackout (like it or not) was a desperate attempt to just do something and wasn’t thought through or iterated or given any real chance.  It was extremely lazy just to copy the conditions of wormholes into NS.
---
# IHUB UPGRADES FOR WORMHOLES
---
I mean, the blackout was just a test. Still, it wasnt a reversal. People just hoped for it.
---
I more or less stopped playing right before blackout, and came back to experience ~2 or so weeks of it.
---
Mainly as I just wanted a small break to not burn out. But I was also annoyed by sinking a lot of ISK into something for iskmaking that all of a sudden became extremely shitty with the removal of local.  Then after fixing that by investing even more ISK the cyno changes were announced, which also makes that secondary investment way less good. RIP wallet.
---
Change can be good but coming out with bigger changes like these over time could quickly become extremely annoying. Like it did to me.
---

AP?

I would never argue otherwise because that's exactly what it is.

it's sad to see.. honestly seagull leaving was a nail in CCPs coffen. She at least has vision.. burger.. burger feels like a meth head.. oh this is a good idea. Oh this is a good idea! No burger fucking none of them are. Even invasion was trash tier.. yay new ships that's it.. and they could have done it without a new zone.. just use t3 parts but oh no we need more stuff! But it's instance based and has no fucking place in eve online.. but sure burger we'll do it. Why the fuck not..
---
or Delete your stuff so you don't make the same mistake twice
---
or it gets the Boson
---
Asset saftey is broken AF wtf are you talking about? it's why the super cap proliferation is so bad.. (or one of the reasons) there is almost no risk at losing an asset ever.. you just get a small tax.. provided your a dumb ass and don't move your stuff  out of a cit through all 3 timers.. destroyed citadels with 3 timers should be jet cans in space.. it's not 'ok' I say add in asset safety to accounts that are unsubbed more than 3 months. then do a one time move of all assets to random empire system
---
Shit I'll take some isk. Would make my day Demetrius Olante
---
Eve is dead.. both your arguements might of been relevant pre ccp losing their minds with the nerf bat.. It went.. 'lets get hard again' .. (over half the null bears leave game) .. then corporate notices metrics falling, Tells them to unfuck it. The remove it.. now all the pvpers are leaving too .. the return players you get will be mostly if not all bots.
---
I'm pretty sure that it's mostly the same people. They don't play the game, just want to complain because they like complaining.
---
if they join opposite sides they cant fight in highsec* because of the ~~fun~~ faction police
---
*: except for derelik, khanid and concord constellation in genesis  
---
sorry my bases are in an infinite days long reinforcement timer
---
The elite pvper and the risk free ganker is categorically hated on the meta show or other mediums. There were many other fodder personalities and boogimans. I just used myself as an example to illustrate the point. Ofc in the grand scheme of things I am not that relevant.
---
Gosh can you try harder to be malicious lol.
---
Most def. Me personally its the habit aspect. I was in an Eve flow before all of this and now Im trying to get back into it but its hard. Especially since the age of chaos still is in effect. Should I adapt or are they gonna break something tomorrow which means more adaption? Cause adaption costs energy, and I know I dont have enough time, energy or patience to continuously adapt in a game Im just turning on to leave irl adaption.
---
Where?

"You want Eve as an asset acquisition game, basically a version of Farmville, and think many people enjoy that game and I'm trying to make them quit."
---
Oh that was supposed to be "you think I am trying to make people quit"
---
My problem is I got burned out by the industrial strength sodium spewed everywhere during the blackout.
---
&gt; Are you not the elected official and Grand Dragon of the "elite PvP" crowd? Is not your first inclination to despise the krabber?
---
ok but why did you just prove his initial point
---
The watch never ends until you lay down for the final rest.  I'll see you around in a few years time.
---
Im so confused what you are even talking about, im not even in Frat lmao.
---
&gt;60 man jackdaw fleet
---
Yikes i guess we are ignoring the majority of the times where goons brought 200 man fleets of mostly eagles. 
---
Its wild how defensive the Tapi hive mind get when they realize that they will never be able to stand on their own two feet without bluing as many people as they can.
---
The Tapi victim complex wont let them see otherwise lmao
---
What are you referring to?  Blackout?  The lift is already old news
---
&gt;My gametime ends in 23days and I will leave my char in system called H-29TM,
---
If and when i finally quit the game, like legit for ever.  I'm going to leave chester in a damnation in my old c5 home for the same reason.
---
Praise bob.
---
Wow are there variations in fleet size and comp? Im amazed. But yesterday it was a 60 man jack fleet. Why didnt FRT fight? 
---
That might be. But its equally funny to see people shittalk all the time because they are losing. Its always the same BS that gets thrown around, no matter the side. Like everybody follows bushido shit but in the end all are the same crap, if they could they most def would.
---
Wasn't being sarcastic was being goofy.  I get what you mean though.
---
Maybe somewhere in the middle would be nice but to bad CCP will take another 3 months to do anything else.
---
It wasn't definitive that it had an end date, they said it *may* end. In that sense, it was a reversal.
---
[removed]
---
Its even more funny to see how Tapi hasnt been able to do anything on their own since fountain, the victim complex has been deeply rooted into Tapi culture since then.
---
Im sure once Tapi blues the rest of the game they will finally feel safe.
---
&gt;don't dictate my part of the ~~sand~~ cement box

1 pos per moon, and afaik only 1 slot per pos

Actually don't even need to build battleships- can just dst them in and assemble.

What about an event with 20 WH per system.
---
Because it doesn't fit their narrative.
---
I look on it!
---
People cried too much so they're shelving it, and soon people will start crying there's no risk and null is stagnant. Repeat.
---
This, but PH is better imo
---
Existing TCUs were grandfathered in by CCP intentionally, so it's just entirely the fault of the TCU owners that they were too braindead to keep a defensive stick on the grid...

Difference is that \~2 years after nano nerf you came back to Eve that was in its golden years...
---
What is asset safety?
---
&gt;Everyone universally hates the sov system.
---
They do until it actually changes, at which point everyone is mad again because it changed
---
&gt;  This is a pill EVE should have swallowed years ago
---
If that you mean decades ago because EVE always had some kind of asset safety (dont even try and argue that anyone lived out of pos's outside of niche cases)
---
whbtw
---
&gt;people that want their playstyle enforced no matter the cost to the game's health.
---
&gt;people who want the game to succeede
---
pick one and only one.
---
so, turn everywhere in to a drifter hole?
---
The hull is cheap, a somewhat half decent fit not so much. And as a completely new player you are making peanuts. If you dont inject or Run with a big organized group it takes weeks before someone is ready and dont even start with the basic skills someone needs to enjoy PvP
---
All abilities of non-diamond rats are completely independent of capacitor.
---
"We are starting to have trouble with split DPS"
---
lol yes. you can't even follow simple command "Put ECM to random Muninn"
---
no, old npcs are coded really weirdly. neuts make it take longer between rep cycles etc (or so the rumour goes) but you can't cap them out as they don't have a cap pool. (or it's like 1 and it instantly refils sort of thing)
---
Sad to say, I am in the same boat as you =/
---
I know if you use a ship scan it displays their cap level and it seems like a normal ships cap level
---
I, too, am glad we can add omega time from the Launcher.
---
Maybe two years from now it'll hit another golden age
---
I haven't used one yet, but I assume there's a list of allowed ship classes in the attributes. My  best guess would be T1 and T2 haulers
---
Changing something and changing it back could be considered chaos
---
Lol
---
This I reckon
---

---
You mean diamond NPCs actually have modules and cap?
---
Mechanics that keep the economy going strong are good for the sandbox. 
---
You have to choose if you want the game to be still alive in 10 years or do you want it to die because of your (and players like you) selfishness.
---
I just want to spend &lt;1 hour at a time shooting rats so I have isk to buy pvp ships. Preferably without some "tell me I'm elite, mom" risk-averse coward who only seeks out targets he knows he can beat trying to cause me to operate at a net loss. I haven't gone ratting in over a year, partially due to *your behavior specifically* which discourages people from playing the game at all.
---
I've managed to keep playing because of plex sales and alliance SRP, without which I would have walked away a long time ago. I did just recently unsubscribe three of my five omega accounts, and moving forward the two I've kept active will be flying cheap-ish ships that I can get full SRP on, and I doubt I'll ever buy plex again. You are actively driving people away from this game that you claim to love, you're a hypocrite who's killing this game.
---
Well, yeah? That's a thing that happens too.
---
Youre definitely not the only one, lol.

Cancer.

I dont understant it either i was running ring sanctums in the hopes of titan spawns
---
For every ISK you give away, we double the ISK and give it ba.... oh wait, thats not how it should work ....
---
&gt;Maybe two years from now it'll hit another golden age
---
Heh
---
Subhuman trash
---
This will get removed btw cus the mods are dicks
---
You literally just took a screenshot of the launcher all of us have, quality content
---
Why do people act as if groups act with one single hive-mind? I remember the arguments about local in null, it *really* wasn't a unanimously praised decision despite what some of us here *{gestures to the board}* might believe.
---
1 less TAPI member is a positive direction for the game
---
&gt;I haven’t really seen any organized new guy WH programs pop up.
---
You mentioned E-Uni earlier. E-Uni has had one of those for a while (although the EUTZ part tends to be more veterans in there) open to basically anyone who has been in the corp for a week and can fly a cloaky scanning ship and a navy frigate. The main issue with recruitment being that people don't want to leave their friends in HighSec.
---
Unsure. I _think_ they do, but I can't be certain.
---
I know a few people in TGRAD because of E-Uni. Seems like good people. If I felt like joining a big coalition, it would likely be TGRAD for that reason, but big coalition stuff seems like less of my thing than some of the other activities in the game (and I've heard that INIT. is heavily EUTZ and I'm typically late USTZ, so there might be issues with that).
---
What does INIT. fly besides Stuka? I've mostly encountered the guys running the Oulley/Orvolle gatecamp in Placid, so I know about that composition. I've just never really encountered INIT. elsewhere except when passing through your sov for some sort of roam (generally passing through to fight the people of Pure Blind or something).
---
People that want a healthy and balanced game 
---
People that want to farm isk safely 
---
Pick one and only one
---
A man can dream...
---
It wouldn't have to be restricted to only structures you have access to. Firesale contracts are nice.
---
The blackout did not destroy 15boxing rorquals, it destroyed the small guy subcap ratting.
---
Covops gankers are more risk averse than literally everyone on a wow pvp server, so wow may not be your best example.
---
1 less TAPI player is a good thingfor the game, you will not be missed
---
Old style rats were given capacitors when they rebalanced nosferatu modules to not take cap unless your cap was lower than the target. Each rat was given a large capacitor for the size of the ship but it was given very low recharge rate. 
---
As a result you can nos rats just fine as long as they are the same size or larger than your ship. But once its dry its dry. And the rats don't care about what their cap level is.

I really didn't wanna do that. I also didn't really go in how colour theory plays into the whole thing...even though green and yellow are not complementary colours, they are close on the "analogue" scale. And many many more things.
---
Going to school in College Station is why I took a break from eve 2004 to 2009.. good times!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b5X69vREAg
---
&gt; The amount of people playing this game began reducing way before blackout. And tons of people left the game due to the krabbification.
---
Any real data of that? or its again just in your asumption? becuse if thats the case i know that many people left the game also becuse of the "elite pvprs" was only killing small guys and they left for good.
---
---- Cheaper stuff doesn't mean better game. Proliferation is actually oppressive to tons of playstyles and eve balance is actually depending on some assets being expensive. Cheap stuff fucking broke the game. A titan costs almost 10 times less in PLEX compared to 2011. That's terrible.
---
Cheaper stuff it makes a better game, it means more people will play with theyr toys cheap or not and will make more content...,  and as for titans, what did you belive will hapend after so many years? that would be less? lool.
---
---- You want Eve as an asset acquisition game, basically a version of Farmville, and think many people enjoy that game and you think I'm trying to make them quit. You gotta face the fact that Eve as Farmville has 2-4 years lifespan even for a dedicated individual krabber. That's the time it takes for the dude to get into all accounts and assets he wants. From that point, when he doesn't have anything to do with the assets, he quits. And krabbification does cause him having nothing to do due to the dependence to overblobbing. And the other playstyles quit due to either effects of krabbification across Eve space, or macroeconomic effects like Plex inflation.
---
Again you doing asumptions and not showing any real data for make that point truh....
---
----  That's how you get organic stagnation 4 years straight. That's the horrible track that CCP is trying to take Eve out of, and it requires some of the Krabs doing less krabbing and doing more other things. It requires a reempowerment of other playstyles than krabbing. And it will cause some people who have nothing else than safe krab in this game to quit. CCP shouldn't overdo it and upset all krabs. But they have to change the games path. So I'm sorry if you liked the krabbification and didn't have sufficient command over the Eve ecosystem to see how it's harmful, but it's been killing the game and needs to be balanced.
---
And that balance you suport like the blackout "Aka your play style" its balance?...   lool
---
Funny that you belive the krabs are the ones  killing the game  when its people like you that are sinking this game...
---
As an outsider its sad whats happening to Winter Co and FRT. Goon cock loving Vily couldn't allow a non-Imperial-Legacy aligned group to thrive even 2-3 regions away from their home, better to blob them on every single important timer with Goon help.
---
WhY iS nUlLsEc StAgNaNt  
---
These people do not want the game to be fun and enjoyable for the average person, they just want it to be farmville in space so they can RMT their alliance wallet as much as possible
---
I didn't push to keep blackout.
---
You sure about that?  - It has been very quiet in the AU tz this week.
---
The guy is an idiot with big imagination.
---
&gt; As an outsider

---
Non diamond rats have 2 cap pools. The one they actually use is infinite. The one you neut/nos from is regular sized. However, each tick a rat has a chance to rep itself, if they are being neuted or nosed then that chance is lowered. So, nos/neuts do effect rats, but not in the way they do player ships.
---
Sorry, 
---
 I had assumed you were making a criticism when you called it a:
---
"fascism glorifying-masterpiece"
---
I guess i'd also admit i'm wrong about it not 'glorifying fascism'  because the director said himself:
---
" If I tell the world that a right-wing, fascist way of doing things doesn't work, no one will listen to me. So I'm going to make a perfect fascist world: everyone is beautiful, everything is shiny, everything has big guns and fancy ships, but it's only good for killing fucking Bugs! "
---
So, he is openly glorifying fascism satirically.  I thought it was implicit therefore that the end goal of his glorification is infact criticism.  So, i was rebutting you assuming you were stating it was glorification for it's own purpose.
---
Whereas he's obviously mockingly glorify something and therefore not really 'championing' it's virtues. 
---
But, in my defence,  It's not too much of a stretch considering the reviews the film got,  subtext is lost on a lot of people.
---
Incase i am giving you too much benefit of the doubt and you're still unsure as to what i'm saying... You don't need to take my opinion, or the directors word on what he intended... There are many examples of it laced throughout the movie. 
---
Look at what happens to all the 'human characters'  by the end of the film...  
---
At the start of the film, it's subtle.. You see all of the previous generation of (teachers)  are disfigured war veterans saying how its great to be in service to the state.
---
The protagonists are young, naive blank slates with uncertain views.
---
At the end, they're standing around frothing and screaming about how they're 'victorious' and  can 'beat the bugs' -- although on surface level (action movie) viewing it's a 'happy ending'.
---
But the subtext is, all the 'human' characters are dead, you've got a pair of vapid drones and a nazi scientist cheering and a bunch of fresh-faced recruits (what rico and carman were at the start of the film)  going into the meat grinder to be churned up by the society as rico mindlessly screams the slogan of his now-dead teacher:
---
"CMON YOU APES YOU WANNA LIVE FUHREVER"
---
\- intentionally spelling.
---
My descriptions hardly do it justice, if you want a much better breakdown i'd look up 'Red letter media', they've done a much better breakdown of why it's great satire.
---
Currently, I run 2x 34” curved Alienware monitors and 2x Asus 27” monitors all at 1440p on a single 1080gtx. Graphics are max besides antialiasing, and all accounts set to “interval one.” No issues.
---
What if all of them come half scanned so you can get it in 1 pass?
---
You never really quit eve.  You just go AFK.

Good luck, and may all the gares along your route be green.

Soo..

Reddit told me.. 
---
No offense and only krab is bad...
---
Using a super to defend space is bad..

If Test aint taking any ihubs or anything its meaningless and bad..
---
If test takes the space its stagnant and bad...
---
...
---
Reddit is such a great place &lt;3
---
No one fights ganks because they only come in ships that dodge fights.
---
Maby if they dident constantly agress legacy coalition like when they allowed skillurself and scurge. to stage from their space, and their structures, to go and attack immensea and tenerifis. Not to mention the constant breaches of the terms of their nip/peace agreements from the last war. 
---
To be fair i have quite a lot of respect for winterco members but just not for their leadership being the worst backstabbing cunts i met in a while...  well i would have if it was'nt because they freely and gladly let botting go on in the extreme around them, most other half decent groups atleast try to shut down botting. But hey atleast it have been a fun war.

I've read this to the tune of *Gwynn, Lord of Cinder* still lingering in my mind. Needless to say, reading this went well.

blackout didnt change the fact that eve sucks and it takes some people 10 years to figure it out. only now that they had what seemed like only a wild fantasy come true, they have no choice but to face the truth

The life of a goon.

The irony of a wormholer saying that

You forgot button 3 "Develop other areas of space, the null bears whine regardless"
---
Gonna call bull on that. My vargur was unable to drain cap from rats. Bug reported it, and was told it was working as intended.
---
What events are these from? The recent skilling spree event with the two bouts of login bonuses and the daily ratting bonus aren't expiring yet right?
---
People want the big blocs to fight.
---
Then whine when they ping a fleet?
---
Have a word with yourself, then let is know which of the 2 you actually want.
---
Please sir can I have some more     
---
^(rather this than more blackout posts)
---
Eve for null players was addicting. Ccp turned off local which unbalanced null in favor of hunters. So now that guy grabbing to be able to PLEX his accounts is in a place where loses make that much harder, so we adapts by downscaling, moving or quiting.
---
 This had some short term good effects but accidentally freed many null players from their eve online addictions. Long term this is bad because the people out ratting, mining and running Nov null missions or doing exploration or pi where the real content of null, and now there is less of them.
---
Is there a link to the original... article? Statement? The propaganda piece? That this post is referencing?
---
Also.. in a more succinct reply to your statement...

Yes you can, its called 'Top Gun'   :)

Yeah I’m just saying there’s a cause and effect.  Guess we’ll see if that happenss

exactly same here,

when you buy AAA title (same price as omega in EVE) youll get what you know and you have fun. with EVE you are paying each month new game and still have great uncertainitynwhat they are gping to screw next.
---
but its good thing, they need to have their wakeup call when they will be sinking without enough money
---
One day during blackout, I travelled through entire region of Syndicate without ever seeing a ship on d-scan. Before the blackout, ratters and miners would dock up or POS up as soon as I entered system, but I would still get the satisfaction knowing I disrupted their operations. Blackout made solo ratter hunting much more boring.
---
Due to new cyno changes, PG &amp; CPU requirements you now have to offline all your other mods before you can light your cyno, but you are not rendered immobile anymore so you can align your ship.  Try it next time, you may be pleasantly surprised.
---
Did you not know of this change?
---
UALX.  Never forget. Before that it was the other way around.

I don't have enough data so i am asking if people see the same stuff around them.

*The Mob is Fickle my brother....*

I´m sorry i wasn´t precise, i thought is one of those useless posts.
---
It was a c13 WH, with enough c3 sites to farm for 2h.
---
I sued a fairly blinged Kikimora, and a second char in a helios.  
---
The kiki ran the sites and the helios dropped MTU´s and scooped the loot. No salvaging.
---
(Kiki is insane in these wh´s)
---
As mentioned below the c13 WH´s i would estimate are ALL seeded with farming chars.  
---
So you need to be lucky to find one with enough sites.

except it wasnt, Goons had eclipsed Panfam for years before that only reason they took the fight was cus GSF was deployed North with their titan fleet, unlucky that the tidi mechanic allowed for them to move their entire shield super fleet multiple regions from delve whilst the fight was going on.

Let me tell you about something that instantly increase overall happiness about current sov :          
---
* removal of magic wanding      
---
* adding ehp to nodes        
---
* you need to shoot nodes till they die         
---
* nodes generate killmails
---
Ye Legacy hasnt pulled the absolute majority of the majority of this war on their own. Its all goons man, all goons. 
---
And Im sure the victim complex of those who cant even manage to get together to fight us will subside some day.
---
I know, right?
---
Seriously internal hurf and blurf to get people into seats and into fights are... exaggerated each and every time.  But you know what?  It works - it puts butts in seats.  And butts in seats for fights -&gt; big fights shake things up -&gt; all the stuff the chaos era got in the way of.  Now all we need is some ham fisted titan pilot to jump instead of bridge (god bless boat!) and it would completely go... oh wait, can't do that.  No chance of getting caps there at the drop of a hat because so few ships now can light cynos.  Oh well, there goes the next b5r.
---
I know, its shocking how little Tapi can do on their own.
---
Remove local in null, replace it with a structure with a range limit. Bigger systems might need two, or three. Placement is strategic. Easy to jam/destroy and thus pretty easy to replace also. Creates smaller skirmishes with very important outcomes. If you are outside of a "antennas" range, no local. Inside, youve got local. Should require a moderate upkeep in time, resources or both, so that you could have people ( ie content) going about making sure their intel network (ie antennas, ie Local) is up for thos who "need it".
---
I think they going to do it much sooner or relax it enough that stuff above BC will be able to use them.
---
Ah, volunteer mods, my favorite white knight subclass )))
---
Technically, no. They have limited cap, you ship scan them and also nos them and you'll see they have a finite amount. They just don't use it in any meaningful way. They supposedly repair less often when dry, but that's just a rumour really.
---
lets see how many people Imperial-Legacy shows up with and then we can decide if this is ACTUALLY a FIGHT or if its a cancer blob fest  
---
Completely one sided slaughters are not "fights" because one side had virtually no chance of winning
---
Maybe you wouldn't undock to go to fight when you're outnumbered and outclassed, plenty of people do though and sometimes, just sometimes you can win.  All it needs is that little bit of inspiration from your side or someone in the other fleet makes a mistake and this can turn the battle - this makes the victory all the sweeter, that's why we take fights against stronger opposition - for fun!
---
good lord, you are embarassing yourself. thanks for the graphic though, it's in my hard drive now for future entertainment.
---
with that aside, i don't really know how to react to this. you are like the newbro in the npc corp channel asking whether he should fit bulkheads in his ratting venture or save the cpu for a target spectrum breaker- you want to pull him back from the edge of the abyss, but he's so clueless yet any words you try to utter are mercilessly aborted by his ill-placed confidence and you can only watch in amazement as his eve career goes out in a fiery explosion no one can ever hear or see.
---
i'll only say this as feedback- you are trying to apply what little photography knowledge you have to an entirely different setting that exists basically nowhere else, not even real space. you don't look into the eve universe through a lens, the lighting is vastly different, you can't manipulate certain values to get the results you want, you can't take landscape photographs because **there's no land god damn it**. the list goes on and on but unlike you i won't make up bullshit about things i have litte clue about just for the sake of it.
---
i'd very much love to back this up with my portfolio -best kill is overkill amirite- but since i'd rather keep this reddit account anonymous, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/eveporn/comments/6cdjx0/let_it_burn_1920x1080/) [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/eveporn/comments/5ymii3/cockpit_view_1920x1080/) [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/eveporn/comments/62ec33/starburst_1920x1080/) [examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/eveporn/comments/6afxdg/malström_1920x1080/) from my previous deleted account. lots of other great photos on the eveporn subreddit too, if you want anything to go on- trust me you need it.
---
on a final note, i have never really read too much into photography.  i guess if i go professional one day, i'll do a more thorough study, but over 5 years i have gotten pretty satisfying results with some basic knowledge and principles, including post-processing. and if my photographs didn't turn out well, i probably wouldn't pretend that they were good because i had the "white balance just right for that tone of orange" or whatever.  
---
just sayin'
---
It was a test man. Wasnt definitive that it had an end date but it was sure as shit was not definitive that it didnt have an end date. A test is always a test, they always end at some point. And Falcon said a month in or so that he would want it to come back at some point in the future. Like they already knew it was going to end based on that statement alone. So it wasnt a reversal, the test just ended. If they reverse the cyno change then sure you can say its a reversal.
---
That I agree on. The complaints were deeply rooted in CCPs inability to actually deliver, they have never managed to implement and reiterate yet everyone cheered them on as if they were all of the sudden this new company. It was all a gimmick.
---
you are talking to one of the dumbest carebear posters in here.
---
The show the other side of the coin, I ran into so many ratters and miners who shat their pants when my frigate warped to their belt and it was fun. Some was quicker on the d-scan and thus had an eye open, others didn't and had no scouts what so ever and assumed "all is safe".

I guess if it don't have time limit i assume indefinite.
---
I wish people would actually do something about it ingame instead of just bitching outside of it.
---
After coming back from a long hiatus I was surprised to see the null blackout, I didn't like it at first, but I grew to live with it, and now I actually think it was better that way. I felt much safer, but more paranoid while doing my null sec duties if that makes sense. Now people will know what system I'm in again so they can actively look for me. It's a win/win lose/lose situation.
---
So your suggestion to Tapi bluing everyone is everyone else should blue eachother also? Man and people say CCP is killing this game lmao
---
«Those ideas are great but we will have to work and think a little , that's suck, I prefer when we do nothing like on FW»
---
The irony of someone who hates new things saying that
---
i mean yeah yall gatekeeping peeing lmaoooo
---
I do believe that NPCs have an infinite cap pool too. The fact that some ships like NPC Dreads stop repping sometimes is merely a bug to me. Why this ? The 6/10 Blood Covenant final boss is able to withstand both armor and shield active tanking indefinitely. 
---
NPCs are "cheating" in all ways, like in gun range (lol npcs shooting at 150km range), so I really wouldn't be surprised to learn that indeed they have infinite cap pool. I did use neuts several times on NPCs (like Dreads) without noticing any favorable impact.
---
As one of the krabbers hated around these parts, i just wanted to reply to say this is _exactly_ how i felt. 3 years of subscription payments skilling up 3 rorq accounts, a titan/dread account, super account and a fax account. That felt like I was being conned out of my time/effort/money.
---
So i had a bunch of pve accounts that I barely used. I unsubbed my 3 isk making accounts and left my subcap main running for pvp - yes I pvp more than most krabbing and pvp isn't mutually exclusive.
---
The problem with the changes is not krabbers left imo, it's that krabbers unsubbed their pve accounts and just pvp'd on their subcap mains. For me that was a reduction of 4 accounts to 1 in terms of money going to CCP.
---
let the rats randomly also attack the drones. lost drones reduce dps and therefore isk/hour. Also the cost of replacing drones. 
---
Playing with drones actively would let you save the drones by recalling them when they get targeted.
---
Don't they actually just have a "Reeeeeeeeeee" button ?
---
&gt;picks fight with bigger entity 
---
&gt;whines bigger entity is... bigger.
---
Where's that pikachu picture?
---
It's a fight. What else is it?
---
Black out wasn't new.
---
That was an old bug they decided to turn in to a feature instead of fixing.
---
If it doesn't show one, then forever.
---
Anything triggered by out of game stuff is forever. It's only in-game rewards that have limits.
---
Add/increase cap drain from cloaking so people cant be cloaked for too long without being gimped on something else
---
Allow combat probes to spot cloaked ships. This allows people to arrive on grid of the cloaked ship(s) but no further. Increase the combat probe cooldown to give the cloakers enough time to do something before being spotted by probes
---
Im saying if we are the worst thing, the thing that is killing Eve, how about you guys actually do it the old fashioned way? But no, its easier to bitch, pretending like everyone else wouldnt do the exact same thing given the chance.
---
And forget about the responsibility of everyone else. Like no one is to blame but the blocs. People having shit orgs that never manage to actually recruit and retain players have no blame in the rise of the blocs. Its funny, lets continue rewriting things to make the argument that one side is bad, whilst the rest are such nice, hardworking and pleasant people whose elitism didnt create this issue.
---
Do the guristas ravens still have 9 turrets and also launch missiles? That used to be a thing.
---
Star Citizen releasing tomorrow I heard, with 300 mil $ budget?
---
&gt;How or why people just want to krab in a game such as eve with all its possibilities is beyond me. 
---
Because ships cost ISK, and people like having cool spaceships.
---
Do you just sell PLEX every time you need a new ship or what?
---
Skill injectors for basic set of skills would be great tho
---
Skill injectors were a mistake .. for everyone who already has everything they need.
---
CCP finance division begs to differ.

A couple of points, as a krabber i didn't quit, I simply unsubbed my pve accounts and left my subcap pvp main running. That's a reduction from 4 subs to 1 in terms of money going to CCP.
---
This notion that you are either a krabber or a pvp'er is rubbish. They are not mutually exclusive. The former requires less accounts than the latter which is where I think a lot of lost subs went. The players themselves stuck around, they just didn't need 4+ accounts anymore.
---
Next point, we're not talking about a minority, PCU dropped from 30k to 20k, that's a significant drop.
---
Okay Dave.
---
Also the NPC fleets should not leave salvageable wrecks. Or drop loot.
---
Have you heard of factional warfare ?
---
This is accurate. 👍
---
As somebody who has a hand in maintaining structures... fuck no. It's already basically a second and third job trying to keep this shit running, even for a relatively small area.
---
The only way I'd support something like this is if they combined all the roles of all the different structure types into one, so we *could* reasonably only have a handful of structures, rather than spamming one structure per purpose per area. The mechanics right now basically force us to have a shitton of structure to support all the things we need to have, as we can't put it all into - say - a single Fortizar.
---
Hahaha. Fk man, what a savage.
---
So, you're telling me we didn't have multiple instances of local being broken beyond use and showered with free so because of it? Well, ok.
---
And it definitely wasn't broken the day they turned it back on.. no, absolutely not.
---
Nice WH narrative, I know all of my fellow miners and booster pilots by heart. 
---
 Be angry wormholer - anger leads to the dark side!  
---
 
---
*like* we know each other and are friends - jealous?   Complain to your edgelord leader for a hug and pat on the back.
---
I like how everything you said had basically nothing to do with composition rules. And yet I am embarrassing myself.
---
Composition rules are universal, landscape photography is not called that because it has land in it, your examples may work for EVEers, but not really in any other proper art (aside from the last example, that one was bitchin')...i could really go on forever. But let's not embarrass myself any further with this "proper composition knowledge" crap. THIS IS EVE AND THE RULES OF THE WORLD DO NOT APPLY HERE..
---
Is basically what i got from your post.
---
I mean, skill point trading prolonged the game for another three to four years but had a huge negative impact on longer term gameplay looo
---
I guess you could say it's a lifesaving toxin?
---
Its right around the area of TTT. 
---
These guys will never stop bitching. I just wish they would help their friends in Winter Co. instead of sitting here bitching on reddit.
---
Or AOM.
---
NO! You are only allowed to fight the way we want. Our PvP reigns supreme and it consists of using cloaky ships to kill miners. Thats PvP! But if you fight in the biggest event (perhaps) NS has seen for quite some time you are actually just part of the stagnation. Trust me!
---
I also belived the blackout to be the silver bullet for all things NS (too soon?).
---
Cynos  are no  issues to  big blocs lol. We  are a small group in a bloc and have roughly 20 cyno recons ready to handout/ in Caps  Hangars
---
Almost like there was a reason goons left shield supers back home :thunking:
---
&gt; Thanks ~~dad~~ again for the graphic. Ill leave you to your bubble. I guess its a good thing you dont do this for a living.
---
Can get toasty at up to 80, that's with 3 clients, chrome with 9 to 10 tabs open, discord, ts, and usually netflix/youtube/Prime running.
---
Next job is to look at cooling on the machine.
---
Also on a final (for real this time) note - i did not feel the need to bump contrast and colours so much you can hardly tell what's in the shot like you do. It kinda robs the shot of value. 
---
Also lighting is NOT different, you will probably never believe me when i say, but OUR SUN IS GENERALLY the most used lighting source. 
---
Developers have struggled for years to recreate lighting close to the real one. And as someone who has used strobes for the last 5 years...lemme tell you the lighting in this game is quite similar to our REAL life equivalent. You'd know that if you weren't talking out of your ass :)
---
That's a nuance that people around these parts are determined not to get: that people who unsubbed their krabbing accounts may still be playing on their PVP accounts.
---
Then go there and have your fun and stop whining that CCP is ending an experiment that obviously hurt the playerbase.
---
yep
---
Now I just have to buy some stickers myself. Spreading the gospel...
---
1080 I think.
---
Unpopular opinion, skill injectors are not a problem **IN AND OF THEMSELVES**
---
They became a problem when the faucets were turned on to full bore, first with Citadel's rebalancing of supers and carriers to allow for massive isk farming to fund the supply of injectors, then with the Rorqual rebalance that allowed massive chain farming with almost zero-risk and zero-skill for big blocs protected by the umbrella. Even after successive nerfds, they did little to stop the problem that was already unfolding. Unmitigated injections of cash and resource extraction into the economy.
---
This is a problem that would have been seen unfolding probably halfway through last year or at the start of this year without skill injectors. Skill injectors sped it up, sure, but it was always bound to happen if not sooner with how many events CCP has run for boosters/free SP in the past. People would have used those to train up new Rorqual alts and super toons, used the isk that they farmed from those on custom-made characters from the char bazaar and others like them. The problem is that the feedback loop of isk-generation and what it gives you is so thoroughly *fucked* that you cannot solve the problem just be shooting one of the things into the sun. It requires a rework from the ground-up in order to fix the problems that you are seeing. They are interlaced with each other.
---
The third paragraph there shows how absolutely you fail to understand the impact this had on nullsec PVE.
---
The existence of cynos means that any parallel drawn to lack of local in whs is meaningless. WH tactics will not work in blacked out null.
---
I actually agree.
---
For me, before blackout, I found the content I was used to getting very scarce already so I didn’t login as much. The BO pushed that over the edge and it was still scarce and with many PVE players not bothering to login, I stopped worrying about it too. Couple this with less time to sit there and try to work something out, I’d rather use my time wisely and to play PoE or just watch Netflix.  
---
At this moment my main has actually unsubbed with my Titan pilot remaining until middle of next month. My other 5 accounts haven’t already lapses. Eve and the player base has changed. We don’t have the time to sit there for hours to setup 15 minutes of content and risk the chance of getting none. Eve won’t be what I remember it being 2 years ago or even 5 years ago. That ship has sailed and I think most of us know that and are coming to terms with it.
---
I guess this is from a Imperium ping? What do you expect, for the normal line members all you ever get are fleets where people run or stand down. I think I've been to three "proper" fight that wasn't through a sig or squad. For a coalition filled with krabs most are starvedfor blood.
---
The companion app also mad a difference allowing people to queue skills externally and check them preventing them from getting sucked in when they used to login and check in game
---
Downvoted for the truth.
---
Dude, you can run standard sleeper cache sites in an astero. You'll only need a tengu for the 'superior' ones. 
---
It doesn't look like you'll be able to tank ghost sites in that, try it in sisi first.  Keep in mind that the explosion of the cans is always explosive, but the rats will deal damage type according to their faction, so tank accordingly. Plus two of your mid slots will be occupied by a 50mn mwd and a data analyzer (cargo scanners are optional but recommended). So you're better off using something that's armor tanked.
---
Your missile &amp; turret mechanics Videos are pinned in our Jr. Fc channel, they are pretty good
---
It's literally the exact same impact as whs..cyno only changes the duration of said attack. In a wh the tackle simply holds you till the fleet shows instead of gets dropped. That and the ability to crash them out are the only relevant differences. And the first one is usually irelivant because the gang is rage rolling for content. So they're ready for you. Which is EXACTLY the same as a gang waiting for a cyno. So tell em again how different they are.
---
I've been playing eve since 2012 not the longest but I've been around the block a few times I know Exactly how this effected NS. Weather a crab adapted or not is an entirely different discussion.
---
Why was blackout bad? The only good reason is cloaky campers. Anything else can be countered. Put a scout on a gate if your super ratting wow that was hard. Watch probe scanner for whs wow that was hard! Yes I realize this dosent solve the cloaky campers but I've already agreed they are the problem with blackout not the blackout itself.
---
So tldr CLOAKYs are the problem with blackout. Not the lack of local.
---
Yes. Obviously this is a very rough thought of mine, but I guess what I am trying to say is that each structure should be more meaningful. As you say, we have hundreds of Raitarus and Sotiyos just to manufacture and research right? Make them do more (more slots and so on), so that a "manufacturing station" is actually a big deal, and not something a person has three of on their own.   
---
Same with a Keepstar, they are everywhere but are at the same time the largest structure in the known universe (kind of). They don't fell like it since each moderate alliance has 100 of them.   
---
Now, I am in no way in to know exactly how it takes to run these; I know that PI goes to Fuel Blocks and thats about it, and perhaps that's all it needs. But in the bigger picture, I totally understand that it should not be a full time job to keep these going, but rather by creating moving part that results in content, and making null less secure by removing a lot of spamming of citadels, and at the same time making building stations and making a "citadel system" is a big deal and a cool thing to see and live in.   
---
Much like POSes created content since there was moving parts in space, that could be interacted with (content), PI should be more "content" friendly, refueling and maintaining a structure should be more.. content creating, and destroying and defending a structure should be a big deal.   
---
As mentioned, I clearly talking in big "I wish" and "what ifs" but my vision is that things should be more meaningful, create more content in all parts involved which makes for a **more living and moving space** where both smaller and bigger skirmishes could be fun for all parties of all sizes kind of. Something like that.
---
Check out the tutorials on Uniwiki. 
---
Sleeper caches are more like puzzles where you need to turn on your noggin for a bit to make the most out of it. Tanking is merely an option, and a fairly shit one too. You definitely won't tank the site with this tengu, and it 's too darn slow to not get blown up by one of the "surprises" you might get in there or to get some of the goodies that self-destruct on a timer.
---
worse than the crazy spoon throwing one? Worse than the one who committed actual industrial espionage via usb stick? Worse than the one who got smashed and decided to buy some moongoo before tech changes with insider knowledge, and got the wrong moongoo? Worse than the one who publicly demanded his alliance hound a man irl to an assisted suicide?
---
Yea, none of that adds up mate. Your view of how simple null-sec life is would get you massacred down here on a daily basis. Even without blackout.
---
&gt; I've been playing eve since 2012  
---
It's cute that you think this is impressive.
---
At least, Test is in a war. Are you making our part of pvp?
---
So you were just pretending to be retarded. Got it.
---
Here's a helpful video some member did a while ago:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LKfm2E-JCQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LKfm2E-JCQ) 
---
You might also want to watch this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQK5FYIdJco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQK5FYIdJco)
---
Stay mad, retard
---
Oh dear!
---
Hahahah that's funny I use to live out there just before blackout hit. I actually left because blackout makes it to much like whs for my taste. I prefer wh space. Far more interesting than undock safety.
---
Never said it was impressive just that I have spent the time in the game to actually know what I'm talking about. But I'm glad your more interested in insulting me that countering my points. Just bolsters my argument.
---
Fuck off idiot.
---
Haha love it.
---
Skill injectors are NOT THE PROBLEM 
---
However, skill injectors accelerated the problems. If CCP solves the actual problems, the injectors would lose it's status of unbalancing the game
---
I've been winning Eve, again, for 90 days now. AND oh boy was I belly aching about the black out.  But I was never on board the remove local train. Delayed, sure. 
---
I'll probably be winning Eve for a few more months. For some reason I can't stay away.
---
I heard local works in WH space sometimes, it's like a party line with random systems.
---
I've noticed they appear to attack you far quicker if there are NPC miners nearby.
---
I actually laughed at this one, good job.
---
Countering you points would be redundant. One thing one learns quicky on r/Eve is that when somebody "knows" how something works from a distance, nothing will persuade them. I could write a doctoral thesis here explaining in detail how null is nothing like WHs, and I would get nothing but recycled arguments in return.
---
 *4.Low-Effort Meme*
---
*No  low effort shitposts Mspaint images or simple Eve logo copy pastes onto  a pic - they will be removed. This includes generic meme templates -  though sometimes we let them through. Post at your own risk.*
---
*We didn't say shit about blueing anyone. We're not blue to Provi either. But set your alarm clocks for the next three hours and see the end of 03 in real time.*
---
Near2 already has them docking up while two jumps out.
---
I'm not asking for wh to null differences I simply asked why you think blackout failed. And cloaky campers is my reason. Prove me wrong.
---
Personally I split most of my spare time between Eve and Wow Classic whereas before classic came out I spent it all on eve. That might be one reason less people actively play eve.
---
I should add that blackout didn't really affect me since I don't krab.
---
Dinoposting in italics is the new low.
---
mmmm salty, just the way I like it.
---
I got less invested into eve BEFORE the blackout, honestly. The game became boring, as there were fights, but generally, the stakes of each fight is a lot lower than i remember it 1.5yrs ago. I think, making nullsec more vulnerable to campaigns would help alot.
---
Something like another station transition, where alliance need to hold a single region at a certain time. This would force players into a single place, and force them to get out of their usual infrastructured habitat.
---
You think its not too far gone? How do they delete the existing supercap umbrellas?
---
"We're not blue to Provi either" .... yet ....
---
I suggest you direct your abuse at CCP Rise. Maybe calm down a bit too. You seem mad about facts.
---
Can steam players get this too?
---
&gt;A lot of people used blackout as an excuse to take a break.
---
I could deal with CCP's broken chat servers. That was/is a bit funny to me. But the BO was the straw that broke my back.  I was already in semi-won Eve mode with RL taking over. The BO just pushed me over the edge. Right now, the break is treating good. Thanks CCP for giving me my life back.
---
to defend their krabs? Definitely not to defend Tenerifis
---
It's funny, but I actually play more WoW than EVE after being dragged into it by a friend.
---
Never played WoW before in my life, but I certianly play less EVE now.
---
Why haven't we blued FRAT yet?
---
"fight" implies that WC ever had a chance
---
Can I ask you a question?
---
Why did you find disrupting their operations satisfying?
---
Well they've added local again.
---
they didn't pick a fight with the Imperium you fucking dumb cunt  
---
what do you have like 2 braincells?
---
Shit content is better than no content.
---
Yeah
---
You do realize a KS DD arcs to the ships with the biggest sig right pinky...
---
I dont see a problem . Was the fight good ?
---
have fun in BFE as nothing more than PL renters while those who do take the neutral offer get to stay
---
underrated comment
---
&gt;didn't catch a krabbing player- "MUST BE A BOT"
---
Welcome to chaos
---
i don't get it :(
---
Hah, pretty awesome.
---
&gt; Prove me wrong. 
---
Every time I see somebody say that, I get this urgent desire to stop talking entirely. It's one of these phrases I can't help rolling my eyes at.
---
I'll say this, tho: Blackout failed because it didn't address the balance issue in null at all. It simply flipped the switch from one extreme (PVE dominated) to the other (PVP dominated) without any attempt to make it balanced. - Both extremes are bad for the game, and flipping between them does nothing except drive players away.
---
CCP desperately needs to Google the definition of: "balance", because there is an extreme lack of it going around in EVE these days.
---
Your wonderful prose and well thought out arguments have completely changed my mind.      
---
/s in case your literacy skills are not capable of telling.      
---
Asset safety on at least some levels will eventually get removed. That's from the CCP interviews. But feel free to curse some more.
---
Who are you talking to? I do FW in Black Rise. I don't do any renter stuff.
---
This probably sounds super dumb, but what's the point of the highs on an osprey like that?
---
What are you smoking and where can I get some?
---
Hahaha
---
So I've heard. I still have too much going on in RL to commit to my mistress. Like others have said, BO was the intervention we, I, needed. 
---
That being said, I'll still log in once in a while and run a mission or die playing in lowsec.
---
So you’re saying he’s driving people away by playing it?
---
No one remembers facts only reddit spin.
---
why is inner hell working with HK now?
---
Why delete them? Don't like being forced to fight something that has a number advantage in order to get your reward?
---
..wait a minute...
---
"Facts". And ye arguing against pseudoscience is now being mad. Or against people who believe in it. Whats next flat earther?
---
No, it's your reddit flair.
---
thatsthejoke.jpg
---
You'll get there.
---
People going apeshit over something Hilmar said in an interview is nothing new.
---
Yeah because people are petrified of losing myrmidons
---
I'll blue her anyday
---
I just aged another 10 years, good lord.
---
Such an angry little thing
---
We secretly are. The war is just a show to make this sub believe otherwise. In reality all of NS gets together and suck eachother of behind dumpsters after our weekly "stagnate the game" meetings.
---
Right, then you have no idea what you're talking about and you're a low effort karma whore.
---
In incursions the repair rats "Mara" actually stop repping after a while, could be due to no cap left...
---
No, it doesn't. Nobody owes you a handicap.
---
the keepstar DD goes after biggest mass , higs rigged ospreys with prop on will have more mass than the main fleet. There basically sacrificial ships to prevent the DD from killing anything you care about
---
You mean, somebody picked a fight with test, and didn't expect tests allies to help them?
---
Come on now...
---
This was a good one. Well done sir.
---
Calm down mr ferox f1 pusher
---
I don’t know how you do it olmeca. These people are nuts
---
It's not even spin, if Scalding Pass etc. become neutral we'll be shot as trespassers, in just about any ship. It's just pure bullshit.
---
Your argument is with CCP and reality miner, not with me.
---
&gt; At least, Test is in trying to blue the last neutral entity in the game. Are you making our part of bluetral?
---
True but how many times over should a person be able to make on his investment before the likelihood of that ship blowing up goes up to 100% that’s the issue here... a person is able to make enough to buy 10 supers before he actually loses one
---
No they are not dead... they have moved to vale and are sucking off rote and unspoken.
---
Lol I mean I can absolutely understand that reaction. But     I don't see why everyone hated blackout beyond cloaks. Local is a problem for NS. To use your words. A balance problem. And it being full on normal local is honestly bullshit and in no way fair. At the VERY least empires should have to pay for that safety.
---
Don't get me wrong blackout could have been handled mUCH better.. but honestly.. what do we expect from a dude who's name is BURGER.. And besides all of this I feel like we're having two conversations here one about how ccp can't actually do anything because they're so incompetent and the other about weather blackout could have been good or not.
---
Chose one? Lol
---
Cuz your right ccp can't do shit cuz they don't know what or how to do it. But when they do finally do something.. weather it's half assed or not they should get SOME..small.. minut amount of credit.. lol even if it could have been better cuz it can always be better..
---
Make a counter to cloaks and blackout can work to some extent. But full normal fool proof cloaks breaks it.
---
You're doing it wrong, this is what they want to write.
---
This is not a medieval knight tournament.  
---
Welcome to Eve.
---
Then just maybe they should have taken papa Vilys peace offering back in March there sport
---
It just sounds like you are saying " you should blue more people" lmao what a joke, let me know when Tapi is able to do anything on their own.
---
China wants to take over tranquility and blue everything eventually. rip eve
---
They haven’t played the game in years man.  This is all they have left
---
Stopped playing almost half a year ago and still here.
---
Repper and shield boost effects have a probability to trigger. Any neut will lower that chance. The actual formula and base values where never published. They are quite small tho, so it's not really worth neuting NPCs.
---
This, for probably the last 2 years only reason i logged in and did stuff was so i didn't fall behind everyone else for when CCP finally fixed the game. CCP turning local back on just confirms to me they are more committed to a stable number of krabs in there game than it being a risky game like it used to. Which is totally fine a man has got to make his money.
---
WHOOOOP WHOOOOP : gonna have to pull it over for the fact police here.  
---
Watch it with those facts mister you’re getting a little too loose for this narrative.  Try and keep it down ok - got a lot of asshurt PanFam sympathizers in this area
---
Too bad no one undocks up there
---
Honestly, I don't have "the solution".
---
But I don't think it will ever be "too far gone". In the most extreme case, you could just render supers useless, and the superumbrellas are gone;) Is this practical? No, of course not. But it shows, that there is a possibility to remove the damage this has done. BOB died after they were deemed invincible, the russians "died" after they were deemed too connected and too wealthy...
---
I think, a shift in paradigm is more important to the healrth of the game, than single balance changes. However, balance changes can cause such shifts.
---
They are snuggled in with rote in vale now... forsaken empire is recruiting.... no apostle scams here guys... just good memes and good fites.
---
cloakyfags overfished; whales are extinct now.
---
i uninstalled
---
Because both corps have no backbone.
---
Lol thats true.
---
You yourself just made the point that you didn’t quit but just stopped subbing so many accounts. I’m sure that is reflected in that drop. I’m not some lite pvper. Im just an average player who genuinely enjoyed the blackout. I took extra precautions, I used an alt to check gates, I paid more attention to my map and intel, I made decisions in game based on the idea that I might need to escape fast. It was nice to actually play eve instead of it just being in the background. And honestly when it comes to fights the fight between elo and Ron is a perfect example of why no local is just better. That fog of war should be there... but maybe it should be done differently than straight up no local
---
People have realised that there is life outside Eve. When you stop logging in for a bit you realise that the extra sleep you get is good, the trips to the gym are nice, your family are quite fun to engage with, pubs are cool etc. Europe is having a bit of a second summer as well, which is nice.
---
I expect many people who unsubbed will come back, the pull of skilled chars and mountains of isk sat in wallets tends to win in the end. It will not be immediate though.
---
Ah ye temp blues to manage something is bad. Well, atleast we know what the issue is now.
---
Also most of Second Galaxy's players are ex eve guys.
---
And their numbers aren't even inflated due to alts etc.
---
The salt mountain grows! Almost time to harvest. :)
---
I wasnt the one citing shitty "facts" to prove a point. Did I write to you?
---
and somewhere in between you get cap dropped ? right? right? :)
---
Hahahaha are you saying a 38k player alliance can't manage a 18k player alliance without the help of a 45k player alliance?
---
This really explains the Tapi victim complex.
---
Lmao, invasions.
---
listen delusional troll, the war is coming to the final phase in four hours. Their home staging will be overrun this morning. I have nothing to be salty about. I just hate little lying bitches.
---
enjoy the game dying at your hands retard
---
Hey, I'm kinda new to the game, I've been investigating witha friend and we'd like to know about isk conversion (isk to €, isk to plex and plex to €).
---
We are trying to know if you can pay a omega subscription just with farming in game so if someone could help us we'd be very grateful.
---
it hasnt happened yet, if WC even tries to fight they'll likely be outnumbered by a factor of 3 due to Legacy batphoning their overlords (as they seem to do with literally every major timer)
---
I wish your posting was dying by my hand
---
We'Re NoT bLuE tO iMpErIuM  
---
all the hurf blurf about how Legacy are not imperium pets because they roam in bombers or t1 dessies in eachothers space  
---
what a joke when it suits you now you consider them allies
---
Any change that one-sidedly favors one play style over another to this extend is going to be hated. CCP basically just gave PVE players the middle finger and told us we should be doing PVP instead. - I'm not exactly sure how they convinced themselves this was going to end well.
---
Like I say: balance is the thing they need. This is a game where people plan long-term, and spend months or even years playing out strategies and achieving goals. Mechanics "chaos" is not a good thing in a game like that.
---
&gt; They became a problem when the faucets were turned on to full bore
---
They are the very thing that allowed the faucets to *be* opened full bore.  There were a very finite number of rorq, titan, and super pilots available in game, and they traded hands as that finite thing on the EVE O forums.
---
Were injectors/extractors never created the tools to open the faucets wouldn't have ever existed in the first place, once they were the number of capable alts increased exponentially like a virus until the game was infected beyond repair and the dam torn open.
---
and yet more vultures! Fantastic! I don't own a Ferox fyi
---
its not a handicap you fucking mong, how fucking inbred are you?
---
lmfao i can almost guarantee im more active than you
---
First, thank you for the changes. Waking up and debating is rough, haha. :)  
---
Second, when I say local structures they should affect all in system no matter alliance/standing. So if there´s a structure withing range, everyone will be connected. Heck, perhaps only A structure is needed, no range, just solar system wide.   
---
I understand for reasoning for full local being the best middle ground, but to me it annoys me to hell that you instantaneously know who´s in a system. Not only does it break immersion (which is often my biggest draw to a game), but it removes some roles that I think will/could make more content (scouts, maintenance and such which in it self creates content = more people in space = more content). People only undock for so few things, which is a big issue with the game feeling stale.   
---
Structure spam, not so much. Imagine them having, say 20AU range or something, nothing too small but enough to differentiate a smaller system from a bigger. The fact that some system are big as shit and warp speed and scanning distance actually comes into play, is super cool. Because sensors and the skill/tools to use them is super cool and fun, but a permanent local removes half of the excitement I think.
---
Are we back to this? So lets use your math, 38k divided by 3 timezones = 13k. And thats given equal distro which we both know isnt true. So 13k vs. 18k. And were still winning right? We were before goons got involved and I would most def say Mangos do hell of a lot more than goons but sure.
---
And what I was saying is that you guys should temp blue instead of bitching on reddit. You know, actually do something in the game instead of on reddit. Hurt the bad man.
---
I'd just expect Legacy to maybe fight WC without the help of their Goon overlords, they always outnumber WC by themselves, batphoning GSF to every timer is simply pathetic
---
Well, more injectors accelerated problems that already existed.
---
Making balancing more difficult to manage.
---
Well you know, when you can't play as you want because hunters has a serious advantage in the intel department, then you realize than others games exist, and that they are more fun than EVE.
---
I found Oxygen Not Included and I still play more at it today. I still manage my corporation, but I use less time for it so that I can play.
---
Most of the people who left the game still didn't come back, reducing my interest to log in more anyway.

The Blackout v1 had a serious impact.

Lmao classic Tapi brain "you should blue more people"
---
I don't really feel the need to respond to your constant mewing on reddit.  From your post history, it's clear who you are.
---
How is bluetraling small alliances bad? I mean, we could stomp them... But why would we? Rather having a small alliance grow to add some diversity to the politics of Eve..
---
Btw, if TEST would hunt the small alliances, wouldn't that be blobbing? So all TEST does, is: saying they will not blob anyone who is willing to NOT ally with the main enemy. Every other enemy is fair game...
---
Hey I just met you  
---
And this is crazy  
---
But I’m from TAPI  
---
So blue me maybe
---
Because it made them stop making isk, which is the only goal in EVE for too many people, maybe even everyone but small-gang PvPers who earn just about enough isk to afford and replace their ships and claim to be the elitest.
---
Why is there a Keepstar in a C2/HS held by a corp with only 9 characters?  Drop a giant loot pinata like that and someone will notice.
---
Thank you for the precision, definitely will check it out on Uniwiki !
---
Oh I never thought about Sisi, thanks for the hint !
---
Owning and having a player run universe means that we have a lot of cool cogwheels in place to make this a living universe. Disrupting the enemies operations is a cool part of that. Everything from destroying a mining operation (which creates ships and modules for the enemy) to destroying their stations (which manufacture ship and modules to blow YOU up), is all part of this machinery. It what makes the economy and if you will, "the butterfly" effect actually happen.   
---
"I love the idea of Eve but..."; how many times do one read this comment. Eve is the most coolest MMO out there because of all of this. It's all made, moved, produced and destroyed by players, for players.
---
if you really wanna cheese the fuck out of the superior sleeper, just run it in a rorqual for the archive room. You will get a t3c hotdrop a bomber fleet on you, then the moment they break immunity you will get free wrecks to loot.
---
If it's such an easy target, why do three of the biggest (if not the three biggest) wormhole corps need to group up together for it?
---
Alliances don't grow by joining the blue donut. Conflict is good for the game.
---
Tetryon:
---
1656dps(max) 25.5km 7.02tracking
---
Baryon:
---
1549dps(6.5% less) 40km(57% more) 7.02tracking
---
Well they put it up, like most wh-corps did put it up, to show they we/they could.
---
After Rage Eviction, every C5/C6 corp took theirs down, because it's basically just a big target. But putting it into a C2 only leaves with 3 options. Either it's staying there forever, it's dying or they take it down to reprocess it ... they cannot take it out of the wh. So they probably decided to keep it. And from what i can see/read and what i hear, it's putting up a better fight then the Rage Keepstars. Ofc there are not 1000 raven#s involved ... but so far thats the first keepstar that is defending itself kinda properly.
---
Agree. I was mining in a procurer yesterdat in low sec. Then a prospect appear/decloak and then 5 BLOPS kill me. Nice. The kill take them more isk in fuel than my ship kill, i won the isk war. They say "we are bored", and send me 20m. Other players quit the game for that type of kill, because many peeople are sane and no fight whem mo chance to do so. In my example, events as that make the procuurers guys dont want logging again. Less targets for ths five BLOPS team, less players to eve. If you put too the trig recon squads in high sec belt,s the game lost many miners, real miners, forthe pleasure uf BLOPS , coverts, and the stupid developer who make high sec belts dangerous than low sec belts.
---
Woa, look everyone, this guys got a super
---
not fully awake yet so, not sure if i've processed exactly everything you said there, but on the "more people in space" point, from my experience FCing, most people just see it as extra ball ache inbetween content for pvp, with local especially before the blackout fucked the player count up, you'd be able to sail through regions knowing which systems weren't worth your time and then being able to catch dudes and provoke fights, with the blackout what happened was you would spend longer in every single system just trying to catch onto like maybe a myrmidon? and it took a lot longer to find essentially smaller targets that had less chance of being responded to and getting fights, it got boring super quick.   
---
as for structure spam, I don't necessarily mean too many structures on one grid but more that it's just more structures to grind down which I'm sure is universally accepted to be one of the larger problems we have in this here game.  
---
I don't know about you but I quite liked having to mess around with log off traps and blue spies and all that to get the biggest catches when ganking, but also 95% of the times I went for something big, it wasn't because I wanted to gank the big thing it's because I wanted to fight the subcaps that came out to defend it, I also feel that far too many of the changes suggested on this reddit are focussed on the ganking aspect, and its the so called hunters wanting to just gank supercapitals with impunity and the more pve only focussed dudes acting like thats the only issue and that they absolutely should drop the hammer on everything that comes near.  
---
If they somehow delayed the chat logs from ingame to peoples PCs by even just a few minutes that would stop near2 or whatever from instantly alerting people who are afk just listening out for the alarm which Im sure everyone can agree is cancer, but I do think we should reward people who are attentive and actually at their keyboard physically watching intel and communicating with their friends about what's going on around them.
---
For the loot and the big shiny explosion at the end would be my guess.
---
Ok, so everyone is supposed to leave it alone because...?
---
The thing is WC and Legacy are actually on fairly even footing when it comes to AUTZ/CHTZ. Yes, Legacy outnumber them in Euro and US but this isn’t when the war is being fought.
---
For these large timers WC also batphone Panfam and allies which results in them outnumbering Legacy in the AUTZ/CHTZ which then in turn brings Goons to ally with Legacy.
---
Personally I don’t like the Goon and do like the WC leadership like Noraus and I would prefer to brawl all day with WC vs Legacy and no-one else tagging along.
---
If it were FRT bringing in their batphones you wouldbe laughing at TEST saying "hurr durr you guyz g0t stomPed". Don't try and pretend you have any sort of moral high ground.

u and awesomegamer should start hosting reddit posting lessons or smth
---
Or they're incredibly risk averse and instead of entertaining the possibility of a fight (against each-other) they do what they do best, blob and f1.
---
Didn't say that, you just asked why there is one ... and i just told you why there were keepstars in wh-space in the first place ... 
---
They obviously attacked it and thought it's much easier to go for it, because their former experience showed them that you can perform something super easy with 1000+ ships and people, so since they never experienced any trouble with attacking a keepstar, they probably assumed that 200 dudes will do the trick as well ...
---
Eclipsed for years. Lol. Do you know why GSF ensures that it helps out their friends? Because Eve rose up against them and smacked them down after being promised a ton of ISK. To sit there and then say it is wrong for them to help out a friend is laughable.
---
China doesnt know yet the full power of the Vily.
---
I know you're trying to be sarcastic but I feel theres an element of truth in this
---
Sorry if you read above pinky knows best
---
Well IH/LZK/HK seems to try to kill the Keepstar of N0MEX or maybe even go for a full eviction. And they killed a couple N0MEX dudes and maybe some of them weren't even inside the hole. Our secret reliable source of information told us that keeping Hole Control didn't go as planned for the attacker and some or many people made it into the C2 ...
---
I'm confused - is the narrative in this post that HK/IH/LZHX are terrible and losing ships left and right in a big fight against a keepstar or that they are risk averse and afraid of a real fight?  
---
Last question: Is this still Eve, where CCP Games once said "Build your dreams; wreck theirs" or is this a new game where some tiny group that built a huge, shiny loot pinata deserves not to have it killed because space is perfectly safe?
---
&gt; And from what i can see/read and what i hear, it's putting up a better fight then the Rage Keepstars.
---
If your head wasn't up your own ass, you'd hear more
---
God pinky, you're almost as embarrassing for novac as awesomegamer
---
maybe the holding corp is part of a HS carebears coalition
---
Yet you keep feeding them when you comment :thonking:
---
I lived in wormholes for a long time.  I get why Keepstars exist there.  I don't get why they exist in a hole held by 9 characters with a HS static.
---
All the more reason it should be burned from Bob's domain
---
praisebob isn't secret nor reliable sadly.
---
I actually did not know that ... how could i ... we don't have a keepstar. :D
---
Yes wormholes are so safe, please come back and farm them again!
---
Maybe because they had so much money and didn't know what to do with it. Besides that putting up a keepstar in a C2 is alot of work. So they accomplished that. Maybe a goal for them. :) Whatever the reason might be. It just shows that everything is possible in EVE.
---
Amarr + Caldari are always at war against Gallente + Minmatar, there's a warzone of multiple systems for each ongoing war (amarr/min, cal/gal). You can enlist in the NPC corp for each faction or you can join with an entire corporation. You have Factional Warfare (FW) complexes to defend/conquer, FW missions to run, and are constantly able to legally attack and be attacked by members of the opposing militias in high sec.
---
Check your menus for Factional Warfare.
---
And why shouldn't someone try to destroy it and get some of that loot?
---
If moving shit in and out of wormholes wasn't so cancerous, i would gladly live in one again.
---
Karmafleet is recruiting.
---
Didn't say that either. It's just nice to see that a Keepstar under some circumstances is able to not go down instantly :)
---
Shh, you'll wake the bitter-vets.
---
Off TZ groups fighting FRT on their TZ and you can't outform? That's pretty sad. Maybe if 3/4 of your Coalition wasn't afk krabbing you could form up for a timer in your nayive TZ.
---
Keepstar in c2 that IH/hk/LH are attacking.
---
They apparently lost hole control and forces friendly to nomex (keepstar owner) are getting into the system to defend the ks.
---
And I assume Panfam showing up on WCs side constantly is just a coincidence? :thinking:
---
in case you looking for a public channel to pew stuff ( non indy related) theres : Spectre Fleet ( ingame channel" SF Spectre Fleet") Bombers Bar (chhannel same name)  and The Beehive ( bjornbees channel)
---
lol have an upvote
---
I hear you.   
---
My ideology is that you should not be hunting for a red local chat, but that the game and the structure of the space should create fights. I realize this needs a lot of changes not only to local, which I don't have any ideas for from to top of my head. But as for null we are building and holding space, to grow and prosper, create "civilizations and markets", to wage war and to make a legacy and create cool stories and fun moments.  
---
What I am trying to create in my head is that with a space that is focused on making sure more people need to be out in actual space doing stuff, there will be fights because there are people about not because of local, but because space is big and to secure a whole solar system, let alone a region for that, should not be that "easy".. if that makes any sense. There need to be different ships, people, roles and such that makes space lived in, not either AFKed or only undocking when local is blue.   
---
Intelligence today is looking at local.   
---
I understand that a delayed local will maybe solve the third party stuff, but from my own experience that's maybe half of the issue, since so many people will never undock if they cant mine in their Rorq and have one eye on local. Which is bad in my opinion. Undocking a CAPITAL mining ship is a big deal, or should be, and a magic window with a list of hostiles that instantaneously tells you when they have arrived (not at your local, but at the same star) is... bad.   
---
Maybe I am hoping for it to be way more like.. say, the TV show The Expanse or something, or like Star Wars... I know I am trying to explain and advocate for something that feels way to insecure for the people who just wanna make ISK upon ISK until they own 4 titans and then complain that the game is stale, with a purchase history of 20000 PLEX and then complaining that the game is stale because they did not "do space stuff" (that could create content).   
---
I feel like I am rambling on and kind losing my own thread here, but it comes down to that I am very passionate about how frigging cool Eve is as a player run MMO and I have been loving (and playing) since 2003 and always hoped for it to its full potential of that player run universe.
---
Yes that seems the trend.
---
I believe it is bacause it is now obvious CCP does not have the gut to follow through, so why bother with the game?
---
I'm pretty sure those are different people and you just hear people who are angry more than those who are happy.
---
At least he is at his keyboard unlike most of Eve.
---
Take care, converting isk in RL curency is not allowed and banable.  
---
the opposit is OK, buying plex with € and sell it ingame for Isk.  
---
about paying your sub with isk (and buying plex with isk). techniquely you can but as young player it's the worst idea ever.  
---
simple math : 
---
Nullsec dominix krabing can give you around 20M tics (VERY optimistic) so 60M/h  
---
plex are 3.6M now, so 1.8b for a month  
---
you will need at least 30h of constant farming to pay you sub  
---
you will play to farm to pay your sub to be able to play to farm to pay your sub...  
---
juste enjoy the alpha F2P for some time, learn a lot, then pay your few first subs with € (maybe wait for some sales), learn how to have somme passive inomme and finaly you will yours subS with isk
---
Ok, so putting aside your personal issue with HK, it sounds like we all agree that a group with 9 active characters that builds a keepstar in a HS hole where there is no asset safety should probably lose that keepstar, right?
---
Can you sneake Capital ships inside Superior sleeper caches ?
---
/u/ccp_falcon please look a this.
---
"Because I only care about my playstyle.   Anything else is ruining the game."
---
But why
---
Vargur has a capacitor of 7.75k with skills a average battleship sized rat only has 3k cap. So yes everything was working as intended. Your Vargur would need to be under 38% cap before you could drain anything from it, assuming you put no batteries on your Vargur.
---
Wow, somebody remembers the Jove.  Since then we've had all kind of factions, drifters, triangles and so on but no Jove.

Ganking is not PvP.

This does not solve the harshest of stuck in structure bugs. Where you can be stuck bumping between two objects at high speed. This kind of bumping can be seen when you undock dreads from some kinds of npc stations.

You don't need a tengu for most of the superior one either. A stratios with a plate will do just fine assuming you stay out of the explosion room, which i wouldn't take a tengu inside anyway because it would have to be absurdly blinginy to survive.
---
As long as you stay out of the mine room and the explosion room astero is fine, as long as you stay out of the explosion room stratios is fine. You should be very careful of the sentry room and immediately cloak up and warp off if you fail the can to make the sentry friendly.
---
Spoiler: 5 hours of nothing happening while everyone continues krabbing on their alts.
---
&gt; I understand that a delayed local will maybe solve the third party stuff
---
I don't want delayed local at all, I want it being logged to your PC to be delayed so It can't be scraped by third party apps, local absolutely should be instant or the furthest  im willing to go with that is whilst you hold cloak you dont appear in local but you dont recieve local and cant Dscan whilst on a gate cloak, thats pretty unbalanced.
---
you have to balance peoples will to go through extra steps against wanting to give people more reason to be out there and doing stuff, unfortunately making things more complicated and throwing in extra steps generally just rubs people up the wrong way and makes them less willing to put the effort in, and you end up with a negative response, see the reaction to the blackout and the cyno changes, space is absolutely more empty due to that.
---
I totally understand where you're coming from with wanting to be turbo simulation of deepest darkest space, but honestly Eve just isn't that, making stuff happen, organising shit to do and getting people involved is already a pain in the ass to do, but is relativley rewarding, you throw in more steps like the blackout did and it becomes more of a pain to motivate yourself into putting in the extra effort especially when the actual amount of people in space is going down it compounds and you just burn out quicker.
---
&gt;I feel like I am rambling on and kind losing my own thread here, but it comes down to that I am very passionate about how frigging cool Eve is as a player run MMO and I have been loving (and playing) since 2003 and always hoped for it to its full potential of that player run universe.

Dude I know that feel a lot, Like I do believe you are genuine in this unlike some people can be on here, I just don't feel the way you would like things to be would actually turn out the way you think it would.
---
NC PL is basically useless, Horde brings &lt;100 dudes typically, GSF often fills a fleet
---
Tbh had this and it was usually below this threshold that i am saying.            
---
Can you give some example where this can happen ?          
---
        
---
I was also heavily bumped from object traveling and immersive speeds, but you finally slow down.
---
I'm in the same situation. I enjoyed the games I played in the past (was always a long term player), but I wish I started out in EVE earlier. I'm only 4 weeks old. :(
---
I don't have a personal issue with HK. I simply don't care about them.
---
But i don't agree that they have to lose their keepstar. People will try to kill it. If they succeed, they succeed, if they don't succeed, they don't. I don't see that there should be a requirement to own a keepstar. Maybe every corp should have one. Or maybe nobody should have one.
---
Besides what do you expect will drop anyways. I don't think there will be alot of things inside it ... for like you said 9 ppl ... in a C2, maybe a couple retrievers, 2-3 rattles. And a couple caracals.
---
Or maybe they own 15 carriers. Who knows
---
I honestly believe reversing the decision was a terrible idea... I hope that they one day they implement it again and stick with it and make sov desirable again to conquer...
---
To not remove mechanic that player use for years due to issues with the engine and new players bumping off structures?
---
hot take: it was citadels themselves that eventually created most of the problem with the ability to produce unlimited numbers of caps and supers as long as you had the resources. 
---
prior caps and supers had to be built in poses that could be reasonably sieged and had limited production slots. Compare to citadels where the only limitation are resource availability and manufacturing slots on characters with the skills to put them in.
---
Except it was rather unbalanced for 1 player to keep another locked down indefinitely.
---
*Carrier Blob Incoming*
---
Is this real life ?
---
Warped our brutix fleet to a cyno to shoot at it. Fleet got stuck in the fortizar for 40 minutes because we warped at 30. Being bounced back and forth. I imagine other large ship situations could be warping at certain distances from some anoms like rock havens.
---
who is talking about small gangs? What is it with you and you guys fixation on those nerds? are you even capable of thinking in borader terms?
---
Well to be fair, vni was op in price/nessesary skills vs output, not to mention it being fast and agile making it rather slippery aswell. But yea break peoples toys and they wont be happy.
---
I believe the same effort made today by players which already is incredible could be put to use in other and better places. Same effort, but with more rewarding excitement as a result of just more stuff to engage with in actual space.   
---
 But again, this would involve a big rework of local, sov, structures and especially the amount of interaction in the way we make ISK (PI which has almost zero interaction with other players, "ratting" which is kind of sad and boring except a few things that require teamwork and can be interacted with by other parties).   
---
The moon mining changes is an example of a good thing in a way, since now you can actually interact with people extracting moon minerals. That is good. That creates content = there´s people actually doing some "space work"! Catching a hauler/freighter who's supplying a market is a cool thing, that creates a sense of a living space with moving parts that all contribute to the universe feeling alive and creates content.   
---
Anyway, I think I have exhausted most of my ideas and my ability to explain them both in theory and the fact that english is not my first language.   
---
I want to genuinely thank you for indulging and debating with on a level that is unlike many other here on r/eve.  
---
So thank you and I hope we all, including CCP, finds the right vision and execution for this amazing game.
---
Did panfam abandon the front after getting humiliated twice in a superbrawl?
---
Don't know about that iv seen my fair share of them getting caught because of their piss poor align time, fast yeah, in a straight line or really wide orbit sure, deff not agile tho, not in their meta role of rat bashing.
---
like a lot of CCP's changes, they change shit to hurt one set of people and screw over a totally different set of people, With the VNI just think how many new bro's you saw join your corp or alliance and then through corp were helped into a ratting VNI either as an alpha or omega at which point they became fairly self sufficient, were able to buy their own pvp ships, and replace any vni losses they incurred, you cant say the same now, all those new bro's no longer have a simple route to being isk independent.
---
People itt talking about the big blocs fighting like that’s still a thing. Sadly GSF are too large / rich now, so that if they get involved in any conflict there most likely won’t even be many fights to speak of. 
---
Walking down the road to Serenity.
---
Totally agree. Unsubbed my accounts because of blackout reversal. Don't think I'll be back tbh.

---
Do you have source for any of this?
---
Allowing supers to rat was a mistake from the beginning. Just have rats despawn when a super enters a site and be done with the whole issue. There is no way to balance supers as a universal anti-subcap DPS ship *and* a PVE ship at the same time.
---
KK will test this.

That's the kind of thing someone missing a fundamental design concept would say.  The camel is a finely tuned machine for survival in an extreme environment.

---
The artists are probably generating more money in SKIN revenue than they cost, so ideally they're subsidizing expensive dev work.
---
So you expect Legacy to let WC bring Panfam and friends and just fight outnumbered?
---
Sounds like the pot calling the kettle black a little here.
---
You're being dishonest after all your posts in this thread if you say you "don't care about" HK.  It's clear on its face you don't like them, and that's fine.  Just be honest about it.  
---
If a group can afford a Keepstar, they have isk.  There's loot in that thing, unless they've safe logged it all.  I'll bet they have caps in there too. Even if it's completely empty, a keepstar kill in wormholes is worth working for.  Goons worked for a decade plus rolling holes from highsec to seed Rage, after all.  
---
If you want to shitpost, fine, this is r/eve after all, but don't be deliberately obtuse about your personal feelings - at least not when it's so clear to everyone.

To be fair it's good for goon fcs to get some experience taking fleets that direction. 
---
They'll be doing that a lot more in the near future.
---
a healthy game isn't bleeding subscribers like a stabbed pig
---
Two things: 
---
1. Alliances die when raided by the blue donut (which would be the case here)
---
2. How are they in the blue donut if they are just left alone? It is even stated, that there will be no support by Legacy. (But no support of [FIRE](https://FI.RE) which wants the region, either)
---
From a PL point of view.. We have like 3 people that are active in this timezone so we don't even bother.
---
Yep confirmed... I'm loged in but hardly undock.
---
&gt; This solves issue of all unintentional or mechanic based bumping, but will bring back player based bumping
---
Player based bumping was literally the problem this was originally talked to about to solve lol. You can bump tackle a large ship indefinitely in high sec without gaining aggression, that was not a reasonable state of affairs.
---
Fun little video. I like that they apparently had reships available and couldn't figure out how to kill a single astero.
---
This post, meh
---
You could just asset safety something worthless from a structure in the same system and see where it ends up.
---
I just blue myself.
---
Nope ... i really don't care about them. I am just usually rooting for the "smaller" guys, or the eviction victims. Especially when it's like back in 2015 QEX/HK/LZX ... only here IH/HK/LZX ... in that particular case i am not for the attackers which includes HK, as they team up with IH... so yes ofc i hope they fail. But when we face them in regular fights, they are simply just another opponent, no personal hatred against them.
---
Did you root for HK against the 1000 man goon fleet?  Doesn't sound like it from your previous statements.  So you're inconsistent in your belief system - the common denominator being HK.  Which brings me back to my original point.
---
&gt;Unpopular opinion, skill injectors are not a problem

&gt;IN AND OF THEMSELVES
---
Correct , rest of your post is wrong. Eve's gameplay problem ( outside of ship tweaks and sov mechanics ) is ALTS
---
You do more dps at close range? I'm not sure how that's a bad thing when you have something scram-webbed.
---
You mean, they're French ?
---
No, i was even there with LZX to fight against the attackers. :)
---
Idk they told me that bulkahontas was a main
---
Have to agree with OP here, I started playing 2,5 years ago and the only reason Im still around is stubbornness. All those fancy new upgrades to UI - used them all once and closed them forever. The game really need a cleanup for newcomers sake. There's simply too much information to consume before actually partaking in conscious content generation, except being a F1 monkey which is a Garbo experience when you're trying to become your own pilot.
---
Glad we can agree
---
null was a blank slate.  the whole "null is supposed to be risky" is just a myth from the old days.  it isn't supposed to be risky, it is supposed to be a place where you can do whatever you want.  and what people want it is to build empires and fight other players.  CCP's failure is that they have disincentivized owning sov to the point where wars are both cancer to fight and have no point.
---
Yikes
---
Glad you guys find them helpful - Always looking for more suggestions on content like that which is helpful for people trying to learn more about the way the game works on a fundamental level!
---
I still have my complex fullerene shard :(
---
Your salt amuses me.
---
I left mine for a few months on characters I wasn't really using.  I wasn't sure which of the three to drop them into.
---
Oh glad it’s clear.  Sherlock Holmes here has cracked the case!
---
This is an extremely brief summary of the concerns of the community. 
---
Citadels: the smallest deployable citadel, such as a Raitaru, costs about 600M ISK to buy, which is about the same as 2 T2 cruisers (very little for most people). On the other hand, in order to destroy it, you need to form a whole fleet of ships to attack it, and you need to do it three separate times over the period of about a week. On top of that, because of how citadel timers work, two of those fleets might be forced to form in australian prime time, when it's extremely inconvenient for most people to play the game. So the effort required to remove them is too large compared to their cost, and the end result is that there's way too many of them in each system.
---
Injectors: this is a mechanic that allows people to vastly accelerate their skill training by paying ISK. The result is that in modern Eve, most nullsec and lowsec pilots can fly capitals, and subcaps are made progressively more  obsolete, instead of capital ships being these rare but powerful force multipliers.
---
Why even reply tbh

Lfmao no one fucking cares you’re a complete toxic asshat and don’t really deserve much else

If they don't fight, they are pussies and/or blue donut/Serenity. If they do fight, they are pussies and/or blue donut/Serenity.
---
Quit being a little bitch.
---
T3D, T3C, HACs and capitals all see regular use. Each a somewhat time intensive skill que if you include the t2 weapons and then do several factions.
---
lol
---
Yes, we are, but not this whiny little bitch.
---
As we should?  And as they should?  Personally what’s fun about having to go all the way to cache for some fights?  Someone needs to go live in SP/WC who fancy a go round a few times a day
---
F
---
Actually, I've done some math.
---
It's almost trivially easy to get a Skiff up to like 60k EHP, without sacrificing too much mining output.
---
Worst case - assuming all Vs in all skills - a T1 fit Catalyst does like 200 DPS (According to pyfa, feel free to correct me). CONCORD response time in 0.5 is like...what? 20 seconds?
---
So assuming you could organize 20 people, you could just barely kill a single skiff before  CONCORD shows up.
---
And while I still don't get what anyone gets out of ganking in high-sec. If you can organize 20 people to kill ONE of my ships. You can have that ship.
---
Just makes me feel important.
---
Also, the fact that anyone can't Advent a NPSI fleet is a shame. You can only advert fleets to your blues or militia members.
---
This exclusivity is very bad for player recruitment and showing a new player "how eve really works".
---
Yep.. When they drop the enyos in the coke, things go boo..
---
Sov is very desirable to have - You just don't need much of it. Even in the sprawl of the N3/CFC days Sov wasn't the main objective, the main objective was getting top down income, which is something that's been steadily eliminated from the game, encouraging our current Krab-Focused null situation as that's the best way to make ISK and therefore what organisations are going to naturally gravitate towards.
---
Skill trading within the same account would still be nice to have in case someone wants to reroll for a different name/portrait. Otherwise I agree.
---
CCPLEASE fitting tool with DPS charts.
---
146k karma you think he gives a shit about a couple a dozen angry asshurt PanDaFam sympathizers??
---
Why not redeem it and simply not use the SP. it won’t expire then
---
No, afaik.
---
You have to make an eve account, you can use it with the Steam Launcher though.
---
Most of the french were pretty happy with the blackout... FYI.
---
tapi batphones, shocking I tell you shocking!
---
*citation needed
---
To be fair, if you can organize enough firepower to pop the 300k eHP Orca before CONCORD pops you, I'm fine letting you have the Orca.
---
Makes me feel important enough that so many people want me specifically.
---
lmao
---
Thank you.
---
Very much this.
---
The only reason to hold sov is to build it up and make it a relatively safer area to work in. That is nearly impossible when you can't even find out if an enemy, much less how many of them, is/are in system, or even on grid with you until he uncloaks himself...which is usually way to late to do anything about. Hell, most mining ships would be dead even before the cloaked overwatch got himself uncloaked.
---
With local the odds are admittedly a little in the PVEer's favor, but not impossible for the hunter to overcome. Without local, the scales got tipped way too far the other direction. 
---
Again, though, a person should not appear in local till they uncloak from the gate cloak.
---
It's just fantasy.
---
The Ospreys are working clearly as intended, its the same shit INIT does with boo0000oosh ravens they add higs rigs to the cheapest ship that is easily replaceable
---
What other than F1s do you have? And I fking know what youre talking about since you keep bitching about it.
---
Thanks.
---
Multiple CSM member statements on TIS?
---
They are the true heroes of Eve :)
---
Supercaps aren't a proliferation problem, they're a balance problem.
---
No one is complaining about battleship proliferation, or T2 Cruiser proliferation, even though there has always been a time where those things were rare and now everyone runs them. We might think the meta gets stale and boring when it's just Ishtars/Drakes/Muninns online, but it's not game breaking.
---
The problem with capitals and supercapitals has nothing to do with injectors, it has nothing to do with the fact that people are getting into them, or that its easier to train alts to fly them - the problem with capitals is they are insanely over powered.
---
Skill Injectors prevented this game from dying 2 years ago.
---
More like pirate.        
---
I hunt only for profitable targets and don't shoot miners and similar stuff.       
---
Stated this multiple times in many many posts.
---
I still logged in during blackout and mined and moved caps. After the cyno changes, that's why i ended up uninstalling. It made logistics too cumbersome. Cyno changes were bad. Blackout was ok for capitals, was shit for sub caps. I didn't do any sub cap pve after blackout, that was half my play style pve wise. The other half was rorqs and supers, cyno changes nuked that. They took away the ability to alternate between the two, and I just left.
---
If a non NS enemy emerges you kinda force NS to work together.
---
Actually no.    
---
Like this is 1 player vs 1 player.          
---
Bumping for sole reason of bumping someone without any goal is pettitionable and the bumper will get banned.       
---
Even if you have valid reason to bump someone you cannot also do it for long as it will fall under harassment
---
That honestly looks so fucking boring
---
No it was not. Unless all CSM members that stated goal was to help newbies bumping from structures were lying.
---
Okey I feel you have reverted to repetion cause you have nothing else to add. But its cool bro. Some actually undocked today to do what you are bitching about. So lets see if the "underpowered" actually do something or if they are just like you.
---
Any possibility of keeping new players, thus avoiding that they leave in the first few hours or days will be very good for all the game. 
---
imho UI changes won't be sufficient at all, but it's an important part of it.
---
What is the point of your entire thread here?  To highlight some Osprey fits you don’t understand dying, as intended, during an eviction?
---
My own experience is with my friend who I've played this game since 2008 with. We went everywhere together, from Spectrum in HS, to Wormholes, Provi with Daedalus X, to Serenity Initiative, and finally GSF. He was a lot more industry focused than I was, and after all these rapid changes he can't find the heart to play anymore :'(
---
old event rats  were affected
---
Well it was less that I aim for solo miners and more that before they would have seen me in local maybe 2 or 3 systems before, I would have been reported in local and they would have probably docked up and I would have found nothing, or a gang that would be setup to counter my ship.
---
Being outnumbered was too easy because they could get a jist of how many ships you would need to over power them and just do that straight away.
---
If it went this way I would prefer a gate module (structure on a gate) that would announce in local when someone enters the gate. It should be less than easy to take out, maybe about like taking out a capital ship, so a response can be made to try to save it. Once it is down, you are blind on that gate.
---
Slightly better idea would be for the announcement to be a toast message (like the message telling you damage in combat) so it fades after a few moments. AFK, not paying attention...surprise! Also no notice of who is already in system when you arrive...and any enemy already in system gets the info that you have arrived.
---
It was, I was leaving the xl shield booster on.
---
With how little input the CSM actually have, I doubt they're communicating CCP intentions.
---
Well, you do have a little more damage at close range with Tetryon.
---
With Baryon you have a little less damage, but much more versatility.
---
But if you are 100% sure that your target is not going anywhere further then 25.5km, and your next target will be this close too and etc. - Tetryon is slightly better, yes.
---
My point is that I am fine with trading 6.5% dps to 57% increase in optimal. Yes, it's not maximum available performance on short distance, but I can live with that)
---
The mechanic of being unable to warp when going 2x you speed really sucks on the undock. Please don't make this the case for the 3 min warp timer
---
We sometimes have Orca gank fleets, they are quite fun. Bunch of people coming together to hunt whales. 
---
And this actually happened once, the whole fleet landed and the guy docked two Hulks at the Orca which then exploded with the whole thing :-D
---
Many were addicted, there was a refusal of the drug. During the darkness, the pilots came out toxins eve, now all became free.
---
Roll Tide!
---
XD =)
---
Thats a reddit move. Of course it's really funny when they forget to switch accounts and ask the question with the same account..
---
Boy oh man would making players use all different ewars on rats fuck up nullsec farming...
---
Who cares at this point. It's fine to batphone goons I just wish Tapi was able to swallow down that they have to batphone goons. Also it's a defensive timer on our part so yea they'll want all the help they can get. 
---
I know they'll say but "ncpl will come". And yes they will but acting like goons didn't steamroll them in an OFFENSIVE war. The meme is panfam is dead so why does it always get mentioned that panfam is coming?
---
ngl I didn't even look at who made the thread.
---
Who in their right mind would map their mods to function keys?
---
I once mentioned i love me some small scale vaccations once in a while. What makes you think not liking dependend nullbear sheeples would make me a dedicated smol scaler? Also which variation of the at least 20 styles of smol scale are we even talking about?
---
Well, you earned that Orca.
---
Arent you tired of being wrong?
---
It was not. 
---
Without it ccp went almost bankrupt. No ccp, no eve anymore. Or ccp with 20 people instead of how many they are today.
---
Remember 2 years ago they fire a lot of people and cancel VR stuff because no money....
---
Skill injector save the game, for some years more.
---
Remember the unspoken rules everyone. Hit that downvote button. Nothing worse than being the guy who upvotes StainGuy.
---
Is that the same division that asks themselves why the people are leaving? Maybe they are not particularly good at long term thinking.
---
IT DOESNT COUNT BECAUSE I SAY SO. BLOB BLOB BLOB. THE GAME IS STAGNENT. MY SMALL GANG PLAYSTLE IS DEAD BECAUSE I WONT RESHIP AND TRY AGAIN.
---
I needed to let that out. man i feel much better now.
---
So Ryzen 7 PRO 3700U, Vega 10 onboard gfx, can it run Eve?
---
Barely?  
---
Decently enough?
---
Checked min. system recs from website but doesn't compare well with mobile cards. Any insights?
---
&gt;All those fancy new upgrades to UI - used them all once and closed them forever.
---
Having come back to the game after a much longer break, those fancy UI improvements are amazing to get you going. The starter careers also give you a good start resource and skill wise.
---
I'm not suggesting that a wholesale EVE UI/UX  redesign is not in order, but the current NPE is a great improvement as is "The Agency" if you are looking to try something new, I would recommend giving those fancy UI upgrades another look.
---
My suggestion would be that CCP signpost in-game curated new player friendly corps / organisations / general help post NPE.
---
But
---
&gt;I just lurk here, Eve looks so cool but I don't know where to even start.
---
Suggests that OP actually starting and being happy to fail &amp; learn is the first step to joining the ingame EVE community, as the barrier to entry is a lot lower than it used to be and I'm pretty sure that plenty of peeps in and out of game would be willing to help an enthusiastic newbro.  
---
**TLDR** : UI/UX improvments are necessary.  
---
Current NPE is not all bad.  
---
Post NPE experience requires better signposting.  
---
OP should jump in anyway
---
It is not about able to warp but about the 3minute timer that will warp you any way.           
---
So if your max speed is 100 - the timer starts to tick down if you are below 200m/s and reset each time when you get over this 200m/s.
---
This is what I will miss from the blackout. The fact that more  and fairer fights at smaller scales happened out of a lack of intel.
---
Dude, it just ended, its not like people where sitting by their computers, their index finger on the mouse, 24/7 ready to login the second CCP brings back local... Ofc there will be a delay...
---
huh. I wanted to use it on the abyssal leshaks to reset the disintegrator
---
Only thing pathetic is you being this mad about what two groups are doing during their internet spaceships session. 
---
Like... you even named your account after it.
---
1) evemarketer.com
---
2) evemaps.dotlan.net
---
* Siege Structures: While active in an enemy system they slowly reduce the ADM cap of the system. Takes days if not weeks, and progress is reset/reverts quickly if killed
---
* Suppression Structure: Effectively halves a system's PvE output (decreasing number of anomalies or increasing spawn times)
---
* If local is to be removed permanently, also remove all protections against dscan, including cloaks (cloaks still work normally otherwise).
---
* Make cloaked ships only near impossible to scan down? Maybe size and cloaking module dependent so cloaked cruisers with cov ops/T2 cloak can just about be scanned down with an optimal setup while frigates are safe. Might be overpowered together with the no dscan immunity.
---
* Nullsec PvE needs to radically change so it can be both profitable and dangerous. The RoI must scale well with the danger of losing the investment or nobody will risk anything. Perhaps the solution is group driven PvE with significant 'terrain' modifications like cyno jamming or warp disrupt fields. Make it so the defender can't just leave or bring in overwhelming support at a moments notice, but require them to be in a group that has a fighting chance. The attackers meanwhile would also need to risk significant assets and open themselves up to being spotted early.
---
Yep and I don't like it
---
Not anymore. Recon cyno gets fucking wrecking balled by super. Lel
---
So you wanna like, 1v me at the sun or some shit?
---
As far as I'm aware that's how most of the NPC's work yes, they all pretty much have magic modules that do whatever ccp wanted them to do, but from what I've heard the new "diamond" NPC ships are actually fit and run like real player ships, although I'm most likely wrong
---
To be fair, even a T1 hull (Naga) can hit stuff at the lock limit (300 km). It's not at all unreasonable for NPCs (especially bs or dedicated bc/cruiser hulls) to shoot at 150+km. For example, Antem Neo, the rat bastard.
---
Hi! Not sure about APIs and such, but you might check out [Dotlan](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/) and [Evepraisal](https://evepraisal.com).
---
Dotlan is a map, and Evepraisal is a price checker. 
---
The [Eve University Wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Third-party_tools) might have some useful info for you too!
---
Agree with this... Can we have EVE classic now?
---
Oh look, its a reddit troll.
---
\*gasp\* you don't say.
---
And everyone wonders why they'd rather just blue up than do this shit all day every day.
---
But it don't affect you in any way if you are undocking.
---
Zkillboard would be graeat and EVE market data.
---
You seem butthurt, you know how long it takes to make a Reddit account? About 5 seconds
---
This is the irreparable damage they inflicted on the player base. CCP will find it difficult or impossible to recover from the poorly thought out decisions they made. This will get downvoted but holy cow is it ever true.
---
This is my take, too. Sadly the problem is 3 things that bring CCP income: injectors, people having many (paid) alts, and IMO alpha accounts, which lead to people being able to create utility characters on a larger scale for free, where before it would have required some IRL expense to get those characters started, and a significant investment of time to be able to PLEX them, which might not have been worth it if all you used them for was scouting a gate, sitting in a wormhole, or checking market prices or something.
---
Sadly, that's like CCP's entire income source right there, unless they can convince enough people to play the game with one account and pay for it. And they can sell SKINs, that's OK too.
---
r/hydrohomies
---
Great.  I have no cyno recon pilots and it's going to take me a month to get them.  Thanks CCP.
---
And the wormholers flee to their holes
---
You and me both, friend
---
Hmm I read this whole change as much as it should prevent gankers from infinitely bumping other ships so it totally works as intended. And whatever csm members said else can be whatever anyway. 
---
At least thats how it was presented to ne before the change took effect
---
There'll be some epic all or nothing triglavian thing where all of new eden has to fight to survive. But then we all fucking die or have to go to new eden II and then tada! Problem solved. New universe.
---
You sound like one of those people who always think they’re the smartest in the room
---
If you do ghost sites please remember to fit your analyzers first, no point doing explo with full tank and nothing to hack cans with
---
even if theres some magic incentive, mobilizing and fighting a war is ridiculously time consuming and exhausting...and the enemy may not even fight leaving you a region's worth of structures to grind through.
---
I was one of the few in my corp to like it but I got over it once it started effecting my long term isk making.
---
CCP announced the cyno change one month before it was introduced. They gave you a heads up equal to the time it was needed to train one. 
---
:thinking:
---
Making it impossible, really. Now any change can be instantly exploited by everyone within minutes of it happening.
---
There's no such thing as end-gameplay any more. It's all open to anyone with a credit card.
---
Adding new skills was a gate to allow older players to train those instead of core skills that newer players needed. There was always a trade-off for new chars; do I train skills for me, or for fleet, or for PVE, or for industry, etc.
---
This meant that expensive new, cool ships like Leshaks became aspirational and time was needed to get into them. It also meant that bittervets might be able to exploit those new ships in a way that isn't possible if everyone is flying them.
---
Time was the commodity you spent. Now, SP is meaningless. Time is meaningless. The Iron Bank completed his skill tree in 5 minutes on the day injectors came out.
---
If that isn't broken af I don't know what is.
---
Just fly kitey bs, and scout gates. As long as you’re in a fairly busy region the locals will have more stuff come up and won’t be able to camp you in forever
---
No, just learn to use it
---
i'll tell u about dis fist here in a second boy
---
would you say that in this moment you are euphoric, not because of some phony God's blessing but due to your own intelligence?
---
No it didn't.  I have one month *to go*.
---
Learn to math.
---
Full circle you are a retard ?
---
&lt;420grow noises&gt;
---
We don’t sleep much, All you need is pi skills
---
No I make my isk ingame. 10% of my time is spent krabbing. I krab to PvP
---
Joining a player corp is certainly the way to go!  Connecting with other players is what the game is all about.
---
One new risk it will bring with it, though, is that player corps can (and usually do) have wars declared against them, and if your new corp is at war, this means other players can shoot at you freely, even in high sec.
---
When you join a new corp, I'd recommend taking a few minutes to find out what the corp's war situation is and how they recommend learning to stay aware and defend yourself.
---
At a minimum, you'll probably want to adjust your overview settings and learn a bit from your new corpmates about how combat rules work, particularly on stations and at gates, so that you don't get caught by surprise.
---
There are also certain high-sec trade routes (Jita to Amarr via either Uedama or Niarja, for example) that warring corps will frequently camp for easy, expensive kills.  Avoiding these, or traveling in a fast ship without carrying much of value, can put you in a safer position.
---
Bottom line is that wars make being in a player corp in Eve a lot more exciting, but there's a lot of benefit in spending a little time learning to manage the risks.  Your new corp should be able to help with that.
---
&gt;  Or ccp with 20 people instead of how many they are today.
---

---
I liked blackout I think it should be a regular thing
---
^^
---
Took me a minute to remember IH are Russians and made this ten times funnier.
---
What is patitionable after the fact isn't the same as what is balanced.
---
Holding someone for 15 minutes is still unbalanced, and likely not petitionable.
---
Most games hold a lot of the complexity back and reveal it gradually to new players like layers of an onion.  Is this an option for new accounts?  Why throw the industry and PI interfaces at them straight away?  They are better than they were but still a lot to take in at first.  If you already know the game I guess there would need to be an setting to give you the full fire hose from the start in the options.
---
The ecosystem of eve cant support blackout though, at least not without some additional changes. Blackout increased risk to Cap ratting without higher payouts so many simply stoped. Subcap ratting turned into a death race to make isk before some one killed you. If they had increased payouts perhaps people would have been tempted to TRY to rat but as it was people just saw the risk vs reward. PVP entierly depends on people in space to kill if no one is doing PVE there is no one to defend and if there is no one to dfend there is no point in being in space. The problem was exaserbated by the fact that nearly every hunter is just running around in cloaked ships so it turned into a huge sub simulation with no one decloaking.  Sorry about spelling dont give a fuck.
---
shoutout to the nicest krab corp ceo i have ever met - you know who you are, and thank you for being civil mr. b ( ✿◠‿◠)

CCP, Please prolong our suffering, uwu.

So Im just gonna opt out of this one. Cause I would lose more braincells than I am willing to part with. Baaaaaaaai!:)

i use bling nestor for superior sleeper caches and  for standards also nestor so dont have to buy stratios or astero... as for sentry-gun room i use  megathron navy to tank and kill sentry turrets then nestor alt to do cans - beware on idiots that shot plasma chambers - killmail guaranteed of all in the room.

Presented where and by who?
---
Why unbalanced?        
---
Above the normal freighter bumping related to piracy.           
---
People bumped freighters to take over hauling routes, people are bumping miners if they are trying to mine 'their' ore from higsec athanor belts.            
---
From what currently we know target of this change was not relating to any of above but to NPE and new player retention.
---
Have to ask gray if he got some ideas :)
---
Calm down miner.
---
Why am i not surprised? Also if i were you i wouldn´t worry to much about the later.
---
hmm?
---
yes
---
what he really said:
---
&gt; No u
---
They can blame CCP since this is reoccurring. The result was entirely predictable and as much as we want to put the onus on whiny subscribers, we need them to play.
---
Eve players being whiny to the point of pouting when you take something from Them  was entirely predictable and should be avoided when it’s unnecessary. After enough of it, these types of snowflakes quit.
---
Fact is, I want those snowflakes in the game for 1) drama
---
And 2) just people to kill. They’re annoying, but I want them To keep playing for the health of the game.
---
No. The csm can't possibly push for one change that they claim would "help newbros" and then have it turn our that it's purpose was to help verry bitter vets. /s
---
That guy has a decent little blog there.  Sad to see people try to use it as a narrative spin to justify the eviction.  Having a keep in a tiny group with a HS static is reason enough.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Invasion Damaviks have a rocket or LM launcher.
---
They do not have unlimited cap, they **do not use the cap** for any of their modules.
---
NPCs have a %chance to repair a fixed amount (not sure about frequency) of shield/hp depending on type of tank. Emptying their cap reduces this %, that is all.
---
I am. But mostly because I'm usually the only person in that room. For some strange reason nobody likes to hang out with me for very long.
---
Here's one.  Instead of region gates between the nullsec regions, make them NS-NS static wormholes.  They spawn in the same systems as the gates were but go to random other nullsec regions.  The exit/entry systems would latch to the old region gate systems to not upset the structure of the region too much, no mass limit, and a life of.... not sure... a month maybe?  Enough time for some brutality with the new neighbors but not so long that it makes sense to put down major assets.
---
CSM didn't push for it.     
---
They got this kind of information why this change was implemented.
---
Blackout was a good incentive for me to wind down most of my accounts, their usefulness became zero so it was a logical choice. Incidentally, my play time was reduced because I also felt less incentive to log in for small gang stuff (I personally prefer medium to large fleet fights of 50-150).  I'm trying to ramp back up, but after two months of logging in 2-3 times a week for fleets while still being in coms with my friends (and playing war thunder or something else) I have found that it's just as easy to stay in coms and keep on doing those other things, incentivewise.  
---
I'm not blaming anyone/anything, I just don't feel a compelling reason to log on and play as much right now.
---
Maybe you need to quit the EU.  
---
To get the control back.
---
Apparently WH send 350 mil ISK to the blue doughnut every week...
---
36* atm
---
Ccp went almost bankrupt because they're idiots too invested in Dust514 on dead platform, Valkyrie on dead platform etc etc.
---
Ehh it's pretty much the same group of users that keeps shaping the narrative.  
---
Imo the sub is more stale than it has been over the last 5 years. No wars -&gt; no shitposting -&gt; no memes.  
---
It might just be me wearing rose tinted glasses.
---
how?
---
they did nothing good for the game, boosting newbies with accelerators would have been compleatly sufficient.
---
player based bumping is not dead, you just need to get a point on whatever you're bumping every 2 minutes or so to reset the timer. Makes it only a little harder and I agree with this. a single machariel shouldn't be able to hold a freighter "in place" for 30minutes so fleet can take time to form.
---
Sure, they lost and went from 1st place to 2nd on the server. Doesn't mean they aren't or can't be relevant.
---
Will update when i am Home.
---
Actually, Russian speech in this video about not being able to drive a tank properly is much more funnier, then subtitles :D
---
You know what this sounds like to me?
---
An easy pap.
---
not surprising coming from you
---
yes, the sub very much reflects the state of the game. but at least now people hate each other based on their playstyles. which is at least slightly more fun than people not hating each other at all.
---
[The video linked in the post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYTIzUfv__g)
---
Hey I get a shoutout!  Ty!
---
Oh shit that was good. Thumbs up
---
In the forum thread for the changes, several devs stated that this change was not *just* to solve the newbie bumping thing, but other things as well. Not sure if they explicitly stated that player base bumping was a target, but I doubt they were unaware that would happen, and it was unintended.
---
:dagger:
---
I don't think they mentioned much but they did test it by having actual player bumping during the mass test.
---
That you give people headaches? Cause you have been yourself your entire life and people around you have pointed it out?:):)
---
This is actually not a bad idea, especially now that we have separate cynos to justify not increasing the costs for jump freighters. Balancing the cost to prevent jumping tons of caps on every hostile in the region with not wanting to prevent use of caps in strategic engagements would be tough.
---
If everyone wants this apparent "2 super powers ruling null" to go away maybe everyone else should get their shit together and form a 3rd power.  If CCP want to stir shit in null they'd fuck off with these sov mechanics and fuck with null resources so we have REASONS to all hate each other.
---
Yes. Very much. I dont like ultrakrabbers more than anyone else and I massively dislike the Rorq meta but I do enjoy its benefits. So 100 to 0 is just gonna break the game and just for some ideological idea of what Eve should be. Thats BS, it was clear it wouldnt work.
---
But I really hope they start fixing some shit.

/u/StainGuy for 1 billion isk per freighter I will provide enough warp scrambling alts to reset the timer until you can gank him (up to 30 minutes because I have other things to do). Message me any time and I'll make a couple more alpha accounts for this purpose.
---
Thanks in advance for your business.
---
So when is this exactly ?
---
&gt; They are the very thing that allowed the faucets to *be* opened full bore. 
---
As if people didn't farm isk full bore beforehand. Selective memory here my friend. 
---
&gt;There were a very finite number of rorq, titan, and super pilots available in game, and they traded hands as that finite thing on the EVE O forums. 
---
What nonsense. reedit post from before skill injectors-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2micw3/this\_is\_what\_super\_capital\_proliferation\_looks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2micw3/this_is_what_super_capital_proliferation_looks/)
---
So there was somehow no supercapital proliferation before 2016 was there when skill injectors were introduced? Without skill injectors you would still have the same problems today and probably less players to boot.
---
Did this also.
---
I  have been saying this over and over - this can be solved by putting a "cool down" timer on the ability to inject.
---
I can see this as easy solution - however I realize this is an impact to overall revenue for CCP but is the right thing for the game.   
---
I like the idea too of a 'skill starter' injector for base critical skills but after that the scaling cool down timer kicks in.   You can still use them but not consecutively without a delay in between - skill injector "fatigue" if you will.    
---
The delay could be set up to prevent bot accts from injecting into a rorq in a day and you could  make the delay proportional to current skill point total, i.e. delay is shorter for less  skilled character and longer for more skilled but enough delay on the low side to prevent 3 day rorqs etc.  
---
Stretch the low end delay enough to make it a pain for bot accts but not oppressive to real players.
---
It gets extremely tiring when you take the time to reason and argument with someone, and all you get back is "lolololol risk averse nullbear go suck mittani you are cancer" over and over.
---
Fucksake not more fucking structures
---
Stop supers from being built for some time to make them into the rare beasts they should be.
---
I think Blackout \[for me a cancellation of Blackout long before it should have been\] has been the crux of the current problem.
---
Not evem 3 years ago or so when this change was first anounced by ccp?
---
&gt;Citadels were a mistake
---
Not putting a limit on where and how many, yes
---
&gt;Allowing multiboxing was a mistake
---
That has been allowed since more or less day1 and has been a source for additional money for ccp. 
---
&gt;Capitals being able to zoom across the galaxy was a mistake
---
You clearly havent seen caps before the jump fatigue days. 10 ly range and you only needed to regen the cap to jump, aka full regen fit supercaps able to jump again after like 10 seconds

Hey, I feel you. And I see you’ve got horde flair, so I’m gonna assume that’s real and congratulate you on being smart and hooking up into a newbro Corp.   
---
I’ll share something from my first year of experience: it can be frustrating that even in a newbro Corp it will take 6-12 months of training to get into a lot of doctrines. That’s ok. Don’t get frustrated by “only” being able to fly tackle and eWar. I can pilot a muninn and an eagle and sometimes I just want to go back to flying a maulus or crucifier because you do learn more about spatial awareness and being a bit independent from this F1 dps kids.   
---
First year can be long, but in retrospect I learned a ton and soaked up a lot. I hope you find the same.
---
Its honestly been other games for me and my friends. Girlfriends demand that we play ark soweto play ark
---
Montolio was merely a setback
---
Prolonged the game? I would like to see your work and data on how that statement is true. Since the game came out, its player base climbed. The only drop in player base is when they introduce stupid shit like the broken T3 cruiser(until recent fix) and drastically increased rewards in nullsec. While butt fucking ever other gameplay which made eve a sandbox to begin with. Eve investing all their advertising into null gameplay and large fights ultimately hurt itself. Yes it brought in carebears gamers but killed the core players that the game needed. 
---
So no, skill injectors didn’t save shit and contributes to the cancerous stagnant carebear players we have today. If eve was a person, the carebears are tumors and chaos changes is the attempt to remove it.
---
In the long term, we're all dead anyways.
---
Let me introduce you some system always blackout : WHORMOLE
---
I have found myself needing to refer to the client less, but i still pvp
---
Agreed with all points here. Not trying to shit on the UI by any means, all QOL changes are welcome, but in my personal experience it's not where the shoe is pressing hardest.
---
NPE is okay, but heres the clue I was/am struggling with. After you pass through the NPE virginity and continue build yourself into a useful pilot there's a massive amount of hurdles that isnt experienced as 'achievements' but rather just a intricate and unsexy grind with pointless remaps. Like seriously what is the point of remaps again? We can all agree house cleaning is boring but its a necessary evil and for whatever reason EvE really need one because it's really messy. Chaos era - more like MESS era.
---
I haven't seen it. I still have my launcher load on the right side of the screen with only the accounts showing on screen since the day they forced the Adverts Online launcher onto us all.

I call that content, isnt it whats eve is about xD
---
How about the game was boring before, during, and after the blackout and people left because CCP was failing to make the game fresh?

I have a suggestion, keep your suggestion posts to yourself because they are bad.

Hey look another junior game developer who cant read stickied threads.

Ships will now automatically enter warp after three minutes of attempting to align and reach the required speed.
---
    This will now put a maximum cap on how long a ship can be bumped or stuck on geometry.
---
Here it is from the official forums. It states being bumped OR stuck on geometry like stations and other things. For me it means that there is offensive bumping included.

---
I never seen a problem with them aside from being able to use them on cap skills. I think they are a great way for new bro's to catch up in certain aspects. People need to realize new players get turned away when they learn they need to spend a month (idk the actually time, just a guess) just training the magic 14. While some may snuff at that, it slows down the speed in which new bro's can do stuff and that's a turn off from them.

Based on the time this was posted goons did not help their ~allies~ neutral neighbours because panfam was coming down ;)

That's why i said to blocs, I personally had ~6 cyno ceptor alts staged around our deployment before the Change, now im down to 1 recon alt.

Thank you. This is so true. 
---
In order to fully experience the game, a player needs more than one sub running. This puts off newer players.
---
Alts  also unbalances wealth generation, to the point where more irl money = more isk (aka p2w).
---
Alts have also killed player cooperation. Instead of needing friends in faxes when flying caps, it is instead mandatory to have another fucking account to fill that role yourself.
---
Alts also enables skill injectors. Because "I'm not gonna wait a year to fly a fax for my existing titan lmao".
---
By limiting alts, caps are limited, and so is wealth. Corps and alliances will have to compete for the playerbase in order to sustain wealth and force.
---
But fuck, I bet the majority of CCP's subs are alts so we will never see a limit.
---
Come to FW! It's fun, feel free to PM me
---
new bros shouldn’t be able to go from rookie ship to a titan in a day
---
it breaks the fucking game, it defeats the entire purpose of skill queues
---
after 16 years i still love this game and all in all i believe that it will find its way to stay in our hearts for 16 years to come.  
---
i appreciate the time all the people who in my alliance (and other alliances as well) take to make the best of creating content, taking time out of their lives to refuel gates, make fleets and spreading the good vibes to silence to bad ones.  
---
even though there is a lot up for debate and a lot of worries out there about the current state of the game, we share the love for internet spaceships and each and everyone matter.  
---
i still am not good at solo pvp but i enjoy both dying and getting the occasional kill, and i love all of you who dont talk trash because you were better and/or smarter than me.
---
Your problem is you assume people leave (and thereby eve is dying) for X reason because the people \*you know\* left for X reason. 
---
You completely discount that other people join and/or stay for completely different, and valid reasons. 
---
Oh and before you go all "reeee Krabs" like you always do, I dont PvE in this game at all (mostly small gang pvp as late USTZ is crap for much else). I realize that other people enjoy the PvE and that any changes made to the game to encourage PvP cant be "all stick and no carrot". 
---
If CCP wants to win some people back, they could do worse than focusing on Lowsec for a while. Create a small gang PvP playground that has good carrots that draw people in to low-cost pvp (getting their feet wet) with good \*rewards\* for actually Pvping.
---
No. Not everyone wants local for defensive purposes only. No locals just for gankers. Npc 0.0 is like null on training wheels why make that even worse than sov null. Alternatively theres already space that has no local where you could go roam instead of dragging everyone else into a style they dont want to play.
---
It is not hard, to unfuck the game. Actually its pretty easy. And that blackout, was a good first step. The problem is the path, to free to play, that ccp , has since almost the beginning, 2007 or so, with the implementation of plex , that ccp , has begun taken.
---
ccp doesnt give about the botters,. However were they do care about the whales, that come with free to play.  The guys of instant gratification.  Cutting them lose, thats something that ccp is still not willing to do at this moment. And they were the ones, that did not like the blackout. So that hurt ccp balance sheet. 
---
Im wondering if hilmar, will stay ceo.
---
if you are not a dummkopf you would ofcause turn off your 100mn AB when enemies enter local and start aligning out which should make sure you are far gone before enemies land on you,  
---
and you can get a more "fair" isk income from a Myrm if i may say so, i do agree it was good for newbros but it was quite possibly TOO good if you ask me, it was so good that people just kept doing it, why get a larger and more expensive shit when the gain was so little compared to the VNI? a good VNI pilot can do like 25m ticks (some have claimed more but i havent seen it unless it was faction spawns) and a decent rattle pilot can only do like 33m... so why risk the larger more expensive ship? it just seems like the VNI was too easy and too good to get into.
---
According to[ this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d6qeqi/this_is_fucking_disgusting_gsf_and_their_pets/) goons were coming to utterly blob this fight. In the end we had less subs than Panda and friends and no caps while they formed a very impressive super/titan fleet. We jumped into Frat staging hoping for a fight but they didn't offer one, which is fine, they aren't required to. Test reffed most of their space and then [we killed some frat caps we caught](https://zkillboard.com/br/111563/) and went home.
---
Gotta agree this shit is annoying and it isn't even showing much relevant information about the item your hovering over that you would have to look at it's info to find out anyways. Mostly just tells you, you need omega and/or train this skill to use...
---
You literally spend half your time moving the mouse to the outer borders before trying to select something so the pop up window doesn't block the item you we're trying to click. Causing you to have to move your mouse and wait for it to disappear again.
---
Then you get into accidentally clicking stuff and find out you have had your skill queued messed up days before training skills you never wanted.
---
Nothing like wanting to cringe every time you got to do something simple in this game.
---
They had around 250 goons along for the timers. I'd guess 30 of those in the deployed sig, 220 in whatever fleet they roamed over with.
---
Nice form up then.
---
That's the thing - I'm not trying to be malicious. I only call you out when you say absurd things or your head gets too big.

Nah.  It's Inner Hell leading the charge.  This is what they do, and they do it very well.  HK/LZHX are late additions to the party, and aren't quite as adept as IH.

Personally i dont want to have to be pigeonholed into wh space. Why not spruce up npc null sec by making it a hybrid system.
---
Not to mention his ideas aren’t even pro blackout they’re just poorly thought out and bad. Why implement one sided blackout ( local tied to module you need to be blue to see local ) instead of either going all or nothing? 
---
Bad, low effort post.
---
Apparently, your sig really bothers them. They keep talking about it on Reddit. Reavers are scary people.

Because most people if they wanted no local would go to wormholes.

I know, I don't like injectors, but it's too late and they make too much money to get rid of.

Why I literally said within the first few words injectors should not work on cap skills
---
Are you blind?
---
I like gates and regular mechanics. Npc null is mostly empty anyway so why not spruce it up. Imo expanding the blackout to npc null could help in that endeavor.
---
Well we was hanging out for a while, you know just waiting for you guys to undock and do something, so while we waited we just reffed about 1/3 of detorid and when it was painfully clear that apparently you guys did'nt want to fight us with your numbers advantage we took our toys and marched back home, Good fight? enjoy your "Win?" see you next time!

The obvious elephant in the room. I've lived in wormhole space. It's boring, it's empty, it's safe and its trash. I don't like it. Living in null is more fun so I choose to live there and do my pesky little baits, cancer multiboxing strats, cloaky camps, troll entosis baiting, low power structure bashing with a super for the dank T2 citadel mods, and blops drops. 
---
Take it away and I lose my content (none of which involves krabbing ironically) and I don't log in.
---
I'm not interested on wh, high, or low sec.  I've developed my play style after years and years of paying to play this game. 
---
To CCP: If my money is not important just prove it once more, and I won't force the burden of it upon your corporation.
---
I like the idea of  no local unless you have deployed anchorable intel units with T1 only giving numbers in system and T2 version all pilots in system but only to anchoring corp unless hacked.  Anyone can deploy one of these regardless of sov, taking a few minutes to deploy.  Able to be destroyed but with fair amount of HP.
---
Pilots of Covert Ops ships shouldn't show in local if cloaked and will only appear in local when decloaked, combat recon pilots shouldn't show in local, nor Black OPs at any time.
---
Press F1 on the broadcasted target, press F on the targeted rock....

What the fuck is the difference at this point?

Is mine room worth it? I only get 2 cans after I hack the  Remote Defense Grid Unit and they drop little in loot.
---
this dont work for me, what is it?
---
Hey its gone and numbers keep going down. Perhaps it was not lack of local but the blue donut and shitty citadel mechanics that drove people away. There were lots of old players like me who came back specifically for the blackout. Im sad to see it gome and would love it back permanently in npc null sec

(I haven't checked reddit for 8 days)

Titan ratting actually isn't more effective than supercarrier ratting, and in some systems even carrier ratting is more effective because respawn time of sites is the limiting factor. The only benefit of titan ratting is that its fewer clicks (And having done it, its kinda cool to titan rat, me being someone who remembers a time when people just had titans in POSes).

---
yes yes of course that was not your original plan

Doubt it was the citadel and Donut's (Plural BTW) as the slops match to the implementation of the Blackout and Cyno changes exactly. Plus we have multiple first hand reports of people leaving and specifically saying its the blackout and cyno changes that caused it. Hell even the person who spearheaded the change OlmecaGold has admitted it was a bad idea badly implemented and that its hurt the game long term but yeah, donuts caused the player drop grrr.

You have to know where the cans are to decloak them i think. There are 5 i believe and hitting up the RGDU reveals any number of them randomly.

The blackout gave us hope for a better future in eve and hopefully in selected places it could return like npc null sec.

The only way you'll learn is by trying. And the times you fail are the ones you'll learn the most from.
---
TEST has a bot in O3- that constantly spams people with invites to a fleet so they can attempt to warp you off tether.  The bot is usually in Horde or a neutral alliance.  The spam starts the moment a character logs in or jumps into system.  Replies sent to CCP have basically said "There are ways to block unwanted fleet invites."
---
No it isnt. Not when the side with less is willing to fight.
---
Have Worse Numbers: WAHHHH YOU BLOBBED \*sad face\* \*Crying face\*

Have Better Numbers: TAPI Y U NO FITE ME?
---
They kicked me out of the SUAD discord for joking about not playing EVE and playing Minecraft instead with Mekju. So just kinda shows how much damage control Sashi and all the other nerds that think that SUAD should revolve around EVE specifically when yall pretty much all hate the game and the core of the group has all gave up on it and now all you have is a bunch of nerds that got buttoned in cause they had a fax alt and have the vocal majority cause no one cares enough to speak up any longer. Imagine telling someone that if they don’t agree fully with your political/ LGBTQ views they can’t be in the corp. 
---
Basically it’s not just the game, it’s the environment your in. SUAD was a community of people that enjoyed playing eve together and that’s what kept us playing, now what benefit is there to bring in SUAD?
---
Empire builder btw
---
Dont abuse this flaw in gaming mechinic. Do u realise it acutally occupy a lot of resource from server?
---
Hot take farms and fields was CCP's biggest mistake - Even worse than Rorquals/Skill Injectors. It took the drive of Nullsec from being objective based offensive PvP to home defence PvP dissuasion.
---
No, I'm pretty sure I can read and I can listen. In most of those instances, it's your shitty writing skills that are the cause of the misunderstanding. Which is why I ask "did you really just say that" and then you invariably explain what you meant instead of what you wrote.
---
I hate to say it but a lot of null-sec warfare is aimed at making people stop playing the game. That's how you mostly beat the enemy.
---
So a script when mining is an unforgivable dirty botter
---
A non afk myrm or vni is an unforgivable dirty botter
---
But a script that spams invites to everyone in a system.... Is legit gameplay 
---
Wot
---
Whining about toxicity in eve and using yikes unirionically
---
This game really is going down the drain
---
You lie so fluently it’s odd.
---
I've been saying this tho right, you can't really avoid being ganked by a determined ganker. If they want to kill you the only thing you can do is avoid them to not die.
---
Yes it is fuckwad. It's just "How many numbers can we pull. Relatively close? Punt it and spin narrative
---
Do those pay big money?
---
I am Jack's love of eve.  
---
I get cancer.  
---
I kill Jack.
---
Weird flex but OK.
---
I don't see how is it meant to be a counter point to what i said.
---
EVERYTHING THATS NOT ME IS BOTS. Ok retard
---
1 person manually inviting people not in a fleet using the free intel of local is not abusing a flaw in a game mechanic. Using your position in an alliance to mass report (against the TOS) mechanics your brain is too tiny to comprehend is more than questionable.
---
Not true at all
---
I want no local and live out of 0.0 Null. Local in 0.0 allows intel bots to report when anyone logs in to nearby sov space so they know to dock the fuck up even before you get a hunter in system.
---
Ok smooth brain
---
I didn't say bring it back to all 0.0 only to select area which are mostly empty anyways. What harm would be caused by that? Spice shit up. 
---
Its more a build up people were bored and the only thing that kept them going was farmville in space. U took that away and people understandably left eve. But if the blackout was coupled with a better npc ratting system or redone sov. It could have reinvigorated the pvp side of things.
---
As said just mske npc null sec blackout and ill be stocked. Otherwise this vet and id imagine lots more aren't coming back. Maybe the eve we remember and cherish will never return.
---
A new capital? Fuck yes I can't wait
---
It was always inevitable that the Gauls would take over the empire.
---
Have people considered just not accepting random fleet invites?
---
I just started getting back into PI and I already want to die all over again. SUGGESTIONS:  
---
1. COPY/PASTE STRUCTURE TEMPLATES - Even if not with the links and everything, at least the building layout. Shareable templates preferred.
---
2. EXPANDABLE, NON-SHRINKING STRUCTURE MENU - For the love of Jita stop making me scroll down a hundred times to do the same thing over and over again. Let me expand the structure menu. I just want to make my routes.
---
3. DRAG AND DROP ROUTE CREATION AND EXPEDITED TRANSFERS - This is the big one. I see no reason that this is not feasible, either. Let me drag a resource from the Storage or Products tab to a destination structure to create a route. Let me drag a resource from one storage to another and cause an automatic Expedited Transfer. Put up a warning/confirmation prompt if you need to, but please give my finger a break from all the double clicks and having to slog through multiple menus to perform a single action.
---
This old chestnut. A good leader accepts they lost, moves forward. I feel bad for you that you have to lie and try to make it go in your favour.
---
Hope you're okay, eve is a game, meant for fun 👍
---
then why were we running a jackdaw fleet 3 and a half hours ago
---
A corp i was in fell appart, some of the lads reformed and invited me to tag a long. They’re a great bunch, and i love them to bits. A few days ago, i talked with a buddy of mine whom is one of the very first people i flew with in eve, his corp is moving to greener pastures, and he invited me to come fly with them. 
---
Eve can be a tedius and slow process game, but damn, all of that, is made worth by the people i fly with.
---
People have always been farming ISK at near-max capacity. With skill injectors, that capacity was just extend to infinity. Which is the real problem.
---
Also, do you really think supercap "proliferation" before and after injectors is at all alike? Look at that image you posted. Now look at that image from the goon moveop for the burning of tribute. Now think about the fact that the first image is 10+ years of production and the second is from just about 3.
---
No Vanqs. Hmm:)
---
They would still be gated an masse and used for defence in system.
---
Spin to win.
---
Even that is an issue, since too many exist allready
---
Hmm its gay. Mega this super that. Rorquals.
---
Wanna try some munnins online?
---
Alright. You are the god of this sub and Eve so sure. Fairly certain Ive been in enough big fights to contradict your statement but fkit, youre right.
---
I did accept that we didnt win the timer, but none of what i said was a lie
---
I bet if FRT dropped the cyno jammer the fight woulda happened. Each side plays their game.
---
Thank you for realizing your station in life
---
Outforms their enemy and doesnt feed for once - smugs about like they won evertything.
---
why do you need a script to right click invite on a character in local (thanks ccp) when they undock from a structure
---
Fuck you.
---
Like supercap umbrellas and turbokrabing is healthy.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
That's fair enough but this convo tree isn't about that. You imagined me making the entire krab vs pvper discourse about me vs goons when I was just using myself as an example.
---
Oh how I wish you understood yours.
---
Butt mah drake
---
Inviting 1300 people at the same time? Er... How many hands do u have? I dont see how u can MANUALLY done it.
---
BTW if TEST can use bot to spam fleet invitation.
---
Why WC cannot let its members report this spam to CCP?
---
Considering each turret normally corresponds to a location on the hull where the turret fires from, do these actually have visibly locations with turrets that the player-used model doesn't have? I was always under the impression the turret hardpoints were part of the model and the same one was used across NPC and PC.
---
please bring the blackout but in highsec
---
Lol Sophie isn't a script
---
Why do you need a script to loot a wreck before it even spawns ongrid?
---
You can’t invite 1600 people at once without it, and can’t do it 23/7 without it.  :)
---
Shut up! You are killing the narrative! Chinese evil! Frt evil!
---
I require more spin. Please spin better. Something like....  
---
[Vily's Actual Plan](https://imgflip.com/i/3b2zlf)
---
Neither are people who have zkillboards of NOTHING but pve hunting
---
you do realise you can invite everyone in your local list right...?
---
Then you have no problem with us being toxic and not playing anymore right?
---
You don't need us, so why bother replying.
---
Except the biggest defense umbrella in nullsec ALWAYS thought and played like that. Even back when carriers had drones. It started before Jump Fatigue went in. PL had an agreement not to drop supers in Imperium territory, and The Imperium wouldn’t farm the ever living fuck out of their renters. Therefore the meta was carrier ratting with cynos, supers and titans would occassionally respond, but mainly subcaps on a bridging titan. BL got a few carrier wipes out of GSF over it.
---
That was deep culture in prefozzie sov. Hence the “Ju- standing fleet” moniker persisting in delve. The changes for bottom up farms and field/ just positioned a superior organizational culture to succeed beyond others. 
---
You may disagree with me based on feelings, but this is factually accurate. Your analysis is therefore inaccurate at best, wrong at worst. If you would like to discuss this, I would be open to citing more examples.
---
It's the same feeling in W-space.  You know people are watching you, but you can't see them so you feel safer.
---
What you do is your business, I have no problem with anything beyond me enjoying eve
---
And if you have the balls to admit it, you’re the same.
---
"Valid Game Mechanics"
---
You are spamming fleet invites to people every single day with rotating characters.   Spamming invites has been considered an exploit for Many years and has a long history of people being reprimanded for it.  Swapping characters every couple days does not make you immune to this.
---
And I've tested to see its a script before. I undocked 4 characters at as close to the same exact time as I possibly could, in different ships/capitals so that i dont spawn all in the same place. ALL 4 characters had fleet invites before I even fully  undocked and loaded grid. There's actually no way this is possible without scripting
---
Enjoy your ban, get fucked etc.
---
Numbers weren't that different. 1200 vs 1000 roughly, plus whatever was lurking in other staging areas. That's not an outblob.
---
I know plenty if noobs that would just drop the game had it not been for injectors.
---
Yeah.  You can also mine for 20 hours a day
---
You do realize that... right?????
---
i enjoyed feeding cheap rifters to the cynabal gang running from our response fleets in r10 last night i wasn't sure if they got bored or ran out of ammo i still have a whole stack if they get hungry (◕‿◕✿) luvuguys

This worked on my Hel, thanks for the tip.

IEPITAN TITAN WORLDSHIP HERE WE COME
---
That joke of a person, and I'm not saying player, has been back playing for 2 months and has almost 700 posts where the top used words are: idiot, moron, fuck, stupid, me, I'm and no. Is it any shock that this is the level of conversation you are having with an obvious narcissist with a massive inferiority complex?
---
Complaining about good Diplomatic relations in Eve.  This is why the say the best ship in Eve is Friendship.  Maybe the trolls just lashing out over their personal lack there of?
---
Is your Ctrl and A key broke on your keyboard?
---
There are multiple parts in the video where he has no target locked and the drones are still on someone.
---
"Legit customers". That was funny. Their titanfleet certainly came from legitimate sources.
---
Are your brain dead or what ?:) did you realize they can be autoaggro by some random vigil
---
God damn you’re dumb. Ctrl a local list, invite to fleet
---
When it comes to Structures, I think only Citatels should have asset safety. They are basically the base, the safe spots, but all other specialised structures should not be that safe. 
---
And when it comes to tethering, this should be turned to be a service (to which Citatels could have a fuel bonus for). If you want tethering on your structure, equip it and pay for the fuel. With this tethering will also get disabled on low powered structures
---
deez nutz affect npcs
---
Well yeah. What did you expect?
---
I mean, I don't get gankers at all; but seriously what did you expect? That your mining barge which has no weapons and probably only some light scout drones could have a stand up fight against anything that isn't a frigate belt rat?
---
Ctrl A invite to fleet
---
Cough
---
why not
---
Bro.  People call everything that even considers pve for more than 5 minutes a bot
---
But you’re seriously telling me you want to believe people who attentively invite and fleetwarp all day every day are legit?
---
It’s MORE boring than mining.
---
Ironic discord name lmao
---
It does not prove a thing. The thing is, some rats can be nossed, some can't - at all.
---
cap warfare just sucks in PVE.
---
And repeat for 20 hours straight 7 days a week
---
Sure... Go defend macro miners with this enthusiasm
---
So now there will be a post on reddit for each ping by gsf? Is it so rare?
---
what the fuck is EO
---
Goons left the north to take delve.
---
NCPL invades farmed Test and CO2 until the left the north.
---
Test/CO2 formed legacy and kicked the twitching husk of stainwagon out of the south.
---
Tri decided they wanted to be relevant again and convinced CO2 that they should CO2 the rest of legacy. CO2 was then CO2’ed by the Judge and disbanded.
---
Then some alliance that only existed for a cup of coffee all but killed DRF and joined with Tri to poke legacy, who at the time was DRF’s ally. PL when oh bro, bro, bro, let us have some of that!! Pushing test to goons, goons then counter invaded NC’s territory in the north, test and villy with the excellent use of tether and DD mechanics tbh, forced PL/tri/skill super fleet to tank till node crash.
---
Some other fights happen but most of the invasions stopped. Eve sucked alliances collapsed, only fight going on is ongoing skirmishes between legacy and Chinese group fraternity that everyone is now trying to dogpile in cause that’s what you do in eve.
---
I did not know this. Thank you stainguy
---
Because while he and other of his constituents "gets it" when pressed. It is not his default mode of thinking. So in this last reply I painted HIM with an unfair inflammatory broad brush. Of course he didn't like it and stopped replying because thats his way. 
---
If he's elected and he's representing the player-base I'd appreciate his head out of his ass while he's doing it.
---
Thats actually impressive. 
---
I just realised that like 80% of all the toxicity on this sub comes from a handful of "players". So hes actually helping me make my r/eve more pleasant by being himself.

Pretty sure you've been playing the game long enough to know that you can just mass-invite people from a channel list like local. You don't need a script for that.
---
A million times yes
---
228 Titans 169 supers... Thats all kinds of dumb and am thankfull I don't play "that" game anymore.
---
lol read r/eve rule, plz. No hatred in here.
---
No they weren't.
---
You're not wrong that the concept of a defensive supercapital umbrella is pretty damn old - But that wasn't the focus of the military organisation, at least from my experience, as the majority of strategic alliance income wasn't generated from that source. Renting and moons were how you made large scale ISK, not by taxing your duders, which is how you make ISK now.
---
That's not to say ISK drives war, traditionally hellwars have been fought over the more intangible cause of "Fuck those people we don't like them", which has eroded over time as people are forced to work together over time - But those lower level conflict drivers which had a real, measurable meaning behind them for the FCs who poked at them were a hell of a lot better for forcing fights than content Astras/content RFs, by my experience.
---
No i didn't. why do people keep thinking this? I literally said my position like 60 times in this response thread. 
---
You can avoid getting ganked, but none of the things you can do to avoid getting ganked qualifies as fight back.
---
At least they didn't take a screen shot of their phone while trying to take a picture of the monitor.
---
Which tool allows to have your other eve client windows there?
---
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for the entire universe is zero.
---
Kinda puts things into perspective
---
I still log in everyday the same as before, during and after blackout. Most of our alliance does the same and we continue as before adjusting to the changes as needed.
---
Just make sure to switch up what you do for pve so you don't burn yourself out.
---
Regardless of all the comments on why put up a Keepstar, we did it, and I am damn proud of my guys for pulling it off.  It was inevitable that there be fights over it, and losing it was always a very real possibility, and actually quite likely.  It was named after a lost corp member that a lot of folks know, and to us, its the idea that matters.
---
Did the fight go down as we expected?  Nope, not at all.  I won't debate the validity or repercussions of "why" to evict folks, that horse has been beat to death.  IH had exceptional wh control and proved one of our main assumptions wrong, that the HS static would always allow us to get folks in, so kudos to them.  But in the end, who gives a shit, its a game.  Castles go up, castles come down, just ask the invaders in this case.  Lol.  We are trying to fight as best we can, haven't SD'd all our shit, nor did we unanchor it.  In fact we anchored fully accepting the risks.  Its all good.
---
No regrets, no tears, and nobody cares about the trolls either, but I am sure they will continue in an effort to try and make themselves relevant, so have at it.  I am anxiously awaiting the "we are so awesome and caused this thing and they are broken pathetic losers" blah blah blah post.
---
I still think that the 3 invaders are doing this just to remember what a Keepstar looks like.  ;)
---
Fly safe, and we will see you out there.  o7

-Nash MacAllister
---
Find me one rat that is unnosable then. Just one normal rat (ie not diamond, haven't tested them but they have a lot of different rules to them than normal rats) that can't be nosed. 
---
Until then because i have tested it extensively i will maintain that you can nos rats as long as the conditions are right.
---
He doesn't understand that it is a valid choice. He is thinking emotionally, not logically.
---
yes there is an easy fix for this you can remove the offending monitors from your system by defenestration or bludgeoning
---
Fk these guys. Theyll just pull you down.
---
You guys tried and most, if not all, appreciate your efforts. I bet this was superhard on the FC team so thanks for putting in the effort guys. Well be ready for the next run.
---
Systems were cyno jammed -&gt; they could reship, Legacy could not. Would be stupid to fight that.
---
Our valued allies
---
Their blobbing F1 monkeys
---
You can also try neuting out the frigs, in order to turn off their mwd, and hope you can apply dps to them then.
---
it's getting worse and worse ;-)
---
MMmmm!  &lt;smacks lips&gt;  Salty!!
---
Frat's bots set to auto join fleet invites?
---
The biggest thing I’m not seeing is lowsec/npc null moon squabbles. Right now, large alliances have been renting out moons and top downing income that way.
---
Stront timing miner citadels might bring this back. Adjusting low power mechanics would definitely make it painful to neglect a moon.
---
Home defense was always a content driver that gsf used to cultivate skirmish fcs and then Cap -&gt; supercap candidates. If people sucked at keeping cool and making good decisions during HD engagements, they probably weren’t going to be good at babysitting coalitions wide superbabies.
---
This is the best idea for skill injectors I've seen.  The moment I read it was straight SP I thought to myself "How is this going to help new players who can't afford them?"

Big brain shit there

Eh a good leader is beating their fucking asses in their home fucking region.

Pixel 2, rooted, 8.1.0, runs fine. I'd love the Simulate Fit options, which might also require the inventory to be available (which I'd also love), otherwise, nicely done.
---
I... would very much want to play this
---
Yes, just note that when my buddy wanted to help kill sentries with his carrier, the archive room insta nuked his fighters, bypassed the immunity of killing one fighter, it just nuked the entire wing in one server tick. But also keep in mind that at tat point the archive room was hella stacking explosions to equal around 25k dps.
---
I can vouch we were all in for going head on for a fight if they offered one.. Asher and the leadership team were 100% dedicated to throwing every ship we had into a fight
---
Spinning till you’re **blue** in the face.
---
I'll PAP my ALTs in fleet with yours.
---
I Will try it with my naglfar then :)

Maybe u should have offered the smaller corps a spot in legacy.. don’t think they liked only getting provi status. Please go revamp ur offer and try again

---
That's a hypothetical dude.  You asked *how* that data could be true and I provided an example case.  I even tried to meet you halfway by hypothesizing that ganking was also a turnoff.
---
There's no assumptions in that data at all - the fact is simple that X% of players are retained from the general population, and Y% are retained from the ganked population, and Y &gt; X.  There's no assumptions there, that data point exists, and you're not allowed to handwave it away and ignore it because it doesn't suit your narrative
---
When the allies invaded Normandy they fed dis information campaigns that told the nazis that the main invasion force would come thru anywhere besides Normandy. Operation bodyguard worked to a huge success.  
---
Feel free to use your publicly fed information and ascribe whatever element of failure you feel appropriate to maintain your shitty narrative.  
---
You guys are getting the door kicked in in nearly a dozen systems in detorid.  
---
That keepstar will die.  
---
Assimilate or... be blues
---
You mean to say that accepting random fleet invites while I'm on the undock in my staging system while flying my vanquisher is a bad idea?!
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, I just don't get your point.
---
I mean yeah. You can't fight them, this is just fact. What did you expect? 
---
Honestly I'm not trying to troll or anything here, I legitimately don't understand what you're getting at.
---
I want you to know I MASHED that upvote bro.  Cracked my phone screen.
---
So basically stockpile titans and wait for the next pl+friends vs gon war?
---
Gettin desperate mate
---
im not sure if e is worth it... i mean if i pick a religion i want to make sure its the best of course
---
like do i respawn and is there an afterlife and does e offer family packages or flexible contracts so i can choose what "services" i need and which i dont?
---
Thanks for answering my question!!! :D that took 22 hours of random stuff about why it will never be built before someone answered.
---
We alarm clock everyday dumbass
---
Yeah. Change isn't neccessarily bad in fact I believe EVE needs change although I am not sure in what way. I think it is very good that they tried but even better that they realized that shot missed. Hopefuly it does not discourage them from trying things in the future.
---
Show me video of 1300 people being mass invited in the same tick. Any evidence at all beyond you throwing around bullshit accusations with no proof. 
---
We treat fleet invites like fishing, just casually hanging out and inviting when there's nothing going on, and teasing each other when we do or don't get a target. And somehow, unbelievably, your idiot alliance members keep falling for it.
---
You've have been reporting us for months. The GMs are probably tired of investigating us by now, they haven't found anything yet and they're not going to. It's not cheating, it's darwinism. You boys really are just that stupid.
---
I mean they posted it on reddit so it must be true right?  
---
-PanDaFam logic
---
But I only get fleet invite during the black screen of the undock, never when I'm docked. Does test local do not show people who are docked up?
---
does Ctrl A distinguish between docked and undocked?
---
how do you know that they are docked or undocked?
---
Coming back after a few months to have a billion isk worth of assets locked away because of a sov change is not good for the economy either. 
---
This just happened to me, several years of playing, just locked away in a station I can’t dock in.
---
NPCs will lock and fire on you from thousands of km away, longer even than carriers can lock.  I've had them shoot at me from a *different celestial* when they're close enough to see on the new huge grids.  Amusingly, every once in a great while they'll still hit their .1% or whatever chance for a wrecking hit, too.

Ok, I was just wondering since we're 4 friends that have started playing if it would be viable to start grinding in order to get enough to get one of our accounts to omega and then try and end up grinding all our accounts to omega.
---
I was also wondering, can an omega player buy a ship and then give/sell it to an alpha player?
---
And since we're talking about ships, which ships can an alpha player buy without having to pay for the omega?
---
“Horde is the military strength of Panfam”
---
Oh how the mighty have fallen.
---
Lol, u/powersv2 just pointed out how to manually invite all of local. Clearly I'm doing it wrong, I'm just inviting your supers as they undock. 
---
Not anymore, haha
---
And mah harpy
---
One battleship per DST tho... the logistics would be an absolute pain. Alternatively, you can bring in 10 battleships worth of ore in a single DST
---
I would really like to see CCP work on a better standard overview. The current overview is indredibly messy and unclear to new players. I think this change would help players understand the importance of the overview.  
---
Alternatively, new players should be able to follow a tutorial on how to easily modify their overview to suit their needs.

See, here's the thing: SP was always suppose to be this "clever" alternative to a grindy XP system. You could do activities that didn't require "just fly around and kill X in order to gain Y amount towards your skills". While good in theory, in practice it meant you spent more time "waiting" on skills to train, and attempting to not lose implants that assist on this wait time.
---
The SP training system is flat out horrible. You'd be better off having an 'XP esqe' system where pod kills yield % points of SP off whoever you smoked.
---
You can petition CCP to move them for you. Or you can firesell them using contracts.
---
&gt; What did you expect?
---
Nothing. People were misrepresenting avoiding getting ganked as directly fighting gankers. I have a problem with *that*.
---
4real
---
&gt;Each a somewhat time intensive skill que if you include the t2 weapons and then do several factions.
---
Yeah. I can fly one empire's T3D's with most skills trained hull skill at IV and weapon specialization at III, that's about it), but since I'm relatively new, I haven't gotten around to training the others (some types of T2 medium weapons already trained, around half of HAC weapons, and currently working on Energy Grid Upgrades V to train HAC) yet.
---
Capitals aren't on my skill plan, but I figure that if I join a coalition, I'll end up upgrading my krab alt from Orca/Exhumer to Rorqual and it's probably a shorter train from there to Naglfar or something than from subcapitals. Mostly because of Advanced Spaceship Command.
---
Hello, Alton. It's nice to finally meet you.
---
They’re getting desperate. Bout it really.
---
Imperium are desperate to keep their members entertained. Give them a break ok
---
Woah man easy there. Fact police have been patrolling these parts.  Just watch it ok
---
Almost every single doctrine fit for each fleet is very close to max fittings, some with 01 implants. Running less than max fitting skills including advanced weapons V would probably be the hardest time consumption to swallow for someone.
---
It’s not a script man.  Give it a try. It’s literally easier than compressing ore
---
someone's never heard of sabres or gatecamps ))))
---
&gt; Sorry your narrative is wrong.
---
~Enjoy~ 
---
Imagine admitting that I know more about gank mechanisms than you do. Yikes.
---
Nope, your fleet warp spam does though.
---
WTB: CCP Soundwave.
---
Also, when they removed blackout, they specifically said it could come back at any time with short notice. So, the nullseccers won't come back and start spending money because ccp has outright said it is thinking about taking away local again with 0 warning, and the "leet pvpers" who like having no local are obviously not going to care that local "might" go away again, they're just annoyed its gone and are also going to leave.
---
Really, I don't see a worse way they could have played this. Even sticking with blackout might have been better in the long run, at least that doesn't alienate literally every group of players at once
---
Nope.
---
Trig dreadnaughts.
---
It is in TYOL 2019
---
I have an idea, play Albion instead, Eve is dead.
---
Word one of the last things I want to do is leave this community alone. There’s a couple a folks from my old Corp that I’d like to continue talking to but the Corp as a whole and alliance as a whole I can do without, and I feel much better trying to combat and rally against Test’s krab first isk is more important than friendships mentality and blue everyone ideology. As much as people swear that this has all happened before and everyone will be back and all and that eve can’t die and this that and the other, this actually looks like a proper downtrodden trend. I mean all these changes and shit and then getting reversed because the Overlords saw subs dying off from PVE bull bears, that play this game to have shiny ship simulator to sit on the undock and circle jerk. There was people properly pissed off at me because I died in my Komodo and people mad that I didn’t give them isk/assets when I quit. I got in game mails and get in game mails begging for handouts.
---
Oh man foul tip.  
---
Needs to say “planned blackout events”
---
No doubt about. That's the only reason EVE can survive with low player counts due to each player paying 3-4x the subscription cost due to having alt.
---
That's because the people who mine the moons usually aren't the people who used to fight for them.
---
I don't care who owns the moons, I hate the grind and I'm not going to mine them anyway. If nothing else, letting the enemy keep them gives me a place where I can keep a cloaked cyno and drop excavs from time to time. I have an incentive to *not* fight over them.
---
Not really valid mechanics when you're actually exploiting.
---
In this case you did, and I appreciate the tip.
---
Cynojamma bad man.  China man bot man.  Test man blob man. Goon man winna man. PanDaFam man sad man

Alpha has all of the same ability to buy ships as any omega player. However the skill progression in Alpha is slower and more limited.
---
I would highly recommend you start the game and play the tutorial first. Then come back her to ask questions or use the help channel in game.
---
Lol, this implies hilmar actually read that post.
---
And nothing. He was just making it sound like it was this one instance.
---
jackdaw fleet with 3 jackdaws obvi
---
the big mistake before this was adding Pilots License Extensions.
---
This would have been better. But OP is still a solid 7/10
---
yea, just saying that if you are mass inviting people only on the undock, you are probably using a script since Crtl all doesn't work that way.
---
Here's my take on inejctor issues:
---
1. They don't create balance issues they only highlight them, problems with proliferation have little to do with injectors and more to do with how imbalanced the game is with regards to resource accumulation risk and capital usage.
---
2. They do promote bottling as well as extreme multiboxing and increase the cost of plex. Through extraction paying for 80%+ of plex costs demand for plex is increased by both bots and multiboxers thereby increasing its price. 
---
   1. Multiboxers: Most rorqual multiboxers extract each month making sub cost minimal and allowing them to continue to scale their operation with minimal variable cost. W/O extraction they would either be forced to play more or run fewer accounts without extraction,
---
   2. Bots extraction makes bots much more profitable than without extraction. All isk after the first 300mil goes strait into the botters pocket after accounting extraction costs. 
---
Solution which I have put 10min of thought into.
---
Limit extractions per month/ account maybe as a factor of sp. If you have under 20mil sp you can extract once a month, under 60mil sp you can extract twice a month, under 120mil sp three times a month..
---
Instead they should limit the size of corporations to less than 20 people.
---
Veteran players have always been able to buy skill points. It happened in the form of character trading. Long before skill injectors and skill farms, training and selling capital and supercapital pilots was a thing people did for income. Skill injectors opened this up to newer players. Removing skill injectors will not remove the mass creation of rorqual, supercarrier, or titan pilots, just shift how it is done and remove the ability for new pilots to jump over the worst periods of the game.
---
Skill injectors overwhelmingly help new players who don't have the isk to trade in entire characters. It provides an answer to the most common question new players ask. "The game has been around for 16 years, can I catch up?" Most of the complaining I see about skill injectors boils down to "I had to train my skills the hard way, everyone else should too." with no regard for whether or not that is a good thing.
---
To me, most of the hostility towards skill injectors looks more like hostility towards the idea of new players being able to catch up. When I started really playing Eve in 2006, the game was unfriendly to newbies, with a "you must be this elite to apply" rule existing almost everywhere. Over time the attitude swung heavily in favor of new players. It bothers me to see it swinging back the other way.
---
I find solace though in the fact that the newbie friendly organizations are currently dominant while the others are mostly REEEing about it on reddit while fading into irrelevance in game.
---
Perhaps a some things shouldn't be saved?
---
I always enjoyed the laser caracal NPCs.
---
The last few days I've started to think that more and more as I see the same names posting in all the threads. Some even admitting the don't play anymore. r/Eve is a very, very vocal minority of the player base. It doesn't represent the majority and as we know a lot of them are weenie whistles that quit years ago but can't find another sub to tug their pud quite the same as the noisy tuggers in this one.
---
I hate that both of these statements are true:
---
- eve is the greatest game of all time
---
- eve is boring to play
---
The Keepstar is held by Anomalous Existense, which according to zkill has 165 members:   [http://zkillboard.com/corporation/98180710/](http://zkillboard.com/corporation/98180710/)
---
Nash,
---
As someone here who has been posting asking why there's a Keep in a C2/HS, first let me say I didn't know it was named after a fallen member.  That's a great memorial and I think more than a good enough reason to do it.  Anybody who talks trash about that, or makes fun of you guys for doing that is just wrong. Full stop. 
---
I still stand by the statement that a Keep in a C2/HS is a lucrative target and nobody should get mad that people came to blow it up.  Sounds like you guys have always had the right attitude and I hope you're all sticking together through this.  To everyone else trashing the groups doing the eviction, I suggest they adopt the attitude you and your people seem to have - it was dropped knowing full well it could be destroyed, it will be fought over, but nobody is "safe" in Eve and it is part of the game.  
---
Best of luck to you and your crew.  o7
---
I'm pretty sure if what that screenshot says is true its actually an exploit. You can't roll new characters every day to mass spam invite people. They should definitely report it.
---
and my axe
---
You will want to use EVE API https://esi.evetech.net/ui/
---
The third party developer blog has an example for fetching market orders https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/esi-concurrent-programming-and-pagination
---
(you really want to do this concurrently. Doing it sequanteically takes really long time.)
---
Yeah, been exploit for years. Apparently some players have just forgot that.
---
EO. Is eve online
---
1. Similar to when learning skills were removed, just remove attributes (and therefore remaps) altogether and give everyone the current optimal rate of sp/hour.
---
2. Get rid of the magic 14 (maybe some others, that can be worked out) and again apply a flat bonus to everyone. Just like learning skills everyone needs these anyway and it's a pointless barrier to new players to have to train these rather than training for the things they want to do.
---
I know, like WTF people.
---
If your goal is to keep goons from getting involved, this kind of posting is counterproductive.
---
Peace in our time.
---
Try refitting.
---
Basic rats do not have capacitor. They have attributes where nos/neuts will reduce the chance of them performing actions like shield boosting.
---
Or had a plan
---
Nullsec has reached a state where all entities are disparaged by all the other entities, for harboring bots, for RMT, for promoting carebearism, for tolerating bads, for being elitist, for being two-faced, for having too many allies, and for dogpiling.
---
Holding sov requires occupancy and grinding. The old entities that refused to adapt to the PvE-heavy meta have fallen from power. Anyone who deploys can have their home region burned down in a week by a small number of ankle-biting opportunists. 
---
The optimal strategy is a follows: stuff as many PvE'ers as possible into a single tightly-packed region, populate it with thousands upon thousands of citadels, establish non-invasion pacts with the neighbors, krab ceaselessly for years, and never leave. Use the industrial output to grow your supercapital fleet until it is larger than the combined fleets of all who may unite against you. This is enough to hold a claim in any defensive war.
---
Then continue growing your supercapital fleet, divide it into shield and armor divisions, until both divisions are larger than the combined fleets of all who may unite against you. Then you are ready for offensive war. Deploy one super fleet to run roughshod over your target de jour and leave the other at home to hold down the fort from the ankle-biters.
---
Then, you are king of the galaxy. However do not expect your opponents to respect your achievement, kneel, kiss the ring, and start sending tithes. They will only cry that the game is broken, that it wasn't fair, that it doesn't count because *reasons*, threaten to quit, and beg the devs to rebalance the game in their favor. 
---
This has already happened. The Imperium+allies won. Hence the never-ending stream of cry posts here and on the official forums.
---
Salvage is worth between 400m-700m
---
New Triangle Capital? Please make it OP as fuck and worth fighting over to get the parts to make it.
---
You can do potato on integrated graphics.
---
I have the intel UHD 620 integrated graphics card and can do potato on 2 clients really easy. Running medium it can do at a slightly decreased frame rate (and a lot of heat) 1 client.
---
tbf it's a big win for nobody except CCP. I had to resub my titan and fax alt, and there's like a few dozen others did the same.
---
You can check the ship tree in game and it puts an omega blocker on the paths that require omega.
---
But its not about buying them, it's about piloting them.
---
Remember kids, it's only a blue donut if TEST does it.

That worked for one gun is there a reason different guns would cause this

I bought my ticket to eve London can’t wait for meeting more space nerds  :)
---
Trying to make it sound like big bloc warfare “isn’t fun”. This is the shit we put ourselves thru for.  The months of mining and rafting and training alts and all the other shit that null blocs do are lead ups to monumental geopolitical and landscape changing fights.
---
I'd like to introduce you to the "active characters" sidebar, which until today read 9.  Today it says 10.  I have an alt corp with 8 members in it.  I am the only real person involved however.  I stand by my earlier comment.
---
after all 4 years of playing the vast majority have been great people to learn to play with. i hope this community continues to be as awesome as it is
---
That's the #1 job of any proper director: ensure that your line members are having fun. When the directorate fails at that job, the end is near.
---
Ah you gotta refit with strip miner 2s.  Don’t forget your crystals.
---
1. repacage ship
---
2. assemble ship
---
3. fit guns
---
4. undock
---
This aged well
---
Which is fair because gating a blob of supers more than a region or something should be used as a torture method.
---
you sure they're not grouped?
---
PVP.  Not that I'm seeking out PVP, I just want to be able to either deal with player frigates or get away from player frigates if caught while ratting.  I tried the MJD method last night with great success.
---
lmao you believe that huh
---
Everyone has a personal narrative based on thier experiences im game. No ones narrative is wrong
---
ctrl A invite to fleet on what screen? this was done during blackout.  
---
I tested this several times aswell.  Unless someone is downing redbull and fleet inviting at super human speeds, its a script/bot.
---
I will have to create at least 100 camo accounts to give the appropriate number of upvotes ...
---
Done during blackout sweetie there was no local.
---
Yes i tested this several times.
---
Yes you can trade your ships to yours friends alpha or not. but take care with the trading tool. it's heavily used by scammers, never use it with someone you don't know  
---
About grinding together to buy firstly one omega. It sound like a good idea but it's not.  
---
take time to think, what do you need? Isk? yes maybe. but what you realy need is knowledge about the game and skill points.  
---
so, just play for fun, try lot's of things. 80% of eve activity are avaible to F2P pilots. you will not be efficient for sure but you don't need to be efficient now, just explore and learn.  
---
I strongly advise WH exploration and ninja gaz huffing (because I like it ^^) but there is lots of things to do for Alphas  
---
   
---
About the skill points. yes you need SP but you don't need omega status, you don't need T2 ships or capitals now.  
---
If you have some Isk, you better buy alpha daily injectors, It's an alpha only item giving you 50k SP in one shot. you can use only one per day  
---
some math : Omega, cost 1.8b isk/month, skilling 53k SP/day, 1.6M SP/month  
---
an Alpha who buy one daily injector every day, cost 30x50M=1.5b isk, 50k + 25k=75kSP/day, 2.25M SP /month  
---
to be clear, buying 1 daily inector each day, will cost you less than an omega month and you will see skill points growing 50% faster than a regular Omega player
---
Yes I do.  But please feel free to tell me how I’m supposed to enjoy eve.  I had enough of that from blackout thy I’m pretty calloused to it
---
 Not true, Goons are the ever-present forever existence of blue doughnut.
---
Cant fight to survive if you are already dead... 200 IQ GAMEPLAY
---
trig dread, hooh imagine max spooled dps
---
Reddit posts, NaCl and tears are why. People do it to make people realise nowhere in Eve is safe. You may as well venture out of high sec ASAP and experience the real game!
---
Dynamic bounties. The more NPC kills on an area, the less valuable they become over time. Inversely, areas with few NPC kills will see bounty payouts raised. Make the system so the average payout across the cluster is the same as today.
---
This will solve entrenching, stagnation, and botting, while encouraging entities to move frequently to "greener pastures" and forcing entities to compete and collide.
---
Gotta leave it to the dinobrains to point out to the world that they´re using exploits. Classic TAPI.
---
I'm only refering to fleet invites, not fleet warps.  I do not believe scripts are being used to warp/drag ppl in fleets, its only for inviting
---
i had my typhoon blowed up by a gang of frigates cause i wasnt paying attention to local a couple nights ago - when they podkilled me i laughed and they laughed and we all laughed, local was full of laughter i really love those guys 10/10 would be ganked by them again best 250m ISK ever spent.  love you guys and at least youre not ferra corp
---
You don't have to. Just invite all, fleet warp and see who follows.
---
just that like that staging headshot attempt ayy lmao
---
Ah, there is the problem, you met one of the very few autistic retards that camp plexes on perches with cloaked Supers. Yes these guys are bad, but it is not the common thing. 
---
&gt; Pffft safer than null.
---
#wreckingcrew, #wreckingcruski &amp; #ivanatradeforyou want to have a word with you ... debating why more supers and titans died in Low than in Nullsec.
---
Wait so tapi didnt commit without a clear superiority in numbers? :pikachuface:
---
Omg you guys big fleet fights drive player engagement hold fucking shit we should look into this!
---
you realize that a lot of this was done during blackout right?
---
null roam ended in wh roam...we came across a c3 null static wh with low power athanor,we analyzed the timer and we realized  ITS RIGHT NOW so we got our leshaks and ishtars shooting it then this happened.. charon undocks warps to another,we sent one leshak to follow charon but he docked up,leshak returns and applying dps.FC says farewell and order to stand down then ordersd to leave hole and fleet is disbanded because  police knocking his door,he got swatted. .. yes when i was jumping to null i pushed dscan for last time to see caldari freighter wreck. we jumped separately on the lowsec hole and returned to our bases, swatted  leshak just docked to  syndicate station before logging off
---
China numba tu, taiwan numba won
---
Truth. 
---
Seddow, you're a bad. Don't you know Eve is more important than kissing girls? Fucking scrub.
---
See the 3 arrows next to the capacitor. Press that.
---
Oh yeah baby
---
That's not what is happening.
---
the base blood (anomic mission) ships can't. Others can't (I think all the anomic base can't). Also zor.
---
You cant light cynos in holes, you can't see indexes on dotlan in holes, you cant see jumps in holes, you can't see the amount of people docked and undocked in holes, you can't crit jump gates in holes, etc etc. With blackout, people aren't playing in "your wormhole hell," they're playing a game of get shitty isk per hour while flying totally blind while being visible to every single person in the game looking for a gank on the map.
---
Krabbing in null during blackout was more dangerous than wormholes ever were for a fraction of the reward that wormholes gives you.
---
You thinking assumptions and cutoffs dont exist when it comes to data is troubling to say the least. The other guy linked where the data comes from and in just 2 minutes I found 2 major flaws.
---
1: Cutoff point was 15 days, i.e., people getting ganked within 15 days of creating an account were used.
---
2: The accounts who got ganked stayed longer.
---
Issue here is firstly where this point is, no matter how you do it you have to make an assumption as to where the best point is. Me personally, I wouldnt set 15 days but rather 3 months as there is no way to say you are no longer a new player in Eve after 15 days. Nobody would agree to such a short timeframe because it wont tell you anything relevant. Can you even use a barge after 15 days? Or have enough in your hauler to get ganked? If the answer is no or probably not, then that assumption will not allow you to test what you want. You understand this part yes? The measurement method has to be valid to produce relevant results.
---
Second point is you cannot measure if the people who left did it because of someone else getting ganked. Neither can you say the ones that stayed did it simply because they got ganked. It is simply impossible to draw such conclusions. Correlation does not imply causation and all that.
---
But even if we just use your method of looking at it, i.e., one data set is larger than the other. Which I would seriously never even consider doing since it means much less than one would think. You cannot explain away the assumption of when you stop being a new player in this game. You have to have a cutoff point, this is pretty much always the case of data analysis. And that point can always be manipulated to prove a point, this is how statistics are used falsely on a daily basis. If you only look at first day retention you can say 100% of the people who tries this game stay. Its not a false statement in itself, its correct based on the cutoff point. But is it relevant?
---
Which is yet again why Im saying, there is no way to make such a calculation. Even best case calculations (if you have a valid method which this clearly isnt) will fail simply because you cannot, and I dont get why I have to repeat this, calculate unknowns.
---
Cause catching two vanquishers is boring sure.

I've been doing my best lately to try to help newbies in general but also to bring newbies out of the fold of highsec and into spooky space, but as OP mentioned, it's difficult to get in contact with newbies in the first place. My typical strategy has been finding people who are obviously struggling (e.g. I see a month-old toon's Algos wreck in a 4/10), contacting them, handing them a few million isk, giving them some newbie-friendly frig/dessie fitting suggestions, and being available to answer any questions they have over the next few hours. I don't end up convincing many to leave highsec - the reputation of ls/null/wh among a lot of newbies is just "instant death by pvp" and it's hard to overcome that, but I do like to think I'm at least helping player retention. I want this game to live, dammit!

no wonder that your own modules try to hide from you
---
Imagine it being more expansive than a Super (does not take much atm with 7 Bil Hel Hulls) and useless for gank drops and additionally imagine damage caps on all structures ...
---
Of course you krab to PVP. Virtually everyone who has ever engaged in PVP does. But if you're spending just 10% of your playtime earning money then you must have an *insanely* efficient krabbing setup with multiple accounts feeding into one PVP main.
---
Spawn it in Mittanigrad and give it a black hole generator that sucks in all high mass ships (like capitals) on grid. Imagine the news ... "The Imperium loses 1000 Titans in 2 min"

Is there a core function still played by the POS system at this point?  After all this effort to get rid of them, aren't we finally done with upwell cyno beacons and bridges live and fully built out now?  CCP told us it was hamstringing them and it needed to go, so...can it go now?
---
They did tho! They fed bombers. Who apparently couldnt find the bomb launcher button. Must have been the no existing tidi at that point. The rest of them couldnt find the undock and warp buttons. Age of chaos brother, cloaked buttons.

Please explain what is more "real" about whatever place you hang out in.

lol all these crabs that obviously never hunted solo in Null.
---
I stand by my proven words, that for example the alliance GeminiWhaleUnited of GotG Coalition is 100% Bots (ADM-Bots).
---
It is quite easy to prove with a stop watch (rewarp timers), but for that you'd actually have to have a clue....
---
Thanks man.  I appreciate the comment.  o7
---
Well yes but it also puts it in perspective to recall that unless we get lucky, we have at maximum around a century, or more often than not even less, and the universe has an almost incalculable amount of trillions of years before heat death. Yes it's all going to die long term but a hundred years isn't that long by most scales of measurement except our own. 
---
Your lifespan is an iota of a fraction of a percent of the blink of an eye to the universe. :)
---
I'm just going to go ahead and assume that none of you played back in 06 when we didn't have all these fancy things. Back what it actually took you a long time to get into a ship, making it a little easier for people to advance in the game it's not a terrible thing. The problem with the game is they've made it too easy for these big giant corporations two pretty much run n u l l with zero consequence. What they need to do is actually make n u l l hard again. Make people fight for their territory, and not just have the Corp with the most money who can buy the most capitals essentially dominate everything. Make resources region-specific so that people actually have to fight if they want to get anywhere. N u l l is a complete shitshow joke at the moment, it used to be the place to go have fun, and now it's just boring a s***. High SEC Care Bears can even go down to know and going to Regions where big alliances will essentially keep them safe. That's a lot of horseshit
---
Whole game.
---
The idea of injecting skills is a good one in general. But the way it's been implemented, with people instantly skilling into rorqs and supercaps, and the proliferation of said ships, puts a bad impression on the whole idea.

Nope wrong, we re-engineer their script behaviour, then kill them, and only then report them ... with ingame logs showing automatted rewarp timer increments and other stuff

People like to think that the Citadel patch was some watershed that allowed for the rapid expansion that occurred after 2016, but they forget what we were developing in Deklein in the year or two prior to the patch. We were already starting to build the modern capital umbrella using AFK A-Type MSB Gecko Triage Chimeras. They were as AFK as a rorqual, but generated ISK instead of sucking crok, and stayed at jump cap at all times.

These proved to be ridiculously scalable, and made a ton of people a ton of ISK. However, it was limited by the startup time -- you had to train dudes up the slow way into chimeras/etc, which limited how fast you could horizontally scale. 
---
However, when you put skill injectors into the mix? The entire thing grows geometrically.
---
Lol. Its like CCP ever sees stuff to completion.
---
Tiercide? Walking in stations? FPS integration?
---
An on..and on...and on.
---
I don't get how it has any relevance to the op that the OP is talking about?
---
I can honestly say I was there for a lot of Eve's markee moments. Its been over a decade ingame for me personally. So I can say on one hand there is a lot I will miss about old Eve. But honestly the majority can go fuck itself. Eve today as a game as a product and as a general experience is better today than it was back then.
---
Drake balls, Pos Motherships, Pos Bowling, Remote cyno doomsdays, Vagabonds Online, Monocole Gate, T20 I could keep going with the bulshit I glad to see the back of.
---
Old Eve was good, but it was just as shit if not shitter than it is now.
---
... which is why some people mine for 20 hours a day
---
I’m just saying calling one side horrible botting and the other “legit gameplay” is ridiculous
---
Ok
---
CCP eviscerated its staff of EVE developers. They were laid off or transferred to other projects that are not EVE.
---
Don’t crush my dreams
---
I'm coming around to this point of view.
---
Mining isn’t a script either 
---
Even if done for 20 hours a day
---
Same logic
---
1. Test is using different alts over and over, many of these alts are in npc corps. This alt keeps fleet inviting you every 30s. Many people accept that by mistake (and then got fleet warped)
---
2. You have to kill (I believe 3-4) astrahuses and 1 fortizar, cause these campers sit tethered on structures. Also Legacy outnumber Winterco in eu and us tz
---
New capital? cos thats what we need more capitals lmao
---
Oh no, you can enjoy it however you want. Don't have an issue with that. I take issue with the delusion that many line members have that what they're doing "matters" because it only does for the fictional narrative they're told by a handful of egomaniacs who tell them what to do/how to play
---
Add a tech 2 titan, basically just twice the cost (mostly mineral costs, the original t1 hull, and a few billion in goo), twice the EHP, and a t2 DD that can only target titans and supercarriers (so it can be balanced against titans while not being more OP against dreads). This DD must have higher alpha and a mixed damage type, and it should prevent tether on the target for 5 minutes. This titan should have a ban on being remote repped by shield reps if its an armor titan, and vice versa. 
---
Dreads should have no SP requirements so they're all equally deadly regardless of skills and have the same jump range regardless of JDC skills, so that you can hand out dreads and dreadbomb as much as your corp/alliance can possibly afford to replace. 
---
Capitals should not be able to shoot subcaps, but to make this balanced people should be able to deathclone to any blue titan on grid that have fitted clone vat bay. And also all capitals should have an additional ship maintenance bay for doctrine ships, so that people can deathclone from subcaps (and dead capitals) directly into subcaps on grid. We'd also need quicker slowboating speed on capsules so you can slowboat to find a capital with doctrine ships left in the extra ship maintenance bay (slowboating in pod whilst inside the blob of bubbles that titan fleets anchor around themselves in big BR5/X47/UALX type battles).

Before skill injectors, wouldn't they just buy characters for that?
---
Holy shit, you're still around? I remember flying thrashers with you back in 2016.
---
Ok so DONT accept fleet invites.  Simple rule to tell everyone.  Not hard...
---
2.   Remember alarm clocking?
---
But I'm new and dont want to wait a year to fly a ship let alone have good enough skills to fly it :(
---

---
who is "all" though?  
---
if it is everybody in local, you'll grab all the people docked as well.  
---
but thats not what happens here.  they are only grabbing the people on the undock?  or maybe i'm reading it wrong.
---
I'm sure if I block someone and they make a new character just to send me more fleet invites, that's probably maybe arguably harassment.
---
Because injecting into subcaps on an alliance doctrine make the transition into nullsec easier for new players.
---
Skill injectors should only work on up to Tech II ships (not including capitals or freighters). This means anyone can inject into things like TII logistics, marauders, heavy assault cruisers and things like them but not inject into T3Cs and caps.
---
This solves the T3C power disparity by making it riskier than a few hundred million to lose one and stops the continued proliferation of capital pilots.
---
However, currently injected characters would need to be culled somehow by turning all injected skills back into skill injectors (that can only be used on the newly culled skills) or something like it. If this cull doesn't happen then there can be no changes as removing the means of catching up would cement the current top dogs indefinitely.
---
Dude some people have nothing in their lives.  It doesn’t take too many of them to fill a 20 hour mining alt flotilla.  
---
Have some compassion
---
I don't think this is correct. My understanding has been that NPCs have unlimited cap, neuts have no effect, you can NOS an NPC but will only get energy if the NPC ship class is the same or larger than your ship, i.e. if you try and NOS a frigate while flying a BS, it doesn't work, only returns 0 GJ.
---
Ree frat didn't give GFs when be bought subs to 2nd timers in their staging system. Why won't they good fight us, it's typical of them to not gf us :( Dirty Bl0bbers
---
You know what's fucked about this comment is that it implies that new players only belong in nullsec alliances. Which yes, is how it currently works. But imagine if EVE was balanced so that new players actually were better off starting off in highsec, as was originally intended by CCP in the first place with progressions into low/null/wh's... Instead we have a stupid system where we tell people to leave highsec immediately, because it's safer in nullsec.
---
Only there for the day.
---
I did try to put a note with some ideas corp came up with but the building looks shared, they buzz in and out.
---
Couldn't find a letter box.
---
She left on a high note for sure.
---
it´s hardly a tip. it´s the difference between using invites as a legit way to get kills and mass spamming invites to disrupt gameplay and server stability. same goes for telling fleet members to invite single or multiple chars or to spam a single char with an inappropriate amount of invites for extended periods of time. 
---
the first one is a-okay. the other ones will get you banned. hence performed by throwaway alts (probably behind VPN/VMs) in the above example.
---
Post the 99 ideas on their door.
---
Hmmm
---
Happy Cake Day Riggs_G! I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you'll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you'll make something that didn't exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return.
---
It has been reported multiple times and the response from CCP is that there is nothing wrong with mass invites as long as they are reasonably spaced out and not spammed in rapid succession. There are in game methods to block characters if you don't wish to get the invite.
---
That said, mass reporting a player for botting and further telling others to do the same is falsely reporting a bot.
---
See CCP ?
---
More like ... CCCP !
---
No - he needs to tape a 99 thesis of good game changes on their front door, it worked before... right?
---
"The months of mining and ratting and training alts and all the other shit that null blocs do are lead ups to monumental geopolitical and landscape changing "blue balling" and/or structure bashing." 
---
FTFY
---
I'd like to see proof it's every 30 seconds because that's not how often we invited you.
---
1. Yea 99,9% reject invitations. Script is configured in such way that it invites you after undocking. Accepting fleet invitation can be simply misclick. They use new alt every day / few houres, if it's weekend and it's placed in neutral / npc corp, so there is no way to block them.
---
2. Test keep deploying new ones. Last time test lost astra, they dropped 3 new ones. So my guess is winterco gave up.
---

I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank the CCP dev team for creating exciting nullsec content (*see Fozzie sov and citadel spam) we all can enjoy as we anxiously await the battles ahead - in 10% tidi that will last 8+ hours in system after system. I'm really looking forward to it. Truly. s/
---
It's not a script. We click a character in local, ctrl+A and then drag and drop to fleet.
---
Look I don’t follow vily or anyone as a proud member of test blindly.  
---
It’s a game.  I identify with TEST from what I’ve seen as a constant persecution from all of eve.  We’re the underdogs.  Vily and PGL and Dran and Sappo are cool dudes!  They hang out on mumble.  I only follow their orderS because they put in the time to make this shit happen and I respect that on a human level.  If they have the time to organize these huge groups in this massive game to achieve these objectives I’m happy to be a part!  I come and mine and contribute in the time I have.  These guys give all they can to eve and to TEST.  I don’t align with goons or Panfam for cultural reasons.
---
I love the aspect of eve that is the big long games of building huge armadas and conquering huge swaths of space in this online universe and I respect the effort it takes to organize all of that.  I can only give my few hours a week.  These guys give waaaaay more than that!  And that’s why I respect them in this universe.  They’re (and u too) are probably great dudes IRL and so are some of goons and PanDaFam but I identify with test.  
---
We’re the underdogs.  Everyone hates us.  And we win.  And I like that.
---
you don't need cyno 5 or blops to light a recon cyno
---
More capitals that only a tiny tiny fraction of the player base will ever get to use ... Come on CCP, if you wanna add more "exotic" ships then add ships that more people get to enjoy. Like Pirate Battlecruisers.
---
You're either mad dumb or are trolling hard.
---
Select a character in local, ctrl+A and drag in to fleet.
---
Turning the faucets on allowed it to become a more pertinent issue sooner; but this was always going to be the case. CCP rarely iterates on shit before it is woefully broken, and we have no reason to believe that they wouldn't have done the same thing in regards to Rorquals absent skill injectors.
---
When skill injectors were first introduced, we didn't have supers that could print 500m/hr of infinitely multiboxing Rorqual farms that could print 200m/hr each. You could inject regular barge miners, yes, and print 60m/hr or use heavy drone carriers to rat, but these produced peanuts compared to what the current state of Eve's reward system offers people.
---
I mean to be fair, they usually do fight us. Its just surprising that they didnt even try today.
---
It's true for me. I'm not making any melodramatic "fuck CCP" threads or anything, but I unsubbed my alts and haven't logged in my main for a week.
---
I don't know if I'm really quitting or just taking a break, but I'm pretty bummed out by the game right now, particularly by the end of the blackout, so I'm focusing on real life and screwing around on POE for a bit to decompress. We'll see what happens.
---
It'd take a more than a week just to get enough T3s and BCs into a C1.
---
Mass invite spamming has been declared a exploit for a long time.
---
dont ruin my dreams
---
I agree and think the whole skills and attributes area could be visited with fairly little effort.I feel like there's already enough complexity in the skills section without attributes and remaps so giving everyone a flat SP / hour would be  and removing the relevant implants would reduce this.  
---
I dunno perhaps replace these with some sort of training boosters.  
---
In regards to UI / UX around this I think it would be relatively easy to reduce the initial overwhelming nature of skills by :
---
**a/** reducing the visible skills to those that you can actually train (whether you've injected it or not) and those that you don't have access to as you need to train 3 levels of depth to get to (but also letting you toggle ALL skills back on once you've got the hang of skills).
---
**b/** add some structure to the skill training interface for example : 
---
*1/* If your magic 14 skills are below say level III / IV those are suggested as a useful next skill to train
---
*2/* This might be trickier, but add some form of "goal" setting in the form of selecting a ships Mastery as your aim and showing you the next couple of lowest SP skills that you can train to achieve that or some other career goal such as Market Guru / Mission Runner / Haulier etc etc.  
---
I also think incentivising first time activities with a small SP reward, regardless of character age would help get people to try things / help boost new players while rewarding them for actually playing - this might also help with the whole "I'm so far behind, I have 16 years of catchup to play"  
---
*Scanned down your first signature* \- good for you here's 10,000 SP  
---
*Gone through a WH for the first time* here's another 10,000 SP  
---
*Lost a ship for the first time to NPCs* 10,000 SP  
---
*Lost a ship in PvP for the first time* ...  
---
*Podded for the first time* etc. etc.
---
TIL sitting on a gate for 2 hours waiting for the enemy to undock equals running away.
---
Well it is what you make it, no one forces you to do boring PvP id you dont enjoy it
---
That’s your low effort edit?  Wow need to work harder
---
How many of those projects actually made it to beta? Any?
---
Your notion that the drop in players due to "the blue donut and shitty citadel mechanics" is factually incorrect.
---
Your notion that the players returning post blackout are just "some bots" is factually incorrect.
---
Just because you want it to be true doesn't make it so. Yes, your narrative is wrong.
---
I’d like to thank CCP for still trying. I can’t imagine what it’s like to put up with us, but with out them there would be no eve.
---
&gt; as long as they are reasonably spaced out and not spammed in rapid succession
---
sounds like a retarded loophole with alphas CCP is to lazy to deal with tbh. what is reasonably spaced out? Just use enough people/throwaways and the invites are reasonably spaced out while recipents still get spammed in rapid succession without being able to reliably block invites.
---
We had supercap umbrellas before injectors. 
---
Nothing will delete supercap umbrellas until dreads kill supers faster than people can build supers. 
---
Sadly CCP has been unwilling to seriously touch dreads since buffing supers in Dominion (2010?). The only buffs dreads received were the 5-minute timer, which is meaningless and T2 modules which are prohibitively expensive.
---
And most absurdly they recently nerfed dreadnought insurance even though losing a dread already set you back a billion isk. CCP either has no clue how caps and supers interact with each other (likely) or they just want people to sit in flying coffins (unlikely since keeps exist now).
---
Building bought with skins and injectors?

I wrote (and actively update) a discord bot that provides this sort of information. You cannuse it to get prices in different markets, predictions based on historic trends, and targets for station trading. Here’s the a recent post I made about it.

"unlimited" characters per email/account

instead of an account being omega, you get an omega license that can be moved to any character, at any time... perhaps a 24 hour cooldown period as jumpclones?
---
gone are multiple pilot training - as in you just buy more omega licenses, and aply them to your pilots of choice
---
omega licenses also allows multiple logins simultanious
---
They would, but the characters with required skills were harder to get, and were in much more limited supply, so it wasn't a big problem.
---
&gt; Script is configured in such way that it invites you after undocking.

How? What is this script and what specifically does it do?

Yeah, I was pretty pissed at you over the Komodo. But, for what it's worth, that opinion has changed over time.

You, sir, are a massive asshole.

EVE: Valkyrie is a space dogfighter game that made it to full release. It just didn't gain much traction. It was bundled in for free with the Occulus Rift. Apparently it was decent for the few with VR headsets, but not very special for those without. The servers are still running.
---
Now they're invested in an FPS called Project Nova, the tech demo of which was was panned as derivative of better works by more established studios. But they're still working on it.

With all that spinning I guess you are a Garen main in league?

On my phone so I can't give you a link, but I believe it's in the patch notes from Red Moon Rising when the mechanic was introduced.

I don't think I've ever seen a picture of Iceland without total cloud cover.  Do you guys ever see the sun?

It’s pixels, I literally invested 50 bil instead of buying a titan through hoboleaks shit and continued doing that with a couple of nerds and made 3 tril and continue making isk stil. It’s worthless to me and didn’t matter, only thing that mattered is the fact that it was the first on the cluster and first to drop. People getting mad over the fit/over the fact that it died is just weird to me, it’s my ship and if I wanted to t2 fit I have the right to, y’all just take Reddit shit talking and salt to heart and end up actually mad, not just reddit either, now it’s the whole alliance. Can’t shit talk and be mean to anyone cause Dran will blacklist you for fucking up cash flows.

 After re-watching, what I suspect happened was when I deployed my drones, I sent the attack command too soon and only some of the five were assigned to my intended target while the rest rambo’ed around.
---
(1:35) I target Master Zheng, attack with my drones and delock
---
(3:35) Lisa Cruise is primaried and we see the first evidence that at least some of my drones are not on Master Zheng.
---
(4:00) I am primaried and I focus on surviving and am simply not thinking about correcting the above.
---
(5:55) Master Zheng is primaried and we can see some of my drones are already on him from the start.
---
(5:57) Crazy Guitar is primaried and we can see some of my drones are auto’ed onto him while some are still on Master Zheng, my original “random”
---
(6:03) I correct this by placing all of my drones on k-koko (admittedly a poor target) now that Master Zheng is dead.
---
I could have done better and/or corrected the mistake once it was obvious all my drones were not on Master Zheng but simply stating that I flat out did not follow this command is simply untrue.

I highly recommend it for multi-boxing. Even though I have multiple monitors, I prefer to have everything on one screen.
---
I don't believe they were random changes... More like calculated experiments. 
---
They wanted to gather data on experiments with different things ~ events on weekends, trig invasion (Live Ops/ Limited Time events). Botting was obviously a problem and they wanted to experiment with combatting it. Sub dropping was probably largely in part to bots cancelling subs. Also if they are wanting to introduce new structures (ie coms hubs for sov) then they probably want some data to back up that design.
---
Lastly, whenever you make a major change it usually takes a month or so to 're-anchor' your stat base. Then you have a month or so to gather clean data to compare with before.
---
There's two in Lonetrek  - a big one of about ten systems accessed via Aunenen, and a small one of 4 systems accessed via Mara and Dantumi. There's also a few very small islands of 1-2 systems each in Essence - Droselory, Allebin + Perckhevin, Actee + Amane, and Clorteler.

I'm a market guy, and I basically took a break because it felt like market activity nosedived during BO.  Why bother updating buy orders if activity is only 25% of what it was before?  Now that Blackout is over, I'm finding it really hard to get my enthusiasm up enough to get back to spending a few hours a day updating orders; I'm almost certainly going to change to a less time-intensive market playstyle going forward.  Got a taste of RL again, and I kinda liked it.

Whodathunk those were probably largely bot accounts.

Also this was obviously an experiment to gather data on a bunch of different things. It takes time to re-anchor your data (let it settle into the new changes) and then some time to gather the new clean data to compare with before.

Sure there were confounding factors to real players ~ large increase in risk without a proportional increase to reward (particularly now with the cyno changes), but this is what re-anchoring does. It sounds like players have gotten so used to the safety net of null blocks that when real risk came back (as it was apparently back in the day) some just stopped playing. As a short term experiment we don't get to see how this would effect the market and then see how it the game economy would rebalance in time.
---
Lastly, people are behaving as if CCP is on their last legs. I don't think this is true. Micro PLEX and Skill Injecting has provided a lot more fiscal options for CCP, which seems to have paid off for them given the past couple years. Also they have the deep pockets of Pearl Abyss to rely on for funding game design experiments. I doubt their coffers are running low. These recent changes look much more like preparing for the long haul ~ how do we modernize Eve for today's players and prep it for the next 5-10 years. This involves growing pains.
---
thank you.. what about  amarr area? do they got anything? as for gallente i did read about placid to be large one so also noted it.. im looking for these small islands aswell.
---
That was PL’s defining culture for 8yrs.
---
The other thing that is screwed up is that they seem to think that the current "top dogs" got there by injecting. Remove me from injectors, extract every single SP that's been injected. Across 3 accounts with mains that each have over 200 M SP each, I will lose..... 0 SP. Those of us that were above 80 M SP, for the most part didn't bother wasting our time injecting. Well, except that one guy that bought enough injectors to have perfect skills in everything
---
Cmon bisu. There’s a deployed squad and everything.
---
Completely wrong.  They are what allowed the faucets to open up fully.
---
10000 percent agree.
---
Ahh I see you are a veteran of such things. I too have experience the krab n blob technique
---
Every day is like Sunday.
---
"CONCORD officials warn that communication service levels remain subject to change"
---
I hope they're not just messing with my head here...
---
Lmao
---
Erzoh  Hayumtom  Furskeshin  Mili  are the ones in "amarr" space then you got some over in derelik like Moh  Shenela  Fera   Jangar
---
Ahh yes your sigs who put 100 to 200 in fleet as opposed to mainfleet and its thousand screaming autists.
---
"CONCORD officials warn that they can kill the game at any moment"
---
&gt;However, currently injected characters would need to be culled somehow by turning all injected skills back into skill injectors (that can only be used on the newly culled skills) or something like it. If this cull doesn't happen then there can be no changes as removing the means of catching up would cement the current top dogs indefinitely.
---
*Laughs in T2O*
---
*Laughs in FW LP scamming*
---
Oh I had a question about this bit  
---
" This story by the way made its rounds and Blue-Fire is a pariah in our community and apparently also in Nullsec where some of their pilots recently tried to join a larger outfit and were rejected because of their reputation. "
---
Who tried to join a nullsec outfit and was rejected? We've literally been dead for the last 3 months so like this bit seems like some wild spin to me.
---
Great thread!
---
I'd like to commend CCP for making such a great game, its longevity is almost without parallel, but it will be a demanding continuation for Eve. I hope CCP rise to the challenge and are aware that vintage video games are qualitatively different from vintage wine in that only the latter improves without interference. 
---
I'll be there to support you, CCP, buying omega and the occasional plex. In fact, one or two skins, too (blushing).
---
Um. Has Legacy blues everyone in the north and I somehow dont know about it?
---
CONCORD - invulnerable and unavoidable. Checks out.
---
There's a saying in Iceland:
---
Don't like the weather? Wait 5 minutes!
---
It'll get worse.
---
yeah bring chaos to wh space.
---
Reavers isn’t even putting 50 dudes in fleet. The autz/ghost tz guys are coming from delve through wormholes.
---
You are wrong a lot.
---
I get the frustration. I raged for a long time before I finally gave up. My take is that CCP have arrived at the firm conclusion that EVE *will* die because its core audience is aging out of gaming and not being replaced, and they are desperately diverting all profit into trying to establish another viable product/market to stake the company on. All updates to EVE now are merely to stave off the exodus and buy time.
---
Incarna was the first huge player drop. Yeah we lost some when T3C were introduced, but it's literally been CCP "fighting bots" that has hurt the player count over the years. When Incarna happened the server player count was almost halved. Oh and a few hundred or so quit when they nerfed nanofits
---
Nailed it
---
i know guys that dropped the game because of NC., does that mean we should appease them by disbanding your alliance?
---
Yes
---
Never heard about this.  It would make sense tho for logistics.
---
You could pull info of all systems from somewhere (ESI, static data dump, eveOJ) and go through all systems with sec &gt;= 0.5 and their neighbours to check whether they are &lt; 0.5
---
Yeah thousands . In a game that struggles to have thousands logged in. Seems healthy for the game to have large coalitions of 20,000 doesn't it?  Making everyone blue when like you said "thousands of people in test" doesn't seem like they are very good. With all those thousands shouldn't they turbo dunk people?
---
I managed to put at most in there because I'm bad. Also I'm enjoying being done with eve, so I'm just looking at zkill brs for numbers.
---
the description on that gif lmao
---
Tapirum can batphone 67% of Eve but Pandafam can't batphone their 25.5% ? (coalition member, renter and affiliated entity counted)  
---
Legacy  38886 + FI.RE  7487  WC  18535  
---
and they still batphone imperium BUT WC should't ?
---
Because balance is an incredibly difficult thing to do that requires excessive knowledge and experience of the game, in addition to the ability to execute properly designed experiments to gather (and interpret) meaningful data to back up balance ideas.
---
Save from the hyper gritty technical details of network engineering game balance design is the most difficult and expertise demanding job in game development.
---
You can get away with average-above average artists, frontline developers, ui design, etc. but net code and game balance make and break a multiplayer game.
---
Also, if your artists are salary and not contracted you want them turning out art/assets constantly. Given that skins drive flex sales and $.$ this is a good thing for the game and the devs.
---
Also, if CCP is trying to modernize the game and prep it for the next 5-10 years they need to keep it looking fresh and clean to keep new players and outside viewers interested.
---
The freak out at the end accurately describes what my mental image is of some of these people who scream insults thinking they’re always right
---
When they get proven wrong
---
You sir, are very observant and possibly correct Have an updoot.
---
This isn't game breaking or spamming. Spamming fleet invites or chat convo's used to be used to have 10+ chars simultaneously create a huge series of chat invite windows/fleet invites on the victim's client, which could cause their client to crash. 
---
1 character inviting you to their fleet every 30 seconds so they can fleet warp you off and kill you is completely different.
---
What the fucc is that description??? Explain yourself
---
No
---
I acknowledged it is very important. It just doesnt feel very good to do
---
Shhhh
---
Was just reiterating his snark back at him
---
Bro, imagine that you are playing csgo and there is guy who has really bad wallhack and he sees through walls only players with ak47. You report him and admin is replying "don't use ak47, then hacker can't see you through walls".
---
Do you get my point?
---
Log into eve .. view market..  compare...
---
Wait waht
---
The faucets that I am talking about **did not exist** when skill injectors were first introduced, super/carrier changes occured **6 months post-injector addition** and Rorquals were added **12 months post-injector addition**. CCP had ample opportunity to receive feedback from the first few months of injector usage that these should not be able to be used for certain high-end skills because the reward feedback loop was entirely too powerful.
---
1 guy inviting 1600 players into fleet every 30s and creating 10% tidi is worse
---
If you cannot evade either with a covops cloak you need to..... Wait nevermind I will just say it, you suck. Badly. If that stuff gets you it's your incompetence.
---
The current state of rorqs, and supers/Titans makes it so that a rorq only produces about 115 mil/hr average if you aren't cherry picking, and Titans only do about 150 mil/hr ratting. Supers will do between 80 to 120 mil/hr. I literally make more isk in HS right now because of abyssal sites
---
God that's depressing, but you're probably right.
---
THAT is a great idea... *gets his ole rusty sledgehammer*
---
Several ways to push an agenda.  
---
One is built on carful discussion, consensus building, compromise leading to changes that most people don’t hate, and that as many people as possible are invested in making work.  
---
The other way is for people to Reee very very loudly and drown out every other voice.  Decision makes then believe that’s the same as a consensus.  One the guys with the screeching are interested in make things work and everyone else is just waiting for things to fail.
---
As long as there is no asshat like me around who runs the gas-havens cause he doesnt give a F:P
---
It is not? That screenshot shows a docked person getting fleet invites.
---
here is the othere ones as a bonus :-) 
---
caldari (gurista rats)  Liukikka  Antiainen Otomainen  Tunudan
---
minmatar (angel rats) Otraren  Orien  Kattegaud  Atgur
---
aridia (blood rats)  Zaveral  Sazilid  Haimeh 
---
dodixe (serpentis rats) Boystin  Pochelympe  Algasienan  Actee  Clorteler  Olide  Odette 
---
i might have missed some
---
There's a decent size one in Minmatar space too, easy way would be use the old map and set color to sec status
---
jesus christ you're just really bad, then.
---
Are you going to complain about cloaky camping now that local is back?
---
Are you Amak Boma's alt?
---
Shit flows both ways. Post could also be titled "70% of EVE when black out began". VoV
---
...yeah I've got some bad news for you...
---
1600 people in local is causing 10% tidi. A single smartbomb is more problematic than that guy for tidi.
---
well there goes my idea to use void bombs agaisnt sleepers  to cleat gas sites
---
no.
---
You aren’t wrong.
---
 ctrl + a = everybody in local being invited to the fleet.  no shit.  That is not what is happening here (or maybe people are just lying about what is happening).  The only people invited are those that undock.  if you are docked, you don't get an invite to the fleet.
---
In support of those dreams, they wouldn’t have allocated the art bandwidth necessary to make the Xordazh model if they didn’t intend on it becoming something people actually SEE - they’re not making angel caps now for the same reason, aka barely anyone would ever see or be able to use them.
---
currently i dont play at all bacause my house is a one big mess due to a bathroom renovation, does that count too?
---
then that solves it.  sorry was going off the posters descriptions.
---
Gecko-chimeras were the first step, but they were not nearly as difficult to dislodge as Rorquals with their PANIC button and high-levels of pre-nerf tank (even post-nerf, they are still formidable). Couple that with a fair amount of Rorqual mining being done on gunned Athanors or even Tataras, the risk-level for a lot of these is far lower than Gecko carriers ever experienced.
---
Even with Gecko/heavy drone carriers, the max amount per hour was what, 120m? 150m at the outside? I have fond memories of post-Citadel making 180-190m/hr in Branch doing carrier ratting, coupled with dread spawns and DED-selling, that number was higher. It can't be denied that for the general populace of Eve, who have only 1 or 2 accounts, that Citadel *was* a watershed for them in isk-generation amounts. The Rorqual rebalance was similarly a watershed moment for the people who had never before had that many accounts, and those that had many, in that it allowed a massive amount of isk to be made with comparatively little risk.
---
Adapt or die noob
---
You might be correct... But you're in BL, so I have to downvote... Nothing personal. Have a nice day
---
:(
---
Whats the attraction of highsec islands? What are they good for? I'm really curious.
---
With a nail. Yeah, its a glass-door, I know...
---
Is it the anom nerf that is affecting your super/titan ratting numbers specifically, or is it rather the application of damage?
---
Can you knock and ask if they seen lowsec gate to Stain ?
---
Pushing in the other direction, imagine it being not hyper OP, needing only regular cap components plus IS10 and ZPC to be constructed (maybe bringing the relative material cost to around ~1.5-2x that of a normal dread), and its BPC being actually widely available unlike any of the pirate caps - Precursor stuff has been intended to be usable broadly since it showed up, and is a different category from Faction for a reason
---
C1s usually have a hs static. Ship the bses in to the HS static via freighter, dst them in rapidly. Won't be as difficult as you suggest. Even a ns c1 can be taken over this way.
---
Tbf either way works.
---
thank you,wil explore them,they're added to my list now. thanks al.
---
Or knows what this EVE Online is that everyones been talking about
---
... They can put out skins relatively easily given the tools they internally developed which make enough money to pay the artists salaries while they focus on new and updating art content (redoing effects, structures, ship redesigns, etc.) that don't have immediate pay-offs but help modernize the game and make it more attractive to both old and new players thus increasing retention and money for the slow burn.
---
As for the sub numbers... There are different types of paying players in games like eve that have subs with a mix of premium currencies. Typically you have whales, average players, and free players. Yes, you do make 'most' of your money from whales (In eve these would be plex+skill injector players). However, a whale is a *type* of person. You cannot make the average player a whale. So if you cater to only whales you are leaving a lot of money on the table from the other types of players. Average players will pay a sub, and occasionally drop some money on PLEX or a cool skin if its available. Most free players won't spend a penny ever, but some you can convert to average players (great starter pack deal, or cleverly engineering first time experience ~ faked super reward or staged social encounter, etc).
---
It's in CCPs best interest (and frankly for the health of the game given that it's an mmo) to ensure all facets of revenue are flushed out and explored. It would not surprise me at all if sub-counts accounted for around 30% of the revenue generated for the game and the rest came from PLEX sales and Injectors.
---
My shit has only ever flowed one way.. so I cannot relate to your experience mentioned. Haha jokes
---
Well, go shoot him.
---
I tried that. It didn't go well.
---
Sorry CCP headquarters.
---
Everyone should print that post and just send it via regular mail
---
nice
---
Jesus, did they fold every other goon sig into it? That's massive!
---
Wars in Eve are won through morale, and narratives are key to suppressing enemy numbers and building your own. That's what got my goat, but at the end of the day a choice between a valuable player burning out and giving the enemy something to smug post about is pretty easy. You're right, it is just pixels.
---
Meaning "yeah, they made it because they have plans or ideas for players to get them" :P Hilmar even mentioned "TitanTitans" in regards to the CSM summit a bit ago lol, I'm pretty confident that World Arks/Motherships will be introduced soon(tm)
---
According to EVE Ref the Burner Succubus starts with 0 cap in its 1250 capacitor. And Zor has an absolutely miniscule 450 cap so even most frigate wouldn't be able to nos it and no destroyer will have such a tiny cap.
---
Wasn't blackout a test to get data? I do not recall anybody saying anything about permanent blackout. My memory could be shit though.
---
Yeah, I just unsubbed a bunch of accounts over it, too. Hope to see you in space again some day.
---
yeah skill injectors are lame. Be a grown up and tough out the training like we used to do.
---
It's sarcasm mate
---
Well, they whacked excavators with the Nerf shovel 4 or 5 times at this point. That's the biggest cause. The anoms spawn rate doesn't really affect me personally, because when I mine I gather everything. Ice belt full of nothing but clear icicle? Flip it, still free heavy water. Collossal with nothing but ocher and mecoxit? Flip it, I need those minerals to build. There is never nothing to mine, and even if we time the spawns wrong, we just get a 20 minute break waiting on the small. Or just go to the normal asteroid belts. 
---
I can't really speak to the application of damage, because I didn't start super ratting until just before abyssals came out, and i don't own a Titan yet, because I won't fly what I can't produce (read own the BPO's for). I'm getting there, but I can easily earn over 200 mil an hour in abyssals, while in HS, so that's where I get my isk now
---
You can find DED 3 and 4/10 and other combat sites in there and run them safely.
---
Molden heath has one
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Molden_Heath/Besateoden#sec
---
and a single .7 island system at the bottom
---
Maybe your pilots should already be in a fleet before they undock in a system that is under assault?
---
probably better representing the krabs reeing because his cloaky campers got alot more effective again
---
i would like to show some appreciation to the players who take a moment to abandon unwanted wrecks, so they become free to loot.
---
I meant specifically the anomaly quantity nerf seen in the spring which caused a rather precipitous drop in nullsec NPC bounty payouts, something to the effect of 20-30%? There was a lot of bellyaching about this at the time, which is why I'm curious if that's why you are saying that tick amounts per titan/super are down?
---
Me? No, I really find cloaking as a concept the vehicle of a lazy sci-fi writer. One doesn't have to spend much time figuring out why the technology would never work.
---
My assumption is it was put in to balance local which it's self should never have been a thing.
---
Maybe it will visit him in a dream.
---
Giggty
---
&gt;Systems were cyno jammed -&gt; they could reship, Legacy could not.
---
i wasn't there but this is one hell of a piss poor attempt.
---
Finance divisions everywhere are only capable of thinking quarterly. They will absolutely fuck anything up for those sweet sweet short term gains.
---
If this is the truth, I'll unsub tonight.
---
It's super easy to click on the char name in the invite and look who they are.
---
PL tried this with me 2 days ago in 1DQ... I simply convo'd him to politely let him know that I wasn't born yesterday.
---
He agreed and wished me a good day. I did the same and jumped to my destination cyno after I joined the CORRECT fleet from advert.
---
Its easy not to be an idiot, but looks like FRT is incapable. Such a shame.
---
Let the KM's keep a comin'
---
What pve do people do now in null?  I never really pved.  Is it boring as shit?
---
&gt;The only drop in player base is when they introduce stupid shit like the broken T3 cruiser
---
Apocrypha was probably their most popular expansion lol
---
Can confirm it when it comes to me. I used to play everyday but when I login now I think "meh", and switch to other games.
---
That's just active kills over the past 7 days.  We don't roam Null or C5 space and we don't gank Hisec, so our kill count is never going to be amazingly high.  Kills in lower class space aren't like they used to be.
---
Is that it?
---
Good boy ! you win the stupid F1 Monkey award ! congratulations !
---
Working as intended actually. Otherwise you would have batphoned goons init gotg snuff etc and rolled all regions out in hours.
---
Dang, I resubbed after 3 years just yesterday. Ah well.
---
I think the whole point in the injectors is because it was a problem
---
Oh, that, from what I've gathered from those of us that actually do super/Titan ratting, it slowed them down, but at this point the player count is so low that it doesn't matter. When we had 4 or 5 supers/titans out in every system, yeah that slowed them down. Now Delve is so dead because of cyno changes you can go rat havens and sanctums in anything, and no one cares because there are now more than enough anomalies to go around.
---
Is that salt on your desk?
---
I've got y'all beat. 37 accounts unsubbed because they removed blackout and didn't go to the homes of those who own supers and execute them
---
I was there in July. I wanted to visit but they were "relocating" and not taking visitors. 
---
Wasn't happy :(
---
Pass
---
There's a difference in "newbs" and "noobs"
---
I'm not trashtalking the active kills/etc.  You guys just don't seem to be a group that's big enough to really defend a keepstar (and frankly nobody in J space is against a determined opponent).  I have no idea how many actual active PvP characters you have hanging around, but the zKill stats are generally a decent indicator.
---
&gt; does that mean we should appease them by disbanding your alliance?
---
Not a bad idea.
---
I'm just a filthy casual, but I liked the blackout. It added some tension to flying alone, made me feel like an old submarine.
---
People think it don’t be like it is, but it do
---
 gay set this downvote
---
I just got this too lol got to bump those numbers up!
---
i heard code does not come to islands so they are safer to mine,especially if they have camped lowsec gate.
---
roses are red, 
---
violets are blue. 
---
they don't think it really be like that, 
---
but sometimes it do.
---
I don't even play the game retard, nice projection.
---
What's that?
---
Ok so Intel is different. Oh noooooozzz.. any good pilot can get most of that Intel by themselves with some effort. Yes null Intel is Abit to free but local contributes to that. How is it fair that everyone in a system can dockup before a pvper even loads grid? 
---
Shitty isk per hour is your problem. Go explore or something instead of run anoms all day. Oh wait all null pve is done in caps sorry exploration isn't good for them maybe you should try a subcap.
---
Blackout was only more dangerous whan whs due to accessibility not Intel. And it depends on what wh your talking about c1-3 barely makes more isk than null. So no it's not a *fraction of the rewards*
---
Blackout was broken because cloaks are broken. Simple as that.
---
What’s the fit lol
---
So not only do we have to come up with 95 good ideas, we also have to come up with 4 extra?
---
eeew.... no it doesn't?
---
Maybe they were once, but the skill point system is inherently inflationary. The number of cap/rorqual ect characters available would have exploded with or without injectors.
---
Also, the skill points are still coming from somewhere (and some are lost through the mechanics of injectors).
---
Sub running out in 2 days, offer only for accounts that aren't subbed... -1 resub
---
Nicceeeeee
---
If you wanna work with EVE-IT-stuff: [https://www.eyebleach.me/cats/](https://www.eyebleach.me/cats/)  
---
You ll need it...
---
Nice
---
Maybe this is why the game sucks. They want the rest of the world to feel the way they do everyday
---
impressive, grats
---
How dare a company have a sale on services!!
---
Again
---
Why would we want to disrupt server stability? That doesn't get us kills, and impacts our people as much as you.
---
Honestly, listen to yourselves. You're accusing us of hacking, botting, using VPNs to attack server stability, and on and on. You report us to CCP multiple times a day. Hell, the people on that astra probably get more GM attention than anyone else has in years. If we were engaged in a fraction of the shit we're accused of we'd already be banned ten times over.
---
How do y'all think this is going to work out? There's got to be some Chinese equivalent of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf".
---
ask someone on local
---
he has a point though, isn't it?
---
Finally the memes are back
---
very nice
---
69 killmarks
---
You mispelled Outer Ring here good sir.
---
Your bias is influencing your judgment. Until data is publically posted, the position of skill injectors being bad for eve is pure speculation. For businesses to succeed they must generate a constant uptrend of revenue and without it, you may be saying bye to the game entirely. Theres a bigger picture and money talks more than your feelings.
---
Having lived on the one in Placid (for which Oulley/Orvolle is the main access point to Low-Sec from contiguous High-Sec), I can assure you that this isn't always correct. And Solitude has its own locals.
---
Poop reflux is not a joke ok. Please dont mock my people.
---
They need a system that has like
---
HIGHLY lucrative sites sites that are very feasible in PvP fits (with a logi) that just geyser out ISK for groups of 3-10 people. There would be sites recommended 3-5 and 5-10 players. They do not constantly respawn in the same system, they appear randomly around a region -- and that entire region is in blackout during the event.
---
The targeted region of blackout + dank ISK group PvPvE then rotates cycles around null-sec on a weekly basis.
---
Nice.
---
Any chance that was in LA?
---
Even tho, your salt contribution is still very appreciated sir !
---
Lets not forgot all the Dino DownVotes, I see butts hurting everywhere. That makes me feel good &lt;3
---
Or it’s literally the truth but whatever non player
---
Go where the fun is?
---
DAE SALT XD
---
Only here you have people NOT hacking while another is encouraging others to violate the ToS.
---
Perhaps, but CCPs track record I think doesn't support this being some big plot. Most of last few years have been half-baked, poorly thought out and implemented changes that just never get fixed or iterated again until the damage is already done.
---
I had high hopes that blackout was the beginning of much bigger, sweeping changes to the map that used the Invasion lore stuff to carry it out. Maybe that is still the case, but also seems to confirm my prior feeling that CCP has no idea what the fuck they're doing anymore.
---
Probably where the blackout idea came from
---
Hmm maybe join a newbro corp with her and get her to start chatting with people.
---
&gt; The minute there’s a war, I will be back 24/7.
---
So never?

Windsigh best sigh &lt;3

Check ashers post this was gonna go all in.

Would have been completely massive

i believe it but still using it as a justification is weird
---
He came to try a last minute shakeup to shoot numbers up before october
---
It didn’t work, they are now trying to revert and drag as many people back as possible before october.
---
He shot for the moon and missed, at the cost of the playerbase mind you, but he tried
---
Not in the slightest. Just a few short years ago PANFAM declared GSF through, finished. And I don't mean after Casino War, I mean when GSF failed to kill a Keepstar.
---
Cancelled my 3 (cash paying) subs due to blackout.  Been gone for 2 mo...  I know BO is over, but on other hand being away kinda broke EVEs grip on me.  Only come to Reddit to harvest salt tears...  From both sides.  Not sure if this offer can bring any of my accnts back...  Will think about it.  CCP clearly desperate...  Seems they got financially spanked over this whole fiasco....
---
They thought like EA . They are getting to where EA is ...
---
and nc. moved theirs..
---
and the fight had equal supers numbers.
---
Fd- pipe was litty

Put in a ticket

Eve University or some FW stuff could be fun.

If you have old space money saved up you can send her to her death over and over.

I used to specifically target islands for ganking because of this thinking.
---
No, it was in OK where I’m stationed.
---
How did we miss this /u/tuz
---
you can try using civilian guns they don't use ammo, or train ammar lasers
---
If you haven't killed it by 530-6 EST let me know and I'll come help.
---
I used to live in San Antonio, and it’s the 7th largest in the country. And I still hadn’t seen any until yesterday.
---
We tell people to leave highsec because its garbage. Not because nullsec is safer.
---
Haha it’s cool to see now.
---
Good guy eve player here.
---
a sin
---
Exactly the game had an in-game choke point called captial ships skill book . A newbie does not need to be in a cap to be having fun . I'm sure horde were having more fun fighting in hurricanes than in nidhoggurs truth be told
---
Just got this on 3 accounts. Gonna pass until such time as the cyno changes are scrapped
---
All my non used accounts got emails today for 25% off sub price for a month. I wonder why.
---
then slowly realise this is the new lifestyle

Hmmm... I d say "Be an extended tutorial". Let her play, be around and let her explore what might interest her, help her avoiding the usual noob mistakes with your knowledge. Tell her about options and possibilities she might not see on her own. But if she WANTS to do something, just let her, even if its subpar ISK, if its risky, or whatnot...  
---
And: Dont drown her in ISK from the start. Let her earn at least her first few mills and ships on her own, for as well the feel of accomplishment, as the feel for "hoch much effort making ISK can be with activity A or B".  
---
From my own experience with milady back then I can say: Running L4s together, undershipped, underskilled and undergunned can be wild fun :)
---
Only got an email with the offer on my accounts that haven't logged in for a while. The ones I occasionally log in with didn't get one.
---
Probably just googled the gif and linked the first one to come up
---
There are two ways you could do this:
---
First, if you need more ammo, then you’re not applying damage well enough. Try to slow down your ship till you have better quality hits, or you could stop/keep at range and that might help. 
---
Second, you could bring the civilian weapon. It does crap damage, but uses no ammo. I guess as long as you’re not dying, you’ll eventually win.
---
Not really an issue. She's a solid gamer. Quick learner too. She doesn't go in for the "helpless girl" act and she will definitely stand up for herself if disrespected.
---
You misspelled Himler
---
Maybe he should've actually done something about citadels and caps then 🤔
---
Blackout changed this from ramming our heads into a brick adm wall to ramming our heads into a chainlink adm fence.
---
That was hardly serious imho, you cannot realy "kill" of "finish" projects like Goonswarm (i call it project on purpose).
---
You just have to move away a few jumps from trade hubs and the main trade routes.
---
Revenue as in their investors sold the company to pearl abyss, CCP kicked their community team , ccps complaint management team  shit, language support team is shit , CCP seagull left , CCP guard left . Pretty sure all this din happen because CCP was doing well in revenue even after injectors
---
The vertical scaling is only available to coalitions that are large enough to have the full supercap umbrella capability to protect rorquals.
---
Space is not currently valuable enough in the base things it otherwise provides (moons, local DEDs, explo??) Outside of I guess afk subcap ratting. If I wanted to provide for a 30 active pvper, 200 character alliance in NS during blackout where subcap ratting was unviable, I would need at least 2, probably 3 constellations unless most of my members made their isk in other places. If you want groups that have a serious investment in maintaining space, you need to make it viable for smaller groups to claim enough space for all their members to actually grow and gain wealth/assets in Nullsec.
---
The current "Renaissance" in Tribute and Vale? Most of the groups there either generate income elsewhere or have a lot of players that have fuck you money in Eve and can do whatever they want. Trigger Happy, Unspoken, Forsaken Empire all fit that bill. Rote is a lowsec group with lowsec income that secretly hides in null as far as I can tell. ur dunked is Snuffed out alts that just like gatecamping. Because if any of the bigger groups wanted to actually make all their isk in nullsec, they would need to double the amount of space they were holding.
---
i call this bs 7 of my 10  rl friends quit eve because of the black out
---
my old corp lost about 1/3 Player ( 60real player corp) 
---
with most of my friends left i have not much fun in eve anymore sad era
---
Good to hear. We have a few in our alliance. They have some tough skin and fit in quite well. One even FCs fleets well
---
The cyno jammers have been universally chastised as fun killers.  They completely prevent co-escalating engagements.  
---
Think of them as wormhole engagements where the hole holder can build and field caps but any roaming gang can only come in with subcaps and can’t realistically bring caps.  You’re already fighting one handed.  There’s literally no way in Titans-Online to prosecute a war when the defender can literally always drop supers and titans on anything coming in.  You can’t counter that with an equally numbered blob.  Can’t get in first and lock down a system. 
---
If cyno jammers weren’t a thing this war would have proceeded much faster.   
---
If you could blame one thing for the null stagnation cynojammers are your culprit.  Not chat channels.  Not big alliances.
---
This is the most relatable post I ve read here since I returned to EVE and r/eve. Luv it!
---
No it wasnt.  Dont think injectors were introduced into the game for any reason other than a cash grab
---
They don't balance s***
---
My main is currently into ship production. I can keep her in disposable tristans almost indefinitely (102 in the hangar, presently). Our "home" is in .5 space near a few complexes, so we've got that aspect in the bag! 
---
I need to get her talked into playing while I'm at work. Kinda let her find her path.
---
Get her geared for mission running, then Trig Invasions, then Incursions. Everyone likes good isk printing PvE
---
 It's\*

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-4gAetwNkw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-4gAetwNkw)
---
Yep.
---
If you see a lot of small shit while roaming I wonder if you could even fit rapid lights and put the extra fitting into tank and other useful utility. The bonus to the rattle is missile damage, it doesn't say which size. Could be worth a shot. I might play around with that fit when I get home I could be wrong but it's an interesting concept fit.
---
Nice! The wife and I have been gaming together for 11 years now, and I've definitely seen/heard her out more than a few guys in their place lol
---
Oof.  Get that man some aloe
---
Please no. Cyno changes are good. It makes grid control actually important.
---
I haven't messed with the trigs yet
---
What makes you think im acutally invested in your little nullblob snoozefests? On one side or the other? 
---
Mass invites were declared an exploit because they were specifically used to disrupt the gameplay of recipents and fuck with their UI. They were also used to fuck with loaded nodes. 
---
I don´t see how this shouldn´t be relevant anymore. From what i have gathered here we´re not talking about sending 1 or 2 invites to individual players to warp them off from station. We´re talking spamming large amounts of players with invites on a regular basis with dedicated chars/alts with the sole purpose of disrupting gameplay. Which is an exploit and has been for years. Simple as that.
---
If CCP doesn´t enforce that policy anymore then they should release an according official statement and embrace everyone seeding staging systems with 100s of alphas to spam invites in local 23/7.
---
the blackout was more of a *shelbyville* idea
---
200m+ sp on multiple chars, and happy to report am injector free thank you very much!
---
We work jobs we hate, to buy things we don't need, to impress people we don't like.
---
multi rorq minning is mistake, pve without using brain and hands.
---
Said ships being ridiculously OP didn't exactly help. If caps were just another class of ship and not the only class that matters skill injection would probably look a lot less silly right now.
---
(&gt; ◠‿◠)&gt;
---
Test hasn’t been the underdogs since they threw in with the imperium and then horde in high sec
---
BoB would beg to differ. As would CO2, FCON, and a host of other Alliances that are completely gone.
---
I'll probably resub on of my 2 accounts for the heck of it. just for a month.

If I get the email I will just use it to order an extra month.

Exploded is the wrong word for slowly increased linearly over time.

Ok kiddo

Tbf, snuff and RR (a significant part of GotG) are helping Frat here. Just because they’re all goon pets doesn’t mean they get along
---
In regards to game balance

they shouldn’t.  Period.  The megablocs would be the only ones with them (unless they cost more than an emperor palpatine keepstar)
---
but i want it so bad

I'd do it. Everyone starting at zero SP? Fuck yes.

He wanted to appeal to an utter mass of old pvpers to flock back

It didn’t work

I’m not sure nerfing cits would get the short term benefits he wants

Nope. They have cooldown for modules and they didnt use capacitor. LOL

No puff?  Puff puff THEN pass bro
---
God dammit those fucking capitalists trying to make a profit
---
Have you been to the bar?
---
Awesome bar!
---
Gotta believe there’ll be another one... wait em out.  We can wait far longer than they can
---
They arent awful just a little too restricted in my opinion. You're down to 4 viable hulls since you're not going to really use a blops. Wtb cov cyno revamp tho
---
Yeah, citadels aren't quite the power houses that the old POSes were.  But really, it doesn't matter the structure.  If 100+ led by Inner Hell comes knocking on your door in W-space, you're going to have a rough time of it.  They've been on a rampage.
---
But the trick is, have friends.  We knew this way was coming, whether we had a keep or not.  So what you do, unless you want to SD and unanchor everything (we don't), is make contingency plans, prepare to defend, have good relations with some reliable friends, and plan to go out with a blast.
---
They caught us in a more vulnerable position than we're usually in, and at least IH was doing a phenomenal job of hole control, keeping us from bringing our forces back into the hole.
---
In the end, EVE is still an n+1 game.
---
does it though? whenever we encounter another nano comp that usually are great fights. Yes, not a lot ships will die, but it's very demanding and fun to play the positioning games etc.
---
on the downside I've had less opportunity to call people retards and be toxic in general, so down with this sort of thing
---
We're all just Gunner's alts :)
---
Ah thats right. before RMR didn't NPCs have infinite cap?
---
A captain should down with er ship
---
They cant remove local for us all!
---
Sorry stainGuy, you were going to get it but they threw out the chaos era.
---
My take is that the current problems with the game are mostly due to the unholy trifecta of cits, injectors, and caps that make sov warfare a nightmare and, with resource normalization, there's barely any reason to invade anyways.
---
Pre-blackout it was virtually impossible to catch ratters that possessed even half a brain (or bots), but blackout made it so much more dangerous to krab that people just stopped or grouped up. It swung  the pendulum too far in the other direction. I'd like to see delayed local in the future but a lot of changes need to happen first before it makes sense.
---
*Himmler
---
I loved it when inner Hell or odins or BB would crash in on my rorqual.  The feeling of being the prey with about 11b 
---
 on the field with my hulk alts was exhilarating.  Sometimes they’d wipe us.  Sometimes we’d moon walk out.  
---
Good times
---
I think you can just kite everyone except Dagan in this arc out.
---
Was a typo, they were re*local*ing.
---
This entire comment just makes it even more clear that not only do you not play Eve, you have no idea what's going on in Eve, you really don't understand sov null, but also that even after making all these things obvious you still want to tug your own pud and reee out about a game you don't play. This sub has so many experts that don't play the game if they joined together they could easily take Delve.
---
They thought why take the short way
---
Stuff like that often gets mentioned here. I don't know of any current sales (checked last night). There's usually something going on around anniversaries/holidays.

This meme is worn out and annoying

Like I said to your CEO elsewhere in this thread, good luck to you.  Go down swinging at least.  And I hope you're able to safe log some assets if you're not able to pull out a win.  o7

Trig guns change ammo in one tick, why not just swap to long range ammo if your next target is further away?
---
Never saw test fight without their daddy goons, or overwhelming us 3:1 since the war started, funny.
---
You are voluntarily giving up your crown? Well then.
---
Yeah. The real problem is that vets felt special for waiting out a 4 year skill queue.
---
For me it doesn't have to be lore-driven per se.  I'm not a gigantic lore nerd, but I do have a need for things to make sense in the context of the game.
---
Same. lmao.

Meanwhile, I just sold one of Einhar's beasts for 3 exalts. yeah boiiiiiiiiiii

I am sad to see the Ivy flair gone, have you moved on?
---
no
---
&gt;and now extremely rare due to the fact that a pilot would have to extract the rorq skills themselves rather than train battleship 5 over and over. It is a really rough idea, but there it is.
---
What's stopping people from just training Capital Industrial Ship over and over?
---
I thought idea posts were banned
---
It definitely curbed excav use and reduced titan/super ratting (at least where I hunt). But, inversely, it increased how often we were able to catch them.
---
Subcap rating was starting to bounce back when it ended. Problem was that the VNI nerf happened at the same time so subcap ratters took additional time to settle around Myrms and Domis.
---
That was my big problem with all this: CCP threw way too many big changes in too short a time, you can't separate the impact of one from another because the meta never had time to adapt before the next hit. First the blackout, and then as people start coming out of their shells from that we get hit with the VNI nerf. Then supers and rorqs take a hit with the cyno changes.
---
So I only use reddit on my phone thanks for the advice though.

Cynos have become the only module in the game where the t1 variant is more restricted than the t2 variant.

Not yet (I have a few things that I'm working on accomplishing before moving on, which will benefit the Uni, I plan on maintaining ties even after I eventually leave). But Sansha offered me some cool implants. They make me feel really good, so I felt like changing the flair to honor that. I don't get why those Incursions people in their fancy battleships keep showing up to stop Sansha from giving out those implants. Sansha is a generous god.

I beg to differ too, BoB, CO2, FCON those were all EVE Online alliances, Goons looks more like community, its not JUST Eve ally realy, thats what i mean. No matter what you do, they'll always come back again like Karttoon's handywork for example.
---
Idiocy isn't
---
&gt;Also, do you really think supercap "proliferation" before and after injectors is at all alike? Look at that image you posted. Now look at  that image from the goon moveop for the burning of tribute. Now think  about the fact that the first image is 10+ years of production and the  second is from just about 3. 
---
1. Supercaps were rebalanced after that image which has an effect on them being used today.  
---
2. That image in no-way indicates the numbers of supercaps actually available then. 
---
3. The second is also the result of 10 years of production plus the 3. 
---
4. People can still buy characters with high skill points - [https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/character-bazaar](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/character-bazaar)  
---
So this only leads me to conclude that it is not people being able to fly the ships that are the problem but ability to build so many and keep them safe.
---
You can advert open fleets. There used to be a highsec mining fleet up every day.
---
I always assumed it was just him tbh
---
no because i am sure the code would be complicated
---
You are right... about the shredder part
---
New player question: If I would have main character with 12m SP and out of which 1/3, so 4m is in missiles (cuz PVE), is it worth to extract those skills and transfer them to gunnery branch, for PVP/PVE? My main concern is that missile support skills seem to be "one way route", they support only one weapon system (which can be considered a plus), while gunnery support skills are skilled once for 3 systems to use (thus seem more cost effective)  
---
As a new player I wouldnt make long-term plans (in EVE im guessing its like "next week") like "in 2021 I will finish X so I can start Y and by 2024 I finish it and will be able to fly Z" :P
---
No he's not? Why the fuck did I was three minutes on that? It's just some retard streamer yelling about having rats kill things?
---
Ahahaha code doesn't go to the high sec islands. That is funny. Some make it a point to get to those systems. Especially one in gallante space. Never assume you are safe unless you are docked
---
...I don't see how any of that has anything to do with revenue, except maybe the getting sold part. Even that one isn't conclusive though.
---
I’ve noticed the durastic mass reduction compared to their empire counterparts on all the trig ships. I’m wondering if this single gun dread will have the mass of an orca so as to be moved between wormholes easier.    :D
---
For flying a Rorq you don’t need skills. 
---
Same for ratting and other things. 
---
Nobody gives a fuck about a full injected pvp guy. They aren’t the problem.
---
The problem is the players that buy them to fly a rorq/carrier for mining/ratting and shit isks.
---
Honest question - is there a billboard across from their office by chance? I feel like I could get a few dollars together to put some ideas up where they'd have to look at them every day ... ;)

I guess by extension that would also ban idiocy?

Nope

Still bettet than all of you shit lords.
---
I actually enjoyed reading people's ideas, good and bad. Now I dont notice them because I'm not going to randomly open up that post and check to see if the new comments are comments or new ideas. 
---
If they wanted to make it so r/Eve isnt a place where the developers will find ideas anymore, they probably accomplished their goal.
---
I for one miss it too.
---
Reddit is dieing.
---
If that's the image used to describe "proliferation" then it seems puny in comparison. Imagine showing the move op pic to someone in 2010.
---
The previous ten years of super production in are probably a fraction of what is flying around today.  B-R had 200ish Titans total. X47 had almost twice that **per side**.
---
Honestly your Keepstar fit is stupid.

I’ve run into him in space, fought sometimes, ran others.  He is one of the few that genuinely is just enjoying eve without some bullshit agenda metagame to enhance it
---
I mean hell, who gets that excited about 100mil in kills?  He’s just enjoying the game , kudos to it :)
---
&gt; We´re talking spamming large amounts of players with invites on a regular basis with dedicated chars/alts with the sole purpose of disrupting gameplay. 
---
No, actually, that's not what we're talking about. That's what Frat is claiming, but that's not reality. We're talking about several people who prey on the stupid in Frat (basically all of them) by inviting them to fleets and then warping them to their deaths on the nearby citadels. Which is fair play.
---
Frat's been mass reporting the Little Astra team for months. They're not doing anything against the EULA. And I find it ironic that y'all are paying any attention to claims of foul play made by a guy who is himself permabanned for botting and RMT.
---
CCP and EVE is much better off shredding ideas received from you Reddit slum lords.
---
Beers are work is pretty normal
---
If they took away supercapital asset safety they will just safe log.
---
If they take away cit timers everything not in key systems will get glassed
---
if they take away injectors existing supercapital forces will own null forever with no chance of anyone ever making a similar force (damage already done)
---
Gotta address these counterpoints, but that’s game balance in general.
---
Yeah, the trick is letting her find what SHE likes. As an example: I actually like mining, but milady has always been more bloodthirsty :D
---
well i was there defending yours when you gave up

Cool thanks

ADC gives good burst resist, but over time the DCU gives you more sustained tank when repping iirc

Blackout lost us a lot of players, it lasted long enough for people to break the habit of logging in. We can already see the average online players trending back upwards. People aren't coming back overnight, but I'm confident we will get most of the players lost in blackout back. It will just take longer to get them back then it took to lose them.
---
Bring back the nano-canes.
---
I don't see the problem.... Let it expire and resub with the offer an hour later. Should work....
---
I understand that. But also understand that when GSF was defeated time and again, morale was super low. "The North" could have performed numerous crushing blows, but chose not to, giving GSF over 3 years to build up forces, while in those same 3 years the North patted themselves on the back while bleeding members. Now they cry because they are being crushed themselves. The only have themselves to blame, GSF would never have see such massive growth if the North had kept the pressure on.
---
x20 would make it a bit better, but the issue isn’t entirely the quantity
---
It’s effort to remove them.  It should scale, not be a universal “3 timers”
---
You are assuming that cap ratting was balanced... it wasn’t. The whole point was to increase the risk to match the reward... same with super caps.
---
I did that with the last promotion and they told me "sorry we can't retroactively add this promotion to your account"
---
Jokes on you, I been boson ratting with 2 titans with a fax on each titan, and a brick tanked blops ready to go. Also people are super ratting, just not in the usual places.
---
The funny thing about it is it's a cumulative effect, so each time an event or meta or patch or even a major decision from one of the big Alliances just tacks on more shit a new player must crawl through to have a prayer at understanding EVE. I don't know why it feels like this to me in this game, but maybe it's just the huge learning curve which basically adds a cooldown to your information consumption talent every time you have to go Google and dig through posts from six years ago to just to figure out why something is the way it is. I never felt like that with other games no matter how late to the party I was. EVE is like tossing the average American white dude into Cambodia with nothing but a Speak and Spell and two ketchup packets to help you become a native.
---
How come you guys are always there to comment on random posts or shit-talk your own community but are conspicuously silent on player suggestion posts that are wildly upvoted and generally supported by the community?           
---
This isn't community engagement.
---
What’s the counter play to someone immediately warping off because it’s real easy to see someone come into local?
---
And, naturally, the latter is what gets used the most often because it's easier than actually discussing things like adults. Fucking hell, I'm starting to understand why people get driven to drink...
---
Whatever it is, it's been the bane of his life for years. If it wasn't for "EVE" all those other projects - proper projects - would have been ok.

Seagull was great
---
It definitely curved supercap ratting... especially after the cyno changes.
---
Checked that out right after CCP.

There is parking right by it that seems to be free and we walked to all the bigger things to see.
---
I guess that's also where the devs park because I didn't see any other parking near by.
---
He likes to go balls deep.  He gets caught a lot, but usually after he's already killed more than enough to be isk positive on the killboard, and he does it solo 90% of the time these days.
---
I wouldn't say he's THE best, but he's among the best solo pvpers in Eve.
---
Downsizing.
---
It would have increased slowly, not exploded.
---
A lot of skill points are coming from throwaway characters on skill farms. Some people have reported having farms of hundreds of characters because of how profitable it was even after taking the cost of PLEX into consideration. That was not possible without MAJOR investment (for the full duration of character training) before injectors came along.
---
Britain has shit weather half the time, nice weather the other half, but we complain either way.
---
Seagull is the one who implemented citadels, sotyios, rorquals, "farms and fields" and left us with the mess that we have today.
---
She did have a vision tho which we don't have today
---
As someone who routinely overcommits in frigates, I get it. 
---
You’d have to be someone who values killboard stats to care about that stuff I guess.
---
Honestly, I prefer friendly rivalry to outright hatred. Hate tends to do ugly things to people.
---
Bravo dude
---
Skilling quickly into the biggest ships wasn't a problem.
---
There was a problem of new player retention. Alpha/omega clones were a good step to fix this. Skill injectors, in their current form, were not. The only thing they were good for is grabbing quick cash.
---
Fuck this game. Blackout made it interesting again. Now we're back to Intel safety for the majority of the player base and the enablement of bots. 
---
Because a bunch of whiney null bears felt an area that's not supposed to be safe wasn't safe enough. Fucking retards.

They'll pick out those 4 shitty ideas for "chaos era" and ignore the 95 good/decent ones.
---
With cloaks balancing local you were never going to see a large recovery of subcap ratting with blackout in my opinion. You would see another exodus if cloaks were hit to keep local gone and balanced.
---
Seeing as subcap krabbing was not a problem beyond bots, the return of local is probably the best bet if they are not prepared to spend dev time on a real solution.
---
I just spoke to my friend CPP Hilmeth and he said he will implement every suggestion with at least 20 upvotes by monday. He will also turn on BLACKOUT again, but in jita only.

People were farming capital characters for sale before injectors; if someone's willing to pay x billion isk for injectors to fly caps, it makes sense they'd be willing to pay it for a character. And with injectors the real world cash requirements are greatly increasing the cost.
---
I get that this subreddit hates injectors, but honestly, they've been selling them for three years now. The only reason 90% of the people who skill injected to fly caps over that time wouldn't be flying them on their own now would be if they quit the game first because waiting for skills was boring, which isn't really a better solution.
---
I made the final table for that! It's a good bar, I remember very little else
---
You're flatly wrong, and if you were to hold a picture of todays EvE post injectors up next to that photo you'd be laughed out of whatever building you were in.
---
Still salty about earlyer?
---
This is a good meme
---
...and a cyno-breacher-jammer to jam the cyno breacher breaching the cyno jammer...
---
I thought black ops cynos can be lit in cyno jammed systems? Did I not hear that correctly?
---
&gt; They are the very thing that allowed the faucets to be opened full bore.
---
Not if CCP had locked out certain skills from having points applied to them, then they would have been just another way for new players to get ahead. In my opinion, Advanced Spaceship Command and any skills that require it should be impossible to apply banked skill points to; inject as much as you want, but you'll need to learn how to fly capital ships the old-fashioned way.
---
Because they're allowed to. And, yes it is. Who made you so entitled?
---
Found the poor.
---
noitch... updoot
---
All things good on intention. And were hilariously spammed by us players. 1 or 2 rorquals legit isn't bad. But being able to scale them to a large extent is the problem. If mining/pve was just in some manner way less AFK'able.
---
Put it on the suggestion megathread.
---
Holesome.
---
Nice shot. I haven't spent much time in shattered wormholes, but I sure want to once I get skilled enough to run them. The ancient races of New Eden fascinate me, I want to learn so much more about them!
---
Blops cynos do work in jammed systems. But you can't jump caps to them. He wants a way to jump caps into jammed systems.
---
They mostly just 1 shot you into armor.
---
Po-ta-to
---
Congrats :)
---
Take your updoot, this is a good one.
---
No U!
---
Ratting and mining is what keep up the sov indices, preferably in caps. It's repetitive and mindless until a hunter comes along. Too bad you deleted your post.
---
In France we have nice weather 2/3 of the time, so we complain about nice weather.
---
I don't know why do you make suggestions if you don't even expect them to read them.
---
So, you want a deployable that allows cynos in a jammed system. 
---
You suggest that it would have a 15 minute to 1 hour onlining timer.
---
If you have the fleet to defend this thing for 15 to 60 minutes, why aren't you just attacking the jammer?
---
Or do you want it to not appear on overview, so that you can deploy it at a deepsafe, then an hour later, jump in your caps?
---
(Which isn't an awful idea at all)
---
What ship and fit were you using?
---
On the other hand, I was eve free for over 2 years, and all the recent drama got me to log back in.

Same.

Most of our content at the moment is continuing the forever war in Providence, but really rekking crew is made up of a variety of entities with their own niche's and we come together when we need the combined numbers to take a fight.
---
Control over lowsec all depends on who can exert power in the area, we fight for the sake of fighting and have carved out a reasonable area of lowsec and providence as a result.
---
Members are expected to be fully self supporting and as a result we have members doing a wide variety of activities across the game. We can teach members how to make money but it will be up to them to actually go out and do it.
---
I would take a lot of it to IV first so you can do stuff while you wait for V. Also don't neglect your engineering and navigation skills.
---
The pirate shipyards are an obviously abandoned feature that are so broken. I agree completely with your idea for the faction caps.
---
Hilmar needs more spear throwing practice.
---
Straight to the 'In' box.
---
you're not wrong
---
Ask for help in local and while you have someone's attention, have them help you fit your ship better.
---
Just buy a permit and follow the Code. Make friends with the gankers and tank your mining ship and you'll be fine.

Every time I see him in Delve, I fit up something as a good fight for him. I send him the fit out of fairness because I can see his, then we solo. I've won, he's won, either way I always try to give him a fun and fair fight in the land of Delve.

Omega skills will not train on alpha status. A porpoise is a booster. It sucks at mining. Pop can happen day one...SF spectre fleet. In game channel.

They could work arond some SP for special story missions\\achievements (like reaching Thera) for a certain skill cap. There should be game desighners for that kind of thing (or just browse r/eve , people post that kind of stuff constantly ) . But [cpp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d708de/ccp_and_sugestions/)  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Hey, just trying to help. It's a multiplayer game, and is better when you make friends/allies.
---
[source](http://www.poorlydrawnlines.com/)
---
Well yes, Porpoise seems to be a booster, however after Retriever it is the first ship with double the ore hold. Seems like a win if I don't have to go docking so often. Oh well I'll try to keep it on Omega then. Will see in a month time.
---
Yeah but I don‘t see frat members crying here.

Plus, frat actually builds up a new power block which will Improve nullsec experience for everybody while legacy is already a pet of Imperium

[This song of theirs was posted here before, and it's the best IMO.](https://soundcloud.com/cpt-blastahoe/the-woods) He's updated and added more music though, most of his soundcloud just look for EVE related names and there it is. Some others as well are too if you want to look for them.

But if i bathe I definitely won't be able to play EVE anymore.  My patchy neckbeard will be clean and I just won't fit in.

WTB:  All of the talent that left years ago.  Willing to trade anything that's left
---
Maybe it's a practice effect... you spend lots of time in WHs? Scan dozens of sigs every day?
---
I've just in the last week or so gone back to exploration after a long break. I'm finding that using the flat face on one side to line the box up with the sig in the 1st two dimensions generally leaves me with a dirt-simple arrow drag to get the 3rd, while I might fuck it up a bit dragging the face the 2nd time.
---
Probably I should intentionally slapdash the placement sometimes to get a better feel for exactly how precise it needs to be. Maybe I'm working harder than I have to.
---
There are definitely issues with the stuff she oversaw, but from internal leaks and such it sounds like the execs wouldn't actually let her really do anything, so there's no telling if the fail was on her or on them.  Considering she at least had a vision and peaced the fuck out of the sinking ship, I'm more inclined to think it was on them.
---
You are going to need a bigger boat
---
just goes to show that CCP never understood its playerbase (or listened when everybody told them that this was going to happen).
---
Screw all these suggestions, assert your dominance and put her in a venture on a rock!
---
i know it might be a joke, but if its realy 10 year anniversary of goons, then they shulde freeport a random citadel and sell a random t1 frig and we can have a nice free for all 
---
just drop like 20 depos next to it so ppl have stuff to warp to and just shoot how ever you land next to 
---
ofc ppl whulde need to set deat clones in that citadel so it might be a problem later if they dont unachor it after the event
---
Hell, maybe CCP should add old-school skill grinding to the current system as a supplement to what's already there. Players can leave their character in the hangar waiting for their skills to train up, or they can go out, fly their ship around, and maybe shoot up some rats or other players to decrease the amount of time it takes for them to learn that particular skill. I don't know if it would be a "when time/kills = X, add Y points" system or a small multiplier to the training speed, but I think the idea is at least worth consideration.
---
Idea: make caps not instantly appear in the system they are jumping to (make it take say as long as warping 25au if you are jumping max distance) and if the cyno dies while your jumping you just appear randomly in the system instead of on the cyno. Then give all T2 ships cyno but you can't activate an ADC while the cyno is up.
---
who?
---
Because players are shit at game design.  Look at what they did to WoW.
---
Not every super could be safelogged. 
---
Maybe more regions need glassing.
---
I would go after capital production. Limit the number of caps that can be produced by a capital shipyard in a azbel or sotyio to what you could do if you put posses up everywhere. This would go hand in hand with making it easier to kill citadels: vulnerable cap production.
---
Hilmar actually seems pretty keen on trying new shit to save the game.  The problem is that it's held hostage by people thinking that the goal is to optimize ratting.
---
Find a C1 WH corp get her into WH space. If she can get over that hurdle as a new player with you to guide her, the rest of eve will be smooth sailing.
---
Only the big burly male ones
---
Yes. Very much worth getting into. Don't let this sub bother you. I've been playing 7 months and am still having as much fun as I did day 1. Get into a newbro Corp ASAP. You'll get access to support that's so crucial early on. I'm partial to Eve uni but I've heard good things about pretty much all the reputable organizations. You can always branch out later.
---
To be honest this sub is probably the biggest hurdle to this games' future success. Lots of ridiculous negativity and shrieking. Ignore it because if you're having fun that's all that matters. I know I still am.
---
The only people that actually thought removing local without fixing any of the real issues would do anything positive for the long term health of the game are the same people, are either people who don't play EVE at all, or lick so many windows that they're going for a worl record
---
with that resume, I would recommend NASA

Tbh i would just put some tank on my haulers. cargo rigged itty 5 with 5 cargo expanders isn't a tanky beast.

I run a small Corp we run some stations in  highsec Genesis region also some in a class 2 wormhole. If your interested message me. I my Corp is mostly just me myself and I with a few personal friends I've know from my early days in eve. We have some allies a group that has we *share* our wormhole with.
---
But I run public moon mining stations and happily take *newbies* under my wing.  You look like your in a good position to run class 2 content maybe even 3 and it pays way better than mining and missions. Only thing you may need is scanning skills you didn't mention them.
---
There's been to many changes to just go over so it will be like a *whole new wooorrrlllddd...* Achemm.. citidels are probably the biggest tho.
---
What did you do before you left? Mining and missions?
---
Direct message me for I'm game name Reddit is to public.
---
Man, this sub is a special breed of somethin'.
---
So...WWB again?
---
If you're thinking long-term, I'd keep it. Missiles are not worthless in PVP, as long as you're doing something other than big blobs. You're that much closer to being ready for a Sacrilege or Cerberus.
---
Man that's funny. I don't even like this sub and that's funny.
---
This.. t2 haulers or bust. And don't haul anything worth much in a t1 like 100m is pushing it..

LOL
---
&lt;end&gt;
---
reddit chaos era is starting
---
You might stay on grid for longer but you'll mine less. If an account goes from Omega to alpha, the training speed halves and all omega skills will stop training
---
Yes this. Next move is orca mines more holds more. Oh and try mining moons.
---
Most likely the electricity cost for running your computer is more than what you make isk mining.
---
You’re better off with a prof honestly especially if you want to afk. You’ll have faster mine times even though you’ll have to dock more often. The speed of mining drones on a porp is severely outclassed by the tank and mining speed of the proc, even with the bigger ore hold.
---
Now, if you wanted to multibox a proc/covey and a porp, that is definitely a win win. I currently run two procs and an orca and can pull in 180k m3 in about 60-90 minutes.
---
yes, let's nerf ganking further after quadrupling the EHP of freighters, disallowing bumping longer than 180 seconds, and removing 3 ganking tools over the last 6 years
---
That noobs think they need injectors to play this game is a big failure on ccp’s fault.  No new player should every spend real money to buy injectors or plex. All it does is make them an expensive loss mail.
---
Why the three months till combat ready? Only need power grid 5 CPU 5 and basic combat skills to do some basic pve or scanning. 
---
Exploration is super easy right out the gate just beeline for astero t2 relic and lvl4 scanning skills. That's like... 2 months if you wait for it all.
---
 Just go out and do it, You'll get more personal experience that way. Which is worth way more than any amount of skill points.
---
Count me in
---
Let me know what you come up with it does sound interesting.  I believe the rattlesnake bonus is ANY missle - I usually choose cruise missiles so I can chill at max drone link distance and yeet missiles at the big stuff.  But yes the cruise missiles are useless on anything small and fast I might as well throw tomatoes at them.
---
I remember this one
---
And anyone sporting this would became an instant target.
---
why go for the trifecta when the root problem is alts ?

There is a thread to put this in that is stickied

---
&gt;Even sticking with blackout might have been better in the long run, at least that doesn't alienate literally every group of players at once
---
Exactly this, It was a bad call to go with this version of blackout given the player offered alternatives achieved the same ends but were received better on the forums and reddit. But once they chose to go this way they needed to stick it out because going half way over that bridge and then going back pisses off both groups of players and destroys what little remaining trust CCP had with the player base.
---
If you have in mind doing some abyss around t4/t5 then there's problem of blinging either those HACs or char with implants :P
---
Maybe you are right, I used to live in one but logistics of doing anything was a pain. Either LS jumps with scout or scouting a WH route. I never made much ISK there and left. But I know others made it work, so there is that
---
As mentioned put ammo in your gun, laser, missle launcher, etc..and in your cargo. When the weapon runs out it will load from cargo. You really should be able to carry about 100 times more ammo than you would actually need. Possibly more than that.
---
Well said and spot on!
---
Thanks
---
While you are correct that Init is predominantly EUTZ, there are a couple of very healthy USTZ corporations. It’s more of a small gang environment in USTZ. I usually know everyone on comms during my normal play times and we all get along well. Some of us caught a case of children over the years, so low intensity game play is more common than big fleets or long roams.

IDEA: Cargo Scanner Jammer
---
It would be interesting to see a new module that Jams Cargo Scanners - obviously with skills they could jam better or worse, on the flip side, give cargo scanners the ability to bypass a scan similar to how the salvagers work.
---
Cargo Scanner Jammer - 5% increase per level to jam incoming scan attempts, passive.
---
Scanner Hacker Module - 5% increase per level to bypass a scanner jammer.
---
This would basically make jita/gate suicide gankers a little more RNG. I hate losing my stuff as much as anyone, however, this could be what makes or breaks that ship.
---
The jammer just seems to be something someone would invent .
---
Edit: failing to break a scan would allow the cargo holder to see the "Yellow targeting" flash.
---
Why do people honk when they see two cars about to hit each other?  It reflex, everyone keeps hoping that some day hilmeth will wake up, pull his head out of his ass, and put someone in charge who actually knows shit.
---
Do I look like I know what  jpeg is?
---
it has been announced that i will get a new boss at my work (which will hopefully lift some responsibilities off my back), and  my current boss just granted me a raise (because i have so many responsibilities), and i'm super happy about that :)
---
otherwise i think that i will return to eve for a while and finally try to write that tool that will help me with trading (even if there are so many tools around i want to make a new one to practice some coding)

also i am super happy that this sub is still active and that test is still relevant :)

The reason is always the same with these groups, north didnt crushed goons as a literally single worthy oponent to not to loose a potential content for the future so north folks would be hangar spinning untill eve shuts down and i think goons now realize that nobody will fully engage them at this very point.
---
Other groups, be it chinesse, legacy, panfam or sort, could fight eachother at any time given a reason, well... goons cannot. So they are doomed to 3rd partying if Test batphones them that is untill something or someone strong enough pops up. For now, they cut themselves off any serious action whatsoever, and iam quite sure they know, thats how i see it.

You can't scream ccp/hilmar/dev fotm sucks after succesfully keeping a game afloat for 15 years. I have also seen 0 evidence that ccp is ignoring or ignorant of the Moustache  List.  Seeing how they appear to be in panic mode atm you can bet your ass they are going over the csm meetings and actual good Reddit posts to filter some short term solution to stop the bleeding. 
---
Although i personally think it is more a generation issue then a broken game issue. Modern games are all short, intense and lack a long term goal besides grinding. It appears to be what gets picked up by the new gen and the old gen is tapping out due to jobs, kids and stuff. 
---

I sprayed it with regular primer and filled the seams with putty, you can see some globby bits near the center from the primer. 
---
I did try and paint it but the accents didn't come out well at all because I had some terrible masking tape so I never finished the paint job.
---
I don't think anyone cares about the keepstar being killed, it's more that everyone will go around complaining about wspace being dead / uninhabited, and when targets pop up like this the biggest parts of wspace blue each-other instead of entertaining the possibility of a multi-way brawl.
---
Then get better at isk making 4head

Watching this after the stuka fight in rage makes me giggle like a little girl

Since then I believe every invasion has either been in lowsec, or required going through low to get to the foothold. There was a cycle that required traveling through several jumps of lowsec to get to any of them, with even the lowsec ones being in deep low (often they are one jump from high)
---
I don't remember if I got any of the in-game prizes, I probably did there.  What I never got were the CCP prizes. The free Eve Vegas ticket and the Frigates of Eve book (if that ever even came out).

The problem I'm referring to is people buying skilled toons, not the time it takes to skill. Wouldn't you rather make money selling an accessory for your product than let someone else buy your product, "enhance" it, and resell it? Of course it's a cash grab, but its a cash grab that had a "justification" at the time of release

Bring t1 frigs and get really close to the ball of titans, if they dd they will kill their own titans

If FRT is building a new power block why do they desperately need to blue all of the north? If I wanted to bitch I would. If this is botching to you then I feel bad for you when life hits you in the face with real problems. This is a discussion so far.

He isnt trying to save it, he is trying to get more bodies in it to appease his Korean Overlords to get enough cash for his golden parachute.

As for passing on accounts: Nah. Every person is their own story. Some are more interesting than others, but it's their story they can be individually proud of.

Is there a point to buying 10 chrap ships?
---
Can you set them to fly in formation or will they just remain in a hangar collecting dust?
---
they use a new toon every day or two

Bottom right corner of the picture.

Depending on where he lives, this is more accurate than you realize.
---
I never gotten dropped in my super because the hunters don't go after targets with good tank and who are clearly awake and ready to fight back.
---
&gt;The previous ten years of super production in are probably a fraction of what is flying around today.  
---
The time to make supers does not seem to have changed that much. Im not sure how you can correlate manufacturing supers in 10 years to manufacturing supers in 3 years and come up with the answer that 3 years somehow, somehow has managed to outproduce a decade of supercap manufacture. 
---
B-R was 5 years ago, somehow it is inconceivable that half a decade later there would be twice as many supers?
---
You know this is a Pax parachute account right?

Print off that "long ass list of changes" and hand it to falcon in person
---
what is wrong with pilgrim?
---
&gt; You're flatly wrong

If you see my previous answer to a previous reply to this post you will see why I think it is credible. I don't think you understand the economics of how supers come into existence. Skill injectors does not = More Supers. More Supers = more Supers. The number of pilots that can fly supers is irrelevant tot he equation.

how much dps is dealing triglavian ark?

No joke,  we have almost killed friendly supers that way

If you need cores go Threadripper or don't bother(or go Epyc). Intel is in deep shit right now. November is coming and expect new parts with PCI-e 4.0 and 32+ cores. Intel is dead for HEDT space this year. They should have brought in the c621/Purley/LGA 3647 platform for Skylake-X, not stick with the LGA 2066/X299.

I am sure they can. But I am want to join it. Count me in

Okay I really want something like this but have no access to a printer, how do I need to throw money at?

To be fair he did say "anymore" at the end.

or with tongue
---
probably too much for a dread, if thats what youre thinking
---
Okay, if we both have new characters with 100m isk and yours has 1m SP and mine has 20m SP, I will curb stomp your character 10/10 times. There is absolutely no way any great pilot with 1m SP could win a 1v1 against an average FW pilot with 20m SP. It just isn't feasible. Skills points matter.
---
Wormholer, btw.

Want Gud fights yet spam fake fleet invites. Local looked like Jita. For shame TEST

I didn’t read the entire post, most of those suggestions are fucking retarded. They are backwards steps from what the game needs. Reddit of full of a bunch of crying null bitches. HTFU FFS!

Or just fleet yourself and an alt.
