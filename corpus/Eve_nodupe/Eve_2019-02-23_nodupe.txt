Text post didn't do well, better delete and repost as a link. Surely it will go better this time
---
If you read Olmeca post carefully what he say in line 1 is the opposite of what he say in line 10.
---
Like for example complaining about how safe delve is, how no one can hurt goons, how untouchable rorqual mining is, ten line later "Look how I stole 1 tril from goons by booshing drones it's so easy to rekt goons". Or more recent : "look how easy it's to kill pleb, not on coms, not on fleet, never align etc" 10 line later (btw those 10 line are mostly "huh I'm great") "Join us to kill pleb in delve, it's too hard to kill them, we struggle to kill them, we have to come up with new hunt method every time we catch one". 
---
Olmeca and truth don't go along, Olmeca is a broken spinning machine if you insist I can give you way more example (like complaining about mean goons saying bad thing on reddit while making a post to harass someone with RL pic of him) 
---
i know. I have done my share of dying to sleepers ;) I was curious if you could run gas labs in a stratios though. i’ve seen them around on occasion and tried one in a myrmidon once, but dies pretty fast.

I'm pretty sure Aryth has mentioned on the Meta Show that he brings in about a tril a month from market fuckery. Not sure how much of that he holds onto, but I'm guessing he's got a hell of a lot more than 10 tril.

I've seen several vids, every single one has fallen miles short of being proof of anything except for leet pvpers not understanding how hotkeys work when ratting and mining. The last one was posted by some idiot who doesn't understand hotkeys, the one before that was some idiot who doesn't understand the cycle time on ice mining drones.
---
oy vey shut it down 
---
Yeah, see, the real problem is us just not understanding hotkeys. It's easy to pull 100 excavators on the same tick. You just have to set your hotkeys up right. 
---
Fine. I'm mining in Jita. Come at me!
---
Sometimes I wonder if this is partly a killboard thing. Don't get me wrong, I think killboards being considered the be all and end all rather stupid (but then I'm also a logi pilot) although it seems to be what everyone uses. 
---
However killboard are based on ISK lost and efficiency is only counted on that too. We see killboard brags where people drop fleets multiple sizes larger than their enemy but because they have a big blingy kill, apparently we are meant to be in awe.
---
I wonder if things were changed slightly, where say how much ISK you drop on the fleet was taken into account. A 80bil fleet attacking a 5bil fleet and shock horror has minimal losses shouldn't be 99.9% efficient. It's not efficient to throw 80bil ISK at a 5bil ISK enemy. 
---
...and there's a shitload of them in Jita right now.  I wonder what sort of large coordinated "thing" that takes place every year in Jita might be kicking off this weekend.  Nah, couldn't be related to that.  The mining and ratting in Jita is so famously good, that it's obviously got to be *that*.
---
More like 1 or 2 goons, that made hundreds of chatting bots are mocking CCP'e anti-cheat attempts.
---
But..... that's a lobster.....
---
After goons burned Jita with alphas last year, I'm shocked they'd do the same thing again.

And that's the problem. You don't have videos of 100 excavs getting pulled, the videos posted have shown a max of 30 being pulled in 10 seconds... not 1 tick. If it makes you feel better then by all means keep making shit up and then posting videos that show something else, but until you link a video that actually shows what you actually claim to have seen you are going to continue to have people not believe a word you say because why should they?
---
Or more like a few hundred goons made alts for burn jita ?

plz send me 1 billion so I may save the goons from themselves

---
PANIC is fine if it just protects smaller ships. It's literally never used to save barges/etc but that should have been its main function.
---
Delete the ability for PANIC to protect the Rorqual that's using it.
---
Then just make a full flight of max yield excavators as strong as an unboosted retriever. So using a barge has merit because of the boosts. Then reduce excavator prices to 100m each.
---
Local delay while gate-jump cloak is active. You show up in local once you decloak.
---
Fucking do NOT delete asset safety, life before it was stupid and being locked out of assets for weeks with payment required is already pretty awful for people who don't evac in the current day. Buff citadel salvage instead as 'money'. Adding QOL is not removing Eve's hardcore nature.
---
1 citadel timer per day, with the first timer vulnerable at all times. Low power structures get the initial RF and go straight to the kill timer after, exiting at the time you finished the reinforce.
---
Delete large and small skill injectors, keep daily alphas but make them consumable by alpha and omega alike as they stop working at 20m SP and you can only use one a day anyway. Keep the 'catch-up' mechanic as it should have been, for getting new players at least *somewhat* up to speed.
---
Certainly no shortage of nullsec groups to choose from for mining, and you can definitely make decent income from mining in their space. Some do this as an organized activity regularly. Other corps let their members do as they please for the most part. I can list a few examples here of places to go. You'll find safe mining space in large parts of the "south," and I can personally speak for Esoteria being a decently safe and profitable place to mine. I'd imagine Goon space is similar albeit a bit busier (due to their higher member count), and I'm sure there are parts of the North that are quiet and safe to mine in (although PHord space is generally content heavy and thus probably a less desirable mining desto). There's tons of others to choose from as well, just giving you a couple examples. 
---
Now, "safe" is a relative term here. You have Intel and you generally have blues to protect you. But you're still vulnerable to ganks, bomber fleets, roaming gangs, etc. Cloaky campers in bombers often infest the "best" mining systems with the highest ore yields. So there are tradoffs. I'd personally still choose null for mining given these concessions. I'm a frequent often solo roaming pvp player but I do also enjoy hanging out on comms and chewing rocks from time to time on my capital alt. It's fun hanging out with other members of my alliance, and also exciting when someone gets tackled which pretty much happens daily. You can probably find the social aspect of mining in highsec groups, but you probably won't get as much of the latter pvp content, not to mention all the other kinds of stuff you're free to try out in nullsec (ratting, pvp both solo and fleet, Indy, explore, etc). Best of luck to you; hope I gave you some ideas of where to go from here. 
---
Depends on what you are calling a living wage. You need ~1.8bil to Plex plus the ships you plan to lose to "have fun". If you fly cheap fits then you can probably get by with 2-2.5bil per month. 
---
OP isn't whining for some sort of a magical risk-free solution, they're asking for advice as to how best to mitigate risk in game.  It's no different than a noob asking for advice on a PVP fit.  What's wrong with that?
---
this is the first year that goons have burned jita with bots, the last few years it has been in aid of their charity (suddenly seamen)
---
Whoa.  Look how much content can be made when everyone isnt in a rorq
---
Neut/scram them and let the rats they're fighting finish them off?
---
&gt; Don’t be a Goofus! Buy a mining permit and follow the code. If you do that, you’ll always win, always!
---
Yeah, because CODE always respects mining permits religiously, and *never* ganks permit holders for shits and giggles.
---
well, obviously, jet fuel does not melt steel beams!
---
That is true. 
---
LMAO I can't believe anure batphoned nsh instead of fighting solo
---
Not their fault init are incapable of fighting back.
---
lol more like "Yall are fags and I'm an Iraq combat veteran!"
---
Honestly, my only gripe about skins is how some ships get all the love, and some are stuck with a couple of relatively boring options.
---
I like this idea, but as a lowsec solo ratter I’m not sure much would change in my area. Not much goes on in terms of PVP, and there just generally isn’t much thru-traffic so all the old treaties and alliances would stay standing. Maybe in some areas it would work better, but it would be status quo near me.

Compare this to injectors, where you just throw a week of mining at them and inject another.
---
Understood, and tbf we try to limit NER posts to no more than 3 a week so as not to overspam/come across too clickbaity. 
---
I think people on staff like Lasker who have their own audience but publish via NER can get away with a direct link, but everyone else needs to be a tad cautious with it. Until now we've been leaving that to the writers' discion, but perhaps we need to draft up a policy and explain why. We didn't want to recruit people then issue them with a rule-set controlling how they post stuff, but having said that I'd rather not see a writer post a link then get yelled at, so there probably is a middle ground.
---
We are legit chatting with mods atm, because whilst we like putting up solid posts, anything that causes an issue in feedback probs also does for them in terms of reports.
---
If you have any further suggestions here (or if anyone else wants to jump in) feel free, keeping an eye.
---
next up - zkill to be removed as it "harasses" people by making their killmails visible to the public.

I guess it depends on your definition of passive. There isnt anything more passive in terms of apm than vni ratting - 8 actions per hour.

That's absolutely not true, but I'm over trying to convince goons of anything. Even when confronted with irrefutable evidence, your response is "well thanks for getting rid of this asshole" without ever acknowledging that you knew he was there all along. I don't have to prove anything to your standard. I already know nothing will change. CCP doesn't care. You don't care. I don't owe you a goddamn shred of video because I could provide CCTV footage of you input broadcasting from your desk chair and you'd claim it was someone else. I'm not in the business of convincing goons of anything anymore.

There is a post on the front page of /r/eve right fucking now about a well-known goon RMTer. It's filled with goons saying "ah well everyone knew, but thanks for getting rid of him."

I'd be cautious doing a proper operation in multiple hubs, it'd be a lot of order updating a day, so I'd keep one as your main focus to maintain sanity. In general a mix of volumes is a good idea, but one thing to bear in mind is that outside jita it's crazy hard to make enough on the high volume/low margin items to be worth the effort. Make sure you look at the eve-uni page too, especially the parts about selecting items, it's a decent intro.
---
The most important thing after that is to set up a spreadsheet to carefully monitor profit on every item you trade in - you often make a lot more or a lot less money on an item than you'd expect given the market statistics. It lets you prioritise items too, so if you don't have much time for whatever reason you've got a subset you can do quickly. You can use [this](https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/GESI) add-on to import transactions to a Google sheets document to automate everything. You could use something like eve-mogul instead too, but I like to organise everything in a way that eve-mogul doesn't let me.
---
It doesn't cost much to try a small order for a new item, so try loads and see what actually makes money for you. A good time saver for finding potentially profitable items is [this](https://www.adam4eve.eu/tradeVol_type.php) site - you can use it to find items that actually have enough volume and isk moved a day across enough orders to make money before you look at the in-game stats. Once I've started trading in an item, my personal rule of thumb is that if it averages less than 2 mil profit a day, and it's had at least 1 weekend of trading (profits tend to spike massively over the weekend, so especially for low volume items you might make nothing on an item before its first weekend), it's not worth continuing. Anything over 5 mil a day goes in a separate quickbar folder and I check more often. It doesn't sound like a lot, but 120 items at 5 mil a day each adds up fast. Until you find yourself actually limited by available capital, don't stress too much about the margin of each item as long as you're actually making a profit - at first you're much more likely to be limited by finding good items and the number of orders you can put up. [Elinor](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=141726&amp;find=unread) is a good program for 1 click assessment of margins.
---
It eats a lot of time finding a good set of items, and building your spreadsheet, but once you're all set up it only takes about 15-20 minutes once or twice a day to keep everything going. I've found, at least in the smaller hubs, babysitting your orders and 0.01isking people all day barely increases your profits.
---
I found it way harder than it should be to find much information online on station trading, so feel free to ask any questions.

There isn't really a guide though there is a guy who documented his experiences while playing as a alpha until he earned enough to buy a plex. Not at home so can't try to look it up but exploration can net you some really good money and a bit of luck with combat sites in hi sec may also provide a bit of isk.
---
Maybe that would encourage people to fight over moons.

that's why you make specialized alts with a max amount of 50/80m SP, after that you SP farm it.

You generally still used fleet warp even input broadcasting. Was just more reliable.

naaw the game was always pay to win. it just got more expensive.
---
i was roaming around null sec in my wolf, and the enemies decided to drop only 2 supercarriers on me instead of the usual 10. very cool of them :).
---
for me it's not the sub that turns me away. it's just that the game is no longer fun with the lack of meaning of loss and fucked economy.
---
i know it can't recover so why keep putting effort in
---
I wish I would be as lucky as you. 
---
Can I have some of your botting income?
---
the great thing about alphas is not having to grind for plex while still being able to do almost everything the game has to offer. Most nullsec groups have alpha corps or accept alpha players, lowsec FW is very good for casual PVP and highsec has alpha corps open for a wide range of activities. I'm not too sure what WH space has to offer for alpha clones.

This guys is a level 3 dodge 
---
Efficiency is to use the minimal amount of time, energy and resources to achieve your goal. The goal being to kill the blingy ships but its not efficient to drop multiple times that blingy ship worth to kill it, whether you suffer loses or not.
---
If I want to kill a big, ugly spider. The efficient way would be to get some fly spray, spray it, wait for it to die and clean up corpse. All over in five minutes and cost barely anything.
---
If I was to get an exterminator in, it would achieve the same result but instead of five minutes of time, I would have to take a day, put my cat into a cattery, leave the house for a few hours, cost me a lot more money etc.
---
In the end the spider is dead but one is hardly efficient. If I spend 10b ISK to get a 1b ISK kill, it's hardly efficient even if I can use that ship multiple times. 
---
But I guess when I see these bragging killboards, the first thing I look at is the different sizes in fleet and the different ships. I love seeing a good fair fight. 
---
Marshy == Olmeca ? Since when ? I know they both fight at the same level (pretty low for any decent human kind) but they are not the same, it's like Cancer and HIV both shitty thing but not the same
---
I did the math and if you're still getting 400k from LSI it's about 2500isk per skill point compared to about 6000isk per skill point from the booster, soo you need to be getting like 200k per LSI for the boosters to be worth it

Well atm I'm multi boxing rorquals but want to move into something I can walk away from my computer at any time without leaving 100b on grid so not overly stressed with managing a large number of orders.
---
And yeah the 0.1 Isk thing is a lot of effort and only seems required if you want move things fast. In my previous experimentation I found that updating once a day was enough for items to move due to price fluctuations.
---
I'll check out the links you put in there when I get home and have a play around, I imagine until my market alts train up though that orders are going to limit me far faster than capital will for the time being.

I've got a spread sheet for price comparison between hubs and am looking to factor in hauling costs to that somehow as well(just for paying public haulers) to see what the profit would be and then work out my regular items from there I guess.

---
Ssshhhh, let the, think no one noticed that, it will make them feel better.
---
I think you are confusing the posts about pleb with the posts about nolak. The posts about pleb consist of "thanks for killing him everyone knows he's shit". The posts about nolak mostly consist of "WOW, didn't know he was RMT but his loan rates were trash and he was basically a loan shark and everyone knew it, nothing of value lost."
---
"daily or near-daily PVP content" is a very context-dependent metric. If you're looking at a wormhole corp and that's what they advertise, run! That's a very low amount of total pew for people consistently looking for trouble. On the other hand, types of PVP content vary. If you're looking for 100+ person fleets, maybe daily or near-daily is a good amount. (A wormhole corp like mine doesn't get those ever.)
---
Don't worry, he's moved on to ships that float in water. Which amuses me greatly, since, for the most part, they are holes in the water you throw money into.
---
i just want to give you a big round of applause for locating the joke. excellent work, detective
---
Gevlon was great cause he got enough of the basics right, but then went completely off the rails when trying to talk about the meta. 
---
Have a station in that system get attacked by the rats is how I found one.
---
Buying plex is kind of a trap for new players, because just like you said, it prevents you from learning the value of isk. Furthermore, newbies don't know how to wisely use it yet. My advice would be to try a bunch of different activities and join some corps to find out what you like to do. After that, if you want to buy plex to help yourself get financially established, it's not a terrible idea. I also recommend paying your subscription with real money. A lot of new players I see trying to grind up \~1.7b a month for their plex and it just kills any enjoyment of the game.
---
Yeah. I kinda try to assum Olmeca would judge every potential input broadcaster like he lies the ones he "busts" with his videos.
---
Its ok you can dual box alpha and omegas completely undetected still, so you can burn jita and spod at the same time
---
Star citizen is gonna rip eve to shreds
---
Stop playing in a way I don’t like!
---
There may be guides out there (I haven't seen them), but I can answer a few of your questions in a single sentence each, so let's do that.
---
&gt;best race
---
Literally doesn't matter unless you plan to roleplay your character's faction.
---
&gt;best ships
---
A ship in this game is a tool for a specific job. As an alpha clone, you have two choices: You can either train generally and be really bad at a few things, or you can train for a specific thing and start an alt if you want to train into a different thing. Since you're an alpha clone, the disadvantages of true specialist training are minimized. Make. Alts.
---
&gt;best skills 
---
See the previous answer.
---
&gt;best activities
---
There are MANY activities in this game. The best activities are the ones that you enjoy, followed by the ones that enable you to access the ones that you enjoy. Some may be inaccessible as an alpha because they require T2 modules or ships (e.g. you can't cloak, so no blopsing for you). They're the exception, not the rule.
---
Imagine thing those accounts were fresh
---
I don't partake in the Burn Jita event but I do enjoy the salt.
---
if they are alphas then the MER should drop dramatically this month. you know, because no Goon would break the EULA by multiboxing their rorqual account with their ganker alpha.
---
i'd suggest if they were smart they would be regular old alts rather than alphas. so they wouldnt have to stop krabbing. 
---
then the only slightly wrong thing they are doing is biomassing after the weekend to avoid the penalties of security status loss. and its not like that was ever enforced or taken seriously.
---
Lol, why does it matter how he writes? Covetors fulls up in 100 seconds, Retriever in 600 seconds.
---
This means dump on each of retrievers on average every 12 seconds which involves 1 drag, click on some key to switch window, drag - 3 click which gives 0.25 clicks/second. 
---
If this guy is 100% nothing that means every super ratter is botting too :D
---
The biggest pain in the ass must be setting it up - dock/undock, adding fleet hangar to cargo window and aligning. Locking rocks should be quite easy with broadcasts. 
---
If he had actually botted he would have been off grid by the time enemies are in system.
---
I'm sure you did.
---
The most i saw was i think it was 6 rorqs not pulling them in on the same tick. 20 would be a lot more convincing than 4-6.
---
Without bounties, there isn't any isk for the winner. The loser gets a small insurance payment, even if they didn't pay for insurance.
---
The winner can also pick up whatever drops from the destroyed ship -- and then salvage the wreck on top of that.
---
If bounties are involved on the loser, then everyone on grid gets paid a fraction of the total, not just those on the killmail.
---
Beep
---
Is this the next great war? Stargate fans vs non-fans?
---
Yep, because it is impossible to krab for a bit, then join some ganks. Everyone must krab 23/7/365 in order to reach the numbers.
---
Shitpost, I mean the video quality
---
They’ve been updated for 5 months you ingrate. Go check.
---
No, not normal. Too many people have new alts to be able to reliably tell who is really new and who isn't.
---
If someone sends you isk after killing you, it's generally because they feel guilty for some reason, as opposed to feeling sorry for you. At least that's been my experience.
---
Once in a while, if someone is particularly nice in some way before or during a fight, that might also provoke a payment. That's unusual, though. Sending "unexpected" isk can also be a tool for both recruiting and fraud.
---
"Prob a cloud of autism" it is jita after all .

Ironically the only way for goons to have fun is on alternate accounts.

grr gons, gons are mean, gons break muy ship, ban gons!!!11!!!

Yes. There was a forum thread that all Imperium members could see that detailed all this.
---
[But](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at8mmc/goonswarm_financial_overlord_gets_a_permaban_for/egzf7xl/) [it's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at8mmc/goonswarm_financial_overlord_gets_a_permaban_for/egzuk6o/) [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at8mmc/goonswarm_financial_overlord_gets_a_permaban_for/eh06sp6/) [in](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at8mmc/goonswarm_financial_overlord_gets_a_permaban_for/egzxbqb/) [writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at8mmc/goonswarm_financial_overlord_gets_a_permaban_for/eh0snj3/). Click through, all separate links. Not to mention all the people in that thread who thought the thread was gonna be about Aryth (whom everyone seems to suspect of RMT) but it was really about Nolak (whom everyone seemed to suspect of RMT). Kind of a weak defense, if you ask me.
---
Signature radius divided by Sensor Strength is called Target Size.
---
If your Target Size is less than 1.08, it's \*barely\* possible to probe you down. Doing so requires a max-skilled character, implants, and a scan-enhanced ship and probes.
---
Combat probing and the like generally has very little to with ganking. Most gankers will look for targets in places like anoms or asteroid belts or gates; scanning takes too long.
---
The practical benefit of being unscannable is similar to being cloaked. Hostiles will know you're in the system (via Local), but they will have a very hard time finding you -- assuming you're at a safe, and not sitting in or next to a celestial or something similar.
---
I'm disappointed this doesn't read "Good Bot"
---
It is almost like the people who want fights find them, and the people who want to style on those who cannot retaliate are crying on reddit or emo-biomassing.

Tranquility= Serenity confirmed. In other news: the game is still fun to play with plenty of room for actual players and even goon, erm…. bot killers

Wrong link, dude, that's just some rando's comment.
---
That said:
---
&gt; Not to mention all the people in that thread who thought the thread was gonna be about Aryth (whom everyone seems to suspect of RMT) but it was really about Nolak (whom everyone seemed to suspect of RMT). "We thought it was gonna be the other rich guy clearly RMT'ing" is kind of a weak defense, if you ask me.
---
[If that's what you think this is, you desperately need to improve your basic reading skills, dude.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at8mmc/goonswarm_financial_overlord_gets_a_permaban_for/egzh1k1/) Like, come on, the title reads "financial overlord", so most people clicking on that are gonna think "wtf, Aryth RMT'd?", which was probably the point.
---
It was bait. Congrats, you not only took the bait (I guess), but you failed at basic reading comprehension so hard that I'm not entirely convinced you even have eyeballs.
---
Those people aren't saying "well it wasn't Aryth so it's okay", those people are saying "lol the title makes it sound like Aryth".
---
In what fucking way does that translate to "WE KNEW NOLAK WAS RMTING"?
---
Well, did for a fair while, and he has a huge amount of capital to throw around such that he can continue to manipulate the market, but in the age of moon fracking no-one can control the moongoo market in regards to supply.
---
Did you click the links or are you also just pretending they aren't a bunch of people pretending they suddenly care about someone they knew was RMTing? 
---
Your reading if that thread is clearly different than my reading of it, or most non-goons' reading of it. Don't conflate subjective opinion with reading comprehension. It's a shitty cop out.
---
I mean most of the things I injected into was the commanding skills, engineering and mostly skills that would help me fly efficiently, I didn’t get any high tier ships or anything but I guess you still got a point. 
---
Also I did all the basic agent missions that introduce you to the game, that’s what really got me into exploration and pve tbh
---
[This is what your link is, mongoloid.](http://puu.sh/CQo9X/399ff8b27b.jpg)
---
You know what that person is saying? "Here's what I knew of the guy." Not "Oh, I knew he was RMTing", just "Oh, he provided loans, FC'd Theta from time to time". And we all knew he was a loanshark, because he did that in a very public manner. And that was entirely fine, even if some folks didn't like the rates he charged.
---
You do know that loaning someone ISK in-game, holding collateral, and returning that collateral on payout + interest isn't RMT, right? You do understand what RMT actually is, right?
---
The USD&lt;&gt;ISK ratio is getting better over time, are you mad?  20$ used to get you 200m isk. 
---
But this conversion only happens through plex.  ISK itself is not inflated, as you can see by any metric of any item in-game.
---
Wait, is it Burn Jita time?!  Time to resub!
---
I think you’ve got a solid point about everything you said, and I was dead wrong when I filled up my isk as you said. I probably should of stashed it away or kept it as plex for rainy days. But at least I learnt from most of these mistakes now
---
Don't forget that he doesn't like gons with hats as well, for a reason I cannot understand.
---
I mean, he should be liking them, because he assumingly wears a fedora.
---
Obviously I’m not having an easy time am I? I don’t understand why you felt the need to comment something like this when I made a post about admitting my mistakes and asking for help and advice. Also I don’t like fortnite..
---
I fell in that trap unfortunately, I honestly didn’t do it to gain any advantage or anything of that sort. My main reason was I wanted a little boost, and I wanted to have a good amount of isk stacked up so I wouldn’t have to grind or worry about grinding and burning myself out, but it backfired in a way..
---
How did the meeting with CCP go last week? We haven't gotten the CSM Minutes yet, or is that under NDA still?

1. Skill your main into a freighter. If one of your motivations is income, you can skip DSTs and Blockade Runners.
---
2. Skill an alt into a ship that supports long-range webbing.
---
3. Get to understand how Courier Contracts work, in great detail. Know how to spot likely frauds. Get to know the routes and likely spots for ganks, why you should avoid lowsec, etc.
---
4. Join and use the Haulers Channel in-game.
---
5. Once you have the skills, buy a freighter and a webber.
---
6. To minimize the chance of being ganked, try to keep your cargo under about 1.5B isk.
---
7. \*Always\* fly the freighter fit with bulkheads. Without them, you are a much more tempting target.
---
8. \*Always\* use the webber to scout the gate ahead, and when you jump through with the freighter, to web you into warp. Sitting on a gate for 60 seconds while your freighter aligns is not only painfully slow, it's also risky.
---
9. Consider joining a freighting service like Red Frog. Last time I checked, they had a long waiting list, though.
---
Good luck!

No, like, over comms to themselves.

Right click on the signature if it is not red and you will see the scanning level. If it is level IV you need a pretty good set up to scan it down. If you dont have the set up, dont bother with it.

Hey, some of us don't have imagination's powerful enough. We require screenshots to encapsulate our wonder.
---
because of the loans. negwallets from rmt loansharks suck. It is pending investigation though.
---
Azathio was kicked from gsf earlier, not 100% sure he's been banned. That said I've heard the nolak ban was connected (nolak bought azathio's stuff when azathio left, so if azathio got hit for RMT nolak mighta been wrapped up in that as well; similar things have happened to other traders, including me)/ 
---
Depends on which incursion sites you want to run. For HQs (the most difficult sites), it would be something like:
---
Basilisk x3  
---
Scimitar x6  
---
Vindicator x15  
---
Nightmare x12  
---
Machariel x4
---
I just checked it out and realized i was being paid too much to do not enough at my actual FT/S job. I need to grind that block harder. 
---
Dunno if he is. Our interaction happened a while back, and this is CCP finally investigating. 
---
I think that would be the best outcome, if no one did anything other than submit attack ads and force them to either run them or just run nothing and come up with some pathetic excuse for why there are no ad to run.
---
Also quick question, does that add on separate transactions per item you list? Or is it all transactions and you just manually check how much you made per item type?
---
So uh, how many is that?
---
The Fuzzwork site will give you the total minerals needed (click on the "M" button next to each component, to indicate you'll be making it yourself).
---
Once you have the totals, you'll need to back into the amount of ore you'll need, based on your refining skills and the rigs installed in the refinery you'll be using.
---
Short answer: Lots and lots of Trit (122M) -- which usually means starting with Spod. Mex will be next, which means Gneiss. After that, filling in the remaining gaps is usually straightforward.

&gt;i can fly some good mining ships the question is what to do.

hate to tell you this, but the mining ships are actually garbage for mining.

the best mining ship is the rorqual - which is a capital industrial ship and requires close to 0 mining skills to achieve the highest mining yield in the game.

Lowsec being dead is what sovnull smoothbrains such as myself and lowsec bittervets will tell you.
---
IIRC it comes from a Russian term, and that's why it's spelled with a "k." A krab is someone who spends all their eve playing time making money. To krab is to rat, mine, run missions, etc.
---
This isn't a question a new player would ask. 
---
Assuming you're not flair baiting. You can run the Frentix Production Facility in a VNI. Just orbit at 50km with prop mod on. Then switch to a hacking ship or have an analyzer and mobile depot in the cargo hold to go after the cans.
---
If you're a pvp corp in wspace, you're probably pretty safe. Like, some randoms will try evict you, mostly Russians, but with outlaws dying that's less common as well. Short of some grudge, most wh corps would defend you if possible, they want more corps in wspace, not less

It's funny how Drone Lands is blamed for not combating botters when we have kicked corporations for it yet no one talks about goons or test not doing anything about it. We at least are trying to make progress on that front but I am not wasting my game time searching for botters,  thats ccp's job now if it reported to us and i have time i run down and keep an eye on the situation and make the decision based on action i witness. 
---
So all you drone haters should look at your own space or even corp members because botting is an issue all over eve at least we are trying to clean house. Test just recently sent a mail about its dislike of botters after BOT but we do not mind being the first alliance to take a stance on botting. we are waiting on goons to also take the same stance but you did just have a RMT person banned and botters make them isk. come on goons follow BOT and TEST lead and kick the botters.
---
now this is the kind of post shark week was designed to nuke.
---
 i got my first one this week as well on a venture in a wh. after the kill he went out in his scanning ship to find an exit I assume to replace his loss. too bad he went into our hole that we we're currently rolling, corp mate providing security tackled him and i blapped him with a rolling mega. sent him the isk for his loses.
---
As much as I hate goons . This is pretty epic 😂 I would be dead from lack of oxygen due to excessive laughter.
---
I really don't get it dude
---
It has been spelled out to you repeatedly, slowly and in small words, how pretty much any multiboxer worth their salt and doing literally anything with drone boats is rebinding the equivalent of 'Alt Tab' as well as 'Launch', 'Recall', and 'Engage' so that they are able to efficiently execute these actions as they are required to multiple times in every site they mine regardless of whether or not you self-griefing butt chuggers show up
---
And that your arthritic grandmother could manage to alternate between two keystrokes in this manner quickly enough to recall 3 or 4 entire characters of drones in the 10+ seconds shown so far in the ~undeniable proofs of gonz chet~
---
Which part do you find objectionable?
---
The fact that it is humanly possible to type at speeds you couldn't pass a high school typing class without reaching, or the fact that people are going to the incredible lengths of making sometimes as many as 4 configuration changes for their gameplay to be 10x less annoying?
---
Please, before making further baseless accusations, provide an explanation for why anyone in their right fucking mind would not configure their clients and windowing environment in that way, and what in the holy fuck would prevent them from pressing the two keys as rapidly as they could when some nerd shows up in their site and/or local?
---
If you cannot provide an adequate explanation for both of these points, you will necessarily need to accept that you are a fuckstick and should skill yourself irl (with injectors)
---
Expectation: 100b+ losses
---
Reality: 6-7b losses each side
---
Conclusion: text post is overrated
---
More like eliminate the competition or hurt whoever exports amiright?
---
I chuckled
---
Yo not to interrupt but you do realize the dominant krab strategies for the last couple years have been "Going AFK Tanking Rats In a Paper Thin Faction Cruiser for 30 Minutes At A Stretch", and "Tackling Yourself for 5 Minutes In a 10+ Billion Isk Capital Industrial", which are so much easier to catch than tengus and ravens chaining 100km warpins and prealigning on landing that it's not even on the same fucking scale, right?
---
Like, you do remember for most of Eve's history it has been factually impossible to catch anyone ratting who was not in the process of stroking out when you entered local, right?
---
Just checking how far the entitlement goes here...

I am showing an update (maybe?) in the system updates but it fails to install every time.

Find a main ISK method and a passive ISK method. Train up some market skills and set some buy orders on flexibly priced items over 15% margin. Bounce those back and forth for profit. Update your stuff once or twice a day and leave it alone otherwise. meanwhile, run missions, rat, mine, whatever.  
---
I log in to setup Indy stuff when I don't feel like playing, set it for 24 hours, and cut out. I log back in to some profits made and no losses due to other activities. 100 mil ISK in 3 days is still 33 mil ISK a day of NOT playing over 0 isk for not playing. Casualness doesn't have to be a burden. Just don't expect to make enough to plex an account that way in the short term
---
This is sad ... 5 man bot team killing 100 hard working miners .... CCPls

no, eve is shit. it is shit because ccp continuously makes changes that promote safety and grinding over pvp and risk because all they care about is people getting more alts so they can sell more subs and extractors. yea, i got bored. i got bored of all the fucking 5 hours roams of either blue balls or a feed cause nobody gives you anything else. i got bored with spodbrains pressing their adcu at me from 70km away with no consequence. i got bored with everything having a cyno ready to drop on my slicer. so fuck eve, i unsubbed and started playing poe. if i have to grind, at least that game's free and without all the dumb pretense and drama. no, i'm not the problem. i'm not responsible for citidels, athanors, 12b isk supers, bots and nothing in the game having any value anymore. ccp's decision to fuck pvp for for profit is the problem.
---
I used to  give isk to explorers i killed for the value of their ship+fit to keep them coming back. I didn't refund anything expensive like faction mods either. It keeps them buying new ships to create content
---
Yet i think Olmeca and Marshy can't stand each other?
---
Freighter mining, how unexciting.. :P
---
Sorry i'm new to the game, what is a "goon"?
---
Nah, because you know some carebear high sec alliance is going to run their ads
---
only feedback I have is that you should definitely keep doing the weekly recaps - I don't care as much for this particular post, only focusing on one battle, but the overall recap news posts are still great
---
thanks for the work you do!
---
You have to be in fleet with whoever got the final blow too, I think?
---
Please complete some words. Being hard of hearing, it is super hard to understand you. 
---
Why? I’d say another alliance but no one else brings those fights. I prefer this to dropping caps. I love fighting in subs. Basically if you bring a remotely engageable comp to us ill at least try to form.

goonswarm federation largest alliance in the game aka bees

Imagine the horror that we create content for your poor boring days. Us? Horrible Goons?  Otherwise you would have to sit there and look at stupid scams all day. Oh boo hooo I lost a freighter. We do this every year.  It’s pretty much known it’s coming. If you get ganked...well thanks for playing :)
---
Dude, you're giving our secret away....

cool story

Someone trying to be relevant.

My beard would like a word with you..

Please point out on the doll where the goon touched you..

lol fuck off, hilmar. pistwith your main.

How are excavators for salt mining?
---
I joined test waaaaay back in 2012 when they were huge and I was new. Really started making my first shit ton of isk salvaging rating sites.
---
I did plex my first month, after that i just purchased Plex using relic/data site ISK collected from exploration.

i didn't see anyone saying this: You are not limited to anything, if you chose Amarr (or any other race). The races are mainly for lore purposes, if you don't care about the lore/roleplaying, you can chose any faction you want.

Also, if you would find that Amarr doesn't suit your style, you can always train ships/systems from other races.

You forgot the (in game) after murder /s

Not to say that you should spend money, but that’s basically $20.
---
This shit gets announced months ahead of time... how stupid do you have to be to bring a freighter to jita on the announced weekend?
---
For the GESI add-on you mean? There are probably other ways of doing it, but I chain together characters_character_wallet_transactions functions to pull the whole transaction list, then sumifs for each item I trade in for buy and sell transactions. There's a whole list of the available functions it adds [here](https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/GESI/blob/master/src/script/functions.ts), it can do a lot.

The event is hardly a secret. It's been publicised for the last couple of weeks at least and a lot of people are streaming it.  
---
This is a viable element of the Eve game and something we do every year.  
---
Rage Quit is an option; but not your best potential outcome.  Team up with an element of the game that is large enough to cope and small enough to care and use that as an umbrella to continue enjoying the game.  If you love your industry then there are plenty of places in the game where 1 billion Isk would be your daily income; not the income you gather after a year of grinding.  
---
Lift your head up; learn from the experience; and don't get ganked again in one of the games most publicised player driven events.
---
Tasty tasty salt.
---
Nope, I'm done... goons won.
---
nice
---
He did it pretty easily by the look of things. Easier than you took that poor 1b loss 😭
---
How am I going to sell Jita contracts now?
---
P2W
---
Nice post. Expected a Coercer lossmail complaining about not getting into warp after gank, but the actual one is also good.
---
That's terrible, something should be done about these people.
---
ONLY SEND IN EVE NT TOURNAMENT ADS!

If 1.3b represents a years work for you then you are doing it wrong anyway.

look....closely...

This is actually a really refreshing comment to see on here. Thank you for the positivity friend
---
Total bait post, have an upvote anyway :)
---
itt: dumb gons falling for their own meta posts
---
Jon Hallur is Eve's composer and the man is a genius 
---
Lets move blueprints in an untanked freighter during burn jita, and then cry on the forums.  EVE is not for you, you won't be missed.
---
This kind of posts is the only way I can ever get hard anymore
---
Oh man, the only thing this is missing is Jen having a mental breakdown on fleet comms or Phish's slobbering monologue about how awesome a spymaster he is. How far have the bottom of the barrel corps have fallen after Mercenary Coalition. 
---
To be fair it's a shit post to end all shit posts,
---
Let's take the first bait we see and go with it.
---
fake post
---
Lies,
---
I remember when I used to toss together a bunch of random footage. 
---
Looked through all of those links.  I don't think you know what a bot is or looks like.
---
If you can post on reddit and you didnt know this was going on, maybe eve really isn't for you. 
---
I have a feeling that we will have a major event and some content this year. Not necessarily as the next one, but sometime this year, because of this [https://www.eveonline.com/article/the-new-world-order-ish](https://www.eveonline.com/article/the-new-world-order-ish) if they are going to re arrange some gates and routes then it makes sense there will be some major event to go with it since that doesn't happen very often.
---
However, the real question is, due to the general direction of the game, events, and the quality (or rather lack thereof) of the Guardian Gala as well as the previous one, do we really want another event ?
---
I mean we do, ***if*** they are good and functional, but not if they're this shitty.
---
this guy was great https://youtu.be/X0KXNpv6WIs?t=2821
---
That's all it took to set you back a year?  That's like a few hours for most of us...
---
I love Code. 
---
The only guys willing to pay over 500% Jita for a Catalyst. 
---
Not everyone is a elite as you okay... back off.
---
Deception! 
---
It's about to get a little harder for consistent isk if you're not in null/an explorer with the removal of L4 missions, but yeah, alphas are surprisingly strong now for being free.
---
A bit like posting on reddit and not being able to read the date on a zkill?
---
Your really bad at trolling.
---
there's a fine line between bait posting and shit posting.
---
Stealth: 100

---
Best salt I’ve ever been harvested in this game yet at last years burn jita!! His name was Michael Tindall...
---
Sorry.
---
You don't say....
---
I do... great post
---
It really depends on what you do.  The most important skill is just experience, not SP.  A focused max skilled frigate, for example, doesn't take many SP at all to be exactly the same, when flying that frigate, as a dude with 100M SP.  The benefits of being a vet is mostly in capitals (which are mostly for alliance-level PVP ops) and basically being able to fly a wide variety of ships well.  
---
Newer players can quickly train to fly one particular ship class just as well as the vets, SP-wise.  The big clencher in EVE is to just practice.  A lot.  In stuff you can afford to lose.  The player skill/experience gained in a T1 frig will largely be the same experience that will be used in a pirate cruiser.
---
Keep sending that salt.  I need some more for my fries.
---
Congrats you bought a unsellable item that couldve been hauled in a shuttle.....bro if youre a miner/explorationist just repeat what youve done
---
To add to this, it is fully possible to kill a pirate/faction frigate in a T1 frigate if you outplay him or counter his fit.  Said ships are better statwise so its not that common, but each time you lose in a T1 frig it costs a few mil.  The times you kill that pirate frig, it's costing him over a hundred mil.
---
There is also an event going on known as Burn Jita. Basically a bunch of corps ganking freighters and such in Jita and the surrounding area.
---
You better not, im warning you.
---
Can you not be so offensive please
---
Friends do make a huge difference in this game.  I am fairly antisocial myself, but if not for the 2-3 close friends I've made in game I likely would have quit long ago.
---
If goons are doing burn jita, shouldn’t Concird do burn (insert goons trade hub here)?? 
---
😂😂
---
Burn Jita 7 for Michael Tindall
---
That sicks, I am a returning player, can I have your stuff?
---
Or what?  You're gonna add another freighter to my killboard?
---
I prefer Delve sorry
---
Enterprise Barghest skin when
---

---
TBH, you should make a bank alt and send any of the leftover isk to it and learn to build from nothing, as you'll value the isk.  Once you've learned the game and feel comfortable with progression and understand the value of isk, you'll have a nice nest egg waiting that you can use intelligently.
---
As a personal story, I've seen the effects of devaluing isk for new players.  I have a cousin that I've always gamed with since we were like 10 (back in the old PS1 days), but he never gave EVE a chance because it was too complicated for him.  In order to try to get him into the game, I mentored him (which helped) but made the mistake of giving him isk and free ships to start with.  This led to him having no regard for the value of isk, the work required to replace a loss, and basically put him in the "lol 50m isk an hour is way too low" mentality without having a clue how to actually play the game.  He ended up quitting pretty fast.
---
No, it isn't. Because permanent null stations aren't a thing anymore. 
---
&gt; im pretty sure all the major alliances (PL, NC, Goons and TNT) could band together for this virtuous act. 
---
"Major alliance" 
---
"TNT" 
---
...
---
Hah yeah that's me: explorer in an Imicus getting popped while scanning down data/relic sites. It \*sucks\* getting killed after all that time spent scanning, but the ISK giveback does keep me coming back. Circle of life I guess.
---
tl;dr - the best/safest place for mining is to join goons.
---
Ah freighter and 250m in minerals are everything you got ?
---
Ya just meet me at the perimeter gate with something big enough to carry the haul
---
There's not a lot an Alpha can do in WH space, except maybe do PI and be bait...
---
Just play the game. Try everything at least once. Personally I'd suggest a player run corp is the best place to do that. 
---
Though there is something to be said for spending some initial time in highsec. Do the Seekers Investigation and then the full set of career agent missions. Follow that up by doing the SOE epic arc. Only then consider if you want to go join a newbie focused corp in nullsec or perhaps eve university.
---
You can do a hell of a lot as an Alpha account. if you get to the 5m skill point limit before you are ready to Omega start an alt on the same account and focus his training towards a specific profession. The first account is probably not trained in an optimised way as you want to try lots of different things. It always possible to start a second Alpha account if you want a more optimised alt before your main is 5m SP.
---
you complain about an obelisk with 300m worth of cargo getting ganked? nice troll mate
---
first time in last 4 months i agree with an init member.
---
or people for once dont go into 10-30k member alliances in sov null and go to other smaller newbie friendly corps and alliances in wormholes, lowsec or null. horde,brave,karmafleet and eve university aren't the only ones that are able to teach newbies how to play the game.
---
Any goons Corp accepting miners?
---
So if you do get unbanned what will your plans in Eve be assuming the GSF blacklist remains? Go back to HS incursion running? Find a new null sec home? Actually RMT to get what you can out of the game and then quit?
---
I don't think theres anything specificly listed in the terms of service about creating dozens of alpha alts and then spamming jita chat, i mean that happens every day in jita :)
---
If they are doing it to push Jita into Tidi and therefore improve their gank potential... thats a different story.
---
Frigate Abyssal!
---
you need like 1-2 Day training to run t3 sites without risk. give it a week extra and you can run t4 abyssal sites!
---
only thing you need are 2 more people or 2 alts.
---
FC, can I call a new primary?
---
Jesus that's so old.
---
Please point your nose to the multiple times bots have been caught in your space. I'd start with kids with guns, the Nyx admissions and the 90 man mining fleets running there now warping at the same time when a hostile enters local. Feel free to blue dunk em, or reset kids with guns.
---
well you forgot something:
---
injectors are time limited. Advanced accelerators give more SP within the same timeframe. This makes them more valuable than "slower" ones. (This is also the same reasoning why ppl buy injectors instead of just plexing it, though the effect is of course lower as it's only faster, not instant)
---
Ehhhhhhh.... still havn't agreed with one :P
---
Not all missions.
---
I see burn Jita is blazing success. Keep it up boys. 
---
No PI for alphas.
---
Heh, been doing a similar thing with a few buddies. I'm enjoying it as it's relatively cheap, pick up and play PvP. 
---
tl;dr: miss you penif 
---
Nice troll 👌
---
At 1:50 that character looks like my main.
---
Not trying to be mean, but if thats a year you are doing something wrong. 
---
Even doing courier contracts thats not that long. 
---
4/20 points, dank meme
---
Should have bought those freighter permits.
---
lol i tried to undock from jita with a suspect timer and without using an insta-undock. i was spamming the dock button but it wasn't doing anything, i finally got docking request accepted but i still took damage for a couple of ticks, i was at like 5% structure when i actually docked. fun
---
they have no e-bushido
---
Is a fact though 
---
That Obelisk was everything you had from the past year?

always take the bait. always.

That's just what they are expecting us to do. We need a second bait.
---
Gr8 b8 m8

Forgot they can't do PI

If your to stupid to haul to jita in a shit fit freighter with out a scout or checking comms you deserve the fate you got.   Burn jita was announced every channel in and out of game was talking about it.  Stupid shit happens to stupid people.

Can the five people, or six if Fred is well again, say something about it?

Yeah he did. Last year.

When I grow up want to be like penif
---
Come to Delve and participate in a real resource war. We have people steal excavators or blow them up. We have people harassing\blowing up carriers and supers. Usually, get a decent drop from killing carriers.  You could camp the gate in our staging and catch more dumbs gating carrier and haulers of all types. Let's not forget, people, gating their blingy 10\10 ratting ships.
---
Delve is what you are asking CCP to give you. But it is already here for you. Are you brave enough to accept the challenge?
---
When I grow up I want to be like penif
---
fully pvp game lmao. nah ur doing exactly what ccp wants you to, except you need to inject mining skills not pvp. just buy more injectors, get a rorqual and join goos, that's the only way to play eve in 2019
---
If you made rewards that good there would be no point in high sec mining
---
And?
---
People who make inappropriate ww2 references also think giving their enemies women nicknames to color them weak. Such a surprise.
---
&gt; Well his collection was worth well over a trillion
---
just the raven state is multiple trillion
---
CCP: Looks at screen shot, ''I see nothing wrong here, they've not tried to sell me any RMT ISK, enjoy your problem''.

I kind of want to join test just to fly with pro &lt;3
---
lmao this is post of the month right here
---
Tfw all the edgy trolls come here to mock you but you've pulled a 200 iq move
---
I did when it launched loved the idea it looks cool it plays well but the rewards just make it not worth while at all..
---
Given have far they are from each other I'm totally behind making them reward decent isk.
---
Move to the safe zone.
---
Beep boop
---
Can i have your shit ? 
---
Cosmos missions?
---
Thats a war I can get behind!
---
Pandemic Horde is a fantastic place for hunters, tons of targets all crammed into a small area with limited brain cells to share between them.
---
It's definitely a high traffic area. If you want to crab, the other blocs in Eve are (probably) a bit more quiet, just need to find the right place. The system I rat in hasn't had a neut while I was ratting in weeks.
---
Don't resub, just multibox 5 alpha accounts, no need to sub in this game.
---
Nothing to see here.  Please move on.  Also Sansha relics have been nerfed.
---
My corp joined Frat a while back and are now leaving. Feels bad, people call me a bot.
---
Mind telling us what system? Asking for a friend
---
wew imagine trying to convince other people to drink the kool-aid as much as you are 
---
dunno where your problem is, this kill is a year old ....or did they catch you again ?
---
Same old game it’s always been. 
---
I know because I resubbed one month, logged in for ten minutes and realized how BORING it is and went back to some real games 
---
Join faction warfare and make isk while you PvP
---
Let's see. There's two possibilities here:
---
1) Most rorqual multiboxers in goons are high-apm micro warlords who have just happened to perfectly configured their clients such that they can pull any number of excavators simultaneously on the same tick
---
2) They're cheating
---
Which one is more likely? Use your noodle, dude. No one believes you outside of your echo chamber. Everyone knows this game is rife with RMT, botting, and input broadcasting. We know it because we see it. You can handwave all you want, but no one is buying it. I don't have to provide an "adequate explanation" for any of your points, because this isn't a fucking court of law and I don't owe you a goddamn thing. I don't give two flying fucks about what you think. At this point, I just assume that you guys will jump up to scream and cry until people admit that you're all just marine microing your excavators to dodge bombs, just like you imagine it, sweetie.
---
CCP's dream.     it crashed and burned.  so CCP is trying to revive it in events
---
Holy fuck that jin'taan theon greyjoy comment killed me. I can't unsee it!
---
Pm me, I’m one of Horde’s caretakers, and I’ll be online this morning.  I’ll get you set up. 
---
I agree. Notice the date. 
---
How is your corp 'German-speaking only'? You have a better grasp of English than half of English-speaking Eve.
---
not even SC deserves this tbh 
---
I watch something like this, and I can't help but think it's a genuine shame that many, perhaps even most of them, are likely to lose their jobs in the next 3 to 5 years due to the continued poor management of the company.
---
I sincerely hope I'm wrong. 
---
The funniest Eve Pulse yet!
---
I realized yesterday my wallet was up 4.337 bil from a week before.
---
There is some truth in what he said about joining the right group to get ahead.
---
Well, now I AM curious!
---
For the bounty stuff: if someone is killed, 20% of the destroyed value is paid out to the killers. So if you got 1 mill, his fit was probably around 5 mill. 
---
the bait is real 
---
Its better to say sauerkraut instead of pickled cabbage! Thats why.

---
Videos like this make me want to goto a WH Corp! Great vid!
---
And his name is Michael Tindall! 
---
Well this explains the tidi I saw last night while hauling shit into Jita like a retard.
---
No, they compete with injectors. Yes, for an advanced much more than twice the price for a basic may be justified, especially if these prices are quite low.
---
But if the extra SPs are more expensive than injecting these extra SPs, then it's not justified. Look at the table above: You can buy an advanced for 444M, which gives you 51840 SPs (Bio V). You could also use these 444M to buy a standard one for 185M and a small injector for 181M. Combined these give you more (at least 43200 + 20000 = 63200) SPs on the same 2 days and you have 78M ISK left.
---
Correct calculation, Bio V:
---
* LSI: 5.92 ISK/SP (150k) / 2.96 (300k)
---
* SSI: 6.03 ISK/SP SSI (30k) / 3.01 (60k)
---
* Basic: 3,34 ISK/SP
---
* Standard instead of Basic: 5.55 ISK/SP
---
* Advanced instead of Standard: 29.98 ISK/SP
---
--&gt; If you are still &lt;80M SPs you get 300k or more for a large injector, so don't use any accelerators. Even the basic one is more expensive than injecting. If you are above 80M, Standard is slightly better than injecting. But if you didn't consider injecting before, don't take more than the basic.
---
Yes gas huffing can be done by alpha's I do it all the time.
---
Can you bring back the smelly goons copypasta you did last year please
---
Nice nice, Wurmloch is Beste wo gibt!

It's only a 1.3b, stop being a poor
---
I also here he created a new account after it and now goes by Olmeca Gold
---
Carrier with triage were converted to fax at the change. Like a said, i know there's at least one, was just wondering if anybody else has seen any floating around
---
Ignoring the bait this year's burnjita was pretty lackluster tbh
---
DUDE
---
As much as it’s annoying .., what makes eve great is burn jita is allowed // encouraged to happen
---
Player created content like burn or hulkageddon or what have u is what makes eve great 
---
Vs other mmos where other people’s tears are against the eula 
---
Eve is hard, eve is harder when the salt from your tears ruins your keyboard 
---
Two things.
---
1) I could listen to CCP Ruffige's accent for hours
---
2) At 5:13 - when they scroll over "The Plan"- the blur slips for a frame or two and I really want to know what's written there.
---
Really fun episode... was that to cover the fact that they have actually nothing good to show us?
---
I'm real detached from reddit so when some Bro convoed my freighter in a .5 asking if I was going to jita I got a lil spooked with my cargo full of corp loot. Then he told me "goons are doing a thing" and it clicked. Thank you random bro
---
If the gsf blacklist remains I don't know what I will do. I built up so much in there, made friends, had a great time. 
---
Pretty sure it says "Lol @ those nerds tryna spy on us" or something
---
From what I can tell, there are three different kind of players. 
---
PvE Players: PvE is their end game and they get their kicks from industry, mining, or just mission running against NPCs. They have no intention of PvP and usually have no experience other than being ganked. They are the backbone of the game, all the ship and equipment have to come from somewhere.
---
PvE for PvP Players: These guys do the latter so they can take part in PvP. PvP is pretty expensive with no guaranteed return, this is how they fund their goals. Either they suck at PvP and are learning, or just like flying the more expensive ships, or simply want to support their corp, heck they might like PvP but it isn't their sole game. I would say a fair amount of players fall into this category. 
---
PvP Players: These guys only really do PvP, and make all that isk from PvP. These guys are either good, or make all that money from ganking the people in the first category. Nothing wrong with it, some do it because they enjoy the challenge, others do it because they like spreading misery. Maybe they have a hatred of bots and will target anybody who appears to be one. An easy target is an easy target after all. These guys remind you of how you should be playing the game. 
---
Figure out where you want to be and what category you want to be in, then work to play within the means of your style, but it sounds like you fall into the second category. Figure out how much isk you can make with your time investment, fly cheaper ships if you have too. And figure out how much time you'd be willing to loose to PvP and create a PvP ship with that in mind. Over time you will get better and as such you will get a better return on investments. 
---
The C5s on singularity get rolled all day long. It wouldn’t be difficult. 
---
Yea highsec mining should be the worst because you can just warp out to any random belt and do it solo.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **3rd Cakeday** sammy_jaay! ^(hug)
---
It's for the weekend. Basically, if you're in a freighter don't undock this weekend. We don't care about other ships usually 
---
good way to scam tbh.
---
And that is bad because 
---
Thanks :)
---
I legitimatly forgot Resource Wars were even a thing.
---
What I do remember was hearing of them way back, thinking "Oh cool" and upon learning of how poorly it paid out, and the fact that there were one-use skins, I went straight back to literaly doing anything else.
---
Shame, neat concept, well, sort of. But horrid execution for the carrot at the end of the stick.
---
this should be a learning experience for you.
---
our guardians where about to break :( sorry for vanishing :p 
---
and GF
---
What is happening until Monday? #clueless
---
mate, we told them how to make resource wars not suck while it was still on sisi.
---
if they didn't listen to us when it was out for testing and they were actively asking for feedback - what chance do you have now after they've already said they've abandoned it?
---
Seems you tried droping in that fight but it didnt go so well for you.
---
Because we like to stay efficient :D
---
Noticed that as well, unfortunately even frame by frame it is still extremely blurry.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/KcEx57z.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KcEx57z.jpg) is the clearest frame and it's not great.

I must admit - the eve pulse videos have been getting better lately.
---
they used to just be a bunch of shit you'd already read on reddit, now it's actually full of new content. nice.
---
To many people forget that this is just a game and take this stuff waaaaaaay to personal.           
---
I constantly troll NC and PL but shit what people write about others is just insane.         
---
For those who care i have ex corp/ alliance members both NC and PL ... and we drink beer on the eve meets and laugh.           
---
Claim down people ... especially all those salty wormholers - Brisc is one of the best CSM we had, this guy is amazing in terms how he see this community.        
---
Clearly you haven't checked, because ship prices are dropping as are mineral prices.
---
Look at the killmail you retards, its a bait post.
---
Hahahaha what the fuck is this.
---
Stop please 
---
Thanks :D
---
Why did they think creating an isk sink in content aimed at newer players was a good idea? Isk sinks should be draining vets of their treasure hoards if anything.
---

---
uuuu thx! this will be of great help!
---
You can always get instaganked and killed, if you're soft enough.
---
I knew this was fake because Burn Jita is such a iconic activity in the game. Why would you ever undock during it? 
---
My only question is what wilk CCP develop next to make Burn Jita impossible in their desire to eventually theme park the shit out of that game for sick revenue streams. 
---
I wish this was real so i could enjoy properly
---
you're most definitely wrong.

how do you know if someone is a wormholer?
---
don’t worry, they’ll tell you
---
People aren't bitching about Brave specifically. They're bitching about the current state of Solo and small gang roaming in Eve. It used to be the case that you would avoid a few select groups because of their propensity for dropping on people. PL, SC, SS, Maybe NC(probably forgetting a few). The current state of affairs is that more or less **all** groups will drop on you if given the opportunity. Fatigue nerfed those cancerous entities playstyles, and injectors allowed everyone to instead emulate it in their own space. Bringing up Brave is an more an example of how even "newbro" alliances have the arsenal available to completely shut down subcap roaming content if they wish. You personally might be all about good fights. I don't know you but if it's true then more power to you. I do however doubt that your attitude mirrors the entirety of Brave's membership. A lot of people are really eager to use their big ships on every occasion that presents itself
---
 I only heard wardecs and Agency 3.0 is that all for next expansion?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/N2IOR7R.png](https://i.imgur.com/N2IOR7R.png) pretty sure about this part
---
I just started playing again recently. came back fairly broke and decided to sell off my old char. I had a bid and messaged the guy, we got to talking and he told me about extractors/injectors and where the best place to buy and sell is. even gave me the initial 420m. so amarr citizen xxxxxx if you're out there, thank you. 
---
Im working on revamping my old corp if you're interested in budget PVP. Its gonna be focused on high sec internal pvp using t1 meta 0 fit frigates. Friendly fire enabled. No structures/war decs. So like FW without needing to roam for fights and without the power variables. 
---
It's in its early stages but should be a great way to learn pvp once were up and running. As we get better we'll expand to more play styles depending on what we're feeling.

---
That's not bad. There needs to be activities for solo players. It's just the group activities should always be more profitable because multiplayer should be encouraged in an Mmo.
---
I guess this confirms they have CCP Rise locked in a broom closet somewhere.
---
Tried downloading the 4K footage and cleaning it up but there's just too much YT compression and motion blur.
---
I'll leave it to more experienced people to unpick.
---
Anyone at CCP wanna send me the source footage? :D
---
Resource wars can be done solo and i doubt anyone from low/null is going to start doing them also if people stop doing indy in high then everything has to come from null and i doubt theyl sell outside tradehubs 
---
Ever considered getting into exploration? Can make that back in a weekend with t1 explo gear. Much longer if you don't have time on your hands to play actively all day weekends, but still probably the fastest way to make isk from nothing. Give me a budget, and I'll pm you a fitting; making a fit for under 5mil is doable, but you get best results at 50mil+.
---
ahh ye for sure. I haven't done my own calculations and just assumed that isk/SP of the Injectors is higher anyways. Since, like you say, it makes ZERO sense that any accelerator costs more in terms of isk/LP than the injectors...
---
this is so hot
---
 Set me back atleast a year 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/CyveZAQ](https://imgur.com/a/CyveZAQ)
---
atleast a year
---
a year
---
They could still have it be an isk sink: just make the rewards worthwhile. Faction mining laser enhancements, faction mining ships. Have those be the reward instead of useless battleships that cost more to get than jita price.
---
Pathfinder and tripwire
---
Nobody cares. 
---
This is an interesting point that I had not considered.
---
Hooray!
---
ah, cool! thanks
---
funny because this was where i almost got killed XD
---
A lot happening in this comment break it down for us please 
---
fw missions?
---
No kidding. Far from being casual, it sounds like OP tried to concentrate six months worth of progression into a couple of weekends and then was dismayed to have failed. Take it easy and enjoy the ride.
---
Nah don’t get involved with them, get in the complexes and fight! If you can hold your ground in a novice complex for 10 mins you’ve paid off the frigate. Depending on the tier level and lp markets you can be earning 10-20mil per novice complex. 
---
Not really decryptors, just parts that are used in storyline modules, some of them are pretty expensive, such as 'Sleeper Profound Research Notes' are worth 115 mil, because they are rare. OP was just lucky.
---
camp some renters, kill them and ask for a ransom so that you leave them alone, then dont leave them alone

I've spent more time than I'd like to admit scouting systems and shooting offline mods. Best jackpot was 5b, best ship in space was a cruiser. I'm green with jelly.

You gonna be back soon, life and every other game gets boring really quick. :)
---
Burn Jita is definitely one of the cooler things about EVE.
---
Thank you, wondered if that was the answer. 
---
Barges are already the better meta for people without a large super umbrella, and with drone bombing getting more meta and being refined, it is getting better to just use a bunch of retrievers spread out with a single recon drone bunny.

Well played.

Dang. That doesn't seem like a years worth of ISK to me. I can make that on one gank. 
---
It's their own fault. I have seen numerous warnings about burn jita coming. If they were not so stuipd all they had to do was stay docked. 
---
So if they wanted to cry about. They should cry to themselves

Noone else going to notice the km is a year old?

Resource wars. I thought the whole game was supposed to be fighting for resources like space and the resources it contains. I'd like to see how many people even did more than glace at resource wars since it came out. Not many I'm guessing.
---
I don’t know how handy you are, or your set up, but I got myself an old style solid wood library chair (mandatory good posture with that thing), and I’d recommend hitting a Home Depot or Lowe’s and make yourself a small platform to put on your desk so your monitor is the proper height so as not to fuck with your neck. Doesn’t have to be fancy, just something that won’t fall off your desk, and raises your monitor and keyboard/mouse area if necessary. You can swap out two different ones, one for sitting and one for standing
---
I haven't played Eve in 2 years can someone eli5
---
You need friends. Join up with a corp/alliance that is active in your timezone and integrate in their comms and chat systems (no serious groups use the in-game mail or in-game chat). Good alliances have ship reimbursement for important fleets (and partial reimbursement for fun fleets). 
---
As a returning player I thought it was cool. Venture up with a couple friends clear a mission in 3 minutes for... 150k isk. If we could do it without jumping we would make a whopping 3m an hour. Some of the skins are neat and I might do it for that but it seems minimally worth it 
---
Mining in a belt requires minimal knowledge, effort, and investment. It is very low risk. It isn't "bad," but it sure as fuck should be a power reward than basically everything else in the game. People who enjoy the chill of mining laser sounds while watching Netflix or chatting with buddies on comms but without the effort or culture or investment or whatever else needed to do other activities would still highsec mine... but not get wealthy doing it... and that's fine.
---
Unfortunately doing pr0n is not a passive activity.
---

---
I dont get it
---
Manufacturing. Especially t1 ammo is an easy profitable thing for a newbie to make, to convert it into faction ammo with LP. 
---
Using buy orders in jita is also a nice way to get a hold of the next ship/fit/ammo/salvage to make rigs etc. Saves a ton of isk in the long run if you can buy most of your fit with patience. 
---
Who’s butthurt over it? I think it’s a pretty staple thing for eve nowadays is the yearly culling of jita. The rest of us just take a weekend off of EVE (not me I’m just relegated to camping a single system in my inactive afkness)

People still go to jita?

You will get them banned if caught repeatedly but hey up they are free and take less than a day to put in a suicide ganker. Multi boxing alpha's is treated like RMT unlike botting which is a slap on the wrist.
---
new gas sites, bring gas huffers
---
its not that bad. There are some nice faction jackets that are available in the LP store, which is the only reason ive done them.
---
I think the idea of resource wars is great. Mining under threat and having to defend the site is pretty cool. I just wish it was more entangled with the progression of faction lore or faction warfare. 
---
why move around minerals ?
---
Tbf they started with a Nid as bait. We knew it was bait but took it, hoping they’d drop something fightable. Once they bridged in Munins we decided to fuck off. 
---

---
You have a very high opinion of your shit posting ability. 
---
If only there had been announcements all over the place to let you know it was coming...
---
Fair. Although I’d say you just kinda have to depend on members to enforce rules. Basically catch rules are don’t drop caps or if you do no one is gonna pull your ass outta the fire. Impass is 100% krab space so they do things differently. All I can say is what I tell everyone. Bring goodfights to catch and we’ll bring a good fight. Go after krabs in Impass and vOv. 
---
It's not like is wasn't announced publicly 2 weeks ago.  Read the news more often.
---
Mining is PVE...
---
meh...it was worth a try. ...got some good sites and giggles too....got to love reddit.
---
Sounds like last year's burn Jita was pretty fun.
---
It's refreshing to be called something other than the Penguin, Gabe Newells son, Meatloafs son, and jonah Hills son :) 
---
You can get it from the 4k version of the video where it's marginally clearer and adjusted the brightness and contrast a little to get a clearer look. Just looks like a task checklist with names written beside each task and the top one or two are completed.
---
Can only really make out a few words but it looks like perfectly normal operational plans probably for the growth team, so it's probably a genuine mistake rather than a big troll and the content of it is probably not that interesting.
---
They literally don't need to show us shit, so the fact there is even a glimpse I'm glad for it.
---
yeah. neither did anyone else.
---
thats how bad it failed.   
---
have you tried the multiplayer mod in rimworld? Also are you on the rimworld subreddit? What mods do you use? 
---
Gosh better drop 35 titans then..
---
HEK MARKET BEST MARKET!
---
It's fun like the first two or three times. That rush of hah we rekt their fleet, what baddies.
---
After that you realize it's dumb, meaningless and makes people want to fight you less. 
---
They fucking announce this shit
---
I love it when diamond rats pop my cynos.
---

---
yawn
---
I wish I could make a video for IPH
---
Haha I think he's being serious as well. Don't eat in entry systems to nullsec, BWF is literally one of the most active PVP areas in the game, only idiots would rather there.
---
Flip that coin and give me your expert opinion on how to fight 200+ (20 or so are bhaals btw) in a similar doctrine but only 35% of their numbers.
---
correct above, pull your head out of the fucking sand... your fault for going to jita.
---
Aka input broadcasting bots!
---
I can't get my CEO to play anything except apex legends lately :(
---
Might give it a whirl later though. Atm I'm running a muffalo knights build w/giddy-up + medieval times. (It was supposed to be [warg cavalry](https://y.yarn.co/ca4b8291-96cf-4bc9-8a59-675b7d17572f_screenshot.jpg) but wargs are pretty hard to tame)
---
If you want a QoL mod list lemme know, the game's made a lot easier by things like the food control options &amp; high-detail work tab. 
---
&gt; They used LP rewards as it’s an isk sink. Bounties are isk faucet which eve has far too much of.
---
that's kinda the whole point of LP,  the issue here is the rewards from resource wars are t1 ships with t1 fits that cost more in isk from the LP store than it would cost to buy all in jita, cashing in your LP effectively loses you money. 
---
with every other LP store most items you can buy sink some isk buying the item but receive more isk selling the item creating an isk/lp value that is positive and usually in the 1000-3000 isk/lp range. 
---
Like as in one account or multiboxing?
---
seems like a somewhat neat feature but the rewards are well negative so yea, pretty much no one wants to do them or talk about them. Content was DoA. 
---
Largest problem with me when i tried them was that ALL participant had to have standing for the corp, so you couldnt do higher tier with new people in.
---
https://github.com/devfleet/awesome-eve/blob/master/README.md
---
Haha well shit rewards is what CCP is all about these days! The last few events have been:
---
Grind + isk =&gt; carbon + salt
---
Compare it to previous episodes.
---
&gt;45 faction &amp; t1 battleships on grid with another 35 faction battleships
---
Where has 200+ come from suddenly?
---
Logis, Random bullshit assfrigs, ewarfrigs and command dessies
---
Anyone who reads or  posts here knew it was coming and anyone who doesn't read or post here won't see this.
---
The if you don't like it do a "burn delve" is quite a logic fail too. If someone doesn't like their freighter being ganked how does it follow that they'll like ganking freighters somewhere else? 
---
They're freighter pilots not gankers, the like flying freighters.
---
Why censor it then?
---
says the offspring of Rowan &amp; Ron Atkinson
---
:P
---
They rarely announce anything big on Pulse.
---
dude! thx for this! amazing....
---
Or not understanding the cycle time on ice excavators
---
I think this is a better format for Pulse than just going over stuff we already know. No one expects any major announcements from Pulse (no one allowed near sharp objects anyway) so I'd rather they just had fun with it.
---
I have a burning in my anus. I need a goon to come sooth it. 😎
---
yea I completely gave up on events a while back seems like the accelerators are the only thing worth much and the events seem to happen so often they are pretty cheap to just buy off the market. 
---
but even just in general it seems the last few PVE features they did got done because that's what they thought the players wanted, but then messed up the reward structure so bad pretty much no one does them. Then rather than tweak the rewards they abandon the feature.  
---
gimme your shit 
---
Hulkageddon was better, fight me IRL. 
---
Ok assuming numbers are accurate :bigThink: and assuming you wanna stay in battleships then there's a few things you could do. 
---
Most glaringly obvious would be MJD cmd dessie cancer if you just want to ref the fort. Could use arties on your machs or reship to ravens/rokhs. 
---
Or use cmd dessies offensively and continuously split their fleet up. Takes effort, sacrificing dessies and decent multiboxing but I'm sure you guys are capable.
---
There's many a way to fight outnumbered but it's not worth effort posting this far down a thread.
---
Btw the presenter looks like the cop from the Red Dwarf episode  Back To Reality - [here](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlhNTE0YWUtNzA2ZC00OGViLTk1ZTgtYmMyZTRkNmM3ZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTgyMzEyNDY@._V1_.jpg)

Am0k. is recruiting. You can make up your losses in one day down here.
---
You’re mad that you have to play a better game?
---
If you want to rat safely, then pandemic horde space is one of the worst places in the galaxy that you can be. The players of Eve are well aware that PH is the noob alliance and that they will have easy pickings for any kind of PvP. I’d wager that any other alliance space is safer and sees less traffic.
---
I see this really as a motivational post for Burn Jita.   
---
"We don't want to ruin the game, we want to ruin your game"
---
Where does the amount of the placed bounty factor in?
---
It's still privileged information about their plans, schedules, and procedures, not something they necessarily want revealed to the public or competitors. CCP has some balls to even release a video walking around the office on a normal work day.
---
the last bloodraider event was nice on the first day
---
You can't give CCP credit for fucking up the loot tables... Although TBF even after they fixed it, there was semi decent rewards... The last few have been utter shite 
---
oh man it is fucking good
---
No coms - Check
---
No back story - Check

Sounds like everything is in order here, please continue. 
---
This is an outrage. I havent logged in in a month but I would like to imagine if I did Jita would be a safe place to meet all my commerce needs. If I remember correct I got a iteron full of ore, what if I want to daydream about logging in one day for a relaxing 20 jump voyage to the taiwan of outerspace?
---
How can ppl daydream about possibly logging in one day if they got tired of playing minecraft, when even in my imagination im getting ganked omw to jita. Literally unplayable.
---
I am literally rage quitting eve-online in my imagination and refuse to daydream about playing again until order is restored to hisec.

I'm surprised noone linked this so far.
---
**peaks in to see if they fixed something thats been broken since 2009** 
---
nope.. trolled again. Good on ya. 
---
It only pays up until the bounty is fully drained IIRC
---
There was a time bounties would give you a flat amount per kill, but people just claimed the bounty with their alts instead
---
You seem to confuse "he was a good dude" with "he did nothing wrong"

Turns out, if you arent a frothing retard, people arent celebrating your ban

so unfortunate the pilots doing their job were only awarded one point for such a large KM.

is there no justice space?

No coms or context, 5/10.

mining isn't hard

you can just alt tab through the miners and do it easy but probably better with a program to have them more organized

---
Amazing, props! 
---
Could this be integrated in zkillboard? 
---
Yep, player names and portraits on their detail view take you to their zkill, as do corp and alliance links. 
---
Thank you sir. 
---
At Least link a freighter with stuff in it.
---

---
Those were the days..
---
This is wonderful!
---
In theory, absolutely. It would be up to them to do so.  I encourage them to either integrate directly or just take the idea and implement it themselves. The latter is probably a better idea. 
---
Well thank you!

I was just curious what was the reason for your response that didn’t add absolutely anything useful to this thread. 
---
In that case he might not be able to afford or pay for alpha at the moment or possibly he enjoys the challenge?
---
You got bamboozled 
---
You've lost the thread, friend. At this point I don't think you know what point you're trying to make other than wahh gons
---
Yeah this is cool, well done!
---
Thank you sir!
---
It's pretty hard to burn npc space. Instead, "siege delve" would work well. Constant attacks forcing goons to burn jump fuel and gain fatigue would be more effective. 
---
I have always wanted to make a similar thing based on Alliance Tournament results of teams. If i got you the data would you be up for it? :d
---
Yeah, that would be cool. Elo is really best for 1v1 but I think Microsoft has an algorithm, TrueSkill or something like that, that is made for teams. That ought to work well for AT. 
---
I think you just got lucky twice in a row. Although the 'data sites are trash' meme has progressed to an extent that means the decryptors are actually worth quite a bit now, so they're a fairly reliable 10-20m per site which isn't too bad.
---
I think Odyssey and Rubicon were the last good expansions. 2013 was fun year in EVE. 
---
Damn goons keeping game alive ...... so many ore to mine, ships and modules to be build again ........... **honestly better than AT**          
---
Yes 'all the pun' came in package with this post.          
---
&lt;3

Your response to my post is upsetting me.

Sometimes ideas take a while to put into plan. Sometimes years, others minutes.

---
 - make the packs use only 5 m³ but remove anything but the ship
---
 - divide isk cost by two, multiply LP cost by two ( maybe more, maybe less ?)
---
 - make separate offers for skins : 10M isk+ X lp each, with X being 2k for frigates, 5k for cruisers, 20k for BS.
---
And now the packs are good for moving stuff fast, or even good to be sold locally, and skins are not a sideproduct.
---
Oh my god this fucking cracked me up hahahaha &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 
---
venture are good for L1, cloaky T2 venture is good for L2, but you don't want to do them because you get same standing / mission with L1, half volume to mine.
---
However guristas and angel are very annoying as angel paint you and you can be one shot by the arty cynabal, while guristas use jam which prevents you from mining.
---
As far as I'm aware, the degree of staging is minimal. 
---
I think it's good to let people see that there are, in fact, people working on Eve. And a good number of people at that. (Players don't generally get to see new people starting with the company. Considering how some people in /r/eve can be, can you blame them?)
---
looking at my killboard, i've been on just under 1/4 of the kills, it seems.

note to self...sell Charons
---
They are not "rare", they drop from a cosmos site in the ani constellation but you need to hack like 50 cans to get the key to the next gate, and then 100 cans to get the loot. All the while being shot by rats which prevent you from opening the cans (can't open the can because entity is too close). The cans are spread in a 50km-wide area.
---
I farmed it and it gave me two after 2H. Using two toons, and blinged ships (the DPS is not to be laughed at). Meanwhile I can do 150M/h raw isks with the same toons, farming in HS, with ease.

you can mine ice in HS ice anoms. Will need an orca to boost and store the ice, then as many procs/skiffs as you can.

&gt;HEK MARKET BEST MARKET!
---
Eff that, I jumped all the way from Hek to Amarr because some twit was gouging almost 3 million isk per Mining Laser II.

Hek market is a freaky backwater where random and inexplicable shit costs 500% of anywhere else.

Oh shit Burn Jita is happening? Work or EVE....
---
Basically.
---
Blobbing someone by 1000 to 50 is the definition of elite, you're right.
---
I can't wait to see what Quant will show us about the event... I'm hoping for lowest player engagement ever...
---
WTB comprehensive list of Concord losses as well :) just to see how many brave soldiers had to suicide to kill these people
---
Thanks. I'm mostly mining in an orca and an exhumer, but I think that to be safe, I'll hold off until after downtime on Monday. 
---
The best part about Burn Jita is what it goes to the economy. 
---
How come they are not taken down by CONCORD? Are they too powerful?
---
Earth? Is that you?
---
oh no, heaven forbid we get more rng loot tables as if no game has ever had that before.
---
literally being outraged for the sake of being outraged while having nothing to be outraged over. 
---
They get annihilated by CONCORD, but they alpha the freighter off the field before they can all get destroyed. Cheap ships high alpha damage
---
Just pay some high sec pub to move it away from Jita for you.  
---
... Make sure you put a good collateral on it and know what you shipped.

Wait, that is this weekend?  You miss a couple days of Eve and you miss stuff like this.
---
If you put too much factorys it will start to get polluted. 
---
This ought to work nicely [https://github.com/mafredri/go-trueskill](https://github.com/mafredri/go-trueskill)
---
What do you mean? You expect everyone to spend the time mining and manufacturing everything they need? Or be in a large enough alliance that you rely on different members to manufacture different things? Of course people still go to Jita. 
---
Triennial post by Darius "Im still relevant to EVE" JOHNSON?
---
Can confirm. RIP intact plates :(
---
To be clear, I encourage zkill to implement something similar.  Hell, I'll even share the code if that helps.
---

---
Ha ha, thank you!
---
Yep, player names and portraits on their detail view take you to their zkill, as do corp and alliance links.
---
Market trading might be a little more hectic (especially now, jfc) but I'm still enjoying the hell out of it.
---
Agreed! I'm am all about environmentally friendly planetary interaction. (Still refuse to say 'PP')
---
They are all suicide ships and all die to concord as the game intends, they just have enough people to kill the freighters before concord kills them. 
---
You don't have much stuff. 
---
It is one weekend out of the year for goons to go into highsec to "prove" to everyone that they are still relevant.  Nothing more.
---
okay whatever you need to tell yourself
---
Burn jita = provide goons with content.  Burn delve = content for goons.... Nah I'm good 
---
Stop calling my alts bots, I use isboxer.
---
Or to prove you aren’t safe.... not even in high sec.... not even in your precious jita 
---
I'm not sure about that, wormholers love ganking a mining op, and it's far easier to get a gank set up undetected without the instant free intel of local.
---
We negotiate with Concord for permits to operate in hisec and we are also trusted partners to sell permits on their behalf. Contact your nearest GormSwang office for more details and a jaunty newsletter.

perfect! if you wanted you could add date/time to the very left of every kill on the list, makes it easier to get an idea of whether they are active or not

Well if you decide you want to come back and learn to make more than 1b isk in a year come talk to me. 
---
I mean, its not a dealbreaker but a messy corp history will usually get a question or two from recruiters. 
---
That said, usually a "i was just trying to find a decent group" is a good enough answer unless its really messy
---
Yeah, there's literally nowhere else in all of EVE to even buy things apart from Jita.
---
Those bee guys should stay there for sure.

You're still a fucking idiot wally. But you're my idiot.

I say the contrary actually, the AARs *especially* from sallivan are incredible

No. That plant is a sphere. Clearly isn’t the Earth.

The fireworks at Jita over Christmas gave me a damned heart attack. I undocked and they were going off. First time I'd seen them. I thought I was being attacked.

I've seen better sarcasm, I've seen worse. 5/7.
---
It’s a bit dated after esi but still a good start.
---
Pls for the love of god try to burn delve
---
What I know about it：
---
1.Not bots. Many hostiles have camped and watched him for a long long time. If you think someone as a bot, better collect evidence and report than shit talk.
---
2.Fleet was out and kicking XIX Ishtar fleet's ass at that time. He activated InvulnerCore In time but gave up asking for rescure at last.
---
3.Many Mining Barges were lost, but the value is not more than two excavators. 
---
Don't fly what you can't afford
---
Mine accumulate on my lossboard over at zkill, very convenient place for them
---
Out of curiosity are elo increases and decreases scaled by the elo of your opponent? As in if you beat someone with a low elo do you get a smaller gain than someone with a higher elo? 
---
Aar!
---
You can of course fly ships of any race (and you'll want to cross train for pirate ships anyway).
---
Amarr ships are fine for PVE, with T1 lasers being (like drone boats) great because you don't have to worry about ammo. At the higher end, they can be the core of an armour doctrine - ships like Prophecy, Zealot, Damnation and Curse are pretty good. Oracles are the standard cheap option for bashing structures.
---
Laser training may be Amarr only but all the tracking and range skills apply to hybrids and projectiles too.
---
Prove it. 
---
Better to visit Detroid after DT, many contents at that time.
---
Hulks are a rarity in highsec these days.
---
Nice work :)
---
don't you know? there are literally 2 doctrines in the game, the battleship and the titan :&gt; . Also why even bother discussing with someone who backpedalled *this* hard on numbers
---
Wait what is happening in Jita? 
---
I did not log in for around 2 weeks 
---
Sounds painful.
---
It keeps the prices of exploration loot up when it gets destroyed too 
---
YO THAT WOULD BE A COOL EVENT; all gates fail, everyone gets a wormhole static to the same region, and a random hole to somewhere else. (Except stain gets a lowsec gate) Have it be active for like every other day for a week, to avoid too many huge problems.
---
Touché sir
---
Yes, that’s how elo works
---

We can't mine because Olmeca and the 2nd input broadcasting dude anyway. Goons are highsec alliance now. 
---
^ most underrated comment IMO
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The Missions them selves  
---
&gt;I do not see any reason to fix them  
---
&gt;The take a set time and you have a max people  
---
&gt;Close to incursions  
---
&gt;No reason to change it
---
I heavily disagree with this. Rewards are 1 obvious major factor why resource wars tanked, but you are missing the 2nd one. That is they are not completable by solo and combat Pilots. 
---
The high level  Resource wars require a group or multiboxing for what is essentially a solo activity. This needs to change. Also they can not be completed by combat Pilots. This would need to change as well. Do these 2 things in addition to rewards rework and they would be dandy. Doing them either way of combat or mining should be optional and completing them one way or the other feasible, but not required. CCP does not seem to grasp this concept at all and tries to shove one or the other up peoples asses instead.
---
And as far as rewards go, there is no need to re invent the wheel, just stick regular bounties and a regular generic LP Store in there so the payout ends up roughly same as doing Security missions. Such a simple solution that would be so effective. 
---
Rich coming from someone Who literally imagines people in this thread are defending nolak
---
Wormholes have remained interesting for me to live in for a long time.  Read up on Wormhole living and make sure it is for you.  I relish the Wild West feel, no local, and always having an exit that takes you somewhere new.  
---
Look to my  [first post on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/973rvs/null_sec_isnt_for_me/). I wrote this when I was in Pandemic Horde. Learning from other people and from my own mistakes helped me a lot. I highly recommend to read it thoroughly.  Lots of good, universal advices were given in this thread.
---
The thing about single-use skins though, unless they are really cheap, most aren't going to most likely bother with them given the variety and options which are on the market. Exoplanet skins are plenty cheap and do offer an option.
---
So, a one time skin would have to be both cheap, yet also impressive to look at to drive towards it. But however, if it is cheap. The impact won't be all that large, but not a bad idea having it as an ISK sink, all helps after all in the end.
---
&gt;The rest of us just take a weekend off of EVE
---
Are you really that dependent on Jita? Just buy in Amarr for the weekend or fly the ships you already have.
---
That's the point of using a kill from last year to post about this year. That and the guy who died in that mail is already bitching constantly in jita local.
---
Yep, that’s exactly right. 
---
lol Grrrr Goons would love that.
---
Take it as a blessing and go play a game with more responsive devs.
---
Yearly Burn Jita.
---
Pandemic Horde and Brave Newbies don’t require you to go on pvp fleets, unlike KarmaFleet, but they are quite a bit less safe
---
Don't know about others but it hasn't stopped me. I have 2 Rorqs running, one account ready in standing fleet, and a beepboop bot in Jita. It's 15 min between kills in Jita and those take about a 5 minutes before I explode back into station, so no time lost there. The systems in Delve seem as crowded as normal weekends and we're still saving idiots.
---
I watched CODE fail at ganking a Gnosis...really ruined the image I had of them XD
---
Nothing at all please continue your normal hauling
---
How does he deal with its drones? Also the npcs will switch to you after going aggro.

Honestly the only CSM I truly respect is Suitonia (not sure spelling), 2 or 3 of them seem to be either extremely out of touch or just plainly and blatantly pushing their (or their allainces) agenda at the cost of "fuck everyone else and fuck eve" , and the remaining ones are OK, I may not agree with them but at least I understand their positions.
---
Its the 2-3 self interest agenda pushers that give all of CSM a bad name and cause most of the issues which then spills over to the other CSM members. These few should never have been CSMs.
---
So say what you will, but a lot of the rhetoric and crap they get is deserved. Its unfortunate that the crap spills over to the other ones that do not deserve it.
---
freighter sellers are going to make a killing like always
---
There was def at least one where the triage boys had to mobilize in Providence.  That was a damn fine fight.

I was hisec mining with an orca and 2 hulks before I joined PH, was pretty funny watching cats suicide into the orca whenever I docked the hulks in it when code entered system... hulks are out there, just mainly used by people who don’t afk mine :p 
---
Can I get a who's who? I only know a few of the faces...

Im starting my own BURN RENS campaign .... wait does anyone know if Rens is still there?
---
Burn jita should be a random thing that happens monthly.

Only Goonswarm Federation or anyone can help? 
---
Difference seems to be Delve eats anything bigger than a dozen ships in wholesale blocks. This magical mystical kraken or two emerge from the void, vomit a tidi-inducing cone of energy into their path of travel and the whole fleet wakes up back in hisec.
---
This idea is not new, novel or unexpected. But you're welcome to try of course. It's not like they totally expect or indeed look forward to feeding the shark tank. :popcorn:
---
They seem to move in packs out in P Horde space.
---
all miners are in delve
---
Hah I'm not sure why I bother. Perhaps I hope some will become aware and start having more fun.
---
I won't hold my breath.
---
iteration is a bad word at ccp, dont bother
---
All of them. They do not try to interfere with the NPC reprisal mechanic after the gank. The organizers laid in stocks of over 50,000 ships two weeks ago.
---
Plz link also BR when you were unable to kill '''thrashers''' for a hour or so. And why DOzran lost two dreads in a row, some sort of mental breakdown?
---
They aren’t using hulks in delve.
---
… and this is why you set up jump clones.  DERRR.  Besides, its not like they didn't announce it was coming on their Twitch stream.

the fact that you have your monitor sideways upsets me more than it should.

at least the winter one handed out skins like a broken vending machine in the hacking room, this very last though is maybe the worst one they've ever done.
---
ouch
---
Its nice to see PL playing eve again
---
tl:dr again: null mining under a super umbrella while monitoring Intel channels, mining aligned, and not entirely afk is lucrative as fuck. 
---
I... What? Dude, you seriously said that Goons knew he was RMTing, and then linked to evidence that we knew he was a loanshark.

Like some on, dude, if you seriously think that's correct, you're too fucking stupid to live.

from horde perspective mine is correct since we didnt lose anything really but a few dictors :p
---
Goddam merkelchan is hot. 
---
Hate to break it to you OP, but this feature has already been designated for the scrap heep by CCP, and won't see iteration and probably get removed.
---
The economy was trundling along nicely before nullsec ratting in supers was the norm. With both many more and many fewer players than currently. The fact a nominally strategic combat asset is mass-used by line members for PvE is already drifting a great distance away from their initially intended role.

---
Dont think it works too well in wormholes....
---
A refinement that I might suggest if you were interested would be to rank which hulls were winning the most, and what types they were winning against. Obviously your website right now is really useful and you can manually follow that information via the links, but it might be neat to be able to see what the meta was or how in changes over time. Just an idea.
---
Great job, really nice site.
---
Lol.  I have the fittings for my next Titan sitting up in Jita right now.  I thought about putting the move contract up for it...but I did not want to re-buy everything.  :-)
---
It's a nice break from the usual jita garbage 
---
So if losing \~2b is a years worth of effort, you need to quit anyway.
---
Absolutely! If you check out /about I talk about how I think it would be cool to make a “rock, paper, scissors” graph of which hulls are likely to win against which others. Would have to weigh the probabilities of the outcomes by the elo of the pilots. Sounds like a fun thing to add.

pick one, and only one.

Correct, except they use Coercers for Burn Jita by and large because the better range of Coercers can be successful with a more casual play style by less experienced gankers than Catalysts which require more precise flying due to their short range.

2:1 in the winners favor. Close fights are always fun

I think a month degrade would be a fair timeline

Wow pretty sad this year only a half dozen above 10b and that includes the jf.

Most seem to be close to empty

is it possible to have a monthly one aswell ? being on it while not playing anymore seems silly.

How do I get in on this? I want loot

I want to get in on this for the loot. How?
---
I’d rather keep the global list, but it sounds like some sort of elo decay due to inactivity is probably called for.   Not too aggressive, but if you don’t do a PvP site in a month or so you’ll start dropping in the rankings.
---
Haven’t implemented that yet, but I think I should.

---
Equivalent would be doing anoms/sigs in Tama.  Everytime I pass through there the entire board is lit up with red sigs.
---
running rorqs with your alpha ganker?
---
not cool
---
I mine in highsec precisely to produce tears like this.
---
We whelped trying to defend a azbel. Not really more to it than that. Engaged the ishtar fleet, immediately the munins jumped in, our logi couldn't hold, fleet died.
---
I never said anything big, they don't show people working on anything, because there's absoultely nothing announced going forward so they can't show anything except mention another iteration of the Agency.

AAR for this low effort post:

Accurate BR: horde was with RC but in thier own fleet. 
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=3708,3750&amp;b=8492863&amp;e=90&amp;t=wafke
---
Provi had started anchoring several structures a couple days ago. RC saw this and had to punish them for putting two Azbels on the same grid. 
---
RC formed Ishtars and Provi had arty machs. There were two main targets, Azbel in 49GC and Fort in 8P9. Provi Jumped into 49GC to take on ishtars and save the Azbel, RC tackled the Mach fleet and Horde joined with Munnins and sprung the trap. RC lost a few to instablap including my Waffles supplied Loki. RC + Horde hold grid.
---
Side fight in 8P9: RC put a nag on the fort solo and was jumped by 5 dreads. RC jumped in dreads to kill them. One never siege and literally warped away and jumped back to 9UY. 
---
They were just goon alts
---
Fcs panicked cause there was nothing to shoot, so had to get their own alts in there.
---
Blue fucking?

Aint that rule 1 even?

---
Why? Any specific reason? or you are going to do it just because you can?
---
Okay babez
---
Math must not be your strong suit. Either that or you fucked up making your BR.
---
It's getting spammed with garbage, and basically nothing helpful is coming of it.
---
heh sure thing kid
---
suck my little dick
---
CCP devs just found a new tool. I'm fairly sure the Abyssal sites and the AT hiatus are connected. Now if you can filter by filament type we'd be all set to see how the environment shapes the meta. 
---
No argument there...more spam than real help....but i got some good sites to start my list right. 
---
Steve Ronuken looks like the cool uncle you wish you had.
---
&gt;Could it just be that I was in pandemic horde and lots of people were out to get me?
---
Lol yes. Horde space tends to be high-traffic with hunters since it’s such a target-rich environment and the responses are not as heavy when compared to an area like delve.
---
I’m not sure if you have the skills yet at this point, but one thing that I used to have a decent amount of fun with to make isk actively a few years ago was inter-station shipping and trading. Depending on how many blues horde has, you might be able to make some decent isk with a blockade runner, buying things cheap in one area of space and selling high in another. Back before citadels, I used to use an eve market tool to find areas that had matching orders and make runs between medium/small hubs. It was especially fun. Since I often went through dangerous parts of bull and really had that feeling of being an on-the-edge-of-your-sear smuggler or something. 
---
I think the BR site's team selection thing is screwed. None of the linked BRs are showing that even close to correctly for me.
---
How is the vindicator gank doing? :)
---
Just about the level of intelligence I expected from you.
---
To late nothing can be done at this point.  Only way to win is not play the game. 
---
This made me lol 
---
i redeemed myself from my shameful failure yesterday and got top damage in the vindi on a kill. I'll probably do another couple vindi ganks today
---
? we
---
Not fun to be on the losing side of a batphone is it? Its ok, you can tell Siege Green and Test where the bad man touched you. 
---
Oooo, I bet I can. Didn’t think of that. I’ll look into it. Thanks. 
---
I use a covetor, yield not much lower but I can still ask and only risk ~20m it pays for itself in like 30 minutes of mining.
---
BR seems accurate. AAR is not far from accurate, tho unnecessarily propagandaish.
---
Was a good fight. We (Provi) had the upper hand at first, then Horde came and odds shifted in attackers favor. We lost, things got exploded. 
---
gfs all around
---
I love this event
---
okay? wasnt even there but coolio, continue your sperg
---
The carrot is a lie.
---
honestly I don't know about this year, I know there have been other groups involved in the past.
---
1. place buy orders in jita
---
2. freighter goods from jita to hek
---
3. Sell in hek at 500%
---
4. ???
---
5. Profit
---
What is the copy time on their bpo?
---
Good stuff.

What is the tally lost to concord?

PSA: While Burn Jita is hosted by goons you don't have to be in Goons to join in the festivities.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

You sir are one of our many unwritten heroes of EvE!

This game has so many developers (whether webpage, stats, etc.) that make this game so much better.

40 mil/hr in a covetor?  What do you mine?

I have perfect skills and run orca boosts, usually mine ice but I also have a few moons with some pretty good ores.

they have a slack, probably your best bet.

Who says it's an Alpha? I just tossed it in one of the character slots in one of the 6 accounts I have. It's in the same account that I use for my "Alpha" fleet account and my Jita Trader alt. What do you think I am? Space poor?

WHO IS DOWNVOTING ME
---
no
---
All I see is horde vs all when I open it lol
---
Once each month at a random time in each month.
---
Well... guess what they could have done with all that material that got destroyed!! They could have built something with it...
---
What's wrong with you? 
---
Fun.
---
I know, I know... not a common feature of Eve...
---
fuck shart  dragon tbh
---
Indeed. Many of those kills were not in Goons.
---
You got a 1 in 4 chance in any given month, which isn't very random. The op pretty much has to be a weekend affair.
---
So the guy just lost $13 us dollars.  Boo Hoo.
---
(BTW When did zKill do that cool hover over for how much real money was lost)
---
Oh yeah I totally missed that link. That would be a really great addition.
---
Kinda sounds like you are space poor. 
---
Exactly... the question is, whose sarcasm is getting that score, mine, or his?
---
Shark Week needs to be a permanent feature.
---
Since this is 2019 we are all supposed to empathize with this individual.  In order to properly understand the pain of their loss qe must ensure everyone knows what it feels like to get ganked on a gate in Jita.  The only solution is to tank more freighters to help this poor soul by giving them someone who understands the pain to cry with.
---
I think we should campaign to make Stainguy a mod.
---
Yes, if griefing/ganking is your thing, reach out to CODE or other orgs with a HS pubbie bashing sig
---
When people aren't paying attention to you so you have to pretend to be some mad dude on the internet so people will pay attention to you.
---
The fuck last i tried i made like 5m an hour mining trit in hs
---
great site 
---
nice to see myself on rank 6
---
Well done sir!
---
every belt ore besides plag &amp; pyro are shit, ice is the best isk/hr in HS  besides moons but most belts are heavily farmed by bots and basically cleared right away also locals will share timers so you won't get access often if you aren't one,  and for moons, you can find gneiss/ark/bistot etc moons that aren't even claimed just sitting around.
---
Technically, "y'all" is a socially accepted contraction of "you all" when addressing an unknown quantity of multiple people. 
---
On topic, i totally forgot about this and made the mistake of making a shopping trip to jita for a new ship and fitting. Luckily i was in my pod only and realised what was happening when my client crashed 1 jump away from the load (i game on my crappy uni laptop atm).
---
The mostly likely cause is that the launcher can't write the eve files to disk for some reason. Common causes for this kind of issue include the disk being full, the installer lacking permissions to write to the drive it was installed on or aggressive AV software blocking the launcher from writing.
---
You can check the launcher logs for details, if it's something like that I'd expect them to tell you exactly what. You can find them by hitting the little e in the top right and going show in file browser-&gt;launcher logs. If you're still not sure, file a support ticket and attach the launcher logs to it, one of our GM's can help you.
---
that dude gated his dread around, so we had to teach him a lesson since we were already there
---
That’s impressive. Looks good!
---
Sometimes it's just for the luls
---
That isn't Icelandic rotten shark meat.  I am disappoint.
---
But then I wouldn't be able to take those precious killmarks...
---
I was happy and then sad, the participation rate is so damn low that even I, that loggs in for like half an hour per week, have a top 100 place
---
Fuck it, make it a week affair.
---
Still not quite accurate; TheJudge has hands.
---
You should play Eve, it'll turn you into a real man... Or woman... A human is what I mean... Which is a step up from snap chat user
---
Doesn't make it less retarded.
---
Bait.  You fell for it.
---
the true goon leader. 
---
On that I agree with you totally.
---
I'm not sure if you're new to Eve or what but ganking is the only kind of PVP anyone is ever actually interested in despite what they claim or attempt to present and roughly half the playerbase remains in a constant state of unironically needing therapy to recover from the fact that CCP hasn't designed the whole game to funnel them personally zero risk zero effort frags
---
[I too got one](https://zkillboard.com/kill/29682967/)
---
fuck you got me
---
Also made my gank toon omeggers so I can have the rorqs out while I burn
---
CODE or P I R A T are exactly what you should join if you want to gank newbies while making a snapchat story with your balls and far to many filters over it that they actually look big.
---
Asscee is recruiting in jita local 
---
Haven't been to jita ever since i joined a null corp
---
le sigh..
---
They should burn it more often then 
---
I make freighters for income, and throughout the year for every 5 I make, 1 goes to Jita to sit and wait.
---
They all get sold every year during and after burn Jita.
---
I make so much loot because of this, and every year I'll see at least 1 person buy a replacement and lose it the same day. It's so great.
---
Feeeeeed meeeeee
---
Everyone else failscaded and quit.
---
so you could have a burn jita that starts on the 30th and one that starts on the 1st?
---
I don't think you've thought this through
---
What are alpha clones?
---
A cov with strip miner 1 and no buffs would still fill up in less then 30mins, if your afk for that long your ship isn’t paying for itself 
---
Heart attack on a plate, jesus
---
Given that most of the gankers are in T1 Dessies, nobody is going to bother trying to dodge Concord, so just view all the Catalyst losses in Jita/Perimeter.
---
It's not like suicide ganking is an attention intensive activity, you get a fitted ship, sit in the channel and tab in whenever the next wave is going out and you want to participate.
---
thin men and  women are under represented!
---

---
large scale market manipulation by the organizers, braindead fun for the line members.
---
The day isn't over yet, post seems a little premature
---
Well, obviously it wouldn't work for February.
---
The fleets are generally open, or at least they were previously, a lot of the killmails above have non-goon entries.
---
How do you think we get our catalysts to our bases?
---
Why not burn the other markets once a month and then jita once a year?
---
It's probably rare to have any full time haulers who don't account for suicide ganking nowadays
---
You'd probably complain more doing Burn Delve than they would receiving it, to be fair.
---
Officially, it's Imperium event.  
---
However, it is coordinated on unsecured mumble server.  
---
If you are cunning enough, you can get in and join the fun.  
---
We usually have folks from neutral and even hostile entities burning Jita with us.
---
get an inty, go to jita, change overview to only show cans and hope you can autismo snatch anything blue before a retard shoots the wreck.
---
oh and then get out before your suspect status makes you enemy number one for the entire grid.
---
i seriously hope that the csm won't just focus on nul but eve as a whole but its good to remind some people that this is a game even though it can be a full time job for those running corps/alliances.

Damn good work

Unwanted citadel reclaiming. 
---
Get a hauler with at least 10k hold, go find an unanchoring structure and keep an eye on it until it pops and you can steal it. 12/16 so far :) 
---
What about ghost sites? Or gas labs? Or unrated sigs? They all require more tank than an astero can give as far as I know, though if you can do it in an astero I definitely want to know.
---
All I see are autisic men with toomuch time on their hands representing a half assed MMO played by 40 yr old neck beards

---
Because Burn Jita has never happened. That's so crazy, I'm crying for you. Right in the feels bro. Oh and that bait, that bait was soooo damn good. I spit that bitch out though. See you in Jita in an hour.
---
bullshit! No lube asshole! The pain makes it better, I promise.
---
Because it is now more cost effective to inject 1, 2, or 3 specialized toons per account for specific purposes than it is to inject a single 250m char.
---
200m+ characters used to be worth a *lot*.  Now they are only worth their scrap value.
---
270m sp '06 btw.  Don't get me wrong, I can see the value of an influx of newer characters spending money on the game.  But for those of us who had spent many years training our toons, even in times when we were long term afk (like u/ducttapechainsaw ) we kept those toons training because sp was quite literally irreplaceable - it was a long term investment which has effectively become worthless.  So it does stick in the craw a little bit when a newb whale can inject to whatever they like within days of starting the game.
---

---
Great win
---
How did they get caught?
---
A good corp has areas where the PvP content is pretty much invited and contained while having a very safe krabbing area located elsewhere. If it's secure enough then only wormhole spawns are a threat.
---
It devaluated it because anyone with enough money can have a perfect pvp focused toon within an hour. Before injectors, it would have taken years or finding the right toon on the character bazaar (if you had any luck).  
---
And as you mention, yes injecting so many sp's cost astonomical amounts of isk so it basically benefit to players who already have isk to spend in another toon, not newbros (although there's some discussion on this point). 
---
Gets an app.
---
Does not go to where the app tells you in order to get support.
---
Yep, OP is definitely a wormholerBTW.

You may want to ignore or count for half points or something fights from prior to the resistance penalty. It changed the meta somewhat.

I want to report this but I dont snitch

Burn Hek!
---
none where ganked as far as i know and so were no nomads
---
In case you are being funny on purpose then congrats on reaching your goal, that shit takes some work. 
---
But if you're looking to make me impressed, I'd be more impressed if you dropped into X47 armor timer with zero killmarks. 
---
Shit was going to die that day, that much was a certain, and still committing from both sides, now THAT is impressive. Here's why X47 is more impressive than the dankest of individual pilot killboards: 
---
* The titan and super owners acquired the wealth to afford that shit (a titan/super alt in itself is easily 80bn to inject). That takes a certain level of effort that warrants some level of impressiveness. Someone also had to farm the a-types and concord LP etc for them, mine the ore, salvage the wrecks for the blue loot in the rigs, acquire sovereignty to build the darn hulls, etc. 
---
* The leaders and FCs are putting their gameplay style on the line when they commit alliance assets like titans and supers to the field knowing there will be a hefty opposition. Because if things goes bad they may lose the privilege to lead and command for the rest of time. That they are willing to take that risk is impressive, especially its all ultimately just for "content" since no group has to put up a fight, they can always just move elsewhere (especially if they don't have 40tr worth of structures in place). 
---
* The leaders and FCs have gained the trust of the line-members to such an extent that the line-members trust that they will be reimbursed even if things go bad. It is very impressive when the leaders put this trust on the line. This point and the previous one is why I have huge respect for the northern leaders for committing to the X47 hull timer, I was deeply impressed that they committed to a combined imperial legacy fleet with omni-DD damage flavors (If any of the northern FCs and leaders are in the northern parts of Norway hit me up and I'll buy you a beer for that, and with the Norwegian beer prices that's saying something of how impressed I was). 
---
* Hundreds if not thousands of people have to work together as parts of a huge machine, to make such huge fights happen. Scouts, FCs, spies, fuelers, structures, importers/manufacturers, finance guys, diplos, anchors, backup anchors, backup FCs, comms infrastructure, chat infrastructure, timers coordination and much more. Even translation for multiple languages in the coalition during the fleet (and leading up to it). 
---
So if we take X47 armor timer as a "10" of impressiveness, on a scale from 1 to 10, then your killmarks are maybe a 3, maybe a 3.5 since you did take the opportunity to roam in delve while X47 armor timer was happening (While it can be called risk-averseness, its funny, I recognize that. But Lanchester's square law says that it would be mathematically better tactically if your super pilot had a normal nyx or even a Wyvern in the X47 armor timer, instead of roaming delve to kill pointless targets of no importance since they are not taking part in the X47 fight). 
---
TL;DR: On a scale from 1 to 10 of impressiveness, your killmarks are about tree fiddy.

Oh, this again?
---
&gt; Wait what is happening in Jita?
---
Goons start ganking people. Get a bunch of lame killmails (RIP new player retention). People fuck off to other markets or other games for a while. Goons start sending in freighters on alts packed with goodies to gank to make it look like they're wrecking havoc. Goons start posting on forums on alts about how they're so very angery that this is happening. Goons start posting on forums about how they're saving Eve with content. Lather, rinse, repeat every year.

Or come down to Delve

True, why just keep it to Jita?

Then again, I actually support my local market of Hek instead of going to Rens.

Pathfinder has a public site as well from what I understand. Guna guess most people either use that or use a private copy.

Pff. I bet I could take all these guys in a fight.

since burn jita is announced everytime it begin its your own fault really.
