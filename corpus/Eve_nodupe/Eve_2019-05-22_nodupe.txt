Nothing like seeing a wallet go up as fast as an incursion day.

---
Thank you for proving my point. Your assistance is greatly appreciated! Come again soon!
---
I live in USTZ no issues claiming rewards here.
---
It was probably too-late, and unwise, to un-anchor a strategically located asset (gateway to Tribute).
---
That doesn't necessary mean anybody would be willing to dumpster their fleet to preserve it, though.
---
Same Penif has the capacity to be the most evil son-of-bitches in EVE Online and yet one of the most chill nice dudes to be around.
---
Not as important as real life and responsibilities tho. I know people that can only play 2-3 hours a day and I’m positive they don’t wanna spend that time listening to some neckbeard whine over comms..
---
That being said, being part of Brave nobody really forces you attend however they “advice that you do”, but I’ve felt like I joined Brave for a reason, If I wanted to fight test’s wars I would of joined them, and I don’t like them that much anyway. I’ve attended maybe 10 strap ops and I had only 1 fun battle where we actually staid on grid for 15-20minutes and had a relatively “equal” battle.
---
There's a lot of shit to do (somebody else already posted the infographic) but the claim that the game is "dying" has become more credible over the past 2 years. The backstory is that CCP focused a bit too much on nullsec, which kind of killed a chunk of other playstyles through negligence, and then fucked that up by basically making the most optimal playstyle in null literally bunkering down and farming till your brain turns to goo. Long story short is that Goons basically "won" nullsec, as they now have the uncontestably biggest titan e-peen.
---
But you might still want to check it out, especially on an alpha clone. It's free and maybe you'll find a place you like that isn't growing stale.
---
I'm plenty informed of how dumb the average Goon is. Look at Delves killboard for the last few days
---
 It wasn't Unspoken who started the war, joining Imperium to kill a Sotiyo [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76034305/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76034305/) ?
---
I don't think the people are complaining the free shit isn't good enough. They're complaining it was a thank you event for the players, but it was only a thank you to the players that are able to play every single day.
---
Also, to be fairrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
Trump's Wall? Does this mean Goons paid for it?

What happens when a nuclear bomb explodes over a desert -- the sand turns to glass. A similar fate will happen to Tribute and Tenal, according to the poet who penned this missive.
---
Oh that would be perfect for Barren planets with barely any resources, Slave pens and Barracks to generate Slaves and Marines
---
Aren't we all just a small nudge from quitting at this point? The point is: what should have been a big win from a customer satisfaction standpoint turned into such a clusterfuck they had to put out an @all memo because so many people were unhappy. Community engagement, CCP is bad at it.
---
Star citizen will be eve when eve is star citizen
---
Nice Stockholm syndrom bro.
---
There can be plenty of mid sized fights with hundreds of players that dont suffer crazy tidi.
---
Its the massive 5000 man battles that are ridiculous.
---
no need for garbage people like that in this game
---
I'm hardly a small nudge from quitting- Losing out on 1mil SP for not logging in on time isn't gonna make me abandon the game, my alliance mates, and real life mates I've made through this game. They sent it out to everyone to get the message out there that "if you didn't login in time, tough shit. HTFU".
---
Which year was that? I think I was there too
---
Well as you said you couldn’t compare Eve to a game, I’ve seen older pictures of Eve, ships, systems, buildings as I’m not a vet and I honestly think Eve has aged very very well, look wise as I can’t say anything about the mechanics.. 
---
I just hope CCP, as incompetent people might say/think they are, I really hope that they manage to pull off something game changing in a positive way that would bring the game back to life and by that I mean at least relatively healthy playerbase of 50k ish concurrent players.
---
Balls up and Fight? 
---
You mean Feed.
---
Might I have your stuffs good sir
---
I can help with that : )

GMVA is the last real GalMil alliance left.  FedUp gets numbers because they are a meat shield for Test but otherwise are not actually playing FW/in the warzone.

I'm the ceo of the last one so so you're very welcome to hit me up in game ('GoingOffRoading' in EvE) and I'd be happy to connect you to the best fit given your TZ and play style.
---
They probably would if they were actually out to really hurt PanFam. This "war" is really born out of the necessity for *some* kind of conflict to quench the bloodthirst of goon pvp players. They knew that they'd actually put something at risk by attacking Test, as that would have quickly led to a two front war, so they went for the low hanging fruit in Tribute. They don't really want to "win" this war as much as fight it.
---
Congrats you won eve !
---
I wonder what the complaints would have been if the event had been a time gated in game reward track similar to other events where you actually have to do something like grind boring ass content rather than just pressing a button at character login.
---
The modern events are almost always downtime to downtime. On those occasions when they end them differently they tell us in advance. The issue here, I suspect, is that you live in a different part of the world from CCP and it's a cultural misunderstanding. They can't think like you because they don't view the world the way you do. From their perspective what they said makes perfect sense and your argument is confusing.
---
In any case though you should have noticed the difference ahead of time. There was a countdown timer and you had 18 days to notice it, do the math, and figure it out. Instead you assumed someone on the opposite side of the planet thinks just like you.
---
16 days necessary, 18 days length overall. Please explain to me how you did not get the rewards, eventhough you logged in every day? Or are you mad that CCP didn't tell you to actually click the "Claim" button?
---
no no I get it. The losses at home don't count when you're not there. So I'm sure you'll understand that the losses in Tribute don't count either since we aren't there.
---
Let me tell you about booshing ravens...
---
Most other MMOs sees eve player interaction as a form of griefing.  Eve is special BECAUSE it is in stark contrast with other MMOs.   You want to kill EVE, make it an instanced game where player presence and influence no longer matters
---
Depend how many of them were using IWI
---
I sure do understand.  We will see which matters more in the end.
---
"I have trans friends" does not give you licence to speak for me or my trans sisters. I will not calm down and take it. This is my battle every day. I don't have the luxury of picking it. 
---
The joke was inappropriate.
---
boy bye
---
Quite the opposite -- by transferring the structure to a no-name corporation, they're signalling that they expect to lose the structure. This way, when it dies, it won't stain their killboard. Of course, everyone will still know it's theirs, but something something lies damned lies and statistics.
---
Great News!
---
DT on the 20th is on the 20th in my calender. I have never seen a date not given until DT. Please show me where CCP explicitly said "until 23:59 on the 20th"
---
*Your standing with "PGL's merry band of edgelords" has increased by 5.0.*
---
5 bil would be great, good luck with your newfound free time
---
I'm a random person
---
Which CCP employee came to your house with weapons and forced you to partake in this event? I think this person needs to be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the laws in your area. Did you reach out to your law enforcement? I can't believe they would allow this tragedy to go unpunished. No game developer anywhere has a right to force you to do anything against your will. This is going to far CCP, way the hell too far!  I demand justice. No justice, no peace!! #endplayerslaverynow #resistdeveloperviolence
---
According to the Panfam spin , all of ER were owned by goons.
---
I just roam w space solo. Granted I have a ton of w spaxe experience but the non local gives you an opportunity to scout and figure out who you are trying to kill.
---
Same. I logged in on Monday morning US/Eastern expecting to claim the last day's prize and was completely surprised that nothing was there.
---
Missed it by a few hours for 5 accounts. Guess I should've skipped my college graduation :thonking:
---
What's your point?
---
shhhhh no. Tikle most definitely has fewer supercaps than provi, and absolutely has less than the HAMMER of Legacy Coalition, Requiem Eternal
---
I don't believe it's even a reskin. It looks like this is just the Chinese localization?
---
Would love 5b. Would multiply my wallet by more than 2.5x 
---
Would put it in to exploding ships or being exploded. More likely the latter.
---
Please good sir do not ruin the pubbies narrative with your logic and facts. #pubbieignorancebestignorance
---
before joining the blob I did solo nullsec exploration and flew npsi's and public roams - would definitely recommend.
---
Eh... I missed out on the last day... got stuck pulling a 48 hour shift the first day it started... everything was going fine... but I was a groomsman for a buddy's wedding in the middle of all this and it was several hours from home so I couldn't login for a whole day and half. Sad to miss out on the million sp but when you've been playing as long as I have it's no big deal. All my toons are over 100mil sp anyways. I don't see why everyone's groaning about it. Crap happens sometimes.
---
It's an older meme, sir; but it checks out
---
What I find appauling and more than a bit terrify is CCP's new division. If reddit is to be believed CCP has people going door to door presumably with force making people login. When they don't they are being penalized, again presumably with force. It's shocking and I can't believe governments across the globe haven't been able to stop these agents of terror.
---
Yea he's way worse than someone who's life is so meaningless that he's mad about not gettinf immaterial items in a video game. 
---
Maybe be more upset about your gf being in the hospital instead of a fucking videogame reward that you could get for $20.
---
Hey Dad ! I'm on reddit
---
I wish you luck in your future endeavors
---
You don't even have to push said button, which also appears in game at the bottom of the neocon right above the clock. The dang window pops open and won't let you pass until you click it.
---
The spin is real. He wasn’t fleet invited and warped off. He got bumped/drifted. There was a post of an album of pictures. He’s right on the edge of tether, not midspace
---
Either or.  Doesn't matter who loses them.  I'm trying to earn the guy some ISK.
---
Why does anybody needs screenshots, when your writing screams you're butthurt about it. 
---
You know what's interesting, is how you fucked up in WC, then fucked up with CE, then fucked up in low dec cuz you didnt suck BBCs good enough, and how you are fucked up right now.
---
You are delusional, I wonder why people follow you in your madness.
---
I love your vids. Flying trig becuz of you doc!  Keep it up!
---
You are going to be missed. I know I will feel empty inside from now on. Please consider returning some day. This game cannot continue without you. You are the golden Plex provider. Your Plex is like no other Plex and only you can provide for the server hamsters. Please think of the hamsters won't you? I mean they have children so at the very least think of the baby hamsters.
---
At least wait for the xpac details man.
---
I said what was most common, not what was most fun. I'd rather not get blueballed, but 75% of the time I undock a supercap it means no shots will be fired.
---
Please no don't go! Clearly you have hit your head. Maybe you need a doctor it sounds like there's damage. There isn't a game anywhere that let's every player win, competition is what makes it a game. Anything else is just exercise.
---
"AND YOU SHIPMASTER JUST GLASSED HALF A CONTINENT! Maybe the Flood isn't all I should be worried about."

Never went into a wh until 2018 and I been playing since 09. Lots of fun my dude. Takes a little getting used to it but very fun.
---
It's cute how the North thinks that zkill matters.
---
Let me direct you to r/choosingbeggar friend. You'll feel right at home.
---
Those must have been hellish exams and proyects if you didn't have time to open the launcher, log in, click and log out... unless of course you were handwriting the proyects, which would make you have to turn on the computer first.
---
You forgot, just admit it and stop trying to blame others.
---
Log in events like this one suck, but not for the reasons you mentioned.
---
well the netease's operation strategy on games are whole completely sh\*t.
---
Let me give you some example:
---
1. In "Chu Liu Xiang", it is a free2play game, but if you reach some certain level, and you have not spent any money, netease will ban your account and you need to pay some money as "grant" money to unban your account, it is basically force you to pay.
---
sorry when I really want to write these stories I realized my English is too poor to describe these shits, so I wont give another example.
---
But the typical strategy of Netease only focus on how to get the richest player spend a lot of money within the first several month, after that, they will leave the game to die.
---
Other Free 2 Play games are feeding you shit if you not pay, but if you pay you can have a caviar sandwich. But in Netease's game, you need to pay to be qualify for eating shit, and you pay more you eat less shit, but you never get your sandwich.
---
Hope CCP can directly operating it, otherwise I will not recommend you to try this game.

There's the "EVE time" term to use if they can't automate recipient's time zone.

In my years playing different MMOs, being a designer on an MMO with a sub count roughly the size of Eve's, and watching people play them for 20 years or so, I have to say that it's often the "little nudges" that add up to make someone disillusioned enough to quit paying you to play your game.  
---
Thus, it makes no sense for a company to irritate its players over something that costs them almost nothing.  
---
Sure, it feels good for the guy in CS who "gets to stick it to those whiny customers", but it doesn't generate additional revenue for your business.  
---
And it takes roughly 6x more money to gain a new subscriber than it does to retain an existing one.  
---
When an MMO has an event that lasts till X date, if I were running things? It'd be till 11:59PM on that date (or in Eve's case, downtime on the 21st just to be sure). Why? Because it costs me nothing, but makes the people who are giving me their money happier about the product I want them to continue to purchase from me.  
---
Oh, and I like to do right by the players.  
---
An attitude that seems to be sadly lacking in the game industry these days, which seriously boggles my mind. You treat people well, build up goodwill over time, and they'll be far more likely to give you leeway when you make mistakes... and you will, because games are made by humans, and we eventually make a wrong judgement call and have to clean up the mess.  
---
That's a lot easier to do when there aren't a bunch of "little nudges" already piled up against you.
---
It's not ridiculous at all. When you have a game that is structured as such that the way players interact is the primary content driver, when you take the players out the full content isn't there.
---
Eh, Killmail is a killmail I guess
---
The article describes plainly who he is, it's real thin on why we should care though.
---
You know what you do?  
---
On May 30th, you announce that you're extending the event for 2 days, and it will end at exactly X time on Y date, Eve server time.  
---
Then you've buffed your event, and you make some percentage of your players grateful that you're such a cool gaming company.  
---
You know what you don't do? Not make it clear when the event ends everywhere that a player might see it, and assuming that all your players just know that your events end at DT on the day before the date you stated.  
---
It's just a dumb way to run a business that depends on people voluntarily giving you money every month.  
---
For the record, I don't even have any active accounts, so I don't have a horse in the race either way. Just doesn't make sense to not be clear, and turn something positive into a negative, when it costs you absolutely nothing.
---
no love for waffles :(
---
Doctor Evil: Riiiiiight.
---
I too am goon ceo.
---
Except CCP has always done things on EVE time.  Customer ignorance of their policies doesn't give the players the right to complain when CCP is doing the same thing they always have.
---
Now this is how you leak someone's dirty laundry. 10/10 And I love the little RMT "club" thing
---
Goons kick people who has accounts/toons in another alliance with Sov... So i don't think so. Besides, one of that guys if a friend of my, they were living in HS forever, and. A week ago Goons hotdroped their miners badly. :V
---
Besides, they engoy poding criminals goon pods in HS. (Me too, tbh)
---
Pretty pathetic tbh. I've, honestly, expected more from them.
---
lmbo based
---
So many things are wrong. And these are your proper beliefs. Don't say EvE is amazing. Technically,it's a piece of shit that went 64bits recently, and goes 0,1% when a big "fight" (aka spreadsheet in potato mode, only thing to do is f1/fighters/siege every 5mins at least) 
---
Only thing that is great is the community. 
---
And Star citizen's community is already great. 
---
Now stop being idealistic and so biased

Because its only free during those days dumbass

so it's not just a meme

these guys are actually obsessed with killboard stats

I was gonna say you have to hand it to them for doing the research, then I saw the username...
---
the arbiter and the shipmaster are the best in the series
---
master chief is over rated
---
 dont @ me
---
I guess -1 keep already.
---
This is just prep work for them claiming its an unaffiliated "freeport" keepstar that they aren't responsible for and didn't want anyway.
---
School systems in HS are protected by CCP from regular griefing. If someone does gank a noob in one of those areas they can be sanctioned by a gm or even banned.
---
MUH KILLBOARD MAKES ME LOOK LEET
---
Is this a CCP developed game or is this just a NetEase game with Eve art? One could be fun, the other will be hated in western countries.
---
Ah okay.
---
Wasn't really on when it happened, only got the rumor from discord.
---
There were definitely multiple people saying there was a fleet posing as one of our FCs and inviting people though.
---

---
It's cute how goons think this is a good idea. Just means ncpl can move to lowsec, and harrass the ever living shit out of nullsec like they used to do. O and as for titans and super building pffft just put alts in goons and ship them to the lowsec staging. More content, cheaper super and titans, no blues to hand hold, sounds like a win for ncpl
---
Just a thought, but what about donating to a group or established players who are known to help out newer players.

&gt; Whoever you are, random Goon, I appreciate your effort. Never give up!!
---
rmt
---
Haha really? They're going to do whatever they can to not give any meaningful engagement and try to kill as many krabs as possible. Then they'll tout zkill stats proving how elite they are. It kind of makes sense really. They claim to not be interested in empire building, so who cares if their home gets destroyed? Not them. They get lots of "pvp" seal clubbing in delve while we're deployed, and we stamp out their home. They claim to like the nomadic life so being the gracious overlords we are, we're helping them. Everyone wins
---
Looks like rorq pilots are downvoting.
---
CCP was watching from the bushes as Blizzard took careful aim at their foot. And whispered quietly to itself "I can do better."
---
It'll be interesting to see if modern NCdot and PL could actually do this. I suspect that turnover and low recruitment standards (and the castration of passive moongoo) have divested them of their prior ability to be vultures.
---
Just think of all the useless shit you got that fills your containers someplace and be happy. Oh wait nevermind.
---
Sorry. First ever writeup and was a bit lost about how to lay it all out.
---
Because CCP has enough players to lose and not worried with retention.
---
big if true
---
Some NCdot supercap havers have, in the paste, dropped corp before being killed in their supercap to avoid the negative killboard stats.
---
Canceled my subscription after reading that email.  I doubt I'll be the only one.
---
This is pretty piss poor design IMO.  going to make a lot of casuals or returning players mad that barely missed it.
---
Fly safe man. I've tried quitting several times before, but everything always seems to lead back to me warping through wormholes be it tomorrow or a year from now. At any rate, keep your toon around, you never know where you'll be in a few years. :)

Also yes, some people in ncpl sure care about their KBs , but so do some goons and literally people in every alliance.It is a personal preference in my opinion

Some if this is entertaining/sketchy, some of this is just plain normal.

Man, I hope nobody ever posts screenshots of me dissing wingspan... oh the humiliation.  /s

I think they could totally do a full Eve mobile client, and I want it SO much, you could never keep up with someone on a full computer, but it would be cool.

Also it hurts to see a mobile platform render the game better than my laptop, still waiting on building a rig.

Dear Allies,

Once again, you set the tone for the year by helping us run a successful Wormhole Defense. 
---
We appreciated your unfailing attention to destroying the morale of the attackers. 
---
With all the last minute snags, we worried that something would fall through the cracks, but you anticipated every contingency and our Occators got through. 
---
Several players commented on how well you had organized your disruption of the attackers.
---
We are fortunate to have you donate your time on occasion like this. 
---
On behalf of The Buccaneers, We express heartfelt thanks for all you did for us.

Nope.

Yup. Final ultimatum lost thwi first defence on that contract and then Enfield was looking for a way to back out.

---
You could always be a hauler, or go into reactions, its Eve do what ever you want.
---
Ok, and?
---
In all fairness this is from a while ago so it may or may not reflect current Goon policy. I say this not out of an attempt to defend Goons (I am not now nor have I ever been a member of Goons and I regard them as the sort of risk-averse blobbers that are actively destroying this game alongside TEST, PanFam, and all the big null blocs) but simply out of a desire to be fair.

That being said, a common counter-argument I've heard when people are critical of what the Mittani said here is that "he's saying to make sure you're certain before you report to CCP so that innocent people don't get banned". First of all, that's not what he said. He said not to report them *period*. And even if that was what he said, you should still report people you suspect of botting or broadcasting so that CCP can be made aware of them and can look through the data they have and make a determination. CCP can't act on people they don't know are out there, and it's not like we have GMs flying through Delve on a regular basis taking note of everyone they see up 23.75/7. 
---
This recording is the reason why we need to remove bot income from corp and alliance wallets when bots get banned, so we can encourage corps and alliances to develop, implement, and enforce consistent and effective internal reporting practices. Maybe reimburse part or all of the loss if the corp or alliance kicks out the banned member prior to their ban.
---
that's generally the reaction of all groups I joined, and then they learn what an actually GOOD covert scout can really do compared to the average clown player. And then 3 weeks later they decide they need more active scouts. 
---
So your reply doesn't phase me in the slightest, all is shows is you're used to clown players.
---
If you have read carefully I have not blamed anyone. All I said was that the event did not give anyone past day 3 enough incentive as it has probably intended.    
---
Not all computers have EVE installed you know, especially the one that is controlling the CNC machine :p For a few days I didn't have time to go through the commune and just slept wherever I could.

&gt; Fun random side fact: In the original 2009 demo of Walking In Stations, a crude RTS-like game was demonstrated in the corporate office (I believe it was turn-based, can't remember...).

You're best off throwing 100-150 into plex to combat inflation, do it via buy orders and pick it up as cheap as possible, and sell for isk as you need, unless you enjoy feeding supplies and titans regularly 200b is enough to play for years

Recent CCP data reveals Goons having less  in botting violations as they're not so dependent on renting, where as Solar and [xDeathX](https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1126496159407792128) clearly are outliers.
---
lmao this might be the worst take of all the shitty takes so far, if NC wanted to go that route, and it was completely viable, don't you think they'd have done it already?
---

I have a titan on one of my mains, not my main main, but a mane for sure. Great hair.
---
I let this stew for a bit so I could think, but I don't want to leave you hanging.
---
I think the crux of our disagreement is this
---
&gt; As for allowing less hardcore players access, fuck no wormhole space is  this good because of the hard commitments you have to make it keeps the  player count relatively low 
---
Being hardcore is cool, but my *opinion* is that I would happily sacrifice that to get more people into wormholes. I'm more invested in wormholes as a space where cynos don't work and people can't dogpile you with unlimited numbers of capitals all the time than I am in wormholes as a space where you have to be hardcore to play.
---

---
I'm not planning to continue these lines of conversation further, but I feel I should acknowledge them. You're obviously welcome to claim the last word if you want.
---
* I was not present for the initial wave of Imperium in Rage. I was unaware of any Goons present in the first wave until now.
---
* I think there likely would be more fights over structures than there are now, but I'm not convinced that's a bad thing.
---
* I think there likely would be more evictions than before, but again I'm not convinced that's a bad thing.
---
It does beg the question as to why they spent three years, give or take, holding space.
---
The answer is that NCdot has a weird hard-on for Tribute. Most likely as Jita-adjacent territory for PVE and industry structures for, I'd guess, maybe a dozen people.
---
That's brainwashed goon propaganda for you.If th mittani says it :"Glorious fabian strategy"
---
If the enemy uses it : "Cowards running and not fighting"
---
blopsing in the middle of nowhere is fun and does not require more than 1 person. 2-3 people is ideal of course.
---
Even NPCs adopted the policy to shoot goons together
---
I'm just glad smart phones weren't a thing in 2003
---
Without tidi (or at least without the server call lag) we'd rely a lot more on dreads, then the majority of an alliance's strategic assets would be in the form of dread-alt skillpoints because the hulls themselves are trivial in cost. Injectors would be expensive as all hell and then people would complain about not being able to inject anything else.
---
They are yellow?

i seem to have this issue when trying to log into the website or in the client
---
The refusal to acknowledge it is what makes it more frustrating. I only have 2 accounts. They are on yearly subs and up in 9 days. It’s hard to refresh those for a couple hundred dollars with a mass reply that says “I didn’t even read your ticket.”
---
Like tell me no if that’s what you decide, but don’t act like a timer that said I have 2 days to claim rewards dropping to hours was good communication.
---
before asset safety if your alliance lost space you were unable to get your stuff back until you got docking rights back in some way, so a lot of people used to sell their stuff for quite cheap to get back some money. Now the structure will just get destroyed and you can get your stuff moved to an accessible station for 15%? of their worth. Kind of killed the concept. Firesales still do happen but at this point it's so rare that you can't make a living out of it
---
\&gt; E1 didn't get banned for recording and posting the sessions, as such. He got banned for what was *on* those recordings.  
---
That's not the line CCP gave us when it went down. But then why would they give their true reasoning? It's not like people need to know what is and isn't acceptable behavior in a sandbox game. /s
---
\&gt;  What was done in the bonus room went over the line. WAY over the line in a few cases. 
---
Like I said, I won't claim E1 was innocent. But the bonus rooms I remember being a part of weren't what you described in the article you wrote. They were a scammer pulling out every trick to get the mark to go all-in. Once that was accomplished (verified via API check), E1 would inform them that they weren't getting any of their stuff back. That's generally where the amusing part began, when they were told they'd been had.
---
Yes, we laughed when they raged. We were fairly sure one guy actually broke his PC when we heard crashing followed by his connection timing out. We didn't feel guilty when they begged, but we didn't find it all that funny either. Some of them were good sports about the whole thing. But in the end, these were people so consumed with their greed in a game that they got tunnelvisioned and couldn't see an incredibly obvious scam pulling them in. It's hard to feel sorry for someone who just handed 20 billion isk to a room full of giggling strangers who promised to give back 100 billion.
---
I traveled out of state twice during this event and still had two days to spare.
---
Its funny how you posted this 3 days after the lastest fireside where he flat out states if you suspect someone of botting then report them to CCP and let them do their damn jobs.

That's a shitty way to treat the people you depend on to make a living.  
---
What if it was a newer player who just started playing?  
---
What if it's someone who played years ago, came back to see what's going on, and hadn't been around for these giveaways with the modern redemption system?  
---
What if it's someone who normally plays during hours Eve time where they'd never encountered this issue before, so had no idea?  
---
I mean, FFS, man, this isn't a "gotcha" game. It's supposed to drive login numbers up and make your players happier about the game so their more likely to pay you more in the future.

Missed out due to being out of the country, it sucks to not get the million sp but these things happen. Sometimes you just get unlucky with timing.

---
What if players have multiple accounts in more than one alliance? And use botting characters outside of their own group, for example in hostile alliances? Im not accusing anyone, but this seems like a smart move cause you get the botting profit, but have the blame fall on a hostile group.
---
That's honestly a stretch since this is a historical record (since day 1). And XiX/SOLAR haven't been hostile to Goons for eons...so I dunno if that really works in this case.
---
Sounds like tower defence minigame inside PI.

Or you could stop begin an idiot and value "attending your college graduation" higher than 1 million SP in a pixel spaceship game.

truly an EPIC post thank u so much :prayerhands:

I get it, you've stashed up a couple of thousand marines and just want their prices to skyrocket. ;)

OH NOES!!! I missed out on free shit in a pixel spaceship game because I had important things to do out of said game. People literally have no logical ground to be mad.
---
Wasnt final ultimatum with pantsufan a few months ago??? Hmmm

Some people would still miss out and then open tickets about it and bitch about it on r/eve

It's a neutral Keepstar anchored in their system and it would be wrong *not* to whore on it!

There is (or was now) an actual button you can click to bring up the rewards.
---
Señor Plow no es macho,

A few years ago they would have made a cool video about it for an expansion that did not have any of the actual functionality. But probably not even that now. Not with all those resources focused on fixing Faction War.

Well I’m glad you had an experience then, I currently have 1, 3, and 6 month eve plans, I came back late last year from playing 10 years ago.

My big goal then was being able to fly and being able to afford a HAC, come to find now it’s less of a priority to me, had a few new skills and ships to specialize for that weren’t around a decade ago.
---
Nice outfit.
---
Gambling in Stations would fix the inflation hole EVE has and would probably make other parts of the game better.  Fuck skins and other money sinks.   Basic gambling in stations would have been better than their "Greed is Good" campaign.   Spend money for isk, don't have that isk be convertible back into money.   
---
Good bye bots as CCP has to try to fight RMT now while getting rich.

Rando contracts corpse to girl streamer new to EVE, price is 1 bil, almost accepts contract without looking at cost, funny reaction when she notices.

---
The site will last 48 hrs or until all the gas and rats have been cleared starting from when the site was first warped to. Despawning sties in a WH has only a negligible effect on there re-spawn time however, as clearing a site causes one to appear somewhere else in WH space, not in system.
---
they were removed, root and stem
---
Can be done significantly faster with better triggers and target management. There is also no need for bling fit, T2 + meta can almost three-cycle Strongholds (with bling fit three-cycle might be possible but I haven't tried).
---
I mean yeah but he owned it.
---
You went out with a bang, and will be helping someone out when leaving. Sounds like EVE will miss you.
---
Don't biomass, you know,  just in case. 
---
PS. With 5 billion isk (5x what I have), I'd fit up my first carrier :D
---
A stratios is a great place to start if you are hunting, but it sin't great for ratting. T3Cs, are another option, and can often be fit to rat as well as hunt (the Proteus isn't great if you want to rat though). Bombers as asteros are other good cheaper options, and can take down more then you think if you find the right target and know what you are doing ([like soloing a snake in a manticore](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54726687/)). If you have an alt you can even try living out of an orca in a shattered hole. This is largely what we do as a corp (the PvP side at least) and you can find some good videos on the hunting side of things [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSmamC4W_M&amp;list=PLNIvv4lr2qF6396RJaFeZBBf-NoZRk0lXhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSmamC4W_M&amp;list=PLNIvv4lr2qF6396RJaFeZBBf-NoZRk0lX).

&gt;absolutely NOBODY was interested in that game ... really 0 people ... UNLESS you ~~own a PlayStation~~ play EVE Online.

Fixed that for you.

Was more wondering if i should bother reading

Can be done faster for sure, thanks for the feedback. Looking forward to your perfect run video, always nice to learn from the experts.

If you have no idea who the drama is about I don't get how it's juicy, was hoping for context

I wonder how big of a corpse stash is in there..
---
Only part that I disagree with being a bad thing is them ragging on PIRAT, cause I mean who doesnt hate them?
---
Ah, they must of had a galling out. They are all allies in amarr lowsec around gademame last year, i was with a small alliance called Space.Ghosts then, and we absolutely mopped the floor with final, pantsu ARMY alliance, and a few others that got roped in along the way. We kicked them out and they left to go to rancer, looks like that didnt go according to plan either
---
I'm surprised at iceland being one of the best things in the world.  My impression was "wow, so this is what a country looks like after experiencing both natural and man made catastrophes. "
---
I really hope you never do marketing for a game or...anything. Why would you *not* make the rewards end heavy? If the whole point is to get people to boot up the game, you would want them to do it for *the longest amount you can*. Putting the rewards at the front simply encourages logging in, say, 4/16 times. Putting the rewards evenly throughout doesn't encourage logging in all 16 times. It's not a big deal if you miss a day, because you only miss 1/16th of the prize instead of, say, 1/10th of the prize due to the last day being the biggest or whatever.
---
Jesus christ I'm glad CCP never listens to this sub.
---
Brainwashed goons are exactly like brainwashed liberals....
---
Yeah, because you get rewarded for completing the whole thing. Why is this so hard for people to grasp lol.
---
CCP gives away free shit and people *still* manage to complain, absolutely incredible.
---
Bugger. Oh well
---
Kinda like to mention SuperTwinkey69 back in the Tri glory days.  Mental as fuck but he could see things so quickly in fights and adjust and still call 3 targets constantly.
---
How was it not clear when the event would end? It literally said it in the rewards screen every fucking time you logged in. 
---
The company owes you nothing beyond what they advertise when you hand over your cash. A bunch of people in this thread are "threatening to quit", but we all know you'll be logging back in tomorrow and spinning up your 10 rorq accounts.
---
Shouldn't get upset when people tell you what you're doing wrong after making a guide on how to do it.
---
1: Split cap guns to reduce overkill and improve consistency.
---
2: Smartbomb as you land, kill sentries with optimal range script, Avengers after.
---
3: Finish last Avenger during cruiser wave so your cap gun isn't idle.
---
4: Web is much better than Grappler. Needs to be ~16k.

5: Drop = huge boost.

True. That one isn't so much them trash talking PIRAT, because everyone does, but claiming they are going to fight them is funny.
---
&gt;How difficult would it be for CCP to add a few simplistic RTS type mechanics surrounding Marines and Planetary Interactions?
---
Honest answer based on CCP's past performance, we're talking about 18-24 months
---
This is a thread about FCs not temper tantrum throwing children who wet the bed like MP2008
---
I can't ever remember hearing of it being patched out, but I've never tested it myself - it's just something I remembered people talking about back in the day.
---
I know, don’t worry about it.
---
I managed to get it done while being on a business trip in China and flights there and back to Europe so it was fairly easy event
---
It sucks to miss out. The only fault if even is not to more clearly communicate the timeframe.
---
They should just attach eve-time time stamps to next events
---
But it's not free
---
Gosh you are so right and it hurts
---
I download and try them every once in a while on my android. They just sit there taking up space until I remember to delete them..
---
I never said EVE is perfect. That was kind of the point of saying CCP are still working on it.
---
But it’s a product. You can use it. QED: people are using it and doing fantastic things with it.
---
I’ve been there 11 years. If I had to type everything that’s wrong with it I’d be typing for a week just to scratch the surface. But that’s not the point,, the point is that it’s there.
---
I’m going to believe straight away that the Star Citizen community is fantastic. I hadn’t said a thing about them so far. But the thing is: there is a community but there’s no game.
---
There’s no game after *8 years* and a *QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS*. I said why I think it’s the wrong way to go about it.
---
I also said, as I have before, that I don’t ‘hate’ Star Citizen or want it to fail. It’s that there’s no game there and it’s definitely not for a lack of funds. I don’t know what CCP’s budget for EVE was, I’m going to say it wasn’t $250 million Dollars. Not even close. But they put something out anyway. Result: 16 years of history, of people finding this crazy place, of doing things in there, in building stories. 16 years of art work, of it being the art work, of books, songs, movies, lore, Fanfests, cosplay, drinking way too much fucking beer, building friendships, rock star devs, and on and on and and on.
---
Because it was released.
---
In Star Citizen,after 8 years and $250 million Dollars you get to test basic game loops. Come the fuck on already.
---
Did you look at who the CEO of that corp is?
---
mark ever came back to the game?
---
Hi friend. Please take this to the sticky "No stupid questions" thread :) It's designed for small one off stuff like this, and automod won't bother you.
---
That strict time slot is a stupid idea. Expressing my opinion is my right and fuck yeah, after playing for almost 15 years with 4 accounts, I'd like a personal response and got one. But that's between me and the GM. Eve needs retention to work, you don't piss your player base off with stupid reward systems. We arnt children, the demographic of Eve players shows majority adults.forcing us to log on to grab a reward is not something we should encourage at all.
---
Haven't seen any significant panfam loses to this "invasion" but plently of dead supers/titans/rorqs in Delve. Who's supposed to be losing again?
---
To be fair, the goon never complained they had low standards, they embraced it.
---
That was a well put post.
---
I love your obsession with brackets lol, its like your inner monologue as you are writing.
---
What CCP have done, and that was the point, is to constantly iterate to make the game better.
---
It is a far better interface than when I started. It looks unbelievably much better. The CCP art team are amazing. They make beautiful things. I’ve seen nothing but a string of improvements.
---
The reason why CCP catches so much flak is that they very often don’t seem to understand the universe they are building. They could do so very much more with what they have.
---
What gets me is the near-constant stream of people posting in this sub about ‘I’m a returning EVE player’. It keeps pulling people back in. And the reason is simple: there’s nothing out there that comes close to EVE.
---
4 years in space is fairly impressive dirt wise. Good thing my keepstar has spaceship washers.
---
This was group 1, with then CCP Punkturis [in the picture], April 2017.
---
Lucky for NC. they can take from the goon playbook and claim the losses don't matter because the structures were too dumb to redeploy during war time.
---
FC: “**DO NOT BUMP THE FUCKING TITAN!!!*”

That is an astute observation. It really is.
---
Those janitors work so fast.
---
That’s how you know it’s a fantastic country. It went through all that and it still delivers.
---
It’s a personal appreciation. There is no requirement, need, or desire that it should be shared with anyone. That’s just how I feel.

I mean, I feel the article does a really good job at providing context. Have you read it yet?
---
EVERYTHING I see indicates Nova is still in production, and we will likely know more within the next few months. There is a very good reason that CCP is tying the Nova starting plot back in with this Triglavian invasion. CCP Devs have clarified the project is not canceled. 
---
The issue was the framing of the origonal Project Nova did not work the way they wanted. Turns out fighting on the outside of a ship didn't nail it like one would think. Either way, Sansha boarding parties _is_ on the rise, and Case Green Magic, and Case Red Gamma are now under the single CONCORD umbrella of AEGIS. This has all happened in the last two months. They are starting the engines back up.
---
My problem is that CCP sends me a marketing email making me aware of the event on 4th May after DT. Dick move as it gave me only 15 days to participate in the event. 
---
For the haters; I’m keeping my subs going to support CCP, but haven’t been able to play a lot recently due to a job change. I went through the trouble of logging on every day for this event, and feel massively screwed over by their ridiculous handling of this issue.
---
Ok
---
You pay for SUBSCRIPTION
---
attached to subscription for 2 WEEKS is a FREE ITEM
---
after TWO WEEKS is over, you no longer get ADDITIONAL FREE ITEM but you still have SUBSCRIPTION.
---
have you seen how upset and disappointed people have been in the help channels over 14/16, 15/16 ect?  Over thinking they could log in on monday and get it, not just monday before downtime?  The newer player is confused, upset, and angry.  I have seen many people say:  "i returned to eve due to this promotion, what now"?  how are those people going to react?  Eve can be harsh, yes, but this was a little over the top.  The skill farmers with 60 accounts arent going to miss a day.  its the casual with 12m sp and has started and quit eve twice.  the new player with 3m sp.  to them this was huge.  not a rounding error like it is to some of us.
---
I got all of them, 16/16 through the 16th day - but I can still pity the others.  the slightly more casual.
---
This event was poorly designed.  Also all you had to do was login the account.  not log in and play the game.  just go to the loading game.  hardly "engaging" gameplay.  it was a reward for subscribing, nothing more - and a lot of people are unhappy about missing out on it
---
I agree, Eve is the most unique game I have ever played and I love it, kind of disappointed that I didn’t get into it when I first tried it some time back during its peak days, but I’m still hoping for the best..
---
Now you seem to be a vet and very familiar with the game and CCP, so I wanted to ask you for your opinion. Where do you think the game is heading, and do you think it could come back to life as it used to be? Since I suppose you might be familiar with how CCP works and their goals..
---
The reason I have hope is, I used to play runescape back in mid-late 2000s, they basically ruined the game around 2012 and it went downhill from there and started losing a lot of players. Eventually they got their act together, started listening to the community and gave them what they wanted, now on average they have anywhere from 50k players online up to 100k during peak times, I know Eve is very niche compared to Runescape, but I’m just using it as an example..
---
inb4 scooter has shares...
---
to be fair, there was at least a big change in mechanics that really made holding vast areas of space... untenable... besides... now we got delve...
---
I knew that, but does the casual?  does the average high-sec player?
---
In the rewards screen it said there was 1 day left of the event and when I logged on the next day to my surprise it was over. So your full of shit.
---
Yay! Getting rid of the parasites at last!
---
just a bit of dark hearted joke.  The people there were great.  The hundreds of kilometers of flat featureless rock raised my eyebrow.
---
coherence doesnt matter when you 1 shot everything but surpressors
---
There is that.
---
Harpa is actually a reflection of that: black rock on the outside, the red hot lava on the inside.
---
And the norther lights in the windows.
---
Christ! /u/ccp_falcon show this to some !
---
How do you know if wasn't stolen?
---
I'm just glad it is still being called nullsex after all these years.
---
Until they deploy anyway. Then, it’s “thanks for killing the retards”
---
Delve, Impass, and a couple others are really good. There aren't more wars over them because the really strong alliances/coalitions already have the best territory they're likely to get, so there's no upside in trying to evict anyone. The last people to get evicted were Shadow of xXDEATHXx, who had great botting space and no ability to hold it.
---
Also, there's just too much space in New Eden. Even Goons haven't exhausted Delve and aren't close to doing it. When a something like a quarter of the game's players can fit in something like a 30th of its space, the need to expand just isn't there. Also, you want to use the least space possible the most intensely you can so you can cover everything with your super umbrella.
---
Put simply, the strong have the space they want, the weak have the space that's left, and there's not much incentive for the strong to take it from them.
---
Its why I quit. Haven't logged in since Spring 2018 I think. The game going to shit also helps me not come back.
---
I used to play around 15 to 21 hours a week but id also be theory crafting on pyfa in class or optimizing PI schemes in the uni libriary. 
---
For two years i ate,breathed, and slept EVE. Id do it all again if the game was in a better state and I had my degree and a job. 
---
 It had been the best game that ever was.
---
CCP removed all reason to actually invade someone, wars today are just because they can. Type of rats matter in some degree
---
Frustrated penis ✌️
---
PanFam is really digging hard for that propaganda arnt they.
---
pretty sure anyone other than you would be better to get tips from.
---
I think enough was made on EveningGames to afford a VNI.
---
Good.  At this point I hope CCP fails enough that they sell off the WoD IP and refocus on making something decent.
---
Most regions are as good as any other and invading someone requires soul-killing levels of alarm clocking and grinding.
---
So, no real reason to invade and doing it is horrible, thus not much overall territory swapping hands.
---
Thank you for the kind words.
---
The thing is that I read so many people coming back to EVE. That means they’re looking for something. Something that other games don’t / can’t / won’t deliver.
---
In EVE a lot of it is there. What I think is missing is a hook, a deeper connection. It has to be in the story. We’re supposed to be the elite in EVE, we don’t have a house.
---
What if we had a house in EVE. What if everything in the house was provided, by players, through interaction with the universe [just like the real one!] and that these interactions had all the dangers associated with EVE.
---
What if we built co-dependencies between Alpha clones and Omega clones. One seeking the other.
---
What if we had sources of amazement that could be reached, at the peril of suffering the damage that EVE inflicts on us?
---
What if all these resources were available to do something more than just have more resources to build ships and resource harvesting materials. 
---
What if it was made easier to tell EVE’s story from within.
---
It’s an entire universe, that means you can give it everything it needs for it to be a spectacle of miracles, inane drudgery [for such is life] and great political upheaval [as there is now].
---
You have to balance a software company’s resources, desires and plans to make an environment, to make money [always essential] and the player’s willingness to engage.
---
I’ve said for years that CCP could make money hand over fist if they used their fantastic environment the right way. I honestly don’t know how people can make this kind of universe and then not find a way to sell parts of it that don’t mean you get to ‘pay to win’ [which I am vehemently against].
---
I think CCP wants me to work for them to help them make that reality come true. The sad thing is that I’m a few skill sets short of a good resume ;-).
---
You sweet summer child.
---
The north has more npc sotiyo spawns, I only know that b/c stainguy keeps bitching about it, though. For the rest I don’t think there’s much difference, except Serpentis rats suck for VNI ratting
---
Yeah the real, last incursion I farmed I must’ve made 3 billion in a day
---
&gt; Life is hard dude.
---
In this case, unnecessarily so and that's entirely my point. If you can't tell the difference between being away for a weekend or business trip over a period of two weeks and not managing to get the rewards for 80 days, I don't know what to tell you.
---
&gt; Just take the free gift you didn't earn, say thank you, and be greatful they gave you anything at all.
---
As I said, I got my rewards, but with how backloaded the rewards have been, I really doubt that people who missed the last day feel grateful for getting a fraction of that and probably would have rather the event hadn't existed at all. It's way easier to see what you lost than what you gained. Not exactly human psychology.
---
&gt; They didn't have to give you anything yet they did don't piss on their leg over it.
---
I simply don't understand it from CCP's POV either. Like, I'm pretty sure one of the aims was to get people back to playing the game. Especially considering how they advertised it. I got an email from them like every day.  
---
And now I wouldn't be surprised if they lost more people because they are pissed off that they didn't receive the reward for the last day than they gained returning players. Adding a couple days or even a week would have cost them absolutely nothing while avoiding to alienate players who couldn't log into EVE for a couple days.
---
&gt;level 4[Butters\_5totch](https://www.reddit.com/user/Butters_5totch/)\-1 points · [8 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bnr8yq/ccp_should_extend_the_daily_rewards_by_one_day/ene56mr/)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I feel that everyone should get these rewards, not just players able to log in during x days. If you are subbed, you get the reward. Should be that simple. CCP advertising is also VERY VERY misleading. It says the logins don't need to be consecutive, which, while technically true is misleading. The first time this ha**ppened I thought they meant as long as you log in during this period**, you'll get the rewards. And thus I did not bother making sure I logged in every day to click my good boy monkey button for logging in. I didn't get the rewards due to misleading marketing. The fact that you think this is about entitlement is kind of sad.
---
I mean, he did think that "log in 16 days" meant "if you log in one day", so he is after all, retarded. right u/butters_5totch?
---
You have any evidence of that?
---
I know there was an RKK dude in PL that did it, 5-6 years ago, but lolRKK...
---
Thanks for taking the time to write that. I mean eventually and hopefully, they will come to the realization that we as a community can grow this game even more, and people like yourself that have been around for years and have a vision could help that happen. I just hope it’s not too late when that happens, honestly it’s an amazing game, it also looks amazing despite it being 16 years old.
---
and u/[Butters\_5totch](https://www.reddit.com/user/Butters_5totch/) will still complain
---
&gt; Lol dude still salty about?
---
Not anymore :)
---
Rorqual piliots that either we dont care about or are too stupid to read pings so no loss really
---
&gt; tightass rules
---
Lmao you had to loog at you loginscreen 16 days, with two days to spare. Its the easiest event ever
---
What’s special about the sotiyos?
---
What were the reasons to invade someone before they removed them? 
---
Sorry just a curious newbro.
---
there's actually an average of 1 molecule per cubic meter in the universe, when you think about the distances you travel with your ship it seems reasonable
---
lmao
---
Sigh.
---
if you're going to make a spreadsheet, at least have it make sense  
---
doing goons, Test, then the rest of eve doesn't make much sense  
---
especially since goons and test are together when it comes to superaps  
---
nice effort making a lisst, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't make much sense
---
:D
---
the reasons would change per update but the main ones were types of rats and what you get from them to the types of asteroid spawns. ETC.
---
So you managed to mess up the rewards acceptance on the last day? How did you manage to not fuck up given fifteen other opportunities?
---
It's a MILLION free xp. That shouldn't just be given to the most casual players.
---
Even still, a casual can log in to a game once a day for sixteen of eighteen days to get the rewards. Sucks to suck.
---
So if I understood correctly, that means there isn’t much difference between the rat drops and same asteroids spawn everywhere? Is that correct?
---
rats are still a thing some rats give better salvage and better data sites. but on the mining aspect no not really.
---
Stupid bees lol we are the biggest power in the game and notice how no entity is willing to fight up rather they hide in stations and farm idiots to stupid to read pings
---
Moon resources. Before the changes certain types of moon goo were region locked.
---
I didn't fuck shit up, the game lied.
---
So, there certainly are activities you can do solo. Exploration, faction warfare, NPSI fleets etc. 
---
But then, *why* do you not want a corp? There are many groups that require literally nothing of you while providing you with infrastructure and content.  
---
Any of the groups for example. PH/TEST/Brave/Karmafleet etc. You will have fleets going out more or less around the clock. If you are there and willing you can join, if not, fine as well.  
---
Depends on what you want to do, of course. If you *want* to roam solo, it's probably not necessarily the best place to go. If you only don't want to have any obligations and want to make your own schedule/EVE not conflicting with your RL, there is really no reason not to join any of them. In my experience it's way easier to get content in PH than as a solo player.
---
the erebus that died in 1dq wasn't bumped, he was just an idiot who undocked and literally drifted all the way out of keepstar tether range
---
there is also a dumbo-tier mass multiplier on triage
---
They drop blueprint copies for pirate titans
---
it's called an interstellar medium
---
forgot to change your flair my guy
---
Faction titan BPCs lol
---
Responded to the wrong comment
---
yeah, but that's not a story the jedi would tell you...
---
They drop faction Titan BPCs which are worth a few hundred bil
---
No
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
There are more reasons to not invade than there are reasons to invade, so maybe more introductions that have reduced the reasons to invade
---
Citadels have made regions cancer to invade because even if you are Goons and have 1k titans it will take weeks to grind all structures. If you're moving you also need to rip down your home citadels and move them, which means lots of time lost before industry is back and a bunch of isk lost on rigs 
---
Even if there are better space somewhere its not worth leaving your already established infrastructure at home 
---
Citadels, especially XL citadels have made super and titan spam get to the point where every war will be 1k vs 1k max tidi battles, titans are casual now. 
---
Citadels introduced asset safety which makes living in null 100% safe at a 15% cost, even with supers. 
---
The new jump gates, and the jump fatigue changes, also makes your home space better than anything else, because you can move around faster than your enemy and you can drop on anything without gaining much fatigue
---
Moon changes fucked up a lot, there are more moons worth something. 
---
Too many people can live in a region nowadays
---
Huh?     
---
Delve is blood raider space.
---
Well of course it wasnt, cpp wanted to boost their login numbers, if you Couldnt participate in that you don't deserve the rewards. It just so happened  to land on the 16th birthday
---
My world is garlands of flowers and music playing in Elysium.
---
why do people suddenly hate him so much? I've been away for a year or 2
---
I don’t think people ever liked him if I’m being honest.
---
I share the sentiment.
---
&gt; it also looks amazing despite it being 16 years old.
---
That’s because they’ve been improving on it for all that time. That’s why it looks gorgeous. You should have seen what asteroids looked like in ’08 :-).
---
I see, thanks for the insight and taking the time to reply.. I think carebears wouldn’t mind this at all, but me personally I would love to have played during the times, where space felt dangerous. 
---
When I started playing a few months back, I was in highsec for about 2-3 weeks and I wanted to pvp and all that good stuff so I jumped straight into null, little did I know null was safer than highsec..
---
Not in New Eden.  
---
The share number of minmatar ships flying around greatly increase rust particle quantities in the space.
---
That sounds good, but I could imagine how rare they are..
---
I’ve seen old pictures here and there, the UI looked like it was something from Doom 1, the ships looked uhh not the best in my opinion.. I’m at least happy they’re keeping it up to date with today’s “standards”
---
Lol you sound mad. Git gud.
---
Number is not brighter. Look at France and the yellow vest movement. Massive movement but average IQ is below 10.
---
With happened to Eve Online: Echoes? Or is this the same thing?
---
Something is wrong with your life. Reevaluate what’s important.

Not upset at all, appreciate the input, and thanks for the additions.

Well CCP is introducing shield slaves (unless they will again troll players).        
---
This will lead to situation where Pirate Nation with shield ships, having shield implants in LP store will be giving Armor drops ....          
---
Adjusting it to the shield version of drops will not be so complicated.
---
Wordscapes. Don't install. It will steal your life.

I need a CSM candidate running on a dual "Remove Fozziesov" and "Injector bonus back to the Lif" platform.
---
&gt;nullsex
---
Thank you, I'm going to start using that now.
---
Holy Moses on a hot plate. You are as horrible as everyone here makes you sound. Amazing.
---
Not exactly sure how that would work in Brave, seeing as how you would have no space had TEST not given it to you (RZR isn't a member of Legacy), but yeah...
---
Why are there small autocannons on his Cynabal?
---
Literally just add a cap to the number of citadels in a system, either a hard cap or a soft cap (reduce EHP by a certain percentage based on the number of citadels in system with exponential reduction) and most of citadel cancer goes away.
---
As for Asset Safety, I've heard too many arguments in favour of keeping it versus getting rid of it. Personally, I love the wormhole mechanic where everything just drops because it means more content and it means that there's actual risk and a reason to defend your shit instead of just letting it go down and not contesting.
---
Give it a year and Goons or someone will figure out a method for farming the fuckers, if they haven't already.
---
Then Moloks will become the next tier of nullsex ass-cancer.
---
Question abot range (Optimal/Accuracy/Effectivnes)
---
So, when it comes down to turrets, you have optimal and accuracy fall off. And I have read on UniWiki and understood this.
---
But.
---
Does it apply same to the ''Medium Energy Neutralizer'? Link to the module; http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=12267
---
So does effectiveness fall off mean as same as accuracy fall off? And if it is true, would that mean that I need to stay 15km+ to avoid being neuted?
---
Thanks.
---
IQ is a meaningless measure.  Read Taleb on this.
---
Any tricks to finding more wormholes to nullsec from highsec? We live near Jita and I feel like I haven't found a NS access WH in days. Are they more likely to spawn in certain types or classes of holes?
---
I love keeping my ships dirty. Gives them a sense of age and a lived-in feel.
---
With the amount of power available to capsuleers, they'd fuckin' better.
---
Probably more of the latter than in most regions of the universe, I'd wager.
---
Um, one flaw in this plan. Ncpl has to undock
---
One thing they've done better than Panfam is to embrace and integrate the krab, which has made them stronger than ever.
---
Probably a bumping fit
---

---
Which is what he's always said when you don't spin and take things out of context.
---
those are some nice flying goalposts, spinning whaling kills to cover their coward flight from the fights home
---
The worst part is he used to be mildly amusing.
---
Glad you went out with a bang. Enjoy life on the other side, mate.
---
They don’t spawn often, they don’t always drop the Titan bpc when they die, and they aren’t always looted by the alliance that killed it. 
---
Faction titans won’t be commonplace for a while.
---
It'll only be the second keepstar to die in m-0
---
What's bad about Serpentis?
---
They don’t redbox you if you’re outside of like 20km. So you’ll just find yourself orbiting a rock with your drones on idle while the rats sit there and watch unless you manually lock up and order drones to attack. 
---
And if you’re going to put in that level of playing the game then there’s better ways to spend time than VNI ratting.
---
Even if you come back you probably won't regret whelping the supers and titans. Those things are a big roadblock to returning.
---
lmao, people petitioned their own laziness?
---
I remember the slasher click. It was called : the little thing that could..... or something like that.
---
do you think CCP designers and devs talk together?
---
Unfortunate that Keepstars can't drop corp
---
If your ship is REALLY dirty, pay a visit to Choonka's Ship-Wash in Ashab: [https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/choonkas-ship-wash/](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/choonkas-ship-wash/)
---
The best thing about this event is all the entitlement salt. This thread alone has brightened my entire day. So many people crying over receiving free stuff. Stomping their feet and having a tantrum like my kids did when they were 4 and I wouldn't let them touch the stove. Every damn one of them think their anger is righteous.
---
It's a good starting point, fits and markup, though i found that 3 dreads are overkill, you can 2 cycle (with drifter) with just two
---
Usable UI? #NotMyEVE
---
hangar
---
spacedirt
---
They'll be commonplace eventually enough, and then CCP will add another layer of power creep.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98558330/
---
I would hope so
---
Does anyone in CCP talk to anyone else?
---
Hanger? I 'ardly know 'er!
---
huh, TIL. Guess that's why all the VNIs there are bots.
---
T3 are king for what you are doing. Carry all refits and stock ammo probes etc in a npc station then play from there. There is one big streamer whose name i forgot but he does this kind of shit in dronelands. but then no npc stations for you.
---
Congrats on winning EVE. Good luck and Bob bless :P
---
A profit you can't use since that would implicate your main account and that would be banned aswell.
---
I find it amusing watching these people lusting after their ships that will require dozens of players and most of those players will be sitting there twiddling their thumbs. Some things will be able to be automated or you can hire NPCs to do them, but certain things need to be done by players. 
---
Overall, for things like turret gunner on a combat ship, or laser operator on a mining ship where I'll actually be doing something, I don't mind not being the pilot. I'd rather not be the turret gunner on a mining ship operating in safe space or something like that where my role on the ship is to sit back and wait.
---
WH leading to and from k-space are quite rare. You should dive into wspace WH and try finding NS systems that way. With WH, quality if find in quantity.
---
Yes, it pretty much follows the same logic as weapons (except neuts can't miss, they just get reduced neut power).
---
Also, remember, it's not before optimal+2x falloff that you get really close to 0% efficiency. At 15k you will still be getting neuted for approximately ~half of the listed value. This should be explained on Eve Uni Wiki too: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Turret_mechanics
---
First, go to NS you will have access to much better isk making activities and fun things to do.
---
Second, you WANT to get killed early in the game. That's the way you will learn how you died and prevent it that way. Fly cheap shit, follow your mates in PvP endeavors, and enjoy the game.
---
Yes because it means new ships will be built and the profit of that goes to Goons that contribute.
---
We live in a world where we have to have balanced news, even if the other side are just weird and wrong.  But would have been good to have another side of the story.. but where is the fun in that!
---
I can not defend any of the post given by aspecialpincone - for all I know it is true (well apart from the RMT thing - I think that is clutching at straws - as offering out of game things for out game money is just Twitch!)  
---
But it would be nice to have Enfield's side, although he might just want to ignore this...  But I'd like to put forward myside, as CEO of a corp who joined FINAL in the past month.  
---
What Enfield is trying to do, is fantastic, an alliance that does not overkill on 100M contracts, but can come together for larger stuff.   And although there is a part in there about PIRAT I don't think the alliance as a whole holds nothing but regard to them,  I mean if you want someone camped in Jita - those are your boys!   And FINAL does not have the numbers to compete in the Merc Market with then...  But I would assume even they know they require some competition, even if it is to keep the prices reasonable.   
---
What I've seen in the alliance is nothing but honour.  Just this week, we returned the isk to a corp for a job we couldn't do.  We tried to get numbers, but we couldn't... it wasn't a defence so it wasn't a problem (the client never lost anything) but we couldn't do it, so it was refunded.    I'll be honest - I've been in lost of corps where - "We tried, so we'll keep this isk",  I don't think this alliance is it.
---
Is Final perfect - oh jeez no!  A lot of things posted is right,  organisation, doctrines, security (although I think it is too much - embrace the spy - never give permissions).   In fact the OP was given the role to create doctrines and fleets,  and I'd like to think I barked up the wrong tree giving him some of our corp doctrines... Now I can see Iron Armarda flying in Praxis fleets for the Alphas very soon!  LOL  
---
But I do think, Enfield is trying to create something good.  Something that might one day become a good merc alliance - think MC before BoB, Noir before ....   Even PIRAT (who I have nothing but respect for - LESHAKs FTW).  I hate blues (left null cause of blues).
---
Is he going to make mistakes, I'm sure,  but what new Alliance CEO won't.  Although the evidence supplied shows a disorganisation, I don't see anything I never seen in Null Sec alliances/corps.   People fall out, "can I get my stuff back", "Nope, its corp asset"...     
---
The one thing I know about EvE is the way to beat your enemy is to demoralise them, and FINAL has had a good kicking, but still I can see hope,  growth will come.  The HQ system maybe make or break for many HS Alliances, but from a grunts point of view, I look forward to it.   
---
We want wars in HIGH SEC... and I'd like to say I hope FINAL will be part of them!
---
Fly some nano navy cruiser (Osprey / Omen), a T3D or a AF like wolf or retribution. Your main target should be VNIs and basically everything you can catch that isn't too strong. You can easily kill ceptors and small response ships and kit away the others.
---
If you wanna see dirt, put purity of the throne skin on an aeon or something. Rorqs are good for that too, especially when you spin up a new alt, and have brand new rorq sitting next to old ones
---
Tons of fucking damage and armor
---
A lot can be said about features and mechanics, but you really can’t fault CCP for not making their universe looking as gorgeous as they do. It is one of their stated goals. I’ve seen it get more gorgeous with every iteration.
---
What I am vehemently opposed to is the way Minmatar ships look. It is absolutely dreadful. They should look like somebody dragged a magnet through a scrap yard, bolted a portapotty and a warp drive to it and then kicked it out of the space dock. Now they look fancy :-(. A missed opportunity. I was in smothering love with how brute and ugly the Hel used to look. That was a ship that said: “You had to go and make enough trouble for me to show up and now I’m going to make you regret it by yanking out your balls through your asshole”. Now it’s all dainty and cute. Utterly disgusting. A dev actually understood my point about that and he agreed.

Yeah, that's cause all Australians are supposed to be on their way to EDU, so CCP region locked it
---
Astero is for 1, 2 and 3/10. 4/10 would take forever if possible. 5/10 - i don't think you've ever done any if you think an astero can do it.
---
Long time ago ... when ppl started playing EVE, they were thrown into the game and ... had to learn it ... basically with no tutorial with pretty much nothing and many of them are still with us ... so they figured everything out either by the help of others or by their own. You started the game, have fun, thats it, nothing more, no fancy UI with "this is how you start". At that time, the game was widely known as pretty much one of the hardest games to get into.
---
Now some years later, many people suddenly expect the DEVs to hold the hands of new players or it seems to many players in general and show them everything the game has to offer and how things work ...
---
There is no "oh shit i messed up, well free stuff gone, know it for the next time" ... but "oh totally CCP's fault, that i didn't know something about the game, but instead of accepting that, i'm gonna open a support ticket and demand free stuff that i am entitled to"
---
Sad ...
---
They allways come crawling back
---
really they made their stand lol
---
Right now, it's hovering around a 250m ISK loss per character, per 30 days.
---
&gt; ships that will require dozens of players
---
On the face of it I can see how that could be realistic. But is that a game? Is that fun? I like in GTA IV / V where there’s enough suspension of actual physics that the interaction is fun.
---
Posit: Star Citizen is released! Yay!!!! Now you have your original supporters, the die hard crews. They waited for this moment for years. They have long since absorbed how these game mechanics work and, I fondly hope, they agree that this is how it’s supposed to go.
---
But
---
Now that it’s out, here comes the wider audience. The utter n00bs, people who have hears about it, who are curious, who want to engage. They get a ship [actually: if you have multiple people in the ship, who owns the ship?] that requires a crew. Either the crew is needed and then they agree to do something, or for some features there’s nothing much to do and that particular player can rub one out waiting for action to occur.
---
The ugly truth is that most online players don’t play well together, they don’t want to and their connection is haphazard, they have to go to school, they’re bored and distracted. Now the success of the mission depends on whether mom will come in to shut down the computer or not...
---
Unless everybody was on their best behaviour, in which case it would work well with the mechanic, I don’t see a lot of success here. The way the game is set up will need for the player to behave in a certain, idealised way. I’m not convinced new players will even care about that.
---
Everything I’ve read about Star Citizen so far looks like a spectacularly expensive way to make an almost operatic scenic failure. And I don’t say that to gloat. I don’t want them to fail. At the same time I don’t see them building for long-term sustained success in the way they set up their environment.
---
If I was an early adopter who dropped hard cash on that experience, I’d be really worried with the direction they’re taking it into.
---
You don't gain dirt from space dumb shit. You get the dirt from sitting in a dusty old station over time.... not space
---
I guess I got spoiled a few times. In a weekend, we had 2 direct NS connections to Delve, one to Tribute, and one to another highly active part of 0.0 I can't recall. Thanks for the tip!
---
No you are quite wrong, nano kiting is fun and engaging for both sides. Defenders just need to GIT GUD and not whine about getting dunked in their kitchen sink shit fit standing fleet. Ive been in BRAVE and know exactly how they operate and let me tell you back in Fade/Cloud ring we would form proper gangs and had great fun vs other nano gangs that would come poke around our space. These days its a far cry from that, they just want to krab and blob like the rest of nullsec.
---
I find it funny that the theran alliance has been just about everywhere in null and every single time they have been kicked out for one reason or another. Maybe if the alliance head would stop talking mad shit on other alliances and demanding rent from just about every major power block in eve while living in low sec....to fill his ego all the Damn time he might have a friend somewhere. But this can't happen since he doesn't care about his people all he wants to be is space famous. Fyi being hated by all of null makes you the wrong kind of space famous and your members suffer for it. I would advise that if your still in this pitiful excuse for an alliance please find a new one that actually understands how this game works
---
Honestly, when they had a closed focus group at Fanfest 2018, we were all saying that a standalone wouldn´t be successful, but that all EvE players would be more interested to use this to access Tranquility. You can do simple Missionrunning with that interface, and clearly do Mining, PI and Market stuff
---
Players shouldn't be responsible for policing the game.
---
Mainly because it simply isn't our job. If someone likes finding bots that's fine but no alliance should have to find people who are willing to look over API data to see if anyone is botting.
---
Secondly, if that's really what is required there's simply something wrong with the way CCP deals with bots. If reports and very obvious metrics (23.5/7 online ratting) are their main way of detecting bots then it will never get fixed.
---
Just look at it from the botter's side. Apparently you can run a VNI on the new alpha accounts.
---
So, I run a bot for enough time to PLEX and then upgrade and have a better VNI bot. I'll settle for that or if detection is really shit I'll eventually upgrade to a better ship.
---
But let's say I just run a shit load of VNIs that I upgrade to omega for better income.
---
They make what? 40m / hour? 30m? So that's either ~54h or 72h to get enough for a PLEX at which point I upgrade to the omega VNI and make 50-60m / hour. 
---
Now let's say CCP does look at online time, so I limit myself to 12 hours a day and let's say I run the regular alpha fit for my entire first month.
---
My first 6 days of income go towards a PLEX so i can start training. My remaining 24 x 12 x 30 = 8.64b ISK are mine to scale up / replace ships / sell. If I manage to get the omega fit for my second month I'll only spend 43h or 3.5d to earn my plex at 50m / hour and make 15.9b for the remaining month.
---
The point here is that CCP either needs to "fix" alphas / ratting or have a way of definitively detecting bots and automatically banning them. 
---
Reports and humans hunting bots simply isn't going to do it. 
---
Of course we don't know what CCP is doing but knowing all this you can see how difficult it would be for alliances to police this shit, how boring it would be and how it could lead to false positives.
---
All those mobile games are usually developed by an external company, with the asistance of CCP
---
As the UI elements are identical of those we saw in the closed focus group at Fanfest 2018, it´s easy to assume that this is EvE Echoes renamed
---
Your mother would be disappointed if she saw you behaving like that.
---
Thank you verybadateve, I understand. It would be half - which is still dangerous I think, but then again - because neutes. are so CPU dependent I don't think he would be able to use them for more than 2 minutes.
---
Space doesn't really matter that much
---
well someone has to keep the goons warm
---
Its than more of an issue in communication, it should have said from May 2 downtime until May 20 downtime. Its still the same 18 windows for 16 rewards in that time period.
---
I luv my mum :(
---
Just found out it's a new hull design too lol
---
Because if it was stolen I'd be staging out of it.
---
Did any of you have to not feed children to buy PLEX for new Tengus?
---
Hangear
---
You sound salty about that.
---
Oh for sure - very good sport.
---
Started lurking on this sub again after like...2 years and I'm reminded of the fun I had exploring. What ship did you use and what's generally recommended for mid-high end nullsec exploration nowadays?
---
It's just better than clicking on second row modules.
---
Thanks for sharing - I hope she's got better.
---
.... True.
---
Any sort of pvp you do as a solo bro will be simply put: solo pvp. Any pvp with a group you'll 95% of the time need a mic and headset.
---
great empathy there.  it required lifestyle and luck factors more than actually bothering to try.  It was also poorly designed as how many people saw "oh, narrow window is past" and didn't bother to resubscribe?  A way to catch up the missing days or a slightly longer window would have been a lot better of a lure.
---
Maybe some people are smug / don't get his fit.  
---
but as the OP I understood what was going on and just thought it was funny as - obviously - did he.
---
Yes. The killmail is *right there.*
---
It's irrelevant in practice.
---
Mindlinks [require Spec V](https://i.imgur.com/myfgwm2.png) to be implanted (Both normal and faction), so it's a bonus ontop of spec V
---
Because the Navitas is one of the most recent re-designs, and the Tristan is an older one, and visible drone bays are a relatively new design element. You'll find that a lot of ships that can use drones don't actually have visible drone bays.
---
The way this reward system was implemented was not done well, stop defending CCP you brown nosed fucking retards - and breath
---
Your point being? The Navitas can use drones, as can its T2 variant.
---
Waiting on the ikitsura for this
---
Well this has been most interesting and entertaining throughout.   
---
Glad that I had a first rank seat to it all unfolding from all sides.
---
Hey mate 
---
Exact same error here, couldn't see anything online / eve status.
---
looking forward to it, have fun :) 
---
courently all seem to be happy...
---
Oh ok cool didnt realize that it was a newer feature.
---
You're doing a whole lot of gender assuming for someone so upset about gender identities.
---
and you somehow missed the entire point of my post, i am confuse as to why command ship 5, gives less of a bonus than having simply a mindlink, the info burst 4 example was merely to show how silly the mindlink boost is  
---
having command ship 1 and a mindlink is stronger than having command ship 5 and no mindlink
---
They have a weird hard-on for huge amounts of rental isk.
---
All of which I am sure is meticulously and transparently accounted for.
---
It doesn't take up too much time to send a text block that's kindly saying to fuck off. Any customer service has that on shortcut. So no worries.
---
Keep up this kind of Chart for multiple War's if possible, also ad one for other alliances; i and iam sure other'seven would support you'r Work with isk or service donations :)
---
There's actually two dirt effects. Dust, and rust (IIRC). Dust from hangar sitting, Rust from flying around.
---
Mindlinks are one hell of a drug?
---
but of you have command 5, why not use a commandship?
---
X doubt

Google "Warp to Me"

They should have the answers you seek.
---
Also Tengu is a hard no, unless it's a support tengu
---
8 years, another number straight from a wormhole?
---
T5 firestorms are a huge PITA with that raw hp bonus. I have completed a couple in a cookie cutter Sac, but I almost ran out of time. Just too much to chew through.
---
I lost it bcs my client crashed, you can downgrade bling invul to cheaper one + add high grades crystals. I did over 200 T5 firestorms in it without loose.
---
Looks like its a problem to most sites, im getting dropped packets to every site except google atm
---
See that's not the point, the point is, why does an implant for 90 mil, do more than a role bonus to 5, it'd be like having a gunnery implant that increased rate of fire by 40% or a shield implant that increased hp by 30%
---
the role bonus should always be stronger than what you by throwing implants at it
---
Yeah, only the largest ships need a crew like that. Most of the multi crew ships are like 3-5 people. 
---
As to who owns the ship, it "belongs" to the owner of the insurance policy but if the owner needs to go offline, they could just hand over control of the ship to another player on the ship, when the group is done they bring it back to station and have it stored and I'm guessing it will either automatically store for the owner or can be handed to the owner even though they're offline basically just going "Store for ___". Alternatively, if the owner doesn't trust the other guys on the crew to keep their ship safe, they could just call off the op and dock up wherever nearby is safe. 
---
There are options for automation or otherwise not relying on players. And even if you're running with some players you could have the automation turned off until you need it because someone needs to leave. If one of the crew needs to leave they can log off in one of the beds on the ship. When the ship is stored their character will be moved to one of the rooms on the station they dock at.
---
There does seem to be a fair amount of thought put into how to deal with players needing to leave suddenly during an operation. As well as there are some options to still be able to play without needing to rely on players, however these methods are supposed to be intentionally worse than a decent player to incentivise getting a living crew.
---
T5 firestorms are the only ones that scare me, a full dps gila still has only minutes left on the clock!
---
The biggest change to incursions was the introduction of the lashak battleship which changed the meta and caused a resurgence of tdf armour incursion fleets that were able to contest and beat wtm and nga shield fleets
---
oxidization in space eh? nope
---
For sure. NCPL must feel shame for how long UnSpoken endure.
---
Well, it is clear that NCPL has not selfrespec so i doubt they feel anything close to that.
---
I mean third row of course
---
Not really i havnt lost anything
---
3 dreads 1 cycles, 2 dreads 2 cycle. Seems like an easy choice to add a single dread for double the ish/hour
---
If he had a Rorqual he could afford a Mach.
---
That is some cool s***
---
so a big fuck you to all the people that actually followed instructions and logged in everyday?
---
This is true.  I hate losing ships.  It's not that I don't undock for it, it's more than I choose to fly when what I think are competent FCs ping, rather than the welpers.  
---
Anyway it's just a question of whether or not it's policy.  If you recruit based upon what KB looks like, that also makes it policy.
---
there is no clip.
---
Pretty sure Mittens is an anti-Trump democrat, if you look at the complete bollocks he frequently RTs on Twitter.
---
&gt;Being hardcore is cool, but my opinion is that I would happily sacrifice that to get more people into wormholes.
---
I don't think making evictions easier is what's gonna lead to more people if anything it's gonna lead to fewer people as people will get deleted, most evictions result in players leaving wormhole space, sure the more hardcore of the wormholes generally will be back but most wormhole corps fail after being evicted once. 
---
&gt; I'm more invested in wormholes as a space where cynos don't work and people can't dogpile you with unlimited numbers 
---
This is already not the case with evictions, allowing the attacker to dead clone if anything will lead to this become less true the main reason the numbers are limited is that the number of people is limited as well not everyone wants to live in wormhole space. 
---
Opening up evictions an especially as a casual thing means basically that groups will be fighting for survival on a monthly basis, now I don't know if you have been in the defense position but generally after something like that happens I take eve breaks because honestly, it means spending way more time then I should on eve.
---
if that would be a monthly thing well honestly I would personally move to highsec because fuck dealing with that shit every month.
---
especially on the chinese market, hence why this is developed by a chinese company
---
whoops, i got it wrong: https://www.eveonline.com/article/dirt-killmarks-dirt-and-destruction-in-new-eden
---
There's one, and it's based only on how old the ship is. Though i swear the dust/rust pair is real...
---
what bothers me more is vengeance having no drone bay, despite ships such as sacrilege, dragoon, missile legion, arbitrator etc. have one. vengeance isn't too strong in its current state and won't be with 2 or 3 light drones added to it anyway.
---
Question about Ancillary Shield Booster.
---
Well, I am just starting the whole PvP. And I have a fit with Ancillary SB.
---
My question is, since I am dependent on the cap booster in my cargo (don't worry, I am using the smallest ones) should I focus on being more tanky or  getting more DPS.
---
I think DPS option is better since I want to be able to kill enemy as quickly as possible since I have limited supply of cap boosters. Is my logical at the point or what am I missing?
---
It all comes down to the low slots. I could fit Damage Control II (tank) or go with 3 Ballistics (dps). 
---
Eh, I ended up with a family member who collapsed and ended up in palliative care so spent the first bit there. Came back, got a couple of days worth of rewards and then back down to help get the funeral organised and attend that.
---
I think I ended up with about 8 days worth of rewards.
---
I'm not saying I should be an exception, just that it was a shit deal.
---
oh yeah, the purity skins are great for that. also the default SOE ship skins look awesome when dirty.
---
is it summer already?
---
Incursions are the same as ever, and the Tengu has been a worthless memeship in incursions ever since the drone change that was like what? 5 years ago?
---
Incursion mechanics didn't change, the fits are still the same, and the Tengu hasn't been viable since the changes to maximum drone assignment count and even before that was mainly a meme because the loki was better in every way at doing dronebunny.
---
I somehow missed too many days with all my alts so never ended up subbing any of them but my main was logged in every day during downtime.
---
protip: Just after downtime is the best time to ~~travel through nullsec~~ get caught by an Australian Sabre pilot
---
Wikipedia.
---
As someone who played back then, this is better. The old system was very much a case of the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. Now it is dependant upon player actions and decisions.
---
Alright i'll admit it, i've not finished a 5/10, due to how long they take i've been chased off them before actually finishing. It's possible that something like i can't break the overseer would happen. And yes it does take a long time, but this isn't for efficiency it was for laying back and relaxing and seeing if i could.
---
At least they’re thinking about it, that’s good.
---
How that translate in the real world...
---
That's just the importance of support skills.
---
I'm not sure if you can 1 cycle in 3 dreads, i'll believe it when i see it.
---
Just to clarify in the context of Tikkirei's guide - he TWO cycles (contrary to what's said in the video name).
---
1 cycling with a drifter is a hell of an optimization, and i'd like to see it recorded somewhere
---
Why not :D
---
Regardless of that, even if Brave had only 1 system I’d be fine with that. Like I said, I didn’t join Brave for test..
---
I really wish you could turn off dirt. Every single time I undock I compulsively hit clean ship.
---
Typically speaking, they're the most far-out (From highsec) regions on the map, because they are the easiest to carebear in without risk. 
---
The best way to see what territories are the most "used" though is to open up EVE's map using f10 and go to the sovereignty indexes. I find the industry one to be more useful. Where you see the largest accumulation of the biggest blue dots are where the big alliances live, which is also typically where the best nullsec regions are.
---
It's awesome how you're spinning so much that you don't get that what you're saying is retarded.
---
Things happen for a reason, why didn't we flip all keepstar already, less red on KB §!!§
---
Yeah I agree as well about the Minmatar ships, they just look like rusty kitchen utensils, I hope eventually they get some changes, the only Minmatar ships I actually like the looks of are the hurricane and the typhoon, I feel like they look like how Minmatar is supposed to look like..
---
My internet is super shite at the moment. In Brisbane.
---
Oh I see, in that case it makes sense. But in the current situation you can’t possibly hurt the big power blocs either, don’t you think that’s almost as bad as the rich/poor example you mentioned?
---
And since it turned out to be true in the end, and we all care deeply about the state of the game, it's only proper to return the favour.
---
^(actually I just like structure grind)
---
Took me 10 years to learn that :)
---
There is no spoon!
---
Also you can still just yolo with http instead of https in the adress/ Or ignore borked certificate; depending on the issue. Both are non-recommended, but hey.
---
I totally was there! Good times bud!
---
no. just as a free to play game with MTX isnt actually free
---
Tbh i don't know what can give this kind of reaction in this post - like CCP stated Sansha will become a fully shield race.         
---
Yet at the same time i am aware that i becoming way to annoying.     
---
Trying to fight this off, but when i see where this game is moving i am getting bit angry.        
---
My worst fear is that i will end up like doomchinchilla
---
Just like the Revenant is commonplace nowadays?
---
You sweet sweet summer child.
---
More like post shitter.. he he. No?
---
But... You'll always know about the rorq changes.
---
So you traveled all that way to bash a structure that doesn't even belong to the enemy your fighting? LOL
---
Wait is that this weekend ?
---
Strenght in numbers little spodbee :)
---
Optus shit the bed
---
Pi revenue would have to be significantly boosted to allow this. It is already an inefficient use of my time. And i have my own 0.0 system...
---
A nice way to go out! Hope you come back in the near future though!
---
Basically only if you have a sub 2 second align or cloak capable ship. Otherwise you'll be pissing money away.
---
HAHA! For every structure killed, another structure that we build and profit off!  check mate goonies, HAHA!
---
Money moons were a reason.
---
Second to that acquiring renter space.
---
Third; Stomping people before they become a threat / and poaching players.
---
because people paid them to do essentially nothing
---
the overwhelming majority of players in ncpl have zero interest in being part of a krab empire. eve is a game they play for fun, they don't find that fun, so they won't do it. not everyone wants to have the safest space, the biggest coalition, the least risk. ncpl may not be the exact inverse of any of those things, but they're a lot closer to the centre of that spectrum than goons
---
maybe they'll help build horde up further, maybe they'll just wait until you get bored and leave and then rent it all out again. as long as they have sufficient income to support their playstyle, i doubt they'll care about whether it's the 'optimal' way to empire build.
---
Most definitely :-)
---
yeah the imperium definitely doesn't hold vast areas of space lmao 5 sov regions
---
Hard cap: Defender will fill the system so the attacker cant anchor a beach head citadel

Then Don't end up like him mate, your shitposts are mildly amusing on a near daily basis.
---
I doubt anybody cares. Including him, and the residents of Delve.
---
there likely small shuttle bays not drone bays
---
&gt;(well apart from the RMT thing - I think that is clutching at straws - as offering out of game things for out game money is just Twitch!)

Focus on the bonus isk per month and bonus isk per ore contract. I could br wrong but that is isk in exchange for money. Big if True
---
I actually really like looking at these. And I make sure I zoom out whenever I undock.
---
Tbh i don't know about rorqual changes as i don't use them.      
---
I used a rorqual to setup a pos ... as some guy in a single ship had hard time to tackle or kill you.    
---
I also used rorqual as JF ... but with oxygen prices and fact that helium is local ark is better and cheaper to move between stations.        
---
I don't mine ... so not care about rorquals much atm.
---
Zarvox or Mr Hyde maybe?
---
You simply are to dense or to stubborn to bring adequate counters to kiters.
---
Just bring something else than hit-approach-atrons and F1-Caracals.
---
A single T1 Celestis can render 2-4 kiters usesless.
---
I just realized that when SC started development Eve Online was half its current age (fine it launched in 2003 and started sooner but I don't know when development started)

Eve is played both via the client and by adding your spin to events on Reddit.

You can also do this in Horde.

Go and ask BRAVE if they dare to enter HY-RWO.

One Citadel/Engineering complex per planet.
---
Exceptions are refineries, remove damage cap, allow repping and make it 1 reinforce timer with maybe a 6h window tops 48 after initial attack  (low power no reinforce; insta kill) on those to be more akin to POS.
---
Not new ideas by any means but i like planets as soft cap the best out of all suggestions so far.

yet they have comments like this

" Rorqual piliots that either we dont care about or are too stupid to read pings so no loss really"

As of now several major internet providers suffer problems with their internet service mate. Funny thing is that some websites can be opened, whereas others fail to load. Same with internet services like Netflix and co. See here:  [https://www.optus.com.au/about/network/service-status](https://www.optus.com.au/about/network/service-status)

I am currently having the same issue in Sydney and it is definitely nothing wrong with your machine or CCP.
---
He was trying to bump a NYX off tether. Got off grid when help arrived. Cloaked. Bragged that he wasn't initially decloaked. Trolled in local. Then got caught. Hubris confirmed.
---
gargantuan if verified
---
It's not a `90m implant`, it's the bonus for training spec 5. You're supposed to always use it.
---
Are you only considering Delve as including the rest makes his killboard red?
---
Thats not useless, thats because of timezones and availability etc.   
---
The same "problems" occur for every alliance. Only a part of the Titans/people you have can show up for a fleet.
---
I actually quite like delve "burning" now, nullsec is dangerous again and its a lot of fun to make isk between fleets when a neut or red passes every 2 minutes. 
---
You don't need to use capitals to make money, there are other tings you can do and easily omega your accounts. Plus your home region is full of solo people ganking VNI's, meaning your home region is full of opportunities for awesome 1v1 or 1v2 fights to be had. 
---
On the war front, heck who cares.. we get to be cool capital logi-bros and use our dreads/supers and titans on a daily basis. We will eventually hit something the North wants to defend, then we will have another fun filled - crash every 10 minutes - tidi laggfest - sluggfest, where some of us will die gloriously. 
---
War isn't that bad, it all depends on how you look at it. 
---
P.S. If you wanna undock capitals, remember your fellow goons will just laugh at you when Marshy drops on you.
---
Long live dangerous nullsec - it's so much more fun.
---
Better to increase fuel costs for citadels based on number in system, and reduce low power citadels to no tether/no timer except for structure, no damage cap.  A better fuel sink making people actually fuel their structures and harder to abuse.
---
That removing asset safety would drive conflict is a common misconception.  On the surface it might seem that way, but in reality, having that much more to risk would even further incentivize big groups to blue each other and turtle up.  Nullsec blocs are big because they are risk-averse, not because they are aggressive.  You would just see the big blocs killing and looting small/medium alliances, forcing them to join coalitions, while the coalitions themselves even further avoided content.  It would make the blue donut even more extreme.
---
&gt; actually I just like structure grind
---
as it is quite similar to Mining?
---
Is that why Snuffed Out is killing caps in Delve right now?
---
Holy shit what a selfish position.
---
Its not like they are going to subtract SP from you
---
WOW the one on th left AWOOOOOGA
---
I have, Conman from Syndicate Enterprises, at that time NC. member, dropped corp with his Avatar-Char "Vaginela" when getting dropped and killed ...
---
how much have you lost to AVRSE?
---
Lmao, dude. You can't be this retarded.
---
Its a event, do the event get rewards. Dont do the event, don't get the rewards. Now fuck off with your entitled victim complexes
---
pod james  into oblivion.
---
Ha jokes on you its totally not our ks anymore 🤪
---
yea, I've had to VPN to get a connecftion
---
What ship is that? I can't recognise it!
---
Weird shit going on today in Australia across private and govt networks. Most Microsoft services are up the shit also. Something similar happened a few months ago (not related to eve). Probably the Russians or Chinese playing shenanigans.
---
We're on reddit it's hard to care beyond the comment section.
---
Since when did the game get balanced around implants, you don't have to train gunnery support skills to 5 to use support skill implants so that's a dumb argument
---
it fly faster too
---
Ah, yes, Conman is not a smart man...
---
It's not Goons fault that cockroach run when they turn the lights on.
---
Hardest MMO on the planet and the only thing players can't do is beat the login-once-per-day-to-get-free-stuff boss.
---
CCP: Ayy boys, here a bunch of free shit if you follow these rules, also in case some random shit happens, here's 18 days to claim 16 days worth of good ass shit. All ya mofuckas gotta do is click the login button once a day. Easy enough?
---
EVE players: Yo what THE FUCK CCP? I didn't follow the instructions and I aint get my shit! GIMME MY SHIT OR I'MA REEEE.
---
CCP: Sorry bud, can't change the rules now. 1. Because fuck you, learn to follow the fuckin rules pleb. 2. Because that would set a dangerous precedent where our rules don't mean anything and you idiots can do whatever the fuck you want.
---
EVE Players: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Dickhead outed in online game. Why not make a news website all about it? A real journalist would go tell his mum.
---
https://youtu.be/3WAOxKOmR90
---
That's for enticing other drones into the back with the promise of sweets.
---
Honestly, it does not matter what you think  
---
A lot of people missed the main reward on a celebratory event, now they are sad and frustrated. Because of a celebratory event. You know, the one where everyone should be happy and just celebrate.
---
You can't lose anyhing if you never had anything of value in the first palce. :P
---
Tribute is a piss-poor region to rent, though. Their lust for Tribute goes back to 2011, anyways.
---
It's not in comparison to ours, mind you. I'm saying that their own recruitment standards have dropped compared to what they were.
---
Lol yeah I guess I forgot that only Goons and their sleeper agents can steal Keepstars.
---
Is this Gevlon?
---
Honestly, it doesn't matter what YOU think, these are the facts. You fucked up, you won't be getting free stuff for no effort. Don't like it? Your loss.
---
Almost everyone is busy laughing at you retards.
---
The event was made to boost daily login numbers, not to celebrate
---
Yeah, I heard that a lot of people quit recently. Sad to see in such a great game.
---
NCdot has been paid for three years to do essentially nothing? IDGI. Do you mean running renters? That can be done without holding a core region for your own members.
---
At what price point?
---
Jesus, savage.
---
There are not. At least no important ones.
---
Damn, over a yeah ago for this leaked information
---
Man, being such a severely self-inflicted victim that you read THAT as spin is quite impressive.
---
I came back to EVE a few days too late, even thou i paid for omega i did not end up getting the 1 million SP rewards. It was really annoying hearing everyone around me being extatic and fantasize about what they will do with the free SP. All i could do was listen to it and be sad that i came back to EVE a few days too late...
---
Event that was supposed to be fun turned into frustration and annoyance for me.
---
Obelisk.
---
You, you were just to retarded to read
---
He was so easy to catch, used is CEO-Main for cynos ...
---
\&gt; in theory
---
\&gt; since 2016
---
You are such a piece of shit for coming here just to bash on people who are already frustrated, making them even more angry.
---
They also clean up the fluids from all corpses brought aboard too! Most under rated livestock.
---
poor little entitled DallMitt :/
---
Almost every weapon system in the game has a cheap implant that does more than spec V. Why does this bother you so much
---
At least I am more or less a decent human being...  
---
Even though I have 1m less SP than you
---
You're really not, you expect the world to adjust to your needs. Thats not how it works.
---
I mean I get it if I was the only one who missed the thing  
---
But you can see here hundreds of people with the same issue  
---
If the event was done well, there wouldnt be people compain--  
---
You know, whatever. Doesnt matter anymore, no point in even trying to write anything, its over
---
Please add this as a mobile RTS of colony/PI installation  vs colony. Allow capsuleers to send down various livestock slaves / janitors /others to improve PI production / efficiency.
---
Frame it similar to Fallout Shelter, and the amount of RTS activity will push the EVE universe sky high.
---
Picture it: EVE mobile RTS players in USTZ stage a planet-side campaign to trash PI structures while CH/AUTZ players conduct orbital bombardments.
---
Add in planet-side defenses and weapons based on EVE's mass / zero velocity / atmospheric obscuration and EVE could easily scale down and explode the drama on a regional / system level.
---
\*stuffs random government-regulated herbs in to a pipe; smokes it\*
---
You can be stupid and win by quantity. Only quality requires intellect
---
&gt;But you can see here hundreds of people
---
lol, show me the numbers.
---
&gt;If the event was done well, there wouldnt be people compain--
---
People have always complained. Even if it was "log in one of these 16 days and get everything" some retard would forget about it and waste GM time complaining 
---
&gt;You know, whatever. Doesnt matter anymore, no point in even trying to write anything, its over
---
Lmao.
---
You're right, it's not the player's JOB to police the game - and that would be completely fine if that's where the statement was left.
---
But it doesn't. It doesn't say, it isn't your job to report bots, this says, "Do not report Goon bots."
---
If you're too blind in your collective ignorance to see how this takes it a step further, regardless of when it was said or when it was leaked, then I'll make it simpler for you to understand: this condones Goon botting behavior (at least at that time). 
---
Rules for thee but not for me.
---
Not everyone wants to socialize, especially people after work, etc. Beauty of Eve is that everyone could find his place in it, a playstyle that suits the best.
---
Yes, being in a corp could be beneficial, but OP explicitly stated he/she does not want to join any entity at all.
---
Question about esi tools.
---
Do we have a third party app to check esi like old api did. Or do we have to code it ourselves?
---
Many thanks in advance.
---
Yes, wrong sock color may spoil social credit score &amp; get you banned from all means of transport for example ...
---
&gt; Star citizen's community is already great
---
That's a big YIKES
---
with ancillary boosters, it's best to think of cap boosters as additional buffer you carry in the cargo. pyfa shows you how much ehp you get from the asb before it runs out. that plus your actual ehp is how much you expect to withstand in a fight.
---
so the answer to this question isn't much different than what it would be for a buffer fit.
---
overall, you want to achieve both the dps and tank numbers you are comfortable with, so damage control is usually more sound. but this doesn't have anything to do with how you tank your ship.
---
It's to make command bursts a big SP sink that requires specializing into. If it weren't the case you could make out your bursts strength skills in just over a week, compared to weapon systems which have ~2 - 3 months of pure damage skills.
---
Like he said, people who don’t read pings are dying :D
---
If idiots die while not on comms, not listening to very basic instructions, or krabbing during a war when we know enemies are hunting in Delve... Well they become good examples
---
The pie chart of sham says otherwise but hey I guess opinions are stronger then facts
---
The typhoon looks like a carrier
---
My reply was about the last bit of the post I was replying to and not about the OP.
---
People should report bots to help CCP develop the automated bot detection and they can't do that without examples. 
---
I was merely explaining why it's a rather pointless endeavour if it requires humans to look into each report or why alliances shouldn't have to track bots down aside from the very obvious large scale bot farms that may exist.
---
I mean, if you get caught after a fleet has been reported on every reasonable medium, you \*do\* kinda deserve to be called stupid.  I'm not describing the people who get caught by spooky guys like Inner Hell, I'm talking about getting bombers dropped on you who have been out on fleet, in region, for an hour.
---
It could be a lot worse; in my Alliance we have one guy who genuinely sits on zkill all day just to paste in kills  to Discord and try to haze people, borne of his own desire for senpai Tau to notice him.
---
Vee had this really clever strategy of only forming if he knew he'd win. Don't get me wrong guy was a good FC but its easy to have a solid win/loss when you never take engagements theres a good chance of losing.
---
Also lmao "50-75 logi", real big brain high akill pvp there.
---
the new Navitas looks sexy AF
---
shame that nice hull is wasted on such a boring ship
---
You said moons, were they different to the current moon mining?
---
Hey, another one taking numbers out of their ass and trying to make it fit their narrative!
---
You have no ground to know how many percent of those bans came from what year, you only know a all 16 years in total . B0t have been owned by multiple entities. It could very well be that 100% of bot bans in B0T were from the NC. days. It could also be that 0% were, we won't know before we get year by year stats.
---
Greater Western Co-prosperity sphere have been renting for far shorter than B0t, but still have a surprisingly high number, considering the number of members they have had.
---
Probably somebody keeps changing the sugar to salt in the office, now everybody is a suspect and nobody is talking to anyone.
---
EvE is Turn based with a 1 tick server session change timer.
---
Goons have never cared about krabs who don't engage with the alliance, no.  No idea why you think they have.
---
The typhoon is a beautiful ship, specially with the head hunter skin 🤤
---
There are some regions that are a bit worse than others (e.g. bad overall security status (meaning worse site spawns etc), close to npc null/low/highsec etc), but generally the differences aren't that big tbh.
---
Had 2 enyos try an kill one of my vnis last night was pritty cute lmfao 10% hull on one 20% armour on the other
---
:[thonking](https://zkillboard.com/character/96672103/):
---
Even better. Still used for bumping though
---
You never truly quit eve you may go on leave but once an eve player allways an eve player every one comes back
---
They still are, essentially. There's a very, very low chance for foreign moongoo to spawn, but, especially for R32s, it's essentially unchanged from before.
---
Ohhh look!
---
We found hypocrisy in Eve Online... Who would've thought &gt;.&gt;
---
You're going to hate me for *that* question, but it's been almost 2 years, what did I miss in null/wh/etc? Just got Incursion2.0 email notification from CCP &gt;_&lt; Thinking about maybe reactivating my accounts
---
Moon mining used to be completely passive. You stick a POS on the moon, install a moon drill, and it would suck out 100 units of technetium or whatever an hour and deposit it into a silo. You'd need to go back to it roughly every month to refuel it and empty the silos. This meant that one person could service a very, very large number of moons, and that holding entire regions solely for their moon content was viable with instantly teleporting supercapital ships (due to no jump fatigue back then.)
---
I would like to hear why we wouldnt call out the handful of shitlers out of our thousands of krabs
---
I know we’re active in the area guys but cmon.... your fleet of 1400 sub/caps can’t deal with a single yolo providence?
---
Wish I could upvote u twice Mate
---
ER is still the land of the free. We're a small alliance comfortably operating independently there.
---
Not new, they did the same last year.
---
Since you've put a category containing around 3.5 billion humans in your best 3 things list, can I be in it too?
---
There can be a will to fight on one side but we all know PIRAT wont take the fight
---
I have found that the gallente Hunter quiver skins also show dirt especially well. I had an atron that looked absolutely disgusting after a couple of fights in low sec
---
Provi is still NRDS
---
A couple of years ago I thought a team turning up to Fanfest wearing the robes of Amarr priests was cool.
---
This lady, dressing as an Amarr noble, takes the cake. I like these particular costumes as they really stand out among all the mercenaries.
---
That "hard cap" shit ain't no joke. If one thinks we wouldn't fill Aridia, Querious, and Fountain with structures up to the cap to deny a beach head, I'd have to question their knowledge of our nature.
---
Providence is NRDS.  Whether you're red or not depends upon your corp and personal history.  There used to be a kos-checker you could use to see.  IDK if that's still the case.  I haven't been there for a while.
---
This is so true, i remember competing in a national tournament for command and conquer when my mom did that.
---
I was not pleased putting it nicely.
---
which one is the woman?
---
Come to Stain!
---
UnSpoken leaved. JaG, L A S E R H A W K S too. The only 2 groups that i know from there is Veracruz and Moebius.
---
You are from them?
---
Slyce is moving in there, they are PanFam buddys and, there is the X-Community.  X-Com (best Tag ever XD) was staging too from NCPL, so...
---
Best of luck to you. Hope they let you mind in your own game! EvE need more of you :D
---
groups used to wage war to give thier guys content, and there was usually a clash between groups. literally anything was an excuse for war. and to invade. cos invading meant, killing ships, fleets, and i guess hitting a few structures.
---
nowadays its. shoot at 50 structures. twice, get blueballed all th time until the last one then have your fight, with weakened moral. to gain nothing and the content isnt even that engaging as it just goes to capital so fast.
---
content for guys now is rorqual mining and farming. meaning eves pvp in nullsec has ended.
---
what was your pod in that loss?
---
Surfing on the standing booster glamorex-75's makes farming the right L4s really, really easy.
---
NCPL can only influence if you let them. The oppressed can only be oppressed if they allow themselves to be. As a famous scot once said. They may take our lives but they will never take our freeeedooommm!!
---
Yes I quoted braveheart on reddit :P
---
Never stop not promoting
---
Recon cruisers like the Curse have a bonus so they can’t be detected by d-scan. But can they be scanned by combat scanner probes?
---
IMHO this is incredibly boring. Yes, we get it that an ass load of bombers can wreck capitals. We know. We don't really need to see the same thing over and over.
---
tldr?
---
Southern Dronelands (Etherium Reach and The Spire) are still being contested with several small/minuscule independent alliances operating in both, although this situation will almost certainly end once Goons go home and Panfam/NC. purge both regions to replace these independent alliances with pets and renters.
---
I seeee, thanks for taking the time to explain. Seems like it was a completely broken mechanic imo, I would say it’s a fun idea to have your own station mine and do things for you automatically but in this case it’s a different story I suppose..
---
TSTS for short
---
I mean exactly this happened with POSs during POS sov. Citadel's are a lot tougher than POSs so it will be even more of a pain.
---
All fun and games untill they start dropping capitals on every single subcap you undock. GL with your empty quotes than.
---
The real problem with this was removed with Phoebe patch, nearly instant teleportation/force projection over all of the map. After that the moon distribution was as diverse as it will never get
---
Mel Gibson isn't Scottish fyi.
---
I think he meant that NCPLs standards of only looking for e-lite zkilwarriors leads to low recruitment overall for the coalition.
---
Until that happens ER is still the land of the free. Yes there are several of us smaller guys but we all work on the same ethos. Neutral to each other but still against NCPL. We would all go down guns blazing. Not matter how big or small we are we certainly wouldn't make it easy.... Hell I'm sure goons would even help join the cause just for the fight. I'm sure you've heard from the wife multiple times. It's not the size that matters.....
---
If you have an alt train into a fast warping smartbomb proteus. Warp to zero on main, smartbomb, warp off. Works like a charm.
---
Can put probes on there also.
---
What do you expect when all goons been doing is shoot NPCs
---
Reading that post especially that last sentence makes me wonder if you actually have a subbed account to this game.
---
so your explanation on why no one invades is exactly?
---
Almost. But the powerblocks have been established through years and years of development. If you want to blame anyone, blame CCP for allowing them to boom and grow into such hegemonies. 
---
It is not like it all happened overnight. Far from it actually.
---
You couldn’t even photoshop the requiem logo out...
---
Jajaja. Hope you are right.
---
But i don't matter if you let them or not. If they chose to evict someone, they just have to press the "GTFO button" and place renters all the way. That or face Titans with their "deadly ray of lethal dead" thing.
---
Hope you can live on your own. Stay strong.
---
Well at least I can shit post about one of the biggest coalitions picking on as somebody put it miniscule alliances in new Eden. I would take it as a compliment to have that much attention from them.
---
Says the guys using a renter model for income thats about 3 years out of date legecy have realised this so have goons renting encorages botting
---
Literally unplayable
---
Ad absolutely no chance for the weak to ever overpower thwe strong.
---
 Just as real life.
---
Maybe it is too hard to reach ...
---
Scott the man!
---
Like I get that, but playing Eve completely solo is like living in a big city without knowing a single person. You go about your business and see all these groups of people working towards their own objectives and it's super lonely.
---
I can guarantee a majority of corps will accept someone who says they're not the most social person and that they'll just occasionally join comms or whatever.
---
My point isn't that you need to be this social butterfly to enjoy the game, but just realize that the most fun in Eve is had as a group, accomplishing some kind of objective. 
---
Even the best soloers in Eve are members of corps and sometimes fleet up with them.
---
Wait, did NCPL actually attack ER before Unspoken started hitting their renters? It seemed like panfam pretty much ignored ER after their local proxy group (Prothean) died...
---
Apply the NC. Tactic of not undocking. Works quite well.
---
It did happen, but only in very specific circumstances, which usually coincided with an invasion. Or those three systems in Solitude that used to act as a chokepoint for supercapital travel to and from the galactic southwest. The difference with citadels is the maintenance timer. Citadels have no limit to the size of their fuel bay. I can jump an entire JF full of fuel into an asshouse, which will run its clone bay for 26 months. A POS could only manage about a month before someone had to fuel it.
---
Should I go for kind of cloak or just warp in and hope they're not warping off before I reach them?
---
Clean the spiders out of your router mate.
---
To be fair to PIRAT, they absolutely will take the fight if it happens that the fight takes place on the jita 4-4 undock while having a crushing numerical advantage in PIWATs favor.
---
If you would like to donate isk and ships, I would greatly appreciate the gesture.
---
I haven’t heard from the wife for years so obviously size did matter 😜
---
So because you don't understand time zones or the fact that every other event ever operates on downtime resets it's CCPs fault? If you're such a fan of the game then I figure you'd understand their standard operating procedures by now.
---
Man I totally agree. All of us even medium sized alliances would suffer under the GTFO button. 200 people can't fight 20000. But you know what at least we can say we tried we fought and we had a hell of a time doing it too. I'm imagining the headlines on reddit now. This has been the best time of my 4 years of playing eve. Balls against the wall and a FU to the big alliances. Been in goons and got rich. Still didn't have that much fun. Been in pretty much every play type in eve and nothing comes close to this. Maybe some of you guys should try to play eve the fun way sometime too. Highly recommended for content and satisfactory gameplay.
---
Well it sure as hell isn't because "eve's pvp in nullsec has ended"  
---
There's dozens of people in this thread telling it exactly like it is: citadels and fozziesov make it incredibly time consuming and boring, to the point of wondering if giving up sov and living out of NPC stations or a wormhole is more fun than the current mechanics.
---
"I bought a PS3 for Dust!"
---
\- essentially nobody
---
I still wonder what made CCP think they would actually get a successful game in an oversaturated market, exclusively on a console they haven't published on before...
---
Pure Blind has a lot of small alliances and small gang content.  Syndicate has less content and is not as busy as in its halcyon days but is still fairly neutral.  With Placid a pretty busy lowsec between the two, you've got a good little area to work with.
---
Blame the LNP for there shitty mxed roll out of the NBN
---
Exactly. The real lesson CCP needs to learn from this isn't that half their playerbase is "too lazy to log in" or that the other half is committed enough to log in and then immediately close, but that an event meant to bring players in and build hype turned into a dumpster fire, which CCP continued to fuel with crappy community response.  
---
No matter what you think about all the pissed off people, CCP fucked up big time.
---
186 goons vs Penif. Guessing he just decided to let you have this one to be nice.
---
You cant.  He would just respawn instantly in another Invincible Stabber the moment his pod began taking damage.
---
Bow to him.
---
William Wallace his character was.
---
And he was famous. Check it out
---
Flying cloaky means flying more expensive. Sure you can but could leads you to expensive losses. It's up to you.
---
Hehe
---
Well yeah but the quote isn't Wallace, it's Gibson playing Wallace. 😂
---
Yes, they can still be probed
---
Dust 515 here we come
---
High grades crystals set except last one ( most expensive )
---
Yes there still is a kos checker
---
One of my buddies is from Etherium. But with arrive of NCPL, they are pretty much leaving the place.
---
I was very close to move with them. It was cool fly around there. That is why i understand what you say and, why is he so sad to leave.
---
Any place with an NPC station that isn't disgustingly hard to JF stuff to can be a "true neutral region"!
---
In most of sov null, moons were owned and operated at the alliance/coalition level, and funded SRP/structures/other alliance level costs.  Uneven distribution of moons meant people would go to war over capturing r64 moons, because more moons = more SRP = more pilots in your fleets to win fights.
---
I would guess that the average player in pretty any null alliance never interacted with the moon mining mechanics
---
Someone posted a video a few days back  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmvcfx/rememeber\_this\_guy\_i\_have\_dejavu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmvcfx/rememeber_this_guy_i_have_dejavu/)  and about two seconds after "Salty McTengu" spoke I was like "OMFG that's Enfield!!!".  I had seen this particular video in the past and honestly thought CCP had banned him for all the DDOS smack talk or something.  However I have only met Enfield/Salty McTengu recently.  Afterwards  I did a little research and consulted some other Eve players about it and I think their jaws dropped also.  But the BS meter popped a long time before that with this guy.  He has been an a PITA to deal with and I basically quit playing Eve on the character within F. U. Alliance.  I only participated in a few "contracts", but the process of "payouts" changed so much that Enfield sounded like a snake oil salesman.    I am honestly sad for him, he has some dramatic life changes recently but still dedicates a lot of time on this game.  He even says in the wingspan  video "Eve is more than a game".  Enfield, it's just a game. 
---
Enfield, if you read this, please focus on your family.  One day you will look back on this period and be filled with regret.  Summer is coming.  Take your kids to the beach, go camping, Make memories with your family.  Best wishes on the rest of your life.
---
I love this idea BUT it should be balanced with higher profit from PI.  Higher risk, higher reward
---
I logged in all 4 of my subbed accounts and redeemed all the items, but for some reason only 2 accounts got the 1 million SP reward, and 2 didn't. Really weird.
---
Oh... oh dear.

&amp;nbsp;

See you in 2 years
---
Navitas used to be a miner drone frigate ...
---
They are under no obligation to give you guys any content, enjoy bashing the neutral structure that belongs to nobody and replacing all that fuel you wasted to get there.
---
CR10s is a way better deal.
---
If you aren't in a super blinky Gila then probably try other filaments
---
Ishtar might work but I never risked one
---
T5 Firestorm is cheap AF for a reason
---
My understanding is Unspoken and/or Hawks attacked and took sov in C6C-K9 on the border of Spire and ER.  In response NCPL hit a faction citadel in ER.
---
If someone hit unspoken /hawks sov or structures beforehand it was most likely some random BOT nut upset as losing a rorq or something.  I seriously can't believe NCPL would start a war without being in place ready to fight and I doubt BOT leadership is stupid enough to start a war which risks NC's rental without their agreement.
---
Shame it turned out the way it did, having Unspoken &amp; Hawks helped provide content, was certainly nice to catch their supers on occasion.  However they ultimately kicked the bear in the nuts, they can't exactly say they didn't know NC would react, especially once goons arrived.
---
Why would one steal a ks save for money?  And who would pay more than goons?
---
Similar issue for me - I didn't get the 1 million reward on 2 of my subbed accounts but did get it on my other 2.
---
lolwut
---
Wait for Structure Bash fleet, transfer Structure to Test.
---
Perhaps not as new as I think but this is the first I have seen of any of these.
---
If they dont engage with the alliance are they really part  the alliance?
---
I found dickbutt!!!
---
yay, a mobile mining simulator \o/
---
Now you can mine your spod on the go
---
Except ncpl have shown nothing but risk adverse behavior over the years.
---
Right, but init is 1 1/2.
---
CCP just changed those dev ammo's item description for faction gun alterations
---
And fixed some decade-long typos
---
In space, nobody can ~~hear~~ make you ~~scream~~ clean.
---
sorry, if you cannot replace my 'bad' explanation with anything more intelligent than your own view on the subject or anything more than 'what i said was dumb'
---
then your view is worthless to me.
---
please do give your view and we can compare ideas and opinions!
---
what you say above about fozzie sov and structures is explaining why. whereas my original comment was stating whats happening because of it. your arguing my statement from the wrong angle here.
---
As people have pointed out, there is dust and particles in space.   Also, ionizing radiation and other factors cause materials to degrade in space so the ships themselves would generate rust, dirt, and debris over time.
---
It is my understanding that Lazerhawks reinforced a Sotiyo in The Spire to provoke a fight with Order66 BOT Police but when they didn’t show to fight on the final timer Lazerhawks and Unspoken killed it. This event was the reason NC. decided the nearby pesky neutrals had to go.
---
2/10 trying to hard to be cool
---
ishtar works fine
---
i'm more than sure it's a REQ structure though
---
Good for him

Well fuck. That's not nearly as exciting
---
Its much higher inside solar systems. That 1 atom/m3 figure comes from the vast expanse between galaxies, which we dont get to visit ingame.
---
And used to have a bonus to cargo size.
---
Info plz
---
There are really new ammo types, for example there were Quake S and Tremor S, and now there is Shock S, and so on.
---
Not For a wormholer. :P
---
I apologize my phone doesn't know the word and tries to auto-correct made up names. I will edit it for you so that you aren't triggered.
---
So you are telling me that you don't fill your daily chain scanning duty of at least 250 systems then...
---
Doth mother know...you weareth her drapes?
---
Transfer it to goons, so we can be elite pvpers too
---
no 7-10 implants that are worth?
---
I think you reddited incorrectly.
---
good lord this hurts to read. So here's the thing, you can rebind those keys to more sane ones, and the modules don't need to be on their "row" hotkey wise(you can just move them once undocked and arrange the way you want). At least this way you'll keep the rsi away, until you start manually piloting that is
---
CCP is fucking retarded.
---
Replace "evicting us" with "killing anything in Delve" and isn't this the Goon motto?
---
Thing is if they will leave it alone now. Because i saw a few Panham ihub up there.
---
Yes.
---
What do we know about Invasions so far? From the description that I see on updates.eveonline.com they could be anything, from something as small as one of the recent EVE events, to something as large and innovative as the introduction of Triglavian space.
---
Do we know anything more than what is written there?
---
Except on the 2nd gen. I went through 2 of the damn rear window relays on mine, which was really annoying since you needed to roll it down to open the tailgate.
---
1) my shit is in asset safety, haven't logged on in over a year at this point. They said it in War Games "The only winning move is not to play"
---
2) The reason I don't play is cause its N+1. NCPL back when I was with them was good at taking the fights we had a chance at, and good at not taking the ones we didn't. Now goons so overwhelm everyone that what's the point? Brave,BoT,INIT,Literally Triggered, Ranger Regiment, and NC combined are still 3300 members smaller then you. If the game ever gets to where quality can beat quantity, I'm sure we will play again :P
---
Out of curiosity, when did goons show up, and when did the PH supers show up in large numbers?
---
Look at dotlan. Huge region, plenty of space to live in and plenty of things to shoot around.       
---
NPC stations let you do whatever you want and whenever you want.      
---
You can make decent income (super ratting level) running lvl 4 missions for Sansha Nation.
---
Is PGL still around? He’s been quiet for a while.
---
But this is CCP fault and only CCP can fix it.
---
It is for people who min/max their fits.  You lose the damage bonus with t2 specialization but have more flexibility in what you could output.  Not all t2 ammo/missiles are better than faction counterparts but it at least opens up some new options.
---
Message him ask if he needs scouts or probers. If he's hunting rorqs he probably wants both.
---
Its required to be good at both of those things though
---
Is this Gila capable of doing all t5 sites or did you just do firestorm with it?
---
Sounds like Australia's connection to the world is acting up today.
---
The sites that load quickly are probably cached on servers physically within Australia.
---
That model by the way is only working, if enough people that do not like hours of steady grinding for ISK for an ISK/hr far lower than their RL-ISK/hr put RL-Money into PLEX and sell them ingame for ISK. If this supply declines, PLEX prices are rising and PLEX-subbed Multiboxers start to cry on reddit.
---
That is the current problem with the economic balance, as CCP is pissing off the 2nd group of players very hard.
---
Do you watch letterkenny by chance?
---
Well Wonderboy, you're clearly fucking retarded to be going ahead with this. You just took a shotgun to the face of the exploration profession. 
---
Well done you bloody idiots, I mean do you gusy even play your own game ???
---
This
---
Is there any possibility for any time zone to log on on the 19th and get the reward and also log in on the 20th an get the log in reward?
---
They dident actually call out "to downtime on the 20th" although most experienced players would understand that. The communication was saying "run through until May 20th!"
---
So the closest keepstar from you is the Requim one?
---
Well
---
No, I was the titan.... those buttons were close to eachother. Luckily it was just freighters randomly getting to chill in a quiet system :P
---
Except mining doesn’t have a damage cap
---
yeah. Its just not that easy to get to.
---
With little bit tweaks probably yes, but definetly not darks.
---
So you think is possible, not for krabbing, but not being renter/slave?
---
A place where you can have little bralws with neighbors but not mess each other sov/athanors?
---
And there is no point for me to do other sites bcs firestorm filaments are si cheap
---
You also didn't have 3 timers and a week long structure grind per pos.
---
I can't remember any losses to them and if I have it's been inconsequential.  
---
Believe it or not people can not like people because of who they are not just because they've been personally wrong'd.
---
Some T2 ammo is for faction guns and others are for faction and officer guns...
---
CCP shoul hier someone to proof the changes \*gg\*
---
And also I demand skins for AT ships because why not
---
Is it better than ceptor?
---
Buy it’s while it’s hot!
---
Oh how sweet this would be, diminishing return for Excavators just like for FAX-Reps ... the more excavators chewing on one roch the less mined amount
---
Sure... But lossing an iHub for a small group is something huge.
---
NC can rip hundreds of billons in rigs and don't Even notice.
---
Well, Horde will probably take a couple of constellations that border Kalevala, and Slyce will probably settle in to the rest of the region, but the 1VN-XC constellation might remain pretty free.
---
O.o
---
My lore senses are tingling... Does Amarrian priests actually have blood sacrifices?
---
I do not remember ever reading they sacrificed their minmatar slaves... In fact, I don't think even the blood raiders Sacrifice minmatar people in their blood rituals ô.o (bad blood, not holy enough or something)
---
I love ho all my main characters are still KOS for CVA. It's been 11 years since my corp went there. I'm so damn proud... (manly tear)
---
You keep what you mine in the Imperium. We have buyback programs for other things like salvage and PI. Those typically pay out 90-95% jita buy
---
I'm pretty sure most alliance are running on a "keep what you mine but you're taxed on refining"
---
Yes.  It can be &lt;2s align, warp cloaked, and has ~20k tank for resilience to smartbombs.
---
Much more resistant to smart bombs
---
Titans can no longer deploy fighters. Why do they still have the fighter hangars on their models?
---
Wait that's illegal
---
He posted in the TEST forums a few weeks ago.
---
weekly reminder
---
remove **ISK the guide**, last updated 2013 - most of it is not relevant anymore
---
In most null alliance moon mining it's either free4all or private house
---
Because those moon goo can't be compressed, you basically are forced to use local refine and reaction services and pay your landlord fees
---
Thanks, i have seen a few of them cruising through Delve, so i waws wondering if it is just a way to show off how rich people are or if it gives any substantial improvement.
---
Scots generally respect and remember King Bruce more than that Wallace guy. Mel Gibson notwithstanding.
---
Not gonna happen
---
Thanks, that is why i have seen people using them in Delve. I thought they are just showing off their money. :)
---
&gt;But in the current situation you can’t possibly hurt the big power blocs either
---
You couldn't possibly hurt the big power blocs back then either.
---
if you act as useful idiots for a goon campaign against ncpl renters and then get evicted by ncpl, you can't be shocked or outraged. 
---
sustainable farming of renters requires a little brainpower, which unspoken do not possess, sad!
---
My favorite is the exclusive 50million per month. $5 for 50 million or $20 for 2 billion by doing it legally with plex... :thonking:
---
Clearly he is attempting to make a multi dollar enterprise using in-game BS
---
*popcorn*
---
Is it during AUS timezone? 
---
Otherwise it needs more titans. :)
---
there's a sub for that: /r/ChoosingBeggars
---
And when you get prodded, you lose the implant. You could make the same argument with drugs. Roll a good mindflood booster and bam, now you've got +20% capacitor, for only a few mil! That's way more than capacitor management V
---
Are they actually expensive?
---
Made me chuckle lol
---
Well color me surprised! The guy who said pvp in nullsec has ended disagrees with me!
---
We actually don't.
---
I remember being at one of the eve poker tournaments at Fanfest and some dude was bragging about being #2 or #3 all time on Battleclinic, he was genuinely offended when I didn't give a stuff.
---
Who gives a fuck if your kill board is red or green, as long as you're having fun.
---
That only happens with a few frigates in one or two types of sites.  The BS's and BC's all redbox a VNI.
---
To be honest, I had to look up what does NPSI stand for :] - it sounds like fun. Will try it! Thanks!
---
If I remember correctly, somebody said that before a structure would drop everything it has in it, if it was destroyed.. So let’s say if people united and hit an important structure or a hub, wouldn’t that do some serious damage to them?
---
Well I’m definitely not a TEST line member which is probably the biggest factor in me not knowing whether he’s still around.
---
But normally you don’t go very long on reddit without a boisterous post from him, which we haven’t had in quite a while. Which is why I asked 😁
---
I think the idea is you remain KOS until you've paid back the losses or if not personal KOS, make a new corp and join that, or join a currently not-KOS corp.  Though obviously most nullsec corps and alliances are KOS in provi as they roam and drop there so... IDK.
---
This is happening at a Sixth Empire altar. I don’t know whether this is sanctioned by the man himself.
---
2 minutes is a long time in pvp.
---
You're retarded.
---
Will check. Thx.
---
Not too much actually. :)
---
Evepraisal says about 240M for the hull alone, but i just checked now because you asked, had no idea before and supposed it to be more expensive. 
---
Considering you are very unlikely to get shot down in this baby when you know what you are doing, i would say it is pretty cheap travel for anyone who is not a newbee like me.
---
Oh so he's sensible in at least 1 aspect of his life then.
---
Fuck off will you.  There's a good lad.
---
At first glance it appeared to be a September 11 reference. Something about Avatars crashing into a building or something. Then I just realized it was a dumb play on 9 out of 10.
---
Fuck off Ginger you twat.  There's a good lad.
---
\^
---
Yeah, the farms themselves are about break even, you need the other passive income sources on top to generate any actual profits.
---
Research agents, while tedious to set up, are 30+ mil per month per char, depending on how much initial skilling you are willing to do (for the extra research agents).
---
PI i dont do, but ive heard its a decent source of semi passive income.
---
Every 90 days you can run every epic arc once on all three chars on every account assuming you have the rep for it.  While again, ive never actually done an epic arc, i hear the missions themselves pay out like 6-7 mil for each step in the quest chain.
---
Im sure theres other passive or semi passive income sources as well.
---
As it happens, now is a perfect time to get the rep for the RnD and epic arcs with all these cheap social boosters on the market.
---
Why do they need to give you all day on the last day? If you book a hotel from 5/10 to 5/12 you can't stay in the hotel room until 11:59pm on 5/12 because "I paid for this day". The rules they've set up state the promotion would end on 5/20, which it did.
---
For reference: I was boating in the islands with family for a week and a half of that time. I still managed to get 16/16 with multiple days to spare. Either you figure out what it takes and make the time, or you don't want to/can't...either way, it's not CCP's fault.
---
And no, they shouldn't be individually responding to people hitting them up to give them free stuff...they gave a lot of free stuff away. Granted, the only thing it "costed" them was lost revenue, but they didn't have to do it at all. I'd imagine they received \*thousands\* of complaints about it, considering how many people I saw in random local/discord chats pissed because they had school/family functions/other issues.
---
I hope he continues feeding vindicators and other blingy ships
---
Osmium is also kill
---
Not a single operation happened during the whole time we were deployed in Saranen : confirmed.
---
I mean this is glorious both sides propeganda. When we did this you called us cowards and we called it brilliant strategy. Now your leaders are doing the same and calling it brilliant strategy and we call you cowards. v0v
---
It's super aids to deploy boosh Ravens in wormholes tho...
---
No, they didn't. You don't understand how their time works. They literally gave everyone 432 hours of time to collect rewards in 384 of it. You had a full 18 days of time to collect 16 days of rewards. The issue you're talking about is not understanding when the days begin and end.
---
Either way, they never said "You will have 18 days at 24 hours a piece to collect rewards", they said "it ends on 5/20", which it did. A lot of people in my corp got their rewards on 5/20, which means it's possible.
---
Everybody has things going on in life. The question is "Should those things take priority or should this game?" That's up to you - You had some stuff going on and those things detracted you from being able to get the reward. I'm not sure why you'd think it has anything to do with CCP, or why you should be given an exception. That's literally how life works.
---
Oh it's definitely to show off too. If you don't blindly jump gate to gate, I think an inty would be better in almost any way. I think the yachts make good cloaky eyes. Good for people streaming fights or watching gates for Intel since it can warp cloaked. But yeah, for most practical purposes, I think an inty is more than sufficient
---
In former days Moongoo was refined in Hisec mostly with specialized Chars (NPC-Corp-Standing &amp; Ref Skills) on 50% Stations (with skils and all over 90% yield iirr). That was a stable ISK-Sink also as even with maxxed skills and standing youd have to pay fees to NPC. Today this ISK-Sink has been transformed into passive income for the people maintaining refining structures (Anybody can see the similartity to passive income from mining before Lifeblood?)
---
This is Eve, not your wife.
---
It's consistent with the harsh EVE universe that you need to follow the exact terms of the deal in order to qualify. Why do you keep throwing your sick girl friend under the bus for your lapse? If you quit over this New Eden will be a better place.
---
Actually, I think you are are trolling everybody and doing a great job.
---
And in a year you'll probably forget it even happened. Is this your first 1 year of life?
---
&gt; me personally I would love to have played during the times, where space felt dangerous.
---
Move to Lowsec or live in NPC null. Sov null is not actually any safer than it used to be, it’s just less cancer for sov owners to live there and a different kind of cancer for people attacking them. Before structures people lived in literally indestructible outposts and the only thing with any risk was supers and Titans because they couldn’t be docked.
---
Citadels and Skill injectors made supercap proliferation a thing outside of just a handful of alliances more by making it easier to keep spare accounts active and also removing the requirement to coffin a Supercap pilot more than Rorqual spam or actual skill injection.
---
People who actually were around then are looking through some rise tinted lenses. Especially anyone complaining about the existence of Fatigue, or the newest complaint that there’s too little Fatigue.
---
Everyone knows who it belongs to.
---
To use the old tried and true WW2 analogy - It's a bit like painting over the colours of your battleship with a Swiss flag when you see the Germans appear over the horizon and then claiming no loss as it was a 'neutral ship'. 
---
The Germans know what happened. You know what happened. You might convince some idiots reading the newspaper but who cares.
---
If you want to get it under 2s, you'll have to spend a LOT (relative to an interceptor) on faction inertials.
---
&gt; NCPL influence
---
Does that mean thez still undock there? Maybe we should have attacked ER then. :D
---
There's some info on hoboleaks, text describing the effects of the invasion, some new NPC ship models that will probably be used for the trig invasion. Tbh, it doesn't seem that it will be something super innovative.
---
Imagine being a Trump supporter in 2019 what a piece of human fucking garbage.
---
&gt;If I remember correctly, somebody said that before a structure would drop everything it has in it, if it was destroyed
---
Nope.  POSes dropped what was in them.  As a result, nobody in null stored much of anything in POSes.  Just the input materials to whatever they were building in the POS.
---
Assets were stored in outposts or conquerable stations, which were indestructible.  If they were taken by an enemy that enemy could lock you out from docking, but your assets were still yours and still safe.  You could sell them remotely, or create a courier contract remotely to get them back.
---
Citadels in null with asset safety is actually a pretty faithful reproduction of the old way things worked.....just with a shitload more of them (you couldn't anchor a conquerable station, and outposts were quite expensive so not that many of them were dropped)
---
&gt; So let’s say if people united and hit an important structure or a hub, wouldn’t that do some serious damage to them? 
---
"Coat-hangar" attacks happened, where an enemy would attack a POS that was building a mothership or titan.  It didn't require a massive coalition because you were just hitting one POS.  The cost was the input materials for that titan or mothership.  Which was more painful back then than today, but not really that painful.
---
iHubs either didn't exist yet, or were attacked differently.  You couldn't do a small hit-and-run on it.
---
And the buybacks are optional. Usually privately or corporately owned, but not by the state itself.
---
Typical Goon.  Cannot follow simple instructions.  I told you to fuck off and yet you're still here.
---
*poke*
---
\+1 dankness, -2 stamina
---
Most of the time is 'why are you wasting your game time on mining'
---
well two downboats got the reference. incursion that cockblocked the KLY fight.
---
&gt;Pure Blind has a lot of small alliances and small gang content
---
not for long now
---
Called it
---
Might be small but have deep pockets
---
Oh Sansha Nation fleet is visiting triglavians atm.
---
Typical.... Wait who the fuck are you?
---
Meh.  Typical dumbshit thinking he has any control over anyone.
---
Provi's KOS policy is also character-specific not just corp-specific. Once you're KOS, you're always KOS.
---
My then corp had a disagreement with Sev3rance. We demanded refund for our roamers they shot at while being blue to us, they claimed we shot their allies/fleet while roaming. We decided to cloaky camp their space and locked it down for about a week or so, killing everything and everyone in there.  And AFAIK most our characters have personal KOS due to the cloaky-campling. DMG incurred was... let's say large. The last kill was a titan, killed by Cry Havok, but he whored on it too... I don't think I can repay that. Not like I want to either - as I mentioned, I hadn't been down there for a very, very long time =]
---
Horde does the same thing. Think the buyback is 97% jita buy but i'm not 100% sure since i don't mine.
---
&gt; One Citadel/Engineering complex per planet.
---
This is a bad idea with good intentions.
---
&gt; remove damage cap, allow repping and make it 1 reinforce timer with maybe a 6h window tops 48 after initial attack  (low power no reinforce; insta kill) on those to be more akin to POS.
---
This is a list of bad ideas that were thrown away already and there’s no good intentions here. Can we stop digging through the trash please?
---
&gt; Not new ideas by any means but i like planets as soft cap the best out of all suggestions so far.
---
Planets aren’t a soft cap. Planets are a hard cap. Next you’ll want to throw away entosis in favor of grinding shitty structures and dropping them to claim sovereignty. This was terrible gameplay with POSes and we don’t need to resurrect it just because people can’t figure out how to fix or just don’t like toasting.
---
In an ideal world, where people actively co-operate to get the thing done, a group is an amazing feat. Humans, it’s true everywhere, never shine so brightly as when they do things together in a group [save for inventing things or coming up with, say, the theory of relativity that takes some really deep thinking in a quiet room for a while].
---
In that kind of group, those online games are amazing. But, you’re not going to find that a lot.
---
I’ve did GTA V Online. The campaign mode was AWESOME! Online: people breathing in the mic; shouting in the mic; in a language you don’t understand; expecting things from me that they don’t care to explain; playing music; having fights; eating with their mouths open; talking non-fucking-stop; quitting without saying anything. An endless litany of truly annoying behaviour that takes away my enjoyment of the game.
---
I stopped with GTA V O because I couldn’t stand being in that environment. Oh, and load times that were way too fucking long.
---
Now, imagine if you were tagling a Ritual! lok
---
Oh yeah, big time.
---
I was legit sad when ElitestOps left Waffe way back in the day. They were chill to be on comms with.
---
You actually get the dirt when you're docked up. All that space dust in citadels man. Upwell is getting trashier
---
Giving it all to me. I cannot lose. :D
---
I was hope for a galaxy pack sale :( baited on a free meme.
---
You killed a Titan in Providence?  Really?
---
Sounds like a legit problem...
---
\^\^
---
ROFLMAO
---
FW is something I wanted to try - I never tried it in my history with Eve. Seems pretty straight forward with jump in and jump out option at any time. It actually looks like something crafted  for people like me. Thanks
---
That's not true is it.  I mean that's a "personal KOS".  Most people are KOS by corp or alliance.
---
Guys guys. My. Kill. Death. Ratio.
---
you misspelled waste
---
Well, if you have to mention Amarr cosplay... What about [this](https://imgur.com/wSUgyoY), or [this](https://imgur.com/Zb64vif), or [this](https://imgur.com/Z6gtyPw)?
---
I have quite a number of pictures, some of them are quite dear to my heart.
---
I see, thanks for the info. To me it seems that fights and wars were still way more meaningful back than, rather than now, right now we have like 20 guys in our space that have anchored in total about 60 structures if I remember correctly and we can’t get rid of them.. 
---
But then again I can’t judge either, since I’m a new player and I wasn’t around during the before and after transition..
---
I mean theres a number of ways this event could have been handled to make it less impactful to the player base that missed the final day reward, such as allowing people through the end of the final listed promotion day to claim the final rewards so as not to cause a ton of confusion and upset, or spreading the 1M SP reward out amongst multiple days, so it's not all lumped up at the end. 17 years, 1,700,000 SP, 100,000 SP per day login promotion for 17 days, with smattering of skins and reward items on top.
---
The other thing to keep in mind is that CCP in the past has been more gracious with these rewards because they were free items being given away during the course of a celebration, which is why so many people petitioned it. The final reward was very impactful, and in the past, they've graciously allowed people who missed a thing or two to collect them if they filed a petition.
---
But its easy to just log in man. Why didnt you do it before school *he says sarcasstically*
---
This is half the reason I hate these stupid log in rewards. If your busy or dont hear its running BAM youve missed the best rewards fuck your real life THIS IS EVE MOFO  THIS IS YOUR LIFE!
---
I really hope ccp does away with these event log in rewards. The sp is great but its 100% just another reason to roll a new alt ffs.. They should be based on total log ins now between x and y time. And something about making them even would be nice.. So day 15 isnt 80-90% the rewards worth. Like that 1m sp should have been divided into 250k sets and given that way. Why must you give me fucking trash ccp.. Even more insulting when I have to log in to get it
---
People will definitely mess with sov/athanors in either Pure Blind or Syndicate. If you want uncontested athanors you probably have to join a powerbloc or find a system in NPC null that a bloc hasn't oppressed - which are few and far between.
---
That said, some measure of being active with a few allies and being on good terms with your neighbors and they might leave your infrastructure alone, but you'll have to establish yourself first.
---
That said, power bloc can come in at any time and squish you. It's not some sort of policy over the region. Sometimes it's just a matter of when an eviction happens rather than if, and sometimes people do actually get left alone.
---
I definitely remember the men's costumes in the first two images when I visited Fanfest way back in 2014.
---
There were too many moons per system. A planet occupation sov makes more sense but i didn't even bring that up.
---
Care to explain what your problems with less/easier to kill structures is?
---
Having different opinions is fine though.
---
&gt; My worst fear is that i will end up like doomchinchilla
---
My worst fear is you’ll end up like Naz.
---
It's not for showing off, because showing off 240m really? It's for all of your alts that don't have interceptor skilled up. You can fly this with a lot easier fitting restrictions. I have 30+ yachts for all of my PI characters - one to get them down to where they needed to be with implants in tact and then two - to move them to new systems with said implants as well.
---
You can't fire me, I quit!
---
Unspoken was hitting horde renters in tke.
---
*Tens of thousands
---
You're talking to the \[Navitas Dragon Master Sergeant's Extreme to the Max\]([https://zkillboard.com/ship/592/topalltime/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/592/topalltime/))
---
i don't know why
---
Another real answer, buy up *all* the following you can afford: 
---
1. Sentient damage controls;
---
2. Shadow Serpentis Damage Controls;
---
3. Faction guns/launchers;
---
 
---
The reasons being: the summer patch. In that patch damage controls will become rollable (i.e. people will be able mutate them to form abyssal mods). The moment that happens, there is going to be an almost constant run on the market for the damage controls and I am guessing their prices will at least double. 
---
Similarly, faction guns/launchers are being changed so that, if you have the proper skills, tech 2 ammo can be used in them. When this happens, the prices on all of the faction guns and missile launchers are going to go up considerably as well.
---
Moon mining is generally the most profitable krabbing at any level.
---
Can someone just give me the Tl:Dr of this comment. Im too drunk to read everything
---
&gt;i would say it is pretty cheap travel for anyone who is not a newbee like me.
---
This reminds me of another thing that makes it handy.  It requires very little in the way of skills, so you don't have to worry much about whether that rando highsec alt has interceptors trained or whatever.  
---
Just expect hull+fit to cost in the ballpark of ~500m these days.
---
This list is quite outdated.
---
Well we aint goons tho. So... How would we know you guys talked about that stuff in yo fireside chats? Lol.
---
Cry Havoc killed a titan in Providence in 2009. It was in the constellation we camped, and we sent a cloaky character to whore on it, but it wasn't our kill. It's on zkill, but due to the age - the fitting is gone. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/8087448/
---
Yeah we are. Lol nice of you to notice
---
Do imperium peepz just have like a reddit downvote and shame comment brigade sig or are you guys really that afk in game that all of you are on reddit. Lol
---
Long term?People are currently complaining a lot about vni boots and rorqual bots. Buy what the bots are producing and wait. Eventually ccp will fix the problem and people will be to lazy to do it themselves
---
SYNDICATE.
---
Check it out. There are some important people from the backstabbed alliances.

---
only considering delve as they are the ones trying to be smug.
---
The typical approach is, as mentioned already, let members mine and offer them the services and make the coalition/alliance/corp money through the services (reprocessing/manufacturing/etc).
---
Imperium has a monthly fee they collect from member corps and that's how the alliance makes money.
---
Problem with this is, not everybody alliance has the bot-infrastructure in place, that does these calculations (how much does xy corp owe the alliance) so they set up weird rules like give 15% of all goo to alliance and so on
---
if you want to go big on this you have following options:
---
1. either get yourself a bot that uses membercorp esi tokens to get taxes calculcated -&gt; so alliance makes money
---
2. don't allow membercorps to anchor structures respectively to setup service modules, and have 1 corp to set up all the structures and service modules within the alliance (outdated approach, membercorps will almost always want to have control over some/all of their shit)
---
3. set some weird flat tax like 15% of all goo goes to alliance (super bad approach, you literally have no way to track this except with the mining ledger, and you would need to run after each line member individually that they owe you xy amounts of money/ore/goo/whatever)
---
if I forgot something feel free to add, hope this helps somehow
---
They pay their taxes regardless.
---
I can't even connect to my VPN
---
You really should have told goons to fuck off when they asked you to sovwar against ncpl. They literally are the reason you are in this mess. Fold your alliance and join the imperium or move into wormholes I guess, congrats on getting metagamed and I hope you've learned your lesson.
---
Yeah, there was the one time we killed an aeon that travis wells tackled.. umm the fozzieclaw fleets that were a bunch of warping around not doing anything and ummm.... watching random idiots aggress in their caps get hit by drive-by DDs.
---
Sure looks like better content than what panfam are getting! /s
---
Lowsec Incursions are dominated by russian VNI/Ishtar-Fleets
---
I also demand skins for ships basically no one flys!
---
First two are from 2015.
---
It makes them stand out. If I roam and get a kill it's no big deal. Send me a mail? Now I know that they get triggered, and just makes the kill more than just isk and billboard stats.
---
I'm from New York and I dont get (or appreciate) the Sept 11th reference. Please elaborate on your thoughts.
---
Must have been someone similar then. I definitely recall a group dressed like in no. 2 when I went in 2014, it was the only Fanfest I've so far been to.
---
Your articles are super low effort. Pick up your game or give up.
---
Imagine actually going to a tidi fuckfest lmao
---
Back then moon mining was all passive, the pos did the mining and players hauled fuel in and moongoo out once a week or so, the good moons where only found in a few regions. Same with good ore. Which meant that whoever was able to hold onto those regions from the start just grew fat while everyone else starved. Now you can develop a region to be good, and it doesn't really matter which region you do it in. Geography is the only thing that matter now from a strategic point of view.
---
Grinding structures placed purely for the sake of claiming sov was never interesting gameplay. It won’t be in the future either, because it means there’s only one way to win, which is Titans. Titans will be better at that gameplay than everything else and the game will become even more centered around just one ship class as there become fewer relevant reasons to fly anything else.
---
Any cap on structures means no beachhead. Easier to kill/damage capless structures means again just Titans to do everything.
---
Killing “easy to kill” structures generates no real content and means that instead there will be even more structure spam because people won’t bother to defend most structures since they won’t have time to form or move a defense fleet.
---
Look, there’s plenty of room for changes but my problem is digging through the garbage of EVE development and looking at stuff that nobody enjoyed doing (repping POSes made me take a long break from EVE it was such a bad mechanic) and trying to throw them back in.
---
Ultimately if you want people to fight over Sov, you have to make it where there’s an appreciable benefit to doing so with a reduced cost of actually fighting. Yes making structures easy to kill reduces one time cost, but it also has loads of crappy side effects.
---
Adding the ability to either kill or capture a structure on its hull timer, for instance, would be very interesting if it was done with a reasonable mechanic.
---
Adding a semi-permanent mobile structure that disrupts ihub services but acts like a cyno field on the overview could be interesting as well.
---
are you new here? of course they try to spin it to fit their narrative, thats eve.
---
Okay my point about the post was. The #1 alliance in game. Used to tolerate this behavior. I was made aware this vid was way outdated. But i just happened to stumble across this and was baffled that the #1 alliance in the game *in which no one knows how tf to defeat* tolerated this behavior to stay on top and better the enemy. In which i just feel, idk dirty. Cause lets be honest here. Goons will never be kicked out of delve ever. And goons are winning in every aspect of the game. Economically and millitarily they are unmatched will stay so for a long time. So i kinda dont get the purpose of why should they tolerate this behavior when in fact they dont need this anymore. Mittani could have just said in that video "Okay you see a bot. Report it to ccp and let them do their job" cause if he really knew what he said during the meta show like 6 days ago that ccp knows how to distinguish bots from real playing players. Then it wouldnt be a problem right? But no he was hiding the fact that the alliance was tolerating botting behind the veil of the "We dont want goons that are innocent being banned" bullshit, and people are just too scared to go against goons because of what i stated at the beginning of this paragraph. I just couldnt really get why do this tho, youre not gonna get bootes out of the top, ever. Lol. Panfam has nothing against you. Test and legacy has nothing against you. Why widen the gap even more by tolerating botting? Idk just my thoughts. Read this before Imperium Reddit Brigade SIG comes and downvotes this to shit.
---
Every type now has a third version. For example when looking at pulse lasers, next to conflag and scorge you now also have Blaze

Fuck you yankee

He was making a joke on the 9/10, would do again thing. He’s not actually referencing the events that occurred on 9/11
---
Its anti-Delve post, just upvote
---
&gt;Is this a CCP developed game or is this just a NetEase game with Eve art? One could be fun, the other will be hated in western countries.
---
It's everyone in the industry's obsession at the moment; however, mobile as a platform only caters, with some *very* rare exceptions, to:
---
1. A very particular type of casual gamer (like my ex-wife);
---
2. Certain types of interactive games like words with friends, or a bit more complicated ones that allow you to set up a 'turn' and forget about it for awhile;
---
3. Young kids;
---
I have news for CCP, EA, Blizzard, etc... their primary audience is not any of those three. You are not going to replicate the success of roblox or minecraft pe. In fact, if the current trends can be believed, you are just pouring money down the drain... 
---
Something CCP seems to be intimately familiar with when it comes to reaching out beyond the current eve client/platform.
---
No, there is really a new, third, ammo type for each T2 weapon, additional to the faction guns
---
That is we love it and spend our time here
---
rip loool poor dude
---
oldie but a goodie
---
I’ve seen them in every edition I’ve been to [7 so far]. It’s easy to mix up some of them. I appear to have no direct pictures of Amarr costumes from 2014.
---
It generated content. POSes get what a day and a half tops with stront to RF? And that’s if they stront, then you can kill it, put your own up. Wirst case you forget to RF it, defenders have to repair it, and re-stront it, or you can come back and kill it very easily. Then you put up your own, and you get some nice passive income. Yeah they had problems, but imo the core idea was great.
---
Thank you Sir. I will double efforts. Sowing the seeds, so I can f**k the flowers.
---
Saying you might not resub because you didn’t get your free SP is like saying “I’m not going to get a job at all to make money because I have to lose some of it to taxes.” 
---
There may have been some miscommunication, so go complain about it on the forums like they asked. Also, I do believe a mass email essentially saying “no” is in fact telling you what they decided... I may be wrong though.
---
I thought it was the Scottish usage, which I like better.
---
the wilhelm scream, the hull going 'WAAaAAa' in the background..
---
pristine.
---
Yeah but 9/11 is a pretty politically charged number now. In the future you might do best to use different numbers because I definitely thought it was some fucked up 9/11 joke at first too
---
Used to live in Poitot. Great times with Clown Punchers (2009)

You're a pleasant little fuck-stain aren't you?
---
Adding in a space battle would have made this terrible movie better.
---
It's just a bot, posting the same list every week,,,
---
Seems like no one of the mods even knows about this \*eg\*
---
Luckily we dont have to turn everything into politics :)
---
Wait... you tackled a mining barge in the heart of goons completely devoid of its pewpewers? Crazy.
---
Austin Ryder for sure has been on the up and coming recently. Great flying with an FC that has expectations and knows how to pew from small gang and applies it well in f1 engagements.
---
sadly :(
---
Ikr how did I get there in the first place
---
Oh god i vibe with this comment so much. Hahaha i think these brainwashed goonies only think the game consists of panfam, legacy and imperium hahahaha.
---
He doesn't have a triage on though, which seems odd to me?  Granted I've never done Lif-bumping but I thought the triage at the last second was important.
---
Are you that bored that your looking for dirt on the imperium and all you could find was something from a year ago
---
&gt; Its much higher inside solar systems 
---
totall agree but when you "warp to the sun" you clean a lot of them so...
---
I've flown with him before but I just don't know how good he is now. Haven't seen him around in a while
---
Who gives a fuck if you’re from new york
---
Luckily we can remember that some numbers are inherently political and use that to avoid accidentally making awkward references to terrorist attacks that severely wounded a nation, those wounds still yet to fully heal :)
---
Are you that bored that your looking for dirt on the imperium and all you could find was something from a year ago?
---
Not gonna waste my time replying after this but unfortunately everything is politics already. Wish it weren't the case but being politically correct is a new social skill. People like you more if you do it, especially in the professional world. I get this is a game and you don't give a fuck what people think so my advice is probably being ignored but at least I tried to warn you
---
Bots dont gatecamp
---
It’s more just leaving a bad taste in my mouth right when I am supposed to be putting up money. On top of that the reason for that bad taste isn’t so much not getting the SP, it’s the complete dismissal that anyone could have misunderstood their in game countdown or anything could have been more clearly communicated.
---
They do only if they are part of the superior Icelandic race.
---
"Losing means we win"
---
It's also where size does matter. Matters a lot even. Goons are the only reason there is a fight at all. the second they loose interest, it will be over very fast.
---
Yeah cause most goon krabs play by themselves. Hmmm. *speculating*
---
&gt;Until they deploy anyway. Then, it’s “thanks for killing the retards”
---
Correct. Please kill more: 
---
1. Supers;
---
2. Capitals;
---
3. Freighters;
---
4. Barges;
---
In Delve. These are things I make, and you will be doing me a huge personal favor.
---
Gone up a lot lately, supply is now limited.   BPC's for them used to be a mere 80m
---
That’s awesome! A lot of people don’t know this but it’s actually the only named system in syndicate.
---
Oh BTW, those vindis will more than likely be polarized.  Just for EVERYONES info.

Killing our retarded means the species as a whole gets stronger....and richer when said retard goes to drop billions on his new autism chariot that will be destroyed yet again.

Fuck the Victorieux, they should have used another model :|
---
Nope i can attest to this being false. Getting into karma fleet is super aids. Lol i waited 35 days. Just to have toni reject my app cause my wallet was super sketch. Hahahaha
---
Finally a goon that isnt brainwashed. Praise odin!
---
I mean... the message doesn’t really amount to a complete dismissal in my eyes. Seems to address the situation quite clearly.
---
And you are different? you were the one who started throwing the narrative word around. Why are your narrative truer than theirs?
---
If i can just afford gold. Ill give them all to you man
---
Well if you want to keep going with that...
---
Actually, I was looking for Pakistani slurs, but it seems that being Pakistani is already such an embarrassment that the only real one is just shortening the word
---
What a shame to be brainwashed
---
[*Fuck you Tony!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3YjQSvDzA)
---
It wasn't true. Eviction didn't make goons stronger. Delve krabbing and the change in the game to favor krabbing even more did. Had Goons kept the entirety of the north we'd have hit Serenity levels of blob.
---
I remember meeting these two at this very fanfest!

I didnt know that. Im noting this thank you :kiss:

Awkward references to *your own government bombing itself to create the sense of fear in the population needed to have them support a war for resources*

I fixed your post

Yeah my wife's not as fun

'Fully Heal'. Mate there are people born after 9/11 that are able to vote now.

See a therapist if you still aren't over it, or just clutch your pearls in silence so the rest of us don't have to deal with this white knighting shtick that is defending no one that cares.

Salt has been successfully mined here, next?
---
And you know the genius that came up with THIS response is completely unable to comprehend that beggars can’t be choosers.
---
Lmao. 
---
I have no "narrative"
---
Well yeah maybe i am or maybe i just fell super deep in an eve rabbithole in youtube that i just stumbled upon this vid. I did start from progod rage fc-ing then to test's 13 year plan *with the mountain railgun thing* to the leaked SOG from 2016 to this. So yeah maybe i was just bored. Idk. Im in a highsec corp waiting for moons to pop so i can make dank iskies. Lol.
---
May i collect the salt now?
---
Can you explain why the north is valuable for those who have shield doctrines?
---
Why the 9/11 reference though? Wtf?
---
I'm fine with control + number - that works fine. And I know you can move them but with 7 active modules control 1 is much easier than 7
---
I think you've already got enough salt after you got kicked from tnt
---
It would be nice if goons and zone alliances will declare etherium reach how free zone
---
I did them in the T5 Gila that’s in the Abyssal Lurkers channel! You gotta use a Thermal hardener instead of whatever hardener is loaded on there, as well as Thermal drones/missiles. I died once to a starving room, so maybe swap out one adaptive for a battery!
---
Probably. Enjoying highsec tho. Super profitable. :okay sign:
---
Lol okay, I'm fine in delve
---
Fractions give you PTSD, we get it. Maybe talk to a therapist and seek some help. Asking the world to change because of your emotions when they clearly aren't trying to instigate you means you need to take it upon yourself. 
---
Mental help for PTSD might be an answer, or you know--being a dick works too I guess.
---
I feel a little disdain and personal anger on your comments. Bruv. You wanna talk about it?
---
this line is even better than the post fuck lol
---
Meh delve was alright. I mean its delve. Its the best space in game rn.
---
You are free now
---
I think instead of web 2 you could try web 1.9 🤔
---
It's fine as it is
---
muh Syndicate sov!
---
They have some
---
Is it family problems, or girlfriend problems or something? Cause i can really feel youre angry at something. Again if you want to talk to someone dm me.
---
web 2.0 is a bit out dated anyway
---
i'm training projectile rigging, and i'll be good to go. i'm currently at level 0 :)
---
"Sov" in the sense that you claim a system and enforce ownership.
---
Dam tired to click this "OK" for like 10s
---
Bring back the coalition of free stars and make querious great again!
---
Wow the hypocracy here is almost too much for me to handle. Goons playing the game the way it's designed is the ones who're destroying the game? Seriously?! How can you sit there in you Castle built on other peoples labours overlooking vast swathes of empty renter space and think you are the one doing this right!
---
As far as I know Horde is better but NCPL and their botter empi... sorry, Renter empire is problem here. Occupying so much space that is almost completely empty, taking up space other people could use a lot better just because they are lazy shits who only want "leet PvP"
---
Unless it is a battle Rorqual, there are so many ways that is better than rorqual mining to make isk. Rorquals are only so good because of how easy it is to be bot aspirant and have 20 semi afk in a belt.
---
Just sub. Sub costs nothing.
---
get cpu implant
---
i enjoy breadsticks
---
Hey penif. Where arth thou molok?
---
You fucktards need to realize there is no 9/11 reference
---
One of my largest complaints about bots in EVE is that we, the player base, have no visual tools in game or out of game to review activity of players in a way that we can actually understand it without parsing large amounts of data through player created databases.  If CCP could just put something like this in game that we can review, and know what our averages are for corporation, alliance, etc, it would be a lot easier for us to see visually where there are clear signs of bot activity.
---
Why is visualization needed? If a player gets ticks for more than 20 hours a day on average it’s clearly a bot. A human can’t stay awake that long and account sharing is forbidden.
---
Because we would have to manually scrape ESI data for this, the current method is not practical. Theres no oversight or review tools in game to look at this.
---
Those have been in the files for eons.  They do a damage type that is atypical.  Blaze = mainly explosive damage frequency crystal.
---
Lmfao you're so out of touch it's just comical. Enjoy talking shit on the internet and feeling superior!
---
are there any  other nullsec  NRDS? an exsisting lowsec  NRDS too?
---
Nice solution for a power grid issue.
---
Etherium Reach was never neutral, that's reddit memeing itself.  
---
Unspoken and Co had a long series of deals and blues with neighbors, firstly HRE but also deals with PH/NC and our nearby renters. Unspoken in the past had gotten in trouble and batphoned Snuff but it was all resolved amicably.
---
This lasted for 1 year+.
---
Then one fine day they decided to start working closely with the goon sigs deployed north. They helped them toast sov and opened their bridges and citadels to them. To the shock of nobody, supers were moved in range of etherium reach and unspoken was rapidly evicted.
---
Staying up for 20hrs is nothing, try staying up for 72 hrs with less than 4 hrs of sleep in between.
---
Bit there is place for a small/med group? Provi is not that big. Pretty sure all sistems have sov already.
---
Uhhh why do you think that?
---
Wormhole btw.
---
So my Corp has a tax on all mining done on moons or anoms based on esi of your mining ledger.  On the basis that ratters pay an isk tax miners should too...
---
im looking for other  NRDS groups currently. provi is too hard occupied
---
Everyone has a narrative dude. You should check up the definition and then reread your own posts here. I'm sure you'll understand then.
---
Good chance this would trick most Goons tbh
---
For the next few months...Delve
---
get CPU implant
---
Didn´t know that, but considering they now got updated with new stats ( **radius:** 0.0 **=&gt;** 1.0 ; **isDynamicType:** None **=&gt;** False ), and a description update, maybe they are reintroducing them?
---
But alliance leads wouldn’t need this if they just banned them. I guess this would help for gray areas.
---
Read what?
---
Sure, occasionally. But a human can’t realistically play a game 20 hours a day indefinitely.
---
The fitting isn't "gone", it's just displayed as corp hangar on zkill.
---
Nice one on a really great post and a super way to leave the game. Good on ya! I sincerely hope you have fun in whatever you do next. Much love.
---
Yes, this assists leaders at a corp or alliance level.  You might have a few turbo krabs that hit the rats for 8 hours a day in stints (doubtful they would do it every single day) and you can chat with them and have them on voice comms to verify human activity. But if you cant reach a player and they are consistently pulling 24, 30, 38 ticks every day, that's a good sign there is a problem. Currently, nothing in game gives us this data.
---
Might fix a different problem that we don't even know about yet!
---
If only you knew what videogame addiction does to some people.
---
Most bots don't run the same acc for 20 hours a day btw
---
There's quite literally no reason not to sub out VNI accounts in shifts
---
Great Wilands is perfect for starting alliances. A large swath of very good moons, great ranges for JF's. Lots of other small groups staking a claim. A lot of isk can be made even without SOV.
---
But be careful doing T5's bcs I heard you can spawn at 0km in new structure room. Depends on the spawn but most likely you will loose ship + pod
---
Is it really only 30 days for max dirt? I hate dirt, I clean every ship as I undock which is annoying as hell on like 10 clients at a time. Wish it was an option.
---
That's fine, you'll still have consistency of data to look at. I think what a lot of people miss is that a player doesnt do exactly the same things at the same times every single day. Usually there are variations. If it's truly a bot, they will likely exhibit consistency of behaviors that will be very obvious visually.
---
I dunno what goons use, I guess self written.
---
Dunno if there are already existing ones for this purpose.
---
There are plenty of toolkits for certain languages like python, c# etc. you can simply use the kits and then start building some core functions.
---
The 2 factor shit can be annoying, but there are some guides on how it works.
---
if you don't want to build a dedicated website for it you can simply link a token request with the respective scopes you need and the respective corpceo can simply give you the return code -&gt; you then can create the respective esi-token and refresh-token with the given response and use these to send the esi-requests to ccp to get whatever, wallet, contracts, depending on the scopes you asked for earlier.
---
Developing a little tool that does this with esi data would be much less effort and work than implementing a whole new gamefeature for it.
---
I write them, so I may as well make sure people know they're available. (and do feature requests if they're reasonable)
---
Once more worried about your killboard, this only reinforces that.
---
Group think is a good social skill you get extra good boi points for being anti white though
---
Holy crap this is normal behavior for them.
---
Tangling is the only way to pvp.
---
They placed the ihubs to bring the region to a bit of calm. Its not that they are invading they want to make it difficult for goons to camp in their back garden. Systems with ihubs owned by anyone directly opposed to ncpl get left alone. Any system they worry could end up as a beehive gets an ihub dropped. Simple
---
Yeah, it's just something that not every player corporation or alliance has the resources for.  Sure, a community project would be great, but putting it in game enables every corporation and alliance, even those without a website, to see it and act on the data if they feel there is a problem.
---
solock mate, take a second and reread it the post. Don't get it twisted.
---
American agrees.
---
Ah, thanks.
---
Yep the multi dollar media empire vs the rmt betting empire.
---
Woooooosh
---
u/CCP_Peligro this is directed to you, btw.
---
You know this is incredibly unlikely, particularly when it goes on for months. Why are you pushing back against automated detection and banning?
---
Not all systems in providence have NRDS sov, so there's something to fight over if sov was important, but you don't need sov to move into existing NRDS provi.
---
So you are once again avoiding fights you can lose to save your killboard stats.
---
I wouldn't know.
---
At least co2 fought against overwhelming numbers to save their keepstar in m-o. NC. Transfers ownership to a holding Corp and peace's out.
---
I'm not even American, mate. But if you honestly think America has bounced back, you haven't got your eyes open.
---
Fear of Islam and Muslims in general is still ripe. The TSA still exist. A general fear of acts of terror shapes security policy and is used to rationalize police behavior every single day.
---
There is a deep wound in the American psyche that has barely a bandaid over it.
---
It's you who's out of touch. People are getting fed up with over the top pc douchebags who turn everything someone says into a political argument they don't agree with to then take the moral highground.  
---
&gt;Enjoy talking shit on the internet and feeling superior  
---
pretty rich given that's exactly what **you** are doing.
---
Ur nt gonna gt sov in provi unless u can defend it urself. But NRDS allows nuetrals to love their.
---
Bots aren't completely consistent either, you can't expect the typical alliance leadership idiot to all have stats degrees.
---
There are lots of small fixes for players in AUTZ. They are all temporary.
---
The only permanent fix for AUTZ internet issues is to upgrade to either EUTZ or USTZ
---
Project Discovery to identify periodicity of ~~celestial objects~~ bots.
---
And by defend it...means actually have man power. Not just u and 5 alts.
---
im no up on the tch but.. isnt there a way for them to see if game is running though some sort of programmed control or third party software or something. this game has been out for along time and bots have been one would think someone could come up with a way to tell.
---
No, typical alliance leadership probably doesn't, but you can bet someone in their organization has the skills or the mentality to look at a data chart and make heads or tails of it, and decide if hitting report bot to CCP is warranted.
---
get flammenwerfer
---
Every alliance that has a lot of botters has or is managed by a group that has people managing their IT. Botter aren't looking for alliances that can't provide them relative safety.
---
Unfortunately the average nullsec alliance can't afford $50k+/yr to hire a statistician.
---
The only person insulting anyone is you please tell me what I said that was insulting to you
---
What makes you think botters can't use a mic?
---
No, we didn't.
---
You mean to tell me that a player base which we know for a fact is aging and has a lot of highly technical people in it cant read a fucking bar chart? Get real dude, stop selling this community of weaponized autistics short.
---
Please work for free :)
---
Alright, you're just clearly either a bot supporter or a moron, not going to engage with you anymore.
---
I think it was good, but I agree
---
You'll be back o7
---
To some extent this is true, it doesn't ring true in rental alliances that dont provide services or monitor individual player activity of renters. In those situations, a Corp recruiting in members to meet their monthly rental payments would benefit from visual data.
---
The capability already exists Wulkans in the ESI to see that data. What are you going on about?
---
Yes, it's in ESI, it's not in game. Not all player organizations have access to this data or the tools for it, if CCP supplied it inside the game players could actually review member activity and make informed decisions on that players activity after a review of all the other information they have about that player.
---
Updating Attributes wont be done by hand, in all likelihood ccp will have tools to do that for them. Guess they just forgot to exclude non-published itemtypes.
---
The Ammo itself has been in the data dumps for a loooong time.
---
&gt; the little thing that could.....
---
Yeah this guy.
---
I guess he deleted his channel after all oh well
---
I think I need a blue pill too :(
---
Why don't you supply the tool?
---
Always sad to see people go, Joined this game almost a year ago with a couple of rl friends and really enjoying it so far. Sure after all this time you have lots of anecdotes and stories will be nice you share some before winning eve :D  
---
Anyway good luck and have a nice life!!  
---
(sorry for my bad english, greetings from Spain)

You can't actually refit on a Viator as far as i understand.

Well, not anymore.
---
use the home row and its adjacent keys, not f1-7 and its modifiers. Or don't
---
I agree with most of your statements my only comment in response is that it will be extremely hard to remove the soul crushing week long timers without doing something where titans are just better at it. Structured are jusy giant hit boxes and regardless of what you do eith the mechanics, you need straight dps to kill them. Titans and supers will always be the better damage boats. 
---
With that out of the way, we do need to have reasons to invade. Multiple ideas have been thrown out, the most of which are pure garbage or already existed and was removed because it was abused (see technetium empire). 
---
There is usually two main reasons to invade a state in real life; you need resources they have, or the place has a significant enough value (sentimental or economical) to warrant holding it. The most common one is the resources. 
---
Eve has the problem that all the resources you need to build your army are within your one region of space or very easily imported if it's not. To my knowledge, no one region of space has a sufficient lack of resources. I'm not as familiar with moon goo though. This means that there is no resource drive to invade a region. 
---
The other value to a region is the true sec of systems and the ratting anomalies. These just print isk. Right now, one region can satisfy the needs of all but the largest entities, and even those make do. The recent changes may have had somewhat of an impact but not enough of one to cause the large entities to spread out. 
---
With resources and value not being a problem, you get the current situation. Evem if you introduce some restrictions, it could become horribly unbalanced and the larger, more established entities will simply steamroll into the region they need and take e hat they want. The gap between large and small alliances is simply too big right now. 
---
The other problem is citadel spamming. This has been discussed with a hard cap based on planets/moon's but as you said, no beach head would exist. I'm not sure I have a good answer to this. The amount of citadels and the distinct soul crushing grind to kill evem the smallest is enough to deter any true invasion. Citadels are broken, but what is the way to fix them? That's the 1 trillion isk question isn't it? 
---
The next problem is the sov system itself. Pointing a wand at a thing and letting it cycle for 60 minutes with adm 6 is just as bad if not worse than killing citadels. At the end of the day, the ihubs are what is important and the system leans towards n+1 always winning because numbers is the important thing. 
---
For citadel spam, have some sort of way to disable one of the reinforcement timers or require them to consume a set amount of strontium for each timer. For disabling, you could use the tech ii  entosis link. Only one pilot can entosis the structure at a time. You can hit the structure at the same time as entosising. The entosis must complete x cycles before the reinforcement window is updated. X being some number determined by either adm or combine it with requiring stront for the timer and the link consumes the stront. Once the stront is gone, the reinforcement timer is as well. Idk. This may be a terrible idea but it's something that cpuld help. Again, only one of the timers can be bypassed. If it's low power then woohoo, no timer. Limiting it to one person that can entosis and a warm up cycle means that you can kill the entosiser if you're paying attention. If the structure is taking damage, you can't refuel the stront bay. You can refuel it though while it is reinforced. 
---
A beachhead structure with a quick online timer is definitely needed. This has been discussed. the idea that I like the most is no docking access, but you can tether and access hangars kind of like the old corporate/sma hangars in poses. This way you can refuel, re ammo and repair. 
---
The biggest problem is still driving factor to invade. I just don't have a good answer to this without causing another tech moon empire.
---
it is
---
:chinthink:
---
Wouldn't be too hard to take typical profiles of real players and make your bot more or less match that kind of pattern.
---
The only deal we had with Panfam was with Horde over Rorquals. It didn't last very long.
---
And we were blue with Skill since the campaign against the DRF. 
---
Thats about it.
---
Or, players can play the game instead of doing ccp's job.
---
Any player organization that does not have access to the data is just stupid and should disband.
---
There is already a plethora of FREE third party tools to collate and view this data.
---
It does not need to be in game.
---
imagine thinking people cringing at your inability to interact with people is anger
---
That's my focus. You visually look at the data. You think about all activity and interactions you've had with that character. You make a judgement call. CCP would be better served getting bot reports from CEOs or Alliance executors (not saying this should be a requirement, just saying from a practical perspective) with high activity visual data information than just "omg random neutral warped out of their anomaly AS SOON as I jumped in, clearly a bot, report report report".
---
Also nullified and has enough low slots to be stabbed.
---
The only thing you fear really are Maulus Navy’s iirc. Even then it’s pot luck with that align time
---
Resorting to personal attacks. What a classy and effective way to get your point across. 
---
Also, how long do you think those 2-4 kiters are going to stay on grid with our hit-approach-atrons and F1-Caracals when a Celestis lands and damps them out? Unless we've bubble the entire field, they're going to leave and that's the end of the content. Yay. Fun and engaging for both sides.
---
No ones telling anyone to do CCPs job. That's not the point.
---
Those corps don't care. Seriously.
---
That kind of stuff is needed indeed.
---
But that was the point...their goal is to get people to log in every day, because the more logins they get the more profit it comes out to. If they gave 100k a day people wouldn't care as much about missing a few. The plan was intended to get people to login at least 16 out of 18 days. 
---
It's a wordwide game. They can't operate within time zone timelines...they operate under one timeline, like every other game on the planet. Just because you happen to live in a different time zone doesn't mean they should change everything to accommodate.
---
So real.
---
Videogame addiction doesn't overcome human anatomy my dude. There aren't nerds throwing cars out of the way to chase gamer girls and there aren't nerds staying up for 72 hours consistently, no matter how addicted they are.
---
&gt; and not whine about getting dunked in their kitchen sink shit fit standing fleet
---
Except we don't get dunked. It's usually just us chasing them gate to gate for a bit and then one side or the other giving up. Maybe we lose a couple tackle ships in the process.
---
Not true about not having the tools available. At least know what you are talking about.
---
I'm going to need to agree with Mittani on this one:   
---
Players are pretty bad at identifying bots.   
---
Even if we made data like this publicly available, there'd be stupids that claimed anyone who ratted for 2 hours was a bot. Anyone that made more ISK/hour than they did? Gotta be a bot.  Not to mention that this sort of data would be some fairly serious intel.
---
I'm not against the idea that bots have to restrict their activity to what a normal player does in order to stop the printing of liquid isk at an industrial scale by bots.
---
The reason for analyzing the data must be detection and possibly automated banning. You are arguing against it because there are incredibly rare exceptions.
---
&gt;but detected cases should be reviewed by a real human.
---
This becomes impossible when you have thousands of cases.
---
ESIKnife
---
Well you know what they do whever their income gets a nerf: make some more characters.
---
Pretty pathetic click-bait title. Even for Eve that's either complete ignorance or you are a worthless human being.. I'll let you decide which.
---
Ok that was pretty good
---
&gt;a Corp recruiting in members to meet their monthly rental payments

---
There we got your first problem, one that can be solved without any IT or statistical data involved.
---
Technically we are going north to kill a bunch of bots and the people who give those bots safe harbor.
---
Man power meas what? 200 guys in space mushrooms things? 10 ferox?

I like the mashup!!!
---
ethereum has lost its status as a free region is now undeclared territory of the pandemic legion, and those who live there is because some carnal relationship they have with them
---
Goons showed up after NC. had deployed, taking advantage of the chance to hit B0T stuff in the ensuing chaos. PH Brought in supers when they realized they were not making gains as quickly as they would have liked to.
---
lol
---
You really gonna try to convince people you doing any thinking?
---
&gt;This becomes impossible when you have thousands of cases.  
---
Impossible? no. But it sure is time consuming. And axing team security down to the minimum sure didn't help CCP there.
---
Glass them
---
As a line member....no fuckn clue. I just know they say no to alot of people.
---
true. waffles recently took a system. if you can take it back you surely would be allowed to keep it.
---
GI go home?
---
Do they have public structures for refining (reprocessing), reactions, research, invention and manufacturing? Do they have access to any ore in the local market or do they have to import it all from jita? Do they have jumpfreighter services that allow proper collateral? If all of these things, then I stand corrected.
---
Only problem with your post is assuming our government is competent enough to have done that and somehow covered up any leaks leading back to anyone here having been involved.
---
&gt; As everyone knows, Etherium Reach has fallen under NCPL influence, and it was one of the last neutral (free) lands in new eden.
---
Do you realise NC or a close ally of theirs has owned Etherium Reach for like 8 of the last 10 years? Just look at the [sov ownership for LXQ](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/LXQ2-T). Time is a flat circle.
---
Rorqs supers and sov. That's the standard 'bluetral' deal not unlike horde has with other neighbors.
---
&gt; It didn't last very long. 
---
Lasted for over one year don't try to downplay it.
---
And fully blu with HRE.
---
So you were blu or blutral to your two main neighboors, how is that being 'a true neutral region'? by that standard tribute and tenal are 'true neutral regions'.
---
It's possible that there are actually *more* real humans who play 20 hours a day than bots, because bot owners know that that kind of playtime is a red flag, while addicted human players wouldnt really think of that
---
AFAIK there are no other real functioning NRDS groups. We're it.
---
As long as the nullsec you speak of isn't Delve, why would they care?
---
I also thought it was in reference to 9/11 the date at first. But I also realized that wasn't the person's intent who posted it so I remain inoffended. Wr need to calm down people, its actually a fairly funny post.
---
Spend it all on exotic male dancers. Form them into an army,  and take over new Eden uncontested because no one is going to fight a bunch of naked dudes.
---
&gt;there aren't nerds staying up for 72 hours consistently, no matter how addicted they are.  
---
There have been people who died because they did exactly that before. But 72 hours without break wasn't mentioned anywhere regardless so it doesn't matter.
---
Most of the world arrange the calendar days/months/years because you know, that makes sense.
---
Finaly someone with common sens
---
The CEO or Directors can make a corp level key, plug it into SeAT, and see exactly how much ratting every single member is bringing in as long as their tick is over 100k, which is enough to pull taxes on.
---
I will take the second one. ... and also two number 9s and a large soda
---
The crazy train doesnt stop once it revs up.
---
Our Titans shall block out the Sun!
---
You know they wont do it, so automated detection becomes pointless and the botting can continue!
---
If we did this your way, we would actually be disincentivising players from hunting bots because neutrals in system would cause bots to dock up, miss a tick or two, and appear more human-like. If we wanted to make sure we could catch all of the non-stop bots, we'd have to agree as a community to just let the bots run rampant for weeks to show that kind of consistency. 
---
This seems like a very silly way to try and tackle the problem.
---
U don’t need to own sov to be in provi. If you are not kos. U can chose a provi bloc owned system and move there and use the system according to provi bloc rules. There are plenty of structures that allow neutral docking. Don’t drop structures unless sov holder agrees. First in site owns it. No cherry picking. 
---
 Don’t shoot non kos people. Don’t be an ass. If you need more info jump into CVA diplo channel and ask away
---
 Someone will help for sure.
---
Well yeah but they still shoot you and say that you're KOS because of your corp history. I mean these days the KOS list is just retroactive justification, they shoot first and find a way to label you KOS later.
---
Provi is effectively NBSI.
---
Wow, you went out in style, congrats. Sounds like you had a blast playing, how about pay it forward and donate the 5B to a helpful group, like Signal Cartel or Eve University.
---
Start with 50 doctrine subcaps on a cta ping and maybe 15-20 dreads for a dread bomb. Plus blues obviously and a few bridging titans.
---
Never forge.
---
I mean, what I'm suggesting here is a tool that player organizations can use IN GAME to review this type of data at scale.  However people choose to use that data is up to them.  Based on my recent experience hunting bots, they arent exactly easy to catch and require a bit of planning which makes them all the more difficult and a net loss to the capsuleers hunting them.
---
Officer weapons are all large so what they have is correct.
---
Would be cool if someone would actually make a tool that can do what you're asking for and make it public. Hell if i was still playing EVE i'd maybe even do it myself. From what i did with ESI so far getting the required data isn't hard. I'm an amateur in regards to coding and i made a small ore buyback calculator that grabbed ESI market data so i doubt someone who is actually experienced with it would need more than one or two days for a tool that just needs to scrape names and timestamps from wallet interaction.
---
u/CSMprogodlegend
---
&gt;  just forgot the /s
---
I assumed even this community has enough braincells to get by without one
---
Same, tbh. I'd rather this be an in game tool though, so that releasing ESI data is no necessary for internal audits.  Can easily be picked up through corporate taxes.
---
&gt;what I'm suggesting here is a tool that player organizations can use IN GAME to review this type of data at scale. 
---
It still doesn't matter whether it's in-game or out-of-game. People are going to look at the graphs, and it'll be too easy to mistake several dips as "oh, the player just got tired" instead of "oh, the bot docked up because of passing neutrals". 
---
You're going to get a dumb gradient of people who are totally fine with what they see, and other people who will raise cries and raise allegations over nothing.
---
Thanks a Lot. Will check out.
---
Not all my posts boisterous
---
Which is different from the current situation? At least someone with a normal number of chromosomes can make an informed decision.
---
Cloaked ships definitely need more skins
---
Technically that isn't the reason at all and the war was already planned before the botting data was public.  
---
*looks at username*  
---
Shit you got me
---
I never said we were a true neutral region, that the telling of the OP in this thread , not mine. Plus we were align with SkillU for a long time during the DRF and the TRI conflicts.
---
But we were free of the bullshit renters system though and we have invite some neutral entities in the region to make it more alive.
---
For the Horde " bluetral " deal , I guess it will always depend of who are spinning it , because I don't recall we had a interdiction of toasting your sov , more like we didn't want to toast it  because we didn't care to do it. We had enough toasting content with Prothean back then anyways.
---
If you're a neut unknown in the area, proceed with caution I suppose.
---
CCP gave away some free stuff.  Not everyone met the conditions for ALL the gift.  Kind of hard to be mad at CCP about this, but some folks managed to pull it off.
---
I will say that this set of gifts was transparently tied to trying to boost login numbers.  They could have easily just added all the items to the reddem queue with no requirement to login.  Instead looking to encourage so much logging in was very likely to have many folks fail to claim the reward.  I have to assume this forseeable risk was accepted.
---
Except they *are* doing it. Its just not really effective since they lack the manpower.
---
&gt; At least someone with a normal number of chromosomes can make an informed decision.
---
What "informed decision" ? Players cannot ban botters. Only CCP can do that. 
---
All this seems to do is scratch that curiosity itch of "I wanna see how much ISK bots are making" and I don't see how this useful to anyone "with a normal number of chromosomes" beyond that.
---
You can already report suspect botters in game. I don't see why you need to have this kind of tool to do so.
---
Well that IS the narrative™
---
Please point me to where i said you insulted me (or anyone for that matter). Reading is hard i know, but please at least try it.
---
Not as big of a retard as you, go drink bleach dinobrain
---
Hope you are wrong, but i'm afraid that you are not.
---
In warp to me you cant multibox so its not that profitable compare to other activities
---
Train up one more level of Shield Upgrades or drop the gun rig.
---
Isn’t that Klingon-influenced tattoo heresy on a whole other level?
---
There are people in your own alliance who get paid less than 50%
---
All memes welcome. Dont listen this guy ^
---
why is that?  goons are hitting tribute.  not gotg.  or is there another party at work in the region?
---
Honestly, that depends on where you are active. Upwel structures are the biggest change, and moon mining requires you to actually mine instead of being a passive process. Moon mining is also now a thing in HS and WHs as well as NS and LS. Caps got a major balance pass recently and we now have Triglavan ships. There are more of them that they aren't just a new pirate faction, and their main mechanic is DPS that ramps over time. They still aren't fully introduced though as we are getting 3 new T2 variants in the next patch along side the trig incursions. Wardeck mechanics are the other big change, you now need to own a structure to both be decable and to deck someone, and if you destroy the HQ of the corp that war decked you, the dec drops and you get 2 weeks of immunity from being decked by that same group. Old POS jammers and jump bridges have been replaced, though that may not impact you depending on where you like to play.
---
OFC you can think about it what you want, but i actually enjoy watching this kind of video and i know of other people that do so too, thats why i decided to do them myself in the first place. Also because i want to save these experiences for myself for a later time. So you shouldnt really generalize.
---
Making the implant so powerful lets T1 Battlecruisers be good links options for cheaper fleet comps.
---
Nine nine!
---
Nah we make our T1 ships in highsec stations.  We talked about getting some industrial citadels but honestly we are too new and couldn’t figure out how to anchor them.  We are on the waiting list though so next time any PL member logs in they are supposed to help, it’s been 7 weeks.  Soon(tm).
---
Me too. Maybe after the War opens up new opportunities
---
you can, just don't tell anyone. i used to do it all the time and never got caught
---
Chinese meme game is pretty strong, a solid 7/10
---
For me it was the realization that a panther and a nag are about three weeks of training apart, and there were a LOT of idiots in things just slightly too big to kill with hurricanes...
---
7/10
---
Would have given you a 9 but for the Req logo. Solid attempt though
---
if you're not intending to do ccp's job, then it doesn't matter if somebody is a bot or not.
---
That is or the Amarr to deal with. I am not Amarr.
---
Easy money and muti-boxing a pvp ship and pve ships is easy with mining.
---
I'm not aware of what my alliance mining rules since I don't take part in it, but considering that LS mining is about 20 times more dangerous than anywhere else I'm pretty sure that taxe is there for a reason.
---
iirc for seAT you need to host it or have someone host it? I used to use a browser version but don't think it works any more.
---
Unfortunatly im an honest Guy that Follow the rules
---
you see kill bots have a preset kill limit, so you need to send wave after wave of your own men till they hit their limit and shutdown
---
We're golden as long as our overlords have a sense of humor
---
He does indeed shit posts
---
Thanks Obanen.
---
See ya retard
---
There is too much usable space for all players and war is a big pain in the ass due to how citadels and timers work (and other reasons). It's boring, a chore, there's nothing exciting about it. So big alliances have very little incentive.
---
Life must be tough to get so angry about not being given something for free in a video game.
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out
---
Was made super clear u had to log in dailly to gt rewards. If u didnt understand that....bye.
---
It seems the are not doing it. Thats why nothing happened to the chinese bots until someone posted here.
---
The manpower is an issue because people like you want them to manually verify everything.
---
Fuck off it was a free event it didn’t cost u anything!Jesus it’s getting pathetic now.
---
this
---
i have a statistics degree, the last thing i want to do when i get home is make and interpret yet more fucking charts and graphs.
---
you couldn't pay me enough to do more of that on top of the 40hrs a week i already spend making shitty graphs and charts for people who won't even look at them.
---
I know you can't ask every corp to have a dedicated developer but this is getting ridiculous.
---
To be honest getting these rewards was pretty easy.  I literally fired up each client and clicked a single button.  Redeem to an account before expiry (six months?).  Now it's true I didn't realise I could also do this with my alphas, so they missed out on the big bucks.  Nevermind.
---

Max pg and speed rolls on a corelum a type 50mn mwd. navy power cores, faction cap recharger, faction overdrives instead of reactor control units, 3 auxiliary thrusters instead of a current router, high grade snakes with zors nav link, put it in a c6 black hole, 28km/s.
---
&gt;I don't see why you need to have this kind of tool to do so.
---
CCP has expressed that they are at least considering punishing alliances that harbor bots.  Surely giving alliances tools to help identify them if they're going to go that route makes sense.
---
Hey, at least you weren't banned for talking to people on teamspeak.
---
If you did get the smaller skill point packages, can I haz ur stuff
---
ha, gaaaaaaaaaaay
---
Presumably there is something to do with 1.1m free skillpoints
---
Dude, chill. It's a free promotional event. I got screwed out of the 1mil SP on an alt account, too, and while it sucks a bit I ultimately didn't lose anything.
---
No there wasnt.  It was giving you up until server maintenance on May 20 to claim your rewards.  This meant the final claim period lasted 23 hours from server reset on May 19, giving everyone the opportunity to log in and claim that reward.
---
The emails I received about the event and the blurb on the launcher showed an ending period of May 20.  Because of how server reset functions, this would mean that the event is leaving with the server maintenance on May 20, which is early morning - at least here in the US.  
---
I guess some peoole thought they would have May 20 to claim their login rewards, but that would make the event end on May 21.
---
&gt;one would think someone could come up with a way to tell.   
---
They did. They come up with it on a regular basis. But the people who write bots aren't sleeping either and come up with new ways to avoid detection. It's a never ending cat and mouse game.

It requires a max roll on the MWD, though you can roll the cap batteries to make the PG a bit easier.

This isn't their keepstar though, thats quite clear if you check who owns it currently.

All sleeper agents are goons after the fact when mittens is claiming credit for other people's work.

&gt;It seems the are not doing it. Thats why nothing happened to the chinese bots until someone posted here.

Don't choke on the koolaid my dude.

Golden Magnate technically works better

But for any realistic purposes, yeah, punisher is probably the best choice
---
Doubt.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/jaZjB7c.png](https://i.imgur.com/jaZjB7c.png)  this can hit some very stupid numbers with implants drugs and abyssal mods. A max rolled power grid speed mwd like you say you have there could easily allow you to get this going 11k m/s before drugs and implants by having another speed low and higher base mwd speed.
---
To be fair, the "Daily login campaign" is such a misleading title, I can understand why he was confused. /s
---
I don't think you know what hypocrisy means or you're just deliberately using it wrong. CODE miners are literally the opposite of hypocrites. CODE doesn't say that you shouldn't mine, quite the opposite actually.
---
It's really not. If we cared about killboards I would have dropped numerous times before I fed. Maybe some people do, but there's people in every alliance that care about their killboards.... and then there's mine that has 300 ships that were lost in a WH that I was never in. THANKS HARDKNOCKS!
---
Daily log in...what the hell is confusing about that title...dailly....log....in....not log in once....log in dailly.
---
So tl;dr don't be a retarded krab?
---
2/10, at least you didn't put whole bee in place of head.
---
goons are going via pb to hit tribute, so they'll use it as an fob at one point
---
Init and snuff have been kicking out a few of the small alliances that have lived there in the past couple of months
---
I think you missed a point sir, krabs ain't gonna die, they just lost some ratting ships
---
Great firewall of AU is on?
---
Inaccurate, it was the same last year.
---
Are you saying after 15 years, CCP finally wrote a script to check ticks?
---
Bait
---
The /s at the end meant I was sarcastic, in case you could not tell already from how obvious I made it sound.
---
But some idiot is gonna agree. So had to put it in bot terms.
---
I was 1 day close to get the 1M SP and I think you're vastly over reacting.
---
tbf, CCP kinda is.
---
Sitting on 5 of the things.  Just watching the price go up and up and up.  But it's fine.  Because the day I decide to sell will be the day they announce that it will be the reward for a new event, and the price crashes.  Just like all my Leopards.  And those web implants.  And my Geckos.
---
ah ok
---
I got everything but the last day.  Also no, sorry friend.  Contract was already given out.
---
Crabs are the future, unless you're a retarded crab, then you're not the future
---
oof, that would be pretty upsetting
---
Please stop copypasting from my post history. I need to make these posts so i can be downvoted by angry goons who are mad that I'm not playing eve the way they think it should be played.
---
it's cloaky and nullified. I'd say you don't really need sub 2s align as you can just hit warp and cloak up on the same server tick.
---
I would propose asking around (on Reddit, in Corp, in alliance, in jita local) for some deep safes in systems you need. You can even offer to buy them.
---
Good luck with hiding your super, running abyssals, or setting up structures.
---
See above comment
---
An imp with a 10mn would also be faster if we are including tournament ships. At least that one might be purchasable.
---
Ok, so if I have this right, the full timeline is as follows:
---
1. Unspoken and Prothean start fighting over Etherium Reach. Both Unspoken and Prothean have friends that I am not mentioning.
---
2. In mid-February, Unspoken wins that war, despite Prothean enjoying tacit support from PH/Panfam.
---
3. In mid-March, Lazerhawks/Unspoken start hitting NC. renters, taking sov and destroying a sotiyo.
---
4. In reponse to those attacks, NC deploys subcaps and dreads to defend the renters.
---
5. Goons show up to help Unspoken and to hit B0T.
---
6. PH brings in their supers and frees Unspoken from the curse of sov life.
---
Is that an approximately correct timeline of events?
---
That adds another point of failure though, so I'd prefer it &lt; 2s.
---
They wouldn't have gotten the 1mil at the end but still some decent rewards for a birthday event
---

This wasn't my alt account.  I had also logged in over 16 days, but the way the timers worked it didnt count. 
---
What I lost was hope and excitement.  I know that might sound pretty lame to most of you, but others who very rarely have anything to look forward to in life will understand the crushing disappointment and now resentment.
---
Does that make me a sad, pathetic loser?  Probably, rationalizing the situation doesn't change my feelings.  Nothing about playing an MMORPG is rational.  We do it to escape the bullshit disappointment of reality.
---
Already contracted out, sorry bud
---
That Fortizar is not warping anywhere.
---
I got screwed out of the million SP by a matter of hours.  I am probably over reacting, but I cant stop.  I feel cheated and it's driving me crazy.
---
Hes propably talking about Erotica 1, who more than deserved it.
---
Not even sure what this rant is about
---
500MN stabber if you don't care about acceleration time.
---
The best thing you can do if you really want to do some nullsec hunting is to find a wormhole with a nullsec static that you can roll to hopefully get to an interesting region of nullsec. But that's quite the investment.
---
You do realize how long it would take you to get 14.6au from any celestial/prior bookmark? I did some napkin math the last time and it was along the lines of a few months of 23.75/7 of afk flying at Max speed. Good luck
---
Life is actually really, really hard right now, and as pathetic as it sounds, the million SP was the  biggest thing I've had to look forward to in a while.   
---
I'm still adjusting to brain damage.  It sucks not being able to control emotions anymore.
---
Agree. There are far too many meta games and other ridiculousness involved around things like this.
---
"He didn't respond to me in local within 10sec: BOT!! BURN THE BOT!!"
---
I run Tier 5 electrical + exotics and Tier 4 firestorms in an Ishtar. It's a maxed skills faction/abyssal fit with a 6/7 bill pod doing around 950 dps . The Tier 5 sites are easier than the Tier 4 firestorm. I've done easy 400 + Tier 4 but i wont attempt Tier 5 firestorms. 
---
You would probably be able to run loads of Tier 5 firestorms no problem.  Then you'll get that one site were you get massive spawns in each room and you'll just running out of time. My average time usually is around 13 minutes for a Tier 4 firestorms. I have though had sites with massive spawns in each room and ended up finishing the site in around 18/19 minutes. If it had of been a Tier 5 firestorm i would of lost my ship and pod due to the clock running out.  
---
I honestly don't think Tier 5 firestorms are worth the risk of running. Unless you can come up with a dirt cheap setup that you can afford to lose every now and again.
---
Well you *feel* cheated but you were not.
---
HA HA, like the two are mutually exclusive.
---
I know that seat is a commonly used tool for esi, though I never used it myself.
---
https://github.com/eveseat/seat
---
Getting waaaaay offgrid bookmarks doesn't really work this way. Ships warp so, so much faster than they can go sublight.
---
Let's run some numbers. You have a punisher, or garmur or whatever that goes 10km/s cap stable forever. You point it in a random direction, turn on the MWD and leave your PC. You go to work, watch TV, go to sleep and then come back 24 hours later.
---
10km/s is 36000 km/h (10*60*60).
---
36000 km/h * 24 hours = 864,000 km.
---
864,000 km is 0.0058 AU.
---
You have spent 24 hours burning just over half of one hundredth of an AU. I think I've made my point, but let's see how far you get if you leave it running for a whole year, no interruptions (not even downtimes).
---
864,000 km * 365 days = 315,360,000 km.
---
315,360,000 km is 2.108 AU.
---
Congrats, in literally an entire year you have burned a distance that you could have warped in seconds. To burn off in a direction away from any celestials to get a safe far enough away that it's not on Dscan from the nearest point any more you'd have to burn for just under *seven years*.
---
There's a reason this isn't done, outside of the old sunbounce glitches. If you want deep safes, you'll have to buy them off someone else or wait for the next time CCP breaks something fundamental with warp physics.
---
i implied you were thinking, not myself, which was probably my first mistake about interacting with you
---
you can't understand english nor think
---
Hopefully he doesn't mean burning off dscan BM's cause then, as you say, he's fecked.
---
Maybe I should have made it clear that I logged in over 16 days, but missed out on the last day due to timers.  Had CCP just told me I fucked up I would have moved on, but so many people petitioned them they responded en masse.  Stop ignoring inconvenient facts.
---
some do free for all + taxes, some have private moons only, that are available for people to rent
---
This is awesome on multiple levels.
---
&gt;And fixed some decade-long typos
---
:ccp:
---
I got everything but the 1 mil.  The 1 mil is the only prize I cared about.  I had ships ready to fly and adventures planned with the SP.  I'm moving on now.
---
Thank you!
---
Now how about some sick war propaganda and some memes on your in-game rivals!
---
Oh Omega is free now?  Cool dude.  Eat a fat dick
---
Again...daily....login. idk how u mess that up. U log in it prompts a redeem.
---
Interesting solutions, but tbh p much everything about citadels is a problem.
---
So no then.
---
I dont understand how this is so hard so grasp.  SO MANY PEOPLE GOT FUCKED OVER THEY RESPONDED TO PETITIONS EN MASSE.  Read it outloud again and again until something clicks in your brain.
---
Yeah, rigging skills are pretty clutch sometimes. I try to have them to 4.

So how do you solo a rattlesnake with a bomber?
---
It's called life.  When you believe you have enough time allocated, and you want to go see your mother for mother's day, there will be days in which one does not log in.  
---
Are you fucking retarded?  Wait dont answer that, I know the answer
---
Mostly, although there is some clarity I should add.
---
Goons were in uemon before NCPL deployed.
---
Unspoken only began coordinating with those goon sigs after being blobbed by panfam (a few days after the loss of theSAH- marginis fort would be the timeline of that). Unspoken and co responded by reffing 60 or so sov structures in Spire and malpais when the Uemon goonsigs reached out. At first, it was more of a Unspoken+co would continue operating solo (entosis, cit bashing etc) unless PH or NC were formed. Our goal was always content and good fights, and although we can often fight quite outnumbered, 10:1 is out of our reach. (Especially when one side  brings more supers and titans then we have members in fleets). 
---
But in the end, most of the conflict was fun, had a lot of really good fights.
---
apologize for poor formatting and lack of zkill links. On mobile.
---
There is no automated detection atm
---
&gt; Surely giving alliances tools to help identify them if they're going to go that route makes sense.
---
Alliances worth their salt already have this in the form of ESI.
---
24hrs in a day..takes 60seconds for my pc to boot up launh eve. I do it while my coffee pot runs. Like come on. Shits not an excuse. Everyone knew the damn rules. If u spend 24hrs with ur mum good on u. But dont blame her for u nt logging in to gt ur 1m sp.
---
There is all this talk about occupancy based timers when the solution is much easier to program, permanent timers. Once you drop the structure and set its vulnerability timer the only way to change it is to unanchor it and reanchor it. Messed it up on an ihub? Better remove it and drop a new one.
---
Does this still allow time zone tanking? Yes, but the cost of changing it just to avoid a fight isn't a week, it's the rigs. Can you still time a structure outside your time zone to avoid a hostile group? Yes, but now it's permanently vulnerable to anyone in that other time zone.

If somebody hosts it all the corps will go now we have to trust you with are data and if you release it as code all the same people will go yeah we can't host it. 
---
Quit the bullshit already like very alliance that has a rental program has the skills to do this already in alliance.
---
Thanks
---
If your corp is big enough to have significant numbers of bots, then you are big enough to find someone who can host SeAT for you.
---
Or just pull the corp wallet data from ESI (its supplied as JSON) convert it and import it into excel/google sheets and use that to check it
---
Literally every single legacy alliance has such differing approaches to moons.  I’d say a lot of them wind up in moons going unused which is a shame, especially in lower security systems that don’t populate higher quality anomalies.  
---
There’s a reason goons have built what the have.  Primarily because no one really gets in their way with a bunch of bullshit bureaucracy with regard to mining and industry stuff.
---
Mabey its politically charged in the United States? Not going to worry about the politics of a foreign country.

Without AT ships I'm pretty sure the pontifex is the best. 22.8 km/s with snakes, heat, and boosters (10.6 without). You can also make it another 25% faster with max rolled abyssal stuff. Bifrost and Magus, and new triglavian ship are close too but just slightly slower. What's really nice is that the pontifex fit is dirt cheap if you already have a snake set; the MWD is only about 250m and the rest is just T2.

First off, youre right about ER never being completely neutral. But a lot of the deals came down to getting a fight, if we were getting evicted we wanted a reasonable chance to fight the people kicking us out. The goal was to have a neutral area for small groups, and in the end it started being something like that.  
---
At first we were only blue with jag, skill, and a very small group which was rising dominion/semper fi/bow down (which were all really just one group of maybe 15 guys and lived in 2 systems). Then we blued PIBC because if we didnt wed just be evicted by their supercaps without any chance of fighting. We didnt blue the other skill u renters, but those renters were also far away so we just killed them when they were flying through ER out to their homes but didnt bother roaming out to their homes.  
---
The war with prothean left a lot of Etherium Reach empty because neither of us were big enough to actually hold all the sov, it was just a funny game of whos name is on more stuff.
---
Then Choas Theory tried moving in, they avoided fighting so we kicked them out.   
---
Then CALSF came to ER, never actually moved in though, and fought us a bunch but then stopped coming. We really wished they moved in as a neutral group, we had awesome fights with them.
---
Then  G0N3 F1SS10N moved in, we fought them but they ended up leaving. (This is where we realized we were too aggressive with new neighbors and had to start giving people breathing room).
---
Then we hit some horde rorqs and they forced an agreement to not hit their supers/rorqs because wed just be evicted by their supers and ridiculous numbers without a fight (which was what ended up kicking us out anyways). Also horde was still allowed to hit our rorqs and supers (which they did), so it wasnt a NIP.
---
Then The Moebius Group moved in and they were neutral. Learning from our past experiences with new neighbors we decided to leave their sov and structures alone until they grew. We still blew up their ships.  
---
Then La VeraCruz moved in, again they stayed neutral but we decided to let them grow and left the sov and structures alone. We still blew up their ships.
---
Then lazerhawks came in towards to help us finish off prothean and decided to stay and hit the spire with us for content so we kept them blue (option was fight them for a few fights or fight bot for a lot of fights).
---
After we killed the spire, groups like Muderous Mindset, Empyeus, and other small groups moved into the spire. They all stayed neutral but as long as they werent helping BOT we left their structures and sov alone. We still blew up their ships.
---
Then horde started escorting NC. every fleet which meant goons had to come and try to even out the numbers, but fuck those big fights. The TIDI shitfest of LXQ2 turned a lot of us off the war. We had some great fights when it was just NC. and us though (us sometimes meaning Unspoken/JAG/hawks, because NC. is still a larger group than us and can pull a lot more numbers).
---
Yeah that's normal in Delve.

How dumb are you?
---
And further requirements on groups to have a developer to play Eve is pretty shitty, especially when CCP is offloading their responsibilities to players.  If they're going to require group leaders to police their members, they really should make it easy.
---
Most of us work for a living. And you know how boring pooping at work can be, luckily there's reddit!
---
rip my jita sunbounce :(
---
Burned for three days straight to get that sucker
---
I like how at no point does it cover players unable to login due to being away from their computers at a CCP event in Russia.
---
I know you guys get given your reddit talking points from mittens but I often wonder how much you actually believe them, or if you're just being good bees.
---
Not going to lie... EvE on my phone is a terrible development for my social life and work ethic.
---
Wow! Is it computer day in the retirement home again already? Don’t get so mad you turn purple again.

If you start an abyssal site and the server cluster reboots you get a deep safe. At least you used to. Worth a shot.

~~PanFam~~ Goons brought this on themselves by shooting all the ~~alliances~~ NPCS around them.
---
Dude you are so triggered...calm your shit and get some tea.
---
Gee, what scintillating gameplay. Forensic accounting. Gag me.
---
Are you thick? 
---
I assume any alliance worth their salt already does this. We already have ESI for it.
---
they didn't hold it for their core members. up until pretty recently their members typically had to rent as well, and even now they only have a couple of constellations available for free alliance use.
---
like in all of tenal, tribute, vale and drones, only a handful of systems were used for their members until a few months ago. the space is primarily just an isk farm.
---
This bee is super cute :з
---
The unanchoring spree was probably a meme all round, but will they remember to cancel it on all the structures?
---
Mobile games are destined for failure
---
HODL
---
Yeah with no rental income to fuel your endeavors. I don't know if you have paid attention lately. Low sec is where alliances go to die. And yeah harrassing someone that has an economic advantage so great they can laugh at your attempts seems like a way of making excuses to not admit you lost the long term goal game.
---
i mean that's why i said they're not exactly the inverse. but goons have nips all the way from branch to immensea the long way round; ncpl have plenty of diplo but it's a good bit smaller, and they generally don't care about the safety of their space except insofar as it affects rental income.
---
fundamentally they choose content and pvp over safety much more than goons, albeit much less than some others.
---
You can sure insult someone while talking shit, but it can also mean you're... well... talking shit. As in saying stuff that people would disregard as nonsense or bullshit. Is that really so hard to understand?
---
Transfer it to goons we will still kill it because who gives a shit about killboard.
---
CCP Round() strikes again

So many people didn't catch the concept of log in rewards ? How retarded are you ?
---
Pathetic.

Guristas.
---
Sounds like a core area for their members to me.
---
You're going on a hard digression with your rant about "krab empire." I didn't even mention them trying to build a "krab empire." In fact, I specifically posited that their desire for the region was, most likely, spurred on by a handful of individuals in the alliance, who wanted Jita-adjacent PVE structures.
---
If you abyssal roll some of those mods you can probably make it work! The MSE and propmod for instance. The 'decaying' ones are fine for this as they are pretty cheap, at least for the MSE.
---
Only $2 a month for legacy club boiiiiiis
---
i guess i'm missing the reason why you needed to change 10/10 or 9/10 into 9/11?  other than just to be an edgelord...
---
Tbh, as far as I can tell the Chinese are oddly respectful. Most of the trash talk generated by WinterCo and friends is during EUTZ and USTZ.
---
Granted I know less Chinese than a grade schooler, but most of the angry screeching is directed against f1 monkeys rather than TEST and/or Russians.
---
Certainly, and I was in the armed forces so I’m also aware of the format DDMMMYYYY but the poor play on the 10 point rating system OP tried to reference wasn’t immediately apparent and I am from the United States so September 11, 2001 is frequently referenced as 9/11. Pretty easy to mix up.
---
Alternate caption for 3 would be a simple "FC wat do?"
---
The Spire for how long it stays independent for a bit
---
It's a shame that they're getting a feature some of us have been waiting for first though.
---
If CCP developed this "little tool," why would they give it to players? They could just run it themselves and generate a report for their GMs and/or whoever else is on the security team.
---
Never have i been more disappointet over you being wrong.
---
To be honest, I feel that the only spaces that are even remotely friendly to small groups now are low-class WHs due to the ethereal and ever-changing nature of wormhole connections.
---
Im talking about players. Players can do this. Easily.
---
This is when you anchor a cit on grid with their staging cit in your tz. Fight me in my tz to stop this cit or else.
---
What?
---
I am a memester indeed
---
Or option 3: You are a dumbfuck.
---
\~kinda is\~ did.
---
How is saying hey in the future that particular fraction could upset some people. I just want you to know that, and I think it might help you avoid a future misunderstanding if you made an effort to avoid those particular two numbers formatted like that.
---
How is that talking shit?
---
You don't care to make an effort to avoid hurting people's feelings?
---
Okay fine. 
---
But you *had* to come in and say I have PTSD and am scared of a fraction. Then you called me a PC douchebag.
---
**I have no control over your actions and if you want to act like that then I have to accept it. But I'm not going to pretend that I believe you for a second. In my personal life it has been beneficial to have tact and courtesy. I always will advise others to do the same, whether they take that advice is up to them. Up to you, if you will.**
---
Have a nice day
---
To get mouthbreathers like you to wonder about it.
---
Are you for real ?
---
Yeah well I am from Buenos Aries and I say KILL EM ALL!!
---
People who constantly say they don’t give a shit about killboards
---
Ah I know I know, I'm just being picky :p
---
Or else what
---
Sounds good. I'm looking forward to your open source code doing this.
---
NC. apparently
---
Pretty sure provi is the only null sec nrds. There are almost certainly corps active in low-sec who are generally nrds, but I could't tell you any. Eve university used to be NRDS in lowsec, but they got rid of that a long time ago. 
---
I think probably a better approach would be like a non-combat-don't-shoot. I.e. mine/haul in peace, but shoot anything else. or something like that. I dunno. Could be an interesting experiment, the issue being, if you're going to organize like that and enforce your terms on some space you might as well do it in provi where the space is better...because low sec doesn't have much going for it.
---
Again i recommend you try that thing people call "reading". The guy that said you had PTSD was someone else.
---
911 is an emergency phone number, nothing political about that you dumbskull.
---
I agree with you for what it's worth. I think the Lvl V payoffs are a bad feature of eve. Level V skills should be for that last bit of ability, not a requirement to be able to do anything. I would support T2 guns only requiring level IV of the weapon, but they would probably sell fewer skill extractors =/
---
Okay you just called me a PC douchebag. I edited it for you
---
lol I like how you linked a sotiyo that we killed well after this conflict started.
---
Wait the Yacht is for luxury travel??? Ive been using mine to blow stuff up :/
---
You jest, but I've actually heard rumours that this is the case...
---
Lmfao I just read the thread and there's like 6 other people saying "hey why the 9/11 reference though?"
---
Is that validation? It is to me
---
Yep, and i will continue to do that to anyone who tries to claim the morale highground over people they don't agree with using the *political correctness* strawman
---
Asia says Hi with their mobile playerbase.
---
I'm not claiming any moral high ground. I'm trying to help avoid people's feelings getting hurt. I didn't insult OP. If anything I said I respect his right to disagree with me.
---
You're the one on a moral high ground
---
None of this makes sense or seems funny. Can I get an explanation?
---
is there a button for cleaning the ships? what
---
&gt;Holy crap this is normal behavior for nc and pl. We dont need evidence.

I guess every Porsche 911 that came out after that date is a terrorist vehicle too right?

---
not really, i'm not "anti" nor "pro" anyone.
---
Build your own battleship
---
yes, proving my point here bud
---
In my experience that tends to change over time.
---
In other MMO's I've played, as the Chinese population rises anti-Chinese sentiment rises with them. Eventually there's enough racial tension for both sides to get disgustingly nasty.
---
Or else they have a hostile cit on grid with their staging. That is typically a Very Bad Thing.
---
"How many levels of political correctness are you on?"
---
"Five or six. You?"
---
"Check this out:"
---
&gt;some numbers are inherently political
---
its where the money is in 2019
---
der... yup they would be do that. 
---

---
Yeah he said nothing. You’re welcome.
---

---
In my experience they just turtle up and wait for you to get bored. You may have a citadel in their system but you still can't attack theirs in a meaningful way.
---
hey im in this screenshot
---
If i put up a public tool, ever corp in eve will go yeah i'm not submitting all my members ESI key's to you because the rightfully distrust me not to use this data to get dank killmails, if i make the code well the response is now we have to get webhosting to have this tool. 
---
The reality is even with building the tool the reality is the motivation among alliances to deal with the issue just isn't there.
---
I agree with the sentiment, but at the same time having tools available in the game would be a great step in the right direction. Alone it might make a small or sizable difference, buy with many different such steps together, that difference will become cumulative and noticable on a practical scale.
---
There is no reason to have to jump thru so many hoops and not have this in the game already other than CCPs lack of planning, forethought etc.
---
Not if you buy this 600 gem package which includes a 24 hour 2x isk booster. You will surely gain an advantage and not fail then.
---
With capacitor like that, probably
---
Not making much of a point then
---
I know where I'm going to start roaming.
---
And this is why you aren't a CEO.
---
Then why are you guys crying on reddit over it?
---
This is the same subreddit that asked how to sell a hanger full of corpses right?
---
not that hard either, just harder than most NPC regions.
---
When I die in new and exciting ways I message the person about how they did it and GF.
---
I lost a Prospect the other day and had a good chat with the person that killed me, had a nice chat about our surrounding wormhole connections and their very effective dual box hunting strategy.
---
Ying and yang, me ninja gas huffing is someone else hunting, someone else exploring is my hunting, you can’t get upset, we provide for each other.
---
Pretty much this. Even if there was a super high speed tool that let you see at a glance who was ratting 23/7 alliances wouldn’t use it.
---
The problem is willful ignorance is rampant and people will constantly go back to “it’s not my job to police bots, it’s CCP’s”
---
...and it is. Unless you’re the leader of a mega alliance with access to that information and an active position against botting but still refuse to do anything about it.
---
Oh man, the scales have fallen from my eyes. Doing unpaid volunteer work for a for-profit company is why I am "not a CEO."
---
Your Karmafleet minion already pointed tools out that provide you with that data. No clue if they're opensource but i don't care either. I neither play eve anymore nor do i have the need for such a tool.  
---
But doing api calls isn't rocket science, even if you don't work as a developer so don't try pretending it is.
---
Thanks for the explanation on missile physics. That’s good to know when thinking through fits. The paper range is almost always not true in practice I guess unless the enemy is sitting still or burning towards you sitting still.
---
I guess because it was a PS exclusive (what usually comes with a price), much of the financial risk for the developement could be outsourced to Sony.
---
Can confirm. Every Chinese member of FRT I’ve interacted with has been cool.  They simply expect others to follow the “rules” such as they are, and help out when needed.
---
No, but being on grid means you can drop drag bubbles, kill cynos, and be an all-around pest with near total impunity.
---
Also used for rolling wormholes.
---
If these tools exist, CCP can run them, much more effectively than we could ever do. Trying to shuffle this sort of make-work on players is about as idiotic as fake videogame moral grandstanding for a game you don't even play.
---
:/ that doesn't feel like good game play, I'm not trying to be entitled but I want to get a fight. The best strategy is boredom for defense though.
---
It does work the opposite way if you can - as a missile ship - get your opponent to chase you, it effectively increases the range of your missiles by the same mechanism. It's one of the nuances of EVE mechanics that can easily be forgotten, but has a huge impact on how fights play out, so glad I was able to elucidate the concept for you.
---
i am honestly confused... is the one on the right a female?
---
If you get the chance to try it, it is quite fun. When the north came south to support winterco like 6 months ago their main staging fort had a tapierium fort on grid.
---
Sitting on tether in a fessor and killing their cynos or any fleet stragglers was a great time for a few weeks. People tend to relax and be stupid in their staging and hunting them is a good time.
---
Evidence suggests you are wrong, maybe Eve mobile well not be the next big thing, but overall mobile game are here to stay.
---
It’s not a bad thing, I don’t know why people get upset.
---
I'm blaming the unclear description that made me miscalculate the number of days and hence the level of prioritization I needed to have.  You all talk like I'm the sole person who was confused.  If that was the case I'd just move on.  
---
In case the title wasn't clear, IT WAS THE MASS RESPONSE that made me quit.  Clearly there was confusion.  I'm happy you all got the rewards, and honestly quite confused with how bitter most of you are about this post.
---
Best of luck with escaping the game, don't give away too much because everyone comes back at some point or another...
---
Oh, I agree. Fuck actually doing CCPs job lol. OP wanted feature, I gave feature.
---
Canceled my account before I posted this.  Not asking for the SP.  Wouldnt come back if they gave it.  I dont understand what you think my issue is, but the title was pretty fucking clear.
---
Do want, and maybe if could read out some info after a skill dependent delay about what type of guns are on it and number of killmarks etc., stuff you can already see, just more convenient.
---
The proof of the mass petitions is in the fact they sent out a mass response.  Was that not clear from my original post?
---
You don't submit it to a third-party. You can host it locally. You only need a single persons ESI that has read access to corp wallet.
---
I bet people love gaming with you and your shining personality.
---
theoretically you can go as fast as you like, all you need is a bunch of command destroyers, each one adds to your speed a little less than 600m/s, so running 100 dessies would give you almost 60km/s velocity.

its not like they are gone when we killed em you know... and iam sure they wont stop doing what they do which leads to where we are now :) you got fun north we have fun south.
---
That's a one-time effort. What is being demanded ITT is a continuous body of work, ever growing, never ceasing, for the entire lifetime of the organization in question.
---
It's not like herding structures, where the structure ostensibly benefits your people and can be decommissioned if it's too much bother to maintain. It's noisome make-work that has to be done all the time to avoid penalty. It has to be done by every single organization in the game, no matter the size, or risk censure (in a timeline where CCP requires it to occur, not right now.) It has to be done from a position of inferior information and requires a degree of skill or knowledge that can't always be relied upon to exist. It's an orgiastic clusterfuck and I can't believe that actual, breathing human beings consider themselves rational or even mildly sapient and still think it's a good idea.
---
Thats not make work on players. He wants a feature he has the means to do himself and others already did but he wants CCP to direct ressources towards it instead.
---
They actually do indeed
---
Damn, I never thought I'd upvote every comment you made in a chain Querns.
---
I agree it doesn't appear to be the poster's intent.... Now quite how simple-minded you'd need to be to be oblivious to the WTC reference when posting this is beyond me! Makes me wonder... If this poster would only lend me his brain, I could finish building my idiot.
---
this is actual a well written comment!
---
That's the pretense, sure.
---
It's been 18 years now. This guy could have been born right after it happened and be old enough to post here. And if hes not from the U.S. even more so.
---
Goon pets dont smile
---
it's not a one-time effort cause you get new recruits every day. 
---
i also didn't compare it to herding structures either, not sure why you brought that up in this discussion. its literally a ratting scrub and flag system, and then have some middle management nerd go out and verify (and get his shiny discord title) and maybe light a friendly cyno for wibla to do his wibla thing. 
---
&gt;It's an orgiastic clusterfuck and I can't believe that actual, breathing human beings consider themselves rational or even mildly sapient and still think it's a good idea.
---
Have you met rorqual miners? bazinga.
---
It makes sense -- you have actual experience running an organization, so what I'm saying resonates with you. Most of the knuckledraggers trying to foist this nonsense on players either have no experience running an organization, or are using it as a bloody shirt because they hate $ORGANIZATION. Or both, I guess.
---
+1 for pontifex. I was going to post my fit but it's basically the same as yours. The self-boosting skirmish command is super useful for going so fast you go plaid.
---
I'm pretty sure this game is doomed but an anime spaceship waifu game (think Azur Lane or Girls Frontline) has endless profit potential. Would rather have a gacha game that actually makes a profit than another CCP game destined for the dumpster
---
Damn man wish I could kite like yourself nice vid man.
---
&gt;it's not a one-time effort cause you get new recruits every day. 
---
It's a one-time effort per recruit. Once you complete that work, it's over. Subsequently, if mandated monitoring of player wallet ticks is a thing, adding that player increases the workload of your forensic accountants permanently, every day, forever.
---
I mentioned structures not because anyone else mentioned them, but to head off their use as a "what if" pre-emptively. It's a similar manifold to this problem.
---
My children are &lt;18 and understand the WTC reference. Education is important in the UK as is honouring the dead... Lest we forget and all that.
---
Like I said though, you can have an automated system that checks and flags suspect players, and then get a wibla or wibla-wannabe to go out and verify. Dangle enough shinies or pay them in a negligible amount of ISK and there you go, you have your manpower.
---
My point being, it's a easy mistake to make here. Especially with our 10/10 would do again jokes. He should have done 11/10 as the joke but he didn't deserve the rage he got. I've seen people ingame make much worse reference to that tragedy and no one says a damn thing.
---
Gégé bien joué. Ils sont en train de pêter un cable.

everyone is talking about income... there is a point in eve where isk dont realy matter anymore...  i have no idea when i was the last time active creating isk... i got a super a titan all doctrines ships al lot of fun shit and a lot more crap lying around settling dust.  
---
The only income important is basicly fuel and some stuff in structures and rigs which can build those dudes want to make isk. WE are not and never have been relying on a steady renter income to keep us pvp active
---
NC. deployed supers to the region after the sotiyo. They killed the faction fort and then brought the supers home. When we made it clear we werent going to stop even after our faction fort died, NC. redeployed with regular caps and subcaps and had horde support them. Goons helped us during the redeployment which evened out the fights, so horde moved their supers in to put the fights completely in their favor.
---
I don't know if I would even call that a fit. . . . .
---
Wait, what? Since when? Most recent downtime?
---
BIG
---
IF 
---
TRUE
---
Oh? And where is this automated system that checks and flags? Got any open source solutions, or is every organization in Eve that is more than one human being large have to have a programmer with enough skills to command six figures IRL among their membership?
---
How can you not see how ridiculous an ask this is?
---
More or less all of npc null that isn't stain

No idea. Reflexively typed a system with 2 letters and a dash in there and it actually showed search results. Tried a few different systems and works like it used to \o/

Supply va demand, no one wants em, and they’re a bitch to get
---
I mean, there's no official system for screening recruits but here we are in 2019 with tools like SeAT and ESIKnife. Pretty sure you can adapt yourself some addons for bot-checking. Any programmers feel free to chime in and tell me how wrong and how much of a retard i am.
---
That said, I don't believe organizations should be additionally penalized for having botters in their midst. Neg-walleting the ratting taxes is fine enough, IMO.

I was in NC..... 😑 Please let's not act like moons weren't a thing before that NC held for income or this blob of space up north that was rented out.  That's why all those line members had alts in WERMT. Having a super and titan and faces and doctrine ships don't come cheap. Let's be real NC/PL hasn't fought anyone since taking Tribute from  CO2 and Test just abandoned Vale. So these little sideshow fights you show up really don't mean anything.

Could somebody explain what the feature is, I honestly don’t get it.
---
Oh shit fam didn't know you do vids. Awesome.
---
I'm a programmer. You can't just "adapt yourself some addons for bot-checking." It requires a significant amount of expertise. Large corporations pay big bucks for exactly this sort of expertise. You're not going to walk down the street and stumble across the sort of person who A) plays eve, 2) has the required expertise, and iii) will do it for free. Heck, I've been writing code for 25 years, professionally for 15 of those, and I'm not confident I could do the job justice. It's an interesting project, to be sure, but I sure as hell ain't doing it under pain of censure or banishment. Y'all can fuck right off with that.
---
Also, the vignette being used here (and threatened by CCP Peligro) is that you will be **punished** for not doing it. A punishment levied by CCP. CCP doesn't punish you for failing to do adequate recruitment checks. Please stop using recruitment as an analogue here. It doesn't work.
---
cant speak for all of nc.... and i can say iam a long member of nc with actual 6 Years there.  You maybe not wrong since iam not this into alliance lvl's of income but we where basicly already stuffed with isk pre B-R and shortly after still :)

This alliance should have never stopped being a nomadic fighting force. So many friends from the early years stopped playing over the current meta. 😔

Selected Item panel has an orbit camera of the target so you can keep one eye on the enemy ship as well as having your main display be anything you want.
---
Lets you quickly see what weapons they have fitted and makes combat a bit more cinematic without having to nerf your own display by clicking "view target" then going back to default display.
---
Only practical way to get its bpc is through Mordu's Legion LP, which can also be used for Garmur or Orthus bpc, and both of them are very popular and oppressive hulls thus the demand is high.

Yeah, but really the drop rate and return/time isn't very promising, that's why I said the practical way is thru LP store.
---
Huge if verifiable
---
Okay, let me ask you this as if I was a client:
---
What kind of effort would it take to include a plugin/addon/whatever to SeAT that flags characters that have been ratting for 23/7 consistently (or a custom time period) and throws them up on a separate page, wherein a user with the correct permissions can log in and see? Can this information be pulled with a few ESI endpoint calls?
---
&gt;Also, the vignette being used here (and threatened by CCP Peligro) is that you will be punished for not doing it.
---
Was it ever specified what the "punishment" would be? If it's just neg-walleting the ratting tax after every botting ban wave, why is that bad?
---
Gib isk
---
Kind of and kind of not? I mean, most people wouldn't mind their *extra* special members dying after disobeying rather simple instructions, but there are full-blown spodbrains who seriously believe that their shit blowing up makes them stronger.
---
What you're describing with your SeAT addon is a view on data. This can be done trivially, but it still requires a human or humans to review that data every day. This is an insane ask for a video game. My schpiel on "significant amount of expertise" was about a program that could flag the bots by itself.
---
It was never specified what the punishment would be, but CCP Peligro using it as a threat implies that it would be a punishment that goes above and beyond the existing negwalleting that occurs today.
---
That's not what 9 out of 11 means in this context. XD
---
Damn, I feel sorry for you, spending your waking hours looking for stuff to get offended about.
---
We’re giving ER to Slyce, and Slyce is practically dead. There will be plenty of room for smaller alliances as long as they don’t do something dumb like blow up a Sotiyo or batphone goons.
---
the drop rate from the spawn is 100%.
---
The spawn itself is rare and unpredictable.
---
No keep it out. We are only a few more days away from another fuck up
---
&gt;This can be done trivially, but it still requires a human or humans to review that data every day.
---
Can be done once a week after reviewing more data, too. Or once a month. Or like I said, "hire" nerds who actually want to do that. It is an insane ask for a video game, absolutely, and I would never waste my time with that...but there are autists out there that would jump at the opportunity to feel space important.
---
&gt;It was never specified what the punishment would be, but CCP Peligro using it as a threat implies that it would be a punishment that goes above and beyond the existing negwalleting that occurs today.
---
Eh, I wouldn't read into it more than negwalleting the taxes, BUT im also not naive enough to believe that it wouldn't be anymore than that. With CCP you can never be too sure. Anything further than negwalleting is retarded.
---
Does 5 really make that much difference?
---
Welcome to EVE Online young one.
---
Thanks dude!
---
Putting a feature like this in game puts the onus on players to then use it or be found "guilty of **knowingly** harboring bots" by CCP if they don't somehow act on the data they have, either by kicking the suspected bots from corp or reporting the bots to CCP.  The problem is, it's not the players' job to police CCP's game for them.  The game is enough of a time-sink as it is without having to administrate the persecution of bots for CCP.  CCP needs to dedicate real time, money, and manpower to the botting problem to solve it and look upon players' reporting of bots purely as a courtesy.  
---
If CCP does implement a thing like his then they need to be clear that its use is not mandatory for fear of disciplinary action, and that it is simply a tool to help players provide CCP the courtesy of reporting bots.
---
DANK CONTENT

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

i'm confused.  are you looking for an area where people blue each other up and have fake fights without messing with sov / cits?

Is it a hybrid guns Tengu? Maybe you do not have Rapid Firing maxed out resulting in less capacitor usage by the guns?

---
The new expansion. How long do you think the server will be down? Lol
---
I should do more study then, never hanging around pure blind long enough. So you are saying there are some random spawn legion rats going to drop the bpc 100%? Is it like some specific diamond rat or officer rat only?
---

Speaking from experience, this wellspring of work falls flat faster than you know.
---
Large if correct
---
Every bit helps. I have 195m SP so I have to train *something*.
---
Not debating that. Just the size doesnt matter part. (In eve)
---
Yes, the spawns occur in lowsec. They're not diamond rats, just called "Mordus Special Operative" or something along those lines in either a garmur/orthrus/barghest. If you kill that ship, it will 100% drop the BPC of the ship you killed.
---
I bet you stick your fingers in your ears when people have 1488 units of fuel or whatever in their AT loss mails too, huh?
---
If you are only just  cap stable and you don't stagger modules, it can lead to capping out.
---
If the bot matches a human players habits it's not really getting the kind of advantage people go after with bots
---
If you live in Provi for some time and have numbers behind you, being active in fleets etc etc, you can end up with given sov.
---
Significant if right
---
First time heard that :D , thanks for sharing!
---
Im 100% sure that CCP has the tools available to be able to identify bots. Active for at least 23 hours per day and receiving  bounties consistently during that time shouldn't be that hard to pull from whatever database they use.
---
Geminate content, best content. Thank you, come again.
---
Do you not have a phone, guy?
---
Other pirate BS can be farmed by running anomalies and escalations in sov nullsec; Mordus ships can only be farmed by running missions out of one specific NPC station in Pure Blind or by hitting the jackpot when belt ratting in lowsec.
---
Not really, there are 2 samples?
---
For sure it's happened, but it's not a thing that occurs that often. Twice isn't really more than anecdotal. 
---
Anecdote is not data.
---
The spawn rate for the Mordus Legion rats in lowsec is hard to come by in and of itself, but Mordus also only has like 2 level 4 agents in their systems for the entire faction, so unlike Sansha/Angel/Gurista LP they can't be easily farmed.
---
You are quite funny.
---
Just make more bots then, not much of a challenge.
---
No, dude, if no one wants one, you have to sell yours for a higher and higher price so you make up for the loss in demand by getting just one successful scam! Duh! /s?
---
No because the collective autism of the players will find a way to abuse it before it's even implimented.
---
The fuck does 1488 reference?
---
my ps3 collects dust, if that counts
---
Just what a Corp CEO wants to do, the developers job in their game.
---
Just what a Corp CEO wants to do when the login to play a game, the developers job.
---
Tdf? Nga?
---
Yeah a lot of the smooth brain thinking around this topic revolves around the idea that you just need One Simple Metric and all the bots will be caught and banned forever.
---
Guess what the first thing bots are going to change is going to be.
---
If you adjust the faucets and sinks both then the problem won’t get any better, still lots of inflation. I could be onboard with sinks like taxes/brokers fees/asset safety/manufacturing fees etc being tied to something. Not sure if PLEX is the best thing to tie it to though. I’d rather it be tied to something more concrete like total new eden GDP, or total isk in game or something.
---
I think the answer is getting isk out of the game and not boosting faucets.
---
Doubt it.
---
There is a hisec system where I swear that 2 chars have never logged-off for a year or more.
---
Important if positive

What do you mean by staggering?

Somebody with your username pushing echochamber lead paint laced reddit koolaide 🤔

no no you need to put quotes around the bug or someone will think you're complaining and remove it again
---
These events have always ended at downtime. Always.
---
Because if it was stolen, you would be posting that it was stolen, not positing some ridiculous hypothetical to win internet points on reddit dot com.
---
You can only boosh once a tick, so this caps out at 100km/s + whatever MWD speed.
---
No.
---
The reason why the inflation is kicking off more and more is because the faucets of isk into the game are more accessible than ever. Carriers make 150m/hr, Supers make 300m+, Rorquals are still hugely scalable, etc. Coupled with a lot more uses for plex these days other than just righ-click -&gt; add game time, its a perfect blend of reasons as to why the prices are spiking.
---
Adjusting the NPC bounties and Mission Rewards to match PLEX prices will do nothing to alleviate this, [because its an issue of money supply.](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/tWWzngWbGPYGtE57HSLrO/5208b051293a5ca4e8fbb18a9c45ab93/9b_isk.float.3.png) Since 2015, the money supply has increased from 700T to 1300T isk; an increase of 46%. Rather than increasing the amount of isk pouring into the game, [CCP has been trying to constrict the bounty prize faucet since its the largest offender.](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3SSuZT2QzNHe2qaWMLiiDt/1dc9e65f98188bd80dda71365e9e06f9/9aaa_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png) And honestly? Good for them, its a nice start, but it needs way more isk sinks in order to control the inflation that Eve has.

Delete all insurance payouts. Make insurance not exist anymore would help

Goons are willing to sit through alot to fuck PL, I tell you hwat
---
IDK, maybe they should change it then. It is awkward as hell to have it end at downtime since it is in the middle of the UTC day.
---
Precisely, there needs to be more worthwhile sinks that take cash out of the game. [The sinks are barely covering 2/3 of the amount of isk coming from the faucets at the moment.](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/4aEmnvffst3ilL9hSHTaK7/4fd848a14dd2f0b4591eeb3dcbb71a7c/9a_sinksfaucets.png) They are trying to alleviate some of that isk coming back into the game by nerfing anom spawn rates to constrict the bounty faucet and reduce insurance payments for caps, but there needs to be more done on that front.
---
I'm rather surprised that industry job taxes are so low compared to reaction taxes all in all. We'd likely need to see taxes in general rise as a way of controlling the money supply, or adding some other form of material goods that can be exchanged for isk that can absorb money and remove it from the game.
---
And for the US, it tends to be "before we wake up", but the game is a worldwide game, there's never going to be a perfect place to put it, and presumably it's mechanically most feasible to do it when you're shutting the server down anyways.
---
k fam
---
Manufacturing fees already scale with the amount of manufacturing being done in a system, broker fees went out the window with citidels, taxes only punished people who are in NPC corps which no longer is useful because of the wardec changes, ans asset safety is already based off the market value of the items, so it scales as long as PLEX isn't the only thing increasing in price.
---
https://i.imgur.com/EPZLfJH.png
---
I had the same thing:(
---
[Insurance counted for only 4.2T isk entering the game in April.](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/4aEmnvffst3ilL9hSHTaK7/4fd848a14dd2f0b4591eeb3dcbb71a7c/9a_sinksfaucets.png) This sounds like a lot, but the total combined faucets vs sinks is 98.4T vs -65.1T. Deleting insurance entirely would barely put a dent into it and likely disincentivize risk-taking with pvp for poorer players or marginal groups. You're much less likely to drop a suicide FAX or dread or escalate with them if you're going to lose them entirely with the possibility of also not doing anything.

None of the marketing material for this game has been in English. I doubt we're the target audience.
---
So how often do i need to roll to get Vanquisher from gacha on mobile? Asking for a friend
---
That will just create runaway inflation. Better to fix NPC bounties and solidify a ceiling for PLEX prices.
---
If people are no longer able to afford to PLEX their accounts they'll stop buying PLEX. When they do, PLEX prices will drop until people can afford it again. If this change is implemented then people can just keep driving the price of PLEX up and up and up and up and up, and do the same to NPC bounties until TQ becomes Serenity, 30Bn PLEX and all.
---
Just train with using reddit on mobile
---
That would just lead to increased risk aversion, which is a bad enough problem as is. You get rid of insurance and the sink that is the loot fairy will drop too.
---
That's probably more to do with CCP still struggling to make their event promotions quite clear in English, tbf. 20th May BTW
---
When the mobile game is based on a successful, but of narrow interest PC game, is it though?  I have trouble seeing the EVE crowd move to mobile.  Mobile games tend do well because of a large number of casual players
---
Your first point is important but I'd like to see data before I believe it. (How would you measure that? Maybe identify evictions somehow and then check for active characters 2 months before whether those characters are active in w-space 2 months after?)
---
Your second point... I said "unlimited numbers **of capitals**". And I was talking about day-to-day wormhole life.
---
This entire event was to inflate login metrics, CCReee doesn't give two shits if you got your reward.
---
From the title, I really expected this thread to be about the default overview ... wishful thinking.
---
lmao get fucked
---
Just because it isn't your style of fight doesn't make it fake.
---
Vast if confirmed
---
Don’t activate them all at once, leave a few seconds between activation
---
Someone is always going to be tz fucked. Lots of games time stuff like this to uszt, middle of the night in eu, people complain then too. 
---
Someone will always complain even though they get free stuff for basically nothing.
---
I think at this stage its clear that allowing for the removal of brokerage fees in citadels (or diverting them to the citadel owner) was a mistake. Its a good idea in practice, but its not helping control the inflation, just keeping the money in circulation.
---
&gt;ans asset safety is already based off the market value of the items, so it scales as long as PLEX isn't the only thing increasing in price.
---
Well... that might be troublesome depending on the item. Certain items are increasing in value (moon products and their derivatives) but a lot of basic stuff has imploded in value due to unmitigated Rorqual mining. The only thing I could say for certain is increasing in value constantly is anything tied to the PLEX market (injectors, extractors, MTC, some limited run skins).
---
um k
---
Why are you so bitter?
---
Gotcha yeah I’ll try that thank you 😊
---
CCP should put a big red X over the final reward day so that these entitled yet somehow lazy players will figure it out sooner that they fucked up
---
Warden president.
---
I just enjoy reading all the salt from people not being able to follow basic instructions, thinking they are entitled to free stuff without doing anything for it
---
Weeeeee, weeeeee, i didnt get freee stuufffff weeeeeee weeeeee
---
Not only that but there was a days remaining indicator on the claim thing anyway
---
It's a white supremacy dog whistle. No idea why the other fellow is talking about it like it's a 4chan prank, neo Nazis get it tattooed to them.
---
Just go away, seriously no one gives a fuck
---
Should have transferred it to the army of the mangos
---
Yes but in an inverse relationship: the higher the PLEX price, the lower the bounties and mission rewards are.
---
In a N+1 super fight, faction caps/supers don't matter as much as people think they do
---
Who stole it
---
What do you make doing these?
---
Yep, shadow serp istabs I think.
---
Its possible that their playtime is around downtime and they just leave their account running when they aren't playing
---
You used the search bar? LOL!!! noob
---
Kill boards l m a o
---
One if the funniest exchanged I heard was a rorq that was tackled comes into comms, totally calm and is like, "I'm tackled, but I have this guy scrammed and I'm killing him", the umbrella jumps into action, amd the rorq continues Killin the guy, while repping the FAX, and super that jumped to him
---
Lol i have no ides what actualnhappened there it was s pl keep
---
it's usually leaked and posted to reddit within about 10 minutes of it ending, this time I think it took about 30 minutes.
---
Weapon specialisations are quite ok. Weapon Upgrades was a problem as the advanced skill doesn't even effect the same attributes. It's good they fixed that.
---
But I still had the PG available. Look at the fitting screen in the background.
---
Someone else in this thread did some math and extrapolating it up to 14au would be like 7 years at 10k/s 24/7.
---
What you did, I see!
---
And hookers, and drugs
---
Holy shit, apparently some people got butthurt, sort by controversial to see the dumpster fire
---
What’s a DNG and why do I care? Are you feeling ok? Maybe a stroke coming?
---
svipul can maintain 9km/s without heat, implants or drugs with a cheap abyssal one (decayed compact 50mn)   
---
with implants, 12km/s without drugs, 17.5km/s hot
---
Transparency. Especially within corps and alliances. Just look at this subreddit alone how many complaints there are about lack of identifying tools. This would alleviate a lot of these.
---
Sure ultimately it's on CCP, but with everyone becoming more aware it will make it harder for them to operate.
---
365 days a year?
---
oh my fucking god who ever did this thank you so fucking much
---
True. Never thought about it like that. I never insure anything anyways. Probably should. But I fly too many different things.
---
Dissing on the chinese, russians, thats ok... But dare to say anything about 11th of September, oh boy ...
---
I guess it's EVE right?
---
True never thought about that. I never insure anyways. I don’t mind throwing dreads for fun or even a super but I can see from “the little guys” perspective. Increase titan/super minerals lol
---
I hear tribute is about to receive some Freedom :)
---
Same with mine, except its not on the screenshot. Its just a rounding error.
---
I'm talking about everyone else who got banned
---
6-100. Structure bashing
---
Over in Winnie Pooh´s kingdom yes. They´re hogwild fer mobile games, maybe because the state wants them to have their mobile machines around and close by to surveil?
---
I mostly run or participate in small gang fleets with my corp, either scheduled/pinged or just adhoc in our comms. We also occasionally play games that aren't eve.
---
A lot of people in Dreddit just krab and go on stratops and do alliance shit, but there's a core group that likes to fly their own ships and get dank solo kills.
---
Ok buddy
---
Well, if the pc version is just click click click. then i'm pretty sure you can tap tap tap.
---
Made as a school project.
---
Apologies if other people's art was used, if you recognize your art or someone else's, please tell me so they can be credited.
---
What’s the percentage difference in damage output between a minimally skilled pilot and a max skilled one? ie a meta 4 weapon used by a pilot with lvl 1 in the associated skill vs a pilot with lvl V in that skill and all supports?
---
Fat if factual
---
There are no supers in wormholes.
---
And, Bob willing, there never will be.
---
Dont be mean ill have you know im a level 69 enchanter
---
E.R. was never actually nuetral lol but provi is fairly nuetral tbh
---
But spaghetti legacy code.....
---
If ccp hired someone to read/change legacy code. The planets would all line up and fall into the sun. We would all die
---
I don't envy your teachers...
---
I believe it was either a dramiel or a cruor, but one of the two can just barely fit a 50MN Digital Booster MWD, while leaving a low slot for another Overdrive. Combined with 3 speed rigs and it hit just over 12km/s.
---
&gt;Change my mind POS
---
No. POSes were a lot more fun to fight over and around. 
---
Couldn't stay docked and spin ships in a POS though.
---
You're forgetting one other benefit:
---
POSes are limited to one per moon.
---
fuck I do miss the guristas rats, it was like clubbing baby seals.
---
It was headquarters in Nullsec, so about 45 mil per site
---
You want a really deep safe?
---
Old school - siege dredd at sun.
---
Got nerfed. No matter _how_ far out you get, CCP will reel you (and your bookmark) back in to no further than a predetermined distance away from the outermost site in the system.
---
Better grab a ticket mate
---
It was actually pretty fun. I even got to cut a move op in half. They had to relit to move the last few dread through. It was unironically a good time.
---
Someone tripped over the big ethernet cable again
---
Content is what you make of it. For me, it was a fun couple of weeks.
---
I’m already anti asset safety so I’m biased in this admittedly, but Asset Safety could be a much bigger sink than it is.
---
As long as they clean the windows I'm happy
---
I guess there was a lot lost in translation and people’s standards for humor is quite low. It doesn’t seem funny or clever in any way.
---
You can look through https://github.com/bravecollective . I'm pretty sure everything we use is in there (including https://github.com/bravecollective/moon-mining-manager , which Brave uses to "tax" moon goo).
---
What is Eve Infinite Galaxy?
---
Introduce negwalleting a corp/alliance for member botting and you will have people making offensive bot alpha characters within minutes.
---
Clearly you never attacked a dickstar before (POS that has nothing but hardeners and such to make it as annoying to kill as possible).
---
Ty, I’ll take a look through this later tonight after work.
---
No way!?
---
Grand if certain
---
It had ewar too retard
---
`yet`
---
That happens when you play Solitaire in the other screen.
---
Lol that's how you get hyperinflation.
---
Plex increases because isk is pumped in the economy. Now you wanna pump more isk. Guess what happens next.
---
Pretty sure they don't want to draw the eve crowd away to the mobile game.
---
No worries man :)
---
Did they announce another?
---
Just watch, this happened with pubg mobile also. The mobile version of the game got all these cool features months before they were in the main game. Hell, there are all kinds of quality-of-life features that are in pubg Mobile than never even made it into pubg on PC or console.
---
I fully expect the mobile version of Eve online will have stuff like streaming mode, better loot collection from each shipwreck, customizable or Corporation skins, more interesting PVE, and of course all kinds of modern UI optimizations.
---
Eve Infinite Galaxy
---
Even merely thinking of opening that part of the codebase awakens the eldritch gods
---
Dickstars were only a problem for subcaps, if you brought dreads or supers (which were 100% ewar resistant) you could defang the POS ez
---
They already negwallet right now mate.
---
Since we have terribly short memories... POSes were across the board worse.
---
Citadels allow docking, refitting, insurance, clones, unlimited storage space, corp hangars, markets, repairs , and tethering. POSes pale in comparison.
---
POSes were much to fight over either. Especially after supers got long range Fighter Bombers and could actually RF POSes themselves. Sure every now and then a moon campaign would kick off and content would happen. The other 98% of the time POSes provided 0 content.
---
Like it or not, FozzieSov fulfilled EVERY condition the players asked for prior to implementation. People cheered at what FozzieSov brought until they played it. Citadels, after a few patches, fulfilled almost EVERY condition the players asked for prior to implementation. Again, people cheered for Citadels until we started using them.
---
Turns out we are terrible at coming up with requirements for CCP to implement. Instead of complaining about what once was, we need to figure out how to improve what we have.
---
First, the only people denying SOV Nullsec fights are SOV nullsec players. You all are terrible at taking fights. What's so wrong with losing ships? WHers whelp 20 bil isk in a fight and do it again the next night, and the next night, and the next night. We aren't even fighting over anything. Why can't you do the same? Take the fight. Lose ship. It's 1s and 0s in a server anyways.
---
Second, your complaint isn't with POSes but moon mining. POSes were not a content generator. No one woke up and said "I can't want to RF a random POS today!" They woke up and said "Taking that R64 will give my alliance 1 bil isk a month for SRP.. Let's go RF it!" I get that content isn't there anymore because players asked for moon goo to be actively mined (see... aren't we terrible at requirements?) so the line members could get the isk. Now there is nothing that provides and alliance resources that an FC to fight over. That's what needs to come back.
---
I w
---
Why didn't anybody get excited?
---
&gt; I also realized that wasn't the person's intent who posted it
---
I would prefer someone to be honest than to pretend they totally didn’t know what they were doing. No one is buying it.
---
That said, I’m not losing my shit over this. Just rolling my eyes at yet another 14 year old edgelord on internet. 🙄
---
Dirt n Glitter bud, holy shit
---
Yeah I mean if he did do that intentionally I would think they are younger. I do wonder how many teens play eve these days though. Cant be that many.
---
pretty sure they'll do that regardless
---
According to jestertrek ccp was afraid DUST514 would cannibalize the eve playerbase (omegalul) so I wonder what they thought their playerbase's attitude towards this mobile junk would be.
---
Reported for ableist slur
---
This is how you Eve!
---
pain in the ass to find though sorta like officer chaining etc
---
Begging for isk on r/eve... I've seen it all.
---
I guess the server wasn't ready for your FCs to feed 5 HACs every tick.
---
Who are they allied to?
---
Haha worth a shot got to go far and wide to get what you need
---
I think this is the problem. You believe this started when NC deployed, which was a reaction to Unspoken working with goons.
---
Unspoken began working with goons when Panfam would bring 300-400 dudes to our doorstep.
---
This happened before NC deployed.
---
It could also be your VPN shitting the bed.  They're onto you! MR DALLIARD MR DALLIARD WE'VE BEEN ACTIVATED!
---
Have you seen a man eat his own head?
---
Yay, war is back on boys! Our march North can continue again! (We may have gotten a bit lost, oops)
---
Guardians with rohks...
---
*aneurism*
---
Setting up one of these was super aids too.
---
Indeed, just follow the code, and you can mine in peace.
---
Have you tried begging in jita? Lots of legit isk doublers there.
---
This is how it works in real life, I suspect because suppliers have an incentive to sell their stock as it is a liability for them. In eve however this isn't the case and pretty much the only reason you'd want to lower your selling price is if someone else is undercutting you, less people selling an item means less undercutting going on and higher prices.
---
dont you fit plates to your maledictions
---
No due to FW I get shot on sight
---
Yeah it’s depressing watching the average age of players in this game just get older and older...
---
Game truly is dying.
---
supply and demand stops working at the far end of the low demand curve, for niche items that aren't easily sourced
---
if demand were higher, more people would run soe missions (or convert concord to soe) and sell more barghests, but it's not, so relatively few get produced because there's no money in those
---
as a result, for the few souls unfortunate enough to have burned their lp on them, they get to dictate the price because no one else is willing to
---
it's like trying to find a laserdisc player in good condition. they're not really worth anything, and nobody has a real use for them, but there aren't just a whole lot of them, so they can be difficult to find and they usually aren't cheap
---
thank you CCP &lt;3 xoxoxo
---
Upvoted
---
Nice job!
---
And who are they even in the first place?
---
I was 17 when I started. I'm 29 now. :-/. 
---
Havent played for a few years myself. After injectors I was done. That seemed to ruin the sense of "real loss" the game felt like until then.
---
This isn't unfortunate product of blue donut 70k coalition
---
Ty :)
---
CCP negwallets individual player wallets, not corporate or alliance wallets. Unless you have proof otherwise...?
---
still better then titans
---
Mordus only have one or two lvl4 hubs and i heard it attracts many pirates
---
I'm learning so much from your videos.  Thank you!
---
I'm afraid the spodbrain is terminal.
---
Agreed, it's crazy good and the time savings make it worth the cost after like 5 sites. With the mod+implant you are only limited by how quickly you can get between sites.
---
and I guess dying feels worse if you really want to find a downside lol.
---
Don't forget the tormentors!
---
&gt;  "I can't want to RF a random POS today!" 
---
Incorrect, this actually WAS a thing, i know because I ran shit tons of ops to "scrub" enemy space, regardless of the value of the moon.
---
weren't opsec attackers?
---
Pretty fair assessment. the last paragraph here is the most important, FCs have no worthwhile things to target. As for your earlier sections, I will say that the more pro-hardmode pvpers didnt like most of the safety features of the citidels and fozzie sov mechanics.
---
It makes me happy to hear that man thank you.
---
People definitely have rose tinted glasses when it comes to killing POS's or they were only part of very large groups.
---
The man hours required to kill undefended citadels is MUCH lower than killing undefended POS's (if they are both fueled).
---
When we were purging provi of structures in our pocket we could RF two or three citadels at once with a single super if they were on the same grid vs shooting each POS with multiple supers/dreads/titans for about the same period of time or longer.
---
If you have a ridiculous blob of titans and dreads I could see killing POS's being faster, but your also spending the man hours of everyone in the blob to do that.
---
Why did you leave a keepstar shaped hole in the right picture? You could have just taken a picture of an empty part of space.
---
I'm more inclined to agree with the later one
---
they negwalleted fraternity wallet a while back, ask /u/cormak for proofs.
---
wait, what you telling is if both dessies simultaneously hit their mjd onto the enemy fleet they won't boosh anything and end up being at 0 from the enemy?  
---
anyway the reactivation delay is 160 sec, so this shouldn't affect &lt;160 man fleet if done properly
---
I mean if us killing Elo's fleet with 3 or 4 fleets is "equal numbers" and "fair"...lol.
---
At least they fly them.
---
Rest in peace 03- astra. Died to valued blues
---
You dropped the /s
---
Living EU
---
*checks bluelist* Who?
---
#You dropped the /s
---
Who?
---
*panfam and imperium
---
if they wanted that to be the case they'd just add a hull bonus
---
To be fair, elo coward ejected from his monitor after feeding his fleet, then left a bunch of caps to die.
---
its next level hard to kill things that you don't undock
---
I like bees
---
#WHAT?
---
##You dropped the /s
---
Good fights! See ya next stream :)
---
&gt;After fair fight with almost equal numbers
---
You were closer to double their numbers than you were to almost equal since math seems to be fucking with you
---
Haha they stood no chance. Wiped them so easily. They think they're elite pvp'ers? Scrubs.
---
TAPI TAPI TAPI TAPI!!!11!
---
Sarcasm doesn't transmit well through text, so most people append /s to anything they say that isn't serious.
---
At least, I assume you weren't serious, because what you said is incredibly retarded otherwise.
---
##What?
---
Will do man :)
---
You can get reported too than
---
For some time, yes :)
---
wow, good to know when booshing enemy fleet from a distance via double mjd!
---
How do you know TEST won a fight?
---
Don't worry, they'll tell you
---
you forgot about your friends from horde and skillu who just stayed tethered watching you feed 😏
---
Come on dude, you won the fight, no need to spin this "equal numbers" shit when there were 3 separate fleets from Legacy alone floating around.
---
Here's an AAR because OP needs one desperately:
---
WinterCo. forms up to kill some Legacy structures that are onlining, gets an Eagle fleet setup with main WinterCo. alliances. SkillU shows up in a fleet as well to support, head into IAS to secure the gate so caps can grind the structures.
---
Legacy forms up a Muninn fleet, a Harpy fleet, a few bomber squadrons, a Nightmare fleet while FIRE forms an Eagle fleet. WinterCo gets 2 Minokawas together and sets up shop on the gate into IAS, getting sandwiched between all of these fleets as local spikes up to 1100. Cue the fight which is basically megabrawl ^OUTRAGEOUS on the gate, but WinterCo bleeds logi and links quickly and are pinned down. We try to haze tackle but its not very effective, with most of the main HAC losses coming at this stage.
---
Good fight, see you next time Legacy.
---
Aren't you in WC? Lmao
---
you are getting baited by a guy from LORDE
---
lol eat shit elo fucking idiot bitch imagine losing a pvp fight what a noob.
---
How do you know test blobbed? They're claiming equal numbers.
---
877 v 522
---
.
---
Seems equal to me!
---
You can make it sub 2s with one faction I-stab the rest t2 and 2 align rigs which is pretty cheap.
---
sounds like a story...?
---
I wanted more dreads lol
---
Why let them fit links at all then? The Hull bonus for links on Command Ships is kind of secondary to their tanking abilities (in my experience anyway). A lot of heavy armor fleets favor Damnations running skirmish links despite the lack of a hull bonus.
---
It's a weird one.
---
watched twice, good video!
---
Yeah, a DKS guy counted it up and friendlies did like 20% of the damage, including a test guy with 32k damage.
---
HELP! IM EVICTED!
---
The alliance needs to nationalize all moon mining structures and refining structures (so basically just all tatara and athanor structures)
---
The best moons are public. Everything else is rented out for private member/corp use with a tax set at some percentage of the total ore assuming max fracks.
---
Moongoo is too large to export regularly and bypass refining tax. Alliance gets refining tax.
---
Gottem.
---
And this gives you power over me?
---
eQuAl NuMbErS
---
\*laughs for two minutes\*
---
I laughed
---
Wow, Tapi only had 300 more ships on the field! 
---
Amazed they took the fight, they don't usually undock with that small an advantage.
---
Good stuff, but i hope this guys was still online and youll see how a slicer really are a pain in the ass.   [https://zkillboard.com/character/2059640570/topalltime/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2059640570/topalltime/)
---
how you know FRT is eating shit   
---
Elo ejects from his monitor to save his pod
---
I heard he made a regex that could properly match html as well!
---
I understand your excitement. It's been so long since you guys won a fight, it must be like your first time all over again.
---
 \[Aezekiel 紫哥@WC &amp; Friends#coalition-pings\] @​everyone    You fought 6:1 outnumbered and multiple objectives were completed.  This is their prime time.  Every fight we take builds  us up for the next one.  Never doubt that what you’re doing scares them, it’s why they want to attack you in your home, and why they have to blob you to get anything done.  They fear you because you are far better.  Any one of you I wouldn’t trade for ten of them.  I’m proud of you, but you should be proud of yourselves. Keep pushing yourselves a little harder every time and we will get where we deserve to be together.
---
I assume you wrote this post because you can't afford plex with a vni?
---
All buyable with PLEX!
---
How about no
---
&gt;almost equal numbers
---
So a 300+ pilot advantage is equal numbers according to tapi
---
Great, now eagle prices are going to go even higher.
---
Can't hear you guys over this thin interbret cable, could you please speak louder?
---
What’s that got to do with anything? Wow you really are stroking out.
---
Well thats very true and very wrong at the same time. For every change that is made to this game there is one group in favor of it and another against it. CCP however has generally ruled in favor of empire building (sov null) with little to no regard how these changes would affect other playstyles. This probably stems from CCP misinterpreting sov-null as endgame content, which is simply not true in practice.
---
Well, the poors only have 1
---
Everyone be shut up before they realize the *bug* is back!
---
Erect if stimulated
---
Negative.  I’m as filthy rich as the next one.  Just saw a post elsewhere about the futility of changes so far to constrain the new isk generators in the game.
---
This one seemed like a way to offset some of the mix/max benefit of super ratting right now.
---
I guess "fair numbers" means at least double lol
---
no
---
citadels take fundamentally more time and effort to kill than POSes, and it's aids. he's complaining about the ref mechanics, not services etc, which should be obvious as every single point he lists relates to those
---
They were but they took $$$ from defenders and backstabbed other attackers they were working with.
---
Hmm
---
Eh to late for flights, might throw the money at a new laptop so i can actually play, been saying I've needed something new for at least 5 years.
---
nice bro didn't know you made videos, good learning resource
---
So your idea is to make the second most expensive ship class on par with a VNI?
---
If you've ever set up a pos in your life you would know citadels have one really important thing going for them
---
Wait how does have 300 more dudes equal a "fair" fight. Dino maths there.
---
but its content! What would the accounting roleplayers do without it
---
Big Brother is watching you to make sure you don't have incorrect sentiments.
---
You can't be this fucking dumb, you asked what DNG was, i told you dirt and glitter.
---
Idk maybe you are that dumb.  At this point it sure does feel like you had a foam couch cushion breakfast
---
i'd rather ccp spent resources on things to improve the game, than to release data people don't need and can't do anything with.
---
If I wasn't a broke ass I'd try it out, but I cant be spending the isk yet.
---
You must be new or ate to much sugar....but let me break it down for you...  
---
1. "even numbers" not.....800+ to 500+...you must have failed math in school....explains why you sound like a 10 year old first time at Disney.  
---
2. Frat was not on their TZ.....remember what happen last time you faced China on their TZ....oh wait...you guys tent to ignore that  
---
3. I am here for the drama and watching you getting overly excited to "kill elo" with over 800+  to a 500 seems to me you cant matching evenly and need the blob of 2 coalitions to be able to do what you just did...but again...I guess thats what "even fights" means to you :)
---
But so does TAPI - elite pvp = blob them
---
Right? lmao
---
Dinos cant count....
---
Read the post again and tell me where I said a super should make the same ticks as a VNI.
---
what could he manipulate 
---
serious question I have a full order of magnitude more isk than him and I’m trying to make more
---
You've got about a 1% chance to get a mordu's spawn. That spawn can be either a garmur, orthrus or barghest. The barghest is very tanky. From personal experience I'd say that garmurs spawn more frequently than orthrusses and orthrusses spawn more frequently than barghests. In short, might as well be hunting officers in npc null.
---
Pos's SUCKED to live in as a wormholer.
---
pls stop posting
---
Yeah, the level of maths is impeccable!
---
You've been told that, but it's actually just a Goon plot! Quafe Zero can't melt steel beams! Wake up sheeple!
---
You deserve a Golden Globe!!
---
It appears FRT fcs spin even harder then OP, the 2 BRs I have seen show a little worse then 3:2 and almost exactly 2:1.
---
AFAIC everyone's a good target.
---
Chinese botting jokes? Go for it.
---
9/11 jokes? Absolutely.

I love cokhs!  I mean rokhs!

Nice thought, but no. This moves the responsibility of purging bots to the player base. 
---
Yet more time away from actually playing the game and more administration overhead.
---
This is CCP's responsibility. Plain and simple. Don't let them off.

make me an offer :P

NO

I mean we cant judge one's individual stupidity and think they are all alike....oh wait its TAPI :p
---
They're old, very old I'm afraid, they were never implemented in order to keep weapon damage types semi unique. The ammo types are unpublished but you can see their stats online. They do non standard damage with either no range modifiers or a slight range reduction.
---
If you're curious about the stats I'll list it.
---
Lux: beams, -25% range, 25% cap, does mainly explosive, some em/therm
---
Shock: arty, -15% range, does mainly em+thermal, some explosive
---
Storm: AC, only em+thermal
---
Desolation: blaster, only em+thermal
---
Blaze: Pulse, mainly explosive some em
---
Bolt: Rails, -15% range, em+thermal
---
I for one am glad they aren't in the game proper.
---
math is for elites

BR shows 881 to 545, that's not even 2:1?

5 Onlining Astra's over 4 Systems.
---
Save the first one, gate towards the second in IAS.
---
Position XIX fleet in k7s, Legacy Eagles and DKS Nightmares in SAI and Test main Muninns in RT-. Force enemy to chose which gate to camp. Despite their numerical disadvantage they setup on the RT gate with FAX. Skillu is setup with their 100man eagle fleet as well. As soon as they switch to RT gate we Jump the SAI and K7S fleets in. Those 3 fleets load freely while i wait in RT with the muninn mainfleet. Skillu eagles warp to SAI gate to harass Legacy and Nightmares. At this point i jump in the Main muninnfleet. We burn away from gate for a few losses and ping up. XIX lands on frat at zero from their k7s warpin and we warp down as well, the legacy eagles also land shortly after. We focus on volleying their links with 3 combined fleets. Then Logi, then Eagles. The Frat fleet spreads fire and focus between different fleets and different shipclasses. 
---
We chew through them pretty well and despite multiple chances to get 50%+ out they miss them and continue dying and dying and dying. DKS Nightmares play with the skillu eagles on the other gate in a battle of nuance and skill with both sides losing a few ships here and there. Also in the meantime a solo dread is killed trying to kill one of the other astras in EIH
---
Eventually the Frat mainfleet gets below critical mass and cant kill anything, they just keep dying though. Staying on anchor never breaking. when they are down to 20 of 180 eagles they manage to fleetwarp 10 out or so. We then loot the field and quickly run into O3-4. We catch multiple caps and lots of fighters trying to kill the 2 astras. The first is saved pretty easily but the second only has 10% strucure and a full 14m59sec. Frat starts suicidng dreads to kill it while idiots in our own fleet continue to shoot it. after the fourth or fifth suicide dread a stilleto from XiX kills the blue astra of dunking goodness.
---
we then head home, refill our jb and ride off into the sun.
---
Pretty dumb tbh
---
Yeah we still use it all the time.

You are saying citadels are better and we shud make it better ? how ? i am not saying poses were good but citadels as bad as poses were ....
---
Really Not Goon Dont Shoot wow lol
---
An additional factor comes from making the delayed damage work in your advantage. If you are burning towards a target while your missiles are in flight, you will artificially jack up your alpha strike potential, by having multiple missile volleys land on the same tick, or very close to it.
---
Corp history only matters if you're in an NPC or 1-man corp and your last corp was KOS.
---
Zeke is no FC
---
Shit. We should all unsub to make the game better
---
Advantage of number but Test did not drop or feed caps to kill a astra
---
Citadel ref mechanics are cancer, and half of the people replying to this thread are missing the point. Here are some reasons why:
---
- Citadels require 3 refs to be destroyed, versus two
---
- Those refs can span up to 9 days, versus &lt;2 days
---
- Citadels can be fully tz tanked (cannot force a weekend hull timer), making it effectively impossible to kill citadels outside your tz
---
- The exact exit timer is completely random, and impossible for the attacker to influence 
---
- Damage cap means a citadel takes 80-90 minutes to kill, or the equivalent of 6 siege cycles per ref, even if it's completely uncontested
---
Everybody is in agreement that the UI and all-round usability of citadels is way better than POSes. But the reinforcement mechanics are completely fucked and make prosecuting a war extremely difficult and unfulfilling. So much so that it's far easier to get fights by dropping citadels than by killing them.
---
Upwell structures need:
---
- One less timer across the board
---
- The span of those timers needs to be significantly less, 3-4 days max
---
- Defenders should only be able to choose the exit tz, not the day
---
- Attackers should be able to influence which side of the exit window the timer comes out
---
- The damage cap needs to be much higher so that at cap the refs take no more than 15 minutes (which should encourage cap usage for larger structures)
---
CCP doesn't need to reinvent the wheel or fundamentally change citadel mechanics. But they do need to stop asking players to take 90 minutes, over the course of more than a week, to kill a 900m structure at 4 in the morning.
---
I'll wait, sure.
---
It's a nice approach ... but the unfortunate thing is ... you do this for a week, they get banned and 1 day later there are new ones and you could restart the procedure ... :(
---
Slicer will always be my favorite ship. Nice chill video.

I mean he probably forgot he had expensive implants in, wouldn't be the first time
---
Are you really going to be salty he didn't feed implants for no reason?
---
&gt;Frat was not on their TZ.....remember what happen last time you faced China on their TZ....oh wait...you guys tent to ignore that
---
If you are refering to the IAS Ihub timer I think you are then volta bombers had more of a role. Last time we faced WC in a timezone of their chosing they blue balled their anchoring fort in 46dp.
---
If I have to root for China or kool-aid drinking TAPI morale posters,

wooosh
---
Yeah funny you are actually rambling about something that has absolutely no bearing or connection to anything at all in this thread.
---
None of the points raised are to do with the UI or service-end of citadels. He's talking exclusively about the reinforcement mechanics, obviously, because every single bullet point relates to those.
---
Nobody is saying bring back pos mods, and it's stupid to respond as if he is.
---
Oh, I thought it was random people coming to the realization that NCPL hurfing about evicting a 200 man alliance with overwhelming numbers is actually really funny.
---
I remember back when I first started the game, I found this AI mining fleet in like 0.5 space... went after a barge with my little frigate, barely put a dent in it before this huge AI fleet came(frigs and cruisers and such) nearly shit myself but I warped out

If you eliminate all the alts from your side, and round the other side up to the closest 1k mark, it almost works.

NC ships, mostly docked... yea I know, old joke
---
There’s about to be more of ‘em. That’s it.
---
Don't you know? Everyone under NCPL in the Imperiums kill-list part of the coalition
---
So, did you kill the pod or did that manage to escape as a result of the eject?
---
I still feel good for doing this over a week during an incursion, and for keeping them still to myself.
---
Hey you remember when about 3k people were killed and about 6000 people were injured on Sept 11? Do you remember that your country responded by killing thousands upon thousands upon thousands of civlians over the next 10+ years? I sure do.
---
Citadels are far better for QoL when it comes to managing and living in them.  POSes are far better for actual content. Why CCP felt the need to reinvent the wheel on combat and reinforce mechanics instead of porting the excellent POS system, I will never understand.
---
So, you see if you check a tyrannosaur has only 2 fingers on each hand, 881 &gt; 4, 545 &gt; 4. To count to either number I am holding up the same number of fingers (4), so they must be about the same? ;)
---
imagine losing 160 eagles and being salty your enemy is smug about it
---
you "begged the question" (not what that means fyi) why they occupied that space, and i explained why: because they needed money and they could. not because they wanted to be next to jita or were in love with tribute or whatever
---
You are looking for some form of parity. Let us look at it this way, how long does it take before you turn a profit? You will find that the smaller stuff turns a profit much faster. Therefore, once the initial investment is paid off, you should reasonably expect to make considerably more ISK.
---
Nah, ccp is hurting the game, because the mechanics completely disincentivise conflict. They made citadels aids to kill and removed almost all reasons to kill them. Shock outcome: nobody can be fucked.
---
Really? that last paragraph really looks like an FC moral post.
---
Can you put on your robe and wizard hat?

---
Not true my dude! Came across a dozen players in their teens applying to Corp (we ask for age in app) in just the last 2 months.
---
It was easier in the past because there were more people trading; so there's a chance someone catches you and ruins it on you but here's how I did it.
---
It'll take a few hours to find your market, then a few solid hours to execute the plan. It's best to research during the week and execute the plan either Friday or Saturday night.
---
First, finding a market. You'll need an item that gets bought/sold frequently per hour across multiple trade hubs.
---
It needs to be an item that people can't (or won't) wait until later to buy. It also needs to be an item that wont get immediately replenished. You can tell by the number of recent orders.
---
Once you found an item, look at history to identify the fair price (the average price) using multiple accounts in each hub buy everything available to buy up to the price that is 5 times (or more) the base price. The goal here is to ensure if anyone in any hub is to buy that item, it's from you.
---
Once you bought everything, immediately place sell orders the hubs that are extortionately high, but still the best prices (temporary monopoly). Then you'll spend hours slowly dropping your price in a .01 isk war until you shift the bulk of your stock.
---
It's unlikely you'll shift everything, but if you can at least break even in the first hour or two, you're onto a winner. Eventually the price will return to the base. You can pull your orders and sit on it, or... ship the items out to the less busy trade hubs and leave them there on a long term sell order at  maybe 20% above Jita base price.
---
It's a rough guide but that's the gist of it. Start on a smaller cheaper market to experiment and not fear losing that investment, not all markets requires hundreds of billions. Some can be under a billion to execute, even 100-200 million.
---
Warnings:
---
1. If someone sees you doing this, they may be able to get their hands on those items themselves and pull down the market on you by forcing the prices back down (The people you buy from will be the first to know).
---
2. You might be unlucky and someone nearby has that item sitting in a warehouse and they pull your market down.
---
3. Also unlucky, if someone happens to be resupplying that item that day but that's the gamble.
---
4. Predict and Record the costs of the items. If you can't buy all the available stock across the few trade hubs, don't bother with that item. Also, if you know how much you spent, divide that by your number of items and you'll get the average minimum price you need to sell overall, in order to at least break even.
---
5. If someone pulls down your market, you  could lose a lot of isk.
---
If you do see someone pulling you down, you can always find out who by buying one of their items. It's expensive, but you never know, it could be a friend.
---
The guy just said "we need to fix/improve on what we have, not completely redo it". Of course citadels aren't the most fun thing in the game, but they did come to the game because people complained about POSes. Here's my two cents on what I would improve.
---
The reinforcement system is awful, no one has the time to be able to go through weeks worth of timers. Enough said.
---
Tether is an awful thing, on the bright side ships can be bumped out, that's it's only positive side. It leads to risk averse behavior as people can just sit on an undock in complete safety, it should be on a timer and not indefinitely, I understand the idea that tether was to help negate Hellcamping a bit, although indefinite tether isnt about impeding Hellcamps, it's just stupid.
---
We need to go back to one structure per moon. That includes all your ansiblex jump gate, cyno beacon and system jammer. Do you want to mine every single moon in your system? You need to sacrifice your defences. 
---
Lastly, people should just undock, and not to crab. Like, it's so sad how dedicated people are to krabbing, but you get only a small amount that's willing to undock to PVP. It's as if most of the playerbase is a a castrated old dog, it's really sad. Like people want this game to become a theme park, and not the only thing of it's kind. Like quit looking at zkillboard to compare yourself, Zkill is an intel tool and it ends there.

Yes Unspoken started to take sov before the deployment, it's why NC was deployed.

I lost one of these today. Came through the gate, screen faded into the UI and I clicked Jump on the next gate and didn't move. Pod hurt worse than the ship if I'm honest.

IIRC he runs MG snakes in his monitor all the time for munnin purposes. So ejecting if he could save it that way was the right choice.

Fun fact: its very plausible that there is a cock drawn by Andy Warhol still on the moon.
---
This is obviously a fake BR as everyone on reddit knows that TEST can't win a single fight in this war.
---
You highlight my point so well. Too many people need a carrot dangling in front of them. Why not go fight for the fun of the fight itself?
---
I know, right?
---
Dang this is actually the first "Good" report you post since the war started.....what happen the fights before? I want to hear those :p
---
1 dread in a c5 makes about 800m/h. Ofcourse you still have to make bookmarks, roll statics etc which takes a bit of time too.
---
" That is typically a Very Bad Thing. " Only if you possess the numbers necessary to use it as means to ref their sov/station, which in the example being discussed isn't a possibility, a station on grid with theirs will certainly be annoying but that's all it is without the numbers to actually contest and ref their structures in their tz.
---
wasnt that literally the exact position test was in 1 month ago?
---
gfs, see you next fight :)
---
right because no one in frat has alts...
---
Awww somebody didn't like what I said.....

Thank you CCP.  I will finally know where the hell the fleet is going.

Yes! That is the only thing Ive ever complained that is CCP's fault.  Glad this was righted.

Don't you dare.

I'm pretty fine in my WH.

Thing is, this pal of mine had an agreement with their neighbors. They fought each other. Hunt ratters, minners, etc. Just, don't screw each other sov or structures.

hi, im currently trying to get lvl 2 mission and eventually lvl3 combat mission, what missions do i need to do to get lvl 2 then to lvl 3? security, mining, etc? is there a specific agent i gotta talk to?

thanks!

While we're at it, I would like skins for drones and modules.

A corpmate of mine had the Idea to make them more accessable through some kind of PvE in Lowsec to both drop the prices of the barghest and populate lowsec a bit more. I allways liked that idea but it probably will never happen.

Citadels directly lead to supercaps &amp; titans being everywhere as using them before Keepstars was a ball ache. Now it's just as easy as sub-caps.
---
So they giving people the same tired ass New Eden....😑 Would have been better to give people the Eve gate story . Prequel but what do I know. I don't have 3-4 other failed game.projects on my.resume.
---
It was probably never implimented due to "POS code" or "legacy code".
---
So you are asking for info on lost supers and titans that dropped corp before  losing the ship.  Now lets go back and research all those people on zkill who lost supers and titans.  Now cross reference npc corp people with previous corp history to satisfy some rando on the internet.  Go research it yourself you will find plenty of examples and way more than 2.  If not go fuck yourself.
---
I agree. We really should take the best aspects of both. Also keep POSes as a good forward operating base.
---
they choose safe content, where nothing is truly at risk hent risk averse.  Ask Brave who they chased around the map, ask Provi.
---
Same here. Full AAR please! :)
