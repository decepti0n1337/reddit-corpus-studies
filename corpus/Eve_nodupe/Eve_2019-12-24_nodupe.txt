Money or not. Don't screw with the EULA.

At this time of year there is a high number of credit card fraud alerts and MMOs like EVE and WOW are a way for credit card thieves to launder the money. They start a new account, use a stolen credit card to buy a bunch of in-game currency then sell the in-game currency for cash and leave the MMO holding the bag. A new account with a large dollar purchase like what you described could have set off some bells for them. Keep in mind its Christmas so support is probably going to be slow getting back to you as they are probably short-staffed this week and next.
---
oooh!  I'll suggest it!
---
You can have the wormhole and blue loot, or you can crab in the nullblock.
---

---
But you can't have both.
---
Why? They can't come kick in your door in the middle of the night and black bag you or your family. They can ban you from their service. That's it. You'd likely be better off, like a drunk getting cut off.
---
Be prepared to wait months. My account was banned and it took them 3 months to respond back to me and unlock it. 
---
Their support is absolutely atrocious.
---
Let people move forward using possibly stolen credit card balances? No thanks.
---
IDK how it's different from the other RMT scenarios but then again, not very experienced in all this.
---
"They can ban you from their service. That's it." 
---
Agreed. That's literally what happened here. And kind of the point of the entire post.
---
You can send a bug report by hitting F12 and then send bug report. Are you able to continue the tutorial? for example relog and then run again? if not also send a ticket to CCP for a stuck mission. Again through F12. Cheers.

mine is a really REALLY old school video about a thanatos getting killed in a bubble, mind you this was the era of NANO BS that would drift sideways! the video featured some 'comic' esque intro and then played the TOP GUN theme song.. anyone remembers it ?
---
im just waiting for the inevitable predditor retard
---
I haven't found anything to do in this game but mine and die before I realize what's happening.. so.. if you once found enjoyment I'd consider that a win.
---
Anything from my old bro Elektra. Many really cool historical fights here.

I think i want to do this now. I really want a marshal.
---
Pl was awesome
---
&gt; Also Nullblocks: Why do I have to take 26 jumps to find content?
---
Because you didn't bother to learn how to use a jump bridge networks; its 4 fucking jumps!

I can give you all my shit and another 100K plex and it still wont' help you get into PL
---
I agree 100%. Between the warp speed buffs and this, you can cover a lot of ground in 2 hours.
---
This was when the svipul was still insanely op. I would fly an active tanked one that did like 400 dps. Lots of bigger ships fell for it.
---
&gt; that seemingly no one wants to find out what happened
---
Except for you know, 99.9% of the public.
---
Oh really? you might be right! I didn't know that the only way for people to be killed was through being stabbed in the face. Unfortunately, it seems that I will never be able be enlightend as for some bizzare reasons there are no security tapings of the period of his death.  Truly mysterious. I hoped that the guards could explain the process to me instead....but...oddly enough.. they weren't there either. What do I do know? It seems that I must give up on the idea that his death wasn't through suicide and just accept that he killed himself. Truly thank you for providing me with cold comfort.
---
I meant in terms of politcians, but of course you are right when it comes to the public.
---
What the Hel?
---

---
TIL nearly every suicide is actually a wide-ranging conspiracy theory because people don't tape themselves dying
---
but no, our eponymous hero just sat there and didn't resist allegedly being murdered. And nobody of any suspicion is known to have entered or left the facility.
---
God forbid we could find you a hundred tapes of empty hallways with people killing themselves inside their cells and you'll start crying that because the interior of the cell isn't taped it still must be a magic murderer who enters and exits through solid concrete walls!
---
You said Deklein twice
---
Provi Cerbs would like to know your location.
---
The change doesn't affect ore availability. All it does is force miners to move around more often, it doesn't functionally change how much they have to mine by a significant amount. Sure, the 15-minute wait for a new anom happens 2-3 times as often, which has some effect, but on the whole I'm not sure why you're expecting a giant change, especially since most miners mine lower-level anoms while they're waiting.
---
Thanks bro
---
Setting a hard limit on the amount of ore you can mine per unit time. Like, say, getting rid of anoms or at least making them not respawn as frequently and making people rely on Athanors and belts for ore.

Finally, you actually fucking get it.
---
Don't hide from the players, join a corp.
---
Don't be afraid to leave a corp because the community is shit. Find people who you like and you'll like playing the game with.
---
Everyone is out there playing their own version of Eve. Try new stuff out, see what's out there. Years in I'm still discovering new stuff and trying things for the first time and it's my favorite thing about the game.
---
Not playing EVE atm due to funds however this is the best story ever, mostly cuz I can relate. Except I was drunk and did fall asleep... :)
---
Because it's the best ship and deserves to stand out.
---
I know that things like the nvidia and google streaming services are banned but does anyone know the ruling on using something like steam in home streaming to stream from my desktop to my laptop in my home?
---
SDing the cyno for a cap seems excessive...although I guess it worked in your favor since you didn't mass the hole right.
---
Notes on cynos:
---
- You can't light a cyno without being in a fleet
---
- You can move caps into a fleet with a pre-lit cyno and still jump to it
---
- You can NOT move a lit cyno to a new fleet
---
Well you know, you could just kill me right then and there.
---
No.
---
Bait trap.
---
We weren’t talking about sov or general mechanics, I said resource scarcity / depletion is a good step towards creating conflict. As for structure bashing, as I said already, some of the best fights I’ve been a part of was over r64 moons. 
---
So, yea..
---
Basically what i would love to happen, shooting the MTU's ... it's not really about the MTU .. it's about bringing someone a ship that wants to pewpew :)
---
Working as intended.

Because it likely also bans your ip, email and credit card, though those can of course be replaced with some effort. As an added bonus if your new account somehow gets tied to your old one in the future it's likely going to eat a permaban for ban evasion as well :p
---
Oh my god look a this picture of my cat near my desk, it typed out the complete works of shakespear while I was afk!!!
---
How was the cat pressing enter after each j?
---
Horrible idea, just make them more expensive
---
Great another person complaining about Thera. Literally every thread

No I already use an ethernet cable

Yeah 3rd Party yeet fleet

1.

You could get out of care bear land. Imagine not being able to shoot who ever you go dam want, when ever you god dam want.
---
~~Then die horribly. ~~
---
As someone who's played EVE for about 10 years  and done every play style (cave person btw currently ) I can understand why people would be afraid of wormholes.
---
From the null bloc perspective they lose access to a lot of their comfort. No jump freighters, you don't get straight isk from killing rats and the rats aren't as easy.
---
No local for defense (so many people quit in my Corp during black out when I was in goons because they couldn't krab in peace), no jump bridges or linear access to space.
---
Tldr they need the safety net or some form of safety
---
Your acting like it actually evolved. Decisions were made by CCP and the results were maybe not in the best interests of the majority.
---
They are already bad for escaping, since you can't activate them with an active Capsuleer Log-Off Timer. So you have to avoid any engagement for 15min in order to jump, which should be enough time for your enemy to find you and reset your Timer. If they don't manage to do that, you deserve to get away.
---
Yes, one of the guys who was on comms with him at the time wrote an article about it at the time, when they did the fundraiser for his family.
---
Yup we've had some grade A salt directed towards us when we pop out of our 'Cave' into Chinese space.

---
Always depends on what you want to do. Community fittings (ingame under fittings)? Haven't loooked at it yet though so i can't promise you anything there.
---
You can always ask in one of the help channels about fittings and advices but be careful. You gotta avoid those people that suddenly go into a storytime mode for 2 hours and still don't help you in any way.
---
A good way for ratting is always information about the stuff you will shoot. Be it a mission in highsec or be it rats in an anomaly. A passive shield tank drake (drake with large shield extenders + hardeners (for specific rats if wanted) is good for learning a lot of things about ratting. Google will always be your best friend (just google something like "eve *insert mission name here*" and look through it). It is always helpful to know triggers (if you shoot those the next wave will appear and 2 waves at once can be tricky to deal with for starters). Stuff that scrambles is always a must-kill if you are worried about not tanking (danger of dying/losing your ship). Same goes for neuting because no/less tank and no propulsion module is very tricky to survive. Don't be afraid to warp off if you are worried you might die (why you want to shoot those pesky things that can warp scram/disrupt you first btw).

Stay where you are- the space police are on their way.

As useless as real venture.)

Aside from what everyone else has said in answer to 1, there's a story about some chinese player being banned for botting and taking it to court. Story says he won and bots have to be allowed on chinese games.
---
I think this is actually bannable. As I recall, you're allowed to fly around with drones out and try to decloak stuff, and even use jetcans to help, but littering space with tons of cargo containers, drones and abandoned ships is not allowed.
---
Reeeeeeeeeee
---
100 kk

Yeah, I sub on 3 accounts during Yulai and the let the subs lapse in 1-2 of them.

Great, now i wanna Play Eve again

I don't need a lecture from a fuckin bottom feeding bitch like you who can't do anything but spawn camp new players all day. Go stare a jump gate and wait for the next ship to hit your Acme Spawn Camp-o-matic-5000. You don't change from year to year and game to game you bottom feeding slimy scum will always be there lol. Glad you are absolutely loving the mobile warp disruptor spawn camping though good for you kiddo.
---
link the killmail please
---
They tend to buy enough of their own tickets so they can still lose the item but make a profit. If you buy the remaining 200\~ish tickets they will either make a small profit or come out even and if they win they make 100% profit and keep the item.
---
It's probably the number of tickets they can afford to buy while still retaining a profit.
---
&gt;spawn campers
---
I, too, enjoy the new CoD.
---
Talos seems to be doing pretty well with small balance changes rather than crushing differences.
---
Link killmail for research porpoises.
---
Clearly you did your research better spend your time learning the game instead of Posting here
---
&gt; returning to tiericide and a focus on capital structure balance
---
I feel like i've heard this from ccp at least three times in the apst
---
I don't get to shoot my neighbor because they damaged my property, wtf lol
---
I'd say the Caldari are more like Japanese keiretsu (protectionist, perfectionist, the company really is your "family", ritual suicide). The USA, as a federation full of internal contradictions with a sprawling military-industrial complex, a spotted record of living up to its own values, a vast spy network, civilian architecture designed with terror attacks in mind (Crystal Boulevard/One WTC/several schools), a habit of meddling in other countries, a heavy reliance on drone warfare, and a president who uses the office to further his own business interests, is a lot like the Gallente.
---
I didnt read all i saw was him bitching about the game. Change it to 0.0 in yah mind.
---
MERRY CHRISTMAS YAH FILTHY ANIMALS! AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!
---
What are these FW changes???
---
The FW community is anxious.
---
That will totally ruin your game play. you have nothing to work toward now. save 2 million for yourself to buy a few skillbooks and  use the rest to buy gametime or anything that's not actually useful, but is pretty. like skins.
---
I thought I asked first, damnit
---
Once and a while the .exe hangs.  You’ll have to close it with task manager.
---
Ditto, but to be fair team Talos has been kinda knocking it out of the park so far. Of course that could change at any time since this *is* CCP we're talking about, but if Talos has it on their radar I'll be cautiously optimistic for now.
---
Change your password and get 2fa.

Just look at the most active system in kills of test alliance

Have you tried selling mobile warp disruptors then? You could be rich!

i just added my account again and i got in fine, so i have no idea what happened there

Yeah. Go live in null under the protection of a big Bloc. Hi Bob, nice to meet you!
---
hah funny thing is, i just changed my password last night...seems like something funny is going on then and yeah i should

---
No specifics yet, they were mentioned only very vaguely in Vegas.
---
CCP did say they've been monitoring the FW discord, said something about tweaking the ship types allowed through certain plex gates - plus the possibility of bringing back gate sliding in some form. Remains to be seen what they decide to work on though.

Nah you just adjust the price to account for the ISK you’re spending on the ticket.

Push the cost on down to the consumer.

I don't doubt it, a poorfit deadspace Leviathan can have ~100M EHP if Shield Slaves boost HP as much as Amulets do.
---
So if you want just the Marshal hull..just do anything else that can make you the iskies (ratting, mining, DEDs, abyssals, scamming whatever)...this is just a waste of time imo. I just wanted to "earn" it and beat this mini game :)

One word - gas mining ICR in C5/C6 space.  The venture paid for itself in one cycle, including has harvesters.  Ok, 6 - 10 words.

The source [seems to be contested](https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=1425388). I also recall the "pi-rat" version appearing in mission dialog, but I don't have a source for that handy.

Well done sir. I had to sing it out loud 😂

MerryXmas all!

It makes no sense!

thanks!

Pretty simple way is to just extend "tiericide" for meta modules to faction modules as well. Have a "baseline" faction module with better stats than Tech 2, then apply the same restrained/scoped/compact/enduring/whatever modifiers to the faction modules as well.
