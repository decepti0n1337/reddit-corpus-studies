Capitals to stronk they say.. in reality 20 caps cant kill a single cruiser well balanced game.

Real Money Trade, basically people buying in-game ISK for cash. It's not allowed and can get you banned, so people use all kinds of weird ways to send the ISK that they think CCP can't trace. But they can totally trace it.
---
Reddit account selling ain't no joke sirs
---
You are so, so wrong. Try doing some small gang or watch old AT vids.
---
RMT = Real Money Trade
---
&gt;Was a super fun fight, a little slower with the super capital hammer and we could have probably killed a dozen or so more caps, thanks legacy.
---

---
If you were ever going to kill a dozen caps, you'd have done it. This wasn't a short fight. There is absolutely no way you were taking down a dozen of anything, you didn't even get a single rorq?
---
&gt;Legacy brought over 200 pilots including double our legion numbers in Capitals, many of which didn't even make it on the battle report.
---
That's not what I saw tbh.
---
&gt;a few of their Carriers started panic cynoing out
---
This also didn't happen. Guys went to restock or had other commitments.
---
&gt;and asked a small wormholer group to bring Kikimoras to help us break FAXes who were 12 jumps away
---
Lmao a small wormholer group? Wait so Volta et al are allowed to call for the cavalry when you can't get kills, but brave noobs aren't? Also quit bitching about people bringing caps when you're flying blinged T3C's. Abyssal mods in fleet is a bit ott, is it not? That's what some of your guys were flying.
---
Did you even come out isk positive? (Just checked, yeah you actually did, kudos) I'm just trying to figure out why you're posting this as a success story. You didn't achieve anything of note
---
There's a two minute delay on bookmarks, so will still require some timing or effort
---
Why would you be taking cinematic screenshots moments BEFORE finding the loot?  
---
You've played your hand. lol
---
imagine not bringing a single web boat
---
They should revoke asset safety for the group declaring the war. Now that would be interesting.
---
&gt;your sites respawn once or twice a day
---
Not gonna lie, you had me up to that point
---
This would for sure be tracked.
---
Afaik subcaps were off grid for a lot of the fight. I'm sure there were plenty of tackle fit frigs in fleet, but it's a bit difficult to not melt them when you warp them into a blinged T3C sandwich.
---
This is staggeringly back. I am utterly blown away by how bad some of these ideas are. 
---
A botter is probably already using a VM to hide the fact he is multiboxing alpha clones in myrms. He is not going to be affected by this ban on multiboxing.
---
'Allow people to make their own servers"
---
Why? There are not enough people on this server as it is without taking away all the highsec miners who don't want to play with other people.
---
"Bring back Serenity (it was killed to inflate player numbers with RMTers and botters)"
---
What? Serenity is still active mate. It was not killed by anyone.

"Remove war decs on corps with only 1 structure"
---
I don't see the point in this. If you don't want to be wardecced, don't drop a structure. There is no need to make a bunch of totally safe structures in highsec.

1b isn't remotely blingy for either of those ships

Welcome !
---
[https://imgur.com/a/1OwBJHd](https://imgur.com/a/1OwBJHd) that's all you can do in Eve and there is more !
---
Honestly get a feel of the game, see what you like. Do the career agents or even the Sisters of Eve arc. They are bit boring but they give you the basics.
---
When you feel like it, post in the [recruitment forum](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/corporations-alliances/recruitment-center) or r/evejobs. Plenty of corps will try to recruit you but don't rush : high sec is totally different from low sec ( our beloved cutthroat pvp alley) or null sec ( feudal lands). PvP is a thing, industry another. You can even do a career of scamming people or hauling people stuff ( check the "hauler channel" great people).
---
Eve is a social game : join a good corp and they will teach you the game. Before deciding chat in local or one of the various in game channel. Most corps have also public channel if you want to chat before joining. Just don't play solo : Eve is everything as a game except a solo game.
---
Well that IS a positive step. I'm glad they are talking to FW people directly. I can understand the cautious optimism then.
---
What's with the T1 Invulns?
---
Low sp lol. Bad Idea I know but I was running T2s smoothly with them then tried to hop into T3 and just got boomed
---
Yes Fi.re is defacto same thing
---
Not really. The pve content is stale and repetitive. The best times I‚Äôve had since returning was blackout pvp. But sad Goon whiners cried too much.
---
o/ 
---
If you‚Äôre interested and want to check out the in game channel ‚ÄúAbyssal Lurkers‚Äù where there are fits and people you can ask for help/advice!
---
Nice, I didn't know about that. I'll join and check it out but will probably move onto doing incursions and conduits for safer income anyways.
---
The most interesting and probably most viable idea is the designated campaign system(s).  
---
The most abusable idea is the objective system.  
---
Some great thought must needs made about a single fw Corp with a voted CEO.  On the one hand this might help with stagnation, on the other would likely lead to splintering off of players.  Also I can't reconcile who or what would control recruiting of this single entity especially if 1 charismatic person controlled who could participate, but you can't just let anyone into every fleet or com's.  Wouldn't really work.  Caldari never really got along well after 2014 and Gallente had some really stagnant leadership and a civil war in 2016.  
---
Fw has a handful of serious, well articulated and documented issues then what you name.  But I do like more of a campaign strategy, or only being able to plex a front line of systems.
---
Idk that's pretty risky for 50 internet points, undocking anywhere near Jita with 25b of PLEX.
---
Or you can click the link to the d-scan in the OP instead of being the person who reads a news headline and adds that to his "repertoire of knowledge" without actually reading the article.
---
Cause it was a 115 pilot Muunin fleet, not a fleet with 115 Muunins, there's a difference.
---
Also saying FIRE and Legacy are different is like saying DRF and DCU were different.
---
That‚Äôs very odd given you have no gunnery skills, did you by chance have more SP when you went on break?
---
If you did you might have had your account compromised and extracted. Please enable two-factor security, and make a support ticket if you suspect shenanigans.
---
This is like if in no country for old men moss took a selfie with the bag and posted it to Instagram
---
Name checks out.
---
It'd be a lot more simple if it was a human doing it, and I could just accept that I'm slower than them and move on with my day, but it isn't.
---
I'm aware the BPC canister change has made ninja looting a hot topic, but this is not not what im trying to bitch about. 
---
This is just scripting, sitting and waiting for something to die, and then looting it faster than a human possibly can. How can I prove it? I can't, I just have to watch one guy with 3 alt's plug every spot, faster than people that have been doing this and beating actual, human thief's without fail for ages.
---
too rich for me
---
ive got like no isk
---
i used to be ballin in battleships with lasers missiles and drones, 
---
don't think there would be any reason i couldn't fly and shoot the smaller stuff
---
scanning is so boring f that
---
Feels like you haven't played Eve long enough or deep enough yet.
---
1) massive potential for abuse
---
2) massive potential for abuse
---
3) corp wallet sounds like a bad idea and can lead to massive abuse/scamming
---
4) kill x amount of players would actually mean kill x amount of your own alts = again, abusable as hell. Rest can be abused using alts also.
---
I'm sorry but making as complex system like this work would require huge amount of planning to make it bulletproof. Doing it half assed would just make FW even worse. Players are just too smart for this to work.
---
But those 12 glorious hours after the direct deposit hits and before you pay those bills are euphoric
---
this is just.... no.
---
Looks like there's 6 of you now...
---
Which filaments do you run? What‚Äôs your fit? I‚Äôm always curious to see other peoples fits for abyssals!
---
No doubt.
---
For a large portion of players? 26 billion is a kings ransom. Ive been playing for 7 and a half years and I am only worth 85 billion on my primary account for instance. I waste a shitload of cash in dumb ways though.
---
theres a good chance its a combination of Alpha restrictions and your memory of what you were able to do 7 years ago serving you wrong.
---
Oh yeah only 250 lol
---
Accurate
---
Salty Tears from bitter vets taste better and are healthier for you. I'm surprised it's this cheap :P
---
Then you lose returning players pretty much outright. People act like the game exists in a vacuum, but if someone is going to take a break from eve, you don't want game mechanics to further encourage them to not come back.
---
first of all, i didn't, second of all, if i did, it doesn't counter my point
---
i didn't
---
Get a full tank DST and eyes ahead ...
---
Cheap t2 abyssals
---
I'm fairly new to eve. Anyone care to explain what an RMT trade is?
---
For what other reason than the memes would one do it in the first place?
---
for the other memes probably
---
They probably had 20 huginns off-grid during the fight who didn‚Äôt get the fleet warp.
---
Don't move more than a couple bil in one go. 
---
Don't autopilot, use some instawarp ship or tanky ship with fast align/cloak. 
---
Make sure your alt has no killrights/war.
---
It's got a proper name, y'know.
---
Continue circlejerking over 3leet wormholers getting two cap kills then. If they actually got a single rorq they would have destroyed more isk than they did the whole fight.
---
It's very difficult to get subcap support on grid when the enemy is using kikis or T3C's, without getting them melted. Most groups would drop caps to counter a fleet like that, especially because the subcaps took a while to form. Also T3C's are the most overpowered thing that isn't a super. Don't pretend otherwise.
---
&gt;Sadly, it forgot what this game was about.
---
The game is about whatever I want it to be about. Try harder.
---
Tell us how you came across this
---
&gt; Eve, a game where players need to try and fix things because devs are busy making new projects that are dead on arrival ~~they cancel after year in development~~
---
try using proton 3.6 or 3.7 through steam
---
&gt;That may well not be true. Like you say, some those Legions had Abyssal mods, who's true value doesn't get reflected on the BR.
---
Good point actually, if you're going to fit officer heat sinks for a random op, why not do a few abyssal rolls on some shiny modules too. 
---
&gt;I'm guessing it's an attempt to justify the cyno changes. Sutonia is a well known CCP mouthpiece when it comes to these chaos changes, so a story of a large group not being able to bring their super umbrella on grid quickly enough to prevent big losses would fit well within their narrative
---
Can't say I agree with a lot of things he says tbh, but he'd need to have actually got some big kills if that's his narrative. Maybe that's why he said they "would have killed a dozen caps" lmao. Not quite as good as "we got a dozen caps", but it sounds better than "we only got 2 caps, and none were the Rorquals we wanted".
---
May be another

Issue
---
I quit in December last year but this fabruary would have marked my three years of playing anniversary. I hit 1T of net worth over all my chars (including SP) in August last year. And no, I never rorqual mined or super ratted. I ran 10/10's (first 100b) for the first 1.5 years, then did a bit of titan ratting (maybe 25b worth), then started doing reactions while paying attention to what aryth says in gs_isk (all the rest). I literally was told what to react, when to buy, when to sell, how to buy, how to sell. A mouth breathing squirrel can make that much money if they follow the advice in that channel.

Yeah, I‚Äôm not worried. This weekend is a weird one because it‚Äôs a 3 day weekend (today is a federal holiday that many have off) so these sorts of weekends so wonky things with the PCU sometimes.

---
Bump the thing away. Can‚Äôt scoop loot if it‚Äôs getting bounced all over the place.
---
Lol better at PvP. Most likely not. Even PL just hotdropped with their supers those "Elite" players. Whats left is that the current coalitions found out how to optimize industry and now everyone is reeeing because its so unfair they do it and Others cant. 
---
Yes the blue doughnut is crap and i would wish the Imperium isnt blue to everything two regions around them, but honestly what did you expect? There is strength in Numbers, also the supers. The Problem isnt their individual strength but their abundance. If someone nerfs my supers even more i want my sp and the materials refunded.
---
Ideal for low sec only content, neutral terriotry.
---
Depends if that amount is significantly more than the receiving pilot has had before or the age of the receiving pilot
---
DELET THIS.

I'm a simple man.  I see someone complain about downvoting, I downvote more.
---
First off, use appropriate size drones. If you have few battleship spawns (and the rest are smaller) then dont use heavy drones, same with mediums. Reason is one, they wont keep up (damage application is bad) and reason two, they are bigger and slower which makes them more vulnerable.
---
Secondly, this is a usual problem and in normal cases its solved by either going with faction drones, e.g., Republic Fleet Warrior (iirc almost twice the hp for a marginal dps decrease in comparison to T2 drones), and/or using Drone Navigation Computers. The latter will make drones faster and the faster they are the less damage they will take.
---
Keep in mind that you need to train the relevant drone skills as well, e.g., drone durability and drone navigation.
---
But even when you have done everything properly there will be instances where you will lose drones and if thats the case you should target the smaller ships first cause they are the ones hurting your drones the most.
---
Here comes the kicker tho, in some cases your drones will get hyperaggro and it doesnt really matter what you do. This has been a bug/feature for a long time and in those cases you can try leaving your ship in a station and then getting back into it or try relogging. Sometimes these session changes alleviate the issue and other times it does nothing. Nobody has ever really came up with a good solution and I dont think anyone actually knows if its bug or a feature.
---
Hope these steps solves your issues.
---
Make a courier contract to PushX or public and move on with the business of making money. Let someone who specializes in hauling handle it while you specialize in what you do. More ISK time efficient this way, imo.
---
Im curious to see what that means in 10% tidi
---
It was dropped by him, or someone in his fleet/ Corp
---
The Cargo container is blue, if it were someone else‚Äôs, it would be yellow, and opening it would make you a suspect
---
The absolute vast majority of DST which get ganked in high-sec are completely shit fits that deserve what they get.
---
A properly fit and properly piloted DST is a very tough nut to crack and harder to catch, too.
---
Once a thera conection opens near by use a ceptor scout and a Blockade runner. never had a problem
---
&gt; So how would you impose "risk" that effectively cuts that 12t number in say half (which seems very generous)?
---
I'd definitely start with stopping people from farming the Drifter Response Battleship with citadels.  That's possibly a quarter of the entire income right there, I expect.  You need at least three RR battleships to tank a drifter... or you can wait for it to warp to your citadel, bait it with ... well, anything, have that character dock and gun the citadel, and then undock something else to tackle it while you kill it with citadel launchers.  (Teaching them to try to clear tackle, in general, would require serious logi support or all your points on your dread to kill the drifter no matter what, but that's a little smarter than any rats are currently.)  But definitely make it so that they don't think citadels are something they can kill in the time it takes a citadel to kill them.  You'll either see more capitals out of this *or* you'll see less income.
---
Similarlly, some of the rats in the wormhole sites could scramble, instead of simply pointing, so that you can't just micro jump drive on a new signature.  The Avengers (capital escalation bonus ships) do it, so we know we have the technology to make a rat scramble.  This should also encourage more capital farming, and dreads root themselves in a site for 5-minute chunks.  That's enough time to organize an attack.
---
The more I think about it, the more I'm liking the idea of reducing the time before K162s spawn to something short but longer than it takes to probe them, so 5-10 minutes.  This means that people would have to crit their statics instead of rolling them entirely, which isn't a perfect solution but it cuts out a lot of the drawbridge effect.  You'd need to make sure people were aware enough that they considered scanning a hop or two out instead of ragerolling.
---
For something a little more unpredictable, frigate holes already aren't, strictly speaking, unrollable, but they're close to it, because they're the only class of hole that has regenerating mass.  What if we made some really, really transient frig holes that spawned for something short like 4 hours?  Maybe make them randomly appear tied to a chance when spawning drifters? (lore idea: this is a wake from DRBs moving themselves around)  So, the longer you run sites, the more likely you are to have something that people can bring a bunch of kikis in to make your life hard.
---
Yes
---
What made you think to report it to CCP?  I dont understand what youre worried about
---
The hecate can also do sub 1s and does not need nomads to do it. It's very nice.
---
&gt; completely shit fits
---
On this note, it can even be beneficial to fit mods you can't actually use (for skills or fitting reasons) simply because it'll show on a scan, and may make them think you could tank anything.
---
War is war. Sorry it's not two small gang PvP groups having equal, preplanned nanogang fights featuring space honour.
---
One thing, make your account with a referral link. Its against the rules to post them here, and I don't want to seem like I'm just trying to take advantage of you by posting mine to get the rewards if you sub, but just get one from somewhere, or from an alt, and use it to create your main. It will get you a bunch of skillpoints to start off with. Don't inject them all at the start, just keep most of them in reserve for a month or so until you know know what exactly you want to use them on. 
---
As for joining a group, The Rogue University is good if you want a smaller pvp focused group, Pandemic Horde is good if you want a big group, Signal Cartel is good if you want to not pvp, Spoopy Newbies is good if you want wormholes, Aiederon Robotics and Templis Calsf are good if you want to do small scale faction warfare stuff, and E-Uni is upvoted by everyone but is actually trash (it takes you like three weeks to get in compared to the &lt;24 hours of Pandemic Horde, and its mostly dead outside of hisec, where there is nothing to do but mine and hide from wardeccers).
---
I wouldn't recommend joining one immediately, but after you finish the tutorials and get the hang of the basics in hisec or exploring by yourself, then just start joining the public channels of those groups, and any other groups you get recommended, and ask about how they are, and decide where you want to go. Also keep in mind hopping around corps a bit, especilally while you are new, is normal, if you don't like one group just leave it and join a new one. The only important thing is that, no matter where you go, make sure to join fleets and be on comms.
---
FEDEX the Tristan lives! nice vid...props to you guys!
---
Bugger I bought an A1200 at Christmas, guess that's that idea gone
---
True.         
---
Those people won in this game.
---
Your mistakes:
---
* You just made a single item instead of diversifying, I would start with at least 10-20 items (or at least ramp it in that direction quickly)
---
* You played the 0.01 ISK game and burned out
---
* You didn't invest enough which is probably the reason for the first two
---
This is a game of percentage profit on your investment. The more you can put in, the more you'll get out. If your investment is low, it's entirely possible to make more by mining in highsec. As others have said, producing in nullsec with properly rigged citadels also makes a huge - I can't state this enough, HUGE - difference.
---
If you sell a lot of different items, you can be way more relaxed on the 0.01 ISK game, because if one doesn't sell right away, the others probably will. Also, Jita is probably a bad place to get started, lots of competition and - especially if you do T1 production - razor thin margins.
---
Unfortunately, it's quite hard to start carefully in this field. It doesn't make much difference in terms of effort / research to invest 100M or 5B, but 10% profit mean one nets you 10M and the other 500M. So unless you are willing to drop at least 1-2 Bil on this (with a certain risk of loosing a good chunk of it if you make very bad decisions) you'll likely find it not worth your time.
---
You make it out?
---
So surprised to see this has not been posted yet, this is a very clear rip on EVE Online, even alot of the icons, assets are nearly identical how has there now been a cease and desist on this yet???
---
you could just use the plex wallet and be 100% safe though
---
You know how you get all those cheap fake or replica electronics, clothes, etc from China? This is one of those - they dont give a shit about Intellectual property/Trademarks/Cease and desist
---
All planned at the bbq
---
Good for you, wish you all the success and happiness IRL.

1. I don‚Äôt think your first response is fundamentally true, I think first of all if CCP where to make FW better you would see a lot of players come over which would completely change the demographics of the current factions. I think there are a lot of players who are tired of having to fly 30 jumps  to find content in null because of the blue donut, only to have the people they are trying fight not undock and have to turn around and go all the way home. I think there are currently tons of small gang corps with players thinking about leaving the game because of just a lack of content. I think there are a lot of players who are tired of exhausting Corp recruitment processes and just want a place we‚Äôre they can join up and kill stuff. I think there is a distinct possibility that if CCP were to fix FW so that we have more consistent content, current FW players would be a minority in the new system. This means that you can just look at the politics of our current system and automatically apply them to the politics of the new systems everything would fundamentally change.
---
2. I don‚Äôt think pushing  for an elective position is asking for abuse. The Corp wouldn‚Äôt function how normal player corps function. The ceo wouldn‚Äôt have the power to kick people or anything like that. Additionally the LP wallet can only be spent on launching war efforts and upgrading systems, the Corp LP wallet can not be cashed out or accessed in any other way.  
---
3. Not sure what your getting at here, the elected official is just their to declare war efforts and upgrade systems. Being that they are elected by the majority they will most likely listen to what the majority of players in their faction wants. If you‚Äôre in the minority and are upset by something going on in the faction then you will either need to convince other people in your faction to side with you or recruit more people from outside your faction to join up and side with you. But again the only thing there for you to really not be happy with is what systems the leader is declaring war efforts in. It might be easier to switch my idea from a ‚ÄúCorp CEO‚Äù to an ‚ÄúAlliance Director‚Äù and still allow individual corps to sing up. 
---
3. The system is self balancing, yes the increased LP will encourage snowballing but the more LP being rewarded the less valuable it becomes. Also the new system is extremely bot and farmer unfriendly so you will see less volatility in waves of people moving between the factions. You could also implement something where the more systems you control will continually raise the cost of launching new war efforts. Thereby slowing war progression a bit and making losses more punishing as a faction controls more and more of the war zone.
---
4. I don‚Äôt think the system is as nearly or as worthwhile to abuse as you as well as some others who have commented believe. The objectives will be based around the fronts of the war. If the objective is to score kills on 20 individual  players of the opposing faction. You could very well enlist 20 alts in the opposing faction(have them all subbed(you would need 7 subbed alt accounts for this)  or to violate TOS by circumventing the alpha login rule) and farm them over and over to meet the objective. But if the war zone is active and full of content, I think that in the end it would most likely be a lot easier and faster to just jump into a fleet and get on some kill mails. From a development perspective it‚Äôs impossible to design a system that can‚Äôt be abused or exploited in some way. So the idea is to make it more work to cheat the system then it is to just do things the intended way. As for your CEO idea, first of all those objectives are just rough examples, secondly you would have to have more alts in the opposing faction then they have actual players to get your alt elected. The only way this is probable to happen is if FW is completely dead like it is now. If FW stays completely dead then this entire system was a failure anyway and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether or not it was a good objective to begin with.
---
Overall I think you as well as many others are trying to apply these ideas to what you currently know to be faction warfare. And I think that this is the wrong thing to do because the current system is so bad that if we were to implement a new good system that the meta, demographics and gameplay style would change so radically that it would really be recognizable in terms of what we see today.  In the current system there isn‚Äôt a single reason for people who care about PvP as their main priority to participate in any of the FW mechanics.
---
-FW missions are against NPCs
---
-Because there is no scarcity of plex‚Äôs; players just run away to a different dead end system if you try to fight them over a plex
---
-Citadels already allow to stage from anywhere so offensive plexing and taking systems gives no PvP benefit
---
-Because of terrible mechanics FW is dead which means if you want to find consistent PvP content, the only way to do so is to quit FW and go pirate so you can hunt both sides.
---
Oppositely if your a player who wants to do FW mechanics to make money,  There is absolutely zero reason to engage in PvP because again.
---
-It‚Äôs better to just leave and find a dead system to plex in then it is to fight over a plex if your just trying to get LP
---
By introducing scarcity to the war zone it forces people who want to farm to fight over the resources. This fighting will then attract PvPers who want to get in on the action. At a root level this is what my proposal is about. All the other things that go with it are just features to add more depth  and player choice to the war zone.

Without needing any surrounding information this sounds like a typical issue that can be fixed by a) restarting your pc or b), looking through services in your taskmanager, and forceclosing anything that is eve related. Sounds like a faulty background task that bugged out, and because its running already eve cannot open it again.

This is why wormhole space is superior. Mass limits prevent turbo blobbing.

&lt;3 Thanks for the time you've devoted to the CSM man, was awesome having you around!

We're playing the game our way, as a small independent sovholding alliance, something everyone says doesn't exist or is dead. We've had multiple groups form coalitions to try to evict us and we're still here doing our thing with less numbers in our entire alliance than most major alliances could flashform for a drunk roam.

&gt;Sort: I'm arguably one of the most storied and known leaders in EVE.

Cool Story Sortdragon
---
Good for you? I do things that I find fun in the game, not chase a number. I could have made an army of research and manufacturing alts and made trillions too, but I dont find the logistics of that and juggling a shitload of accounts to be very fun. So, I don't do it. I have my little manufacturing niche on 5 characters on 2 accounts and blow my money doing dumb shit.
---
....What the fuck. Better reinstall *Windows* when a single third party program isn't working. What kind of fucking logic is that.
---
thanks ! was good working with you !
---
how does short dragon keep falling upwards
---
answers on a postcard please
---
First, I looked at who was eliminated as last during the elections in June. Then I re-analyzed the data while removing Killah Bee from the equation and for both Sort Dragon was a candidate that was getting on the CSM.
---
thank you ! was good to meet all of you !
---
You can join haulers channel and contract it. Standard rates are 1m/jump for every billion of collateral...for stuff under 1 bil collateral the rate defaults to a minimum of 1 mil per jump.
---
E.g, contracts of 300 mil, 500 mil, 700 mil or 1 billion collateral, would all have a price of 1m/jump, a 2 bil collateral would be priced at 2 mil per jump, a 5 bil collateral (yes people run those if they pay well) is 5mil/jump and so on.
---
These are the minimum acceptable rates to not be called out as a cheapskate or have the contract sitting there for ages. Apart from that, the more you pay, the less you wait. The less you pay, the more possible it is that nobody will pick it up unless they happen to be close and don't want to go back empty, or a newbro takes in a tech1 hauler, he gets ganked and your stuff never arrives. Sure, you get the collateral, but that 's not always convenient (eg, people who run industry jobs and need materials moved).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The other option is to move it yourself.
---
Use BRs when you have cheaper stuff to move, or your route is away from major ganking spots. BRs are squishy, a tanky sunesis can get comparable (or better) EHP and is also a pretty good hauling ship for low volume cargo (you can get it to instawarp with 13k EHP or thereabouts on alpha clone skills, which will survive a tornado volley).
---
For moving expensive stuff to trade hubs, use a DST. For example, a properly fit occator for hisec runs is not cheap, but it has ab, mwd, mjd, a cloak (not cov ops, just the improved one) and 410K ehp heated with faction hardeners (that's on my 11 mil SP alt, i think you can push close to 500k EHP with better tanking skills). If you keep in mind that the average tornado volley is 11k damage, it would take more than 37 volleys to pop you. Concord will arrive much sooner than that, so they essentially need 37 tornados.
---
However, this won't work if your are cruising semi-afk, because these are active hardener fits. Other fits exist with passive hardeners and they can get respectable amounts of EHP, but if you want the most buffer possible, you have to go active and heat them (DSTs have a 100% bonus on overheating AB, MWD, reps/shield boosters and hardeners).
---
Fits vary between the different races, but the basics are the same for all 4 DSTs. Have dock/undock bookmarks for the main hubs, always use the cloak/mwd trick (and be ready to overheat the tank if a gate NPC decloaks you and there are tornados on the gate, use your mjd if you have one), carry some nanite paste to repair your hardeners, keep a repackaged frigate without rigs in your cargo hold and the modules to fit it for align time and passive tank to scout out routes and make bookmarks, and you're set. There's a guy in haulers channel that was running freight during burn jita without any problems at all.
---
I see Xenuria talking on the CSM discord. I'd rather have Sort.
---
I haven't played the game in 7 years and have no intention of ever coming back since they released skill injectors.  I'd be perfect!
---
I‚Äôd trust you with my wallet.
---
Before becoming totally unimportant in EVE this was probably the last straw, before Mango, by buying RR, pushed Darkness out of "their new acclaimed space". Now Mango sees him probably as valuable asset, being able to make propositions to increase the life conditions in Deklein, making Bot-Lifes less miserable. Something like "don't ban our 24/7 active players, that never sleep", they are no bots, only humans with too much coffee consumption.
---
Ahh So falcon?
---
&gt;Never heard of that ...
---
\-You 26 minutes ago
---
Good call
---
And for you it's me giving lesson about english or me saying I never heard of that rule ?
---
Arguably, sort sounded like a man when begging the Imperium to defend his coalition.  
---
Yup works for pretty much anything.
---
CCP Ghost asks for examples of improvements that CSM would like to see:
---
*Current roles are confusing and not self-descriptive
---
*Ship Replacement Program
---
*Fleet pings in the notifications list
---
*Topping up the SRP wallet is difficult
---
*A blacklist system
---
*A combined UI for everything that a CEO needs to run a corp(ACLs roles etc.)
---
*Alt and member tracking 
---
CCP Ghost asks about the recruiting process and members explain that some of them have an internal screening system. It is acknowledged that recruiting is difficult for new groups and that the ability to kick people out faster would be appreciated.
---
Suitonia brings up the Agency and Fleet Finder. He thinks that a public Fleet Finder could help form tribes. The bottom line is that the number one way to get people to stay in the game is to get them to play with other players and give them an identity in a form of a group.
---
**Sort Dragon suggests making the Keepstar logo bigger.**
---
niiiiiice enjoy the game time \o/
---
Are you a bot? How can you be happy about that decision? If RMT could buy people in EVE, Mango would have long ago gathered enough money to make him their property and he would have said "yes please".
---
Great another pro-botting CSM member can now take the chair.
---
Nice one man thanks for the follow up.
---
question: was the data basis cleaned by all the accounts which got banned until now as ccp looked over the data?
---
Is the game still in a state where small corps live out in nul sec, especially mining corps?
---
no. the game has shifted to mega alliances and unfortunately most small corps have joined with one of the major players.
---
Is the recruitment process still the same as it always was (i.e., post in general, and see who bites).
---
there's /r/evejobs and probably some place on the forums but no one really uses the forums anymore
---
What should I expect to be asked to provide as part of the corp interview (I remember in the old days I had to provide a limited API key).
---
expect to be asked for full apis (now esi) for most groups. Pandemic Horde is famous for not having any requirements to join their main corp, including esi, I do not recommend them though.
---
What scams should I be on the lookout for?
---
recruitment scams are kinda gone, sadly. most of the scams from your era are still present. we now have player owned structures called citadels that allow the owner to set the tax rate so a majority of the markets have shifted to those. those structures also have an "approved" list for characters to dock so don't buy something before checking if you have docking rights. 
---
What should I check the corp for in order to be sure I'm not joining Uncle Chuckles gang of 4 alts in nul sec and no one else.
---
What do serious mining corps expect their miners to be able to do/fit/etc. When I used to do it, it was a small corp of about 15 people. I was expected to rat my own belts and haul my own ore (hence my alt). So my hulk mined, and my alt ratted and hauled.
---
those types of corps aren't really around in null anymore. train a rorqual, those got buffed to the point of the game significantly changing them. wealth has inflated beyond control.
---
Any other general advice would be appreciated.
---
if you like mining try goons or horde, I would recommend goons over horde personally for your playstyle.
---
Lol no this isn‚Äôt jack this is an even more irrelevant pet called Jessie.
---
So I've starting exploring C1/2/3 wormholes for Relic sites. I've been in two now where I've encountered sleepers at every site.
---
Aren't sleepers not supposed to spawn at Relic sites until C4 and higher? Or am I getting something wrong here?
---
Me?  I'm just 3rd partying in on an existing dispute.  You'll have to take it up with the guy above.
---
Gee mal as a test diplomat shouldn't you be happy that one of your allies is on the csm?
---
Thanks for all the fish dude in every regard.
---
How about the other way around --- it has extremely high DPS at first but it gradually decreases? In return it is completely unable to target subcaps.
---
That way it becomes the ideal dreadbomb ship but if you miscalculated, you are fked.
---
60 days is like $30 and 25b in plex is over $200
---
Cause given my understanding of the progression system of eve, in general, it seems like lots of progression are hugely time based and are vertical, which means that I will spend a huge amount of time to be just as competent as any average player... 
---
What I wish to do is doing some solo/group pve contents for fun and little by little progress, like hauling cargos and kill npc pirates for bounties etc, like in elite dangerous. And also, being able to chill around in my shop and have some fun walking here and there.
---
Maybe. The Hookbill looks nice, but costs a bit more than a Breacher ^^"
---
Although, the engagement range of a navy faction frigate is generally higher than a T1 frigate, and it could be nice. But I'd need to do some training with a cheaper ship first, regarding missile in PVP in FW, and maybe passive shield tanks as I often see Hookbill fits sporting a MSE.
---
Thank you for your reply =)
---
Thank you! I was actually curious but not enough to look up RMT prices.
---
Let me clear something up. The reason you don't run abyss in Jita is because anyone who wants to knows they can drop combat probes and get a runner at any time with minimal fuss.
---
Hauling things has its own rules. Much of the advice already given here covers much of it.
---
Oh I was going off of CCP prices
---
Most systems use a confirm delivery using a middleman for payment.when you dont get the plex they dont get paid by the middleman. In this case they'll have no evidence to say the person did in fact get the plex so they will be forfeit the funds.
---
oooh well I'm sure RMT isk is cheaper? Or no one would buy it, lol.
---
"EVE is a game of spies and betrayal... Oh, hello Mr. RMTer, can I interest you for a plex-doubling-service?" \^\^
---
I would assume it is
---
RMT middle men are a thing? What a world.
---
Last week i soloed a carrier in my leshak after injecting 3 marijuana intravenously shit was cash money
---
Remind me what RMT is.
---
He said it was in a cargo container. Killing a ship for rmt is terrible business when loot fairy says no
---
&gt;Cause given my understanding of the progression system of eve, in general, it seems like lots of progression are hugely time based and are vertical, which means that I will spend a huge amount of time to be just as competent as any average player..
---
SO yes, training happens in real time. To fly a titan can take over a years training (for example). Having more skills doesnt make you better in this game. There are skill injectors in the game that you  can buy when you have money (if you wish). 
---
&gt;What I wish to do is doing some solo/group pve contents for fun and little by little progress, like hauling cargos and kill npc pirates for bounties etc, like in elite dangerous. And also, being able to chill around in my shop and have some fun walking here and there.
---
There are small groups you can join that run incursions etc. Join a good group is the best advice i can give. Dont just accept the 1st random invite you get (and you will get them). Find out what activities you enjoy in game then find a group that can help you master that.
---
Damn, if that's a foot long, it must be 20 feet tall, sweet!
---
Do you wanna end up like Becky?
---
Because that's how you end up like Becky.
---
I suppose congratulations are in order.
---
Then you look like the intended recipient and risk the banhammer.
---
The effort to ENSURE your loot is the same and the others to ensure they get it.
---
How are you so fucking dumb?
---
Next Hateless dread week just got a little more insane right?! ;)
---
You know that he _just_ missed out on being on 14, right? I beat him by 12 votes.
---
CCP reran the election, excluding Killah Bee, and he got on.
---
nothing of value lost, nothing of value gained.
---
I was just trying to take some pretty screenshots for an article, ended up with 60 days game time and a crazy story. EVE is bonkers.
---
Lmfao now that's the spirit
---
Thanks! We‚Äôre glad to be back :)
---
Can we not
---
Your mom is higgs rigged
---
&gt;Highest DPS without sacrificing tank
---
This is an invalid question
---
I did, got it safely back to the station and filed a petition to see if it was legit or RMT. Better than risking a ban for accidentally picking up some RMT PLEX.
---
Fun fight TDSIN - thx guys :)
---
Or a ban.
---
If you'd left off the ellipsis, then you'd have an excuse, that you're not implying the speaker was incorrect.
---
You used it. 
---
(For reference, there are references back 700 years of people using singular they)
---
Ok
---
Great video, great fight.   Thanks for sharing it!
---
i'll restate again-
---
my opinion is that if you put forth the effort to do PvE content, you should have an advantage over the person who simply wishes to steal your gains.
---
You only have an advantage if you spend an absurd amount of effort/resources to the point the PvE in the first place wasn't worth it anyway, since a simple loot thief has a really good shot at getting it before you.
---
That's why it got nerfed, because it's not fair nor worth doing once thieves are out.
---
I guess on paper, it seems we agree wormholes are too safe. However, I think your solution is very likely the kind that would result in negligible change and would need a year to cause an almost indetectable drop in income.
---
I suppose there is a reasonable chance your suggestions are in good faith, but they are also essentially inseparable from someone who acknowledges that WH income is in fact too high, but doesn't really want to make a relevant dent in it and therefore proposes something that effectively results in a "wait and see"-approach despite the predictability of the outcome.
---
Underrated comment lmao
---
You seem to be confusing "objective truth" with proveable facts.
---
Traded almost 14 months of omega for 2 months. Yup, that's a CCP trade.
---
Ty. A good varient is "yo moms can roll an H296 in one pass."
---
Ik Loki is better Not the point.  
---
Legion.  
---
Puls Laser + Cov Cloak + scram + 1 rep legion.   
---
I have a fit. Whats ur opinion on this in general?
---
Two major changes I‚Äôd love to see:
---
1.) Add faction capital BPCs to pirate LP stores, including Angel ones, and increase their build requirements to bring them in-line with current Serpentis caps. Introduce analogues to the Serpentis Capital Microprocessor for each pirate faction. 
---
I‚Äôd like to see acquiring these BPCs become a viable income source for a larger number of players. Getting them should be an activity requiring lots of hard work, but one with a more clear progression to success. Sotiyos are so random and frustrating. A lot of faction caps are pointless hangar trophies at current price points, and with recent balance passes affecting capitals, this wouldn‚Äôt really make caps more oppressive. Even as an LP store item, they would still be expensive and hard to come by. 
---
Add NPC space, stations, and agents to more areas of nullsec. This is good for both PVE and PVP. 
---
2.) Give Black Ops battleships T2 resists and change the bonus on the Widow. They‚Äôre expensive and have strict fitting requirements, requiring lots of bling. As one of two cyno-capable ships, at least make them more survivable. Give us an incentive to use them more often because they‚Äôre fun ships to fly.
---
Whaaat? Link to vids?
---
C4 and higher is when they spawn exclusively.  
---
C1/2/3 also have a chance to spawn ones with rats aswell as ones without rats  
---

This is disgusting. They log in, activate lootscript and mjd out before the wreck even materialises. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
MAKE 'EM FRY!!!! Fuck that rmt shit, good on you for keeping the plex market clean.
---
I too struggle with clicking cloak and opening containers
---
Like i should be given the nobel peace prize for figuring out how to click my cloak and then open a wreck
---
Fuck.  If only it were doable.  But that‚Äôs just too many steps for the average human,  I totally see why you are sucking this guy‚Äôs dick.
---
If i could cloak and then loot something fuck man, I think i‚Äôd legitimately rule the world with the mass effort and brilliance id have
---
You are like a private detective
---
lemme grab that booty
---
his advantage is not having to kill the sotiyo and being able to be afk until it dies and being able to do it solo, hence putting forward no effort
---
i'd rather be the thief than the killer any day of the week
---
like i've already said, multiple times
---
I hope ccp can learn something from you. Also I hope they let you keep some of it.
---
I have no idea, I'm just sitting here laughing like a maniac.
---
Seems like they risked a freighter to me and lost it?
---
Op would probably be seen as the "assumed recipient/buyer" and possibly banned for not reporting it.
---
we loot faster than him . so pls stop beeing dense
---
More whine from a guy who sits in a teleport hub with access to the entire universe and they tell other people they have it too easy.
---
Wow, all the talk about PIRAT being a bunch of pussies ‚Ä¶ yet they show up today, outnumbered, to fight you &amp; all your little friends ‚Äì and you run away, losing the timer!
---
It's almost like you have no idea how to play EVE, having spent all your time camping Jita 4-4 in your blap loki with blanket wardecs against all big alliances!

\^ This is the actual EVE experience of Doctor Per ‚Äì he was kicked off Jita 4-4 undock by PIRAT and all of this is his little vendetta
---
Keep pinging for your "ops" on reddit buddy ‚Ä¶
---
A classic
---
How do you cloak a freighter please share ur sekrits
---
Woop woop, that's the sound of the space police!
---
Well they're trying to buy ISK from RMTers when there are legitimate options available. So I think this counts as self-selecting against intelligence.
---
&gt; his advantage is not having to kill the sotiyo and being able to be afk until it dies
---
Sure, and just sit there...forever I guess.
---
&gt; i'd rather be the thief than the killer any day of the week
---
So...are you?
---
You‚Äôre too smart for me
---
Could be credit card fraud, not RMT.
---
More like 1 mid plus 4 gates. You really don't know what umbrella means do ya bud. If you can't jump there from main staging it's not really under the umbrella, but lets not let facts get in the way.
---
&lt;3
---
Save it mate, these idiots don't care about csm. All they care about is being anti-nullsec and their karma
---
Suitonia is loosing his eve cred, and so he is resorting to bad posting like this.  Enjoy his decline.
---
&gt;So...are you?
---
i'm neither any more, because
---
a) i make more than thieving doing other activities
---
&gt;Sure, and just sit there...forever I guess.
---
takes no effort to wait
---
It could be. Either way, criminals tend to not be smart.
---
(Really it's all a superstitious cowardly lot...)
---
Ok, what emotion and where exactly?
---
its not high risk at all, its high effort no risk, and once again it benefits the null blocs over everyone else.
---
Would love to have a real discussion about this with you on a voice chat instead of over reddit msg's :P
---
Good shitpost take the upvote
---
if you want a pve experience without the chance for pvp maybe do hisec missions or run abyssals. why do you feel entitled to have complete safety in nullsec?
---
Story and all that sweet reddit karma is priceless definitly worth it.
---
Sure. I can't Discord chat from work due to firewalls, but am usually online in later US TZ.
---
Happy to talk!
---
This is exactly the sort of thing we used to fight for. What happened? Is Vily holding you hostage?
---
Blink twice if you need us to come get you out of there.
---
It has a utility high.
---
Do what I do in these situations:  Use 4 parts of your fav alcohol and 1 part mixer of choice over crushed ice.   Mix, drink, repeat 3 times within 30 mins.
---
How will that fix my problem you ask? It won't of course, but in 30 mins you aren't going to give a flying f\*\*k about Eve.
---
There would be no way for Ccp to tell if he wasn't the buyer otherwise... He did the right thing.
---
Slightly over 10% value as a reward?  Not bad really.
---
not really?
---
unless you call having a super umbrella and 100 man fleets shipped by ansiblex high risk
---
You cab create isk by botting. Buy plex with isk.
---
Its the same thing
---
Marius Quizo. Are you still playing? I just started started again. Currently running a high sec Corp for some friends while they learn the game.
---
Yo momma so fat, shipping her chair is what collapsed the Eve gate.
---
Your mom is so fat she bumped a Keepstar and it unanchored.
---
Yeah, they said they shut down that specific operation but clearly it's much bigger than one guy.
---
This is a ship that was killed, and there's a lot going on. 
---
For reference, this ship is an Avatar, which is a Titan class ship.  That's the biggest class of ship in the game. Just the hull alone is estimated at 65 bullion ISK (in game currency), which is a few hundred dollars if one were to try to buy it outright, depending on the path you took. 
---
The big thing that is being pointed out is the "1600mm steel plates II" and "1600mm rolled tungsten compact plates" that are equipped to the ship.  Ship equipment comes in 4 general sizes: small, medium, large, and capital.  Usually you're allowed to put any module on any ship, but it's rarely a good idea to use the wrong size.  Too big and it takes too much fitting (limited resources ships get, for deciding which equipment to use). Too small and it has little effect. 
---
A 1600mm steel plates II module is for large ships, while this is the largest of capital ships.  The appropriate module is 25000mm steel plates II. To understand just how wide this difference is, the module used gives 4,800 hp, while the one that should have been used gives 75,000. The proper one is much more expensive, about 100 million vs about 2 million, but remember that these are roundoff error compared to the 65 *billion* hull. 
---
*****
---
The horror doesn't stop there. The weapons used are T1. To understand this, there are several categories modules use in EVE. Roughly sorted from cheapest but worst to best but most expensive:
---
* T1: produced by players using basic resources (has no symbol next to icon)
---
* Meta: usually dropped by NPCs. For capital modules, produced by players using rare resources (also no symbol)
---
* T2: produced by players using uncommon resources (orange II symbol).  These take extra time to train to use
---
* Faction: bought from NPCs after doing enough work for them (green diamond)
---
* Deadspace: looted from rare NPCs (blue +)
---
* Officer: looted from extremely rare NPCs (purple symbol)
---
This ship is using T1 guns (thankfully they're capital guns, at least). This is one place where you *really* don't want to cheap out. Meta guns are readily available for a trivial increase in price, but really you should use T2. Players are chastised for using T1 or meta guns on dreadnaughts, a much smaller capital ship.  To make the same mistake on a Titan is really foolish. 
---
******
---
Next we look to the rigs.  Rigs are a special kind of module that gets destroyed if you unequip it. They come in T1 and T2 only. 
---
New players often overlook rigs since they're *slightly* out of the way, but a Titan pilot has no excuse. 
---
You get up to 3 rigs on this ship, and they use a resource called calibration.  This particular ship gets 400 points of calibration.
---
This pilot has only equipped two rigs, leaving one slot open.  Worse, they used T1 rigs which are cheaper (though again.... 65 billion hull) and use less calibration, but have less effect.
---
This pilot has used only 100 of the available 400 calibration and only 2 of the available 3 slots.  They could have easily fitted three trimark armor pump II rigs, as that's only 225 calibration.  This isn't even the best option, just a really obvious improvement.
---
There's also the amusement of the afterburner being on there.  Admittedly I'm no Titan pilot so maybe I'm missing something, but it seems out of place.  
---
In EVE in general the bigger the ship the slower it moves.  Afterburners make you move faster, but at some point you're just "fast, for a glacier." A ship this size will generally move by warps and jumps, not regular flying through space. 
---
As a final piece of horror to take in, there's a link for "capsule" under related kills. Each pilot additionally has 10 slots (plus a few special ones) to use implants. 
---
Like rigs these are destroyed when removed, but they are attached to the pod inside the ship, not the ship itself.  Implants can give anything from faster manufacturing time to better damage with weapons.
---
Many players don't bother with combat implants because they're so permanent and players like to switch between ships. However, a fun characteristic of Titans is that they can never dock. This means once a pilot enters the Titan they will likely stay in that ship until it is destroyed, and by the point your Titan gets destroyed it's highly likely your pod goes down, too. 
---
In essence, the pod is extra fitting room that can and should be used. 
---
When we look at this player's pod, though, we find it was completely empty.  They *should* have dropped a couple billion on implants, but just didn't bother. 
---
I'm sure I've missed something about this fit being terrible, but hopefully that gives you some background on why players are recoiling so hard.  Most players will never fly a Titan and many will never even see one.  For someone to lose one so stupidly is frustrating, but at least serves as a reminder that P2W only gets you so far.
---
So, as usual, the problem leads back to botting
---
Dammit CCP just fix botting
---
Yeah it's beginning to look that way, the 7,430 is one of the tiers you can buy PLEX in.
---
Yeah ok. If you put it that way. You're right... But they can't confiscate the isk from the seller, so may as well take the plex
---
Okay so it was created legally, but obtained illegally then. Doesn't change anything.
---
You wrote me an essay dude, enjoy the Gold.
---
Definitely credit card fraud, both times it was 7,430 PLEX which is the $249 price tier.
---
Affect is the verb.
---
Effect is the noun.
---
You're now r/Eve famous lol XD
---
...What C5 sites are you running and how? I'd like to be bored with many bil in the bank ;.;
---
I might have to resub. Some of my favorite Eve time was with Noir. ...shit, 10 years ago.
---
Pretty sure that's how it worked in Dust 514 for the passive SP pool. Come back to the game and have an unallocated amount to apply anywhere in the skill tree.
---
Thanks!  Sure beats being productive!
---
Don't know why I didn't figure it out earlier, but 7,430 is the $249 PLEX purchase tier. So speum is probably right that it's credit card fraud.
---
*in my great and unmatched wisdom...*
---
At one point vehements were being self destructed for profit. They also come from the serpentis LP store instead of pirate sotiyos.
---
Nah it was hella gay and I'm glad it got changed even if it doesn't benefit me
---
Looks like it's exactly the number you get from the $249 price tier so they are probably credit card fraud.
