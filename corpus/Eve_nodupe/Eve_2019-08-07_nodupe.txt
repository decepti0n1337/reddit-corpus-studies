I love how each region has its own "look" to it.  You can actually enjoy just flying around New Eden like some kind of damn tourist.

Of course, having multiple teams don't create queues and if someone lures a multitude of tickets instead of delivering some deserved, accurate and true to fact information, why not?. Since there are so many teams, each dedicated so specifically, and never one does the job of the other, it's perfect!
---
Yap, well.. NO!

&gt;There are more than 100 upvotes on that review

Why do you think that's a large number?  And, for that matter, do you think consensus among a limited population is the same thing as fact?
---
There are hundreds of morons who attend flat-earth conventions every year.  Does that make their position factual?

Battlecruisers aren't used very often anymore, they've been replaced by assault ships in fleet fights and small gangs after CCP introduced a damage control module that gives you huge resists for a short period of time (usually enough to catch reps or finish off a target). A new line of ships from the Triglavian race also came out that are particularly well suited for small gang and anti-cap fights (the "kiki" another guy mentioned in his comment).
---
T3Cs got a controversial balance pass. Lokis are the most commonly used now but they're not as strong as they were. Tengus are good in small gangs but I'd lean toward cloaky sniper fits with them.
---
Besides all the good advices on this post about isk making and joining newbro friendly corps, I'd like to add a piece of advice: consider your ships as tools that will eventually break and need replacement, there's no shame in losing one in any way as long as you learn why you died and try to avoid the same mistake again... even so, you'll keep dying pretty often (I personally consider my ship lost the moment I hit "undock"), which brings us to the golden rule: *don't fly what you can't afford to lose*.

Hope you find a good group and stick around this time!

Gank catalysts have zero tank, procs have an assload of tank and shit out dps with light drones.  Being awake means you can start popping the catalysts, and if you can get enough DPS off the field ASAP you can survive.

no they like catalyst
---
I haven't played in several years. What are those explosions things?
---
I didn't say they were going jihad mode, just that they are flexing. Nothing wrong with that, a group that size should do so from time to time
---
I've been cloaky camping horde and making ghost noises in local and extorting isk from scaredbeans or noodling around in wh space until my subs expire. I canceled them both around the time of the drifter thing to sync them up in August, they were both for different amounts on different days of the month, but I have no confidence in CCP and I don't think they have a clue what they are doing so I'll probably just revert to alpha. I have enough isk and skills to have fun as an alpha for a good while.
---
Looking back over the past year or so CCP have done nothing of interest to me and can't even remove local in null without it fucking up. They have no clue why the game is popular, no clue how to retain players and no clue how to make interesting and engaging content. The only interesting pve content is incursions or exploration, the rest is boring and stupid. The only thing making this game fun is the players themselves, ccp should just fuck right off it.
---
 It’s not an exploit it's called a life
---
There are at least some similaritiesm

Of course, that number is probably way down right now, he paid for a lot of those with cloaky camping contracts, and now cloaky camping is dead

---
I've bookmarked the system and I plan on taking roams there as well as going there solo. Killing 600m worth of mining ships is fun and I could bring a hauler alt to scoop the ore they mine. Free kills AND money!
---
Hauling is a pretty specific career. As a complete newbie with little ISK to your name, it can be rough. Typically players get some ISK together in other ways before getting into it and making good enough income for it to serve as their profession, although i have seen newbies come into haulers channel and make their way to high collateral hauling using low-paying contracts combined with trading.
---
It sounds like you lost your tayra in lowsec; T1 industrials, as you probably found out, are pretty allround poor but defnitely don't fare well in lowsec. Most people use a sunesis (the modern newbie-friendly option) or skill right into a BR/DST, but both come back to requiring ISK to make it work.
---
Get into haulers channel ingame. I'm surprised you seem to have missed it; it's a friendly community focused around hauling. Newbies such as yourself are very welcome, it'll be a good place where you can ask questions and get immediate help/tips/advice. I am a moderator there, i know for certain there'll be plenty of people able and willing to answer any question you have.
---
Oh and since you seem a bit lost on ship types/acronyms, i commissioned [this helpful sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cmxm8q/fairly_new_guy_here_trying_to_make_money_by/) the other week for us in HC that lists all the sizes and roles of the various ship types used for hauling.
---
Not strictly true. Plenty of people do make good ISK ferrying things exclusively in BR and DST.
---
They are. Lots of people use them specifically for mission running, I've seen people recommend them.
---
I'd like to see a bit of lowsec and nullsec in empire systems.
---
1.0-0.9 Concord in charge of everything, gates, stations, not even faction navies or customs agents can beef on their turf.  Fine you for speeding, even out in the Oort cloud.  Basically starter systems.
---
0.8-0.3 Gates patrolled by faction navies.  Faction navies enforce all flagging violations if eligible.  
---
Flagging only occurs within 1AU of faction assets in 1.0 space, or within view of faction npcs.  Most npcs are diamond type, peaceful unless aggressed.  In 0.5 space, protection only extends 0.5AU, and so forth.  
---
Belts are massive though, and deepspace belts and pve zones beyond civilized space can become "no-flagging" or FFA zones if there are no neutral NPCs or beacons around.  Most NPCs in highsec will belong to the empire corporations.  The missions they give you will relate to their interfaction struggles.
---
Below 0.5, faction navies lose the ability to lock gates or.. uh.. collapse wormholes at will using scanners.  You can escape or logoff even if flagged in these systems, but only once your log-off timer expires of course.
---
In 0.4 and below systems, outlaw faction stations and sites start to show up.  
---
Outside of 1.0-0.9 systems, where pirates don't exist ever, pirate NPCs and their assets cast a flagging suppression field in proximity to their position, inversely proportional to the system security.  Bad things can happen in the shadow of Justice, and with no flags, no-one will know.
---
In 0.8 and below systems, faction navies can be knocked off gates, although they will reinforce in greater numbers after a little while.  The rate and frequency of this escalation scales in a non-linear way with system security.
---
One interesting wrinkle is that running combat missions anywhere can get you scanned down and spanked, unless those mission sites involve state representatives.  
---
Mining alone can be risky, especially if you do it afk and your diamond npc minders quit the field.  The nice, untouched roids will be out in the wildlands of course.  The only thing that protects you out there, is that you are suppressed on d-scan.
---
This is false.
---
Because for every example of "look eve isn't P2W this guy spent loads of irl cash and died" there is someone injecting 100 rorq pilots and not dying, and instead flooding the markets with more ore.

That's fine, I commend you on your honesty.
---
noone keeps you from doing that besides yourself.
---
Aha it must be the command bursts. That came just after I stopped playing. Thanks!
---
Liquidate your assets, buy a few choice PVP/PVE ships, join a wormhole corp, then whenever you login you will have a random situation outside to explore/exploit how you see fit.
---
Just don’t keep to much there, if between times of activity the station gets wacked you loose your stuff, if you have alts, you can keep your most valuable ships logged out at safe spots.

I tend to agree but it's also like a property rights / castle doctrine / get off my lawn situation. Don't go messing around on other people's lawns without tether and not expect consequences, and likewise, you should not penalize someone for defending their space property.

Really awesome kills, you deserve every isk of that loot pinhata, well done!

Welcome to Eve scams.
---
CCP already said they have a working killmail system in beta that can do this but it's not on the priority for rollout.
---
I am trying real fucking hard to process that Marshall fit. I get wanting to use it as a blingy combat ship, I really do, but fitting it like a L4 Rattlesnake and then trying to fight a cruiser sized target is bizarre as fuck.
---
Oh god don't. Join anyone else.
---
Null and low sec are easy. High sec absolutely terrifies me.
---
Thanks. I like rpg and strategy games because I am not that skilled. I want to have an edge in fights because I kept my account subbed and trained into the ships I fly to their maximum ability.
---
A new guy would probably beat me in a frigate 1v1 because it doesn't take long to max frigate skills, but I feel like I should be able to best him in a battleship 1v1, for example.
---
It's mostly a distance thing. God knows how far the camera is away from that gate and the ships surrounding it, but it should be a few hundred km at least. 
---
PS: This wasn't actually a fight. It's from an op around an ihub in Frat space earlier today. We (horde fleet) didn't see much action, which is why I had the time to take some ** k i n o ** footage in the first place.
---
People make isk, but compared to other activites, I wouldn't call it good isk.
---
Doesn't sound like a bad idea. I have been thinking of doing the same against Cartel rats.
---
Start hauling in High sec only until you have a handle on things. Read ALL contracts carefully. Join the Haulers chat channel- this is where the good contracts are listed.

As soon as a ganker opens fire you're free to shoot back with no consequences

 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) These guys could give you a few pointers in the right direction or at least bookmark the page so you can do a bit of lite reading or find a fit for your ship .

Always pay CODE.

I'm an alpha, can I get a cloak or do I gotta go omega for that?
---
I agree.  Increase warp speed, align of caps, remove cyno beacons altogether  Add cyno beacons for jump drives to citadels.
---
You can jump to citadels without having alts.  You can jump gates to get into combat after your jump to citadels. 
---
Leave cynos on recons, stealthy ships for mobile jumping / blops.
---
Ok
---
and people are saying eve is p2w heh
---
Look.you aren't special for almost 2 decades Stain never had a low sec gate. And it never will.

what is your ingame name so I can wire you some isk

We don't, if you find any just report it to dran with video proof

I was able to make over 5 bil in a week haulling/market manipulating but it required an investment of nearly 10bil. This involved running a freighter in dangerous space with 3 of my own toons (scout, webing alt, freighter) and a full intel channel for the dangerous areas in and near lowsec.
---
The issue with haulling is it can be used to pay for a trip (pickup in trade hub and drop off near home system) but otherwise without a high investment you likely wont turn much of a profit. If you are interested in haulling i would stay away from contracts to start and instead move items between regions or trade hubs. At least until you get the hang of avoiding gate camps and scam contracts I find it is a safer way of making isk.
---
Same as this thanks for your donation to the holy cause feel free to check ingame bio 👍

Gonna steal your setup and ideas, the ultimate form of flattery. :P

That does lock you out of Heavy Assault Ships which are typically worth the extra cost.

Beyond that it's all to do with use case. Your not going to spend billions blinging a Interceptor for fleet tackle.

If this guy spent that much on a Marshal he was actually going to use properly, that's not a totally unreasonable amount to spend.

Send a message to Chyria in game and I will set you up
---
You can make it fit 1600m3 and align in less than 2 seconds with only decent skills, and about 30-40 million isk. I don’t have the exact fitting memorized, but play around with t2 inertial stabilizers in the low slots, a full set of t2 cargo rigs in the high slots, and a mixture of shield extenders and adaptive invulnerability fields in the lows (to tank smartbomb camps). If you make a fit and post it in either haulers channel or rookie help you should get good feedback

Take the rest of your corp with you next time and stop being jagaloons in Thera.

I said why.
---
The irony here is so strong. Lord have mercy.
---
What makes a corp thrive is the people in it. Good people make a corp wonderful. It is like a family, so much so that it is painful when someone leaves. Bad people make a corp awful, so much so that a corp will fold with even the best of leaders. I've seen all types of corps, cults of personality, megacorps, super duper elite peeveepee corps where you had to have so many kills per month, and super casual corps where there was basically no leader at all. What I would consider to be good or bad had absolutely nothing to do with the playstyle or the leaders abilities, or their alliances, or the area of the game the corp was located. It was about the people. If I genuinely cared about my brothers and they cared about me, it was a great corp. If they didn't, it was not. If you have those people in your circle, you can make a corp. If you don't, don't bother. Find those people and then join them.
---
When ever I've been half active I join a large nullsec Corp.  Log in a few times a week just for fleets.  If funds get low, I just plexed it.  My time was to valuable to grind out isk.
---
Most fun I had half playing was back during the first brave/pandemic war.  Just whelped a ton of ships again suppior pandemic forces, twenty minutes at a time.
---
Just add in a [pop sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnMhJU6RsYU)
---
reducing to one character will make you more casual for sure.
---
You can praise him in your own time, I’m not going to bother.
---
The day I pay a mining permit to anyone is the day I uninstall EVE.
---
I will positively never happen.
---
Did you haul through lowsec in a non cloaky hauler?
---
Garbage music and a NINE FUCKING MINUTE INTRO????
---
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
---
I noticed that as well from a sansha sentry tower in a ded site, think it was just due to it being a missle tower.
---
When you are logged in and flying 100% true, and inattentiveness will be taken advantage of by roamers.
---
And the corp needs a minimum of activity to keep claim of the system, leadership and a small group of regulars keeps things going, we have like  7 structures and they are all fueled and armed, evicting us will be a effort and not worth it.
---
If everything was left low power and people didn’t get any response shooting them, a bash fleet would certainly come, but that would only happen if we neglected the stations.
---
We have several vets and newish “casuals”, they show up when they do, join up with whatever we got going on, or calls to a legit defensive fleet. That’s only needed to happen like twice in a year, we go out of our way to make attacking us a PITA and keeping our home hole secure.
---
Yeh wh is definitely not the way to whine down.
---
I’m also in favor of just joining a large null alliance/Corp with like 300 min or less fleet time required per month (5hr per month) to maintain membership but if you need to be more casual then that I would suggest hs livin or lowsec Corp with no requirements.

---
I was trying to farm some rats with it.
---
Urgh I just wasted 5 min of my life ! Reading this.
---
no
---
I can’t believe there are groups with required fleet time, is that standard in null corps now?
---
Last null group I was a part of was in Delkin in 2008 when I think BOB was fighting over the outposts there, we where asked to join the main fleets and did, when I had to go I said I was going on hiatus, it was like two years before I got kicked according to my employment history.
---
actually, if you are inside and the bubbles were not pop by a fleetmate, it doesn't look good at all for you!
---
what the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Nah... this is a good time for a summer break. 
---
No reason to log in at all, except for the free sp while waiting for subs to run out as eve is boring in its current state.
---
That marshal fit sure is something...
---
Might've. I'm getting the impression that that may have been a bad idea?
---
eve at 5 sec?
---
Of course. They got to the top by hacking. How else would they do it? Certainly no one could legitimately make that much isk without cheating. I mean it's hard enough becoming a *billionaire* in Eve.
---
highsec mission runners never learn how to fight.
---
they think they are super powerful because the missions never challenge them.
---
well, yeah.
---
EVERYONE will shoot a hauler in lowsec.
---
Doesn't even need to be "gate campers".
---
Imagine saying running ns sites aren’t a bad idea in 2019
---
Wormholes btw
---
If I'm not mistaken, all logi frigs have 5 m3 drone bays.
---
Not that you should use them, since you're logi and not dps, but it is there.
---
Poor guy must have thought the Marshal is the same ship that CONCORD have so he can one shot anything
---
The problem is probably you can't say "shit I lost connection"
---
Is there punishment for goons who don't reinforce the party line on Reddit?
---
Yeah I meant in the activity sense. In null blocks it's easy enough to disappear for a couple months in some corps and face no problems, and even if you got removed for inactivity, your stuff is all safe and it's just a matter of getting back in or asset safety. In wormholes, your shit might just be gone, so that kinda puts a pretty serious consequence for something you might not have control over. 
---
  
---
Also, what corp are you in and what is the main timezone?
---
Standard that I'm aware of is number of fleets rather than time, but could be different for every group. It's really not that bad, since it's enforced on a corp level rather than player level usually. If you've got a chill CEO, and have some players that do a lot of pvp, you can usually even the scales pretty easily to cover for people who can't participate for a period of time.
---
Yes
---
The OG Goons from the SA days are long gong
---
at least 70% of those from Pre WWB days are gone.
---
Time, my friend, is a limited commodity.
---
Reminds me of when I used to play Dayz, and spend my time in the citys at night singing songs with a hatchet in hand and a flare nearby  
---
CCP have changed their Expansion/ release model to go straight to TQ, avoiding player min/max on TQ and introducing chaotic elements.  
---
Those that like a pre-constructed safe space are freaking out ( the Ree's from delve can be heard across the galaxy"

It should flicker right before it goes out.
---
People still fall for Suspect baiting when they have those kind of assets?
---
Jesus Christ, every day I drift closer and closer to CODE. their messages is starting to make more and more sense
---
Bubbles are pretty.
---
Wait, I thought NC. swapped out their cowboy hat for a leather sex mask. As part of their new relationship with Goons. You know, where Goons show up, and NC. promptly bends over and takes it in the ass.
---
Logo can already get on killmails, just need a whore drone.

Dabble in pvp some, look up faction warfare and go well some frigates after 2 weeks or so. Make sure to train a specific gun skill to five first though! 
---
Also, have a look at exploration if pvp isn't your thing. You never know where that spooky wormhole may lead!
---
Well that was the most incompetent drop I've seen. Thanks for the lols

Because it's a zero knowledge, low effort miner Marshall.
---
Even though you've posted a large quantity of salt for many many months......

you do know there is a difference between badposting, and Plain Cringeposting right?

If hulks pulled in twice the amount they current do then it would be a different issue.
---
If panic is to be removed then you need to remove them being sieged for five minutes.
---
I wish bubbles had a despawn animation
---
A corp needs a culture. If you don't have a culture, your members don't feel any compulsion to stay.
---
Build your core group first. Push them upwards, enable them. Give them a reason to stay - and don't overload them. You need to give 110% constantly to show your dedication to them. You want to recruit your ass off but you also need to be careful who you let in - interview them, get to know them carefully with a few questions. I like to make note of their jobs, active times, hobbies and history. Make sure they'll enjoy their time and want to stick around, if I know they fit better elsewhere I push them in that direction instead of joining me.
---
To start you're probably going to PLEX a lot, unless you have assets already available for your use. You'll want to use that PLEX money to set up things like a reaction farm, PI. You'll also want some basic production using a staple resource you have to make corp level income.
---
Thank you!
---
Just to be sure, it's the cruise missiles, right? 
---
No resistance mod for tank too, but the cruise missiles are too slow to deal damage to a tengu right?
---
Alright, there's a few medium guns that are in decent shape. Lasers for sure. Beams I've been on the fence other than quad light meme lasers. Medium blasters are good. Medium rails are good on f1 fleet things. It's kinda funny you mention "f1 monkey fleet context" cos it's almost all medium guns and has been forever. That was the only purpose I've ever found them effective at.
---
Except pulses. You're right, I'm not giving the Phantasm enough credit.
---
The thing is, we're in an assault frig meta, and the terrible tracking on the majority of these guns drags them down a lot more now than a couple years ago.
---
Quality and accurate picture of the average Panda-Fam member

Best thing I can suggest is don't waste time in a corp that is not active or active during your time zone. The worst thing about this game can be playing it alone - find somewhere with friendly people willing to help you and your experience will be infinitely better
---
this is somewhere out there
---
Apparently he felt all those special event lows that boost application/damage as well as the mid guidance computer were enough to snipe a tengu? I mean it had no point.

Not enough information. You asking for universal advice.

That asteroid is likely just a set-piece, but there should be another asteroid nearby.
---
That, or the mission also gave you a special module for mining that asteroid in particular.

Mercium isn't a normal ore if I remember correctly, so you won't find it in other asteroid belts, just that mission.

Best thing I ever did was make a station trading alt with good skills. My 2 week income was more than my first 4-5 months combined. I guess you could get rich running anoms but even with a Gila or whatever it's more or less active.  I can station trade like 20 minutes a day and make 100-200 million. Im not even that hardcore about it. And it scales with isk. More you have the more you can invest. 
---
This is the guide I used to teach me. I also listen listened to a few hours of various guides. Once you figure out whats a good investment and what isn't by looking at margins and order totals you're set. Hell, ive never once opened excell. 
---
Plus I still supplement with pi. I reset every few days and make around 25 mil/day. It's consistent, reliable isk.

Try mining anyting on the place of the mission, it should get some byproduct of the ore you need

No, give me 2 bil and I will halve it!

The EVE meta doesn't stay static for very long.

Many newer people complain that by the time they get into a doctrine ship, that doctrine isn't flown anymore.
---
Injecting crabbing ships is not winning lol. Pay2win refers to being able to beat other players in fights. If you're already knowledgeable enough you win anyway you pay to reduce grinding. You can't pay your way around knowledge and skills in the game that's why it's Pay2Feed cuz a new player opening their wallet is paying to feed people a shinier killmail.

Awesome. Thank you. I knew Linus Tech Tips. I appreciate the info. 😁

This is hilarious

Was that... Ezio Auditore?
---
So you're more interested in turning people who are getting fucked in the same way against each other than fixing the problem? "Don't complain, others have been waiting longer" is retarded. With the support system as obscure, confusing, and lacking in communication as it is it's not unreasonable to ask for a little bump if you literally don't even know that a human being has even opened your ticket yet.
---
Get your assets to a safe place and join a casual Corp that you can have fun in when you decide to play.  EVE had plenty of casual PVP corps that won’t kick if you go inactive for a week or two. There are plenty of NPSI groups you don’t need to invest heavily into
---
You bet man, I enjoy going over the fits I use and some of the fights I had, feel free to skip through it to the specified time :) Also, music is personal preference. Some will like it, some will not, sorry you didn't enjoy it.
---
Do small roams PvP with cheap ships, get some fun, no need of Big Ops if you dont feel that way  
---
Talking to them on Discord prevent on losing friends, most of them will be okay  
---
Just try to show time to time and dock on NPC your toys if you expect to dont be online too often
---
EVE has many different trade hubs.  Get into regional trading and haul your own items.  Stop w/currier contracts

badposting, shitposting, cringeposting, then there is specimen D, Radioactive posting.

no more racist than what TEST has said in local to the chinese
---
Well, it will dramatically increase the cost associated with multiboxing, unless they allow emulators
---
Nah man i got the family plan.  7 phones.  7 miners let’s go
---
Clicked link with optimism then left with no hope...
---
yeah, a t3c would be ideal. Any of them would work. Generally you want to have an afterburner fitted and just have decent resists. At the very least either t2 hardeners and plex armor/shield booster or the other way around. 
---
Just be careful some of the unrated complexes are quite hard, others are a joke. You can see whats gonna spawn if you google them.
---
But, go do 6/10s in empty space dude. Itl pay VERY well and theres lots of lowsec and nullsec that is sitting empty.  If you are doing a blood raiders sig, make sure you have a large cap battery fitted else they will neut you to death.
---
Ya...I’m lying; I couldn’t be more against it
---
How could you tell?
---
I knew a guy named Mitchell from there once...
---
What did TEST say?
---
Did that guy move to Japan? Because that would be me.

Check the mining tab on the overview. (On the right hand side of screen)

The truth. That probobly over 50% of frat are botters and rmters. Ccps data shows it

Im guessing living costs is a lot lower planetside than it is in space, so those 10000 isk may let that average family live in comfort

I've interacted with some of your dudes. Seems like a good corp. A couple of people seem to have spent the past two weeks passing around that Nidhoggur killmail and laughing about how Raido took a mixed Uni/Fweddit fleet into Delve, killed a capital and routed the the response fleet with frigates, and took no losses.

Mixed active passive tank, with an LSE, then an XL shield booster, shield boost amplifier, and a bunch of cap mods to be cap stable.
---
Then Hydraulic Bay thrusters, which are range rigs and completely worthless on Cruiser. With decent skills cruise missiles on a Marshall will go 250km without any mods. 2 Bay Thrusters will put the cruises at 260km range, which is longer than the Marshall can lock even with 2 Sebo on range.
---
Then there's the capacitor power relays, which sabotage the active shield tank by reducing boost amount. Each Dark Blood cap relay reduces shield boost by 8%, the two of those cancel out half the bonus of the Caldari Navy shield boost amplifier.
---
Can someone explain what this marshal is used for?
---
They are Jedi Knights I believe
---
I think they tried to make a competitive highsec trade hub, so the consortium is deleting their structures.
---
Aaahh yeah I remember eve Vegas 2017 when they promised to buff mediums ACs then everyone forgot about it. I just want to kill frigates in my vaga without sacrificing half my tank for a web

Its a SEPARATE game, but its meant to be the same gameplay.

It says its an alternate new eden.

Whatever that means.

Time to form the Sith as counterpart...to bring balance to the force.  
---
oh btw
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?  
---
I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

So why the fuck did they declare war on everyone who I've heard of who's war eligible and make it easier to get rid of their structures, then?
---
I'm super confused. So is it Seddow who's playing EVE or just his mom? And if its his mom, who the fuck is Seddow then?
---
Noone knows, it's all a mystery.
---
This is some of the worst marketing I've seen in a long time...
---
Taiwan number one!
---
What's your point? This could be read a couple of ways.
---
Declaring war on all of New Eden seems like an odd way to attract business.
---
You just gotta roll with it, it’s not that hard.

I think the Uni forum recruitment post said that you guys want a year's experience in-game minimum. I don't have that yet. Definitely an option under consideration for later on, though. Along with NullBloc and wormhole.
---
i dont pve..... at all, yet this was relaxing and delicious.... isk man.
---
Not the Jedi we are looking for though
---
It means we need to go to r/EveMobile for shitposting
---
Sweet I signed up for Alpha test
---
Haven't played in a while, is that a bad thing ?
---
There are a few activities more non-casual in EVE than living with a group of people in wormhole space. Unless you are willing to parasitize on your fellow active corpmates and take advantage of their selfless efforts, and they are willing to let you get away with it. Even then you have to deal with extra efforts associated with being in WH.
---
Looking at the trailer, the potential for capital blobs is there. Do I need 2 phones for cynos?
---
I'm getting flashbacks from Diablo Immortal (it's the same company for those who missed, NetEase)
---
Still not sure if this is propaganda for, or against pandafam.
---
I'm one of these 70% guys. Sometimes I check evewho to see who is still there.
---
Decent trash talk. Take this up-vote and get out.
---
It's incredible how much smacktalk TEST &amp; co. can talk when they outnumber FRT &amp; co. to this degree.
---
If you havnt made any in game purchases yeah I probably would. 
---
Keep your current account because in a year (possibly less) you will be wanting alts - scouting, cyno, an incursion alt, spy alts.
---
The referall is equivalent to 20 days training so just do that then add your other account as a friend and transfer all your isk over as well as contracting your ships to your new one.
---
I mean... Why plenty of goon miners have caps? You need to throw that ISK *somewhere*
---
don't they have panfam and black legion helping them?

Turn off discord mobile notifications and move it off the front page or delete discord from your phone.
---
Start muting notifications on your discord desktop app.
---
These 2 steps are hugely helpful and mean that when you step away from the game you are a tally away from the game.
---
No, they don't. Most of the fights lately have just been WinterCo (19k) vs Legacy (40k) + Fire (8k, XIX/RED)
---
Yes they do. And not just sometimes, it's everyday or so my dude. And the comment ont small gang is somewhat skewed. From what i gathered from un-official blueing is that when it's test/brave/any legay member vs Goons. We fight to death everytime. If we see panfam on grid, the gentleman agrement is we don't shoot eachother until panfam is dead and buried. Then we fight to death.

Is this a whole new game? Whats the point on using resources on that? Better make an app that i can make/change some shit from my cellphone with industrial/skills/marketing etc etc
---
You can't deny it's a good marketing strategy.
---
Think about it, how else are they supposed to get people to make threads about it and get people engaged?
---
Oh, so it's going to be hot garbage. Gotcha.

At least CCP's not going to be (entirely) responsible this time.
---
lul
---
I'm actually even more curious who could ever use 360k+ commandburst charges?
---
Please clap.
---
CODE. doesn't repeatedly gank Procurers in 0.9 systems. They, like everyone, have to deal with the economic realities of the game and much prefer to go after undertanked ships in lower security space, ideally ones full of shinies. 
---
Just because you can be attacked anywhere does not mean there aren't safer and more riskier ways and places to mine in this game. I guarantee if you mine in a tanked Procurer in 0.9 or 1.0 system you will never be attacked by suicide gankers.

Where's FRAT's allies then?

&gt; No, they don't

I moved out to Okinawa. But I'm sure I'll end up back in Richmond one day

Looks to me like for something like dark blood or imperial navy the resistances are better (18% vs 15%). For republic fleet it seems required skills are the difference as they both are 15% and the fitting is basically zero either way. I can’t really see someone flying a confessor without hull upgrades IV though so I must be missing something

NetEase aka Microtransactions Online. Hardpass for sure.
---
I want CCP to make money and all that jazz, but I feel they misjudge the core of their userbase. I really enjoyed DUST for example, but hated the fact that it was locked to my Playstation. Im a keyboard and Mouse FPS kinda guy, and I think it was a miscalculation on CCPs behalf.
---
BUT given the success of EA, Activision etc with lootboxes, transactions etc, Im sure Hilmar will be laughing on the way to the bank, while people like me will just wonder what they could have done if they focused their development attention to fixing bugs in eve.
---
I understand the fact that NetEase dev is separate of CCP, but annoying issues like the chatclient (cant be trusted at this point), get missing skillbox when you hover over a module (which is superannoying if youre a large scale trader, and using the GUI delay feature isnt really helpful either), balancing of the game overall etc.

I was capped at 60 before I looked at the launcher settings and turned gpu rendering on. It’s in the hamburger menu on the launcher before the game starts not in video settings in game when launched. Now I get 120+ sometimes at 4k max settings if I’m only running one client.
---
Notes:
---
 1. If you have a high-density display (eg 4k) turn anti-aliasing off in the client. I was getting like 10fps before I realised that
---
 2. There is a wierd bug for me with the cursor where the mouse pointer is actually a small distance above the button it’s activating. This only happens for me with gpu rendering. To fix I go into cideo settings, flip to full screen and back to fixed window or whatever. Only have to do this once per character. No idea why it happens- it still affects the “choose which guy to play with” screen for me but fine after that
---
That’s why kids you don’t shoot at blinky yellows!
---
If you have to explain it, it’s not funny.
---
Haha I didn't expect my shitty meme to be posted here lol. 
---
For a bit of context, I got the idea from this ping:  \[Frank C. Mars 一龙@WC &amp; Friends#coalition-pings\] @​everyone  Enemy took another IHUB in Detorid today. They had a lot of men today. We must increase our effectiveness at entosis war, especially by using T2 Entosis. A guide is being written. When there is a DETORID IHUB out of RF, it is of most importance. We will do better in the future. Continuen to improve. On the weekend we will have a SOTA. Windspirit and I will address the members. We have some extra info and surprises for you. 
---
This was after they lost the XSUD-1 ihub in Detorid without basically any fighting. 
---
On most of our late night toasting fleets, our Lord and Savior (and FC) Seddow is raging that FRT won't fight him, even in their tz after two CTA pings (that's his discord avatar on the right of the pic). &lt;3 Legacy

Dunno, the gameplay they put out last year looked okay but very unrefined.

#BoycottMcDonalds
---
The gameplay they put out last year didn't look all that bad.
---
It's more about how they handle all the other stuff outside of the core gameplay
---
For me, it was going online rarely, but regularly.  
---
After some time, I found the sunday after downtime and we even organzited a regular PVE fleet in that time which my friends got used to.  
---
It was also nice to see, that my friends waited for me to log on at that time :)))
---
Ask Red Frog or PushX or go to Haulers Channel ingame, if youre interested in hauling.
---
JUST BLUE MORE PEOPLE JUST HAVE MORE PETS IT'S THAT EASY JUST INSTALL BUFFER ALLIANCES JUST DO ITTTTTT
---
(frts allies generally do show up for big timers but the coalition numbers are so hilariously lopsided it doesn't really make a dent especially considering the 1000 and 1500 timezone stuff usually happens in)
---
They were usually outnumbering us at the beginning of the war. But their fleet numbers have dropped ever since they started to ping 2 CTAs per day, surprisingly.
---
I don’t see what’s so hard, we have a HS static, so import/export is using a few haulers to get stuff to/from a station HS-side, and having pushx move it to/from Jita.
---
We are always close to whatever we need, while being almost hidden at the same time, and we are used to scanning, surviving, and fighting in jspace, micro/solo PVP heaven all day long.
---
And we have enough exploration/PI/mining/manufacturing in hole to keep everything going and to buy toys.
---
You'd think, factoring timezones- FRT would be in a stronger position- Legacy numbers in AU and China timezones are quite low. BUT HEY 50,000 LEGACY CHARACTERS AMIRITE?

Someone landed short on Paleo?

It's a different company making it, so it isn't competing for resources.

Not that it matters any more (RIP Dust), but Dust 514 supported KB/M inputs. I played it exclusively with a KB/M setup and it was great.

I also agree with the rest of your post.

It's funnier than that, he landed at 100km where I couldn't catch him without losing the Orca tackle, the seeing as he didn't hurt me slowboated (because LOL no prop mod) in tackle range (possibly to use that neut) where he was promptly dispatched.
---
They have a name you know.
---
Yeah, I did connect keyboard and mouse to my PS too, but I guess I should have been more generic in saying the limitation of the PS what was really irked me. And when you have a PC bound coregame like EVE Online, then getting the maximum amount of those players transfered over into DUST, then keep it PC.
---
Its a moot point now obviously, and discussed to death back in the days :)

It's actually about 70000 when you bring in fire and imperium
---
One full sub fleet plus a 150 ish man secondary sub fleet plus a harpy fleet for low sp dudes seems pretty good form to me in prime tz but I still think the key is we need to blue more people to win. It's that simple!
---
Ewwwwww NetEase.
---
That's IMHO the biggest failing of EVE. PvE is so different and so unchallenging it does very little to prepare you for PvP.
---
I heard a lot of time "only PvEing till I'm skilled enough for PvP" and I could only say that they were just making their first losses more expensive.
---
I had to make sure I hadn't already posted this.
---
"yeah we run 8 hour ustz marathons to ref every hub we can alongside our eso home defense Ops and perimeter stuff and eutz jb bashes but it is you trying to defend your space that is the problem!"

Why do I see people fit Grapplers on a Vindicator?
---
Isn't a web better?
---
Inquiring mind wants to know...
---
See this comment in every thread about botting, but never any specifics.
---
Post specifics, bots will be kebabed.
---
Actually you got there first by bringing sibsquad as the latest additon to the fucking goon squad. I just wish we could do better...
---
Embrace the risk and remember that Eve is just a game. It's just like playing poker. The risk is what makes it fun. If you have a habit of losing ships, but remain dauntless and chilled, you'll eventually attract the attention of pvp/low-sec/null-sec corps who'll invite you to join.
---
It's all about those triglavian ships now. Their dps ramps up the longer they stick to 1 target and they have logi bonusses. So each of your DPS players can also be a logibro.
---
Alternatively you see a lot of web loki with artilleries fitted, with interceptors and bombers.
---
Disney marketing
---
Only with your bare hands.
---
usually im pretty good at keeping up to date. and tbh, i love all the changes eve brings. ifpeople are complaining, generally it wasa good change :D
---
So you don't know what you meant either. Well, have a nice night I guess.
---
Stuff like burners were meant to fix that, but mission runners just ignore them if they aren't already good at that kind of stuff.
---
Diamond rats are the next step, which hopefully may be improved to make more serious missions.
---
Imagine cloaky hunting missions where you have to actually scan down the rat, who periodically uses d-scan to find combat probes and leaves, and he's running a site, and you have to hunt and catch him to get the loot.
---
Or other missions that involve running gate camps or dealing with a small fleet.
---
Burner ended up a fitting puzzle, I personally just have a blingy AF per mission. Making PvE more like PvP will never be achieved without a huge amount of unpredictability...
---
Yes players can set up contracts to get their stuff moved by other players. There are a lot of things that can go wrong though. People try to scam haulers or gank them on their way, to cash in the collateral. It's not exactly newbie friendly, until you learn about the pitfalls.
---
They are trying to compete with PIRAT for control over the Jita trade hub. The Fortizar in Perimeter is their War HQ and they are mainly camping the 4-4 undock (very poorly) and baiting with multi-boxed Leshak/Praxis fleets.
---
Yeah. If they were doing it competently, I wouldn't ask the question. But given the circumstances, what the fuck were they thinking?
---
It's NetEase, so the answer is inevitably "horribly".
---
I've heard Chinese gamers compare it unfavorably to EA. Frickin' *EA* isn't as moustache-twirlingly evil as NetEase.
---
this is how it looked in alpha october last year

Look into the intems in the Apostle's cargohold.
---
I would say restrict playtimes first without doing any other changes (like drop corp etc)  
---
See if you can play for 2h on wednesday and maybe 3-4 on sunday evening or something (or some unimportant, no gym, no date night whatever, days )   
---
Record what you do during those times - if it's fulfilling, stick with it - if you want more, seek a playstyle that's more fitting - maybe doing hisec pve (missions, abyss) is a better thing to do - maybe doing fw/lowsec gatecamping is more fulfilling as you get action right on login or even join a nullbloc idk - as you have a high chance to catch a ping.   
---
Or go for exploration, industry, mining, etc. = there's a lot of things just see what you like :)
---
Actually, with no remote repping of suspects anymore, as long as you wait out your limited engagement in station after the fight is over (be it by you winning or the target of your ire escaping), it's not such a bad idea. Just be aware of old ship switcheroo...
---
'Surely not ALL the members of the TTT agreement will stomp a hole in us at the same time.'
---
Nullsechnaya Sholupen is an english speaking alliance living in NPC Null
---
Most of them are Chinese, they fly shit fit Battleships, often with up to 5 plates and no resists
---
They also use Target Spectrum Breakers on nearly all of their ships which makes them almost unkillable
---
When I'm in the club and the DJ plays my jam.
---
Talk to Good Sax in Stain.
---
It's not very hard, it's just generally far from casual. Even what you described while may be seemingly ideal, requires holes rolling, stock planning, using rush delivery services or manual delivery, and that's just what I have noticed from your own text. Since you have hisec static and you are small group, there are some days when your hisec static and your system is occupied by bigger PVP group. Sure you could fight, but you cannot do pretty much anything other these days. And let's not forget that situation is different in different wormhole collectives.
---
It is doable and it is enjoyable, but it is not casual.
---
It can still be closer without adding in that unpredictability.
---
Right now it's TOTALLY not representative whatsoever.
---
Blades of Grass is english speaking and there are several other alliances near us + corporations within Fraternity that are english speaking.
---
We'll just have to see.
---
It is really about how they handle the economy, and what state the rest of the world is in. Like are there wormholes? is there FW? Incursions? etc. Or is it a more limited set of just highsec missions?
---
you can say it's toxic posting :D

Ihub was lost because Legacy has batphoned everyone they could and they formed shitton of people, much more than WC had.

When did PIRAT get control over Jita trade hub? I always thought it's controlled by Caldari Navy

Brave is predominantly English speaking. Legacu Coalition in general, but we do have Spanish, Russian, Chinese and French corps in the alliance.

Brave is recruiting btw

IIRC gurristas has something similar with an em missile tower

Most of the nuisance things are handled by skrim FCs, during skrim fleets. No pressure to join fleet, if you want to do other things during that time. No need for Strat op in most cases. Partisan offensive actions, like karb harassment, gate camping and such are often handled by SIGs or corp fleets. That way we can maximize the fun gained by making panda steaks, while minimizing fatigue.
---
War is progressing slow and steady. No need to burn out FCs and linemember with weeks of China timezone cyno jammer bashes. Wall is going down, system after system. 
---
FRT pings for CTAs so often it's not healthy. Too much pings reduce numbers, not improve them.
---
i dunno, if OTHER people have stopped running arty canes with orthrus's cynabals and 100mn drakes theyre missing out.
---
Sorry, I'm not trying to inflate what I do or my effort, I've had to what /u/Sadic_Anark suggested (limiting when and how long I play) because of RL, so the time I'm online is defined and it is a game that I don't get upset about outside playtime.
---
Hole roll panic does happen, we got a hole to Thera a while ago, people just started streaming in, we lost several Megathrons and a lot of PI alts woke up in clones but we popped that ASAP. Then one opened to Perimeter, we dropped bubbles, got the poppers out, and gave everyone about 20min to go shopping or export before we rolled it.
---
Then you get some really cool holes like right to New Eden, or a system with a sleeper catch or a quiet pocket filled with relic sites, and it really feels like Bob occasionally smiles on us.
---
We are going to global local, I was in 1dq local while I was sitting in PH staging yesterday.
---
I'll undock something bigger under only a few circumstances.
---
1. It's a ship that pays for itself, such as my alt flying an Orca or Exhumer.
---
2. It's a doctrine ship, I'm flying with some friends who have similar ships, I'm getting SRP if it dies.
---
&gt;Your not going to spend billions blinging a Interceptor for fleet tackle.
---
I'm sure someone has.
---
Thanks to all those who replied.
---
So the issue was I had set the desktop at 60jz in Windows settings. And so that was blocking it out.
---
Who would've thought. A giant blob with 50k characters has more endurance than a smaller coalition that has to rely on the same members to show up for fleets all the time. Very surprising outcome. 
---
Well done Legacy.
---
 Ihub was lost because WC has batphoned everyone they could and they formed shit, much less people than Legacy had.
---
Yet to see a single fight that peaks above 2000, not 70k but ok
---
I moved to an SSD and the performance went to crap in the way you are describing - even with a full install.
---
Turned out lots of SSDs out there at the moment have bad firmware from the factory. Updated the firmware and now eve runs great.
---
How can PIRAT stop you from doing that to your wartargets ?
---
I would be reborn as GigX's uncle's brother's grandcousin
---
What you COULD have done against botters and too-much-easy-ISK: lower bounties; make anomalies non-standard, so that noone can afk-rat without risk; let rats attack drones more agressively, so that players have to interact.
---
What you DID: nerv ships, nerv ships even more, nerv ships... after this didn't work good enough you shut down local. Now ratting and/or mining is like russian roulette with 5 bullets, even with dscanning every some seconds you get f\*\*ked by cloakies. Like the carebear-way or not, but it has been a way from the beginning of eve. Shutting it down is a sledgehammer approach to exclude too many players.
---
Masses of minerals: eve has a good market, if there is too much of something prices will drop...
---
This is inaccurate given how Horde is propably the biggest player in this
---
The Jedi guys decced the exact same people that PIRAT is at war with so by them sitting on the undock they are stopping people from undocking which means PIRAT can no longer catch them on gates.
---
It doesn't  matter to them if one corp is fighting another in Jita, it's the fact that all their content is being scared off by the Jedi's that bothers them
---
That's angels i believe
---
Fucking dead
---
And it took a lot of time and work that definitely wasn't casual to get myself in with the people I'm with, and to develop things to where they are, I think with this whole thread I'm mixing up "casual" and "routine".
---
What I do, and the order I do it in when I login is routine, planning the end of month PI and manufacture export is routine, undocking and scanning everything that's not already been scanned two jumps down the chain is routine.
---
Sorry, I really think I got to arguing a point that's not rally going to help the OP.
---
Except it looks like all stuff is stolen from old Eve trailers :D
---
A gigantic Smart-bomb.
---
Or SWTOR where EA gives some credits monthly for having 2FA enabled (haven't played it in years but those credits still accumulating even now).  
---
Or there is Warframe way, where devs 2FA locked all player trades (and this is a crucial part of f2p economy). And guess what? No one complained and I only met one person so far (new player) who failed trade because he hasn't 2FA and he enabled it 5 minutes after I told him about it.  
---
If CCP entered "bold decisions" phase, maybe it's really time to enforce 2FA now.

Suicide ganking is also needed tho. It keeps the mineral prices high because you can't just afk mine in highsec in total safety. There always need to be at least somekind of danger involved in making isk.

They might be English speakers, but unfortunately they are not English readers
---
Only my isk halving service guarantees isk returning to your wallet.
---
Thats precicly what I was thinking. The BPCs become more like stacking ore, just a comodity that you have to put in.
---
Instead of using an BPC to construct you are more selecting what to produce where the BPC is just one component...
---
How easy is it for someone wanting to start doing this to get into a group? It looks like I can make a alt and jump right into it. I'd like to go the hyperion route to move into a vindi.
---
It's never going to happen. Why would something that didn't do any damage appear on a killmail.
---
Have just been a regular old f1 monkey in Brave, and for a very short time, Karmafleet. Both corps are great and thrive for different reasons.
---
Brave as a whole is pretty welcoming. New players are given classes, encouraged to fight it out and do crazy stuff regardless of how it would look on the killboards. Coms are active and there's always someone on. A lot of the management chit chat during downtime, including Dunk and Shattered both of who are very busy. 
---
Karmafleet has a huge legacy to draw on, being part of the Imperium. It's more militarized in that there is a required participation component to membership. Some see it as a negative but for me personally, the 3 month quota was easily met in a few weekends. The highlight for me were the Saturday Night Swarms. Getting drunk with 100 nerds, roaming around with the CEO (Merklechen) espouses the virtues of women shuffling, all while listening to a great twitch DJ solely hired for the group was fun as fuck. 
---
Essentially, building a community helps corps thrive, no matter how shit the times can get.

A Web is better specially if you go with 99% webs

 In all seriousness though..... This is probably more focused on the Chinese Mobile market than anything else.
---
Western gamers dont really grasp how big mobile gaming is in China and how much money it's worth - this game isn't aimed at you.
---
&gt;  I feel they misjudge the core of their userbase 
---
tbh, I think this isn't being made for us. It's being made for mobile gamers, with CCP tapping another market. Much like most of their other attempts. Expansion, rather than doubling down to suck yet more money from the people already paying them.
---
&gt; Im a keyboard and Mouse FPS kinda guy 
---
Dust actually supported these. kinda limited, but they worked.
---
&gt; I understand the fact that NetEase dev is separate of CCP, but let me complain about ccp dev, making it look like I actually don't.
---
ftfy
---
Praise Blob
---
I figure it's mostly an IP licensing deal. Not much in the way of CCP resources spent on it, and those which are are business administration resources, not development ones.
---
You have to sacrifice some PI like livestock or foodstuffs at your sun a few times a month. I can't PROVE it helps, but I'm too afraid to stop at this point.
---
Their message has always made sense. If people are completely safe they start flying weird shit that's at best minmaxed to crab. In that way ganking keeps people flying reasonable ships lowering their afk economic output and making everyone else's time doing the same activity worth more ISK.
---
I spent enough time in Jita to know how PIRAT operate and have been war decced enough to know that seeing war targets on the undock is enough for me to not leave 4-4 without using a neutral alt to move my stuff. Rest of it's just easy to piece together with killboards and such
---
9mins intro. After that, the first 4 fights are either shooting afk's or warping out before killing anything/getting killed. 
---
It's not for me, but the editing is done very nicely, and good music choice.
---
Want to make a solo excursion into nullsec. Eventually for ratting with a cruiser but initially i would be happy with cheap covops, hack few sites and make it back to Dodixie in one piece. Advice? Also, can i somehow change my clone to something that wont cause me to loose billions in implants? :)
---
&gt;  with the long falloff 
---
20 to 50% loss of an already class low DPS in ships that tend to be the worst EHP in class.
---
Pulse hit to almost the same range, hit with more deeps, and don't lose half their DPS to falloff.
---
Shameless self-promotion, but my corp Katothen spends a lot of time in NPC nullsec (our forever home is in Curse) and we're English speaking.
---
God*damn* I hope they aren't. Keep that shit in quarantine.
---
Why dont you fight outnumbered 2:1, cowards
---
friend i do not know what to say, if your home space is being invaded, you cannot afford to slow roll it by just giving up ihubs or infrastructure without even forming, or saying "hey guys just keep mining while we try and save this ihub no big". Not everyone has three or four regions worth of buffer to protect the krablands.
---
there's been a few occasions where FRT have even fought heavily outnumbered (like the Mega fleet for example...). If Eso was being hit every single day for months on end, you better believe every fleet would be max dudes because that's the nature of losing your home space.
---
+1, fantastic group to fly with I've had a blast.
---
I seem to recall certain alliance leaders committing to making test homeless, evicting test from esoteria, etc. Some trash talk may be deserved at this point.
---
i exclusively use public courier contracts. with 1-2b collateral and moving stuff from jita to amamake/tama, you can net 30-90m in reward, depending on volume moved.
---
imo hauling sucks ass, but i am glad that there are people willing to move my shit for pennies so i can keep pewpewing
---
really only happens when the post goes against the "tapi are the scrappy underdogs fighting all of eve for their very existence" narrative
---
&gt; y could use some buff to tracking or a role bonus, 
---
2gyro stabber with a TE hitting for 213DPS at 1/2 falloff + optimal (18km). vs 2 sink pulse omen with a TE which hits to just under 25KM for full damage of 281DPS.
---
Oh, the stabber has 10% better total range but at heated point range it has even shittier DPS because you're outside half optimal and doing closer to 100DPS instead of 267 (which would still be garbage) and at that range the Omen is still doing 224DPS.
---
No drones above as they have identical damage numbers. Both ships using T2 long range and smaller guns.
---
I would tend towards saying the problem is barrage damage being in need of a decent increase than removing the TE nerf. Shorter range ammo like RFEMP is fairly competitive with Imp MF 
---
Or maybe we just need to nerf pulse.
---
&gt;That way we can maximize the fun gained by making panda steaks, while minimizing fatigue.
---
you realize this grand, lofty strategic plan only works because you have so many more people than they do, right?
---
:thonking:
---
Maybe a gong sound
---
"Big players getting commisared by hotpocket addicts for having fun"
---
look okay fine, I know just adding up pilots in coalitions can be misleading. 
---
but being in test and calling out others for not fighting you when it's been overarching TEST military strategy for 2~ years? (probably longer, I only have perspective from when fc'd there and fighting against them) to not take a fight outnumbered. There are exceptions to every rule, no doubt, but the overwhelming majority of TEST ops I've been on or been on the other side of generally followed this philosophy. So you can't go around complaining "hey please fight us" with that in mind...
---
This is really a win win for both us and CCP! CCP licenses their IP to NetEase who captures the Chinese market, which is huge! But as a second order effect, The Army of Mango, Ranger Regiment, PLA Associates, and Fraternity see a downward slope as botters move on to EVE Echoes!!
---

---
&gt;It would seem an error occurred when the account was created, and your location country was not properly read, which is why the offers are not available to you. This sometimes happen if the registration process is done through a proxy or VPN.
---
This is exactly what happed.. serves me right for creating an alt account from behind my office VPN.
---
Thanks for all the replies
---
Sweet jesus jack, that man had a family
---
fuck fake internet points anyway, luv. &lt;3
---
truth is truth.
---
Also Winnie Blues and VB Crew have a few guys in the  AUTZ/EUTZ crossover that live in Curse, tell em Waan sent you
---
but this is a similar argument as to missiles and their compete-ability.
---
missiles have good range, but they apply badly so are balanced by having reduced ACTUAL dps. if they get close enough to web scram the lot they compete a little better in the short range side of things but not quite to the level of a designated short range weapon system. this is called balance and is actually quite well done.
---
anyone who is going to use the stabber as an example to fight a cruiser(omen) has a weak argument IMO.
---
now, lets run these numbers again and see what kind of stats you get between an Omen and a Rupture.
---
youll find the omen is hitting into the ruptures highest resistances. and is also under neut pressure from the rupture that has spare capacitor, and can hit em OR explo whatever it needs.
---
ive always found lasors hit very badly in falloff of each crystal type. maybe its in my head but try it out they hit much worse than suppose to i think compared to other guns. either way, youll find the DPS stats of ACTUAL applied damage to be quite similar on similar fits. ie: armour tank, single Damage mod, short range guns with different ammo's used.
---
People actually fit A/C's to ships that dont have a another gun systems hull bonus because theyre such good damage for fitting, and they do really well in alot of cases!
---
further to my point its a couple of hulls are weak that have bonuses for Medium AC's not that medium AC's are weak. fix the hulls, not the guns.
---
Depends on what kind of NPC null life you want.
---
If you want to live out of a station (missions etc) then Stain, Curse, and Syndicate are probably your best places to go looking. There's a few entities in each and they're fairly active. These groups tend to have less invested outside of stations and are more likely to campaign against sov groups every so often as it's near impossible to evict people out of npc null stations.
---
If you want more of a pocket-citadel life (basically sov null without the infinite anomalies, it does have its charms since it isn't full of afk/bots) then Great Wildlands or Venal might have something for you. Sadly Outer Ring is more or less under lockdown by Initiative so there isn't much there anymore, but the other two have decent groups hidden away. This kind of life is more subject to eviction though, but if a bloc isn't coming for you then the territorial wars between small npc null entities (usually over athanors) are pretty cool. Great Wildlands used to have a ton of these.
---
I live in an NPC null group, and technically we're recruiting, depending on what kind of lifestyle you're looking for. Feel free to PM me.
---
Yup, they aren't fighting winterco, they are farming them. When they have the numerical advantage they fight them, blueballs when they don't. Add on top that they have a larger pool of irl pilots to draw from and it means their line members are less prone to burn out too. The whole "we're here for the goodfites" narrative is cobblers. They are here to blob, sit on their face and farm easy frags, just like PL with Hero coalition. It was done to them, now they want to try doing it to someone else. It's eve, it's what is expected, why they need the false narrative idk.
---
No, you don't get selectable damage at those ranges. Your choice is barrage.
---
And 213 vs 281 is 25% less damage, also significant. But that's at 18km. when you get deeper into falloff where you exceed the omen's opt, you're doing closer to 130.
---
why anomaly ratting requires sovereignty? what should i do? :)
---
I would like to see a war between Jedi and Pirat
---
This.  Friday night is game night for you, Saturday night is for friends/family, etc.
---
well, yeh, 720 cane, personal skirmish links, and your golden, theyre HELLA fun still today
---
Whatever it is, it made me cringe pretty hard.
---
People do silly things. Usually you see that on solo vindis which is already silly in itself. (Don’t get me wrong this is a game and maybe people should be silly a bit more often.)
---
You could argue for a web + grappler combo but I wouldn’t be for it. Let me explain why you might want to do it though. For that let’s first look at a megathron which is the T1 version of the vindi and doesn’t have the web bonus:
---
https://i.imgur.com/9Cq62H4.png
---
(Fit: neutron blasters, 2 MFSs; web/grappler are T2.)
---
As you can see on the picture the web + grappler version applies better pretty much everywhere. At close range his stronger webbing plays out but also at over 10km the grappler shines as it still slows down there. This probably leads people to reason to fit a grappler on a vindi as the grappler still webs outside of the webifier range. So have a look at the same graph for the vindi:
---
https://i.imgur.com/shvfTm2.png
---
(Fit: Neutron blasters, 2MFS; web is dark blood and grappler is T2)
---
As you can see the cold web + grappler does indeed a bit more damage at 15-20km. But it’s not a big difference and if you overheat as you can see. I used two dark blood webs here though. If you fit shadow serpentis or federation navy webs you get stronger but shorter webs. This will increase your DPS at short ranges. One Dark Blood + one Shadow Serpentis web should give the best results on paper. See https://i.imgur.com/48k3Tfx.png
---
Anyways all that doesn’t really matter anyways. If you undock in a solo vindi I expect that some people will hold you with a long point on an assault frigate or so. Then they’ll blob you with so much you die anyways. But maybe you’re lucky before that and can score some random kills.
---
In a fleet context you’d never put a grappler on a vindi btw. You’d bring a bhaalgorn for longer webs. Bhaal T2 webs reach 20km cold. The grappler doesn’t matter at that range anyways.
---
It seems Weyland-Yutani excels at losing their assets in both Anoikis and highsec :)
---
Have pilots in WH, null, high, low, and watch 'em for hours as if you were playing.  You'll see these issues come up.  Not having them on twitter and saying there's no issues on their end while the rest of EVE is experiencing them shows whoever is maintaining this twitter account is out of touch.
---
It probably will. Most people I know in small null-sec sov groups were sort of waiting out the 2-3 week initial estimated window to see if this would be reverted. Now that we are well past that time frame, and it sounds like CCP believe this was a good change and want to keep it, people are finally giving up that wait and are starting to move on.
---
A lot more people have left in the last week or two than in the original two week period after the blackout. The biggest factor seems to be how extremely OP blops are now. Roamers can be dealt with, but the power of blops has no good counter that I've seen so far. (And yes, we've tried whatever obvious counter you are about to post.)
---
Add to that the fact that sov has become worthless to small groups, and you don't even have ADM grinders around anymore. Owning sov is just a headache that yields little to no benefit.
---
Uh, how old is that? I haven't seen a lot of those names since 2011-2013...
---
How exactly?
---
Who knows what the argument is used for blackout, aside from the perpetual chat bug and labeling it a feature. There's a programming failure not recognized and a content delivery attempt that's basically failed all metrics of null activity on big fleet fights and capitals (all down in activity), with the exception of excavators. In short: still broke, they're not fixing it.
---
How does this relate to your cyno argument of people building up time and isk (and sub money) to get to those capital kills so we could address your inability to gather friends and have your own caps?
---
It’s a stop loss thinking 
---
I got enough cash to fly what I want but I still consider the options once the price tag gets close to a B.  Why well it takes awhile to get that isk back.  
---
When i was  running missions i did it in my T2 fitted Rattle snake. Blinging it only invited ppl to try and gank me.  
---
I have always only used Hours / ship is paid for as metric and that POV never allows blinging.  ;)
---
There are two Cloven Red Asteroids if I remember correctly. If you look between them there is a very very small asteroid with Mercium in it which you'll have to mine.

There are enough good corporations and alliances out there that are more suitable for a casual play style.  My advise would be to find a corp that allows for that and feels goods/comfortable, and focuses on activities you enjoy.
---
Pay2win refers to buying an advantage. If I'm playing a FPS and I buy a gun that does ridiculous damage, I still need to be able to aim the gun. It's still p2w.

---
i am grateful he quit the game after alienating all his allies, alliance and most people who play this game. godbless.
---
Are you autopiloting? Cos if you're autopiloting you can immediately reduce your risk by manually flying and warping to 0. In high sec you *should* be pretty safe that way.
---
They need to replace this is fine with a Max octuple mega GRANDE CTA.
---
Just make sure you create a customer support ticket rather than a bug report. Sending the request in the proper channel saves time as well. ;)
---
No offense, but down south you'll always be "PL". When I remember back to the PL invasion into Provi, I only really remember you guys and that entosis corp. The others, not so much.
---
So maybe it's more accurate to say that down here: "PL" is you guys :P

I was in system when this happened, and I couldn't be happier - if a touch jealous. Jerma is one of my old stomping grounds. And by "stomping ground" I mean a place where I stomped on people. I spent a lot of time miner bumping, suicide ganking, canflipping, and solo WarDeccing people around Jerma. Jerma has a special place in my heart with a lot of memories associated with it.

---
i did a lot of stuff, super ratting and rorqual mining mostly, i've started dabbling in reactions as well to make some  passive isk, never tried boson ratting myself, probably will soon
---
&gt; Yes players can set up contracts to get their stuff moved by other players. There are a lot of things that can go wrong though. People try to scam haulers or gank them on their way, to cash in the collateral. It's not exactly newbie friendly, until you learn about the pitfalls.
---
Ehhh, I would say much more of the risk is on the person contracting. Blind newbie hauling is pretty fault free unless you ignore the explicit warning signs for "This contract routes through null!"
---
Sure, there's bait contracts but those are 1) Relatively unpopular as a scam 2) Difficult targets at the best of times for the scammer 3) Purposefully priced high in collateral cause that's the profit so... not like he's gonna be able to afford it in the first place.

No no no no....u can buy dreds in stain from local market...also stay away from ma reliks:)))

If you right click on the Cloven Red Asteroid, you should see the option "Remove Large Collidable Object from Overview". Cloven Red Asteroid is in fact not an asteroid, it's an object in space that just serves as decoration. The real asteroid you need to mine is somewhere in that pocket, near the Cloven Red Asteroid.

Obviously yes, and that data was published like 3 months ago (like it literally says in the picture btw)

there is a channel called 'Haulers Channel' in game. you enter that chat room, dont spam it in there, just ask if anyone can give you a couple of pointers. somone in there will PM you and sort you out,
---
once you can fly the T2 hauler, youll make plenty of monies. but before then, its a very very dangerous game
---
The trouble is ships in EVE typically don't work as golden bullets. Even if you officer fit a Garmur which is the most extreme pay to win scenario I can imagine as far as paying to get easy kills (50km point just orbit your target at 40km and win every frigate fight nearly automatically) as a noob you will 100% end up whelping it eventually because of being bad at kiting and keeping ranges.
---
EVE also has diminishing returns so paying for the minimal rorq fit in injectors is probably only 60% or less of the cost and 80% of the yield of paying for max yield so the more you like on top the more you have to pay in a non linear progression. That's another safe guard against pay to win.
---
Tldr: you can always pay to skip grinding or waiting but you can't pay for player skill and you will whelp your bling shit no matter how much you paid for it.
---
Cmon, guys. Did you guys have no phones?
---
See, I knew you could do it! Was that so hard?
---
I know right, like imagine fighting a war where you form just the right number of people so that way the fight is close and you lose a bunch of shit.
---
Honestly you could quit your corp. It's not gonna help you do HS exploration.

As you move on in the game, you'll have an alt to haul the things you need around

&gt; but being in test and calling out others for not fighting you when it's been overarching TEST military strategy for 2~ years? (probably longer, I only have perspective from when fc'd there and fighting against them) to not take a fight outnumbered

Something being difficult to get (and titans in modern Eve are not difficult to get) does not make it balanced, especially when it's far more practical to use defensively in a blob than for any other playstyle. Neither does the time investment, and neither does the SP requirement.

I have titans, I have supers, I have alts, and none of these thing make them engaging to play against.

Im over here trying to find people to drop blops on and these cunts are getting idiots to straight up join their fleet. Im so damn bad at this game its pathetic.
---
Do you have instant replay on? Try turning that off it sounds like a cpu or hard drive issue
---
trust me, there is billions of isk you can make with a DST. i often get my contracts done,
---
they generally are, hisec to hisec (no dangerous lowsec to go through and get tackled by enemies)
---
up to 60k m3. the collateral will be 2billion or less, (often much less) and i will pay about 3 to 3.5million isk per jump you have to make on the trip.
---
once you learn the cloaky MWD trick. which takes a day of practice at best. you can do these contracts non stop and pretty much 100% safe aside from disconnects or warping to the station your delivering to and you dont have a warp-to-zero bookmark.
---
but you will need omega for the t hauler i think and the cloak. and youll want to fit as much passive tank as possable in this ship for hisec runs.

Seddow is his sister?

goons fed a lot of battleships in a fight under panfam titans when they were attacking tribute. iirc mittens told the fcs "fuck it, people want some blood" or wta
---
The supposition that marginally inferior or even equal numbers = you will welp is incredible blobthink. Not being able to deal with situations where this is the reality is the direct outcome of ALWAYS being able to depend on better numbers else, you stand down. TEST (and tbf most blobs) have completely lost the ability to work out how to fight outnumbered. 
---
It's actually EUTZ supremacy because USTZ is trash in every single alliance in this game and will never be good. Fact.
---
Worth it, he got the kill!
---
just me alone each week gets about 10 x 60km3 contracts valued at 3.5mil per jump hisec to hisec.

a DST guy can earn about half a bill in an hour moving these. its good money considering its in hisec, and with cloaky MWD trick your pretty uncatchable

I was making an attempt at comparing the ships with bonuses designed for the short range weapons on the lighter end of the tier. Stabber doesn't have PG for arty and has a ROF / FO bonus while the Omen has the ROF and amarr typical cap bonus. The ruppy has the PG and a damage bonus implying Arty and it's a heavier cruiser so let's compare it to a maller.
---
Ruppy 425s TE and 2Gy 309 DPS max (at 14km it's doing much less)
---
Ruppy 220s (because the maller fit with heavies requires fitting mods) 278DPS max
---
Maller Focusd pulse TE and 2sinks 263 DPS but at almost 20KM.
---
Ruppy 220 at 20KM ~ 155DPS
---
Ruppy 425 at 20KM ~ 139DPS
---
and the maller has 20% more EHP
---
If I armor tank the rupture, it's losing even more DPS or range for dropping a weapon upgrade. The 220 is doing 278 but only out to abt 11km at this point (half the range of the pulse full DPS) with less tank (admittedly it does probably evens out because of resists at this point).
---
The complaint I hear most often about minmatar ships is their range with falloff. that range only looks good on paper. At the max range, the cruiser guns apply with frigate DPS and because that's out of point anyway, the opponent can just kthxbye out of there. within point range, the pulse has a significant damage advantage and (in the case of the stabber) a good damage profile for resist holes. The amarr ship is usually going to have an EHP edge as well. Yes, the stabber can also disengage almost at will but if both ships are in a win or die mode, the stabber comes up short.
---
You mention fixing hulls. I don't disagree with you there. The hulls can be buffed but the hull people complain about being OP is pretty much always the same: Cynabal. If the cynabal is cancer in spite of the lackluster weapon system, it can be addressed as an individual hull.
---
**I'm saying basically that the problem isn't even range but how the LR ammo applies. Buffing Barrage damage (and maybe nerfing cynas) are really all that has to happen.**
---
&gt; missiles have good range, but they apply badly so are balanced by having reduced ACTUAL dps
---
And they hit 100% of the time. Pyfa has my graph tool greyed out, so I can't see just how well and I'm heading to work in a minute, so no time for formulas. In any case, rapid lights are going to apply very well out to 43km with scorge fury (409 base dps but probably not for long enough to matter in the end)  and a ham caracal is doing 360 out to 25km but that's paper amd I can't graph it against the other hull speeds.
---
Anyway, out of time. Thanks for remaining civil.
---
What are red boxes and yellow boxes on enemies mean?

I think red boxes means I got aggro, but yellow?

The mind of a Tapi member is an odd one

Pretty much most of Syndicate speaks English. Some of Outer Ring. I would say Syndicate though is your best bet. Just check Zkillboard for who’s making noise in US TZ and who’s corp name sounds like English speakers.

Can't you still lock someone out once they accept the contract? Or did they somehow change that?

This is getting out of hand

Same here, but i noticed that it is not Eve related (at least in my case). When stuttering happens (pretty much random), lot of Windows 10 core processes are going in suspend mode. No cpu/hdd peak activities...
---
\*[screams](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/tJwj0RDHsKmLm/giphy.gif)\*
---
Well, "complain" might be valid, but given the Diablo 3 and Immortal issue played out, then it seems like a fair concern. Diversion of attention on a leadership level.
---
I hope your fix of my comment pans out, and it can be written off as baseless moaning. :)
---
&gt; You chose to pick this fight you can’t win 6 months after doing the same thing 6 months prior
---
  Not winning fast enough?
---
  But when Legacy *do* win fast enough it's "GRRRR 70,000 BLUE BLOBS"
---
Yeah it doesn't just 'pop'. You'll get the verbal 'asteroid depleted' and then it starts to vaporize.
---
Now now, there's no need to be a rude little child just because someone made an honest mistake. Are you saying you never make mistakes? You're perfect? I doubt it. Check the log in your own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's. Have a nice day. :)
---
Yeah I had similar issues, was getting stuttering and high frame times. Honestly it resolved itself with the installation of the new 1903 build of Windows 10 that got pushed down from windows update recently. 
---
I will say to make sure all the Windows Game Mode stuff is turned off, as that was known to cause issues with stuttering in games.
---
You might think of Eve like a car simulation game. If you add a huge engine and just upgrade everything, suddenly you don't know how to drive it. You're spinning out everywhere, can't hold it on the road, you're overcorrecting, etc.
---
Also, imagine the other drivers on most areas could blow you up and take some of your car parts for themselves. So your driving skill directly correlates to who's going to come try and blow you up.
---
And then in addition to all that, there are mechanics that make it harder for big ships to hit small ship, so it's not bigger = better all the time.
---
Anyone got nice footage from today "Event" ?  
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78275237/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78275237/)
---
It's a blackops battleship, usually for hotdropping (covops-cyno) in PvP.
---
Several people are using it for doing sites or missions. It's a really strong ship when fitted correctly, but also extremely expensive. Not saying you can kill it easy, but using the money for that specific ship, you can take it and have more fun with dozens of smaller ships that combined are not as expensive as this one. :)
---
All BPC pls.      
---
Like it don't have to be so hard as people expect.      
---
I have some old BPC laying around.      
---
Current max run for those items is like 100 ^(don't remember the exact number) but those are realy old things and they have like 3-4k runs.            
---
So from the perspective of the how it is stored in database "runs" we are not having each type of bpc with separate ME/TE as separate item type.      
---
^(this is obvious approach - just making the point)             
---
What it mean is that we have database storing as separate values :            
---
BPC type, ME, TE, number of runs              
---
So now imagine yourself having ability to combine/split all BPC just per 1 run.         
---
Instead of can with 1000x 20 run ME 10 / TE 20 BPC for some destroyer - you could have 1 BPC with 20.000 runs that you can add or pull the specific BPC runs as you need.                 
---
There can be added sane limits for this kind of BPC, but just from database perspective you just reduced from 1000 rows to a single record.
---
It changed a week or two ago to 1 mil.
---
It's just the last 7 days.
---
Liquidate everything except, your memories (special ships that have meaning for you, if you have them), and or move the rest to jita.
---
Then whenever you like you can go on bobmbers bar, or spectre fleet etc or other npsi communities.
---
Other option is to join horde, they do a bit of everything. Dont move too much stuff there, just buy whatever you need when you need it.

Even if you get kicked out for inactivity, you can get back in quickly after you leave.

It is already. It has worked without it being on that setting before though also. Running a 4790k with a 1080GTX so there's really never been an issue with Eve before.
---
Aye. Windows 10 do has its quirks sometimes. It is wierd that it only affects Eve and no other game/application.
---
skill injectors were a mistake, retards shouldnt fly supers
---
It is all off. Will check to see if there's an update laying around, Win 10 can be acting up at times when there are. Thanks!
---
Different sized entities have to use different strategies to maximize their impact. Shocking news.
---
In the grand scheme of things, you are right with your analysis. Greater number of members mean there is less pressure on each individual pilot. 
---
Thing is, at the beginning of war, Winter Co plus allies had much better numbers. In many cases they were the ones overforming. But then SkillU imploded, and suddenly, each big timer had one eagle fleet less on FRTs side. Legacy managed to anchor an Astra in their ENG staging, which led to so many great content for us, and for many nuisance for them. Then there was that titan jumping with no cyno, big cap fight, and getting a hold in BOZ. Then the Blackout and VNI changes made FRTs ISK stream much slimmer. 
---
What I'm trying to say, is that numbers that seems big on paper, doesn't matter much if you don't have momentum to utilize them. With momentum actual numbers in fleet are much worse than what they could have been.

Fort timer 1: no fight

Fort timer 2: brief skirmish on the gate, Seddow had that chat spam thing (sucks), TIDI hell, not fun, test coalition with 350+ subcap advantage. jammers are in a disgusting spot right now fort got killed with fighters.
---
ihub madness: this was two weeks ago, impossible to get a proper br because it was a multi system fight, usual numbers differential, two ihubs killed out of 18 which are now held by test iirc, 8+ hours of fleets.
---
ihub timer last friday: FRT killed the nodes and ihub, test sat in actual system with way more dudes, rehubbed immediately, "please gate into our much bigger blob and fight us ty" meanwhile test coalition had more bodies to throw at reffing about a thousand other systems.
---
ihub timers on sunday: frt sat on a test fort to stop cynos being lit, nothing happened, test sat on the other side of a gate with bigger fleets, stalemate, node rng, some minor skirmishs the end.

Something awful is happening.  You need to go back to 2016 and get Hilmar and Falcon to kiss at the Eve Vegas dance.
---
i mean, missiles dont reach 100% of the time to thier stated range, and they almost NEVER aply full paper dps no matter how you fit your ship due to things like HAMs and HM's explosion radius and speed being above cruiser spec., but lets not wander too far from your original point,
---
forget the stabber, the stabber is a well known weak t1 cruiser, it is weak because it is fast, and it is so because it seems to be designed to be able to destroy frigs and gtfo.
---
imo i think your correct to compare the maller and the rupture, i stuck with the omen as that was your original example.
---
i quickly threw a couple of fits together into pyfa, i tried to make ditto fits, i didnt include drones as its gun we are looking at here anyway.

---
 [https://gyazo.com/582b584a03fa1b22439680d471ff0c5d](https://gyazo.com/582b584a03fa1b22439680d471ff0c5d) (maller, 356DPS, worse tracking, longer range but! slower, with 1x medium neut it caps out from 100% cap in 72seconds LOL, it does however, have a huge tank somthing its known for. useless however as it puts out no damage once its neuted out)
---
as you can see in a brawling setup here, the rupture has the capacitor advantage (due to no cap for its overpowered cap free guns) its minmatar so tends to have a little less tank, but more speed and utility highslots for it to run neuts. it has MORE DPS, and MORE tracking, and MORE range control, more speed. and this is why im not sure why people think medium AC's are weak, in this case they are so insanely better on the ship, the maller will not track as good once the faster dual web rupture grabs it. and pretty soon its capped out being a brick in space.
---
i appreciate your busy now, but hopfully others will see this and realise Medium AC's are NOT underpowered. like everything they have thier thing theyre good at. but dont do too bad at other things. if everything was 100% fair it would all be same ranges, same dps, same same same and then eve would be hella boring.

Pretty sure this is the Wardec HQ for the chinese alliance named "Jedi something" that wardecced litterally everyone in hisec.
---
I dunno your history in the game but this whole "every fleet would be max dudes because that's the nature of losing your home sapce" is wrong.  
---
For the first couple of months, sure. Not for much later
---
you know what‘s good for you
---
Capitalist Army lives in Great Wildlands and Derelik.
---
Relatively unlikely. Since it goes through a couple lowsec systems, people will assume that you're going to gank them if they accept. There's a message "Goes through lowsec" in the courier so you won't really fool anyone if that's what you're trying to do.
---
Sure, my issue is that if you take two players of equal skill, and give one of them a credit card, the credit card one will win. That, to me, is pay to win.  
---
Two players of low skill, one has officer fit garmur, one doesn't, shiny garmur wins.  
---
Two players of high skill, one has officer garmur, one doesn't, shiny garmur wins.  
---
Also, remember that in EvE, "winning" is subjective because you have to create your own goals. If my small wormhole corp is in a war with another small wormhole corp, I could whip out the credit card and ensure my corp can continuously refit in shiny ships, and change doctrines at the drop of a hat by injecting into whatever is needed.
---
I don't really have a point here, PLEX has always existed whilst I have played EvE, I just have also thought that EvE has always been P2W. I guess if anything my point is that skill injectors need a rework. I've seen some good ideas like making skill injectors give 500k SP for noob skills and 50k for cap skills.

Here is a thought.... don't have so many BPCs? If you aren't producing from them or are actively selling them, they are useless dead weight. Make your ISK work for you, not the other way around.

&gt;Not everyone has three or four regions worth of buffer to protect the krablands.

I believe that right now FRT is the biggest sov holder in the game. And I think everyone that could have already evacuated their Rorqs into drones. Those that couldn't or weren't allowed, well it sucks to be them.
---
Current sov mechanics favour defender much more.
---
Cyno jammers are cancer to deal with. If it wasn't for them, this war would have fought in much different format.
---
Winter Co made few mistakes that allowed Legacy to gain momentum, that alone is the most crucial factor.
---
It's the momentum that allows us to take it easy, and not worry much about the rest. Naturally, everything is in motion, and Legacy might lose it soon, but right now it doesn't seem like it.

It is not to easily move them out, simply to manage stuff that is laying around and not cause the node to crash.
---

Hope this helps
---
I sell this stuff from time to time.     
---
Last time if paid for a nyx.
---
More like "especially if there were blue or purple".
---
Not the point here.        
---
More fact that let us do the 10.000 max runs per BPC and let turn 2 cans of BPC with Capital blasters I into a single BPC with 10.000 runs.

There are a lot of problems with CCP's back end. I'm fairly positive that they've lied about making the server side 64bit and I think it's mostly because 1) it would be wayy too much work and 2) they can't due to legacy code/in game items. 
---
Proof: try stacking more than 2,147,483,647 units of anything (veldespar easiest)
---
2,147,483,647 is the largest signed 32bit integer
---
They added a system where you can still deliver items to a locked citadel. I forget the guy's name, but there was one dude who made billions or trillions running courier scams and CCP nerfed it directly because of him.  He had a long post afterwards describing it and tallying the loot - it was impressive.
---
&gt; Do logistics issues lead to serious price inflation in nullsec relative to proximity to empire?
---
Still useful as long as they have beacons to jump to.
---
They could get gud?
---
It would still only use one thread.

In all of the MMO's I have played over the past two decades, I've never seen one have so many issues with such a basic, absolutely floor level feature, as a chat system.  Even the most broken games I've played over the years, games with completely broken launches, broken quests, broken stats, broken equipment, bugs and other issues always had working chat.
---
The ability to chat with a group of people has been a gaming and internet concept since the 90's.  It's such a basic and easy to implement feature that it's usually just a blip on a game's development cycle.  
---
"Hey Chad, you were assigned to the chat system on Monday, how are we coming along?"
---
"It's Friday boss, I had it up and running Wednesday and started working a new project already."
---
Unless you're adding some crazy new revolutionary shit,  that's going to blow the worlds collective minds, to text based communication that no one else in the world has ever thought up yet, then it *cannot* be that goddamned hard to fix or revert.
---
You came here arguing for a major change to the game.  You offered "proof" in the form of an online forum post.  I'm not arguing for anything, so I don't have to prove shit.  I could just as easily prove you're an idiot by pointing out the massive downvotes you've received here.  Just like your steam post, reddit posts aren't exactly proof.  I'd still be right, because you're a salty little clown who got hurt by big bad CODE. and wants his revenge.  Go back to the regular forums where all the other crybabies wail and gnash their teeth about ganking and bumping.  r/eve is for more advanced salt posts, propaganda, and complaining about Rorq proliferation.  Get on our level, or get out.
---
First answer the question: why are you making 10,000 bpcs of capital guns?
---
this game is about ranges, in pvp its all about trying to get into what your ship and weapon ranges benefit most from,
---
missiles, kiting out shoot frmo afar, and reduce enemys damage by doing so
---
hybrids, i mean blasters are all about getting really close, 
---
AC's, these are the same, its all about getting really close, BUT they get slight effectiveness at MUCH longer ranges than hybrids if its needed. so they can maybe ware down a blaster boat a bit before going in for the kill/fight
---
lasors. do not have the best tracking, but they, like missiles do well at longer ranges. both gun types offer a good short and long range choice. they deal shitty damage in falloff, track a little worse than hybrids and AC's. if they get caught, they die, if they dont, they will likely win, but if that AC ship catches him, 9times out of ten, the AC guy will have a neut and will neut him out too. just to add.
---
I'd rather argue that it snowed this winter as proof that global warming is a myth, wrap myself in a flag, clutch my blops/dread bomb, and go hunt Provi to extinction.  'Merica!

No idea on who they are.

Just know that they were wardeccing everything that breathed.

Basically, all of them
---
I have BPO and all most of my characters can copy.          
---
Instead of keeping stuff idle i am constantly running 30 days jobs on "most useful" BPO's.       
---
Quite simple reason.
---
I know ;)
---
Well if youre using autocannons you’re most likely in a minmatar ship. So who cares if you’re pointed? You outrun damn near anything in game. Get in closer and use best damage type against your target.
---
Why are auto cannons OP and was nerfed.
---
1.) selectable damage type
---
2.) damage multiplayer change (missiles dont get this)
---
3.) second best turret tracking weapon in game
---
4.) falloff long enough to fit kitting role
---
5.) capless guns
---
6.) high ROF (increases #2 chances)
---
7.) does split damage
---
8.) commonly found on minmatar hulls
---
So yeah, it was nerfed for a reason. Now I didn’t agree with the nerf for one as it has its flaws and requires a good pilot to keep tracking and range to maximize the damage multiplier. I don’t agree with majority of the nerfs that happened to eve (ishtar sentries nerf). 
---
To say auto cannons are in a bad place is a down right lie. They aren’t as good nor as rewarding as they use to be. This was something that required player skill for a payoff yet CCP nerfed it and roles out orbit @ max point range and press F1 ships like orthrus/garmer. Then the kiki because again, players are bad so simplify gameplay.
---
Autocannons are fine and it any buff was to happen, reverse the nerf that was done years ago.
---
I've been living in venal for years and I'm english. But from most of my encounters most of us EU/US folks use NPC null just to make ISK and as a side gig when our other alliances are boring. Origin is one example of this. They still have crabbers back in N5Y and K3 but most of them are chilling with elo and the boyz down in FRT space.
---
So sell them...why are you making more copies than you are selling?
---
I wouldn't even do that if i was in Snuff tbh

I'd join James 315 and follow him to the end times.  He's been right about everything.

What do you expect. Their likely part of the winning side over on the Chinese server so their use to just having their way be it. Ie their not use to actual competition.

Dear CCP. You can save money paying devs to find bots now. I think I know where they are.
---
are you guys that uncreative you can't find a new meme to use?
---
It's only ever a matter of time before snuff turns on you. I'm surprised the Initiative have lasted this long without snuff laying a trap for them
---
pls yes
---
\+1 from casual industralist. CCP is busy with chaos era so stacking BPC would be against direction it.
---
nono, nothing of the sort, your part of a group that literally drew the meta of, and continually supports skill injecting everyone into supers.
---
you stay with them, they fight for and support exactly what it is you just posted about in disgust, injecting into supers,
---
newplayers, idiot, scrubs and sub human intellect's being in capitals. if you truly meant what you have just stated, you wouldve left goons and fought them xD.
---
hence my oh my fucking god no way did a goon just say this.
---
Oh cool. But nothing ilegal as slaves drugs ir something like that?
---
Honestly, you're probably better off contacting Black Frog Logistics, they will deliver from a high sec island to Jita. Unless someone was paying attention, I'd doubt that you'd get someone to haul from the island to Jita, they wouldn't risk a Freighter or DST in lowsec.
---
i covered my eyes with my shirt when watching i shit you not
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of the Fountain War book? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Goon legend. The Fountain War book was a novel so hyped up and so deeply endorsed it could influence EVE meetups to create Kickstarter momentum. Jeff Edwards is a pathway to many books some consider military fiction. It was so hyped, the only thing Goons feared was the book not reaching its Kickstarter goals, which eventually it failed to do. Reddit killed the book in its sleep. Ironic, the book could hype up the EVE player base for everything else, but not itself.
---
i mean, its one fortizar. what extra penaulties is there for it being thier war HQ?
---
all wars end. they replace it and set a bunch more wars? big deal. wars are like 10% of the cost now for the bigger alliances. so theyre still in the green isk wise since the changes xD
---
I've given up believing CCP will ever deliver things like this, it's just not of interest to 99.9% of the player base and potentially a lot of effort to do so.  Why do something useful when you bodge an easy change or half deliver an update.
---
F
---
I just hit my first '1000 T2 BPC's' in a single can limit recently.  I feel the pain.  It would be nice to just slightly merge these up.  I haven't pondered the bigger picture of abuse and what not, but even a factor of 10:
---
1. Saves me space
---
2. Saves me time
---
3. Saves CCP space in their database (and each new item would be no different than now because each BPC from T2 is already customizable with encryptors.)
---
Addendum, you said ISK sink, why not some sort of re-crytor, an item that drops in data sites which does this.  You really wanna make some people happy, make it only drop in low sec.
---
The devs be like - WE CAN GET PAID FOR THIS?!
---
code is the issue, throwing raw power goes only so far
---
Characters using input automation unbalance EVE.
---
This is bad.
---
its almost as if i dont have to agree with every part of the mentality my alliance has
---
i can confirm, when i was in a friendly to pirate group. wardeccing, we would trash jita undock, and just murder and wardec all TEST, Goons, and Horde and ill be honest, TEST are the biggest bunch of idiots ever xD moreso than ANY other group we decced in hisec.
---
but pirat did ask us, to stop wardeccing TEST, (as test pays Pirat for help in thier hisec shit) and they also asked us to stop camping jita, as it was stopping and scaring all the haulers, travellers from roaming hisec.
---
god i love you trottel
---
&gt; 50m SP toon and a 75b ISK ship to be relevant and work back from there.
---
Nope, just learn how to light a cyno.  That's a relevant new bro.  CPU V.
---
Carrier ratting is the next VNI, CCP has demanded it with this blackout. The my-little-small-gang-just-wants-free-kill-then-I-can-dock-thanks-CCP-feed-my-laziness crew pushes for it. They want easy kills and not work hard. It's understandable and great propaganda #saveEVE. But these demands create a reality: get in capitals and tank up against lazy gangs until friends can save you.
---
This. The rest is good advice but this is essential to actually play and enjoy Eve. It's like playing a console FPS. You can sit in a corner and try to not die but are you really playing if that's what you're doing? Personally I consider ships like ammo. I'd like to hit a few baddies with one bullet but if I miss I'm not going to stop shooting.
---
I had a problem once with the Industry UI being limited to 25k BPs. When we asked CCP about it their suggestion was to break it up amongst multiple corporations and create an alliance.
---
thats like, being a nazi, and fighting for him, even though you know hes wrong.
---
true, you can stay, but whats the right things to do in the scenerio?
---
stay, or fight against evil (goons) :D ggrr gons
---
Both can be true, it’s likely they’ve spun off the majority of the game processes that can be threaded into 64bit programs but the core thread/logic is still written in stackless python. It’s also possible it’s legacy DB constraints (you try running a high performance MSSQL cluster for 15 years).
---
From their perspective, the known problems/slowness is a easier problem to mitigate than potentially large scale cluster outages from an upgrade + the hundreds of hours of development and QA to even get to that point. 
---
I’m not saying it’s right but from a business standpoint “lets rewrite the core of our 15 yr old product” is not something appealing
---
Zkill in this video has losses tab displayed... No wonder it's all red
---
Also the neut? You're either sniping from massive range with the cruises or you're within neut range, but with no tackle or range control mods either

What is your Tengu fitting if you are willing to share?
---
No, they're not "useless dead weight".  Why?  If you want to react to market conditions and be nimble, you keep copies knocking around.  They take time to produce.
---
Do you even manufacture?
---
Darkness has been dying for so long... Plenty of people in here hate it here. I really just want someone to come stomp us. I only stay for a few friends that haven't accepted the inevitable. Be real cool if someone killed darkness off so we can finally move to someplace proper.
---
No I haven't.  
---
Are they adding something crazy new and revolutionary to text based messaging that's going to collectively blow the worlds minds when we get it, or are they reinventing the wheel just cause "lol, we're the same company that made the World of Darkness MMO, DUST 514, Gunjack, Project Nova and Valkyrie, so of course we can design a chat terminal for a video game"?
---
Look, I'm not ranting at you, I'm ranting at CCP, don't take this personal.  I went without internet for two months because of a giant fuckup at comcast, and when I get back to the game the chat issues not only aren't fixed, but are worse and being hidden behind "The Blackout".  They are quite literally selling a bug as a feature and people are cheering them on for it.  Blows my mind.
---
As someone who hasn't played for a very long time: who are these Darkness folks and how did they get get that space to begin with?
---
RR already get Sorts priority and devotion.
---
It was a plexing Tengu hastily reffited with two points, not a proper PvP fit. I knew I just needed tank, DPS and tackle so could afford a fit where mobility took the  backseat.
---
God damn now people are feeding to you on Reddit too
---
Love you too bb
---
sounds good. it seems like with the recruit a friend and the 5$ starter you can skill into all of their basic ships
---
I used to.
---
And I would like to introduce you to a concept of Just In Time manufacturing. You will never need 20k destroyers at once. So therefore you don't need the BPCs for them. You don't even have the manufacturing slots available for them. Oh, you manufacture on multiple characters? There is your solution as well!
---
The concept of constantly churning out BPCs is flawed. If that BPC is not going to be used before another one is made, then it is a waste. If you do not want your BPO to be idle, get to producing from BPC or get to selling BPCs.
---
You made the ISK work for you. Good. Keep doing it, we can always use more supers hehe.
---
Wait is brave recruiting f1?

Push alt z

Does not compute. You mean there are other buttons on the keyboard?
---
Its akin to a car. You can build your motor to 2000 whp (upgrade cpu), but if you don't sort out your suspension/tires (code), your performance on a circuit won't improve notably
---
Ah, last I saw of them was when we were dropping caps with them in syndicate.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
What if your friends are thinking the same about you? Maybe you're all just ready to leave together now!
---
The best one is Pandemic Legion.
---
And you all fell for it. They were distracting you. Don't know you how plot twists work?
---
If you want flights of fancy, forget about a shiny processor. Since you've already assumed 'modern code' then don't limit yourself to a single piece of silicon.
---
Start thinking about distributed computing across a server cluster.
---
Pro-Tip: multithreaded programming isn't 'modern'. It's _hard_. Really fucking hard. Smart people have been working on this for decades. To say multithreaded is modern is a bit of an insult. 
---
The shitty code I wrote at work today is definitely modern, but it's not amenable to multithreading. It's in SQL, a language _designed_ to be friendly to that. There is quite literally one piece of code that can't be threaded. The whole thing is bottlenecked down because of it.
---
Ha if only, they always say "It will get better." Even tho it hasn't for over a year.
---
No one. Gave goons 40(?) faction citadels.
---
The server code for eve is not optimized for heavily distributed computing, so throwing more cpu cores at it wont solve the problem
---
It will get better, I'm your new alliance/Corp
---
Invention?  You need copies.  You have multiple characters you need multiple copies.  You have multiple slots you need copies.  You want to react to market movements you need the copies, now.
---
This is Eve ^^Echoes
---
Nope. GeForce Experience is cancer so I never use it. (:
---
After being former N3 members, they were part of the faction that kicked goons out of deklein and surroundings a few years back.     
---
Said faction split up as advertised after the deed was completed and darkness stayed aligned with panfam for a long while.      
---
In a more recent war they peace treatied out and were farmed by their former allies for it. Since then they are aligned with goons.

1. What major change? Please enlighten me on how many people actually suicide gank in this game? Specifically to annoy rookies?
---
2. I offered only proof needed, voice of majority.
---
3. You are trying to argue that this is not important, yet mentioned that you like to suicide gank, without any sort of reliable proof for why it should be kept as it is.
---
4. I could just easily prove that you also are an idiot by pointing out everything you said.
---
5. It is not my steam post, but keep assuming things to try to prove your failed point.
---
6. I have never even get my shit touched by CODE. But seen most of their work.

7. r/eve is filled with bittervets who are scared by every change that will affect their gameplay. You are %100 a suicide ganker and most probably in CODE. aswell.
---
8. get rekt

which most likely is the variable type given to that particular field in the database

Eve doesn't multithread, so it'll use 1 of 112 threads of you fancy processor. GG.

Help me out, what's going on?

Captains bridge.

Flag bridge.
---
Nailed it
---
Blame Adversity, the blatent toxicity has rubbed off on USTZ.
---
Probably the reason why Eve never had higher than 60k PCU for it's 17 years of existence.
---
It's a bridge. There are technically civilian models of every ship and technically any ship larger than a Corvette needs a crew to assist you in its operation.
---
Probably doesn't want to crash prices and devalue his own goods would be my guess.
---
You can get ganked if you are trying to mine in high sec in a t1 mining barge as a rookie. Do you people even read the post first before writing? I am talking about griefing againts rookies here. Not your 15 years of vets.

Is it just my eyes messing with me, or do the "windows" on the bridge seem like they've been drawn wrong?
---
Elo Knight moved Origin and their Cap and Super Cap fleet into Frat to help out.
---
Underrated comment right here.
---
What are you gonna do in your t1 mining barge as a rookie against 8 catalyst who are already prepared to die to Concord anyway?
---
Literally unplayable
---
my butt did indeed start clenching after seeing more then 3 dd animations starting to come in
---
If the "voice of majority" is all that's needed, then you've lost.  Your posts are majorly downvoted.  The voice of majority spoke and you didn't make the cut.  Go back to highsec pleb.
---
yonis flies with 8 heat sinks btw if someone wants to drop something
---
Yeah because you can kill enough catalysts with your drones alone to level the DPS. Do you even know how much DPS you can get from 6-8 catalysts? Of course you wouldn't know. Suicide gankers prepare for the gank, the victim can not. They can bring as many toons as they like to insta pop anything before Concord can come in. There is no restriction against bringing 15 catalysts. Please show me the killmail where you heroicly defended yourself against that many gankers in your procurer.
---
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
---
7 heat sinks and a nano, gotta kite those scrubs
---
Because only a fraction of eve players use Steam. But many new players actually meet with Eve through their recommendations on Steam store page. You must be old here but the new generation does not hear about a new MMO from a gaming blog anymore.
---
But it'll look and sound cool.
---
i´m pretty sure the time investment to get those little red icons to show up on your overview hasn´t changed much. god bless.
---
One issue I see with this is that due to the way CCP calculates ME reductions, you actually use fewer materials per run with the more runs that you do per copy. Allowing a very large amount of runs on a bpc would allow you to spend way less on making items unless CCP changes how they did the calculation. 
---
For anyone wanting to know this is the calculation:
---
Roundup((Base amount * (1 - (ME level / 100))) * number of runs)
---
The fact that it is rounded after being multiplied by number of run (instead of before) is what causes this reduction in number of materials needed per run.
---
It is downvoted on r/eve and we all know why, as I mentioned on my previous comment. Yet it is mostly upvoted in Steam where new players are met with Eve for the first time. You should really seek some help mate.
---
Difference is at least now they are real easy to kill.
---
I know but you need to talk about very big run numbers for it to actually meant to change something.    
---
You are also moving into area of very long production runs, to the point when price fluctuation makes this undesired.
---
It s available yet?
---
That last fight was so amazingly close! Nice vid as always :)
---
This is why i use this window to only make BPC and put something to production, don't even look for BPC there, and as far i know you could use for it.
---
i really was expecting more chaos, or at least a maned station. 
---
They could even try to Guerrilla with ganking fits the smaller targets and still get more content.
---
Not doing a lot of logistics, are you?
---
Tell me, how are you placing beacons in non-sov (NPC null, lowsec) space? As I said, it makes the ship useless.
---
They're not the only one. The horde levi we dropped a month or two back joined our fleet too.
---
Yes, my resoning is those 3 points.      
---
It makes my life easier and can make CCP life easier
---
It is not chaos, it is annoying.
---
Because i can?      
---
I do this on "many" chars in 30day runs.       
---
I just throw to cans , you start to notice when to many cans are filled and you need to bring more small freight containers.
---
Classic Snuff... I'm amazed that people keep trusting you guys in this situation, not really sure how you guys manage to achieve that but well done.
---
Wasn't there a suggestion awhile back to just remove runs from BPCs?
---
As in every discrete BPC is one run, invention/copying just spits out multiple copies and you can shove multiple copies into industry. Then anything with matching ME/TE stacks.
---
LoL at edit 2
---
We like newbros and fell the need to help and nurture them.
---
SO WE CAN MURDER DEATH KILL THEM LATER!
---
Or they us.
---
Wellcome
---
We love killing you :)
---
P.s. Dreddit is recruiting.
---
Hahahha nanogang titans! New meta
---
That exact attitude is why EvE has issues with new player retention. People don't like losing what they worked to get. It's not just pixels, because there was effort involved in aquiring those pixels. It's not the loss of pixels people get upset about, it's the loss of the effort invested to get them.
---
That said, I'm not sure removing that risk would not also cause issues with the whole idea of EvE.
---
Throax still has one of the oldest ship models, probably hand drawn by someone sixteen years ago in his basement
---
Awww miss you mom!
---
This also sometimes having stacks of BPC ready is good.       
---
Need to build something fast -&gt; you open the can and just drop BPC into all production lines you have.
---
Pos code would become self-aware
---
Eve is heavily database-dependent and that database is almost certainly multicore and distributed.  So yes, Eve does multithread.
---
&gt;nono, nothing of the sort, your part of a group that literally drew the meta of, and continually supports skill injecting everyone into supers.
---
I was part of a group that "abused" offgrid boosters, yet I was for removing them. But at the time they where too good to ignore. Or Skynet 1.0, or fist iteration ABCs, or when Ishtars first got buffed.
---
Abusing shit game mechanics does not take away the rights to complain about them. I would say abuse and make it known is one of the fastes ways to get stuff fixed in eve. Those are the people how now the mechanic well.
---
Actually it was quite  a while ago.        
---
During next run i got bunch of dreads and some fax ... now i am getting to a point when i am considering to move again this stuff and sell it in bulk.
---
I was almost interested, then I saw NetEase
---
Awww here’s a cookie for you 🍪 lol
---
Yep, try to make capital copies for inventing them.      
---
Like if you don't have copies ready you can have up to 20 day delay before you can start producing T2 capital modules in reasonable numbers.     
---
I think simple invention from 5? run Triage module takes like 12days.
---
"no u"
---
Uhhh huh
---
Invention need copies, production also need copies.         
---
While you can produce from BPO, you need multiple BPO to fill in your lines, while having stocked up BPC let you abuse opportunity that show up.
---
cant beat em, join em mentality.
---
i get it, its too easy to choose that road. Me? im going to fight against those who do shit i disagree with, no honor, no self respect, its like. why dont both of you BOT (im presuming you dont BOTH do that)
---
its doable, an easy way. and follows your statement of how to run your eve life. but part of me thinks, and wants to think you guys dont. and why.  well it would be those same reasons i would leave the idiots skill injecting into supers on one side, and ill be on the side who turn up and smash thier face in with my earnt super, normally trained alts.
---
unfortuantly there seems to be some weak few who cannot resist going the easy route, and they have the game experiance to give the noobs a chance.  my approach here is to try and get some or all of those people to start leaving them, and have fun fighting them. i mean, it would be fun for everyone if goons split 50/50 and all hell broke loose xD
---
Yes this is basically the idea here.
---
[deleted]
---
Am noob, what does feeding the fleet mean?
---
I would personally allow merging any ME/TE BPCs with result of the lowest ME/TE among them. Add some alert like "you are wasting ME/TE potential" and id probably end up with single can of BPCs.
---
Great Wildlands Pros : Wallymarts is there
---
Great Wildlands Cons : Wallymarts is there
---
also. just to point out, offgrid boosters was not abusing somthing. and skill injecting into supers to be honest isnt 'abusing' somthing. its just say, frowned upon? because its a cheaters way. with offgrid boosters the fight still took place and both sides had normal chances rates.
---
now a 1 week old dude can drop his super on that fight you used to enjoy and ruin it.
---
im saying, ruin that noobs day. ruin his strategy, and fight against them. they just so happen to mostly be in goons.
---
The biggest things you need are:
---
1) **Activity** - stuff to do, people playing the game. This might be obvious, but can't be understated. Recruiting new pilots is important. You need content, content creators, if there is none, create it yourself. Maybe search allies that can provide content or help if you need. If you're small, there are a lotof alliances that would love to help you.
---
2) **Identity** - some kind of "speciality" that speaks to a certain group of people. Doesn't mean you have to specialize hardcore to just one thing, but you should have a goal or a mantra or sth going for you
---
3) **Trust** - This means transparency in what you do, too. People wanna know what's going on and feel valued and involved. I don't think I need to write more about trust.
---
4) **Endurance** - not the ship, but the character trait. There will be failures. A lot of them. All the time. There will be criticism. There might be thiefs, spies, bitter ex members, traitors and people you dislike. There will be drama, losses, setbacks and a million small mistakes. You need to navigate through it, be calm and learn from it but never give in. Be brave and know that it will be hard. But it will be worth it if you push through.
---
5) **Network** - always broaen your network. You can never have too many friends and contacts. You don't need to be blue to everyone to be a friend.
---
6) **A Home** - Have 1 (not multiple) places, where your pilots are based and feel safe and at home. This is one of the most underrated points in my opinion. Having something to call your own (systems or at least a station) makes things feeling way more important and meaningful. You have something to defend and lose now, which brings you together.
---
**Activity - Identiy - Trust - Endurance - Network - Home**
---
The actibity in all of eve has dropped a lot. If you see the number we have lost 5k perma player connected. Some are bot so who cares but we lost also a lot of real player.
---
By myself i just connect and do the sp quest. I will see it later.
---
That statement is an absolute...
---
comparing goons to nazis lol
---
you have made some valid points and have made me question myself, I am unsure on what to do next so i will lay out my options:
---
1. Stay and continue to hang out with my friends Ive known for a few years
---
2. leave my internet spaceship guild soley because some reddit rando told me so.
---
Shitpost Proficiency V
---
Sure, I already have 2 rifters to go with it
---
All their decent pvpers and fc’s have left (no not you Slyce). Add that with the woeful diplomatic skills of sort dragon and you have what was once a decently powerful alliance.
---
Just a matter of time before they widot into RR or finally curl up and die.
---
nono, dont do what anyone tells you to. god know. once again, im here to spark the thoughts that grow into moral movements.
---
i can tell you, ive had 3 GREAT groups of friendships in the game. moving around is acceptable. dont be scared. they wont bite. what youll find is pretty much every group in eve is full of a handful of retards, a handful of dedicated and busy bees, etc etc just every mixed in everywhere.
---
i want goons to fall. i want them to loose shit in glorious battles. ive made some AWESOME friends where i am. but lets say, goons die, they loose. i want to fight who they loose to. one by one. and keep going until im all out of fight.
---
i fear many of the experianced eve players in goons have fogotton what its like to feel the rush of what might be, instead they sit in a 1300man plus super fleet, swinging the big dicks around xD. which is fine, if you got it go for it. but i want somone o be able to fight them, currently, they cant. and if i had one eve wish, it would be for numbers to equalise on 2 sides. and true war to breakout. with a 2000supercapital loss fight to go down :d preferrably on a saturday if that can be arranged, and with pizza
---
Bad UV mapping
---
Not at all, but that extra speed and agility (hardwirings) lets him ensure he doesn't get scrammed
---
I've seen enough hardcore Pokemon Go players to see it happen.
---
I know someone, that lost a Titian like this.
---
Eve servers are single-thread, so all those cores wouldn't do any good. It would run just as poorly, or worse.
---
Thx to Snuffed and HK helping me to get rid of it. The name was awful and i dont know how to rename ships. 
---
iam open for Names for the new Ragnarok. 
---
i showed you my killmail, pls respond 
---
:)
---
But the actual server node that handles the calculations for the fight *are* single-thread. That's the bottleneck.
---
You don't need to be a 15 year vet to know how to tank your T1 mining barge, or any other ship.
---
Whoever drew the textures was drunk at the time, sorry
---
Time to crank up the SortMaster Wheel N' Dealer 5000.
---
It's rumored that if you assemble 4 nano avatars you can make chessur lose Eve again
---
The problem is people actually don't understand the billion degree fireball and celestial objects determine our orbit and temperature. Just like Science class taught you. 
---
Also, hairspray irreparably harmed the earth in the 80's which is why we're all dead today. People will believe whatever dumb stuff you tell them.

#ThisIsEve
---
&gt; FYI stabber with emp is 22.5 falloff. So kiting at 19-22 is perfect range
---
Not really. At that range an Omen with scorch is doing almost twice your EMP damage. You probably should be using Fusion anyway shooting an armor ship.
---
The issue is that DPS drops off a cliff at opt+.5FO. At max falloff+Optimal (18KM with RFEMP in a stabber) you are doing 40% of your paper dps.
---
Yes, they can switch ammo. You lose as much dps as you gain unless the fight last a while, so if your ammo isn't preselected for range and resists, there's not much point.
---
Yes, (If I misunderstood your meaning, I apologize. Your point was difficult for me to comprehend) they have more than one damage type but IMO this is a disatvantage. Part of your DPS is lost to something with a better resist against it.
---
Yes, they track better than pulse. Thing is, if you're at range, the tracking is easier for both and in cruiser on cruiser, probably not as big a help as you think, especially when half your shots miss because you're far away from optimal and he's not.
---
Yes, they have falloff. You ignore that pulse hits out to point range (beyond that doesn't matter if you're not running a gang with discrete tackle) and you are kiting not only at his optimal but making his tracking easier.
---
Capless guns... I'll give you this one. That is an advantage in many cases. but not enough that it makes the weapon OP with low DPS.
---
ROF, I'll have to call time on. I can't Pyfa atm but I did check stats and the omen and stabber were firing almost the same rate and I think the maller (with heavier guns) was firing slower than the rupture. I didn't look at focused pulse on the maller because it had fitting for top tier weapons. Again, so way to check.
---
Split damage... Now I do think I misunderstood point two. What do you mean by "damage multiplayer change (missiles dont get this)?" in any case I said above, I consider this to be a disadvantage on most of the ammo types. Fusion is OK as it's going to hit armor resists hard but EMP splits between armor and shield resists, so you lose a little, there.
---
Yes it's commonly found on minmatar hulls. I'm not sure why this matters, though. all races bonus their ships for particular weapons.
---
&gt;To say auto cannons are in a bad place is a down right lie.
---
Be nice. Nobody's be spouting invective in the thread and it's been quite pleasant.
---
I don't even agree with the many who want the TE un-nerfed. I think the problem is in the raw damage of a single ammo type. T1 ammo isn't horrible and hail is in a decent place but barrage is like throwing rice when at kiting ranges and it's not meant to be used close in. as /u/SlinkyBits pointed out elsewhere in the thread, Autocannons perform reasonably well in close action (the hulls not so much) so I'm not really pushing for a buff to the weapon damages or ranges. Just the damage (pre-multiplier) for barrage. The issue with the combination of hulls and weapons is the A/C hulls imply kiting range action but deliver DPS problematically at that range.
---
I stand by it
---
It sure was this time though. Three battlecruisers parked outside a gate. 
---
I woulda had to align in like 0.1 seconds to not get shot at, and being a T1 industrial it couldn't exactly survive their opening salvo.
---
Origin is in fraternity, so doesn't that mean BL is involved by default?
---
Don't believe him, it's a scam.
---
I on the other hand will keep it for 2 weeks and THEN give you double of it back, because I have invested the money before.
---
It's possible to learn that book?
---
Good luck trying to keep everything synced across all the threads, and making it work in the first place.
---
Yeah it happens homie at least everyone had a good laugh outta it.
---
here's the real trick to meeting ccp devs: go to iceland, wait until the sun is out, visit valdis (that ice cream shop next to the office) 
---
voila you are now surrounded by devs, enjoy the ice cream, it's quality
---
Legacy has:
---
A number of corps in it's own alliance, including aussies, Chinese, and koreans, as well as several russian corps scooped from Stainwagon/Drone lords.
---
TIKLE/DW
---
Army of Mango
---
FI.RE (Russians)
---
Amongst a variety of dudes trickling from other large groups in legacy.
---
Of any alliance in the game right now, Legacy can muster the most dudes in AUTZ or near enough to it.
---
even if you can't visit the office as such i find the granda-region is lovely and there's a lot of good eateries there, worth a visit!
---
&gt; It only ruins someone else's game if they let it.
---
... That's not how ruining things works...

Everyone who has ever been in CODE should be banned. Not that they've ever managed to catch me, but they are objectively bad for the game.

---
Hey nice video duder! I've been thoroughly enjoying the abyss myself lately... Although man, it's harsh! I've been using a Gila which I've been told can do T4s but then I go and die in a T3.
---
Not bad, some of the dialogue was a little too quick though.
---
Nice one GOTG tards.
---
Wc had an eagle fleet of 250 people + Horde's muninn fleet of 250 =500 peeps with the 70-80 supers and titans on the fort. Legacy bringed a full nightmare fleet + fire in eagles + goons in eagles + init in stuka that makes more than 1000 on legacy's side without counting caps. 575 vs 1000+ and complain about no fight? You dumb? lol
---
Oh and the comms spy that seddow has on each fleet (he even pinged for one).
---
That wasn't an insult btw. I appreciate a good shitpost.
---
If goons and test deploy supers i wouldn't blame anyone for just rolling over and giving up immediately
---
&gt; ( the Ree's from delve can be heard across the galaxy)
---
I hope CCP beats the goon man for you.
---
i think the issue we may be having here. is your trying to kite at longpoint range with short range guns.
---
i mean, the fact this is even possable to be a strategy is disgusting
---
yes, like i stated, both of lasors weapon types offer reasonable short or long range options on both weapons. but thats the style of the gun. theyre not the best at super long ranges, and theyre not the best and super close ranges. you know this so you either get real close to this omen your trying to beat in your stabber/rupture. or you stay real far away.
---
emp is great for killing T2 caldary btw, also i think T2 gallante? and fusion and explosive t2 ammos is great armour tanked ship killers.
---
and lasors downsides is the powergrid fitting, MASSIVE cap usage, and short range bands on each crystal type. and always swapping them out can mean life or death. this is where range control comes into it, minmatar is fast, and cap free, meaning they can get to thier close range if they want to. use this to your advantage.
---
compare this all like i did earlier to a thorax with hybrids, more dps. more tracking, but, even less tank than the lightly tanked rupture in my example earlier. and once again damage type locked. and no neut, so still subsceptible to cap pressure,
---
capacitor warfare is the most powerful and used e-war there is, and minmatar ships get the best use out of them
---
&gt; There is no meaningful content in hisec
---
Not everyone considers ruining someone elses day "meaningful content".
---
yep i know got like tons of it split across alts xD
---
I had never noticed, only saw the punisher before. Thanks for pointing it out, I'll go bleach my eyes now.
---
Ah gotcha.
---
Well memed sir
---
Depends on your locale, I'd say.
---
And of no surprise to anyone involved, PIRAT then war decc'd all those who took part :D
---
PL in 2019 lol
---
The combat timer got me
---
Calm down capsuleer. Our logistics teams can only move your fatass so fast between  pods, ships and undocks. Please take a deep breath of that goo and enjoy that 10 seconds of tranquillity.
---
I signed up. I'll probably play it a few times, if I like it I might play it once a year like all my other mobile games. Except the text adventure one because I like Zork and the old Infocom games.
---
More a case of all of us in the vicinity showed up
---
I've been looking at Stain a lot, it seems that Wrecktical Supremacy are the way to go, them or Good Sax, yes. You know anyone specific one could refer to?
---
I'm doing my part!
---
PushX requires omega, has Red Frog got a similar restriction?
---
Not my proudest fap
---
what the fuck am i looking at
---
We don't deserve bollywood
---
TLDR: I like ECM, give Widow and GNI range bonuses.
---
I think you are missing the fact that some of those "carebears" are using the highsec income to fund their pvp. They get suicide ganked in high, make no money, and therefore do not pvp because they can't afford to. For example, I'm pretty god awful at pvp. I cannot make enough to keep myself in ships by pvping. I need the hisec income, or I don't get to pvp.
---
Real Chad hours
---
&gt; hulls and weapons is the A/C hulls imply kiting range action but deliver DPS problematically at that range
---
youve caught this all wrong, the speed imo is to get into close range easier xD
---
or with arty, stay at range.
---
consider this example (im a frig pvper so i do this alot)
---
my Repuplic fleet firetail vs comet blaster boat,
---
atron more dps cos blasters, i go in 0m and fight, i then kite out to 4-6km where he has to switch to null ammo, and i can continue fighting with my current choice, and i can do so as i am faster and my range measn i can keep average pressure on him while at range and in my falloff. (lets say for the example of minmatar style is faster)
---
i then turn, and close the gap. im now at my full dps still with the same ammo type. he has a choice, change to void (or faction ammo) again, reloading (5seconds is a looong time in frigs) or continue with the less dps and tracking of Null. you see. things arnt black and white, pilot skill is everything. if somthing is better slightly in one scenerio.whatever its impossable for complete fairness. play to your strengths.
---
if lasors are so frekin awesome use those xD why stick to minmatar ships if they suck, when no one uses them, theyll fix it
---
I understand that. But go ahead and do the invention. If they sit for too long, sell them and invent more. Idle ISK is wasted ISK.
---
Accordingly, [this is the version I made](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/R2tTk5T) adapted from the Horde logo.
---
well. then i would say it is currently fixed. lol
---
the games not meant to have money made FROM it. only IN it
---
1.Stay and continue to hang out with my friends Ive known for a few years
---
2.leave my internet spaceship guild soley because some reddit rando told me so.
---
&gt; 0.1
---
Nope, just 2 seconds.
---
sub-2 seconds makes you uncatchable.
---
Just that you saw them at a gate doesn't even mean they were gate campers (though they might have been). People often sit on gates while waiting for scouts to go ahead.
---
So then its a self-created problem?
---
Sounds like the monitor is end of life, time to spend $400 on a new one.
---
The Thorax is one of the oldest cruiser models, all of the other old (tier 3) cruisers have all had redesigns (Moa, Rupture and the Maller).
---
But then there is no value to be gained by continuing to copy.
---
If your supply is so far outreaching the demand, you should probably stop supplying so much excess.
---
I mean, they don't rott away or anything...
---
Its a 1500$ monitor which is a year old. So I don’t think so. :P
---
I agree but as a vet that lately alway on the move, it will be nice to get my fix via my phone or tablet
---
Two phones?  [Only if you're a newb...](https://i.imgur.com/AQ0ZyPx.jpg)
---
3. leave your mummas titties and go be an adult and not scared to meet new people lol
---
if they are your friends, not corpmates, they will stay in touch, chat, let you into thier social media. like mine did, and do. and will.
---
to which the more you repost this (fully expecting a third dont let me down) makes me think im talking to one of the retards in goons, not one of the experianced, skilled pilot of old dudes.
---
im guessing you only got into a super because you are in goons, and because you skill injected into it xD haha how life does this to us eh
---
NSH my man

Ps
---
Criterion. Is Recruiting
---
Threading is overrated. Unless you're dealing with independent things (big fights aren't) space-like or time-like separated, you need a buttload of mutexes or a buttload of data copies, neither of which are particularly nice when 6,000 people are all pummeling away at each other.
---
There is never a "need" to have 1k identical BPCs sitting in a hangar. None. If you cannot all at once use them, they are doing nothing for you. It is basic logistics. Product sitting is wasted. Ev e being a game does not change that.
---
Remember Tiananmen.
---
I would be okay with the session timers if more of them would stack properly so I dont have to wait between them. For 1 toon this might be okay but 4+ toons is no fun.
---
Ya know I never agreed with evicting FRT. Always thought "who would we fight next?" 
---
Now I want them gone
---
&gt; as you can see in a brawling setup here
---
I totally agree in a straight up brawl, that hail is fine. That's why I only focused on barrage as an ammo. I would say all of the T1 ammo is also pretty good. 
---
TBH, the hulls are half the problem. It's like the Minmatar are truly conflicted. One engineering team builds ships designed to fight from long range but can only fit short range weapons and the other team produces a hull that has PG for the long range guns but the tank to get in closer.
---
Of course with ONIs and Cynas (this hull is what pisses most people off tbh) you need a ramjag to pin someone down long enough to get into brawling range. I was more interested in comparing a fight between relatively similar hulls and weapons.
---
That's the basic reason I started off using the stabber vs the Omen. Both hulls have reach (on paper) and both are pretty fast when fitted for speed. There won't likely be neuts involved ut if the stabber does have them (rather than rapid lights) then they will be smalls and if the omen has a web or sports a cap booster, they won't matter in enough time.
---
Basically, my only big problem with autocannons is barrage.

A single tear just fell from my eye

For anyone wondering: The movies is called Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. And this is one of the more moderate fight scenes. It's on Netflix.
---
Congrats to being the first person to ever zoom in on an unskinned thorax, hopefully this gets patched FAST
---
Keep dreaming FRT - that’s one wet dream thats never going to reach completion.
---
the issue being, fit the omen with AC's and the stabber with lasors, the omen still wins, thats just not what the stabber is meant to be able to do lol
---
ok, so buff barrage falloffrange, to then increase its damage at long range falloff, but not affect the optimal range effectiveness. sure w.e go for it.
---
but i think were mixing between two convosations here xd but no, minmatar ships were not 'designed for long range' they have thier stats. and can brawl just as good and the next guy.
---
the guns like this post states is not the issue, the issue is people dont know thier strengths, and want them to be good at everything.
---
I clicked it but some kind of interstitial popped up and I made it as far as "Pardon the interruption" before I lost all interest in your thoughts on ECM.
---
Your blog sucks.
---
You would have to treat it as a map reduce problem.
---
At the start of the tick, split it into as many chunks as sensible (for things like weapons fire) and physics simulation. Process them independently, bring them together at the end.
---
It would introduce certain oddities, like two ships being able to kill each other in the same tick using guns.
---
some people shouldnt reproduce, but here you are, ohwell?
---
i mean, if people wernt meant to live in wormholes, why did they add anchor points for POS's? POCO's?
---
It's your prerogative to continue using a broken monitor, might want to check if there is an RMA policy.
---
Also, as long as g-sync doesn't work its like a 800 dollar monitor. So I'll ask you to refer to it as this from now on as to not offend those with operational models.
---

---
Well "good" is subjective, people will prefer making isk one way over another. In plain top isk/hr there's only really a few activities that would really be "options", but if people make enough isk to fund their accounts + whatever activities they take part in and actually enjoy the activity that makes their ISK, it'd be much preferable over doing other things that the player doesn't like doing.
---
spend money in eve online pls your one alive income.

Last week I moved 7 alts. That meant get out of ship, swap clones, jump clone, get in other ship. All with session timers, it was lame as hell and I was wondering the same thing.
---
Hey great video. I'm curious about your accent though, to me you sound like a Scottish person who grew up in the USA or something. It's like you switch seamlessly between the two through every sentence. No offense intended, you sound great, just honestly curious.
---
Contracts in eve are always between players. It can be between a player corporation and a player, but it still involves players.
---
Courier contracts shouldn't be confused with missions; they're moving things for NPC's, but the cargo itself carries no actual value and items are spawned/despawned at will. It also doesn't involve enough ISK that you could consider it a valid profession, as you'd have to grind an insane number of them to be able to even afford PLEX each month.
---
Ah, so you may get on the first kill of the fleet! Excellent! That solves everything!
---
Well you know businesses have a bottom line to meet got to beat that quarterly earnings even for CCP.

It was mentioned that you happened to log and fly during your own Zkill blackout. Was this the major push to keep it back to what it was? Did you happen to see the benefits of both sides viewing it as a player instead of as admin to your site?
---
&gt; 1) Relatively unpopular as a scam
---
You'd be surprised, really. Using the public courier listing, if you've never filtered out the scams or haven't done so in a while, you may have the entire first few pages of worthwhile contracts be scams. 
---
&gt;3) Purposefully priced high in collateral cause that's the profit 
---
Mostly true, though... sadly i've seen some scammers end up lowering the numbers to what could be considered newbie territory. Any profit is stll profit, it's not like they really have any risk other than time investment.

Just because we have more doesnt mean we dont form the same. Realistically we do because of how the timers how we usually form similar numbers. Yes we can outnumber frat if we all hands on dick but we don’t like to. The timezone difference makes it pretty even to be 100% honest. Because ee have to take fights in their prime timezone and in our worse timezone

Delaying it for more than an hour is almost pointless. An hour gives you a window so that you don't have instant intel of what's happening, but you aren't waiting all day to see a BR for a fight that is already over. Just my $0.02
---
Oh that's nifty then. I've been seeing a sunesis fit that's supposed to be able to do that.

I love this pic too !!

I need a "Dino in a China Shop" propaganda piece in my life rn

Well, it kinda is.  People will quite happily 0.01ISK , and do so all the time.  Hoping they will not do it out of the goodness of their own hearts (ie; the 0.01ISK behaviour would not become the 'norm' for contracts if you enabled price modifying) really does make this something that sits on the line between altruism and money.

And yet people will continue to ask snuff for help, and will continue to be surprised when this happens.

Hey man I do what I have todo to win. :shrug:
---
You have been very butthurt the last few days. Elo touch your butt wrong this week?
---
Let me be more clear - this issue is ONLY in Eve at the moment. The gsync feature works otherwise, but gsync should also limit Eve’s FPS to the refresh rate which it doesn’t in this case when the stuttering happens. (:
---
Maybe implement proper fighter values too?
---
Everyone is soooo obsessed about symmetry. Why can't we accept the gallente for what they are?
---
Option A) They merge  
---
Option B) They fight  
---
Option C) This continues
---
Yup, the game works in 1 second ticks.
---
So you uncloak, they person can't even start locking you until 1 second after that (it may appear like they do but doesn't actually) then if they can lock faster than 1 second, at the next second they would lock you. In that same tick though, you'd enter into warp before their modules could activate.
---
This is better yes
---
I think too many people are obsessed with their green/red killboard stats, leads to padding and other "non-natural" behaviors in order to get "green". Just like K/D ratio in shooters....
---
He's playing on low-end settings and is confused why the textures look like shit.
---
They shortened it before, but increased it due to that bug where ships started floating out of citadels while the owner was logged off iirc
---
I thought about this some time ago.  You need to partition the set various ways according to what can influence whatever else, then hand those partitions off to individual threads to process.  Of course it probably works great until Horde show up in a bunch of noob frigates and start firing off ECM bursts.
---
Hey man I do what I have to to win :shrug:
---
Maybe it was downvoted because the people here actually know how the game works? 
---
In the meantime, I appreciate you letting me hang out, rent free, in your brain.  Can I at least clean up the place for you?
---
It also doesn't make wormholes particularly uncomfy. It's kinda hard to get on the bad side of a bigger group to the point where they're actually going to put effort in to inconveniencing you.

You seem butthurt this week. Did elo not satisfy your asshole well enough this week? :p
---
I, uh, I'm not...

Backs away slowly.

Classic CCP lmao
---
Well yes i no.     
---
I have the BPO so and the free lines, so if i am not making new BPC i am wasting isk. The initial investment ^(install fee) is also not so big.
---
oh god, the old maller....
---
If you approach the game knowing it's only pixels and spaceships, nothing can be ruined.  I've lost blinged to shit marauders in PvP and I just laughed.  It's all how you handle it.
---
Owning d-tier legacy/test fcs on the daily starts to drag on you after a while
---
Something else you can do is meme-fit a Nereus and instead of relying on speed to get away, you rely on a 250-ish DPS shield tank (or more depending on how you fit it) to survive while the gate guns kill or force your opponent off-grid. Won't necessarily work against a full-on gate camp, but you will be battle-ready enough to fight off a few attackers, and you get more cargo space than a Sunesis for less money.
---
An example fit from zkill: https://zkillboard.com/kill/78272568/
---
Problem with this is that the API doesn't reveal how many were in the squad, nor even if it did, would it handle scenarios such as, lose half the squad, pull them back, relaunch them again (in a scenario where you have no new fighters to replenish the squad)
---
Because of this squizz presumes a fighter to only be 1 fighter, not an entire squad.
---
Personally think presuming an entire squad would be a much more sane default, but heyho.
---
Ever heared about battle procs? 
---
Also what, are you now gonna complain that mining barges aren't as good at shooting shit as ships that are made to shoot shit? Well sorry the game didn't serve you your one for all cookie cutter invincible newbro boat but rejoice, if that's what you're looking for i have [the goal](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/thumb/c/cd/Rorqual.jpg/256px-Rorqual.jpg) for you to work towards.

It is also to not have the BPO and copy line idle.

It doesn't count unless you reply in meme.

feeding is used to say that someone died in a game in a dumb or intentional way.

I don't mind it being idle if I've got what I need to produce the kind of batch size I usually product when I need to produce it.  I mean now you're being unreasonable.

Yea being able to queue up the session timer commands would be very nice since I regularly have to do this with multiple toons at once.

A feature I would like is the ability to combine the stats of multiple characters so we can get a single view that combines all our alts.

Loot fairy said no for sure there

Imagine being that stupid to trust snuff in 2019
---
 72.9% damage came from a Republic Fleet Berserker
---
It's not quite what happened.
---
People switched ship and undocked. But as it hadn't fully registered the move, both the ship, and the player in their capsule undocked. 
---
That's what the session change timer is for. To stop that kind of shit.
---
Wow thats a nice write up. You deserve a better explanation from me. Sorry im not a reddit master so i need to figure out how to break your answers down with replies. Im at work and one hand typing on a phone wih a broken screen while sitting in a truck with schematics, a laptop with several excels sheets,blah blah blah in my lap . Give me 48 hours to properly write up a reply. I will edit this comment.
---
For the time being, depending how the omen is fitted most people plug the weakest resistance. I was using em as an example of a faction ammo. Put 1 tracking computer on the stabber and you will get 22.5 range. Omen is locked to dealing only em and therm. If you know you’re going in to fight one, you can maximize on tanking em/therm. You can’t predict what damage auto cannon will do (you can have low kin resistance as AC/arty does shitty kin damage).
---
Damage multiplier is getting a smash, penetrate, wrecking (i think that the other one) which ranges from doing 150-300% more damage. Missiles don’t get this and pyfa doesn’t calculate this. This is unique to Drones and turret base weapon systems only. 
---
At falloff you’re doing 50%. Charts people use to determine how well a ship will apply damage to a smaller ship is misleading. This can be overcome by using your overview. This is also which i bitched and complained about the new tracking system as the new score doesn’t correlate with the “rad” tab in the overview.
---
Example lets say youre using a talos, old system would say (gun res 400m tracking .02) you would have rad tab on overview. A interceptor points you and is pecking away at your shields.  You would put drones out and sling shot to distribute ceptors orbit to held drones catch and apply dps. If during that moment the ceptor fell within your tracking (lets say mwd ceptor has 50m sig, you need to take gun res 400/50=8 then divide .02/8=.0025) and within falloff, press f1 and gg ceptor. New score doesn’t correlate which makes it completely worthless as you have to reverse calculate it.
---
Here is a example of it being applied 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/43340002/
---
Exodus is know for being a kickass small gang group. Their pilots are well experienced. Yet my talos 1 shot his ceptor at 35km. I was using null and the old tracking system to land that shot. Yes i have a tracking computer and yes i took improved drop.
---
Anyway, ill give you a better reply later.
---
I've taken all this information and determined your monitor is worth $800 and broken. I'll buy it for $350.

btw, loot fairy said nope

Syndicate is an NPC region which is mostly filled with English speaking or EU small alliances. For Syndicate specific alliances look at Intergalactic Space Hobos, Ishuk-Raata Enforcement Directive, Sons of Bane, and V.E.G.A. The first 2 are US TZ and the last 2 EU TZ.
---
It would be nice to have a "leave ship" button, perhaps next to the "board my corvette" button.
---
&gt;Carriers would no longer field fighters
---
" Carriers would no longer field fighters ..." - yeah... tell that to the US or British Navy and wait for their response. It is like words do not mean what they should mean anymore.
---
Well like month worth of copying some capital module for max run bpc is 4-9mil.    
---
Not making those copies is wasted time and resources.
---
Gets dunked on daily by literally everyone else.
---
So are there PVE activities that don’t have an end goal of just making more money? Are there challenging NPCs out in space that I would need to build up my ships and skills in order to defeat? I want to try to get into eve again, but from the outside looking in it just seems like it’s group PVP or jobs to get more money to better at PVP. I don’t necessarily mind that, I am just trying to understand all the the possible paths of progression. I realize it’s a sandbox, but just trying to understand as many of the possible goals as I can.  
---
My schedule is very sporadic. Sometimes I can play 1 hour a day and sometimes I can play 6 hours a day.  I feel like that is going to make it a challenge to be “active” in a Corp, so I’m just trying to understand what I can shoot for as primarily a solo player.
---
Yeah I think pushing the KMs as they are received is the better way.. let CCP handle the blackout/intel-related things such as the timing the information is pushed out.
---
Only one curry place in the city?

Nah mate. That's not British. ;)

Looking at Just eat, I have 38 places I can order Indian from. (with three opening at 5pm) (only 16 which are explicitly marked for curry, but the ones I looked at which weren't tagged, still did)

Aren't there other things CCP could do besides a delay? Like blank out the location for 2 hours or something?

I hope you will try out a few things in the future. Some people liked the changes, some didn't, doesn't matter. Hopefully you learned something and will continue to run your site.

---
Thanks for everything that you do with zkill. It has to be a ton of work but, man, what a resource.
---
I think this is the right call, it’s up to CCP to implement ESI delay and delaying them yourself just opens you up to competition from other killboard sites which imo is bad for everyone, better to have a complete killboard for the whole game.
---
As always thx for your work squizz

It helps if your chemically altered?

Baahubali 1 is also a good watch, though I saw them out of order and don't regret it.

Side note: Bahubali is phenomenal.

Because he is the hero Eve deserves, but not the one it need now....sadly....so we downvote him, because he can take it.

Hey squizz, since you asked for feedback: I really liked how paying isk removed not just the ads, but the actual slot for the ad as well. Reverting that change made paying for no-ads a little less valuable, and I'm not sure why.

&gt; I know WinterCo has a zkillboard clone going, good! Now upgrade that server and get all 54.5m killmails onto it would ya? :)

It’s cool that after 10 years of playing your lovely game I still find things that get my heart racing.
---
I mean, sure. But there were two guys like that at my last track day. One (Lancer Ralliart) had his brakes catch fire (ghetto bbk from what I understood), and the other (wrx) cooked his so badly that he spent half the session circulating at 30 kph just to cool them down.

Honest answer, just pay for your sub and never worry about it again.  If you can't or won't do that, the lowest effort ways I've found are station trading and planetary interaction.  Both only take a few minutes a day if you don't try to min/max it.  If your corp is in FW, you could run level 4 missions - supposed to be very lucrative and there are guides out there.
---
And I knew the war in Afghanistan wasn't about Osama bin Laden, aka "anti-terrorism", but for Oil companies.  
---
It was about ousting Saddam Hussein because the CIA couldn't bribe, corrupt or overthrow him.   
---
No one cared about that either.   
---
And now everyone knows!
---
Which is weird, because being aligned can still save you if you're quick on dscan.
---
Yeah that's right 20 days of training will get you frigate/destroyer level 3 and small laser/hybrid/projectile/light missile with a lot left over to get your fitting skills mostly sorted too.
---
I havnt ran the exact numbers but if you add only the one month of (half price) omega training thag should be enough for getting your fitting skills done so you can actually train what you want to. Power grid and cpu skills are critical but so boring to get trained.
---
I hear you, I got some feedback saying that they didn't like how the page is moving around. Which I completely understand. As part of  my feontend rework I'm going to readjust this
---
Join a corp?
---
It doesn’t necessarily require sov but it’s basically not at all worth doing without it. 
---
Sov allows you to upgrade your systems which is what produces the abundance of good sites that null groups have to work with. NPC null doesn’t have that. 
---
You also get no benefit of any sort of intel network and so you are at an even higher risk for being killed.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
i'm curious, can you see the effect Zkill instant intel has? for example when people see kills of a gate camp do they go there to find a fight? 
---
if so, could you perhaps put some false kills reports up temporarily to generate content? perhaps just as bait for your own fleet :)
---
Thanks :-)

I took this away a few years ago because that was killing the database, but now I think I might have an idea that will bring it back without murdering the database anymore

It was an interesting experiment, but I think of limited value unless implemented on the CCP side, for reasons you've alluded to (people can host their own version). I know zkill has a list of very useful filters one can use in the URL to ask more refined queries, is  it possible for a list of them to be included in the FAQ?
---
Elo doesn't want to go to prom with you Seddow.

I'm not sure what it is but this seems like it might be fake.
---
Has the mining rohk officially died?
---
Sounds like some amateur scripting for this.
---
got a pretty weird boner right now
---
I'd suggest you look into running abyssal sites. There's 5 levels of difficulty - t1 to t3 is relatively easy, but going on to t4, it's a huge difference in difficulty and t5 is a monster where you'll need ships blinged upwards of 1bil + pod implants that will be another 1-2bil. Plus you have to complete the site in not more than 20mins because after 20mins you and your ship is destroyed (and the pod also). So it kinda makes it more interesting because obviously you cannot leave the site once you go there. Also the t4 and t5 pays out really well. I've never been interested in pve but those sites are engaging so I do some of them from time to time.
---
Have you checked your system logs?
---
Don't know if this will kill the database, but it would be nice to be able to set custom feeds so I can see what my friends are up to or make coalition custom feeds.

I agree I used a Gnosis with a higgs anchor  jetcan like mad then pick up the cans with a Masmos. The higgs lets you align and stay aligned while you mine.
---
Some code ganker tried to bump me and with the higgs he just bounced off.
---
I'd love to have some kind of interface where I could map clones to ship type so if I undock my blaster tengu Im always in my crystals w/ turret hardwiring. I kind of think the whole implants/clones/jumping needs to be split so you could still jump around with a cooldown but be able to say "im in warpspeed flycatcher, let me swap to crystal tengu" in a single session timer. Swap to pod&gt;swap heads&gt;jump in ship&gt;join fleet&gt; undock takes quite a long time. Getting repeatedly told no along the way is frustrating when the fight is already in progress.
---
Correct, red box means they've aggro'ed you, and yellow it means that they've just locked you up
---
Honestly that's funny af. And being in a battleship makes it less likely a gank target.

I see your point, but it would still be nice to have the ability to take a 1 run, a 2 run and three 5 run bpcs and merge them with a research tool, (yeah remember those?) and get a a single 15 run BPC out of it (with efficiency losses).

Damnit!!

There is one consideration:  the bonuses to reduction in materials once you scale.  making 1000 items at once, you use less materials than 10 runs of 100, due to rounding.  I would trade being able to consolidate with not having that bonus.  (you just add up the costs from the input BPC's, not recalculate costs after consolidation).
---
Wait, no, that's the same problem.  This is where the balance issue would come into play, it would net make T2 production cheaper, once you get the bonuses from the stations.  now, if you reduced the station bonuses in proportion to the new reduction from consolidation... but then you punish the little guy who can't make 100 bpc's before doing 1 run.  
---
I want this idea, I am just spit balling about potential issues and abuse.
---
Better filters for killboards. Let me see all of X ship type lost from date Y to Z in system A. Filter for most valuable ships ever lost, most people on a kill, etc.

Places like jita get their own node dedicated to the calcs happening there. Don't be a prick when you know damn well what we're talking about and have been talking about for years.
---
Wrong wrong wrong wrong. Wrong wrong!  You are all to young to know the true reason behind this because you weren't there when it happened.        Way back In the dawn of eve they did a graphics update. This graphics update applied a layer over all of the ships in eve. This gave them a metallic shiny appearance and generally from a distance improved the look of the ships from a matte look to a glossy texture.  The side effect of this was that on close examination it warped the underlying textures on all of the ships distorting them. This was around 2006 ish
---
Which would be cool and more realistic anyway and i just wish they'd do it. Bullets can pass each other in space and impact their targets at the same time.
---
Well if anyone wants you dead you'll die. Just the nature of people.
---
Wrong. The updated the thorax model. And fucked it up so rather than fixing the model they slapped a lip on the end of the ships wing for the weapon mounts.  Forever destroying g the sexy look of this ship
---
And here I thought you were going to warp into smartbombs.
---
Admittedly, BPC's have a balance factor in themwith the "max runs". They're not intended to be a replacement for a BPO, they're intended to be clunky so that you will want to get an extra BPO or place it in a situation where it might be at risk rather than safely stashed away.
---
For T2 BPC's, the balance is already there in the time/cost to invent, merging them together would be less of an issue.

Completely agree...

Then again, knowing this community, without these timers I can imagine the entire playerbase clone jump spamming the entire server to its knees because &lt;insert reeeeee&gt;.

Thanks for the update!
---
Yeah, it's not your job to implement game balance (delayed kms) and with API data accessible to all, it wouldn't have worked.  It opened the door for another public kb with no delay and wouldn't have helped with "balance."  Bigger groups with better infrastructure would just have their own, leaving smaller groups or more independent people at a disadvantage.
---
A couple ideas for you if that's cool (bearing in mind that Eve players probably aren't numerous enough to devote a ton of resources here):
---
- one thing I think Eve could benefit from is a way to translate the "narrative" that players intuitively understand into a way for non-players to follow.  The image of Eve is that it's "cool to read about but too hard to play."  Whether it's true or not, there's potentially a broader audience out there than just players (who are probably the only ones who use zkb).  There's a whole big feature set that can probably be done with the data that's available, but I'm thinking of the BR page first (fights are interesting).  I'm sure it's a bitch to work on, but any plans to take a pass at that?
---
- kind of as an extension of that, I'd really love to see zkb lean into the "intel tool" idea (for a few reasons).  Beyond shitposts and memes and risk aversion, I don't think zkb should be included in the "perfect intel" question the game is seeing right now.  KMs are already unprivileged and can reach anyone in the game almost instantly, so their availability on a public website, especially after the cache interval, is entirely appropriate (imo).  With zkb in its current form and cadence, tons of intel already exists if you know how to look so it's basically raw, unaggregated data.  You could do anything from low-key charts instead of tables for the sidebar and pilot role labels ("Cyno," "Titan pilot," etc.) or something deeper.  
---
Either way, I think you should feel free to add features as you see fit and not worry about *inadvertently being suboptimal* for the game.  You've done a lot for the game so you're well within your rights to chalk it up to "emergent gameplay" if CCP decides they want to give out less data.

Not RMT or kb paddind ... just a simple gank.

America- Oldest child, they were born and then the UK had a midlife crisis and neglected them socially until their late teen. Still was an ok dad, and provided, but just not there to raise them. Gets in a fight with the Uncle's kid, the uncle who Dad always fought with at family reunions and sets of a feud that results in ad being broke, adopting the Uncle's kid, and correctly blaming the American for starting this mess and promising that from now on there will be some rules around here. Goes about as well as expected. Dad and the Oldest get into a fight, Oldest and the Uncle find out they have a lot in common, aka hating Dad. Oldest manages to get a few good kicks in, but Dad simply can't concentrate on fighting him and Uncle. Dad eventually goes "fine do what you want!" and tosses them a set of car keys, the Americans pack their shit and leave as he concentrates to beating down the Uncle.
---
Canada- Adopted middle child, but still directly family. Shortly after America moves out, Canada manages to fend off America's drunken effort to come and steal the good stuff from their room while America muttered drunkenly, "should..of..been mine anyway, dork.." and then falls out a window on an equally drunk dad who was celebrating kicking down the uncle again and gets in a bit of a scuffle. Everyone kinda embarrassed and hung over the next day and they just agree to leave stuff in the past. After a while Canada starts dating, staying out late, and doing their own things that the UK doesn't mind too much, but kinda reminds them of the US's rebellious phase and says "As long as your living under my roof, you'll live by my rules!" Canada looks kinda confused for a moment and says "Dad, I'm 30, finished college, and am a grown-up country now. I even have my own house, and was just visiting for the weekend like I usually do" The UK goes "o... well...hmm.. sorry...I'll go downstairs now. You'll still call every other weekend?" Canada nods and clasps his shoulder warmly, then politely yet firmly leads him out of his room while he packs his things to return home to the same town the US lives in.

You should have been my history teacher. Where were you?!
---
stainguy is a saint you leave him alone
---
Because you need military upgrades on an ihub to consistently spawn the anoms. It is possible for anoms to spawn randomly, but they will mostly be bad ones and you will be jumping your expensive ratting cruiser all over the place and will die to gate camps. It would be better to focus on data/relics in a cheap frig, and maybe once you can afford/skill into a stratios you could possibly start mixing some drone escalations and 6/10s into your explo runs, and if you happen to come across a decent anom that is a random spawn you could run that too.
---
That was only step 1 of 25 though

DON’T YOU GUYS HAVE PHONES?

I really dont care about plex prices and the carebears need a few hits. If its from patchnotes or pvpers. If modules get too expensive on the market because noone loots them anymore, we still can pvp each other with ibis.

It's not easy between the demands if family, work, and other hobbies, and other games i play. Sometimes i usually just log in an alt and rat for a bit too

---
obligatory 'eve has sound ?' comment
---
awwww &lt;3
---
For ideas that might be nice to have and still reasonable to implement: most commonly used/lost fits for each ship. On implementation side it could just use checksum of the fit (just hi/med/low/rig/subsystem slots, skipping cargo contents) for finding matches, and having this for browsing popular/common fits for X ship would be great in terms of learning how to fit your ship based on others experiences.
---
As for advanced search - given how complex the rework would be, why not give (even as daily snapshots/dumps/differential) a way to access raw kill history in automation-friendly way? That should be enough to get good advanced search for everyone who really needs it (and help against people likely to abuse advanced search when it comes out - if doing it offline would yield better results), while not really changing what you can get from zkill directly - all killmails are accessible via either websocket or website crawling anyway, this would just make it less annoying for everyone. I mean it as nothing more than: get all killmails added yesterday, serialize to JSON/XML/YAML/anything, zip the output, put as a file in some static CDN for anyone to download. If that's reasonable depends on what you see advanced search main goal is - whether it's more for finding specific fits (say, T3s with covert cyno) or for supporting someones combat history analysis.

Due to things like smartbombs/other AoE effects, whoring on friendly ships etc. any kind of somewhat reliable relation detection based on kill history is extremely hard to automate (especially if you consider separate alliance pilots in coallition, out of alliance alts, more complex politics - by looking at Delve kill history alone you could say that test+snuff+nc. are allies, or people moving between groups and ending up hostile/friendly only at certain point in time). Getting simple search for kills involving both of given characters should be doable and I hope something like this will be part of advanced search.
---
Not great, not terrible, like a chest X ray
---
lol, and I thought spodbrains couldn't get any more stupid.
---
did I say anything about who started it? the point is that frat are on the defensive in this "round 2" as you called it
---
which btw, even though it was inevitable, it was test that actually broke the NIP 2-3 days before it was officially over.
---
as I said, the reasons that this war is happening don't matter for the discussion we were having. the result was that detorid, insmother, wicked creek and scalding pass are being toasted and had offensive citadels being dropped. that automatically makes it a defensive war for frat even if "round 1" was an offensive one.
---
Maybe like a private squad, where people can add multiple characters.
---
Thermal shutdown would be my guess.  Install speedfan, monitor your CPU and GPU temperatures while playing, if you have either your CPU or GPU go over ~95c that's what's killing you.  Then the reboot gives your machine just enough time to cool off to play for a few hours.

Then easy fix is to make them just as BO. Enough of a buff. They are still vulnerable after they jump until they cloak and their cyno is scannable until it goes down and cyno either warps or cloaks (not much but more vulnerable than jumping to dock in a citadel, and if someone is being lazy and jumping multiple to the same cyno they could land too close to each other to immediately cloak). The jf would also be vulnerable when warping. With no prop, can’t mwd warp so wouldn’t really change anything in hs. Really just eliminates citadel spam and allows smaller groups to run jf routes without a blue swath of space. No need for an entirely new black ops support ship. As awesome as it might seem to be.

I'm not really in the loop on eve I just cam back a little a few days ago (no not because of blackout I had no idea that was a thing), so can someone explain to me why I see so many crying over and over about "too many players in highsec" or something like that, with plans for how to force them to lowsec or null? Is null really that devoid of this ever illusive "content" people speak of? And apart from anything else, why are people not allowed to enjoy highsec content? Is "content" defined as something that can only really exist in low or null?
---
Actually, for T2, especially rigs, merging multiple of them would have a big impact on ME you can achieve.
---
Did you not see what they did to their own server? Is there a reason not to be hostile to them?

Ah cool. Thank you.

that's a fine position to take, but once you take it you can't really disagree that frat is being blobbed.

if they really call for ctas this much then yeah its an issue, but its hardly a relevant one in the current situation.

&gt; The supposition that marginally inferior or even equal numbers = you will welp is incredible blobthink.

not even blobthink, just badthink. Imagine having the idea of being garbage at the game so ingrained in your mind that the thought of a slightly smaller number or even equal numbers leads to an invevitable welp, and against fucking frat which aren't any elite fighting force either in general
---
this whole thread is so bizarre
---
The record was set by theory-crafting an all-purple Bustard in a wormhole with bonus to shield (is that even still a thing?).
---
Not practical at all, though using mids is faster to align or accelerate than when armored.
---
I do like the Amarr line, because largely of the Prorator BR.  The Gallente BR is very similar, but Gallente have an entire line of specialized Industrials that benefit from training Gallente Industrial 5 (racial level 5 being a prerequisite of DST and BR).
---
Of course, I have enough SP (around 200m or more on even my alts) to use them all, and I tend to prefer Caldari industrials, since they tend to have more cargo for the same HP, but at the expense of flexibility, speed, agility, and even jump fuel consumption.
---
You really can't go wrong with any race, and everyone eventually needs to use industrials to move something!
---
look at how much plex costs in irl money, look how much one skin costs.
---
then do the math vs almost any other MMO on the market that sells cosmetics - or just look no further than the other obvious space MMO competitor that has actually been released (that's elite dangerous), because their skin prices are almost free when lined up against eve's offensive cash grab.
---
Why would that astra be fit with an anticap and  a multirole launcher? I'm no master structure fitter, but I don't think that's right. Especially without anticap neuts, the DPS would be too low to ever break any cap/supercap. And without a web, wouldn't the structure have application problems to subcaps? And without a third jam, wouldn't the structure have issues breaking basically any fleet  comps capchains? 
---
Not to mention that the astra didn't get on that Moros killmail, so it wasn't even being broadcasted capital targets, or wasn't manned when the shit went down.

damn.

---
Nothing really matters if the game is financially successful. That's the begging and end of the business discussion. Health is not as much of a concern as say, leaving with twice as many millions.
---
That being said expect a lot of sales to reach the financial goals and a lot of events to meet login quota - but don't expect decisions to be made (now of all times) for the health of the game - they're for the success of the deal.
---
Right after they give us some sort of BPC / BPO for Command Centers, faction ammo, most items in the loyalty stores... etc

He wants other killboards:

Of course we suspect its all bullshit just like free intel.

They took on all of New Eden simultaneously.  It was a touch uphill for them, and while the outcome surprised nobody, if they had been successful, it would have been quite the tale...

Join a big alliance - GOONS, TEST, etc and ask supers/titans that are ratting if you can loot/salvage after them. Can easily make 100m an hour

We were gone a good week or two before goons started taking sov back/killing structures due to QFC drying up. We more or less completely evicted SMA and were preparing to kill the rest of querious (that was already on the verge of internal collapse) before we got bored due to the entire region being terrified of us and decided to purge the motherland for content. I have no idea why more people haven't gone to querious to take sov I cannot believe how bad the alliances there were. It was full on twilight zone levels of bad.
---
Would it be possible to get colorblind mode where losses and kills are not on dark red/green background? Makes it hard to see if player feeds/kills at a quick glance.

And I thought my posting was bad.

This isn't really the same thing. Skill injecting retards isn't a broken/exploitable game mechanic. It hurts the people who do it since they almost always make bad mistakes and feed supers.

May be goin against the circlejerk here but i'd love a mobile game so i could do some EVE stuff while at work. Dont care for it being a seperate game/universe tho, but being able to do PI or even some dumb Clash of Clans-esque city/colony builder and it benefiting my chars would be amazing.

OK... so where's Uncle Brock in all this?

Jump around all night with your spess frens!

It is a nice cartoon.

One alliance/coalition tool over all null and low sec and basically high by ganking everything. My assumption is once they establish as there are groups on all sides here and build up supers we will see them at some point leave those and form one massive Chinese based group and start trying atleast to take over tq.

You can afford to buy 600 dreads outright and then say you arent rich? Lol

Don't do your due diligence and pay your dues. Here's a fun fact about scouting tho, you don't have to multibox to do it you could have a friend do it.

Or so they claim. If they actually followed the Jedi Code they wouldn’t have started any of this nonsense.

he got outplayed. There are no two ways about it. His salt is just as valid as the salt of the miners he ganks.

Yeah itd make sensecto have a friend do it, if there wasnt 99 shitbags for every decent person in this game, making it impossible to enjoy corp life
---
They wardecced everybody. Not at war with everybody. ANd the every body they wardecced doesn't even has to make sence apparently. They wardecced SNUFF. Even PIRAT don't really do that - we can't even go to high sec! Wanna shoot SNUFF -  gotta take that low-sec gate. Apparently not an issue for these clowns. Everyone gets a wardec =\]

not true, several frigates run crewless too

Why would you ever need to do that? Just wait for them to wardec you?

Also what happened to Cousin Ross? Last seen getting drunk in the White House, but tripped over some candles getting to a racing meet. Or something.
---
Lmao thats dopeee
---
I just came back to the game. What is blackout? How does "the invasion" work?
---
So, I don't currently play this game BUT I love the dynamics and politics between the individual groups. Is there a Youtube channel or blog I can follow to keep up with the politics and stories everyone loves? I already listened to Empires of Eve as an audiobook.
---
You've got great advice so far, but I wanted to mention one other thing:
---
Don't try to game with a laptop if you're just transitioning to PC gaming.  Almost all laptops aren't optimized for it.  Most laptop makers are more concerned about things like battery life and weight than all-out performance.
---
Actual gaming laptops do exist, but you will need to be buying one of the higher-priced ones to get sufficient performance on most modern games.
---
Eve runs on moderately-priced toaster ovens, so there's going to be plenty of people who do play this game on a "regular" laptop, but if you're trying to get a gaming rig for more than Eve you're going to want a desktop or spend a lot (and be very careful) with purchasing a laptop.
---
heh, I've been fighting this war on test's side since the beginning when pgl was actively around and leading the campaign and afterwards when vily took over and focused more on what dks and predds were doing and followed their example of doing things in detorid but sure. 
---
it's obvious you know better.
---
if you want to focus on the stupid excuses for a war, it's up to you. reasons and excuses don't matter. All that matters is that a war, however interesting or not it is, is actually happening.
---

---
Every single one has been destroyed? Wow, that’s a bummer.
---
7?... as in fine to watch if you are 8?..
---
&gt;Heat map reworked to be more understandable and usable.
---
Would you be able to look at how the colour scale is applied to the heat map?  The current scale works for 99% of EVE, but things get messy when looking at wormhole corporations and alliances, as evictions can throw the figures out of whack.
---
Due to the of the lack of asset safety in w-space, structures drop all their contents upon destruction.  This often leads to hundreds of empty ships being killed in the space of a couple of hours.  Because of the way the colour scale assigns the five shades of red, these few hours of many kills can cause the majority of the heat map to be shaded in the same colour, making the heat maps pretty much useless. 
---
Here's an imgur album of six groups; three k-space, three w-space: https://imgur.com/a/eJVIHRB
---
For the three k-space groups--The Initiative., Honorable Third Party, and Iron Crown--it is pretty clear when they're most active, both from the small heat map on the main page, and from the detailed view with all the numbers shown.
---
But, looking at the three w-space groups--Hard Knocks Citizens, No Vacancies, and The Dark Space Initiative--its impossible to tell when they're active due to recent evictions without opening the detailed view and studying the numbers.  NOVAC and HKRAB have only three levels of colour graduation, while TDSIN have only four.  Here are how the colour grades are seemingly applied: *range (frequency)*
---
 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
---
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|
---
HKRAB | 0 (2) | 2-147 (161) | 172-255 (4) | | | 763 (1) |
---
NOVAC | 0 (14) | 1-40 (143) | 42-79 (10) | | |205 (1) |
---
TDSIN | 0 (10) | 1-61 (143) | 63-107 (12) | 126-161 (2) | | 308 (1)
---
INIT. | 0 (0) | 1-215 (101) | 228-436 (42) | 448-619 (17) | 658-773 (6) | 931-1099 (2)
---
Rather than just dumping a complaint on you without making any suggestions, here are two ideas I'd like to propose:
---
1. Detect and eliminate hours with an a large number of kills, treat them as an anomaly, and eliminate them from the linear scale;  
---
2. Provide visitors to the site the option to toggle between a linear and logarithmic scale.
---
Obviously, each option has it's issues.  Finding a way to eliminate excessively high figures from the scale could result in legitimate activity being discounted as an anomalous, and applying a logarithmic scale would result in low activity levels being shaded darker than usual, exaggerating the level of activity.
---
So, using the six example groups above, here are a pair of albums showing:
---
* Linear Scale (current)  
---
* Linear Scale, eliminating values greater than the average value + standard deviation x4  
---
* Logarithmic Scale
---
, for both the small preview and full detailed views, created in Excel.

Thoughts?
---
So what would a large multiplayer battles on distributed computing look like?  Could we have more players on grid in battles and less issues like TIDI in multi-thread programming optimized for the Summit  supercomputer?
---
Gameplay that messes with the larger picture should never be allowed. Thats just bad for business.
---
10% is so much better though
---
Netease screwed Blizz on WoW china years ago... how many companies can do that? Now they have the serenity server, right?
---
CCP is stuck with them now (as in never end a contract with them, ever), so why not dig down 6 feet?
---
On the converse, hopefully they will think to expand back and redo Dust, but without the shooter part.
---
Considering that TEST has its own reddit shit-post fleet those upvotes are quite interesting
---
Honestly I don't care if it's a feature or bug, I'm having soo much fun hunting through null  :)
---
If it's really just a text change, would have to know their system. Even slight changes get super expensive once a software project grows big.
---
When is Eve 2 multi-threaded version?
---
holy shit lol
---
Honestly, I wonder why they didn’t do this from the beginning. It just seems so much simpler than what they went with.
---
I mean I dont disagree that killing Procs in high sec systems is hard and not worth it. But Im fairly certain the guy was just presenting an example.
---
You cant say this about retrievers in 0.6 systems tho which makes it meh.
---
fuck romanian legion...old happy cartel...and yes for english speakers talk to good sax...tough mostly are us tz

Oh yes please, suggest me a good Eve app, something like Evedroid, but you know, that doesn't crash every 3 goddamn seconds.

Eve 2012
---
that wasn't actually something code did, that was just intigo and co memeing as usual

they expressed clearly on multiple occations that they dont intent to do this idiot idea so..  
---
ofcause they proved latley that they gladly go back on their word aswell..  
---
game on?
---
What is bumping, specifically in mining?
---
There was a comment on a thread a while ago about why multi-threading the server side of things isn't really a viable idea. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7shyp7/ccp_falcon_explains_how_eve_online_nodes_work/dt55189/
---
It’s been asked before, and CCP’s response has always been a definite “no”. From what I can tell there are a lot of players who agree with you and a lot of players who *strongly* disagree. (I don’t really have an opinion on it myself, TBH.)
---
Nice vid, again.
---
Against most frigs it's usually safest to start the fight with the Null loaded. 350 dps from 0 to 6 kms, 250 dps at 10 kms is more than enough to handle most frigates and you won't waste time switching ammo.
---
No.
---
Ideally I'd be able to rorq mine to make isk but in a pockett of space inaccessible to normy Eve as it wouldn't be fair to get dropped while I'm on my phone.
---
You get Classic EVE by fixing all the stupid bandaid features and taking the game back to a sustainable ecosystem. A new server is not going to work, it will just be a rerun in fastforward of Serenity server, and the current "elite players" will completely win the landrush.
---
Why is it an idiot idea? It's only a bad idea if people don't want it. And there's plenty of people that do want it
---
You know it used to be 30 sec right?
---
Something that allows me to swap my skills around, mess around in the fit simulator and respond to eve mails including a forward feature would be quite nice.
---
And if they were normal players I'd agree, but they get so focused into the game they make the insane Russians seem like casuals.
---
That's what I was referring to
---
xD so random roflmao
---
It's more that people hide in highsec and never really take risks. I understand enjoying a pve life style but if you can fund an empire without the risk of low and null sec then it's a smidge un balanced. Why should anyone leave highsec except for pvp if you can just multi box 30 orcas and get null sec rich without even a fraction of the risk that null seccers take.
---
I thought the frigates all needed 1-3 people
---
CCP released an official app, it failed horribly.
---
For Android use Evanova, for iOS I've heard Neocom is the best there is.
---
I love anytime I hear bad things happen to hull pen.
---
&gt;  It's only a bad idea if people don't want it.
---
That's not really true. Just because people want something doesn't mean it's a good idea. "Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it".
---
I'll bring the lube, you bring the chicharrones
---
No, fuck off.
---
yeah!
---
YES PLEASE... Even a few seconds down, or 5 second timer... Or ability to que commands would be amazing... I have 3-4 clones in main system I'm in for my 7+ characters  that I swap between constantly, +5 training clone, empty, asklepians, Geno's, slaves, ascendencys.. it is so tedious at. Times I just give up lol... The amount of times I warp into a fight as the last pod is dying or as everyone runs because I was in session change/pod warping hell for 5 mins gets really old.
---
It's probably the thing I think about more then anything else in Eve at this point...the process of getting the 2-3 pilots I'll be using into the right clone and ship as quick as possible, then as they approach the fight clone swapping the 2-3 standby guys.... And no I can't just use an empty clone I'm far too much of a snowflake for that
---
"Hey could you just remove any reason to trust you"
---
An app that lets us check the regional market and place orders based on where our toon is currently at. I would like to do some market pvp from my phone.
---
It’s harder with the new race as a new player without max skills
---
Yeah, I think anything they release would realisticly have to make CCP a little money, at least enough to pay for its upkeep. Otherwise, I would expect it to fail basically no matter what.
---
 Question is: can that be done with good mechanics as opposed to scummy ones?
---
Currently, if I want to learn a good (solo) fit for 'x', I find somebody who has lots of solo kills while flying ship 'x', then I look at his losses and pick the ones where he was flying 'x'. This is tedious. It would help a lot if, while looking at his solo kills and lossmails I could filter by what ship was he flying.
---
Have a downvote
---
Teach him how to dive into wormholes in a T1 Heron. The payout can be pretty awesome, and the constant paranoia is great for keeping things exciting.
---
just hull pen things
---
Make him learn the basicas by doing the tutorial and career agents while you talk to him about all that is possible in the game; make him sell all he got doing that and fit the best possible PVP fitted ship he can fly and afford.
---
Then take him on a two man fleet to the first lowsec system you find, fleet warp him to a belt and awox him. Bonus points if you get a corpmate to wait him in a Rook aswell.
---
After poding him and laughing your ass off give him ten times more than he spent on the ship (not more, let him learn how to get isk by himself) and send him on his way to do whatever he wants and get used to the game alone for a while.
---
If he stays get him into your corp, if he doesn't this game isn't for him.
---
Okay, that's enough Reddit for today.
---
I present the idea that all of the movers and shakers in-universe and at CCP are *terrified* of what would result from combining of Caldari’s obsession with quality and whatever fell sorcery allows Minmatar ships to be so incredibly effective. Such beasts would surely be far too powerful for anyone to control, even the capsuleers...
---
it'll be so shit and overly micro-transaction focused even he won't want to play.
---

---
Seriously doubt it.
---
"set in an alternate universe"   
---
makes it sound like zero crossover to the current game.
---
Someone fetch me the eye fork!
---
Eve Mobile that was a small subset of actual Eve that you could use on your phone would be really nice. That's not what Echoes is, it's completely detached from Eve.
---
I've never felt second hand embarrassment as hard in my life as when I watched that reveal.
---
If everyone you meet seems like a shitbag you should probably stop and take a look in the mirror. Because i would say that only about 30% of the people i've met seem like shit bags.
---
The only real downside to having a second server that was starting from Day 1 would be pulling population away from a dwindling TQ population.
---
I am a new player (actually the game is downloading right now) and I'm looking for friends
---
Fun?
---
I love warm holes
---
^this
---
Praxis all day.
---
You can fit more tank to throw off gankers math with the 7/7/7 layout on top of it being ridiculously cheap as far as battleships go.
---
 Oh and it has the three rig slots so you can throw a Higgs to stop bumping and still have some options.  Also DRONES
---
I'm down.
---
My bet is on "Login using Facebook" feature, Facebook SSO is suprisingly popular and requires covering it as an option in EULA.
---
Shhhhhhhh not everyone needs to know..
---
Bruh
---
Well, that's Eve for you.
---
you need a wormhole id system. i like http://anoik.is/ you put the J code of the system name into it and it will tell you what kind of static connections it has and what class it is. 
---
Only C1 C2 and C3 wormholes have relic and data sites you could run in a T1 exploration ship. And knowing what the statics are will help you navigate to avoid wormholes that lead places that you won't find what you are looking for in.
---
And yeah exploration is like that. You gotta move fast to stay alive.
---
You are free to think so. Is it funny? Yes. Did he get “outplayed”? Sure. Doesn’t really seem like a lot of salt is all I’m saying. He mildly expressed his disappointment about being stream sniped. 🤷‍♂️
---
nope. you'd kill eve.
---
This is a known feature. Embrace it
---
That is actually a serious issue. The game needs a certain population to function properly, and splitting the player population from one server to another could kill one or both of the servers.
---
Hell yeah i loved not being able to see gate pings on the overview so i had absolutely no way of knowing if that dude 200 off was close to my ping or 100 off
---
That is why I am much  more in favor of EVE '2' so that they can fix the gameplay  issues and add/remove 'features' that plague the game. Creating a sequel would give the game design freedom to manipulate whatever is needed.
---
Although this is true, if you spend long enough station trading it feels like work and you might as well do actual work and PLEX with real money.
---
Haha yeah this happened to me the other day.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Make PI a mobile game similar to Factorio but well for mobile and desktop.
---
No they gave them to goons....
---
The good thing about classic releases like Runescape has done is not only releasing the game when it was at its best but putting in the small QOL changes to make it better without major gameplay changes.
---
It's not a lot of salt no. But any amount of salt extracted from people proud to be those who shoot at people who can't shoot them back is worth its weight in gold to me.
---
Choices have consequences. If you choose to do things before having learned how to do them, the consequence will be that it hurts.
---
If you don't like the consequences of your choices, make different choices.
---
I squeeze out 252 injectors per month. Extractors lately have been better priced off the market for isk and not in jita or perimeter. Some startup market a few jumps away.
---
This person probably bought those ever so slightly cheaper extractors then decided to move the injectors after the farming cycle in bulk to better markets.
---
Not the rest of your life, just until you figure out the game. I like to use WoW as an example. You couldn't start playing today and enter a max level raid by next week. The difference in Eve is that the max level stuff isn't gated, so anyone can wander in and get killed. You have to stick to the relatively safe areas until you get the confidence and skills to enter the more dangerous areas. And if it's isk you're after. Big isk requires big risk,  so just be happy making small amounts and fly cheap ships. I started and quit the game twice before I came to this realization and have enjoyed playing ever since.
---
my first 20mins of eve was me carefully choosing what to skill into with sp from ccp, and then i undocked from jita and shot a 3b hg pod! #fun
---
My you are an adventurous one! 3 days old and already dead in every kind of space!
---
It sounds like you have the right approach... you even know about dscan. Did you [unfuck your overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview_Guide)? That might help some.
---
I suggest you keep whacking at the nullsec exploration and relic sites. They'll be hard to crack until you get some scanning and hacking skills trained up but I think they're the biggest payoff for someone in your position.
---
Did you get to null by scanning a WH connection from high-sec, or did you go via gates? Wormholes are a safer way to get there. [Here's how to know where one leads](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes#Wormhole_Text). 
---
If you want better safety outside high-sec as a noob, it helps to be in a (not-sucky) player corp.
---
Pretty much. But yeah, I personally would totally love to change BPCs and allow merging them (or some similar mechanic). There are different ways on how this could be done (potentially even moving blueprints out of the inventory system), but it would require quite a bit of code refactoring, so it would take an extensive amount of programmer time - and programmer time is needed for many different projects. While it would probably improve server performance (and especially DB performance) in the long run, we would also need to be careful about the performance impact of the process of merging 1000 BPCs into one BPC.
---
o/ hey, EVE can be very frustrating for beginners, I ragequit 1 week into the game but gave it another shot a few weeks later.
---
I made the mistake of trying to do shit completely on my own, I had some fun but overall it was very frustrating. I would suggest you go join some newbie alliances channels and ask about their recruitment or join faction warfare and a beginner player corporation there, It's what I did and learning how to pvp by welping a shitton of rifters was fun. 
---
Being in a corporation where you aren't just a number and have some nice people to play with will increase the fun factor by 1000%
---
Hope I was able to help and good luck out there o7
---
Does it hurt?
---
Deep ones.
---
I'm referring largely to noraus, the leader of frt, who publicly declared a foreverwar to evict test, invited everyone possible, and botted up a Titan fleet to try and follow through. I'm sorry about your post, though. Would you like it to have an open casket or closed?
---
thanks for covering for me
---
Get him on the right-hand pane of a killmail.
---
Shitbag might be a strong word, but either completely uninterested in others or actively antagonistic describes 80% of the people I've ever met in eve. The other 20 percent is a mix of decent people, people who know nothing and hurt more than they help, and brand new folks who are fun to help out.
---
I find it weird when people glorify "the good old days" before jump fatigue or other shit. Dunno. EVE seems pretty good, been in a number of fleet fights recently where supers and titans did not at all dominate it all or ruin fleet warfare. The FAX changes made it far riskier to just spam them at a fight. Honestly been having huge fun with Horde and glad i joined up. Would say no to ever seeing an "eve classic" or "eve 2" as it just doesn't work. EVE classic would be instantly won by goons through sheer numbers anyway and would be far far worse than any situation on TQ. Quite apart from "oh you want a new server? For PVP? okay well good luck doing that when the industrialists would have no motivation to jump"
---
The thing that struck me was the look on the Blizzard guys face just before the 'Do you not have phones' line, like he truly didnt understand why people werent happy.

He knows, and said that in the post.

Lets hope that CCP adds in a delay to their API back-end thus making them the "bad guys" I thought the delay was great, way to much easy intel in this game. I think CCP should put Highsec @ instant reporting, Lowsec @ on an hour delay and Highsec @ 2 hour delay. As that would make more "lore" sense.

the best part is everyone uses that fit
---
He was probably going to drop it at a safe spot, and then got ganked
---
what this guy said pretty much just take lvl 1 security missions till you understand the game better. Try to avoid low sec and null sec. Or try your hand at mining or something slow you might like it. Try being a space trader go buy something and sell it somewhere else
---
then you should know that Noraus broke the terms of the NIP for litteral months with small stuff like refusing to remove FRT structures from 46dp, cloaky camping, letting SkillUrself stage a invasion of Immensea/Tenerifis from FRT structures... you know, just to mention a few things. that TEST in the end said "enough of this shit" is only logical, the only reason it wasent done sooner was because they were busy setting up their peremiter trading post
---
Oh bravo dude - 10/10...
---
And as a Medieval Re-enactor, jesus h fucking christ, that armour... Faaaaaaarck.....
---
Highsec incursions
---
I have zero confidence that CCP knows what's a good feature and what's not, then they'll port all the shit features into EVE 2 and the game with suck.

some of this is not entirely accurate:
---
-DHSJ drops 1 fax
---
-we dropped two faxes at the start of the fight
---
-guardian reps were more than enough to hold your subcap fleet
---
-you then dropped a couple dreads
---
-faxes were holding fine, subcaps were holding fine
---
-you then dropped more dreads
---
-hull pen then committed their dreads
---
-you then proceeded to drop the rest of the dreads you had.
---
10/10 would get baited again.
---
Except in the relatively selfish areas you are going to be ganked by some dude on an illogical quest to kill botters who shoots first and doesnt bother asking questions. Dont worry though, the police will get revenge for you but not until after you are thoroughly dead. Dont bother with hauling either. It sucks. You will also be called a krabber for a while until you figure out it's just best to skip high sec and low sec all together and join a bigger group in nullsec.
---
I think like 3 and a half people in the world do.
---
"Let's split the already small player base in half"
---
Yes that does sound like an unfortunate first few days, and you’ve explained it pretty much how I felt my first few days went. Just when you think you get somewhere, you’re dead with no idea why.
---
So, take a step back from everything you’ve done so far. As someone else pointed out, you’ve already been in every sort of space and that doesn’t seem right, although somewhat brave, and your choice.
---
Eve isn’t a game where you just jump in a ship and go and you can compete with everyone. It’s a slow burn game. If I were you, I would try and get some stability in your gameplay. Probably sounds a bit boring, but given there is soooooo much to learn, you need to narrow your focus down and get used to what your doing a bit more.
---
Exploration you mentioned ... try only staying in high sec and scanning down data/relic sites in high sec first of all. Practice those things like not warping to a gate at 0, but instead make bookmarks 100km out, 200kms out, 700kms out, 1000kms above (etc) gates that you regularly travel. Base yourself somewhere and get to know the systems, the people who live there and travel through there. After a while (1 week, 2 weeks?) you’ll start to feel a bit more comfortable with the area, so venture a little further into low sec and try the same.
---
Or join a Faction Warfare group and get involved in plex battles ... safer in a group, pick up tips, get a comfort zone. 
---
Or meet some miners ...
---
Or look for an industrial corp if you prefer building and creating ...
---
But whatever you do, try doing it and sticking with it until you feel you’re starting to get the hang of it a bit more. I think part of your problem is you’re jumping into so many things and the mechanics around them are so different that you’re soon out of your depth, making a mistake, easy prey for someone and then you find yourself right back at the start with -1 ship and less isk.
---
That’s not a criticism, that’s just what I see from what you’ve written.
---
I can suggest Malevelon Roe Industries (MALRO) - they are a high/low sec mission running corp based in Pemene. They’re a great bunch and helpful and would be a good place to go to get some stability. Drop by their Discord:
---
You sound like 90% us did when we were new. Stick with it and you'll adjust. It is not forgiving in any way.

You have that backwards it's frat members that aren't allowed into mango space, mango roam frat space freely (the last I heard).

We also really love amazing grammar and excessive-But-not-Really hyphens and random capitalizations.
---
Nah they dont touch each other out of respect. The only time they fight is if frat touches legacy space or anchors a structure. Then mangos and frat agree to shoot each other. And the structure has to be in legacy space. So no offensice ihubs takes can be done by mangos
---
So, multi threaded stuff allows tasks to run in parallel. That is, while I’m over here calculating 5+5, I can ask you to calculate 2+2 and we can work independently then when we’re done we have the answer in half the time. Single threaded happens sequentially, so I have to finish my calculation before you can start. 
---
The cons is that, in the event data relies on something from another thread, if not properly protected you can get bad values, crashes, etc through what are called race conditions

you people are so hang up on the narratives that you don't seem to understand that what I am trying to say is that they don't matter. 
---
You say that noraus broke the NIP and you use certain facts to support that. I can say that according to one of the narratives, this second war between frat and test started because fire coalition said they wanted to evict frat and test joined the fight because xix are their friends and frat is their enemy.
---
Not to mention that according to Vily (parapheasing here) "xix is not part of the nip but they can be"
---
See? There are multiple excuses to justify a war and you can choose to believe whichever one you find correct. That doesn't mean it's the same for everyone nor that it matters in the end.

Why would a multithreaded eve server and/or client be bad/improbable

Yeah that’s the biggest issue tbh. I found dominion sov much more engaging then the current system even with SBUs and TCUs.
---
It will never happen. There are players that have 15 years in to Eve that won't be happy at all taking a backseat to a new game or starting over.  The whole idea behind Eve is that it is a perpetual universe. Launching a sequel and throwing out the last 15 years will drive away a large portion of the veteran fanbase and isn't guaranteed to bring in the number of new players to make it successful. They're going to ride this one until the wheels fall off.  It's the safer play.

Was thinking more like something along the lines of the hacking mini game but with a low average payout. If CCP gave me a way to make half a million isk on my lunch break I feel like I might do it.
---
zing!
---
I would happily trade in my in game assets for an updated eve and I know quite a few other prominent players agree with me. 
---
All the other games CCP have attempted have failed spectacularly so I would like to see them at least attempt to ‘fix/reinvigorate’ their one successful Game.
---
There is a good reason that that trailer had no game play
---
Does EVE have gameplay?!
---
Fuck off.
---
Why did they put it back.  They did remove the session change especially when swapping ships
---
Archeage does their releases with gated content where you can’t access certain areas until ‘x’ amount of time has past or ‘x’ has been completed. Which seeing half of nullsec closed and forcing everyone to contest the available space/limited resources would be a welcome sight.
---
I completely understand your way of thinking. I expected somewhat the same. Except now I know there is a difference from station invul and cloak timer.
---
That depends
---
I find it quite amusing (suprisingly) and I make about 1.5b per day with around 90minutes invested (That was before the tax change, I am currently away from my main rig and can't do my full scale trading)

Ya, I don't think people understand just how multicultural Britain is, remember when India was ruled by England? Yep, Indian people could move to England lol, same with all those islands in the Carib. The government may largely be old rich white people, but that doesn't reflect the populace overly much.
---
That's what I said
---
Its harder when you start as a coplate alpha, with no money, of course (I started as an alpha with the last 271mil I had, now about 8 months later I make 1.5b per day with 2 accounts plexed in-game)
---
But since he has 8b (had, not sure about the current state of his wallet) he would only have to put up 15 bucks to afford the first month of omega. He could also just start trading with the 17 orders an alpha gets, but it takes time and skill to manage with such a little amount of orders

Glad to hear it. Liking all the ccp activity on reddit lately.

There is an active solo pvp channel on the r/eve discord
---
nha don't worry, you just learning the ropes. Some advices here :
---
- https://www.dualshockers.com/eve-online-a-newbie-friendly-guide-to-ninja-salvaging/  I like to give that links to newbros, it's a great training on how to use DSCAN, gives decent isk to begin and can yield a fair amount of salt . You can also try ninja looting from ppl running DED sites that way (loot the commander wrecks, you'll figure it out)
---
- with the blackout, you should explore in WH rather than null. Risks are the same, rewards better. Do'nt forget to bookmark the WH exit before moving
---
- if exploring, yes, you should spend 95% of your time running and DSCANing :d When you get more isk AND experience, you can move to an astero and start hunter T1 explorer (beware of the combat heron though, this is no joke)
---
- yes, get use to travel A LOT
---
- always double check EVERYTHING when trading, accepting contract, talking to people etc ... Scamming is a legit form of PVP allowed by the dev, just as suicide ganking
---
- and most importantly: do not fly what you cannot afford to replace
---
"We are gamers, too!"
---
I was really sad to see it go, admittedly by that time I was already pretty far into my first round of Eve burnout.
---
Never bothered to follow up on why they stopped pursuing it, do you know?
---
Let’s go deeeeep into the warmhole
---
Yes. Leshaks are used for WH PvE. I dont think they are good for combat anoms in known space though. The assault frigate Nergal should be good for burner missions. Otherwise they shouldn't be especially good for missioning.
---
Much as I'm loathed to admit it... that's a really nice logo they have.
---
Meh, doing pve doesn't prepare you for pvp at all. It's nothing more than earning small isk in a reliable way. The only way to learn pvp is to do pvp.
---
If you want to explore anomalies you don't need to be good at pvp, especially skillpoints-wise. You only need to learn how to avoid getting killed. OP here for example should have seen the scanner probes on his dscan. Once they were there it was obvious someone was trying to either find that site or him, depending on which probes it was. He didn't even need to warp off. He said he had a cloak. All he had to do was cloak up and see what the other guy does. If it's a pvper chances are he can't steal the hacking containers.
---
Nah. But it differs so much from other games that  new players should be explicitly informed as part of the NPE. Maybe when leaving their starter system?
---
I'll take parity for 500 alec
---
But you can buy PLEX with ISK and then skins with the PLEX. No real currency needed.
---
Are u still making constant profit now? With the new tax’s? I was thinking about makin a station trading alt for jita or something
---
Yes CCP needs to diversify into the mobile market, with an eve game. Oh wait. Kind of like they diversified into the VR world, with an eve game. Could be a pattern here.

Its where other ships (usually people who are attempting to annoy or extort) will repeatedly bump into your ship. Ships have collision detection in eve and it will move the ship, which can bump them out of mining range.  It is generally done in high sec where the aggressor cannot outright attack the miner
---
It was very grindy and heavily supported big blob were my problems with it.  But I did like that you could rep the stations and what not, I thought that was some nice unique gameplay we lost.  I like entosis sov honestly, I thin kit achieves all the objectives set for it, it's just odd is all in the space setting I think  (well I like it after it got tweaked alot.).
---
Bumping refers to flying your ship into another ship to make that other ship move. In the context of mining that is used by highsec gankers to prevent a target to fully align and therefore the target can't warp off. Outside of highsec a ganker would just use a warp disruptor or scram but in highsec concord would kill them for that. They wait to properly agress their target until they have enough DPS on grid to kill the target faster than concord reacts.
---
So an isk-sink for normal players and a cash-grab as far as stupid players are concerned?
---
No it's not worth it as you'd have to make a direct deal, one guy escorting won't help anything especially in lowsec where I live, and a hauler with minimal so who actually reads up on hauling and how to do it should never need escort.
---
Try faction warfare; maybe even join a faction warfare corp... most give out free cheapo ships to newbies to pvp... (most nullsec do that too but FW can be a shooting gallery) and go around running "plex's" and pew pewing... don't sweat it if u get killed... use cheap stuff... PVP, learn the ropes, and make some decent isk for a new player.
---
Asking what something would 'look like' is a largely meaningless question. Think of it like a movie with a director: the director says 'this is what I want it to look like.' And the rest of the cast and crew have the job of *making it happen*. 
---
So, ideally, it would look like a large battle on a single thread, except run smoothly under every possible layout of ships, bullets, and explosions. 
---
What does Eve's 'director' want things to look like? That's the gameplay team, and a few Product Managers. Ask them.
---
Sure you can do that, although just scouting the hauler, ie staying 1 jump ahead and making sure there is nobody and no bubbles near gates, would be safer, because most likely filthy pirates will make you watch as they slap the hauler right in the titties, and then blow you.
---
I read that as pastebin and was disappointed when it didn't say ur gay pwnd
---
tl;dr killright baiting with the hauler but the fighter duels the hauler and warp disrupts it to make it more appealing
---
1. get a killright on the hauler, make it public for a nice sum but not too high.
---
2. undock the insured empty hauler and warp to perimeter gate, jump.
---
3. fighter waits the hauler and duels him in perimeter, then as the hauler uncloaks, the fighter starts to warp disrupt him (it shows up as combat message to everyone on grid). hauler can also start drifting off from the gate towards urlen.
---
4. wait for someone to buy the killright, then repeat in amarr.
---
5. optional: try to escape.
---
I miss his firm hand
---
Be the change you want to see. That's what i do, instead of multiboxing a dozen accounts i always ask people around me to do stuff. It's been working out pretty well. 
---
The only thing you need to remember tho: time is money. People will be a lot less interested in dropping what they are doing to help you if they don't think you will help them back later or if they are losing money by helping you.

Meh Pirat also sits on stations so there's enough "elite" pvp for both of them.
---
Yes.  You will need to spend your time running from people that hunt new players
---
Yes, many veterans do literally nothing but hunt for easy kills, and a new player like yourself is the prime target they will spend every logged in moment hunting.  
---

My issue with entosis sov is it doesn't promote fights or engagements. Two large fleets sit either side of a gate while entosis ships fly around wanding nodes. I think the best time in sov was when they nerfed the EHP of SBUS and TCUS for a bit before entosis came out.

At least in dominion more fights happened.

that was kind of you to take the time to explain all that... I've been playing for about 7 years on and off, and can relate to OP and to your willingness to help the noob. But the difficulty of the learning curve and the processes of achieving an understanding of the constant learning curve is what makes Eve Online such an amazing game. Yep, it fucking hurts sometimes, and especially so for new players. But this hurt along with mastering the tremendous complexities of almost every single iota of Eve is what's the most addictive part of Eve.

Hi o/
---
Just exploded a 4 days old imicus this morning in a C3, maybe it was you.
---
I sent 5m and tried to convo to explain the mistakes, but no answer:(
---
From my pov, helios doing a data in a C3:
---
Finished probing the system and started to do one of the only 2 sites. 
---
See an imicus on d-scan, so imicus see me too.
---
He start probing, I approach a combat character to this hole, things look fishy.
---
After finishing my site, warp cloaked to the next one, imicus land soon after, he is 10km away, jump in inty, destroy the ship, tackle the pod, see 4 days old, let him go, do the site, go back home.
---
The mistakes: 
---
-trying to do a site in a wormhole while someone was already doing it
---
-not using enough d-scan, took me more than 10s to jump in, land and scram (my second solo kill, used to play logi)
---
As a new player, remember that every active player in wh will kill you on sight, not because you are a newbie, but because you can be a threat...
---
Ps: farmed 150m isk in an hour, you can get isk really fast doing that, one successful run and you can pay as much imicus as you want:)

I guess that it one way to think of it. I would not say stupid. People all play different and feel differently about video games. I personally feel that micro transactions are ruining the industry. So PLEX dropping and reducing the desire to buy with real money is good in my eyes. But companies are making money hand over fist with micro transactions so I guess I am a dying breed of gamer.
---
You forget: its blobbing if you bring just one more ship than your opponent does to grid.

Ever noticed that the movie poster for [The 300](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/300poster.jpg) is a lot like the Eve learning curve.
---
U buy and sell ships or what just some of everything with good margins?
---
I am kinda puzzled now Darkness has managed to stick around for so long
---
Entosis ships are so cheap and guarding every entosis ship is such a drain on man-hours that usually they are left alone and replaced if they die. Then even when you lose sov you don't lose that much strategic use because citadels are durable even without sov in system. 
---
In order to encourage fights Entosis ships have to cost enough to be worth guarding rather than throwing a new one on every so often. You could also have Entosis effectiveness ramp over time so holding grid is rewarded with faster progress over kill and replace.

too small. use bigger font

I'll do It but that doesnt answer my questions :(
---
Is it in yet pin dick?
---
Oh boy how far into development will this get before it gets cancelled?
---
Generally items that I trade (doing low volume, high margin things) have to meet some prerequisites...
---
More than 8m profit (this filters out most of the high him a things that need a lot of attention)
---
A margin higher than 18% (ensuring that I still have a good profit, the margin is calculated by the evernus margin tool and the "18%" is after taxes)
---
More than 1 item moved on average per day (this rules out all the super rare stuff that simply doesn't move)
---
I will not give specifics to items I trade, because #marketpvp XP (hope you understand), but you should always try a few things and find what works best for you.
---
I personally don't do inter hub trading, which can be huge as well
---
&gt; I'm referring largely to noraus, the leader of frt, who publicly declared a foreverwar to evict test
---
i'm pretty sure I missed noraus "public forever war declaration against test" hmmm, and i mean, when you invite/is friends already with most of non renting null i find it hard to blame him for it, even if it happened, which is pretty generous to say the least.
---
&gt; I'm sorry about your post, though. Would you like it to have an open casket or closed?
---
is this an attempt at being edgy or something? i'm getting too old for this
---
I agree.  I joined an NPC NS PVP corp right off the bat.  I think it was called Flying Dangerous?  We basically roamed NS in shitfit T1 frigates and it was probably the 2nd most fun I've ever had in Eve.  Living in NPC NS you'd still be able to bring your exploration ship and explore when not roaming for isk.  Definitely join an alliance that has some sort of PVP activity.  It's a great way to make friends and enjoy your time in game between ISK making activities.
---
That's sort of there on your stats page, the one that lists kills/losses by ship category. You just click on battleships or stealth bombers or whatever and it'll show all the battleships or stealth bombers you've killed or lost.
---
if you guys make to Battleships, you could try Triglavians, on perimeter sistem and Scouts level, there is no risk to do it in that conditions, and your friend could haul/ mine all the ore on Sealed minor cnduits
---
I liked it.  Upboat.

warmhole is best hole

---
The CEO said there would be no eve 2 or eve classic and instead said he'll make this eve good.
---
Same ceo was afk several years, in-fact the only time he really showed up this decade is when a korean company said they'll pay double for his shares if he can meet login/financial quotas.
---
So right now, and only for the length of the contract, he's pretty concerned with eve, looking successful, to get double the millions from his share in the company. Unfortunately it looks grim for you.
---
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^TTTHHHHIIIIISSSSSSS

It's fucking lame that everyone runs and hides when you and the boys try to pile in the warmhole together for some good content.
---
Yea of course I understand lol so u don’t trade at the large trading hubs?
---
Ever heard of a new player? I am sure after being a player of ten or more years, it is hard to remember what it is like to start Eve for the first time. Battle proc my ass.   
---
Nobody is discussing why a mining barge can't tank tens of destroyers. I am talking about how it is easy to grief a new player and get away with it since there are no real repercussions to suicide ganking.

Or maybe it was downvoted because people here are what is left from a dying game, invested too much time and money and can't let go to their play styles of old because they don't want to feel that old. Maybe suicide ganking is all they have in their miserable lives that they can't think of any other way of living. Or maybe, just maybe, and this is a wild guess... they are like you and have an empty space where their brain is suppose to be.
---
Cheers bro :) and yeh seems like thats the right call man.
---
Not exactly my fault you missed his sota a year or more ago. Feel free to go look it up.
---
Got em.
---
And you only need a few catalysts to suicide gank a mining barge no matter what the rookie does or how they fit their ship.
---
The client is 64-bit, not the server.
---
That movie is so good
---
You magnificent bastard. Take my filthy updoot
---
In one of their infrastructure upgrade announcements many years ago, they claimed that they made the switch to "64bit Windows Server OS" so that their processors could "benefit from the extra memory usage". 
---
So yes they haven't actually stated that their code is running in 64 bit processes, but it's still somewhat misleading to me.
---
Fit?
---
Here's the thing about offlining mwd, the earlier you do it, the more cap you gain.
---
Because your cap % will remain the same, so say at 50% cap you offline it, now your max cap is 133% of your mwd fitted cap, and your new 50% is 66% of your online mwd cap.
---
So, if you offline it once you're already at 0%, you will still be at 0%.
---
Upvote for Baahubali
---
saw the chinese characters in the title and thats a hard pass.
---
nah mate, not my job to look for this nebulous evidence in your behalf, onus of proof and all that.
---
I do find it quite fascinating however that the entity who supposedly declared a forever war to evict test, built a titan fleet for that purpose and invited "everyone" to do it somehow got a several months nip with those they claimed such war, after said declaration if we take your timeline. 
---
I mean don't get me wrong, I don't generally hold paper pushers in high regard, but not even I think they're this dumb.
---
I dont agree, I think it has promoted fights and does.  Seen abit of it and what not.  Dominion im not sure if it was more or less but I remember it being rather awful in terms of the larger groups dominating (extremely I mean) as it supported them very well.
---
True however i do still find merit in keeping it online despite being scrammed there is the odd occasion when frigates are trying to get out of null range when this happens is nice to get an mwd approach towards/ is also good for utility to right i.e. fighting a t1 frigate and say a mwd kiter comes in will be handy to escape or potentially catch em.

18 months ago Darkness was Dead ( If you follow  crap post ) this seems salty , KB looks pretty good atm , overall its better than a lot of bigger alliances.
---
Well,... sort of
---
I sit in Jita
---
And I don't move XP
---
Of course, when it's best to offline is different for every fight.
---
Wow!  What an adventure!
---
First, if you don't explode in Eve, you are probably doing something wrong.
---
I'd recommend you find a corp of friends, and make other explode, or even laugh together when you get exploded.
---
For what it is worth, exploration is very risky business.  It can be much less risky when done in sov nulsec that is friendly (blue).  I've done a lot of that.
---
Now I'm solo, as a member of Signal Cartel, where you can always get a free exploration ship when you get exploded.
---
Explore.  Explode.  Repeat.  It's a way of life.
---
yeye :)

---
Yup Darkness is very dead. Great timing for the post
---
Every version of SOV will be dominated by the larger group. Its just what having more man power does.
---
What sort of fight does it promote? Interceptors chasing round enotosis ships for hours on end isnt the most exciting and engaging content.
---
We are at the point where the only good big sov based fights that happen are people fighting just cause they are bored, not because its the best way to win Sov.
---
You must be new around here
---
Or just let us jump clone without leaving ship?
---
Can we get a "Recently" stat?
---
For example, whether a player generally gets kills Solo or as a Gang in the last 30 days, instead of just giving a total since the beginning of the character.
---
It sounds like the reverse is happening.
---
Thank you, added to watchlist
---
But not too deep, otherwise my selfesteem would suffer.
---
I rarely if ever do anything that needs another player, my playstyle turned to exclusively solo endeavours after my 3rd null megabloc experience being yet another disappointing lonely affair. Only time itd be nice is to have another scanner in a hole just to whip through stuff quicker, but I manage.
---
Every time I see this clip, I think to myself how it does *so much better* at portraying superhuman badasses than many Hollywood films. The fights which come anywhere close this one in feats and intensity are surprisingly rare, as far as I can remember.
---
That's one quality glitch.
---
This is legit pretty good.
---
Yonis for CSM!
---
flair is exotic dancer...I'm with you so far, I love the mal....female?!  This I can't stand for, good sir!
---
Could you reconsider the ZKill points system?   
---
Mean, currently points awarded for killmails are always integer numbers. It would be nice to calculate it with at least one digit after the decimal point.   
---
What I mean is that all kills are awarded at least 1 point. However there should be some difference in points for killmails when a ship has been killed in a relatively small skirmish with only say 10 pilots in the km vs a Muninn vaporized bu 100 Eagles. Atm both km's are worth 1 point, however it would be way better (IMO) if the former one would result in 1.3 points while the latter one would give only 0.1 point.
---
Every version is dominated by them but to what extent is important and entosis lessoned the amount considerably.  It also has promoted fleet fights, I disagree that it is just chasing around just the entosis ships.  It has also promoted skirmishes.  We are at this point right now not because of the sov warfare system but rather the resource system and the reason to fight.  Currently big fleet fights are mostly happening over the citadels but rarely or only in frat space at the moment.  But it isnt the sov they are after frat decided to annoy the bigger entity enough that they got themselves into a real war.
---
Really? We see lots of pings making comments regarding playing eve over doing RL important stuff like this. Ive honestly lost count. I guess my Tapi brain is just too odd to get it. I'll show myself out.

 \[SARD. - 嗜血/Trumps Bloodthirst@Winter Coalition#ping-起队\] @​everyone  今明2天我们有2个MAX  MAX CTA    分别是8月7号也就是今天晚上的8点，和8月8号晚上9.30的集结，非常重要的2个防守任务，谬宁银鹰T2后勤已经铺货，准备在03星城，如果你是单身请抽空参与，如果你有伴侣想办法让她陪你参与。各家军团管理全部再以公告形式下发到自家大群，动员我们的所有成员，七夕快乐。 
---
 Today and tomorrow, we have 2 MAX MAX CTAs on August 7th, which is 8:00 this evening, and 9.30 on the evening of August 8th. Two very important defensive tasks, Suining Yinying T2 Logistics has been distributed. Prepare in 03 Star City, if you are single, please take the time to participate, if you have a partner to find a way to let her accompany you. All the management of the various legions will be distributed to their own large groups in the form of announcements, mobilizing all our members, and Happy Tanabata.
---
Avi's soundboards were the best, just so hard to find now. Long live the Phallus of Malice.
---
If you don't care to do a simple google search for publicly available information, I'm not sure we agree on who the dumb one is.
---
The point everyone is making to you, is Tapi can only be so chill about their fleet participation is because they have at least twice the numbers of Frat and more allies to top it off so never have to be worried about who shows up.
---
Frat either needs everyone to show up or they lose before it even begins.
---
Every Warmhole Is A Goal!
---
I thought I was going to see CCP Falcon and friends running around restocking asteroid belts and making sure no ones found the Angel Titan that they’ve got cloaked up in a well known lowsec system.
---
Dewhore mode. Flip a switch and all kills are valued by % of damage done.
---
Looks like you have found a situation where the client has either bypassed the downtime session close when the server shuts down or that you have confused the client so that it never runs that function... Either way you can't do anything as the node your client was connected to would have shut down... If you were somehow able to re-establish a connection to the node when it is live again your client would have desynced and would therefore crash. Otherwise you would get a network time out after a while (maybe up to an hour) and then need to log in again.
---
It's for the Asian market, they're just inviting EVE players out of natural courtesy. How hard is this to understand?
---
What cinematic adventure is this?
---
\&gt; Every version is dominated by them but to what extent is important 
---
Currently there is 3 main groups controlling SOV just like it was with dominion. You either control SOV cause you are one the the main alliances in these groups, or you are allowed to live there as a buffer.
---
\&gt; We are at this point right now not because of the sov warfare system but rather the resource system and the reason to fight 
---
If there was a reason to fight over SOV there would be fights over SOV. Right now the 'skirmishes' are happening as the main body of the fleet sites on a gate hoping the other site jumps into them, otherwise it ends and everyone goes home.
---
\&gt;Currently big fleet fights are mostly happening over the citadels but rarely or only in frat space at the moment.  
---
Currently there are more fights over citadels because its a static objective and actually holds more importance then owning the SOV.
---
Very gentlemanly of them to use a condom
---
*CCP_Hilmar* *has entered the chat*.
---
Now we are talking about what is really important
---
Not gonna work. As a sample - a Sable warps in to an anomaly, bubbles down a Nyx and dies. A main fleet warps in 5 seconds later and and kills the Nyx.
---
% of damage done by that Sabre - 0.0%
---
Importance for that Nyx kill - 100%
---
Dominion definitely had more than 3 main groups.  so no that's incorrect.
---
I disagree that wioth regards to the skirmishing that that is what is always happening or has happened.  I've seen it.  So that's also incorrect.
---
I agree that citadels do hold more importance than the sov in most cases but not all of them.  That's also not a bad thing.
---
I looked it up on Netflix, there are 3 separate versions of *Baahubali: The beginning* one is hindi only, one is Tamil only, and the other has options for Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.
---
Baahubali 2 is in two separate versions, Hindi only or Tamil only. 
---
10 minutes into the first movie now and I can already tell its gonna be a good one
---
Trailed off somewhere around 
---
&gt;In the grand scheme of things, you are right with your analysis.
---
If it's a decent app then we'll mostly use it. Let's say between 1/3 and 1/4 of the 20,000 characters online are the mains of people that would use the app. If CCP gets 1-2$ worth of of value average off 5,000 users of the app each month that's 4-8 thousand per month at 80%. Enough for one programmer and maybe some help. 
---
I've never run an business but, I stayed in a holiday inn last night and I have run an Eve corp, sounds doable to me. Just a question of how to get 1-2$ off of us each month without being an asshat.
