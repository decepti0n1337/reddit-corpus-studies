Not really most of the groups that did died with the moon changes, because it takes a painful amount of time to mine a moon, like having the moon isn't what makes the money mining it is. 
---

---
Controlling the moon is great but nobody in groups willing to control it truth persistence wants to mine the dam thing because that's well not fun.
---
---
---
What in the actual fuck. This game was released a year prior to EVE. Crazy! It's all clicking as to why I loved EVE. I LOVED EARTH AND BEYOND FIRST!
---
Ah, that would definitely explain it then, I guess I am fine with that, grinding standing is not exactly what I call fun personally, thanks.
---
Your first mistake was prioritizing WH over nullsec space.
---
\&gt;No one would use citadels
---
  
---
Good.
---
No, stab in the back is accurate.  I remember putting TEST caps on the field in Wicked Creek back when we lived there.  The PL made up some excuse and shot the "friendly" caps.
---
When we were weak, it was our fault for being weak.  Now that we're strong, it's our fault for being strong.
---
Find you a website like http://anoik.is and put the name of the system into the search. It will show you the static connections the wormhole has. 
---
Static connections are connections the wormhole will always have. So a C3 with a hisec static will always spawn a wormhole to a hisec system. When that wormhole dies because it transmitted too much mass or it got old and died a new one will spawn typically in less than 2min.
---
That's 3 dreads in the lowest value C5 site, which is quite a step down from the higher value C5 sites or C6 sites. Tikki also happened to be quite talented and your average c5 resident couldn't do that.
---
Dunno what you're getting at. Paying attention shouldn't guarantee your safety in a high value site.
---
You can't quantify how much death is enough death. However, there's a group doing the runs around C6 space in 15 or so Leshaks at the moment and they're as yet impossible to catch. They're probably doing the sites nearly as fast as 3 dreads could too. The only time I've seen one die is when he was tackled by a drifter and had the site escalated on him. You think that's fine? It's alright for 15 battleships to do sites at the speed of the same value of dreads with minimal risk?
---
Maybe the only hardcore MMO. Only hardcore game? Lmao.
---
maulus may not be a combat frigate but it has several fun perks over t1 frigate line
---
-good speed  
---
-all the cpu you ever want  
---
-slot layout  
---
-highest sensor strength of t1 frigs so you can feel smart when the occasional comet sends ec-300s after you
---
&gt;hornet ec-300: \*attempts jam*  
---
&gt;me, an intellectual: i'll have you know that this craft has a substantially higher base sensor strength than your average line frigate, rendering your endeavors to nullify its target locking capabilities significantly weaker
---
overall it has some nice stuff to work with except for racial frigate boni, you want them racial frigate boni. the other weakness is its defangability i'd say, but that's not people's first thought and your fit counters that to some extent.
---
speaking of which, i wouldn't undock a ship with less than 5k ehp buffer with no ancil so props to that
---
I love how trolls try hard and fail.
---
Hello where are all the new players
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How is that retention working out
---
I've met a handful of players, but I personally keep my character name/corp/alliance on the DL until I get to know them well due to this one bad experience. 
---
I got stuck in a very uncomfortable position a long time ago when my IRL friend introduced me to his friend that played.  He was the kind of carebear who'd fit medium rails on a fucking tornado. Besides the fact that he literally didn't read any stats on ships, he'd get all pissy at me because I wouldn't invite him into stratops despite me telling him that's not how that works.
---
i think this is it. as a newbro everything scares me until i probably know better i guess.
---
Dual Mag stab Hype with Neutron Blasters, Void, at optimal, heated, does 1.1k dps with guns. A Dual Rad sink Leshak with fully T2 fit and T1 rigs reps 1.15 cold with Improved Exile and Hardshell 3. With it heated, it tanks 1.5k, without considering adaptive moving more resist profile towards kin therm. I'm also assuming this is a real life scenario and have ENAMs in and not gimmick tanking against kin therm.
---
So sink for micro transactions
---
Central &lt;Faction&gt; Sparking Transmitter
---
I would suggest joining Signal Cartel for a while. They don't allow instigating PvP but they provide excellent training for new pilots getting into exploration. 
---
Imho, exploration is one of the most profitable things a new player can do.
---
I always think it's cute when Christians think their mythology is the scary and real one.
---
Asset safety should only be redeemable in the same system.  Also delete small citadels.
---
If you want your shit back, plant a fort.
---
After reading all those post about Invasion I do think players have better imagination and story telling than CCP.
---
Indeed...but once spooled up the Leshak should outdo the hyp easily. So long as its tanky enough to stay alive for the first few mins. I would also assume at least moderate pimping for the leshak.
---
Multiboxing 10 accounts to shoot stationary rocks is the most boring thing I can imagine.  I'd rather wash the dishes.
---
Is that the optimal meta?  Maybe.  I'd wager a large amount that mittens hasn't sat staring at a monitor shooting a rock in many years.  All he needed to do was dupe his people into thinking that it was fun.   
---
And now?  This is the payoff for years of staring at a screen full of accounts shooting rocks - shooting undefended structures.  There's no glorious victory, goons don't even want the space.  When it's done?  Back to shooting rocks.  
---
But, I suppose it does explain all the sperg on reddit.  Years of work that the linemembers need to convince themselves was worthwhile.  Was it?  Damned if I know.  I suppose it's up to them to decide - but they will have a lot of time to think... while they stare at the rocks that they shoot.
---
&gt;Paying attention shouldn't guarantee your safety
---
It doesn't. Players die in krabbing ships all the time. 
---
&gt;they're as yet impossible to catch
---
So are MJDs too good in general, or are they too good in the hands of skilled players? Are those skilled players and people are just getting run around? Are normal linemembers trying to catch them or is it someone on the level of markj2? 
---
You can't just say "people get away using this so it's bad".
---
[deleted]
---
Yup, I'm agreeing with you here. A fully T2 fit 'squishy' Leshak (2 rad sink fit instead of 1) with T1 rigs tanks the Hype cold. Over-all, other than the Damavik, Trig ships are insanely op across the board.
---
The Bible is a fantastic work of fiction, especially the Old Testament.
---
It's actually pretty flexible - You can dual-rep it or do a blaster fit as well. 2-4-3 is just a great slot layout for frigates IMO.
---
Go to Sansha space and get intact armor plates.
---
I climb up to a similar amount about every other week or so. I tend to inject down to 2-3B and start trading again and climb back up
---
Because you can't exactly tell members to go do that, let's say it takes 30 minutes to strip the field ( that's honestly shorter then I expect it to take in reality ). 
---
now, this is a returning cost, if you have let's say 7 moons you need everyone in the alliance to spend 30 minutes a day to mine if you have 14 moons this is an hour, etc. 
---
Now telling you line members, yeah we want everyone to spend an hour of there day every day doing moon mining is not gonna go over well keep in mind this isn't fun to the people you tell to moon mine, so what would they do well most would likely not show up, so now you stuck with kick them or not if you don't more people will not show next time if you do well you won't have much of a corp left. 
---
Also, realize how many we need a max form for this pos bash events really happen in smaller groups, there relatively rare and more importantly when they do happen well it's often a fight so when it doesn't happen you can go well guy's there not fighting us let's make it hurt and take the moon, it's easy to sell such an event, especially given the rarity.
---
Yeah, those ones I often will skip, too much travel, even if you warp of and back to a can bookmark. Maybe hacking the best cans and then leaving is not the worst idea though.
---
Shhhhhhh you will ruin the spin masters narrative!
---
Yeah I think NC was actively against PH, and there were almost fights between the two. I think PL was more neutral.
---
ok, so name me a f2p game that lets you have access the full game with no paywall (within reason, so asian p2w mmos are out)
---
Because putting the safety of your computer/digital life in the hands of a dude who is that batshit insane is probably not a good idea. Even Kasperspy is probably safer, at least they only sell you out to the Russians.
---
"impede that over-supply" is a good narrative, I like that one.
---
remember deadzoning
---
Pure...unregretful....hatred....
---
&gt; Nobody cares

Says the guy with 50 replies to this chain.

It is a satire, right guys?  
---
Please tell me it's a satire.
---
a la tiananmen tank man.
---
Also your credit score, blood type, next of kin and any activities that may conflict with devoting more time to this.
---
Moral of this story: If eating cakes is more fun, that's what you end up doing
---
Yeah I am a new player so it was my first time seeing and fighting a Naglfar. Was exciting for all of us!!
---
It does, actually. This is quality.
---
You arrogant ass, you've killed us!
---
Because a capsuleer basically becomes their ship when they interface with it. That's like saying your control of throwing a ball doesn't get better with practice.
---
Come back and go wormhole you'll make enough money to play the game the way you want to
---
wait hold the f up
---
why did i miss people strapping citadel weapons to bombers? how tf did that one work?
---
“You” need a team then.
---
both use antimatter, its just Handling Antimatter but named so it makes sense
---
You could cell divide and multiply.  In our case the more structures you have... the more you can build.  One azbel births another.  Those two one each for four.  Those four one each... 8... 16...  32.... 64..... on and on
---
Yup let’s micro transaction this game to its grave.  
---
Dumbest idea I’ve ever heard.
---
They get to set the first one...
---
Just wait till you see the things I say 2 years from now.
---
Why can't middle skills take the same time as gunnery skills? The x6 training multipliers are nuts 
---
The world may never know
---
The new kill board: other games killed by the eve hoard.
---
Just over a cool tril.
---
And that's just one of us. Imagine if we coordinated to take down other games.
---
The guy pretty clearly states he has mental illness issues and recognizes that this is probably just an episode of that.
---
Pizza cutter comment.
---
Wow not incredibly inaccurate opening. One of my first KM I scrambled to get my Hurricane on scene where two Tengu were killing everyone in low sec. I warped in and burned straight for them and caught one of them on a bad turn and web scrambled the Tengu. Turned out it was some officer fit 100mn AB that acted like 10mn warp fit in speed. It grinder to a halt and melted under everyone’s fire. Good day.
---
&gt; There is no requirement, aside from OCD, that missiles have a similar skill-tree to turrets.
---
Yeah, this is kind of a dumb question to ask in the first place because of this point. You can ask "why this" to a LOTTA shit in this game and the missile skill tree is far from the first one my brain would go to. It's a design decision, you make every weapon platform the same then you might as well just have one weapon platform.
---
That’s kind of sad then, we shouldn’t really be making fun of the guy then
---
I don't see why you can't do the same now? Just grab a couple rorq alts, plop down a moon structure. Bam Profit.
---
Imagine if one of those whales came to Eve. Injected into a Faction Titan, officer fit it, head full of implants, and then tried to march into Goon Space.
---
Mining channel is filled with PIRAT and code who feast on all the unfiltered intel.   Do NOT even wander in.  They’ll toss a bounty on you in a specific amount and you’ll be marked for future blood and salt.  
---
Don’t get in the mining channel.  Literally reddit is a more constructive and helpful community and that’s really saying something.
---
PVPers have to be more hardcore than ever to kill the PVErs.
---
Lol ya, I meant MMO.
---
i dunno we paid like 70bil for ours like 4 months ago. and the market isnt that much better.
---
With proper shuffles, miner trading is way more than 1%. Like 30-40%.

The easiest way is to use a mapper to help you find your way around.

ITT op admits to breaking Eula
---
Because t2 wasn't always a thing and back in the day there weren't as many skills as there are today. All the spec skills were brought in for t2 missile systems, which were a natural add on after t1.
---
Because it's a videogame and the designers decided to do that.
---
Hell March Red Alert.
---
I can't even imagine being in highsec for two years, let alone being in a boring ass Corp with whiney superiors for that long.
---
Honestly sometimes I go explore for hours and come up with like 50m. Then other times I go out and come back with 500m in the same amount of time or less. Anoms go quick and you gotta be fast and pay respects to lady luck.
---
Think he meant cruise missiles. Big thing in 2007-8. If anyone has that old youtube series of bombing run #52 or whatever it was, thats a good example.
---
Yeah, we're totally going to hell for laughing at this. 
---
More seriously I read it as massive paranoia, like honestly if I where the person in question I would discuss this with w/e professional I'm seeing and likely walk away from the game a bit. ( i do get that given rational advice here might not exactly be helpful but still ).
---
Deadspace/faction T2 frigs is not uncommon
---
This is either a previously unsaid sentence or a fragment of one of Sam Hyde's performances and I'm not sure which is which
---
The problem is, while catching DED runners make great videos, they take less risk than an anom runner due to being behind an acceleration gate. You don't want to push all the farm behind acceleration gates. That'd reduce overall kills in null.
---
Did you join PL yesterday? Stabbing allies in the back should be their motto. It should be in their Alliance Show Info page.
---
Might wanna take a break from downing their cultural koolaid
---
Hmm maybe these goons aren’t the good guys
---
This is truly a shitty year indeed.
---
There's always two types of test guys
---
Ones who know what they're talking about
---
And then this idiot.
---
Would you prefer going back to player owned stations in null?
---
Dota 2, League of Legends, HoTS, Dauntless, fortnite... Should I go on?
---
.. but there should be. It takes less time to train into both types of Capital Turrets per race than it does to train into XL Cruise Missiles and Torpedoes.
---
Light Missiles III -&gt; Heavy Missiles III -&gt;
---
- Cruise Missiles V -&gt; XL Cruise Missiles
---
- Torpedoes V -&gt; XL Torpedoes.
---
Small Turret III -&gt; Medium Turret III -&gt; Large Turret V -&gt; Capital Turret (both types).
---
.. but there should be. It's far more convenient to train into both types of Capital Turrets per race than it is to train into XL Cruise Missiles and Torpedoes.
---
Sometimes the only way to describe something is by saying it got yote.
---
If you're taking pictures of screens in 2k19 you probably can't play it on anything
---
&gt;  make your preferred play-style even easier.
---
Imagine if my preferred play-style was actually dying and lots of people leaving due to heavy krabbification of Eve, leading to a stale game and unsubs. Someone should better be defending its interests.
---
10 years nullseccers argued for their preferred playtyles, just because they had the privilege of voting behavior organization. Is it too much we get a chance?
---
Now naming all my ships some numbered variant of SHITBUCKET
---
&gt;Definitely were some good times.
---
iirc capital missile systems used to include citadel in the nomenclature. this was way before the actual citadel structures were put out.
---
Delete damage caps.
---
Also, if you're one of those bittervets who misses really terrible features like clone upgrades, you're honestly dumb as fuck.
---
Bring back jukebox tho

Is it defending when it's GotG? It looks more like public service

---
Certain groups don't mine moons for their organizational needs because they find the activity utterly repulsive. They just want to log into the game and pew. The old system with POS's gave pvp groups a prize that helped fund their playstyle. I think Carpri's idea for a less efficient alternative to get goo is not a bad idea. I wouldn't completely go back to the old system though.
---
At least gotg got marginally better after dropping slyce.
---
Long ago you used to be able to use cruise missiles in a kestrel. The only thing was the missile size fitting in the launchers. They changed it to launcher specific before capital missiles were a thing
---
its 3am so brace yoirself because here goes.
---
go exploring in an interceptor, start a post-amarrian choir/drone project, get high on exile boosters, talk about life with your new minmatar roommates(all 9 of em), go exploring in a battleship(sisters of eve and their line of laser/scan/droneships - cruiser and frig can go invisible) and do not forget the female exotic dancers before undocking, hotdrop on goonswarm rorquals, end up in the news with a headline "Man does all of the drugs, punches god in the face and telepathically sends every person on the planet a killmail", steal mining drones then resell them to the alliance you stole from via a network of 63 alts made just to fly a ship that can Make Shit Go Whoosh™, apply for csm because you represent old eve nuff said, laugh at the corpse of faction warfafe, train biology to V before doing all the drugs again, laugh at the corpse of red v blue, laugh at your own corpse, train advanced psychomorph psychology to V and literally fuck yourself(this time without being a necrophiliac), go mine in a cloaky mining frigate, start a PI chain then forget about it for a year, hunt bots, shitpost about tiananmen to chinese guys playing on vpns, participate in Shipspinning™, go Bomb© some motherfuckers, ninjasalvage some carebears, and most importantly
---
Enjoy the taste of Quafe™ Plus.
---
I’m love the mining channel, I will continue talking about anything remotely related to resource collection and shitposting with everyone else.
---
As for CODE, lol, they can come find me in a wormhole, and I already have a good bounty.
---
iirc local is not "run" by concord but by signals through the gate network. WH space has no gates thus delayed local.
---
Your docking request for potato was accepted.
---
Limiting it to 24 / yr will just increase alt proliferation. 12m sp is more than enough for hyper specialized characters.
---
&gt;can see the lines just fine with default settings

NC flung some cash their way to keep DeadCo busy while horde/pl/nc could focus on.... whatever it is they're doing.

You forgot SSN, you scrub tier recruiter :)

It makes me feel old.
---
ctrl-fspreadsheet
---
nope
---
hey, you missed one.
---
Every time a new player posts anywhere: DON'T keep your stuff in highsec citadels! If you can dock at a highsec citadel, it's probably an unanchor scam (the station owner waits until enough people have stored assets at a citadel, then unanchors it and scoops it with a bowhead)
---
It's *hella* interesting to read about, as with most other mythologies, but *that's about it.* 
---
Nothing but an interesting story.
---
Sorry, Christians.
---
If you ever took 1 look at POSes you'd be able to see that basically all they had in common with citadels was the ability to man the guns and hide from hostiles. Outposts are far closer to citadels, and have a better asset protection than citadels. Kindly return to the official forums until you understand the game
---
&gt;Those are pretty good numbers.  Here's a couple from the end of 2016:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Vlil in December 2016 had  9,217 kills per zkillboard  
---
&gt;Aivonen October 2016 had 10,055 kills per zkillboard
---
The Doomheim thing is pretty cool, didn't know about that.
---
But it would've been more accurate to call it Helheim, or perhaps even Niflheim would suffice.
---
Those are some pretty dumb interpretations of already bad ideas that assume that fixing the current direction of the game involves only a few hotfixes and that's it.
---
It doesn't.
---
Don't get me wrong, some "quick" changes to some mechanics would help a lot. Not the ones you mentioned.
---
Hic is a non bridgable ship meaning it's useless for blops it might be fun squizing them out of a frig hole to jam a cyno but that's about it.
---
Man, what the hell
---
I've been playing this damn game since clone upgrades were a thing and I still have yet to meet a single stranger who happens to play EVE :(
---
Fixing the game "" requires fixing mentalities. However, in not being able to fix mentalities, making the mentalities less easy to live does a decent job. Like I said it won't be a quick fix for anything thats wrong with the game but we could try couldn't we?

Let’s blow up the null gates and the alliances can rebuild them by transporting FLEX gate parts via wormhole, then we’ll have an excuse to nerf null local.
---
It’s weird right? It’s almost like I care so little that I have a ton of free time to shitpost on Reddit.
---
Don’t give up hope OP! I was a dedicated explorer for years, so I can definitely recommend a few things that might help you out.
---
The best money in exploration is generally in running the rated DED sites. If you don’t have the combat skills yet to run 4-6/10s, id definitely run lower end sites in high sec until you do, or if you do already, switch to doing 4-6/10 sites now. I would also pass on exploring in wormholes and stick to Aridia. Its a great place for an explorer to start for a couple of reasons. 
---
Firstly, it’s pretty remote and there are high sec pockets you can safely live in between day trips to surrounding lowsec. Check out a system called Mishi, it has a CONCORD Bureau for turning in OPE’s. As far as other drops, the armor reppers, neuts, and EANM’s you can find in Aridia are pretty valuable. 
---
Secondly, you can see local chat and not have to rely on constantly D-Scanning for safety. There will be times where you’ll go hours without seeing other people in system, so you won’t have to compete for loot and you can usually work in peace. 
---
Thirdly, you don’t have to worry about bubblers. This makes life so much easier when you’re trying to travel home with loot and opens up lots of options for ship choice.
---
As far as what ships to use, every DED site in Aridia can be run in a properly fit Stratios. You can also use a Legion or Tengu, but none of the sites are very difficult. You just need something that can apply damage at range (40-50km) to avoid neuting battleships. Even a Gila works fine, but is riskier without a cloak.
---
Just stick with it. Exploration is very profitable and fun. You’ll have some days where you get nothing and others where you make billions. Hope this helped!
---
&gt; It's not about who I like. I run based on ideas. If you like the ideas, and want them to get represented, vote. If you don't, then don't for vote me. These is no room for your metagame stretching spinning dogshit in this.
---
Then man up and split your personal opinion of me from this thread. I'm not even playing right now so metagaming is a dumb excuse to run from the very simple and direct question. 
---
&gt; I know your type. I know your ideals.
---
No, you don't. You proved it with this:
---
&gt;  but also follow your behavior on Goon internal comms.
---
I'm never on goon coms. I barely post in elysium, and when I do it's shit posting in elysium. I hang out on discord.
---
If you did follow me you'd realize that we agree on *a lot*. But you can't pull your head out of your political ass long enough to realize that. That's why I wanted to know how you're going to be an adult and overcome that and represent *us*. Ask anyone who talked to me at Eve Vegas 2018 what my opinions on the game are. Hell, I'll even unban you on the r/eve discord so you can take a look for yourself. You don't know, you assumed and you let those assumptions lead you directly to politics and propaganda. Get over it. How do *you* plan to represent players you do not like in an objective fashion and *not* an emotional one?
---
CCP certainly needs to try or this game will finally go down the drain, even Hilmar recently pointed that out (and then fucked up something related next week with the new patch, but whatever).
---
The thing is, all those are really bad and simplistic ideas. Not saying it is impossible or anything like that, just that we should try all those actually good ideas out there.
---
This.
---
Rote mined moons once. Was awful. Caused a coup that was literally the worst coup in the history of the game.
---
We had money Moons once. In Syndicate and again in Querious as part of the only good fight club. Did that money make us Uber space rich? No. It paid for loaner ships. It paid for the AT. It paid for logistics. It paid for fleets for other nerds.
---
It let us play at our casual level and focus on being good on the field. All the moon changes have done is to increase the amount of man hours required to get the same benefit at the alliance level. If you have subhuman capital to spare (that is, lol miners) then you can continue on as before. But you are sacrificing some of the tapestry that makes up the content circle.
---
They were targets and objectives that were at real risk before. It's different nowadays. We've adapted, but the trend has been towards bigger fights for everything because the depth of the targets is smaller and the time to batphone is way longer. This coalesces all fights to be too big.
---
And yes, we've adapted and we're still better than scrubs from sov null.
---
Fight me.
---
Hi, rote Kapelle here.
---
Dead alliance. Died with Moons.
---
Dude I didn't even know you existed until the 20th time you made a thread and happened to ping me in it. You're not as relevant as you think you are. That's why I'm asking you very direct tough questions - because of the ego.
---
You do realize that when I got mod on r/eve - Mittani was surprised about it on the meta show right? Check my mod date and check the meta show at that time if you don't believe me (IIRC, the second one after I got mod). I got mod here because I have a lot of experience on other subreddits. I got that mod slot from a team that wasn't exactly a fan of goons - if you bothered to read the subreddit you spam your shit on 24/7 you'd know.
---
Why can you train a missile system to t2, but not use t2 ammo until you train missile launcher operation V?
---
I think you just discovered the way to save EVE. Just destroy any and all opposition. If theres no other game left people have to play EVE.
---
~~yeah but ph still sucks balls lmao~~ /s
---
Jokes aside, I don't quite know how to show my appreciation,  but I do appreciate this comment, as it deserves the recognition. And I'm sure many others do. 
---
You're a good dude. It's nice to see this kind of stuff on this sub.
---
What's an EVE to a nonbeliever?
---
Why run a c6 it’s way more dangerous and way more likely to get you evicted (there are something like 5x more C5s) rather than a c5? Which is probably better for subcap ratting anyways
---
I miss hunting your links :)
---
if ya wana  a reall chalange take the orca into a triglavian  foothold system  and mine in a minor conduit lol.
---
If I was in that alliance I would actually biomass, worse than TEST
---
I currently rat in a C5 and was looking to expand into another wormhole. I'm not opposed to doing it in another C5. Just was wondering what it would take to rat in subcaps in a C6.
---
i think the biggest issue is that most of the ideas don't have anything to do with making the power of nullblocs get scaled down. they might have something to do with that power not increasing further but if  ways to scale up are removed then no one can ever catch up and we're left with in-fighting as the only way to break the stranglehold.
---
Why look to expand into another wormhole rather than getting dreads started in your home C5?
---
I run fof barghest in my C5 so I wanna keep doing that since it's pretty AFK and im making 1.5 bill an hour. Just wanted to try something new that wasn't dread ratting as i have the toons for subcap stuff.

The trick is finding players who are not vicious and will walk you through the minefields. 
---
Eve has matured over the years, and new players are viewed as an investment more often than as a target.
---
The people who complain that Eve has gotten too easy are the ones who ran out of helpless saps to gank. That tune change pretty quickly when they decide to deal with people who know what they are doing.
---
&gt; Outposts are far closer to citadels
---
Yeah it's not like they could be captured allowing people to lock you out of them, and we all remember the time people put as many as 20 of them in their staging! Fuck off you drooling retard &lt;3
---
No, it's because your entire way of thinking is delusional. 
---
The stuff OP did is *supposed* to happen in this damn game. That's why it's a sandbox. Plus, why are you judging his character for what he does in a video game? He could be a doctor in real life who saves children on a weekly basis. I do shit to people in this game I would never do in real life, all the time.
---
This delusional RP-style "herp derp honor" way of thinking is completely disgusting and makes you look like you're fucking 10.
---
But hey, that has a place in this game too, I guess.
---
Crawl back into the hole you came from, you useless creature.
---
Not everyone needs to look special, maybe they just like the suit lol

These belong together, but not in the way you might think.
---
&gt; Lastly, Why be a highsec care bear when you can be a nullsec care bear and make more ISK per hour?
---
You apparently have no idea what he just said.
---
You need to either read more or stop circlejerking with your alliance.
---
And your ideas wouldn't achieve that at all.
---
You could probably just use zkb and click on stats on each alliance to figure that out yourself.
---
I think we're "dead" for almost 7 years now?
---
he's not your guy, buddy
---
He publishes a blog and writes about his weird view of reality even though he knows it's distorted. Everyone is free to do what they want but you don't paint a target on your back and then expect people not to aim at it. Admitting to mental problems shouldn't be a free "get out of jail" card. He writes crap, knows it's propably crap, still publishes it for everyone to read. he deserves to be made fun of just like everyone else would.

wow... just wow...

You're a new type of structure
---
♥
---
Dude that's fukin awesome. Idk why but anytime I hear about people even being in the corps associated with B-R or the various wars such as fountain at the time of said events I think of them of literal gaming heroes. Such awesome stories like above stem from this game. 
---
For sure gonna come back later lmao.

iirc this was adjusted some time back, and is no longer the case. The lowest you can get is 1%, so you will always pay 1% in taxes even if you are in a 0% brokerage structure.
---
Has no one told you yet....?
---
&gt; run from the very simple and direct question.
---
How exactly did I run? I literally said I'll not be representing you.
---
&gt;  Hell, I'll even unban you on the r/eve discord so you can take a look for yourself.
---
Lol what am I supposed to be grateful for the removal your self admittedly arbitrary ban. I'm fine with not using that platform.
---
&gt; You don't know, you assumed and you let those assumptions lead you directly to politics and propaganda.
---
If it's true that you agree with me a lot, then it means I'll automatically represent you. Again, you an I have a different view on what representation means.
---
&gt; How do you plan to represent players you do not like
---
There is literally no more than 4-5 people I particularly wouldn't have a beer with over our Eve-related past. For anyone else I don't have such a problem. And I don't mind not representing those people.
---
Yeah that appears to be the case, thanks for the info. Honestly glad I don't have to grind standings or something, would be more annoying than anything just for that 0.25%.
---
:ccp:
---
Thanks for the silver, please stop downvoting fellow Goons
---
One ping, one ping only please.
---
upvoting only for the RA2 sound track
---
I hear you haven't seen enough Panfam money losses! Well don't worry! Plenty more still to come, if you will direct your attention to the above matrix that Tuzy so kindly created, you'll notice that it does not yet contain a single Keepstar! Now you might think, that seems silly, goons can't even kill a panfam Keepstar with their whole super fleet deployed? Believe me when I tell you, that is most certainly not the case, just stay tuned and you will get all the delicious extra large explosions you can handle, and then some!
---
Well just to be clear, you will have to grind standings to get the brokerage tax down in NPC stations. This is key for hubs like Amarr, Jita, etc. since most people will list buy orders out of the market citadels and then ship the goods to the market hub next door and sell there. You can hypothetically sell out of the market citadel you bought stuff in, but most of the time you'd want to move it because a lot of people just sit in the Amarr or Jita station and multibuy from there

Above is my post history. Show me where one point I made a post and pinged you, before you knew I existed. You are still maliciously lying and being manipulative in an attempt to cast a shadow to what happens to be a very successful AMA.

&gt; I literally asked you a question that had nothing to do with goons. Why the hell you fetishize them so much is beyond me.

I answered your question about 3 comments ago. You are deliberately stretching the comment chain just to see whether I'll say something I regret.

Your mod history isn't contradictory with anything I said above.

---
&gt; Missiles were never originally intended to be a primary weapon system.
---
Well, they are now.  Open a new character, when you are introduced to the races, you can choose to see the weapons of the factions - Caldari are introduced with missiles as a main weapon. 
---
This statement no longer holds truth.
---
Yes there is. They are a main weapon now. Why should new Caldari players be forced to train 2x as long the weapons for each size tier? 
---
----
---
It's an antiquated artifact of EVE's past, that needs to be changed. It absolutely makes no sense from a design standpoint that Caldari and Minmatar should have to train THREE weapon systems in total for their race (hybrid/projectile, 'dps' missiles, 'range' missiles) whereas gallente and Amarr need two (hybrid/laser, drones [applicable to all races really]).
---
Tried it for fun a while back.
---
I forget what it was but - There is a point where the tutorial 'assumes knowledge' that a new player doesn't yet have.
---
go back 5 years ago and there were no black screens
---
name one skill system that biases against a particular race other than missiles.
---
Split missile training = 2x total skillpoints = 2x weapon skillpoints needed for caldari/minmatar.
---
Agreed. If you're in space at login you shouldn't show in local until you're in warp.
---
Hit me in the feels bro.

ditto but opposite, I have cruise V...

this is actually a good point, but not one that shouldn't be overwritten for balance reasons.

capital sized missiles
---
Very true, I probably will need to grind for the trade-hub factions if I ever start station trading to players. Right now i'm just doing the "simple" and lazy approach of buying stuff that NPCs seed but players are too lazy to bring to the proper stations themselves.
---
Ohgod please tell me someone said this
---
I literally cannot think of a worse possible comp to fight muninns with. Can the drones even keep up?
---
Haven't seen one data site in low and null that I would ignore.
---
Sensor strength skills. Drone skills. Almost any ewar skills. Shield and armor skills. Hell the only skills that aren't unique in their ordering are ships and turrets. (I'm ignoring Indy bc I don't know dick about it)
---
That's not the first fight that happened though.
---
Most the fights in tenal have skill urself running away so far.
---
This is the first time I've seen them stay and fight.
---
Having done T2 capital guns on several characters... I don't wanna touch missiles. The missile system sucks and should match the gun system. All I have to do is train small to 3, medium to 3, large to 5 then capital 5 and both specs. Missiles I'd need to do Lights to 3, Heavies to 3, Torps *and* Cruises to 5 and then both XL Torps and Cruises to 5 then specs.
---
To get both short and long range weapons on a Revelation, Moros or Naglfar I'd need to train one 5x, one 7x and two 10x to level 5.
---
For the same choice between long and short range on a Phoenix I'd need to train one 4x, one 5x, two 7x and two 10x to level 5. That's an additional 11x multiplier skill just to get the same choice. That's almost a 33% increase to training time. And if I wanted to crosstrain a Phoenix pilot into say, a Naglfar I'd need to train up a whole list of different support skills. To train my Revelation into a Moros I've already maxed my gunnery supports and only need the faction Dread skill and the specific gun skills. That's why all 3 of my dread pilots can fly a Nag, Moros or Rev but none can Phoenix.
---
Removing panic would also create more interesting choices for CCP's mining customers and they could spend hours determining the most efficient way to fit their rorquals while balancing tank versus ewar versus cost.
---
Because with launchers, the skill requirement is based off the ammo, not the launcher.
---
Check your wallet after playing the other MMO options in 2019, you might have missed how much you are getting screwed by the game company instead of the other players.
---
lol skillu virgins feeding sabres again
---
I got a good question for you Olmeca, so please weigh in. I actually wish all CSM members focused more on this, so here goes...
---
One of the biggest problems EVE has is that there’s nothing truly worth fighting over anymore. Lots of other problems stem from this and it’s slowly killing the game. Since there are no valuable content drivers in nullsec, all people do is crab. And because everyone is off crabbing, alliances end up building supercap armies (where else are all those Rorqual minerals going to go?) making invasions even more impractical. EVE is essentially stuck in a perpetual Cold War with no point in escalation. Every active war is just for “the lulz” and ends up being weeks of structure bashing or super blobs with no real content. This is probably one of the reasons veteran players quit. War has a hugely stimulating effect on the economy though. Frankly, EVE needs more of it, if not making it the default state of nullsec. We have a huge problem with too much supply and not enough demand. Plunging nullsec into war would do wonders for the game, I swear it.
---
That being said, what specific things of value would you add to nullsec to make invading other regions worth doing? What changes need to be made to make war more frequent and fun? Please let us know!
---
Why it would?  
---
Think about all those rorqual alts and ratting supers
---
90% of them would not exist now
---
Holy fuck
---
He ended eve godly, danm!
---
But what's the DPS / Application difference between a Draugur and say a Magus?
---
Legitimately don't know. But if the older trig line is anything to go by it'll be a fair margin.
---
You can inject a ratting super or rorq miner with 12m sp. it won't be great...but it's done.
---
As a lover and teacher of EWAR frigate use, I'm severely disappoint in you for not using at least one dampener!!!  (just giving you a hard time, love the vid, EWAR 4-life baby!)
---
Oh man, I am too new to really understand all of this but this mad me laugh my freaking butt off. Thanks for the laugh.
---
They already can and do.
---
There’s plenty of proof if you just look really closely.
---
In the mirror.
---
this video is literally #1 on r/eve right now
---
Yo man, I feel you and ripping down old tunes cos you burnt then stealing is a painful, like the feeling of having no core group kinda ruins eve
---
How do any of those have the same "bias" against a race like missiles? Shield and Armor are completely separate types of tank so why would you get both with the same skill? EWAR is, again, a separate type of (support) weapon, so why would you get all types of EWAR with one skill? They also dont penalize you by having one type require double the skills to use compared to others, so there's no "bias" there. Drones are, if youve noticed the pattern here, its own unique weapon type. They also dont require one race of drones to have double the skills required like missiles do.
---
Not citadel but cruise. Back in the day stealth bombers fit cruise missiles and were used for insta-popping frigates
---
The Sparkling Transmitters are the highest tier for pirate data sites I believe, but the cans are stupidly spaced apart in the site.
---
Never said the extra reinforce time needed to be plex or micro transaction based.   Make it an concord LP item, or like the sec status fixer which uses a # of dropped tags from rats, or give some low value random in game item a new purpose.  Or Make it a straight isk cost, which is another isk sink and could help with that issue too.
---
We need to offer options that allow CCP to get out of the rut of building a cancerous game mechanic that caters to the lowest common denominator (small dude in HS or WH with no support available 24/7) which leads to terrible scaling up to large alliance movements.  Some other option like this, or another idea, can free up the mechanics to scale well for large fights yet still give the little guy an out if he wants it.  And the worst case is that a large block uses the mechanic too, and the timer is no worse than it is already today.    With an added bonus of an isk or item sink to buy the nectar reinforce time.
---
Can we get a CJ meme of this?
---
Eve is...

Log on farm isk/run a bot/use mom's credit card to lolinject skills so you can go die in a le epic fleet fight thats TIDI'd out the ass due to literally 900 titans on grid, with no less than 20 citadels within 1 AU of your location
---
They were called citadel missiles
---
Yep. Bombers used to have a bonus to missiles rather than torpedoes as well, and I guess someone managed to stretch it to fit capital cruise missiles instead.
---
Why are you being downvoted for this?
---
Why do you think they’re making all these trig ships so op?
---
Drones far benefit gallente more than any other race. Missiles far benefit caldari more than any other race. ECM, Caldari, sensor disruption, gallente, energy neutralizers, amarr, webification and Target painting, minmatar, shield, minmatar and caldari, armor, gallente and amarr. Every one of these things and many more have unique training just the same as missiles do.
---
That's how.
---
Citadel torps were definitely capital weapons. I can't ever recall seeing them on stealth bombers though.
---
Yeah, this is definitely a Corp theft, but not a heist. Heist means you went into the Corp planning on stealing the entire time, not that you saw a bunch of isk and decided it was more valuable than the other people in your alliance
---
If you’re the quick swipe that used to be around in some of the wormhole VOIP servers you were prolly a racist a-hole in Albion too. 
---
If you aren’t, good for you, this story was quality 👍🏻
---
How does a skill make your ship have stronger armor? Same reason.
---
You mean you guys weren’t aware?
---
None but that wasn't specificically part of the conversation previously. If we wanna go that route I'd say path of exile qualifies nicely. Either way regardless his point was originally valid, that they advertise the game as a free game when in actuality that's not the case which is misleading and I'm sure scares off a few newer players. I'll concede that other games do it but I don't agree with it as a practice. At least go the route WoW does and at least make it clear that it's more of a trial up to a certain point. They are pretty up front about the level cap in Wow for free version.

It's not about "herp derp honor". It's about the fact that *theft is immoral*.

If I remember rightly, you could fit a single cruise launcher on an enyo too.

Yeah that’s how it is

PL participated, NC sat on the fence and waited to see who would win.

You're expected to sub to do PI as it's a passive source of income and can be extremely lucrative.
---
You're allowed to do bits and pieces like keep your extractors running or import and export as an alpha, but not actively colonise a new planet.
---
Once met a dude while out drinking. Said he was in test. Nice guy, we were gonna share a taxi to some kind of party. Out of the blue gf gets mad, and tells me to ditch him or no sex. I was so happy to finally have someone to talk eve to. : /
---
You can make back your reputation and join a new group and make new friends. You probably won’t have access to hangers for a few years but just go PvP

GHSC: "We infiltrated an alliance and stripped it of all of its wealth."

"hero derp"? ... and I'm 10? LOL. If you're too stupid to read... and I can only assume you are since you missed the part where I'm ok with what he did. I just find it hilarious that he thinks he deserves this applause and graditude by posting a wall of theivery text for all of us to read. 
---
When you should know more than any of us... being a Goon turd, that literally thousands of players could do what he does by clicking the mouse a few times. Those of us that refuse to do it I find to be far more worthy than this guy. 
---
With that said... don't you have some mining to do?
---
I am running 2019 eve on 2011 tech so fuck me, I guess?
---
You can't import/export either.
---
I see. Thanks.
---
We unironically declared race war on the Brazilians playing the game because we got bored, other Brazilian groups joined us in the war against Brazilians because they hate them as well.
---
well its intrinsic to the point as we are talking about eve.
---
poe is definitely not a mmorpg. 
---
It just seems like complaining about something that's free, which to me is amazing.
---
I could understand if it was an argument about the f2p not enticing enough to get people to sub, but the fact that an alpha can rat in a VNI to get 500 plex for omega in an actual reasonable time kind of completely negates this argument.
---
Jesus you have one smooth brain dont you. 
---
Look at each of those things, you only train one thing to use it. Take for example EWAR or Drones. You dont train a skill for each race of sensors you want to jam, or target paint or what ever, or have to train 2 types of skills to use gallente drones while you only train 1 skill for the others. 
---
With missiles, you have to train multiple skills for each size of missile compared to only 1 skill for each size of turret based weapons, or drones, or EWAR of anytpe.
---
I do all the time.
---
I meant shoot it off from the command centre.
---
you're 20 days in and only done one constellation? how long can your guys keep 10 rorqual accounts plexed without mining?
---
because those .01 isk mods on zkill are almost assuredly not .01 isk
---
I remember back in the day it was an advantage because you only had to train something like cruise missiles to 5 to get the spec, whereas for guns if you wanted to get the large autocannon spec you had to train small and medium specs before you could get large.
---
&gt;sensor strength skills
---
same sp requirement for each faction, not biased.
---
&gt;ewar skills
---
caldari is different here yeah, their main skill (ECM) is 2x, whereas everyone else's is 3x (sensor linking, target painting, weapon disruption).
---
after that each race's support skill is 5x. So a 250K SP difference total, biased towards caldari. This doesnt make up for the several million tied to weapons systems.
---
&gt;Drone skills
---
not only are they effectively universal (i.e useful for all ships), they are balanced for each race SP wise???
---
&gt;Shield and armor skills
---
Equal SP cost overall. The core skills (reps + extenders + invulns) take about 2 mil SP, equal for armor and shield.
---
See how this is all different (minus 250K sp in ewar) to one race being gimped by several million SP?
---
Global warming is just humanity avenging the first Titanic
---
everything you listed has equal training for each race. 500k sp for minmatar, 500k sp for amarr, etc.
---
Missiles don't.
---
Missiles take 2x as long as other platforms.
---
They were out structure bashing, which again begs the question of why Ishtars. 
---
Drones can't keep up when you drop Bouncers :l
---
Let’s see if we can #2 spot this one
---
CCPpls fix
---
It wasn't a cruise launcher, you could load any kind of missile into a launcher if it had enough capacity. So you'd have Cruise in a small launcher, but not many.
---
Sort Dragon is the worst leader i've seen.

&gt;he writes crap, knows it’s propaly crap

Thanks!
---
One more question, this time about the real money economy. Back when I played, there were no PLEXes. Now I see you can buy them for real $$ and sell them for isk, but is reverse possible? Can people now legally change isks into real $$?
---
Also, I have an omega subscription (I had it for all those years I wasn't playing, too). And my account seems to have some PLEX which I certainly never recall buying. Do they represent my current subscription or are there are gifts/extras I might have accumulated over my years? I wonder if I should sell them for in game isk or keep them (the other use they have would be to save some real $$ and extend my omega status for free for some time I guess?)
---
"got famous doing it"
---
Who the fuck are you?
---
I also jumped my slowcat Archon into B-R, under the NC banner.
---
The fight was so long, I actually fell asleep... 
---
Then woke up to find my Archon drifting among the debris of dozens of Titans. It was a sight to behold.
---
You're on the moon. 
---
No moonmen allowed
---
Tbf I wouldn't compare him to your mum.
---
If you want a fair fight why not just do abyss proving grounds ? Sure you will need to throw a few billion isk at a dope fit but it’s fun as hell.
---
You can't really call it shortsightedness when people have been pointing this out since Abyssmal PVP was on Sisi, and again before the Iki even hit live.  At that point I think the only real options are incompetence, or lack of giving a shit.
---
&gt; 10 second black screen

But if they do that, I won't be able to try scanning down cloaky campers that, like clockwork, always log in at the same time each day :D
---
&gt; right now
---
*Evil laugh*
---
Honestly?  Yes.  POSes and Stations were better balanced.  Each had a different role and different capabilities, and POSes were useful for every single group in the game.
---
Attempting to combine both POSes and Stations was a terrible idea, and doesn't work well.
---
So you got banned for trying the old trick of using Russian prices to swindle things for a cheaper price? lol

No sorry for me bad English, I’m asking if I buy using Russia Shop I will get ban?

CCP is still trickling in dosages of chemotherapy to kill off the ECM cancer. Let's let that take its course first.
---
This guy was there.
---
Like Goons (never) did in WWB.n
---
Jesus that was a long time ago. That was when I first got into the game....
---
Or un-warp-toable (I fucking tried) sigs for 20 seconds after loading your new system. I've manually dscanned targets in sites and just have to sit there and wait till the game figures out I am there. Target is gone now.
---
Do you live in Russia? If you do, then you will be fine to use steam store when it is set for Russia. If you do not, it violates the Steam terms of use and can get you banned from steam, which could mean your steam-based eve account would no longer be usable, or at the least end up stuck as an alpha until you could buy PLEX via ISK to get omega time
---
They will call you goon dick suckers for now as reddit brains are small. On Tis and Imperium news what you say was confirmed by alliance leaders.
---
It’s funny watching folks decide which, if any, narrative my original comment supports. 
---
Maybe there is no narrative.

That was the name of the dreadnought class launcher, iirc.

Really boring, tbf. For both Goons and PanFam.

Attackers roll mostly uncontested, but grind for hours, defenders cannot match attacker numbers and reside to catching stragglers in rare skirmish ops.

Thanks, Fozzie!

So its Syria then?

Are you fuckin kidding me? How many writeups/papers/posts have you read where references are given at the top, or even the bottom that matter? Maybe next time read the entire post before shitting in your own mouth and  vomiting on your keyboard thinking you are contributing.

op thought posting "i love you" in that thread wasn't a sufficient display of his feelings, so he decided to start this one instead.

I'm no bittervet bur you're still dumb

Berserkers with that Ishtar fit go about 3.1 km/s. They can keep up, but that's about all they can do

(it was a joke about big fleet fights where you'd black screen for hours)

If only they were actual players
---
Make sure you have EVE installed on a SSD for faster loading times, if you have one. But yeah, it's pretty bad.
---
Dreadnaughts weren't in the game to July 2005 so the launchers could have been named "citadel launchers" for those two or so years. Can't actually remember that far back, especially not a detail like that.
---
If you're getting the sensor overlay bug where things don't fully load (so you can't right-click -&gt; warp to them), hitting Ctrl-O twice usually fixes it. Don't do it too fast or it won't work. 
---
And yes, it's a very stupid bug which CCP has done nothing to fix. Same thing with "Show on map" not working for months and months.
---
AH ok my apologies then, As per the explanation from Robin, yes you can be banned by Steam for violating Steam's Terms of Use.
---
Remember when dead zone was only a few hours? Now it is 22 hours. Me either...
---
this would be like super cool if it made more than like 10 peoples lives better
---
this is correct, but you'll probably get away with it (probably)
---
To be fair - yes.
---
Shitadels turn d out to be far more cancerous.
---
Stop being poor nerd
---
&gt; original design was done flying by the seat of their pants
---
I'm pretty sure the POS system was my favorite bit of nonsense.  
---
&gt; "Guys, we can't change it because we have absolutely no idea how it works, and the guy that wrote it passed away.  It just works.  Kinda.  Give us a few years to figure out a full fledged replacement."
---
&gt;Am I missing something?
---
yes, an active subscription to a subscription based game.
---
I specifically remember you could fit a cruise launcher on an enyo, but you couldn't online it.
---
that's a painful fat finger right there.
---
screaming rmt
---
Dev time well spent, why fix a broken and boring game when you can add useless shit for the 20 ppl that use faction titans in a blob
---
Why would he take it so personally? It's not like people don't know that this is a game about people doing bad things to each other.
---
(Re)
---
Drones. Why do gallente have to train gunnery and drones? They don't even share the same map. At least caldari can be mapped per/wil and be done with it.
---
To make it worse ishtars are the hardest to fc and pilot hac in the game
---
Windows defender is safer and faster and it comes with the thing you already paid for. No extra snake oil needed.
---
I mean, a lot of people in this thread claim that it's their thing to avoid admitting who they really are in-game.
---
This is a fantastic post. Only odd part is where an archon fits a triage module. Would be nice
---
&gt;friendly
---
Looks like you're in CODE...
---
Injectors don't sell themselves
---
Hell, I would use this!!!
---
would we get free SP if we have literally all the missile skills trained? :P
---
good point about the map.
---
But you're also missing another point (admittedly I posted this in a different comment) - each race has **at least two** weapons platforms - gallente/amarr have hybrid/laser + drones, minmatar and caldari have projectile/hybrid + missiles.
---
Drones are kind of different. Yeah you have to train sentries and heavies, but you can also use them on smaller hulls too, not just BS size hulls, and vice versa. 
---
Minmatar and caldari however, are SOL. They need to train gunnery and missiles (and benefit from drones, too) which turns out to be three total platforms (gunnery + long/short missiles) as opposed to two (gunnery + drones).
---
Could you perhaps point to one of these instances then?
---
Rmt if a bit blatant
---
It'd probably depend on where he actually is located. The higher the price difference between the local steam store cost and the Russian one would most likely correlate to how closely valve will be watching.
---
I'm not saying its supposed to be one way or another, but every missile skill bonus affects the ammo (except for rate of fire bonuses).
---
In gunnery, every skill affects the turret.
---
The actual weapon for missile boats are the missile (the launchers are just tubes), while for turret boats the weapon is the turret. Sure, we can get into saying "Oh but a gun is just a tube for a bullet to shoot out of." which is true but only for projectile turrets. Hybrid turrets and lasers operate a bit differently.
---
So thats sorta my take on the design decision into why missile skills are as they are.
---
this\^\^\^\^ i though i was going crazy with the show on map not working...though i was the only one. expected a major reddit pitchfork madness but it never came
---
If you do it through CCP's site, maybe. Valve however dislikes when people buy from the Steam store outside of where they live in order to take advantage of lower prices or currency exchange rates. Why do they care? They aren't getting the same percentage as they would if the purchase was done normally.
---
Ewar frigs are an interesting topic.
---
    
---
Yes the tech 1 version can be easily piloted by a new player in larger fleets (Like:https://zkillboard.com/kill/77135289/) as a decent add to the fleet. Here their role is, for sure, to disrupt the other fleet. But more often they force the other fleet to primary them, thus buying time for the main firepower and logistics. So they can die very rapidly.
---
Tech 2 version, on the other hand, is rather hard to master. Honestly in big fleets it is not really ISK efficient to use the Tech 2 version (maybe excluding AB fit fleets like Goku). They suits small gangs better, and the pilot does receive lots of "Care" from the other small gang. To master them, the pilot usually needs have good skillpoints allocated on navigation, engineering (for cap) and e-war. They will also need to be really good with manual piloting, as the ships are usually tankless.
---
Ain't all prices the same now in all regions exactlybecause of this?
---
Opening and closing your market, probe window or turning overlay on/off fixes this for me. Only to have it happen in the next system over...
---
They probably slam invite everyone they see with a high tax rate
---
&gt;gained widespread popularity
---
&gt;Unfortunately At the time we should have realized through kermity stealing half the property on the server that maybe theft was sort of his thing -.-
---
I'm pretty new to the game and I started playing because of the crazy stories but I don't know that one. What did he do in *EVE*?
---
hahahaha
---
I'm not missing that point. I'm just not fully convinced the Amarr's secondary weapon really is drones. It seems to me they have more missile ships than drone ships. And I'm not really sure the Curse/Pilgrim/Arbitrator count since they are primarily ewar ships (dont get me wrong, the drone bonus is a great synergy with their role but its not the primary reason you bring a Curse)
---
Thank you for using the right BR tool
---
potato mode, now with real potatoes
---
👌
---
I *may* be missing something here, but isn’t that the same for *all* races? Caldari trains Rockets and Missiles, Gallente trains Blasters and Railguns, and so on
---
I believe you have just spotted a blue donut in the wild.
---
Don't matter as long as I am able the scan one down and make him come back in a new ship later.
---
Didn’t have to defend shit cause nobody could lock you out of markets and contracting. Couldn’t even get rid of your clones there.
---
You aren't limited to a single faction. CCP does not need to engage in symmetrical design between different factions because no player has to "train THREE weapon systems" as you say.
---
I recognize that this is a debatable point, but I feel that symmetry is almost universally a sign of bad game design. I really like that missile skills work a bit differently from turret skills.
---
Also worth noting, missile skills have the distinction that I can train the same skill (light missiles) and have a usable weapon system for both frigates (LMLs) and cruisers (RLMLs). When I was training weapons skills, I found it easier to train T2 missiles due to that overlap.
---
Yeah you could put oversized guns on.
---
But that's different than fitting cruise missiles into a small Launcher.
---
Ishtars shouldn't fight to faster enemy
---
If your steam account got banned then there is a likelihood your Eve account related to it will be banned as well
---
I don’t think you have any idea about what you are talking
---
Name an amarr missile-bonused boat that isn't a specific tech 2.
---
All the missile boats save maybe the Vengeance follow the same "It's not the primary reason you'd bring X".
---
post your in-game name and thou shall find out if you can get screwed.
---
His point is that light missiles and rockets are separate skills you need to train to 5, where blasters and railguns come from the same skill (hybrid turret 5).
---
Well... adding higher tier resist debuff will make stall kiting a superior option in abyssal PvP
---
Is it... good?
---
As far as i know every time they have removed skills they refunded the SP for them.
---
There’s almost nothing that’ll successfully kite an iki.. it can reach out to 55km and has a fairly high standard lock range.. it’s not too terribly slow on its own either so you’d have to be doing something like 3k+ms to try to kite one
---
the range on PDS is shit even when rigged
---
Earlier 1 player was able to empty the moons and you didn't have to waste the time of other players. "Extracting that wealth" means actively doing mining. I rather play other games. 
---
I played eve for almost 10 years but I don't even have mining skills on any character. I just have pvp skills. Earlier Eve was a sandbox where I was able to choose my playing style but lately the options have shrinked.
---
I think Ripard Teg wrote it better than I ever can:  
---
&gt;EVE gained its fame and its player base from being a sand box that welcomed every type of play. That's gone now, and only two types of game play are valued: hard-core PvE and hard-core massive alliance sov battles.
---
Alright, as far as I know, you cannot turn PLEX into any real life currency legally. If you do so, it is considered as Real Money Trading (RMT) which is prohibited by the EULA. In case you don't know yet, PLEX are a bit like a premium currency : they can be sold on the market for ISK, or be used to purchase in-game items, such as SKINs, Omega time or Skill Extractors.
---
The PLEX you have do not represent your current subscription. You can see when your subscription will end in your profile, on the [official site](https://secure.eveonline.com/accountmanmenu.aspx), under Subscription and payment. I don't remember any event gifting PLEX, and generally if you weren't active when those gifts where handed out, you might not have received them. As you said, you can use this PLEX to extend your current subscription using the New Eden Store. So long that you have 500 PLEX, you can buy 30 days of Omega. What you should do with the leftovers is yours to decide.
---
Nope, buying and selling characters is now legal ! However, you can't do it any way you like it, as there are still strong restrictions on this type of market. There is only one place where you can legally buy and sell characters : [the Character Bazaar](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/character-bazaar) on the official EVE Online's forums. If you want to sell or buy a character, it is mandatory to read those [rules](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/welcome-to-the-character-bazaar/71), as they'll prevent you from doing anything that could close your topic, or maybe make everyone think you're doing illegal things.
---
Now, there is indeed a new profession around Skill Injectors, which is called "SP Farm". Basically, someone train up a character so they have at least 5 millions skillpoints (you need this minimum to be able to extract skills), and then train up some short skills with high SP return, like Leadership skills and extract them once they're done, rinse and repeat. It is profitable, but you need a ton of characters to truly make a profit. Technically, extracting all the skills you had in a character to send the unallocated skillpoints to a new one isn't really interesting, as depending of the skillpoints the new character already have, you won't get the same amount of SP. As such, I don't recommend doing it, unless you're 100% sure of what you're about to commit.
---
All I mean is that Amarr isn't as fully committed to drones as Gallente is. Like you say, Amarr's secondary weapon is all over the place.
---
Hi olmeca,
---
Of course you will get my vote, you are the only one that see/wants the game the way i would enjoy it more.
---
Below are a few points that i would love ccp address to some point.
---
1. Gate decloak radius is just too close for constellations and regional gates, it should be equivalent to the size of the type of gate. The bigger the gate the further out you appear when you jump in.
---
2. Make it more expensive for every citadel you deploy in a system so that people are more interested in actually defend/attack them and avoid all spamming that dont lead to any content at all.
---
3. Generate a time penalty to anchor a new one for both attackers and defenders to deploy a new structure once one of theirs have been destroyed. If attackers lose a citadels they wont be able to deploy a new one for a determined time and vice versa.
---
4. Remove rorqs from the game, as long they exists the overwhelming number of titans wont drop and it will keep increase when you can buy a titan for 40b :(.
---
5. Make sure you cant deploy any beacon, ansiblex gate or similar on grid with other citadels, if someone is attacking it you have to form up to actually defend your assets.
---
cheers
---
Prim
---
No.
---
some real deluded panfam people here.
---
Either it’s a scam or someone made the kind of mistake I hope to benefit from at some point.
---
Oh
---
No but keep in mind that if you fail some data hacks in sleeper caches they can have negative effects. In standard sleeper caches failing data hacks and raise the alarm level which if it reaches 5 will trigger huge gas clouds that will destroy you pretty quick. And there's a room that will aggro 15 turrets if you fail the hack in the superior sleeper cache.
---
For reference for how much the turret room does my stratios with a 1600mm armor plate, an enam and a dcuii after 2 shots i was in 50% hull.
---
so why do you think small groups can take some of these 14 regions ? as i can remember 0sec power blocks always took everything and uses the not wanted region as a buffer towards enemys or just as a extra space to make it harder moving cap fleets in the home system .
---
And to the thing power blocks like Goons need 4-5 umbrellas i cant see a ig thing in getting 4-5 umbrella goons have over 900 titans so its not that hard to spread em .
---
 and in an other view if big alliances need 4-5 umbrellas the need 4-5 regions + maybe a buffer reagion ( just look in the drone lands)  there will be no space for small corps to get somthing 
---
moste people don´t understand 0sec was never made to give small groups sov and why would ccp change it its a good method to get in the news if you have redicolus big fights between power blocks
---
That's some salt ^^
---
Point in the doll where gotg hurted you
---
Its really cringe how you call it northern war II.
---
We actually don't want them. They are generating to much isk.
---
Would that not just trigger asset safety?
---
You should have held out for a better story. 10 bil over 2 years is weak. You could have made that in a month farmin trig sites. Instead you were in HS, failing to improve on any applicable skill sets, including theft.
---
A meme deployment? Is that BL/PH excuse (if you are really one member) ,for failling miserably to invade branch?
---
Gobbins said it would be taken in one month, we was what happened.
---
So yeah you dropped some fortizars, destroyed some cap and supercap and elo shows his bait-rag when you were all ready and DC was the weakest.
---
When you are loosing, do you say that isk war and zkillbord aren't important?
---
Yeah, it will probably be better to just win EVE completely. What fucking stupid concept is that anyway.
---
doomchinchilla would notice immediately from all the pubbies here @ing him "DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE RORQUAL CHANGES"
---
Just rmt to see here, move on people...
---
stealth bombers didn't fit those tho
---
they just fit regular cruise missile launchers
---
ironically I found it exactly the opposite once I got to battleship platforms, which are where most of the training takes place, since now I need to train for torps (close range solo pvp ships, stealth bombers) and cruise missiles (PvE, long range fleet PVP).
---
that's exactly the point.
---
But gallente trains "Hybrid weapons".
---
Caldari train "Light Missiles" and "rockets", "Heavy Missiles" and "Heavy Assault Missiles", "Cruise Missiles" and "Torpedoes"...
---
And? CODE. is here to save High Sec. What could be friendlier?!
---
&gt; Why is SkillU defending Tenal?
---
because skillu and panfam enjoy a cordial, professional relationship, and skillu fucking *hate* gotg. they don't so much care about our structures and stuff as much as they do about dunking idiots
---
It wasn’t about the story or the ISK, it came time for me to move on and I just took everything I could get my hands on.
---
Also there were no trig sites in 2016 bro.
---
WoW Classic is more hardcore then eve!!!!!!
---
&gt; Berserkers with that Ishtar fit go about 3.1 km/s
---
when they mwd, which is only for about 15 seconds. problem is muninns can just keep mwding
---
That was my other thought, but damn that's risky doing it through the market like that.
---
I always warn miners that if they keep shooting rocks, the rocks will one day fight back...
---
About capital proliferation
---
\- Give Bops or make a new BS class with anti capital role - be able to fit special anti- capital torps with good damage but -90% effective vs Structures and non capital ships, also lower Speed so capitals can defend aginst 2-3 of those. Now you would require not only to Jump your OP dong Super fleet but also support it with sub capital ships.
---
\- Give Rurq more tank but remove that stupid PANIC option, i mean WTF an capital that is indestructible ffs its stupid (yes im a rorq miner, still FU\*\* IT). 
---
\- Random Ore site spawns in Any system in a region, not just the same one each 4h, tht respawn time the longer the more are mined, like with jump fatique.
---
Pretty interesting stuff there. If memory serves me right, zkill didn't use to pull all kills from the old api, you had to manually give authorization? And it wasn't as widespread back in 2010, when battleclinic and the other kill boards were still around. But it's interesting to see how the game is doing, which doesn't seem to be all that bad. 
---
Now the only thing that could make this better would be data on the distribution of kills by sec status, ship type, number of participants etc, so we could also see the meta shifts. Great job op, thanks for the nice read!
---
pl mostly sat around and ate popcorn, a few of us took our meme supers to branch but there's a pretty big timezone mismatch so we didn't really get to do much. i think we killed a (singular) ratting nyx and that was about it
---
they need to load all the cloaky casmpers and logged off titans first
---
I'm not saying that your Space ISIS alliance is necessarily bad for the game. But the whole Space ISIS/suicide attacks thing isn't what I would consider friendly.
---
Depends how risky you deem loading that PLEX into a shuttle and letting it blow and then hoping for loot fairy to be kind. 
---
This market transaction almost seems too obvious and easily trackable for devs/gms. But then again, this is CCP... :D
---
And if it really is phat phingers, then RIP the seller. :)
---
gobbins is occasionally very publicly dumb
---
this is not news
---
I have seen weird market orders and ships absurdly full of valuables getting blown up as related to RMT, how does that work?
---
I have to admit, its a nice piece of propaganda
---
still overpriced
---
are you actually new enough that you don't know fax are a new thing and carriers used to be triage
---
It's in Stain, there's little risk of someone accidentally intervening and buying your stash-to-be-rmt'd
---
Because Fuck You, that's why.
---
&gt; various people trying to steal the Spire in drone lands?
---
unspoken and co have more or less given up, it's pretty much just muderous mindset left out there and they're getting squeezed pretty hard
---
Think of it as WoW dailies except it's the same pool of dailies for the past 10? years...
---
When you don’t like people shooting at an expandable hauler, so you bring in your expensive super to a fight...
---
PVE-fitted.
---
That’s Darwin’s laws right here ladies and gents !
---
Didn't know that was the MWD speed!
---
I guess your best ishtar option would be sentries, but you'd have a hell of a time tracking a competent muninn fc's fleet.
---
Muninns v. Ishtars in a nutshell I guess
---
I wondered that myself like hybrids split between rails and blasters, or artillery and autocannon.
---
That seems like more of a "paper trail" than giving them to someone physically in space.
---
It’s supposed to be a funny thing mate, we know our game is fucking broken. But eh, we can still dream.
---
INB4 the Revenant can just ram itself in an enemy Capital ship and do extra damage with the spikes !
---
Get the Krabs up north--keep killing their supers and titans.  More welps to the welp gods.
---
Enough people did stay to keep it going from 2003 until 2015. Enough to open 2 new studios at CCP and fund like 5 other projects. 
---
Since then CCP seems hell bent on changing the one thing EVE has always done better for things that dozens of other games do much better.
---
If you want a more reliable way of killing hookbills, play around with their rage rocket range. If you move out of 10-12 kms, you can force them to reload and move back in afterwards to win the dps race easily.
---
For 70b poverty  fit titan yes
---
They did apparently clear out all the buy orders in Stain to accomplish this
---
Can you get it where you can warp disrupt someone, then hit them with range damps so they can't do anything to you?
---
Happy potato day! And have some Reddit bronze

Thanks for sharing an idea you've had

There was a second?

Thats just misdirection  we are winning one sabre at a time.

Well he worked in QA, so goons weren't the first to steal his hopes and dreams
---
Funny thing is, that is exactly what happens next in this episode of mr Bean.
---
He walks up to the wreck, finds that the padlock he used to lock the door escaped the carnage, pockets that padlock and walks away contentedly and smiling.  
---
Didn't want that car anyway.
---
I knew that this API was not really correct. I just hopped that the overall idea would be conserved on such high numbers
---
The issue is indeed that I could not find an API that would send out paginated results.
---
The ESI is fine and all, but you need individual authorization from all players to pull from their API. The true numbers would of course be in CCP's servers :p
---
You mentioned another API than the ESi?
---
Will have a look at it, thanks!
---
Yeah, it's frustrating cause the data I have is already aggregated on a daily level, and getting the KM details would be a pain of consecutive requests :s
---
how dare you buy in a cheaper store
---
I only started playing last year, for me there was only Zkillboard XD
---
Yes didn't you know ? depending on your location and your faction there are quest hubs all over Azart .... New Eden so plus there's raiding when you feel like you can step up there's LF .... Invasions and every few weeks we am getting a new difficulty with better loot.
---
Message me in game The_Mittani if there's anything l can help you together we can make Azart ... New Eden great again.
---
Yeah, aren't we on about #5 or 6 now?
---
So the increase we observe from 2010 onwards might also be zkillboard gaining popularity?
---
Add a random 0% resist hole after a certain time. Whoever reacts faster gets to win. Ez

cutting edge comment here
---
skillu fucking hate TAPI too
---
short life expectancy for an alliance there tbh
---
The timeline wasnt clear in your wall of text
---
.... bro....
---
If it wasnt about the story, why bother with the post. It looks to a third party (myself) like you're trying to join the ranks of actual thievers.
---
Yep... Just I am stupid . Let you get this.
---
Market history is never to be taken at face value. It's completely unreliable especially for low volume markets. 
---
That being said it doesn't mean that this didn't happen.
---
The Arkham Asylum of mmo gaming
---
On the other hand you really want drones for gallentean ships
---
Can you imagine if you could do PI with an alpha toon? The autistic alpha PI farms would explode and crash goes the market...
---
More like The Joker
---
thank you for agreeing,
---
op chose to go for the higher possable amount to build somthing than the lower, meaning the numbers were biased. which is the only thing wrong here.
---
other than your all missing my point.
---
And the relevance to EVE online, if any?
---
Fuck wrong subreddit :/
---
Missile skills tree has been unchanged even before injector. heck it may even before PLEX.  Missile skills does not 'nestle', e.g., you don't need to learn light missile before learning heavy missile, unlike turret skills.
---
you showed on more than few BR's congrats on participating.
---
well the op had included structures owned by non panfam groups.
---
he included fucking pocos (i know right what a reach) which add just as much 'loss' to goonswarms bank as panfams. (i presume theyre placing more)
---
the meaningless subcaps lost in tribute amount to 100's of billions lol how can this be meaning less.
---
most of these structures are privatly owned, so tell me, why is this an alliance loss for panfam?
---
i mean you say stuff in delve dying is also meaningless because its not an alliance loss.
---
Consider me complimented, sir.
---
well, your almost there. goons are so big, that invading comes at a cost. the cost im talking about here,
---
moving the large forces costs alot, having them not earn money costs alot. so when they invade, they better realise that it can be accountable losses. and for any goon to say nah it doesnt count, your a fucking moron
---
For ZKILL total kill, you have already dailly kill.
---
You just has to ad a request for all npc kill and remove this number. You do'nt check all KM. So maybe 1 more requestday/npc faction. Not a big deal. 
---
FOR CCP  we have numbers already with KM detail, don't need to request they.
---
ive said many times, count both times. NC/PL arnt known for they're insane income numbers pre-deployment.
---
i agree both sides should be counted like you say, the problem is goons are counting one side only, not their own
---
Shhhh child you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
So starting in July then?
---
they wouldnt want to make russians angry
---
i mean, you cant find the war declerations in game if you had any idea?. the horde war has now ended. i think it ended with about 900billion isk lost on both sides.
---
i checked the goon-NC. war last night and goons have caught up quite alot, it was roughly 320bill to 390bill in NC.'s favour
---
so getting alot closer with the structures and shit. 
---
standard wardec mechanics is you cannot transfer structures while at war.
---
Read the new feature list from the last couple of years and then try convince me that CCP aren't satanists...
---
Be in a Corp:
---
* You go to jita, insta-dock already made just warp to it.
---
* You want to fight, three dudes come along for shits and giggles. You find four thrashers, it is a fair fight. 
---
* You undock, corp intel tells you where the gate camp is today.
---
Playing eve solo is like building you own home and making every brick your self, pointless unenjoyable and time consuming. Join a corp and use its resources even if you do not want to socialize with them.
---
D&amp;D series when ?
---
\~three fiddy
---
best we can muster? just because you dislike the facts doesnt mean theyre any less meaningful as a 'loss' 
---
infact nothing about this would have been said at all before goons just tipped the edge of 'look we are killing thingys'
---
sticking completly unrelated structures into structures killed lists etc etc
---
Is Horde okay with people who aren't newbies flying ewar frigates? I am looking for a nullsec corp to join and figured that in Horde I would be able to have some fun in my favourite ewar ships (got almost max skills in jams and damps), but most of the time had been told by FCs to fly logi, dps or gtfo.
---
In his defense, he's having better content than in north.
---
Collecting useless killmails while their anus gets pushed in up north. How manly.
---
not sure if troll or just stupid
---
That other dude is going to have to list another 500 poco's and mobile depots in his structure thread now for morale
---
Gonna be a sad day when Goonie Goons comes and wipes you guys out next. Because let's be real your moral is PL/NC once they fold it's over for Horde.
---
They were explicitly to replace old POS Mechanics, Outposts were a collateral
---
There's no reason that they can't use the same ECM drones to jam you too with that argument.... which you'll probably lose out on because Iki has more sensor strength that you, but they won't do that because now you can't fit hammerheads into your drone bay which you'll probably need to actually clear the site in time. Also Iki can fit nos or neuts. Also Iki has better tank, its faster, has better cap, does more damage, with better range... it's better in every way. Except cost. It costs about 50 times as much, so you probably shouldn't fly one.
---
Well then we can just rename null to imperiumsec and all be on our merry way to the next game :p
---
Do some research before posting crap next time. What you describe only works inside wormholes. If you unanchor Hisec Citadels, all goes to asset safety.
---
Are you a keyboard turner?, if so... that might be why...
---
Don't waste you're breathe on this guy. He clearly has no idea what he's talking about.
---
&gt; I guess your best ishtar option would be sentries, but you'd have a hell of a time tracking a competent muninn fc's fleet.
---
even post-nerf, ishtar sentries have bullshit tracking
---
the real difficulty is that there's really no incentive for the muninns to fight you from a position where your sentries can hit them
---
you sure about that
---
In a 1v1 fight, with a marauder vs a Leshak, I would bet on the Leshak hands down.
---
What does CODE. think about miners attempting  to have their ships mate with a rock? Is a permit required for this activity?
---
Nothing to see here just 400b worth of plex being sold for 90k isk, no RMT no sir
---
Suppose I should hurry this along and resub and help push it along. So we can all leave this shit game
---
you want drones for all ships, even missile boats. possibly especially missile boats \*glares in explosion velocity\*
---
wait, you named the toons "AsicMiner"? haha :D I like it.
---
you can opt for the 'geddon because missile/drone/neut combo on armor; it's not bonused for missile, i agree, but it makes a decent missile platform if you want an armor tank
---
Literally the first 2 lines
---
&gt;Seeing the post about eve players improving other alliance based mobile games with our unique sociopathic style of game play reminded me of my own little heist in my early days of EVE.
---
I started playing at the beginning of 2014, about 5 days before the battle of B-R5RB. I wanted to shoot at space rocks and go space trucking, start a manufacturing empire and get rich.
---
Having eve on a ssd won't fix the blackscreen at all
---
That is some hull damage....
---
/me says in a high pitched voice "Potato!"
---
corpses should reprocess into isotopes - the faction isotope their character picked. :D
---
My Eve moment is when I undock from station in lowsec slightly after DT and saw not one but two Marauders (Kronos and Golem) on dscan. Quickly check on the location, they were on one of the anomalies. I thought to myself, surely must be bait. No one is dumb enough to bring marauder to anom in lowsec.  We only have one corpmate online.  We undocked T1 BS. I used a Tempest. We told each other, we are at worse going to lose two T1 BSes. We warp to site and found the two Marauders in siege. Between me and my corpmates, we had 3x heavy neuts.  Primary golem and put two of the neuts on Kronos. Surprisingly Golem broke fast.  After it died we switched to Kronos. It also died pretty quickly under 3 heavy neuts. My first ever Marauder kills. And one of the marauder had an officer mod. Unfortunately it did not drop. But the two KMs are worth more than any mods... That was two years ago. And I still remember the incident.
---
Agree with [ewarfordanktears](https://www.reddit.com/user/ewarfordanktears/) ... who gives a flying f#ck about faction titans
---
I´m a Member of a Power 0Sec Alliance and i don´t think you have t split up umbrellas i think the way to go is to make it more risky to use your super/cap fleet.
---
The main problem right now is the giant rise in Super/cap force for every powerblock. Its easy for big alliances to provide multiple umbrellas if really needed but there is no need today.
---
i think you as a " wahler " got only a really strikt view on things in 0 sec. you point out the only Rorquals are the problem and supers ratting. (supper ratting isnt the main money maker in 0sec) and it looks like your are not willing to accept other ideas to solve problems as your own.
---
I think they way to solve it is to increes normal pvp los in 0sec (the mineral loss of 1 rorq isnt that much) even with your magical 15% there are still 85% minerals left to grow the supercap fleets. but if you need to use the minerals to rebuild subcap fleets or lost cap fleets the groth wont be so fast anymore.
---
i hope you can accept critic and try to see the things with other eyes and maybe ready to compromise with other ideas 
---
sorry for my bad englisch i'm not a native speaker
---
I like the basic idea, it might need some tweaking.
---
lol too bad its nullsec
---
More like 10k members and 40k alts.
---
Different ammo. Also I remember hams being added too the game.
---
It does not fix it, but it certainly helps you load the game faster.
---
tfw legacy code is uncommented and the dude fuckin died
---
Lol those guys miss the point. Communities of games like Overwatch are dicks playing the game about being nice, Eve is a bunch of nice guys playing the game about being a dick.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
People would stash stuff in POSes despite running the risk of losing it.
---
People in wormholes use citadels despite no asset safety.
---
Just get rid of it, it goes against Eve most fundamental tenets.
---
You need to enable "Invading Ships" or something, it's dumb they have it named that.
---
Reddit is shit
---
For most non gallentean ships you get away with small drones tho
---
Train cyno 5 and cloaky camp be who you were made to be.
---
Why then even mention it? This is not about bad hardware, that post is about a blackscreen which isn't avoidable no matter you hardware.
---
Before ramming, ask if their tetanus shot is up to date...
---
Why ?
---
EWAR frigs are so strong. once you learn how to pilot in general, and learn priority targets your golden.
---
if what your asking for is a ship a newplayer can get into a fuck over an entire fleet. shocker you want that, but i sure hope it doesnt happen xD
---
a Keres can SERIOUSLY change fights, defend allies in small gang, ruin logi reatction times.
---
a Griffin can destroy an enemies long range webs, enemy EWAR, logi cap chains.
---
a Sentinel can be on of the most powerful frigs as Neuting is like, the meta for ewar
---
a Hyena in larger groups can really change the effect of certain loudouts like caracal fleets etc etc.
---
it all about doing those things and not dying the the enemy frigs and screeners.
---
probably he wanted to get into mining business but he figure out is way too hard and he switched to multiboxing 150 Eve accounts.
---
If you're using python to hit zkill, look into the Multiprocessing library. You can use that to spawn subprocesses which will execute a task and then die, which can speed it up a lot. 
---
If you decide to do this, you should probably speak to Squizz and get his okay first. He might also be able to get you the data in an easier way.
---
So the Titanic II is a large, valuable ship taking a predictable path through a dangerous area.  
---
Whose fleet do I join for the suicide gank?
---
ask horde, or say when you apply to somewhere you want the specificly practice in ewar frigs, at times they might say you dont get SRP because they would rather you in a doctrine ship?
---
whenevr ive seen PH specificly on field theyve had 20% frigs and shit just because
---
I will try to contact the guy directly, yeah, sounds like a better idea than hammering his API with subsequent requests XD
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
All good mate best of luck.
---
Looking forward for when they bait you for that titan that was part of the dread bomb...
---
well, even better: NSA-fitted. I guess you might also catch him in sites..
---
train one into a super and then you can solo kill them, otherwise your best bet is just cloaky camping and joining a group that will form for the targets, e.g. bombers bar, panfam, volta, etc
---
Yes she was bombed by the Germans in ww2
---
i agree, but that's kind of like putting projectiles on a drone boat because fitting/capacitor requirements, it's more of a bonus.
---
Nag was also gun/missile platform same for phoenix.
---
I mean, since citadels got basically all outpost services over time, from markets over fitting and clone bays to insurance, i wouldn't say that holds true.
---

Just because someone kills whales doesn't mean they are a pet of anyone.

You could still sell stuff from the outside, though. Incidentally a common firesale price to go with was 10-15% under jita afaik. At least by the lazy.
---
We prefer calling it a ritual sacrifice.

Lmao, they are definitely goons.
---
Cant crash into an iceberg if we melt the fuckers first

Actually bashing uncontested structures is an improvement comparing to shooting at space rocks all day long.

Ah nice advice man thanks :)

Tbh ive seen decent amount of ppl roleplaying. Dont worry about that, eventually you will end up roleplaying anyways.
---
morale have never been better, why wouldn't it. Content everywhere

Don't forget he will factor in all the T4 that was in those POCOs that his Recon guys had been watching for X months, and just add that figure along for the tally since that's what was really lost after all.
---
Who cares?
---
I'm not a goon.
---
And you still forgot about wh, and the fact that the war is far from over. But you already came to the conclusion that goons fought harder in wwb lmao

it Covers the entire tether area, preventing any shenanigans.
---
I mean they wanted to recreate something to replace POS shields. Just tying it to the outpost replacement was a terrible decision imo.
---
They weren't able to recreate POS shields I suppose. Because tether is shit in comparison. Just the combination with dockable structures makes it cancer.
---
Sir, here is my upvote :D
---
Wasted potential of a thread; you could have stirred up some actual drama if you weren't as terrible at posting as you are.

It must be difficult to live a life of such polar extremes. What do you do when your local ice cream parlour runs out of your favourite flavour ice cream? Threaten to burn the place to the ground?

how nice it is to see a goon pleeding for damage cap removal xD

I heard they don’t like Judy mikkaka more though. And doom chimp chilla. Watch out PLNC!

Eve 2019. Brave pilot loses a Machariel because the enemy brought frig ewar.
---
Hell, in ye olde beginning, there was no "assault" version of missiles. Just rockets, light, heavy and torpedo (I think, cant recall whether cruise missiles were in yet).
---
Also - torpedoes used to do AoE-damage. Unfortunately, this was changed pretty quickly, but still, a fantastic unique effect. A remote smartbomb, basically. Wonder if they'll ever revisit it.
---
here is proof that skill injectors allowed hisec carebears to join goons, i mean join nullsec....wait

Now do muslims.

But on the other hand, we could have a palatine keepstar.

In this moment I am euphoric.

Justin count yourself lucky we don't have learning skills anymore and move on with your life lol

There was also a 3rd sister ship that people never remember about. It was scrapped after years of service.

What a shit music

No i didn't you illiterate fool.

Nice, more frozen corpses for the collection.

lmao retard, go back to your parents basement and stay there

I really want to comment on this to tell you what Sledgehammer and I have planned, but I'm afraid you're going to have to wait and find out. I will say, though, that there will be more than two parts to this invasion, so if you're let down once, that doesn't mean you'll be let down forever. ;)  
---
In the meantime, though, enjoy the content! We've been watching.
---
Join a corp and work with people. It makes it a lot more possible.
---
There's a few corps out there that specialise in whaling.
---
plenty, there is spectre fleet, friday night yarr, bjorn bees fleets, redemption  roam, fun inc.
---
If you join spectre fleet discord, they have links to all of the above.
---
The olympic

Damn hoped for some popcorn stuff, need to rethink this and try harder.

ps.           
---
If they don't have my ice cream, ill fire them.
---
HMMMMMM
---
At least crab alliances can field them in significant numbers. I bloody hate the things. Never owned one
---
Use the sin or a curse and hunt DED runners. Nuet out their tank. Let the site kill them. Use alts for scouting since finding them can be a pain
---
It's a nice meme, but pulling 100+ bil in rigs from a single sotiyo is worth a mention.
---
because normally 1 person in the alliance did the moons, it would take maybe 30 minutes a week. 
---
mining like 14 moons takes well a full play session of multiple people don't well don't want to do it. 
---
let alone the nearby people that will come and kill your rorqs that generally left a random r32 or r16 alone because it wasn't worth the effort to keep owning.
---
lmao, you guys, still doing Abyssal pvp?
---
Snuff is just shadow alts anyways..
---
Sorry my dear Frank I currently winning eve :p
---
Place one of your alts in an alliance/corp that is blue to your intended targets. Use it to gather intel. Then, make a plan to catch the whales with whatever resources you have (dread alts/sabre pilots etc.)  
---
Bonus points if you don't have to burn(=unmask) your spy to get your kills.
---
If you say so mate. Since only you guys have said so. Lol.
---
At this point yeah, even more if he’s perma running the NSA. That’s just a free floating kill mail !
---
Which would be nice ! Moar Sansha’s Ships !
---
If you Russian. No
---
If you are not Russian. Maybe.
---
not really quite the same thing.
---
Or create another alt. (Reddit one)
---
:thinkingface:
---
We mention it because you guys care enough to pull 100 bil in rigs lol
---
Popping in to say /Meowtiger is correct.
---
Stealth Bombers used to use Cruise Missiles instead of Torpedos. They were used as a sniping platform with 200km+ range back then.
---
Shit happens dude, better luck next time.
---
Why cant they just trade?
---
FC we are now running a rorqual dropping fleet rather than a covert dropping fleet
---
absolutely the same, we are opressed by steam and forced to pay the high price
---
Not even close to the same thing mate.
---
Welcome to EVE.
---
Uh, Oh. I hope he doesn't have a phone.
---
Seems to be on there now
---
oh, I'm a regular on BB fleets ;) I think you missed the whole Asic Miner thingy? I have to admit I'm not good at reading between the lines on the interwebz...
---
Proved again thanks
---
So this is what bowel cancer sounds like.
---
There were 3 Olympic-class ships, Olympic (launched 1911), Titanic (1912) and Britannic (1915). History of Titanic is well known. Britannic has been used as hospital ship during WW1 and was sunk in 1916 after hitting a mine. Olympic, the oldest one, severed also in WW1 even sinking an enemy submarine. It was decomisioned in 1935 and scrapped in 1937.
---
It was a good video.
---
Sorry, not sorry about any imaginary friends.
---
Another propaganda post. Nice
---
Who is mining who?
---
No you're not, nobody does! Knowing this, there's only one reasonable thing to do -&gt; resub now and join the good guys ;)
---
 eve playerbase turns to shit everything it touches
---
The difference is massive. Especially the minmatar and caldari command dessies suffer from very poor dps.
---
Yup! That’s also a viable fit, I am just not someone who is super good at kiting so I stick to the brawling fits.
---
Do u still dribble like a retard when you think of arsehole ?
---
says ccp is a satanic cult in a blog that looks like an occultist site from 2007

And we all lost count how many rorqs get dunked in provi on a monthly basis :'D

HOW
---
Pandemic is eating shit, because their own choises.
---
You don't only backstabbed allies, but bullied on small independent groups. Now, you have no one to counter blue Goons.
---
It could be cool multiple front war, almost every mayor Alliance taking part on this... But no one will help you just because, isnt Goons who roll over you now, it's the karma. You have the "honor" to be one of the most toxic groups on EvE. 
---
You don't want to play the imperium building game. Well, it is one. If you want to play the small barbaric tribe weak side rol, so be it. You reap, what you sow. Just don't cry about it. You wanted to play this kind of game, enjoy! 
---
High Sec is waiting for you. Don't worry. You don't need to play imperium building there.
---
Cheers
---
What system are you in? 
---
People might want to fly across and look at your fit, maybe give you some tips in person.
---
NPSI has the same relationship with RC/HTP as it does with the rest of eve. Neutral, however, as said previously, we will work with anyone who is looking to achieve the same objective as us. If our fc's see RC/HTP whilst not running a similar objective if its not purple shoot it! We would expect nothing less from them.
---
I'll take that as a no.
---
Nice try bombers bar &gt;:0
---
Thanks :)
---
&gt;:3
---
Use nid or thanny, they have better bonuses for ratting
---
Been trying to gt our alliance to use EWAR frigs for new guys for a bit now. No sucess. Rather yell at newbros for not having docterine fits. O well thats eve...
---
I too joke about my ban evasions.
---
&gt; and there's no way we should have 3000 Titans. A majority of those Titan pilots are only a few weeks old which is complete bullshit when I, a player for no less than 6 months, don't have a Titan. 
---
you realise they are alts of vets who have forked out tens of billions of ISK for injectors right? They're not brand new players just getting into titans...
---
Players &lt;2 years old are not allowed anywhere near supers by half competent alliances...
---
Naah man, they are leet pvp dudes. They only drop on miner and pve vessels when the blue intel is rock solid.
---
Yes, the thought of you makes me moist.
---
L'orca tank Hull.
---
&gt; You have no idea what you're doing, but suddenly, comms is quieter, and there's one cool calm voice giving out orders. You find an enemy fleet, and the order to engage is given. Your fleet loses a few ships; they lose more. They start warping out. Comms goes wild.. "spread points, spread points". You happen to tackle a ship, through more luck than anything else... 
---
This was pretty much what got me hooked on this game. I remember flying a shitty little newbean Merlin given to me free by an NBI in PH. Everyone else was in these badass ships called Hurricanes and I sword to myself I would fly one of them soon. Then the FC (tgl3) starts calling, 'all tackle burn to desto go go go go' and my heart started racing. I can't even remember what it was that we tackled and killed now, but I will always remember that feeling.
---
I've had black screens on undock for 5 years now it's not something new...
---
Ok, I’ll get a Nid then.
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
---
That too.
---
Aren't goon saying a km is a km even a poco ?!
---
Then why a super should be an useless killmail.
---
After that... you seems to be real close to north buttholes for being able to monitor their holes like that. 
---
Does this mean you probably are an a**hole ? Who knows !?
---
In Horde everyone can fly ewar frigs if he wants. Never been in a fleet where people were called out because of that. But if you want to fly ewar cruisers you should ask the fc. I'm there for about a year now and still fly crucifiers every now and then.

Right click, add to overview

---
They are not the same  
---
However, people living in countries from the bottom of the list are usually better paid for their work. (Except Ukraine and India, feels bad)
---
i dont get why they dont just jetcan and abandon the can and have who ever loot it
---
Biggest thing is make sure your fighters are always moving, use W-click just before the current target dies to move it to the next target. If you don’t do this you will lose fighters. I’d suggest only using t1 fighters until you’re good at this.
---
sound some thing that ccp would do
---
It’s pretty funny to drop HAW dreads or Meme carriers on blobs of excavators. 
---
But if you are restricted to stealth bombers then 4-5 should be plenty to lope around and bomb the excavator groupings. The was a fella in Delve who was pretty consistent with it.
---
train them to rorquals and start actually playing eve
---
cannot be closer pal
---
&gt; Earlier 1 player was able to empty the moons and you didn't have to waste the time of other players.
---
Or to recast it, you should get wealth with no effort and almost no risk.
---
On the other hand you are getting more money having the same job as people in poor countries. So it balances it out.
---
If it's Stain then it's RMT
---
you find a place where stuff is cheaper and buy there
---
and by byuing in cheaper places i help their economy to reach the level of my economy and thus ascend
---
I\`m Russian. Send me plex and I'll double it!
---
well the numbers i posted were in the span of a couple weeks, so its not that much lower than those tbh, but i don't claim they're not as bloody or as big as the previous ones, they just can't be ignored because of that.
---
what are you trying to say
---
Hahahahahaha I was just talking with some people about this dude yesterday / day before, I need to start some over/unders for these guys.
---
That needs an immediate investigation.
---
Buying omega in Russian,  Uruguayan or  Costa Rican steam store won't really help their economies. Steam is american company after all.
---
Use the correct damage type fighters for the rats you killing.
---
Bind a key to select your fighters.
---
Bind a key to deselect your carrier.
---
Bind a key to the orbit command.
---
Once you warp into a site start aligning to your citadel and launch your fighters. Once fighters are out, deselect your carrier and select your fighters ( you will  know if your carrier is still selected, there will be a blue orb around your capacitor and HP bars). Have your fighters orbit an enemy. Use guns on everything below a BS. Use one rocket salvo on BS. When the target is about to die, order your drones to orbit the next target. Repeat.
---
It will take a few sites to get used to this and you might lose a few fighters before you get the hang of it. 
---
It would be smart to have some support drones preferably dromis for frigates that might tackle you if you are dumb and not paying attention. 
---
Fitting wise, you can Google that shit.
---
Are you actually retarded, Stainguy?
---
What i said. Concept of having to play with multiple acc to be considered worthy is totally on its head and in fact has been the biggest hurdle for me to enjoy the game (and i am sure i am far from alone in this). I was quite hoping that in wh space it will be different than in null, but as this part is the same and it is what bothers me most about EVE, i might as well win completely and be done with this.
---
for L1 to 3 the wreathe is propably the best choice. Just fit med slots with tank and the lows with inertia stabilizers/cargo expanders (as much cargo as you need, rest stabs). I think cloak is omega, so just fit whatever in highslots(Tractor/salvager).
---
Align times are insane.
---
But that's what we do in Wormholes.
---
Are you referring to the M-O sotiyo?
---
Want a better Revenant-specific Doomsday?
---
Using horribly inefficient Hivelink-based technology, the Revenant can focus all of its transmission equipment on a single enemy ship to hack/suborn it. What does this mean in practice? The Doomsday requires drone/fighter bandwidth to transmit the sequence, probably half of the Revenant’s capacity, and *may* deactivate all other high-slot modules during the runtime, but...
---
Either the targeted ship goes dead in space (if you go this route, the disabling effect could potentially be an AoE), or the *Revenant* goes dead in the water- the Revenant pilot is unable to activate or deactivate any modules, or direct any fighters, because they don’t have access to their own ship, *but assumes direct control of a single target ship*.
---
From a long time ago low-sec fleet duels

Is this 2016?

&gt;if you wanted to make isk you mined asteroids in the asteroid belts
---
And you mined with whatever had the biggest cargo old and turret points because there were no dedicated mining ships.
---
u baited them into giving them money?
---
Nice, im interested in doing that, i have great skills for all around tengu in my alt. Could you share a good fit for tengu to run DED, also where should i look for them? Low sec, ns?
---
They seem to hate everyone equally.
---
Where the fuck is Lenny?
---
Quality shitpost right there!
---
The marauder should win since they get more cargo for cap boosters, have an easier time stacking heavy neuts, and can rep much more cap efficiently.
---
hmmm interesting. I may not agree, but I understand now. Is there a way to adapt to the new situation? rent out the moons, come to terms with neighbors to not gank rorqs, hire miners to mine r64s etc?
---
You obviously are not familiar with 4D tick tack toe.

This is texas law, level of play.

You cant excav bomb with 5 accounts you need at least 8. 6 is the min amount to guarantee excav kill from bombs w/o paints, you also need a hunter (having only 1 would be a problem) you also need a bidger. 
---
I am a whaler with 5 accounts as well which gives you a lot of capabilities to help participate in a small group of like minded people. Solo is extremely difficult in the current meta while working with another 5-10 people give you all the tools you need to create situations for whale kills.

All I got out of this is that you are a drunk with shit money management. Congratz, I guess?

Many of the people who were initially banned for RMT and money laundering now have alts within Pandemic Horde.

That's actually a pretty neat idea. The amount of systems you suggest is just right. Also no need to use gates, just introduce some permanent wormholes linking the constellations together. You'd still have to scan them down, they'd still have mass limit. But the moment you collapse one, you can scan down another one immediately heading to the same system.
---
It would probably make hole control (or constellation control in this case) a real headache unless you have plenty of people to live in those holes.
---
let the rmt flow through you

And nobody left playing the game to enjoy it

What a shame to die like this really.
---
Never met anyone either... you are not alone in your endeavour.
---
1 major flaw, those payments are to someone who didn't get banned for rmt and also didn't have access to arbitrarily add isk to your site account.

That is the most half assed attempt at hiding an irl name I've seen...
---
Ooooooooooo neat

Yes I am! Learn something new every day

I would also like to know

Now kiss

I You find yourself in a situation where you should run, leave your fighters behind and call them back, when you land at your citadel or whatever. They will warp to your ship.

When you train lasers, only amarr ships can use them. Missiles unlock you so many ships from all races, bombers etc. It is clearly the best of all weapons (not counting drones). I feel ok with it taking longer to train. Also, I got them all to 5, if you think your gonna have it easy after I went through hell!!!!

You still can loose expensive stuff easily. Look what happen in delve and in north.

I am one from the very lowest ones. But yes, the price tendency like that looks more fair than a plain base price.
---
Nevertheless, I thought I heard that they changed all priced to be around 15$ for all countries. However, that might only be the direct subscription and not via steam or I just plain misheard.

Winning a war! We are not winning the goon war. We are winning the right war, the real war. The only counting war. We are so great, the greatest alliance in the universe. True heroes

You mean I can trade $$$ for ISK?  Buy some PLEX now!
---
Not on a first date
---
Because that's traceable too.
---
Even if not by much, the market one has a slightly higher deniability of intent.
---
To put it simply, yes. I did it to have proof that they were doing RMT. I had the money to spare so why not?
---
considering their open door policy im sure theres plenty of people that have done bad things that have new accounts in horde
---
Why would somebody lie about being a casino war criminal and then make up a story about CCP removing their isk?
---
That is an understatement my friend.
---
At the moment Caldari are making bank on FW missions.
---
If I remember correctly, the most you are asked to haul in a L3 is 450m3.  I was doing them in a Probe with one cargo expander.  Then scanning for sites on my way back.
---
Yes, it was some time ago.
---
I haven't seen him since Vegas.
---
Are you selling?
---
aha and u realized that was your genius plan 4 years after sending them the money?
---
I was a IWISK banker and can confirm that every banker had their isk removed but no bans. There were only 2 RMT bans from what I recall.
---
Ahh speaking of class. I thought name. But thanks for the fact of the day :)
---
Well it is a public name that is linked to his Twitch account. Just donate to the PayPal link and you can see his name.
---
Is it just me curious to know what the guy did to fuel this?
---
I've done that as well. Those names were turned over to CCP.
---
Sounds like you bought a lot of isk? What are your in game achievements from all that wealth?
---
&gt;I was a IWISK banker and can confirm that every banker had their isk  removed but no bans. There were only 2 RMT bans from what I recall. 
---
That is one hell of a back-pedal, I think you just broke Doomchinchilla's record.
---
I suppose. I was throwing out my Eve books this morning and figured I'd make post. Like I said, most people won't care. It was for people who might like to know or hadn't heard the story.
---
could be interesting to exclude all fighter kills since they were implemented to get an accurate representation of the current disaster
---
Too young... More like,

Moooom, get me a six pack and a pack of cigarettesz
---
The “Terrible Posting War” is most fitting.
---
Bankers weren't banned, numb nuts.
---
Doesn't count we weren't defending him.
---
Nothing of note. I gained isk and kept records of it all. I gave most of it away to other people.
---
Full dps , full application, no tank fit is great (1 capital SE is enough). Chim is bad take a thanny instead.
---
Dont put nsa for ratting now, always stay align.
---
You're right.
---
Something tells me that's not the kind of hardcore OP was talking about th9ugh.
---
Make sure to deselect your carrier, you’ll know when theres a blue ring round the capacitor, if you dont when you tell your fighters to orbit, the carrier will try orbit the target too, removing you from aligning to a safe, you can deselect by control right click the capacitor

So you bought and snitched?

---
Are you gonna repost this garbage every couple of months?
---
nullsec kills count toward it too. the fact you have only caught up to what i was referring to is shocking.
---
somthing so basic and you completly ignore it.
---
ingame mails are by no mean accurate, however they are not accurate for both sides.
---
and zkill does allow you to see the war spec live with zkills values (which are also not spot the fuck on) because of a consistantly changing market.
---
but its a good way to follow subcap kills.
---
My digital war ship can eat your digital warship.
---
Now you have talked yourself into a corner. You just said that there was "only 2 RMT bans" that you can "recall". Unless you were one of the people banned or have second hand knowledge thereof how would you know if they were not bankers? IWISK was one of the largest if not THE largest RMT and Laundering operations in the history of this game. It took teams of trained security professionals to untangle the mess and you are telling us that you have the inside track on who was banned, for what and when? 
---
Spare me snowflake... You are nobody. The only reason anybody here will remember you is because you beat doom's record on rhetorical footbullets.

Goon carebear training war
---
I have to agree with Yonis here... so ok, you did it to get proof of they doing RMT, let's buy that. What did you do with that? Tell people about it after years of IWISK being banned along with most of the bankers that "worked" there?
---
Really?
---
Trimarks would have helped, or running resists. Yeah, if you hit warp when the bubble's deployed you lose speed for one tick. That's a thing. If you don't see the interdiction sphere, or the dictor, fix your overview.
---
Ok.
---
So the Sotiyo was definitely going to die.
---
And you’re mad they made the killmail less shiny?
---
Set up your binds. Keep fighters orbiting. Align out. Pulse the NSA (do not leave it running, you can't warp or dock when it is).  Train into a nidhoggur
---
Rekt.
---
no? I dont give a shit about killboards, but panfam clearly do.

*X) the 0.01 ISK war...
---
Returning player here: Eve clinic or what it was called was shut down before i left. are there places where people post and discuss loadouts? 
---
Looking for DED Tengu, Gila/Droneboats, Loki, Legion loadouts.
---
Yes, it does rather sound like a win-win. We get some kills and you get to leave the anomalies for a bit.
---
Eh? How do you get that?
---
Why leave the rigs in if it’s definitely going to die except to make you happy you got a shinier killmail? Why care about what they do except that you’re mad you didn’t get a shinier killmail?
---
Right, and goons don't care at all, which is why they tell all their ratters to just keep ratting while they are deployed and can't defend them. Oh wait, they tell them to dock up while the supercap fleet is deployed? Hmm, seems like they care about KBs too....like literally every major alliance in Eve...

No one is telling anyone to dock up, just that you wont get saved. Clearly observable if you look at whats dying in Delve.

And everyone's busy w/ all the balance patches.
---
Its level ones that cap at 450m3.  One of the probe frigates with a single expander is indeed the best choice for these.
---
Level twos will have you occasionally hauling 1-2km3.

Level threes occasionally have you hauling 4k.

I think he is saying that no standard level bankers were banned, and it was the 2 higher up leaders that got the ban, IE Lenny and the website creator.

---
In short, yes. I told about it here years after the fact. I was cleaning and throwing out my old Eve books. Remembered about it and looked up the old PayPal transactions. Having some drinks and figured I'd throw up a story on here. I told my story in private a long time ago.

---
Hey, at least people will remember him, right?
---
Yeah. I now, no signal on work and then... There goes some cool multiple post. 
---
I suck XD
---
He was a long standing member of test. Decided to run a big 50/50 raffle, with half of all all raised going to Test_Free, Tests Premier Socialist Program. The program gives away free ships, skill books, ammo, whatever to anyone in the alliance that needs it, no questions asked. Veteran player who just lost everything he owns? Here's a free PVP and pve ship, good luck!
---
Over 100B was raised for this raffle, he walked with it all. 
---
He later did give some isk to the program because let's be honest, it was the equivalent to robbing an "Autism Thrift Store" and pretty much everyone looked down on him for it as one of the least "fun" heists in eve.
---
Ya couldn't at least find an ice belt? You know, for historical accuracy
---
I'm not "that weird pedo guy" that's somebody else entirely.   
---
What you think this Casino War Criminal is saying is subjective, they opened with "That's 100% wrong" before quickly realizing Oh shit this is backed up by facts and data. Then they changed their argument several times over the course of the thread.

If you honestly think that Haidere1988 has any credibility at all after this point than your user flair "Higher Than Everest" is apropos.

Are you in Oklahoma? Did you make regular use of your churches inside gas stations and the 'world's largest cross?'

And a lack of effort
---
It’s because of all the cherry pickers! Damn cherry pickers!
---
Oh the days. Those were the days.
---
i get your ideas. theyre not dreadful, but they arnt the fix to the game.
---
there have been bettr, easier to implentment ideas given thus far.
---
unfortunatly the damage skill injectors have done is done.skill injection should be removed completly as it is. just fully gone. or have heavier restrcitons further to like you have said, skill inject up to 10mil? but no further on a toon. lets people fast track the basic skills but not the entire shiptree. and i think 10mil sp doesnt let you get the big capital trains done. its somthing but TBH i still dont see it 'fixing' the issue. 
---
at this stage maybe removing the usefulness of supers completly. return them to bridge/DD/mothership style again and non of this grid holding abilities. ie: disallow targetting structures completly with supers/titans. all they are are anti capital. ie: dreads n fax
---
cyno inhibs - this and more. why do we need to be limited to one type of cyno inhib. just add dont remove or change.
---
the goon carebears would never allow local to go away in nullsec, so stop dreaming
---
I don't know how to break this to you but... both Lenny and Eep were bankers in an organization called I Want Isk. If your physicality was par with the mental gymnastics you have demonstrated thus far you could have taken the Olympic Gold.

In all my years here, I’ve never seen a gas station with a church inside. Maybe they do exist. Can’t say I’ve seen the worlds largest cross either. Where is it located?
---
Shows up in wallet history iirc
---
&gt; Gobbins said it would be taken in one month, we was what happened.
---
Yeah what happened is that conveniently Goons deployed to Geminate to harass Horde in defense of Sort, and we were fighting three different wars when test took advantage of the situation and attacked hisec. Don’t worry, your time is coming.
---
A smart RMT person would have just left off the zeroes.  Then at least it would have looked like a fat finger.
---
Im doing it on my phone on work... Lack of effort x2. XD
---
GotG didn’t hurt him anywhere because they’re literally incapable of having hurt him.
---
As this BR and all of the fights from the BL/Horde deployment last year showed.
---
Nope, they were not bankers. Lenny hadn't been a banker for a while since he didn't like waiting for Eep to reimburse for payouts. 
---
Eep ran the site and reimbursed bankers for payouts.
---
Look if this war is boring for you, it's your own fault, but don't make us suffer for it.
---
Well, you do have to spin a narrative to get mostly pve players to bunch up and gang on someone else for that long a time.

Tell us how you really feel

Moral of the story. Dont be predictable.
---
Is this like, one skillu dude scouting your fleet and “running away” kind of thing?
---
What does this mean? Only missiles and projectiles have selectable damage types...
---
Somewhere along I-40. I have stopped at it twice to take pictures of it over the years, and I have also encountered multiple gas stations/truck stops with 'chapels' either attached to or inside the gas station itself in Oklahoma. 
---
This is one of the reasons I often tell people that the three states one should probably avoid are Oklahoma, Utah, and Alabama (in no particular order). :D
---
At least it's not being triple posted because some shitter posted it in a discord and multiple people thought "HAHA LE EBIN MEME POST TO REDDIT" simultaneously
---
Bombing excavators good, tackle ceptors + covert T3Cs good to kill basically anything smaller than a rorq. A T3 can defang a ratting carrier and kill it no problem, two or three multiboxed makes it very fast.

Which csm candidate should I vote for to bring back the multicoloured Neocom?

---
Gank 10/10 runners... there are some 10/10 where you dont need to use a jumpgate in Fountain for example if this is still the case.
---
Yea I’ve seen truck stops with the “church trailer” at it, but never seen one inside an actual station. I’ve covered thousands of miles of I40 for work. I honestly can’t say I’ve seen the large cross before. I’ll have to look it up.
---
L1/L2 mission cargo is 450 m3, whereas L3 mission cargo is 3,000 m3. L3 missions often tend to involve more jumps. The L3 payouts are higher, of course, but what I tend to do is use L1/L2 missions to grind standings by finding a constellation with 2-4 L1/L2 agents and a Storyline agent all with the same corp. I run the missions several at a time, since they usually go to the same destinations. This generates more Storyline missions, which in addition to the standings boost, ISK, and LP, also give low grade implants. I haven't worked out the ISK per hour of this grind, but it might be better than L3 distros, I'll let you do the math.
---
But to answer your question, the exploration frigs have 400m3 cargo capacity, which can be bumped up to enough to run a single L1/L2 mission with a Cargo Expander I. If you use a Magnate with its four low slots and put a Cargo Expander II in each one, along with a Small Cargo Optimization Rig, you could haul two at a time. Anything beyond this and you'll need a hauler. The Wreathe has enough base cargo capacity to haul six L1/L2 missions at a time, so you can fit the lows with Inertia Stabilizers and/or Nanofibers and the rigs with Medium Hyperspatials to make it as fast as possible.
---
Keep in mind that if you plan on doing the Storyline missions, they typically require a stack of 1,500 Scordite (this can be quickly mined on a belt in a venture, or just slap a Miner I on your Magnate), or high m3 hauling missions which might require the Wreathe.
---
Oh another sociopath trying to get attention....what season of the year is it now? Piwate season or scammer season?

Nah PL holds to their agreements. Honestly the only backstabby thing I can think of is not helping xdeath against skillu and tri but I don't think they broke an agreement.

---
Upvoted for procrastination. We have to hold together, boys.
---
&gt;Nope, they were not bankers. Lenny hadn't been a banker for a while  since he didn't like waiting for Eep to reimburse for payouts.   
---
So Lenny was not a banker but then he was but then he just "hadn't been a banker for a while", that's a pretty sharp change from "not a single banker was banned, just Lenny and Eep."   
---

After coming to co2/gotg last time it was logical to go to the other members of the north, going again to gotg wouldn't make new points.

There was one deal with goons and no other one but if your narrative tells you believe the opposite to so ;)
---
So it's gotg's fault if your ennemy attack you while you decide to take a region of an ally for a long time? Gotg would have come to help if gobbins didn't make what he did.

"Reddit Diarrhea War"
---
Yeah, he went from saying "only 2 people were banned the rest just got their wallets emptied without a ban" to  "only 2 people were banned the rest just got their wallets emptied without a ban". Who fucking cares if you wanna call Lenny and Eep bankers or not. They got banned the rest didn't.
---
Have an outcyno ready, stay aligned and watch intel. It gets a bit of taking used to to control your fighters initially so don’t be put off if your ticks seem low at first. I think there’s some good guides on that on YouTube. 
---
Get t2 fighters asap as well. And obviously fit your ship tank to match the rats. Chimera isn’t the best for ratting but it’s fine.
---
Good way to explain the principle on why you do it. I would try to record in 1080p next time though, since EVE looks pretty bad when scaled down to 720
---
Lol I brought it out to fight a gang of like 10 guys in frigs and cruisers. It was a fun welp. Just saying it died because they had me damped so much I couldn't target anything to get the tackle off me.
---
And they could have offered a small incentive for doing the survey..
---
They do periodic updates on some things (CS:GO keys, for example) to keep them even. If countries have high inflation rates, it’s possible it gets way out of sync before they do it again.
---
what war? i only see goons burning alot of structures then returning back to delve
---
oh sorry that's general EVE state 2019, my bad, back to looking for names
---
There’s only been phase 1 so far. Phase 2 and 3 will have DED or Concord payouts like sansha incursions. Unfortunately, salvage is the primary source of income for what is on TQ so far.

Structure Burning 4TW

This is one of the best posts in r/eve in a long while(csm drama excluded). Look at the comments and remember how much better wwb propaganda and shitposting was than for example the ongoing tribite war. Makes you  want 2016 precitadel eve and shitpost back.
---
unaccurate, old and out of context. 1/10

There is no war, Goons are just cleaning up and doing some beautification work to revert the destruction made by the squatters living there before

you are triggering so many nerds right now. I endorse this shitpost.

Looking forward to check this out when I get home, nice ship choice.
---
Propaganda for this war has been c tier at best, only thing that was actually funny was that Mr Bean video
---
Youre gonna sit there and tell me that not even a chance at 400 Billion ISK is enough to get you to take a potshot out to nullsec in something cheap?
---
I think they should have saved some reward for doing the damn survey. I will not bother. :)
---
Don't do the survey?
---
&gt;docked your titan in a outpost to have it magically appear in low sec

Correct me if I’m wrong, but supercaps can only he recovered by putting a new keepstar in the same system? I remember CPP saying that when citadels were coming out, unless that has been changed.
---
the other thread was more enlightening on why, the reason why is because him and others are unable to comprehend that you need to update orders, and that market traders do that as their eve game play - so they have the conclusion every market trader is therefore not a person and instead a bot.
---
and rather than think about consequences all they can imagine is their 1 order of 10mil isk that is so incredibly insignificant
---
Does anyone still sell bookmark packs?  I biomassed, then recovered my accounts, but my BMs didn't come back.  I don't really feel like burning undocks at all the hubs, etc.  Is this still a thing any where?

I've lived in wormholes for years and not struggled with isk, but some corps I'm in have. Obviously there's no % tax rate on rats bounties, so what are the best ways for corp itself to make isk? Reactions, PI tax?
---
Also just as an aside null rats dropping blue loot for a day instead of giving bounties due to a bug in a patch would be hilarious. Lots more explosions too
---
trying to be "worthy" is a waste of time, if you're deriving enjoyment from the game solely by the praise of other players yeah don't even bother

Just like NC

the best advice would be to ask your corp/alliance and not reddit.

I just shoved my head inside my dogs ass so I didnt have to hear that song.... he is not happy....so what happened in the video?
---
Holy shit!
---
I’d rather lose a 12 Billion ISK ship in a fight than misclick on the market.
---
Damn!
---
=]
---
How about making the rewards be for actually doing something in the game, preferably that requires undocking. Radical idea I know.
---
Rewarding getting to the account select screen and clicking accept may boost login stats, but it does not increase engagement with the game. I did it for 3 days then asked "what the fuck am I doing with my life" and went back to logging in once a month to update my skillfarm queues.
---
I don't think people are activly doing it, but if you ask around you'll probably find some people who are happy to hand you some.
---
This is amazing. It's rather hard to really describe it to non-players but small scale EVE pvp pumps adrenaline like nothing else I ever played
---
&gt;The issue is that there's one ship, that if you spend enough money on
---
and get socket closure
---
But What if it’s a rr only drake with armor tank?
---
Netflix (pornhub) and chill war
---
ASIC chips are optimized for blockchain mining.... bitcoin bruh.
---
Because it’s a sandbox not a themed MMO, and instanced PVP through what is essentially a souped up matchmaker is just stupid for the type of game that EVE is. 
---
Incentivizing PvP out in the galaxy is the way to go.
---
they are smartbomb fitted tho
---
[last week’s thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/busx9n/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_may_30/)
---
just do it and show km
---
Yeah these changes are bringing in so many ~~SP farming alts and mining bots~~ new players!
---
So they are only +5 to you then?
---
This is pretty much the only reason I havent made the move to NulSec yet. Every time I try I get gate camped :P
---
Undocking? Do you actually want NC to failscade?
---
For a Corp itself, one option of course is PI taxes, as you mentioned, the only problem is, that if you put them too high people won't bother with it and added to that it will only hit the people that do PI (and only a small tax will barely cover fuel costs for your structures).
---
In Wormholes you'd have the option to get a "general tax" going among your members, as money isn't much of a problem there, (depending on the class) you can charge a monthly value x from your Members. Doing this you are required to actually give your members something back in return, so people don't leave (duh).
---
There is nothing else coming to my mind so a Corporation can passivly generate ISK in that sense, without you investing time yourself.
---
Im gonna throw down that if people hear about asset safety and skill injectors in 2008, they would have laughed at the utter ridiculousness of the idea
---
Wait for you to undock a d fight us maybe ?

Whats the point of losing expensive stuff when there is so much isk in the game that losses are nearly meaningless
---
Only the kind of retard who thinks *asset safety* in eve online somehow makes sense
---
Look, it is either part of Panfam culture to allow every shitter of a human being in to the alliance or it isn't. If it isn't, then you should be surprised when human shitters are in Panfam. If it is, which is what was stated, then you should not be surprised, which was also admitted to. 
---
Ergo, it *is* part of Panfam culture to have multiple human shitters carrying around the alliance tag and behaving like human shit.
---
I'm guessing you hated the event because you didn't get the million SP. I'm guessing you didn't get the million SP because you didn't read the event properly or couldn't make enough days. They should allow negative feedback, but your reason for the negative feedback is invalid, if that's the case.
---
They had an event that gave out stuff for every day you could get in. If you missed more than 2 you didn't get the big prize, but you still could have gotten a lot of other stuff...for free. They didn't \*need\* to do a thing.
---
There is no part of eve you can play eve free without some pay 2 win Omega doing it way better. There are many areas you cant access at all. There are many corps who wont take alpha plebs.
---
It is an unlimited trial period.
---
Right? I don't think I will feel bad for any losses for a while.
---
&gt;you cant bring frigates

A bunch of sweaty unwashed people who drank the kool aid without hesitation sperging on reddit.

Contracts show up the same way as market purchases/sales.
---
It isn't off, but I see it all the time when I am placing low buy orders or high sell orders, so I ignore it all the time. 
---
Lesson learned.
---
But why though? Cant he just buy plex from ccp? Is someone selling it cheaper?
---
nice strategy
---
It is complete fucking AIDS that every player has access to 100% safety wherever they want for pennies. That used to be reserved for stations only and for good reason. Now I warp around lowsec and every system has a dozen citadels spamming up the place. You used to at least be able to *see* people docked in places
---
Jeez, i meant just worthy of admission at all. 
---
The rest is your projection. :D
---
THEY PLAY WITHOUT TRAINING WHEELS OUT THERE GUISE IT'S ANARCHY!!
---
Yes.  Yes, anarchy is entirely the point, actually.
---
They must be dumb, should've joined Ranger Regiment.
---
null isnt anarchy , lowsec is
---
I'm pretty sure most people who play f2p anything in mmos, they understand that's what it is
---
Pretty big waste of Satan's time.  Why not go for a bigger audience.   I mean, how many of eve players fit the bill for a god fearing Christian.
---
I've been in corps that set up buy orders for blue loot, salvage, and gas at 5-10% below Jita price (or NPC price for blue loot).  It's convenient for line members who no longer have to haul out, and the corp makes some isk with a weekly haul out. It's never been mandatory in any of the groups I've been in, but most line members took advantage for convenience's sake.
---
fair I suppose
---
Hah, I did this exact thing last night but in a Magus/Loki :D
---
It didn't require daily logins.
---
Just logins on 16 different days, over a 20 day (iirc) period
---
I have not managed to avoid a lot of ship losses. Some, yes. Most of the time I get hammered. I have a list of lost ships that’s like a library index, there’s so many.
---
I have, solar, been able to avoid making stupid mistakes in the market. And not because I’m smart but because I’m paranoid as fuck. I count the zeros. Then I count the zeros again. I count them again, just to make sure. Then, I verify the order, and before I click I count the zeros again. It has helped me on a number of occasions and: some smart aleck who wanted to do the old switcheroo with a trade for 12 million, no 12 billion, oops! I gladly flipped the bird because: I counted the zeros *again*.
---
I’ve lost billions and billions in EVE. But that’s in ship losses. On the market, and I can’t really say why, I wouldn’t trust my grandmother not to screw me over. I don’t really understand how that works but there you have it.
---
Usually we just give all PvP loot to the corp, sometimes that enough to replace just Sabres, but at times it's been enough for full SRP for everything including pods with additional playouts for content creators.
---
More PvE focussed groups can just pay members 80% right after the site and sell the loot themselves.
---
When the srp wallet is low we have also done PvE days where everything goes to the corp.
---
Not sure what the rmt thing is, but as someone who makes about 1b isk/ day station trading Jita, that was intentional
---
If you sell an item on the market the client automatically puts in the highest buy offer that would be able to accept all off them (not necessarily the top order) 
---
Whoever sold that had to manually enter 1.00 isk as the sell value. That's not just the wrong digits (if he had entered 410 ish or 4100 ish instead it would have been more likely to just be a mistake) but missing 6 digits completly
---
GF is PL spai confirmed
---

---
I can imagine the frozen corpses would actually deal some significant damage to the enemy if flung at the enemy ship with the right amount of force...
---
Pretty sure they do it for the same reason that companies in america put warning labels on things that shouldn't need warning labels
---
It's so that when some retard does the thing anyways and cries about bad things happening it's easy to point out that it's their fault for being retarded
---
so ur so shit you need to cry for help form npc to fight... boring
---
I like it
---
Faction has it
---
They get dumped into a lowsec station along with the rest of your asset safety. So the problem is that once you undock you can't redock.
---
The FABIAN war lmao
---
So by that logic, they still care about the killboards?
---
Often any combat sites that spawn in home hole are run “for the Corp,” and the blue loot is donated to help keep the lights on. Other than that, the buy-back programs for blue loot (we use 10% below universal) mentioned earlier help keep the tax dollars coming in.
---
So you wanted panfam to blue everyone and be what goons are today? fuck blues.
---
Oh, looks like someone who died to this has appeared! Lovely tears~
---
No, I totally get it, and I used to double and triple check, but going through 80-100 open orders takes a while and I just put my mind on autopilot and go through them.
---
I usually just sit there, watch Netflix, and talk to my wife while doing market trading, so I am distracted...
---
Woops
---
Until you show us your record where the bans are stated, he still has more information about it than you.
---
Maybe you unblue goons then?  Stand on your own?
---
Very new player over here. Finished all the career agents mission and am 10 missions through on the Sisters of Eve arc. 
---
So here are my questions:
---
- After the sisters of eve arc, the next step for me is applying for a corp right? Or can I (as a new player) explore ways to survive in this game PvE, all alone?
---
- How do you guys manage your item hangars and docking stations if they are too far away from each other? Not that I have too much or too valuable stuff with me, but is there a smart way to manage your inventory when you are moving a lot? 
---
- Considering this is such a longstanding game, how good do you think the devs have been in keeping up with the general community demands or issues?
---
It had its downsides, but it also allowed full pvp gamestyle.
---
lmao
---
go lose ur sov idiot
---
Tbh, as some1 who did claim the mil SP on all my subbed accounts, I still found that "event" shit.
---
How about.... no? Does everything you do need to have an incentive for you to do it?

---
So you have time to dedicate to the game but cannot afford to spend a few minutes pressing a couple buttons? Ok then.
---
I mean, it's still pretty fucking shitty that if you miss just two days you miss out on a whopping two full skill injectors worth of SP.
---
Free is free but he has every right to complain about how the event was set up.
---
But also just use the custom field OP.
---
I'm in a good Corp but it's a bit harder for me to find set times to do anything. I've been talking to one of them about it though. Hopefully soon we'll start some shenanigans
---
I might be guessing here but I'd bet no one gives a damn what you think. Nice cringy, whine like a baby, post though!

Thank for your answer, my idea then its to get a powerfull fit for do 3 missions while i gett standings up doing 1-2lvl missions. basically like these once i get level 3 i will have already a good fitting. I did just these idk what to put in high/mid slots
---
also have one rig and low slot free

---
ur the one who got baited by my flair idiot
---
i will take your 1m sp, you obv dont want it or even deserve it
---
I know you could miss a few days, but it is still "daily login rewards".  And I still think that needing to earn X amount of points from completing in-game activities is a better way of doing it.
---
Example numbers:
---
* 100 points per reward level
---
* 10 points per killmark
---
* 1 point per rat
---
* 1 point per minute of mining
---
* 5 points per industry job installed
---
etc.
---
Just spitballed numbers/activities, but you get the idea.
---
This could be gamed with alts of course, but it is still less vacuous than getting to the character select screen.
---
But I guess the major issue is it would be hard to do it with useless alt accounts that people sub just for the event.
---
How can free stuff be bad?
---
Survey was pretty crap though
---
Now do the Quran.
---
its your fault if you miss it
---
Since all your brain cells have abandoned you, I'll give you a small tip. Stop posting. &lt;3

why would free 1m sp ever get negative response thats not trolling
---
A large shield extender or adaptive invulnerability field for tank, although for your purposes you could probably skip tanking the ship. A MWD is a microwarpdrive, which is a handy speed boost if you need to burn to a gate or station, etc. You've got a lot of extra cargo on this fit even for an L3, you might want to trade out for some speed modules.
---
why lol
---
No, I'm saying that it should reward actual engagement with the game, not just a meaningless "activity" to increase user metrics.
---
I totally understand.
---
I’m not in that market PvP myself. 80-100 orders is way out of my scope. It’s real easy to just *click click click* through the stack as you have other things to think about.
---
In EVE though, I don’t mean to grin, that really does deserve some more attention.
---
They should put that in the interface: **THERE IS NO ‘UNDO’ BUTTON FOR MARKET ORDERS!**
---
Sorry, it already gone on the market.
---
I once met a guy at a cyber security residential (were still in school), who turned out to be recon head for PanHorde. Talked about a lot of great stuff, but some annoying dude always kept interfereing with his shit questions about wtf is eve, thinking he can get a titan in two weeks.
---
Leshak takes a massive shit on pretty much every T1 battleship that isn't specifically fit to counter it. Not exactly surprising given the level of powercreep and it being superior to most faction/T2 battleships as well.
---
yes
---
whats a cheast?
---
I'd put a hyperspatial rig in the third slot, another inertial stab in the lows, then trade out two expanded cargoholds for some nanofibers. You could run several L1/L2 missions with that, as well as an L3. If you start running multiple L3 missions at a time you might need that many cargohold expanders in the lows.

---
Nowhere in my comment did I say that... But I can see from your other comments in this thread that all you care about is getting 1m SP (as if that is a meaningful amount in 2019).
---
If that is the case, why not just hand it out to every subscribed account? Given you could get it without ever having to actually log a character into the game.
---
Its more hardcore than any other significant MMO.
---
even still, it would just be artificially inflating metrics.
---
Damn son, I wanna play that.
---
The northern military action.
---
&gt; The rewards also shouldn't require daily logins, but X amount of engagement within Y days.
---
You know, we used to have stuff like that, and people bitched about it until it was removed.
---
Seriously. 
---
I can VPN into my home network, use Wake-On-LAN to turn my computer on, then use TeamViewer to connect to it and fire up EVE for my 10 accounts to collect my rewards, *all from my phone.*
---
When CCP ask, Yes.
---
Nope, not working directly with goons at all. We are on our own side. Just a good opportunity while yall are docking with goons about. And bring it on after goons leave. Good fights all around 😀
---
Yes, but people logging in and actually playing the game to get rewards may actually reignite their desire to play, or reconnect them with their alliance mates etc. Or if they are already playing the game they shouldn't care as they will get the rewards anyway.
---
because you need more sp
---
Nah, not really mate. The event set up was fucking retarded, sorry you retards liked being rewarded for logging in and pressing a single button. Good event content for sure!
---
goes well with my afk ratters and miners
---
I won't even try. With sigs that show up ad red balls in the map saying "Here I am!" with Asset Safety basically insuring your stuff, Longer than hell times to kill structures, etc. It's nowhere near as hardcore as it once was.
---
Thare's always going to be the "You can still lose expensive stuff" But that's hardly keeping the game hardcore. You have *always* been able to lose expensive stuff.
---
I got recruited while mining by randos and it turned out they were from my city.

1. It is possibile to survive on your own, but to actually get into the game and learn more I'd adive you to join a Corp that fulfills your needs. As this game does not only offer PvE, you should try out different things too, once you feel ready for it. If you only stick with Missions &amp; Combat Sites you will burn yourself out quite quickly, at least from my personal experience.
---
2. When transporting big amounts of items you can either grab an Industrial to transport, or even hire others to do it for you. Once you advance in the game a bit you'll be out and about having multiple ships everywhere you need to have any.
---
3. Some demands have been fullfilled, others haven't. Some long-standing bugs still exist, though the devs definitly put work &amp; heart into EVE. You can't please everyone :)
---
4. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions
---
talismans
---
Not if I'm somewhere that I don't have access to a PC.

You're forgetting the fact caldari PVP toons just train lights and heavies for battleships (Rapid jesus for the win)

Well, Titanic 2 is being build. There are some photos of the hull being worked on, project, after several delays, has been postponed to 2022. You can check out wiki article about it, cant say that much as i am not really following this construction. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic\_II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_II) 
---
However if you mean if there has been any Titanic II before, then answer is most likely no.
---
Even then, there will be a lag in damage as once they switch targets there will be travel time(due to webbing the primary, primary muninn gets split from the blob) allowing every muninn to easily be able to ADC before getting to like half shields.
---
Next step = whatever you want. Depends on your 'career' preferences. Join corp or explore missions/agents/trade... more independently. In Low/null/whspace corp has more advantages.
---
Moving: don't move everything at once. Spread the risk. Unless you're looking for adrenaline.
---
It's a large community. Hard to keep happy. Sometimes they do a good job. Sometimes they don't. They try to stay positive.
---
And what about talismans? Even a 5 medium neut curse with hg tali’s take close to 2 minutes to neut out a double cap battery ikit, in which time the iki will have ramped beyond what any curse with 5 medium neuts can tank and bam you’re dead
---
Oï ! Welcome to our wonderful game :)
---
As you light already know, EVE Online is an MMO. You can indeed play alone, but I do admit that for as much as the lone wolf play style can be fun, it does get tiring as you’ll meet your limitations as a solo player sooner or later... And this game is based on interactions, friendly or not ! As such, I do recommend that you take as much time as you need before jumping into a corporation. I do recommend seeking newbie corporations (BRAVE Newbie, Karmafleet, etc), as they are your first step to understand deeper mechanics of the game, and open new careers paths that cannot be done as a solo player.
---
There is a button in your Neocom that look like a closed strongbox. IIRC, it’s called the Personal Assets window, and it allow you to see your items in specific stations or Upwell Structures through the whole universe, including wormhole space. You can’t really manage them, as the only real action you can do on those items is to trash them. You can however see what and where your items are, how bulky they are if you need to transport them, and what is their estimated worth (although it isn’t a precise parameter).
---
I can’t really speak about your last question, sorry. But in this game, some careers are sometimes left untouched for years, even if they are basically useless.
---
I'm just imagining this
---
Hotfix: All ships are no longer rorquals.
---
So the career agents and epic arc are great for new players, but are by no means required. You can play the game alone, with a Corp, or however you feel is best. That’s the beauty of Eve; there’s no right way to play the game. 
---
As for inventory management, I have a “home” system, which is really just my alliance home system, that 75% of my stuff is. I also keep useful ships or items in other systems around the map that I tend to do certain activities around. Put stuff where you usually need it is the best advice I can give for that.
---
While I agree calling it an “event” is generous (more like a giveaway with stipulations) it is definitely your fault you couldn’t log in and click a button every day for 2 weeks. By your own admission, it’s not hard. Therefore if you missed it, it’s your own fault. Everyone complaining about this thing is perfect material for r/choosingbeggars

How does that make the shitty event not shit?  
---
Also what kind of idiot runs a promotional event with the potential of majorly disappointing existing customers?  The dates were not clear, hence the mass email by CCP Archduke in response to the mass petitions.    
---
The event was shit.  The execution was shit.  The only thing that wasnt shit was the million SP, which probably should have been give out first, halfway through, or not at all.  
---
Personally I canceled my account after the event.  Too much proof of disconnect between CCP and players.  I honestly dont understand why they didnt remedy the million SP for everyone who missed it by a day.  SP costs them NOTHING, but losing subscriptions does.  They could try to claim theyre protecting the integrity of the game, but if the game actually had any integrity CCP would do something about botters.  
---
tl:dr  only a fucking idiot runs a promotional event that includes 15 days of building anticipation and then a slap across the face.  I would still be playing if not for the bad taste the event left in my mouth.

Episode 2 - The empire strikes back !
---
Is that how you go through life? Just looking for low hanging fruit? You see a homeless man and laugh at him? See a kid with autism and make fun of him?
---
You’ve got a lot of growing up to do if you think someone deserves to be made fun of just because they have a skewed perspective of the world that’s completely out of their control.
---
And if you truly believe someone shouldn’t openly write or talk about their view of the world solely because they are mentally ill and their view is distorted, well then you probably don’t deserve a voice of your own.
---
There's always been an extended black-screen when logging-in or undocking for the first time. I haven't notice it get any worse than it has ever been.
---
But then I don't hunt bots myself, so I don't pay that close attention to it like you guys do.
---
O wait, no. You've just gotten back, right. Just coincidentally posting the exact thing all of them have been posting. My mistake.
---
There is technically 9 gun types so having 6 missile types is fine imo.  (subcap weapon). Cause you have small med large, of each projectile, hybrid and lazers
---
There was no small group owning moons without the consent of the local overlords. This myth that small groups owned good moons before the mining changes won't die. I've been in the same "small" group from before and after the changes and the powerblocs that owned the moons in my area of npc null defended them all the up they were changed and then gave up.
---
In Soviet Russian space, Spod mines you.
---
There can be asset safety but it shouldn't be teleportation.

Goddamn I wish I didn't have a CSM NDA right now
---
then you arent dedicated enough
---
"My mining drones will no longer fit in my bay. What gives? And where did my panic button go?!
---
Im an alpha player who is eyeing the orthrus to do l3 or above missions. Ive only seen two answers to the viability of this ship.  Either "lol just use gila" or "play however you want its okay". 
---
Id like to know something more specific, I want to  play the game without having to min max all the time,  but i also don't want to completely gimp myself and end up burning out on the grind. Would using the orthrus gimp my ability by a lot,  or is it just a little bit less efficient? If the latter,  then I'm fine with that as I hate how most of the other alpha ships look like (either looking like lego pieces randomly put together or edgy shapes an elemantary student would doodle in class). Sorry if you don't agree with how the ships look heh.
---
"Let's give out free stuff with no explanation or events ingame" is hardly an event.
---
why are you mad?
---
"Here's some free shit, have fun!"
---
Fuck you I'm canceling!
---
OK bud.
---
Standard courtesy for when you're stabbing someone with a bunch of nails
---
Oh look at the ungrateful bitter vets... Give somebody a hand and they’ll take the whole fucking arm, it’s never enough.
---
I’ll make an uninstall tutorial for you if you like.
---
You're ignoring a very important detail. The training speeds on missile skills and support skills are not all equal.
---
Light Missiles, require 2x SP and the spec requires 3x. (see multiplier:  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Missiles#Light\_Missiles](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Missiles#Light_Missiles) )  
---
Medium Energy Turret require 3x and beam/pulse spec require 5x. (see  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Gunnery#Medium\_Energy\_Turret](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Gunnery#Medium_Energy_Turret) )
---
The support skills are the reverse, where gunnery support skills have a cumulative multiplier of 18x (across all support skills) where missile support skills have a cumulative multiplier of 21x.
---
tldr; structure is different because training times/SP requirements are different.
---
Yup, I run a very good rig
---
Why are the angry incels on this subreddit so damn dense?  They love to focus on "no free shit = leaving" and have no idea wtf context or implications are.
---
Eve is a diverse game.
---
Someone sat down doing PI for a few hours and someone out small gang roaming are both active but performing a different type of action.
---
How do you measure all the aspects of the game to make it fair?
---
Ok, and how is that any different from outposts? I would argue that there was a lot more safety with outposts, because back then the only way to deny a player access to their assets was to deadzone a station; something that only actually took place about 2 or 3 times in EVE history. Now if you lose your stuff you have to pay to get it back.
---
Go back and read the CSM minutes when citadels were being pitched, and every single CSM member said the same thing, "if you want anyone to use citadels, there has to be the expectation of safety when not logged in." 
---
I'm not saying citadels aren't cancer, they are, but again, you can not have a mechanic where a player risks losing everything because of real life.
---
I thought it was: Eat My Ass War
---
Right...and they are doing what as a result? Docking up right? Aka...protecting their KBs while they know the supercap fleet is out of range.
---
I'm just saying, pot meet kettle.
---
Then cry on twitter about how people are harassing him.
---
I claim the salt throne!!
---
I've put an idea for that in another comment. No idea on whether it is technically feasible or what the actual numbers should be though.
---
No idiot, by that logic they just care about enraging Gooner retards who spend hours making posts like the one we're talking about to whine about how they're ISK efficient in the war while simultaneously crying they don't care about ISK efficiency.
---
Honestly just pick one or the other and stick to it, if you have a leg each on two horses and they are going to run in opposite directions, eventually you're going to have a bad time.
---
you know this aint just event right?
---
[OP right now.](https://i.imgur.com/THeAxGm.gif)
---
We have bigger fish to fry than a chimmy in Serp space, I think you’ll be safe.
---
Hey, is it safe to put some salt on my chips after reading this?
---
It sounds like you would feel better if you take a dump.
---
I think a 10MN Afterburner would actually work better than the 5MN MWD, if you have the power for it. The 5MN doesn't really give you a big speed boost, and the 10MN cycles faster so it's better for using it to align.
---
If you can't do it though, don't sacrifice the Hyperspat rigs to try to make it, those things are like the best rigs ever.
---
I hate free things and I am mad grr exclamation mark apostrophe one
---
You really need to get laid, man.
---
Ah! Good example. Missiles also have overlap where training torps will let you train for stealth bombers and for brawling battleships.
---
I'll note also that your "most training takes place" argument is bizarre to me. EVE's skill tree is designed to heavily encourage specialization, but even ignoring that I can't figure out how you would possibly end up with battleships as the plurality of training time. What restrictions are you placing to reach this conclusion?

Awesome as always &lt;3

The "No YOU Care More About This War Than We Do" War
---
&gt; Oh man you make me regret a little bit of winning eve with all this «story». After coming to co2/gotg last time it was logical to go to the other members of the north, 
---
You haven’t won because you’re still here. Might as well log in.
---
&gt; There was one deal with goons and no other one but if your narrative tells you believe the opposite to so ;)
---
Are you referring to the deal where Sort paid Goons to leave...after they’d already had well known plans to leave? And its subsequent modification to include attacking Horde when Horde attacked Branch?
---
You’re not really that blind to reality, are you? Do you just not know Sort’s history?
---
&gt; So it's gotg's fault if your ennemy attack you while you decide to take a region of an ally for a long time? 
---
It is when literally the deal Sort worked out has precluded Goons attacking until Sort asked for that to be changed.
---
&gt; Gotg would have come to help if gobbins didn't make what he did. 
---
This is just blatantly a lie. Sort’s excuse for making the Deal was that his alliance couldn’t bear fighting further. How then could they show up to help us? Sort himself told us he wouldn’t be able to. It’s whatever but this is just false.
---
&gt; You putted yourself in a situation of figthing 3 differents wars, blame your leaders, not the one you attacked.
---
We instigated one war, the defender in which called Goons who deployed against us after having drawn back. The third war is whatever, just Test being unusually not terrible at timing there.
---
Why would I blame my leadership for any of that? Why would I blame anyone, at all? This is why I play the game.
---
is this real
---
The no kills count war
---
No kidding. I still like my Osprey, but I loved the old asymmetrical design. If they take my Imicus away with its glorious kickstand I'm gonna be *real* sad.

Haha right fellow big brains?? *tips fedora*

Amazing soundtrack. 10/10

---
Are the minerals you mine free?  
---
It's not free, they made us work for it by logging in every day and also they advertised the dates wrong, the event being 1 day shorter which was a big middle finger for those who missed 3 days or so.
---
ok
---
well, i officially give up. I've tried as much as i know how. All the awesome suggestions and advice you guys n gals have given me are cool, tried the lot. but still getting the weird dc on an off grid warp. Its ruined my game, the current situation in null is providing some proper eve gameplay and gf's. but i cant lose a ship on every op i go on.
---
Gonna sit it out and consider my eve future when its all over.
---
thanks folks, you've all been very helpful. Fly safe.
---
I hated the event although I got all SP - because I am not stupid enough to not see what the purpose was ...
---
*tips fedora
---
It would be pretty stupid to name it that..
---
No explanation was because they would have to explain that the purpose of the whole event was to manipulate key numbers communicated to investors ...
---
It's also why Force Auxiliary ships use the Carrier skills rather than having their own; prior to the Citadel expansion in 2016, that's what carriers were used for: Triage module remote repair ships. Then Citadel comes and CCP decides that carriers should be, ya know, carriers, with fighters and all. But they didn't want to get rid of the old role that carriers used to fill, so they created FAXes to do it in stead.
---
You've seen the turkey cannon videos, right?  
---
The one that they use to test aircraft for bird impacts?
---
I agree. Teleportation does make it too easy for the defender with little incentive for the attacker. I have no idea what the alternative would be though. Build another citadel in the same system to get your stuff back maybe?
---
Just make the free SP the best item in the rewards. The rest don't even get moved over to the other side to be ranked.
---
You can't rent them out because nobody wants moons like even if you give them away for free most people will go no. 
---
You can't really come to terms with the neighbors about just moon mining rorqs specially given often these are small groups so they need to come to terms with every roaming gang, and you quickly turn you region into a blue donut ( see nullsec ). 
---
As for hiring miners there are not enough people in the game that like mining for the amount of moons we have right now, and given you can't give away moons for free if there not in a favorable position ( read far away from any traveled route ).
---
Can't anchor in the abyss I'm pretty sure.
---
Here is an event that will make you sub all your non lucrative SP-Farm-Accounts so we can fake some nice "logged in account" numbers for investors ...
---
This is the correct answer.
---
you cant
---
Lol this is officially my most favorite worthless shit post.  This event sucked balls because it sucked balls.  End of story.
---
26 years seems like a short time for a ship of this size.
---
I personally don't think the Orthrus is much of a viable Mission ship, compared to other cruisers. The reason people choose the Gila over the Orthrus is not because of minimal different, but of a rather large one. The Gila with it's Drone bonuses can apply very constant DPS over a long peroid of time, where as the Orthrus has a really long reload time of Rapid Light Missiles before reapplying a large amount of its DPS (making it a pain to use sometimes). When using the Orthrus with Heavy Assault Missiles you get different problems. As the main source of DPS, you have to make it apply, and when running L3s you will encounter a rather large amount of Frigates and destroyers *(also a lot of application skills are blocked of by Omega)*
---
While it is possibile to run L3s with an Orthrus it will require fairly high skills as well, and as you are Alpha you will always lack at least 15% of your Damage just from the Caldari Cruiser V skill alone. 
---
With rather Low Skillpoints, and the price the Orthrus comes at, the Gila in comparison is far more viable because of its flat bonuses and ease of use. Otherwise, some other normal Cruisers and Battlecruisers are way better for the job as well.
---
If you want to fly an Orthrus really badly, I'd say that you should get into PvP. In small gang PvP, the Orthrus acts as very effective anti-tackle and tackle because of it's PvP based bonuses and Rapid Light Missiles. 
---
I can't imagine using an Orthrus for L4s, as you will probably lack the tank that is required, though I have never tried it, so not speaking of experience here. Running these you will probably want to hop into a Raven or if you like it expensive &amp; want to Blitz, the Machariel will be your best bet. *(The Barghest can run them quite comfortably as well, but you will get the same problems as mentioned above. Also has one less mid slot compared to the Raven, leaving even less space for application. You will notice the problems not quite as much though)* 
---
**-&gt; NOTE HERE**: *L4s are locked for Alpha players as of recently. Therefore Omega is required to run them. Making money is quite hard in that field for Alphas at the moment.* 
---
To sum it up: Orhtrus w/ RLML has too long of a reload and will be a pain to fly in missions. Orhtrus w/ HAMs probably won't apply well without good skills and the giving up on Tank. These two points suggest why people use the Gila over the Orthrus for PvE. Orthrus is far more viable in LS PvP as it is in PvE. Probably not viable for L4s, could go for Barghest, Raven or Machariel instead. (People have ran L5s in Barghests before, so maybe worth the investment)
---
If I got you wrong on this or you want to know things in even more detail feel free to hit me up.
---
More like Sort Dragon would like to know your location.
---
nuance is beyond them.
---
Damn BL/horde won all their fights but where not able to take branch that quite bad luck isn't? 
---
Hope they didn't wait to be as big as legacy or the imperium to do that.
---
This. If you don't have a corp/alliance to ask, then you probably shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
---
That is the risk that comes with the added reward of living in a wormhole. Wormholes never had stations to begin with, and they were not designed for long term habitation. It was the players that went into wormholes and made homes for themselves. That's the level of risk that you accept when living there, and you know better than to put all of your eggs in one basket.
---
i'm glad i resubed 2 accounts to not get those sp by hours and then to be told on my 2nd petition in 15 years to get fucked. i'm not throwing a fit but it's left a bad taste.
---
I would never ever set foot on a ship with this name. I'm not a superstitious person but this just don't feel right.
---
How about a Hindenburg 2?
---
Nonono.
---
Who?
---
ccp posted a fix in https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btz1pv/psa_dont_destroy_your_map/ 
---
    Workaround for maps in broken state - right click in broken map, select "World Map Control Panel - Search", select non-incursion category in Star Map - Stars, select Solar System Map, select Star Map.
---
    NB: You can press ESC to get rid of the loading bar that won't go away.
---
yeah fuck CCP, they're so greedy, giving me 1.25m SP for doing nothing different than I normally would.
---
Yup, spent 15 years saving up enough level 2 mission ISK to buy enough injectors to join an alliance that welcomes day 1 newbees. You figured me out.
---
Moved and went from Google fiber to a shit att connection, which means very few issues to tons of issues. If I login via tunnel bear through their UK connection, almost as good as it was with Google.
---
Yeah I don't get this. I missed the last couple of rewards and don't give a fuck. Who cares. If it never happened you wouldn't have had it either. 
---
I for one would be disappointed if Eve died since it's such a great concept and I don't know what I'd replace it with.
---
*Desire to know more intensifies*
---
I don't know whether you're intentionally poking or not, but honestly I don't get the afk crowd. Why play if that's all you do?
---
Hi, yes. Hello.
---
I've noticed that my older characters have considerably more latency to do just about anything.. Log in a fresh new account or alpha and things are fast.. what gives..
---
Great depression broke its neck.
---
You didn't stash everything you own in a POS. You stash what's needed and what you can afford to lose.
---
Seriously, just because you may only own a handful of ships and mods doesn't mean that there aren't players with trillions of ISK in assets that they may not want to see disappear just because they went on vacation.
---
tbf it does border on harassment how every idiot spams him with it any time anything about rorquals comes up on r/eve
---
thanks for your help, also appart from fitting what skills i should upgrade for these? I read social and communications are good for standings and missions
---
If people are afraid of losing their stuff in eve online there is a casual-friendly zone for them to keep their assets safely, it's called high-sec.
---
Well if you think that there's some moral good to other players funding the ISK for your playstyle, then the greatly increased value of PLEX provides an avenue there.
---
Citadels were directly pitched to replace POSes and Outposts were kind of rolled into them at the same time. People anchored their capitals and supers and titans and loads of ships at POSes all the time. It was an understood risk, and nobody complained about "if you want anyone to use POSes, there has to be an expectation of safety when not logged in". POSes were used regularly and it added a risk/reward element to the game that Eve people are so fond of. 
---
Citadels provide no risk and give you all the reward, for little effort and isk. It is no wonder they are spammed everywhere. For something that gives this much benefit for this little risk, accessibility is *far too easy*
---
the "does either side seriously consider this a war" war
---
the "citadel meta blueball" war
---
Quick! To the market-crasher-copter!
---
i think one constructive critism would be that more of the alpha awards should have been some hulls, or even modules of some sort. not even necessarily special editions ones. so many newbies in rookie help asked what was the point of the lore items.
---
Do you even read what I type?
---
Your argument is that we're losing this war because we're not all back home krabbing. That's your narrative. You've said it like 5 times now.
---
Logging in for 10 seconds once a day sure sounds like a lot of work
---
Take a look at: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wreathe/Fittings](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wreathe/Fittings)
---
I think your low slots are correct for what you're doing, but you want a 50mn, not a 5mn, if you fit a prop at all. You'll note that the fits on EVE-uni are using some meta modules rather than T1. The metas are often cheaper.
---
Well, only if you are seriously superstitious, otherwise its great PR move.
---
Yep, looks good.
---
&gt;MCAV would like to know your location
---
Gonna second the other guy, who?   
---
Also- you look real salty whoever you are posting this.
---
No
---
Have you ever considered applying to ccp? That is exactly what they look for in community managers.
---
I'm not going to argue that that wasn't a stupid fucking narrative.
---
Dates were unclear if you haven't seen a calendar in your entire life, sure.
---
Hi not going to argue that that wasn't a stupid fucking narrative., I'm dad.
---
Also Turkey Cannon would be a nice name for the Molok exclusive DD
---
Open the Agency, select same mission, click on replay
---
I got a bunch of free shit. No one lost anything by not participating. Op is just salty.
---
Not seeing what is bad about 16 days long daily login fuckery is either trolling or stupidity dude, I won't even gonna argue.
---
&gt; I answered your question about 3 comments ago. You are deliberately stretching the comment chain just to see whether I'll say something I regret.
---
Highlight where you answered the part about how you intend to represent a playerbase without letting your internal biases come into play - in a business professional manner. Us low IQ individuals would love that!
---
1 isk is pretty cheap
---
I personally didn't like the event because it made me realise that CCP are likely going to roll out some Skinner Box-esque daily login for the game full time (something like War Thunder I'm imagining), and I think that doing that would be bad for the game.
---
I know exactly what the game used to be. I remember no warp to zero. I remember having 20,000 fucking bookmarks. I remember when bubbles would pull you out of warp anywhere. I remember cyno doomsdays. Fuck, I remember mines. So please tell me about how "it used to be".
---
You're a very angry little man, aren't you.
---
RMT stands for real money trading. It's a bannable offense and it's about as intentional as it gets.
---
well, maybe you shouldn't get or don't deserve the same reward as someone who does play 16 hours over two and a half weeks?
---
Social - 5% improved standings gains for all missions.
---
Connections - 4% effective standings increase for non-criminal NPC entities that you have positive standings with. 
---
Criminal Connections - 4% effective standings increase for criminal NPC entities that you have positive standings with.
---
Diplomacy - 4% effective standings increase with NPC entities you have negative standings with.
---
Negotiation: 5% increase in ISK payout per level trained
---
Distribution Connections: 10% increase in LP payout per level trained
---
it's funny because it does, op is just too retarded to figure it out
---
And everyone needs drones.
---
A couple of days ago we killed an Aeon. The guy that made the initial tackle was a long time player. But you should have listen to him on comms:
---
He was speaking with a very low and trembling voice. The guy was so nervous to not let that Aeon go away we could feel him shaking and trying to keep him self in control while under attack from the Aeon. "He is neuting me... I'm being hit by the fighters..." speaking in a fading voice while everybody was scrambling to support him.
---
I don't know any other game capable of putting a player in such an amount of stress. That's why I keep playing this game after 14 years.
---
It's very handy to explain any complains by "bitter vets bitching again", isn't it?
---
Now that I think about it... yeah Gal relies on drones more so you basically *have* to train drone skills for them
---
username checks out
---
Yet here you are trying to say being shit at piloting means the game isn't trying to cater to shit tier hisec bears
---
No one gives a damn yet you came here to leave this comment
---
Uhhh.....you login each day and get free loot.  What is there to hate?  If you couldn’t login you miss out....simple as that.
---
I swear CCP can’t win with most of you people.
---
Entitled brats.
---
&gt;I hated this fucking event, CCP. And if you make a survey to gather my opinion, but the only option I have is to praise this shit slightly or greatly - then you can grip your survey and shove it deep in your sly greedy ass. I'm out.
---
read this again and tell me if this is any way to get a point across. expressing one's self like an angry child will cause the opinion to be treated as such in any environment.
---
&gt;  torpedoes used to do AoE-damage
---
In large enough fights, AoE weapons are a pain for the server.  Imagine back to 2003 when EVE ran on Pentium 4s and a node could barely handle 250 people without shitting itself.  Add on that, a few dozen people shooting AoE damage missiles all over the place.  I'm pretty sure it was removed because of practical limitations.
---
funny, never heard ccp call out the cry babies xD 
---
are you suggesting this is something ccp needs more of?
---
It have nothing to do with the topic if I got reward or not. I have opinion and survey implies it is unimportant, which makes this survey pointless. That's all.
---
But if you curious you could make a quick search over my comments and find my exact opinion on the event.
---
It is when you have a life and need to plan everything around Eve, like carrying a laptop with you just to log in or tell your girlfriend to log in for you..   
---
Overall, was the event fun or made me enjoy Eve even more? Fuck no!!!
---
*mouth breathing intensifies*
---
Congrats, You passed the first test.
---
Alpha cannot do PI otherwise it will be heavily abused
---
Reading between the lines bro... learn it, teach it to ccp
---
To expand the player base that this would affect, how about providing this feature for smaller ships such as a faction battleship?  The cannon would be downsized for a battleship of course, and would use much less bio-ammo.  Then more players could have the satisfaction of using an enemy's own body against them.
---
Ooh, boy. Here we go.
---
Yeah, Sion was a grade A shitler, and if you thought he was a shitty diplo in the game, you should have met him in real life. What a fucking sycophantic little buddy-fucking, bus driving apparatchik that dude was. I was glad to be rid of him.
---
As for the Viceroy program, well that was the point. It was supposed to piss people off. No one is supposed to like the idea of being invaded and conquered and forced to be subservient. The game had gotten so fucking stale by that point that we had to figuratively hold all of lowsec hostage before anyone bothered to fight us. Of course, that plan worked a little too well.
---
And yes, most of the war was absolutely directly funded by IWI. They were reimbursing losses from even the largest alliances attacking us. There are plenty of chat logs still floating around to corroborate this. And no one ever (seriously) accused CCP of anything other than continuing to allow an entity to retain an income stream that could not be attacked. Now there was some bullshit bluster from Mittens about "the evils of gambling", but that was all pretty cringe worthy posturing. But again, you seem to only know what your side told you after the fact.
---
15/16 days I see
---
There will occasionally be some friendly faces decloak beside you and light a cyno
---
Don't worry or panic, they are here to bring more friends :)
---
Hi can you rephrase that sentence to only include praise for how good I am. Thank you.
---
So only people with no lives should live outside of highsec?
---
I enjoyed the event and i don't even play EVE anymore. Mainly because of the salt entitled bitches like you provide.
---
&gt; whereas for guns if you wanted to get the large autocannon spec you had to train small and medium specs before you could get large.
---
I do not miss that shit.  I remember training my toon around the Megathron way back when I was in university.  I'd be at the library and my study breaks would be spent ship spinning and watching my skill queue train light hybrid turret to 5, then light blaster and rail specs to 4, rinse and repeat.  And yeah, it wasn't just turret 5 and spec 1, it was turret 5 and spec 4.
---
Not as bad as, let's say, you sleep through the final exam
---
I didn’t have any problem on my 4 omegas but then again I’m actually playing the game and enjoying it so... wasn’t an issue for me.  
---
Maybe you just don’t enjoy eve anymore?
---
Stuff?  Can I has?
---
after CCP motherfuckers catering the game to noobs and carebears for 6-7 years straight and adding more and more safety into the game, you don't seriously expect them to step back even an inch, do you?
---
lmao gotg can't hurt anyone
---
Stuff??  Contract to Lana Rotanique pls thanks
---
As per usually ccp cant be bothered to add this shit to overviews so you have to do to. Make a note for EVERY PATCH it happends regularly.
---
The biggest annoyance when they patch shit.
---
Let's also not forget how back in the day, we had way more names for missiles with different damage types than we do now.  For EM, what may have been called a "Paradise" EM cruise missile would be called something different for the EM equivalent of the small and light missiles.
---
Well myself along with my other buddies that have been playing for a few months found this even great, free stuff along with a good amount of skill points... We were more than happy, can’t say the same about the vets in this thread.
---
Let me introduce you to the hidden tech that is the celestis. The only ship in the game that has a range bonus to damps. Along with centurion implants for another +25ish% bonus to range
---
Nice explanation would be an ingame celebration by CONCORD regarding capsuleers having 16 (I think it's 16 years?) of independence, and their actual investment into the universe and breaching the horizon of humanity daily.
---
But that would require creativity.
---
And a super logged off at a POS ran the risk of logging back in to a bubble, but even then, when the POS was destroyed you still had a super and all you needed to assure its safety was a cyno alt. The only way you could lose a super when logged off is if you left it in a CSMA, which was pretty rare.
---
Again, even with POSes, you still had outposts and stations that DID provide 100% asset safety, where even if you lost access to your stuff, you still didn't lose everything. You just had to go through some hoops to get it back or firesale it. 
---
Citadel spam is the real problem.
---
I can't say it's RMT, but it's definitley not not RMT
---
Reticuli... Is this you?
---
i mean you're the one saying you'll quit over it, not me.
---
I bet CCP is staying a float because the other game developers are paying them to “contain” all the players.  Think of it as the Australia of the virtual world.
---
Holy shit this has to be copypasta.
---
It’s amazing how the official subreddit of a game with one of the most dedicated fan bases around has nothing but shitty things to say about literally everything about it.
---
Do you even enjoy the game at all?
---
Didn't do that, by the way.  My unsubbed accounts stayed so, I didn't even bother logging in for the alpha rewards.  Had one account training skills because it's on the $8/month promotion they had 2 years ago (time ends in December), that I logged in for the skill points, and haven't logged in since.  
---
And I probably won't log on for a while, because 64-bit client sounds nice but I'll give them a few months to work out the bugs.
---
My point was posted elsewhere. There is just my complaint that I could not express it thought the survey.
---
The question wasn't greed, but expectations of some form of entertainment and/or engagement. People do shit to you that doesn't cost you any money and little time every day; are you ecstatic over all of it? You may want to see a doctor if so.
---
not sure you are using the term correctly.
---
i though dead zoning an outpost was to take it from an enemy, and give it to a corp with only a couple of characters in it to hold it for years. so the enemy could never access the assets in the outpost by putting a spy character in your main alliance.
---
CoH, currently, for me.
---
&gt;And if you truly believe someone shouldn’t openly write or talk about their view of the world solely because they are mentally ill  
---
Not what i said at all but ok. if you knowingly emit nonsense you need to be able to deal with the reactions thats all.
---
If i act like an idiot i expect people to treat me as anyone else who acts like that too. Equality goes both ways. (Unless ofc you promote an unopposed spread of **every** sort of worldview from anyone. That includes stuff like racism. *youre a racist now, how does it feel to have your words taken out of context?*
---
- sincerely, someone on the spectrum whos fed up by concern trolls
---
And that proofs what exactly? Event is debatable at best, and it have nothing to do with me being a bitter vet or not. I could bring arguments if you like, but it's beyond the topic of this thread. Topic is that survey does not allow any negative feedback, you see. Not that if negative feedback is justified or not.
---
Not directly penalise no but there should be game mechanics to combat it. This is where CCP failed post skill injection.
---
I am in favor of penalising individuals who's sole purpose is to break/kill the game. Those individuals have no love for the game and likely are sad, narcissistic individuals.
---
Dscan desync says "hi" as well.
---
you're missing out if you haven't flown cruise ravens before, 800 DPS application at *300KM* is nuts.
---
Good spin, but not what I said. If these elusive casual players that are also isk trillionaires don't have the sense to move their stuff out of vulnerable locations before taking an extended break from the game, then the game should punish them for it. Do you think the game should also auto-warp you to the nearest friendly citadel if you decide to go afk while krabbing ?
---
The fact that you nullseccers keep advocating for your risk-free safe spaces validates OP's point.
---
You didn't, but people that created staggering 100+ SP-Farm-Accounts would consider taking far above 100 Mio SP for free to extract &amp; sell, bringing the calculation into slightly profitable regions again
---
You get:
---
1. Sunesis Purple (Twitch-themed) Exclusive skin + ship
---
2. 150.000 SP
---
3. 15 days omega
---
What I said was that even an experienced pilot can make a single mistake that leads to an epic fuck up. Most games are much more forgiving than that. But please keep attacking me to make yourself feel superior.
---
Hard to feel bad for someone who deliberately does things to garner attention. Albeit it hasn't done anything like that in a good bit.
---
Just wrap a new paper around last year's gift. No one would notice
---
RMT works these days via getting "scammed" or some kind of "market pricing error" its impossible for CCP to prove otherwise.
---
lol that happens once got stuck in a big old null sec Veldspar it encompassed the whole darn ship
---
&gt; Camping people's staging stations
---
gotta agree on this. even though i've only experienced it slightly. camping the undock of NPC station in X-7OMU when we lived in 7RM-NO.
---
Your posting history is amazing
---
Ex-cavator huh?
---
yes hauling 18k plex into stain for 0.01isk each, a mistake i often make myself
---
Old chars have more data to load:  corp history, wallet history, killmails, ingame mails, etc, etc.
---
The regular raven still does. :)
---
I reckon its an alt of RiotRick, SLYCE's executor
---
Which Wormhole Class do you live in, 2 Friends and myself  were playing in a C3 Bit got evicted After a  month since we couldn’t defend well enough, so we are looking for a new home and might want to merge over :)
---
my hope is the settings are easy mode now so people transitioned happily to citadels. once the transition is complete there will be some balance passes to make things steadily harsher. there is a lot of tweaks that could happen to citadel mechanics.
---
How are they elusive. You're talking to one right now. A person with a decade and a half of assets who enjoys the nulsec lifestyle for the most part, but who also has a job that sends me to other side of the planet on several hours notice for weeks on end. Granted, I'm an extreme outlier case, but again, what you're saying is that if someone's kid ends up in the hospital for a week then they should get fucked and lose everything. Or how about anyone in the military who gets deployed for months on end and happens to have millions of m3 of stuff? What if someone is a long haul trucker? What if a person loses power for a week? Should they just know to move everything they own to hisec every time there's a storm? Without asset safety there is a large portion of the population that would essentially be excluded from most of the game.
---
If there wasnt 2 vigil pilots from Theran alliance. result could have been worse tho. 
---
Just saying.
---
Counterpoint:  
---
This event was made to encourage players to login. I didnt feel encouraged. I felt hounded. It was a negative experience. I did not make the million skillpoints because I had a week long businesstrip AND I WAS ATTENDING A WEDDING FROM A FELLOW EVE PLAYER.  
---
they want people to feel encouraged? they failed. Its negative. end of story. youre logic doesnt change how  Ifeel, and I dont give a damn what your opinion of my feelings are...CCP apparently does. They sent out a survey...the survey kinda sucks if its not capturing my sentiment.
---
Yeah it’s a bit to do and I run multiple accounts. So more passive than other stuff but to do a full pickup of P1 and drop off to production planets can take me around two hours. Granted I only do this every few days but not “passive” but also easier than mining, etc.
---
I do PVE with cruise, PVP with torps. Thats 50-60 days of training for large guns, as opposed to the 20-30 I spent for each other race's guns.
---
I could spend those extra 30 days I'll spend training torps V to train either:
---
- 3 races of destroyer to V (i.e can use all T3Ds, since I already have minnie) 
---
- 3 races of frigates to V (same as above).
---
- One race's BC to V, unlocking command ships
---
- Basically every remaining support skill I don't have trained to level 4/5
---
- Industry to keep my account plexed semi passively
---
-  A BS skill to V (i think? maybe a bit too long there) to unlock a new marauder/blops.
---
- Hictors (I have all cruisers V)
---
- A significant part of Logi V 
---
- Industrials/freighters to make logistics easier
---
all of which would unlock significant amounts of new content.
---
Instead I need to spend it stupidly completing a set of weapons I already should have, if they were any other race (and I do have all the other ones already...)
---
I'm not placing restriction here, I'm considering it relative to its relevant counterparts, as I believe you should when analyzing weapons platforms.
---
The gun platforms don't need to train "artillery" and "autocannons", why should missiles train "torpedoes" and "cruise missiles" if a good platform needs both? I don't consider the "RHML" argument since that's even newer than caldari's main damage being acknowledged as missiles, and even then it's a bonus weapon.

---
Nice. Maybe I wont cancel it after all
---
Yup, been having a lot more connectivity and performance problems since I came back from a break a couple months back. Most of the problems are connection related though, like having at least one "Network Communications Has Been Interrupted." per 1-hour+ session, sometimes more.
---
Pretty decent offer, I wonder how many new players will look at eve due to the twitch prime loot.   
---
If you pay for your gametime to eve with a recurring monthly subscription, it's worth just buying a month of prime and then cancelling, since you get $7.5 worth of gametime, plus approx 3 days worth of allocatable SP. You might also be able to get the eve loot by just trialing prime and cancelling, which would be nice.
---
Welcome back! Make sure to check /r/evejobs if you need a corp.
---
i remember mining in an Osprey before upgrading to a hulk.
---
Are you trying to summon are lord and savior Stainguy?
---
The whole purpose of these events is solely to boost their daily login numbers. Nothing else. But they did fuck up the dates.
---
No.  It's just a fantasy.
---
Now this is accuracy!
---
Fuck twitch. Seriously tired of their business practices and them demanding to sell me "loot" for games I already own and pay for, by buying amazon shit.

Goonswarm Federation.  The unequivocal "big bad wolf" that Reddit likes to hurf and blurf about - mostly out of admiration and sometimes jealousy.  Goonswarm Federation is a group of highly intellectual pilots and corporations that interact through the most sophisticated tools available in the world. Anyone opposed to Goonswarm likely suffers from THUCTAU Syndrome.
---
is it about some diamond rat pvp?
---
Don’t you remember a couple years ago they did almost exactly what you are describing and people lost their fucking minds until it was removed.
---
I wouldn't say there's any added reward of living in a wormhole really. Not more than nullsec anyways. Unless you count not getting blobbed by caps all the time a reward for living there. And Nullsec is supposed to be the intended most dangerous place of kspace, it should have never been made so safe. I've heard a couple of ideas for reworking asset safety that makes it better in my book:
---
1. When a citadel is destroyed, asset safety costs go to the attacker. Not sure exactly how it would be divided.
---
2. Asset safety scales with the security. So 1.0 might be 100% or 90%, 0.5 might be 75%, all the way to -1.0, where it's 0% (or maybe keep a little asset safety, like 25%), determined randomly by the loot fairy.
---
3. 50% asset safety, loot fairy style
---
4. No asset safety
---
I'd be ok with all of those systems. #2 might be interesting, because maybe you'd keep your loot in stations where security is highest and have to travel to truesec systems to rat or mine. Would create more fights and nice opportunities.
---
If you want full asset safety with no risks, stay in NPC null.
---
T2 adaptives on a hel. *cries in faction tank*
---
I was at a meetup recently and a guy who hasn't logged in in forever was doing the event, and hitting the login screen to get his rewards.  A few of the times he actually logged all the way into the game.  That's an anecdotal experience that is achieving what CCP and game devs are probably going for: turn on the computer.... you don't have to play, no, no, but I mean, since you're already here and it's so easy to login.
---
What you're suggesting accomplishes nothing.  Dudes who don't login to the actual game to play still aren't going to log in to play for a carrot on a stick.  I think there's more critical thought put into the login screen rewards than you think.
---
Chimera is bonused to Shield resists and Archon is bonused to armor.  If your one and only goal is to carrier rat, I'd recommend a Nidhogger or Thanatos for the drone bonuses.
---
Don't sit on trillions of assets? You can sell or you can move assets around. If someone wants to stuff all their stuff into one place they should need to take that risk.
---
Or they could actually fix the game without making it worse.  But that would take a set of balls and some wildly unpopular decisions.  Eve is dying.  Time for a new hobby.  I picked up mountain biking and mountaineering and kiteboarding personally.
---
&gt;I'm out.
---
Good riddance.
---
Eve is like a paintba game. Everyone shoots each other and yells their war cries, but very few are actually unfriendly. Everyone there signed up for paintball, after all.
---
Calling this solo pvp.. would be like the british saying they won the second world war solo. But its in delve... so you can take your upvote. I enjoyed this.
---
Please do, and fly it straight into GE-, plenty of noob ass will get toasted i'm sure.
---
My point is that CCP doesn’t owe anybody anything, if you don’t like it or don’t like the game then don’t play it. You didn’t pay for this event, nobody forced you to attend.
---
Yeah dude, that 16 day grind... uhgg bro I feel you.  Are you going to be okay?  Hopefully your social life and metal will recover from cliking a few buttons every day for 16... SIXTEEN days in a row?!?! 
---
Brutal.
---
Fuck, agreeing with a goon....
---
Imagine being so desperate to minimize losses that you decide it's better to look less literate than a third grader.
---
Well, the rest of us have to.  You just did it.
---
This was before osprey had mining bonuses and before bulges existed. After barges came out then yes they were certainly superior. But you know Miner I and II modules (and also the deep core miner)? The not strip ones? Those where what we had before :P
---
Back in the day wormwholes were where the real money was, but I will concur that the buffs to nulsec over the last few years have tipped that scale. And I also agree that nulsec is too safe. I like the idea of having to pay the attacker to get your stuff back. Gives incentive to grind through structure shoots while still completely punishing a defender for being AFK for an extended amount of time.
---
It's not my place to say it's RMT*
---
Gets a change to collect a bunch of items and SP for free by game developers.

The BLOT war.  
---
BLOT is hybrid for Blob/Bot
---
thank you dude, anything more? i will search something for more warp speed or atleast for overpower the rigs i have / cargo even if i dont need more, easy skills to have i think
---
Vacancy War? Glass War? Tribute War? Who knowz.
---
Seems to me that all these poor souls you talk about did just fine under the previous system where, if someone took your outpost, you'd be simply locked out of your assets. Doesn't help your case that you describe yourself as an "extreme outlier", proceed to describe a bunch of edge cases and then claim that you all represent "a large portion of the population".
---
&gt;Should they just know to move everything they own to hisec every time there's a storm?
---
This is pretty hilarious, are you now at the stage where you're claiming that without asset safety, anyone who doesn't log in every single day will lose everything they've ever owned ?
---
Caught in the landslide
---
&gt;The price thing is a good point, but I'm pretty sure panfam is renting space in Vale, Tribute, Malpais, and Kalevala.
---
The price for those other regions is affected by the price for Tribute.
---
"No, we'll totally protect Vale even though we abandoned Tribute!!" is not exactly believable.
---
&gt;but to burn down all of panfam's rental regions, it would take roughly 4.5 more months at their current pace
---
Nothing says they have to be "burned" all at once.
---
Burn Tribute -&gt; go krab -&gt; burn Vale -&gt; go krab....
---
When your ship blows, you lose roughly half your stuff. 
---
If your RMT supplier can acquire PLEX for say 25% of the going rate through bots or not having a life, they can load up a ship for you to "happen" to find and "kill". 
---
It looks cleaner on the admin side of things, as it's just another high value kill.  You scoop the loot and stash the PLEX.
---
Isn't it free? What do you have to buy?
---
Jesus these replies are a train wreck, even by r/eve standards.
---
All actual opinions of the event aside, it's dishonest as fuck to send out a survey with no option for negative feedback.  That's not a survey, it's fabricating statistics.

I tried to log in every day, but I could not log in at the same time consistently so the "days" got weird in the end. Sometimes I could log in the morning, but then only late in the evening the next day. Somehow caused me to miss days and I came up four days shy of the skillpoints.
---
You've been away for 4 years, you need to build up your cache again.  Try downloading more RAM, that will help.  :p

I don't know, I've been playing less than 3 months and I quite enjoyed the event, I got clothing, standing boosters, facial things to make me look weird in a good way, lore tidbits that made me look up what they were about, ships skins, new ships I've never flown before and nearly 20 days worth of skill points all for logging in daily, which is something I was doing anyway, for me it was great.
---
Yeah. We meant different things. I meant timezones where you can't find fuckall to kill.
---
It used to be between 8-14 ET, now it is more.like between 20 and 17
---
still dont give a damn, still leaving comments. dont try your mental gymnastics here xD
---
Go to wormholes
---
Prime
---
You should quit like you said you were going to. After that, just fuck off.
---
I understand your feelings but here's a hard truth for you.
---
Did CCP constantly tell you to login and claim rewards? They did not: they only gave rewards. The only one hounding and pressuring you was yourself. While your personal desire to reap maximal benefit is valid and certainly a source of personal pressure, you should not hold that against CCP and instead admit personal responsibility for those feelings.
---
You were busy with a business trip. That's fine. I understand, I was also traveling and graduating during that time. However, in the end, it's only you stressing yourself out over the possibility of some free space pixels. Nobody is to blame for that but you.
---
CCP offered a gift for participation. This is not how you accept the possibility of a gift like a mature adult. HTFU.
---
SSD
---
Great event. Would participate again.
---
double u
---
Yes. This. Please come and whoop our asses. We won't be able to stop you.
---
that's handy
---
guess I'll finally do the Prime trial that I never bothered to do because who cares about subbing to people on Twitch
---
You can make another account and get the prime trial to get it
---
Take a look at these settings, check if it improves by changing them a few at a time.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/95tm0i/while\_waiting\_for\_64bit\_client\_here\_are\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/95tm0i/while_waiting_for_64bit_client_here_are_some/) 
---
That being said, the game is a lot bigger now. Grids are truly insane in size and there's more structures than you can shake a stick at (visit 1dq keepstar(s) in delve with a travelceptor if you wish to see a truly insane grid). The first time you undock (or click show outside of a structure) you also load up the skins as far as I know, then it keeps that in memory as far as I know so then its quicker to undock later in the session.
---
Yeah you used to be able to put cruise missiles inside a light missile launcher, and you could get 3 of them inside a t1 launcher iirc. So you would get cruise missile Kestrels that had incredibly high volley damage (for the time, before CCP buffed most ships raw HP by about 2-3x)
---
They should be paying me to even bother to log in, tbh
---
He has missing brain cells.
---
We're all playing the same game. Mutual self interest is a thing.

---
TMK they tried to use bouncers in that fight.
---
read this again and tell me if this is any way to get a point across, also how good is EmpireBuilderBTW ?!
---
You're not wrong.
---
I liked the old EVE birthdays more where they just gave a gift to everyone and you had like 6 months to redeem it. No "log in on 16 days to get all rewards" event. I guess they need to boost the log in numbers, so "log in everyday for a reward" is now the way to go for them.
---
this is the coldest thing ive read since i woke up. i am proud and mortified of your initiative. May your corruption spead upon many mobile platforms my friend.
---
I like this idea best of the ones in this thread. Provides a reward for actually engaging with the game
---
The Janitorial War
---
Goons are clearing out Panfam space to reduce potential rental income.
---
Everyone else is clearing Goons space of congesting Krabs that should be renters.

Can you do anything without benefitting Goons in some way?

Thanks for your constructive criticism.

&gt;I'm not a superstitious person but this just don't feel right

i have seen you somewhere in horde space, i am sure of it...

I sincerely thank you for driving our krabs out of the anoms and into space to enjoy Eve Online: Serious Internet Spaceship game. It's not the most exciting of evictions, but at least some people are getting out of Delve
---
I can throw my buddy 5 bucks while I get free eve shit fuck amazon tho
---
&gt; Highlight where you answered the part about how you intend to represent a playerbase without letting your internal biases come into play
---
1) You asked whether I would represent *you*. I said there is literally 4-5 people I wouldn't have a beer with over Eve. One is you. [And then I said I wouldn't represent those people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bwqvra/i_am_olmeca_gold_i_made_one_of_the_most/eq4ydc8/). That's the extent of my internal biases.
---
2) For everyone else you might think I'd have a problem representing, I said there is no problem here. I said, if they agree with my ideas, they'll vote for me and get represented. If they don't, then they won't get represented. There is by definition no room for any kind of bias to interfere with that picture. I said that in the [second post of this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bwqvra/i_am_olmeca_gold_i_made_one_of_the_most/eq305rf/).
---
&gt; I've been a mod here for just shy of 2.5 years.
---
I didn't say you've known me for 3 years or talked about me for 3 years. 
---
3 years ago, I was doing 1/10 of my fleets to Deklein. We at times bragged about killing a Goon carrier or two because it was, as always, an accoplishment to kill stuff in Goonspace. I was arguing farming in null is too safe. And I was getting shat on by Goon linemembers. The more such arguments I made, the more I attracted Goon linemember flak. 
---
I agree when I moved to Delve and began focusing on Goons, the nature of their interest in me changed. In that sense, I only became a true "cannon fodder" in this last year, finally getting pointed at by Mittens and such. But that doesn't change my claim that I've been dealing with Goon metagame for over 3 years.
---
He's making fun of it because that's what Brave used to do to everyone ELSE.
---
T1 version should always be aligned and warp out when yellow boxed. If they're not that's their error, and they learn. :)
---
Nice. I like free stuff
---
Event was quite dull and way too long. I have grabbed 1 mil SP on my Omega accounts and never bothered too much with Alphas.   
---
CCP could improve situation in future if they consider few adjustments:  
---
- Do not place top reward (like that 1 mil SP) as the last tier reward. Make second best reward last. That way you'll evade any possible dissatisfaction.
---
- Make event shorter, it's not that interesting and most of us will just forget to login.
---
- If you absolutely need long duration event - make each reward tier last two days so there is more time to grab items. 
---
- Combine small rewards even more. Apparel, trinkets, skins are cool and all (not really, who am I kidding) but they are not the reason you'll log to the game each day. CCP you can do better.
---
- Fireworks are useless as they are now. Convert them to SKIN-like system (select specific firework from menu in fitting) and allow usage from any ship without festival launcher and then we'll talk.
---
- Faction ammo is not that good now. You can always enable distribution of those unpublished Advanced Tech 2 ammo (Lux, Blaze etc) for a great reward tier instead.
---

Wow, I whiffed that one hard. And I even used to be one of those lol

Great, now I have cancer
---
&gt; What is included in this offer?
---
&gt; Sunesis Purple (Twitch-themed) Exclusive Skin + ship that is excellent for new players – worth $5 
---
&gt; 150.000 Skill Points - to help you develop quickly in areas you desire - worth $2.5 
---
&gt; 15 days of Omega time, EVE Online’s premium subscription - unlocking all ships, skills and double the training speed – worth $7.5
---
As an already active Omega, I don't see anything reflecting the additional 15 days of Omega time when I redeemed it. Then again I'm on an annual sub so I never took that much of a close eye on it.
---
In Soviet CCCP negative feedback is just an unnecessary nuisance.
---
Why? What did you expect them to do, have a big party in Jita?

That's just bad leadership, not eve.

I will brawl on a taipan...change my mind :D

---
It’s definitely got worse, and it’s a pain in the arse.
---
Uhmm... I will look into it when I get home!
---
The skin isn't big deal, but 15 more days of Omega will be enough to let me finish a skill plan before my sub ends.
---
Rikeka is my main and its in Horde, so of course.

CCP does owe me something if I pay for subscription. At least something like not treating me like a fucking hamster without personal life with sole purpose of bumping their statistics on daily basis.
---
Gamemasters are not architects of events like this. They are not designers, nor coders. They are customer service reps.
---
&gt;So yeah you dropped some fortizars, destroyed some cap and supercap and elo shows his bait-rag when you were all ready and DC was the weakest.
---
For 2.5 months you guys would dock up everything in Branch and Deklein when we pinged for fleets. Supers, Rorquals, etc., you all hid in your forts, were unable to contest us anchoring stuff and fed more than a dozen supercarriers and half a dozen titans to us over the course of the campaign, I dunno man that sounds like a pretty solid deployment.
---
Turns out that after gathering 60% of the AU TZ players in the game along with a large Chinese and a moderate Russian alliance, you could coward tank your sov and coast out that way.
---
And yet people have mining fleets in Anoikis. In my opinion it says more about the people and their mindset than anything.
---
Soon enough more than 20k chars logged in at a time on a weekday would be quite an event, so let's celebrate!

I think he just did when he made this post.

#SWORDFLEET IS A LEGITIMATE DOCTRINE

#FABIAN TACTICS WILL WIN US THE NORTH BACK
---
Serious question here (and be honest); if excavator drones didn't generate killmails, would you still make the effort to kill them?
---
Typical Goon, missing the forest because there's too many trees in the way...
---
Nice one mate :)
---
It would not be SHIT as fuck?
---
I mean, even to T2 fit it would be so bad
---
Is that why some of those ships just evaporated? I couldn't tell if this was actually solo or not. I guess that answers it.
---
What the fuck happened to darkness
---
I agree.
---
I think skill injectors could be a good idea if you could inject only a very few amount of SP per year. Or maybe, we could skip it and rethink the whole idea of attributes and remaps.
---
Would be cool too if we could accelerate our skill points per hour using iskies (to remove a lot of isk from the game), but a very small acceleration. I dont know
---
All I will say now is that I really wish some of the other ideas for asset safety were the ones that made it into the game.
---
yeah he's using friendly diamond rats to kill the filthy delve residents
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JEPqPPKv3jLG-x-NczEl_WPApLyJGGNe5ER7s8o9mI/edit is an interesting read on it by /u/suitonia if you're curious
---
If you guys have suggestions for what I should do in coverage for CSM 15, now is the time to suggest it BTW - I am interested in hearing what people think would make the election easier to follow, without requiring me to feed people what I specifically think, as I would rather my audience be able to make up their minds for themselves :)
---
pepperidge farm remembers
---
unless something has changed recently drones MWD based on range to target?  which means they pulse MWD if they are faster than a target, burn MWD continuously if they are slightly slower a target, and comedy option when ~ &gt;10km/s faster they will burn MWD continuously because their orbit aliases out of range on every tick (which can amusingly prevent you from being able to recall your own drones except by abandoning and scooping)
---
the ideal scenario is for the drone to be slightly faster than the target so the interval between pulses is long but the orbit is dragged to minimal transversal allowing them to apply maximum with little regard for signature.  on the flip side, if your tank is primarily sig based you generally want to stop your ship entirely to force the drones to a higher transversal orbit.  in the event that the drones are unable to apply damage due to orbiting under their own guns, though, the clever player will alternately recall and engage their drones at the edge of the drone optimal so that they are repeatedly taking a shot or two on the low transversal re-approach.
---
Implying half the sub even plays
---
Probably just was cloaked at a perch, and decloaked to warp to the hel at 0.
---
and I assume this is not available for steam players?
---
Really gets the noggin joggin
---
Hey dude how about this - I'll pay you 2bil for eating your own shit. 2bil just for 5 minutes of eating shit and couple of clicks, how about that? I'm not forcing you to attend, I just say that you could be a shit-eater, you see.
---
I'm serious by the way, just record it on video (don't forget to write your nickname on paper and show it btw) and I'll pay.
---
I've had it ever since I could remember in 2011, across 2 different PCs.
---
I always assumed it was because of shitty Australian internet forcing me to take forever to connect. 
---
I didn't realise that it wasn't normal until everyone started posting about it.
---
Sacrifice him to odin

Link the slasher fit man.
---
Can I scan down jetcans with combat probes?
---
where else could I try it if not here
---
There didn't use to be a restriction on what you fit to a ship.  If it had enough grid and CPU, you could use it.
---
You could fit one cruise launcher (torp didn't fit).
---
Heck, really far back, there was no restrictions on the same module, so could fit multiple AB and activate them all.
---
It's free if you have amazon prime, which a lot of people do because it's awesome.
---
Haha. Score!
---
Tuck-tail between Legs &amp; Run Away War!
---
5 other alliances lost more people last week. One alliance lost over half of their members. With all this salt I can only ask you to do one thing.
---
Show me on the doll where Theran touched you
---
&gt; unless something has changed recently drones MWD based on range to target?
---
drones mwd based on whether or not they are responding to a new command, not distance to target. ordering them to attack a target or return to your ship, or if they are on aggressive and their target dies so they attack a new one, all of these will cause them to mwd
---
distance to target does not
---
it's a common trick to engage them, then pull when the mwd runs out, then engage them again, but that really only works for covering long distances, not chasing fast moving targets
---
the rest of your post is invalid based on this flawed premise sorry bud
---
Because people would bitch literally about any way they could reasonably deliver the sp. If they literally gave 1m sp to every account in existence unconditionally this sub would have posts from people complaining that it somehow hurt the economy or how it's not enough to encourage to play the game or how it's a grand pearl abyss cover-up. A large portion of the sub don't even play the game, they just want to be bitter towards literally anything related to it because they miss when it was more fun.
---
They don;t have investors anymore.  they are owned by a bigger company.  That company has investors, but technically CCP doesn;t
---
Question about fleets...
---
1. If someone attacks me in high-sec and they belong to a fleet, can I attack him back without his entire fleet being able to attack me? 
---
2. If someone is a flashing criminal in high-sec can I attack him without fear of his fleet attacking me?
---
3. If someone invites me to a fleet, can they freely attack me?
---
Basically, how does a fleet affect you? I've been invited to fleets, but fear that the members there will just destroy me. I've also been in positions to kill flashy criminals, but fear it's just bait and his fleet will warp in and kill me. 
---
What are the rules here?
---
Move to China. They might still be on that version.
---
I thought it was cool, they gave me stuff I didn't have before and now I'm richer.
---
Lol
---
The majority of their members are not willing to suck goon dick so are abandoning ship.
---
All that will be left is bots eventually.
---
fucking nerd
---
How is the Svipul currently? It seems that Hecate is FotM, is it really much worse?
---
The NPC battleships are no joke. In some of these clips there's over 3k DPS on grid.
---
I think you are doing a great job so far. It is good to see someone conducting these interviews.
---
10/10 would faq again
---
So if you have amazon prime you can get this benefit for free? That's kinda sweet.
---
Can I link this offer to an *existing* Alpha account if I already have Amazon Prime?
---
An event that involved goals you could work to complete  would've been better .
---
I'm not sure being [this guy](https://zkillboard.com/kill/70644050/) is any better
---
amazing how much CCP lost track of the game being a sandbox in their desire to control/balance out things they didn't like.
---
Yeah, they don't tend to get much traction on Reddit, but they seem quite popular on the forums/Discords, which works for me! I'm glad to see people are still invested in the process and want to pick the right candidates for them, as far as I'm concerned that's by far the most important thing for the CSM.
---
The problem is not with the "gift" (by the way I believe gift is something freely given without any conditions, in this case this is a reward), but with conditions on which it is given out. I'll go to extreme here and I hope you won't feel offended, but I believe you won't feel good if someday CCP would offer you to literally eat shit to "earn a gift". You would feel insulted and offended, especially if you pay for your subscription. It does not mater if you attend or not, it is just insulting to offer you something like this.
---
😮😮😮
---
Correct.
---
Some stuff late Friday the 21st including bar crawl. Main events are Saturday and Sunday the 22nd and 23rd.
---
Train your navigation skills. They'll improve every ship you fly, but they're especially valuable here: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Navigation . Also, train your Minmatar Industrial skill and Spaceship Command as high as they will go.
---
I feel weird that I am getting 15 days of omega and some SP for basically nothing.
---
Somewhere deep down in the T&amp;C's there has to be something where my rectal cavity can be interrogated by Jeff Bezos at a moments notice.
---
categories of candidate, short summaries of their platform and their experience
---
also spell olmeca correctly rip
---
Honestly, I would say the problem is less the drifter, and more that the cap escalations have shit payout and basically force you to just use dreads if you use caps at all.  Upping the escalations payout by 60 mil or so total and changing the carrier and fax escalations to something more suitable for those ship types to complete would both make capital ratting more attractive and give some variety to the caps used.
---
This. People are so entitled for shit nowadays
---
lowsec moongoo =/= jump fatigue
---
Svipul is definitely one of the weaker T3Ds at the moment and would lose a 1v1 against a competent blaster Hecate. This is also a weird fit I probably wouldn't recommend; it was just because I wanted something dual-prop, armor, and able to deal with Jaguars.
---
L4s are much more lucrative though, and the fastest missions if you're looking to grind reputation with missions.  Those run up to 8000m^3.  So, a T1 a full low of cargo expanders.  Find a mission hub that has multiple distribution agents, do two or more missions at a time.
---
Ask for all the missions, and accept all the ones that go one direction, but don't refuse the others.  Do all the ones going one way, save the ones that go the other way and do those on a return trip.  You can get a lot of missions done pretty quickly if you have a nice concentration of agents by just sweeping back and forth.
---
Only this time even Brave and Horde will reject your application
---
You are owed nothing. You make the choice to pay for the game. You don't have to pay. You still have to play and 'work' for what you want in the game
---
the irony
---
Were are the drifter ships ? and will said candidates champion the realise of drifter ships and drifter clone outfits to the player base.
---
its one of if not the top question all candidates should answer for CSM 15
---
I'm using this as my 'additional comments' section that should've been in the survey to release some of my internal salt. 
---
I'm pissed because I didn't get the 1m SP, why? Because I have a fucking life and obligations and can't be at my computer every single day, same thing happened during the last one. I try to be as active as I can but this is just a punch in the nuts for having a life outside of the game.
---
These daily log in events are a waste of time and effort and don't even increase the amount of people actually playing the game. How many of us were just logging in to the character screen claiming the rewards and then shutting the game down again every single day where you didn't have time to play? What kind of metric fuckery is this? 
---
FFS. Next it will be daily mining rewards or some shit, mine X amount of spod every day for a fucking month to be able to build your own event injectors that expire in 2 hours or some shit like that. 
---
I feel better now.
---
&gt; Good spin, but not what I said. 
---
He didn't say you said it, it was implied.
---
Also, I agree with him.  Based on what you said, you think only people who can devote 100% of their time as needed to EVE, should live outside of HighSec.
---
Also, I'm a "casual player" with boatloads of ISK (dob 5.19.2003).
---
If you think I want to spend a solid 2-3 days of hauling shit out of lowsec every time I take a week vacation or more, I'm guessing at least one of these two is accurate:
---
1) You're on drugs.
---
2) You're a moron.
---
If we had confidence this was "clearly" not RMT, we would have said so
---
Thanks, I found some fits online I planned to use.
---
I mean look at his eye, he's been squirted into more than once.
---
Wow I had not realised that was a thing, thanks
---
Nyx is 10b now- so.. about 4 PLEX
---
Soon (tm)
---
But like actually soon. I think panels are almost sorted out, I expect a schedule to be posted this weekend.
---
https://i.imgur.com/5Fd2Jem.png good thing he's around to tell us how to play the game, no ulterior motive for joining the csm i'm sure
---
it's definitely anecdotal evidence..
---
no u
---
Alpha no can do.  PI is only for Omegas, though you can have all three characters on an Omega account working PI without having all three with active training queues.
---
I'm pretty sure you also can't do it if you subscribe, get the skills, then unsubscribe.
---
how is sabber formed
---
how assembly array get pragnent
---
A few extra gnosis or sunesis would have been way better than lore stuff for alphas
---
The "Please never post again War" sounds fitting.
---
Its incentivization to keep the service. Amazon prime is weird, it includes TONS of stuff that people barely use that are all so widely different that even the people who use some of it wont use all of it. They're trying to make sure at the end of each month when people think hmmmm 12 more bucks for prime they'll think, well I do like that (free*) (insert random thing here) instead of saying, it's fine if my packages take an extra 2 days to get to me.
---
Advanced mental gymnastics. I was telling about a basic level of respect to a customer, not about "pay to win" fuckery.
---
no your spot on.
---
MAX Done Right

lol

Thanks my dude, lets hope that CCP agrees with your estimate :)

&gt; Episode 2 - The Imperium strikes back ! 
---
FTFY
---
Don’t die
---
Did you pay the Iron Price?
---
I’m so confused by what you’re saying here.
---
Are you trying to be ironic or do you really think that you were winning that war?
---
At this point it's both CCP and the local organizers. I'm somewhat involved in the process, and my estimate is that we're a few skype calls away from the schedule.
---
This. Oh, and fuck containers too.
---
eve gameplay, emergent gameplay, but not not shitty gameplay
---
Nice, activated an Indu char, pirate BPCs are stacking up way too high in the hangar. Time to build some.
---
Yeah they're gonna make us undock and mine for regards. No thanks.
---
Nope, I tried that as an Alpha a while back and you can't do that either.
---
What a casual pussy
---
If you took a look at my platform it's basically saying the same thing in a kinder, non-NSFW way.
---
I stand behind what's in the screenshot.
---
You only need industrial starting lvl 4. A probe is the obvious choice a sunesis is better. Once you reach lvl 4 agents it will open you some pirate epic arcs which are very valuable for a casual or new player.
---
Probably the biggest and most retarded example of false equivalence I've ever heard, but okay.
---
Gross
---
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR GOONIES
---
You dont need to expand the wreathe fit it for max speed and align the packages are like 5km3 max aair
---
It definitely would have!
---
I mean, obviously we disagree on that point.
---
While it's entirely possible I'm misremembering a detail, simply restating your opinion does not make it any more factual the second time around.
---
Considering that point is a premise for maybe two sentences of the post I... well, nevermind, actually.  I can see this is more about winning internet points than having a discussion for you, carry on.
---
LOL wtf?
---
That honestly sounds like a good idea for an isk sink. Make it market based; the more people using it, the higher the isk cost
---
I'm an average guy to be honest. And how's that a false equivalence? I'm offering you a game event with some conditions, what's wrong?
---
a  small &lt;7min summary of all candidates and their focus would be really nice
---
You best farm them with a dread. Farming them with an Astrahus is slow, somewhat tricky, and requires you to maintain hole control until they wander over to your planet, to prevent people from stealing your loot.
---
Whaaa my 0 risk tab f1 got contested!
---
In Stain? Not that risky. Who buys PLEX or even looks at the market in weird bits of nullsec? And you'd presumably put the order up in one client and alt-tab or tell your partner over voice comms in another, so the order would only be up for seconds.
---
You've got more Grr Olmec in you than I got Grr Goons in me.
---
Is logging in so offensive to you as eating shit?
---
The difference there is that asking someone to eat shit is inherently offensive. All I see from your post is that you feel entitled to the best rewards unconditionally as they are offered without a minimum of participation, just because you pay.
---
I would argue the opposite: a million skillpoints is a reward that is disproportionate to the effort of logging in, although the login requirement was a bit strict. They should have gated it behind in-game multi-stage content, ideally a co-op event.
---
&gt; 0 risk f1
---
You mean gatebosoning in Delve?
---
No, you cannot.
---
CCP has stated they are doing exactly that since the Abyss was introduced...
---
I'm going to be honest, you completely lost me.  You're talking about eating shit, I don't know if you mean literally or metaphorically, 2bil, I don't know where that came from, your whole post history reeks of a grown man child that's crying because CCP isn't cutting you a break because you somehow fucked up literally clicking 2 buttons... idk man.
---
Correct, it's not even justifiable mistyped or anything. Its blatent RMT and hopefully CCP has already banned the responsible parties.
---
Bring diamond back
---
Yeah I think escalation NPCs should have better isk/ehp as well.
---
Idk man, ask OP
---
Sure if you fix the survey and make CCP great again.
---
Dates were unclear?  You must be a valuable addition to your workplace.
---
You honestly don't even have to justify it, it's that good of a name.
---
it's not an opinion you doof it's an observable behavior and you're not misremembering it, you mislearned it
---
When you go to redeem it, it'll ask you to link your Eve account. Just activated it on an Alpha account
---
The time showed up on my plexed account, I normally plex around the 1st, and the game time now extends to the 15th.
---
Literally. 2bil because that's how much I'm currently could waste. Thanks for a free psychotherapist diagnostic, really appreciate it.
---
I didn't hate the event, but I am fucking disappointed with what they did with it.  I mean they could have had you fending off Triglavian all over hi/lo sec and then in the end Triglavian take like a dozen systems inbetween all the 4 empires turning them into a no mans land like place and then they start striking out from there.  Something
---
Assuming one has the appropriate rights, is it possible to extract ACLs via ESI?
---
Honestly farmville has better mechanics.
---
Yes, the black screen times are longer now than when I first started in early 2014. I can't remember what update it was (maybe in 2017?), but immediately after I noticed the black screen takes forever on first undock (especially if it's Jita).
---
The fact that you think this is something that needs saying is hilarious. 
---
this is obvious since the diamond rats were introduced. 
---
And CCP has been saying they are doing exactly that.
---
Are you really calling putting 300b isk on a gate 0 risk?
---
Keep in mind I am a horrible pilot, so I can't critique any of the game mechanics. That being said:
---
Add intros to both videos so we know who you are.
---
On this video specifically, end the audio at 2:16  or transition into an ELI5 explanation of the transversal concepts, possibly to include a geometric diagram that makes it easier for the viewer to "see" it in their spod-adled brains. After 2:16 you start rambling like you aren't sure what you are talking about.
---
If you are working from a script, read it out loud a few more times before you start. 
---
As far as content? I learned a few things that I want to test for myself now, thanks to you. Keep them coming! o7
---
The one and only issue I had with the event is... the lore items for alphas are just kinda lame. I guess it wouldnt mean much for people who just use alphas as some other sort of thing, but for people actually getting into it (i know, i know, unicorns and mythological creatures, those) would have benefited more from some more cheap hulls - maybe bundle up some of the lore items with a 'suitable' t1 hull? Either one that fit the area things were in, or just a rotation of t1 dessies or cruisers for each faction (including a 2nd sunesis, i guess.) would've worked, while not totally destroying the economy cos its not like those hulls are worth much anyway.
---
Lol Olmeca Autist Gold thinks anyone will vote for him for CSM.
---
How in hell you gonna complain about free shit???
---
Well, pretty good actually, how are you feeling buddy?
---
This is what I hoped for when they introduced sleepers and incursions. Yet to see that shit added to general PvE for how many years now?
---
Thanks for the 27 that didnt exist before but I expected 30. You literally stole 3 from me.  Your Ocasio Cortez math cracks me up.
---
I lost 1000 Pontifexes last year.
---
How many gatebosoning died since you moved to delve?
---
Risk isn't only about how much money you have on grid. If it was then 1dq keepstar would be under great risk. Risk is also about how likely you are to lose the money. If you have a 5 trillion ship on grid but 0 likelyhood of losing it, then you aren't taking any risk.
---
Then you post on Reddit for everyone to openly insult you.
---
I love it.
---
tbfh man, that's on him, not you.
---
He is the one unable to separate in game actions with the real world.
---
Did you know that you can hover over most price entry boxes to let it display as 100M instead as 100.000.000
---
I think that feature saved me some expensive mistakes
---
Gee I wonder why there's combat scanner probes out
---
Oh well, must be nothing. Back to me 10/10
---
/s
---
Anyone got pictures of the ship skins? I assume they're purple.
---
I'm not a customer of reddit users, you see. I endure insults from random people fairly well. Anyway, do you attending or what?
---
It was sounding pretty good until the monetized stargates. What? That's a huge advantage for people willing to spend money on it. Seems like a PR disaster to be "the game with real money toll roads" People might begrudgingly use toll roads in the real world because they value their time more than the toll, but it sure doesn't feel good to pay it.
---
Since when have we ever claimed to be Space ISIS?! Quite the contrary! We are trying to rid New Eden of the tyranny of the Spodbrain!
---
I don’t think I’ve tried it that way, but that makes a lot of sense.
---
Thank you for that!
---
Didn’t they hint at that with drifters too?
---
I dont know whats better the video or the people who actually click play thinking they are watching a "solo" vid.
---
You're still making more isk than VNI ratting.
---
You're salty that I'm right. I can tell.
---
Letting shit players lose things doesn't mean EVE deserves any hardcore reputation?
---
&gt; my booshing is riskier than delve mining.
---
You're attacking the home region of the most organised polity in internet spaceships, and this is somehow surprising?
---
The only reason why you and that other guy thinks it would take 100% of anybody's time to manage assets without asset safety is because you have grown used to an environment of such exceeding safety and risk aversion that you cannot possibly imagine putting anything of worth on the line for the sake of having fun. 
---
If you think that's healthy for a game which has always distinguished itself through the consequence of loss and risk vs reward then I don't need to guess that you're a moron.
---
With a DPS main character (hecate, loki, etc), and 1+ booshers, you can boosh off excavs and kill them. 
---
Probe, warp to either an excav or rorq, boosh on landing, web and kill excavs. Web them before booshing if you want to reduce the chance of them being pulled before the boosh hits. 
---
You only need one boosh alt, but depending on where you land you might be in rep range of the rorqs - more alts is more range and gives you more time to kill the excavs you do boosh before DPS drones get to you.
---
no escape from reality
---
How long has incursion rat AI been ingame ? Anomalies and DEDs haven’t been touched in forever, I’m not holding my breath that what you say is going to happen.
---
Agreed, Jamessy91. Reading the lore tidbits was fun!
---
If you want smaller fights, send me a DM. We'll help get you out there and have a small group to fly with.
---
Can't complain, thanks for taking time out of your day and asking &lt;3
---
Did they ? I thought they were using abyssal space to test graphics effects that they otherwise couldn’t do in normal space, nowhere have I seen them mention that they are using it to test AI for future iteration on common rats. Correct me if you have a source.
---
You have stated in the past that you oppose botting, yet in this interview you state that you regularly fly with members of PL, and Fraternity, two groups that are known protectors of those who bot.
---
You also count as one of your close friends who used input broadcasting in a manner that is in a gray area of the rules.
---
With that being said, how can anyone trust you to push for what is best for the game?
---
did you post it there yet?
---
You can log in through Steam actually, there's a button in the corner of the Eve login page. Guessing it will link your Steam account to Twitch instead of your Eve account, possibly resulting in a different redemption method.
---
WHAAAAA Everything that i tackle should die. Anything that contestants me is OP.
---
Prior to the killmails it was still a popular pass time, but the drones were a lot more expensive as well.
---
id love a biomass powered DD
---
Because its missiles.
---
There doesn't have to be a logical explanation in all things.
---
That's the point - he _should_ be able to. Game mechanics shouldn't allow for anyone to totally remove the ability for others to threaten them.
---
No explanation? 16 years of celebration.  Items of lore were to 'celebrate' the accomplishmentanor other lore that was notorious in the span of eve.
---
...unsure what the huge deal is. Sounds like either people just didnt understand that every year ccp do something to celebrate,  or are butthurt cause they didnt get 1mil sp. 
---
They dont owe anyone anything.
---
why dont you write up a long and in depth bug report lining out everything that is wrong w/ the game and how to fix it so devs can impliment it
---
Since when does the character Bazaar if account names? It should be giving character names.
---
You need to know player's account name, in order to transfer character to him.
---
ur an anecdote.
---
Is it already linked to a different account?  If it is, you've got your answer.  If it's not:
---
&gt; Please try again later.
---
Sounds like someone missed out on the final login prize.....
---
That has been CCP's overall vision since Seagull took in charge
---
Probably haven't changed after hers departure
---
I lost braincells
---
I'm not normally a fan of logo-and-text-overlay meme videos. But this one hits the spot.

Hi, there are several coalitions, some of them are allied and make up mega nullsec blocs that control the politics.
---
The biggest power today is megabloc of Imperium(strongesf coalition) + Legacy (2nd strongest coalition) and their assorted allies INIT, GotG coalition, and Fi.recoalition (Russians)
---
They make up around 65-75% of the nullsec (total players). Economically, they are even bigger. 
---
They are politically alligned against Panfam (NC., PL, PH) (~15-20%), Winter co (Chinese) and assorted allies.

To simplify it, Basically it's like of you go back to 1991, US+NATO+allies vs Russia just getting out of fall of USSR.
---
I'll have to try that!
---
Keep bitching like the retard you are over non existant problems :).
---
They can. The titans arnt invulnerable. We cant help it the hostiles dont have the stones to try anything but 0 risk ganks.
---
That's unfortunate. Doesn't matter if the option to use Steam is provided if the button doesn't work.
---
Almost, with Drifters they said they were testing the AI to improve PVE, we probably got Diamond Rats out of it, and then Triglavians.
---
When they introduced the Abyssal pockets they said they were testing the AI and new tactics and effects with the idea of then using them in actual space (since testing on the small pockets was easier).
---
Free stuff was great and nobody can argue with that. If you didn't manage to login for the 16-18 days that's just tough. They set the rules, you follow them.
---
That said, it was still a shit event. At no point did I feel like I was celebrating EVE or feel like I actually needed to go past the login screen.
---
People may have argued against having rewards for playing, shock horror, in the past but otherwise the whole celebration event boiled down to "login char, claim, close client". That's pretty trash tbh. Make me want to play the game, make me excited that it's lasted this long, have something to wow and engage your player-base however diverse it may be.
---
Exactly. Organization should matter. But to a limit. Game mechanics shouldn't allow making your mining income 97% safe.
---
Goonies raging hard on this thread lmao
---
The problem with your statement is it's not our fault it's not at risk, it's yours. You have failed to give us a reason to fear putting our titans on the gate to kill you and laugh at you. And before you cry ohh I'm one guy you are thousands. Get friends. Dont like us slapping our dick on the table? Do something about it. Stop crying that your 100m destroyer cant hold up against a 75b titan or super. Go back to what you know ~~input broadcasting~~ multiboxing pontifex to steal excavators. Adapt and overcome or wither away and die (in game). Your choice.

You're crazy if you think nobody should fly with any person, whose subscribed null bloc provides some level of protection to infrastructures of people who are botting. That makes up %80 of anyone in nullsec. That includes Imperium btw.
---
I'm the most anti-bot candidate because I actually have a direct and player driven solution to botting among my proposals. If you are genuinely sick of botting, you can vote for me.
---
Not that much the IA itself, but the enviormental effects, graphics and such. I don't think they are THAT far from being able to implement some of all that into missions or combat anoms.

Have you done any work with ESI before? This is like... hella beyond the scope of a simple Reddit comment if you don’t already have some experience in this area, but you can see all the endpoints at https://esi.evetech.net/ui/
---
A cursory glance says, no. I just don’t see any endpoint that has ACLs as its explicitly stated purpose. There are ways to combine data provide by the various endpoints to infer some details that are not available, of course, but I don’t have the answer for you, if that’s the case.

---
Not really. Game mechanics dictate unless you have a bigger capital force you can't kill a gatebosoning titan in Delve. Your bloc by definition has the bigger capital force.
---
&gt; Do something about it. 
---
1) I'm probably one of the people who done the most about Delve.
---
2) It's not about Delve or you. Stop taking things personally. I'm not your arch enemy like the brainwash center INN claims I am. It's about the entity with the biggest capital force having 0 risk. If it wasn't Delve, it would have been some other region.
---
How the hell did you hate an event that gave you free shit for not even going past the character selection screen? And it even gave two grace days.
---
How about one show 20 mins - summary of everyone with an endorsement for candidates.  You know better than most about the requirements.
---
You should probably read the whole thread...

Contract it to StainGuy and i will double it!

Just a heads up, we don't ACTUALLY have to use "Change My Mind" to kick off every discussion thread.
---
cat ear keepstar when
---
Read the whole thread lol.
---
Looks like I'm certainly a controversial figure with lots of haters.
---
The fact that they are in theory vulnerable doesn't mean that they are actually vulnerable. Mechanics let the entity with the biggest capital force be vulnerable. And there being no gatecamping titan kills since the Delve move-in proves that vulnerability.
---
Statistically, Delve gate bosoning is extremely risk-free. What you are saying would be analogous to arguing no one should combat hunger or homelessness, because all these people can *in theory* get homes and food. That's true, but statistically homelessness and hunger is still a huge problem. So is low risk in Delve gatebosoning.
---
The history view *can* be somewhat untrue. 
---
But not enough that this entry is totally wrong.
---
or you need to think out of the box to solve the problem "5D chess"
---
HAHAHAHA
---
ANY survey can be tailored to the response you want. A great food survey is a different story as it tells you what you don’t know.  Otherwise what is the point.

step 1: drop carrier on subcap

step 2: lose carrier to response fleet

I would burn my own undocks if I were you. If you get one from someone else, they have it too. Meaning they can be at the bookmark waiting for you.
---
Do you just use a cpu implant with this?
---
How many appempts have there been in attacking a single one of them... Zero.
---
Why should something be nerfed because the hostiles are to cowerdly to even try. 
---
O right because you dont want fights you want ganks and nothing else.
---
Giving 100m free SP to some skill farmer with 100 accounts is not a good idea, provides no content to anyone, encourages people to PLEX up to get the reward (increasing PLEX prices) and results in more skill farms afterwards.
---
It was a rubbish 'event' and I'd rather not have had the 1m SP and not had the giveaway to account farmers.
---
Does dreddit even live in C5 space? We tend to not come out to null because it's a nothing but everyone within 5 systems of us docking, Near2, and VNI bots.

Lack of lowsec gate made this happen.

Still preferred to have this gate.

&gt; Yeah, they don't tend to get much traction on Reddit

When 80% of posters are just retards who haven't played eve in 10 years, the CSM doesn't really have an impact on them.

yes let’s all shit on this so they don’t do it ever again.  Fucking morons shitting on being offered free shit. This community is literally the worst.  Literal handouts as a thank you for being amazon prime members and you people shit on this like it just spit on your mom.

---
&gt;i guess the downside would be the negative effect on manufacturers.
---
TBH most Tech I hulls are so unprofitable that I only build them if I'm building a specific doctrine for my alliance and want to save some ISK in direct cost. This is largely because every budding new industrialist builds Tech I items with ore they mine and sell them for whatever they can get because they don't yet understand opportunity cost. So the negative effect on manufacturers for handing out some basic T1 ships is honestly pretty minimal.
---
The effect becomes zero if we just include the SoCT ships (Gnosis, Sunesis, Praxis, etc.) in the alpha rewards, because manufacturers can't build them anyways.
---
It's ridiculous to solicit feedback and refuse to accept anything negative.
---
And yes it was a bad event. Events should reward people for being out in space, preferably in a risky environment, so they create content. The ones with a beacon and rats that drop Agency boosters and skins were the best, I think, but they should always have been less lucrative in HS (and not had the chain site weirdness in LS).
---
You don’t even have realistic ideas.  You just wanna see the world burn.  Which doesn’t really speak to me as someone who’ll be responsible with this position.  Even gobbins and sort are at least responsible with their suggestions.  There’s literally 20 other people ahead of you in my book.   You and PIRAT dude sit in the basement of my ballot.  Hell even that wormhole dude would be above you.
---
Yeah. The fact that alphas got lore items and not ships is honestly pretty baffling. I've been playing for years and I only know about the events behind these items because I read into the history of EVE. A random alpha who's been playing for a few months isn't going to know what the fuck a B-R5RB is.
---
People bitched because the event team got lazy (or Management Didn’t Like The Metrics). The old event sites had some strong rewards if you ran them enough, they were relatively available to run so people were in the sites, and overall they were content generators.
---
I had some great fights in NS/Wspace picking off loner cruisers trying to run the Guristas winter event sites.
---
Then they tried to “gameify” them with the whole Shadow Of Serpentis thing and it became a massive timesink with more limited rewards which people hated. Literally they had The Formula - single room sites that aren’t behind a gate with a healthy mix of “normal” sites and the occasional “rare” site, and commensurate drop tables. Then all that evolved into the rewards interface and now they’ve dropped the pretense of even having sites
---
SEETHING
---
I dont take it personally I'm just tired of people saying that their inferiority isnt their own and blaming it on capitals supers ect. Technically speaking GSF is a NBSI entity so you are our enemy. But in all seriousness I stand by my statement that we are not at risk because you (including you and all other neuts and reds) have failed to put it at risk.
---
They don't, they present a few characters from it

---
Yeah, and that will sell or dismember it if they don't see their investment being paid off.
---
Remember, Pearl Abyss bought CCP for the equivalent of *ten years* of revenue. They're obviously breathing down CCP's neck to get that investment paid off.
---
Nidhoggur &gt; Thanatos &gt; Any other garbage

Be careful when you get to the point of logging in with your eve account because I accidently hit the "back" button on my mouse and screwed up the process. As far as Twitch is concerned I claimed the reward, but I never got the goods. It's all on me for being a fat-fingered-puta-madre.
---
&gt;Do you even enjoy the game at all?
---
Yes. *This is why we complain*. We complain because we enjoy the game, and we hate to see shitty, hastily thrown together login events being used as a trick to boost concurrent player numbers. We hate the stupid ass-backwards decisions made by CCP. We hate all the unfinished content that could become something great with a little work.
---
We all love this game, and want desperately for it to succeed and become the great thing it could be. And we complain because it isn't, because this thing that we love isn't getting the love it deserves from its developers.
---
I personally like these changes. Do not let the others in the comments go HAM on you because they enjoy their comfort in nullsec. Eve for many is a constant 'easy mode' that has made many players soft in recent years. As a boardgame designer who works with inter-social mechanics and gaming it is interesting to read valuable posts like these that 1) take time to look at a perceived issue and solve it and 2) show that they really care about the world of Eve in its wonderful complexity. Below are a few noticeable parts of what you said:
---
\+When an alliance takes losses involving the largest ships in the game, it should hurt a lot. - i.e the cap changes you suggest
---
\+New Players should have a way to counter cyno's and larger entities similar to how smaller groups in real life cause empires trouble. - i.e cyno changes
---
\-Structures are a tricky one. I think the timezone tanking issue is unfortunate. I cannot write my own ideas on how to fix it shortly here but I agree they are an issue, but maybe give people a chance if they forget to refuel their structure to have a shot at defending it.
---
As to the rest of the community in this comments section, please stay civil and explain why you do not like the suggestions besides saying they are 'dumb'. It is not constructive and just shows the devs that we are easily taken advantaged of because we live in an IQ basement ;)
---
Let us keep the conversation real and have fun with it, if you pay you deserve a voice :)
---
I mean, why does a hastily thrown party even effect your playing experience? It just seems like a non issue, or at most merely a symptom of an actual issue that is what should be discussed as opposed to this.
---
It was 1 vs 267 people dude
---
So the home team used a home field advantage to kill you?  
---
I see no problem here.
---
That's not how any of this works. Pearl Abyss isn't going to be fooled by events that paper over metrics. "Manipulating key numbers communicated to investors" sounds like you think Pearl Abyss are complete fuckin morons and don't understand that event driven metrics do not by themselves indicate a sustainable player base. 
---
You guys are all acting like CCP is on life support and trying to fool everyone into believing they're healthy. There's a lot of evidence to the contrary, but the "eve is dying" sentiment is so strong it's not even worth talking about.
---
Dudes just trying to trim the threads on his spy alts and doesn't want to use unique passwords for each account :P
---
My general exploration strategy is to base out of a highsec system, find a wormhole, and just go down the chain until I find something. Sometimes I find a relic site that drops 100m and a data site that drops 20m in the first hole of the chain, sometimes I only find two relic sites that drop 10m each in the fifth hole down the chain. It's all RNG. If I find a nullsec hole I'll pop out and explore there (as long as it's not in the dronelands) but in general I find exploring in c1-3 to be more enjoyable than in nullsec. Even in alpha status, exploration in wormholes can make decent isk. An alpha with perfect alpha exploration skills can scan down every site they might want to bother exploring in null/spookyspace with regular probes.
---
As for why I find exploration in wormholes to be more enjoyable? I find that being hunted in wormhole space (uncloaked, I'm an alpha right now!) is a heck of a lot more fun than running gate to gate in nullsec.
---
But he also forgets to turn it off. Therein lies the problem with Marshy.
---
As far as botting goes, it along with RMT are my biggest issued with the game. I am in a unique position to see players doing it, and also admit they do it. Every single one is submitted to CCP. Your solutions are only things that benefit you, to give you easier kills.
---
Why is it that you advocate for more PvP and more dangerous space, but run from everyone who could pose a threat to you?
---
I don’t want to make up people’s minds for them - I feel it harms my ability to be neutral whilst covering the election. That said, trying to do a small bit of teaser content would be a great idea, and I’ll see what I can do next year!
---
&gt; How many appempts have there been in attacking a single one of them... Zero.
---
Where is your evidence for this claim?
---
What do you know about how people decide to make an attempt on a titan?
---
First the skins, then the monuments, followed by decorations.
---
Make your structure a home. Walking in stations to sell furniture soon!
---
With that logic, you could also lobby people to attempt to clear out a den of bears while only armed with a metal rod. I mean, in theory, you could pull it off, so anyone who refuses to try is a coward, right?
---
It's not cowardly to be smart enough to know an exercise in futility. Btw, there is middle ground between "0 risk ganks" and "invulnerable bosoncamps," drop the false dichotomy already. Neither of those are desirable, stop being so reductive
---
Because it would switch from being "kinda hard, have to negotiate with a ton of people" to "just set your sale settings to this". Common sense also tells me that new players will get screwed with moon materials.
---
&gt; inferiority 
---
This is typical INN propaganda Goon leaders brainwash Goon linemembers with. Imbalances in game mechanics aren't your successes.
---
They needed to stop giving out those useless trash items. They sometimes were even better for the Alphas!
---
this thread is (maybe) going places
---
&gt; You just wanna see the world burn
---
Thats like your opinion man
---
You have a valid complaint about "it doesn't require you to even play the game", but I actually found that to be nice. I was on vacation in the islands at the time, so the most I could really do was open up the game on the surface at night when we got back to the hotel...so it was nice to let me still take part in the event while not being home.
---
But by your own admission you don't engage with the game... You login once a month to update skillfarm queues... Great engagement buddy.
---
Thanks to whomever gave me Gold. Didn't expect that at all!

What is the status on FW? Is it worth doing and if so what is a good Calmil corp to join? 7o

Why aren't we giving a weapon to Keepstars, in which, if 250 people simultaneously "fire" it, it kills every non-blue ship across all systems within 10 LY distance?
---
Because there should be an upper limit to safety alliances can provide to their region even with the best of organizations and the largest of crowds.
---
I’m totally stoked they gave out the 1m SP per account, even my alpha alts got some SP, you just had to launch the the account clients and click one thing. not Eve select a toon.
---
It was clear when it started and stopped, and they gave you extra days.
---
&gt; But he also forgets to turn it off. Therein lies the problem with Marshy.

If some one attempted there would be dead dreads... there arnt next.
---
No disrespect, but everything was remarkably clear about it. I managed to get the rewards on 3 accounts while being on the islands (read: away from the internet) for 16 hours of each day during this period. One day I even just tethered my phone from the boat for 5 minutes to log in and get the rewards.
---
They were *super* clear about what was required, the timeframes for each piece, and what you'd get. Considering how many people got the rewards without issue are you *certain* it's CCP's fault?
---
They intentionally gave 18 full 24-hour days to get 16 days of rewards so that people would have a better chance of getting all of them. They could have just made it a 16 day even and said "screw em" to the people that missed any of those days. You missing out on the big reward means you missed at least 3 days of rewards, not just one.
---
Honestly, if this is the type of hissy-fit you throw for a company not giving you free stuff if they don't do it the way you want then I'm very happy you canceled your account.
---
They literally explained it fully. There's a reason an overwhelming majority of people had no issues getting all of the rewards.
---
ironic
---
Doesnt missile skills having a smaller multiplier than guns?
---
I agree that the survey is stupid...any survey should include both positive and negative options, but honestly there's no reason to even survey people. They know some people are pissed that they missed out, and they know some people are happy for getting like 1.25mil sp for free. There's not a lot of in-between.

https://zkillboard.com/region/10000060/group/485/losses/

They literally already nerfed faxes to make it so if you drop enough dreads on it you cant save it.
---
I did it for a while before but I'm guessing they changed that then.
---
I was on a business trip and then vacation in the islands and still managed to get all of the rewards on 3 accounts. They explained the event before it started so I knew "I'll have 18 days to get 16 days of rewards, and it'll take me about 30 seconds each day to log in with the 3 accounts...I'll set aside some time either in the morning or evening to make sure I get it".
---
I was literally on the islands or in a boat for 16 hours a day for a week solid and still managed to make it work. You missing it isn't their fault, it's a decision that you made.

I \*quite\* enjoyed that it didn't require me to do much to still be rewarded. I travel for a living and have spurts where I can play 3 hours in a day or times where I can play 1 hour every other week. Being able to just log in and get my rewards without having to actually do anything was huge.
---
Definitely a part of it, though there also were a lot of new players up until the peak player count with incursions or incarna, can't remember which one.

Lol the crazy idea was analogous to your "home field advantage", to show you the game shouldn't work that way. If you think the idea is crazy then good for me, because that means your justification is equally crazy.

That's how representation works. Representatives represent ideas and values. They are voted into office by people who agree with those ideas and values. They, naturally, do not represent people who disagree with or dislike those ideas and values.

&gt; You're saying you won't represent me. . .you're a goon.

This is not how representation works. Once again, representatives represent **ideas** and **values**. It is entirely possible to represent some of one person's interests while not representing some of their other interests.

please Bob , no. don't do it

&gt; 30000 man alliances should require a &gt;30000 man eviction force
---
None of this is about evictions and safety of structures. Its about safety of ships. If your alliance is immune to risk because it's the most crowded, then it's a bad mechanic. Nullsec should be risky. Period.
---
Well... I think it was better than the current renting system.
---
Trying to go for relic sites in wormholes is generally not the best idea, as only some pirate factions have good loot. Use wormholes to get to nullsec and explore there. The two best pirate factions to run relic sites are Sansha and Gurista.

The sickening part about all of this, no matter our feedback here, you can guarantee at an exec meeting, someone is going to get a pat on the back for manipulating a survey to produce nothing but positive reinforcement.

It literally was your fault if you missed it. You might have had other stuff going, but it's not like it takes an hour a day...that was the entire point of just making it "log in and get the rewards" reward. I did it from a laptop while in bed at night for a week and a half of the time (on a business trip and then on vacation). I was in a beach house with 10 other people and still found the 30 seconds it took to get my rewards.

If you missed the event, it wasn't CCP'd fault.

I'm ashamed you didn't even give us an honorable mention for dunking you twice in NOL-M9 with your cheetah alt, and your 20+ NPC fleet on grid assisting you.

I thought for sure it was a GF for 2 of us vs 22 of you.  How come you didn't add more of the fighting in the video where you die, or show how you set up the bait with your alt, and when you die, you scoop ESS with alt before anyone can attack it.

No, the early events were actually well received until CCP started releasing dogshit events that look like they were designed by a 5 year old, were broken for days after release, and had terrible rewards for the time spent, and were a platform for lootboxes.

Fleets to not allow players to share aggression timers or limited engagements. If you shoot someone flashy only they can shoot you back, not everyone in there fleet. Fleets also don't make fleet members valid targets, so while if you are in a fleet the FC can warp to you and make you warp, no one in that fleet can shoot you if they don't have a engagement timer from another source. IF someone shoots you, then unless it is part of a duel then it is likely because you are suspect. This means anyone can shoot you without CONCORD intervention.

"We’re super happy to announce that from May 2nd through to May 20th, all pilots can join in the festivities and celebrate EVE Online’s sixteenth birthday"    
---
I logged in on May 20, 16:00 Eve time and no reward.
---
All my subscriptions, phone, netflix, etc include the last day.
---
Legacy and Winter Co have their own conflict in the south, no other Bloc exists that could have an effect on the outcome. I don't think you understand just how large a proportion of null players have been hoovered up by the blocs
---
Slated for 2038
---
Or basic language skills. As you said yourself, we have more capitals therefore inferior would be a way to describe your capital force. You're pontifex that die are inferior to the titan that killed them.
---
Hahaha, we've been hearing this about new ai since burner missions got added. Guess how much of the old ai has actually been replaced. Hint: rats in non-burner missions, anomalies, belts(aside from the diamond rats) and, hell, even sleepers still use fossilized ai with minor tweaks.
---
That said, new AI for EVERY LAST NPC would be sweet. One can dream...
---
Noticed you couldn't skip ranking the stuff they gave out that went immediately to a junk folder. The only thing I logged in for was the SP, not the t-shirts or face deals.
---
Oh great now I can't decide whether to vote for olmeca or matterall
---
Nothing wrong with a snack between meals.
---
Do you not know the fucking rules, man? We do not say nice things about the game here.
---
I had olmeca pegged as an attention seeking ass. Im not sure if im wrong or not but I cant really say that i disagree with much of what he said in the interview. I think he could add some much needed balance to the CSM. Video is well worth listening to. Good luck dude.
---
Feedback: daily login too much effort.  Instead, send email out to players with a survey: "Do you want free SP, pick one \[Yes\]\[No\]"
---
Then, regardless of selection, give them free SP.  Repeat quarterly.
---
The thing with toll roads is that when you pay the toll, you're paying for the maintenance aswell but can you really justify a toll on an eternal metal hoop and empty space?
---
Thank You!
---
my only complain is it doesnt have a cosmos section. but then again, even most of ccp doesnt know much about it either.
---
It is risky.  Period.  The most expensive ships in the game are undocked every minute into the same playing surface. 
---
What makes it safe is the one thing that eve is celebrated for:  the strong community of players gathered together under a common banner of cooperation.  These huge teams require hundreds of hours inside and outside of the game client just to function.  Strong leaders emerge and visions are laid out.  These hundreds of hours building these communities would be wiped out of what you propose comes to fruition.  All because you have a rage boner against “what null sec has become”.  You’re completely irrational.  You would operate on the CSM in a me first mentality and not in an Eve first mentality.  
---
Not that the CSM is the end all be all of game developers but merely providing you with any sort of relevance like this would be damaging.
---
You and the other guy have "a few trillion in ISK/goods scattered all over the galaxy" because you've enjoyed such risk free safety for so long.
---
If the system was different then you wouldn't have been so lazy leaving your shit everywhere with no way to easily move these assets.
---
You are a symptom of safety. You want to have everything at your disposal without any consequence to your actions. Why are we catering to the casual in what should be a hardcore game?
---
&gt;there is a large portion of the population that would essentially be excluded from most of the game
---
Excluded? No. Have to play with some risk, yes.
---
Have you ever heard the phrase "don't put all your eggs in one basket" ?
---
I was out of town a few days with work and shit and couldn't log in. The last 4 days i logged in knowing that I'll make it but surprise, the event ended at downtime.
---
Caps are too oppressive in lowsec.  Let the cap blobs pounce on lone frigates in null if they must, but there needs to be a realm where   
---
 gangs of people in subcaps can go for each others throats without having to worry about some assholes dropping 15 supers on them.  A realm like *lowsec*, for instance.  (No, Wormholers, most of us dont want to live with you.)
---
The thing is, lowsec space is just that, low security space.  It is not NO security space.  Empires still have a presence there and should, from a lore perspective at the very least, have an interest in preventing capsuleers from operating capital ships in their sovereign space.
---
There are a number of ways to combat cap proliferation in lowsec.  The harshest and most disruptive is to flat out say "no, you cant bring that ship in here".  No cynos in lowsec, etc.  Obviously, everyone is going to cry about this one.
---
A lesser way to combat cap proliferation in lowsec, and the one i am partial too, is to involve the npc navies in a way that is similar to what happens when FW pilots enter an opposing faction's space.  For example, if a capsuleer dread gang enters a 0.4 system, let hostile faction npcs spawn to challenge them.  And, like with faction navy npcs in highsec, the spawn would quickly escalate in number and lethality until it became too much for even a titan to oppose.  So a cap gang could spend a little bit of time in system, say for traveling, or logistics, but in any sort of pvp situation, they would have to contend with increasingly dangerous npc as well as enemy players.  But those npcs would have to be dangerous enough to matter.  As such, CCP would need to introduce empire navy capital ship and HIC npcs.  Cap pilots would LOVE hostile HIC npcs.
---
you’re a lesbian gay bisexual trans woman?
---
I'm glad the anomaly thing isn't as much as a concern as it looked like at first, much better at telling people what out there, shows stuff like escalations in a MUCH better format, good job CCP.
---
It's not just logging in, it's logging in specific amount of days in specific period.
---
I don't really care about rewards, that's nonsense. 1m is like two weeks of training, it's not that much to trigger me by itself.
---
What bothers me is that CCP sees it as a proper incentive for me to log in 16 days out of 19 at specific span of days. That's just ridiculous. Just daily rewards is a shitty mechanic, but 16 days long campaign with huge payout at the end it's something that even Hitler would be proud of. Nobody deserve such a treatment. Especially players who payed for subscription, because daily rewards is considered normal in purely f2p games, BUT considering eve has huge paying playerbase - it's just ridiculous. And that's a sole reason I've mention paying subscription.
---
CCP sure is magic'ing a lot of SP into the game lately.  I thought this was one of the conditions of injectors, that someone had to actually farm said SP, instead of CCP just creating them out of thin air.
---
They are also horribly broken. Probably trying to sweep that one under the rug
---
Which corp, out of curiosity?
---
You can link a CCP ID to steam accounts now, and then you should be able to use that.  This makes a steam account behave the same as a non-steam account I believe.
---
Can still be in a staiton with an agent that but it doesn't show up in the agency window. After 3-4 times I quite petitioning them about it. See it's still going on.
---
Agreed. Salty vets love to complain, i know, but if i was a new player myself i know i would've 100% loved the agency. Gives you a perfect overview of what you can do in-game, actually shown IN-GAME, not on Uni wiki or whatever.
---
What you have said is completely true.
---
You are scared until you understand it. 
---
Vets aren't scared anymore because we understand nearly everything we interact with.
---
When you understand the game it becomes very clear there's actually very little that can't be avoided or outplayed.
---
same goes for loging in every day
---
Oh right, um, this doesn't buff my rorq agency is shit ccpls delet stain

---
people who are unhappy with plex prices can choose to pay with cash, PLEX is a convenience for the rich, not a granted thing for everyone.
---
It's better than the old one, but STILL doesn't have feature parity to the shit it replaced.
---
please accept my condolences
---
Doesn't change the fact that it's a balance issue.
---
I remember roaming out in nullsec somewhere, warped to a random belt looking for a vni and found a lvl 5 agent for interbus just floating there. Didnt have the standings. Someday I mean to find him again and find out what mission he offers.
---
dont they know it was never fun, they just werent bitter vets back in the day
---
I really hate that sigs are shown outside your current system, and I really hope they change that. (I guess they don't want to remove sigs entirely as it messes up their 4-things-on-each-page layout, but they could remove the system search capability on the sig page, and just replace the left hand side with information about, and a video tutorial for, scanning.)
---
But otherwise it is a really nice redesign.
---
Do you want someone on the CSM who's going to advocate for gold ammo?

Nurse: When was your last tetanus booster shot?

Me: I don't remember.

Nurse: Wrong answer! *stab*
---
We do undock.  In NPC Delve.
---
indeed
---
But vets are the ones screaming daily for change. Vets understand the game and understand how it needs to be changed for the health of the game.
---
Then we get devs who have been at CCP less time than most vets n'th alt has been alive and have never played the game "in the wild" thus lacking a player perspective.
---
Then we get shitty changes that aren't wanted and you wonder why change suddenly looks bad??
---
Thanks for being open minded!
---
its not even daily, you had 2 extra to fuck up
---
ye my bad , we're in agreement.
---
Found the CCP dev. 
---
Why not include un-anchoring of all POS and structures in the area of effect?
---
Looool, not surprising after all. From Jesse's perspective, He is right, and everybody else that doesnt agree is wrong !
---
Because I’m no CCP dev, and surprisingly, even CCP aren’t that crazy.
---
The purpose was to reward logging in and participation in the game, in a safe way. Previous events had actual activities until we bitched them to death with shitty posts like this angry OP.
---
So when you spread your assets around an entire region, then you go AFK for two weeks and come home to a region with every structure burned to the ground kind of like what we're doing to Panfam right now, then what? Again, suck it up and fuck you for having real world obligations?
---
No ones gonna undock anything expensive they know they have even a &gt;25% of losing.   The only reason you see whaling fleets and shit killed at all is because people thinks it’s pretty safe to fly today.  Why would you?  Why would you even move out to null if the cost/benefit wasn’t appealing?  The game would never move to fleets of supers forming huge monumental battles.  Would be Subcaps all day everyday. 
---
The game you think you want isn’t really the game you want.  
---
You just need to get gud and be able to overcome the player created defense systems.
---
Yikes, being asked to log in really is as offensive as being asked to eat shit to you.
---
oh those are the facts.
---
But this isnt about facts guy, this is how *I* feel.  I feel like it was not great. end of story.
---
He's got my votes.
---
log out of the game and log back in and double check. I had an issue where it gave me a bad gateway error that I had to go back and attempt to redeem again and I got my items.
---
Where is this? I'll pay x1000 that.
---
Looks like Satan the Dark Lord really changed this persons life! He works for me he works for you!
---
As someone who started playing Eve a few days before the event the million SP was a fucking godsend.
---
We haven't all got 15 years worth of SP and we aren't all so fucking bitter and entitled to complain about free stuff. I'm guessing that if you can't be bothered to login you probably don't need the SP anyways.
---
Yes
---
u r dumb hope this helps your day go smoother.
---
Maybe something changed in the last 3 days since im in Amsterdam.. But last week the revenant was a super and not a titan x)
---
wow how generous!
---
I hope he gets on.  I wouldn’t envy him being locked in a room with Aryth for a week 😂
---
Your book sounds like its written by an idiot
---
chaos keepstar pls
---
Nah, that's just extreme example.
---
I'm confident in r/eve's ability cto push this through if there was some kind of vote.
---
I hate that I can't resize the window
---
&gt;let alone the nearby people that will come and kill your rorqs 
---
Doesn't this count as content?
---
To execute a proper Fabian strategy you should be making hit and run attacks that cause some damage.  
---
Granted SH1 but for us that was fun to finally shoot at you 😂
---
you're going to get a lot of hyperbolic answers by people pushing agendas
---
the real truth is that people have gotten better at organization, gotten overall more wealthy and combat-capableover time (which is entirely natural), so the old methods of finding engagements are less likely to work. Wandering around the woods with a spear looking for another dude with a spear to fight might work in caveman times, but you would be very unlikely to find a fight you like nowadays, right
---
So, as you saw in the video, more elaborate methods have to be used to do things against increasingly well defended infrastructure. That's partially due to mechanical changes, but it's not like ccp is hard burning for a pacifism future, it's just due to natural development and improvement of methods and equipment.
---
You are still punished for being stupid. If you are asleep and your rorq is eating a rock and a wormhole opens and you get tackled you will die. If you wake up to the hull alarm, you can push the Panic button and get on comms and hope they don't let you did for being asleep. You might get saved.
---
Here's the part where I push my agenda: if you like old Eve, go to wormhole space, join a wormhole corp, and live there. Wormholes are where the danger and adrenaline and fun is
---
/r/evejobs
---
&gt; Or basic language skills.  
---
&gt; You're pontifex that die are inferior to the titan that killed them.
---
smh
---
In short, yes.
---
You chose to spread your assets around the region. You chose to take the risk of trusting those assets to be there when you come back. You chose risk.
---
I repeatedly take that risk. I live in a WH, I haved stored 50b+ in nearly undefended astras. I go on holiday frequently and barely login otherwise. Could all my shit get blown up without me being able to do anything? Yep, and I know I am taking that risk.
---
look at me look at me
---
What we are currently doing in Delve might fall under that, but otherwise it was more of a play on the meme that you guys tried it, and failed and now it's our turn lol
---
Yes, that's pretty much what I feel has happened the last years.
---
Eve is still definitely dangerous as an explorer I think what the whaler video was mostly going on about is how I could whip out my Thany to rat in null and never be that afraid because if someone shows up I light a Cyno and 20 supers come to kill this lone pilot looking for kills. So the Danger has not changed for the little guys but for alliance members the risks have been diminished.
---
Meh your killing worthless crabs in Delve.  If anything your doing us a favour.
---
&gt;Sure Goons could rock up and and take any moon in the game they want, but do they really want to send a fleet to the other side of the map every 3 or 4 days to defend it?
---
But isn't this literally the gameplay you're arguing that the game is crying out for a return of?

There's still plenty danger there.  Wh are dangerous like shit. Nullsec ... Can be safe and can be not, depend on who are your friends. Lowsec is kinda dangerous , yes believe me. BUT hisec is less dangerous as intended to be. And some people just can't leave with that. Don't believe on that folks alarming that the game will end . Also hisec is NOT safe , don't believe me? I dare you to fly amarr--jita route with a billion worth cargo in your hold and a shitty fit.
---
So abuseable.
---
My alt would jettison hundreds of t1 frigates for me to explode for killmarks.
---
Take out a dev fleet each day and roam around until all dead, like they used to.
---
Says the second most irrelevant person in this thread after Olmeca.
---
So basically I should not worry. Thanks!
---
Who said anything about Eve time? It started in their local time, not UTC. That's, again, not CCP's fault. They could have added the times to the banner, but it was in the rules.
---
Because it started at downtime 18 days prior.
---
Why on earth would you vote Materall?
---
HML orthrus should dunk on lv3s,  does about the same damage as a drake with max alpha skills, and is faster.  Will likely have less tank but once you know what you are doing that shouldn't be much of a problem. 
---
for content above level 3s probably not the best choice though.
---
I unsubbed all my accounts because of this
---
It would've been nice if by 1 day remaining it meant a day, not four hours. I was travelling for work for 15 of those days.
---
What I like the most is that it opens instantly now. Idk if it's because of my computer but the old agency took like 3 sec to open while freezing my client in the meanwhile. Thank you CCP.
---
with my nationality i can't get a prime account, kind of bums me out.
---
The picard manoeuvre is like the freedom city shuffle except bruce willis doesn't break their necks
---
All is good in land of rising sun! You got negativity? Take negativity somewhere else! We happy here now! By order of law!
---
Wormhole Space,
---
The only REAL part of EvE left.
---
No. People are too afraid of losing their shit.  hunters and droppers are incredibly good at killing things nowadays.  so you either live under a super umbrella or you die a lot.  
---
If anything eve is more dangerous in most of the regions.
---
Gas, Glass or Ass war, nobody bots for free
---
I'm too stupid to work out how to link accounts. rip
---
as a filthy crab i was like "grrrrr olmeca"   
---
now im like "yep.. voting olmeca"
---
Some would say null sec is far more safe than high sec. You typically have alliance support and allies... 24/7 comms... support fleets almost always roaming... and intel channels. You can nestle yourself in a tiny corner and mine/rat/whatever until your heart's desire.
---
Not on tests ballot , actually vily is pretty anti you.
---
That doesn't drive up engagement levels in the game though
---
Can't apply that logic to NC space...
---
The new clicker pointer feature is amazing imo for teaching people
---
While Matterall is a nice guy and a nice talkshow host he will not make a good csm.
---
Following his podcast he has no clear vision on anything he wants, and rolls with the waves of whatever is thrown at him regarding questions asked. Even finds removing the bumping mechanic to be a good idea for example. 
---
It's really a dead vote.
---
They should remove the black screen entirely. Never was a fan of it, always annoyed me.
---
I know. I'm not surprised. I've been pretty anti-empire-builder myself.
---
Funny how some TEST dudes openly pledge their votes for me.
---
Good vid, doesnt need to be much longer.
---
Did you tested that out? I found that sigs thing VERY unreliable.
---
WTB, some phat standings!
---
The Agency interface, thought not perfect, is a wonderful and needed addition to the NPE.
---
I’m using it myself for goal setting and exploration.
---
Ok but what does this say in braille
---
The thing that keeps me training missiles as a new player, even though it feels bad having to train so many systems, is that I'm also moving towards stealth bombers at the same time which is a big goal of mine. Just my 2c as a newb.
---
You guys rolled over faster than France in WW2. 
---
I'm forced to get my content from Banderlogs Alliance. Who actually have the balls to take kitchen sink gangs right up to KQK.
---
Well played Banderlogs, you're the true winners of this war.
---
I felt the same way. I have a 6 month old baby and my time to game is rather limited now. Getting an increasingly better reward every time I logged in, and not needing to compete for loot at event sites was nice.
---
He only gets 2.50 of it

Space isn't less dangerous. If you got that from his video it did its job well feeding you a bunch of bullshit. The fact is people are more organized, more developed, and more supportive of PvE activities. That's it. Players make it safe. Eve has always been about player agency to organize and operate as they see fit within the boundaries.
---
You can argue about rorquals being too hard to break, that they mine gamebreaking amounts of ore, combat anoms are too easy/lucrative... all that is fine and debatable. It's definitely not safe out there though.
---
It started at downtime and ended at downtime.  
---
Their local time is EVE time.
---
You can do that?
---
I think lore is stating that the Triglavians are targeting Sansha. So I would guess that the incursions are going to be done seeing as Sansha has a new enemy.
---
It may have been patched at some point. In that case just have my alt undock in unfit frigates
---
imagine being this terminally retarded
---
Why didn't they list this in the patch notes.  I really hope that's not true.
---
Sunesis bundle. LOL gag me. You'd have to pay ME $15 just to bother acquiring this crap. Almost as tempting as a 10%-off PLEX sale. LOL YEah, that $1.50 was what was keeping me from buying.. HAHAHA!!
---
This guy knows the rules of the club.
---
You bastard OP, I just ordered a  LC49RG90 off of Amazon and your post gave me the itch to do so. One question, does the screen have a matte or glossy finish? I started looking at the Acer X35 too, but a) it is not here yet, b) will be twice as expensive and c) is not a 5120 screen......
---
Eh, my Hel only has T2 adaptives atm, they are so cheap now that I question if its even worth putting A-Types on.
---
As someone who hasn't really used it much, what features is it missing at the moment (and what exactly did it replace?).
---
Probably /u/stainguy shenanigans.
---
I play for 6 years and didn't know that. These little details are making your customers mad.  
---
Like we have a Eve time, use the damn Eve time not the downtime.
---
People would be complaining even more if they did that even though it is a much more common type of reward system in MMO's.
---
If it's not in the patch notes it's probably a bug.
---
And here I was getting downvoted to hell when I made a nice comment about the agency when it was on sisi.
---
Upvoted. You had me at "Iapetus Titan."
---

---
I think you're being too kind to him. Thick as shit would be more accurate.
---
Just dont do this in provi, it fucks with our farming.
---
Undocking takes 20-30 seconds for me wtf.
---
He went streit for the trap
---
Rolled over? Geminate has never been so quiet as it is now. This retarded structure bashing killed all content in the rest of the north. You could probably autopilot  a freighter from our staging in tribute all the way to the spire and be just fine. Was much more fun before this war for both sides tbh.
---
Used to have twitch prime myself. But canceled the subscription when they removed the feature where you would not see commercials on channels.
---
It was because of the map no one asked for
---
if they remove incursions, they are dumping quite a few assets in the game.....not sure if that would be good overall....but if the trig invasions does "scale down" the ammount and frequency of sansha incursions ...it might have an interesting effect, making LP farming from incursions and BPCs for sansha items a bit more valuable.
---
this
---
Was aligning to the cyno off grid
---
I have an SSD and it still takes me 10 seconds of black screen to fully load grid.
---
If you leave the major jita area it becomes much better. This is because it doesn't live update.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77056098/ 
---
case in point.
---
Cosmos agents, circle agents, datacenters.....all relics of the past....but still there.
---
Personally i wish they convert all of those to the EPIC ARCs framework...it would be much better and suitable for newer players to find and use aproppiately.
---
I bio massed everything fuck this game
---
Guess I should save my remaining LP for the inevitable spike in CONCORD capital mods.
---
no no no, eve is mining in a venture for a week or two then quitting the game for like 5 months then doing it again
---
Did some retarded goon actually waste silver om this to make is seem like a less rerarded comment?
---
Well its missing an in game browser
---
Exist - yes, but ccp decided that you use missiles and drones for ratting.
---
Hes pretty well liked by the community yes, maybe if you got out of the retarded narrative driven goon forums sometimes
---
CFC
---
That's unfortunate, going toe to toe seems much more fun, thanks!
---
Why the f is it called "The Agency"? Wouldn't... for instance... neocom be a better name for it?
---
I'm a wormholer btw so no, I haven't really made much use of it.
---
As opposed to the retarded narrative driven Reddit? 😂
---
Hell yeah it is.
---
So if a fleet is coming to your system in you weakest TZ you would let super and rorqual farming seems smart indeed.
---
Your trap with BB, PL, PH was well set, too many people on your side and not enough on our for an unplanned fleet during a week if I'm not wrong.
---
Oh don't play the surprised one for the tz tanking every alliance does it in a good tz for them, that a bad game mechanic yes but you also set your structure to ustz so you coward tank too , don't forget that
---
You really shouldn't take flair on Reddit as the gospel my dude.
---
At least here you have more than one retarded narrative
---
This is true. It gets hard to even kite some of the faster AB ships, because you are confined to the sphere, making it so the chasing ship can cut corners and has to travel less distance to cut you off.
---
Both? Neither? Either way it happened and it's what EVE unique.
---
Once you are a couple of systems out it doesn’t give full detail at least, just the number of combat sigs.
---
Dozens and dozens of rorquals die daily. Hundreds of capitals per week. Thousands of sub capitals. I wouldn't say it's safe.
---
Maybe, but the leshak does way more damage, you've got bonuses on your neuts, you've got range control once they hit bastion, you got enough mids and PG for batteries as well as so many low slots to stack relays with that you shouldn't even need boosters. Not saying that they can't win, but I wouldn't feel good about taking that fight like that.
---
Never vote for someone as slimey as materall. But he knows mittini btw
---

I think he was being sarcastic :)

The amount of dps that lands on field these days when hunting, a carrier lasts all of 30 or 45 seconds which is usually a death sentence even if they are in a standing channel.
---
If you read the summit mins you would be able to make a determination as to how good a CSM member I was. I think the common thread here is your unwillingness or inability to READ.
---
This is the marketplace of retarded narratives. Let the most retarded narrative prevail!
---
You might be able to make decent ish ISK ratting in a Ferox of maybe a Rokh, but the ships you're ratting in are the flavour of the month tbh.
---
You wouldn't do this in AUTZ!
---
Because of how unclear the duration of the event was presented i missed the last big 1mio sp boost. I subscribed just for that event and main for the SP on the last day. I had no way of expressing that in the survey.
---
I undock from highsec hubs so rarely, he/she can feel free to camp that bookmark for awhile waiting for me.
---
Wow this is really entertaining. Is the non EVE stuff animated by the creator? Or is that made inside another game? Looks like it took a lot of work either way
---
You're actually so confused about how any of this game works. Please try your hand at becoming a content creator and you will suddenly clearly see the glaring problems with everything you are saying.
---
What kind of sites? What skills do you have? A plain ol dual rep vexor ratting fit should get you through at least a 4/10 DED.
---
That's cool cunt, don't give a fuck tho. Nobody gives a fuck about your experience or specific situation so fuck off mate. I hope to god I don't know you irl, because you sound like a little bitch that likes to lick the boots of CCP over a shitty event with a shitty set up. Your opinions are shit.
---
Anyways, hope you have a good day bud, keep on truckin and all that.
---
Hi, Archarial!
---
I thought I'd stop by to offer you a robot hug, and to wish you a wonderful day!

---
I LOVE the Celestis, especially for small gang :)
---
like most corps, doctrine ships are encouraged, but 90% of our fleets are ewar/newbro friendly,  it's only interceptor and bomber fleets that aren't really.
---
You know, I really do.
---
Essentially it's Source SDK with bluescreens of EVE stuff
---
Remove lances. Implement it as a corpse power superweapon on the Molok. Game instantly a bit more balanced.
---
I wish I could upvote this twice! I said so on the tweetfleet slack, and will it here as well : what a fucking tragedy. I was away the first week (no power, no internet, mountains), and didn't even know about the event until it was too late to get the 1M SP. Who cares about the other worthess space junk? The SP and the standings boosters were the only price you want here and unless you logged in for all the days you got nothing. I got back from my phone trip and had 15 days left of the "challenge". Guess thanks a lot for the  14 fucking years of playing the game. I logged in a few times to get that standings booster and didn't play at all that month out of spite that month because CCP fucking sucks and I'm tired of this. I quit in 2014 but recently got back into things over christmas. They haven't changed and I'm probably not resubscribing. Eve is fun when you play with friends, but if you are not, who the fuck cares about the actual game? It's what we make it, despite CCPs best effort to turn it into care bear safe haven mobile zoo.
---
Olmeca for CSM! But doubt that will help at all. Come join Bombers bar fleets if you are sick of people hugging it out like the big nap.
---
Im a steam user. Had no problem.
---
I'd never done COSMOS before and I felt like giving it a shot. Tried talking to a COSMOS agent with no mission prerequisites the other day, had more than high enough standings. She refused to talk to me :'(
---
It happens from time to time as a known issue. Wait for DT. Then restart the timer
---
So you gonna keep going with the argument that i cant or wont read? Nice evading. Time to move on i guess. Fly safe.
---
The animation involving the people is done using Garry's Mod using characters from Half Life 2
---
Wasn’t that removed for unrelated reasons to do with the IWI thing?
---
Don't confuse him with logic.
---
&gt; he logs in hundreds of campers every day
---
There's something wrong with his brain, which kind-of explains why you're friends with him.
---
It looks like you're not very good at Eve.
---
I’m going to send them my feedback but in an exciting new way! 
---
I’ll send one word of my feedback each time that they message me over the course of 20 days! I will only send them one word per day though so if they forget to message me because they have real life obligations outside of work, then too fucking bad!
---
Oh yea, the only interesting words will be on the last couple of days, so I really hope CCP is committed to making this a priority or they’re going to miss out. I believe this will give CCP a sense of pride and accomplishment, and with a little luck maybe a few retired devs will log back in to their reddit accounts again and start posting regularly! But really I just want to give feedback to the devs who obsessively post every single day, because fuck the casuals.
---
Goonsworm
---
You and Olmeca are the clowns here, and Jintaan for licking his butt.
---
We had the ones with sites, which were cool. Killed stuff, got some ok loot, some boosters which were easy to get/sell and some skins
---
Then they made a ***mining*** event. That was not well received. Not surprised.
---
Or you could read the thread...
---
Or perhaps it's because for those of us who aren't amazon prime members, this is a bid asking us to fork over cash. And when you get this all the time for close to a dozen different games, it gets frustrating. 
---
But sure, get mad at me for disliking this "free" additional DLC to my games.
---
Ok so you're dumb, that's cool
---
Thank you.  Cant believe people still take me seriously.  Trolling is a form of art
---
Look around you.  The mines are bursting.  Help yourself, I know I am lol
---
How would you compare the industry of this to say your average null sec?  I honestly don’t know.  But I suspect null industry is higher.  Also doesn’t Anoikis have one dominant owner?  Again I actually don’t know
---
Well from NCPL perspective it's probably the "Zero fucks given" war.
---
But you didn't actually have to play the game. I didn't actually lod into station or space once because it was all done from the login screen
---
Yea, I have been on the receiving end of a Garmur in a Algos, my drones couldn’t catch it, it was outside the range of the 75mm rails, so I just had to sit there as it blew me up.
---
You’d have to subtract tax, however
---
Why work for someone else's salt mine when you can open your own?  I fucking love /r/eve because the incels are so easy to upset.  More fun than actual eve.
---
Hopefully, we will always have the bloodraider event!! They should run it more than once a year, I think.
---
You're probably one of the few people who seem to get that the issue wasnt missing out on free SP, so much as the handling of mass petitions that can be seen as evidence of a poorly executed marketing campaign.  Kudos
---
The tank rolling takes like 10 minutes with tidi, but still accurate.
---
I probably inherited more money than you'll make in a lifetime.
---
Someone who is really bad, but also somewhat rich, and likes finding new ways to lose supers. And he really hates Brave because they kicked him for being an asshole.
---
I genuinely dont understand your post, but it screams incel.
---
Use livestreamer. No ads.
---
If the dates were clear, there would have been no need for the GM to respond to the mass amount of petitions via a mass reply.  Was I stupid, sure.  Was I as stupid as someone who created a marketing campaign with potential to disappoint paying subscribers?  Nope, not that dumb.
---
Sounds like it...
---
ur gay pwnd
---
The biggest issue with using gun boats for ratting is that rats are weakest to one damage type, and with drones or missiles you can pick that exact damage type and do 100% damage into the hole, while all guns do damage in at least 2 types (lasers do EM and Therm, hybrid do Kin and Therm, projectiles do a variety depending on what ammo you select).
---
Gurista rats are weakest to Kinetic damage, with their second lowest resist being thermal, so Gallente or Caldari gunboats will both do quite good damage to them. It depends on what sites you are running (HS missions, 0.0 anoms, LS belts?), if you are running lower level 0.0 anoms a Ferox should work reasonably well. I would use railguns and sit at range, make sure to bring a flight of light drones to kill the frigate rats that get under your guns. If you're looking for more excitement you could also try a MJD Naga. More damage and range, but much less tank.
---
I miss the TEST local spam wiki page. I feel like that could be worth making public.
---
That’s a weird fit though.. double cap battery takes too long to neut out with even a 5 medium neut curse
---
If I didnt risk the angry wrath of the incels taking out their hate for me on old alliance members who really have absolutely nothing to do with me I would, just because you said please and thank you.  
---
Just to be clear, that was no sarcasm.
---
Actually not Goons. Haven't taken that plunge yet.
---
Do you have any links for mission ship fits?
---
You're assuming all people actually check that crap.
---
&gt; until we bitched them to death with shitty posts like this angry OP
---
"ARE YOU TELLING ME I NEED TO KILL A RAT?!"
---
I think of all the responses, yours made me smile the most.  The only thing more pathetic than some dude complaining about not getting free shit from a video game on reddit, is getting mad enough to waste their time posting comments.   I actually got over the SP pretty quick, but the way reddit reacts to disappointment over the event is more entertaining than EVE itself.
---
got eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem
---
True but most people are whinging because they didn't get their dam 1mil SP

You busy?  A/S/L???

Very dumb question my friend had: Does anyone have a good idea of how much time is required in EVE to start an endless cycle of F2P?
---
Tbh it's nice and simple but I do think its lost that go actually do the exploration and find stuff yourself but instead here you go we will just tell you where everything is and spoil the fun..
---
I wanna believe that theres some "text to ascii art" tool you used for that, but at the same time this is r/eve so I wouldn't be surprised if you did the formatting by hand
---
No, you are simply seeing a matured MMO. The access to guides and basic survival skills are easier than ever. Even then there is plenty of death and destruction. People still do super retarded stuff everyday, but you also have a population that by and large is more knowledgeable about basic skills in avoiding unwanted destruction than ever before.
---
IMHO anyway.
---
I use a spreadsheet I make myself. It automatically updates ore values when I refresh, and even tells me if it's more profitable to sell the ore or refine and sell the minerals.
---
My thing was, we are already subbed it should just let us pick up the rewards. More people would sub for that .
---
In game events are kinda fun... Sometimes. But if you miss 2 days and alot of people who play the game don't log in everyday.
---
Soundpacks in a game without sound?
---
Just like someone with 'The Initiative' tag, you can't stop think about your daddy?
---
The huge towers are actually cat ears
---
If the wording on the dates was so clear then why did GM Archduke send out a mass reply to the petitions?
---
And yet people would still rather read both of our posts over yours, how weird right?
---
NGL most religious books can actually be pretty good reads if you are into learning about the culture and history of different cultures.
---
Because a lot of people can't read and he didn't want to reply to everyone individually, so he sent a mass mailing.

There are a *lot* more people that had no trouble reading and understand dates.
---
You don't even need a dual rep.
---
Tier 1 or T2?

I fear no god but mittens

lol exactly the reply I'd expect. Hope 10th grade isn't too hard for you in the coming year...they tend to be a lot bigger than 9th graders.
---
I never finished the last episode. My friends never caught it.
---
half and half.  i did actually miss the million sp.  my account is no longer active.  truth is though the game sucks balls and is boring as fuck, so i use the SP as an excuse to hate the game and troll incels on /r/eve
---
IT'S HOT DROP O'CLOCK!
---
and yet it happened.  great marketing campaign!!!!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aewmdv/infographics_for_all_turret_ammo_types/

I completely agree. I just re-watched them all last month. Remember when we all got that excited from seeing a Titan?
---
slowly reread everything you just typed again and again until things start to click
---
Survey wasn't to gather information. it was to make you feel like your thoughts counted for something. Possibly straight into the recycle bin.
---
oWo
---
I trainedup for that...then they changed to torps.
---
2mil SP... It won't hurt, and also allows the player to successfully rat, earn isk, and train skills that will allow them to follow their dreams while they enjoy the game. If someone would've turned me onto the dual rep meta when I had 2mil SP, it would've saved me a whole lot of time. Training the "right" skills instead of training into ships just to have half ass skills in them. Just my opinion.
---
True, and I do run a dual rep myself, but it's not technically necessary for most 4/10s. Though depends on the fit as well I guess.

The difference is that in the US we would have thrown down and in fact tried to several times; we have next to zero players in EU or AU tz, whereas your **COALITION** couldn't shake enough cretins out of the trees to outnumber us 2:1 so you bagged and ran.

I've done both T1 Vexor and full T2 VNI and Stratios runs through Serpentis 4/10s clearing most if not all the rats. Single Rep Vexor runs can be a bit tense but are entirely doable.
---
Yes, the problem is your full corp is now in rorqs so not much you can do with the "content", keep in mind for small groups ping up like 100 dudes isn't gonna happen you might ping out 40 if your lucky so most likely you end up just losing the rorq.
---
*changes skillbooks*
---
  **No one can train skills**
---
Oh dear, you think 1 mil SP will make you space rich?
---
It was removed because it was in a state such that security and maintenance were a problem.  It was replaced by a set of ESI endpoints that allow the same capabilities to be built into standalone web apps that run in a browser outside the game.

or we're in the bloc and we f1 monkey exactly as we're told because we lack any capability of independent thought. we just muster on through life waiting for someone authoritative to scream instructions at us, and do exactly as told. no thinking, just execution. do, or die.

so i'm gonna f1 monkey the shit out of the csm ballot

I haven’t listened yet, nor do I expect to, but does he mention how he has just as many Reddit alt accounts as he does in-game accounts so he can vote game his threads up immediately? Also does he multibox the Reddit accounts whenever he holds conversations with himself or does he use one browser window?

Why would they? Common sense tells me selling to your enemy is a bad idea. This is exactly what the market needs to shake things up. You've had your carebear ways too long. New players will see a lot more sales.
---
No one would stop you from selling to everyone. But if you're a douchebag why should they sell to you? That's common sense.

Fair, dual rep is gonna be tight for low sp though with the cap and fitting concerns.

It protects the "buyer" through plausible deniability. The buyer is not responsible for someone filling their ludicrous buy order or selling at a ridiculous low price. CCP can't prove.

Make widows great again!

Shall we introduce.... Geno implants???

good for you to find something you like doing in eve
---
feather better, lmao
---
Dates were not clear.  Argue all you want, but the mass response put out by CCP is all the evidence you need.  If you cant accept that fact I cant help you.
---
Sure 500m+ for fitting Implants, hardwiring ones are cheaper iirc.
---
You mean unlisted features.
