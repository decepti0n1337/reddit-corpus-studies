Props to him for using it.

---
---
Yeah the resemblance is striking. I wonder whether the censor overlords consider this acceptable or whether they will demand the trigs to redesign their ships to protect our fragile boyish souls.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs called the ship tree in an app called Eve Online.
---
:sob:
---
&gt; EDIT: NOT FEATURED THERE IS THE 40-MAN PL JACKDAW FLEET THAT DIDN'T DO JACK SHIT
---

---
I AM SHOCKED BY THIS EDIT. ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. WHEN WILL PL FINALLY GET PULLED FROM LIFE SUPPORT AND KNEEL TO KING GOBBINS?
---
You could try Neocom II, I think that may be what you are looking for. :)
---
As long as they are finishing the sites and not cherry picking, it's not a problem.
---
As a Slav (of southern flavor) i can tell you that these names have meaning and might be relevant to speculation. For example "narodnya" clearly comes from "narod" which means people, in this form it can be people translated as possessive form of "people" so "people's \[something\]". Navka is interesting. In some Slavic languages there was a tendency to replace "u" with "v", so if you do that here, this sounds very much like "nauka" which is literally "science" (might be "education" in some langs?). And koschoi; this one i dont know, but it kinda sounds like "kost" which means "bone" and koschoi would be a group of people with prominent bones?
---
Fitting window does this...?
---
GANKS ARE FOR LOW TIER PILOTS
---
Dont say that when Stain gets a low sec gate you know the severs am being shutdown
---
supposedly a BPO will exist......
---
not only another capital to fly, another dirt cheap capital to fly.
---
bless
---
Availability of bpcs and time to get the amount required will be factors that your not considering
---
Yes. Lowsec missions have higher rewards though.
---
i love his stories
---
from what I remember when watching the eve vegas stream, they teased at a BPO you could get for it, which god I hope that never gets past a meme.
---
Mow in the dark got me üòÅ
---
Brooo you don't even know? Lmao you wouldn't get very far in the ranks of TAPI's FC halls then.
---
If you were in any way serious youd just stop renting to people you cant effectively control.
---
As I mentioned, the best app for your phone for that would be Neocom II. Just be aware it crashes often and barely gets updated but it gets the job done.
---
Tapi feeding dreads to ncpl during oijanen deployment?
---
Not directly Red October. He also did write a technical book about nuclear submarines (In Germany it was litteraly named ‚ÄöNuclear submarine /Atomuboot‚Äò) and the controversy was that he got too close to reality with some of it, yet other stuff was wrong, although they never told him what was wrong.
---
Sure. I too was in a corp with IRL friends until they won EVE.
---
:(
---
test flair please ignore

what about this bad boi  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/25471717/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/25471717/)
---
Where can I check how much SP I need to build a rorq? And what modules the azbel would need to build?
---
How much times is there between two jumps?
---
I'll look how far away are the closest rorqual next time I get  a lowsec static, but since I plan on risking that rorqual I might try to build them, just need to know how much SP and isk is  requiered
---
"POS code" was a joke when I first started playing in 2014 so they've known for a minute.
---
In the same situation myself. I left during the shitshow in 2011 and have just come back a week ago. I was seriously lost and so, after lots of yt vids on how to play eve again, I started by getting all my stuff out of captured fw systems (due to the current fw mission boycott thing going on), then reorganised all my highsec stuff into one or two stations and have just done the newbie buy twenty rifters with t1 fits and DiaF in order to learn again. Dunno how long I'm going to stick with fw, though. Seems mighty dead compared to 8 years ago.
---
Citadels suck. POSes were far more flexible and fun to play around with.
---
F. Got me there. Guess I'll take the #2 spot. And this kill is #3

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/41x8ma/i_updated_the_instawarp_travelceptor_aligntime/?st=k36tdd9c&amp;sh=d4b7e841   This is also a good guide for capsulers wanting to jet around the galaxy.
---
I know almost nothing about coding, but your description of good code applies to nearly any field. 
---
How does one instantly recognize that someone else is a master at a skill? It is easy to understand for a moron, easy for them to explain to a moron, and looks easy for a moron. 
---
Mastery is about elegance and forethought. It can only be obtained through time and lots of struggle.
---
NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO PLAY THIS GAME HAVE BEEN ON ENOUGH DATES TO UNDERSTAND THEM?
---
Mmm if only ccp had a few servers to test the removal of the code on. To bad they dont have a test server and a filling group to test stuff lol
---
Player owned starbase. They are the control towers you see on d-scan as you warp through systems. When they are active they have force fields around them with maybe some containers and guns.
---
it's spelled stalking, casper...
---
Am friends with him, Recommend it
---
It makes some isk, but it did not really follow inflation.
---
Not in Portland
---
If I was home it wouldn't even be a minute
---
So wait, which was it?
---
Because when you rage pinged to form back up fleets just to go out to hit another citadel, you were told that was the 'objective'.
---
For the winning side in the war, you guys sure move a lot of goalposts lmao.
---
Ya. They actually didn't think people could be capable of making titans that fast; they thought they could take time making all the code for it. The code for releasing titans into the game world after it finished manufacturing wasn't in the game yet, so apparently the clock for the final assembly stopped and 00:00.
---
iTs WaR!!!11
---
It's a fucking videogame dude, if your guys were having fun while we weren't that would be another thing entirely. But when the indicated behaviour was as toxic to your own as it (supposedly) was to us, you should really stop to question the motives.
---
Easily.  
---
There is no flow.  
---
Everything has ground to a shuddering halt and pve farming is all that happens other than staged and pre-agreed fleet fights to give the game some column inches in gaming media so CCP can pretend things are fine.
---
But, we DO want another one! It was content!
---
MOST PEOPLE WHO PLAY THIS GAME ARE SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO CARTOONS ANYWAYS
---
They should have addressed the problem of capital proliferation first rather than introduce a new cap...
---
You're the only ones who run with PL fear mongering narrative to justify being blue to goons.
---
well, when I was doing PVE I very often stayed in tether because I did not want to reenable all my running modules, armor, drones get's repaired without additional clicking here and there etc. and you have overview who is that and what he is in.
---
So assuming this as botting is quite.... not right at least.
---
If it is real it suck a lot...
---
Nice try to meta-launder your character history with this reddit thread.
---
glorious
---
*cries in alpha*
---
I had fun, i think the whole toxic thing comes from other spins.
---
Like no shit. 
---
He played a MASSIVE role in making TAPI turtle up, 
---
Ensuring that goons blue up longer than the ‚ÄúEvErYonE AgAiNst TApI‚Äù War, 
---
Of making a safe haven for bots and just trying minimalistic approaches of keeping inter TAPI rhetoric that he‚Äôs cleaning it up and canning any one of them that has ‚Äúproof‚Äù behind it. when I‚Äôve been around him for what would amount to real life days in smaller comms channels where it seems like he knows a little more than he‚Äôs letting up to.
---
Of instantly reaching out the olive branch to anyone they would deem remotely a threat to the way they‚Äôd like to continue playing the game, thus nullifying any future content other than trying to evict alliances out of space to further buffer and make isk. 
---
I never really thought about it like that but it seems you‚Äôre actually spot on bro lol.
---
Yes... Pyfa let's you do that.
---
It's still something that has to be done.
---
One person going solo for solo content to make some solo pvp youtube videos is not what i would call "bringing content". And comparing AB-Salty to a entire alliance is a pretty stretch.
---
BRAVE ptsd..................
---
ok boomer
---
idgaf about killmails, logi is great. That feel when you save someone in hull is jaw crackingly tense
---
Under rated comment
---
I'd rather be useless than be the rot.
---
Botting can bring world peace!
---
Being EWAR is also good fun. Jamming enemy logi is thrilling and can really help your gang turn the tide
---
I was thinking it might be good to introduce a new clone state for maybe 250 plex/month that wouldn't pause training but wouldn't even let you undock and would still apply alpha restrictions on passive income activites, for those who are taking a break from EVE but are still playing Skill Queue Online. Yes, I know it wouldn't make the game more alive since such people don't give or create content but it would give more revenue to CCP so they would hopefully hire a good dev who would work on more important problems.
---
those allys and people are mentally ill and literally does not have any fun in the game at all. Constant care about absolutely useless ranking system is beyond any type of normal brain functions.
---
I've met two of those people as well, was really funny when they lost a ship and immediatelly rage quitted because of "stupid game" and red KB .... what fun is that?
---
We are past event horizon, approaching our end in singularity
---
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  Source your crap or gtfo.
---
Don't worry, CCP also forgot they were in the game.
---
No, sadly C02 are no longer with us.
---
Yeah command BC‚Äôs are more then strong enough. Most new players complete the arc in T1 destroyers or cruisers
---
I understood exactly what you meant.  It's you that doesn't understand that eve money and irl money are more similar than they are dissimilar.  
---
An alliance is more like a business than it is like a wow guild, and isk is more like an american dollar than it is a monopoly dollar.
---
You can get plenty of kill, I main logi and that never stopped me from being in the top of my Corp zkill each month. Whoring is an art, don‚Äôt let people tell you otherwise.
---
I did. It was my boss, am fired.
---
Honestly any laptop could do, eve is very forgiving. I play on an HP Pavilion from 2011 with an intel hd 4000 and get like 40 fps lol. Anything made in the last decade can run eve just fine.
---
In turn this behavior is driven by game mechanics.
---
Mittani about passive moon btw

looks more like a croissant and a dorito
---
What I havent seen in this thread is the Prophecy.
---
It is the Amarr Battlecruiser based on Drones.
---
It has 7 low slows, so tank should be more than enough for L3 missions.
---
If you want to stick to Amarr and skills trained in that direction go Prophecy. 
---
Drones are mostly a Gallente thing, where the gila/rattle are pirate faction that combines the drones of Gallente with missle &amp; shields from Caldari.
---
They have been allies for quite a while now. They may not have each other set +5 ingame but you can bet they would be brothers in arms immediatly when stuff happens.
---
Fake news
---
Stain should also be marked useless according to this sub
---
It's nice to have a record of what you've done. It's not about the kills, they're fucking logi after all
---
What a pile of hot garbage.
---
People are afraid of fighting ? People ask for nothing more than fighting. They just don't want to go through the insufferable process CCP made it, a.k.a having to spend a week on a shitty citadel because of three timers all of that for nothing because those who are attacked can just stay offline and play PUBG or Fortnite while their stuctures get blown away without loosing anything because of asset safety.
---
All in all you are totally wrong and your statement is full of shit, worst part is you're getting upvoted. This pretty much sums up why Homo Redditus is the second worth thing that happened after anime.
---
Try to mine it with your rorqual, bring me the imperium playstyle ;-)
---
WHERE U AT THEN ILL COME FIND YOU
---
And the residents that provi-bloc wish weren't residents.
---
I know I've seen a few systems have a bunch of training sites that were probably meant for this. In your agency, look for a system that has at least 8 signatures, and you should be able to find one of these sites.
---
Oh right, I'll just burn through it in a Ruppy then.
---
I just looked back through zkill and went on a nostalgia trip! From the losses rather than the kills, which is surprising!
---
No just check the shoes. This is why I leave extra shoes at work.
---
PushX is pretty great and reliable too!
---
now that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd call Karma
---
Be a bit weird if DHL gave you ¬£200,000 collateral on a package they were charging you ¬£20 quid to deliver.
---
I often liken Eve to 1984
---
Same
---
lol indeed
---
Highsec sites dont have good loot. Go to null or wormholes. I recommend wormholes, you can get into them directly from highsec and you dont have to deal with gate camps and bubbles. Search for a wormhole exploration guide on Youtube, im sure there are several.
---
Ye has been some okay fights recently. Dunno why all you other big groups don't punch on with each other though. Looks like those fleets would actually be a ton of fun to smash into each other.
---
Aren't we stamping on some wormhole dudes. Idk I'm still buying caps in 1dq pls help
---
In a scale from iodized to maldon, how good is the Toyota land cruiser mate
---
Nah man its the structure grind. Fuck that. Its not fun and i have better things to do with my life.
---
What time bro. Did you hit my t2 fights and content generator on m-o?
---
Au strong m8
---
Dank, nice meme
---
I'm also considering a laptop upgrade for similar (up to 4, okay with potato although being able to run better grfx would be awesome). Hoping black friday brings something decent to with the 1000-1200 range. 
---
Been using an asus for about 5 years or more, has a gtx 635m in it, takes me a bit to get going but once I get everything loaded it's mostly decent. A SSD would probably breath another year or two of life into it, as my stuttering and such seems to be HDD based. Also I currently only run 3 accts since it seems like a 4th would be rough.
---
Would like to look at the RoG stuff or TUF but seen hit and miss reviews.
---
There is a whole playstyle involving doubleclicking in space, once you got the basics this is far superior to the standard keep at range/orbit commands and you can outplay anyone using those. In the right conditions this enables a small group of players to take fights against groups 10 times their size with true adrenaline rushes.

[https://youtu.be/P6-Cks0M0kA](https://youtu.be/P6-Cks0M0kA) is a great start if you have the time
---
Good to know. Coverage is patchy these days.
---
Yeah exactly what Ser said below, I asked goons for assistance because I wasn't confident we would get the numbers after the move op.  
---
As it turns out we did but we still weren't looking for a good fight. While it might read like crap, neither were your own fcs otherwise why would they attack the place we had just left instead of where we were going?  
---
Everyone loves good fights but everyone also realises sometimes goodfights are not the way to keep your basic shit alive.  
---
And yes lasagne is awesome.
---
Where is the SOV map for WH space?
---
I got three 25k rewards during the program and never got any 50k. I stay mostly in high sec and I'm alpha so wonder if those factors had anything to do with it.
---
If the job was to go to zkill between the arazu and the athanor I guess
---
i guess you just can't read and can't understand written text.
---
That's ok, you'll learn someday if you'll be trying hard.
---
Be a hipster. Get a MacBook pro
---
I'm not sure I'd place money on bets that the channel moderators have inside knowledge of when it will end, since no official end date was ever given. I'd want to here it from an actual dev.
---
no, my alphas in high sec got the 50k one a few times.
---
You and me both. While I build and maintain ships that float on water I'd love to do my profession in space.
---
What group is the "????????" for?
---
Still waiting for logi on km
---
1.) If you light immediately, as rorquals used to, then the recon likely dies before a response can form
---
2.) If you wait until response is formed, an inhib is likely anchored, so you have to light 100km off. There is a huge difference between a response fleet dropping at 0 or more than 100 off. 
---
3.) Not everyone has a recon ready
---
4.) Nobody implied we were only talking about Delve at the start of this conversation
---
And even having said all of that, inhibs are still stronger than they were before. They were literally useless before, as all rorqs and supers would cyno up the second they were bubbled anyway.
---
The issue is Gigx really harmed CCP's hands off approach to moderation, along with being way to heavy handed to his fleet members there for handing power to another gigx is likely isn't such agree idea as it like taking your hands off the responsibility for the lack of content.
---
&gt;We lost 
---
Hm
---
Definitely a missed opportunity for branding.
---
The hound was definitely part of your group.
---
El Gigx
---
Honestly id prefer an enhanced killing spree over learning implants. As learning implants are inherently geared towards non pvp. Let learning implants be like the clones of old. Obsolete.
---
Hand on heart, I honestly agree with your finger pointing. I'm not sure eve can handle another alliance leader with his hand on the nuke button. However two thumbs up for trying to grabbing the proverbial content bull by the horns.
---
***jazz hands intensifies***
---
I hope you insure my packages if you going there
---
Let me just up my collateral on this contract
---
this is not the exploit you are looking for. *waves hand*
---
I THOUGHT THEY DID THAT.
---
Hard disagree.  There was a cold war on, yes, and content was thin, but there was not the current paradigm where if one side seriously attacked the other, they would simply evacuate as the only viable strategic choice.  The Halloween War was a serious conflict where there was doubt about who would win both the overall war and the major titan throwdown battle.  Compare that to the recent goon campaign against Tribute.  Neither of those things are even vaguely in doubt today.
---
&gt; Neither side has a reason to blue each other.
---
When has that ever stopped anyone?
---
Yeah, except that i wouldnt necessarily go as far as to claim that test doesnt care for krabs, its more like in order for people to want to chase hostiles in your space, these hostiles need to have content value (function of value of their ships and your ability to catch them). If that content value is low enough (for example its extremely difficult to catch them) you should dock up rather than expect someone will come to save you, because thats not how it works.
---
Sounds lame.
---
So are you a returning player or just a troll?
---
I tell you why the game is dead and you tell me about tools? What new tools are we talking about here? There are no conflict drivers left in the game.
---
Is it 3k per folder?
---
Farm salt.
---
Repeat.
---
Profit.
---
Don‚Äôt make me murder you with an axe (in-game).
---
Status quo goes on though. Guys like to be safe rather than have any risk at all
---
&gt;will only engage in pvp on days when not in thier plus 4 or 5 clone.
---
You can clone swap in citadels without any timer.
---
&gt; 1) What do you guys do with your time in EvE?
---
I camp gates.
---
&gt; 2) What do you do for fun?
---
&gt; 3) What do you do to earn ISK?
---
I spot an broken opportunity about once every year which yields ridiculous isk. This year, for example, it was based on the standing drugs. I farm for a few weeks, then return to camping.
---
&gt; 4) Why do you do it?
---
Gatecamping is life.
---
looks like it, i dident try will wait for it to come to tq
---
Miss you bby xox
---
As someone who collected the data over 15 characters, its ~75% for 10k, ~20% for 25k, and ~5% for 50k
---
Im not a bitter vet, i started iirc late 2017. 
---
1. All sorts of activities required in order to be able to PVP. Mostly earning enough isk and getting the right stuff in right places. 
---
2. Primarily PVP but i also enjoy making complicated and valuable things (like capital ships). 
---
3. I started out as explorer, earned enough isk to plex myself, and then started trading to keep myself plexed, moved a bit into industry, traded some more, earned enough isk to buy a Rorq, started mining with the Rorq, and then moved into serious industry like building capital ships and researching blueprints for their fits. 
---
My general idea was to try to avoid playing monthly subscription if possible, and i succeeded to a very large degree. I think i only ever bought some small like 10$ packs. 
---
4. I get some strange kind of satisfaction from growing my assets and characters. And obviously there is PVP.
---
A good portion of 5 years of my life were spent on the labour of love that is the AT. I was on the PL team for a few years (with a minor appearance in the Sniggwaffe team beforehand). I commentated ATXII and AXIII in Iceland, ATXIV as part of the remote crew, and was honored to host the last two; ATXV and ATXVI. I wrote tens of thousands of words about the teams, the games, the history, the experiences, once I was writing around 2-3k words a day in 2015 while being in a show at the Edinburgh Fringe, which I flew from direct to Iceland for ATXIII. I was so tired i kept passing out. Even then, all I did was NOTHING in comparison to so many of the people who produced the events and many of the teams of players for whom the cliche of EVE being a second job was actually true for those long summer months.
---
I cannot begin to convey the passion and force of will of those players and Devs, past and present, who were involved in the endeavor. For me, it was emblematic of the act of playing EVE. A whole metric fuckton of love, effort, pain and swearing in our own little comer of the Internet/universe. Not because it necessarily made sense, but because we loved it
---
My favourite quote kind of sums up the AT for me:
---
**djWHEAT**@djWHEAT

All I want more than anything, is to work with people who give a fuck as much as I do.

Morth you sexy beast you coming to Eve London?
---
Normal cyno can be fitted on force recons and black ops battleships only. Other than that it works pretty much like before.
---
Industrial cyno can fit on venture and T1 industrials (haulers). Only jump freighters and blops can jump to it (blops can bridge).
---
Covert-ops cyno has not changed
---
I do carrier ratting, escalations, PI and trading for isk. I do pvp for fun: solo/small scale. Exploration when i get sentimental, cause this made my first billions in this game. And the most important: chat on comms with guys i met. Planning to get into mining so that i can chat and make some isk as well. Plans for the future: run our own corp. Guess we have enough experience after playing this game for 5 years.
---
nah, just leave your nullbloc and move somewhere fun
---
That's why you are still around?
---
Well that's the whole point of the "post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy." Is that just because two things happen one right after the other, even if they might seem related, they might just be coincidences and one is not actually caused by the other.
---
And in this case, the facts actually don't support the original post. As far as I've read, modern Korean and modern Chinese are written top to bottom then left to right.
---
But he never did that
---
I DED site run and run relic sites. I am kinda newbie so I'm saving up for an alt. I find DED sites fun but I also pvp a decent amount (I'm partial to solo SB though).
---
so 10 fleets per day? How is that possible?
---
[removed]
---
For a career in eve I run corp security and head of recruitment.
---
Can't make billions doing admin stuff though:(
