How can you focus on three things at once? /s

---
If the code doesn't work, you might be able to get 2 months of gametime for it if you open a ticket with a GM. Worth a shot, maybe.
---
It's gone homer.
---
I doubt sov fees, invention fees, and titan books directly affect newbros.
---
Exactly. I just got back onto the game after awhile away and I have no complaints and everyone that I've interacted with in game seem to be having fun. 
---

---
Then I come on here and I'm wondering if I'm even playing the same game
---
My screenshot is on top ? O.o :3 My time to shine \o/ Weeee.
---
I wonder how many times you didn’t die by randomly warping to the sun...
---
Tell that to the employees trying to cash paychecks, the electric companies trying to collect their bills, and hardware companies trying to collect on their invoices.  Don't worry guys, money is not of value.
---
Your literally dumb as fuck you’ll are the ones bitching about the blue donut. Oh and look what happened during blackout, ccp lost so many players that they didn’t keep it.  Maybe that tells you that most of the players don’t agree with you and all I’ve seen these past few months is people bitching about a super cap umbrella mostly shitty ass people like your self.  Your the reason people say if you want to have fun in eve stay off Reddit. Oh and if we weren’t around neither would the Game be. Acting like 75 percent of people who play don’t live in null. Take you’re shitty play style and cry some more because that’s what you’ll are best at.
---
I wouldn't mind if SP gain was replaced every day by a daily login reward.  The sunk cost fallacy effect would still be in place.
---
What would be interesting would be to hunt players, anchor an illegal brain farm in low security space, and generate a class of skill injectors, which would of course be taken off of the SCC controlled markets and contract system.
---
It would be interesting if each rank of a skill was its own book, and you had to find them, buy them or steal them.  Alternately, you could pay a subscription to a learning institution to keep a skill level active, thus creating a permanent passive isk sink.  
---
The T3-linked SP system was almost a good idea.  Frankly, I like the idea of ships or industrial facilities gaining their own SP instead of players.
---
Successful corps are born within existing corps, and then emerge like a beautiful tapeworm.
---
Why would they give the reward for shooting a corvette?
---
Thank you Lieutenant Obvious..... :)
---
Sorry, are we playing different games or something?
---
What taxes exist in highsec but not in low/null?
---
I totally missed that part of the stream.....
---
[deleted]
---
Npc corp taxes for one, but regardless, the taxes are still the cost of concord regardless of where you operate.
---
When I came back from my long break thoes skills got converted to lots of SP that I used to fill in some holes after 10 years.
---
So I make a new Alpha whenever I need more SP.
---
What else is there to do down there lol
---
I’m a new player and i stayed because of my corp that taught me how to play the game. Without my corp and just based on the tutorial + career agents I think I probably wouldn’t stay too long.
---
Congrats you sperged so hard and with so much text that no one can be bothered to counter your sperg with something constructive. A* for you
---
Ive done the whole spread out across 5+ regions and try to defend it. There is nothing wrong with entities fully utilizing their space, leaving more out there for others to make their mark in. Look at tribute and vale of the silent being great examples. I worry about entities like test who are rather spread out.
---
I would say that thread was very on the nose for EveUni anymore.
---
If someone in that organization has ideas about changes or improvements the attitude is, "You've outgrown the Uni, heres the door."
---
But it’s not only 10 though is it.....
---
Just a guess on my part. We'll find out come Vegas.
---
I've been studying long and hard and it's time to get some practical shiptoasting under my belt. I hear it's an important skill for life on the outside of the uni.
---
Yep I run these in my cap stable Regen Sleipnir, it is a beast for it.
---
Can't remember the exact cost but I believe I only spent 500 mil cause I already had a Pith X-type LSB laying around. Would only cost 1 bil otherwise. You can definitely do these sites cheaper but the Sleipnir clears them in 7-9 minutes. Not sure if I could hit that time otherwise.
---
Try out Abyssal sites - they’re a lot of fun, good money, and you’ll learn a lot about piloting!!
---
good spin but IH alone outnumbered us!
---
Congrats you added absolutely nothing of value.
---
Imagine getting complex answers about a complex game with complex game mechanics :o
---
Also would you like me to compress complex game mechanics into two sentences so the next time CCP tries to implement a simple fix they read about on readdit it breaks the game even more than the last 5 times because they disregarded basic mechanics again ?
---
So, do drones grab bomb and pull it to the target?
---
No you do just start crafting industry is fun and there is tons of stuff you can make right away ammo and cap charges come to mind. But right now just selling compressed ore might be the best thing to do till you have a bit of a bank roll going as industry is a black hole for a while
---
you actually found a Sansha Wormhole, if im correct; there is only 2 of them. Cool thing about them is that sansha holes spawn sansha combat and ded sites
---
Hell yeah I’ll check that out. Thanks for the help m8.
---
Isk for fights yes will create fights.
---
I’ve got some hobgoblins and they protect me from anything but Raznaborg Dramvisks (spelling prob wrong). Those guys fuck me up really hard.
---
Well I have never seen those spawn in dital. Get to dital and when you have enough isk to take the plunge into null sec and make some real isk head to kbp-7 then to the bw pocket take a look on the map in eve eye it will make more sense then
---
Join a small pvp group. They will teach you
---
always look people up, I don't know saint but his zkill is impressive, he would be a good friend to run fits and random ideas through for sure. https://zkillboard.com/character/1289833229/
---
For making ISK with pewpew you need to either go into WHs or null. In High / Low you need to scan for signatures and run them, its quite low throughput too tho.
---
For noobs its generally best starting scanning and hacking. It pays the best if you cant join / are not in a big nullblock. Go into Sansha or Gurista Null Space and focus on Relic sites. Leave Highsec through a Wormhole and try to find a path into areas where there are Relicsites worthwhile, it pays great but is kinda difficult to get into, but you can do it for yourself on your own terms without requiring other players to do shit for you. Its good ISK/h and you learn a lot about the game, about fits etc.
---
Best way to make money as noob I personally tested myself is joining a big nullblock. Start salvaging behind Supers and Titans. A Titan clears a Rockhaven in 5min, they leave behind about 3-5mil ISK in salvage and about 7-9mil ISK in modules. Gather everything and contract it to Jita or sell to your Corp. A single Titan leaves about 120mil ISK/h behind, you just need to pick it up and clean his feces. One mans trash is another mans treasure! Also salvaging is really easy since you need next to no skillpoints, go get a Salvage Destroyer and an Industrial Transporter in combination they're better than a Noctis. You need a huge throughput, a single Titan clears 12 Havens an hour - but there will be Supers in Sanctums too, if you sit in a Noctis you're to slow to make max profit.
---
Doing pewpew won't pay nearly as much as scanning or salvaging. Especially if you're new and especially if you're not in any noteworthy corp, or a corp that gives a fuck about their new members.
---
PewPew can pay very good once you're fit to run duo, solo c4 / c5 combatsites in WH or doing solo 6/10, 10/10 DED in Null.
---
But for now better stick to something you can do consistently solo from highsec and that would be scanning and hacking relicsites.
---
Incursions are great once you have a little bit of isk and sp to get started, it’s pretty easy to break into now. There are a bunch of big groups that run them, it’s like 100m/hr and up in battleships. 
---
Exploration is good and pretty easy to get into too, slide into low or null in an astero and go to town
---
This is literally the most interesting Eve article/story I've read today.

Good luck!

Its because a certain type of EVE player is actively searching and abusing/exploiting loopholes in number spaces.
---
Example 1 - A wormhole entity abused the Effects of a C6 Magnetar paired with massive RemoteTrackingBoosts to overturn the numbers toa ctually get infinit tracking and range, resulting in Blaster-BS doing wreckings over several hundred kilometers.
---
Example 2 - On introduction of Faction War a group from Goonswarm exploited the mechanic that PvP kills gave you LP for your faction based on the killmails worth. They manipulated some items on Jita market to insane prices, stuffed freighters with them, put them in opposite militia and killed them. Some of them collected so much LP the counter turned over.
---
Welcome to EvE you are weird from the moment you login my friend !
---
I see what you did here ;)
---
Favorite AT memory - my 40th birthday party, attended by 25 of my corp and alliance mates, watching PL win on a big screen projector and smug-Shadoo losing his mind.  Good times... never to be seen again I guess.
---
Think back to your first adrenaline kick when you lost everything you owned in a fight you had no idea how to win.
---
A lot of the people who read about how hardcore EVE is, and it's PVP nature, are drawn by a desire to feel that kick.
---
IMO that's what really gets the hook in. The feeling of total loss, the excitement from it, and the desire to feel it again.
---
It's also the primary nostalgia point for veteran players; they miss that adrenaline and fear that is associated with loss, which eventually you just don't feel anymore.
---
Looks dope
---
But why did you not run weeping like a child to ccp asking for a patch that secures your loot? Would have saved you some time for watching Netflix...
---
Maybe because you not retarded Dinos ....

Why are you trying to brawl near Titans?

Bosons didn't kill brawling. Fleets that bring a billion booshers killed brawling

First, congratulations for selecting the best rookie system, Kisogo.

Second, when you click on the system's name in the top left corner, it opens a window about the system. Under the stations tab, you'll see only one station. That is what you were looking for.

Completely agree. I've quit the game 3 times, First was for learning skills. Second was because I remapped stupidly and the third time was when my friends quit because now they experienced what I did that made me quit the first two times. Citadels (and the no jump clone cooldown) made it a lot better but I still remembered when I hesitated to do stuff because it felt like I would waste valuable skillpoints whenever I did stuff. Still do but nowadays I have most skills I have use of trained so it's not that bad.

Yes.  Also Dust514 and "We need to use some of this World of Darkness tech."  But mostly just an absolute disconnect between the players playing the game and the developers who weren't.  This eventually led to the 'Summer of Rage' and CCP Unifex and CCP Seagull being given a chance to have some sort of actual vision for EVE again.  Go re-watch the "Prophecy" trailer from Fanfest 2014.  There is a LOT going on there lore and feature-wise which was, once again, subsequently later abandoned.
---
look at the top post on r/eve right now. its about how someone wants to make some random station in venal that isnt even a mission hub a market hub, for no good reason at all  
---
If you think that there's much higher quality stuff than this posted on the sub you're mistaken
---
I probably have a mountain of crap still in the station.
---
Yeah I just downvoted him and moved on lmao. I do enjoy memes here, but I also enjoy being a dick to everyone, regardless of their post.
---
I asked a group of friends to download, and of the 5 that did we lost one immediately upon logging in and seeing the UI, and the guys who stuck it out are doing great but it is not easy to figure this stuff out as you go.
---
Noob here: I keep seeing things like "krab fleet" and "krabbing". Can anyone please explain what that is?
---
I too enjoy being a dick

I think you'll find that is thinking inside the bot.

You can still hear the screams of thousands of recons dropping out of warp...

I like what the DKS is doing, but the asian schoolgirl pedo stuff made me cringe. This video has been approved with a pedobear seal of approval!
---
I was going to comment along similar lines, they probably run all numbers through a standard number formatter, and it just spits out the appropriate output.
---
they ran them in dreads AND stole loot when it wasnt feasable to run; in a DST i might add its not like its hard to keep a DST from leaving/getting into the target system, or stealing loot in the first place, especially if its your sov  
---
dropping more supers on it doesnt solve the problem tho so it must be broken
---
listen to this man
---
Bully.
---
A positive post for once. Good Luck dude!
---
Shoutout to the dude who posted about the free sp because i haven't logged in for over a week lmao
---
Depends. Small wormhole groups will probably expect you to be on and active every other day or so, especially on weekends, although if you have something temporary come up irl (like work getting busy, or a vacation) they will understand. Big nullblocs like Pandemic Horde don't have any participation requirements at all, you can log in once every two months to do bomber fleets and they'll still let you stay in
---
Thank you to our industrialists who regularly build ships just so I can take out Newbro-Fleets and blow them up. Oh yeah, and get ridiculously good SRP on top of that (seriously, I can make a profit off whelping Merlins and Caracals in the Uni).
---
Idk how spacesuits are in the eve universe but given that the stations are like nearly 100km on an axis it's probably so that the workers don't have to go EVA that entire distance
---
It's the hard limit for subcapital targeting range, it's quite accurate. There's no such limit for guns because it wouldn't matter anyway.
---
If you're too new to be in an alliance you should stick to highsec missions - these aren't missions for newbies.
---
&gt;You think you have a complex answer?

At least I did more than be an insecure moron looking for a fight

Loook, The Guristas are made up of human beings much like the State, Federation, Empire and Republic. I don't feel any bolder supporting them than i would be waving around the flag of the Caldari

did you even undock, bruh?
---
RP reasons and the reasons listed in the Op :u
---
Same. I was like shit I better go make a tool for myself.
---
As with everyone else in this, EVE is a sandbox where you make your own goals and targets. For me 11 years ago it was to get into a carrier, I fell hard for the Archon and still have a lot of love for that carrier. Ran a lot of Wormhole space with Narwhals Ate My Duck before its collapse, all with the goal of getting rich off sleepers.
---
My goals now days are to relax and have fun with friends but also give them gateways to additional content, some old friends also returned to the game so we've been sorting out our connections as networking in EVE is something I find very important.
---
All in all, find something you want to do and aim for it.
---
A quote from the old forums I've always lived by; "EVE is like a sandbox, with landmines"
---
# EXPECT LESS. REMAIN HAPPY.
---
By your logic, missions should only be given out once, why would a npc send you to do something that you already did? Also no more npc pirates in high sec. Once you mine a asteroid belt it should never come back. I think your ideas are bad and you should feel bad
---
If you like the game but only stop because you don't know people who play, I suggest joining a small active corp that suits your playstyle.
---
Hey, I'd definitely be interested in helping out!
---
Ah, just checked out "scram" meaning, then yes, it is.
---
&gt; As someone who has lived in venal for a couple years I don’t see the point, everyone living there already has freighter services out there due to the fact you need to export lp to make any kind of money.
---
&gt; 
---
I have never used a freighter exporting worm BPOs. I haven't done a thing out here witha  freighter just yet aside from paying black frog to move 40 sealed containers from a Guristas stoyline mission i didn't wan to pass up.
---
&gt; Also trying to do anywhere other than the mission running pocket is just shooting yourself in the foot. H-P or N5Y are much better choices (anyone suggesting K3 just wants to camp a knockout station (it’s already camped hours on end anyway)).
---
Again, RP reasons and some reasons i listed in my OP for why i want 6nj. Mainly becuease it's right next door to the only research station in the region.
---
&gt; Also you will be hard pressed to find anyone flying t1 frigates and cruisers in venal.
---
You'd be surprised! I'm also helping people out here by handing out t1 frigates. So I'm starting to see more actually. I'm trying to build a customer base for those kinds of goods.
---
I've always stuck in low sec areas but have wanted to expand a bit
---
A “player” in real life is someone that has sex with lots of women.  Jam and scram is not officially used,  ur easy for me to tell he means a player tends to have sex with a girl once, then leaves before morning and never sees her again.
---
Well, it's a way to get "balanced" fight, but most fun I had I had in fights not balanced at all.
---
But, perhaps, I should try it too. Thank you!
---
i loooove these videos its just sad that i always have to pause to read the text since im busy watching the fight and pick up reading
---
Yeah, I am terrible at pvp, I make poor choices, like forget to take drugs, or leave my repper on...   It gives me a chance...
---
And I didn't say it earlier, but great vid. Videos like this make people like me better pilots!  Hopefully I will roll into you someday in jspace
---
Yeah, the only way my pals have been able to do burner stuff affordably is by waiting on the twice a week jf service that the burner group runs. You may try to diplomat some of the locals into not touching your basic t1 rigged production citadels that you freeport.

I don't think it was a joke. He was calling the blackbird pilot a coward for jamming you and then getting the fuck out.

&gt;My personal takeaway from the variety of leadership styles and people I reported to within EUNI is that the organisation changes very very slowly, it's hard for criticism of any kind to instigate change, and it's important for leaders to stay involved.
---
A very politically correct few paragraphs, so kudo's.  However I interpret this quoted section as:  EUNI leadership is disconnected, takes punitive action against criticism, are set in their ways and defend against any change blindly.  Yeah it does sound as though that other thread was on the nose and probably not a good place for newbro's.
---
EVE never was mainstream, so EVE COIN would probably face the same problem.
---
Well I took a 3 year break and returned end of 2017. From 2014 you'll pretty much be caught up except for the new race (Triglavians) and citadels. I found learning the mechanics of these over a few months made the game feel a bit refreshing.
---
1. Just slowly catch up not much has changed except for citadels, triglavians, and cynos. Not hard to figure out over a few weeks.
---
2. Look at /r/evejobs or the eve online forums. I'm going to shamelessly plug my casual lowsec pvp corp that is the perfect fit for people like you and me that work and can't play 23/7 anymore.

Essentially just log in and check it out. You don't have to subscribe if you just want to see how everything changed. If you intend on coming back to pvp you should definitely re-subscribe as alpha pvp is possible just not viable.
---
There are groups that exist for all different types of activity. As the player base has aged most organizations accept more casual players now than in the past.
---
Skill in fleet boosts so you can run an Orca or porpoise with boosts, and do not buy a station as tempting as it may be.  Just mine other peoples moon ore in .05 systems. split the profits evenly.

The Amarr Mining Campus falls under the watchful eyes of u/TurloughDominian and see his comments for more information. As a it of background, there have been traditionally two Directors of Special Projects (campuses being considered special projects) with the responsibility for overseeing the campuses split between the two. I was the director for the NSC, LSC, Soli, and FCC and Turlough is the director for the AMC, WHC, HSC, and the Incursion community. As turtle (as we lovingly call him), mentioned, if you have questions or concerns about one of his campuses, don't hesitate to reach out. Turtle's a great guy and I really enjoyed working with him (and under him at some point lenny.ascii) and I know would be willing to have a chat with you.

Indeed they haven't worked on a single game for so long. But cant't deny that they are capable of translating games to more languages. I mean CCP is like Paradox Interactive which took the same strategy. The difference is PI guys left the language problems to players and they perfectly solved.

It's a start, but they'd be better off if they did this and quit punishing people for being new.  Passive bonuses from skills are fun when everyone you play with is at the same level of skill points and people are making compromises based on what they want to improve.  They're not fun when only you are objectively, significantly worse at everything than the people you see in space.
---
It seems to be either a bug/grid issue, from a response I got below. Still unsure exactly what caused it. But if I find a definitive answer I'll let you know.

Idk I don't have an issue unless we're running minors I usually only need two or three cycles of heat before I catch her. I also use true sansha webs so maybe thats the diff.

I tend to kill zorya first every wave keeps contests down lol you know citidels repairs for free right? I literally only change ammo to deal with the leshack zorya in minors as she orbits at 40k and you have to catch her before hand she can be hard to kill with just antimatter if you don't catch her.

I got the XTC after I turned 18, it’s been through a lot with me, every part replaced almost, I got the NRS a few years ago, and while they are both borderline retro by today’s standards I love them and see no point in replacing until the cost of maintaining the fork/shock would be better spent getting a new used bike. I personally am really digging the FS, the NRS is meant to be quite stiff, and that’s fine, it likes to stiffen and extend under heavy peddling, but for sure take the edge off of bumps and small drops.

I have always wanted a BOB trailer as most my riding a trails, [I found this trailer](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/schwinn-rascal-plus-bike-trailer-for-dogs-2917832?) for $30 on clist, it’s great, I have a 60lb lab, I like that it’s closed in, she would have freaked out and jumped from an open one, she hates car rides too, doesn’t help at all that I’m taking her to a park or trail.

There’s eve online then r/eve. Two different games
---
thats racist im reporting u to sort
---
best ship in the game
---
It's piloted by MarkeeDragon, so it will just whelp to building CODEs and then cut the jetstream.
---
What area are you thinking about?
---
Tbh I’d be fine if they still had DDS. Maybe remove boson? Definitely remove haws if you’re going to take anything away
---
Appropriate on so many different levels for Eve.
---
Yeah the cultures are way different. Here if someone cycles on the edge of a country road, up a crest or before a corner. Cars slow down and stay behind the cyclist until its clear to do a regular overtaking.
---
Who limits themselves? You got 2.5m m3 worth of space in that sma... can fit quite a few dst's
---
I too support the destruction of Hong Kong by the PLA
---
Yeah see i dont run any tracking comps, i think its around 9.5 somewhere. And yeah, the increase is zorya only
---
Yeah i started in july 2012, farted around didn't do too much, just flew around and looked at shit once or twice a week, and then Asakai and subsequently Brave happened and I got a lot more involved with other players and enjoying the game more. I joined up in Hek and a week later we moved to rahadalon.

Post of the year

Proof that Hilmar is Satan.
---
Yes IIRC it was the idea, player-built gates, the Corp we see in the video is are Capsuleers
---
Sorry for the late reply this bots processing power is limited.
---
How can I say that simple Sorts my friend and I have respect for him
---
And thanking killah bee is obvious don't you think? the service and time all CSM members do, its dedication to a game they love no matter your views on one person on the CSM.
---
There is one person I dont like on the CSM right now and never will like but he still earns my respect for going up there and pitching ideas some good some bad, each person on the CSM is there because people believe they can do a good job
---
aah scram means "run away" in English slang, counter intuitive :)
---
zzzz
---
It would massively change all current setups. 50% less drone damage is enough to make plenty of gal ships complete ass.
---
Then dont let supers/titans tether or dock at keepstars.
---
I am good with either approach, but I am not good with locking small groups out from using titans safely while large groups can, this would create another barrier to entry.
---
Well, lets see here... the game dropped about 15-20% of its population in about 3-4 months, but hey at least the newbies are joining the game and having fun...
---
Would my orbea rallon suffice?
---
Get a rallon
---
Calling it now, it's going to be a complete fucking joke. Think of some core mechanic that can be changed, now do a 180 and fuck it up massively and put a sticker on it - core gameplay update...
---
While i have shot a mtu or 2 of eve uni, i wont be following them if they move. But having everyone a with in a few jumps from each other would be good. Better comms interaction, less overhead for campus management, better fleet numbers and hopefully not a soft target for war decs.
---
no, take a break from minecraft
---
Yes.
---
Are you so far you can't bend over to put your own socks on? 
---
Spend too much time on your PC and have 0 flexablity?
---
Introducing instasocks!
---
It was hilarious when you were trash-talking some WT's in local a few months ago after they got an actual response fleet formed up at them instead of the usual panic and telling everyone who's actually in standing fleet or comms to dock up.
---
Oh okay
