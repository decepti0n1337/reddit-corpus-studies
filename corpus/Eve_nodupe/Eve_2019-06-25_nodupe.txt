Is this war still happening?

I know what the CSM's role is. But I also know how to get things done.
---
do you though?
---
Definitely a steep learning curve , thanks for the positive vibes tho ‚úäüèº
---
Thanks for teaching me the proper terminology üôèüèº
---
ya. I do. If you think i can't do it in Eve you can look at the arguably second largest coalition in the game with arguably the second largest supercap fleet that i built from 3 titans and 6 supers (3 of which were me).
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you don't think i can do it in real life well then I'd suspect you don't know me. (and hopefully you don't)
---
A Titan.
---
So, in short its only a matter of time before EvE comes self aware and the NPC's rise up against the players and destroy the player population. Leading to the worlds first machine take over of a human world...
---
Well its been nice knowing you all.
---
I had to check this wasnt the Vily bot
---
Y'all recruiting?
---
Variety of reasons. Primarily due to the fact that high-class dread ratting is aimed at maximum efficiency via blapping as much as possible with capital guns, which you can't do with the Phoenix. There are a number of other reasons but that's the main one. You can, of course, do it, but you're talking 4 phoenixes to 2-cycle a C5 dread compared to 2 nags.
---
The first half of your post is a prime example of the risk vs reward aspect of EVE that is frequently touted by the playerbase. You can fly with +5 implants and risk the loss of a huge sum of ISK, but maximize your SP, or you can take the safer route and fly with cheaper or no implants and lose the possible SP you could have accumulated but risk little to nothing. 
---
You can't praise an aspect of the gameplay when it supports your opinion on one matter and completely dismiss it when it doesn't on another. You either have Risk vs Reward or you don't. 
---
You're being selective about how you approach the second part of your argument too. You did't have to sit in some backwater newbie system to gain kills for the dailies before, you chose to. Somehow that's someone else's fault other than your own because they didn't design it in a way to prevent you from doing it? You want to take the easy, boring way to do something, that's your choice. Don't sit there and act like it's a problem that someone else should be responsible for. Plenty of people got their NPC kills popping rats in nullsec, low, and wormhole space. I frequently got them on the way to doing something else. 
---
Most of the people I hear complaining are farmers. They farm everything and complain when CCP doesn't make it easy for them to farm using the 20 accounts they pay for because CCP should be catering to them for having 20 accounts. 
---
Multiboxing 20 Rorqs- Log in warp to ore anom and hoover up everything with a few clicks. 
---
Multibox 20 VNIs- Log in, warp VNIs to anoms, orbit and drop drones, 20 mins later rinse and repeat. VNIS are getting nerfed but the same goes for any other ratting ship. 
---
I could keep going but the point is that the "elites" that play this game have had an enormous advantage in terms of the returns they get for running multiple accounts. The one time something comes along and it's going to cause them more work than a few clicks to run all those accounts, and all of a sudden they're up in arms and howling about how shit it is and crying for CCP to make it a login reward that they collect by just logging all of their accounts in simultaneously wit ha single click.
---
#31 and #45 about the tengu are the same.  You might have missed something.  Overall theres some great things here.
---
Can you explain the rational behind 101 for me please?
---
0.o
---
its kind of a joke one, but caps are currently penalized in entosis, if someone has the balls to use a faction titan to entosis though i think that would be awesome.
---
Number 31 and 45 are the same.  You might have missed something.   I really like alot of these changes
---
Would be nice if you sorted this by ship class, weapon class, ammo, etc as well as added some supplemental document to explain your rationale for these suggested changes.
---
I think that‚Äôs a pretty baller idea man.
---
Out of everything here I would like blops the most as they need a lot of love to become combat reliable again.
---
Capitals are mostly fine atm.
---
Faster short range missiles.
---
Plex lp can also be exoloited. Afaik there are already people doing that
---
I had a pretty good laugh at 111 as well.
---
Please explain your reasoning behind these changes and why you came to the conclusion that these number alterations would be better than they are currently.
---
YES PLZ: 
---
Faction titans no longer have a 5x Entosis penalty
---
SP loss from T3C‚Äôs now capped at 50,000 Sp.
---
You probably would use 4 phoenixes, dumb redhand
---
would you forgive him if he adds item number 0?
---
It would just need to be based on distance, or even just make it easy and send the mission out via the Constellation chat channel. Theres no reason for an NPC to mail me inside a wormhole if theyre fighting someone in Aridia (though since seemingly two thirds of all lowsec wormholes lead to Aridia maybe they could).
---
I can't use *one* phoenix let alone 4
---
Why not both?
---
Nag &gt; moros &gt; rev &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phoenix

Are you planning on coming back to horde??
---
This list would make a lot more sense to people who aren't involved in the various activities/use the various ships/etc involved in each suggestion and be a lot easier to justify supporting if there were explanations as to your reasoning.
---
Why does the archon need +15 cpu, what problem does the ship have that this would solve? Revelation ditto? Why does that slot swap fix the bellicose? (I don't think it does.) Why does the caracal need more cpu? Why are 95% of these buffs, and what is your justification as to why that isn't powercreep?
---
I'm all for balance changes, but if you're going to make a claim as grand as "would fundamentally change the game as a whole for the better if implemented" you can't really present just a bare list of changes with no justifications or explanation.
---
Just choose the one whose portrait you like the most/ how you want to look. You can cross train between different race's ships so it doesn't matter
---
Thanks
---
Nanogangs exist due to lossmail fear. A common problem among lesser pilots, only exasperated by capital proliferation. 
---
There's a lot of issues rolled into what you said, but as it stands making short range ships faster would help their usage, instead of the meta we have today.
---
boring
---
to be honest i think that would be fine for faction supers but maybe not faction dreads.
---
Yeah i figured that as well, but it seems that some votes from Aryth went to him (if i'm reading that file correctly) which is why i was assuming he got some imperium votes.
---
one requires significant developer time. One requires the ability to change a 2 to a 4 in the database. I know what i would want and what i can aim for.
---
Item 45 is a super of item 31. Just fyi
---
sure im going through them now with explanations.
---
So hold up

You are alright with seeing people get oppressed and censored so you can get rid of the dirty bots in a game?

&gt;Entosis window is extended by 1hour on each side at ADM 2. By 30min on each side at ADM 6  
---
I'm not sure I'm reading this correctly, are you suggesting a 3 hour window at ADM 2? or are you saying current window +1?
---
Please suggest moving siege bonuses to a role bonus for faction dreads/faxes so that they actually see some use in game. Thank you.
---
As opposed to making minor adjustments to values within the game, can we instead work towards resolving the overarching issues and work our way down? 
---
And if you are going to suggest that massive of a balance update, why not go the extra mile and do a full re-balance, giving each ship a once over, each class of ships more purpose to see more use, and make brawling great again? Only if you've got the guts.
---
There's no incentive for them to fight, a keepstar is worth considerably less than the Titans that would be lost defending it, and in all but the most extreme cases of server crash the keep would still die. The game's balance is fucked and that is what should be blamed, not the fact that an alliance isn't really fussed with 12 hour tidi fests that don't even have a victory condition. If the enemy can replace Titans faster than you then there's literally zero reason to fight, your only objective as a defender is to grind down the enemy's numbers . . . but when Titans are semi disposable (on an aliance scale, where you lose 5-10 max per fight), why even bother?
---
It's not cowardly, but rather sensible. If you want NCPL or whoever to fight you'd need a victory condition of somesort, and in EVE 2019 the victory condition at any scale is literally boring the enemies . . .
---

I've literally heard nothing but complaints about this `war` from your members, and I'm literally not even affiliated with the north in the slightest. Normie nembers simply aren't enjoying tidi ops to bash astras and the like . . .
---
Yeah, if you think brawling is dead, just look at T3Ds, especially the Hecate. Nearly 3.5km/s heated, then you get scram + dual web and pump out upwards of 600 dps without sacrificing tank. The amount of times I‚Äôve killed a dictor/jag that thought it would survive long enough for backup to arrive is pretty much equal to the times I‚Äôve engaged a dictor or jag.
---
Missiles and drones are good for beginners. Turrets tend to have a little more skill needed. The easiest is drones, which would mean Gallente ships. Missiles are Caldari favs. When I started I knew nothing and chose Caldari based on looks and I‚Äôm currently a missile fan, but lasers are cool too. 
---
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt matter what race you select, but do a bit of research on what weapons you think you‚Äôll like. You‚Äôll need to train and better to not waste those skills.
---
Woah this is a great idea and in no way easily exploitable.
---
Brb need to go spin up some accounts and VMs to ~~bot~~ *totally not bot* in {enemy alliance}.

Don‚Äôt worry, I will transfer all of the proceeds directly to {alliance leadership} in a way that is very obvious and easily traceable.
---
:smort:
---
Is this a self aware joke? because if so it‚Äôs pretty clever and I definitely don‚Äôt give CVA enough credit.
---
Well said.
---
Rumor has it between 0 and 100% of trc leadership was absent from this fight, I don't know why.
---
it's better than the hakarl for sure
---
Yeah a frig is prolly a lot closer to the size of a commercial airliner. 
---
An aircraft carrier is definitely closer to the size of an EVE cruiser or BC :P
---
Well that's hardly my problem lol.
---
Good to know! My research syarted with Caldari Ships, so I will definitely consider missiles!
---
if it were up to me I most likely would, being an NBI was one of the most enjoyable things ive done
---
The old model looks distinctly Caldari. The new one, not so much. Or at all.
---
They do make cargo scanners. I think it's all part of exploring. Sometimes you find junk and sometimes you find treasure. Are the people who don't pop useless cans assholes? Of course, but not everyone cares.
---
I am very powerful
---
Do you guys have any plans of further expansion into fountain?
---
holy shit dont make freighters ungankable they already have enough EHP
---
Hmm just seems like you made everything have a slightly easier time with fitting issues. Also, theres no cap application nerf towards subs so its really not changing the meta at all. Caps must not be able to hit frigs, they need sub support
---
Mission running and ratting is done solo, so no public channels for that. There are public channels for triglavian defense, though.
---
we are working on the small stuff en-mass first ;p. 
---
Trust me i know about all that.
---
These all seem to be random and irrelevant. Meaning I can say give the Cerberus 5% more cpu, but why? If your fit struggles, that‚Äôs why we have mods, rigs, implants, and boosters. Ask 100 players and they‚Äôll all want changes to different ships based on how they play.
---
bump the current ADM2 window by 1hour on each side.
---
bump the current ADM6 window by 30min on each side.
---
Your comment reminded me a lot of [this video](https://vimeo.com/67768281).
---
&gt; Thats not how this works. Without those skills literally no ship is  **where it needs to be**. They are fundamental skills absolutely required to  be able to pilot a ship **at a functional level**. 
---
Emphasis mine. Those are two subjective measurements. The tradeoff with the magic 14 is that they're useful for every (or nearly every) ship, but you can fly without them. This is obviously a tradeoff where we advise people to train them early, but newbies have much more standing between them and functionally piloted ships than just SP.
---
Butt pirate.

Gottem
---
Sell it on the character bazaar. You should get about 15bil for it.
---
You're definitely mistaken. Did you mean a smaller subset of the T1 modules like props?
---
GOKU/Stuka fleet comp are specifically designed to fight right under capitals.Fleet may go sideways sometimes but they are fully capable to stay on field and do damage which is far from "without any chance". like this Sedow's mom's fleet  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oe35LvEdTA&amp;t=1051s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oe35LvEdTA&amp;t=1051s)

Slasher desperately needs a PG buff so noobes can use it. At the moment it's so hard to fit a MSE. The merlin even gets 3 lows to fix that :)

&gt;All T2 Freighters +25% flat HP buff. +25 Cpu, +1 PG
---
Fuck. Right. Off.
---
If you get to the sites quicker, it won't be a problem
---
Most of it look like good iterative changes I can stand behind. Here are some specific comments mostly on those I have issues with.
---
4, 5, 6: Due to capital proliferation effectiveness of AOE doomsdays vs subcaps is cancerous atm. This is one good way to balance it.
---
8: Isn't bombing too far pushed out of meta? Even combined with the new rig, you'd make it a trade-off between warp speed and bomb application. Me and my constituents have a rigid stance on nerfing bombs further after defenders and capital proliferation.
---
21, 49: Jamming is really limited in use atm besides niche cases. Imho, the best way to fix jamming as is to make them tank ships. When you think of it, jamming is effectively a "taunt" mechanic now. Giving them HAC level tank might sound drastic, but might make them a valuable form of EWAR again. The iterative approach won't help in this case imho.
---
Most importantly;
---
119: New and improvement cyno jamming/capabilities are definitely needed. Giving the role to Marauders is a popular idea on reddit. But imho it is actually one of the worst ways to implement this. Think about case uses:
---
- Whaling Scenarios: Whaling is where I and my constituents believe new anti-cyno mechanics are the most needed. In the most popular forms of whaling, specialized tacklers tackle the ship and DPS ships "jump" on grid. Marauders aren't going to be the tacklers. They won't be able to "jump" (unless titan bridge, which in most whaling cases you don't have one). At most, they will be part of roaming fleets (at the expense of slowing the fleet warps down). In the majority of those cases, they wont land on grid and go bastion mode faster than a hunter/jumper-placed cyno inhib. If the target can notice a mobile inhib anchoring and cyno up, then it can notice a marauder warping in and cyno up. Moreover, it will be very hard to actually "roam" in marauders in places where you actually need counters to cyno inhibitors. So the only use case is when you are "roaming" in a fleet with battleships, and when the target kills the hunter-placed inhib, which should be a really really small portion of whaling scenarios. 
---
- Non-Whaling Scenarios: Be it in lowsec or nullsec, some might say anti-cyno capabilities are needed during gatecamp shenanigans, station games, etc etc. Generally, whoever wants to drop capitals on field will watch for the Marauders and drop the cyno a bit further. And the Marauders will either have to be out of bastion or immobilized, either way they can't "react" to the cyno positioning.
---
In a few very niche non-whaling cases I do admit the effect would help. Such as if you are in fact roaming lowsec etc in marauders, it will be hard for people to tackle/cyno/drop carriers on you on the same ship. 
---
But I'm worried that this will steer CCP away from an actual solution to whaling situations. [I have previously argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/) that this solution would be a mobile cyno inhib range buff (to over 400+) to prevent people from directly cynoing into intervention range of inhibbed grids. Plus an active mobile cyno shutter module for black ops battleships (single targeted, immobilizes the blops for a while, have 15 seconds spool up, shuts down active cynoes). 
---
I know this last module is outside the scope of your iterative "minimal effort" approach. But me and my constituents believe the cyno problem is one of the most important issues and does deserve some of that precious dev time immediately. We'd support the Marauder change in addition to the blops change, but not in place of it.
---
You're not wrong, but they shouldn't be mutually exclusive
---
Fuck Vily, fuck TEST, and fuck piggles.
---
But I like most of these changes. If CCP implements 12 of them I'll call that a win. Good fucking luck with that though.
---
Hmm just seems like he made everything have a slightly easier time with fitting issues. Also, theres no cap application nerf towards subs so its really not changing the meta at all. Caps must not be able to hit frigs, they need sub support

---
Maybe the way CCP wants us to fly ships like the scorpion isn't with 7 jams and a prop in the mids?
---
Something I've heard is there's a private discord where the big names in EVE can hang out, including the big FCs. They're all playing a fairly friendly game of chess and there's not a lot of hard feelings. Even Goons in that discord were in agreement with the famous "dock up your faction titans" thing last year.
---
Found the CODE guy
---
Cargo Scanners let you see whether there is anything of value / anything at all inside the containers before you waste time hacking them.
---
You're upset b/c they aren't wasting time to hack the empties? Because it cuts into your profits if they leave the empties behind?
---
Sounds like Exploration PvP at its finest. They're winning, you're not. =)
---
Here's an easy question for you. Why do people blueball each other in fights? Blueballing sucks for everyone involved. You're literally logging in to sit around and not do anything, just to force your enemies to also not do anything. Even if you end up frustrating the enemy, you're still wasting your own time while you could be having more fun in pretty much any other game. Why doesn't everyone just understand EVE is a game where the reward of victory can't be gained without the risk of a loss, and just choose to take every fight, all the time?  
---
Or think of it another way. If for some reason CCP decided tomorrow that you can no longer aggress another player unless you're carrying a month worth of plex in your cargo, which always disappears when you blow up, will this have a chilling effect on PVP? Theoretically people can just *choose* to accept that risk and keep taking fights like they used to. Surely there's nothing wrong with this. Right?  
---
I hope you can see now that not all risk vs reward scenarios are healthy for the game. Players are free to choose, yes, but they're free to choose "wrongly" if you incentivize them to it, as well as being free to get pissed off at you for offering them nothing but an array of bad choices. Not all risk vs reward scenarios are born equal. Consider faction modules. They're more expensive, but they usually offer better performance vs cheaper T2s. The risk here is losing more ISK, but the reward is increasing your combat performance immediately. It makes risking them in fights and pulling off wins against them more meaningful, but there's still the alternative, cheaper T2 modules, that also work almost as well if you don't want to risk that much. This is *good*. Players are free to play to their risk tolerance, while largely not being discouraged from taking part entirely. The same can be said for hardwires and pirate implants. They're like combat modules for your head. If you use them, you're better at fighting. It directly affects your performance in PVP, hence players are encouraged to risk them in PVP.  
---
The same isn't true for learning implants. Whether +0 or +5, they do nothing for your immediate fight. So it's pretty much like carrying a bundle of unlootable plex in your cargo. Players will very reasonably want to ditch this before going into battle, but they can only do it in a highly convoluted way, if at all, and at most roughly once a day. This kind of risk vs reward scenario is fucking stupid. Do players choose to fight with plex in their cargo, or do they choose to skip PVP in a PVP game? One of the choices directly disincentivizes PVP, while the other choice demands risking vast amounts of ISK for no performance payoff in the fight itself. *Every* choice is bad, and you as a player have no choice but to pick one.  
---
So yes, players are free to choose not to min-max SP dailies in highsec, or avoid fights on account of +5 implants, or blueball each other, or sit in golden coffins that get taken out once a year, or form giant titan blobs and max range carrier wrecking balls that set the servers on fire, or take part in any other number of unhealthy behaviors they nevertheless feel they need to do, even as they can see how it's sucking all of the joy out of the game. Countless players choose to do all of these things and more, because to them, CCP has created a scenario where the alternatives are even worse.  
---
The key takeaway is this. Players are free to choose, but they're not free to implement a better set of choices. That's up to CCP. At the end of the day, you're not owed anything in this game. If you want something, you have to work for it. This even applies at EVE's most abstract level to both players and to the company itself. Players aren't owed design decisions that make any sense, and CCP isn't owed player choices that will go the way they want. If players want a better game, they have to fight tooth and nail to show CCP their bottom line depends on making good and sensible design decisions. And if CCP wants players to behave more in the way they want, and become the kind of PVP risk takes that makes the game vibrant, then they have to actually design the game to encourage players to make those choices.

Have any of the incursion runners joined up with the Triglavian response fleets?
---
I'm not aware of any sites that directly mix the two, but keep in mind that each ore market is somewhat idiosyncratic. Moon goo compresses *terribly* (that is, not at all) and so markets are going to tend to be more localized. If you're mining in null, take a look around for your local moon goo buyers. I have no idea how that will work, but I bet there will be some sort of process you'll have to factor into your expected profits. If you're mining in w-space, same thing except there may not be a local buyer. If you're mining in highsec, then you probably want to think about how far you need to haul and whether you have access to local ore compression, as these will both affect your overhead in different ways for standard ore and moon goo. In that case you probably are selling to the market, and my recollection is that highsec moon goo just isn't worth mining to sell period.

no 25% hp buff fo freighters, but i can get behind making it so the freighters and JF can use DC. EVERY other ship in the game, bar none, has enough cpu and grid to fit 1.

CCP need to review all Caldari ECM ship. The last balance pretty much render them as taunting ships without tank.

it would be great if citadel anchoring distance was more than 1k from gates and other citadels. same goes for jump bridges they are like gates now people can jump back through even if they are pointed so FFS ANCHOR THEM OFF GRID FROM CITADELS.
---
&gt; Faction titans no longer have a 5x Entosis penalty  
---
Oh boy :)
---
It's so cute! 
---
Well done!
---
Why do you think its needed for a 20% reduced time for CONCORD, 25% more EHP and the ability to fit damage controls on JFs (hence the +25 cpu). In total this will approximately double the needed talos to gank a JF in a 0.5.

Please don't buff FAXes and Fortizar bombs
---
I probably ought to put "lock target" on my mouse, now I think of it... :)
---
They are balanced around not having DCs, I mean on one hand you're saying fuck increasing their EHP by 25%, but then you want them to have damage controls which does exactly that
---
Why the fuck did CCP decide to reduce the amount of incursions to 1?
---
Really awesome read. I wanna see some comparable stats on speed and distance.
---
1. Archon CPU increased by 15
---
1. Fitting is slightly gimped on CPU, would allow a little more variety. Bring it closer to other carriers.
---
2. Revelation CPU increased by 15
---
1. Almost all standard fittings are gimped on CPU requiring ANP‚Äôs to make normal fits work. This doesn‚Äôt even solve that but gives different options.
---
3. Wyvern/Aeon Fighter Bay default increased to 110,000 m3
---
1. Move to the same size as Hel and Nyx. Would make them ‚Äúalmost‚Äù as good as the other Supers. Would still be worse because damage bonus is greater than resist bonuses. But the Bay size really prevents these from even being in the same ballpark.
---
4. Bosonic Field Generator Signature Radius increased to 4000m
---
1. Half the effectiveness of Boson‚Äôs vs. Subs. Would be just as good vs. caps etc, but would make it harder to just boson away any non-mwd‚Äôing subfleet.
---
5. ALL SYCTHE DD Beam Radius increased to 4000m
---
1. Scyhe‚Äôs are currently basically useless because of the aiming difficulty and tightness of the beam. Increase the beam size slightly would alleviate this a little.
---
6. ALL Lance DD Beam Radius increased to 4000 m
---
1. Lances beam‚Äôs are too thin atm to be useful. Even a perfectly aimed lance is usually dodge able because the beam is so tight. 
---
7. Javelin Ammo Range penalty changed from 75% to 65%
---
1. Range penalty is too harsh. Makes it all but useless unless your sitting at zero speed at zero range on target.
---
8. All BOMB (Concussion etc.) Explosion Radius changed to 350m from 400m
---
1. Make bombs slightly more effective vs subcapitals. This would put slightly more power back in bombers.
---
9. Combat Scanner Probe increased to 22 base sensor strength (+2)
---
1. General QOL improvement for new players trying to scan. Would make it so you don‚Äôt need perfect skills with virtues to scan down some things.
---
10. Remote Sensor dampener effectiveness increased by 5%
---
1. RSD‚Äôs have been weakened too much. A 5% back up might slowly move them more towards usefulness. Might not be enough but slow push back.
---
11. Sensor Warfare Resistance on Titans changed from 80% to 75%
---
1. Simple minor nerf to titans.
---
12. Scorch tracking multiplier changed from 0.75 to 0.65
---
1. Scorch is way too good.
---
13. Optimal increased on Capital Hybrid Blasters by 10%
---
1. Moros needs this a lot more than the Erebus, but it would help make the Moros competitive. The Erebus really wouldn‚Äôt change much either way. 
---
14. Supercarrier Support Fighter Squadron Limit decreased to 1
---
1. Reduce the Dromi/Siren swarm by half from supers. Still Leave some utility.
---
15. Supercarrier Light Fighter Squadron Limit increased to 4
---
1. Give supers the ability to go more ‚Äúregular carrier mode‚Äù with either SS or Lights.
---
16. Increased Velocity of XL Torpedo‚Äôs by 15%
---
1. XL torpedos have been batshit bad for 10 years. Needed buff.
---
17. Beserker SW-900 Web Velocity increased to 25%
---
1. Been useless for years. Too slow, this will likely still make the irrelevant but I‚Äôd rather underbuff than overbuff something like this. 
---
18. Rapid Light Missile Launchers no longer counter as light weapons for Wolf Rayets
---
1. Broken in this class of WH. Easy simple fix.
---
19. Auguror Navy issue, +1 Mid-slot, -1 High-Slot
---
1. Make the ANI more competitive. The highslot is basically useless and an extra mid opens it up to all kinds of fleet options. 
---
20. Caracal Navy issue, +1 Mid-slot, -1 Low-slot
---
1. Shield Ships like this are always Mid choked. The CNI is as well. A low isn‚Äôt free by any means but would allow the ship a host of new options.
---
21. Griffin Navy issue, +1 Launcher Hardpoint
---
1. A second rocket Launcher would drastically change the way the ship brawls (it still wont be enough mind you) Rather underbuff than overbuff. I don‚Äôt really know how to fix this one without a full ecm change.
---
22. Base access difficult on Salvagers increased by 1%
---
1. Make salvaging more easy. Simple. It‚Äôs a shitty mechanic that takes too much time as is. 
---
23. Eris, +30 Cpu, +5 PG, +30 M/s Speed
---
1. Currently the worst interdictor. This would allow it to work as a prober or just highspeed tackler. 
---
24. Heretic, +10 Cpu, +50 Armor Hp
---
1. Bring it into line with others, the armor HP to allow it to get closer to a position where it might be able to take a hit and tank. 
---
25. Absolution base speed increased to 170m/s
---
1. Shit is soooo slow, Needs to not be a brick if its going to be the more mobile armor commandship. It‚Äôs a Dps role commandship where range matters. Its gonna end up plated anyways, but this just helps a little. 
---
26. Nighthawk receives +15 CPU, +10 Powergrid. +1 Mid Slot -1 Low Slot
---
1. Trying to make the nighthawk not shit. Needs the mid massively more than the low. Needs the PG/CPU to make things work especially if your upgrading the mid from a low.
---
27. Eos, Heavy Drone Speed &amp; Tracking Bonus increased to 10% per level
---
1. Make the Drone bonus slightly better. It‚Äôs still not good but gives it a really unique role bonus that‚Äôs actually interesting.
---
28. Drave Navy Issue, +30 Grid, +10 Cpu
---
1. DNI needs a little love, usually needs faction to fit things normally. Also gives it the hint of being able to use HAM‚Äôs.
---
29. Harbinger Navy Issue, Base Capacitor increased to 4200.0 GJ, PG increased by 30.
---
1. Cap hog, alleviates that a little. PG gives it just a hint of being able to fit something better. (underbuffing)
---
30. Deimos, +10 Cpu, + 50 Powergrid
---
1. Curently the worst of the fleet Hacs due to major fitting constraints. This wont solve that for the most part but might help enough to matter a little.
---

Yeah those losers are so risk averse. War totally risks their highsec assets while the rest of their assets... have no safety in jspace.....lol ok
---
How dare they game the shitty system designed whom the attackers are gaming themselves.
---
I use EvePanda on Android, but its usefulness is limited to tracking your skill queue(s).  I also use EvePI on Android, which gives alerts when extractors need restarting and such.  I use Neocomm II on an Apple tablet and it is the best app, but limited to Apple Ios.
---
fixed thanks
---
yup, fixed thanks.
---
Wait until you see Detorid and Wicked Creek.
---
So about that myrm in low sec. You have my card. Hit me up.
---
My constituents and I*
---
I would say probobly a destroyer  or maybe in between destroyer and cruiser
---
Test member talking about botters lmfao have you been to feyth or omist they‚Äôre the most blatant botting havens in the game
---
AI has finally stolen our jobs
---
added a bit to the poodemic post asking the same thing in a googledoc.
---
Would definitely show up to support pirates.
---
Now they doesn't.
---
He has a bot running doing non combative level 4 security mission in venal, atleast thats what it seemed like.
---
...too bad he was roughly using the same instant undock.
---
Edgy
---
Thanks, I'll take a look.
---
i just know that my 20 man enyo gang that catches a carrier dies to the two supers that drop to save it
---
Thanks for the heads up, I just reported PLA. Should be taken care of shortly üëç
---
Do we know when they are planning on releasing the update?
---
Wow.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever caught one of those ships.   I have two in my hangar for when I absolutely need to make sure I get somewhere.
---
i did up a short googledoc for one of the other posts.
---
Or fade? Or ( insert region here)
---
Idea... if the NPCs start fighting like this you get a marker like anomalies you see when you enter a system without scanning. Warp to it, choose a side. Get LP.
---
In low sec the flag would tag you so anouther player can shoot YOU to get LP from the other guys.
---
It's a sandbox. No changes are needed for nullsec wars. Look at the fraternity / test war as an example
---
lol
---
&gt; Sorry, but in 2019 EVE is a F2P game
---
repeating it doesn't make it true.
---
"hurr durr spodbrains hurr durr"
---
&gt;what possible end game that could possibly benefit you is there
---
they aren't giving rental income to 'the other guy'.
---
bots are going to bot regardless - may as well stop them using ill gotten gains to fund their enemies while ccp does their job and bans them.
---
All these changes are nothing without addressing TZ tanking. Make the CD to change your timezone to 6 months from one week.
---
I can understand the point you're trying to make. The game should implement systems in a way that incentivizes engaging gameplay and player interaction. I can get onboard with that. The problem you are going to have is that players have demonstrated that they will go to extreme measures to exploit the game mechanics as much as they can for maximum yield of their activity, no matter what it is. It's pretty much a given in Eve. That's why so much in this game is judged on ISK/hr. The playerbase has evolved to value the efficiency of an activity more than the actual enjoyment of it. I'm not so sure anything CCP can do can fix that. 
---
For example: The daily rewards were implemented. Rather than find a fun and engaging way to accomplish them and spawn some player engagement out of it, players figured out the most efficient way to do them and sat there bored to tears that it was terribly boring. 
---
If they were implemented as a reward for PvP, like some have suggested, do you think it would lead to players roaming for fights and gaining some extra SP while doing it, or do you think players will sit on an undock and shoot an alt? 
---
Programming can only take you so far, especially in a sandbox like Eve. The idea is to give the players the tools and allow them to mold their play experience as they see fit. You can adjust some overall parameters, but it's up to the players how they use it. You can't be too heavy-handed in your guidance of playstyle or it's not really a sandbox. You might as well be playing a theme park MMO. Regardless of how CCP changes the game, players make the choices, and right now most of the players you have left are too busy trying to maximize their gains than to have any kind of fun. Fun left with the casuals that the hardcore sperglords ran off. 
---
I started playing right as Eve was becoming huge and it was a wonderful game with so much to do and so many players to interact with. Lowsec was vibrant, Null was alive with many different alliances vying for power(arguably Goons and PL were the main powerhouses), wormholes had tons of activity and fights to be had, a world apart from the rest of New Eden. Yet as good as it was, it had a darker side. Eve was the wild west but it also was a haven for some of the shittiest players I had ever seen in gaming. IMO they played Eve because it was the one place they were allowed to act that way without fear of retribution due to CCPs hands-off approach. Any other game would have seen bans handed out left and right for that behavior. You had people getting doxxed, hunted down in real life for grudges held inside a video game, extensive game harassment from the likes of people like Erotica1, it was all just kind of off-putting. I watched as people complained endlessly about legitimate concerns, only to have their concerns fall on deaf hears and shouted down to the mantra of HTFU. Players got annoyed, activity declined, and there were less people wanting to go out to just do things and have fun and more people, that take the game entirely too serious, only wanting to do what they deemed worthy of their time and effort that would have some sort of perceived benefit. That was pretty much my breaking point, I quit. 
---
I keep up wit hthe activity and throw out some ideas from time to time, but they just get shouted down and downvoted most of the time. I guess internet spaceships is serious business.
---
I meant Beta Cuck.
---
Low effort r/all bait
---
You can't really rely on occupancy numbers to determine how many people are killed in Eve conflicts. A lot of the time you know a citadel is doomed before the first timer, giving baseliners plenty of time to evacuate the station before it pops. SH1 is probably at a small fraction of capacity by now, if not completely empty.
---
Nice to see we can't count on you to do anything meaningful...
---
whats a nighthawk
---
It's shit because of its speed. It has a respectable tank and decent dps out to 12km, the problem is it goes as fast as a plated cruiser.
---
!Unsubscribe
---
Where on the doll did the mean gankers touch you?
---
None of these changes would get me back to playing the game.
---
Doing % changes would have help retain the players 1-2 years ago... but getting these players back; not sure its remotely enough.
---
I want cyno changes, Citidel Changes (Stations were a place for content... citidels are not).  FAX Changes (the idea that the meta to deal with a single cheap FAX is bumping it for small gang is stupid), changes to local.  I want to when I jump into a system there is a not 10-100 structures (not helpful when you see a skiff on dscan and also 25 separate structures they can be on).
---
If one alliance owns the TCU (and is their capital), and the other the IHUB, how do their ADMs interact?
---
I know one you should start with.
---
/u/vily_r mind having a look at t1 gallent resist profile? The even kin/therm really poor compared when omni tanking with either running short trimark to plug the hole or running x3 adaptive and x1 explosive. I personally would like to see an extra 5-10% added to kin. Thoughts on this?
---
Dude... No... You basically just argued that someone is going to pollute the earth and it might as well be you so someone else doesn't get the chance.
---
If you consider both sides being brickwalled by 4am timers to be war, yeah enjoy lmao
---
These are just ship balancing focus suggestions. I fully agree with your comment overall.
---
What the heck?
---
jag definetly doesn't need buffs. Arguably nerfs.
---
Overall i agree. This is just hopefully one peice of a puzzle that MUST be put together.
---
ITT: Fucking Casuals
---
I use a glass bed and I've gotten some pretty solid settings. I made a second Niddy overnight and got most of the supports off fine, but I'm going to do a 45 degree angle version so supports won't be necessary for most of the ship. They should only connect the bottom, if I do it right.
---
This gave me a good laugh
---
One for my baby
---
It's just that traditionally jamming ships had shit tank (and DPS) because jamming WAS the tank. Now that jamming became a taunt mechanic, it makes less sense for these ships to have shit tank.
---
because for freighters its not that much (you can look at zkill and see how many freighters get ganked daily). For T2 Freighters i think they really should be HARD to gank. And like actually hard.
---
no, i argued the other 7bn people are going to pollute the planet and it's not my fucking job to stop them.
---
Move ecm to a high slot and double dps for the loss of a hard point?
---
got em
---
No, I'm pretty sure you're the only one who knows about it. You should do something to fix it.
---
It's likely the structure was mostly evacuated beginning after the fight over the shield timer finished, and it's likely a significant portion of the population moved out prior to that. Living in the main staging anchorage for a large alliance currently on the losing side of a war with another large alliance is not generally a good idea. So the baseliner occupancy figures are probably no more than a few million, mostly crewmembers manning the weapons on the structure and a skeleton crew in the dock areas standing by in case capsuleer vessels dock during the battle. A large portion of those can probably evacuate in the last moments before the station goes up, or ride out the explosion in hardened bunkers. So the actual casualty figures might not be more than a couple million or so.
---
Still a lot, by the standards of an individual, but a loss that barely registers in a cluster of [quintillions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c41bit/just_how_many_people_are_in_a_keepstar/ervqpsg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

running courier missions, i think

while the screenshot is really nothing special, I hope the experience was. It's always great to hear people having fun. It's a game after all.
---
astras would cost less to build than it would to anchor
---
Taking into account the fast that only two purposely-built organizations can do it now,  
---
is it too easy now?
---
i found it difficult to find fleets a few weeks ago when i got back into the game. i found wtm were still running but the 4 times i went into fleets they were small, low profit, and short lived. seems the incursion community is much, much smaller than it once was.
---
i think the triglavian stuff that came out that same week i came back also effected things
---
People think they want #120, but once its in play, they'll hate it.
---
I'd rather see bastion make you immune to being MJD'd by the dessies.
---
The last thing i really want is the capitals coming in 40km from me in a marauder, thats prime "Fuck you" range for dreads, and puts the carriers far enough out of range that you can't even threaten them (you can engage a single carrier in a marauder provided you can get on top of him).
---
This is going to be one of those "players asked for it and got it and now it sucks" things from a bunch of people that've never or rarely sat foot in one.  It might make a few fly them, then the dread jumps in at 40km and you can't get under his guns and you're a dead man.
---
Just janitors and marines left, I'd wager.
---
Wrong account fam
---
Pacifier is amazing for moving through chains fast. Scan quickly, warp even more quickly, potentially grab something if necessary. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's nice and super fun to fly.
---
Plus, the gas site blue loot in C3 is like 30m (except ordinary reservoirs, crappy spread out, no loot, turrets) so I‚Äôll just drop in, blast the sleepers and get loot. Then send in the Venture army.
---
&gt;114. CONCORD Response time increased by 20%. Concord shouldn‚Äôt be basically useless vs a prepared ganker. At least give people a chance.
---
Where does the line exist in your mind on this? People already have a chance to dramatically improve their survivability by not being AFK and by not hauling ridiculously expensive cargo. Do you want to require more Catalysts to kill an AFK autopiloting Charon?
---
TIL Drifters are really the PL of old.
---
why are you so defensive, calm down dude
---
I'm sure Shar will deliver when we recover from the trip home. :)
---
Maybe .... but you would be surprised how many ppl do it, and how good it can be.
---
I stopped doing it right before they introduced abyssal space, and the massive increase in deadspace loot value, back then i would average 1.5b/week in casual play. I've never lost a ship in almost a yr of doing this (CODE did try to gank my orthrus once, it didn't work out).
---
If i was serious about it, 3b+ / week was doable, and now it's probably even better, as deadspace 4-5/10 shot up in price.
---
Lots of older players were doing it, seeing gank tengu's or gank gila's farming Dens was not unusual.
---
or 50mn cavalry bubbles
---
Denying it doesn't make it not true
---
Sounds like you need to get out there and help defend the galaxy!

&gt;Drave Navy Issue, +30 Grid, +10 Cpu
---
This is how I can tell you're clueless (source: no1 dni corp, bff's with no1 dni pilot (who has more dni kills than your whole alliance), campaigned for dni buffs for years)
---
It's literally the strongest navy bc stop being stupid
---
Btw I
---
entire point of the porject is the server doesnt die or get overloaded to the point it has to slow down.   
---
the single user client experience wasnt the focus on the first one.
---
&gt;  Those are two subjective measurements.
---
The community decided over a decade ago that it wasn't.
---
Do you think the Keepstar staff get paid hazard duty pay in null sec?
---
Typical CJ wiener Allyn
---
CJ come on, stop getting jabaited.
---
Bots have figured how fleet fights work, time to call it quits boys.
---
A doomsday, 25 Kilotons of TNT ? Are you insane ? This thing eats capitals for breakfast and you're saying it's half the power of the Tsar Bomba ? 
---
Cool post idea, very very veeeeery wrong numbers.
---
People don't take kindly to hypocritical scumbags.
---
This is very useful. 
---
One note: If you're gonna push this, also look at neutralization fighters. They are awful levels of dogshit, even on an archon.
---
Where do I buy one?
---
I really need a good Hot Fuzz quote for this, but I can't find one :/
---
You think 45 talos for a bulkheaded JF as it is now is easy? JFs are literally unkillable if not retarded by cynoing. Normal freighters are also strong enough as is.
---
I have a feeling the ishtar isn't far behind.  Best thing they could've done would be drop a stasis tower in the sites and spawn fast webbing frigs on every wave.  Sig tank anom ratting would die right then and there.
---
Thanks for this valuable input
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
It's possible. It's not as though Keepstar staff pay is all that significant to us, probably on the order of \~100Mn ISK/yr in total per structure or so.
---
You keep being you, AutoMod. Never stop.
---
These are wallpaper quality. Thanks for sharing!
---
A standard Doomsday ends planets. R I P
---
Love this guy, what amazing comments from auto-mod. So philosophical.
---
I wish I could find the old article that kinda explained how wealth capsuleers are in game. Something like 1 isk being worth thousands to how we would see it and for us making 100,000 ISK is more than the average colony citizen would ever see.
---
Wtf, why would you tether a titan to a astra with no support? Isn‚Äôt a pos still a thing or are they completely removed already? Anyway, I wouldn‚Äôt complain about getting bumped in a titan on a astra with no support.
---
Of coarse they are mutually exclusive on one hand your talking 40 man hours plus test to edit database and run basic checks vs thousands of hours to rewrite whole section of code to change fundamental gameplay plus a tonn of hours of testing to ensure it functions, if it doesn't try again.  Cost wise one is achievable the other wont be achieved by a csm in a year
---
beep boop
---
Yep, pure shit.
---
At this point we almost really need 1hr despawn timers, this would give enough time to find, do the site and have it hang out for a bit without really leaving one to grind through 100s looking for something. Might also bring down t2 mod prices..... just a thought
---
A Jag nerf is what he was getting at. There is no arguably about it, anyone who undocks in a small gang capacity knows this ship is busted AF.
---
Since the comenter for this video is particularly bad and was just sitting on a citadel watching what was happening without any idea of what was going on, I decided to make a quick rough AAR of this fight from the Imperium perspective:
---
-Boat pings for Harpy fleet to get some content during off hours and his show.
---
-Fleet goes to BWF-ZZ since Boat was there earlier with a welp kitchen sink fleet and had fun. [(BR for this here)](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000186/201906242300/). On the way there we [kill an Orthus that thought he was safe to de-tether](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77466781/) from a structure while we were passing by.
---
-Get to Oijanen gate where PL still had a bit of a gatecamp
---
-Temporarily break up the camp, killing a few ships including a Machariel, but get chased off by returning PL Munnin fleet. While jumping to another system to avoid them, we somehow end up being sandwiched by another unrelated NC Munnin fleet. 
---
-Manage to avoid both with minimal casualties and head back into BWF. PH forms corms.
---
-A Warp/Boosh dance commences and both fleets try to get in their respective ranges for eachother. Some idiot that brought an Eagle to a Harpy fleet dies and a few straglers that weren't following Boat's directions (I can see why, he's very erratic at times) are bombed or killed by the carrier on the gate.
---
-Moment in vid happens, Harpies told to stay on the gate and get ready to jump since it was looking like we were going to be playing gate games. Corm fleet screws up warps in at zero, Boat screams to primary their bifrost and to scram him. 
---
-Bifrost gets scrammed and their boosh prevented. Harpies haze any Corms they can get their hands on. Almost got away with Boat's boosh at the end, but he was killed while spooling up by the remaining Corms and Carrier fighters.
---
-Since Boat was killed, and we were without a boosher, we decided it was op-success and headed home. Probably some of the most fun I've had in the past week. [BR for this fight](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002440/201906250000/)
---
Good fights on both sides. Would welp again.
---
I made that point abundantly clear back when they first posted the proposed changes.  Everyone agrees, except whoever thought it needed drones.
---
Vily very real question here. I appreciate your ambition however how do you hope to achieve even a small fraction of these when you have 5 brand new csm members also wanting to 'change the world' so to speak one of which will likely try n block you at every turn because you're from null?
---
True, it is not the job of the players to look out for and get rid of bots. When the stats on the amount of banned accounts came, and in the case of Mittens, he spoke about all of this. How NC. harvors botters and do not care anout getting rid of them. How goons (mainly because they do not live off rental income like NC.) wasn‚Äôt on the list. Regardless og much he was blurfing about it he turned around and starfed talking about doing exactly the same things as NC. to steal renters.
---
For some reason it is NC.‚Äôs job tot get rid of bots themselves. When goons do it, it‚Äôs fine since they just want to disrupt their enemies. Getting rid of botters are CCP‚Äôs problem. Not theirs.
---
1 ISK is stated in lore to be "enough money to keep a family fed, clothed, and housed in comfortable conditions for a year" (paraphrasing), which has to be the single most frustratingly nonspecific piece of lore in existence.
---
Hey Blade! Glad to see you are still kicking around! (An old corp member you mentored)
---
lol. how cute.
---
Hull tank navy mega.
---
Wait are you implying the nerfed the PvP attributes of the VNI?  Boy are you wrong.
---
Branch
---
Early train fitting/add on skills before jumping to a ship, pick a weapon and tank and try it on a gnosis then find a race that favors your final choice combo. SOCT ships (special edition) make great test beds for concepts.
---
Can it project it's full damage out past 3k anymore?
---
You are looking at it the completely wrong way.
---
Ur on the CSM??
---
in the end the t1 resists must be balanced. If you gain elsewhere you must lose somewhere.
---
Look at the cutie up front puttin' out the vibe.
---
well those two supers would now have to chose between dromi's or sirens in the above.
---
Realistically there would be quite a few as far as afk/Mia members im sure,
---
Ok, from my perspective I can run 3 t1 vexors that do exactly or damn near the same damage as the new vni.  The only appreciable difference is the rep bonus,  which I actually love.  I dont think it needs it unless it's forced into blaster range though.  Which it now is.
---
yes much too easy.
---
while everyone else spins ships in stations waiting for something to happen, the guy on the far right is busy using his time wisely by bench pressing buses as a side hobby
---
so the super should just die to your enyo gang then?
---
Because they don't play their own game.
---
i semi-agree. But thats the thing, aside from "have an e-cyno and be 100% awake at all times" there is no counter to 45 Talos. and that ofc ignores that the vast majority of JF's die to 25 of them because they still have to do their primary function which is hauling cargo.
---
I said some shit, not a blanket censorship, which they already do btw. Read the EULA. If for instance they prevented all botting somehow and didn't let us say 'fuck sand monkeys' I'd say that's a fair trade off. One saves the game from bots that will destroy it over time while only hurting your 'freedoms', (that you don't actually have in the game) the other saves every snowflake their precious emotions in an internet spaceships game and kills it with fake sensitivity. 
---
It was a rhetorical situation anyway because it won't happen. I was trying to make a point about the real problems facing the game while incorporating it into the thread's context.  That must be too hard for some people to understand though.
---
by leading change.
---
its not the fear of a losmail its not being stupid i know some people who will engage anything but most of the guys i know will not feed there ships to a fleet they have very little chance of getting even a single kill against, dying is not the end of the world doing so pointlessly is just feeding the blob
---
Right but that doesn't answer the question, when your sat in a board room with mid tier devo who are tell you their ideas and competing against 9 others who'd rather have their voices heard, what makes you the one who's going to achieve the goal over them
---
I agree.  I think it‚Äôs less CCP game design and more human sociology inside the sandbox that unless ccp deliberately attempts to circumvent will persist.  
---
If ccp decides to remove in-game standings tools, outside development will fill the need.  Because the people want it. 
---
If ccp decides to somehow limit by mechanics the numbers of systems an alliance can hold at any given time, you‚Äôll just have more and more administrative holding alliances knitted together with the players all inside one operating alliance.  
---
If ccp decides null sec is too safe and removes/modifies local to create more unknown, the players will develop adaptive intel systems and build this in their already complicated out of game intel networks.  
---
All of what we have now are simply products of basic human social behavior (the self identification of a group based on a set of real or perceived ideals) and the intended mechanics of the sandbox.  Ccp intends on alliances holding wide swaths of sov.  They intend to make it hard to conquer space.  Much of what makes the mega coalitions so entrenched exist to help the smaller alliances protect their space and grow within it.
---
Yeah holyshit did they buff it in small gang/fw, it's gonna be a great active armor brawler now. It's also better at blitzing deds now.
---
What?
---
ya i sorta agree i put that one in as kind of a fun finisher but its received more negative points than most. I think it might be a fun mechanic but not something i think is hard worth fighting for.
---
For myself? Running into the wall of an Abyss site because I didn't read up on it properly...  
---
And then this other thing, where as FC I accidentally got a fleet member Concordokken'd when I told him to test something, and he forgot to have his safety on green. Good times.
---
So you want there to be no counter to 65 talos instead?
---
It's war. It's not meant to be enjoyable.
---
Buy a 3d Printer or SoE models? lol
---
5 Plex? Wow wtf
---
Without Ov3rdose I am just doing my best to post against their narrative.
---
\^ This dude probably jerks off to a poster of Ayn Rand
---
yes actually.
---
We‚Äôre not saying it‚Äôs not human nature or It‚Äôs the wrong way to play this game.
---
We‚Äôre just saying this situation is simply unfun and needs lots of change cuz game is meant to be fun.
---
I know there will be some guys that love capital proliferation, blue doughnut and n+1 fights blah blah...
---
but I think we know It‚Äôs ending because of serenity.
---
basically ya. I just think the bar to being ganked is too low. Its too free. AFK JF? load up 20 Talos and kill him is too free to me. A DCU alone would give that alot. I don't think they need the 20% HP necessarily as well, but definetly i think the bar is too low.
---
Didn't we just have this discussion? Like, less than a week ago?
---
Presence and Experience. You want me to say "i can't get it done" but i have before and hope I can again.
---
crazy isn't it.
---
why? because i don't work on team security?
---
awesome! I'm happy to hear about it. None of these are my final opinion, they are starting points. Why do you think the change would be bad? What would you suggest?
---
Hello griffin navy issue? literally the most useless ship in the game. how the fuck you can not fix that after how many months its been since the ECM changes idk... fucking retarded
---
i don't think he ever said it was their job to get rid of renters - just that their narrative of "goons are botters" was proven to be bullshit.
---
you're welcome to link a clip of him saying it was their job to police botters, i don't mind being proven wrong if you have evidence.
---
griffin navy issue is slightly less useful than the widow, at least the widow can do respectable damage compared to other blops (even though blops in general are fucking trash compared to much cheaper carriers), at least its entire existence wasn't a gimmick based around 1v1ing others and jamming them at blaster range lmfao
---
Is this because you feel highsec should be safer than it is? Or is there some other reason you feel concord should be buffed? What about the impact to low sec status pilots?
---
Short of some fitting and slot changes (vargur is perfect, kronos +1 mid/-1 low, probably tinker with cpu and pg to adjust to fitting differences, Golem -1 low +1 mid with more pg and cpu cause holy shit is it a pain in the ass to fit, god knows what the paladin needs, application mostly), honestly bastion negating booshing is really the thing most needing looked at for marauders.  Rest of your list is at least breathing some freedom into the meta.
---
Thets not first bunch of VLY kills in Venal, [https://zkillboard.com/related/30001291/201906240600/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001291/201906240600/) this is second corp what i see in Venal, [https://zkillboard.com/related/30001291/201906080400/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001291/201906080400/) . And one from Fountain [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004621/201906091800/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004621/201906091800/)
---
It could be done in a lighter way. PSO2 has emergency missions that every player is made aware of
---
He isn‚Äôt saying he‚Äôs only going to do things on this list and nothing else
---
I guess we can just agree to disagree then. Ganking has seen constant nerfs over the years which has pushed almost every other group out. This has has lead to only one active freighter ganking group remaining which I run in GSF and a couple large multiboxers in CODE. Thankfully, I suspect the GSF reps have quite different opinions about this topic than you do. However, I appreciate many of your other opinions. Have a good term!
---
ya, it might get added on my second round at this.
---
Truthfully I want you to succeed but I suspect we'll look back at this in a year and see a deleted post and no changes to the 120+ items you've listed, but goodluck all the same
---
Olemca and Exooki made up 2 of my top 4.
---
I was only referring to low-sec. Im not sure how concord "responds" in lowsec.
---
And ya i think highsec should be a little safer than it is. Its quite common to see people getting ganked "for fun". I don't think highsec ganking should be removed but i don't think it should be as free as it has been and continues to get.
---
your correct. I tried to pick a large swath of ships in eve that i thought had a variety of issues and push them into a viable role or closer to it. I personally feel the cerb is already in one and actually put a part of the HML thing in with cerbs as a thought among others. 
---
100 players would come up with a hundred diffferent ideas. I'm one long time player coming up with one big list that hopefully can provide a little something for everyone and work towards a slight shakeup of the balance.
---
I honestly think that JB/Jammers are mostly fine on forts and down. Its on the Keepstars that it feels insanely oppresive to me.
---
Not to mention emergency bulkheads and airlocks down corridors to preserve as much life as possible. 
---
But this opens up nightmare fuel. Imagine being one of hundreds of thousands of survivors after a Keepstar goes down. You're stranded in a chunk of the citidel hoping that SOE send rescue soon. Broadcasting a distress signal on a broadband frequency. 
---
Then you hear it. A scraping, ripping sound. At first you think its rescuers breaking through debris to save you. Then you see one of the walls of your corridor start to glow, and disintegrate. First micro fractures open up. Then the cabin explosively decompresses. The last thing you see as you boil and freeze at the same time is a Horde cormorant savaging what's left of your former home.
---
That's a good point. Perhaps i'm giving CCP too much credit as to what they think we should be doing.
---
How much does a each piece cost and is it worth to buy the printer if i want the models?
---
Dps is a part of the whole. You're glossing over the time and resources put into scanning, bumping, looting, etc. I get that you disagree with the current state but at least be cognizant of the moving parts, loosely similar to the various moving parts of alliance level intel, coordination, recon, etc. I also get that's it's an off the cuff wish list so I'm sure a grain of salt is worthwhile.
---
Have fun with Merk, remind him to breathe occasionally.
---
20% increase to concord response time. So you'd need more boys but it would still be doable.
---
I was thinking of playing again but my ISK bank was kinda low when I last stopped. I don't have a super to join some null sec crab corp so I'm curious what the best ISK options are these days? I used to run FW missions or plex back in the day never really did much lvl 4's and never tried incursion or any of that type of stuff..  Is my best option to stick with the FW missions for Caldari or something being they own the war zone at the moment? Is selling SP still a viable option? (plexes seem crazy price so I assume no but I had skilled a few alts back in the day to to start selling injectors but never actually started)
---
take ye olde nail file and sand off those edges and imperfections then get paintin!

Recons 1-3 more like.

123 bad ideas.
---
Ur dad
---
\&gt;  Griffin Navy issue, +1 Launcher Hardpoint   
---
you are a fucking retard that is not the issue with the GNI
---
Like anyone in frat knows how to spot a bad idea
---
ya i'm quite aware. I don't know how to fix this one without a big change.
---
thanks grath, when i put together the next revision of this list ill take a deeper look into the marauders. I honestly have very little expereince with them.
---
We'll see, without a full flight of sentries or heavies (both if you use a mobile depot) I think it's blitzing days are over.  Sansha 6/10 needs around 600dps in EM to break the boss reps.  Solo Stratios cant do it with 4 heavies, unless you ignore its huge armor resist bonus and go max dps shield fit.  Hybrids being kin/therm locked will keep the guns from being very helpful 85%+ resists except in em.  Not to mention that site runners usually fit a remote rep, probe launcher, dla, and a neut in case they're caught.  We'll see about the pvp changes too.  I predict we will see it getting smoked by things that run and hide from a current vni.  I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.
---
The exe navy would've loved that rep bonus though...  just say'n.
---
I feel sometimes it is people who have stopped playing Eve who make those posts thought :/
---
The game is working as intended but I do agree with 1 thing people have been saying, that capitals are too many and too common. Besides that it is fine, we all have fun still :D
---
If we had to be either pro-change or pro-new content... I'd be for new content. You can never have enough ships in a space game. I'd rather see new tech1 ships that mix things up. Like an armor tanking Caldari drone ship with lasers. No reason why new ships have to be bigger tech. Just find new and interesting ways to release more ships for each class. I think recons and HACs are the most fun... give us more.
---
i think the scientific term would be "a bunch"
---
Ganking is a balancing factor to haulers in highsec. I'm uneasy using my (jump) freighters, because I know I could get ganked, so I use my transport ship or blockade runner wherever possible. When I do use my (jump) freighters, I'm alert and usually bring a webbing alt and/or out cyno and avoid ganking systems. If ganking got nerfed, I'd never do anything but autopilot my freighter while at work every day, which removes not only the gameplay of the gankers, but also the conscious choices I have to make to make the risk managable. Just like unsupported capitals *should* be vulnerable, so should unsupported freighters.  
---
I love this game not because I can dick over other people, but because other people can dick over me, and I have to stay one step ahead.
---
Well, to be fair, adding a DC *does* use up a low slot where a flat HP buff doesn't.
---
I'm extremely adept at dying in them.
---
Depends on the bot. I'm guessing there are a lot of different coders responsible for this plaque, not just one.
---
But in theory if you were to put a neutral toon in every system, they'd have to adjust them to ignore known campers. The only other option would be to quit, and that's not likely to happen.
---
Poor wiener J,
---
USTZ Providence moral must be low.
---
And people downvote when I say hypothetically some censorship is an okay trade off for no bots.
---
Don't forget to report!
---
Mining and rating bots are bad enough and now ccp is making pvp bots? This is the last straw time to find my pitchfork and riot! 
---
/s
---
Why do you want to increase CONCORD response time? It would make it impossible to gank even a venture
---
And no numbers were given.  Thanks for the story, MassivelyOP/CCP.  I'll file that in the folder for shit I want my time back for.
---
The story moved on.
---
Sansha are caught up in a struggle of some kind with the Triglavians, along with the Drifters, Rogue Drones and Sleepers. It's still playing out, and the Triglavians in the meantime are invading known-space from their Abyssal strongholds, while being countered by capsuleer forces.
---
As a consequence of the struggle, Sansha and Drifter activity has taken a nosedive, and rather than go with the flow, seemingly-entitled players are whining about all the isk they're missing out on, as if the old story was supposed to hang around for ever.
---
That's a rough summary.
---
The have shields and armor, no structure, break through the shields and you trigger the sub capital fitted green beam of fuck you that pretty much kills what it hits.
---
They prowl wormhole space, when you find one in a pipe, you avoid it because its insanely fast, has great point range, and is extremely aggressive.  AFAIK it might use the new rat AI as well, which makes it mean AF.
---
I didn't know there was an LGBT pride rally happening in London.
---
I almost think that he's casting a wide net to claim involvement
---
As a wormholer, I'm guilty of mashing D-Scan. Yes, it's paranoid. But I don't want to be backstabbed.
---
I think there're 2 distinct uses of marauder cyno inhibition: one where marauder protects itself from cyno drops while doing marauder things, and one where you bring marauder as you need something against cynos.
---
For marauder protecting itself range needs to be way higher, at least 70-100k, preferably 150k-200k so that standard cap gun dreads do not kill it right after jumping in.
---
As "something against cynos" it will not work as marauder by its nature is very slow. You inherit main flaw of inhib - it takes a time to deploy while cyno is instant, and marauder takes more time to come onto grid and bastion up. Especially since you cannot put too much into its mobility as it has to have decent tank, so implants/rigs will be used for that.
---
For marauders I'd rather see something which would turn them into go-to PvE ships - special module like MTU but which tractors but also salvages (automatically!) and some mad anti-NPC dmg bonus while bastioned, like +100-200%. This way you have expensive ships which is effective in its area, catchable and tanky, thus giving some food to roaming entities which will most likely provoke fights around them.
---
Check your pm. :)
---
"Buff everything"   everyone get happy
---
And?  
---
Your post contains no question nor suggestion.  
---
Therefore it's just a rant.
---
Do you just burn lead paint chips and hope for spirit visions from the fumes. Some of these are pants on head retarded.
---
overtime at your day job
---
Wars of attrition are not fun to fight. This creates a fundamental imbalance between attackers and defenders.
---
some very interesting ideas, i remember suggesting the 1 support fighter only on supers last year, I'd also remove support fighters on regular carriers altogether
---
This is just about every region in EVE aside from Delve, Esoteria,  Fountain, and Geminate (not including the RIP in the Vale/Tribute). Of course every other region I didn't list isn't 100% bots, but you can find them in the rest. Period Basis, Branch, and most of the drone lands (especially you Cobalt Edge with the 4x Rattlers every system) is ridiculous and just downright sad.
---
selling sp will always be profitable, just maybe not worth the effort.
---
Why would that be shocking? 1998 was smack in the middle of golden age of gaming.
---
It's not like coding shit like that is hard. It's that most devs are too fucking bad to even think about it or too fucking preoccupied with making the game "accessible" to put it in.
---
Excuse me, it's "SortDragon" not "Sort Dragon".
---
"SortDragon" is property of Sort Dragon's ex-wife.
---
Thats most of null tbh
---
What does censorship have to do with bots and how would it prevent them? Not trying to be combative I genuinely have no idea what you're talking about.
---
So then what's the point of it?  I assume you can get a fleet together to still kill them, but what do they drop?
---
Just show her This is EVE
---
More diamond rats with the new AI, please!
---
The fact its been going on for so many years without action from CCP means that they have no interest in this game's survival.. bad news for actual players that make this game and community
---
Look, I can tell you exactly why people rant about eve being broken: CCP focusing on empire building &gt; Null bloc life becoming more appealing &gt; Other playstyles lose players because they cannot keep up &gt; "Most players play the nullbloc game, we should focus more on nullblocs then."
---
It's a loop that slowly eliminates all other playstyles.
---
Without trying to sound facetious, have you been high sec ganking recently? To kill an unfit Orca takes around 18-20 characters to do everything perfectly in fleet from set-up to pulling CONCORD.
---
Even then, all that Orca has to do to not get ganked in that situation is to look at local, stay aligned and warp away when CODE. or any other known ganker enters grid. Or, hell, add some tank and you increase the numbers needed to ~25.
---
High Sec is safe. Your changes just mean that no mistake can ever be punished and that is not in the spirit of the game in my opinion.
---
you really havn't been keeping up have you?
---
&gt; Its quite common to see people getting ganked "for fun". 
---
local man fails to understand pvp is fun, more at 11
---
A formal diagnosis somewhere on the autism spectrum?
---
I recommend you pick whatever race you like the most, as you'll eventually train into every races' ships and weapons. Alphas might be restricted to their own race though, I'm not sure. Other than that, it really does not matter at all, so just pick what you like the most.
---
make EVE  be self-nerfing. The more kills a ship gets, the more shit it becomes.
---
&gt; How NC. harvors botters and do not care anout getting rid of them.
---
B0T bro here, if you know of any bots in Malpais or what's left of The Spire please report them and mail Imfakenews ingame. We take botting quite seriously and don't tolerate it.
---
(Can't speak for other Northern rental properties). (Imfakenews likes it if you include a limerick when you mail him, popular subjects are how NC. is better than TEST or about how Pantsufam is awesome).

The people making those posts are the ones who spent the better part of a decade dropping their supers on smaller entities that had no hope of fighting back. They then failed to adapt to a changing meta and have been surpassed by those formerly weak entities, who are now shitting in their mouth. Suddenly, capital proliferation is a real big problem.
---
I agree that caps should be a smaller part of warfare, but it's real hard to take these guys seriously when they complain about the very thing they did for years.
---
And there will be a new one in a week or two
---
Add an Omen Navy Issue +1 Mid &amp; -1 Low.

And I'm all ears.

i don 't want to fit sebo's to ships either, but i am not going to blame a game mechanic for my laziness.

The claim was ' pretty much anything t1 cruiser and down you can take '.

But now you jump in with ' Wtf kind of logic is just looking at caldari '.
---
WTF kind of logic is that? :)
---
This guy posts so much hilarious shit on Reddit.
---
Ive been playing longer and more in a lot more ways than probably everyone respinding or even coming up with some half assed comment. No. No. No. No to all of these. Get implants, increase skills, get friends in fleets, or dont fly it. There is a huge reason its not one or 2 cpu different for most of this stuff and everything else is where it is as well. How about you stop botting. How about that?
---
It's so sad as I come back from a 3 year break to see the game worse off than it was when I left (and it was in a bad state when I left).

Oh wow there's a button right there. Wew what a mystery
---
Must be 75 km off from gate to boson.
---
Confirmed. It's all I use mine for :(
---
No focus, just random values thrown out with little detail (even in the doc). 
---
The CNI still cant fit anything with +1 mid and -1 low. Its dps will also suffer with a loss in low with no damage buffs to its trait.
---
All the faction battleships dont need HP buffs, theyre already competitive to pirate in EHP values. While some could use fitting, almost all need trait changes. Like the tempest FI going the way of the HFI and getting a tracking and damage (or rof bonus). The navy geddon is a useless turd after abaddon buffs. Fitting and 1k extra armor wont change it still being a useless turd. Getting an armor HP bonus and damage bonus while moving a high to a mid and dropping a turret would make it unique and bring in line with the aug navy.
---
Torpedo launchers need an 8-10% fitting reduction (which also opens up fitting on the RNI and every other torpedo battleship) and torpedoes need base range set to 30km. Application should be unchanged, they apply fine when fitting for it or having support.
---
Everything listed seems to have no reasoning (navy griffin +1 launcher? Wat? Its hybrid bonused) or foundation in rebalancing ships within their classes to focus on roles. Just random stat changes that dont effect the underlying issues.
---
Join Test
---
Your a moron then and it shows that you have never ganked anything in your life, please don't try to fix parts of the game that you don't play, ccp are good enough at that.
---
Obviously if you fit an anti Hecate Caracal complete with AB and neuts you‚Äôll win. No point in testing that. 
---
The point is, normal fit Caracals don‚Äôt use either of those, so a Hecate can beat them
---
Hardwar was a unique outlier, even in 1998. 
---
The closest equivalent that I can name was Ultima Online's (1997) attempt at a dynamic ecology ([which had to be scrapped almost immediately once the players got ahold of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFNxJVTJleE)). 
---
The industry standard and stereotype was - and still is today - for NPCs to be "dumb agents," spawned as entertainment or decorum for the player's benefit. This was the case for Elite, Wing Commander: Privateer, Freelancer, "X", Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout, and EVE. 
---
Our EVE NPCs up to now were "dumb" not out of laziness or incompetence, but because that is just how NPCs were done in the games industry. 
---
Game accessibility has nothing to do with this. If you want to blame anyone, blame Interplay Productions and Gremlin Interactive for barely marketing Hardwar and driving its sales into the ground. Had it been commercially successful, perhaps the games industry would have taken notice of its unique approach to AI.

Damm shame too. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs my favorite looking ship, except for maybe the Tiamat.

And here I am just wanting all battleships to have a cargohold like the Praxis does.
---
Nothing. I brought up a purely hypothetical situation where I would be okay with limited censorship, that being the removal of all bots. It was obviously a fake scenario to show my support for free speech. Some asshats who can't read took it literally and cried about rights and shit.
---
Role bonus: Jammed ships can't target you
---
This also explains why passive income (moons, rent) is bad
---
Doing numberchanges shake the meta up and keeps the game from stagnating. Ccp will never ever achieve perfect balance and they shouldn't aim for that. Just dont forget the balance patches so we don't get Svipul for a year.
---
Its basically just swapping values in a database

I will disagree on the nighthawk. It still hold a pretty good place is high class pulsars.

---
The problem is, the non-bots would have to adjust as well and worst case the bot pilot will just move somewhere else (different null or even high sec), while the real pilots either have to group up, leaving a lot of systems empty or join a group big enough to have an active defense force most of the time

&gt;If we had to be either pro-change or pro-new content... I'd be for new content. 
---
Why? So we can have more ships that no one uses? There's only 4 titans in the game and only 2 of them really see any use, because shield titans are garbage.
---
Feroxes are the only useful mainline battlecruiser because none of the others can compete. When was the last time anyone used a zealot?
---
Adding new shit for the sake of adding new shit just takes away from fixing the shit we already have to make them worthwhile. I'd prefer that all of the ships we had were actually used before adding  new shit that will either not be used or just push out the stuff we have. 
---
&gt;I think recons and HACs are the most fun... give us more.
---
No one flies most of the ones we have. Who uses vagabonds or Sacs? They are garbage ships that are outclasssed by other things.
---
You sound like a genuine grade asshole.
---
Selling sp is just about at the break even point now, you won‚Äôt make a decent amount without doing PI on them. 
---
For isk, idk how good lvl 4 missions are but exploration in good space is 100-150 mil/hr once you get the hang of it. VNI ratting (soon to be replaced with Domi ratting after the nerf) is good if you want semi-afk isk
---
Hate to say it, but perhaps we need to make warping an active task. Not just click and warp away... maybe something to control during warp?
---
So you stirred shit by bringing up a topic that people have very stong opinions on even though it has no relation to botting in any way. Got the the reaction that was obviously going to happen and now are trying to play the victim trying to get sympathy points for it?
---
You spel TROLL with 2 L's.
---
They need to lay siege to jita.
---
Honestly, I'd like to see equivalent figures for a few different points along the way, before deciding just how much we're supposed to panic about it.  What was the new user retention curve like in 2005, 2010, 2015?
---
I should specify that by mentioning habitability I was going to address that there shouldn't be a situation when someone can settle down, never having to move out. Now I see it was misleading.
---
What I meant is basically a null region with "narrow" gates that get "wider" as and resources there getting more abundant time goes on, but eventually (after enough time for political and territorial processes to settle down) gets closed making way for another such region.
---
Basically, a null that has artificially prolonged "moving in, settling down" period and limited lifetime (but not minutes like Abyss sites, rather months/years). Kinda in style of The Doomed City by Strugatsky brothers - it isn't hospitable enough (you can't just move all your shit from other regions at once), you aren't always on the move there, you settle down, but you must move out sooner or later.
---
Honestly, the idea has tons of weak points. I was just trying to latch onto another fellow's idea about making something that could somewhat simulate the era of EVE's establishment when you didn't get to use whatever you want from the get go because it wasn't built.
---
Looks like a lot of powercreep in general. Not sure what the point is. When it comes to fixing things, the problem seems to be CCPs reluctance rather than lack of ideas.
---
I could probably support most of these, but buffing EW ships and increasing concord response time are just very bad for the game as they cause people to avoid certain ships or systems. 
---
Things like cynos and why battleships are bad arent addressed. The main issue BSs have is that they either cant hit or dont do enough damage. A BS might die to a kiting frig unless MJD. Increasing the tank does basically nothing as you die when blobbed anyway.
---
You think some small mechanic change will turn a chore into fun? Completely reasonable expectation.
---
Bots do exploration, super ratting, and project discovery. They can figure out pretty much anything if you give them time
---
Exploration, VNI (domi in a few months) ratting, moon mining. Last two require you to join one of the nullsec alliances, though
---
You don't see the problem . Goons never see their large numbers as a problem. Just push a little more. People are quitting in good numbers. Personally I want to watch it all burns and shutdown.
---
They already do
---
Botting.
---
Then the two people shoot at each other? If you're on opposite sides of a conflict that's what you do normally. If capsuleers rocked up to an empire battle I'd expect it to be a shit show and both fleets would definitely target the space gods.
---
People quit, and a vocal minority scream on reddit the hypocrisy is amazing because while PL and NC had the power in their hands did you see them fighting on reddit about too many, never. But downvote it all now get the pitch fork becausr the game is dead
---
Ill remind you there is a forum post from 2003 letting us know that eve is dead and won't last the year,  and every year since there has equally been someone screaming the same narrative..
---
There's no upper limit to the amount of NPCs a faction could spawn short of crashing the server. I'd put my money on the 3k officer dreads that rock up. The tidi fest would be real, but rats wouldn't care.
---
drifter goo afaik.  used in making shit
---
I'm not too familiar with using supers, but i'm curious why limit the number of support fighters? Is it due to sirens or something else? I agree that sirens can be a pain in the butt, but I would really like to see more usage of the other support fighters. As in - i would love to see more variety on the field and more importantly the need for mixing of different capitals and fighters, to get the most out of it. I see it was partially done with Chimera and Archon buffs. Otherwise nowadays people just say it to train for nid/hel or thanny/nyx, everything else sucks.
---
Imho its the same story as with drones - you use either combat drones or ec-300s (they did nerf them though) all the other drones don't get used apart from maybe like kitchen sink roams and fun fleets.
---
You really want to use 2 dreads to stay sane.     One week of sites will generally pay your investment costs. C5s in a good region.can net up to 30b per month, depending on spawn rates etc. If you factored in mining, gas, pi and all that other stuff you could maybe do 40, depending on how far on the spectrum you are. Check it out on sisi and dive in, most people never look back.

While also having an additional light fighter squad? I am not sure that's a good idea.  
---
What about moving the fighter layout to a module?  
---
This would remove the "one tool fits all" a bit and could even open up heavy fighters for non-supers (heavy fighter launch bays possible to fit, but if you do, you can only have two fighter squads)
---
vov.... taxes.
---
you clearly have never been to Cobalt Edge
---
&gt; "has no obligation to accept on csm regardless of votes" pretty wrong, playerbase would be very mad.
---
Well, most of it probably doesn't even know CSM exists, half of the rest is already mad because the other half are goons and their representation. Not the worst situation to work with, if we imagine that CCP management thinks goon representation is problematic and dreams of getting rid of it. Which it doesn't but w/e.
---
&gt; I never said goons were only where they were because of csm influence, but you know they will lobby against changes that fuck goons over, even if its good for the game.
---
Maybe they will, maybe sometimes not, as evidenced by some of their guys raising their issues with rorq defenses.
---
In practice though CCP often ignores arguments against their proposals already. It seems to me that they were in slash-and-burn mode for quite a while already.
---
&gt; You are really just restating my points and agreeing, but saying that well goons would win anyway so who cares if csm is irrelevant.
---
Actually, I was just saying that your initial argument was beating about the bush while in reality was very obviously geared towards political goals and built around current specific situation. That reminded me of those classic EVE-O threads presenting some seemingly elaborate idea presented with a lot and lot of words, but in reality was nothing more than another "make those guys stop deccing me" or "stop my hisec freighter from exploding". Which would be more convincing if they weren't trying to pretend they are something else.
---
That's basically the only thing I was going to point out at first because personally I don't care very much about the rest of stuff we are discussing.
---
Figure out an action only a human can do and implement that during warp. Not hard to understand.

yes, absolutley lol

If World War Bee taught us anything it's that Goon line members do not fare well under pressure.
---
Figure out an action only a human can do and implement that during a warp. Not hard to understand. Seems like you don't care to find a solution.
---
You wouldn't, thats the problem. In order to remove poses, ccp has to change things so that it is *mechanically* safe to tether a titan to an astra.
---
Lol. Yep, any time you want to warp, you have to solve a captcha. That sounds like a great idea
---
Don't forget about how cargo also should add mass
---
strategic index (from ihub persistence) affects system adm the same way ratting and mining activity affect system adm - that is to say, the game doesn't care who's doing the activity, only that it's happening in the system
---
overall system adm affects both tcu and ihub equally
---
the only real down side of not having your own ihub in a system is that it makes it slightly difficult to install and online/offline upgrades if you have to contact someone from a different alliance to do it

It's the combination of the Domi (45% web) and the Siren that's oppressive. Especially since fighters use missile mechanics so their damage goes up proportionally with how slow you are.
---
Ahh, so it also removes the domi + siren combo when engaging on smaller fighters? That sounds good.
---
Gas and Exploration
---
Lmao this is such bullshit, vid proof of you having 0 velocity and dying like retards please.

Vagabonds were used all the time in PvP before... until guess what? New ships came out. Fixing the ships we have now makes zero sense unless they are clearly overpowered. All ships are usuable in small fleet roams and that is where this game is excells. There's nothing better than a properly setup fleet of diverse ships.

Any screenies of it?
---
Honestly how are you catching them? I've never managed even with an instalocker.
---
Eh, having to bring at least some sort of subcaps to fight smallest ships in the game which are generally pretty limited in what they can do already, is it really that bad of an idea?
---
You said that... not me. That only shows how you can't think clearly and just want to troll your Debbie Downer attitude that nothing can be down about bots.
---
He‚Äôs saying 1 damage is equivalent to a hand grenade... but that seems low, but possibly reasonable. 
---
A civilian gatling pulse laser does base 3em and 2 thermal damage per cycle at the cost of 1 gj. 
---
A small shield booster 1 regenerates 26hp for 20gj of energy. A gj of energy is 0.17 of a barrel of oil or about 7gallons of gas. 
---
1 stick of dynamite releases about 1mj
---
1 ton of dynamite would be 4.18 gj, 1 gj is about a 1/4 ton of dynamite
---
The gistum medium a-type shield booster converts energy at a 4-1 ratio, meaning that at 80% efficiency 1 hp is about .2 gj of energy(this leaves room for ship/pilot skills/etc optimizations)
---
5hp then holds about 1 gj of energy, which can also be burned by a laser shooting 5 damage with 1 gj. 
---
Scaling up, a titan can have up to approximately 30 million ehp, or 6 mil gj of defence. That is 6 pj of defence.
---
Hiroshima released about 6000gj‚Äôs of energy, meaning a well tanked titan could tank 100 perfectly applicated hiroshimas at once
---
Note, This was done on mobile, I apologize for convenient numbers, approximations, and any uncaught bad maths.
---
I would like to agree, but it seems like at least capitals don't work that way. We just had a system where the ihub was just taken and thus had an 18h window, despite it being the capital TCU (of a different alliance)
---
It's an interesting idea. I think there are some good starter ideas.
---
There's a sort of common response to getting cloaky camped which is what you're suggesting.
---
The botter will whitelist the camping character(s). This means the bots will ignore it in local. The idea being, you're gonna be afk most of the time anyway, the bots will make enough to pay for 3 vnis by the time you come back from dinner and blow it up.
---
The botter will move to another system or rent from another group. Usually done after having too many whitelisted characters, or feeding way too much.
---
The problem is that you're putting all this effort into some cheap trash vni, gila, or dominix kills 99% of the time. It's just not worthwhile.
---
I like how someone reported bots in an alliance controlled region and best defence is to point out the mess in other regions. Eve is dead. Numbers are extremely low, and take in consideration that now we have Alpha clones, Chinese joined server, etc.

I posted something much smaller a long time ago where I compared the DDD to a Hiroshima blast. It was then said that this was just to activate the weapon, it would not be what the actual yield was, but no numbers for that yield were offered.
---
A Hiroshima-sized blast from a DDD is more like a boop to the snoot. I‚Äôm actually not impressed. It‚Äôs not nothing, mind, but it‚Äôs not world ending. At 600 meters fro ground zero concrete buildings survived in Hiroshima. Armor plating on titans is 25000 mm, that‚Äôs 25 *meters* of steel. That‚Äôs going to absorb a very great deal of damage, even if directly hit.
---
What this piece does not bother to attempt is to contextualise the output of the most powerful weapon in New Eden with the fact that this weapon is used on a ship with a Faster Than Light drive. The amount of energy required to move a ship faster than light would dwarf a weapon in the yield range of the first nuclear weapons used against actual targets. On top of that titans are also able to open an Einstein-Rosen bridge such that ships can make an instantaneous point-to-point transfer to a destination lightyears away. The energy required to curb the spacetime continuum such that a wormhole opens through which ships can pass instantaneously to another point in the universe makes the energy released by the weapon, per this piece, a rounding error compared the energies used to move the ship and to create a wormhole.
---
A DDD is basically a sloppy French kiss compared to activating the warp drive.
---
I may be wrong, but didn¬¥t the last adjustment to new characters include the skills to use all different kinds of T1 eWar, propmods and almost every module that you might need for PVE and PVP in a T1 Frig of your characters race?
---
&lt;Hedliner&gt; WHERE ARE MY NUMBERS! GET IN THE FUCKING FLEET!!!
---
...yea... IRC was awesome...
---
How about having to avoid warp collision by stabilizing your ship or you'll blow to bits? Simple mouse gestures in certain areas... or that too much for you to handle?
---
There's a reason that I tend to prefer EUTZ and AUTZ fleets, when I can manage them...
---
It's 8am and I haven't had tea yet, that wasn't happening for at least another couple of hours ... Thanks for the link though!
---
Nice eve related post
---
This is not balance , this is buff everything and remove fitting nuances. Although there are some ok buffs that might remain balanced, the fact you think 120 things can be buffed with breaking 240 other things is worrying.
---
Make HK Great Again üòÇ
---
If you increase explosion radius of bombs they apply worse. You guys might wanna check that if you think that's a buff.
---
Didn't realise 73 was a structure rig my bad. I never deal with those.
---
Thats exactly what I did to print mine a while ago, have done it with a lot of models, the stratios is one that needs it, in general al SoE ships due to the ring. Without a resine printer, I doubt there is another way without a ton of support and a general bad result
---
Sure right after a manufacturing minigame where you need to simulate a hammer while producing stuff.
---
he means that a freighter will get killed whilst empty, for no reason other than the enjoyment of the gankers, to wit there should be a cost more than just 100m in destroyers, its a billion isk ship, which alot of new players are drawn to only to find that 1. the courier market is 90% scams outside of 2 different orgs and 2. gigantic freighters are stupidly vulnerable.
---
lists sometimes don't have indexes.
---
This reminds me of the list of the only two hard problems in computing:
---
nameing things
---
cache consistency
---
off by one errors
---
and when indexes start at zero
---
stick to eve politics
---
Oh, ok.
---
All BOMB (Concussion etc.) Explosion Radius changed to 350m from 400m
---
It was reduced, not increased.
---
Can you use combat recon ships as an alpha?

When playing solo (1 vs gang), a lone brawler will be just a food for a gangs. Kiting is an only way to counter all those guys bringing a kitsune, a couple of comets, worm and a garmur to a novice plex =)

---
IME EUTZ tends to be pretty cancerous too. You get a lot of people bringing up American politics without actually understanding jack about it. AUTZ tends to be pretty chill.

I just wish everyone would shut the fuck up about politics and play the damn game. I come to EVE to escape the idiots and the pundits, not directly interact with them all over again.
---
I‚Äôm digging what it‚Äôs sitting on. I guess it‚Äôs sandpaper, but with it blurred it bit it gives the ship a cool space background of some kind.
---
/u/vily_R
---
First I'd like to ask for your process to figuring out all of these numbers &amp; what not, cause from my perspective it really seems rather random.
---
I'd like an explanation for each change to first explain why its needed, and how the change you propose makes the ship more / less overpowered / more balanced with its peers.
---
2nd You haven't even mentioned Ferox / Munins weapon systems????????
---
3rd #111 is a good troll, showing that either all of this is just randomly smashed together to look intelligent, or you really just don't know. Cause you claim sotiyo pirate loot is 60k currently, which is false.
---
I think Marauders should also receive a very minor lock range bump across the board and a cargo capacity increase (in line with the buffs T1 BS got.)
---
Aha, and you can buy a whole fleet of frigates for that price. It does not work like this in this game.
---
Cool. Thanks for the answer!
---
No, it should probably be a deadlock.
---
The post talks about how much worse it will be when people will start dropping 40 km away from you because they have to. But they can already drop 40 km away if they want to?
---
You're right, I haven't seen bots there. A lot of empty space though :(
---
Triglavians in Jita would be awesome! Therefore CCP will never do it, lol.
---
The counter to 45 talos is not getting caught by 45 talos. The freighter could scout, and jfs go point to point jumping in 100% safety.
---
FW agents
---
So wait you want basic immunity for afk piloting? Who are you and what did you do to Vily?
---
Any mechanical task is better accomplished by a machine than by human, provided it is familiar with one. It's basically always a matter of time before such measures will start hurting real players over bots.
---
That is an angry potato. Not a spess ship. You can tell by the grumpy face.
---
All this crying over NC/PL from like 10 years ago is getting old. Really? You mad over shit they did a decade ago? Damn this game can't shit itself fast enough
---
Massive ships designed only for hauling are incredibly vulnerable to piracy if not accompanied by defense ships? Well that's completely unrealistic and doesn't mirror real life at al... Oh wait youre retarded.
---
yeah....PLEX combat is so cool! Specially when you're in a Militia and get not only a sec-penalty when engaging neutrals/pirates but also a standing penalty when those neutrals/pirates are in an NPC corporation!  
---
So much fun!  
---
Oh, and did I mention the WCS frigates all around the warzone. Yes, they can't enter the novice, small and medium sizes anymore but well...there are still those lovely large plexes, who give even more LP than a medium at the same time investment. Isn't this great?  
---
And all the citadells! Oh those lovely citadells, our own private cities in the stars. Stations and Docking rights? we don't need them. Just place a citadel in a system of your choice. It's all content! It's not about warzone domination by conquering systems and gaining influence for your faction, it's just about having three or more citadells in all system.  
---
Also nice to see all my gud friends from 0.0 who come to lowsec to find real-man pvp in their blingy ships. Most of them are already dead when the leave the safety of their 0.0-umbrella.
---
Oh and did I already mention the encouraging words from different CCPs like "It's not on the actual roadmap but don't hesitate to collect some of your ideas (like the last 5 years)" or just leaving a FWpanel, because of "...having important things ongoing outside."(sic!)
---
Luckily training into that too!
---
Gay jokes in 2019. Must be rough to be you.
---
No, Vily is.
---
heheh whoops someone didn't agree with me lets r/woooosh them to make them feel dumb hehehehe
---
I agree entirely, this all seems like a "lets randomly throw shit at a wall" of ideas.
---
And ofc the sotiyo loot proposal is HILARIOUS :D
---
They're like lambs to the slaughter, the instawarp undock seems to be a new addition, i watched a load of guys camp an undock with some remote sebo'd ships and just pop them one after another. I thought someone was killboard padding at first they were killing that many.
---
Always tell someone with a solid argument if they start insulting someone for no reason, it a damn surprise that there is any room left in our oceans from all these defense vessels following the thousands of freighters about constantly...
---
Paladin needs some tracking love, for sure. Not as much as a nightmare (7.5% per Amarr BS) but maybe a 5% per Marauders level. Right now it tracks like a fucking Oracle.
---
I remember jokingly spurring you on to level 2000 over a year ago.
---
I'm so sorry.
---
Piracy was becoming an issue recently off the coast of some African nations so ships started to get navy escorts. v0v
---
Its a pity there wasn't some sort of police department who based out of perimeter in a fancy faction fortizar who could help mop this one up. Oh wait...
---
Yup, some, not at all the majority. The point is. That high sec hauling is a fairly common way point for newer players, and it's both ridiculously unsafe and barely worth it most of the time
---
 I'm not saying ganking should be impossible I just think it should be harder, the freighter pilot loses their ship, cargo and collateral if they are on a contract all for the low low price of some destroyers, the balance isn't right.
---
You mean like hacking? No one complains about that. LOL.
---
I get your frustration with people prioritizing ISK/hr to an extreme extent. Not that this matters, but I don't think players are to blame for this. They only act like ISK is important because CCP created a game where ISK *is* important. If we all had infinite ISK tomorrow, suddenly nobody would care about it anymore, and we'd all be bartering with each other using veldspar or exotic dancers. ISK represents player effort. Player effort is what makes EVE "real." ISK/hr being important is what makes this game both great and terrible. EVE is real because the ships players field, in battles to contest territory that players have settled, are all representations of real human effort. But that same factor also encourages people to min-max their effort vs ISK, and minimize losing the results of their effort. You can't have one without the other.   
---
So seen from one perspective, the playerbase cared too much about min-maxing SP, and shoehorned themselves into a corner doing stupid, boring stuff to min-max dailies. And that's true. But seen from another, CCP already knows they created a game where people really care about ISK equivalent SP. Despite this, they then added a system where the easiest way to get SP is by doing really stupid, boring stuff. And predictably, some players went and did this stupid stuff to the detriment of their own fun, while others griped about being "punished" for not wanting to do stupid stuff. CCP then wrings their hands as if the whole thing was a giant mystery that no one could have foreseen. Is it the players' fault for caring too much about ISK, or is it CCP's fault for knowing this but then going ahead and introducing dailies anyway? Maybe there's enough blame to spread around, but being the designers of the game, I still think CCP are the ones who are ultimately responsible for giving players the right incentives, or at least not introducing the wrong ones.  
---
Sometimes that means knowing your limits and being brave enough to say no to a bad idea. Is it possible to program SP for kills in a way that makes sense, given player tendency to min-max everything? No? Then don't do it. That's not to say there's nothing that can be done to encourage PVP and still keep it meaningful. Blowing up a bling fit enemy ship with top end combat implants is still meaningful. So let's make learning implants work like boosters, or better yet, just chuck the attribute system out the window and make SP gain a set rate, with a first month training bonus and a much higher extraction limit. People still have plenty of risk to contemplate when it comes to blingy ships and implants, but now nobody will feel discouraged at going into a firefight with +5s. Like I mentioned earlier, the special event pirate sites were often good in the way they created a space that encouraged players to come together and fight, while also limiting what they could bring to that fight. That kind of design is the sandbox at its best. Players didn't have to fight over training boosters, but they were encouraged to, so they did, and PVP happened organically in ways that wouldn't have otherwise. At the same time, there were also rules in place in terms of ship size that made sure players couldn't min-max their way to the detriment of their own fun.  
---
As a fellow bittervet, I've given a lot of thought to the idea of EVE being a sandbox, and my own disenchantment with the game came when I finally understood just how many players failed to realize that its unique nature is as much due to the box as it is the sand. Unbreakable rules, coded by CCP, determine what can and can't be done in this game, and the extent of shitty behavior is a direct consequence of those rules. The rules say you cannot take actions to effectively deter and *punish* bad actors, so bad actors will keep being bad actors on account of their failures being of basically no consequence. The rewards for their actions are massive, but the risks are almost always nil. So people will keep ganking, spying, stealing, and harassing until the end of time. A real sandbox would let players be the hand of retribution, and let the powerful enforce their own rules, *whatever* they may be. But in EVE it's disproportionately harder to be the bringer of righteous vengeance than it is to be the psychopathic dickhead. Once you realize just how deliberately limiting the sandbox is, the whole idea suddenly starts to lose its luster.  
---
I can talk about this stuff all day, but I think I've blabbed enough already, so I'll just leave it here.
---
Nah, he doesn't, he's constantly docking and undocking in K3J so he definitely isn't pulling burners
---
But there are already pretty easy ways to avoid it. Just looking at the map and avoiding systems where ganking is obviously occurring is a big one.
---
Randomized and logic based tasks are not. I'm simply offering ideas and I have yet to hear any other suggestions than just negative feedback. I can tear down anyone but not offering a solution is worse. I never said my ideas are perfect, but the concept stays the same. Bots rule because they don't have to perform human based tasks. What do you suggest?
---
mate didnt you see?
---
&gt;Bellicose +1 Mid, -1 Low
---
eve is saved
---
but for real, the navy battleship changes alone are just 'uuh lets just add ehp okay'
---
this is all so fucking dumb, a few of the things make a bit of sense but a lot of ships just have random fitting added to them
---
just why
---
Even very small number change can effect greatly.
---
For example, some number change on mobile cyno inhibitor. Now, we can volley cyno inhib even under FAX repair. Imagine cyno inhib gets resist, more buffer and shorter anchor time. It will shift meta or strat a lot.
---
In my opinion being able to fit mwd + mjd and actual tackle would already fix a lot. (not disagreeing with bastion negating booshing though)
---
First thing i'd do would be -1 utility high +1 mid for armor marauders and pull shield marauder fitting out of the dumpster.
---
It's worded badly here.
---
I also read increased from 350 to 400 first instead of reduced to 350 from 400.
---
I will fit a mwd and have all launchers in high slots.
---
Like I said - I'll even start at 0.
---
You get all the advantages. Including the better ship :)
---
Without a web I would say it's not great. You might get away with rage vs destroyers but against other frigates you are looking at a loss 
---
 of about 30% DPS (in which case you would want to be loading faction).
---
What printer and resolution you printing at?
---
yeah cool, explain to me how to get out of the forge/citadel (the main trading and production area) to any other place without going through N or U... its almost like you have never done any freighter hauling and are just crying because 0 effort ganking might not be as stupidly easy as it is now.
---
cargo delivery and recon i d guess
---
&gt;Remote Sensor dampener effectiveness increased by 5%
---
&gt;Vigilant, Falloff Bonus changed to Optimal Range bonus.
---
Damps are already ridiculously strong and so is the rail vigilant. Barrage change would be good but I think more ac ships need falloff bonus as well. How about battleship exclusive/grid intensive tracking comps/enhancers? Recons need a role bonus for reduced fitting and/or extra range on medium guns, and maybe some capacitor love.
---
Ummm... clearly there are flaws in this game. First of all, skill injectors completely take out the time and effort and prestige we used to have and that you claim exists. Get rid of these.
---
Second, bots, botting, afk ratting, afk cloaking... all horrible concepts for ANY game...  especially this one. Humans need to be playing for their effort, risk, and rewards. Otherwise, wtf? 
---
Fix these issues and then I'll agree Eve is not broken.
---
If you look at his responses to other comments on this post, he says he wants to make ganking harder as you shouldn't be able to gank things 'for fun'.
---
Considering this is a game, I presume he means either a) you aren't playing correctly unless you are treating EVE like a full-time job or b) you shouldn't be able to gank.
---
Damn it!
---
Do you like money? They like money.
---
You are misreading his (poorly explained, admittedly) post. Read his Google Doc. He says he wants to make ganking harder.
---
Happened to me
---
Good luck.
---
Oh lol, its under describe account, fucks sake I thought it was a photoshop
---
I may have gotten a bit lucky in that regard with my particular group and the SIGs that I roll with.
---
We do have one FC that's partisan to the point you can tell their political affiliation from their fleet names.  I just vote with my feet on those, and sit those out on principle.
---
Moon aint passive for a long time.
---
are you having a stroke?
---
1,5b a week is pretty meh tho considering you can do so much more in a 200mil stratios in FW
---
why are you complaining here??? Just report them to CCP.
---
1-2, cargo delivery. The recon 3 has too much DPS
---
This is a video game . . . If it's not enjoyable then there's a problem.
---
Well dann!
---
It's already borderline OP if we weren't living in a capital/drekavac infested meta
---
Wrong that is called braincells, It is not my first prediction on developement of economic metas. I tend to be right  ...
---
You indeed got a quite large koolaid bottle you zippin off ...
---
I think it's even more amazing that there's someone actively in EAK/DT.
---
it's really awful this time of year..
---
bots online is real for years and CCP doesn't care.
---
Why should a battleship apply to a frigate?
---
* Consume Impetus-Potency-75 standing booster
---
* Sit on station with multiple L4 agents
---
* Cherrypick for "Cargo Delivery" and "Recon" 1-3
---
* Missions only include scout area/grab cargo, no combat
---
* Yachts are nullified --&gt; be quite safe and make dank LP shop ISK
---
You're so bored that you need to look at NPC kills because you're not engeable enough to kill player spaceships ?
---
You have to find their undock instawarp spot, there they have to realign
---
&gt;I, for one  
---
This guy counts in 9th century B.C.
---
IXth century if you please!
---
Impetus Poteny 75 makes it possible, otherwise you would need shitloads of pullers
---
capital systems are supposed to be staging systems, which are a bit harder to grind adms in. it's useful to have them, although they are a bit macguffiny I agree
---
can't use an ishtar on an alpha account. the vni nerf was targeted at alpha bots, any other ships you might use (ishtar, gila, etc) either can't be used by alphas or aren't as good at a much higher price
---
are substantially more expensive and not nearly as good (~500 dps vs ~700 on a vni

CCP listening to vily's list of ideas.
---
CCP office after reading this : 
---
I would figuratively literally kill someone for an extra midslot on a paladin.
---
Triumfidelas
---
It really depends on what you want in the game.  Gameplay wise, starting race doesn't affect anything significant.  It affects like 2 hours worth of starter skills and some basic standings, but anything can be crosstrained.
---
I'd suggest changing #9 to "Increase all base scan probe strengths by 10%" since combats being better than cores for scanning signatures would be confusing and to keep sisters and RSS probes relevant. Or +2 to all combats and +4 to all cores
---
Yeah, two nights ago I was shooting at a retribution about 60km away with scorch. I had tracking computer with trackin speed script and a tracking enhancer in the low slots. Couldn't hit it until I took a strong drop booster. Pally needs some love. Almost no one uses it for pvp, and those that do, are more for memes.
---
Go away.
---
enjoy your dead game
---
Cool. IDC.
---
I just checked zkill and almost no freighters got ganked all week
---
maybe you should check zkill?
---
I definitely dont like all of these changes, but i am glad you are going out there and telling us WHAT you want to do.
---
And actually giving a shit about balance.
---
I'm surprised leadership hasn't taken action on that, TBH. Seems like politicising your fleets is a great way to ensure nobody wants to fly with you.
---
You scout yourself through it and use a Web alt to instawarp? Its almost like there are simple solutions to these issues that people are too fucking lazy to bother with.
---
Alphas can not use T2 med drones anymore. Either faction or 'integrated' ones.
---
Yup that is how I deal with moving high value cargo, however no one should be forced into creating an alt just to play a very basic part of the game. By that same logic the changes to freighter HP and fitting would just means you have to roll another 5 or so alts in order to gank it, so really, your own dumbass argument back at you
---
I agree with the first part, however since the ceptor nerf the taranis is basically useless and even with dual webs the hecate doesn't have range control on a lot of stuff due to its terrible base speed.
---
As a chimera pilot I appeove of this message
---
There is a counter to 45 taloses. Get a permit vily.
---
This is some amazing spin if I've ever seen it 'we didnt lose the zone, we just denied content to an extreme so we won'
---
This
---
Posted by a Dino, unsurprisingly.
---
How do you know
---
Nobody IS forced to create an alt. This is a multiplayer game. Get someone to scout for you.
---
On the other hand whywshould 1 person in a freighter be safe from 25 - 30 dudes trying to kill him?
---
yes
---
He‚Äôs pissed off the servers can‚Äôt hold their mud either. Ha
---
Agree with a lot of these, only a few i'd say fuck no to.
---
hes refering to the NPC's that moved out there for a new life in the adds that CCP made for the introduction of citadels
---
Good job :)
---
RMT.
---
A combination of your flair and your [zkill](https://zkillboard.com/character/92471206/).
---
Because they spent 1bn isk on a ship with no ability to fight back, it should be hard to kill, if you were fielding 1bn worth of ships to kill it then fair enough but normally its closer to 1/4 of the isk on field from the attackers side, and I know you shouldn't balance around isk but that does seem a tad stupid does it not?
---
Yeah i mean but the ships would still be thereunder likely manned
---
lots of text for so little actual content...
---
..you don't seem to understand the whole issue
---
Right so if I spend 40bil on a titan people should have to use 40bil of ships to kill me?
---
the right points but for the wrong reasons
---
&gt; lists sometimes don't have indexes.
---
Lists sometimes don't have *explicit* indexes. The first item is always the first item.

---
hmmmm, I might need to reconsider my eve-career choices
---
Stop just ignoring the bits of my comments which don't line up with what you want. I ready said that balancing by isk isn't a good idea and shouldn't be done. But freighters should still be slightly harder to kill, there is a reason this topic comes up every now and then. Ganking high value cargo go for it, but to be able to just gank an empty freighter for the lolz and no really take that much of a financial hit is bullshit and you know it is

Should i start talking like i use to or should i "ask" to X how can i adapt to the situation ? And more importantly, how do you even ask something like that ?

Come on. I'm almost disappointed.
---
&gt; a) you aren't playing correctly unless you are treating EVE like a full-time job
---
Considering his EVE vocation, I'm willing to bet someone lost perspective on what level of organizational hurdles is considered "easy" or "for fun" by most people.
---
&gt; Rant over, let us all get back to playing this lovely game and fly safe! 
---
playing bots online in 2019 and writing walls of text about it. fking loser
---
IF I would RMT, that would be the way -.- .....
---
Props for Boat bringing the content last night, no bullshit timers just two fun fights.
---
Was fun seeing his fleet jump i00 and finding our two returning strat-op fleets. Only two guys fucked up and agressed.
---
And props to that guy that brought us a eagle, I understand why though. Boat only told you guy 4 or 5 times what ships to bring haha. That ship was worth more then all our corms.
---
Gf
---
&gt; The last thing you see as you boil and freeze at the same time is a Horde cormorant savaging what's left of your former home.  
---
Absolutely beautiful.
---
That‚Äôs too safe IMO, there‚Äôs keepstars already. You‚Äôre kinda safe if you tether on a fort and make a decent safe (unless enemy fleet spawn caps near titan and pushes it off). You get 150km tether bubble and a 60sec safe log. If you‚Äôre not soloing, fort defenses are extremely good vs capitals. If played correctly, the risk vs reward is balanced.
---
I disagree with any changes to stop ships from being bumped when tethered. It‚Äôs too risk adverse.
---
&gt; Randomized and logic based tasks are not.
---
If we are talking about simple bots written by 3rd grade students then maybe. Otherwise as long as different iterations of said task are anything alike, it will eventually be solved.
---
&gt; What do you suggest?
---
For starters, stop delegating this "battle" to playerbase. And yes, I am including any sort of test like the one you are suggesting here because it will be users who will have to go through extra effort to ensure game can tell them from bots.
---
Second, arguably more important thing: worry about something else until CCP who, you know, owns the game, stops siding with bots in this conflict for their owners' sub money.
---
If you want real solution, you need a game that is pointless to bot, but then it means the only thing of worth in it is leisure time you have playing it. And that won't be EVE that plays with concepts of wealth, achievement, effort...
---
Thats an insightful comment youve just made. Nowadays we see a lot of other spaces being contaminated by nullsec tropism, FEDUP's switch being a good example of this push to remain competitive.
---
&gt;Sotiyo pirate loot container changed to 100k m3 from 60k m3
---
Iffy on this. On one hand, a poorly secured system means an easy steal by cloaked DSTs. On the other, securing the grid from cloaked DSTs should kind of be part of the job of the group running the thing.
---
&gt;Beserker SW-900 Web Velocity increased to 25%
---
This is neat but won't do shit because the drones aren't fast enough to catch the targets they're trying to web, and there's almost no reason to ever use ewar drones in place of dps drones. Certain ships need exclusive ewar-only drone bays - those that might not normally get drone bays in particular.
---
&gt;Base access difficult on Salvagers increased by 1%
---
What exactly does this accomplish? Explain please?
---
A lot of these other ones aren't really my expertise so I won't put any weight on them. Hopefully others can and will.
---
"hi, are you severely autistic or just slightly?"

Rmt? What's that mean

I know, but there are a lot of people who want passive moon income back.

Can you still use a Micro Jump Drive Unit under scram? What about under bubble?

make low sec great again :)
---
If you look in the channels, there's a mission running channel. It's one of those ones CCP create and is available to everybody. Last time I checked, there actually was a fairly good number of players.

I'm one week away and I miss all the good shit...
---
&gt; IF I would RMT, that would be the way -.- .....

This is one of the ways they've specifically mentioned watching for, and one that is *very* easy to detect.
---
I do not recommend RMTing, and I especially don't RMTing this way :)

That's amazing, I wish we could see the statistics on the battle and how it went down.

NP, that all really helps, without all that your ship will be sluggish, and fitting and defence on any ship will be bad. Really just get it all up to LVL 3 first, then you can determine what to train up next based on what you are doing.
---
&gt; It's not like coding shit like that is hard.
---
I mean, Dwarf Fortress exists, and is made by basically one guy unless you count all sorts of graphical shells and the like. Aye, it was released much later IIRC, but man does it kick ass when it comes to detailed world simulation, even if resulting world is all kinds of weird.
---
More of them would die if it wasn't for most stations in venal being straight in line with a gate.
---
Depending on how narrow the training you want, you could train up the character to the level of skills that you want, and then start SP farming after that. For example, a decent scanner can be had for around 30 days of training, and after that you can start SP farming. 
---
You could also train the required amount of skills on an alpha, then train that alpha to 5 million skillpoints, but that means it will take 6 months before you will be able to use it alongside your main character. Depending on what it is, it can be viable.

maybe the crew get assets saftied out :D
---
I use Sunesis in Lowsec, 1.6 sec align
---
&gt; It also raises the interesting question, what if two people show up on the opposite side of the conflict show up?
---
This being EVE, it sure can handle that rather organically unless it's possible to game the situation in some way. On the other hand, if you want this to be strictly PvE, something will have to be done, yeah.
---
Yeah, this whole thing looks like a Tumblr-style "uwu mental illness so kawaii" thing rather than an actual look at what mental illness is and why it's so devastating for the people that struggle with it.
---
This is r/eve, the answer is always going to be "severely".
---
Actually would make a certain sense, however would station staff also then evacuate? Like if the life on the ships can leave last second and be asset safetied away, wouldn't the keepstar populace jump aboard as a final f this noise im out with you guys
---
cool fights, cool video :) good job guys!
---
&gt; Should i start talking like i use to or should i "ask" to X how can i adapt to the situation ? 
---
There's no simple answer. You could easily take being forewarned of it as a helpful warning. But the person telling you could just be a dick. 
---
&gt;And more importantly, how do you even ask something like that ?
---
Without being shy about it. 
---
"Hey, I've been told you're on the spectrum. Let me know if you need me to do - or avoid - anything in particular."

How about we agree to a compromise, and start all lists and arrays with index INT_MIN
---
Oh ok thanks.
---
Simple Farmers may still be bots.
---
If they have 90b lying around in their wallet they can probably make it back easily. Yeet the rich.
---
That depends on which NPC faction we are talking about. Some NPCs, like those that defend shipyards, spawn proportionally to attacking forces and that's about it AFAIK. Other NPCs, like more persistent WH drifters, tend to accumulate, but spawn in limited numbers as a part of specific event. Those will not have endless reinforcements, I think.
---
Ugh this is so satisfying to watch.
---
Neat game
---
Taking screenshots and videos of a bash. Eve 2019
---
Thanks!
---
Well they can already rat and mine... maybe they are just building up their infrastructure at the moment and keeping their 'heads' down. And then one day they will attack in a massive first strike against us! It isn't like they'll need to do beg pings for people to login and join fleet.
---
&gt; Sotiyo pirate loot container changed to 100k m3 from 60k m3
---
Well you must understand, null players demand loot &amp; payment being deposited directly into their hangars when they've done any pve ;)
---
I agree its their job to secure the grid if they wish to avoid people stealing their shit. (I should know cuz I'm the reason for this change request).
---
Could have been worse, BCE.
---
If it wasn't because most of these changes has no reasoning behind them (and if there is I'd love to see it).
---
Just think the time you spent writing this horrible post could've been spent killing bots The^more^you^know^!
---
Aight you got me, i'm a hobbyist level i ain't got the best practices.
---
Not exactly their fault its just a bash
---
Thank you very much CCP\_Falcon.  
---
I know you guys record them all I just could not find it yet on twitch that why I asked :) looking forward to the video
---
It's a shame that nobody cares other than goons.
---
Yes my post included anti goon changes, because if you haven't noticed the game is dying and goons are part of the problem (and every other null bloc too). If you aren't against changing the nullsec meta, which means nerfing goons, then you are either a goon or a retard, take your pick.

I recommend RMT heartily.  Everyone's doing it. Rarely does anyone of note get banned.  Why not?  Might as well bot while you're at it too - if you can't beat them, join them!

If missiles are for beginners and drones are for beginners does that make Guristas ships for ultra-beginners?

How mean is panfam to not suicide their fleet on that blob.
---
More like, how dumb is panfam for not keeping up
---
Umm, capital guns can hit 400+ km away and track a BS. Especially one that isn‚Äôt moving. A 200km inhib range does nothing.
---
You know Vince was involved and endorsed the deal? NC leadership didn't have a problem with it at the time.
---
Pretty much.
---
It seems like that was the OP's motivation for posting this tripe, too...
---
Maybe because the only way to keep up is being dumb? You give a nice model
---
You missed out the /s
---
I like his gold ammo idea. 
---
It would be great to buy golden ammo. &lt;3
---
I'd like to believe nobody is actually this stupid.
---
lets make a simple thought experiment: Imagine theres a shop that gives you 2 bottles of water for free every day. Do you believe you have any right to be upset or mad at them if they one day decide to only give you 1?
---
How many titans was that?
---
I loved HardWar! I found it in a bargain bin in a hardware store for $5 in 2000 and put waaay too many hours into that game. One of the first titles that really sparked my interest in learning more about how games work.
---
Materal is not on the CMS, but can we get golden ammo anyways?
---
Me too I feel strong when I shoot undefended structure in big expensive ships surronded by thousand of friends X)
---
The laser effects are cool btw
---
What are wallet divisions, Alex?
---
Don't it.  Most botting accts are alpha so no Ishtar, and they're to expensive for bitters to throw away.  If they nerf it then their claim this is to stop botting is bs
---
Tap tap not before my morning coffee sweaty

gl on domis with nerfed hvy drone skills.
---
Nobody gives a shit.
---
Lock cap is 300km. Sure i know that but it's quite specific fit which isn't normally dropped on subcaps.
---
But overall i wouldn't mind if it's 310k :P
---
Alpha domi's with nerfed drone skills INCOMING!
---
Might as well. They lost eve. Just go out in a blaze.
---
SC died so thats not much of a bar

Sweet. They don't even need players anymore.
---
&gt;Maybe because the only way to keep up is being dumb?
---
Recruiting krabs is dumb?
---
I bought my super by selling excavators to krabs.
---
What? No! How do you think goons bashed the Keepstars in the north their last war? Carriers have over 3000k rang. Dreads can hit 400+km
---
Yeesh, smugposting about bashing an undefended citadel is SOOO 2016
---
I left a few month back, what is the state of the game now and what's going on ?
---
PH moved to Geminate in Feb, Goons switched attention to Deadco/GotG. We did the deal with goons end of September. Not saying mistakes weren't made but 7+ months didn't feel that fast.
---
Chinese in venal = again bots.
---
Some people like high sec mining, some others like doing missions in high sec, some like pvp, some jita station trading, others like owning multiple alts and mine with multiple rorqs all day, etc. Goons particular brand of play works, no one denies that. But its not for everyone.
---
Panfam‚Äôs fault, if anything, is not recruiting more of that people. Or want to.
---
Such instant align only works from zero velocity. Otherwise they wouldn't need an instawarp at all, and instead just undock, instantly align and warp away. You can try this with any inty; whether from undocking or after a warp, you can't instantly align to where you go next (unless you go in a straight line to the next point, maybe?)
---
No thanks. What you're proposing may keep EVE alive for a few more years, but you and I have very, very different ideas on the definition of the word "save."
---
I don't think you're fragging anything more than structures.
---
i know a nice place you can shove that gold ammo :)
---
&gt;Panfam‚Äôs fault, if anything, is not recruiting more of that people
---
This is exactly what I mean.
---
All you hear is them screaming how they don't want to krab, as if recruiting krabs and making dosh out of that wasn't possible.
---
Cyno in to die in seconds is not go out in a blaze, is more like trying to lit a faulty matchstick.
---
For sure it s full of bot. Report them as best as you can. Bots from everybody is a cancer. Put bubble between their anom and their citadell to kill them! Good luck
---
Kill bots, not vnis...
---
Me too. Go to Delve, steal excavs, sell them back to goons. Ez money ez game
---
Careful mate, you still have a bit of that sticky white stuff on your cheek.
---
There's no such thing as fun for all. People complain because they want fun for me, but not for thee. 
---
People's feedback doesn't get taken seriously by the developers because they only provide one-sided feedback.
---
About the Wolf Wormhole bit, gtfo. We elected an actual wormholer to worry about that shit so overpaid Null Blocks WOULDNT try shit like this. üñïüèΩ
---
Well. Deadbrain cells dominate economics aaaand now, PvP too.
---
How do fell a "elite pvper" being kicked on the ass by a spodbrain nerd?
---
Their, as in NC/PL, prerogative to play as they want. Even if its wrong if they wish to remain a power in this game.
---
My question exactly!
---
Adapt or die.
---
or quit.
---
You see, that is the difference. I once got my super gifted to me by my CEO (like most of the supers in corp) from the income we as a corp generated by PvP (in the case taking R64 from PanFam and Dorkness/Kadeshi) ... That PvP was patched away in favour of afk rock grinding, so there is not much to do in EVE after 13 years except some lowsec solo &amp; smallscale shenanigans and some ganks of unskilled big-bloc-members ... That need protection because of that ... that we can and will not provide in our few hours a week. Alternative would be to pile up 90k of unknowns in an unpersonal mega blob. That is also whazt not everybody wants. It is ok that you can play that way, it is not ok to patch away nearly all alternative ways of playing ...
---
I can see how it's annoying, but it's not a problem, it's people playing efficiently.
---
Serious about fixing it though? Don't add a penalty, rather make all the containers have loot.
---
Shit.
---
Goons are just obliterating anything they can on the north, completely unoposed, and then they are celebrating their weekly structure bashing on r/eve.
---
Most people don't even care, this is just the logical conclusion of the economy being completely broken and Goons being good at what they do.
---
That being said, if you find fun in PVP I'd recommend you join a Lowsec or Wormhole group, usual shenanigans and shooting eachother just for the sake of it is thankfully still a thing.
---
Can still be salvaged and sold for plex
---
Exactly. Krabs = Money
---
Holy shit. I've read your list very carefully and while there are some good suggestions on it, there are A LOT that I can only describe as the ideas of a braindead moron. Some of the good ones have been mentioned before by other players, which has me guessing where the bad ones come from.
---
it's a shame the enemy got dunked so hard that this is the narrative they use
---
I'd say goons are a symptom rather than a vector, just like any other null entity that adapted to game CCP has created in that area. Goons were pretty horde/brave-like when it was convenient to be like that (I'm talking about stereotypical horde/brave ofc, based on what they were when they made a name for themselves). Later on it became more convenient to hold vast swathes of space with massive buffer zones, so they put away their "no pubbies, fuck j2gs" policies and started to rent land out, humorously trying to expand into lowsec landlording with results you've already mentioned. Then they also started to muster Karmafleet. Some time later, when current null iteration came, they again pushed themselves into something that was relatively new to them at the time as well, which we know pretty well these days: SIGs, rorqs, standing fleets, citadel spam.
---
It seems to me that others are just slower to follow the meta for various reasons.
---
As for myself, since you just had to mention that. I'm not against changing null meta if you folks will have more fun that way, not at all. I just think, for reasons I've alluded to above, no matter what new meta will be, goons will win again as long as organizational skill, understanding of macro processes and human nature will matter. And it will matter as long as EVE stays open sandbox like it is. This is just my superficial opinion, if things will turn out differently - good for you, I guess.
---
Personally, I have no horse in this race. When I was playing the game I was in some random C4 corp nobody cared about, and that's all I have to say on the matter of me having strong opinions on how nullsec players should be playing their game.
---
holy shit - not only are these good suggestions... they fall within the realm of possibility!
---
Bad troll attempt, you just come out as completely retarded.
---
Yeah, and make EA the publisher of EvE too...
---
Fuck off
---
Just bring more cynos
---
Press F to pay respects.
---
F
---
you should see it when the opposing team actually tries to save their valuable assets instead of limp dicking away
---
Yeah, just a couple, in case :p
---
&gt;Nope, CCPs fault, punishing everybody that doesn't want to ~~spend his few free hours a week afking rocks.~~ actually play the game.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Goes to show how shitty these botters actually are at the game.
---
Avoiding this situation is incredibly easy. But no, these backwater scripters can't even figure out how to counter instaundock camps
---
I unironically had the same idea pop in my head the other day
---
Large, well-organized coalitions will just bring 10-15 guys all with cynos while small groups will struggle to have enough cynos.
---
***Yawn*** 
---
More over powered Trig ships blowing others up.
---
Maybe CCP will release a video of it, with Rooks and Kings style voiceover.
---
&gt; Well. Deadbrain cells dominate economics aaaand now, PvP too.
---
&gt; How do fell a "elite pvper" being kicked on the ass by a spodbrain nerd?
---
What? You speak in riddles. I mean I know that economics atm is pretty fucked in EVE exactly because of spodbrain, but what do you mean with the 2nd line ? Hint: I do not live in Nullsec since a few years. And if you ask how generally "elite-pvp" gets kicked by "spodbrain nerd" just take a look how africanized ants kill large mamals ... aniother hint ... it depends on a huge disparity in numbers ...
---
Really? They blue over half the galaxy and then attack panfam.
---
Should panfam just suicide into that shit? No point
---
they try to do something, sadly skill injector help bot to rebuild a banned account pretty quickly..
---
I'm unsure, but it seems to be an hour or two; don't quote me on that though.
---
By the number of pissed off and complaining posts about ‚Äòhow goons broke Eve‚Äô I would say that a lot of people ‚Äòcare‚Äô.
---
&gt; Selling JF for ten times the the price
---
Now I've got Front 242 stuck in my head *again*...
---
‚ô´ I'm looking for this Ark to sell it to other men
---
To sell him to other men at ten times the price at least
---
I'm looking for this man who knows the rules of the game
---
Who's able to forget them to realize my aim ‚ô´
---
Having skim read through these, it honestly feels like you just picked stuff out of thin air. 
---
No why, no doing x solves or lessens x problem, or alters this in regard to this, just throw stuff out and make it look as if you are doing something?
---
My honest thoughts - Scrap this list, pick say 6-10 of what you or ideally, the player base see as the biggest issues and focus on them. This is a waste of yours and everyone else involved's time.
---
so afk grinding rocks with scripts (NEAR2/TACO/ISB Broadcast) supporting your lazyness, not even necessary to stay tabbed in as the Bots will ping and Theta will save you (except your one of the stilll enough totally retarded) is called "playing a game" today? Spodbrain really is spread wide already ....
---
Panfam has always been kinda real though. At least compared to the south
---
Goons and TEST especially, are super narrative driven. Citing great causes and whatnot for going to war etc etc.
---
Meanwhile the north mostly just tells the truth. For example: We're invading tenal/branch to mess with their economy.
---
Or we're deploying to delve to frag krabs because we can't fight the mainfleet megablob
---
Et cetera. Screw the narrative. Just play the game
---
I have a friend, claimed that he got some inside information on the best way to do it. RMT'ed his accounts, loot and such then went to Australia, hasn't been back here or to EVE since.
---
That would be nice. I like that you can still ninja salvage. It‚Äôs a good mechanic for alphas. We will get T2 salvage drones, thanks to Dinkle, the Brave overload.
---
when i started playing, the intro told me that i am an invincible capsuleer able to command ships with my mind some 20k years into a dystopian future. i was hooked instantly.
---
I don't live in null and would like CCP to look at the other 2/3 areas of the game. I don't think I'm asking for much?
---
Only narrative that they like is, ‚Äúwe lost because Eve is broken‚Äù.  That sounds better than ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt like that meta (or our region) anyway‚Äù
---
Why should a frigate kill a battleship?
---
Goes way beyond that. Like I said elsewhere, they should have kept up.
---
Coded by 1 guy over a period of years where he basically never really had to worry about rendering more than ascii characters on a grid. Designed for single player only, which is very different than coding for an mmo. If someone causes a catastrophe because of an interaction in a single player game, it's just a cute interaction that makes for a good story. In an mmo, you could ruin the game for everybody.
---
There are entirely too many titans in this game.
---
Oh ok my brain fart.
---
They're fragging Eve subscriptions
---
If you want afk ISK generation so bad, why not consider mining? Honest question.
---
That must be the first time someone's called Damaviks overpowered lol
---
Not all players want to PvE all day. Geminate is ripe for solo and smallgang pvp (Content!) because of it's location. Delve is the opposite. That itself should say enough
---
Panfam and it's members (players, individuals!) want to PvP rather than krab all day. Hence being in panfam. If you want to sit 8 hours a day in a rorq or super, then go ahead, but that's not what everybody plays the game for. Because to some, that's boring as fuck.
---
umadbro?
---
The fuck you gonna do against this many titans and supers? Eve broke lol
---
Limit the number of cynos that can be activated in a system.
---
Nah, he's a regular here, just flairbaiting.  
---
No idea what triggered his dedicating a Reddit account to hating on TEST at every opportunity.  We're still trying to get him to show us on the doll where the dino touched him, but we haven't had any real breakthroughs yet.
---
Bubble yes; scram no.
---
Nah, EVE is still by far the graphically most blingy chatroom, and dropping your crabs still is fun, it just has no influence on the larger scale anymore that it had a few years back, but the fun per hour is still better that shooting Structures in TiDi for hours for damage notification. 0 (deflected)
---
I think he is bitter ...
---
Swag
---
nice job dunking structures
---
1337
---
&gt; Best thing they could've done would be drop a stasis tower in the sites and spawn fast webbing frigs on every wave. Sig tank anom ratting would die right then and there. Instead of fixing the actual problem they go and "fix" a wonderful pvp ship.
---
Shall we focus on ways CCP could solve botting entirely instead of picking over a single ship, chaps?
---
injectors be thanked
---
That Tuskers gang seemed to have no idea what they were doing
---
considering your numbers advantage and everything this wasn't even a fight
---
I appreciate you saying it in the beginning and everything, but you should probably look towards finding more interesting fights and start displaying some impressive BR at the beginning to keep people interested
---
it took over two minutes for gameplay to start
---
commentary is good albeit some decisions you didn't talk about, like ramming the jackdaw or getting into scram range for the orthrus :P
---
dont want to shit talk, this is helpful for a lot of people that are interested in this kind of content already but maybe you need to make it easier for people not familiar with small gang to watch (see: impressive BR at the start idea)
---
good shit regardless, chessurs videos are so old and the meta has changed
---
If you could just make quick videos like this for future citadel shoots.... I'll gladly stop logging in and wasting my time with CCP's trash damage cap gameplay on un-defended structures
---
good thing theyre changing tethering mechanics so that ships can leave tether anymore!
---
at least three
---
I like the colors of the ships in space, specifically the green for the distance.  What is that from, and how do I get it?
---
name checks out?...
---
Suicide is one thing, DOing at least something is another. They could have harass the shit out of Goons, guerrilla tactics. But they choose to stay docked ...
---
How come you usin' Mystic at 600m?   Fun vid, I know frigwork takes some coordination to survive
---
You should probably drag either enemy or friendly targets into a new row to have less confusion.
---
You mix up bitter with adult, sane, and actually having deeper economic knowledge bro
---
Good point, I'll definitely start doing that.
---
Goons play style works for everyone... lets be honest. Lots of people have alts in goons and grind easy afk money for their mains else where.
---
https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aQ33PZw_700b.jpg
---
Some npc can warp away, but most of them prefere to sacrifice themselves for their tribe i guess.
---
This looks like a lot of powercreep so I'm against a lot of it based on that alone e.g. the cpu upgrades across the board.
---
Regarding the fleet hanger increase base size on DST's, I feel like they are the size they are for a reason, like stopping certain objects being able to be placed inside even at max skill but I'm coming up blank on actually having an example
---
No. 
---
Most of those titans and supers have a cyno on them anyway. It's already an established tactic that you light a second cyno on a super immediately so the initial subcap cyno can get killed without causing problems. People would just light more cynos. That change would make no difference.
---
pro tip: Rooks &amp; Kings! might get some ideas how to at least do something
---
Yeah but then if i'm defending i'm lighting max cynos to jam out the system.
---
If you haven't already, please make sure to file a Bug Report; every extra bit of information helps.

CCP seems to be on the case already:

[11:43:54] ISD Cobalt &gt; That seems to be an issue that occured with this patch, please file a bug report via the F12 menu if you can. CCP is already investigating.
---
you seem like you solved the problem. why not go to publishers all around the world and let them pay to get your super idea that no other moderator has thought of. yeah right, cause it doesn't work that way
---
If you think you can come up with a set of rules that not trivial to exploit and doesn't require CCP to individually approve each voter, go for it.
---
That would be because I'm an idiot who was using T2 disintegrators for the first time, I didn't even realise I was using the wrong type till you pointed that out! Thanks :)
---
Did he, thought?
---
Is not about feeling strong yourself, is about knowing they are weak!
---
&gt;it's a shame the enemy got dunked so hard that this is the narrative they use
---
You mean blobbed? I mean it's not like in fair fights you'd actually win. Surely the allaince tournament shows this.
---
Hey! You have to do a bit of fiddling, let me dig out the details for you.
---
This site lets you make a custom ship label, [http://www.iciclesoft.com/eveonline/shiplabeler/](http://www.iciclesoft.com/eveonline/shiplabeler/)
---
Then you need to use this guide from CCP in 2008(!) on how to always show all ship labels - [https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6864437/](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6864437/)
---
Hope this helps!
---
Wormholes are great!
---
What's funny is panfam won the first major timer and fight when shit was us tz timed. They held their cyno jammers and ihubs and we had to feed even to get into the constellation. Probably could have cost us trillions trying to grind in there if they didn't want to un-ironically us the Fabian shit as well
---
Bashing an undefended citadel is ok ... it confirms that THEY are weak!
---
Deciding what to talk and not talk about and how deep I want to go on every detail is definitely something I will try to fine-tune. I want to give an overall idea of what's happening so the intermediate level pvp pilots can understand it and not get bored by me explaining something they already very well know. 
---
I picked this clip because I think it involves another group that pvp's a lot (so you assume they don't just do random stuff) and it shows well that piloting errors matter a lot in these kind of skirmishes. I stand by what I said at the end, I think if the comps were reversed, we'd win the engagement too. I don't think there's a world in which you can say that tackling an orthrus+jackdaw+pulse apoc is easy in T2 malediction and garmur unless their side plays it poorly.
---
Or you know, recruiting krabs and profiting off that.
---
How do you lose eve?
---
Yeah I thought about that as I posted that.  The option that I think will be the most unpopular is remove them from the game.  I don't even understand why we need them anyway.  The game can be rescaled without them.
---
All this buildup for nothing? No joke about \[insert your most hated alliance here\]?
---
Looks like he's mostly interested in 16oz curls
---
There's not really a good lore reason for why dumber NPCs just throw themselves at capsuleers. Thankfully, there's more intelligent AI in the works that actually reevaluates engagements based on what they're facing.
---
Mittens figured out how to weaponize autism, was game over for everyone since then.
---
And why is that a problem? ... I\`m really curious, not trolling.
---
I mean the game rules/mechanics are the same for everyone ... so every1 can have one with the right amount of time and work.
---
If you are the average spodbrain, I wouldnt want you in my alliance either.
---
Goons are good at bringing numbers, in even fights they don't tend to fair well.
---
Enjoy wasting that time and being an NPC i guess

GF. I support our US TZ. Just sad Beacon was not there to whelp also.

nullsec carebear here...just giving my two cents for the few things i saw
---
Rev are already "king of dreads" shouldnt get a buff
---
Would even go the other way...decrease fighter bay for the damage bonus on hel/nyx. or increase the wyvern/aeon fighter bay even further
---
missiles are in a weird spot yes...more range on javelin could help but will make goku/stuka fleets more suppressive at long ranges.
---
arent bombs already pretty effective against subcaps if used right? they can delete complete subcaptial fleets.
---
most "new" players dont use combat probes...give a buff to normal scanner probes or look into the skillplan and give a small buff to the first 1-3 skilllevel
---
yes and/or nerf scorch/tracking on revelation hull
---
yes please
---
i saw less super drops in the past few weeks/month. they are a anticap drop. carriers are a good anti supercarrier drop with ss fighters. giving a supercarrier more lights would negate that even further. slightly(!) increase the application against subcap but not close to pre nerf.
---
101. Faction titans no longer have a 5x Entosis penalty
---
.... please no
---
102. Chimera Scarab Bonus changed to 10% effectiveness
---
103. Archon Cenobite Bonus changed to 10% effectiveness
---
never saw these in a fight. like the webifier and neut drones. 
---
111. Sotiyo pirate loot container changed to 100k m3 from 60k m3.
---
made me laugh...
---
114. CONCORD Response time increased by 20%
---
cant talk about that..but arent brick tanked ships already pretty gank "immune". also wouldnt they just increase the number of gankers (n+1)
---
117. SP loss from T3C‚Äôs now capped at 50,000 Sp
---
rethink t3c sp loss? with injectors its just loosing a bit more isk.
---
119. All Moons produce 3% more.
---
not across the board. moons are already a good income. 
---
120. Marauder Bastion Module now creates a 40km Mobile Cyno inhibitor effect.
---
cyno inhib was always a interesting option for those. all t2 need a rework or looked into (45.-48.)
---
all those small ship buffs/nerf 
---
some of them sound interesting but didnt looked into all of them 
---
(a bigger suggestion and something to think about)
---
with 117. came an idea into my mind 
---
make specific skills "inject" immune like the t3c subsystems or specific capital skills?
---
for starters like t3c subs followed by caps/super/titan and xl weapon platforms or just specific skill levels?
---
Urself
---
orders. they are paid for life. and their order is to defend at all costs.
---
&gt;epic banter m8
---
I think you should check out other regions as well my man. Tribute, esoteris, teneferis, drone lands... it's everywhere. 
---
Ccp robot capture image when you warp to a site when
---
Why not? It gets bites every time after all.
---
Yeah, we're already looking at this.
---
Any time you work with someone new it's always a good idea to get a feeling for how they operate. You could ask, "hey, what's the best way for us to work together?" or just see what they like.
---
Then you change the things you can to make things easier for them, and they do the same for you.
---
That's a terrible idea and will just lead to turbo stomp of supers drop that can't be counter because the escalading side light 20 cynos on their structure grid.
---
By continuing to play afyer the year 2017
---
&gt; Even in 1998, Hardwar was a unique outlier.
---
Isn't basically Elite?
---
HAH! Nah man, you're getting out there and doing it. It still does good damage and allows you to kite away if you need to without breaking the gun spool. Just pretend that's what you're doing next time and use words like 'feather' and wear sunglasses. Looking forward to your next vid!
---
I checked, the kill, its a dual lse no scram orthrus - yikes
---
I really think these guys dropped the ball, hard, I really expected more from them at the start of the video
---
but yeah, making this first video is a great step. I thought about doing something similar myself, but actually _doing_ it is another story.
---
so it can only get better from here :)
---
and regarding the interesting fights - man, it is so hard to get one these days so you better record everything
---
there are many variables in a fight and talking about why you flew the way you did is great, god I was so awful when I started doing this lol
---
Makes sense.
---
So if there is no easy way to find bits how the fuck are alliance leaders supposed to do it? Either there is an easy way for players to detect bits in their corp, in which case it should be just as easy for CCP to do it, or else there is NO easy way to detect bots and people need to ease up on the 'you need to police your own corp for bots' chat.
---
Killing overblinged ships snagging shiny drips and guaranteed content. Ya who wants that. Lol omg you guys are pathetic.
---
Wait shit
---
I can confirm idk what i'm doing.
---
But to be fair, in that vid ship wise it should had been a win, idk what was darj and co. plan there as in why they where so split, or why jack didn't bounced. 
---
I don't see this as a bad engagement ship wise, bad positioning and then just roll over and die, apreciatte how dark just forgot how to warp off/was nice enough to give the kill.  
---
I can see why he thinks this vid is good for explanation cause ship wise it was more on tuskers favour than in his. Boiled down to executioning error. I disagree in a lot of stuff said but that's a very different subject.   
---
Of course in order to realize this you have to do some small gang so it's not so easy to notice.
---
Best response so far is that Titans jumping in have cynos equipped and just light those up. Maybe there is no solution. Glad I solo PvP in lowsec Hohoho
---
gf mate, blobskers feeding again, who let this people in!?
---
Thanks to the brilliant TZ mechanic CCP introduced I've missed every single Keepstar kill so far.
---
Goons didnt break eve

We will have them in rorqs within a month.
---
Well I just did an interesting test. Just repro'd some Ore (To see if the new Trit, Pyer, and Mex would vanish). They didn't but interestingly the new Mins from the Repro wont stack with the previous minerals.
---
What do you think about adding a timer relative to the amount of mass that it would take to travel through the bridge? In a hypothetical, one titan would break the cyno and take 3 minutes to enter the system, whereas an equiv mass of battleships would break the cyno and take 15 seconds or something. 
---
Idk just brainstorming.
---
imagine being this retarded
---
If they weren't literally braindead that would have been an ezclap, there's no reason an orthrus and a jackdaw shouldn't be able to generate a sphere of no frigates allowed, and then after that all that would have remained are two relatively squishy, expensive and slow(ish) cruisers.
---
Good this game needs extreme mineral sinks to have any chance of surviving
---
IRL
---
(I have no clue, legit question)
---
What about that scary Doomsday of a Keepstar?  
---
Can it kill a Titan? 
---
Why isn¬¥t it used?   
---
Are the titans too far away?
---
"Any alliance member talking about botters lmfao have you been to Any region in eve, they‚Äôre the most blatant botting havens in the game" FTFY.
---
you know the real worst thing about this "war"  
---
The mass of cringe comments from goons in any post of r/eve in the past month
---
Spodbrain is real
---
THE ENTIRE GOONSWARM FEDERATION ON SUICIDE WATCH AFTER THEIR SPOD DISAPPEARS!
---
MORE ON THIS NEWS AT 11!
---
A mechanic like that would completely destroy the balance on structure fight. 
---
The defenders will always be able to safely pre-stage their ships on the structure in full force, while the attackers would have to deal with your proposed trickle-mechanic.
---
do you even remember wwb/cw?
---
Sounds about right :p
---
*thot
---
Goon playstyle does not work for people who want to play with decent pvp players. Not being able to trust corpmates to do anything right, and knowing that they're way too retarded to think for themselves is not enjoyable in the slightest.
---
Darkness brought a whole fleet to watch. They pretty much support us too. Glad we have bench warmers now.
---
Freighters have been made slightly harder to kill multiple times. Ganking has been disincentivised multiple times. If CCP don't want empty freighters to be ganked just make them fucking invulnerable already.
---
You can actually improve your zero point bookmark technique by setting the station as your destination and then turning autopilot on while you‚Äôre in warp to the bookmark. You end up docking on the first tick without spamming dock that way.
---
Thanks, will do that next time.
---
I ran it on pyfa cause the new bonuses as just the ones from the brutix and myrmidon but with tracking why was able to get about 760dps out of it with a mix of 5 t2 drones, 3 t2 heavy neutron blasters, on an active armor fit with 3 dda. Yes the shield version is dead, even with 6 dda there's no way to get even 600 dps now.
---
Tfw I have a single rorq that sees more use as a cheap JF, and zero tools beyond garpa and jabber
---
i love how youve become the resident sperg, replacing olmeca lmao
---
&gt;economy being completely broken
---
Its a sandbox.
---
Hey is that Mittens in the middle?
---
Unfortunately I have no artistic skill, so these were mean and painted for now lol
---
Not special anymore, not exciting, that battle looks stupid
---
He means why do NPCs warp regardless of scram/disruptors. Like every single one will warp out. And also why?
---
this video doesnt feature bashing undefended structures, therefore it has no place on /r/eve
---
pls go back to your colossal and wait for pings.
---
It‚Äôs actually my nebula mousepad! lol
---
I‚Äôm using a Stanley 3D printer at .05mm print resolution
---
Cynoing or prepping into an adjacent system isn‚Äôt a thing? 
---
Why does the meta have to be cynoing onto the same grid as the structure? If it‚Äôs defended already prep and warp together instead of a full drop? Still favoring defense Bc they can set up bubbles and other defensive prep measure?
---
Hm... The cost of the cyno attached yo the mass of the ship. So, every shop taking the cyno, consumes fuel from the cyno and colapses if it's not enogh. (mass mecanic from WH, But cant be bypassed liting m√∫ltiple cynos.)
---
So afk/passive moon income is cool but afk/passive undocked ships are not cool.
---
And because your space pixel capital was bought with moon money instead of build with the minerals someone mined it is way cooler than the mined one.
---
And since you are obviously playing the game the cool and meant to be way everybody should do that or at least ccp HAS to cater your playstyle!  
---
Correct?
---
Its true, he doesnt play.
---
Great, now i'm going to have to sell all my VNIs and move into rorquals to mine. Thx CCP...
---
&gt; certain level of skill and game knowledge
---
like pointing your ship i a certain direction and activating propmod? yeah i can see how that requires skill for some nullbears. most of them can hardly warp to an anom and deploy drones before going afk....
---
I feel like that‚Äôs a personal question if it‚Äôs worth it, this 3-D printer that I am using retails for about $1000, The model itself is probably under a dollar worth of plastic being this small
---
Because totally there si not Titan droping on Low sec...
---
We just want to remind your positon in the curent meta ... every day, for years to come.
---
I aquired my super by asking for one . . .
---
Didn't have to recruit a single miner retard, nor put in a single hour of farming.
---
He's also right, you can be bitter and right.
---
only one side can blue most of the galaxy, by definition. i frankly can't wait for us to unblue a whole bunch of people.
---
1) To a degree yes, but im buffing most of the other dreads in other ways. This doesn't fundamentally change much.
---
2) I'm not trying to make them better, just bridge the gap a little
---
3) Javelin is the Hybrid ammo, not the missile ammo.
---
4) Yes and No, most smaller ships are super hard to hit with bombs and have a variety of defensive mechanics around them. Bombs are in a pretty rough spot vs. basically anything not a battleship as it currently stands, IMO, i could certainly be wrong on that.
---
5) You are quite possibly correct, better suggestions on how to do this would be appreciated.
---
8) the support squadron nerf would be massive, this in theory gives a little back. I think vs. subs you'd find supers still use mostly LR Fibos.
---
9) I think it would be fun ;p
---
10) 11) ya cause they are terrible. This tries to bridge the gap.
---
13) Definetly not, and yes would increase the floor on highsec ganking requirements.
---
14) i think this is a halfway between full and none.
---
15) maybe you are correct.
---
16) ya this one needs more thought/work
---
God what a terrible fit for a yacht.  
---
And how do you even find the undock point for something with a CovOps cloak? They're not just bots. They're remarkably poor bots apparently.
---
Imagine if processing minerals decayed over time.
---
can or can not?  
---
What you mean?   
---
What will they change?
---
That's only narrowly correct.
---
There is such a thing as an unassailable advantage and its links to "old money" are well documented, both IRL and in EVE.
---
Going way back, Goons had a long-term advantage in that they had fortified a part of space and that part of space then became a massive cash-cow due to its grip on certain T2 manufacturing components.
---
That ISK income (and others) allowed Goonswarm as a whole to buy in to any new game mechanism that provided them an advantage, and to do so at a far higher level than any other group in game. 
---
That made the group more powerful, leading to them attracting or absorbing more people, and when the colossal fuckup that was Rorquals came along, they were in the best place to exploit it, and with for all intents unlimited minerals, Titan production went off the charts.
---
Goon's leadership and diplomacy also played a large part, in effect multiply the effect of their in-game advantages. 
---
Power in EVE is an exponential curve. No-one will ever catch up to Goonswarm, and anyone who tried would be crushed or borged the moment they tried to assert themselves.
---
But that huge economic advantage that is the basis of it all, started a long, long time ago, and a new group simply cannot re-create it.
---
thanks for taking the time to read it. I put this together with the intent of getting more feedback to impove it. Thats why its on reddit. I would love your thoughts and opinions on things.
---
Fair enough. It came from WH people so i figured it was legit, I'm putting these things here for feedback not for finalization.
---
&gt; The minerals are still there, but somehow not displayed."
---
spooky
---
I am neutral on this, I just want stuff to blow up tbh. 
---
If goons are so inept, why aren‚Äôt Panfam organising amazing counter strategies to pick apart and kill these titan blobs?
---
Thank you for the detailed explanation, really helpful!
---
You must be new if you truly believe PanFam has no narrative.
---
RIP T1 MEATGRINDER-DOCTRINES EVERYONE FLY T2 BLINGFITS NOW
---
As it currently stands a Ninja DST has looted something like 24 of 26 of the last x sotiyo's so i think its obvious some changes might be needed.
---
I agree on the SW-'s but i didn't want to go too far too quick. This is a bump but not one that would necessarily make them viable.
---
Just makes salvaging easier. I think its one of the best ways for new players to make income and this would be aimed at making that easier.
---
CCP decided to take a nuclear option to fixing Rorquals once and for all
---
I'm putting these things here for feedback not for finalization, if you have thoughts im here to collect them.
---
Lies!
---
All races have 2x T1 industrial. One is high cargo capacity, the other is high agility. Badger is high agility. If you're going to do the badger then do all of the race's agility ones.
---
If you're going to adjust jammers then jump bridges probably also need adjusting. I currently think however that any *online* structure needs a degree of minimum time so that there's a chance of forming up to counter. Even if it's "shoot shield layer, get 15 mins RF time, shoot armor layer, proceed to normal rules" or similar.
---
Why no extra CPU for the Phoenix? That's another capital which often has fitting mods in the fit.
---
&gt;How to fight the Cap Proliferation? 
---
Steal everyones Minerals. Problem solved!
---
Shame innit.
---
I'm putting these things here for feedback not for finalization, if you have thoughts im here to collect them. This is about refining the ideas before i take them further not declaring my in stone positions.
---
i think we might be looking at a different zkill then?
---
You managed to fat finger more isk than I've ever had.
---
ya there is definetly a better way for me to suggest this one. Needs refinement. Open to help.
---
The dozens of tickets I've put in regarding character bazaar things would be my source (though only 3 regarding scams, the first two were handled in 2-3 days).

you dont... you sell your kronos, buy a paladin
---
Nah I've been here for a couple of years.
---
And of course panfam has a narrative. But nowhere to the same extent as tapi always about to be evicted and fighting a war for their own existence. Or the goon narrative, really..
---
with MJD, lots of EHP and neuts....who are these hunters?
---
Meh dank minerals. 
---
I wish I was home to witness this just out of sheer curiosity.
---
C3 it's way to expensive for the job
---
C4 are not worth doing it
---
i don't necessarily disagree (although we ARE living in that meta) do you think this would fundamentally change the fits it uses? To me the thought was just to give it a HAM package "option" since it basically near pefect fits a cookie cutter setup.
---
Tenal's still being glased?
---
 I thought gotg did that in one go.... at the same time as goons created timers, then patted themselves on the back for their hard work
---
Fit it with a lot of friends, you're gonna need it.
---
thanks bro.
---
It's reasonable if you think about it. Fixes ninja looting.
---
**feeding intensifies**
---
Terrible ideas, for the most part - I don't like 80% of your proposal. Plus no justification (which makes them worse).  
---
Plus, this is too "much" to bring to the CSM.  You're thinking too tactically (tweaks that are obviously meant to make NS even more of a safe haven, which is stupid), vs big picture (strategically, how do I keep the game alive and well as a sandbox). Whittle this down to 3 main points/overarching themes, with sub-points on how you'd achieve them.
---
I already zonked the damp down from 10% and maybe it shouldn't be there at all. 
---
Other points are interesting but I'm mostly aiming for super simple to fix changes via simple database adjustment with this stuff.
---
&gt;Why does the meta have to be cynoing onto the same grid as the structure? 
---
It's relatively easy to hold down a super or cap fleet indefinitely by just feeding dictors. Capital fleets are cyno'd in where the FC wants them to be for the fight, because once they're there they probably won't move until the fight is over.
---
Cynoing in off-grid or gating in from an adjacent system is a good way to not make it to the fight before the repair timer is done.
---
Mad? Doesn't seem like it. Honest and accurate? Yes.
---
omg it requires 14 dudes instead of 12 to gank that afk freighter! the horror!
---
In my opinion freighters should have SOME ability to go afk in space, maybe thats not shared but thats MY view.
---
765dps now heavily reliant on blasters.  You may find you can push your dps up higher by swapping 1 dda to a mag stab.  That might actually get it over the dps of the current vni.  Maybe.
---
The problem is the vni is not a comet.  It's not fast, or agile and if it cant keep its target within 3k it isn't applying half that damage now.  
---
Look at it however you want, this is a shit sandwich super nerf.  Little bit of good, terrible horrible bullshit, little bit of good.  o/
---
Wipe out all minerals stored and watch the amount of Rorq's go up in gigantic leaps.
---
Farming delve is just more fun
---
Nope! Chuck Testa
---
I see a marauder doing C3s/C4s I see either bait (especially in a C3) or rich bastard.
---
The breakdown was 499 from drones 266 from blasters with all skills at 5.
---
Muninn would be the main one. Its fast because its supposed to be an Armour ship.
---
It has no mids after you fit tank+prop. 
---
You say its very good but everyone seems to be switching to Eagles recently? 
---
So it cant be that amazing.
---
Okay little tip, when choosjng layerheight try choosing something which is a multiple of 0.02 (0.04, 0.06, 0.08 ...2.4.2.6 ) this comes with the steps your stepper motor can naturally do there is a video on youtube explaining it but basically your stepper motor CAN do 0.05 but he doesnt wants to. For me it increased print time and also quality.
---
I don't know, I'm not 25 anymore and singularly focused on Eve. I have a GF, a job and other hobbies too.
---
Even Battleclinic doesn't exist anymore showing all my PvP deeds when I was online 8h a day.
---
I basically went through most of the ship classes and tried to hit on things that needed bumps from my POV.
---
No, your correct i didn't the ferox has actually been nerfed somewhat hard and while in highsec is still quite broken, it feels moderatly weak in null atm compared to alot of the current hac stuff.
---
The med arty weapon system probably needs a 10% nerf. and might be the way i roll in the next draft of this.
---
I'm not trying to destroy the balance of eve, just gently shake it up, albeit it everywhere at once.
---
ya its 20k, my bad.
---
&gt;I don't know, I'm not 25 anymore and singularly focused on Eve. I have a GF, a job and other hobbies too.
---
And because of that your alliance can't recruit krabs?
---
&gt;In my opinion freighters should have SOME ability to go afk in space, maybe thats not shared but thats MY view.
---
In my opinion nobody should be safe in space undocked ever. And this by your own admission only makes freighters marginally safer. I just personally don't see that it's required at all. If you want to AFK haul use a blockade runner.
---
&gt; opposing team actually tries to save their valuable assets
---
Those days are long gone and probably not coming back at least for goons.
---
downvoting all 3D printing eve ships posts from now....
---
&gt;have alts in goons and grind easy afk money for their mains else where.
---
I think you missed that part.
---
I accept ur point but I don't think is 100% accurate. I doubt Goons have the stamina to glass a region every month, so others can catch up ... if the want to make the effort to.
---
By "what they do" I meant generating an organized enviorment to let anyone do whatever they want while indirectly fueling the swarm's war machine.
---
They are not the biggest and best organized group in the game by accident.
---
maybe your right, im open to ideas. Give me more to work with. Alot of the fitting buffs ARE buffs, but they are for ships that NEED those fitting buffs (a couple dont mind you) most of the ships that are IN-meta are there because their fitting is good enough where it matters, most of the ships that are OUT of meta are there because there fitting is NOT good enough where it matters. Most of these buffs wouldn't change much, but as i've said elsewhere, a gentle shake of balance might be the right approach.
---
Why RMT when you can afk rat in ~~carrier~~ **Supercarrier** under the goons Capital Umbrella and make dank ticks...
---
üéµOne, you **lock** the target.
---
Two, you bait the line.
---
Three, you slowly spread the net.
---
And four, you catch the man!üéµ
---
I don't disagree. But the toolbox/arc im working with here is simple database change balance.
---
Another odd one. I logged out 5 minutes before downtime. Now that account can log in, but can't select that character. Can make a new character on that account, but not log in the only existing character. I can click the portrait and nothing happens. My other accounts no issues at all.
---
Ghostile stop badposting and prepare for ShB already.
---
The dancer bunnies await.
---
blasters, neuts, a grappler, dab on the weak
---
 Alot of the fitting buffs ARE buffs, but they are for ships that NEED those fitting buffs (a couple dont mind you) most of the ships that are IN-meta are there because their fitting is good enough where it matters, most of the ships that are OUT of meta are there because there fitting is NOT good enough where it matters. 
---
I 100% agree that mechanics are a bigger issue than balance overall. However this entire list in theory might be programable quicker than even a quarter of a minor balance change.
---
This might not be a bad idea, but i'm really focusing on simple +1, -1 database changes because they are so much more acheivable.
---
Yeah, I remember fighting MoneyBadgerCo (everybody in eve) every day for over 3 months straight, in T1s, until we lost. We lost big time! You or anybody else can't say the Imperium won't fight. We didn't whine about it! CCP made the choice to stop Casino money not the GSF. We went to Delve, fought, built and came back. What are you going to do? Get your shit kicked-in every summer? Get pushed down into the waiting jaws of Test? PanFam will have to go to Delve and fight the Goons OR they can spend their time fucking around being a whipping boy for the rest of Eve.
---
thanks for taking the time to read it. I put this together with the intent of getting more feedback to impove it. Thats why its on reddit. I would love your thoughts and opinions on whats right/wrong with the ship and how to make it and its compatriots better.
---
any semi-competent pvp group would have wiped the floor with their gang - I used to count tuskers among them
---
kronos didn't win because they were good but because tuskers were bad
---
that orthrus fit, jesus christ
---
I guess it is. Anyway, let me express my thanks to you for teaching our guys in Delve the ways of the null.
---
I'd love eve to have a more aggressive NPC presence in Nullsec. 
---
For example, An Angel invasion of a constellation in immensea. A large NPC fleet shows up and starts dropping Citadels in the  with timers equal to the constellation average (making them friendly to destroy... unless your attempting to timezone tank your structures...) and aggressive rats that use the Drifter AI (chasing players through the system).
---
If they are not removed within a week, the NPCs escalate and start bashing structures and Sov. If the sov isn't defended, the alliance lose all structures and the systems flip to conquerable NPC sov.
---
Depending on how they tune it, it could force alliances to have stratops to defend their sov from NPCs!
---
Would require alot of thought around a few bits, like drops... would people try to spawn NPC cap fleets just to farm isk from dropping supers on them.  I'm also sure some people would get super pissed off if they lost billions of isk in structures to NPCs... lots of issues, but still, they can be worked through!
---
There is very little organization at the individual level in a titan ball, the average player simply right clicks, and jumps to cyno. The vast majority of Goons fleets are designed specifically around being flown by literal disabled monkeys, and have at most guns + mwd + permarunning invulns. 
---
Heck even if they do pick off a handfull of titans and soups here and there, which they seem to be doing decently down in Delve, it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. They can be replaced much quicker than they can be killed.
---
Don't look at it, give it back! D:
---
Triggering people is my preparation for ShB D:
---
Also, HI!
---
What does that have to do with anything? 
---
It's a sandbox videogame, and we play in the sandbox with the tools CCP provide us... mineral surplus, supercapital proliferation, structure spam, lack of isk sinks and excess of faucets are what broke the game, and those are all direct consecuences of the mechanics put in place by the developers; not the players.
---
So no, the game being a sandbox is irrelevant in this matter.
---
You have to be autistic to be part of the TEST le 9Gag XD meme alliance.
---
Man I remember all you people screaming when goons said the exact same thing in WWB. Eve really does go full circle
---
Bastion module was recently introduced. Fitted it to my kronos. swiftly lost it to a lvl 4 mission by ignoring triggers and spawning all the things. i had 10 seconds left on my bastion cycle :(
---
That is consistent with what we've been seeing and having reported as well; hopefully we'll have it sorted soon‚Ñ¢. Thanks for the info and if you can, please do file a bug report!
---
o7
---
I guess then that the Palatine KS is a no-go ?
---
What would you like, some incel that sounds like you and gets Most Likely to be Kicked or Arrested? We already have Gobbins.
---
They are too far away. I don't think a single Keep DD can kill a titan tho
---
I doubt they have the collective stamina either, however they don't have to glass a region every month as it were.
---
All it requires is an overwhelming show of power every now and then, and that acts as a chilling effect to dissuade others from growing to a point where they may face that. Now we've got to a point where if every other group combined, they'd still be vastly inferior in ships and numbers, soooo... that advantage has now been locked in.
---
So that's what the autofeeding Yacht bots are doing. TIL! Nice.
---
Alpha's aren't restricted like that anymore.
---
Now even the minerals are cloaky camping.
---
Can we make eve dangerous again, at least for minerals?
---
fuck off, loser
---
Is that eula compliant? The icicle soft i mean.
---
Just to correct you, EA made the foundation for loot boxes with fifa card packs many years back i cant remember if it was late 90s or early 00s, still point is your idea is retarded.
---
Wouldnt be easy to fill the ark with 80b in plex, undock, warp to safe and eject so the other guy takes it?
---
Hmm, too much effort. Selling it at 80b is faster...
---
Try it with 1 mag stab and 2 dda.  I will probably run it with 1 of each so I can fit all those beautiful reppers on there.  Maybe hybrid weapon rigs too.
---
I've tried mining in barges. Less isk, more clicking, more drama with cherrypicking ores and whatnot, and more bothersome to get the actual isk at the end because it involves selling the ore. Mixing in industry adds a whole other lever of complexity, especially when deciding what to make and staying ahead of supply/demand. With ratting you just gotta make sure there are enough fhubs, which there usually are, and the isk is instant (loot notwithstanding).
---
Never tried rorq mining, so can't speak to that, but don't particularly care to train into or to buy one.
---
When will this "great" Campaing of undefended Structure bashes come to an end?
---
They were supposed to be rare ships. That‚Äôs how they were conceived. It used to be an alliance-level feat just to build one.
---
Now you have fleets of them. I would have made the mineral requirement x10 or more just to reduce the amount of titans that could be built.
---
Unsure if trolling or not... but dreads lock cap is 300k. Carriers are an exclusion from this rule, yes.
---
How else are we supposed to catch ratters deal in nullsec?
---
Came back to EVE after that, I think, so I‚Äôll take your word on that. But it was true back then, just as is true now: There‚Äôs no point whatsoever to suicide ships if it will not change the outcome.
---
I already have a ticket in and already added that info into that ticket
---
#919586
---
its almost as if CCP is in Goonswarm to make the Rorq advantage benefit Goonswarm the most. Sounds like good game design.
---
River crocs got him.
---
Those "Do not swim" signs are posted for a reason.
---
Are c4s really but good anymore?
---
It's not too difficult: it's just a new work relationship, give it room to establish and grow. Just be aware that you may need to adapt your work patterns a bit. One colleague of mine got very stressed if people weren't absolutely accurate on what he needed to do in a project. It got me into the habit of confirming action points via email after every meeting 
---
One thing you might want to be prepared for is some effing abrupt emails back. Just don't take them personally . One man's efficient communication is another mans hate mail.....
---
Just keep it all. Call it EVE Online: Purge, the autumn 2019 expansion. Force us to go all Mad Max fighting over (finally) scarce resources.
---
Then when we're all in Mad Max survival mode introduce a small oasis constellation where the minerals are located.
---
Yes, mainly groups who want to be pvp focused.
---
Yeah I'll run that though the simulation, I checked with 3 Mag instead of DDA and it lost 30dps.
---
Ok ran it and it's basically the same as 3 DDA, showed 762.
---
If I didn't have a C3 static in my C4 I'd consider it. Generally the C4 I lived in didn't have sites cos everyone despawnd them, I don't blame them.
---
&gt;Yeah, I remember fighting MoneyBadgerCo (everybody in eve) every day for over 3 months straight, in T1s, until we lost
---
No, you had three major fights then SWORDFLEETS for maybe a month while the citadel road to the south was being paved. When it was done, y'all moved.
---
&gt;You or anybody else can't say the Imperium won't fight.
---
The entire GRAND STRATEGY LOL HURF DURF was "Fabian Strategy" of denying the MBC any actual fights after it became clear that Imperium was outnumbered.
---
&gt;We didn't whine about it! 
---
Except you guys did, every day, on here. Sion got so mad he called /r/eve "not a community" and it spawned a hilarious but short-lived meme.
---
&gt;CCP made the choice to stop Casino money not the GSF.
---
What's that got to do with anything?
---
&gt;We went to Delve, fought, built and came back.
---
Yes, you did. GJ.
---
&gt;What are you going to do? Get your shit kicked-in every summer? Get pushed down into the waiting jaws of Test?
---
Er what? For the record im not in panfam or any nullsec alliance for that matter. I still dont understand what your statement is supposed to mean...
---
&gt;PanFam will have to go to Delve and fight the Goons OR they can spend their time fucking around being a whipping boy for the rest of Eve.
---
Okay at this point im p sure you're fucking high.
---
Titans were developed to be the ultimate weaposn for alliances. Their whole work, assembled in a single piece, of a few ones.
---
Now, there are shitters like me that own 7 of them.
---
Game is totally fucked up.
---
Rorquals should be gone NOW. if you want minerals, get back to exhumers.
---
It will take YEARS, MANY YEARS to drop that titan numbers without rorquals. Its just wrong
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMSHvgaUWc8
---
I can point you in the direction of several other F2P games where you can buy a subscription. They're still F2P games though
---
Like WWB?
---
I think that can be done.
---
Would probably be better with a mazimum mass for how many caps can jump into a system that would also make a more strategic element in who springs caps first, and that it can only be s small reindorcement force rest have to go other systems and gate the rest of the way, but 100% such a system aswell would be used by major blocks to deny small groups and curb stomp them.
---
Don't worry, when you do, they'll join you.
---
How would you counter 1000 subcaps? Maybe ewar? Bombing runs? A counter-comp? Brawl them if they're long range? Kite them if they're short range? Split them with bubbles? Boosh them apart? Shoot their anchor? Split your damage more efficiently? Lots of possibilities. 
---
Titans are immune to all of that, so they take practically no skill to use and can't be countered outside of bringing more titans. 
---
It was obvious 3 years ago that this is where we would end up. I don't know why only Goons fully embraced this meta. Skill U reluctantly did when they moved out of small gang and WH stuff to become nullsec landlords with a super fleet, but (surprise) this meta was as shit as we all expected so now they've quit. 
---
At the end of the day individual player skill is *the only* advantage a smaller group can have over a larger one, and thanks to the way supers are designed it doesn't mean anything at all.
---
The fact that you can dock it, anybody can build + rorquals its the recipe for disaster.
---
Titans should not be allowed to be docked
---
You might be more familiar with the acronym "RWT". Most game communities seem to use the term "real-world trading", a term that covers any exchange of in-game items for real-world items; including currencies.
---
Passive moon mining required towers to be deployed across a wide area, and did not scale at all with increased members. This allowed members to focus almost entirely on PVP if they so desired. Yeah with the stupid cyno highways at the time there were some big moon empires, but that's not the fault of moon mining mechanics.
---
Compare this to rorquals, which can be contained within a single region for pretty much infinite members, scaling almost linearly with increased members. These rorquals are simply a time-sink for members, forcing them to focus on PVE primarily, resulting in less PVP overall.
---
Well that's a way of looking to what the imperium achieved, in a way the come back is impressive (at least for someone neutral to that).
---
In another way, how and where this meta lead the game is a worrisome in more that one aspect.
---
(I use the imperium but legacy is similar and the others are way smaller)
---
and than sell vargur and paladin , and just buy rattle + some beer
---
Literally a prime example of what he just said.
---
Stfu fuckin retard
---
Use your mind bullets.
---
It's probably pretty high
---
and THAN u just use dread in c5
---
I doubt whatever put together some of your ideas can be fixed by opinions, but ok. When I get home from work I'll give you a more detailed analysis of your points.
---
Yeah, and at that point, you get 3000+ accounts into one system and either the node crashes or the game experience is as enjoyable as being dismembered with a plastic spoon.
---
This is my new favourite copypasta
---
Yeeeeeah, it's not worth much but hey it's SOMETHING. If they made it so it dropped plex one in 10 times vs 1 in 200\~300 it wouldn't be nearly as bad.
---
Ah, the old fleet of frigates argument.  In what other way are they relevant to the discussion of the now minor differences between the t1 vexor and the faction version?  See I only brought price into it because we were already talking apples to apples.  Albeit one of those apples is a little shinier than the other.  Here you are with a handful of marbles...
---
The whole complex is bugged. The structure that is supposed to spawn to drop the item only spawn after downtime and one hour after it's been destroyed. 
---
After that it dosent spawn anymore that day.
---
Naturally this item is being farmed by some "russians" with a MTU  and a hyperspatial gank macharial that  alpha the structure then has the item pulled into an MTU.. 
---
Been bugged for years but CCP dosent care to fix it...
---
This right here is exactly what's wrong with this game
---
All of the slides we look at on Project discovery have a maximum of 30ish days. Which means we're almost always looking for "hot Jupiters" for reference Mercury goes around the sun every 88 days. 
---
But what we do still matters, because if 1 planet is on the same orbital plane as earth that means the rest of the planets in that system should be as well. so they can focus their efforts on those systems.
---
.... Must get level 5000 ....
---
No not at all.
---
There is almost no difference in old afk moon mining and new afk moon mining by goons today. Both are afk and the second one is safe to 99% because of the umbrella.
---
The only difference is, that now you almost cannot kill the citadel because of reinforcement timers and damage caps.
---
Also he stated multiple times that his playstyle is not the one true playstyle and everyone should do it, what he meant is that ccp patched away all other options. Now the only possible way is the goon way, it is just to strong because n+1 got buffed hard. Also his playstyle was around pvp, he didn't bother to mine moon materials but others could stop him and his alliance if they kill the pos. And he had to defend it and maintain it. 
---
So please stop this passive aggressive shit
---
NSA says hi
---
but you even won't kill a prot with that
---
They can't even kill a tanked capital.
---
I understand you but i dont agree on the odea.
---
Just wanted to say that I love the way you respectfully handle the sometimes not-so-nice criticism given to your list. I'm not yet that deep in eve, but I respect how you handle these issues.
---
Yes, no extra information is shown compared to what you can do by yourself with the XML, it's just easier to use the tool to do it. Same thing as overview packs with different colours or whatever for the tabs.
---
partly true, carriers and supers have huge range cause NSA and titans and dreads have 300km range. The reason why you can see a dread 400km away from your keepstar undock is because your keepstar has like 100+ km radius, for you the dread is 400km but for the dread the keepstar is less than 300
---
I never knew about that, I'll give that a shot on my next attempt! Thanks!
---
Don't you like surprise mechanics?
---
There‚Äôs a down side to doing that, I‚Äôve done something similar more than once but if you don‚Äôt sell the item because no1‚Äôs retarded enough to buy it you‚Äôve just wasted billions on the brokers fee, from that point on I separated out my wallet so I didn‚Äôt have the isk there to make the same mistake again
---
Probably still sore from The Little Asshouse That Could.
---
There is no physical way of fighting Titans once they get into the triple digits. There is no fun in bothering either, those fights tend to take the entire day, run at a painfully slow pace, and not really accomplish that much. Shit's just boring and pointless.
---
Awesome, much appreciated; we're still working on it but fingers crossed, we're getting there.
---
Lol I had a guy fat finger buy order Drone Capillary Fluid from me for 2,620,300/unit. I made 167m off 25m worth of inventory.
---
overreaction aside, probaly
---
Yip, it's a bugged item, or should I say an exploitable item. The same group farms the structure that drops the item immediately after downtime when it respawns and exactly an hour later. So unless you buy it from them, you will have to figure out how to be quicker than them.  
---
Freya Navy I believe is one of the toons that farms the site with a few gila alts to clear the room to unlock the acceleration gate into the complex. Their machariel is hyperspacial fit with ascendancy implants and warp accelerators with faction sensor boosters, so good luck getting into the site and shooting the structure before them.
---
They barely managed one region by now I assume they will call it a day soon. If they want to kill all of panfams space they won't be done before winter at this rate.
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and delete Goon minerals before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
&gt;eve 2019 , not RMTing
---
are you for real? tell me you are botting at least or skillfarming some shit
---
This does bring a smile to my face
---
Maybe they should focus their PvP on something other than miners and their structures
---
most of them can't handle the mechanical skills necessary and won't put in the effort to learn them. it's easier to cry about it then actually learning it
---
They do in null. Sov warfare, small/large gang fights, additional resource acquisition, and the list goes on.
---
the only group that can reasonably catch up is already strategically blue to them.
---
You are really living the cringe comments, am I right?
---
They should just ask for active Moon beacons to be added to the agency window like cosmic signatures were.
---
why not though? cash-out and re-create accounts. ccp are slow as f
---
Got any good rattle fits? Then altought it is expensive ship
---
Would you like to 1v1 your prot with my golem.
---
By no means would I expect a single prot to jump on a Golem, but you are incredibly wrong in your statement.
---
tbh man, killing rorquals may as well be structure bashing at this point. they have their own on-demand reinforce timer.
---
Still more expensive than a VNI.
---
Tldr we lost to literal disabled monkeys
---
What you suggest then for soloing on c3-4 space?
---
I lost?
---
use a rattlesnake
---
more dps and cheaper
---
Gotcha. Welp /shrug
---
Can‚Äôt cyno in my plex!
---
yea but people are dumb and like to light right on top of you
---
Yup, eve 2019. Bots and nothing else. Went to facwar, saw mostly bots and people docked up hiding from 8 retris. Didn't bring logi, didn't bring bullshit, just a bunch of point kiting frigs with some links and defensive webs. Only thing that wanted to fight us was arty cynabals, to which we said no thanks. We were being REALLY cheeky warping to plex gates at 0, sliding plexes, trying to take whatever winnable fight we found. We could have easily eaten shit to brawling merlins or something even. There was a dozen or more things they could have formed that would have made me stay on grid, but no. It's 2019. Helldunks, blueballs, and bots.
---
Anyone renting in Period basis is not paying rent to our enemies. That a good end result.
---
Contact Sadus for setting up a rental agreement. Period Basis is the cheapest rental space with easy access to the 1DQ1 market.
---
There is the problem you will always deny, all players that adapted to the meta that only multibox mining for multiple hours gives you a chance to be relevant even in the slightest way are all in one group (or its subgroups) already. All the other players are not, and only have the chance to clear the street when your train rolls in, maybe grabbing of a few stragglers or ganking the left-alone turbokrabs that even do not deploy. The problem of the current meta is, that there were alternatives for people that actually play 100% of their online time tabbed in and active and these are patched away since 2017, what leaves this type of player with 2 possibilities: Quit or generate ingame income by selling PLEX bought with cash. This is the source CCP imagined to provide for all the ISK&gt;PLEX&gt;subbed Rorqal-Alt-Accounts, they just forgot to think about what happens when this group nopes out and not enough PLEX reach the market ... things like PLEX prices despite huge sales and free-PLEX actions (Galaxy-Packs etc) reaching 4.5 mio ISK might happen .... ooops
---
yea being able to lock a think you then MJD on top of is nice
---
Last time I checked rattle is 400m, while Kronos is at 200m
---
Oh people are adapting all right. PCU dropping through the floor.
---
I hate to tell you chief, but your nostrils should line up with the width of your bottom lip.
---
This is spin time for facts. The Imperium fought for over 3 months straight,in the Casino Bee war, and they lost big time. They, along with their slice of humble pie, went to Delve and rebuilt themselves into a formidable, tight-knit group. Now they're back and they are looking for a fight. (spin it anyway you want). Panfam can sit on their asses and get their shit kicked-in every Summer by the Goons/Imperium or they can go to Delve and fight.  It's their choice. Right now I'd say that PanFam is evolving into nothing more than a whipping boy for the rest of eve. Say what you will about the Imperium but remember this they will fight you. Win,Lose,or Draw! They just don't care.
---
CCP got him.
---
Those "Do not RMT" signs are posted for a reason.
---
I am average and I am stupid. All hail the swarm.
---
I don't see the problem if they have a concentrated group effort. You need a group to fight a group.
---
[you should probably check again.](https://evepraisal.com/a/mqhfw)
---
but is it 7 days ?
---
By any chance if you find 2 spare gates, Stain could actually use this new connection.           
---
Thx
---
Level of Detail (turning a high res model to a low version at distance) has been a gaming standard for a couple decades now.
---
Oh.... I think I just bought it and ignored the 1 before 200. Rip wallet
---
You completely missed the afk alt portion.
---
Kronos are T2 gallente Battleship and they cost 1.5b per hull
---
maybe you are thinking of the megathron?
---
Something something deleted boot.ini again?
---
&gt; CCP should just remake the site to either be much much much harder to run (considering the value of the +8% armor implant), instance it with much tougher rats, or simply remove it and make an epic arc or something. It is silly that a group has optimized the site to such a point where you require a fleet of 10 people or alts to even compete with them.
---
Absolutely not. A large portion of Eve Online's gameplay is around dominating sources of resources. Nerfs should not be aimed at a group just because you don't like them. They've found their niche, they dominate it, and they deserve the profit from it.
---
Don't like it? Go fight them for it. That's the point!
---
&gt; Not to mention the other static complexes in system are farmed by afk gilas as the rats periodically respawn so no need to even move, its like highsec vni ratting for them.
---
If this is in lowsec that should be easy kills. If in highsec, this is actually a violation of the EULA (at least it was last time the subject came up). Fire up your T3s or file a ticket.
---
Marauders are cancerously slow in C5's. They eat C4's though, 400m/h before logistics
---
May the swarm rise again
---
 ~~lookboxes~~ surprise mechanics
---
nope I am a stupid white knight, 3 subbed accounts wit CC since 2007, never botted, never RMTed, never PLEX subbed, never injected SP that were not from one of my 3 Accounts .... I have lost the game at least when Lifeblood came out, the only reason the game hasn't lost me is my tight knit group of elderly trolls and tryhards, the grey and thin hair is strong with us .... meh
---
Oh shit lmao, I thought it was 2019 and the game died yesterday, and then the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that... nope lol still here, still dying - as usual.
---
Mistakes were made, guess I gotta fit this for K space agents...
---
fighting  cheters meh. they  exloit site to obain item... same as zimse exploit and inder eploit
---
i'm unsubbed . would not fight anyone, who is fitted and sitting still just to fight me .
---
you either has a good ratting fit and poor anti-cruiser pvp fit , or good pvp fit with pain-in-the-ass ratting.
---
if you managed somehow  make decent pvp\\pve fit for a 3 bil with 1.5bil pod i don't really care
---
That feeling when NPCs get more pings than you
---
No, it will get them mining ship kills
---
The system is a highsec island, you can even high them unless you want to suicide gank.
---
there is blood raider lore about it
---
Huge thinking face emoji, eve =\= real life
---
I mean that's technically PvP üòõ
---
Keep it in mind for Phase 2 then ;)
---
I do not want to be a Goon. I have a shredded, musclebound 6‚Äô5‚Äù 225 lb physique, so Goons beg me to join them, but I would never do it. The only circumstances in which I undock my titan and oil up are for hotdrops (no fax, just me and multiple NCPL dudes). I also don‚Äôt have the time for shit like that. I own(ed lel) 12 Keepstars in multiple systems, and have a partial stake in 3 Palatine Keepstars (though I‚Äôve never docked there). I was a PIRAT wardeccer in Jita too, so it‚Äôs safe to say that my corpse hangar is already full.
---
My schedule is so jam packed that I often find myself utilizing hotdrops in place of cardio. I hotdrop, keeping my heart rate between 130-150 at all times, rather than spending 30 minutes of my valuable time camping gates. Intense PvP, hardcore training, a perfectly managed injector protocol, and perfect diet allow me to maintain 7% snuggly rating year round, even with rampant drug abuse. I love Drop.
---
My diet is managed by my chef, Vince, and my dietician, Hedliner. They work together to ensure my pod receives the exact amount of each macronutrient and micronutrient it needs. I have mentioned their names to point out that I regularly fuck Vince and Hedliner, sometimes together. I have between 1-3 NCPL line-members at any time, and every line-member I sling yogurt on is objectively an 8.5 or higher (though I rarely dip below 9.2). Vince is a 9.5, while Hedliner is just an 8.6.
---
Don‚Äôt post such boring uncontested bashes. Some people may have Olympia-worthy titan fleets, but I have too much fucking to do and money to make to spare time for ‚ÄúBurn the North fleets‚Äù. Downvoted :thumbdown::skin-tone-1:
---
Fucking cringe posting that CAOD shit in 2019 lmao
---
&gt;The system is a highsec island, you cant even fight them them unless you want to suicide gank.
---
Then they would have to suicide gank you to stop you from competing, otherwise it's just a race.
---
That seems perfectly fair to me.
---
EA is
---
How does that even make sense? Finish your coffee next time before you post.
---
Emphasis on "tanked" :eyes:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/55857640/

Look for tutorials on rushing FW L4 missions, afaik it's one of the most profitable way to make isk.
---
So is 0.01 ISK wars in Jita ;)
---
No but any ship that has an RF timer is inherently wrong for EVE Online
---
That's super special elite PvP üòÇ
---
Regression testing is your friend.
---
I unsubbed after the game got stale, then found I didn't give a shit about joining fleets either so uninstalled outright, figured I could at least keep up with things via Reddit
---
Little did I know the subreddit would get dull AF too
---
Fastest way to **win** EvE is with a little help from CCP. Hell, it's what Gigx did. RMT can be worse!
---
^/s
---
Lol keep it this way for a week or so and let the panic set in
---
I wish you would learn to stop posting
---
name checks out.
---
But you are comparing 1 VNI vs 3 Vexors? Or did I misunderstand something?
---
It makes about as much sense as pos code.
---
goons had the strategic resource of humans that unlocked its potential when skill injectors came around, they went from drake fleets to titan fleets
---
Too long didnt read
---
Only in price, the rest is 1 to 1.
---
It wasn't me. I just wanted to buy an Ark and checked the price history.
---
Yeah, got it now. Shame on me then.
---
ehh, i had in game , but unsubbed\\uninstalled atm .  but i can give you a hint, - 
---
active tank, mid grade crystal, drop mobile depo when you expect heavy damage incoming, and refit after for dps . for emergency use overheat \\boosters is something goes wrong. Cruise missile ftw
---
Some true ratting fans maybe could fit some passive regen\\under 700mil fit idk
---
If we break it down to fun per isk frigs are the way to go.  :)
---
That's not true, no.  If every other group combined they wouldn't be vastly inferior.   They would outmatch Goons in subs.  In supers they'd probably equal them.  That is to say, what Goons could field in a CTA.  Remember there are lots of alts in Goons and some of us who have Supers don't multibox them with subcaps, or even together.  I'd never fly a Nyx and an Avatar at the same time, for example, as fighters need babysitting.  I would multibox an Avatar and an Apostle though.  
---
Anyway the point is it's not so one-sided as you think, if you assume the rest of null decided to join forces.
---
If we didn't then the other side would show up with even numbers or better in a TZ they decided on, right? Maybe they would win.
---
Cmon its my 1st post and u want me to stop already!!! not fair xD
---
Love the ff/edit show!! Now we need one with a nice music :)
---
Sorry, but collecting the moon harvest of a lowsec region in DST was much more active and risky gameplay than Rorqual mining supported by scripts, bots and umbrella-enabling mechanics will ever be. What exactly is active gameplay when watching a Netflix series tabbed out until NEAR2 pings some neckbeard wh pvpers disturbing your peaceful resource collection ?
---
You can always try asking about salvaging in local chat in a missioning area.  I'm sure there are a number of people who wouldn't mind having a salvager follow behind them in mission pockets.
---
They should just relocate the chip site to lowsec, then we can see about "fair"
---
Like 5b.
---
This could be the most moronic thing that has ever been posted to Reddit ever.
---
I award you no points.
---
I wish I could, but I have to alarm clock for these too üòî
---
&gt;They should just relocate the chip site to lowsec, then we can see about "fair"

I mean then you're just going to cry that they kill you 10v1, like you did in your earlier post lol
---
I remember when the Rorq change happened it was mind-boggling to me.  I was quite happy sitting mine in a POS handing out boosts.  I'd still be happy with it if it had panic, sat in belt, handed out boosts and did compression.  I absolutely don't need it to mine at all to be a good and useful ship.
---
But isn't it too late?  If you stop Rorqs mining today, right now, you'd pretty much crystalise in-place the current strategic balance.
---
I don't think you've missed anything
---
We lost

If this is your 2nd, the man has a point.
---
Most of us have RL jobs.
---
Boat was saying they're gonna go for geminate too
---
it's like less than 12 freighter that got ganked in the last week. Do you think 1 kill every 12 hours+ is too much?
---
2) a bigger fighter bay for wyvern/aeon would give them a better role
---
also reducing fighter bay on nyx/hel to negate their damage bonus would just be better (imo) 
---
4) bc still killable with bombs. hac's with adc or a good t3d support fleet kills most bomb runs. together with your adc nerf maybe a good start?
---
5) maybe drug/booster for alpha chars to enhance scan strength etc 
---
or give them 1-2 skilllevels on "scanning"
---
exploration is a good start for them and always fun 
---
8) yes with the support reduction it would just get "weird" like 3 lr, 1 light, 1 support. maybe get some more feedback to that one
---
14) still think a "inject immunity" would be a good start for this problem. sp loss = isk loss and most people flying those dont care much about isk.

Broken mechanics are justified because I am not out-doing the current mechanic exploiters, nice, why not relocate the site to lowsec, then at least we could have an *honourable* lowsec fight :D

grr goon pubbies, do not worried, you managed to elect Mar5meca\_Gold to the CSM. He will surely end the goon menace by making sure that supers are gankable by 2 tech 1 frigates! Also, he will make war on emergent gameplay, like the creative use of diamond rats... unless of course, it works towards killing off the Imperium,  :D

inb4 you fit your Kronos with 2 Large armor reps and consider your life choices
---
Gilas are better if not afk and quite possibly as good if afk. The drones are much faster then heavies. You can fairly easily fit a rack of nicely bonused rapid lights as well and that pushes the gila dps up to 700 and it really speeds up killing the small stuff.

It was entirely PVP fit, it was okay to rat with, definitely not the best, but ratting wasn't the priority. Approximately a 3b fit, with a 1b pod I think, low grade crystals and fairly cheap missile related implants for the rest of the pod, if memory serves.
---
Neutral, never associated with any null group. But after having PanFam come into HighSec and grief my friends, family and structures for years, it's nice to see it happen to them now. :-) Misery comes full circle. Goons/Imperium as you were, keep up the good work. PanFam deserves the shit storm you are dropping on them.

Just to correct you, FIFA card system was introduced in 2010. The first observed lootbox system was a gachasystem in Maplestory in 2004. One of the first loot *box* systems came from a chinese mmorpg called "Zhengtu" in 2007.

You got me wrong, I mean NC/PL are the elite!

They drop supers on ibises because they can! They are elite!
---
They don\`t care about allies as they can be farmed! They are elite!
---
They don\`t care about renters, those are only cows to milk! They are elite!

They can go to Providence and helicopterdick the residents there! They are elite!

They extorted HS players with impunity! They are elite!

They don\`t recruit miners and industrialists! They are elite!

This conflict must to go away quietly, so ppl may not notice it ... we want to remind every1 that NC/PL are the elite!
---
can you read? the lazyness was mentioned in collusion with scripted and botted activities, not with sub. And while it is neat for you that you are not depending on PLEX prices, a big chunk of the Rorqual-Accounts - that are the only reason for CFCs advantage atm - do.
---
quantity has a quality of its own

Oh sorry!!! Trying hard to improve...!!!

Ill try to be better xD

You can't sell your account for real money btw
---
Interesting perspective.  I seem to recall WWB a bit differently.  You all occasionally stopped by to fight while using Co2 as a meat shield until they got tired of it ... then you all docked up in lowsec to evac.
---
Only issue I see is the no respawning part.
---
Other than that, this is same in every highsec site, you can't legally shoot them, only race them. Of course you could just gather a few gank Taloses.
---
But I don't really see validity in your complaint that you can't beat a group that knows what they're doing solo.

I fucking approve

To be fair, ship mining could be less scalable through member numbers if systems generated less minerals and whatever else.
---
At that point the difference between relying on automatics which aren't part of your diehard-PvP crowd or on miners which aren't that as well.
---
Ofc you would have to manage that crowd somehow, but if there was less resources spawning within given area, you would need less krabs. At that point I'm sure an Alliance can muster a few folks capable of organizing mining and other stuff like that.
---
Like, I know Goons are really strong and it‚Äôs a combination of their industry capabilities / recruitment and member retention...

Since January 2019 online concurrent player numbers have been falling like a rock. The only break coinciding with ccp‚Äôs log in promotion. As soon as the promotion was done the numbers started falling again. The numbers are now at their lowest point since 2007. There is no logical way anybody can say this game is in a health position where more and more folk are logging out and just not playing. In fact it is important to remember that this player logout is happening in the face of a brand new update.  Normally new updates bring in players, not drive them away.   In short the game is broken and ccp seems to be making it worse.

An interesting fact is if a titan released a wrench just before it hit warp speed the wrench would impact with more energy than the doomsday, at a guess

I think current sotiyo loot mechanic should be change to current ESS one. So you need to spend minute or so in bubble before opening the wreck. Solves all problems of ninja looting.

Yes persistence, also spelled "infinite high number of anoms and krabbing for 2 years recruiting everyone so you can destroy a whole region or two unoppose with no fun at all"

Wait I think I got the amount of letter wrong.

Falcon back to VETO pirating ?
---
It depends actually, a couple of months ago it actually wasn't profitable because all of the big players bought PLEX and extractors when they went on sale and the price crashed, so they could sell injectors at a lower price than what was profitable if you bought extractors at that moment. For small time farmers (like those who maintain a few alts using skill farming), it cost a few hundred mils per account to PLEX during those months. It's only recently that prices stabilized so that it is now profitable to skillfarm.

Gankers were just scared of Triglavs, lets see next month and how much Trig Incursions will hpen around Jita. Until now all Trig Invasions I stumbled over were less than 5 jumps from Jita, so maybe that is some kind of reverse approach to limit Freighter ganking? *tinfoil*
---
Life isn¬¥t about choices and consequences? And in a sand box you think it dosnt really matter? There¬¥s many ways to play the game and in each way we succed or we fail, and even when we fail theres always a lesson to be learn. Eve is hardcore because we pay a lot sometimes for our mistakes... I start to be worried when people keeps making the same errors and blaim others... :D Makes some sense to you?
---
I don't recall posting about this or crying about a 10 v 1, unless you are referring to the point I made about them suicide ganking if you interfere, which I would like to think is quite different.
---
Mushrooms attack the keepstar. 100% organic content
---
It should be in Delve, because you always put the best loot near the end boss.

There are NPCs that warp regardless of scram/disruptors? I didn't know that :P. I guess my question would also apply to that.

Because for the vast majority of ships fitting is what holds them back

How can you have capital guns and NSA? Dude was literally claiming that cap guns can hit 400+ km.
---
Also even for carriers it has nothing to do with NSA, their base lock is well above 300k. Carriers, supercarriers and citadels can lock beyond 300k by the virtue of being a carrier/citadel. Other ships, including dreads - cannot.
---
Please enlighten us. 
---
You obviously don't understand why you are wrong, but I'm guessing it's gonna be fun to see you try to be right at all costs.
---
Bombers, anti-capital fucking bombers would solve that shit right there
---
Guess both the bumping machs and freighters are equally scared of the Triglav gate camps.
---
I wonder if there is a factor that attracts Triglavs, like active player count or structures in space

Oh.... My
---
to be fair it wouldnt be that clear if we would have stomped goon supers in the same way as today. They still had a lot of them. I think we had more so it is kind a as op told but in another dimention.
---
Submitted a ticket about this myself this morning... Glad it's a known issue. 
---
I thought it was an issue with moving minerals to an alt and then back to my main indy toon. You know, accidental deletion or dropped into a corp hangar by mistake, but they still showed in my asset search window this morning so that wouldn't be the cause. They don't show anywhere else and I couldn't deliver or contract them to bring them back.
---
Don't RMT, just extract all your SP and either sell and convert it to isk/plex or keep hold of them
---
I dont know any military power without a powerfull industrial backbone supporting it ...No Isk no big toys, no big toys its just a question of time that someone will clean the floor with your face. Well for other intities in the game was just about getting money from lotteries or from renting... Some of us had to work hard "playing" the game to achieve some goals. Imagine if during WW2 the USA never had the HUGE industrial production capacity they had...U think they were where are today? Again someone is missing the game hard...
---
We can just get someone from Snuff to like most of this, then Vily will decide he hates the changes now and backpedals on it all.
---
It turns out that there's idiots on both sides.
---
Well enough intentioned I guess eh. Serious question though, what‚Äôs with the -1 support fighter on supers? With the application nerf the only way to really apply to Dictors and cyno frigs w/ Ametats is to Double Dromi them
---
Nice
---
I loved circa 2007/8 when PL was just getting going and we worked with goons to evict the ebil BoB. Some really cool guys and everyone had a blast, as war was chaos back then. 
---
They‚Äôve gone from true ‚Äúblot out the sun with t1 frigs‚Äù to the strongest force in the game, that‚Äôs a pretty cool eve story.
---
&gt; as if recruiting krabs and making dosh out of that wasn't possible.

What do you think the renters were for?

Valhalla awaits

I‚Äôll give you an ice cream for it.

Wow
---
If it was done accidentally in Jita, there is no need to put any 80 bills orders - the cheapest one on the station is always sold first (disregarding which price you specify), you just give more money to a person, whose order is cheapest.
---
why would they despawn them?
---
Those renters seem to be a lot of use in defense of the region.
---
"Miscellaneous" is a ship maintenance array, just in case someone is wondering

So they loosened it, did they learn to tighten it? I wonder if they will ever Lose their empire

&gt;Yeesh, smugposting about bashing an undefended citadel is SOOO 2016
---
Goons shooting structures up north ATM. No time to gank freighters
---
Sadly given plex prices bots will happen. This is becoming the main way to play. One account is the main (human account). Used for the things player wants to do. Player feels need to plex account, and has second machine. Makes an alpha account, injects to vni, and bots it to pay for main account plex while main account plays. Now a reasonable solution is to lose plex from the game completely as we have paid and unpaid accounts. CCP would just have to change NES to a straight cash shop where skins and such cost real money. They don't however because 1 bot can be used to plex 2 accounts if 23/7 botting. So guy makes multiple bots and buys more plex, which drives plex up, which neans more people buy plex (more money to CCP) which means more bots. CCP benefits from bots and kills off so many to say look I did something every month, while raking in cash because a single account player can't afford to play without buying plex.
---
Opportunity cost approx 15 tril lost isk in delve 2 tril net negative 13 tril on deployment. Fun from bashing structures priceless.
---
Yeah. I thought it funny there was still one of those out in space in 2019 so I included it in the tally.
---
PB has a lot of bots
---
but anecdotally, I've had at least 2 solid fights there in the last 3 months, and almost had a 3rd
---
which is 3x more good fights than I get in half the rest of null
---
they're bots, but there's enough human involvement for hilariousness to happen.... such as the GLD4U rolling minokawa that is now permanently safelogged in a C5 somewhere... good luck friend!
---
So the ultimate end game of EvE is POCO bashing in a fleet of 200 titans trying to align with nothing shooting back?  Sad.
---
I actually expected more like a bunch of monkeys, a few typewriters and an unlimited amount of time...
---
i didnt see and hear a single NC//PL member scream since the show started. That is the point. We know we cant defend so we do other shit like whaling in DELVE or hop on a train and kill Test-Caps when we have a chance to. 
---
Seriously no one give's a shit about what you do atm except your higher ups telling you how devastated we are... fact is i did not lost a single ISK during your deployment. Maybe alliance lose income from rent but also dont have to pay anything except some SRP crap which i think dont hurt as you wish it would hurt.
---
And iam not trying to shittalk you just stating honest facts from my pov
---
the whining by nc. and their pets that our overwhelming victories don't count because nc. wet themselves rather than fight back are perhaps the most hilarious part of this war
---
Nothing to see here, only some glass.
---
NC can spin this every way they want, but it's getting a bit sad now.
---
It's like the kid you hit on the playground holding in it's tears and running away to cry secretly in shame, hoping this  all goes away and nobody will remember. But in fact everyone now knows: If you hit that kid. he's going to cry like a coward.

For your awareness, currently sisters combat scanner probes function exactly identical to regular core scanner probes in terms of strength. There is no need to buff them as they are already just as strong. Whether that‚Äôs a bug, or is intentional does not matter to me, but this is reason that most competent scanners for large WH groups use combat probes while scanning regular signatures as well. There‚Äôs no drawback to doing so.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a comparison of ships destroyed on each side as well....
---
Been dying for 16 years now.

Imagine thinking fair fights have any place in Eve.
---
When initiating warp to a site (not actually warping and landing in the site) it despawns I believe 3 days later.
---
When you are done fighting the structure menace in the north would you be so kind to cull their exploded population in the South too?
---
he is not getting it that he already called himself and his loved m8 dumb :)
---
As a concerned citizen I'd like to add my voice to the fire and say absolutely fucking not
---
Can't upvote this enough!
---
We need a cataclismic event to clean all this mess worst than 13 y/o kids need porn.
---
Gevlon Goblin, is that you?
---
the whining of GSF and their pets that MBCs overwhelming victories dont count because GSF wet themselves rather than fight back are perhaps the most hilarious part of WWB/CW
---
I believe this is the kind of statement that most counselors would reply to with "Who are you trying to convince?"
---
Would you get more skill points for training one skill from level 4 to lvl 5 thats takes 9 days to train. or from multiple different skills for example 9 of them on different levels and taking 1 day each to train.
---
that would require nc. to undock, which isn't really their thing these days
---
There is a *slight* difference between RL and Eve. RL conflicts isn't suppose to be fun. Eve is. Assuming your afk rorqual mining is "hard working" is cute btw. Most of the work done in the north pre current invasion was done by your SIGs + INIT, you know the actual hard working PvPiers , basically burning down Gotg and submiting them into a pet.
---
If you're having fun bashing afk structure with your titan, all fine, just don't sperge on us the philsophy you masturbate at to make yourself feel like a pro champ for being a krab.
---
Idk, that would probably take more than a simple infographic. Also, you don't want to do the exact opposite, to paint every autistic person as unable to live their life on their own as well.
---
I don't. But the point I'm making is that's why panfam are not fighting, because they can't beat the blob.
---
We can only hope.
---
But please don't let them fit cynos, we all know too well how that ends.
---
That should be easy I think there have been like 3 fights FWIW
---
wah mommy make the bad goons stop crushing us and talk about our victory from three years ago that is now rather hollow given the curbstomping goons are giving to nc.
---
how about we fix citadels
---
/u/ChribbaX/ inventory just became orders of magnitude more valuable
---
My memory may be playing tricks on me but we had a pretty strong OP cadence when we were stuck in Saranen. Granted we were getting our asses handed to us more often than not but we were undocking all the same. I remember watching all those SRP wallets circle the drain as it played out. We did however keep the supers out of it in an attempt to not lose them all.
---
I mean he is a spobrain but rorquals are targets in space and the isk flows through the linemembers. Not a prestigious activity but if you enjoy your corpmates on comms I can see it bearable. But for medium size purely pvp corps whose members are already established of course it was a huge blow and pretty shitty shift as it removed the incentives to conqueir aov.
---
A lot of these seem kind of arbitrary and you should consider whether they are really warranted before pushing them (cause ccp likes to make "a quick balance pass" and not touch it for 12 months). Also, 119: not needed. Instead, defang athanors while people are mining so there's some space for gang fights there.
---
So if you live in a different timezone this is balanced because you should take the time of to be able to run this ??? 
---
Cause spawn mechanics aren't broken????
---
Does the MER matter or not Im getting whiplash
---
Samesies. Release the report!
---
No matter where we go, they won't fight.  If we went back to Delve to "protect ratters", they would somehow claim victory and fuck off back to Tribute.  Face it.  NC. are a bunch of has beens, and a few never was'.  They are completely scared to fight.  "Oh, but it will be a massacre".  
---
So?  
---
Isn't that what this shitty game is about?  Or is the propaganda they have been pushing since their creation now thrown out the window because the same thing they did to GSF a few years ago is now happening to them?
---
NC. is done.  There is no coming back from this embarrassment.
---
cool, i guess...
---
yeah no shit, it's nearly like it was the jab
---
:D
---
well written!
---
It‚Äôs different because I know common sense law over video game ToS from something I haven‚Äôt even really played or read into much.
---
....and?
---
I think that‚Äôs the reason why there‚Äôs so many today. It used to be they were called coffins because the pilot driving them would have to keep sitting in them because if they got out of the thing someone else could get into it. You‚Äôd need an alt who was also a Titan-capable pilot to take the place of the pilot.
---
Now that they can be docked you can have one, or more, because you can now leave the ship without being afraid somebody will steal it.
---
It should be at the opposite of the galaxy from delve so that a good chunk of the player base finally discovers there are other regions in New Eden.
---
yeah we fought back as hard as we could, just not with the expensive supers that our enemies wanted to kill and that formed the backbone of our current supercap dominance.
---
nc. is busy wetting hoping that if they urinate on themselves enough we'll get disgusted and leave them alone
---
Looks good to me, 1M SP for 5 bucks, 1 time buy.
---
you're an idiot
---
also im not in any nullsec alliance and often make fun of them on this here message board
---
The rest of Eve learned something too. When you got someone on the ropes you pursue them and make sure they are dead. Instead of letting them run off and rebuild.
---
A rattle hull costs a third of a Kronos hull....
---
it actually doesn't. citadels and tz tank could be improved dramatically with minimal new development. the hard bit is getting ccp to commit to that vision of eve.
---
how many delve-minutes are these 4.2 trillion isk?
---
And about goons helping out eve, good joke, like pest saying without it, humanity would be overpopulated centuries ago...
---
Your concept of the timeline here is pretty nonsense.  
---
&gt;No, you had three major fights then SWORDFLEETS for maybe a month while the citadel road to the south was being paved.
---
The big fights pretty much ended with the CO2 betrayal (i.e., the first time their ihub was actually threatened).  That was end of March.  There were big formups after that, but they usually ended with "we're horribly outnumbered, stand down".  Citadel dropping end of April pretty much sealed the deal for us, and we didn't move until the end of July.  
---
&gt;Sion got so mad he called /r/eve "not a community" and it spawned a hilarious but short-lived meme.
---
This was months before the war and unrelated beyond "people were mad at Sion for a long time".
---
will be funny cause nobody is left you can fight with the army you created :)
---
*"Matthew, you stole all my minerals!"*
---
Pssst: your memory is faulty.  We were in lowsec months before Co2 flipped.
---
I can't think of a single video game where selling your account is ok
---
Did you just assume my homophobia?
---
And give all of it to me! :O
---
I will hand it to you, you guys have the secret autism weapon that is DBRB, and he took out claw fleets for a month straight, even if he wiped them. 
---
None the less, they were just "fun" distractions while the citadel highway to the south was being built. As soon as it was done, y'all peaced out along with the super fleet that was totally trapped in 93PI - which was the reasonable thing to do. 
---
The same grand strategy is being used here, the structures were lost, so no point in feeding the super fleet in some "grand" battle when you can use it to rebuild (Assuming Nancy want to actually remain sov-holding entities)
---
and down they will go again, cause empires ever last forever!
---
Bastards. *opens wallet*
---
I really hope we get a Devblog about it.
---
you're an idiot, nubee.
---
Like, they have to leave tether range to de-tether?
---
do you think it took months to drop about ten asshouses?  it, uh, did not.
---
Take two deep breaths and slowly count backwards from 10
---
you are not first dumbass who type about my nick/name.
---
You mean like how PL had the supercapital wrecking ball to beat all other wrecking balls for a decade?
---
If only there was an easily accessible t1 ship class in the game that would serve no other purpose than to shoot other capitals. One that got their insurance nerfed for no reason other than reddit screeching "fuck snuff", even though losing said ship already cost half a bil+ just for a t1 fit.
---
If only that ship class existed, one could boost its damage 
---
or tank so that it would become an actual threat to titans instead of getting absolutely shat on within seconds of sieging.
---
But sadly these ships would let snuff kill low sec even more dead. Surely nerfing apostles will entirely fix the titan problem, just like reddit proclaimed it would. (hint: absolutely nothing changed and never will until dreads receive severe buffs)
---
The lack of respawns  is what causes the issue and the whole bottleneck in the first  place.
---
Also is it fair for ppl living on a different timezone  ever to be able to complete or even having a chance of completing the missing due not being able to play around downtime?
---
Wish CCP would sell stuff like this on their website... I really want one
---
\*YAAAAWWWWNNNNNN\*
---
Idk man all I know is there‚Äôs nothing illegal about it unless the TOS states it. I didn‚Äôt check just made a broad assumption based off how I know other things in EVE worked. If I‚Äôm not allowed to sell for money I‚Äôll either not risk and not sell or feel strapped for cash and just try. Idrc was just curious for a ballpark figure
---
Calm down satan.
---
looks fun
---
You always get the same amount of skill points per second, just higher level skills take more skill points to level up
---
I too like the 'mine to win' eve has turned into
---
nah the order of events is right, the timeline may be a bit compressed though.
---
Sion's sperg was going on during Adversity's Fade campaign, which were, arguably, the first shots of WWB/CW. It's absolutely related because it added fuel to the reddit dumpsterfire.
---
Why faction titans lose the 5x entosis timer ?
---
They are not worried bout ISK War being won
---
when they stay till winter and the delve butchers bill keeps rising in this rate we will have crazy numbers :D
---
agree with this, but imo reducing the top-end time it takes to ref an ihub is just as important. spending an hour reffing an ihub uncontested is just dumb. it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes, the current implementation is insanely grindy.
---
grrrr, gon man bad
---
I mean, why would they do that?
---
Just to not have to scan them each day? Why not just run them?
---
You must be confused.
---
They should just randomize the spawn times
---
How do they differentiate RMTers from people scamming fat fingers?
---
I think this is a satirical account. But anyway, sword fleets lmao
---
Chinese dont know how to play games.

it took months to drop the fortis + organize all the retards + sound more horns and tell everyone the movement plan + even more pings about move ops + actual moveops + secondary moveops + picking up stragglers (Except some that died in funny ways and were ridiculed on here by goon and mbc alike) and so on and so forth.
---
Sounds like a small price to ensure hostile are making exactly 0 isk from their region.
---
Its a sad argument that everything that happens inside Imperium is due to afk mining or afk ratting....U never thought that is possible for that guy that has 10 rorqual accounts have other 3 or 4 pvp accounts and from one side he supports the industry machine and in the other he helps filling the fleets of those sigs u mentioned? Well if u dont know that multiple accounts is allowed in eve and if u dont do it u are been bad over this game xD 
---
Gotgo wasnt becoming a pet from NC\\PL? So been a pet of panfam is good been a goons pet is horrible...Sometimes sides need to be taken to survive. :D Well im just throwing facts over here...for some are unconfortable facts i understand... sorry for that xD Its not about me trying claiming myself as "pro champ"  but its about one entire organization of individuals that were able to work together, not all are able to achieve this with the same level of success. Sorry!xD
---
Returning player, wanted to see what those invasions looked like. Best way to do it: fit a catalyst with 8 salvagers and try to snatch some loot from hard working people in high sec .
---
Warped to a minor conduit, a ratllesnake was alone 100K from the beacon ( thx mjd), smashing a trig. I was not alone, other vultures were at the beacon, starting to burn. In a stroke of genius, I noticed a citadel right in alignment from us. Warped there, then back at 100K. Crossed people on the way back having the same idea. I landed right next to a wreck, started immediatly to salvage it. No one's around ? let's loot it ! 
---
"Humm, I did not know the trig dropped Pith X-Type stuff, sweet !" Only then did I notice that the rattlesnake was gone, and I was actually salvaging it xD . I got the loot and the salvage :d . The killmail for you https://zkillboard.com/kill/77441012/ . I'm sad the dread gurista invul field did not drop :'(
---
they were never yours. They always belonged to CCP.
---
no, there are people genuinely that retarded, but if you call them out on their retardation it's all LOL I WAS JUST PRETENDING TROLLED XD LOLOLOFOFOFO
---
RMTing having been a thing since Everquest, and never having heard of "RWT" until now, I am definitely having a Skinner moment here.
---
What will you do if you ever get your gate?
---
About as much use as the krabs that die during strat ops.
---
Yeah thats fair.  I guess whats missing is the token sub fleets out and about doing things on the reg. Doesnt matter either way nobody gets to tell an Alliance how it has to die.
---
i evaced 6 bil of BS and some Caps a week before you deployed from M-O to a low-sec system 2 out without a scout and lost exactly nothing. During your deployment i still didnt lose a single ISK..... oh forgot i insured a suicide dread which moonwalked out of combat cause downtime came before siege cycle went of... actually you monsters raped 250 mil from ma wallet :( 
---
That fucking dread even logged in and warped of later the day uncontested :(
---
I mean, if you want to call it that, fine, but then there were a shitload more than "three major fights then swordfleets" over that 7-8month timeline.
---
Frankly I wouldn't start off cutting yourself down with saying that the content isn't interesting, because now I believe that and don't think it's interesting. Secondly, you spend a good 40 seconds backhand complimenting Tuskers and fluffing your own ego, before the video even starts. And now we're changing the tone of the video before it's even begun. You do this again at the end of the video. It's unbecoming. Lastly, there is a ton of dead time. Less is more, show vs tell, etc. You could have sped this up while the slow killing was going on or the warping out, y'know, the places where it was entirely uninteresting to see what's going on.
---
Way to avoid an answer. I think players can have just as much input as the devs. Most devs don't even play their own game. We also have a CSM, which clearly suggest they want players to have an input.
---
Botting is also not done to achieve success in the game, it's done to make wealth in real life selling game content. I'm surprised you don't know that. They are a huge stain on this game.
---
If you make some task simple enough to do that only humans can do, most players would be fine with it. Didn't hacking used to be a chance based task? Now it's more intuitive. Same concept needed to circumvent botting.
---
I was not talking about null.
---
For years we have a state where small independent groups got their stuff kicked in until they either quit or join a bigger group.
---
Now we have declining player numbers and most of the people are in big player groups.
---
:surprisedpikachu:
---
Nice! I started a mining alt and am enjoying it! thanks
---
i really hope it ends up with all upgraded sov being dropped.
---
But my minerals didn't spawn. Guess I'll just stay docked today.
---
Send it to me CCP. I will double it!
---
Nice Vid Nyth. Eve needs more small gang content/resources to hopefully expand the gameplay to more people!
---
it's cool &amp; good how the people who whined about goons not using caps to defend Dek in 2016 aren't total hypocrites about undocking to defend Tribute in 2019
---
Loose fitting clothes and pinching / scratching / hitting aid workers is the breakfast of champions!
---
depends on the stats linked to the skills. If you are talking about skills in the same categories, it's the same, as they are all linked to the same attributs. If not, depends :/
---
Ususally, you remap your attributs to match a long term goal (like specialize in trading , or mining etc ... ) If you don't do that, do'nt bother. Look at the skills you need for what you're planning to fly. Need a lvl5 skill ? then learn it
---
no, there really weren't.
---
 Why Goon CEO‚Äôs make such cringy speeches? 
---
But, yeah, gratz on winning EVE to true Goons (its not winning EVE by quitting it, but its not bad).
---
While you are enjoying structure bashes, would you mind clearing the Perimeter area of these structures too?
---
probably cause a lot of current Delvegoons are nubees that were never in Deklein in the first place.
---
People do this for varying reasons, not to clog up the probe scanner, but also to prevent money making of others, but the main reason. Let's say you have a C5/6 farm hole you find another C5/6. You initiate warp to the sites there, they despawn, and respawnn in your own C5/6.
---
If we didn‚Äôt someone else would.  PL having cap superiority is a big reason we lost the casino war. We didn‚Äôt want to lose again.
---
I hear a good chunk of them are at the moment, up north.
---
How dare you, racist Sir!
---
I think at this point yall could just boson off any swordfleets or jagfleets or whatever NC could bring as a token time waster.
---
Maybe instead of taking an uphill fight they should have docked or fit a cyno, like 99 percent of those reddit armchair generals would have.  
---
A scramless Orthrus was all they really had for tackle, so there is really 0 chance of the small stuff dying, as they can bounce around at will, wasting the Orthrus¬¥ clip.
---
Everyone thinks how broken OP LMLs are, but I assure you they don¬¥t apply all that great on untackled MWDing snaked ceptors. An orthrus will struggle to apply 50 percent of it¬¥s total DPS on the Garmur, the Malediction will take around 33 percent. So yeah nah it really isn¬¥t as difficult as people like to believe it is.
---
Due to the absence of any hard tackle the Apoc might as well not been there.
---
Also I am pretty sure they had literally 0 chance to break the Ikitursa, which could just YEET at them.  
---
I think the fact that you won was more down to the fact that the Tuskers¬¥ gang composition was garbage (a scramless Orthrus come on) rather than some amazing plays. Had they had a ceptor of their own and had the Orthrus had a scram it would have probably been a closer call.
---
Honest... he ran out of gas! he--he had a flat tire! He didn't have enough money for cab fare! His tux didn't come back from the cleaners! An old friend came in from out of town! Someone stole his car! There was an earthquake! A terrible flood! *Locusts*! IT WASN'T HIS FAULT, I SWEAR TO GOD!!!
---
yeah, if you had like 5 full fleets, maybe
---
Well since first day its a game of gathering resources to build ships... I dont understand where the elite pvpeers thing their ships come from...Last time i saw CCP wasnt offering titans so someone had to build them! And imagine we never had the need to call highsec industrialists to build them for us!! We managed somehow to build them ourselfs! WOW!!! Let me see i think its also afk work we just magicaly got some bots to build titans for us ... :D :D :D saying this because someone argued that we have titans cause we play the game afk xD
---
what are you talking about? there have been plenty of suggestions and concepts flying around. CCP ignores most of them and half asses the few that make it
---
Illegal in terms of a crime against a state government, no.    
---
In violation of EULA and TOS of that game company, yes.    
---
You won't get arrested and put in jail for selling an acccount, but the game developer/company can use the violation to permanently ban you from all their games and services.
---
lol i tell you some funny thing. 
---
I started reading from the top and your comments gets shittier, the deeper i get into this. I mean ... are you serious?
---
You can enter a state like safe logging but still be able to be logged in, and if you do this you can‚Äôt be bumped off tether.
---
Blops BS sensors could use a buff to bring them in line with the Marshall.
---
I mean its not like ncpl didn't dogpile groups back in the day with the intent to smother them and then harvest all the 'worthy' pilots into their ranks.
---
Its just that the shoe is on the other foot now.
---
Remember the time :ccp: accidentally put the entire universe into a Fortizar?
---
This isn't a plan, this is a list. There's no explanation as to why on any of these.
---
That really sucks. As much as nullbears meme on hiseccers the incursions are the only tolerable pve grind in this game for many. Why would ccp want them to unsub is beyond me. They are not bots they put blingy shit out in space.
---
Code and Miniluv have shut down. It‚Äôs now safe to autopilot 10 billion ISK haulers through space.
---
Flying spaghetti monster, spaghetti wires, spaghetti code.  Makes sense to me.
---
HAH that was hilarious.
---
WOW! VERY cool!!
---
thanks for sharing i‚Äôm sending this to kotaku right now!
---
We didn't have any Fortizars, the first one we ever dropped was in 1-SMEB.
---
Doesn't a pop up box appear for orders way outside the average? Smells fishy.
---
dammit.. have my +1
---
Will definitely work on the editing part of the video to make it more interesting. I think that you're either deliberately refusing to understand my comments or you really missed what I was trying to say. I think the "40 seconds backhand complimenting" that you talk about is just giving context to the fight. I try to highlight the importance of piloting skill in this fight with these comments and talk about how even a group that does pvp a lot can drop the ball really hard. Same goes for the comment about the fight being uninteresting. It's just giving context to what the video is about, which isn't going to be flashy plays or some insane dunking, but going over mistakes that our enemies make and how we capitalize on them.
---
it took a matter of days from the decision to move to the first move op happening.  it did not require months of low-level guerrilla warfare to distract from it; to the extent that helped the moveop it's because that did precisely what it was intended to do: wear out our opponents, so they were less inclined to try to follow us to delve
---
astras*
---
its how a few straggling titans died.
---
could still use it for memes with hole control it be fine. only need to bastion when in need of more tank.
---
the only people wanting bumping off tether to leave the game are shit tier players, stop pretending you're fucking elite
---
Late to the party, but haven't seen this addressed (may have missed it).
---
What's the logic of the RLML changes for WR?  On paper, I guess I see the initial reasoning.  But as a resident of low-class WR for 3 years (total scum), I'm curious to know if your reasoning has any practical foundation.
---
From my end --- I don't use RLML except as a niche thing, even in WRs.  In practice, the change wouldn't change much except kill a pretty friggin' niche strategy that doesn't do much beyond annoy.
---
For whatever reason, seeing this makes me sad.
---
A trig spawn cant kill a mach very fast at all.
---
this basicly was foreseen pre WWB and lead to called war. The dumb shit is we seriously did what we sayed and abandoed each other after evicting goons and didnt follow test south to finish em of and keep clubbing them.
---
And that war wasnt started by Panfam btw. It was started by Lowsec blueing up  and show goons where they can place their programm which they wanted to implement over them.... the most 0.0 alliances came later to the party.
---
When your leadership is full-time EVE/Metagaming neckbeards like CFC, they won't think of the implications of TiDi-Shitfests until downtime to people actually playing EVE just a s a leisure time hobby for a few hrs a week. Same applies to the necessity of then spending 9 of 10 hrs grinding rocks to get there.
---
It's not about the need for resources to build ships, thats a really cool aspect of eve. It's about striking the right balance. When the game requires you to do ever more pve and at the same time makes it harder to do pvp, we're going in the wrong direction.
---
I never even considered the possibility that NC. stopped logging in because of how awesome their lives are now.
---
haha i knew what i was getting before i clicked it :D was in that fleet and comms while it happened :D   
---
AWESOME!
---
IMO, structural and ecosystem changes are more important than ship balance right now, and as such changes usually affect the ship meta anyway, they should take precedence. 
---
That being said, I think you're onto something when you say that easy wins are important, as waiting years for major changes is not going to work. But I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. Here's a link to a one-pager doc I've been throwing around a bit. See what you think:

---
IF IT WASN'T FOR MY MINERALS THERE WOULD BE NO PVP!!!!
---
Doesn't need to be fast. You are facing webs and scrams though
---
But this thread is about them doing it in the same hole they live in...
---
or am I misunderstanding?
---
This is true. no ganking during the war. All bodies must be up north
---
cant remember a casino war.
---
&gt; Its a sad argument that everything that happens inside Imperium is due to afk mining or afk ratting....U never thought that is possible for that guy that has 10 rorqual accounts have other 3 or 4 pvp accounts and from one side he supports the industry machine and in the other he helps filling the fleets of those sigs u mentioned? Well if u dont know that multiple accounts is allowed in eve and if u dont do it u are been bad over this game xD
---
I would really need to undersand how those SIGs are pulling as many numbers in fleet as INIT, a much smaller alliance then. Come face reality the strenght of goons come from rorquals being titans printing machines and the current meta which allows so many people to live in so little space.
---
Does KILLBOARDS matter or not Im getting whiplash
---
Ss someone who is not only autistic but has also worked for a psychologist specialised in this field and worked with other autistic people, it is actually rather accurate.  you could also display it as multiple linear spectra instead of this rainbow bullshit but otherwise...
---
I don't think the rest of eve has nearly 1000 titans, I think your numbers are off
---
I've used the term "RMT" in discussions in the Runescape community, CS:GO trading community, and other areas of the real-money trading community. From experience, if I refer to it as "RMT" someone will chew me out for using an obscure term that no one uses, while if I use "RWT" someone will chew me out for using an obscure term that no one uses.
---
There's no meaningful difference between the two terms, but the fact they both exist means that some people may have heard one but not the other, leading to undue confusion when someone brings up this subject.
---
For a second then I thought you said kugu , but then I realised that died years ago :(
---
GIVE BACK 90% WEB NAO
---
I think you mean Caps and Blobbers.
---
it huuuuuuuuuuuuurts kiiiiiiiiilll meeeeeeeeeee
---
The butcher's bill in Delve is actually more fun to watch.
---
When spaceships?
---
Which groups did they do that too?
---
Man... can ya'll get over it?
---
Works too.
---
What is it with everybody spelling lose as ‚Äòloose‚Äô these days? Loose is a completely different word with a different meaning.
---
Because a line member has any say in what their renters do. Do something constructive instead of ship posting if it means that much to you
---
Why are you so angry about something a stranger wrote on Reddit?  Maybe it's time to do some relaxation breathing techniques?  Or go outside.
---
Did I?
---
you can almost see his horns
---
So if they lost because they were shit why don't they be not shit
---
&gt;aside from "have an e-cyno and be 100% awake at all times" there is no counter to 45 Talos
---
You can't just say "aside from the perfect counter and be competent" and just ignore it.
---
No.  I don‚Äôt do drugs.
---
Would marauders be better or worse if they had a normal jump drive with 90% fatigue reduction?
---
not skill though, lets face it, most of Goons have IQ's that can be tracked on the richter scale.
---
meh
---
Well i "Krab" and i do pvp ...One thing its not incompatible with the other. Theres players that are more pvp oriented and others more on the industry side, well Eve is an amazing game cause allows each pilot to choose what to do...and its the same for all pilots ...so the option and mechanics are the same for all, theres no gold bonus for goons :D
---
meanwhile JF ganks are very high atm in jita, odd
---
Well if goons won't teach their own players how to play the game, someone else might as well.
---
It's summer,  we're rich and - believe it or not - we're having fun. I don't think you'll see us leave until we're done making the North into a desert.
---
Even if some individuals get burned out, it's no problem. It's not like people can't take breaks if they want; there will still be plenty of us on the front. PVEing is less safe in Delve than it usually is, but it's still safer than a lot of nullsec regions, like Malpais.
---
Technically I mined some of those structures so they were free
---
the only thing you crush atm is you REALLIFE by wasting Hours of time in summer and shoot structures and be proud of. Meanwhile other are going to the beach have sex and or partys. When they arrive at home the go to bed or log in grad a ship and kill some stuff in delve or elsewhere.
---
The grand thing here is that NOBODY cares about how many Structures you KILL. And btw listig POCOS there is like counting lost drones when fighting ishtars to boost your own factor... embarresing!
---
The number that deployed and used is grossly inflated.
---
I would pay a hefty sum for someone on CSM14 to address skill injectors. I would love to debate why they dangerous in their current form
---
As an actual autist, I'm going to have to agree with you. I have it easy. I manage to function pretty alright in day-to-day, but, for example, sensory filtering is actually mentally taxing. At the end of a day at work, I shut down for about half an hour to an hour Ina dark, quiet space. If I was much worse at filtering out all that extra sensory input, I'd probably curl up in a ball and start screaming and never stop.
---
Reading this actually made me hurt for some reason.
---
Take my upvote ! I had a good laugth !
---
The NPC frigates scream "WITNESS ME" on comms while directly approaching your Sniper-BS.
---
I count 10 but I can't go higher without removing my shoes so maybe there's more
---
Does this total include schrodinger's rigs again?
---
I do this a lot, especially in hostile enemy territory. Nothing wrong doing things that annoy your enemy.
---
How about you wait until it actually happens. I mean it's not like CCP ever promises anything and then decides to scrap it's plans later on.
---
In 2016 you wernt facing 1k plus titans ? Smart dood ;)
---
say that to the test guy calling out the chinese
---
the only sad in here is me cause i have to think your posting is honest.
---
This has already been posted a couple of times, but thanks for almost keeping up!
---
Do you just assume that we would've played the same way if the enemy comp was different or they fit their ships differently? Eve is about capitalizing on the mistakes of your enemies, which we did. I really fail to see how anyone can say that you can "just bounce garmur and malediction around" to keep orthrus and jackdaw tackled and I stand by my statement that if the comps were reversed, we wouldn't have a problem with killing or forcing the frigates off. The first part of your comment about docking up is really unnecessary - I understand the desire to defend your corp mates, but I don't think there's a need to be so defensive about a video in which I try to objectively look at a fight and not shit on the people I'm fighting.
---
I have read that you no longer live in nullsec for years, then claim to have a KF alt. Both, in the same thread (this one).
---
To be honest, I play with a great bunch of people, and we find ways to have fun in this game. None of them have to do with "scripts" or "bots", but it seems you have the "grr goons" dick shoved so far down your throat you cant see anything else but the short and curlies.
---
I'll let you have the last word on this one. Next time you are on your KF alt, hop on comms, and chat me up. If you aren't a bold faced liar about that, then you already know who we are, and that you are lying through your teeth in this thread.
---
Cheers.
---
No he means raising the extraction limit ONLY.
---
Not raising the Alpha limit
---
Completely bubblefuck it, I hope.
---
I have done this as well probably two years ago and the same group was doing the same thing. I have no real issue with the base idea of competing to get a limited resource to complete the COSMOS missions but this one and a few others are definitely bugged out. It is wildly unfair to only have the two spawns. Increase the spawns rate even just a few more and it would give at least a chance for a person to put together a group to try and force the issue. Sadly I think the COSMOS missions are like some of the oldest and most bugged out code in the game so likely even if CCP actually did look at them it would be to remove it radically alter them. All the same +1 from me.
---
sorry we interrupted your sex-having by destroying 4t of your structures.  guess you'll have to stop having all that sex you're definitely having in order to grind up 4t of isk for new structures.
---
Is this the new copy pasta? Because this should be the new copy pasta.
---
1 salty comment = 1 poco we will kill
---
The Taranis has been scary since long before the ceptors were buffed to have bubble immunity. I mean a frigate that pushes 360 DPS and goes 4km/s is pretty terrifying even if it isn't bubble immune.
---
Also the Hecate has pretty good base speed, and the fact that it can go above 600 dps easily and tank like a bawss means that almost everything that can burn out from it is going to melt before it can.
---
That's probably the only region he directly interacts with regularly since they are currently fighting there. You can't blame line members for not regularly roaming into blue space for no reason.
---
The part about the beach sex parties is absolutely legendary man have an upvote.
---
It's not just giving context. It is going beyond that to compliment yourself while putting down those you fought. Starting any kind of presentation and already cutting it down to be in the realm of 'boring or uninteresting' is a pretty big public speaking stumble. It's classic though so you're not alone, but and you're doing it for what you perceive to be a logical reason. But the effect it has on the audience is that they latch onto that and will see it as boring/uninteresting too, because you just told them it was. A better play is to keep it relatively dry if you are wanting to give context. Since context should be without opinion and the footage being 'uninteresting' is just that. 
---
Lead with the "We dropped out of a wormhole into Fountain and I stumbled across three Tusker bros in an Orthrus, Jackdaw and Pulse-Apoc. Me and Joskastis in his dual-boxxed Malediction moved in to get tackle and start the fight while the remainder of our gang took the hole to catch up". Easy, clean, fully descriptive.
---
Moving on the backhanding:
---
&gt;"I also think they had the tools necessary to win the fight, or at least lose it not as hard, because of the way we trickled into the system. I am not sure what happened on their side, *Tuskers are pretty good pilots*. I just think they didn't know that we are another small gang group, and to *respect* us from the start. So *our piloting kinda threw them off*."
---
&gt;"So yeah this is one of those fights that if you look at the BR then you might think 'we blobbed them, it was super easy, there's nothing the enemy side could have done at all' but if you actually go over what we did, what they did and what they could have done better, I think if the compositions were reversed and we had their ships and both of the gangs played the same way *we would have come out on top as well*."
---
And you're telling me I'm taking these out of context? This is all presumptive and comes off as fluffing yourself. Furthermore, you don't actually give any real analysis on what they could have done better (beyond, the Apoc could have warped). It is mostly a play by play from your own POV which has it's own problems as stated before. If you are going to make those kinds of statements and prop up your piloting skill as more than "just staying alive in our tackle boats", which by the way, is just about the entirety of your analysis that is worth noting, then you're going to need more substance.
---
Impressive! Doing God‚Äôs work.
---
This annoying pop up thingy ppl deactivate bcs it annoys them?
---
Not worth it if you arent already big, or have a couple 10s of billions laying around. But if you are at that point, why bother klicking yourself trough hell everytime to farm sp? You can calculate it yourself, but its not worth it, you pay for the accounts from the bazar with roughly 6b per Char and then you also need to buy Omega time wich still cost you money. Or you buy a multi pilot licence but this costs even more, either way its a game for the big boys in my opinion. If anyone can show me a way to make it profitable, please tell me. Also you would need to have a use for your chars, so multiboxing is a must to keep it all profitable.
---
You sir win today.  Thank you for this.  One of my all time favorite movies.
---
ill gladly pay 2 tril to make sure my enemy makes 0
---
Except half of PL / NC. have alts in Goons.  More than likely, they don't care.
---
So are we ready to acknowledge that whoever is losing will say they dont and whoever is winning will say they do and history repeats itself forever and ever amen
---
Wasn't the entire server cluster loaded inside a citadel or something when those were released?
---
But, like, you guys drop supers in lowsec on faction warfare guys.
---
You wanna point out which part of the video talks about the dynamics of videogame economies and recreational virtual PVP, or are you content with talking out of your ass?
---
"line members" aren't some retarded dimwits who can't understand whats going on around them wtf lol
---
talk about a superiority complex
---
Add mass to cyno and have only 1 active cyno in fleet or fleet cynos can only be deployed so far apart.
---
Good idea needs refining imo
---
You can disable it
---
Show me on the doll where PanFam touched you ?
---
Also nice one, goonie.
---
Imagine having to alarm clock for undefended damage cap structure bashes.
---
Most people I know that are that committed to boredom just watch paint dry or grass grow.
---
We made the decision around May 10th to move and began moving a month later, in early-june. It took, at most, 2 weeks or so to get the structures setup and a week for gsol to prep fuel caches and fuel at desto. I have specific memories of this timeline as I helped organize it, and was in the meeting where we made the decision, and later added these dates to the history page on our wiki.
---
Except it explains why they're necessary..?
---
I'm sure I saw a dscan on here of like 1200 titans in 6rcq
---
This is literally stupid and you should feel stupid
---
&gt; NC. is done. There is no coming back from this embarrassment.
---
Remember when they said the same thing about goons after WWB?
---
If only there were treasure lol
---
The salt I've farmed from this thread with the video I got from it has been more than worth it
---
I can show you on the doll where panfam is getting touched, if that helps.
---
At the end of June 2010, CCP released a patch that broke the 'Prefer Safer' option in autopilot.  People were setting their destination, undocking, hitting autopilot, going AFK and coming back later to find they'd drifted into low-sec and been blown up.

&gt;I noticed last night and some of thosei nteh alliance suggested I send a corp wide mail about:
---
&gt;Concord reported that the latest universe wide autopilot software upgrade has some bugs in it.  The new software will default to taking you the shortest route even when you set it for safer.  Beware, "safer" route will drive you through lowsec so make sure you check your jump list before you start moving.
---
&gt;Thanks,  
---
&gt;Floor
---
It isn't new.
---
Anyone else noticing that after regular DT people went to like 19k (might be less)? After the unscheduled reboot they went to 9k right away... Makes you think where is the difference? Its like if all the bots got dropped and they were never logged back in...
---
I at no point said line members are retarded. At no point. I told you that if you don‚Äôt have to interact with areas of space you generally don‚Äôt know what goes on there. 
---
Also I‚Äôm not an FC and this has nothing to do with me being in Northern Coalition.
---
Maybe you're right. I do have a big ego. Thank you for your comment.
---
What else is there to do?
---
story time ?
---
To all the Panfam bitching - grow a pair of balls and a similarly competitive coalition and go burn their space.  
---
God you all are a bunch of pussies.
---
From memory it was the first asset safety event of a faction fort that had all the stuff in Eve in it. Somewhere in Drone Regions?
---
This was bullshit....all that and no punch line? I thought this was r/eve
---
Is that the new narrative?
---
"Didn't want that region, we live in delve too!"?
---
NOW all NEW Bookmark Feature!
---
All the BOOKMARKS you ever DREAMED of.
---
SUBSCRIBE NOW!!!! for alpha access to this AMAZING GROUNDBREAKING feature!!!
---
&gt;so every1 can have one with the right amount of time and work.
---
you forgot the most important part        ...   and blob
---
you kindof implied that they're retarded by expecting them to know nothing about their surroundings but whatever
---
What about an effect on bastion activation that shuts down any cyno in range? e.g. 7.5km - Gives them a strong small/mid gang use, with risk to the reward - being locked in place and losing remote reps.
---
So basically this is pos grinding like old Eve. üôÑ
---
how does that change the fact that titan spam is ruining the game?
---
I have a lot of [Veldspar](https://eve-files.com/chribba/ten_billion.jpg)
---
&gt; I have read that you no longer live in nullsec for years, then claim to have a KF alt. Both, in the same thread (this one).
---
You know spying? How does this counter the fact that all my Account mains and overall 70% of all chars are not in Nullsec? It was just a point to prove that I do not follow koolaid narratives, neither yours nor PanFams ...
---
Farm to table doomsdays
---
I implied that I don‚Äôt honestly expect them to
---
I have conceived of a ‚Äòspear‚Äô. It is a ship that can only lock onto a ship with a specific target radius, say: a titan. When the lock on is complete it can fire only once, depleting its entire energy store into one fatal shot.
---
The lore would be that the very nature of dumping all that energy into the matrix firing the weapon [the only weapon it has], consumes the ship but not the pod.
---
This has a few consequences:
---
- It‚Äôs expensive space fram
---
- It can only shoot once
---
- It is destroyed by deploying its main weapon
---
- It releases the capsule, the capsuleer is now blinking in the pod, needs to reship to carry on. A timer would be started such that they could not go to the next Spear and do it again. The lore being that the energy discharge from the weapon fucks up the pilots ability to take control of the next Spear. They can only warp off and use a different ship until the effect of the shot wears off.
---
- It destroys a titan
---
- it can‚Äôt be used consecutively
---
- the Spear pilot is rendered incapable of using another Spear / super cap type ship for a fixed time set
---
This means it‚Äôs still advantageous to field titans, but now they have to very carefully watch out who is bringing Spears to the field, because they will lose their big ship to it.
---
Good idea / godawful idea / useless idea?
---
That means a Titan would be destroyed by several modern nuclear missiles. In game they can facetank a barrage of XL torps all day. It just doesn‚Äôt add up
---
&gt; I would really need to undersand how those SIGs are pulling as many numbers in fleet as INIT, a much smaller alliance then. Come face reality the strenght of goons come from rorquals being titans printing machines and the current meta which allows so many people to live in so little space.
---
Ofcourse Rorqual changes were a bonus for us, but why they work so well in Delve and the other organizations are not able to use them in the same way? I think its because Imperium is more succesfuly defending them, and because of that more people are willing to get more rorquals...Its somehow a good strategy no? Ofcourse Rorqs die in Delve, and many died and will keep dying ...But many are surviving :D
---
I mean, it's trivial for us to check the reimbursement records from back then.  Sword fleets did not top the list.  We were mostly throwing hurricanes and other t1 garbage into the fire.
---
This is your fault Daedra
---
I lost my last braincell reading this, Jesus fucking Christ.
---
ü§¢ü§Æ
---
I fat-fingered a market order, turned out costing me a bit shy of 2b.  Nothing like this 75b typo, but enough to make me sad.  I figured I'd throw a long dart, and eve-mail the dude who bought my item that I underpriced.  
---
To my surprise, he did some math on what the cost should have been, and sent me the difference in ISK!  I was shocked, and really impressed with this gesture.  Really restored my faith in in the Eve community a bit.
---
Fast foward a week's worth of Eve-mail, the dude is going to come and try out my littlle corner of nullsec and try things out in my current corp.  I don't know this dude well, but certainly he's a man of integrity at the very least.  
---
Still some good eggs out there.  If the dude who sold the Ark for 86b is reading this, send a mail, maybe you'll meet one of the traders who value thier integrity more than the ISK....
---
I find it rather ironic that NC/PH members laugh at Goons going around shooting structures uncontested because they have the numbers to blob any defenders, yet at the same time their Coalition is doing exactly the same thing in The Spire - Max CTA events forming 150 + dudes to shoot the uncontested structures of an alliance consisting of 25-30 RL people.
---
I'd recommend deleteing this entire post. Keep your list private, do some research into the actual ships you're specualting changes for, and save the information should CCP bring up that they are interested in look at any such ship. Example: Griffin navy issue is a gun boat, DNI is very strong and useful, Vulture is a good ship and its range bonus is cool. 
---
Basically this thread is a massive chaff bomb and will most likely negatively effect your ability to affect positive change on the game.
---
Indeed Sad..i wanted someone to shoot me...But the enemies were busy doing something else ...Probably playing Counter Strike!! :D
---
But then its effectively like eliminating a part of the sandbox by limiting it.
---
Test (and others) have every option to try and stop me from doing it. but when they are too lazy to even camp the system &lt;2hrs before timer, then the lose (in my opinion) any right to whine about a mechanic being broken, when all it is, is laziness.
---
Trigs aren‚Äôt in Jita. They are all around it, so anyone who would die to a gank just dies to them instead
---
You haven't missed anything. Go kill an undefended astrahus. It's the same thing but smaller.
---
Also, those same TZ mechanics are the ones that keep your structures from being attacked right after you go to sleep.
---
Yes, I understand what he's trying to say and I disagree with it.
---
Their fault making Rorquals as they are :D Not ours!
---
Oh, I've done a dozen or so of those.
---
Fuck off StainGuy.
---
oh no, lowsec is more dead than it already is.
---
You're right, dreads need buffing. The CEHE was a small step in the right direction, but dreads need proper siege weaponry. Things that only they can fit. Things that break damage caps on citadels (to make them useful for bashing again), things that do extra damage to supers and titans but do less damage to normal caps and below.
---
Give dreads the ability to be more than just shitty static versions of titans. Titans benefit from being able to move, not siege and DD. Dreads need a differentiator to make them a real threat.
---
Because the current state of eve is "Go big or go home" 
---
There's no reason to do anything small scale, because there's no limits that stop you from forming mega alliances and benefiting from having done so.
---
https://youtu.be/WIkT8asT90A goes for other printers aswell;)
---
So, what you‚Äôre saying here if I‚Äôm reading this right, is that waking up to an alarm clock in order to turn on your computer and log into a video game so that you can shoot at something in that game that has been abandoned is worth it because of comments on an Internet forum. Nice dude, nice.
---
Yeah man we the miners create their content man!!! Miners united !! heheheheeheh xD
---
Any suggestion that includes 'one shot a titan' is pretty silly imo
---
&gt;How do they differentiate RMTers from people scamming fat fingers?
---
Think about it for a second.
---
If an account never trades in JFs and "fatfingers" the only one they ever do...
---
Even with an appropriate ~cover~ you're gonna have to either
---
1) create a massive paper trail for a burner account that can only be used a few times at best
---
or
---
2) be completely fucking obvious about it and at that point you might as well just send the isk right to their wallet to save on the fees
---
Goons: "WE'RE BURNING EVERYTHING TO THE GROUND."
---
Eve: "okay"
---
Goons: "WE'RE HAVING FUN."
---
Eve: "cool bro"
---
Goons: "WHY AREN'T YOU GETTING MAD??!!?!!1111!1!"
---
There‚Äôs no agree or disagree it‚Äôs a reference to a failed goon op last summer involving a cynojammer when they were still a POS module, perhaps it was before your time. Take a joke, don‚Äôt take a joke, it makes no difference to me.
---
Well, if people aren't playing the game... how are they gonna fly freighters?
---
Almost half of the candidates were NPCs and over 2000 votes were wasted on them. Those votes could have been used to unseat a goon or null entity but instead they vanished into the void. All according to plan\~
---
All this does in increase churn of Titans. It doesn‚Äôt solve them being mass produced, nor does it make them not the best ship in the game ATM vs Caps AND Subcaps.
---
The only benefit i see is a super umbrella. 
---
While paps, structure grinds and blueballs are all a daily in the major blocs...
---
extremely salt comments* yes, and I was already going to sleep till then because of other reasons, this just gave me a reason to get up a little earlier
---
I wonder what the numbers are if you include the loss of Tenal and all its structures/rental income as well?
---
So you get a two week break, while they just continue to wardec the other half of EVE while they wait out two weeks to wardec you again. How long before the rest of EVE gets tired of rebashing their one Astra every two weeks and we go back to status quo?
---
Who cares about killboard stats anyway? *removes rigs from citadel* 
---
To Providence people! Time to smack some nerds around!
---
Shit, Marshy got them involved too?
---
&gt; If goons are so inept, why aren‚Äôt Panfam organising amazing counter strategies to pick apart and kill these titan blobs?
---
Because CCP spend the last 2-3 years nerfing anything that enables you to fight subcaps outnumbered into the ground and made the only viable solution to do that supers, which, again by changes in the last 2-3 years, are all about how many retards you can get to mine 23/7 to inject more to mine more to inject more supers.
---
Because the current state shows that there is only one thing that sucks more than being in the biggest force:  
---
Being in the second biggest force.
---
So then you already know what you're in for. It's just waiting around for a half-hour (or more in tidi) doing nothing.
---
Because I want to be spoon fed content. 
---
Eve doesn't interest me enough to spend hours finding me my own, especially when there are others that already do it and all they need from me is to turn up.
---
It's a game, I don't need a second job, I need some spoon fed content to chill out with.
---
That was pretty fake.  It was during the moveop.  I think there were 1,000 faxes though (those got a massive nerf didn't they).  I think Goons probably have 1,000 Titans or more in total though.  Not all deployed and not all will show up to big fights.  There's also the rolling TZ issue to consider.  I don't set my alarm for 5:30am to attend a timer because sleep is more valuable to me than some KM.  If it's 24 hours of rolling TIDI then that's a different issue, as Goons can merge in a large number from the next TZ compared to, say, Panfam, even if they start with even numbers.  So the longer the engagement, the great the advantage Goons have.
---
Anyway people aren't really adding these things up in the same way for TAPI, Frat, Panfam, etc.  Together they must be pretty close.  I'd love to know the true figures but I don't have global API access.
---
I don't know like 5-6 regions?
---
seriously taking roams to delve is way more fun than defending structures in tidi so please goons stay as long as you like
---
Nah id just cyno jam the system
---
Nobody cares xenuria
---
looks like a buy order where they typed one too many digits, going off the previous day's low I'd say one too many 4s.  Wouldn't really call that scamming more of a quirk of the eve market systems. 
---
source - yolo'd 18bil the other night typing one too many digits on an order.
---
Isn't the NC/PL famous tagline "Adapt or Die"? Seems like they should take their own advice.
---
So balance to you means the ability to krab and pvp? Such high standards for eve you uphold. Your comment doesnt sound like a potato chips commercial at all! Brain surgery when?
---
I know but shiny killmail... that's why we do it isn't it.
---
Yes that was the HUGE mistake of the North..." Yes we WON, now we can backstab each others cause goons are dead" lol...Thats a mistake that probably goons will not made..The hammer will never stop falling ...and the hammer wil get bigger and bigger :D 
---
Well during that time i was with Darkness , i remember when anchoring the first keepstars while goons were "exiled" in saranen... Left Darkness because of PL\\TISHU hell camping branch for more than 6 months ...Darkness didnt do nothing to help us ...So many members left and went straight to goons while they were arriving to Delve...Just to one day to pay back to PL . Seems those days arrived.
---
I mean I want to shit talk about them too but considering the battle report has 13 of them against 73 attackers and they came out almost isk even I'd say they did a pretty hell of a job
---
I mean, they can't just keep quiet about it after this teaser.  
---
Only question is *when*.
---
Only Frat and Panfam count as the rest of null currently...
---
1-SMEB was taken on 31 July 2016, your decision was, in your own words, 10 May. So, more than 2 months to get the highway ready and then move everyone down and then begin taking sov (and fighting DelveCo which was mostly LUMPY).
---
Nothing I said was wrong.
---
12% more people care this year than last year, your argument is not mathematically sound.
---
Pearl Abyss wants that return on investment
---
looks like they messed up on a buy order so should be less in fees, especially if they put up orders in a citadel.
---
While it undoubtly looks cool af nobody needs to wonder themselves why no one wants to fight goons.
---
Damn right you can't
---
I understand it‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs not a freebie.
---
- You can‚Äôt use these ships outside of that limited use they have
---
- They are expensive to build
---
- They are consumed by the shot they fire
---
- They render its pilot vulnerable after the shot
---
- There is no guarantee the shot won‚Äôt miss
---
- There is no guarantee they will be able to acquire the target before they are themselves blown up
---
It is not a freebie. It‚Äôs not a magic wand. You can‚Äôt make ‚Äòdoctrine‚Äô out of this, it‚Äôs only used to knock out a titan, if you can get to within range and you can lock on. And you have to hope the shot doesn‚Äôt miss. Whether the shot hits or misses, the ship is consumed by deploying the weapon.
---
The point is specifically not to have a magic wand. It‚Äôs more like a desperate lunge.
---
pretty much man, pretty much. These little wars dont mean shit anymore ever since BoB died. BoB was the last true enemy of EVE and Molle knew how to roleplay a villain.
---
Literally no one but major spodbrains thinks not fighting a thousand titans and more than a thousand subs, with the second biggest coalition in the game waiting to help if there is resistance, is an embarrassment bud.
---
I dunno mate. Typically the way to deal with an overpowered thing is to nerf it, not to introduce even more overpowered things.
---
Like here's a crazy idea, why don't we just remove the ewar resistances from capitals? That would already go a long way toward opening up counters that don't involve bringing even more capitals. A smaller group of supers could disrupt an entire titan ball with ewar burst projectors for instance.
---
Dear CCP, fuck you. You promised to NEVER do this.
---
I seem to recall CCP promising when skill extraction and injecting was introduced that player farmed SP would be the only way to earn SP and now now we see this. Of course I shouldn't be surprised...
---
Ok
---
Another thing that breaks rise's promise of no sp out of thin air?
---
Shocked, I am shocked!
---
I hear Blizzard owns the rights to that one.
---
Was it in Drone Region or was the Drone Region in it?
---
:thinking:
---
Brutally honest. Also the reason why the game went the way it did.
---
1. People don't want to put in effort
---
2. Developer tries to please these people
---
3. Everything else suffers because of it
---
While I disagree with this fucker, I can't fault him for not wanting to play the game like it was 2005 (but why even play it if  you arent enjoying it)
---
you're not helping your own case lmfao
---
"I‚Äôm like a dog chasing cars, I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do if I caught one, you know, I just do‚Ä¶things."
---
- StainGuy, probably.
---
&gt; It doesn‚Äôt solve them being mass produced
---
[This](https://imgur.com/bEiRiAD) is the mineral requirement for an Avatar [if the information is still valid, it‚Äôs been a while since I made that]. If you want to avoid having too many titans, just do the mineral requirement x15. That‚Äôll stop a lot of ambition.
---
So, you fled early and left Co2 holding the bag?
---
No wonder they left the coalition
---
And how many ships in fights?
---
Imagine holding a grudge about pixels. SAD.
---
Just don't be retarded- never had any issues in GOTG
---
Haven't played in a couple years, but...  Wasn't a keep star supposed to have a super mega doomsday?
---
TAPI isn't allied with Goons.  It's interesting but in diplomatic terms it kind-of tells you what needs to happen for Goons to be defeated: get TAPI on side and maybe peel-off some semi-independent entity like Init. 
---
I'm just speculating of course.  Goons' diplomacy game is also pretty good.
---
[Been there, done that](https://zkillboard.com/war/584353/)
---
&gt;why wont nc feed their titan fleet to my much larger titan fleet? 
---
Imagine having your head buried so deep in the f1 blobber sand.
---
It's not wasted time.
---
They are undefeated, I literally log in from my phone to whore on killmails while I'm doing my usual stuff.
---
Titillating
---
oneshots are silly, but add a HUGE lock time (600 seconds) and a HUGE spool time for the weapon (300 seconds) and you may have something
---
How is Top Tier doing in HighSec?
---
So you would rather spend a minimum of an hour killing an undefended structure for a single green line on a website than doing something actually fun? I don't think I'll ever understand that mentality.
---
Depends what gets you off. I always thought it was a lot cooler to be on a supercarrier killmail with like 5 other dudes than a Keepstar killmail with 1000 other dudes. I'd have contributed literally fuck all in the latter case so it's boring to me.
---
Did this really happen. Man I wish I was there for it must have been a great joke
---
what are you referring to I'm out of the loop
---
&gt;  the other organizations are not able to use them in the same way?
---
Because the other alliances don't want to recruit renters as members of their alliances because they don't want to play the long term empire building and renter income was good enough to maintain their infrastructure and finance stuff. They want to have fun and stay a "high" quality PvP alliance.
---
Nobody is saying turtling up to be the strongest alliance in the game wasn't a smart strategy, but what you can't understand is that's it's a good strategy for a different way to play the game. You're not seeing NC or PL loosing corps and disbanding over the loss of their structures because that's not what define them.
---
Rats get fed up with your shit and dreadbomb you
---
What did they do
---
what do you mean by half the candidates were NPC's lol
---
This is the best comment I have seen for a long fucking time.
---
I‚Äôm just offering ‚Äòa‚Äô way of dealing with it. You‚Äôre never going to have too many of these things, because they are expensive, they are one-use only, their success is not guaranteed and they only be used for one specific purpose.
---
Of course, your idea of tweaking the balance is definitely a solid suggestion. I would support it.
---
I just like to think of ways to dealing with issues. Sometimes that yields a useful result, not every time. I invented a module at Fanfest that Fozzie shot down :-). I loved doing that anyway.
---
EVE: Dangerous VR
---
&gt;  Well, The Imperium is just doing what we do best to help out the Eve Online Community to combat the citadel spam problem, so you should all be thanking us for being the one group willing to get off our asses and make the game better by fixing this problem. 
---
L M F A O
---
Oh, they counted, that's why this is happening now.  This is just a little "returning the favor".
---
i had to go back and read up on it and what i was remembering was the "UEFA Champions League 2006" with collectible football cards which have been credited with being the foundation of the loot box.
---
nope
---
https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/default.aspx
---
TLDR: 1M SP for 5 EUR
---
Just a bunch of pussies.  I‚Äôm so tired of it.  Goons got rekt and rebuilt and are coming to finish the job of last summer with no sort dragon in the way to stall it now.  All they do is meme post and unsub accounts till it ‚Äúblows over‚Äù.  I really would love it to see them pushed all the way to colbalt edge to think about their choices.  
---
And then I hope all of those regions are completely left pristine so a new alliance can take root and grow.  
---
I hope new alliances grow from this space and new rivalries flourish and all of that will be healthy for the game.
---
I will have you know that I have been attending parties in NYC once a week usually on Tuesday or Thursday and I have in fact been having The Premarital sex. I think that it's you who needs to undock and put yourself out there instead of crying on reddit over a fucking video game.
---
&gt;Yup that is how I deal with moving high value cargo, however no one should be forced into creating an alt just to play a very basic part of the game.
---
Unless you're a ganker, clearly...
---
Yeah I just went back to the wiki - I was wrong - my entire timeline was off by a month. Change everything I said above to June 10th, not may 10th. We decided on June 10th to do it. We spent the rest of june setting up for it. 
---
According to our wiki, Mittens announced that we were moving in early July and we spent the next week or so doing moveops. By the third week in July we had moved down to Sakht and began htting sov. On July 30th, the first system in Delve fell to us: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Q-HESZ/events. By September 30th, the last system had fallen to us. We dropped our first Keepstar on October 31st.
---
600 second lock time in 10% tidi........................... HMMMMM...........................................
---
I'm not doing it for a green line on a website.  I'm doing it because if I don't and other people think like me, the structure won't die.  The goal is to glass the region, right?  I mean if I wasn't on board with that I wouldn't have deployed.
---
that wasnt the narrative back then :D
---
where does one purchase 1m sp?
---
I enjoy the content
---
I don't enjoy finding it.
---
There's the rub. I simply have other priorities than to spend an hour scouting for a fight that will last 10 mins..  when I can just log in for 10 mins when a ping goes out.
---
Eve just has too much dead time to justify being higher up my priorities.
---
I'd like to think this is some kind of meta commentary on the gaming scene's overuse of "autistic" as a mild insult, buuuut then I remember the poster is a dino so that's not likely.
---
There's also a cerebral accelerator in the pack
---
Because that‚Äôs not all of what we do. I have a standing fleet to hop in for pvp. I have somewhat safe areas to krab. I have buybacks that will buy ore at 95% Jita price without making me ship it anywhere. I have someone who pays 100% Jita buy for relic site loot, so I save money on taxes. 
---
I have friends I‚Äôve met, there‚Äôs plenty of smaller fleets to go on, roams, etc. 
---
And when I get bored of all that, I can buy a solo ship, fly out to providence, and fight you guys. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot more to sov nullsec than the giant battles
---
"It was the best of times, it was the Blurst of times?"
---
I don't think there's enough POCOs in the game for that...
---
the only thing you crush atm is you KARMA by wasting Hours of time in summer and post shit and be proud of. Meanwhile other are going to Tribute have sex and or killmails. When they arrive at home the go to bed or log in grad a keyboard and post some stuff on reddit or elsewhere.
---
‚Äã
---
exactly
---
Well im kinda lost... Yes i uphold that all Eve players should be able to be sucessfull and  thrive in any carrear. Thats the main game publicity each pilot is able to do anything in the game...
---
So we cant krab to tryout new ships, no one can have the goal to build is own titan " to shoot undefended structures" Noooo im such a terrible player wanting us "eve pilots" to explore all game mechanics!! Im quiting eve right now.! Balance is on the side of CCP for our side is to explore all the availble game mechanics to the best.  If they fucked up with Rorquals  not our fault but its the fault of others if they couldnt use them as we did :D Got it ?
---
Very interesting topic you've brought up here.  
---
Isn't everyone somewhere on this spectrum? How is it diagnosed/tested? Where's the threshold of, for lack of a better word, abnormal readings?  
---
I'm getting interested. I'll do some research. I'm wondering right now how widespread this may be on a low level.
---
I thought it was evident enough I wasn't talking about those.
---
Cancelling all my subs right now, this is the shit you see when a game starts circling the drain. Abandonment of all promises that stand in the way of profit.
---
["afraid"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8lzygc/that_impel_was_the_last_straw/)
---
Or they straight up drop a dozen Titans on your Gila just for shit and giggles.
---
Tranquillity DB crashed and eve was down for hours.
---
Not really.  Those are quickly forgotten.  In fact they're so common these days nobody bothers writing threads about them, unlike in the past.
---
Of course those KS kills would be better if they happened after a big fight but we can't control whether or not the enemy undocks.  They'd be mad to undock of course given the disparity in force.
---
For those out of the loop,
---
CCP is selling a "Starter Pack", for $5, that contains 1 mill SP, a cerebral accelerator, and some other non-SP related stuff.
---
This SP I believe is a FLAT SP (Not reduced due to current SP via Injector mechanics).
---
Like eww... who has sex on a beach with all that sand.  I don't like the sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, pretty sure it isn't good for latex or nytrile.
---
Ackshuyally no one cares
---
SIGs to do what i would do in any small corp/alliance. And a little bonus for shift workers like me: people in every timezone to play/talk with
---
Not a lot of active gankers left. CODE. Has a couple guys left who can multibox and gank  freighters, and there‚Äôs still miniluv, but it‚Äôs no where near as common as it used to be.
---
Haha this is awesome.  GJ.
---
You can already buy SP you mong.

I wish I had been around when this was mentioned, so I could give this person the most pitying/contemptuous look possible and ask them if they considered thinking prior to blurting this idea out
---
And you kill fleet of JF who move stuff withotu chnging fleet with a cyno chain.
---
So you want nerf people who have more organisation than you. wrong idea
---
For sure, this is not a frigate insta-locking a boat to point it.
---
This is a ship that‚Äôs going to fire * just once*, it‚Äôs taking care to get the lock right, may be successful, may not be successful. The lock time would be in line with what the expected functionality is. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been trying to say:
---
- IF it hits, it‚Äôs lights out
---
- THAT it hits, not a guarantee
---
I honestly want to offer a viable suggestion, one that is acceptable within context. The crowd here being what it is, will burn me down for anything that is too stupid to be contemplated. I don‚Äôt think this is all that bad. It‚Äôs a workable idea [I believe].
---
I mean, if you want the actual answer to this instead of memeing:
---
We had gradually, months before Co2 flipped, been moving staging further south (iirc it was YAO -&gt; ?? -&gt; D2-HOS -&gt; Saranen).  The move was to be able to project into Cloud Ring, hit/protect lowsec moons (which Co2 had a heavy interest in) and put us in better position to help allies who were dealing with pressure.  If we wanted to leave our allies to the wolves, we would've just sat on our asses in Deklein, not deploy to Saranen.
---
But I'm guessing you just wanna meme.
---
Yeah so compress it by a month. I don't have a wiki to reference, I'm going off of memory here. The order of events is not wrong, but the timeline was a bit more crunched than I remember. In any case, my point still stands - it wasn't "just 10 astras" like that one re-re said.

If you add mass limit to cyno or "limit number of ship" or whatever... you will nerf attacker and not defender.

What do you mean by "NPC" candidate ?
---
carriers more than anything tbh
---
Do you know and understand how this offer and skill injectors mwchanics work by default?
---
If you don't, do not embarass yourself.
---
When extractors/injectors were introduced CCP said they'd never create SP out of thin air. Until now all SP that came from that mechanic still had to be earned even if it was from a SP farm.
---
It should be noted that it can only be used once per account, not that it makes it much better but there is at least a limit to it.
---
We also saw the daily alpha injectors.
---
The person you are talking with is using words meant to demoralize, demoralizing goons has been NCdocks one and only effective weapon this campaign.
---
Surprised you didn't mention how many of Vily's proposed changes would kill different styles of play outside null sov.
---
Meh killing Krebs is fucking *laaaaaame*
---
"obliterating"
---
/r/ihavesex
---
Indeed. Injectors out of extractors are already deflating the economy through farming and botting, but at least are real in-game mechanics.
---
This is plain p2w, small scale.
---
they give out SP all the time in events. Why are you mad now?
---
Can I have your stuff or are you just virtue signaling?
---
`It‚Äôs very important to note here that this means all the skillpoints available to buy on the market in EVE will have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate.

no fleets lmao
---
 These Goons has great priorities. Although $4.2trill is a very insignificant amount of money. I guess my perspective is different, being the owner of 12 keepstars. Nonetheless, great policy - gold digging floozies get nothing from me besides dis dick and a good time. Well they also get free transportation, as my driver Jorge picks them up and brings them to my mansion. They always Uber home though, later bitch. Am I right?! Lol ‚úåüèª‚úåüèªüí∞üí∞
---
yes. Someone can drop $1000 on plex, turn around and buy a shitload of injectors and p2w a lot more than a measly 1m SP. But no, this one time purchase is the real problem.
---
Unless you're a ganker and then you can fuck off of of Vily's Eve
---
Mhmm. I don't disagree. In the case of this post, was just trying to keep bias and purely informational. On a personal note this is some Grade A Yikes fam.
---
I'm not demoralised, don't worry.  My participation has never been based on morale.  I pick and choose when I undock and who I fly with, e.g. which FC pinged the fleet.  It's just a video game isn't it.
---
I can only speak for test, or specifically Dreddit.
---
Nobody forces you to join the structure bash big fleets. There is no requirement to do anything you don't want to do. I've been in the alliance for over a year now and I can count the times I've been in a fleet with more than 50 people on one hand.
---
Bloc level warfare is not all there is to do in a big alliance, there's plenty of groups who do different playstyles. Small gang, cloaky hunting, roams to who knows where, etc.
---
The benefit of being in a big alliance vs a small one is that I can freely hop between all the smaller groups within the alliance. There is always something to do. In smaller corps, most group content is limited to one timezone or even just a couple of hours a day.
---
Also there's the benefit of having alliance infrastructure, but I'm usually deployed away from the alliance with whatever SIG I'm most active at the time, so I don't use that much.
---
CCP throwing the game deeper and deeper down the cliff, what a surprise!
---
I don't even know why I'm disappointed anymore, this bunch of stupid assholes are decided to ruin this game, and doesn't matter how much love and hope we (the players) throw to it, they seem decided to just milk the cow until it dies.
---
Anyone at CCP reading this, I know it's not all of you that are to blame for the path EVE took, but sincerely, you can all collectively go fuck yourselves with a cactus.
---
Retard alert! Retard alert!
---
CCP hasn't got a clue.
---
I mean there's a lot of baggage attached to that concept though, and if you really buy into the $$ -&gt; SP conversion being pay to win it's already kind of been happening. I mean with the 1mil SP that got handed out that's just paying $15 for 1 month of time and receiving 1mil SP + training time. So like there was already a conversion rate you could apply to that which is probably a much better deal than this $5 pack you can only use once.
---
I'm not making apologetics for this, I don't think it's a great path to be taking but I hardly think it's breaking anything.
---
I don‚Äôt think I  understand the first part of your comment. 
---
Second part has been addressed in other comments here. Defenders get a huge advantage if they stage their supers in advance. Makes sense. Wondering what the real solution to supers is, or if there really needs to be one. /shrug.
---
&gt;They are expensive to build
---
No, they're not.  Largely because they can't cost as much as a Titan or they won't be used.  And Titans are no longer expensive to the large blocs.
---
&gt;You can‚Äôt make ‚Äòdoctrine‚Äô out of this
---
Of course you can.  The blocs would make "Spear" caches and use them to blap titans and supers that are on fixed grids, like during a Keepstar bash.
---
Might wanna try reading next time bud
---
?
---
Super and titan are not the true problem of EVE.
---
The true problem is people complaining about they beacause they don't want make any effort AND no enought newbro to be target for pvp player who want kill without using brain.
---
I wonder how long this ‚Äú*undefended structure*‚Äù thing continues until they realize we aren‚Äôt stopping until they push back or every structure they own goes poof.
---
Well then...
---
How do I subscribe to just users? Is that a thing?
---
This is everyones excuse whenever an encounter is N+1.
---
So when 24 of 44 candidates were NPCs but 22 were interviewed, can I get a link to the 2 interviews with NPCs ?
---
I am hoping we just start moving in a clockwise fashion around the map till we get home to Delve.
---
But someone has to have 'worked' in game in order for those SP to be available. You are so retarded.
---
You should have applied for the CSM. The amount of schooling you are providing the goons in this thread should be considered a public service. Keep it up.
---
It's for the new Myrm bots.
---
So, you are thanking us for making you a high-sec warrior then?
---
N+**1**? Sure, mate.
---
But is true, no reason to feed anyway.
---
@CCP you will kill your own game with these things, stop adding p2w upgrades to a subscription based game if you want people (including me) to continue to sub
---
They don‚Äôt know any better. IMO CCP could gain a lot from incentivizing content generators more. Instead of making it a theme park, keep it hard, but make the rewards for the FCs, hunters, and other coordinators so big that everyone wants them. We‚Äôve had good success doing this in my Corp. Hunters keep the loot, FCs get a lot of leeway and free ships, and anytime someone has ideas for events or other projects, we throw resources at them.
---
Zing
---
I'll likely welp anything before giving it away to randoms.
---
tl;dr you can have it if you kill me and loot fairy says yes.
---
Where do you think the injectors on the market came from? The problem is not the ability to purchase SP with RM itself, but the fact that the SP is not generated in-game, which is something CCP said would never be possible.
---
I love how you‚Äôve become the resident sperg, replacing Olmeca lmao
---
They'll be at zero velocity when they land at the insta undock BM.  From there they have the post-warp immunity until they break it by initiating another warp, which is then completed with the same two-ticks-required logic as a warp out of gatecloak.  You could still SB them, however.
---
saving this pasta
---
[You are correct.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/skill-trading-in-new-eden)
---
I like all of these and I'm very glad you're bringing most of them up.
---
If I were to make counter points on two though;
---
I don't think the Bellicose will get much more use out of just one more mid, it probably needs its rate of fire bonus changed to a damage bonus so it's not perpetually reloading with rapid lights.
---
Why add so much to the Bowhead, is it not strong enough as a shipping platform already?
---
Why remove a low slot from the Caracal navy? It should probably be looked at for a more complete balance pass top to bottom to give it a new specialization.
---
For example, I personally pay 50-250m for any new hunter to buy a ship. Last week a guy brought in several ships for an op and mentioned it was most of his Isk, so I sent him 1b to play with. I reimburse 100% for any booster who buys mindlink implants. We often have theme roams and someone always offers free ships. Etc etc
---
no bill
---
This guy gets it.
---
lol this game is so fucking toast
---
It's a bit fucked up but it's far from being dangerous as long as it's a one time use only (if it's like other packs). Given the current price of injectors it's even pretty worth it shit fuck me ...
---
[https://sites.google.com/site/csmwire/csm-14-election?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/site/csmwire/csm-14-election?authuser=0)  The interviews of all candidates are linked here but for ethical reasons I am not going to specifically name names in terms of which of them are NPC candidates. If you are listening to an interview with an NPC you will know. One of the candidates was on drugs when being interviewed which was kinda funny.   
---
22 Candidates gave interviews, not all of them were NPCs.
---
Sir, this is a Wendy's.
---
It's okay if you went from denial straight to depression. There will be plenty of time for anger after the Northern infrastructure is purged ... or do you think you'll just be able to rebuild in peace?
---
I have done my part in serving communities for over 15 years, it usually just leads to burnout and resignation if you really wnat to achieve something and you are not just after the merits of the job ...
---
Remember when goons were the bad guys and not the dumb guys?
---
The VAST VAST VAST majority come from SP farms - accounts that exist solely for the purpose to generate SP, which is functionally the same.
---
Boot.ini
---
Can someone buy this and post the full details of its contents or do I have to bite once myself :(. Seems like they replaced the alpha pack.
---
Also Alpha injectors were also SP from thin air which was bogus iirc they can be used on a lotttttt of omega only skills, dunno if all of them though. (inject while alpha, don't redeem, go omega use sp. Had a friend do it)
---
I was about to say this is wildly off-topic. 
---
It isn't though, is it?
---
This, most likely.
---
I personally dropped every single asshouse we used to evacuate the north. I did it in 3 days, and it only took that long because there was a miscommunication about the route we decided on and I ended up dropping a completely separate evacuation route by mistake.
---
While this is a valid point it really isn't much different than making a free 5 mill sp account from alpha and subbing it with real money and extracting it. The major difference is that this is much cheaper.
---
Nope, thats indeed not goons fault. You bring forward all these topics I never mentioned, like you're having a discussion with someone in your mind.
---
The single point I brought forward is making pve increasingly important while at the same time making it harder to pvp.
---
Nice flying! ;)
---
So, you don't fight goon ingame, you do it here on the message boards.  Got it.
---
If you think a max CTA (which isn't even really a thing in Horde) from NCPH is 150 dudes, I've got some bad news for you friend.
---
As someone who seen these sort of statements in every war for the last 12 years, including every defensive war goons had lost - structure-bashing gets to people. People get complacent. Overconfidence kills better than any numbers. And the best part - no one gives a damn about losing undefended structures. Neither did goons, neither anyone ever. Any alliance which wasn't broken by a long war - just moves on. So did goons, not that long ago, so did PL, a while back, so did NC, many times in the past. 
---
Hence the answer - the end is probably much sooner than you think, but may be far longer away than defenders think.
---
It's almost as if all NS alliances were about attacking weaker targers and circlejerking about how not boring this all is
---
Because the large blocs are actually doing more than one thing at a time.
---
You might only see structure killmails and blueballs, but we've got a near-constant stream of small fleets going out to random places and fighting random people.  That "more engaging, smaller alliance" doesn't have nearly as many fleets because they're smaller so there's fewer people to go do things with.
---
That "more engaging, smaller alliance" is also going to have a hard time in null if they're not part of a bloc, because some bloc is going to send their constant stream of small fleets in the direction of the smaller alliance.
---
Also, generally the people posting on a forum about a game are the ones not enjoying the game.  So they're either at a place they can't play (eg work), or whining about something.  That results in the forums appearing far more negative than the playerbase.
---
It provides a key social aspect, while allowing you to learn and be part of something. You have decent markets. Your ability to make ISK is really good. You get exposed to battles you wouldn't normally be part of. Yeah, you could be in a small low sec or wh group. But then you get thrashed around a lot. Not that it isn't fun but there are real life things going on for most people that make that life insanly hard.
---
Until you get bored ?
---
Does this mean Eve is dying?
---
As someone who runs a smaller alliance I can safely say the biggest issue I face in recruiting is just straight up infrastructure.
---
It's very difficult for a smaller group to be pulling the same numbers and offering the same things as a larger group. In some larger null alliances you can actually make money out of going out on a fleet and losing your ship - it's very hard for us to scale to that level without draining our wallets or burning out all our krabs.
---

---
even we know your deployment is ending soon bud..and we are just your local lowsec shitlords
---
I'd rather be bored with friends than have fun with assholes
---
Which is it? Either NCPL players don't want to rat/mine/explore/actually use the space they own because they are noble space "nomads", or they all have alts in their enemy's land actively strengthening their enemy.
---
Makes you think what they could accomplish if they put all that effort into developing their own farms and fields.
---
Maybe add in SP loss too.  CCP sells more boosters and we get to kill more titans.
---
spend less time fixated with mirrors.
---
The existance of the Hull class and its capabilities were never the problem. The problem started with Lifeblood-Rorqual-Ore spam. The minerals for a Titan took time to gather, whole Alliances took weeks of MiningOps, now with a properly scaled and utilized Rorq-Multibox, a single player can gather this amount in 1 weekend. That is the problem and again supports my point that the final slope of EVE has started with "Lifeblood".
---
There's a lot of Isk here, I'm starting to sweat.
---
Tuzy your isk value column should be right justified.
---
I‚Äôm so happy I quit just before this came out, and they‚Äôve definitely sealed the deal that I will never return
---
Would you all stfu until I get home from work and can buy this pack for all my accounts! Hate when shit gets removed before I can use it!! Lol
---
Might wanna try looking at the bigger picture bud.
---
I was there :)
---
Ironic hypocrisy is lost on them.
---
You seem to not know how SP farms work, but go ahead - resort to ad homs instead of having a real argument.
---
Is it odd if I can't feel the left side of my face?
---
TBH you're just reinventing the dread wheel here.  Dreads are already damage platforms that are largely suicidal (in fleet combat, ganks are fine as is) and primarily used to trade for larger ships.  Buffing their damage achieves the same ends without a contrived new class.
---
It's in reference to a suggestion I made about having a capital bomb that had increased damage, but I high explosion radius so it's not oppressive to smaller sig ships.
---
Ye mean thoze Kamikaze, dont ya? I tellz you zikret, we iznt even half in numbers, let alone even. Should have done some survey before you left Delve. Good luck bashing the rest anyway, nobody is gonna stop you, literally nobody.
---
People cry about injector and plex prices and when CCP comes with a solution to help mitigate that, people are also crying. I understand why CCP has the CSM as the average player is really stupid, no offence.
---
Oh the irony. Goons who were running away without a fight just three years ago post about how others run now.
---
Don't worry, it will be available on every account until purchased. Then there will be even more RM fast forward items from CCP Abyss, when they hit all time lows.
---
Does not counter his point, why do you think SNUFF aligned itself with Imperium? Because they love Mittens or the styles of play you bring to the game? Nope, it was just pur opportunism. They recognized that without a sizeable titan force you would be irrelevant soon, and that the only way after Lifeblood obtaining them in a competitive way was to krab in Delve. Thats it. Without Lifeblood snuff also would have 500-800 less people, as lots of smaller Lowsec groups merged into them because their income was patched to literaly "ZERO" within 1 day ...
---
I think it's cute how their whole strategy is "we're just going to come back and rebuild when you get bored and leave." 
---
I'm looking forward to the sig/squad deployments knocking down every sand castle they build for the next year straight
---
I don't think you're on the wrong path, but I don't think this is the right solution.
---
Something more along the lines of jump fuel scaling with how many people are taking the cyno would be better I think.
---
Say, 20 carriers can take the cyno before it starts sucking up half their fuel bay, but only 10 titans can take it before the cost gets outrageous. This doesn't so much disable the cyno as much as it adds more cost to using it. Now you have to more heavily consider how many capitals you want to deploy because if you put too many on field, they can't bounce back to their out-cyno.
---
This is just a quick idea as a rebuttal. It could do with being more refined.
---
Oh god node programming, the nightmares have returned.
---
Spoken like a true soyboy.
---
With the possible exception of EveUni, the major nullsec blocs provide the best places for new players to learn the game (Horde, Brave, Karma). So players join those blocs and end up meeting people they like being around and get comfortable.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
So basically it seems it boils down to people not wanting to wait for content.
---
 In many other PvP games you can "queue for match" and be doing some PvP very soon. 
---
Eve is unique because of the non consensual PvP aspect. Big alliances now have good logistics and discords etc which make the "queue for content" lifestyle essentially possible. 
---
The people who want non consensual PvP content on demand will probably go to these places then, since they can log in when fun is happening, and afk/rat/ farm in safety otherwise.
---
People who are playing to create content and not just consume it are becoming fewer and far between it seems. 
---
It's not just eve but a general trend in gaming. It used to be playing the game WAS the reward/fun. Now we look forward to  only the next free SP or loot box and the games become a grind to get to the next reward cycle.
---
Just my two cents.
---
Get rid of tidi and make it player vs player rather than player vs server. I guarantee many more titans will die. The 64 bit client is a step in the right direction
---
Canceled my five accounts.
---
It was time. That is the straw to break my old camel's back.
---
The idiots finally did it. See you all around.
---
Thanks for putting together the explanation list, though I have to say I was hoping for more of them to be explanations of *why* you feel the change is needed rather than descriptions of the change; e.g. why do the EAFs need those small buffs, why do the FAX need those fitting increases, etc? One of the biggest concerns when it comes to balance changes of these kinds is understanding the reasoning for them in order to see how they fit into the overall ecosystem, and I would like to see more of that.
---
Anyway, my main concern with this is that a lot of these seem to me to fall into the category of change for change's sake. It seems to me that you were going through this with the perspective of 'what changes could I make?' rather than 'is there a sufficiently compelling reason to make changes?' That wouldn't necessarily be a problem, except for the fact that as a result the overwhelming majority of the changes are straight buffs. In isolation most of them wouldn't be an issue, but collectively I can't see any way to describe it as anything other than power creep. I would personally suggest that you back off on the large majority of the 'minor fitting buff/etc for no particular reason' type changes and focus on the ones where a ship or class of ships is *significantly* demonstrably in trouble, in order to avoid simply powercreeping huge swathes of the game at once. (E.g. the doomsday or the navy BS changes are probably good ones, the EAF buffs are probably just power creep.)
---
In particular, just because a ship has tight fitting at times isn't really a reason by itself to buff it, unless it can be demonstrated that it's actually being unduely crippled by said fitting issues, which I think needs to be argued on a case by case basis.
---
&gt;You inherit main flaw of inhib - it takes a time to deploy while cyno is instant
---
What if the anti-cyno bastion turned off cynos that had already been lit in addition to preventing new ones?
---
Some are shit some are not. I can tell you from having played with them, some of the best russian pvpers bot and rmt massively, they even write their own corp 3rd party apps. Personally i dont even mind it if they bot if they still play the game, i do hate the carebear hisec bot tho or the one who doesnt play just rmt.
---
&gt; the only thing you crush atm is you REALLIFE by wasting Hours of time in summer and shoot structures and be proud of. Meanwhile other are going to the beach have sex and or partys. When they arrive at home the go to bed or log in grad a ship and kill some stuff in delve or elsewhere.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ‚Äã
---
&gt; The grand thing here is that NOBODY cares about how many Structures you KILL. And btw listig POCOS there is like counting lost drones when fighting ishtars to boost your own factor... embarresing!
---
Just quoting this piece of gold (salt) so you wont delete it. post was made by /u/captain_karacho84
---
Keep them all and use it to build a lowsec gate to stain.
---
No, because the status quo is just even more runaway exponential growth for goons.  You might hurt people's ability to catch up (if anyone were trying), but you'd at least stop the gap getting bigger, faster, the longer it goes on.  Those goon titans will retire from the game or move to new alliances eventually over time and the advantage will fade, especially if you restore non-rorq-focused income to its proper place.  There's no way to get back to the pre-rorq days, no, but stopping them now would be better than the alternative.
---
so guilty as charged, isnt it?
---
Their EVE-life is so bad RL seems amazing to them now.
---
Not having TiDi is definitely going to change outcomes. If it‚Äôs not a slide show but a dynamic system it‚Äôs going to ring a lot of bells :-)
---
How much are they charging? Can you get more than one?
---
I just stopped responding to this particular rebuttal from the other side when I finally realized that 9 out 10 people telling us about how we fought the Casino War hadn't even started playing the game until well after the war.
---
I‚Äôm not disputing it. I have not flown dreads, not sure about their in-combat mechanic. The difference with my system is that the thing dies when the weapon is deployed. That‚Äôs not a guarantee for any dread.
---
can't extract below 5m, need omega to get above that for the most part

One more step and your path of logic will be complete... come on. you can do it...

Eve needs a long event where NPCs gate camp popular systems everywhere from 0.9 space downwards. The only way to end it is to push them back and hold the gates until hostile presence is reduced below a set amount for a given region.
---
Change my view.
---
Not sure whether SP loss would have to be necessary, I didn‚Äôt consider that. It might be a useful addition. I‚Äôm really not sure.
---
Taranis is outshined by the comet in almost every way now. More tank, more dps, and cheaper. As for the hecate I'm not sure where you are getting your numbers from but its base speed is slower than most battlecruisers.
---
40% damage, lmao CCP.
---
You agree with me that each ones choices are the ones that best suit them right? I dont mind with the strategy of PL\NC, what i do mind is the one been defetead complaining that the other side got too big and to mean and its "unfair" Each organization as an history, most of wars in eve normaly comes from a chain of events . Goonswarm to survive after lossing WWB had to recruite and to grow as a super capital force, because  their main "enemy" was the major power block in eve. I believe that many goonswarm members lacked the faith on their organization to rebuild , many of them reallty though that was an "impossible" come back..and so they found another path for them...and probably many also returned after seeing the "dead goons" weren't so dead after all
---
i think it's because you can get the SP out of thin air in exchange for money
---
5 eur.
---
I think you can only buy DLCs once per account. 
---
The problem is that they promised they'd NEVER do this. And now they are. Slowly. It's the principle of boiling a frog. Turn up the heat too quickly and the frog notices and jumps out. But if you slowly let the water heat up, the frog doesn't notice.
---
CCP is slowly adding more microtransactions despite their promises.

Keep telling yourself that. In fact CFC didn't fight after c02 gave up. Random inty fleets and rare ops of \~300 is what...  one third of what goons alone could do at the time? Not even close to a defense. And no one even defended any structures, fortress Deklein fell incontested. It may felt like defense for you in saranen, as you were camped in there, and managed to kill some of the campers, but at the same time the rest of your empire fell and burned and nothing was done to defend it. The fact that the opponent does almost the same - is just them repeating what goons did. Twice in fact: when losing PL's meatshield in Fountain to IT and then abandoning Delve without a fight, and when losing c02 meatshield in Tribute during WWB and giving up Deklein without a fight.
---
So you finally admit that there is just one way to relevance in this game? Be or recruit "krabs" ? Funny thing is, for "balance" you would need at least one other way ...
---
you can buy one per account, like the other dlc. Cost ¬£4.24
---
I think whatever happens to Goon Titans will also happen to other people's Titans.  They'll move to other alliances or retire from the game too.  The Goon advantage will remain.
---
That's why you always need to keep a beach towel handy.
---
How is this any different in the grand theme of things than players subbing skill farm accounts? The end result is the same wrt. skillpoints.
---
Maybe you didn't realize it at the time, but you got fucked a long time ago.
---
Sorry we didn't interrupt anything by wasting our time
---
FTFY
---
You first assume the game is broke. If it's a sandbox it's just as broke for everyone then. So why are some people crying about it and others are thriving. Because it's a sandbox.
---
Try it.
---
You still play eve? Jeez
---
&gt; bench warmers
---
Alliance rename of Dorkness when ?
---
super serious spaceship enemies
---
Thank you.
---
It would be fun if mining anoms no longer respawned, asteroids belts no longer respawned, asteroids were deleted from missions and moons now had finite resources in them that lasted maybe 26 weeks total of pulling. 
---
Minerals are slowly drained from stockpiles, people reprocess capital ships and components in order to produce tech 1 destroyers.
---
I left the null bloc game years ago and I've had more fun playing EVE the past 2 years than most of the previous decade before that. The reality is most people rather have the safety and SRP of the large groups than risk anything they personally own. 
---
Our group lives in lowsec and lots of the people coming out of null expect SRP and safe krab time that really doesn't exist outside of sov null even if the activities available are the same that exist in sov null such as moon mining.
---
When I started in 2011 I think I had several hundred thousand skill points starting out for ‚Äústarting skills‚Äù
---
So, sure, they‚Äôre not going to be as expensive as a Titan, but they‚Äôd cost ‚Äòsomething‚Äô.
---
- No sooner have I said: you can‚Äôt make doctrine or someone invents one :-).
---
Someone suggested a long lock on / activation time, which would make it a calculated risk to bring them up against titans. Which is what I had in mind.
---
It‚Äôs a suggestion, to start a conversation, see where it goes. Maybe it inspires someone to come up with a better way to use that kind of platform.
---
You actually just have to show me the doll.
---
&gt;"It‚Äôs very important to note here that this means all the skillpoints available to buy on the market in EVE will have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate.
---
i dont get it, extra referral and "starter" sp has been breaking this rule for years, why are you guys acting as if it was new? I dont like it just as much as the next guy but this promise has been broken for a while.
---
Guard duty is really, really, really fucking boring.
---
People do it IRL because they're getting paid and/or ordered to do it.
---
People do not do it in games because it's really, really, really fucking boring.
---
Don't think I've ever said there's another way to rival goons
---
Oh, I know. I was just curious how much they'd turned up the heat. I haven't logged in for months.
---
Damn, you are dumber than I originally thought...
---
It‚Äôs a one time purchase that gets you 1M SP, ONE TIME, not a big deal, there needs to a way for newer players to catch up, by this logic all you should be up in arms about 750k SP new accounts get for referrals.
---
The only thing that will piss me off is if I can‚Äôt buy the new pack because I already bought the old ‚Äústarter pack‚Äù.
---
WTB Point Defense on carriers.
---
The game needs new blood not bitter vets.
---
I mean, rise the pitch fork a bit but this is far from being the game's doom.

I‚Äôm in the same place lol. Just left a bugger bloc and now am enjoying life muc, much more! 
---
I was just wondering why people complain and do nothing about it...
---
Can't upvote enough
---
Can you give me a link or something? [Aryth's post](https://imperium.news/aryth/) seems to imply that the negotiations were exclusively between him and Sort. He says:
---
"Originally, I had approached the NC leader at the summit as NC is the majority partner in that relationship...Sort Dragon ended up being the person I would continue negotiations with."
---
and
---
"I had to outline the framework over the course of a couple days. Those days were the weekend of the 15-16th. By Sunday the 16th we had the framework written and were just getting each side‚Äôs leadership informed and inking the deal."
---
This would seem to imply that Sort and Aryth secretly negotiated the deal, then presented the finished deal to Imperium and Panfam leadership for approval. In fact, he specifically said he offered Killah Bee a deal that was nearly identical to the GOTG deal, but ended up negotiating with Sort Dragon instead.
---
Finally, endorsing the deal means absolutely nothing. NC didn't give up anything in the deal, and it seems like Sort was going to take the deal whether or not NC approved. So no matter what they think of it, of course they wouldn't object to the deal at the time. That doesn't mean it wasn't a bit of a backstab towards them.
---
Goons got rekt and run away with their tail between their hind paws. Twice. Didn't even fight back, just run to a new place. Some other alliances can talk. Test for one, c02, even XiX. NC fought many wars in the past, sos did PL - losing, then rebuilding. But they fought. Goons? They never defend anything. Only attack, then either retreat or push and gloat. Hardly an example.
---
As for new alliances - when goons run the last time, their space was taken without a fight by GOTG coalition. That is the quality of a new coalition you can expect to rise from taking undefended space for themselves.
---
Came here to call you out for throwing around P2W. 
---
Shit, this is officially pay-to-win.
---
...still going to purchase one.
---
And you forgot how to downvote ! They're really good at it aswell. Also missing shitposts ! But hey ! Congrats !
---
The comet is a pretty close competitor but it lacks the additional falloff bonus the taranis has. The Ranis can apply its dps and sig tank most destroyers from 5km away.
---
Though the comet is also an extremely effective frigate sized brawler. 
---
The same thing applies to the Hecate with its ability to swap modes. You can still push the thing up to very high speeds with prop mods due to its low mass and inertia modifier as well. Just swap into sharpshooter as soon as you have them within 7km and melt.
---
I feel like we're getting a bit distracted from the original point here though, which is brawling is dead vs brawling isn't dead.
---
&gt; what i do mind is the one been defetead complaining that the other side got too big
---
Everyone has been complaining about how stupid the current state of NS is. You can even find some goons circlejerking here about how they predicted all this. People aren't complaining about Goons growing too big they are complaining that the game allowed this to happen and it's most likely irreversible now.
---
Hence me telling to stop feeling proud because there is nothing to be proud of getting big because you krabbed and enjoyed the safety the game allowed you to have.
---
Except you can put unlimited structures in a system, whereas POS were limited.
---
Yes, CCP was told this would happen and ignored it.
---
Tbh I didn't take a careful look at the freighter stuff.
---
It's outside my playstyle, but I'm typically against changes that cause less explosions overall without good reason.
---
This is a better deal than buying Plex to buy injectors though.
---
from my perspective goons were the good guys until about 2010.
---
Couldn't have anything to do with an all-hands-on-dick war up North.
---
i have to be in a nullsec alliance to shoot goons?
---
Read comment chain.
---
Boat saying it makes it less likely, not more.
---
Then you also admit that "Lifeblood" fucked up the balance between groups centered around Sov-Holding, Mass-Recruitement and PvE-focus and groups centered around nomadic pvp lifestyles.
---
But as longer I think about it it all makes sense. Lifeblood enabled people to scale huge multiboxes paying themselves with PLEX in 1-2 days of playing. Then it just makes sense that they forced players not liking PvE Grind to switch their income from ingame (Moons) to out of game (CreditCard) to supply all these PLEX needed in Delve/Esoteria. But as a lot of the 2nd group said "If you f**k us, then f**k you CCP" we are seeing PLEX price developement of last time ...
---
Well - that part was right. It was only Astrahus, because our first Fortizar ever was in 1-Smeb, and it was 12  astras because I still have the original dotlan route map I made at the time bookmarked (http://evemaps.dotlan.net/route/Saranen::Ashitsu::Eha::Rakapas::Pynekastoh::Costolle::Aulbres::Conomette::Aeter::Shirshocin::Hier::Esubara::Sakht). We dropped 1 Astrahus and 2 POS in each system on neut-alts corps to get them online and keep the route hidden, transferring them in once we began the moves.
---
Sorry you don't do PVP when you press F1.  In that sense you are no different than NPC.
---
The same people bitching about a 1M SP pack for a new player for $5 are the same people who bitched incessantly that they didn't get their 1M SP for their $15 subscription because they couldn't defeat the login-once-per-day-and-click-a-button-for-free-shit-boss. 
---
They're also the same people who bitch every day about the game dying because nearly 90% of new players quit. 
---
Yet on the off-hand, they're also the same people who say SP isn't everything and in no way resembles a player's skill. 
---
I don't really get the EVE community. Let me rephrase, I don't really get the r/Eve community, it's clear they don't actually play the same game.
---
That's mild to say the least.
---
The game needs isk faucets severly cut, way more isk sinks, assets safety to be toned down at least a little, at least a fourth of nullsec to disapear and whatever region is left to have an NPC constelation with several stations in it, way more risk in general, to restrict the ammount of structures you can anchor in each system; it also needs a rework of PVE engagements and FW/LS in genral.
---
We need the balance more inclined towards the dangerous, grim and unforgiving game EVE once was and less to the Space Theme Park it's slowly becoming.
---
Please, do try to change my mind.
---
You're an insignificant puppet that had nothing to do with the success of goons. Just a leech pretending to be important and elite. Lmfao who the fuck do you think you are?
---
Also not affiliated with either side btw, just like to make fun of self important retards like you.
---
You could even pay someone to escort you :)

Oh what a day, what a lovely day!

The irony given Saranen and the sheer amount of tail-tuckin' during WWB is palpable.

Bring back giant spod, appease the gods.

Same regards repeat that without being truthful.
---
I got all the bonuses possible for the last 4 years and still think TM for SP is bad.
---
You're welcome
---
...so have some light fighters in your hangar?
---
If we're going to go with the design philosophy of "anti-cap weapons have a hard time hitting subcaps" that we have in other things (eg. shitty tracking on capital guns, good tracking on HAW guns), then Ametats should have a hard time applying to dictors.
---
But sale goals for Pear Abyss bonus are not reached!           
---
Due to to many players quitting the game
---
Ahh,  I never noticed that. It looks like a number of them that usually camp Uedama are now ganking in Jita. 
---
There has been the discussion about the other smaller trade hubs dying off, and most of the people that trade there now probably trade locally. Decreased industrial traffic in that pipe could force the gankers in to a more target rich environment. 
---
Also, most of the ganks on the KB seem like they barely break even or make any money off them at all. Compared to several billion from a loaded down freighter, most of the ones I see they only get 30-60 mil drop from and invest almost that much or more in ships. That's not even taking in to account the time spent. It would make sense they would go somewhere more profitable.

"Available to buy on the market"
---
I think he means not a serious candidate
---
Hey, I feel like this is a noob question but how do you get loyalty points for the Amarr imperial war reserve?
---
Couldn't you have fun with friends?
---
No it hasn't. The SP are not "available to buy on the market in EVE"
---
Not going to happen.
---
People are assigned to it IRL as a pseudo-punishment, and do it because they're getting paid/ordered to do it.
---
People are not going to do it frequently in a game.
---
Strictly speaking, it does say "on the market in EVE", but this is still pretty bad.
---
it's partly because a lot of gankers have quit the game and no one steps up to replace them so kinda I guess.
---
They will be once applied and extracted
---
We were always the good guys. If you don't think so its because you were the baddies and didn't realize it.
---
"High sec pirate" 
---
More like degenerate multiboxer who takes advantage of the fact that CCP cannot implement a fraction of resemblance of what "high" sec would even mean in a fictional scifi world.
---
why in gods name would you ever want to remove yet another play style from the game?  
---
How is sig/speed tanking even the problem compared to the efficiency and lack of interaction required by platforms like the VNI/Domi? AFK gameplay is the problem, not sig tanking.
---
If we need any change to anoms, its to increase the risk to your ship while you're running them. Add  scramming frigs with sigs so small that you have to use light drones/tracking ammo to deal with them.
---
One of the mods must be from a group that you didn't rate very highly...

Fuel trucks are a thing

you can make a WTB post on the forums, you'll get price gouged to shit though. Alternatively, wait for a WTS post for a bpc/hull.

Hi again.

Unfortunately your experience is the the exception rather than the rule.

---
Thanks Dave hates new things, this looks like the old starter pack but with mil sp added. Oh well duplicate clothing items!
---
I'd like to know why so many people on r/Eve are always so worried about why other people play the game differently than they do. 
---
Maybe because they like doing it. Just a though. Can't get anything else out of this game except enjoyment.
---
If they're going to pollute anyway then you're welcome for keeping them out of backyard~
---
Sig tanking null anoms in a cruiser is what makes afk bullshit isk farming possible.  Do people afk face tank in domis?  I've not seen it if they do.
---
If you can show me, using reddit formatting code to right justify a table in a reddit post, I'll gladly do it.
---
i think we're both losing what the original point and counterpoint even was.
---
During the time it took you to set up the highway and migrate south, you did no defending of sov or anything of any real value or consequence - the same thing that these nubees are sperging about Nancy doing right now.
---
Actually CODE is NCPL 'alt' heavy alliance.
---
Word, they aren't different packs? Rip me, long live what small munny I have left.
---
Year? Shit..what provi is to NC, tribute will be to Goons. It's gonna be perma NC fish barrel farming.
---
Let me translate what PVP means - Player versus Player, theres a player in a combat ship shooting another player , F1 yeah best shortcut...or u trying to say that PL dosn¬¥t have real players we were only shooting npcs inside PL?? 
---
What i see from PL is dread bombing one single player ratting "non pvp fitted"or droping over rorquals ... And u call it not pvp but "Elite Pvp" ...Imagine a PL pilot complaining about f1 over a fleet ...amazing days we live! xD xD
---
It is for all practical planning purposes when you're talking fleet combat.  You plan as if the dread is going to die, making that a certainty doesn't change the calculus of using them/Spears.  It's a sacrificial ship where you basically just calculate whether the cost of your bomb is higher than the target and go or don't go accordingly.
---
Right!?  It happens so often!  It hurts my soul knowing that people cannot take two seconds to use the proper word.  The worst part of this is that loose will be synonymous with lose in the dictionary in fifty years.
---
Language is fluid should not mean "people too lazy to use proper spelling or grammar."
---
Please note that the above rant applies mostly to native English speakers.
---
&gt;Plus an active mobile cyno shutter module for black ops battleships (single targeted, immobilizes the blops for a while, have 15 seconds spool up, shuts down active cynoes
---
What if the marauder version was an AOE version of this?
---
(Though finding a PVP role for a ship explicitly intended for PVE is kinda silly)
---
This is what I was going for indeed.
---
Fun with friends who are assholes...
---
The silly thing is they make them so hard to tackle as well - HICs should be able to receive remote reps when using scripts.
---
Don't forget the few million SP you had to put into Learning skills.
---
So this opportunity cost thing that they keep crowing about is actually only a big deal because they can't crab in delve during war?
---
Link your lossmail
---
&gt;Titans benefit from being able to move, not siege and DD.
---
Also, you know, having massively more EHP.
---
Us newbies already are claiming sov in Tribute. It's good for the game that NC failscaded. Goons are leaving us to it as well. Which is nice.
---
i think i'm weaselior, who the hell are you
---
Well your pet 'guard dog' alliances in The Spire ping for CTA's on a regular basis to shoot enemy structures and almost every time bring in alliance from outside The Spire (BOT/TRI/SLYCE/NC) to help. He was the latest MAX CTA kill - over 200 guys from 7 alliances to kill an Astra https://zkillboard.com/related/30001542/201906232300/o/%7B%22A%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22B%22%3A%5B%2298553685%22%5D%7D/
---
Does kind of make sense since it's a one time use thing though. All the packs are a much better deal than just subscribing, which is the point.
---
Will take isk donations sir
---
One small step at a time...
---
Yeah but there are plenty of times it pops up because you have a buy order well below average sell price on low volume stuff. So, even the price you want to set is below the average.
---
There are differences between that war and this lulzy whateveritis. 
---
WWB (which you may be familiar with as Casino War because of /reasons nobody understands) was your own doing and it was us (not that much) and rest (not that much either) against you (a lot of bees, and i mean A LOT), yet you managed to fuck up so much that your own allies turned against you and they chased you all across the map down to Delve. 
---
Now its like you (a lot of bees ... again, and i mean A LOT) against us (not that much ... again) and despite the numbers regional iHubs still hold.
---
tl;dr:  WWB was a few against CFC conflict with a cause even you allies recognized. This north zerg is merely something that, according to even this threat nobody gives two shits about, probably a trollfail and whatnot.
---
What we have here is a feedback loop. You dont want to put out the effort to roam which makes less targets. Other people roaming cant find targets so they stop putting in effort to roam thus less targets. So on and so forth.
---
we know .....
---
Because the bulk of rats are using old AI, the NPC mining fleets, Triglav, and diamond rats are examples of the newer AI that can retreat to warp.
---
On EveJobs? Nah, just a coward.
---
Well mushrooms do feed on detritus.
---
Somewhere in the vicinity of 3 minutes give or take.
---
I thought about that after the post, actually.
---
I think that adds another interesting dynamic there. If you have to bridge in the fuel trucks that makes pulling out take significantly longer, increasing the chance of being third partied and vastly increasing the amount of coordination required to extract a deployed capital fleet. Eventually it would wind up costing more isotopes than a fuel truck can carry to bridge even one over, too.
---
Yeah that income issue...is an issue.  Not even gonna argue with that.  I was just talkin' smack regarding Snuff.  That's all.
---
I defended the alpha injectors, but this is pretty obviously CCP just selling SP.
---
What the fuck dudes?
---
I know that the example there is obviously a metaphor, but I think the fact that in reality the frog would 100% jump out and not die is kind of telling.
---
for sure. unfortunately that's ccp's problem not mine.
---
I didn't phase that right, I meant whatever part of that advantage is driven specifically by umbrella rorqs will fade out as other factors overcome it.  The advantage doesn't just go away, no.  For instance, the advantage driven by OTEC for goons and PL has faded over the years as new things like rorqs and lifeblood have had their effects, but the super fleets built of OTEC didn't just vanish.
---
Not really. We didn't drop any fortizars as part of the evacuation plan. It took a single week to "organize all the retards" and one horrid week to perform the move ops, and that was only because an incursion spawned in a choke point on our route as we were going. It didn't take months. We mobilized inside of a month tops, and that's from the initial decision being made at the top level, before any of the people who did work (like me) were informed.
---
Thank you. Had no idea what people were talking about but everyone seemed to be in on it.
---
Back when I used to try to get other people to play Eve, an answer I heard a lot was ‚ÄúMy characters will always be weaker than vets with a bunch of skill points.‚Äù That‚Äôs a big barrier to entry and it only gets worse with time. 
---
Now that I‚Äôm inactive that skill gap is another reason I hesitate to resub. 
---
If you love Eve and want it to last a long time then try to think systemically and try to understand the nuance of balancing new players needs with old. If all you care about is your own advantage then please keep bitching about CCP ruining everything. 
---
In the meantime I think I might resub a couple of my accounts so I can get in on this deal.
---
Don't strawman me.  That wasn't my argument.  Just pot vs kettle bro.
---
Yep.  Everyone I talked to is having a pretty good time.  The only sucky thing is the time zone tanking, but you take what you get.  
---
Lots of fleets.  
---
Lots of things to shoot.  
---
Lots of super/Titan fleets, 
---
Lots of PAPs.  
---
A nice narrative.  
---
Tears...so many tears.  
---
The sov warfare has been not awful, because it‚Äôs generally not been contested.  
---
The structures have not been as bad either for the same reason.  
---
Chilling out on comms and bring a ton of bash ammo.  Worse ways to spend a day.  Not ‚Äòleet‚Äô PvP, but we are Goons after all.  
---
Really...I think the average line member is having a pretty good time.  I know that‚Äôs not the narrative that NC/PL want to hear, but is my honest assessment.  We would love them to show up, but their decision to sit this one out really is not much of a deal breaker to the average line member.  
---
When a random fleet is pinged, it fills up in just a moment with people asking about a second one....I expect we can keep doing what we are doing all summer/fall long.
---
What a poor. I have 67 keepstars.
---
Selling Skill Points that appear from thin air is moving the game towards a Pay-To-Win model.  CCP is testing the waters with this decision launching a small pack that's marketed towards "new players".
---
Worse
---
you suck m8. no one wanted you as CSM. Get over it.
---
&gt;As opposed to making minor adjustments to values within the game, can we instead work towards resolving the overarching issues and work our way down?
---
That takes years.  This takes minutes, and is not a replacement for that years of work.
---
I read the whole thing waiting for the Eve related punch line. I feel cheated.
---
Now we know what CCP's fix for the cliff of player retention they showed. Players need more SP (for a fee of course) to get into the game quicker.
---
wow, saw a couple of the wrecks.. do I go through there that much?
---
This made my day. Booooosh
---
by using that 1 low for a DC they cant use it for a bulkhead. i may not be they best pilot in the world, but im fairly positive that would result in less raw hp.  so then it becomes a question of : do i get a some better resists or do i get some more cargo space or do i get more raw hp. It adds a little bit more flexibility, as well as unpredictability.
---
Come on, the signs were written on the wall quite a while ago. Eve just isn't FUN anymore.
---
I'm just not sold on the cyno jamming bit, I'd rather a basic inhibitor not suck
---
We did, actually. We had a modest reconquest of Pure Blind occurring before the crystallizing moment that convinced us to leave. I personally dropped ihubs and upgraded them, even. Don't confuse us being ineffectual with literally giving up. They're not the same thing.
---
I tweeted at CCP from a twitter account of my character name that I RMT'd a couple of weeks after I did to try to get it to show up on the o7 show and nothing ever happened.
---
Everyone on Reddit completely shit all over GSF for doing THE EXACT SAME THING.  But now all of a sudden it is a great plan?  You are the idiot here bud.
---
Pretty sure right now CCP will take anyone that pays.
---
Not gonna happen.  Again, too boring.  There's a reason RL militaries use guard duty as pseudo-punishment.
---
Also, there's virtually nothing a guard can do against gankers under our current game mechanics.
---
Yeah it could help in some cases. It would not jump ships which already were bridged back, though. In my experience when cyno inhib is about to shut down cyno (its cycle is going to end soon), some extra forces inevitably jump in.
---
I mean... after 
---
 * $ -&gt; isk
---
 * $ -&gt; isk -&gt; T2
---
 * $ -&gt; time -&gt; SP + extractors -&gt; skills -&gt; % boni
---
This really isn't surprising and actually a QoL change.
---
CCP is desperate; to retain new players that is.  Eve has a horrible retention rate.  I suspect that CCP has determined that slow skill progress is one culprit.  Offering a cheap, one time per account, DLC for  SP may help in that regard.  Maybe they did break a promise to the community but without new blood in the game it will die.  I hope it works.
---
Implying a sub to get the 1mil SP from the event was free?
---
No when has that ever happened.  We have always been bad and spectacular in our dumbness. Dont try to take that away from us.
---
We at least made attempts to defend
---
some years ago they super fucked cosmos sites to prevent the afk farming but that messed just about everything up so they halfassed it and a bunch of stuff only spawns once or twice a day when before it was every hour or so, but the rats still respawn every 15 mins.
---
How do you know they haven't adapted.
---
Doesn't install confidence and I'm concerned with what they were messing with to cause this.
---
Hellos. You're not USTZ, are ya? Cos if you are, can has fite next time we come over?
---
If they cost as much as a titan, I'm pretty sure GSF would be willing to trade these 1:1 to kill off enemy titans. This suggestion would literally be a buff to Goons and a nerf to everyone else.

&gt;So, sure, they‚Äôre not going to be as expensive as a Titan, but they‚Äôd cost ‚Äòsomething‚Äô.
---
Again, at a large-alliance scale, Titans are cheap.  This spear ship will be super-cheap.
---
&gt;which would make it a calculated risk to bring them up against titans.
---
Why?  We already throw suicide dreads at titans and they've got a relatively low chance of working against a massed fleet on something like a Keepstar grid.
---
You give Goons, Test and everyone else these ships, and we'll bring at least 250 to *every single* big capital battle.
---
no, but what it does is fundamentally undermine ccp's credibility.
---
they explicitly said this shit would NOT happen, and was the only reason people actually put up with injectors to begin with.
---
Um we killed 4 Titans which at the time was the largest titan loss since B-R on some gate I dont remember with hurricanes and dreads.
---
Gah, I forgot to move my fleet out of the hangar. Guess I'll get it out of AS in a few weeks.
---
Interesting but I keep remembering that they are just numbers some dev stuck in there.
---
I've been part of my group since the 5th day of it's existence. It's over six years now.
---
I like our culture and ethos.
---
I have fun things to do every day from small fights to space work to big battles.
---
You can't use it on a character that's younger than 35 days though. Although it still can be abused heavily if you purchase a lot of skill injectors. It gives you +20% damage for turrets/missiles so if you're a whale you can inject a character into a ship that's more powerful than it should be short term. (The accelerator stops working after your character is 35 days old).   
---
To be fair these accelerators still work exactly the same as the ones that were given away in the boxed editions of eve, but now we have skill injectors which have potentially opened the flood-gates to 'whale smurf' accounts. It probably won't happen that often but there certainly are some areas where I think they can be abused. (Abyss 1v1s, Ganking alts, Dread Alt etc.)
---
This has been brought up to CCP.
---
I am all for it, if it is one time, but we all know it won't.
---
Cool, you retain new players, they are interested for a year. But in that time old players quit, because the PvP and sov mechanics are awful and CCP aren't improving the . Nothing keeps them interestd and.logging, there is no one left to prop up new players in their adventures
---
What then?
---
Ah. Virtue signalling then.
---
yes they are, fc what are injectors. The relevant part is 
---
&gt; all the skillpoints available to buy on the market in EVE will have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate.
---
&gt; will have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate.
---
and that's been untrue for a long fucking time.
---
The amount of effort required to get fun content has certainly risen over the past couple years. Probably would have quit by now if not for the community. For now I'll just coast until I deplete my PLEX stores, because I sure as hell am not giving CCP any more money.
---
It wouldn't just be goons.  I'm pretty sure TEST would put Spear caches all over the map.
---
How are your sand rashes doing?
---
&gt;Cyno mass limit?
---
And other terrible ideas.
---
HI I'M VILY WELCOME TO JACKASS
---
Well I assume your trolling.. But eve wont survive under a pay to win golden ammo model. Hell even plex for better drops is appalling and repulsive. I would drop eve so fast if any of this got implemented and ive been in since 2012 im not "new". Lewtboxes need to die simple as that. 
---
If you want ccp to make more money then give newbros a reason to stick around work with new player corps to get newbros into them without them having to go out of game and ask for help. Give new bros a cheat sheet to start.. This stuff is easy player retention. But no this new agency should do it.. Round three right.
---
All that smack on Snuff today that they are killing lowsec is literally a direct effect of the Lifeblood patch. Without that patch the 1300 Snuff members atm would form a t least 3 different groups, SC would still be alive, Aridia had a nice russian-german bromance growing (LSH &amp; AXIOS). There was a new french block forming in Solitude, still quite noobish but with some numbers (for Lowsec) and very motivated .... Siege Green was much stronger on their own than they are now ... you could write this list on for pages ....
---
I remember on a particularly buggy day I flew 16 jumps from jita in a DST with a load of gear to my wormhole, upon jumping into the wormhole I got teleported back into Jita 4-4 station.
---
And that is why the servers crash due to "database errors"
---
Man I already know a few people who just did that, it's really gonna suck in FW where not that much SP is needed to be sufficient in one ship/fit.
---
Don't bother.... sadly. I sent a bug report to CCP with this Topic

Hey CptBeacon,
---
  Thank you very much for commenting. Constructive comments from ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù of an engagement are incredibly valuable imo and I honestly appreciate you posting on this video. 
---
You said,
---
‚ÄúI disagree in a lot of stuff said but that's a very different subject.‚Äù
---
If you have the time, I‚Äôd enjoy hearing what you disagreed with and/or any other thoughts you have.
---
Lowsec is alive and well. We have fun and are doing just fine without these nullsec shenanigans. I'm actually worried CCP will "fix" lowsec  .....
---
Yeah, I have noticed less fighting in Uedama.  I went through Uedama last week on my way to Jita.  Uedama was almost empty.  I saw only one member of Code.
---
Adding a new player value pack and unfucking the game aren't mutually exclusive, dipshit.
---
Take your NPC shit and shove it, they are real people that wanted to try not a derogatory term used to belittle people you don't agree with or think are faked.
---
Hatred is the only thing that drives war in Eve. Why wouldn't you encourage the game's best content creator?
---
Welcome to r/eve. Lots of the people here don't even play the game and constantly complain about the games current state. The people that enjoy it are actually in-game and playing.
---
Nah retris are cool. Just depends how many you bring. I'm not taking a fight I have no chance of winning.
---
I assume this is also for accounts new and old?
---
If it was for relatively new accounts I could see this as one of those level up tokens from WoW (albeit smaller scale), but if this also applies to old existing accounts: yikes.
---
I doubt it is far enough.
---
Can you contract all your stuff to EVE UNI?

They do so much good for the game.

You can contract them to Spodbrain McSpody in Jita. Ty

There is no coming back from this mechanics if you are not into multibox-rorqual-mining for multiple hours a day ....

FTFY -.-   ...
---
I could be wrong, but I feel like the bigger discussion than "Is this accurate?" is, "Is this helpful?"
---
I suspect (but you are likely more experienced on the topic) it's helpful for the people who need to make a point about how just because they're "high-functioning" doesn't mean that they don't still have things to deal with.  On the other hand, it isn't helpful for explaining how to accommodate people or what kind of problems appear beyond perceptions.
---
I remember a WWB where you were ran out of your own home and ran to delve with your tails between your legs.  Same war by chance?
---
I'm an asshole :)
---
https://youtu.be/UrgpZ0fUixs
---
Kek. I bet the survey for the anniersary event showed that people absolutely loved the SP as a reward.
---
And some sales guy saw this.
---
And the rest is history.
---
Define valuable.....
---
For those out of the loop: The new starter pack contains a booster that gives +20% damage (rof for missiles) for chars unter 35 days old.
---
You say these are only "balance the ships" changes, so I am not going to repeat that none of these would affect the current gameplay dominated by TZ tanking, zero-risk Citadel games and Supercap proliferation. 
---
Still, you managed to ignore some ships that beg to be balanced and completely reworked (Rorqual, the burst change is laughable) and to propose a buff to ships that significantly contribute to the current miserable state of the game (Minokawa)...
---
I'm not saying this is as bad as CCP's recent "changes to the character animation", but pretty much waste of time - yours and everyone else's. We can balance and tweak things if the game is back into a healthy condition...
---
No, its all going to the Environmentalists Against the Low Sec Gate to Stain Association.
---
We undocked all day every day in Saranen, at least.  We kicked so much ass in there NC had to regularly drop their entire super fleet on a few Hurricane fleets because we were doing so much damage to their carriers/faxes.  NC isn't even doing that.
---
You are asking people to feel bad for the guys making 200 skill farm accounts to randomly generate SP to sell. I can't bring myself to shed tears for them.
---
Something similar happened to me the other day when I looted the jetcan that dropped after I scooped my MTU - jetcan disappeared but nothing appeared in my hold. Even jumping didn't make things reappear; only docking did.
---
You could as long as you don't have to buy ships and ammo, or lord forbid fighters/drones. The issue is mainly people trying to have fun and still plex, really when eve becomes I gotta get paid, and not I wanna go do this cause I can, it's not a game, it's a job

This is the underrated comment of the thread.

Implying renter pings have anything to do with the main coalition.
---
Balanced
---
its identical to the new player cerebral accelerator that has been in the game since 2011, CCP is just moving away from an implant to a drug
---
i haven't redeemed it yet, but if it's like the other SP packages you redeem when you drag it to a character it goes in to your unallocated SP pool rather than as an item you can put on the market.
---
so short version; no, but i haven't tested it.
---
they apply to existing accounts just like the Galaxy/Meteor/Star packs. Everybody gets 1
---
This is disgusting.  They log in, pay for a hack, and then I instantly de-materialize.
---
But this dps only between 1.6-3 km. Any ship with dualwebs or drones with mwd will kite and wreck this comet.
---
All you need someone there to do is Web the freighter into warp. Easy job. Also halves the time the freighter takes to get where its going.
---
I agree actually. Will add to future lists
---
No. Its like the Anniversary SP. Once it's redeemed it's plugged in as unallocated SP
---
In the beginning there was nothing. Then CCP said 'Let there be  SP' and free SP suddenly materialized out of nothing
---
If you're surprised by this, you haven't been paying attention.
---
Lol
---
also worth noting that the booster can't be used on characters over 35 days old.
---
You joke, but I've often wondered what would happen if NPCs showed up and even just randomly put structures into final timer and didn't come back to get the killmail.  How many opportunists would notice and finish the job?
---
That's obvious, I want to know if there's a lore reason, not just a game mechanic reason for this.
---
FAIR AND BALANCED GAME MECHANIC
---
Seems like you had a stroke while typing that dude.
---
I what ever you think you must scale it to min/max numbers. If you are failing to do that your post is a waste of time and energy.
---
The cerebral accelerator dials up your ship's damage?
---
Since when?
---
Thanks for the SP CCP! If only you could turn off the 1 per account limit, I was saving up for the steam summer sale but I could be persuaded.
---
wew, that sentence hits the nail and sinks it with 1 blow ....
---
How dare ccp act like a business! It's like its a company or something! The Audacity to want to make money ... *swipes credit card... how dare you all take advantage... *accepts charges... it's not an ingame item its skill points and not even a large amount of them.
---
Oh my mistake. I thought that's what you were asking :)
---
Think of it in a different perspective. It is the players who find ways to break literally everything in this game. The SP extraction mechanics and even timers are broken due to players choosing to fuck over the player base for profit, AKA capitalism. CCP is just providing a service to people who choose not to line the pockets of greedy players who have to much fucking isk that they don‚Äôt know what to do with it.
---

---
they bad.
---
That reminds me, I should give all my stuff to Eve Uni.
---
My dread doesn‚Äôt even have enough fuel for a return jump, that‚Äôs how dreads are used.
---
Alpha injectors are about the same or even less efficient than being subbed and training normally, they make sense.  
---
having no details on the new pack other than $5 for 1mil sp that sounds way more sketchy.  If it's new accounts only it could make some sense getting new players into stuff instead of spending time training a bunch of core skills could be nice, although it should probably be a universal new player thing rather than a paid requirement.  
---
And of course if anyone can just buy 1mil sp that's something else that plenty of people here have written a whole lot more on.
---
Spools up the jump drive boys!

Wtf i love snuff now

This seems very op to me somehow...
---
It was discussed pretty widely at the time, The negotiations were with Sort but Sort cleared the deal with Vince/NC. Sort talked about it on Talking in Stations and no one disputed what had happened. I remember PH guys saying ‚Äòyou might have had agreement with Vince but no one told Gobbins/PH‚Äô. If I get enthusiastic I might search for a reference, but everyone will blame Darkness regardless so it won‚Äôt change anything :D
---
How dare they use skill points as compensation for server issues! The hypocrisy!
---
I thought the pheonix was on this honestly but the xl torp buff to me would be so massive for the pheonix
---
What‚Äôs that from?  Seems really familiar
---
Making the magic 14 baseline would also help, but /r/eve collectively  REEEEE's whenever that is brought up too.
---
I dont doubt that discussion will happen at some point
---
Ideas start with rough outlines and are chiseled into exacts later on. Sometimes wrong ideas spark better ideas etc.  Sorry that brainstorming on the internet bothers you sir. 
---
Also, your birth was a waste of time and energy. 
---
&lt;3
---
Starting a caladari character -- railgun vs hybrid which is better short term and long term.
---
Going back further /u/ccp deleted the boot.ini
---
i mean, if you think about it - it is.
---
you can only use it on chars under 35 days old, who will have shit skills - so all it's really doing is putting their dps on par until they can get the skills trained to actually be on par so they aren't spending the first 3 days getting assfucked because they're new.
---
Oh I don't know, rumour reaches me that there are still plenty of citadels in W-space.
---
In fact I'm sure I recall Brisc mentioning something about that.
---
The feedback ive gotten is that as a shipping platform the bowhead needs some love.
---
FYI you can petitions to just get one since the spawn is broken and CCP is going to fix it anytime soon
---
I think the answer was "yes" and that was the problem.
---
Works even better when you realize the director of the music video though the song was called "Egghunter" instead of Headhunter. I may or may not blast this when I'm flying a saber.
---
u fly the dominix now
---
Also Titans were supposed to be rare, than CCP thought "If we implement capital mining and make it nearly limitless scaleable in Multiboxes, surely nobody exploits that to the edge and now makes 1 region spit out the amount of ORE in 1 weekend all of EVE mined in 2 weeks before ..."
---
As usual they were wrong and underestimated the sheer autism of a lot of players that claim to really enjoy staring at a moon for multiple hours on multiple screens ... but then I hear rumours of people even tabbing out and doing this afk with bots to warn them if danger arises ...
---
You're right, but that had then been broken a long time ago through all the free SP and whatever else we've gotten. And anything extracted like that is still under the extracting/injecting rules (lower SP for higher SP).
---
I still think this is bad overall, don't get me wrong.
---
&gt; while we make sure there is one single mechanism that brings new skillpoints in to the system ‚Äì training.
---
Clearly false.
---
There's nothing stopping someone from buying the 1m SP and then extracting them and selling them on the market.
---
Not even a good try, keep participating buddy.
---
You aren't accounting for the fusion reactors outputting energy which is used to regenerate shields or armor.
---
So your answer to the question presented is ‚Äúno it would not be helpful‚Äù? 
---
Just trying to clarify. It seems you may have trouble communicating with others. 
---
WWB was lost because Goons refused to stop the bleeding in SMA space. When the blood was in the water all it took was a minor diplo issue to light the fire. The only reason Goons aren‚Äôt still in Deklein is pure complacency, and this helicopter dicking on everyone smaller shows they learned that lesson at least.
---
Your starter nation is really just an aesthetic choice. It doesn't matter, because if you want to, you can train and fly everything.
---
Because they are baseliners flying basic ships, and we are cybernetically enhanced space gods in ships that cost more money than a lot of planets have to spare?

How do you wanna attract newbros when you google about the state of the game, which you normally do when you start a new big game, and only find posts that say the game stagnates and is nto fun to play in its current state.
---
This, but ironically with a VG flair.
---
its already p2w in some regard. you can spend money on injectors and on plex and just buy your way into a fully fit faction titian on the 2nd day...
---
it would cost a lot but its possible.
---
if the game ever gets 'cheap' to reach those levels then im totally out. already its some what depressing that ive been around sense 05 and players who have been in for a year can have more SP than I.
---
imo they should cap the amount of SP any one player can gain per year from injectors
---
These numbers have nothing to do with policy or platform and they certainly do NOT reflect my personal opinions on either of the 2. Maybe you should shove it.
---
I suspect that would require an ecm rewrite to make work.
---
Like the poor griffin navy i have no ideas how to fix
---
They are new packs, they show that I can get them, totally getting these on my mains next billing cycle.
---
Lol goons posting this is like "look at me daddy ncpl! I can pvp too!"
---
They just extracted the SP from banned accounts.  Right guise?
---
Lol that is funny :P
---
This gonna be my pick for /r/eve post of the year.
---
In theory, yes
---
You have to do missions for agents of the faction.
---
I think there's two big differences: 
---
1) There is no real-life money involved in the referral bonus. So yes this SP does not strictly originate on a character where it was trained at the normal rate, but there's also no way to use cash to gain any progress or advantage in-game.
---
2) The SP in the starter pack was a much smaller amount (1/4th), and the pack included other more valuable and significant in-game benefits, namely Omega time. This new pack contains really nothing of value except for the SP, and a huge amount of flat SP at that (more than 6 injectors' worth for a 80m+ SP char), so it's a step toward direct SP-for-cash transactions.
---
Yeah, you can actually feel the salt on your skin reading that.
---
Model
---
It looks like bumping to me?
---
Even the minerals quit afk cloaky camping cause it was bad gameplay
---
Holy hell that dps
---
Depends what you're trying to accomplish? PVP? PVE?
---
yeah.
---
compared to buying 1m SP from the market, this is bargain basement pricing.
---
yeah just saw that, still, the direct SP injection is still pretty bonkers
---
people in rs always said rwt tho
---
What if was a Cyno Scrambler?  
---
Instead of preventing it, any Cyno's lit on grid would pop out the ships in a random distance away from said Cyno?  
---
It would open up the incoming capitals / gank squad to being isolated by a counter fleet that was ready? Friendlies can communicate with the Marauders to time their jump in once it cycles off for a pinpoint counter drop.  
---
Instead of "Hey, bastions prevent us from dropping in" to "Hey, IF there's a bastion mod on the field we miiiiiight get into a sketchy situation"
---
Yep, what querns is saying is right because we called it the Cock-pocket because of http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Fade/C-OK0R that system in Fade. We recaptured that constellation, upgraded the sov, and this is where Atrum invented the meta fit of the cheap, disposable, ratting Myrmydon to get ADMs up which with the coming VNI nerfs seem to be posed to make a comeback as an alternative for the botter crowd to use given their cheap nature.
---
CCP: *The beatings will continue until /r/eve morale improves!*
---
On one hand, I get it. A lot of our new people get frustrated with the time it takes to get into the 'good' ships, largely because they don't feel useful. A million SP can put someone with a Merlin into a Harpy or a Ferox into an Eagle. We have a lot of ewar frigates for them and we talk up their utility as much as we can, but I get their impatience. 
---
On the other hand, the fact that you have the option to pay for SP is just an indisputable pay-to-win. It was one thing when vets could liquidate their unwanted skills to sell to newbies except for the tiny detail that they were really being bought by other, richer vets who want to twink their alts or people with more RL money than sense.
---
I believe the angle they're going for doesn't include "compensation" SP, or SP originating from limited time events like the anniversary. It's more referring to SP faucets, or the ability to just buy SP from CCP directly.
---
Have you looked at Niarja, it is rather busy.
---
My money is on a FOB quite literally stealing the ore out your hanger.
---
the complaint it about the 1 mil SP packs from the login event not the chat issues.
---
You are a fucking stain, and yes dropping on pubbie renters in delve is more fun than a sov grind, perhaps you should try the game sometimes.
---
I honestly cant tell if this is a joke or not
---
Can only be used on a character that is less than 32 days old I believe.
---
Why are you writing in all caps again? :D
---
" There's nothing stopping someone from buying the 1m SP and then extracting them and selling them on the market. "   
---
Which was first trained by the person doing the extracting...
---
As someone who missed the 1m login promotion by 3 hours, I am happy to see this offering. Sure, I lose $5, but I get to farm salt on reddit. :D
---
The Lif getting more CPU makes a ton of sense as currently you lose your extra lowslot to a CPU increase mod in order to actually make your typical fit work. So basically it ends up being a -1 mid version of the minokawa currently.
---
I know, that‚Äôs the case for other factions but I can‚Äôt find any agents for the imperial war reserves
---
Well, TIL.
---
This makes me slightly more OK with the new booster then (but still seems dumb when coupled with the ability to inject a dread on Day 1)
---
Yeah I think the big difference is that you couldn't get free/referral SP  with cash, so there's no way to gain in-game progress/"advantage" with real-life money. I don't think this specific pack is catastrophic, but I do think it's a step toward SP being freely available in the market in a way that CCP said would never happen.
---
Eve has already been around a long time.  It‚Äôs not going to be here forever.
---
if you have to ask this, then you are not ready for a titan
---
You have managed to build a Nyx in a wormhole?
---
air quotes
---
&gt; noun [ plural ]: a pair of quotation marks gestured by a speaker's fingers in the air, to indicate that what is being said is ironic or mocking
---
if you're going to pitch a fit about the 1 mil from the event why not pitch one about the 250K SP packs they handed out to compensate for being shit at making the game work?
---
Oh ok, I thought there was something wrong with how I wrote it or something like that.
---
It's barely been a day and Olmeca is already shitting up the game. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS?!
---
There are actually two kinds of drifters.  (Well, three, but the third is a target type in triglavian filaments.)
---
The kind that are in wormhole space are spawned if you shoot a specific structure at the end of a wormhole combat site in C5 and C6 space, you spawn the Drifter Response Battleship.  It drops 300M of blue loot tags, as well as being salvageable.  If you don't know what you're doing, you'll lose ships to it because it's ridiculous, although it doesn't have the fuck-you beam: it goes 2km/s, has a 200km point, has matter disruptors that do around 2k DPS, and neuts like several bhaalgorns.  (If you don't plan for it, a drifter can empty a dread's capacitor in under two minutes.)  It also has three warp core stabilizers, so you need four points on it to hold it in place, and it tries to warp off when it gets below half armor.  The one piece of good news is that it relentlessly targets the largest signature nearby, so it's pretty easy to manage aggro from them.
---
The ones in k-space are different (they have the murderbeam, for one thing), and I don't think drop tags.  They might drop other materials that could be interesting for something or another, however.  IIRC, they're the backup fleet for Autowhateverthefuck Lancers, which drop a material needed for entosis modules.
---
You've actually done this? Petitioned for a quest item?
---
CCP lies to make more money. Why would anyone be surprised.
---
Yeah, that's the sort of explanation I want for these changes. If there's a reason why the fitting specifically strongly disadvantages a ship (especially in ways its counterparts aren't) and there's no counterbalancing advantage, then a buff might be warranted. I just think those explanations need to be offered.
---
Please go away.
---
Oh no! They start with a bit more SP! Whatever shall we do!?
---
Hold up what did I miss?
---
unless there was such a thing as skill injectors, so you can have a dread alt with 20% bonus dps. Then it would be basically pay to win.
---
Yeah but then you're not AFK and at that point why the fuck are you using a VNI-replacement
---
Haha you got baited into working the CSM for a dying game.
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt get the impression that Nyth was putting the other side down. 
---
‚Äúyou don't actually give any real analysis on what they could have done better (beyond, the Apoc could have warped)‚Äù
---
There was constructive comment on Jackdaw, Orthrus, and Apoc positioning and statement about Tusker composition being difficult to fight if pilot positioning remained cohesive. 
---
‚ÄúStarting any kind of presentation and already cutting it down to be in the realm of 'boring or uninteresting' is a pretty big public speaking stumble.‚Äù
---
Cutting down your own content in opening is agreed to be frowned upon in relation to connecting to audience members and maintaining listener investment. 
---
However, I saw this as statement as managing expectations. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs inappropriate to let the audience know a featured content may not be Super Epic. This is probably an attempt to mitigate comments flaming for posting ‚Äúboring content.‚Äù
---
You complain about this yourself stating that the video gets boring in places, flash it up, and to provide more substance. 
---
The opening statements in the video acted as a disclaimer for possible unflashy content.
---
I love the narrative driven existence of GSF but remedial wouldn't recognize the abomination y'all have become....
---
OR he totally would and laugh his fucking ass off
---
I guess everybody starting a new character should be removed because it adds a few hundred thousand SP out of thin air! The witchcraft!
---
Yeah we had some tackle and like 8 dudes in retris and ishkurs. I figure any small group who lives around Amamake should be able to form something fun to fight that.

please keep your insights to yourself, 1st you compare apples with pears and 2nd why we would take advice from the representants of a group that ruined 1 EVE servers economy already ?

Which 3D printer did they use?

Think smaller tbh. GMVA can, but that's if we have enough dudes online. It's summer. Numbers are down everywhere.

Goons were always the good guys.
---
TIL, everyone not in a major bloc is an asshole.
---
I honestly would do the same :-) do you mind sharing the file? I could do my print too :-)
---
Lol you pos pubbie.
---
it's 1 character for 35 days.
---
is 20% dps on a dread for 35 days really going to make a shit of difference? structures have damage caps, and everything else you can just drop more caps on so it's not like you need to squeeze out every last drop of dps from each dread when you can just bring an extra dread.
---
At some point it starts to  become ridiculous.
---
Not sure if troll or serious, can anybody be that  ... limited?
---
&gt; You can't use it on a character that's older than 35 days though
---
Well that's a pretty fucking big detail OP (and everyone else) is leaving out...
---
&gt;still paying CCP money
---
&gt;Expecting things to change
---
I love gamers, so fucking oblivious to how businesses operate lol
---
Blasters are not difficult to use if you‚Äôre a newer player, railguns require some more thought, you could also try missiles.
---
I might do one sometime on freighter bumping. :Thinkingface:
---
Yeah, and ships were supposed to get close enough to it to be in range. And CCP are still living in the Red Moon Rising world of there only ever being one or two Titans in the game.
---
????????????????????????????????????????
---
that's literally my entire point. GSF was shat on and defended their actions (to no avail) on this pubbie messageboard (which made sense given their situation)
---
now it's GSF doing the shitting on Nancy, despite anyone capable of any sort of neuron-firing knowing its the best option for Nancy &amp; Friends.
---
The huge difference between "SP for ISK" and "SP for cash" is that the latter is not affected by the in-game market. 
---
Currently, the price of SP is determined largely by the price of PLEX. If PLEX doubled, then the SP produced by that PLEX will be expected to roughly double in value.
---
If SP were able to be bought directly for real-life money, this wouldn't be the case. The price of PLEX could quintuple and you would still be able to buy a flat amount of SP for a flat amount of money.
---
BRB smartbombing all these cancer pods
---
This offer is not new players only, you cocksalad and it is only the beginning of series of milking the cow before it dies.
---
I'm slightly concerned because slippery slope, but not yet truly worried. A once per account purchasable 1M SP injection does not yet make the game p2w and it doesn't really cause a major shift in terms of player power. To the SP market this is indistinguishable from MPCTs. Essentially, all it does is advance the players who want to spend the money by about 2-3 weeks for a single time. That's it. Really good for new players, very situational for older characters.
---
Pays to be vigilant in case this becomes anything other than a limited offer but for now my pitchfork stays in the shed. Might give it a slight sharpen so it's ready, just in case though.
---
we're not all unhappy that's why.
---
yup
---
Don't make it sound like some sort of noble sacrifice. A "war" was started on the principle that you don't harbor bots.
---
So don't harbor bots. Case closed. No ifs, ands, or buts. It doesn't matter whose bots they are or where they came from.
---
fucking gold ammo ccp
---
I for one would enjoy it.
---
lmao no u fed your canes a few times then stopped doing even that. lets not re-write stuff here.
---
That would all be true and fine before 2016... but with injectors there is no SP limit
---
Imagine going for a 1v1 against someone who just objected a new small gang character (not many injectors btw) and then just getting smashed cus of this booster. Not fair at all there is no real way you could have known that his comet which normally does say 200 dps is actually gonna do 20% more.
---
This is terrible for facwar, that's for sure. I wonder how many people will actually use this?
---
For a solid comet alt? One or two.
---
No what you are doing is voting with your wallet, showing CCP that this is something players accept and participate in, opening the door for more p2w shit.
---
Now do it on a scramkite rail comet and you won't lose a single fight to a t1 frig or destroyer. Don't fight a worm and you're golden.
---
Yours sincerely, someone who doesn't use wormholes.
---
pointed by their hopes and dreams...
---
Although broken and exploited, it is an existing player mechanics. CCP promised never to interfere in the economy. Period.
---
Underrated comment!

Olmeca Gold getting banned from bombers bar :laffo:
---
True, goons have forbidden anyone to join CODE. Why? Because CODE is truly neutral and kills anyone who doesn't follow the code. At the same time goons have the stupidest and/or wealthiest freighter pilots. Ergo, my first sentence.
---
Clearly there were some key numbers not in the region giving CCP and Hilmar the bonus contracted on them ...
---
There is always the concept of shipping up. Just maybe not arty cynabals with huginn webs and faxes that we literally can't do anything about.
---
Too bad this FW char is probably owned by someone completely trash tier would couldn't 1v1 himself out of a paper bag though.
---
That's assuming it even undocks! Reeeeeeeeeee
---
Yeah the 35 day thing makes it pretty balanced and even helpful to new folks which is awesome ( Anything to help player retention). I just happened to dump 175 injectors into a character because I was extra bored and the 20% damage on top of a 66 Mil SP Frigate / Destroyer pilot is silly.   
---
The screen shot also includes a 5% bonus from pyro II . Need to go grab some dose IV to see how much more I can squeeze out of it.
---
Can we shoot a monument already!
---
TBH after all this time, i realise that ccp only cares about new players who are willing to pour money into the game to catch up.  Old players are just "vampires".
---
legacy code
---
&gt;If SP **were** able to be bought directly for real-life money, this wouldn't be the case.
---
What exactly do you think "training over time" with a subscription you pay for, is?
---
Its in low sex my homie
---
Mechanically speaking, how is it different at this point to buy SP from CCP or a player? We have an unlimited amount of SP being made by farms, so we have crossed a threshold where it's not am arbitrary thing. Can you site where CCP promised to never impact the game economy? They have done it a lot over the years, I'm just curious in the language in it
---
Get out. Nobody care about wormholes
---
so you're going to be going up against like what, 2 dreads maybe 3 because of mass limits?
---
is it really that big of a deal?
---
Can they defend themselves? I doesn't even look like the Keepstar fought back.
---
He's referring to the accelerator/injector, not the SP, lmao. The SP is redeemable on anything (I just redeemed it on my 2011 200M+sp main!)
---
Ah, I was grammar trolled
---
Try to figure out yourself why youir post is bullshit.
---
hanger
---
so just assume everyone under 35 days is going to do 20% more damage.
---
now you know.

Look its true. Where are you "fighting CVA"? Did you even undock or do you only reddit warrior?
---
Your home is gone, and no matter how hard you go like ''lol i dont care about our structures"  we all know you cry a little bit when thinking how the hell you are going to get back on your feet as an alliance. 
---
The faster you admit your mistakes, the faster you get back on your feet.
---
also : the hypocrisy  you dont care about structures but grr goons dysonsphere. You care about pvp yet you do not fight tooth and nail. You guys could have dragged this war for months doing elite pvp. Are you no longer elite? Has all that gate camping gone to your head?
---
What language is that? I need to plug it into Google translate, I am not understanding you.
---
There are FAR better uses of time and isk than injecting a toon straight into a dread just for a 20% damage buff for a month.
---
No matter how much isk you have, this isn't remotely worth the cost.
---
Uedama has regularly been an invasion system the last month. 
---
Camping gates or randomly bumping someone is a bit hard when an NPC fleet of trigs could land on you at any moment.
---
i guess this is not over the line because it's "one-time use only"
---
but it's, in fact, over the line
---
You seem upset. You should probably get get up off your behind, stop watching yoru structures explode, and go get that chronic case of virginity induced nerd rage taken care of.
---
That was actually accidental lol, Kinda left caps on and the light no longer works on the keyboard...
---
Well enjoy the reward of failing to genocide Goons when you had the chance.
---

---
you wanna talk about how many titans died in wwb?
---
bro lmao
---
I mean pick one? Does it matter free sp from logging in for an event, or for reimbursement for each day issues it happens alot
---
Also: That booster has been in the game since 2011 (but in form of an implant) :P
---
How dare I speak my mind on the internet!
---
just the tip
---
just to see how it feels
---
You're so sexy when you put your foot down. Now say "mining is pinnacle pve" I'm almost there...
---
still into the cucking scene?
---
Usually 1-2 dreads and 1 fax, yes.
---
Lmao what year you think it is buddy ? It‚Äôs eve 2019 every idiot gets to own a Titan now. Adapt or die btw o7
---
I did as well!
---
From what I can gather the issue is skill points coming from a none ingame source. Can think of a number of time ccp has added sp to my character that came from. Nowhere. In a world you can buy plex and do effectively the same thing as these packs who cares? It's a way for newbros to catch up.
---
Well 33 PH, 18 PL and 18 NC are on that kill - they were quite happy to travel 2 regions to shoot a virtually uncontested structure whilst at the same time scoffing at Goonies for going around shooting uncontested structures.
---
If you're traveling for content you gotta be in something worth fighting. That's all.
---
There's at least a couple of differences between paying X dollars for 1 month of Omega time and paying X dollars for a flat amount of SP:
---
1) Skill attributes mean one month of Omega is not equivalent to some flat amount of SP. 
---
2) In order for the Omega-trained SP to be turned into unallocated SP you have to go through the in-game market, including buying extractors with PLEX. That means that the price of SP is not only determined by the cost of 1 month of Omega in real-life currency, but at least partly by the in-game economy.
---
You may disagree with those points, but surely we can agree that paying for a subscription which over the course of 1 month delivers you some amount of SP is not the same as "SP being bought directly with real-life money". The word "directly" means something.
---
Works every time.
---
it's only 2 dreads you'll be facing off against, it's not that much more dps than you're used to dealing with anyway.
---
it's not the "goon mindset" it's the fact that mass limits dictate that you can't bring more than 2 dreads without collapsing a hole, but there would still be mass left for extra guardians. or, alter your fleet comp to just bring more guardians from the start if you think the dps is going to be an issue.
---
Buffing things across the board isn't balance. That's power creep. This list needs a lot more nerfs
---
Blues Brothers?
---
Railguns are hybrids. If you mean missile vs hybrid, they‚Äôre both good for different things, but missiles are also better at pve
---
brb let me just inject a fresh character into a Titan so we can meet as equals on the field of battle.
---
the booster is old and has existed for long time through Recruit a Friend. It can only be used on characters less than 35 days old
---
Doesn't matter if you think it was weak. It was resistance. It existed. NCdot isn't even doing that. Don't engage in audacious reductionism.
---
It was a fuckup, but was not purchasable
---
You do understand that promises like that go out the window when a company is acquired by another, yes?

Music or Comms.  Frankly I want the version with the comms but when you can't hear either one why bother.
---
Much better deal. My toon is well over 80 Million SP so this pack is almost 7 skill injectors for me.
---
If I could upvote more than once...
---
I'll be waiting in the Novice.
---
Are you referring to the noun version of hangry?  If so, I would categorize portmanteaus differently than simple laziness.  It takes some wit to come up with a portmanteau that sticks.  They are generally created to fit a lexical gap and have a specific purpose.
---
Typing out loose when someone means lose is just wrong.  It isn't creating a new word to describe something, at least not intentionally.  I'm sure that an explanation will be given in the future as to why it was (improperly) used today.
---
The SP for server outages were compensation for times when characters *should* have been training but weren't, through no fault of the player.
---
This is just straight up selling non-player-created SP for real money.
---
&gt;It's a way for newbros to catch up.
---
They said the same thing about injectors. What demographic do you think gained the most benefit from injectors? I'll give you a hint, it wasn't the new players.

Are there any people who actually believe these false flag posters?

Honestly I feel like this might be going a bit overboard with the cargo bay. If anything I'd like to see it get a slight buff to warp speed.
---
I find it to be a wonderful platform for moving assembled ships, buffing its bay a bit too hard might wind up pushing out normal freight in some areas. It's already one of the safest of the freighters since you can fit a respectable tank and warp in 7 seconds using a 500mn mwd. I think pushing it further into the role of "Faster suitcase" might be better suited for it, give it a warp speed of 1.8-2.0 or so and increase its cargo hold to roughly 14,000 to give some incentive towards fitting cargo modules maybe?
---
If you do go down this path though, my suggestion would be to tone it back a little. If we're assuming its primary use-case is incursions, the ability to fit 2 battleships, 1 battlecruiser and 2 cruisers would let people haul around a full kit. A slight bit of love to its cargo hold would let it carry alternate fits and replacement drones/ammo as well. Though, with the changes you've proposed to the badger you could just give it enough room for that and the above and fill the hold of the badger with ammo.
---
You could say that to literally every little step along the way of skill trading.
---
Imagine if we went from no injectors to this overnight ? The summer of rage would be a wet firecracker compared to that.
---
That's not true, ships cannot initiate the jump after the cyno died unless something changed.
---
I believe this is just a random goon trying to troll goon haters, yes,
---
Or you mean this is goon hater trying to troll goons posters? :D
---
Imagine caring more about triggering random people on reddit for a minute than the fact that you're actively promoting p2w in a game that's already dangerously close to p2w.
---
Send me the Nyx and I will double it into a Titan.
---
While I like new ideas, this isn't a valid one. "Power creep" is a problem, not a solution.
---
You're drastically underestimating how much money the big alliances have. If the 95b for a fully-loaded Titan is not an amount to be concerned with, anything less than that is also irrelevant. If something like this existed, GSF and Test would be wandering the stars with hundreds of them, at all times.
---
The correct answer is correcting the over-power of certain ships/types and introducing weaknesses, not making something infinitely more powerful against them. There's probably a few hundred titans in the video above, each being at least 75-80b. If they afford that just to put down a structure that wouldn't even need 10% of that amount, there isn't a limit to what they'll spend.
---
Would give up all 200Bil in assets I own for a server wipe and pre 2016 gameplay. CCPlease.
---
It's not limited to new accounts tho.
---
You can have all the SP in the world and will still die without knowing how to pilot.  It's not really going to get anyone any wins.
---
you can't stop that booster by podding its consumer just fyi
---
Both?
---
Most of the actual content enjoying types are here because we get the support of a sliding window of people who we can ping to get a gang anytime, often some isk support to run pvp operations, and a big market, so I don't have to worry about income while running small gang.
---
If I left TEST I wouldn't get much more content as TEST never really gives good fights to roaming gangs in our space. There's just too much space to cover to be able to catch them and actually engage, even if it would be a good fight.
---
I could maybe shoot Brave or Warped? Not sure very many of my core people would leave to get those fights, though, so we'd be going from 10 man gangs to 3-5.
---
We'd probably end up having to completely leave this region of space, and try to find content somewhere else. Facwar is hilariously risk averse right now, leaving more or less Pure Blind / Tenal area or poking Horde in Geminate, which is just small gang vs blob 23/7. We could deploy there without leaving TEST and have no change to what content we get.
---
So for us, it doesn't matter.
---
Not what you said.  You said you make fun of them in Reddit.  Are you now claiming to be a destroyer of goon?
---
Do you guys have a USTZ or is it just smoke and mirrors? Cos we tried to come shoot you with some retris last night and everybody docked up and logged. We were like 40ly out of any kind of drop range, we really just had a frigate gang.

Please Stop Posting.
---
The part where you're wrong is your use of the word "generate" in your first post. Sure, mining and ratting, for the player, are the same - you do stuff and get isk. The difference is literally *where the isk comes from*.
---
And then you say "Nobody cares where it comes from". Yes we do. CCP does. The economy of the game cares about it, because ratting, just like every other isk generating activity (incursions, missions, blue loot) actively adds more isk to the game. It's printing money, it leads to inflation. That's why the plex prices are on the rise ever since it was introduced, because it's tied to a currency that *doesn't* get printed out (at such scale).
---
Mining, on the other hand, doesn't generate isk at all, it generates goods that players need to trade. There's no isk added to the economy, it's just added to your wallet from another player's wallet.
---
Spin spin spin spin.
---
yes,but de-facto they got 6 months since goons turn around and fly home after the deal.
---
Nah, don't change current bombs. Instead, make a larger class of bombs with 15x damage output and 10x explosion radius. Fit em on T3Cs.
---
Ccp tracks that so
---
Who the fuck flies freighters through Uedama anyway?
---
Dude, you are wrong, you can do whatever you want in big blocks and also make a lot of isk carbbing on sov space. I am part of one of those big blocs, and there are small groups on what you can have a lot of fun, also you can go solo or with a couple of friends and do whatever you want lol. But yes, if you can not see beyond the alliance pings and your home system, you are gonna get bored fast.

no you don't. When someone does farming, it's for the money. When you compare farming methods, you compare the end result, not if the game is balanced correctly around them.

How is buying a titan from CCP different from buying one from a player? We have an unlimited amount of minerals being made by miners so it's really no difference at all. Just sell titans and ships and everything for real money.

Hi OlmecaGold. XD  
---
Seriously though, who's ever Panfam alt this is, is bad and should feel bad.
---
Everyone knows the Starter Pack is for accounts younger than 35d old, right?
---
&gt;1)
---
Sure. But the buyer doesn't care how inefficiently you converted SP to isk. He only cares about his flat conversion of isk to SP
---
&gt;2)
---
Since the whole point of this is the connection to the *external* economy, arguing about the behavior of limited, smaller system is... pointless? 
---
I can convert $ to isk. How I do it doesn't matter. How many people decide it's worth their time doesn't matter. It only changes how much $ I have to spend to buy a certain amount of SP power, but it is still $ for power.
---
&gt;You may disagree with those points, but surely we can agree that paying for a subscription which over the course of 1 month delivers you some amount of SP is not the same as "SP being bought directly with real-life money". The word "directly" means something.
---
There is only a difference for the seller.
---
The buyer buys plex with $ sells the plex for isk and buys with isk whatever he wants.
---
Sure the word "directly" means something, but obscuring steps by having something be indirect doesn't change the nature of the thing.
---
I've been logi on multiple fleets in this war.  Only time I saw NC fight was when we attacked their caps with a subcap fleet, out of sheer boredom.  I'm sure you've read about their victory in here somewhere.

Great stuff as usual. The days of fighting PH in O-V will be missed. Backstory on the unlucky phantasm warp?
---
It's crazy that you believe what you put in print here
---
What are you actually talking about? I am so confused. I can find no reference anywhere to CCP "selling skill points" directly for money.
---
You can call it what you want, net effect is zero more IRL money going from me to CCP.
---
That made me cringe pretty hard.   Fucking figure it out, eh?
---
Slow skill progression or unrealistically high SP-requirements for end-game iskmaking? If CCP truly cared about EVE they‚Äôd delete Rorquals and walk back the carrier fighter changes back to drones. Making the most profitable activities high-SP also the low-engagement ones is toxic.
---
I call them "Surprise Boxes"
---
iam not deleting it :)

but thx for saving it anyways!

Is this where we ask questions to questions and not answer them?

We got SP for chat outages. The normal SP kept going during that time...

This is just the start, dont worry.

Aren't you the arfuss guy who got rekt in his super cause he had a worse fit than the t1 Rokh I used to run missions in before I had any idea what I was actually doing?

You'll just get yourself killed in a titan mate. Come back to brave space so I can get in on it though.

Because most people are risk-averse and lazy, and the last 3 years of changes introduced by CCP did a lot to facilitate the ‚Äûeasy mode‚Äù game style.

Low effort post.
---
They already exist.  Increasing the cost now would just render Goons permanently unstoppable (if they aren't already).  The only real option is to make them more counterable in the sub cap or cap range IMO
---
I'm glad I unsubbed in December. Nothing I've seen since, either from CCP or the community, has made me regret that decision.
---
Which couldn't even be bought with real money but through ingame grind. And whoever credited that to them gives EA too much credit. Trading cards in that form were introduced by MtG and lootbox foundation systems have been there before that too. Dont get me wrong, EA is shit and the idea too, but you're giving them way too much credit by pretending they invented that shit, theyre not that original.

your post reads like "I brought small fast stuff that can kite you for days while shooting you and run away if you threaten it in any way... why  won't anyone fight me?
---
I'm sorry, the SP we were getting for logging on while subscribed was not P2W because we had to reach the log in screen? And on a lesser scale, are we pretending those packs that came with Plex, MCT Certificates,  and skill extractors were being used by players to maximize play style and not immediately sold/used to inject an alt? If you consider bonus SP to be P2W, then CCP was already using P2W mechanics.  Frankly SP isn't that big of a deal, because SP is just time.  You do absolutely nothing in game to generate SP, aside from moving some implants and attributes around and focusing on certain skills to match those attributes.  From a new player perspective, this is actually useful for newbies, as they can start flying cooler ships immediately.  I think we need to wait and reserve judgment until after we see if this helps with player retention, because that is woeful.
---
what about the sp from the chat issues?

There's people who believe there's no bots in goons, so yea.
---
There's TDF who sometimes run 2 fleets, WTM, NGA, 2 Rattlesnake multi boxers, Fin fleet does HQ from time to time. There's also a new (i think) Chinese group that pops up every now and again.
---
Agreed.
---
Those NPCs weren't hired by players and the battle wasn't planned.  An NPC spawned near some enemy NPCs who started fighting and calling in backup. No one even saw the battle go down.
---
WITNESS ME!!!!!
---
Two simple questions: under the current system, how much SP can you buy for $20? And how much SP will you be able to buy for $20 in one month (assuming $20 gets you the same amount of PLEX)?
---
Are the answers to those two questions necessarily the same? If not, then the current system is different to buying SP directly with real-life money. It's not just "obscuring steps", it's changing the way in which you can exchange cash for SP. Specifically, it is changing from a system that necessarily goes through the in-game economy and everything that entails to one that doesn't.
---
That's not really any substantive insight as to the Tusker execution.
---
Secondly, saying you're going to make something boring, then making something boring, does not excuse it for being boring. "I did what I said I was gonna do" doesn't negate that the video can be better in some very easy to change ways. It's just not a good technique.
---
How is lower mass a bad thing?
---
Didn't want that time spent krabbing in the past anyway?
---
Polarize that bitch, and go to a C6 WR.
---
Unlimited local resources, unparraelled force projection, unprecedented safety. I'd come up with 3 more to match the downvotes, but I don't care enough to tell the common pvp redditor they are wrong again today.
---
I mean, isn't the log in bonus for omega players pretty much the same thing? I hate how cheap skill points are and skill trading seriously damaged the game, but this is really just more of the same. I miss  Dr. EyjoG....
---
Yes please enlighten us all about that number. Then be sure to provide the proof of all the titans in build that were killed.  The only people who really know are Goon leadership and CCP and both have been very tight lipped about those numbers. So unless you got the inside scoop from CCP you are speaking out of your ass bro.
---
That is quite the feat!  
---
I have not seen that particular misuse yet, but I am cursed to see it everywhere now!
---
The lag is so bad the goal posts appear to be rubber banding from one side of the galaxy to the other.
---
Has the deal with Pearl Abyss gone through? 
---
This is exactly what BDO players were trying to warn EVE players about when we heard.
---
There wouldn‚Äôt be any fun without people to fight.
---
ITT: people not understanding that posting this here, specifically, is the subtle punchline.
---
Good post though tbh, pretty accurate
---
I was told there is a great fight to be had, activated a 50 AU warp and right after that the recons landed and my mates warped.
---
Oh goodie, B0T is relevant again! I‚Äôll set out the silverware!
---
Your missing the point....which is that having NPC operate and occupy space leads to these events. Like the article talks about  ‚ÄúI can imagine a not too distant future EVE in which situations like this one are created deliberately and in a controlled manner in order to draw players into a more active style of PvE play.‚Äù
---
Tucking tail and running away is technically a valid adaption, I'll give you that. Didn't they used to be nomadic anyway, back when you have passive moon goo income?
---
haha fair game :)
---
iam not raging or upset... but i have to admit my post read's like that. No worries iam fine :)
---
Firstly you only hear one side of th story and its heavily biased.
---
Here is what i found out,  from a lowsec dweller trash lord perspective a few years back, that swore he would never every fly capitals or be part of a big group:
---
* its fun, god dammit they have all sorts of groups
---
* they are organised and they make my life easy
---
* its fun
---
* you say structure bashing sucks but man its fun in large groups, you see it as your duty to the alliance that helps you
---
* they are generally helpful and you actually learn some new things (i fly caps now:P)
---
* i don't want to be *super solo elite* anymore, kinda like to build things.
---
* i don't want to sleep in a ditch in a small group anymore.
---
* there are so many challenges in a larger alliance
---
CCP will make enough money from this small pack to confirm that players are comfortable with buying SP directly. From there, there will be nothing stopping them from taking those sales metrics and using them to justify larger SP packages in the more expensive packs.
---
!RemindMe 1 year
---
Daily alpha injectors are different though, they stated that they wanted to do them as 24h training boosters but mechanically it just sucked a lot less to do them as a lump sum and set a cooldown.  There is a more or less functional equivalency between training 50k extra SP in a day (omega speed) and lumping on a 50k chunk at the end of a session, limited to once per day.  It is just a less efficient way to buy a 1 day training subscription, with isk or dollars.
---
This is very not that.
---
Is being told lies a fetish?
---
Good news.  Now you can spend the next 8-10 months replacing what was burned during you all-bros beach party.
---
Thanks I'm doing some research in it rn.
---
Ah yes, the classic.

Honestly I think the 1 per account rule makes this not that much different from the referral bonus. It's not like people can queue these up and get a character to 100 mil sp.
---
It all that panfam has left
---
I'm honestly curious as to how many man hours were spent destroying that. Probably a very hard thing to figure out but you could rough it with fleet numbers. So what's the hrs/isk destroyed?
---
i hope we dont replace stuff... i personaly like the nomadic way of life. But sure i will when the mighty goons will let us rebuild.
---
Which is some p2w BS
---
That's a fair point. I guess they wanted to compensate us somehow for the clusterfuck that was the new chat system. Idk how else they could do that, but you make a fair point.
---
bait
---
Heavy stealth bombers (destroyer hull) with focused heavy damage bombs.
---
Burst wise it will be the c5/6 ratting. Steady is super carrier ratting. Best depends on time you have.

This sub has definitely devolved into a circle jerk who's only objective is to literally bitch about *anything* CCP does for you guys.
---
Hey man, your loss. I'll be having my 1mil SP and eating it too.
---
Remember years ago when you people would BEG for more SP?
---
This subs only saving grace is the friendship friday thread and that you guys, on occasion, will praise positive QOL changes.
---
I'm sure most people would prefer to only PvE when they chose to.
---
Only a minor loss, PanFam will still fight
---
HAHAHAHAHA. wow
---
It's called Progress... in the beginning Battleships were also rare. Can't blame an alliance for being very well organised and supportive for line members to build an empire and war arsenal.

So.... Golden ammo when?

So anything fitting related is considered exclusively from the perspective of blob shitfits?

The face that i would rather waste 30 minutes running c3 sites than roam for 3 hours to catch a ratting VNI speaks volumes about the current state of the game :P
---
u/Fuzzmiester you seem to be the only csm member that was active when ccp said that all sp on the market will come from someone training them and are still active today when ccp is straight up selling sp for cash.
---
Any thoughts on the matter? maybe some nonnda insight?

You forgot to sign your post

Anything related to fitting from *his* perspective, probably.

&gt;Reddit and the Forums is always full of people very ready to pick a bone with CCP Fozzie, but he was extremely friendly and courteous. I know there was a particular time I had hit the ‚Äú10-20 drink‚Äù wall and may have been loud talking at Lee‚Äôs Palace dangerously close to that personal space bubble and he was good natured about it. The next day I posed a question and was sure to thank them all for tolerating the group of nerds that got a little toasty and loud. Despite the bones people have to pick, I particularly liked the fact that the answers he gave were thought out and he explained the line of thinking or experiences that led to the answers.  
---
+1. Fozzie is a remarkably chill dude irl. Falcon was too (FYI I'm still super proud of my "dumbest EVEmail in 16 years").
---
&gt;One small item to poke fun at‚Ä¶ we still need to work on reminding people that daily bathing and deodorant isn‚Äôt optional!

Didnt sense that much of an issue on that front - there were a handful of flagrant offenders, but most people were A-ok :)
---
&gt;P.S. ‚Äì Promise not to let those friendly bonds ruin the shitposting.
---
Fuck you INIT-man, you're not my mommy, you can't tell me what to do üò§
---
Not really. You don't need space to make money. Divesting yourself from that paradigm would everyone a world of good.
---
Op success, I'm confused
---
I'm going to put mine towards a carrier and a fax and then in 5 months I'll be able to buy the carrier and fax dlc too
---
Oh no, Test small fleets.
---
The bane of everyone's existence.
---
Yea, it was only like 3 or 4 total fellas that needed a little extra space.
---
Because players have been demanding for years that CCP nerf them as its really good income compared to other highsec activities? I mean.. they could've lowered the payouts instead, but that would've made sense lol
---
Yeah, it went through months ago. Its what caused all the "log in for rewards" events.
---
or,you know, don't lose a fight untill you meet an almost 800dps spewing coercer
---
Why do people keep saying this?
---
Pay to win doesn't mean "if you pay, you win automatically versus anyone else."
---
It means "if you pay, you have an advantage over people who didn't pay." That means two people in the same ship with the same personal skill, the playing player will be more likely to win.
---
Most p2w games don't have outright "you win" features. But you pay and get "+10% damage" or "Chance to cast lightning storm." There is a reason esports either don't allow these items or disable/enable all of them by default during competitive play. Because even a 5% advantage is pay to win.
---
iam honest... just watched his pos history and cant figure it out. Seems more like false flag to me...
---
Awww bud no worries come to delve and I have a shoulder and tissue for you. 
---
NCDOCK oh wait there is no where left to even do that.
---
The $5 pack at the bottom includes 1 million SP.
---
I still want to know where this fort was.
---
It's ok to make new friends.
---
Ah yes, the famed TEST small fleets.
---
I'm ok with that.
---
Imagine have half of the map in rent full of bots that do nothing.
---
Maybe? I just checked T1 weapon systems on a recent-ish alt.
---
Been to two different meetups on multiple occasions. Cannot recommend it enough. I probably see some of my EVE buds more than I do RL friends at this point. Have more fun with them too. 
---
It‚Äôs especially cool when you get to meet people you‚Äôve been shooting at. You somehow have an instant conversation with someone whom you‚Äôve only been violent toward. It‚Äôs weird common ground but it‚Äôs great and it works.
---
Since the mineral supply is now more spread then ever before, there is less reason to buy in mass at hubs since most minerals can be procured locally with .5 moon mining. Add manufacture index, and it becomes worthwhile to build in your own citadel. The stuff you cant get generally wont fill a freighter and a jf or orca can haul it faster and safer.
---
Listen, I'm probably going to have the unpopular opinion here, but I don't want eve to die.  If they think this is what's needed to keep it going, then fine by me.  It will hardly break anything and as a vet if I can get it too it is fair game.  Things change bois.
---
A navy slicer will get similiar as well...range sucks
---
Sorry for the mistake my friends...thanks for the correction! I¬¥m not a native english speaker, so all help is appreciated!
---
I can't argue against any of the points you made. I think a way to quickly deplete some of the stockpile of stuff laying around would be a good thing.
---
Is there any way for me, an alpha clone player, to make money off of planetary production?
---
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that we were required to notify you about every roam we do.

Sure. I'll play
---
1 plex is 4.1 mil isk
---
&gt;https://evemarketer.com/types/44992
---
110 plex is 4.99$
---
&gt;https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/
---
1 skill small skill injector is 210 mil
---
&gt;https://evemarketer.com/types/45635
---
(I'll leave the mil isk out)
---
    4.1*110= 441
---
    441/210 = 2 (with a remainder of 21/210 which is 10%. Huh)
---
Looking at the 20 averages, plex has basically not moved in the last month, skill injectors have gone up 10%. Applying that same growth to the next month they will cost all our 441 mil iskies.
---
&gt;under the current system, how much SP can you buy for $20? And how much SP will you be able to buy for $20 in one month?
---
So. "2" and "2" (skill injectors, since SP vary with how many you already have).
---
&gt;Are the answers to those two questions necessarily the same? 
---
Yes they are.
---
Since you can convert the isk you make by selling skill injectors directly into sub time for your farm characters, all you need is a little margin to skim off the top and you're golden.
---
There is a given isk/hour that you can earn mining, ratting and extracting skillpoints. The only variance is due to people biomassing and quitting and SP farmers adjusting how many characters they farm with. Or adjusting their margins.
---
In fact, if you look at the 1 year price history of both plex and skill injectors you will see that they roughly match in their inclination.
---
They correlate. If that's causation or just correlation I'll leave for you to decide.
---
Figure out what?
---
Not true. Drone platforms and auto-aggression make AFK farming possible. Adding webs means no one could even \*try\* using a sig tanked HAC to run anoms.
---
You're right, scrams won't fix AFK ratting, having small sig tanked NPC frigates that require ammo/drone switches will break AFK ratting. 
---
Adding scrams to those frigates targets botters (who can't run from hunters if they're effectively scrammed the entire duration of the anom)
---
That's some mighty fine kool-aid you got

Wait, when did this happen? I must've missed it, but it sounds hilarious.
---
Eve has been p2w since PLEX were put on the market, and has worked out fine.  People are buying ships way above their means but aren't winning so whatever.  CCPls do more stuff like this.  More overconfident nooblet kills for me.
---
Only 1.2 euro (-75%) on steam
---
I remember when NC didn't even fight to save their sov that one time and they lost over 4 trillion worth of infrastructure.
---
What is the duration on that cerebral accelerator? O.o
---
1 week?
---
Its how i feel.

 You don't get to tell me how i feel, only the state does.
---
Can‚Äôt exactly roll this back easily now that people have paid real cash for this item. 
---
This could completely kill FW frigate pvp, no?
---
Oh you don't need to, we have blue alts.
---
And mittens, right
---
Hahahaahh lack of arguments make you start going under the low level dialog :D Those pubies have no need to rent anything in Delve...probably u have your geography wrong. Delve is South i¬¥m sure u¬¥re speaking about what the North was since a couple of weeks ago...Cause well we made eve **great again** killing those botters ruining your precious isk value,  no need to say thanks you goons for the service provided!  On our side please come to delve and farm many VNIS u can find, you doing a great service to all! "Ops no more Vnis after the last update" damn... Don¬¥t create assumptions of what is my gameplay :D I never undock! Ops i forgot im not NC\\PL im a retard goon that undocks!!! Damn :D :D  Love this comments! Full of salt :D
---
Implying we‚Äôd need to try this hard to denigrate you idiots lmao.
---
its a post about a 430 dps comet
---
&gt; you can only use it on chars under 35 days old, who will have shit skills
---
reddit truly never fails to amaze me
---
Wrong.....there's always people to fight. Stop blueing up people
---
False flag would be a Goon pretending to be not a Goon while attacking Goons.
---
See you in a few days.
---
"The community decided" is almost the definition of a subjective standard. That doesn't mean it's a bad standard. It does mean that when thinking about whether to support balance changes around it, I'd like us to think about why we set that particular standard in the first place. You've done a bit of this already by noting that the magic 14 are the skills that affect all ships.
---
I like trade-offs in the SP system. I like that I can choose to train skills with a wide variety of impact breadths vs depths. The magic 14 are impactful enough that I'd rather train them than most skills, but I think the proper comparison is one of them against my first T1 cruiser skill or even my first T1 destroyer, and there's a lot to be said for getting to sit in that Thorax and fire its guns, even if I can't optimize my fit yet. This seems like a healthy trade-off to me.
---
Yeah, I believe the Jita-Amarr pipe is still somewhat active with those two being the primary trade hubs. I was more or less curious if the diminished trade activity reported in the smaller trade hubs was leading to less traffic through the Uedama pipe. 
---
Less traffic = Less Ganking
---
i know its hard for you people to understand, but ships are used for more than running sites
---
Just be aware that there is a (very small) chance that it is a wandering with the same type
---
Don't tell Vily - he wants even less than that!
---
Well, I didnt take in account resist and I admit I might have messed up the math, but I tried to get most of my calculations done without calculating resist and if the engagement was just volleying the ship, which doesn't take in account pilot or fitting decisions. BTW, tanking/doing a nuclear bombs worth of damage is extremely impressive, as one of those nukes was more explosives than was used in the entirety of WW2, including artillery, bombs, grenades, and bullets. Calculating the resist and damage app would be insanely challenging for me as I am a high school student with only a algebra 2 understanding, and I fucking suck at math, but if someone else wants to try I would be happy to read it. Thanks for the input.
---
I¬¥m sure it will happen again, Eve is always changing and eventually everyone falls under their own weight...But having loads of fun until that dosn ÃÅt happen!
---
Of course!  This is why I added the disclaimer at the end :-)
---
Welcome to EVE/Real life
---
Even I have a CODE alt, now that's saying something.
---
On top of that, can't this only be bought once per account?
---
Currently, with the refer-a-friend, you get 750k SP free, non-player generated SP. It's been like this since they changed the recruit-a-friend program a while back. This isn't anything new.
---
From what I've read the bots can be programmed for target priority.  
---
Should you be able to solo sig tank the strongest anoms in the game in a cruiser?  Even a hac  Cuz that's what your advocating.
---
&gt;The fact that the opponent does almost the same - is just them repeating what goons did.
---
Actually, no one was crowing about how we were actually winning.  We literally said "Welp we lost Dek."  
---
This one is different because of all the excuses about how it doesn't count because they're not fighting back/already replaced
---
ewwww, you actually do the plexes.
---
Not true. It's based on attributes of the skill.
---
OH GOD doing this on a polarized coercer would break 1k and 2200 alpha
---
Who alarm clocks? tons are right in my time zone.
---
Unsubscribing is not the same thing as quitting, so yes quite likely.
---
...you really don't know how to fight kiters at all, and just blame the players that play more than just f1 pushing brawl comps?
---
Ditto. 
---
Buying 12 of these on my accounts as we speak.
---
Golden pod implants were cosmetic, no?
---
its a new bean one, no use to anyone over 35 days old
---
No worries lol. RIP the guy in the epithal that didn't get away.
---
Which ansiblex should we bubblefuck if we want a fight?
---
Imagine caring more about keeping the game ~pure~ and el33t than keeping the lights of its development on.
---
Not that this is happening but counterpoint: They could be buying the SP off the market using RMT / Botter confiscated ISK and then packaging them in the deal.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
I know it's hard for you smoothed brain fucks to realize but a 20% increase in damage for a month would not even be a tenth of the reason to inject a dread pilot into a wormhole.
---
I keep on seeing posts like this and even though it's a bait post, it probably does ring true with a lot of players outside of the Imperium. While there are a lot of issues with CCP's lack of involvement in curbing the bots and titan proliferation, the coalition wide goal remains the same over the years, to be the top of the food chain.
---
Sure the Imperium could have played the same game PL &amp; NC. played and not evolved with the game and its mechanics, but then it would have been just another dying alliance tumbling down the food chain while any other alliance that took advantage of the changes would ascended to the top spot. In fact, we briefly saw this happen in the Casino War/WWB, the equivalent of what the Imperium force is now was basically what the Money Badger Coalition was back in World War Bee. Back then every capsuleer that ever heard of goons and wanted to get in on the "goon defeat" was circle jerking in-game and on reddit. Oh I remember those days for sure.
---
But now that the Imperium is doing exactly what the MBC did not too long ago, the opposition is proclaiming again that goons are ruining the game, that there are too many titans, that eve is dead, so on and so forth. Point is, there were problems then and "every challenge is and opportunity to succeed", and I can tell you with confidence that the Chinese army is coming for everyone, if you think the goons are the baddies, wait 'till next year.
---
P.S. I fully expect to be downvoted to oblivion for not siding with the anti-goon bros.
---
pyrolancea 4 included?
---
It's only unfair if everyone doesn't have access
---
This "pay to win" can suck my dual web point tech 1 frigate.
---
The Mittani for you :P Emperor The Mittani.
---
ps the  glass is plastic but its really cool:P
---
First up, they're not quite `straight up selling sp for cash`. There's a limit of one per character. It's not portable.
---
If this had been introduced back when the injectors were first mentioned, this would have been a significant mistake.
---
Now that we've got people running skill farms, and generally acting as middlemen for RL money to SP, it's far less of a concern. Especially with those skill farms also having other effects (afk camping, etc)
---
I'm still not entirely comfortable with the concept, but it's one I've been thinking about for a fair time.
---
This is true, but thats pretty much all we have been given, so if a official CCP dude says otherwise, its all we got lol
---
ok
---
I am REALLY curious just how far we could push this and what all we can volley with polarized conflag. Frigs for sure. I'm pretty sure we can two cycle a lot of destroyers.
---
YES!!! can you imagine an injected juiced up polarized bomber fleet?
---
not every1 is so tard to mine with 4 rorquals etc
---
When most of the new players leave on the second day, slow skill progress isnt the culprit..
---
This deserves a #ccpls
---
Imagine the tears of bot ratters/operators when the NPC's start hotdropping them
---
"Oh remember that one time where we won a battle but lost the war"
---
i mean.. people were bitching and complaining about missing out on their 1 mil SP during the log in events. i guess this is one way of reconciling.
---
Is it your mom?
---
It doesn't pay to keep the lights on if nobody is playing.
---
on the nose
---
Okay now it's DEFINITELY more than they've welped in baltecs. :P
---
unless they're thrashers and alpha you first because they also have the accelerator
---
You don't NEED space to make money but as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, people tend to go for the easiest way. I can't say there's a faster isk printer than running havens in a fully upgraded system for hours. At least, not in terms of active income.
---
Passive income, PI, reactions, industry don't so much rely on that but fewer people are interested in all that.

Eve London is on my list :)
---
fucking lold at the markeedragon part. so true
---
Botters gonna bot.
---
Alpha Injectors are essentially a 1 day Omega sub's worth of SP, which is why they didn't cause much of an uproar.
---
Based on the other comments in this post, the Starter Pack SP is redeemable SP like from the login bonus event. The Cerebral Booster can only be used by characters under 35 days old.
---
it feels wrong, on many levels to see that many titans, game breaking 
---
there should be titan killing defences, XXXL titan guns to destroy titans with ease if there online, simple really, something like pos gunning a inferior force should have a fighting chance against 2000 titans
---
make me a mammoth!!
---
You are a part of goons and you say that other people are ruining the game?? Goons are terorising every single person is high sec that they can, killing every single miner that is not a skiff or an orca. And every single freighter that they see. So think again which aliance is bad for the game.
---
I kind of want to do this with a Nergal...

DOWN WITH THE CYNO MENACE
---
In one of the books, dont remember which one (the one with the capsuleer soldiers from Dust514) They flyover a crater from a doomsday, it was big, but wasnt planet slaying since there was a planet for the crater to be on. Only the Ipetan titans could nuke planets.
---
What wormhole people pray tell? 
---
You do realize how these bonuses are applied don't you? Figure it out so when you go in front of CCP to suggest they rework their entire dmg algorithms and they look at you funny, you'll know why.
---
Should a frigate be able to get under the guns of a battleship and hold it down until their friends arrive? Sig tanking is a core mechanic of EVE, and arbitrarily saying 'that isn't allowed in anomalies' makes the sandbox smaller for no good reason.
---
And AFK VNIs don't run Sanctums (10/10), or Ring Havens (9/10). 
---
They most commonly run Forsaken Hubs (8/10) and sometimes Rock/Stargate Havens; they run these anoms because they have very simple triggers (last enemy in a wave) which works very well for an AFK player relying on auto-aggression to keep the site going.
---
Anyone here buy the pack and not get any SP?
---
Thinking whilst showering is not your strong suit, jacking off may be better.
---
And that's why people are already incredibly risk averse now. Just assume that every new char is a max skill injected veteran and new players don't get any fights which are actually fair for them.
---
Shooting structures is actually fairly therapeutic for me, me and a bunch of others actually enjoy it.
---
There are poco-bashers any time everywhere. Doesn't mean they are actually fighting or winning anything. Like miners - just shooting at things that don't shoot back, for hours.
---
66m sp
---
Man you are dumb
---
Aye, and how many ships are getting killed in delve now? Nothing new. Only roles are reversed. Once again.
---
485 dps*
---
That's the beauty of eve, some people like to drop titans on ratters, some people like to shoot pocos. As long as its fun, its all good.
---
Boredom is more temporary than friendship, even friendship on the internet.
---
While this is a funny take, it's also true.
---
People argue that the SP you can buy now are not "game generated". Well maybe, yes, but a lot of SP that *is* game generated gets taken out of the game by CCP or people biomassing characters. So it's a weak argument imho. There is no pure mass of SP that is redistributed all the time. With SP, out of game factors play a big part.
---
It makes no sense to be able to add an "EVE Online Starter Pack" to a 15+ year old account. This is going to be similar to when the Galaxy Pack goes on discount; it's difficult to justify *not* buying it.
---
Oh, but I do remember propaganda speeches on how every step of teh way will be defended by inty fleets, and that "they'll never get rid of us all" and all that. And what actually followed is what you say: "welp we lost". What is different is that the current underdogs don't pretend to be stronger than they are.
---
You know, I'm not a game designer or anything but there have to be a dozen changes to the game that would allow new players to "catch up" or lessen the gap between established players and new entrants that \*doesn't\* involve selling SP for cash. 
---
Milking newbros like this isn't going to make them stay. It will likely turn off more than it keeps when you ask them to pay real cash for in game progress, and instead will be abused by established players to increase the skill gap (who are coincidentally the real target market for promotions like this given they didn't limit this to new accounts). 
---
CCP, if you want new players to stay fix your game and make it more interesting for new players instead of making it look like another trashy P2W browser game dangling faster advancement for money. Or at least get good and come up with some monetization scheme that doesn't advantage established players over the tentative newbro.
---
I dont know, are they?
---
&gt; plex has basically not moved in the last month, skill injectors have gone up 10%. 
---
The value of SP in the current system is not fixed, you're saying this yourself. How much SP you get for X amount of real-world money fluctuates based on the in-game economy.
---
I don't know how else to explain that this is different to buying a flat amount of SP for a flat amount of money. In your own flawed example where you extrapolate growth linearly, you'd not be able to buy 2 small injectors with $5 in the third month, while you did in the first and second (nevermind that in your own example you had isk left over in the first month but not the second), this is the whole point.
---
Even if the deployment ends, do you think goons will leave a super fleet in the north? or will they bring them all back?
---
that post history is a big yikes
---
well, nice lil help for capital ships V, why not, every tom dick and harry has a titan now.
---
Considering that CO2 leaked a list of all the supers in build to MBC, i'm pretty sure they have a pretty good idea on the number. And there were quite a few.
---
The problem is that the game was built on the idea of exclusivity, which is inherently bad for pulling in business.
---
CCP built a game where the whole purpose is to be *better* than the new player peasants, and now they're realizing nobody wants to sign up to be a peasant.
---
imagine caring about other people "remembering" you structure bash lmao
---
You‚Äôre my hero :)
---
SP always appear out of thin air. For everyone. And guess what, they disappear into thin air too when you biomass or when CCP bans someone.
---
Goons don‚Äôt want to ruin the game, they want to ruin your game. Now they can deal with the fallout.
---
Aaaaaaaaahhhh
---
And this is why I should sort by new
---
At this point, the only reason I haven't botted is because I don't want to put sketchy software on my computer.  There's almost no incentive not to, except whatever personal reasons you might have.  But honestly, what are the odds that a VNI bot running while I'm at work (so not even 23/7) is going to catch their attention and get me caught?  (And yes I heard about the VNI "nerf").
---

Wait are you really talking about 2010? We were fighting a two-front war in Querious and ZXB for weeks, and held off the southern incursion in 49- for at least 3-4 weeks before we sovbilled ourselves out of existence. And there was no coming back from that with dominion sov.
---
nothing about the ram Jaguar ? totally overpowered ship imo (speed/tank)
---
986 dps, 1400 alpha overheated polarized Coercer, 3 heatsinks, burst aerator t2, 5% laser implant, 20% damage accelerator, and pyro 4.
---
2764 dps in C6 wolf rayet.
---
Polarized confessor with all the same shit: 1152 dps and 3150 in C6 WR.
---
Though this assumes 5s in the laser spec and damage support skills which i think is realize is unrealistic to inject for something like this, 4s would be more realistic.
---
I purchased this to see how it applied. I received the same items.
---
Where is the "Damage Booster"?
---
Great for you, but just like mining there is nothing to take pride on for that
---
yea, you don't want to pull em out on accident
---
True. All we can blame goons for is utilizing their horrible strategy to bore their enemies to death. Fixing the current economic and military state of Eve/0.0 is entirely up to CCP, that's of course if they want to do anything.
---

Still thinking about Vegas, would love to go but not sure if itll fit in with other trips this year. We'll see
---
&gt;How much SP you get for X amount of real-world money fluctuates based on the in-game economy.
---
Yes but it's within an acceptable variance. If I can buy +- 10% of two small skill injectors for 5$ that's still low enough
---
&gt; you'd not be able to buy 2 small injectors with $5 in the third month, while you did in the first and second (nevermind that in your own example you had isk left over in the first month but not the second), this is the whole point.
---
No. The thing you're not getting, "the whole point", and the point where eve's market economy is actually working, is that now that SP/plex has gone UP, more people will do it and the price will balance out.
---
Just like it has. For 12 months.
---
------------
---
I don't need to convince you. Eve is pay to win. It is $ -&gt; SP or how ever big a ship you want. That's fine by me, I'm just not going to play, but don't deny it.
---
Not if that battleship has scram web and grapple.  That should be the end of said frigate.  If he's not in scram range you just align out and mjd away.
---
When I vni ratted I could run sanctums, both cloud and rock havens, forsaken rally points.  That's about as far down as I'd go.  Sanctums were slow because the drones had to travel quite a bit but no problem to run.  
---
The ishtar can still do that and that's why I think it'll be nerfed next.  Instead of just stopping it outright with a stasis tower, mwd webbing frigs, or drone killing ai.
---
I think Amarr as a market is starting to deteriorate, I have certainly noticed  quite often high prices on quite a few lower volume modules and the variation between Jita and Amarr is getting wider and more volatile.   I am beginning to question the validity of the Amarr market.
---
Les people are playing and of course people like me have given up using freighters completely through the main pipes or hauled low value loads.    I think the Plex prices also impacted the gankers too as they had to grind more kills and with less potential targets they switched to JF's in and around Jita.    Australian Excellence has already largely given up.
---
I would not worry to much about this because after a while groups of people will start doing it again when people start using freighters stupidly again. 
---
But the reduction in the player base is definitely having an impact.

Youre on to something. If we get rid of tidi, the battles will change tremendously!
---
It will go back to being player vs black screen!
---
Just play the new Meta. When war is announced, skill inject your titan pilot and activate booster. Now your titan does 20% more damage. It only takes 56 skill injectors for a capable titan pilot that does 20% more damage than an older titan pilot.
---
Once your 35 days is up, just extract the SP and rinse and repeat.
---
Goons have been doing this for years, I dont understand why you all are so shocked at this. The accelerator literally didnt change at all, it's always been that way.
---
Yeah, did that thinking that I swore I saw something that said the au-79's were exempt from that. And that the warning as I did it was legacy code.
---
Fortunately a quick ticket with support later and I had it back.
---
nah I don't think lootboxes will be coming. Countries have started taking measures. Belgium banned lootboxes. Europe gonna follow soon enough. USA is auditioning key actors... its a matter of time

It was nice to meet all you guys too, even if Lazerhawks were being mean to me for sitting 10km off a B247.

Just don't engage any characters under 50 days old. How long does the booster last.

as usual you're living a fantasy where you're relevant in any way outside of goons

This has literally been the same mechanic for like 8 years now. This item isnt new. They just made more of them.
---

---
Too many resources in game as is, noooo.
---
I really dont like alot of these they mostly buff caps more it seems and they really dont need that,  If anything they need the opposite.  :/
---
fair.
---
You kind of did it for me.
---
Lol. Was that you eating the salad during that conversation? Definitely eating too healthy to be full time nerd.
---
Can only be bought once per account, you still can't extract them until you hit 5.5mil, AND qq more whiners cause this amount can be gotten FOR FREE with an alpha account anyways. This is a pretty unthoughtful post.
---
no no, i know its viable but it snot profitable.
---
right now, you can get about 4 injectors worth of sp's in about a month.
---
At current prices thats about 4b a month.
---
4 extractors runs you about 1.8b isk
---
which is 2.2b left (give or take)
---
If i pay with a CC for omega then yea thats worth it, i cna then add a MCT and get 2.1b isk from my sext char.. but thats it, add anpother mct and get 2.1b.. but no profit.
---
so if i want to pay with plex the current prices for plex are about 2.1b isk.
---
so you get maybe 100m isk a month.  There is barely any profit in this at all.  so on a full account you get 300m isk a month.  which i can see how if i had say 100 accounts this would work, but thats a tight margin.  And thats all you will be doing is skill trading.
---
ITT people yelling while pressing the buy button. I am sorry but its true. Eve 2K19 ppl...
---
Just so I'm understanding this correctly, everyone is okay with someone paying 15e to generate a million SP on a farm character, just having to wait a month for it while doing fuckall with that character otherwise, and extract/inject it to another character afterwards... but not with getting that same million directly? You people really overthink this game too much at times.
---
And no, in the above example there is no "market interaction", since extractors can be bought from the New Eden store, with PLEX that you buy for money.
---
/r/misleadingthumbnails
---
That‚Äôs Test, not us
---
i have two accounts that are just whatever accounts, they are paid with cc so i can get 4b isk profit a month form them.  which is not bad, but thats not using plex.  add MCT or plex and there is barely any profit
---
The few shitters that will unsub *for real* from this will be replaced by whales that spends 100x more money.
---
I remember a story mentioned about how a player couldn't log in because their character was loaded into a missile launcher, or something like that.
---
Because if you cyno in next door, the defense fleet will simply dogpile the gate at range and murder you as you decloak at the end of your jump timer but before you can load the grid and you would be feeding supers and titans with offline hardeners into a super cap meat grinder.
---
CN Shield Power Relays hardly add more than T2 but cost way more. Also not a fan of the Shield Rechargers it's your ship and you paid for it! :)
---
Dont worry about it kid... you are not important
---
Send me a message and TZ. My guys have been looking for some small action.
---
Sorry I don't know a lot about it but I can answer 2 of your questions:
---
They attack people on the gate but leave pods alone
---
The fit varies based on the situation. There's about 5 or 6 "fits" that I use and changes dynamically. 
---
Warp to 0? Heck no.
---
They're not as competent?
---
Think about it, 1v1 an NPC in the same hull and who wins? For the most part they're in the same ship as us, only difference being we're one entity controlling an entire ship mentally. Everyone else has to "communicate" and have "synergy."
---
Don't worry, the new FW elected CSM member will work to solve this problem... oh wait LOL you're fucked
---
It's adding 4k dps of pressure on your fax even if it's only the dreads.
---
66m sp for what, a comet alt? Yikes? My cap toons have about that.
---
keep running away you coward, can't even enter our space without risk averse kitey bullshit haha
---
well to be fair, we call it winning eve when you quit playing and NCPL seem to have taken a break from the game out side of picking fights in provi so maybe they are "winning" eve?
---
I'm sure you could do a lot with one whole Ferox
---
Im agreeing with Merkelchen, wtf is going on.
---
Yeah that's the guy. However, we should encourage him to run his scheme in order to provide us with content.
---
They took it back twice before...once last time they killed some KS and before that when PANFAM stopped them in Fade.
---
It‚Äôs the language of Bro. You may see them at planet fitness wearing sweatbands and cut offs. Also they frequent stores such as Abercrombie and American Eagle - easily identifiable by their extra tight polos and overly distressed jeans.
---
It doesn't hit DDs though, you aren't getting that much out of titan guns with it.
---
You should write a paragraph on other things I didn't say.
---
It was, and it's funny because I'm typing this from my desk in technical operations at a data company. I'm literally a full time nerd.
---
Had a great time, even though Fozzie shot down my pitch of giving the Phantasm 25mbit.. :'(
---
This question is heavily weighted on who you are asking. I mean this in a very honest, non-aggressive manner. As an example, if you were to ask an older person that has worked hard their whole life and accomplished something; they would likely say they have beaten their challenges and want to enjoy what they have accomplished. They have nothing to prove, they won their battles and wish to celebrate. Similarly, some bigger groups have people that have seen the good and bad times and they find where they are to now be the good times again. A lot of people want to enjoy the good times, especially when they struggled through lots of hard times and bitter defeats.  
---
###Me personally?  
---
I like the culture of where I am. INIT is made up of a large number of small and medium size corporations rather than one ultra corporation with a lot of orbiting groups. This has created a nice mixing pot without losing a lot of different cultural identities.  Also, when you play with people long enough that you generally get along with- you become friends and want to keep playing together. I'm sure I could go on with a laundry list of things I enjoy about INIT, but that's not needed and for people that are already prepared to believe it's all spin or propaganda, no point. So the short of it is that I have a lot of friends where I am and that makes my time in game more fun.
---
This is reminding me of 'pure' Runescape accounts, where you purposefully only level your primary stats so that you can, for example, have a level 25 guy that fights in level 25 zones, has the HP and Def of a level 1, but the Attack skill of a level 70 (all of these numbers are just filler to demonstrate the principle)
---
Like, maybe we will see a financially feasible meta where small gangs are roaming with ~30 day old characters only, and then extracting/injecting and boosting monthly as a 'cost of doing business' kind of thing. Idk how that works out isk-wise but I'm kinda curious whether something like this is CCP's intent.
---
Is the new 4.99 Starter Pack with 1M SP purchasable more than once per account?
---
Tell that to the dead titans.
---
Well, you did mention delivering torpedoes.. so I can believe it.
---
" For the most part they're in the same ship as us " This is simply not true, the reason people keep dying to the diamond NPCs is because they are in fact flying ships with comparable stats to a t2 fittet version of that given ship, normal NPCs on the other hand has a fraction of the dps/ehp/speed etc etc. You can oneshot almost any npc frig that isn't elite with like 1k alpha, most t2 fitted frigates are a good chunk past that with smaller sig etc
---
Then why does it seem test gets shit on more than most others?
---
I wish you guys well and hope you are able to grow grow grow
---
Is this closely related to brosef, spoken by surfer bros? You know them by the ripped shirts, chest bumps and overly aggressive offers to rub sun tan lotion on you?
---
All the ones that died from Doomsday volley? it might be worth it now with fax nerf under some very specific circumstances but it's still a pretty expensive answer given the SP you need for a good titan character.
---
Wouldn't it be a cup then?
---
It does less damage than a T1 Tempest and gains +1 low and slightly better base stats, it is better, but it‚Äôs very much not worth the price over a T1 Tempest...
---
Lmao what a bunch of fucking toads.....!! Ugly mutha's the lot of u !!!

See, the difference is that you're engaging in ludicrous reductionism by equating "couldn't resist strongly enough" with "didn't resist, period." NCdot are, in 2019, not resisting, period.

---
I wish CCP would stop tuning the mechanics to cater to your type. It's the reason the game sucks right now.
---
Actually, rats calling in heavy support (ie. dreads escalating to large numbers of supers/titans) would be a decent way of limiting the amount of PvE activity that can happen in a system/constellation.
---
Premium with RGB LED ofc.
---
Is this line of skins the only ones with that tag? I'm just going to guess that 'premium' skins are more expensive as they have animated parts to them. Such as that Dramiel skin, Angel's Hex, etc.

I‚Äôve been told a few times I look like Chris Pratt now and I still don‚Äôt get it! But you‚Äôre talking about the dude that sounded like absolute ass? That‚Äôd be me!

Your first sentence sums up exactly what is wrong with Eve and why we have declining players even after f2p and the Chinese invasion.
---
Yeah...trigs have a chance to spawn in ships that can warp scram
---
I don't need to imagine, my dude.
---
You want some real cringe? Check out some of the other stuff that guy has posted. It's great.
---
As shit as injectors/extractors are at least they are dependent upon the community to create. The SP was at least earned at some point by someone.
---
This shit is straight pay to win with no redeeming factor.
---
If the description is to be believed (and who even knows at this point) the damage bonus is specifically only for laser, hybrid, and projectile turrets and the rate of fire bonus is specifically for missiles.

Yea, I think I may have said it to you at Lee's Palace at the bar. You know.. when we were screaming over the band. Oye, you need to put on some outback clothes and come do my nieces birthday party and scare off dinosaurs!

I don't think people see the true damage of this.       
---
Because we've already seen people inject day-old Titan characters.         
---
What if someone did 20% more damage or whatever in a *Titan*?
---
High security space miner here, never seen them.  Being a Reddit reader I will assume your providing a lucrative target for a "SIG". If not them then someone would be feeding off you.
---
Solution: Figure out why your a target. Stop being a target.
---
up to 35 days, once your character is 35 days old it stops working.
---
You can click the icon and it gives you a preview of the ship with the skin applied. Judge for yourself.
---
Personally I've found all the new icon tags to be inconsistently applied at best, meaningless most likely.
---
Sure, but were you actually AFK ratting? A sanctum would eat an AFK VNI alive if he popped the triggers in the wrong order. Nothing about sig tanking makes you invincible, it just reduces the incoming dps to the point where your repper can keep up. 
---
For arguments sake, lets say they do implement your solution:
---
Is the stasis tower supposed to be invulnerable? what's to stop me from coming in at 100, sniping the tower with sentries and then AFK orbiting the rest of the site with heavies?
---
Is a new tower going to spawn with each wave?  
---
Or what if I just fit up a facetanking domi and don't care about the webs at all?
---
well, I'm having fun

I would say that was more them being bads. Putting all of the universe inside a fortizar is quite weird.

Damn good to hear you had a good time dude! This was my second event, Vegas 2018 being my first, and the Eve community is incredible. I made the mistake of being very ‚Äúclosed off‚Äù and only hanging out with my group of people at Vegas but Toronto was way different, and I made sure to meet a shit ton of people. We all shoot each other and ‚Äòhate‚Äô each other in game but at these events we‚Äôre a gigantic group of family and friends.

You know what blows my mind? The amount of damn WH people that come out at these events! I swear every other person is a WH‚Äôer!

You must be new here. Also, "instill" not "install"

I feel like we are going to see a lot of your caps on Zkill soon.

You should do yourself a favour and start with your own backyard, starting with 1DQ1-A.

literally no different to the fact that most players that don't bot do nothing.

&gt; people docked up hiding from 8 retris. Didn't bring logi, didn't bring bullshit, just a bunch of point kiting frigs with some links and defensive webs. Only thing that wanted to fight us was arty cynabals, to which we said no thanks.
---
Lmao, the irony is astonishing.
---
It was so loud and.. GREEN. The bright green light was hilarious with everyone dancing on stage. I am in the same boat, Vegas was my first last year and felt the same way about meeting people this trip. The wormholer thing is very true, for both events so far... I bet it secretly means there are a bunch more than we think!  We are making plans for Vegas this year as well. Hoping to see you out there and drag you along for one of our benders!
---
Toxic!
---
story time?
---
Damn that's how you do it. Drop and overwhelming force on those things
---
pretty funny how this all unfolded
---
Maybe *that's* why the industry window runs like shit.
---
This isn't RMT, just another case of certain mechanics of Eve being broken.  It was clearly somebody increasing their buy order, and just hit '4' one to many times.  A good game mechanic would just have seen him purchase the lowest priced one for sell, instead of this ridiculous mechanic.  I guess CCCP thinks having people shoot themselves in the foot contribute to the harsh perception of the game.  It doesn't, it's just dumb.
---
Well that was underwhelming ... y u no undock, NC. ..
---
Hell, it‚Äôs about time
---
Initiative wants opportunities for good fights... try not being blue with 70% of the game. Hope you really enjoy your goku fleets as that is the only content you will ever be offered outside bashes and rorqual saves.

they never lost an empire,  they lost a piece of space.  A piece of space has never been more than an after thought to a proper robust alliance / coalition
---
I can now see why the other guy gave up on talking to you. Stay in your own eve world, where nobody cares about the issues and the game dies in 2008.
---
:o
---
Their recruitment threads were abysmal. Thank fuck.
---
Anotha one
---
Bovril curse strikes again
---
&gt; there's also no way to use cash to gain any progress or advantage in-game
---
You literally gain bonuses on your main account by subbing and buying plex on others. Eve has been pay 2 win ever since plex was introduced, you just need to be a little creative with it.
---
It is essentially new accounts only, one time use per account.
---
I don't think this guy is aRfuss. He is pretty lulzy, though.
---
Wanna mail me a copy of that petition ingame ??
---
Imagine being in such a content-starved coalition that you have to keep count of the number of undefended structures you grind down for morale... yikes dawg
---
I am on the fence with SP purchasing. It is something I'd rather not have, but I do see that it could bring a lot more engagement into the game in some ways.
---
Steam starter pack is only 250,000 sp not 1,000,000
---
Also you can buy both.
---
yeah and they should make super-rorquals to make them easier to mine
---
Maybe he is looking for new players in space?
---
INIT could you be anymore boring these days.
---
Why are you such a large asshole?

turns out open recruiting off the eve-o forums doesn't provide the most quality threads...

FUCK BOS

FUCK SAUSAGE
---
:dagger:
---
Thanks for ruining the game with your RMT empire and forced PVE playstyle you disgusting fucks.
---

---
Imagine actually wanting to *join* TAPI... yikes dawg
---
But you can use it on an account and then extract the skills so eh, that's a really small mitigation.
---
Oh no not another look at me i'm l337 because we bashed some abandoned structures thread.
---
It must suck to be isk negative overall despite having supercap supremacy and outnumbering the enemy 4 to 1 with all your pets.
---
Enjoy burning all that fuel getting home, shall we add that to the butchers bill as well?
---
Honestly, Eve **is** dying.
---
I base this on being recently told by two friends that they are leaving.    These are dedicated people that have held multiple accounts since 2003, and now see no reason to stick around.
---
From a industrialist point of view, I can tell you that it is saturated with titans, and supers are an even tougher sell.  About the only thing that seems to be moving lately are structures (thanks Goons, I guess).
---
Stuka! Stuka √ºber Goku!
---
You're arguing that there's no difference for the game because there's no difference for the buyer, while the entire problem lies in the difference for the seller which you choose to omit. That's the entire flaw of your argument.
---
this thread title is the best thing goons have done in the northern "war"
---
Is this a copy pasta?
---
Idk, they it could be worse. They could be NC.
---
Its the place for closet goons who wanna go to goons but dont have the balls to go to goons.
---
As much as I love a good grr krab post. You are retarded. Never speak to me or my son again.
---
Simplest fix would be to tie the boost to SP instead of character age. That way it'll also be useful for those of us with alts we never use.
---
Real pvp is all but gone. Null sec slug fests are no fun. Individuals mean next to nothing in the vast scheme. You are just a number shooting what you are told to, you could be replaced by a npc for all its worth. We need mechanics that promote small gang roaming/hunting, we need mechanics that discourage the blocs from coalescing in to one mega region with endless anoms and ore. We need content drivers, not content blockers. We need sub-cap to be useful again, as it is the counter to any sup cap is more caps, that is bad. We need crabbing to come with some risk, right now you only die crabbing if you are a complete moron. Null Sec is too safe, the mechanics that CCP keeps adding allow the mega alliances to make null sec safer than high sec, at the same time most of these mechanics do not benefit smaller groups.
---
So that's who's moving into Tribute....
---
You're taking the quote out of context. I was saying thay there's no way to turn cash into referral or "starter" SP. We can argue about whether or not plex is "pay to win", but that's not what I was talking about.
---
PL in 2019 PepeLaugh
---
Still pretty sad the state of eve is that you need to facilitate free shit to have poeple show up. I sometimes wonder what people actually do with their isk...
---
I stay in GSF and KarmaFleet because I am happy there. Saturday Night Swarm is probably the single biggest reason I haven't won EVE. All the structure bashing is just a happy excuse to hang out, drink, and socialize with good people.
---
Hey NC. now you don‚Äôt have to do your seasonal invasion attempt of Providence to show your prowess, you can just undock and fight whatever small entity tries to live in Tribute now (Sort maybe?)
---
To be honest, a lot of the ganks were the work of goons.  They kind of started the fad.
---
As to what is happening with code, i dont know, but with goons being away on a business trip, maybe that means they have a lot of code alts.
---
Or, you know, eve is kill and all that.
---
Every plex with a ship in it has a Comet. And every Comet I slide into feels like this is probably what's going on. Run from fights or fly a Comet. That's what I found when I spent a weekend derping around FW space after being gone a few years.

Mlem mleam ,, ahhh salt.

---
I think injectors as a concept were one of the major things that have put this game into such a miserable state. I get wanting to help new players catch up, but injectors benefited vets *far* more than any new player.
---
I don't think this particular SP purchasing will ruin anything on its own, but it sets a terrible precedent.
---
imagine actually wanting to *leave* PL to *join* Test
---
You did them a favor
---
Might be ? 
---
Looking other premium tagged skins and following skins were included : storm bears, in rust we trust, eros blossom, police. since angel's hex were not included, Now I guess relatively new, and not pattern colored skins are in these categories ?
---
Or the most quality aplicants.
---
Anchoring frigs are the scram ones iirc.  They seem to be moderately rare though.
---
&gt; Also Alpha injectors were also SP from thin air
---
A little bit, but they're limited to 1 a day so it's kind of like a day of omega. It's pushing the line but there was at least an argument it didn't breach it. There is no argument this time.
---
At this time people playing Eve Online aren't much better than necrophiliacs
---
Bait
---
Wait the Imperium is 70% of the game ?
---
Even if CCP will sell titans on eBay it will be just more titans kills.
---
No one can buy skills and brains
---
This is called power creep. Power creep sucks.
---
It sounds great because "oh they're so hard to make! They'll be rare". That's how titans were. CCP thought there would never be more than 5 at any given time.
---
This would just make the big dogs bigger, and the small guys smaller.
---
TL;DR: no. no. NO. fuck no. no.
---
I should add on to this. I spent plenty of time in smaller groups before joining GSF, and while the people were great, there was never enough people around to actually do anything, or there wouldn't be anyone willing to organize/FC anything (myself included, I'm not ashamed of my F1 monkey status). 
---
Since joining KarmaFleet I have not once had a lack of fleets to go on, or things to do. There's always something going on, and it's my own damn fault if I get bored/don't participate.
---
&gt; Now that we've got people running skill farms, and generally acting as middlemen for RL money to SP, it's far less of a concern
---
So what you're saying is that we were absolutely right to warn that injectors were the thin end of the wedge, and that they've irrevocably ruined the game?
---
zkill doesn't rewrite history like you're trying to.  Fair enough that numbers dwindled before we ran for Delve but we did undock and have some pretty awesome fights.
---
+1 for very successfully impersonating a goonfleet member on reddit.

I find some irony in that it's ISD Cobalt telling people about the mineral issue.
---
all i remeber from the stream was boat yelling "Headshot Threenil" "Headshot Threenil" "Headshot Threenil" "Headshot Threenil" meanwhile i ask in local "no headshot?"
---
Out of curiosity, how much does 1 skill injector cost? Sorry I'm sure this is common info but my flair is relevant
---
I remember that one time when, as of now, over 4.4 trillion isk in losses were sustained by NC and NC alt corps.  I see that as pretty definitive.  Or were you going to retaliate with, "we killed those ratting supers and stuff though".  Our structures still stand.  Our space is uncontested.  NC's attempt at crushing Goons has brutally failed and what makes it worse, for you, is that there is so much you could have done to prevent it.  Have fun rebuilding.
---
Eve is not in good shape in terms of player numbers, that is for certain, I have stopped for a while a couple of times.    It really depends on why they are stopping.   I find that after a break I am a bit energized and as an old player you can often get stuck into a rut of not doing anything because you can't be bothered.
---
Yeah, though Panfam are not yet ready to put them back up.      Did you have a look at Amarr recently, if this continues then Jita will be the only real market left.   And the Goon one of course in Delve :P
---
People keep saying it because it's true. Your definition and my definition of p2w are clearly different, and so is theirs. From my perspective, pay to win will literally never be a thing as long as Eve is around because there is never a level playfield in a fight anyways. The entire game revolves around setting it up beforehand so that you will win. Pay to win, as you said, comes from those 10% damage bonuses or whatever, but that is basically never the thing that matters in an eve engagement anyways.

take your bros to wh space. the farm is huge, 1b/h easy in a c5. if you have 30+ active pvpers you'll already be one of the big groups. its good pvp, easy isk, no need for farming supers, no bots, no need to be a pet and blue others

People seem to forget it‚Äôs not CCP but PA that‚Äôs doing this.
---
Everybody panicked when the change occurred then everything went quiet and PA will force this crap down our throats until EVE is truly dead and milked
---
Plus if you‚Äôre in a big null bloc, there‚Äôs plenty of customers right nearby for your products.
---
I still don't see it as a problem. Roach motels were tried. Citadels are meaningless if no one wants to undock from them.

Fish is right &lt;3

I can see panfam going for GOTG now

Boy have i never seen someone spin so hard lmao

so what is the number?  Is it public?  I have never seen anyone with knowledge throw out an actual number beyond a lot.

Not sure how this makes me an asshole other than you having some remarkably thin skin.

why'd u leave Dyson discord :(
---
I mean it essentially is. One time redeem per account. The only worry would be if you could spam it over and over on the same character, which you cannot.
---
Try reading it again.
---
Mining titan that munches stars.  About 5 times the output of a rorq for killing off the game by summer 2022.
---
No, but Imperium + TAPI + both of their pets is close.
---
Well that did at least involve undocking interceptor swarms and other light, fast, cheap doctrines to try and make things harder. And it wasn't totally ineffective either.
---
But in order to kill PL supers/titans you would have to get them to resub and stop playing whatever game they are playing now.
---
There you have it! Golden ammo!
---
hahahaha goons man
---
wrong, everything PL owns is currently subbed so we can run away from goonswarm federation, the apex predator that is currently 'glassing' the north. 
---
and the game we are playing now is "Albion Online". but it was "Division 2" last week, so it's getting hard to keep up.
---
invite me back in
---
yeah, you're only supposed to take pride in not logging in
---
I'm hoping that happens without Goons joining the party.
---
And well, while we are hoping for impossible things, TEST going to war with Goons would also be a cool conflict.
---
Yes, I know there's no logical reason for any of that to happen.
---
&gt;egged on by a number of inactive corp directors looking for a shakeup
---
How many issues in eve could be avoided if people just culled roles from old pruned useless toxic inactive arm chair general bitter-vets?
---
I've opened probably 700 crates, at least 500 superior, and I've never seen PLEX drop. Here's hoping one day, before I get all of my characters to level 500, I'll see it.
---
It's more annoying in principle than in impact, since the existence of skill farms ensured an inexhaustible supply is on market at any time and the PLEX &gt; ISK &gt; SP chain has always been there.
---
A real issue is the fact that the default answer to: "Hi, I'm a newbro - which corp should I join?" is "Horde, Brave, Goons etc.".
---
Once a pilot joins a bloc - they get comfortable, people are creatures of habit/comfort - its hard to pick and leave the first corp you joined especially if on the surface you are having a great time.
---
And that's how a bitter vet is formed years later.
---
Played a head to head campaign with a friend before they re balanced it a bit and there was nothing I could do against the wheels. Its better now but I was scarred for life.

&gt;The same people bitching about a 1M SP pack for a new player for $5 are the same people who bitched incessantly that they didn't get their 1M SP for their $15 subscription because they couldn't defeat the login-once-per-day-and-click-a-button-for-free-shit-boss.
---
wrong
---
Now I'm getting flashbacks of the TF2 unusual hats.
---
Thx, must've been scary and funny at the same time for the software engineers.
---
&gt;Currently, with the refer-a-friend, you get 750k SP free, non-player generated SP. It's been like this since they changed the recruit-a-friend program a while back.
---
the difference is starting a NEW character with redeemable 750k sp, and being able to buy $5 1m sp on an already existing character.
---
Ahh, the classic $5 Gila bot starter pack
---
I don't know, personally. More than 4 at least.

Now that I've got a decent Ed contagion guy it's a lot better. Cyclone was damned fun but Ed is just easy mode.

they'd have to sell shittons of those packs to equal the number of SP lost by banned botters or from eeedjits who lost a frigate full of large injectors.

You know you can come home too, all you gotta do is ask

We actually have a wormhole for PI and such for exactly that reason, but primarily operate for PVP purposes outside it. The thing I like about wormhole groups is they're typically happy to set up a friendly brawl instead of straight up stomping on people.

I've PVP'd in Faction Warfare every year since 2011 (when this was released) and have only ever run into one 'experienced' pilot using the booster. There will probably be a slight bump as the result of this thread and then things will go back to normal.
---
Don't judge, they just want to see UALX one more time before they unsub!
---
yes more strong super big ship is what the game needs
---
they launched this accelerator in 2011 so why hasn't it been abused between 2016 and 2019

Cyclone is for pussies.

Those ships proved their worth last night! 
---
That being said, given how active the corp Fisher belongs to is, the proportional number of people participating and actively creating content seems to keep going up, free shit or not.
---
Hopefully no new players come to this subreddit as all these bitter vets are cancerous as fuck. Everyone saying P2W is forgetting that piloting is still mostly skill based not SP based. Everyone else is just complaining about "muh market" and straw manning.
---
Sure!
---
But the problem is that ANY form of change will eventually benefit those with the experience and the wallet more. That is the nature of EVE and while I believe that there can be balance checks (i.e. extracting to zero needs some drawback), it is unavoidable in the long run. Precedent or not, in the end the problem remains unless CCP does a complete and utter reset of the game.
---
Sweet. I just finished training for the Leshak doctrine. Thanks for the info!
---
do I just apply in game
---
I mean, if you want large-scale nullsec content, you don't join the second biggest mega-coalition in EVE that's strategically blue to the largest mega-coalition in EVE.
---
We light our cigars with burning ISK.
---
Need a light?
---
Your my boy blue
---
Imagine wanting to be blue to 80% of the game
---
That's not going to happen, you can 100% see Goons SIGs and INIT join the timers because what else content is there for them ?
---
We spend it on shit for pewing, then spend all our time pewing and not earning more isk. Why krab, haul mins for manufacturing, or organize PI when we could be out blowing shit up?
---
Like at least half. It's insane how spineless people are about telling their friends "oy you're not playing so you don't need roles" and how even more people get buttmad over roles in games they don't even have installed
---
Cya, one less bittervet to keep the new players away by demonizing CCP over 1M SP to get people playing.
---
Does there have to be a reason?  It is internet spaceships by the way, and fertile shooting grounds in PB by TEST could bring a bored Goon horde lurking.
---
Its less about CCP wanting them to unsub that it is about CCP have absolutely no forsite at all.  They wanted people to focus on the shiny new Triglav content.  So they reduced the number of spawns on the older Sansha content.
---
I would be shocked to discover they spent more than 60 minutes discussing the ramifications of nerfing Sansha incursions to\\n the playerbase at large.  I imagine all the of the points you made would come as a suprise to them if you had been present in the staff meeting where the decision was made.
---
This was a conversation me and Steelroamer had once, apparently there was a guy who kept a fresh toon, a phoenix, an assload of injectors, and this booster in his hole at all times so in case of eviction he had a 40k DPS capital murdering machine. I can only imagine what this looks like on a Vehement.
---
ya, your not wrong in that i don't think thats ideal. i'd like to buff them in certain roles but nerf them in others.
---
ive heard alot about the jag and on the next phase of this will definetly have something for it.
---
Remember Tuxford shutting down TQ when he meant to shutdown his dev environment?
---
Have you seen PL these days? I think there's still a ways to go before rock bottom.
---
The goal is not to profit though, it's to run an account for free. For example, I have an account with a dedicated hauler. I'm not going to train any other skills on him, so I run him as a skill farm. I can keep him omega and it doesn't cost me anything.
---
r/titlegore
---
Only if the requirements to build 1 ship was to use 250 Titans.
---
i also thought about something like that but am just focusing on simple adjustments vs anything else with this
---
I was thinking about logging in somewhere next winter but now I won't &gt;:[
---
Yeah it's RARE. I've gone several hundred with out seeing any. I think I've gotten 5 stacks so far over 3500
---
FC did say Jump.
---
ya might be a way to think about it.
---
Imperium and pets like tapi and gotg gets close to 70%
---
I hate to be the one to point out the obvious, but that is a description of the way the injector mechanic worked. Not a promise of anything in the future. I'm not expressing an opinion on the SP for sale, just that they are very clearly not saying what you're purporting it to say. If they did actually make this promise at some point I would be very curious to see it.
---
you may be right, but i generally feel that there are more ships that are useless than overly useFUL. which would lean me more towards thinking that buffs are the way to go.
---
CCP changed the button and nobody updated `sphere.exe`.
---
That doesn't make sense. It doesn't take balls to go to goons, it takes balls to stay out.
---
Yeah, for all my failings as a leader in DnG I at least made sure that the nerds that had roles were active and contributing (for the most part).  If someone gets triggered over their perception of diminished space importance because they're inactive and you yank their roles, they shouldn't have ever had them in the first place.
---
&gt; Dear CCP, fuck you. You promised to NEVER do this.
---
Where/when? (This is a serious question, I am looking for a source.)
---
Autz timers are aids.
---
Yes you can :)
---
i 100% agree. The rorq burst nerf was just a minor afterthought to me but one that felt like it SHOULD happen. And I can definetly agree the mino is too strong as it is in a self rep role, thoughts on how to balance that without negating its fleet/buffer role where its the weak?
---
Yeah only 3 years to get a titan...
---
Most games today are done in 10-40 hours. And multiplayer games same game repeated every time.
---
3 years seems like a really long time to me.
---
isn't he in snuff?

I want to hear the story. 
---
I was just ratting my little heart out in my favorite system in Esoteria when I seen someone call out a hostile in system. I was like OMGWTF GRAB DRONES ALIGN ALIGN ALIGN. Then I saw that everyone in system was blue. So I try to correct the dude in the intel channel by saying XXXXXname is BLUE. Then I check the character and it is Black Omega/PL and I am like "HMMMMMMMMMMMMM". Then someone from Command comes to our corp discord and pings me directly, after finding out my main via AUTH or something, about leaking info about a poach. Maybe if they didn't want it to leak so easily they shouldn't have had logged/jumped characters into an Eso krab system.
---
Anyways, just my anecdote.
---
http://dredditisrecruiting.com
---
Yep. Tbh the whole TZ tanking should go. There was nothing wrong with the POS bashing type timers. All these reinforce modes also is painful.
---
no cause sharing gm mails is bannable
---
&gt;Player driven economies are key to EVE design and we want you to decide the value of traded skillpoints while we make sure there is one single mechanism that brings new skillpoints in to the system ‚Äì training.
---
Which part of this has changed?
---
Only one per account ever. In the grand scheme of things thats hardly something to worry about if your a vet, and only really matters if your a new player and want to catch up faster.
---
Why?
---
If anyone is curious what power creep looks like and what it can cause, please introduce yourself to the rorqual.
---
Posting history says it almost definitely is.
---
1 mil SP for 5 bucks is insane.
---
There was literally no master plan or attempt to hide it. We even made a good bye post on PL forums and informed leadership.
---
 so somewhere north of 4, could be 5 could be 50 but no one seems to want to nail down a number.  Even back then the MBC couldnt give a number, so imo it is all speculation and worthless to even bring it up.
---
actually they should but give it massive disadvantages. Make it super expensive, For lore make its warp drive give negative effects on a region and let the debuff be exponentially worse the more you have. Make it persistent in the game aka. It cannot dock cannot tether cannot safelog. If the pilot logs out the ship retains the skill + implant bonus but it stays in the game. By doing this you have to consider building how many on an alliance / coalition level. where to stock them. Cannot be in a dead region because you would have no defense.

I shit on miners a lot, so I thought I do something funny for them. Enjoy.

Well, duh, of course not -- they were a tiny alliance and didn't need the attention on their easily-snuffed super fleet.

yes because as we know, all changes are good.

When CCP starts skill extracting all the sp from the toons in doomheim

---
Anyone wanna buy my Rorqual?  
---
Comes with a free Plan B
---
&gt;That's how titans were. CCP thought there would never be more than 5 at any given time.
---
but it's not entirely because CCP misjudged it, they fucking made it soooooooo much more easier to make and build them like 5 times
---
:eyes:
---
lets not act like ncpl havent fought either, which they have. But acting like Goons tactic was wildly different is laughable at best.
---
I a test/suad guy who was talking to an INIT dude for like 20 minutes or so at Matt's place. Was that you?
---
Well I fought some Dreddit dudes.
---
if someone in PL buys ur rorquals before my rorquals im gonna be so mad!!!!
---
We're not saying you shouldn't speak your mind, but don't expect people to automatically agree with everything you say.
---
tbh i don't think it's dumb per say, it's indeed on the lower end of effectivenes/complexity. And it oversells the gang as more dangerous but who cares really. 
---
As in if it's normal for us to use the cheapest possible fit that's barely functional, then yes, except for a few we tend to fly on the cheap end of nano gang so we can welp withouth much care.

Wut are you smoking?

I dont know if the entosing "changes" you proposing have to do with you not able to win or kill Frat Ihubs "only one you got was the one they didnt even put on their board" but when you talk about buffing faxes and lower entosing cycles when you are highly known form dropping faxes on nodes...ya balancing the game? or making changes on your favor....if this is the case then shame on you as a CSM...  
---
Citadel damage cap.....&lt;this is the shit that needs the most change....no timers or cap would force more fights out of them that the stupid lets wait 2 days shit to kill it...a change on this mechanic would be nice, either eliminate the damage cap on them or the cycle timer for armor and hull...its stupid. Also...with this...if a station its at low power no one can tether on them.
---
You're dumb
---

No one abused that because of the extreamly high cost and low reward. Sure it's nice when you already have alts, but only an idiot would use that method purely for the SP.
---
Well, they could have apologized and, I don't know, got the chat server tested and working before launching it? Don't care about the sp, a genuine apology is all I'm still waiting for.

How to never recruit a new corp again 101 right there lmao
---
poor guys couldn't mine. i hope they get they experience they want in the space they're moving to.
---
Man this post was really thought provoking, and then I saw your username.
---
not your corp
---
Pretty sure it was. There were only three INIT dudes. I spent a good bit in the lobby one day talking to 4 or 5 test guys and then again at one of the bars and then the palace.
---
Albion is making a comeback? I remember last year a lot of eve people were talking about it, but the hype sorta died out.

---
pretty damn accurate description of a farmer
---
Honestly there's not much to talk about it was a simple engagement and i believe it's a bit of an oversell on it's complexity. Boils down more to what i personally think it's possible and what he thinks is possible.
---
If there's another vid on the future with more footage and more situations that i can be more specific about i will be able to comment, for now i can't be constructive as it's a "what if" situation only. Maybe a lot of rambling for a 3 step fight, but that's purely personal feeling about the format. 
---
Will need more to talk about to give a proper answer, my apologies.
---
I really like it, great ideas. I hope CCP will implement them soon. Also take a look at Maller please, maybe something can be done with it.

What do you do for money in low sec?  Your members?
---
So the new NC/PL propaganda is that Goons should just abandon the fight, go home, and have lots of sex and beach fun.  Why work so hard after all.  I accomplishes nothing.  We really should rest and enjoy our summer.  
---
Are you going to have your own Tokyo Rose or or Hanoi Hannah to support this propaganda?  Maybe leaflet drops from over the area of operations.  
---
Will our wive/significant others be cheating on us as we blow up structures in the AZ time zone? 
---
Sounds tempting, but most of us are pretty familiar with the amount of sex waiting for us at home, and will just keep on steamrolling over NC/PL structures and infrastructure.  
---
Still...you did actually make me smile while reading Reddit so thanks. :-)

Serious post, Hedliner was genuinely great to BOS for the most part, at least as far as I could tell.

You are actually retarded if you think no one paid real life money for PLEX, and then sold them for injectors.

You don't get it, test is only blue to goons because panfam dropped supers on them in

---
Any skills can be extracted. You just have to have at least 5.5mil to extract, 5 million of which can be trained for free.
---
please dont tell me you mined all of that in a veldnaught?
---
Titans are barely used other than for bashes and the random supercap fight. That doesn't happen often unless you are in Imperium. Any other use would be probably very risky just for a dickswing show.
---
Are you ok?
---
People bitch about the old coffins, but if you really wanted to make titans or supercaps valuable go back to this.
---
God no.
---
Dear god no.
---
Just no.
---
It would, of course, be a Goon who thinks this is a good idea.
---
I'm confused how are you related to my corp/am i related to your corp?
---
I'm very well off in game and I fuckin' pray that the Trigs wipe us all out and make us start from 0 in a new universe. Maybe we can build a new EvE Gate 2 out of salvaged titan jump drives when the Triglavians kill everything.

I live in Toronto and bought an early-bird ticket as soon as I could. Then it turned out pride AND jazzfest were on at the same time. My Eve North experience ended up being 15 mins at the end of Saturday for registration and merch store, then about 2 hrs of the party at Lee's Palace. I was hoping to find some old Canadian corpmates there (I'm playing skill queue online right now because if IRL commitments), but alas I recognized no one, and the bartenders were super douchemode because we all got the free drink things which I guess means no one was tipping. Left early.
---
Ended up having fun at pride and jazzfest with IRL friends on Sunday and not going to the meet at all. 
---
RIP $90. At least I got a couple shirts and some SKINs to show for it. I guess I would also have been left full of regret if I hadn't bought it so whatever.
---
We had a guy jump a wormhole that only existed for him in our home hole. It shot him some 800au away and we had a deep safe post deep safe nerfs.
---
If you know approximately where the insta is you can single shot combat probe that cruiser.  The signature is pretty high before the inertial stabilizers.  You could literally launch your probes and scan while they are in warp.  The only problem is you will not have their landing position the first time but would have to wait until they re-use it, if they reuse it.
---
I can remember that day when a server blade caught fire. Lots of jokes about Thermodynamics and Paste were made that day.
---
I'll go throw some at the problem and report back.
---
I'd imagine our chineese friends on the other server felt something similar when they blued and blobbed to the extent that their enemies simply biomassed.
---
By that stupid fucking logic CCP should let me buy ships directly from them so I can stop lining the pockets of those greedy fucking industrialists
---
yeah that must be it.

yes, they made it f2p and added some cool new mechanics/stuff that is making it seem more appealing to many folks (myself included).

Because the game has been designed in a way that makes it heavily advantageous to do so.

Nah I totally get that and I love doing it too. Was just curious what the story and mental justification would be behind a terrible fit like that.

Thanks for the reply :)

Low effort bait post.
---
god ur retarded
---
This game has been p2w for a long time already.
---
&gt; I'm confused
---
This is your default state of being, to be fair. 
---
... but yes, I'm puzzled too.
---
&gt; The main question is why do you stay in these blocs if it gives you unhappiness?  
---
I'm having fun.
---
so they need a titan killer... like a mobile platform that you drop (like 500k m3 or so) that deploys into a like 10x DD dreadnought weapon platform that can 1 shot titans and is able to apply like 10% of their damage to dreadnoughts ( or whatever numbers make sense for balancing reasons etc) so while you can use them to attack structs or titans, they can be used against dreadnoughts although not as effective. so if a huge titan fleet comes you can counter them by dropping these platforms off, however there would be imposed limits, like deploy distance limits and only 1 per ship allowed deployed. So to be effective you need a grid like approach deployment with equal numbers against the titans. Then its a 1v1 battle of the platforms against the titans. 400 titans would need 400 platforms to counter and eradicate the titans. 
---
So now we would go back to dreadnoughts being the safer choice unless they want to risk bringing their titan and have it killed by platforms. platforms of course would be expensive, say 1.2 bill each, making them kinda  a waste to use against dreadnoughts since they apply not very well.
---

Well you have a valid reason for the mistake then. :) I usually find that non native English speakers are better understood on coms then myself because of my regional accent lol.
---
The mother of all smugposts is in the works.  
---
Just you wait until this war is over.
---
The "bigger things" is already about 100% of the rest of the game though. Not everything needs to be about the big guns.
---
This is always the stated "fear" but the actual cost of doing this for 20% damage is not really worth it.
---
just take away their roles. if they are inactive they won't notice.

wow. This is the internet, you're not allowed to be mean on here. I'll have you know im a level 69 enchanter.

Leme quickly copy edit this for ccp "~~It‚Äôs very important to note here that this means all the skillpoints available to buy on the market in EVE will have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate.~~ Player driven economies ~~are~~ were key to EVE design and we want ~~you~~ to decide the value of traded skillpoints while we make sure there is ~~one single~~ a few mechanism that brings new skillpoints in to the system ‚Äì training, and cash."
---
I'm so aggressive about it that I routinely remove roles from people whom I forgot have just like, gone on vacation or something. Zero tolerance. I don't mind people going afk, I'm just not leaving services/roles turned on when I know you're on walkabout in Croatia or something.
---
I like my major bloc. We have numerous SIGS, so if I wanna wormhole I go wormhole. If I wanna small gang I ping and we go small gang. I go up to low sec and solo pvp. I haven't ever felt like I had to leave to experience eve. I came to my group after I quit for a year cause the game sucked as a new player in high sec. It was this reddit that helped me find my group and since then I actually love this game. Definitely not unhappy.
---
Charmed, I'm sure. 
---
Now what's goin' on here. Did you get *weird* with Suas or something?
---
Thank God I quit this game.
---
Lmao, this. I saw this in intel. Checked the dude and did indeed see a blue PL member. Big oof
---
To the Init pilots who were asking if you had 'won eve': Yes, yes you did. Your trophy is in the mail but sadly you have to share it with the rest of your coalition, so you might not notice it when it arrives.
---
My most amusing moment of noobishness I can remember is early on when I'd learned how to use combat probes to track down abandoned drones in highsec. I had a lot of fun with this, and was making really good isk compared to the other things I'd been doing.
---
After the first time I'd accidentally warped on top of a mining fleet and made them run for the hills, I'd taken a great amount of care making sure there were no structures, ships or anything I could see on the scanner before warping to the drones.
---
So I warp to 0 on the drones I've scanned down, after doing everything I knew how to do to avoid screwing up.
---
As I'm landing, I realize I am entering some kind of abandoned battlefield. There's a tower of some sort, and a bunch of battleships. ... I'm landing next to one.
---
*DING!*
---
And thus did I learn sansha incursion rats sometimes stick around for a while in systems they've been routed from.
---
Oh, and more importantly - that most npcs don't show up on dscan nor combat probes.
---
Damn dude, I wasn't happy about the way the OSS went either but still
---
I never afk ratted, just minimal focus while bullshitting on comms.  I had no trouble with sanctums though.  Only had to make minor adjustments, and/or priority changes.  The only ones I ever had trouble with were forlorn hub or den I cant remember which.  Because it had fast webbing frigates.
---
I‚Äôm cool with that.
---
I think I'll wait for a few more panic nerfs and maybe bring a cyno jammer before I try anything that dumb.
---
Wheres the fun in that?
---
Oh, so you‚Äôre saying you sit on your ass while waiting for someone else to hold your hand to undock? How cute
---
~90B isk for a titan, fits and implants is not "dirt cheap". 
---
It isn't what it used to be but it is still a major investment for most players.

Interdictors, i.e. the Sabre, have a unique module that fires Warp Disrupt Probes, which disable warp drives in an area. Sabres are the favorite interdictor, in part because they are by far the fastest.
---
As a Sabre's duty in battle is to full ham throw themselves at the enemy fleet, dedicated Sabre pilots have developed a reputation for pretty much being Mad Max characters: they go blazing into battle yelling **WITNESS ME** (and immediately draw attention from the entire enemy fleet), and they fuck up someone's day.
---
They also die. A Lot.
---
As such, as a Sabre pilot, it is your FC-given duty to ride yourself unto Valhalla, Shiny and Chrome, their puny ships holding no sway over your will to bubble them.
---
And if you're like a pure Sabre pilot and you really live up to the role play, you get to have the time of your ***life*** doing it.
---

---

You can get rich without ratting or mining. In fact those are probably the worst and most boring ways to go about it. That being said, if you make the decision to not work on "empire building", don't cry when someone who does put in the work comes and steamrolls you. Panfam couldn't cut it. See ya

They‚Äôre finally adding a feature that was promised when citadels were first added something like two years ago?  Guess that‚Äôs where all the development time went.

People stopped giving a fuck about what Remedial thought long ago. Sesfan Qu'Lah is #1.

If CCP added them then they would just proliferate to the point that people will be making the same complaints abut them that they did about regular titans.

GSF does this religiously and ruthlessly. You know how every once in a while, some former direkkktor in GSF will go and make a public stink about how awful we are and how we snubbed them despite all the work they did 25 years ago and how it's supposed to carry them forever? 95% of the time, it's because they suffered an inactivity purge from leadership and it suffered a wrecking hit to the part of their brain that processes feelings of belonging.
