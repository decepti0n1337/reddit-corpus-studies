Yes, I've killed those miners before, and the Arbitrator is just bugged.
---

---
You can't out range them, better pull them off and then warp on top of helpless miners.
---
Or get an alt to pull them, that way you might be able to kill them faster.
---
---
---
Yeah, don't worry about that bounty! Nobody cares enough to hunt you

If your corp is gone, are you looking for a new one yet? As we say: "The best ship is friendship!" www.DredditIsRecruiting.com
---
We are a well known, big, old, Reddit-based space-holding corp. Dreddit founded "TEST Alliance", which (together with our good friends in the Legacy Bloc) own the bottom right corner of the map, around Esoteria. 
---
You can get a mentor to help you get back into the swing of things, if you want. I was AFK for 8 years and my mentor helped me find fights; choose, buy, and fit ships; and answer my dumb questions about stuff like the new (to me) sovereignty mechanic. 
---
Dreddit offers a Ship Replacement Program for basically all of our corp fleets, and TEST has SRP for Alliance-level fleets. We have free ships and skill books for new characters, and lots of training fleets. Between Dreddit and TEST, there are over a dozen Special Interest Groups you can join. They range from mining nerds, small gang PVP badasses, capital ships, to Stealth Bomber predators.
---
You can find your niche in Dreddit, just like I did! Twice!

Check www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for our application process and public Discord link.

Hope to see you in corp chat and Discord! I'm Claytonius3 in both.

Fly safed
---
You could have a bounty of 10 billion and it wouldnt matter.
---
Why?
---
Ah yes remember those old ship icons that looked like slightly differently sized pluses, and /r/eve had a mental breakdown over ccp changing them to their modern icons?
---
Pve stuff and I know that there are factions.
---
Is it worse then Destiny's?
---
No one likes mean comments.
---
I do the same
---
Ok dick I was just asking.
---
ok
---
huh why?
---
I don't know if I've ever had a salty donut.
---
It not part of the narrative.
---
Because they hate the playstyle and think it should be nerfed out of the game and thus their arguments are based on demonizing the playstyle so that everyone hates it as much as they do.
---
Never heard of them. Who the hack are they?
---
Dont push to my face with Tom Dick nd Harry. OK?
---
that costs money and CCP is too busy flushing their cash down the mobile toilet to actually spend it on something meaningful for EVE
---
Thanks for the replies.
---
I would guess if asked that goons or a sig would love nothing more then to shit on nc/pl/ph
---
coming from a person who has clearly never active mined a day in their life this is hysterical.
---
Fuck that, I went for a walk for an hour and my face got sun burn.
---
a war ended, black out happened, that wonderful drifter event happened, this has combined to  lead to peak and regular log in numbers dropping from 2,000-5,000 fewer players online at a time depending on the time of day which means 2000-5000 fewer people interested in buying PLEX. When you actively drive15% of the game's population away from the game the demand for sales of game time is going to fall accordingly.
---
an hour, are you a hero nerd
---
Yeah killed a a 3 day old account that was in a 800M Machariel in a 70M drake
---
&gt;f1 monkey/afk miner!
---
it's like you don't even play the game enough to know how to search zkill
---
Which part was confusing?
---
HACs are fine where they are. Battleships need scan res buff, and faction battleships need to be reworked. Battleships have much more utility than HACs do with MJDs and plenty of utility highs for neuts.
---
Sometimes an unimportant fight can be very important. Sometimes it is just another brick removed from the wall.
---
As far as I know, FRATs economy and war chest is weaker than TESTs. Even though we took massive losses here, we can replace them easier than FRAT. If we had taken equal losses, it would have been better of course. You can imagine that is a gamble the FC team is willing to take. 
---
Also people had fun, which is FAR more important than anything else because this is a video game and that is what we're here for.
---
He’s baiting for standing in staging.
---
KarmaFleet flair explains it all.
---
I'll buy it for 1.2 bil.  I'm a casual player and it's a lot of isk for me, but I really want it.  I'll PM you for the contract details
---
&gt; Oh and didn't your alliance kick people for reporting and killing bots in Legacy space?
---
nope
---
I went out looking for that rumoured gf but only kept finding girls 🤢
---
Speaking of which, we have space open for renting if you are interested.
---
did you find the loot more importantly
---
Seeing as how these tools are based on what is said in a chat channel, yes. They don't require ESI or API to work.
---
There is a relevant Futurama quote for everything in eve.
---
Use Firefox for mobile and install ublock origin extension. It's the only way to fly.
---
becuase that pod or shuttle might provide warpin/intel
---
Roger Roger! Thanks Brothers!
---
Should take new players 3 years to enjoy the game , uphill both ways.
---
Be very wary of blood raider combat sites with a T3C, you will be eaten alive.
---
becoming a criminal is rather easy
---
just ECM burst the Jita 4-4 undock aaaand done
---
So, technically "criminal" is a status, not a job in Eve Online. The best way to make money is defeating ships that give you expensive loot.
---
...But to get there will take you a tremendous amount of time to fly what you need, and have the right strategy to take them down. Plus the right mates to do it with.
---
I would first join a Lowsec or Nullsec PVP-based corporation that is newbie friendly and go from there. Once you learn how to properly blow up ships, you can follow your dream from there. But it'll take time. so blow up 100 frigates and go have fun
---
It sent me to dykes on bikes yesterday. My grandmother was concerned with my choices in life
---
You will need to develop combat skills if you wish to gank or pirate - will take a few days to a week to even get the basic catalyst skills for ganking. Check out corp CODE. as they role play high sec criminals killing people mining.  - Not sure if its profitable though
---
Oh maaan.
---
Just go to minerbumping.com
---
We'll find out in a day or two if my skin starts to flake.
---
yes

Moto E2 on Duckduckgo browser app is working. Lame it is messing up for you folks, crazy good Intel website

Because the idea is that its a corp buyback program and the "tax" we take of the top goes towards corp programs like fueling structures, srp, and providing modules/ships to players in the wh
---
with strict privacy settings firefox blocks 3rd party trackers. Ads use that.
---
Statistically speaking there is a 98% chance you will have quit by the 3rd week.
---
If you make it past that you'll probably be a dropout or something. Jk, it can be fun if you find your niche.
---
Exploration, remember to PI on the side and  if you join a nullsec bloc i can recomend trading in stuff like implants you get from highsec and sell in your alliance space, or combat boosters
---
100k lol
---
Ever tried fentanyl?
---
Infuriated because I invested all my 5mil SP into raven fittings for running lv4 missions in hopes of plexing, then be able to run a Mach and hopefully burners to have plenty of money to fool and only need to worry about missions sporadically.
---
I wanna try this one day. Expected damages?
---
The malware already got their brains.
---
CENTI is recruiting btw.
---
Less so than games that require you to grind to advance. I tried out going back to anarchy online after a 10 year hiatus, and I hated the grinding aspect of it. In Eve is possible to just login for a few minutes, check your skill queue and then log back out. I don't know if any other games even remotely like Eve.
---
Your sec standing wil hit -10.0 faster than you can say "I am a criminal now"
---
no u
---
Aren't you overwhelming the guy a little bit? This feels copy-pasty
---
What are you a 7 year old?
---
Buy a sub. Enjoy the game
---
If you make it past your first week, you will notice that you want to spend more and more time playing until eventually...
---
You family will be wondering where you are as they have not seen you in years
---
That was my favorite game for soooo long! I still miss it, but I agree, to get anywhere it’s a hard grind.
---
I am now going to look for threads on people raging about the icon changes.
---
I'm sorry but those differently sized plusses looks like total cancer.
---
Time to roll and alt and give it a go!
---
That sounds like a ton a work bro
---
I found Eve entirely by accident. I was looking for a game to use my joystick with and looked up "space simulator". I was probably looking for a game like elite dangerous, but this was right around the time that Eve started alpha accounts so I figured I would try it out. I was hooked. It's been downhill ever since.
---
It can be but since there is no 'end game' you have to kind of provide your own goals and when you have reached them- more goals.
---
The game is alright but the people are better- try and make some good friends :)
---
I AM NOT AN NBI
---
We are actually independent fam.
---
I'd settle for "whelmed"! Anyway this is 100% grass-fed organic OC. I write these from scratch whenever I see a potential corpmate.
---
At first you aren't going to do much, but if you fly with more experienced pilots they can carry you, and you can learn from them as time goes on. You can generally get faster content by being in a corp that gets a lot of fights. Joining a factional warfare corp will get you fights quickly. Or join pandemic horde for nullsec pvp. They always have a massive fleet ready to fight everyone that comes there. Spectre Fleet is a public fleet community that meets in highsec, and normally their fleets only last an hour or so.
---
Yeah I’ve been playing Eve for just over a year. But I’m way more into it than I was AO for those 4 years or so that I played it. Eve is great.
---
Retarded :P
---
Goons steamrolled it and rolled out due to drifters fam.  Don't cast shade cause our groups actually did a thing.
---
I keep a locker called Mass Grave filled with corpses. Does this count?
---
There are no good guys in eve in the first place...
---
Kinky.
---
Are you having a stroke as you type fam?
---
Besides, getting criminal status doesn't really do much other than you can't go to highsec without getting chased by NPC police everytime.
---
You obviously were not part of the campaign to glass the region, it took a lot of effort from a lot of nerds.
---
Oh ok, that's alright, just looks a bit intimidating. 
---
Good luck on the recruiting o7
---
I've stopped droping acid and doing cocaine, but I'm still playing EVE.
---
If you're new, you'll probably want to quit playing. Once you reach a certain point you'll be sleeping through classes because you stayed up all night playing.
---
He seems very mad that some groups in eve actually do things in space.
---
I can confirm I rent from "insert local blob here".
---
&gt; be glued to the game for multiple ~~weeks~~ years to come? 
---
Yes
---
Just take my upvote, well done.
---
Make contract to Dankcheese in 4-4 or give me your name and I will make it.
---
you're just, like, a retard
---
Oh I do archiving as well so the pc does that overnight as well.
---
Ah yeah I have noticed there don't seem to be as many wrecks as I expected. However, the bounty payments still add up overnight.
---
Not seeing any evemails. My ign is different from my reddit name.
---
It's not even charging 😓
---
Like Hotel California. You can log off but you'll never quit.
---
The best part of this post is where it's literally a screen shot from the game of an area we wiped out just to remove it from a hostile coalition so that other groups would come in and take it (*b/c we literally don't give a shit it's on the other side of the map*) but **THIS TOTALLY CANNOT BE REAL MUST DOWNVOTE IT.**
---
&gt; remember to PI on the side
---
if he's omega already, he can do lvl 4s as he wanted
---
I can quit anytime.  Honest.
---
&gt;so that other groups would come in and take it

x
---
Impossible! I was just told people prefer it over fleetcom.space/intel because it works better on phones!

There are homeless people who live in libraries, in parks and on other people's houses. But they have a laptop and they play EVE Online.

Goon grandstanding aside, I just moved into Tribute a week ago because I couldn't be fucked to run a corporation anymore after 13 years and I have to say it's been really, really fun so far. I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

I got a 2.4 the first semester after starting eve...

A mass of incandescent gas will do that.

DM me your ingame name and we can find something out mate!

Are you like this in real life? my god

It costs as much per month to play as WoW. It's just that the free trial version is better than WoW's free trial version (no higher than level 20, which is basically nothing).

&gt;Seems like the only non cancer bloc is FRT at this po
---
not sure how you call the alliance with the highest number of recent bot bans "non-cancer"
---
Super.  I'll make it in the next half hour
---
No but why should I pick up the game but not play it?
---
Spend 15 bucks for a month of omega, and during that month krab a bunch so you have enough to plex for a couple months, and then just keep a buffer of a month or two worth of plex in reserve sp even if you stop playing for a while you can come back and be omega.
---
I was going to recommend CODE to him. But I guess you're the one who should.
---
&gt; I have been buying skins as a way of investing extra ISK I had since they started being released.
---
Contradicts
---
&gt;  in fact I bought them all over the years expecting to apply them to my characters, but never clicked apply
---
The revelation skin alone goes for 10B easily. I'd be willing to sell the 3 for 15B.
---
Taking sov is one thing. Actually undocking and doing stuff in that space is another.
---
C1 with a null static, can capitals travel from null into the C1?
---
If you're in a good corp / good group of players, it's super-addictive, because it's a lot of fun.
---
If you're NOT in a good group of players, you'll probably quit of boredom / set a few long skills to train and not log on for months.
---
That’s not true on iOS. There are, however, content blocking extensions for iOS that should be able to prevent stuff like this.
---
Ah yes.. but then you come back
---
Catalyst ganking t1 industrials can be done on day one.
---
Or play in class because you wasted time sleeping
---
One important thing I realized about eve is it isnt difficult or "deep". It's just inaccessible as fuck. 
---
Nothing is explained in game and unless you go to websites that look like they were designed before the internet bubble burst you'll have no idea how to find and run DED sites. Hybrid reactions what are those? The fuck is a system cost index? 
---
There's just so many layers to Google, but besides googling it's very easy to understand.
---
This is the only post required here
---
I got divorce papers after 8 years of playing, right after my team got dunked in AT6.
---
Turned out pretty good. Married a hottie 11 years younger and moved to Alaska.
---
Addictive? hell most posters here haven't logged on in months.
---
Haven't seen iduatrials that can gank catalysts. Not saying it can't, just haven't seen personally.
---
Emulator maybe?
---
So pretty, ok to look. But best not touch, even if one may want to...
---
New to recording and shit, it will be better next time
---
its fast tho
---
no me
---
We are friendlier than we look.
---
Using safari on iphone x most recent ios, never gotten that
---
Incursions in highsec is great isk for a new player. You'll learn how to play in a fleet with others. Check out the incursion community Warp To Me. You're shooting NPCs with a 40 man fleet. They'll get you started and you'll make a ton of isk if you can train a cheap battleship in like a week or two.
---
One day they will bring two garmurs!
---
Solid advice.  also, if you have questions and have not joined a corp yet, join the chat channel #rookie help.  Lots of us vets and even GMs in there to answer questions and help you figure stuff out.
---
Love me some 3D printing!
---
Really how much ?
---
I once saw a guy in a BS time a smartbomb bs perfectly and irradicate an entire spectre fleet of pods that was landing.
---
It was so beautiful... *tear*
---
Played WoW, GW2, BDO and other mmos. Nothing is like eve, the only game you can legit shit your pants
---
Addictive is a bad way to put it because addiction, or level of, depends a lot on the person not the thing 
---
Anyway. One of the things I like about Eve is it's ability to be picked up and put down. It's always there when I want it and can easily be  stopped.
---
best game out there, role play , people are passionate about it . Make sure you take time to understand the mechanics and lingo, once you pass that get in a good corp that can help you understand how to play, this is the difficult part. And have fun plenty to do ...
---
The contract is up.
---
Oh its already happening up there with snuff supportung ur dunked.
---
Sadly, I didn't think anything of it at the time. After looking just now I see now it is discontinued and should not be sold on Amazon, but fingers crossed that CCP makes it right with the accounts...
---
Yep... Support ticket in since I bought them, still waiting patiently though :)
---
Yeah taking sov from an area of space that literally just got vacated is sooo hard.
---
Wait until you find out about skill injectors.
---
I play during college, you can manage.
---
This dude runs this website as a service to the community. You seriously want him to run it completely free for a bit to stick it to google when nobody else is?
---
Not intimidated but figuring out if I want to play again before I think about corps.

Really? I didn't know this. Is there a reason why?
---
DOOOTLAN. Dude, its one thing to try and be cute. But like, dont be utterly daft.

Bombers bar would like to know your location.

I had to unsub for a month to get my life back in order before I could try playing again
---
What, are you expecting to play a game and have fun? I mean the nerve on you, to think you can sit there in NS and do what you actually want to do in a sandbox? No, fk you, you have to do what I want you to do and if you dont want to play your game simply to be my content then you can either fk off to HS or leave the game.
---
Cause Im a snowflake and my mother loves me.
---
You ever wake up after getting 3 hours sleep to run an ice op so all your corp structures stay fueled for the month.......ever wake up in the middle of the night and instead of checking the time you check zkillboard to see who got fcked while you were away. 
---
My friend this game can be a rabbit hole but one of the best things about this game is the people. I had a rough go for a few months earlier this year and people reached out and it helped a lot.  
---
This game is a sandbox. Be social take chances and you'll never be satisfied with another game.
---
Remind me o bring my own chair if I should ever visit you ;)
---
They are garbage.
---
How much did WinterCo pay them this time?
---
In seriousness, they could have discounted them years ago when they were made obsolete XD
---
Apple generally prevents 3rd party apps from allowing the downloading + execution of executable code. It’s more secure (addons could do malicious things without going through the App Store review process) and stops competing app stores from popping up.
---
Why are you mining in staging?
---
All browsers on iOS are forced to use the safari rendering engine
---
Well WTM runs shield and over insurence.... i guess if you train for Shield then you should be ok...
---
Probably not as much as they’re getting for not shooting the keep in perm
---
&gt; Ads are REALLY complicated beasts.
---
Because Google allows them to be. The provide the structure and support for things like this to proliferate. This isn't a case of people slipping one by Google, it's them using tools provided by them in the first place.
---
Were they not good bikes?
---
So due to unfortunate circumstances, I had to reinstall my Windows since the booting sequence keeps fucking up. This also meant that all apps were uninstalled but placed in a Windows.old folder. Not wanting to redownload about 20 GB worth of data, I decided to download the eve online launcher and copy the SharedCache folder from Steam. I was wondering if there are any differences between the SharedCache folder of steam version and the normal one.
---
We want new players. We have a good training program and Dreddit started as a bunch of day 1 subs. Just staying true to our roots!
---
All ios browsers are really just wrappers of safari. Apple does not allow anything else. See here:
---
https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/
---
"2.5.6 Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript."
---
Unless that has changed and appropriate now refers to more than just the apple webkit... Been a while since I checked but knowing apple I doubt they would relax their stranglehold...
---
Thanks. I can do shorter, but it's hard to cover everything that I think is relevant to the OP each time. Will try!
---
"Many people have many tastes, and they will try to skew you towards their thing." " And above all, remember Eve is a PVP game. PvE is only the means to an end."

You didnt disappoint:)

---
Get on CCP's case about:
---
1) CCP making and selling ships.
---
2) Allowing people like me to ship models and charge for the cost of shipping. Afaik, CCP counts paying / charging for shipping as profit, which is a big no no for them.
---
Let me know what CCP says.
---
Can I just have one then lmao?
---
Neat
---
Edited the post should work now
---
If CCP says I can legally ship you stuff, then sure.
---
It’s not illegal if there is no profit made?
---
Done got vonholed
---
Among other people :eyes:
---
Krab farmers. Not krabs farming.
---
Give it 2 weeks and it will prolly flip back to neutral.
---
My man, number 1, take a breath. Just look at the things out there, Eve is a rather gorgeous game.
---
Nr 2, take you time. Dont listen to all these people trying to force you to play the game their way. If you wanna mine in HS, do it. This is your journey, no one elses. 
---
Nr 3, but whilst you do whatever you want to do, read up, ask questions (nobody will most likely bite you).
---
It will take time to get into things but if you get bored, dont be scared to try new things. Eve has a lot to offer and you will, in time, most likely find what you like the most.
---
Nobody that matters cares and nobody that cares matters.
---
Arty abaddons are even now kinda a thing
---
Then you tab back, see that you're not getting shot at, and realise that that one idiot hit his soundboard again.
---
I had heard that CCP banned (or got on the case of) someone for charging to ship stuff because in CCP's view, if person A sends money to person B in exchange for goods, then person B has technically sold something (which they can't legally do) even if person B had a net monetary loss on the transaction.
---
*crickets*
---
Cheap fit.  Not enough purple.
---
Really? I would have thought they learned from the Sotiyo debacles by now. But I guess its CCP.
---
Meh
---
EVE is a sandbox. Your enjoyment hinges on your motivation. My motivation has died 3 times, over several years, and even now, having left one of the greatest PVP groups to grace the game (V0LTA) because of depression, I still sit and play market games to build capital for when I dig myself out of my hole.  
---
You will enjoy something, tire of it, retrain or create a different character focused on a different activity, and bounce around. It's fantastic if you can get into it, but there's a LOT of niche money-making activities to fall into, and some of them are incredibly difficult to get good at/ train for. Lots of folks find a money niche and a fun niche. They make money to get into something else with a different character/ skillset.
---
\-YOU- control your success, and competing with those who play unfairly at times (bots mostly, creating money) can be taxing, but if you get into a niche that is constantly entertaining and financially lucrative, you will stick with it indefinitely.   
---
The only way to win EVE is to quit. I'm just a shoddy market trader incapable of victory.
---
Alpha bots dont need PLEX. Why would their existence even budge PLEX in any significant matter?
---
Fredrick Vonhole is LEGEND !  I love his baiting style :-)
---
I'm actually against Blackout or at the very least how it's been implemented. We can't just flick the off switch and expect there to be no other consequences. Though I do believe that if it must stay then it can be made to work. The fast that a hostile could bring a titan into your own territory and you don't even know about it is kind of stupid. How many sci fi universes out there actually allow that to happen. But sneaky covert ships flying around behind enemy lines can kind of make sense I can see that happening so fair enough. Though as I understand it they already confirmed that it's here to stay and they intend to relentlessly piss null sec off even more until all the big players are broken apart. They'd rather just kick everything over and make us start again because they're too incompetent to clean up their own mess. Something new every week to give us "PTSD."
---
Google doesn't directly control the W3C. 
---
They are also one of the biggest companies in Earth. They got there because of their ads. If anybody could deal with these issues it would be them. The fact that they haven't implies, to me, that it is not possible to do it any other way.
---
Have roamed there multiple times and so far my impressions are that:
---
A. Cool map
---
B. Terrible place to roam, because it feels empty
---
C. Unsure if it's because I'm going there in the wrong time zones or if I've just been unlucky
---
So far, the only things that made me want to not log in so far have been inevitable forced socialization, and impending promotion to Alpha clone state. I didn't want to lose track of time and be undocked in a ship that I could no longer fly when the clock ticked over.
---
&gt; They are also one of the biggest companies in Earth. They got there because of their ads.
---
Exactly. "Fixing" this or even properly addressing it with advertisers simply isn't good business sense moreso than it being some sort of insurmountable technological obstacle. Google knows what they're about. They're not some poor, hapless vehicle, they're driving the damn thing.
---
Honestly, if we are comparing. An "elite" PvPer is basically just a stronger NPC. The same amount of reasoning, the same obsession to reach an objective (green killboard) and in general just as engaging. 
---
But as we recently discovered, CCP has a hard on for buffing NPCs in null, funny thing tho, the drifters were still a bigger nuisance than the PvPers.
---
Assume that someone cloaky has already bookmarked all of the signatures in the hole and is sitting there waiting for this.
---
It's literally the easiest way to play the game. Takes no skill. No talent.
---
Your friends don't know what they're talking about.
---
that poor soul
---
Yeah we do it for self preservation. That shuttle could be the scout for a bomber fleet. Gotta blap it.
---
ok bud. argue all you want. I like all the skins I have bought and would apply any of them. I also knew that if I didnt apply them they would likely increase in value over time and I wasn't wrong.
---
Ninjaing the loot from a Sotiyo puts you at risk. Concord protects the ninja salvagers in hisec. If it were direct loot instead of salvage they would have to make themselves vulnerable to steal your payout.
---
I haven't tried any of the lowsec sites but i imagine it's a fustercluck of supers plunging every orifice of your ratting fleet.

They havent confirmed it though. Listening to the podcast I actually got a different reaction, that it was only meant to be a test. And Falcon kinda reinforced that by saying that (here on reddit) he wants it to come back at some point. 
---
And at that point it will probably be better balanced than its current form. 
---
But I agree, its a shitty implementation and CCPs behaviour the last month has been very bad in regards to NS. They are blaming us for doing what they wanted, Titans online.
---
done, sorry for the delay
---
*sigh* upvoting a Big Bill The Boss. Fuck me I feel dirty.
---
I think they call them 'bagels.'
---
I did the same thing with a Nyx last night, it was sitting next to a control tower under a shield bubble. I skedaddled once the turrets opened fire. Strangely enough, they didn’t fry the Velator I was using before I could warp off.
---
Ah true. Thats shitty honestly. 
---
I imagine it would be.
---
the rosada dawn rorq skin was one of the first that i really wanted, i actually hate mining and dont own a rorq, but seemed like a sexy bait ship :)  also &lt;3 Nomad Justice skin and Nyx Quafe, was hard to find those and havnt seen em since cept the one someone posted recently on market for 60b...
---
Off the top of my head I could give you 10 bil off the top, more then 10% off sell prices, I dont know how much more you would need to feel it was fair. again msg me in came or private msg me on here.
---
AAR please?
---
no sorry no ironblood
---
Realistically, you will become a criminal quite quickly if you engage in PvP in lowsec, which is imo some of the most fun you can have with solo/small gang PvP.
---
PvP in nullsec and wormholes dont affect your security status, so you technically wouldnt become a 'criminal'.
---
Wouldn’t have upvoted even if you weren’t such an obvious twat. Carriers and blackops.
---
At least this guy has the balls to undock that thing.
---
&gt;  I'm a casual player and it's a lot of isk for me, but I really want it 
---
and this is what I feel, there arent many I really care about but certain ships its really fun and nice to have a dope skin, so i bought lots of them over time, and now I have tons lol. glad you could get that skin, i had a hard time selling it :(
---
Repost,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cp6cyr/chameleon\_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cp6cyr/chameleon_down/)  someone mentioned it like 10 mins earlier already :3
---
I've noticed that people who go from EVE to Elite generally wind up hating Elite ... They get so used to the massive scale of EVE, between corps, manufacturing, station constructing, hell there's even nation building. Then they go to Elite without realizing that it's a completely different kind of game. In EVE you're playing Captain Picard or Commander Cisko, Admiral Ackbar or Emperor Palpatine. In Elite you're playing Han Solo or Lt Colonel McQueen, maybe a bit of Captain Kirk thrown in.
---
If you have this problem you should really go see a doctor.
---
Soooo funny thing happened tonight, musta right clicked the wrong container, put it on contracts for 2 bil buyout.... with well over 50bil worth closer to 100 bil.... came back to game an hour and half later, wondering where the fuck all my shit went, and cant figure it out, bout ready to send a ticket, then wondering why i had a container I thought i had set up a contract for.... SOOOO FUCKING LUCKY.... nobody bought it. best rush  i have had in eve lol, market pvp fail :( but somehow so lucky... thought yall might like the story, woulda been quite different if i came back to see it had sold.... wow.
---
Smartbomb aren't friendly
---
Sell em and Bag em
---
Probably has more to do with FRT internally sorting things out.
---
PandaFam is back due to popular demand.
---
Scanning down mission runners and stealing their loot/salvaging their wrecks is a great way to start. Half the time people flying $50 ships too paranoid to shoot you for doing it.  Then work your way into ninja looting Incursion fleets, etc. You dont need a low sec status to be a true Eve scumbag :)
---
Made me laugh, thank you
---
His zkill is impressive, what exactly is he doing special?
---
I double shit super ticks running missions in lowsec while being twice as safe
---
&gt;that he just bought.
---
[hmmmmmmmmm](https://zkillboard.com/character/1532457873/ship/33675/)
---
He's the best blops hunter in the game from what I've seen and he's fairly good at hunting at ships.
---
I, too, want to hear more about his ways.
---
\[Enjoy the fun.\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNB\_RjpWnsI)
---
Way worse, the game was bought by a Korean mmo developer pearl abyss who makes black desert online, and it's taking the direction of all the previous MMOs from the region.
---
How do you get to 1040 dps? What fit are you using?
---
I’m poor, I don’t have omaga
---
I just want MONEEEEEY
---
I’m just mining, I’m a newbean and have no clue what staging is anyway.
---
oy! hang yourself with em ya gob shite!  
---
(sorry I'm not any kinda brit, was that okay?)
---
smartbomb with a full rack if youre not a pussy
---
D E A D A S S?
---
*hmmmmm*
---
Thanks man, appreciate the positive community around EVE
---
vonhole strikes again...
---
Watch out. We are all stuck here, struggrling to get into RL.
---
We just cant. 6 years already.
---
Judging from this guy's kd seems like a elite lowsec newb killer
---
2,282 votes say "Press F to pay respects", but loot fairy says no and burns Unit W-634\`s Omnidirectional Tracking Link while staring in your eyes like Jules Winnfield...
---
Glad you could let it go (for a ton of isk).  It's one of my favorite ships, and Ghostbird is a dope skin for sure.  Thanks again!
---
We have a guy that plays with a soundboard on comms sometimes, good guy, doesn't over do it, he set off a armor warning once, 3 people freaked out, I think he agreed to not use that again.
---
And back and back and back and back lol I speak from experience lol
---
No the hole needs to be Very Large for capitals to be able to go through and you can only get 3 through them. The classes of wormholes that support that are C5/C6 when they get a wandering wh to null pop up.
---
It's a genuinely hilarious way of dealing with spodbrains.
---
nice haiku
---
Sometimes, I get the feeling that the badly-written anti-blackout propaganda posts are from the same people who do badly-written propaganda posts on r/sino. Maybe we can have r/cyno as a containment sub for such posts.
---
YouDidThis?IdidThis.jpg
---
I mean why is he the best? :)
---
Seems to me like he bait blops with something then a cloaky ships hold them tight enough to jump in 2-4 carriers.
---
Well lets see... Are you slightly autistic? Do you have OCD tendencies? Do you love making spreadsheets? Giggle with glee when you startle unsuspecting people? Have desires to rule the universe? Love pounding rocks for hours on end?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If so, just stop fooling yourself and quit school now. Eve is life.
---
nice. cool sight isnt it? hey what system is this looks cool.
---
Behold, God's greatest mistake!
---
He may not be the best but he's at-least the only notable person in the community doing it as far as I'm aware. I can't name anyone else that has specialized in baiting blops. I assume there are others but I imagine they are glad they aren't seen as much as vonhole and friends.
---
Only 5, and really the widow did it all.
---
And widows suck now.
---
Because they're in nullsec in massovely huge swarms.
---
bad
---
Ah, that's my confusion.
---
You made it sound like your Corp was making the contracts while it's the members with stuff offering the contracts to the Corp.
---
But also, what you could do is just tell people they aren't to accept them, and then kick people that do.
---
Underrated comment right here. 🥇
---
Gosh damn. 
---
That's something I did not expect.
---
That's not true. There are plenty of reasons for joining CODE.
---
Coasties are pretty Minmatar. Especially when they drink in Juneau.
---
Take your updoot
---
Hell yeah, thanks to you and Eve, I now have a name for that thing that happens to me sometimes.
---
Works totally fine for me.
---
Use the desktop site.
---
Why do you use mobile sites?
---
Come on it is $14 for a month.   Buy the guys making the game a fricken sandwich occasionally.
---
The “insurance payouts” made me exhale through my nose.
---
Just drop out of school now
---
100k bounty is nothing to worry about. You can buy a cheap frig and get it blown up in lowsec.
---
However the bounty might come from someone who might actually be a friend of yours. The bounty payout generates a mail to whoever placed the bounty on you. Some players use this system to track activity of people. They'd put down a bounty on someone who has been inactive for years and reconnect if they get a notification.
---
What?
---
Nice way to Wake Up some sleppy bros
---
Its made to fit your size
---
Rip
---
Mainly because for every significant gank he makes a new character to bait and fakes a kill history to look more legit.
---
It’s not the smartbombs that get you.. it’s the 10,000m/s Warrior II’s that can chase you out to 300km lol
---
No big deal - Since CCP broke ECM the Chameleon is worth about 4isk anyway.
---
Then you start frantically going through your multiple open clients trying to figure out which one is dying, and of course by the time you find it it's already dead
---
Ahh another fellow goonswarm flair.. I see you enjoy redditing on hard mode as well.
---
Bounty system is nonsense, also you have a smaller bounty than some rats.
---
If ccp weren't alergic to money they would just request a percentage of the profit on each sale stating a minumum amount. The models are sold through the eve forums in a specific tab that produces a job number/tracking number.
---
If the seller does not provide the percentage of the sale (based on model size for minimum fee) directly to ccp then they breach agreement for use of licence, the seller holding all liabilty of warranty and quality control for products produced. All they provided was a use of a licensed model to the manufacturer.
---
Easy mode. Everyone winner. Please send avatar dildo.
---
Sooth.
---
Then just pay for one month and do that plan.
---
Or run the Raven through level 3s until you Plex.
---
It’s the only game I know of where people talk about getting burnout unironically.
---
Got a link?
---
Yes. Every dlc can be applied once.
---
Depots already exist for spam.
---
Those are different. K think those can actually be applied as many times as you have codes.
---
This is the only game I know of that reading the equivalent of War and Peace is suggested prior to playing.
---
fuck ur mom
---
Yes, but POS modules don't have a 48hr reinforcement :)
---
Make a new account with your first account as the referral, you'll get 1M sp on the new account. Buy starter packs for both accounts (10 bucks for both I think), buy one month of omega for the new account and the first account will get 2 weeks of omega free. Use the 2 weeks of omega on the first account to rat and do whatever you can for money and keep training it, and skill the second account into a battleship for incursions. This all assumes you have $25 to spend on a god damn video game.
---
Coming back after being gone for awhile, I used to manufacture boosters in a POS, is that all gone now? Do you need a refinery for booster manufacturing? How much does it cost to build medium refinery?
---
PI is omega locked? I never realised!
---
It just wouldn't be as fun any other way.
---
Name checks out
---
Better idea
---
1. Finish removing POS
---
2. Replace Depots with a tiny portable Citadel.
---
- no docking, just tethering
---
- repairs, refit, and cargo storage only accessible while tethered (no flags) 
---
- no reinforcement timers, just a decent measure of shields and armor
---
aww don't they look so cute
---
wow you just conformed it.
---
Mega oof. I woulda sent it back after the enevitable eve mail but damn.. Scary misclick.
---
oh shit!
---
the combat sites are worth it but the reward vs investment ratio is proportional to the ship you're flying. a frigate can pay the cost on the first site but dont come expecting to pay out a Battlecruiser on the first try. i think the main problem with wormhole habitation for newcomers is that they read those guides telling about BCs or Gilas or T3 destroyers/cruisers as if the lowest classes were going to pay such expensive endeavors.
---
a C1 can sustain a T1 frigate  fairly easily with only a handfull of sites a day (Data + Relic + Anomalies + Gas Sites, even if you dont plan to huff the resources just kill the rats), its not much but you're basically earning more than the ship's original cost.
---
it would take longer to get that money back using shit like a Gnosis or a well fitted cruiser. if you want those kind of expenses C2 or even C3 are the way to go. C1 should be for the frigate enthusiast due to being low entry points and low risk places (no large ships passing by, just small to medium).
---
Oh never seen one sell at all. It'll take me a few more locust fleets to blow that isk. I'll hit you up in a month or two if no one else buys it
---
-How long of a tether range ya think? 1km?
---
-Password needed ya think so it could be used between fleet/corp mates?
---
Yes, I am, I have absolutely no clue what the problem is and am pretty new to the game.
---
Whats the problem?
---
One more ship that was fucked and NOT fixed after ecm changes. Gj CCP 👌
---
Anyhow... Vonholed. 🙏😍
---
I'd do the same 2,500m most things like this do.
---
And you could have a prompt on deployment. Launch for self, fleet, or Corp. Then the accessibility is quickly and easily decided.
---
Then you never saw the mighty Procurer fleet Roaming.
---
Nullsec gang, can relate
---
Noob question what does zkill is? I just started playing Eve lol
---
They talked about them in the August parch note.
---
Rgr, I like this idea of removing depot reinforcement, increased ehp, tether and repair idea
---
Last one I saw sold was months ago ...actually regret not getting more of those
---
Fair enough.
---
Ok broad question. I can give you more detail if you want on anything. Done mostly everything in ten years. 
---
There are 4 main factions which really just determine where you start out and first ship you get into. None are better than the other anymore. The game starts you in what is called highsec which would be closest to training lands in most games (except eve is nothing like other games... big rabbit whole on the securities of solar systems). The developers are trying hard to make the new layer experience better as it traditionally sucked. It gives you some basics on how to play, but it's very basic. You will learn more from fellow players than the tutorial. Tutorial will give you some basic equipment though. 
---
After tutorial the universe is your oyster. Choose what you want to do. You can run military missions, hauling missions, mining missions, etc from any npc faction basically. They will generate money and rewards. It will also impact how other npc groups see you.
---
If you don't care about npc groups (it doesn't really impact you, again deep rabbit whole)... you can explore space, kill npc's, mine for yourself, build, manipulate the market (completely player driven economy), or join a player Corp/ alliance. Possibly taking part in huge wars, or just casual fights. 
---
I'm not sure what specifically you want info on so ask away.
---
I will say that we should have some replacement for the corporate/personal hangar array. Or at the very least personal hangar divisions that can be shared across characters.
---
Lmao
---
&gt; inevitable forced socialization
---
No such thing in EVE
---
I'm addicted to not playing it
---
Worst sound ever...especially when you hear the shield alarm and you are in the next room!
---
rio is hordes staging system, where there sfuff is, also one of their most dangerous systems as roamers will go there. go on the mining fleets with your venture and stay in a group, most everything can kill you including belt rats so the group will protect you, other then that, ask in the horde discord channel :)
---
Do not relax your vigilance to any newbie who do mining and lost mining ships all day in local....
---
Cause they all have a tackle fit astero (cheap fit for black ops) or a bomber (for AT ships) in their hanger!
---
Use  brave browser on your mobile. It natively blocks all redirects and ads. Just tested on mine again and it works fine.
---
You can look up any player or corp's pvp history on it.
---
Less tank than a Gila, and a huge bonus to make sure he's the only thing hostiles can target. Nice!
---
https://i.imgur.com/i8XRckv.png
---
u need a lesson or two about posting
---
Should have ganked one
---
Unless my math is completely off kilter here....how is a pure drone ship such as the Ishitar or the Dominix supposed to have en remotely similar DPS to hybrid ones such as the Gila and Rattlensnake(I know t1/t2, so not entierly fair)?
---
Just looking at the Ishtar, it get at Gallente Cruiser 5 a grand wooping total of 50% increased dmg and hp while the Gila has 500%dmg and 250% health. Granted, with medium drones only, and can only field 2, but with pure drone dmg alone it still waaaay out dpses a Ishtar...and that even before you add in the missiles? Sure you get the utility of using sentry drones etc, though considering the drone bay size of the Gila, you could use those as well (albeit with very reduced dmg)...
---
So in terms of PVE...why on earth would you use the Ishtar over Gila? It has a lower skill investment, similar isk cost and higher total dps?
---
Reminds me of the CFC back in the day of North domination, but now the alt-corps are alt-allies and the space is empty as before...
---
not anymore
---
Try
---
=VLOOKUP("1000002|"&amp;VLOOKUP(A30,TypeID!$B:$C,2,FALSE)&amp;"|false",Prices!A:J,4,FALSE)
---
Check the number of zeros in that region id. It may be off.
---
Wait, thats a thing? That totally explains a lot. Have an Tristan that I could swear looked super rusty and dirty, but I figured it was just the lighting or something...
---
Thats a fun mechanic though:D
---
Only good thing about this game is that if you are playing you never get behind even if you can’t play. So it is addicting but it’s easy to step away for a few weeks and still make progress
---
Yeah, I figured that out when I logged in and got the Alpha clone state pop-up. Thanks for trying, though.
---
They added it with killmarks.
---
The grime increases based on date from first boarding the ship.
---
But it seems a bit inconsistent. I had a 2 month old tengu that looked like it had been out in the rain once, and my 1 month old providence looks like it was submerged in the bottom of the ocean for 12 years, dragged back to the surface, and had a man with an old cloth run over some of the surfaces.
---
That or some large Bloc will decide they want it and sweep them away with Snuff catching a few kills along the way.
---
Link please, I can't find it
---
Then you see your rattlesnake bumped by nyx inside 10/10 as his fighters left for coffee break...
---
It's not bugged, your addons are just being good boys.
---
GMVA is on the map... WE'RE FAMOUS!
---
Bullshit. All it takes is to not be the kind of dickhead who will block people simply for being friendly. And then accidentally meeting someone who spends most of their time talking to people instead of flying.
---
A hangar system similar to what is announced for bookmarks would be nice. Let's see how the new bookmark system works out.
---
That’s not being fat that’s just a thing that happens anyways.
---
[The pirate implant set formerly known as "Slave" has been renamed to "Amulet" in preparation for a future change to which pirate faction provides them to players. This change does not impact the functionality of these implants in any way.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pvysmm/patch-notes-for-august-2019-release)
---
I'm pretty sure a Gila with the same fit would be *better*. The Chameleon is in a really sad state.
---
Ty bb
---
Its $20 usd / month to plex.
---
So they're getting a sandwich, chips and a drink off plex sales
---
Code are functionally more like highsec jihadists? Unless that's what he/she is looking for.
---
Should to say few good things about Goons politic vs small alliances on our example.
---
(we live in PB 5 years)
---
In 2016-2017 we had a agreement with GOTG and were a allies, but they are broke our friendly treaty and even helped PH to evict us. PH gave us ultimatum: join or die. Alliance died.  
---
In the end of 2017 we create another one and even had 1-2 small systems just like bones for dogs and NIP with GOTG:) After moon update, PH start to mining moons in our home NPC system. We start to kill their miners :) That's was the reason, why they are start "Revenge for blood of innocent miners" and together with GOTG evicted us :) 
---
But we started SOV fappening, because instead give a air to small independent alliance with 200 active pilots by zkb, they are oppressed us. 
---
In the beggining of 2018 after PH is gone to Geminate and GOTG moved to deep North; GOTG jb ans PB sov were in dangerous, because we are, and because "Goons is coming" :) So GOTG contact us with words:
---
\- What are you want for stop this shit? 
---
\- 1 constellation
---
\- Ok, and +?
---
\- No, and NIP
---
\- ..... ok, but if goons will coming - you should help us in def! and we will help you too!
---
\- ok
---
We called our old friends from FXR and propose them to be our neighbors with the same conditions. Around GOTG invited a few low-sec alliances.
---
So, in 2018, Goons is came.
---
One alliance disbanded because "Goons paid and invited to join them."
---
Other alliances are just evacuated back to low-sec :)
---
We tried to help FXR on the def, but GOTG didn't even try. Agreement? Forget it :)
---
So the FXR was totally burned.
---
During this time, we spoke with approximately 3 Goons diplomats.
---
We were surprised by the courtesy, tact and attention of these people to our small alliance.
---
\- We are a neutral, independent alliance. FXR are our old friends, we will continue to help them. Yes, we have NIP with GOTG, and therefore we do not attack their structures. 
---
\- Ok, we will try to come up with something
---
\- We are even should help GOTG if you attack :) 
---
\- This is harder, why do you don't break this agreement after all?
---
\- We don't want to be like them
---
\- Very pity, you are cool guys but, you know what it's mean?
---
\- Yep
---
Last conversation was after we lose last fortizar. But then attacks stopped. Only small groups of Imperium entusiasts sometimes tried to reinforce tcu/hubs but we successful killed them all and saved our sov. 
---
So what I'm want to say? When Gotg/ph/etc looked to us like at shit. Goons really tried to find a  best option in relations with us :) And even when didn't find any way, they are decided to don't to destroy our home.
---
...
---
Oh, yes, January of 2019. We was kicked from all chats with GOTG. RR attacked our structures. After question "WTF?NIP?!", they are answered: - Just.... :)

Hold up, killmarks? Are you telling me that if I look real close I should also find little notches on my ship for stuff Ive killed?!
---
Real question, could you fire this bad boy using this method or would it fail spectacularly and kill everyone Involved
---
I love this as a coastie and eve player it's perfect, if anyone was wondering this is on a Hamilton class high endurance cutter, and that is a round from the 76 mm gun, it would be the equivalent of an auto cannon in game.
---
My buddies warned me not to start playing because it's so addictive and can ruin any relationship or family.  So naturally here i am a year later
---
for player piloted non-rookie ship kills, yes.
---
Without the chamber walls of whatevers firing it you instead have a bomb because the shell casing does not have enough tensile strength to withhold the explosion.
---
No there is electronic safeties involved inside the chamber of the mk-75, 76 mm gun.
---
I was a gunners mate in the USCG and served aboard a cutter just like the one in the picture.
---
You showed us where you mining:)
---
Always hide intel
---
From what I gathered online..
---
[Medical Boosters](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Medical_Boosters) can be created by first refining gasses at a [Refiner](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Refinery)y (some requirements for system security in terms of gasses), and then produced at any normal manufacturing plant.
---
Cheapest Refinery would be the [Athanor](https://eve-marketdata.com/price_check.php?type_name_header=Athanor) cost around 800-900m isk if you where to buy it outright. Getting a BPC and producing it yourself should lower the cost somewhat. Keep in mind you also need fuel and modules for the station. 
---
If you cant be arsed to set that up yourself, alternatively not within your current budget, you could perhaps find another station and "borrow" their facilitates (or ally yourself with a corp that has one)
---
*Laughs in fleet*
---
game is dead, wait for blackout fix
---
Well I haven's sucked cock to play Eve, yet. I have lied to get out of work and social obligations though.
---
how uh... how does one get this power?
---
He's just good at baiting, like to an extreme, you won't be able to tell that you're in trouble until there's no way back. It's not more complicated than that, but is easier to be said than done, creating a convincing kill history, settng up everything, the stalking. Many blops and at ships died to it and many more will. good stuff.
---
Kill everyone involved.  Mostly like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/cohz2m/iraqi_soldiers_digging_up_a_155mm_shell_being/) (NSFW at /r/CombatFootage).
---
Haha, Yea, was just making my statement because I was intimidated.
---
Ey, Think I should ask, what's the krabbing like these days in sov space? Easy to beat incursions doing anoms/whatever?
---
Yea, it's a good idea.
---
I must reccomend to have a ship blown up by npcs now and then. It prevents you from getting too attached to ships and thus leading to losses hurting even more.
---
I whelped a rattlesnake to trigs the other day, 1.3bn gone just like that. Mild salt for about an hour and then I was fine again.
---
Shut up u little fraggle

Hull value on zk needs a bump. You won't even find an AT frig for 150b nowadays

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Pure speculation I must admit but if there is/was enough bots to faucet a couple trillion into the economy per some unit time, this either inflates isk making everything more expensive and ratting less profitable or, if that isk was mostly spent on plex, pushing up the demand and having the price react accordingly.
---
I guess a driver behind the botting arguments is that we don't really know a: How much isk they make and b: what they spend it on

The sheer number of stub articles and articles which do not reflect their topic / title is astounding.

I am a proponent of a "pos-like structure"
---
If it is pos-es or something new. We need the ability of setting up a staging area in a system we wish to attack.
---
I am keen on defending my small pos that I can get working in maximum 30 minutes (with the bonus of the thing closing a disposable amount of isk)
---
So if CCP removes them, fine, but I would want something that would replace it with largely the same function.
---
Note: Saw that PH(?) video of a wormhole eviction they did and their use of staging poses to get the job done.

Well rorqs don't have mining lasers, so i'm not sure they are part of the discussion. 
---
Anyway, rorqs will remain a problem for as long as there is infinite ore at anytime everywhere and they can be multiboxed in ridiculous numbers.
---
&gt;Mainly because for every significant gank he makes a new character to bait and fakes a kill history to look more legit.
---
Like others have said, he only uses clean characters so its impossible to see it coming. I lost a blops to him while I was out soloing and it was a very unique bait. 
---
I found a Tengu in dead space, and it logged out as I was in warp to him. So I though easy kill. Lit the cyno, started pewing with my blops and then +1 in local. Spamming d-scan, didn't think much of it as I quickly zkilled the char and it was clean. 2 seconds later, astero decloaks on me and lights a cyno. I immediately lock up the astero and try to neut off the point, but the nid jumps in and points me as I pop him. I woulda got away but got the not cycling "feature" on one of my heavy neuts \*thx CCP\*
---
Addictive? Well to some degree maybe. To summarize things up, you will inevitably:  
---
\- check zkill/discord/reddit before you even check the time when you wake up  
---
\- you will lie to people to get out of social obligations  in order to make time for playing  
---
\- you will burn out or at least loose motivation then regain it while doing other things or setting new goals.  
---
or you will simply not understand the mechanics, think this game is stupid and quit after 3 weeks.

Fxr in imperium... So saaaaaaad

AAR Please.

So if I want to do 5/10s in Highsec, the odd wormhole site and 6-10/10 DED daytripping into null, would the Loki or Tengu be better?

There's a lot of solo players left over from the belligerent undesireables style of gameplay, you can search for articles on bumping/ninja looting/can flipping/mission baiting/awoxing/corp theft

CODE are more noted for verbal garbage. I really wouldn't recommend them on that basis. The "propaganda" quotations get pretty dry pretty fast. It was sorta funny the first time. But its been years and we still hear it.. eek.

I won't over say it, but "RP" is a generous interpretation.

Monopolisation Risk (super low brokerage now, but risk is it wont remain) and convenience - Player owned stations can get popped and then you lose the listing and have to asset safety and move and relist - traders have A LOT of shit. Those 2 reasons.

Wormholes don't have asset safety. What happens when someone there has an emergency and can't login for a week and comes back to find out they were evicted.

---
Well, a lot of the rorqs modules use omega skills, and those would offline once your account deactivates.
---
pretty sure the industry core, panic, drones, etc would all be unusable...and your ship would no longer have any of the skill based bonuses...
---
We've been all over the map in a years time. FeelsBadMan.
---
[removed]
---
Yes.
---
But the big difference is in 5 heavy drones vs 2 medium drones.
---
Medium drones do half the damage of a heavy drone.
---
So a normal medium drone is 1, and a heavy drone is 2.
---
The Gila can launch 2, that with bonuses count as 10 (2*500%).
---
The Ishtar can launch 10 that count as 15 (10*150%).
---
So the ishtar would, theoretically, always do 50% more damage than the gila for drone damage alone.
---
At least, in terms of peak potential damage. Applied is different but depends on your target.
---
Other factosr that might affect your choice are that medium drones are faster, and less likely to be attacked by rats, and of course overall fit since their slots are different.
---
Like the ishtar can fit more DDAs so you can do even MORE damage, and the Ishtar has a longer base control range plus that mwd bonus.
---
Gila has more mids so you can more easily passive shield tank.

What's up with Jita and all the criminals around there? This weekend I had to pick something up in Jita (a place I don't really go to normally) Did I just stumble upon a bunch of gankers waiting for freighters or something? They left me alone but that's probably more because I didn't had much of value.
---
Is this common around there?
---
You could just do the normal thing and have the game download dynamically as you play.
---
It takes barely over 1gb to just play the game, then it downloads assets on the fly as you need them.
---
Agreed. Unfortunately though I don't think the mobile game will fail. It will in Europe and the US, but the Chinese mobile market dwarfs that, and it may succeed there.
---
&gt; I also believe that the gates between systems should be maintained by the owners of the systems and even be destroyed leaving isolated areas.

And tell me, which are those things a null player can't do and a player outside null blocks can?
---
Because from what I saw during several years of Eve there are more opportunities inside a null alliance than outside.
---
People shit posting against null blocks are so cute, they think they're the heart of Eve and all the game's spinning around them... 
---
In reality with few exceptions most of them are insignificant in the grand scale of the game, nobody outside eve community knows or care about them, they never did something in the game that will be remembered.

Tnx a lot! o7
---
A lot of people prefer mining as a chilling activity. You know, like, in the evening after work you pop a beer, fire up your lasers and enjoy the small wrooming from your 5.1 while you lay down the day. You spin your ship every few minutes, enbrace the graphics, talk with friends, hold yourself to the code, transfer your ore to the station, contemplate what to do with it and call it a day. Then you log in to world of tanks or something to pump your blood pressure up again.

Wasn't this how anoms worked before they just made them always warpable from the probe window?

If we look at the "real" botters who RMT then a fair assumption would be that they sit on the isk until they sell it off. Now the people who buy that isk will most likely buy stuff including PLEX. But someone who buys that isk will most likely buy large amounts right? No point in buying only 2b (one time) isk when you might as well do that legally and not risk anything.
---
So the isk isnt sourced out too alot of people but rather a smaller amount of players (with higher amounts of isk /trade) meaning their impact on PLEX will be rather insignificant. But if the bots (a certain procent of bots do need PLEX since they use supers for instance) themselves were using PLEX that would mean a large amount of "players" would need PLEX thereby affecting the price upwards. 
---
Thats my take on it. 
---
I dont believe we have less bots in the game now than before, quite the opposite actually. When looking at the newborn graphs it shows we have a large stream of "players" creating new accounts/chars. One could argue that due to the blackout many new players are joining but I doubt it. Instead, judging by what people are saying is happening in HS, I think new bots were created and in larger quantity than before to cover the deficit per bot. 
---
All in all, I doubt PLEX is affected in any large way by bots. Its alot more affected by skill farms and the demand for SP than anything else, arguably even more than players buying PLEX to use for free subscription. What we are seeing right now with the PLEX is most likely a result of summer (slowest Eve period of the year), SP being too cheap and not worth amassing/extracting due to CCP login events plus tons of real players just sitting out the blackout, i.e., bubble bursting as you say. The bubble might have even started bursting a bit earlier since Rorqs got nerfed (saw lots selling off their Rorqs around that time) and those are probably the biggest PLEX drivers since they require tons of SP and need subscription every month.
---
Imo atleast.
---
Back to using a PH alt as blue scout in Deteroid

It’s a 2003 game and still in existence

r/forbiddenfleshlight
---
The game is rather "pay to become a loot pinata".   
---
You can play the game for free and have certain restrictions (which may hinder you to do what you want to, like cloaking your ship for various reasons). Other than that you pay for a monthly subscription. At some point in the game you will figure out that having once account does not quite cut it. Some people in this game have 10+ accounts, some even have 100+. I'd say to do the interesting things you need at least 2 to 3 accounts and depending on what you wanna do with them, you need to subscribe them at some point.   
---
as it has already been stated: Never try to farm your Eve subscription with ingame money. It is just not worth the time. You could possibly achieve high value income due to market pvp (buying, selling, trading goods) but that is a mini game of its own.
---
This is a cool idea.
---
Okay, so you personally found mining uninteresting.
---
Good for you, have a cookie.
---
Jita is the main market hub, which also means it attracts lots of dumb rich highsec carebears.
---
It also attracts a lot of really expensive haulers from other areas.
---
A common thing to do is sit on the warp in to the station in tornadoes and just alpha any blockade runners that land. Then loot them.
---
Blockade runners TEND to be used when carrying a lot of stuff of really high value, so it will likely pay off, plus they cost more than tornadoes base so the killboard stays green.
---
I know they didn’t escalate and  the only way yo get an escalation was to scan it. A certain Dev was like “oh, hey. Lets just seed the fuck out of rare loot because durrr. Then we will nerf all the rare pirate BS shit because i can durr harder.”
---
Now do the same in a venture, assume new player that don't know much about the game.           
---
Can you find it boring ?        
---
Will you play game that from the start can be so boring?
---
I did this recently, but in a highsec orca.
---
I had an orca for other reasons and thought, this character is sitting around doing nothing quite often, I have a second surface I can just run it on while I do other stuff.
---
Basically made no money at all and still required more engagement than I really wanted for that shit of money.

Is there anything to even steal from incursion fleets? I've never bothered as I thought the rats didn't drop loot/salvage

If it weren't for blackout you'd bet your ass that someone would take tribute and Vale to rent it out.
---
would you say hes a master at it?
---
Lol?
---
People don’t understand this.  If they aren’t constantly entertained with exhilarating lasers and punishing decisions they aren’t satisfied.
---
So they fit their cloaks and stare at pve ships and warps for 12 hours until finding something to shoot.
---
Semi sarcasm aside... Mining is enjoyably chill, not everything has to be pubg.  Don’t push it on newer players without other options, but it’s grinding like any other game
---
One issue with destroying gates is that it is a HUGE HUGE buff to nullsec safety.
---
Having jump bridges and prepositioned cynos would make any real nullsec logistics not really be any more difficult than now, but having no gates would have anyone wanting to roam for fights basically impossible.
---
Now, if there was some kind of trade off in regards to a offlining of stargates and disabling cynos and jump bridges for a few days as a system action, then it is at least partially balanced (still a bonus to the safety side)
---
It's cool on a conceptual level, but really bad from an actual ecosystem level.
---
This is an old map. Doesn't show INIT sov, and Snuffed only has one system in Cloud Ring.

---
Every alliance in tribute is 99% focused on PVP.

Reminder. The rorqual is a boosting ship, a fleet support ship, not a mining ship.
---
It shouldn't have the best yield to begin with.
---
no see the narrative was that the blackout hurts the little guys and doesnt let them establish themselves. Seems like Trigger Happy, Centipede Caliphate, Rote Kapelle, Unspoken Alliance, Toxic Company, Reverberation Project, and Forsaken Empire are all doing it wrong then.

I thought this was what they where going to do with FOBs.

First: why would you even send him 5? Did you think it was not a scamm even for a second?
---
Second: No isk is worth typing that much bullshit, what a shitty way of playing a game.
---
If he was dropping carriers on gilas you'd have a point but this is 160b worth of cruiser. You want to do everything to secure the kill because you will likely never get the same opportunity against the same guy, which usually means dropping carriers.
---
Resource collection is always a pretty boring task, in every game. It is repetitive by default, there are some forms that are a bit more challenging (the way to get Abyssal stuff for example), but in the end, all of them are grind.
---
I agree with you, that EVEs mining (lock rock, activate laser, make sure ore hold does not fill up/ roid is not empty) is not the most difficult implementation, but allows for very easy multi-boxing, even better with Rorquals and compression involved.
---
Mining needs a rework, since it basically has not changed since it was implemented, I wonder how that new mining system would look like though.
---
That shit made me laugh

I feel you.. Bought a rorq toon and a rorq because reddit said its full afk easy isk.. First evening i lost an excav against an npc dread.. 2.nd evening i was looking a little more for the rorq.. But it was sooo boring, after the 3rd or 4th evening i never mined again.. v0v
---
What a loss
---
Damn dude, these videos are great! Please don't stop making them.
---
&gt;lost too many people to high sec
---
What kind of corp loses people to high sec?
---
I've heard of corps losing people to wormholes, even heard of corps losing people to FW. But how horrible does a corp have to be that people would rather live in *high sec* than staying with it?
---
The mother ship drops good loot. Not sure about he rest.
---
Soo u want to destroy npc gates and only have player owned ones? Hell yeah screw all the neuts who dares to travel trough sov from someone else XD
---
The one issue though is that wormholes are far too sporadic and have mass limitations, which benefit the nullsec defenders.
---
I’ve always thought it would be cool if WH’s could Link 2, maybe 3 systems together ‘permanently’, you would have to limit it to the same class or something so you can’t have a c5 with hisec connections...
---
Nobody on this sub would give a damn if he dropped a cruiser. The catch is that he dropped on a limited AT cruiser that could have avoided the fight *entirely* by staying cloaked.
---
But having your favorite Venture punching bag (look at the zkill of the cyno) upship into a Stealth bomber and thinking that's just what you needed as a new killmark on your AT ship and then getting killed (in this case by Vonhole) is a very EVE thing.
---
It's neither good or bad (it might be a very bad day for Avenger18 though) and saying we "like" Vonhole also might be a stretch.
---
We can agree however, that he puts a lot of work into baiting out blops and gets rewarded with shiny kills for it. We probably will never know how many failed attempts Vonhole has, because those would look like a character with a bad zkill history loosing a cyno vessel, then stopping to play EVE.

yet it was enough to get this guy worried even for a nanosecond. at just 100k isk i'd say it was worth it
---
I want to be a supporting voice here.
---
I raised reasonably hard before the blackout and reasonably hard afterwards. 
---
There is a stark difference to the way that nullsec is populated. There is massive regions of nothing and literally nothing.  There has been a clear and obvious exodus of players from nullsec into highsec specifically because of the risk involved with farming in nullsec vs the risk/reward of the abyssal sites.
---
I most certainly don’t support the rollback of blackout in any way shape or form, but nullsec clearly needs to get some love here, even if it’s just nerfing the abyssal sites and boosting nullsec isk
---
That's a you problem, not a game problem.

How feasible? It’s the whole fucking point of the place.

its a paladin, marauders are one of the most expensive ships you can kill in hisec, it has shoot me written all over it.
---
no extra motivation needed.
---
All depends on the quality of rocks.         
---
Let say that current rocks have 100 trit, if you make rocks that have 1-5 trit that are the 99% of the rocks in such belts, but you also add rocks that have 10.000 trit in this belt - but you need to find them.        
---
Situation changes.
---
I like the black out. But so many cowards and cry babies leaving its hurting providence. Isk buff for nullsec would be nice. Some sort of continuous dscan even.
---
Most of this subreddit is a cheering chorus for the blackout.  However, if you objectively consider what many are saying about the current state of null, the OP makes perfect sense.
---
If your corp has been living in null and doesn't have a caps umbrella, suddenly, doing any kind of farming, to make money to buy more shiny PVP ships, becomes too expensive.
---
I suspect that the OP's assertion about highsec may not be correct.  I have gathered, from many of those posting things like, "I literally roamed through 6 regions and saw nothing but gatecamps", that they have left null for low-sec, rather than highsec.
---
After the initial excitement about null going black, the resulting emptiness is .... boring for most players, and boredom cause players to leave corps or leave Eve.

Yes except the "try, fail, try again" method in Eve is expensive. Doing it for PvP would be okey because human makes mistakes, NPC do not and triglavians are clearly advertised as grouped PvE in the agency so he could try all over again, until we waste billions in ship to figure otu that maybe a blinged marauder can work is just going to end up in massive frustration.

---
you're thick as shit, you're the only pussy mate, you like the blackout because you like having no risk to your ganks. You hate the idea of an actual fight, because it just doesn't happen in null sec anymore because the blackout has made it too risky over the reward for krabs to try their luck outside of a handful of regions deep within in their super cap umbrellas so theres literally zero reason for subcap responses anymore meaning no subcap fleet fights, just cloaky bullshit ganking the occasional subcap ratter into wanting to quit and maybe if youre super lucky having a one on one with some other ganker trying the same thing.

If you are not flair baiting, just fit a cyno to your ratting domi/carrier or whatever it is you use. If you're on comms and call for help, people will drop to save you. Sure, you'll take losses, but thats EVE.
---
hows the psyop going or are you actually this salty.
---
War doesn’t work in a simple n+1 otherwise the Soviet Union wouldn’t have lost against Germany for the first 6 months of the war.
---
Logistics and tactics/strategy have a ton of influence on war.
---
I've had more actual fights since blackout then before.
---
The only issue is you consider a "actual fight" is dropping supercaps on the roaming frig.
---
You should probably go speak to a doctor or something dude
---
This would be the greatest buff
---
Jesus Christ your spelling.
---
Put down the vodka.
---
you will sit down in jail son
---
You have no idea if that ship on dscan is hostile or friendly, especially in providence. Also cloaky stuff is immune to dscan of course.
---
"majority" is that why every 10 minutes we have a thread about how terrible black out is?
---
cool way to completely miss the fucking point, I don't PVE I PVP, pre blackout I enjoyed roaming multiple regions with different scales from solo up to largish fleets, with content from ganks up to full on fleet fights, now the only choices are go to big bloc umbrellas, take something cloaky so you can sneak up on people but also be too shitfit to deal with a subcap response if one miraculously comes or have a cyno go up and get dropped on.  I don't give two shits about the safety of ratting until it gets to the point the vast majority of space is now fucking empty and content is at an all time low for anything other than ganks which get old real quick. fuck out of here with your assuming shit.
---
Yeah I’ve had some really dank fights like the other poster said in agreement.
---
I think that nullsec is finally understanding that they can’t just endlessly superfarm while they have one guy out of 200 sitting with an alt running near2 3 jumps down a pipe to get everyone to dock up.
---
Yep Rokh. highest cpu and 8 turret hardpoints
---
you're fucking retarded you didn't even pretend to read what I said did you.
---
The people that were not really willing to handle themselves in null left.
---
What kind of members are leaving?
---
What do they say they are going to do in HS?
---
I say count yourself lucky, the people that are not leaving because of local are the ones ready to put themselves out there for you and the corp.
---
psyop? having a different opinion to your tunnel vision approach to eve is a psyop now?
---
It’s still a return to the super easy and manipulated access to intel.
---
For fucks sake, it’s a single key on the keyboard you carebear lol
---
"weeks" ahahaah you're adorable
---
You want security you stay in HS. You want to build a corp for carebears you stay in HS.
---
"Unless you mine/rat/explo 12 hours a day, any single loss will set you back a long time." 
---
Not if you do DEDs. Also to your second point if you had limited hours to play why would you join a fucking corp that's not in the time? The only reason would be cause your a living tumor that just wants to make isk off their back.
---
Oh no those 5 bots per system in half of null aren't logging in eve is dying. We can't have anything to be salty about if they aren't here.
---
you wormholers are the single most disingenuous bullshitters I've ever come across
---
the problem is they are adapting
---
by leaving null and ceasing to be potential content for pvpers
---
&gt;To be honest everything else sounds like a whole bunch of welcome to fucking eve for the rest of us.
---
&gt;The rest of the game has been hostile as fucking balls for a decade. 
---
Even my points about not wanting to need a credit card to be able to partake in activities you enjoy? 
---
&gt;Welcome to eve, harden the fuck up.
---
I've played for a while now. Feeding kills to cloaky campers/ someone who will cyno in exponentially more people than you have available isn't hardening up. And I'd rather do literally anything else, given the choice.
---
Its reddit. Lol. Stay in ur hole.

\*vocal minority
---
Who?
---
Maybe you're right and it's the vocal minority that scream 'blackout is awesome because it made me re-sib my 1239503 accounts just for this. Fuck you and your whining you fucking PVE fagot'.
---
I look forward to the mass downvotes that will come out of this post.
---
this guy is hot shit, leaks from the horde main discord? disgusting!

"me being salty is fine but no one else is allowed to be salty about anything"

“Goonswarm”

“I’m used to having perfect intel and knowing exactly when I have the numerical advantage”

“Fleet fights don’t happen anymore because of blackout. It has nothing to do with the stagnant blue donut and the 220 keepstars we have to protect our hyper Jew space”
---
Triggered in null low and WH space, just not in HS
---
btw did they ever bring back the suspect timer for 4/5 abyssals in highsec?
---
There's also losec!
---
Nah just the constant thread about how blackout is terrible by null blocs nearly every 10 mins where it instantly gets upvoted and every dissenting view gets down voting within 2 mins of being posted.
---
It's funny because outside of shitty psyop threads that rarely happens.
---
Only 8 hours late as well
---
How many of that 20% were long time botters hanging it up when they realized local was gone for good? 
---
I’m going to guess a fucking lot
---
There are plenty of subcap fucks you mongrel maybe if you undocked you would find them. Big groups are having them small groups are having them log the fuck in and leave blue space.
---
Ouch, those are some nice implants you lost :/
---
Nothing I said could be considered bullshit in the slightest.
---
Unless you started post blackout, the 200 man Jew fleet being watched by a single guy watching local? Yeah 10000% true.
---
So instead of the North and North-East being blue, now it's the North-East and the East being blue.
---
It’s called fucking wormhole space bro. 
---
Do you know how many times I lost a ratting rattlesnake?  Fucking hilarious.
---
HARDEN THE FUCK UP
---
&gt;Not if you do DEDs.
---
True to an extent, however high level ded sites need skills, a pretty blinged ship, and you to know exactly what you're doing. There's a Reason many people sell them instead. You also have to rat to get the escalation, or buy the sites from someone selling them. 
---
&gt;Also to your second point if you had limited hours to play why would you join a fucking corp that's not in the time?
---
A big alliance would be better for a player with less time, but I was going off OP's wording, and his corp appears to be a smaller one. 
---
&gt;The only reason would be cause your a living tumor that just wants to make isk off their back.
---
I don't see how you'd make isk of the backs of others in as small corp/one that's not particularly active. Wouldn't that be easier in a big bloc?
---
Who’s salty in the slightest? I’m saying I want absolutely nothing with continuous dscan.
---
ccp just need remake non numbered complexes and some numbered and increase their showup chance. nullsec its not only green amons
---
May I also join you guys?
---
&gt;It’s called fucking wormhole space bro. 
---
This is a conversation about null bro. 
---
Not about wormholes. If OP and his corp wanted to be in a wormhole, he'd be talking about people leaving wormholes, not null. 
---
Most players aren't particularly interested in wormhole life. That's why they don't live in wormholes. 
---
&gt;HARDEN THE FUCK UP
---
This doesn't even apply to anything you just said
---
PL linemember "leaks" PH discord messages. What a time to be alive.
---
&gt;I think that nullsec is finally understanding that they can’t just endlessly superfarm while they have one guy out of 200 sitting with an alt running near2 3 jumps down a pipe to get everyone to dock up.
---
the fuck has this got to do with anything that I said, instead of arguing against my valid points you decide to strawman me and ignore all the problems because you don't want to admit that you want to race to rock bottom
---
You don't really need to be too blinged and 10/10s aren't really entry level but don't take 12 hours a day ratting to get back like said. There's also tons of videos watch one and you won't lose a ship.
---
Depends limited time in blocs can be bad don't you love those constant 4 hour fleets taht you get to log off during? if your hours are limited a smaller group that roams/ occasional fleet fight would be better. Plus even in a bloc a courp in the same tz would have more content around that time for you,
---
Yes it would be easier in a bloc.
---
Try it on your posting pls
---
Better solution could be letting you to open T4 and T5 only outside of higsec.                    
---
Without it people will just run them on deep spots or some desolated systems that no one cares to visit.
---
theres shit all of them, I have undocked, the amount of subcap fights going on is down massively on what there was just a couple of months back, space is the emptiest its been in fucking years, the subcap fights are happening, again with the making shit up " log the fuck in and leave blue space. " it's almost like I do nothing but PVP and have spent years going out and finding content and can see with my own eyes its fucking dying. biomass
---
Oh great, another “boohoo blackout is bad I never actually learned how to play this game and should have never left highsec has finally caught up to me”.
---
Blackout was an update that was 16 years overdue.
---
you mean like the nearly every 10 minute posts of wormholers saying thanks to the blackout i can now do this same thing i was doing before the blackout htfu stoopid null krabs
---
oh look another strawman
---
It's not as often but there are a few a day. But I see a lot less of them while I refresh the new tab.
---
When people ask me why I do the work I do, I say I enjoy the financial security, union benefits, and hardcore schedule stability that a government job provides me.
---
In reality, wanting to have stable free time to devote to EVE was 90% of the reason I'm working the job I am.
---
Doesn't hurt that I do enjoy it tho.
---
Could be iron deficiency
---
Hi there! 
---
Weighing in from a fellow small alliance perspective (that is thriving in Blackout). Here some practical tips:
---
1) Don't take more space than you need &amp; will actively use (shocking!)
---
2) Shift your ISK generation to DED sites, if nullsec is half as empty as you suggest it is, these should be available left right &amp; center with the implied ISK value of running these sites going up as less people do them &amp; everyone is feeding shiny shit to blackout (supposedly). 
---
2.1) Farm up one a-type invuln or 3-5 shitty sites and use it to sub AFK eyes on your first DED gate in case of extreme krabbing-paranoia. 
---
3) Shift AFK ratting to dead-end pockets, put eyes a few gates out, drop a few bait Gila's in there (stab/points) &amp; punish any small gang that comes through to the point your KB in that system looks like everything is bait.
---
Hope that helps!
---
If you were finding content before it's amazing how you can't find ANY now.
---
Tbh people are leaving the game more than moving to higsec.
---
I’m sold who do I speak to about joining in on some of that action.
---
Hmm, would it be hard to train a chatbot to do this? We have mining bots, we have ratting bots, maybe it's time for scamming bots.

The point about wormholes was saying that people existed playing a game where they had to take risks to earn money and live in their space, despite serious multiple repeated deaths, and still play and enjoy the game without having to credit card warrior.

Rorqs industrial mode with two drone navigation computers in the mids.

So fast that if you recall them you might have to abandon them cuz they orbit too wide from the speed.

Or switch out the drone speed mids.. cuz you should also have your mobile depo up.

This is one of the most drama-free and useful posts I've seen about dealing with Blackout.  Thank you.
---
And what are you valid points mr Methheads?
---
lmao it's died down a bit of late, but let's be honest it's because a lot of the folk posting them are starting to realise what a mistake they made backing it in the first place.
---
narrative is straight, it's just relative in regards to what area on the EVE map it's discussing :P
---
I don't know where your roaming but I'm finding content consistently and doesn't take too long every now and then I might go abit without seeing someone but that's usually cause im hunting poorly at the time.

Old tactic : divided people to better reign.

He means one sided blobs where he can dunk without having to worry one bit about risk.
---
Honest question, do you enjoy spamming that single key?
---
Personally I find it absolutely fucking tedious, and it adds nothing of value to my gameplay. Any activity that was dull before is now mind numbing.
---
because they straight up removed everything bar the smallest of gang which newsflash gets fucking boring quick and ganking which also gets boring as quick, theres no subcap responses to fight, theres no provoking subcap responses, theres only get in kill something or run away or feed trying. it's really simple.
---
&gt;Providence is hemriging right now it's a real shame.
---
Firstly, the little squiggly red line means you spelled a word wrong and maybe even so insanely wrong it seems possible you've never read a book.
---
Secondly, *good*.
---
It’s seems to have gone back a bit to how it was you didn’t get people spread out in 0.0 when I first started playing there was gaps in sov and most people stayed fair close to the hq system for defence. 
---
So hopefully it will allow more corps to come in and take Sov
---
that Gobbins... he's a real emotional roller coaster isn't he
---
False.  The game stays at a steady 20-25k players online at all times for years.
---
HOW DARE YOU! CALDARI STATE ARE THE GOOD GUYS OF THE NEW EDEN !!!!11111ONEONEoneone
---
Of course I don’t but I also understand that a game needs to have balance. When you undock in space you pilot your craft. It’s not an Afk farming boat that you can just turn on to watch your wallet go up in safety.
---
You gotta work for your safety. You don’t have to press that button, but it makes you more at risk when you don’t.
---
That’s your choice :D
---
&gt;I also believe that the gates between systems should be maintained by the owners of the systems and even be destroyed leaving isolated areas.
---
I too hate making PVP accessible for anyone other than the risk-averse coalitions that won't deploy a frigate because it'll escalate into super-capital suicide if they're outnumbered.
---
PL is in Horde now... or is that your joke?
---
It's sad how those blobs don't know how to scout.
---
I actually like that idea because then if roaming wormholers or lowsec nerds see the abyssal shard they’ll be camping for you
---
so I could go to just about any region at pretty much any time of day and provoke some sort of fight, now there is the null bloc space only and under their super cap umbrella, not much else really, dunno about you but fighting only horde gets boring quick. I wish I was as simple minded as you so that I could be like "hurr hurr i done killed a myrmidon am elite am gone do this over and over forever hurr hurr" but unfortunately I like having a range of things to do
---
Put up a corporation add. Accept literally anyone. Log on at the same time of the day.  Never not be on comms. Encourage others to do the same.
---
Do T4/5 abyssal sites give a suspect timer in high sec?
---
Not many players (none?) would even undock for this amount of money. You're pretty safe mate ;)

You leave me and my plusses alone!

Avenger18? What the fuck?
---
Little story. This guy was my first CEO and got me into eve online. He was just a little older than I was at the time (about 13 14 maybe) and owned his own corporation. He convinced me to get it, so I saved up my pocket money and got it.
---
After following him around and salvaging his level four missions , I finally managed to buy my own Armageddon. I couldn't use the turrets, and could only fly the hull, but 14 year old me was proud and happy.
---
Avenger18 then proceeded to pop me outside of station while in corp.
---
He also like bringing his laptop Into the bathroom, and playing guitar while in the bath on Comms. Weird guy.
---
Nope
---
lmao i know right, mining in EVE is about like reading a StainGuy post compilation
---
probably none you idiot, bot's can probably rat safer in nullsec now than players because they can spam dscan without fail and respond to something on dscan in milliseconds, yeah some will get caught for sure, but then they were getting caught already so whats the difference?
---
anyone thinking bot's are gone, are idiots, their just doing something different.
---
&gt;The point about wormholes was saying that people existed playing a game where they had to take risks to earn money and live in their space, despite serious multiple repeated deaths
---
But the rewards are exponentially higher in wormholes than in null, enough to generally make the risk worth it. Escalations and (occasionally) exploration are about the only cases of high reward for subcaps in null.
---
When i played this WE it was 18k. So low compare to 2 month ago. Bo make people leave the game. The idea of game designer is good but the player reaction to it is bad.
---
I don't know, actually. I don't think I've been in an incursion system but once or twice, and only while I was in a fleet rolling through. Exploration and general krabbing are quite lucrative, though.
---
Trigger Happy Is Recruiting.
---
For sure. My grandfather has that issue due to his COPD.
---
So this scammer made 25 mil in 40 mins? Those are pretty useless ticks.. Pity you didn't send him all your isk. You could have made his day.
---
That’s horseshit.
---
Smart bombing Mach’s, bling rattlesnakes, hulks, etc all earn fantastic amounts of money in nullsec with ZERO risk compared to wormhole isk.  Especially when you can just log in and warp right to a site provides no Reds in local vs the scanning rolling and bookmarking involved in wormhole space.

(Written in the context of pre blackout)

This reads like stone age prose.

Horde? Well just be patient.

Didn't expect this words from you.

Now something from my back yard ... they are not moving to higsec, they are quitting.             
---
I have separate alts for higsec piracy ... and i am running out out of targets.           
---
My "focus group" is nullsec people hauling stuff in dumb way - and since blackout this flock died out.               
---
Like .....

---
* lvl 4 missions ^(nope not here)            
---
* higsec mining ^(again no, unless they made new chars and mining in retrievers now)          
---
* DED running in higsec ^(again no)            
---
* Abyssals ... well this is before me, but i guess no as i could see some of those people operating already.
---
It is the best worse game. Ever since I started playing back in '07, I tried to quit at least 5 times a year and yet, here I am. I have never had a game that I have been playing for this long.
---
Mining is *not* interesting. The only things that can happen are:
---
* Your ORE hold is full (the *horror*)
---
* The asteroid is depleted (the ***HORROR***)
---
* a NPC shows up (this usually translates to some bonus isk, unless it's a capital or something)
---
* a player shows up (the only thing that can actually stop you from mining for a while)
---
Mining is interesting in the same way driving to work is interesting because you *might* get into a car accident.

Look at the 3m charts. There is no more or less players in the 1 month of blackout than any other date in time. There is no dramatic spike/despike. Saying massive people are leaving the game is just statistically false.
---
Hey bud, cloaked ships don't show up on dscan. Dscan also doesn't tell bots if a ship is friendly or hostile. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
Hi there! so you wanna be a CrIMiNUl ScUM.  
---
*You've come to the right place!*
---
I've been a Nasty-Wasty-Criminul-Pasty before, and it really is a fun way to live! You've gotta remember some points though!
---
1. You're going to be using criminal life to generate isk, so you need to not only be isk efficient, but you have to *keel* enough to make a profit of what the *loot fairy giveth.* So you need to focus on strategy that will provide you that efficiency. We're talking, Gatecamping ^((setting traps along high traffic areas)) Ganking! ^((Killing defenseless ships quick!)) and only choosing engagements that you can win! People will call you risk averse! and a coward, *but they don't know just how to be as efficient as you!*
---
2. You're going to be a wanted criminal! This means High-security space will be off limits to you for anything bar quick travel gate to gate. Prepare for this! Take in all the stuff you think you're going to need ^((Be careful, other criminals are out to take this from you! as you transport it)) Or get someone else to move it for you.  
---
You may also need one of your 3 Character slots as a dedicated Goodie-goodie, who can enter Highsec for you and do all your shopping, and blow kisses to the Police as you swagger on through to trade-hubs
---
3. You're going to need some BACKGROUND INFORMATION and experience!  
---
**Join a Faction-Warfare corp out in Lowsec as your first Corp** and don't immediately go pirate first! They'll teach you good basics of PvP in a lowsec environment, and potentially you'll get to know a lowsec area like the back of your hand, you'll get a good setup of where you can live in that area, and will give you the perfect stepping stone to get into that sweet, sweet CrIMninUL lifestyle.
---
I'm sure folks will give you good or better advice than me! But that's how I'd do it if I had to all over again. You could even just find a pirate or criminal corp! instead of FW, but FW groups might be more accommodating, and have better teachers available to give you tips on the game
---
I'm Paxom in game! by the way, if you ever get stuck or have questions, throw me a mail! I'm certainly not an encyclopedia on the game but I'll do my best to help :D
---
Just wanted to add this.
---
Prices on ded loot is going up because of the surge in abyssals and people rolling on c-a type mods
---
We can't be arsed running plexes or chasing bots... Warzone is stable, Getting some good fights, drinking beer killing Amarrians, alls good.
---
Upvoting for visibility. It's definitely a discussion that should be taking place. There are tons of pros and cons to blackout. As someone in a busy PvP part of EvE, I can't say there is more or less content under blackout, but I can say there are much more losses all around. Even big alliances are losing some players to high-sec. Not large numbers but with the blackout it's basically impossible for a newer player with low skills and still low on the massive learning curve to make any type of isk to sustain in null. 
---
I can see how this could impact smaller corps, but I think the issue is with recruiting. A smaller corp is more likely to recruit friends to play who have never played before and many new players recruited from high-sec to immediately leap down to null as early as possible. I think it's a major mistake. A brand new player should spend time in high-sec learning the very basic game mechanics and skills like targeting, aligning and warping, basically learn to crawl/walk before you learn to run. 
---
If it is such a problem then maybe low-sec is better for your corp to thrive. There is no blackout in low-sec so you can afk crab till your heart's content.
---
I would say for your first move, be an adorable newbie and join a corp with other newbies. Convince the CEO of the corp to let you help run the corp etc. Once you have access to corp wallets and hangars, just take everything. 
---
That should get you some starting money. You can then look at can flipping other miners in highsec, if they aggress you can ransom them and kill them anyway after they pay. Or do the same to mission runners.  
---
Doing scam hauling contracts is also quite a thing. There are quite a lot of things you can do, just be creative about it.
---
They are also being setup with a toon on each gate to flag the ratters or miners into warp, but like I said, the bot's are safer than the players right now, setting up eyes on gates with 24/7 vision and instant reflex is just SOP for them.
---
But yeah, some will die. I would argue more players will do tho, so like I said, safer for bots.
---
Accounts != players.        
---
I think you fill find Elo on some podcast stating that that people in his corp alone have 1000-2000 accounts running skill farms.         
---
Problem is that we are losing real players and gaining alt accounts.        
---
If you have 30 accounts you will not play on 30 at the same time, usually you are undocked on 2-3 ... but 20 people will have at least 20 accounts undocked and doing various things.
---
What he says is true and doable; Google doesn't do because it would reduce their income.
---
Yeah - i found some guys to fly yesterday.   So much fun!   Anyone can recommend a good FE Corp flying for mimatar?
---
The in-game channel is mostly dead, unless I'm out of the loop and there's a new hangout spot.

---
FRT leaving Eve online to play Eve mobile?
---
I've just picked the game back up after ~4 years of being offline. I used to play casually, mostly lowsec ratting and exploration. I have my old Vexor and ~200M ISK, how do I ease myself back into the game? I can barely remember fitting meta, and need to train myself back up. I consider myself no more than a rich newb.
---
Also, what good newbie corps are still active? Is EVEUni still a fun place to be?
---
Bot can still operate, but no longer can they use their scripts to warp off immediately when a neut enters system. I think that was the one of the straws that made CCP pull the trigger on a long begged for mechanic of removing local.
---
&lt;3

Please don't taint this promising young new player with your highsec pleb game style.

A few of the  were particularly entertained with how tough and determined you guys were (*who ever was with the FXR group*). French Connection literally defended their space more effectively than the entirety of the GOTG coalition - u/oodell can confirm this. Eventually you guys were impressive enough for everyone to just go "*lmao let's just leave those dudes alone and continue on with the main objective*".
---
*Note that my memory of this may not be entirely accurate.*
---
&gt;So, technically "criminal" is a status, not a job in Eve Online.
---
Yes, "criminal" is a crimewatch flag in developer lingo, but we all know what OP means, and there *absolutely* are villainous playstyles.
---
Go get some paint and a brush to "target paint him"
---
Is there anyway to search refineries by region/constellation?

Nice
---
Everyone who still does this stuff drifted over to the minerbumping channel, because it is more active.

WOW DOZENS OF ISK!!! GRATS
---
TBF, Leaving the game might also include them moving to low sec or something.
---
meh ofc solo pvp isn't dead. It never was....... The fact people keep saying "solo pvp is dead" or "bringing back solo pvp" is a stale meme at this point.
---
Providence.  Oh well.  At least it's not someone that actually matters.

oh thank god null is more blue again /s
---
&gt;(Written in the context of pre blackout)
---
I'm referring to the risk/reward now. Not in the past. Also since when did a hulk make a fantastic amount of money??
---
BU is pretty much dead but a handful of players and a lot of techniques live on in the code community
---
Just look for people who do more than log on for pinged free talos gank ops
---
upvultured
---
are you assuming, im not presuming? where is your evidence?
---
Dont do it, there are already enough corps that are shit out there. Try to find one of the decent ones, be willing to commit some time for the team and climb up the ranks. One day you might find yourself as a CEO of a corp, at least then you know that you know what you're doing.
---
Unironically a good post.
---
You have earned your upvote
---
First dont build a structure. There are tons of them out there that offer very low taxes and keeping them fuled as a new corp is either difficult or expensive, usually both. 
---
Like the other guy said. Put up ad, accept anyone and everyone, always be on coms and try to make sure your corpies are to. 
---
I'll add provide ships. Now as a new corp this can be hard for you cuz the isk for these ships comes straight from your pocket but depending on where you are located people might not like running out to the nearest trade hub to hual there own shit out. So have lots of extra ships on hand and sell them to your corpies cheap or give them out for free. I keep a bunch of cheap fitted ships in an open access hanger and they are all kept insured. My dudes can grab what they need and go lose whatever they want and I always get a little back from it. It costs me a lot but I make that sacrifice for my guys. 
---
I'll think of more but I gotta run into work. Good luck
---
But hes only presenting one aspect. Doing DED sites in null was never restricted to SOV owners and you dont even need a corp or alliance to do it. The issue starts when you want to start becoming a real power in which youre gonna need bigger toys and an industry wing to build it. Thats when the fun stops.
---
The issue was never about grabbing SOV, especially if nobody else wants it, but to actually be able to use said SOV to grow. Doing things that you dont need an corp/alliance or SOV to do doesnt really fit into it. And btw, scannable DED sites are rare, no way you can sustain any larger group with them.
---
Hooooo-lee shit did you drink the koolaid concentrate instead?
---
I dont get it, someone care to explain?
---
its dead for those who cant fit an AT ship tho BAZINGA
---
Yayyyy... more blue status...
---
The reason it's so shit is because of Rorquals and Spodumain. Those two things have devalued ore a huge amount. The ridiculous amount of ore Rorqs could mine for the last few years made it an ISK printer and flooded the market with cheap ore. 
---
Whoever came up with Spodumain needs to be slapped, extra hard, in the face. It completely upended the market. The amount of minerals you can get from reprocessing Spodumain makes almost every other ore, besides the nullsec exclusive ores, pale in comparison. 
---
Those were some very bad game design decisions and I can only hope that equally bad ideas have left with the Devs that have departed over the last couple of years.
---
Naaaah m8, I’m a poor boi and am trying to get some ISK while I study.
---
Go for TP and Missiles.
---
The Rattlesnake is a ship i have seen often
---
And try passive fits
---
Same.
---
It would wind up like every other game of NSC2 Stellaris... Someone (me usually...) rushes tech research for megastructures, builds hyperlane modifiers, and isolates his pocket, then uses that to maxi-krab and build tall until jump drives become a thing...
---
its hurting the smaller, less experianced 'shouldnt be there anyway lucky to of ever been there atall' types
---
Not really, my go to is the gnosis atm and considering its isk value it is doing great :)
---
BLASTED what a roast
---
I sold my half my penis for 500 plex once. Now I’m just average length.
---
You realise this is why people had issues with the login events right? Cause the login counter literally means shit right about now.
---
You blacklist the script tag but HTML is non regular so you would have to parse the entire content body.
---
And maybe the allow some JavaScript for timed events or hover events? Then you would need to control the JavaScript and that just isn't possible. The JavaScript API doesn't provide a way to do that and even if it did there are ways to hack around stuff like that.
---
Personally I don't know much about how ad contents work or are submitted so it is hard to speculate. Do you have some understanding or are you just speculating blindly?
---
We are most likely not even gaining alt accounts but instead bots. For every 1 NS bot you prob need about 2-3 in HS. Im fairly certain real players have fallen off real hard but the login events and HS bots are masking it.
---
Is my pale Dave Dave archer?
---
It's not always spoopy behind the scenes stuff, sometimes it's just salt eh
---
And a little bit of their PVE history! *giggles*
---
I remember GOTG forming megathron fleet to defend our main fortizar.
---
They just went to watch imperium reinforcing it without firing a single shot while we were still trying to fight some random fleet that we couldn't win against.
---
Sadly imperium finally evicted us. Rough time followed leading to split of the alliance loosing many good PvP members who created "Toilet Paper"
---
Anyway FXR is still alive and will always pick a fight if you come over at the right hours!
---
Yep. However, you must be careful - hands have been lost for the acts of mere men
---
solo pvp got harder, or the common area moved and you stayed still... nothing more :)
---
Remember as the CEO, you are responsible for your players content and entertainment.  If it's yet another "we kinda do everything" corp, don't bother.
---
im not in FRT, id shoot it, TEST pay pirat to help protect thier hisec shit.... whos paying who what now?
---
My ROAST of tuttut has nothing to do with u
---
What's going on? I scanned all the sigs in 7 systems and they were all combat sites? 20+ combat sites! I get the urge to do some hacking and wormhole mapping and ALL combat sites. WTF?
---
Do they use the mods  after rolling or they just all hope to get that maxed maxed mod that they think will sell for 10b?
---
 started in 2015 and played 800 hours in less than 3 months. Addiction continued for years. Things started slowly slowing down after citadels and then even more once the injector spam became crazy. Nowadays not to much of an addiction more so a burden that I really enjoy very rarely.
---
NPC/nomadic nullseccer here, having an absolute blast with blackout. Krabs are sad because there's actually some risk in krabbing now whereas before you could just AFK on 10 VNI alts while watching PornHub and still probably not die because of near2.
---
yeh, dont worry, let it get to 100billion, and still dont worry, bounty hunting is not an active profession.
---
Saitek X-45 and then a Thrustmaster Topgun Force Feedback Pro. Haven't used either one in ages.
---
Probably because the krabs downvote them all into oblivion.
---
yeah what the hell Gideon way to go off the rails...... jeez
---
And this is what people have been saying will happen. But nerfing stuff isnt going to fix the issue. Boosting isk wont either. The blackout in its current iteration is shit and to balance it you need to break other things, thats not good game development.
---
And as long as people dont think its good then it really doesnt matter what one side belives, people will still not stay in NS and the problem will persist.
---
Also, all those "people" you are seeing. How much you wanna bet those are bots? Cause a lot of real players are leaving the game all together, I can see that in the market as people are in much higher volumes than usual  selling off their doctrine stuff. You dont do that just to go to HS for abyssals.
---
Daddy PL had words with Gobbins I see.
---
New players can do exploration for up to 120m/h. Seems pretty decent, but you cant bot it of course
---
The one I'd like to know is accessing the cargo.
---
Can I relaps a freighter/bowhead/carrier to alpha, never docking, and using it to store stuff? Then moving using gates/wormhole?
---
I mean, it could be an alternative to live a nomaden structureless eve live.
---
Provi has given EVE pretty much 15 years of content and fun fights. For that to be replaced by another nullblob with 200 supers would not be good for the game.
---
"Fantastic". No they dont. Dude, I live in null, I know how much you can make and its no where near fantastic levels. Especially not with subs.
---
Totally agree with that. Just go to nullsec to see that it s more empty than 2 month ago.
---
I kind of liked the ingame browser.. it was useful for siggy!
---
But Holland is well known for the quality on their dams and their love of Bicycles. Why wouldcthat co cern your Grandmother.
---
And how was she familiat with the site?
---
Thanks. For someone reason I'd closed that channel. I'm back. :)
---
DEDs dont fall out of the sky. The scannable ones are really rare and the change of actually finding one and being able to run it before anyone else is marginal. They mostly come from escalations and well, you can find the issue here cant you?
---
Maybe that was true some years ago, but in my experience, Provi has been more interested in forcing PvPers out of their space so that they can go back to ratting, than providing actual content.  Any small gang that goes there these days will have to fight a 40 man Munnin fleet with 5 Scimis if they spend more than 20 minutes roaming.  And if you are going there solo fml...  Expect a 12 man gate camp on the way back home if you're lucky enough to dodge the response fleet.
---
Meta was hurricanes, hurricane got nerfed so ferox was meta, ADC got released so Eagle was meta as it was basicly ferox with ADC, munins got used cos good vs eagles (resistance profile) and the world goes on
---
why you won't adapt? did you consider moving to wh\\low as an option?  if your a small corp , i don't see a problem at all.
---
Not sure why hasn't anybody told you this: 
---
Get your core skills to 5 or at least 4 before thinking about flying a T3C, Magic 14, look it up.
---
If you have a 3mo old toon, chances are most of your skills are crap, which will gimp HARD any T3C.
---
If you insist, don't even think about flying a T3C without all subs in 5, dps and tank WILL sufer without them.
---
Keep flying your Stratios in the meantime, it will give you the experience to fly a T3C and won't have you losing any SP as a T3C will.
---
Yes, train for a Loki or Tengu, both of them are good, if you like Amarr, train for a Legion, some people say Legion is good for backpacking and yeah  not sure what this "Proteus" thing is.
---
T3Cs are very nice ships in general, and it feels real good to put your ass in one, but I still suggest to not burn your injectors before some serious theorycrafting and pyfaing.
---
Fly dangerous!
---
Have you listened to the pod? I mean really listened and been objective? Cause if you missed that part then man.
---
solo pvp right now outside of fw involves farming nullblock idiots who dont know what the fuck they are flying
---
For minor conduits you a min of 3 ships. Vindicator with webs for the small stuff, leshak for the bigger stuff and Nestor to heal them both to keep everyone alive. So as the others said....get freinds.
---
lol red alliance
---
Will abyssal loot eventually start to tank with such a large influx of people doing it? Seems like it could be a self correcting problem.
---
Did provi lose? Because that would be par for the course.
---
Taking SOV isnt an issue, being able to use it to grow is.
---
goons used mega's (baltec's) against panfam eagles and munins, they got smashed to pieces even though goons had number advantage, no supers on grid, just subcaps. battleships just dont move
---
Except right now big Alliances are already turning away from Zkill due to the temp blackout and the 2 hours delay.
---
If zkill ontop of that start forcing ads onto an already reduced service people will just start going elsewhere for more complete info without the ads.
---
Fot C1 combatsites you can train into t3 destroyers.
---
Takes like a week or two and they can be used in PvP too.
---
Battlecruisers are too fat, too slow and not fit for PvP at the same time imo.
---
Agreed re: LS/WH.  No, they never brought back the timer.  That alone would make it worthwhile doing in null - run them under your umbrella or risk the easy gank.
---
I lived in wormholes most of my Eve career.  I've had my playstyle nerfed and referred to as "collateral damage."  Sorry, not sorry that your precious blue donut of safety got tinkered with.  HTFU.
---
Also no one farm = less DED to sells = no DED except unrated but its escalation is the real pain, especially if they appeared in border zones.
---
 Small renter corps suffered the most, not only we don’t have supercap umbrela but also less people onl in the alliance to alarm about neutral attacks. You cannot believe how many people still onl in the alliance right now, before BO Alliance channel has &gt; 1000 people at the bottom, now is about 100-200 max, trade channel from 200-500 and usually 10/10 DED now about 10-30 member and they are selling POS structure, supercapital ships, fuel blocks and PI goods. There is a corp want to sell their  moon to us (we are still debating because mining in BO is the pain on the ass and we only have Orca).  Intel channel from hundreds to 20 people and you can guess a lot of gank fleets infirtrate eithout be spotted. There is a Titan want to supercapital solo pvp like Eskern Ladder so he travel through half of the constellation before be spotted, our Orca nearly dead because no one online to spot it and when the one who charge in gate spot them, they jump gate and instant warp to near the Orca, luckily we store pvp ship in Athanor and they don’t have HIC or bubbles so they retreat but our mining time for that day is done.
---
I see a big drop of more than 10%
---
In may all the peak was more than 30k. Now we have also just few peak at 30k... the difference is big, how you dont see that?
---
Taking into account that 3 bot in hs = 1 bot in NS,and there is the SP event the loss of real player is huge.
---
Hilmar and plummeting player numbers?
---
Good to see gobbinerino still around
---
\-ck11
---
Skill farms are pretty much never online, so not sure what they got to do with online numbers.
---
some people's kids i tell ya
---
The problem here is that NS has been the one keeping newplayer retention up for years. So making it harder for new players to enter the place thats been taking care of them will result in what?
---
I can promise you that with a fully implemented blackout the retention numbers will drop hard. People dont join Eve so they can learn alignment in HS or gatecamp in LS. Most join because they wanna be in big fights and see shiny ships and perhaps someday sit in one. Raising the bar for them to do just that will hurt the game in a massive way.
---
It's dead, Jim
---
Yeah my bad I read this at 4am
---
How do you think that “more” corps will take sov in reality when they are actually leaving as evident by the expanding emptiness.  They won’t be able to sustain the PVE required to maintain.
---
restart restart restart....
---
Botters quitting. Luuuuuul.
---
A simple fix would be for it to have pre-nerf ECM mechanics
---
To my understanding: Goons, Test and PH formed up in 1 team for a fleet to destroy some lowsec structure to protect their station trading interests.  Frat formed against PH with some other smaller groups. 
---
PH set frat to neutral for the weekend because of it and blued them again.
---
It is clear to see that your space in Tribute has almost no PvP going on. Come again and share your opinion when you have been overfished ;)
---
It's already been tanking since release and especially since the removal of t4/5 suspect timers.  There had been no bottom found on pricing for most abyssal items with exception I think of crystalized isogen but I suspect that it will go lower soon.  I've been watching the abyssal products for a while.
---
Yeah if I had to guess here. Looks like he made an alt and for a week fed it to this Avenger guy for a week in a venture. And then he switched it up to a nemesis and somehow got him to bite on it, then scram, web, cyno and rest you see on zkill.
---
Lol. Dude hahaha. You do realise they eventually won the war with n+1 right? Becuse for every Tiger tank they had what, 15 T34s or something like that?
---
Go to sisi and test it out. No need to ruin yourself when sisi is a thing where everything costs 100 isk.
---
Pretty sure PL aint the daddy in that relationship anymore.
---
This nailed it. I'm in a small (20ish warm bodies) null-sec corp. I live in sov-null and we have no supercap umbrella. Currently there's no point in ratting or mining since the expectation value of the activity is negative. I like the PvP but eventually I'll either run out of ISK for ships or need to move my ISK-making to HS/LS, in which case I might as well move there completely and just do roams for PvP. Having my assets in sov-null (vs. having them in HS/LS npc stations) means added risk to lose them and since I can't earn ISK here I'm getting nothing in return.
---
It is my iPhone. I 1% lasts about 40 minutes.
---
i was an extinction fisher in my early days. back before it was declared bannable i used to can bait day old newbros in starter systems, smartbomb camp in lowsec, and even farmed brave newbies in barleguet
---
i like pvp players more than i like pve players but there's a balance to be maintained and the blackout has way overshot it. the sooner everyone realizes what a hell we've created for our favorite prey, the sooner we can get back to reason and balance
---
Almost good tips from you.   
---
But I must point that DED sites spawn in current null sov was hit by blackout too. Before blackout. sov holders and renters spend billions of isk to install ihub upgrades called Entrapment Arrays. They boosted DED spawn rate, but to work correctly they needed military ADM at lvl5 \[best spawn rate was if your constellation was fully upgraded and all systems had lvl5 military index\]. I upgraded half of the region with those just to check their impact.  
---
You get DED sites too as escalations from Combat anoms, but to do that you need to farm pretty hard. If you running Rally Points for Atypes, you need low level security system with ihub military upgrades at lvl3 minimum. If you run rally points for 2-3h day, in current state of null, you will became nice red target point on Dotlan. So good luck farming Rally Points with 4 cloaked Lokis on your site ;-)  
---
Overall farming for DED sites is 10 times more dangerous, and usually not worth it \[unless you use AFK Myrmidion, and just feed them to "hunters"\]. And providing infrastructure and keeping ADMs up for Entrapment Arrays to be effective is impossible for small alliances now.  
---
You can still explore null and try to find naturally spawned DED sites, but last night after roaming thru 40+ systems and scanning every sig i just gave up. I found 2x 6/10 both occupied, one with Sin+Tengu, second with blue guys.  
---
Still I wish you good luck with your null "adventure"  
---
o7
---
Highsec corp? Hurt by the *nullsec* blackout? What are you losing members to, them leaving for greener pastures?
---
10/10 DED require rat anom to get. For example Drone squad and above gives you 10/10 DED but in some cases you need 12h continously ratting to get. And when I got it the location is on ... enemy territory, super far long from the location of DED ships, system with no station or they do not allow me to dock, or worse is Sansha incursion. DES trade channel is the bigger battle than a bunch of supercapitals foght together, it is battle between players who only want to get enough DED run for omega and a tons of BOTS
---
I enjoy blackout thoroughly while hunting solo/pvping. Really adds to when you earn kills, all the info you get has to be done by you.
---
That said - big reason it sucks is because it takes away from what a lot of people play eve to do - get into big ships and blow stuff (rats) up. 
---
It's not about having ways to counter it, I know I won't die when I'm fullspeed aligned in my blingy phoon doing a haven, but the game is just less fun when I have to be dscanning every 3 seconds and looking at overview instead of just shooting shit and having fun.
---
wormholes were a mistake and should be deleted
---
I hard reset y how and have tried on other devices, it only happens on zkill so it seems to be a website issue.
---
I took in so much irony from your post, now it hurts when I pee.
---
idiot
---
PHhhhhhht.  BUll shit.  EVE IS DEAD.  [SMALL GANG AND NANO?SOLO PVP IS DEAD!!!!!](https://zkillboard.com/character/91882592/)  /s
---
Remember to leave rigs out too.
---
Damn you stole my idea
---
&gt; SOV fappening
---
This is my new favourite expression lol.
---
Because logged in = active
---
The same way that saying anything the feeble minded don't want to hear = downvotes
---
fack of retart
---
You're right. But you cant change that.  Its /eve
---
Quit being a troll you moron.
---
Even when you use that browser? The site works fine for me.
---
Tbf, Provi will have to change their model and become more like other null-sec blocks if they want to stay  in Provi.   Otherwise, Provi will become a wasteland, APOC, CVA and others will soon crumble and small groups will take their place.  Yes, blackout has hurt small corps and alliances and hurt Provi most of all.  The NRDS cannot survive if Provi members can't see who's red in local.
---
Imagen having only 7 mid slots. CCP please buff the Chameleon
---
No its Paldave, infamous badposter
---
Thanks! and what is the deal with that? Whats so special about them having been set to neutral and then to blue?
---
That message stresses me then testing new code
---
Was about to not read that, and downvote and call you names ... but then I saw circlejerk and got sucked in ... good read!
---
But yeah, you're in the wrong place if you're looking for feelings in the community.
---
Fw solo there are ppl who know stuff.
---
In null sec they need to anchor or get orders to fight others.
---
So they kbow they cant 1v1 you so bring a hardcounter or like the whole ally
---
The level of anonymity will always allow people to respond that way unless moderation kicks up to an unreasonable amount.
---
Join public fleets or NPSI channels in game like "THe Bombers Bar" or Spectre Fleet. ANd what is your ingame name so people can convo or email you
---
That really sux man. Any group that wants any real sustainability and growth in NS will suffer hard, the smaller the harder. I really hope they stop this cause today you are renters, tomorrow maybe a large power.
---
Man up and stop living in your wormhole with it's controlled access points, and then we'll talk.
---
logged in = logged in. The count hasn't dramatically decreased the past month of blackout. If they were actually leaving the game, you'd say a sharp decrease in the number of players on charts.
---
I believe you can search for nearby facilities under the industrial tab. Might be limited to your system only, not entierly sure. Try:)
---
Neutral: You can shoot them if you want, but we're not actively campaigning against them
---
Blue: They're our friends, do not shoot them
---
Most def. I mean, just looking at dotlan will show that ADMs have dropped superhard. Thats certainly not because people are enjoying the blackout.
---
Are you not in Imperium anymore?
---
Wut?
---
In fairness I am sure your English is better than I am in your native tongue, but a bit of parsing would help.
---
Honeslty though I think that if your alliance channel has &gt; 1000 people you don't qualify as a small corp.  And if it is still 100-200 then you should be able to farm null in "relative" safety (meaning your income from null farming more than makes up for the occasional times someone can pierce the defense of an alliance with a couple of hundred toons in channel. )
---
Let's try this explanation: because they used to be buddies, then they went over to not being buddies, then back to being buddies.
---
So PH set feat to neutral while they were sweeping some of their structures and set them to friends again after they were done?
---
Can't adapt when the only counter play is to fee random npc level pvp players who put down their bag of cheetos to bomb you and/or attack and then return to the safety of their safe space. All the while killing whatever you had out before any mention of reinforcements could arrive to help.
---
Gobbins just showing everybody who is boss: 
---
1.) Yo guys, FRT neut as of now...
---
2.) FRT comes crying and begging, promising stuff (behind closed doors) (probably...)
---
3.) 2 days later FRT blue again...
---
4.) Profit! (for Gobbins)
---
Soo.. Gobbins is now "the Mittani of the East" ?
---
Or, even easier than that.
---
Bring an ecm ship, apply jams,
---
Get primaried and alphaed.
---
Why don't you move to high sec? It sounds like most of your group prefers low-to-no-risk PVE with occasional PVP on their schedules; you can have that if you live in high-security space and organize roams. It's not some badge of dishonor to go live in the space that best fits your play style.
---
If you want to stay in null, it's easy enough to keep losses down to a minimum and still have fun - get everyone to buy in to flying cheap, PVP-fit Myrms or Domis or Praxii (?) in a single system while on comms in sites that yield escalations. The green sites don't make money, but do generate some fun PVP, and hopping in a Tengu to do those escalations means you're making excellent money via ratting overall. Mine in proc/porpoise ball - with a critical mass, they will nuke random gankers and require an actual small fleet to kill; with an athanor on grid, more than that.
---
click scan and click scan
---
So it was some kind of "im gonns destroy your things and for that time we wont be friends, but when im done we can be friends again" ??
---
For a really new person that just started the game and finished the tutorial the isk he gets from hopping into a venture and filling the ore hold once or twice is nothing to sneeze at. I do agree that mining could be a lot more engaging but still, let people do what they enjoy and if that includes mining why complain? Its not like ccp is forcing you to mine.
---
Using “you gotta work for your _____” logic you should have to press a button continually during every Eve activity.  The only button mashing free time should be while docked up without any content (like the market) open.
---
who? never heard of her
---
**I wonder how long the eve echo camber can keep "BLACKOUT GOOD" going with false accusations and keeping at the upvote good downvote bad mentality**
---
Upload higher quality video next time.
---
Lol, they are going up mainly because people arent farming them. New abyssal pilots will hardly use the best mods so that price surge shouldnt present itself for another months or so.
---
Hes talking a lot of shit. But hes getting upvoted to hell. Which kinda says alot about this sub.
---
Even better,  buy a bundle of plex if you like the game.
---
Maybe the better question is: Is the subreddit on par with the culture of the game?
---
If the answer is yes then the response is no we shouldn't change because that is EVE for you suck it up buttercup. If the answer is no, the subreddit is worse then maybe something needs to change. 
---
EVE is not a nice (friendly/coddle you) game and the subreddit should be a reflection of that.
---
As much as we are jerks to each other on here and in game, I have not seen a closer game community than EVE.
---
No! I dont think you understand it at all. 
---
What I want and also what this game owes me is perfect intel and the ability to farm isk in almost complete safety. I like to do this whilst watching Netflix or playing a different game. 
---
If I can’t have this then there is way too much risk and I should just be in high sec. If CCP would allow rorquals in HS I think I’d keep my accounts subbed.
---
It did decrease, sharply. You forgot about that? Just before the login event? I mean are you seriously pushing this narrative?
---
❤️
---
220 ACs are an interesting choice. I think that's the first time I've seen those on a gnosis over blasters. That is a very weird fit you got there bro.
---
Alright chief, based on what statistic? 1600 kills last 7 days seems decent to me!
---
Unless, of course only 200 vs 200 ferox fleets count as PvP in your book  [https://imgur.com/a/OQ2UXy0](https://imgur.com/a/OQ2UXy0) ?
---
Well, i'm Shin Kudo Udan, interested in Scorpion Ishukone Watch and Blackbird Blue Tiger, pls contact me in game, o/
---
It's most like a rivalry. I have friends in different corporation and coalition and often we shoot to each others but at the end of the day we are still friends even if we insult each others. Don't look too much at it, just find your friends and your good company.
---
Nobody roams in, say, a small HAC fleet in Delve, because it's suicide; nobody hits structures in Delve for the same reasons. The conditions you have set up only allow non-Goons to fly cloaky or cheap assault frigs and gank idiots and bots, and so that's all the PVP Delve gets. (This isn't a complaint about Goons, btw, it's a fine and very effective system for maximizing supercap production and use.) If you want subcap-heavy smaller fleet fights over structures or sov, that just isn't going to happen where you are; you need to go to a group that is set up to get those sort of fights or live in a smaller Goon or Goon-aligned group outside of Delve.
---
Can confirm, their nanogang can beat up our nanogang. Good fights, looking forward to winning one at some point lol.
---
the structures werent frats. frat decided to side with the defenders though. and since frat and horde were blue that made things a little awkward
---
We have one of the best communities yet yes, we are also full of idiots. Everywhere.

Garbage people = Garbage sub 
---
I mean, they let ME hang out here ffs...
---
They really need to make major changes to ecm.  It is completely useless.
---
Either all the ecm ships need huge amount of tank bonuses or they need to massively out range damps.
---
There are explo bots, but they're dying a lot more post-blackout too - pre-blackout, they would just warp out if the system was occupied and were essentially un-killable. Explo loot (data site stuff especially) seems to be more profitable as a result.
---
literally 90% of all solo/smallgang content in the history of eve. Spoiler: a small group of people who know what they are doing will almost ALWAYS lose to a much larger group of people who also know what they are doing

Htfu

That's not how Entrapment Arrays are believed to work by the majority of players who have looked in to them properly - They increase the chance of a DED site naturally spawning in the constellation with the array, vs. systems in constellations in the same region without those arrays. There is no absolute increase in DEDs in region.
---
Hence, you putting them across half your region would nullify them. 
---
&gt;And providing infrastructure and keeping ADMs up for Entrapment Arrays to be effective is impossible for small alliances now.
---
Except for all the groups in PB &amp; Tribute, of course.
---
I think they call them new galmil
---
Good question.  Maybe it has to do with damage taken?  Hull damage taken?
---
Simple, its not the corp, its the game mechanic.
---
Suicide ganking is definitely profitable if you do it right. CODE. sometimes doesn't give a fuck about profit, but agents who need money can just be selective with their targets and gank intelligently rather than indiscriminately.
---
There is a reason no elite small gang group fought each other back in the day despite being all no blues exdee
---
This is pretty funny, and if you can get away with it, yay.
---
They are online, especially small sp farms that people are also engaged in some activity like production or PI.       
---
If before extractors some activity gave you 130% in PLEX value per whole account as a return it was simply not worth it. 30% profit was to small.     
---
But now with extractors paying for the account - you can engage in even less time consuming activities and get just 50% of PLEX value and make much bigger profit. ^(aka even if you are making less isk, lack of initial cost in form of PLEX makes you make more isk).
---
I'll take "Hard pills to swallow" for 200, Alex
---
Good pirate corps I know of recruiting newbros are KINAKKA., Wingspan Delivery Services (sorry but in all but name you're pirates), and Stay Frosty, it definitely sounds like you want to be some kind of pirate. If you want to be a ganker, CODE. is always recruiting and are the household name in suicide ganks. If you want to raid the big empires, I'm fairly sure there are wormhole based small gang corps recruiting newbros, but I can't think of any off the top of my head. Somebody from jspace help me out here!
---
Where are the faction Fortizars WinterCo handed over? I know they still own a few.
---
So why is everyone doing exactly the same, flying cloaky ships in every part of NS?
---
His point is new players go mine, nothing happens, they leave.
---
Sounds like pretty usual case for most null staging regions. Maybe less supers dropped on you.
---
Bounties are pretty meaningless, especially 100k isk. I think the only time a bounty ever influenced my decision was an absolutely bait machariel with a giant bounty on him, and I said fuck it lets drop on him.
---
If you count the bounty payout the dreads were green lol.
---
&gt;I have not seen a closer game community than EVE.
---
HueHue, ou seven fellow capuleers!
---
Nice Cap-Drop on that procurer last night. That DD should show him not to mine during Blackout anymore! Wha- he wants to quit? HDFU carebear go to hisec. We should opsec a cov fleet and camp his constellation to really make him want to kill himself. Haha, just for the eve salt tho. 
---
Fly safe Ecks Dee
---
Yeah sure, boost 0.0 isk generation even more. Goons / TEST / PH-block will be happy im sure. Fore everybody else (most people in small alliances without supercap umbrella) it wont matter, its just too risky for casuals to effectively mine/rat in 0.0 while blackout is ongoing.
---
you are assuming I only fuck about in Delve, the only way to catch anything remotely out of a supercap umbrella is with cloaky stuff because those who are outside of the umbrella are hyper aware and will absolutely see you when you get in D-Scan range, Local gave them a lot of a false sense of security before hand now they pay more attention so the only way to get responses from them is by going into the umbrella territory where more often than not the response is a cyno instead of subcaps. I already did get plenty of the subcap fights before the blackout whilst still in goons. so please quit using that totally unrelated point in regards to this.
---
That's funny. I re-subbed just because of the blackout. I am in a small corp, in a small alliance with no umbrella, living in NPC null, solo roaming to make is. I made like 500m yesterday in maybe an hour an a half of some exploration and some moon mining in basic T1 ships(Heron+ Covetor). If I really wanted to up my ISK I could even start running all the DED sites i scan down, but since I've only been back a few weeks I haven't taken the time to do that.  If you can't figure out how to make isk in null you belong in high sec.
---
Solo has been largely dead since 2009 or so... (this post may contain sarcasm)
---
D: retart D:
---
Basically same procedure as with non abyssal...so bloody obvious yet I missed it.
---
I'm not sure how to simplify this further for you mate.

Maybe you could try out a keres?

Pretty sure 95% of the Jita scam spam are bots.

You should find a group of friends in the game who share your interests.

That's because they always sit at max range with Depleted Uranium or Tremor. Ofc it sucks when you do less  damage than a Ferox...
---
Thx
---
some areas have definitely died down post-blackout and others have gotten more vigilant (which might lead to you dying more), but that's eve
---
you should try to instil the same attitude you have in the rest of evictus, that'd be a welcome change!
---
Aware, human players at the keyboard is a good thing. I guess you'll just have to do what everyone else does - kill fighters for a bit then jet off to burn down the next thing your scouts found to kill under the umbrella, and do it before the caps' fatigue goes down.
---
You can still catch plenty of stuff in a fast-moving frig or dessie gang; if anything, ratters/miners in the green sites that are within d-scan range of a gate are much more vulnerable to that than prior to the local changes.
---
Dude, morons never learn. Thats why theyre called morons. Theyre gonna keep doubling down no matter what.
---
They should give players an option to start in FW, would give goals and a"team" to fight for.
---
Yeah, it would be nice for Providence to be exempt from the blackout. I mean they are literally RPing to be a part of the Amarr empire ;)
---
Also, NPC 0.0 should get local back asap (NPC factions are fueling the fluid routes ore something...). Would be nice to have some variety/options in 0.0 space.
---
This must be incorrect. Blackout fixed everything.
---
&gt; There has been a clear and obvious exodus of players from nullsec into highsec specifically because of the risk involved with farming in nullsec vs the risk/reward of the abyssal sites.
---
I can hear the distant echo of highsec incursions fucking over wormholes the same way. 
---
But for boosting nullsec income you have to take into account it is still the most isk being generated by far and the most scalable source of income. If you boost it enough to make it good without the umbrella it becomes even more ridiculous under the umbrella. And it is already really messing up the economy
---
My group is facing increased pressure because we've stayed where we were and adapted to the blackout rather than run to high sec.
---
 At times its been brutal and ill say personally it really sucks trying to play outside my groups active TZ ( I work evenings so sometimes I can only play during what I guess is AUTZ). Even during our active TZ, with the best defensive measures we can organize its just a matter of when the next enemy cyno will be lit and 90 bombers will be on us.
---
 It's like ccp is punishing folks like me for not being in some huge umbrella protected bloc. I continue to play in null out of stubbornness more than anything else. And because I hate low sec lol.
---
Wouldn't it be more like drinking at the bar but then not wanting to talk to anyone?
---
Have you been able to determine anywhere if you can do the Booster reactions in HighSec now?
---
Mods don’t know any better.
---
Considering that Eve has primarily an older player base and we keep our dumpster fires here instead of in game over comms like you see in damn near every online fps game... I think we are doing ok.
---
You meant to say suicide Griffin
---
We are renter corp, and the alliance channel including landlord and their customers. The channel now is empty, sometimes somebody comes to try to sell their items before the corp moved to another zones or off. The corp next to us is botting in their dead-end system and create a red point in Dotlan so many of TEST, BRAVE, RR, FRT and (only see one time) Goons "visit" the pocket
---
Yes and no.  A super or two or a couple of carriers normally isn't a problem for a nano gang.  Kite the fighters, haze sup caps and tackle.  Start hazing fighters.  Move on to the capital ships.  This can normally be quite fun.  But when someone forms a 30 man alpha doctrine with t2 logi for your 6-7 dudes thats completely different.  Its like when someone forms 20 jackdaws for your half a dozen retributions and reeeeeeees in local asking why you ran.
---
They are adapting, by leaving.
---
Aware human players at the keyboard is cool and good I agree on this point, but again this is just another way to get around ganking, it's got shit all to do with actual fleet fights against stuff like sub cap responses because you just don't get those responses in umbrella space you used to get them on the fringes and in smaller groups space, the parts of space that are now emptying thus reducing the diversity of content to very repetitive, gank thing run away gank thing run away gank thing get caught die to caps playstyle which is fine every now and again but the spice and variety of pvp has gone way down. shits just boring now.
---
People sometimes forget to recall their drones. You can then come and scoop them up.
---
I'm talking replicating a chat like in OP, not a dumb timer based script.
---
I've joined this game roughly one and half week ago. I had expected mining to be a *bit* more engaging but I mostly expected to be ignoring it.
---
Turns out it's the thing I do the most and I kinda like it. Yeah I'm watching shows on a second monitor because, as you said, watching the cargo hold fill up is boring. 
---
As a new player everything over a million isk looks pricy, I know almost everyone here will laugh at that statement but still. When I look at battlecruisers or bigger ships, I think they are super expensive. I managed to find some cheap blueprints for a BC and a BS and since those take millions of minerals I invested in a retriever that takes about half an hour to fill it's cargo bay. I found a good sector to mine *almost* everything I need for those ships and I'm happily chewing asteroids while watching shows so I don't have to spend dozens of millions on those ships. I don't even know if this is effective, I might be better off selling the ores and buy the ships with the earned isk. 
---
Hell, I even went Omega just to get a better mining ship mostly (also the extra refining skills)
---
When I don't feel like watching whatever show I'm watching anymore I just hop back into my cruiser and go rat a bit or do some missions or whatever.
---
So yeah, on the one hand I agree with you. It's boring. But on the other hand, even though it's the activity I expected to do the least, it's the one I end up doing the most (not counting pvp, I feel I need more than 1.5 week of game experience before I even consider pvp)
---
The reason you see a lot of that instead of "legit discussion" is that 90% of the idea or discussion threads are the same conversations that have been had a thousand times over the last decade and a half, and the OP isn't adding anything decent or new. 
---
On the few threads that do offer a new take (or a popular old one) you'll see them at the top of the sub and people talking about them.
---
With the enjoyment of the blackout, I think at this point a middle ground will be needed.  Maybe something to detect cloakers specifically like an observatory that can fire a pulse every two hours or something that decloaks cloakers for 15 minutes or something.
---
Is it becoming too hard to pay your rent now??
---
Have you considered using a 1% CPU implant? Would actually end up saving you 5 mil and getting you slightly better tank as you can equip a DCU II in place of the IFFA.
---
I am Abyssal ingorant -  Isn't the income from the loot?
---
If so, a big increase in farmers will mean a flood of more of those stuffs, reducing their price.
---
Yes 100%, and the same goes for every one of those solo hero clips of one guy in an active tanked battleship beating the shit out of 30 morons in t1 nonsense. Like, "oh we couldn't break his tank with 30 of us, but now that he has killed half of us we definitely can, let's move single file into scram range". It's the nature of the game and it's a good thing, but it can be a bit misleading to newer players.
---
Yeah, our leaders are sending most elite members to big alliances to study about large-scale PVP and setup backup plans in case of everything worse. Also we are researching ship replacement for newbies (VNI still good but it require full skill for T2 light med and heavy drones) and "borrow" some suitable system for farming (actually no one hire this system or they are quit by BO or just come to farm, no one care about sov in this moment anymore if you just confirm the ship they reported on intel channel is you)
---
No.
---
My guess is that we'll see more small-scale "campaigns" - groups of 20-50 people (whether independent or sigs or large groups) punching at the space of larger but more stagnant groups, now that post-bot-level ADMs allow for that space to be attacked a little more effectively. If little groups can avoid calling in the big guns to avoid losing the occasional fight/objective, I think they'll ultimately have a lot of success and open up a lot more space for smaller groups to take and hold in small pockets.
---
&gt; Can we try just a little bit to have decent civil discussion sometimes?
---
Sadly a non marginal sized group of eve players has apparently never learned to articulate their opinions without spewing insults ans profanities. So no, this probably won't change. Best thing you can do is to use the ignore/block feature to get rid of the worst offenders.
---
Uhmm no, that's not what I am saying.
---
Look at your space:  [https://i.imgur.com/pGcbl1Z.png](https://i.imgur.com/pGcbl1Z.png)  last 24h kills / pod. 
---
You have no ploblems with the blackout because people are not really hunting you. That is my point, not the number of kills you have or what fleets I join.
---
At this point I don't know how anyone can say null is as target rich as it was a month ago. We can debate activity metrics or player counts all we want but ADMs don't lie. Look at catch.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Catch#adm
---
The ONLY system that's six is Brave's capitol. Several of the other over 2 systems are only over 2 because they're capitol systems. Sure, catch is kind of a unique region because it's a gateway to null but two months ago most of that Sov was 3 to 4. You had enough people out doing subcap mining and ratting that even if it wasn't going to let you space retire, it was letting you pay the bills. Null definitely needed to have some ISK sucked out of it, and I'm happy to see the effect this is having on bots but sooner or later alliances not named Test, Goonswarm, etc... are going to run into issues funding SRP, infra, and upkeep costs. 
---
The effect on small sov null entities should be clear by now but the next group to take a hit are going to be the mid majors who suddenly find they can't afford to replace the ships they're losing from all this PvP, nor the costs associated with having infrastructure through out there sov. It may be going as planned from CCPs point of view, but it's going to get worse before it gets better. 
---
And yeah, I know, HTFU adapt and all that. But I wonder if blackout true believers will feel the same way two months from now when entire regions get abandoned and your target choice consists of Delve and Eso.
---
Never fly what you cannot afford to lose.
---
I support simple fun.
---
Or alts!

thanks anyway ;) !

buy 10 rifters and don't bring them back.

Let's try this a different way.

PH shoot stuff, frat defended that stuff, PH set them to not friends, few days later they are set back to friends.

Don't get me wrong, I could totally afford to lose that ship. I just take the game too seriously.
---
friends -&gt; enemies -&gt; friends
---
I'm sorry your super safe ratting space isn't so safe anymore.  Lashing out at me doesn't help anyone.  Getting good might be a better option for you my friend.
---
It did. It broke the addiction for many. I now know how the sun feels.
---
its not that bad a loss, could be worse , could be like me losing 1b assault frigs :D
---
boosting nullsec isk?
---
Getting rid of all the safe PVE  (assuming this works) would literally do just that.  Null was the place for high risk/high reward.  It became so safe that with rorq changes, respawning anoms, injectors, etc there has been a huge overproduction of materials.
---
yes we should all do like goons and blue up the second largest coalition in the game right? next level diplomacy
---
&gt; Its not hesitation, its killing the ship types all together. What you fail to see is what happens when you bring 256 of those bombers. No caps will survive which means that caps will never be deployed again. 
---
If 256 of those are seen on d-scan, caps don't un-dock and you kill that 256 bombers with a jackdaws or some cheap frigs.  It's counter play, not bias.  Right now goons or test drop 200 titans and there is no counter play other than more titans.   Titans and supers have displaced fleets of other ships simply because they hit sub-caps and can destroy fleets of subcaps with little or no assistance.   I get why cap pilots resist this - it takes a helluva long time (or RLM) to train into them, and them more to buy / fit them.  That isn't a good enough reason that "titans online" wins over all else.   It also doesn't just happen in Delve, it happens in SNUFF space, in TEST space, in PH space, in FRT space....   Lastly, CCP I don't think meant for one group to be able to drop 500+ titans in any one battle or area.  Caps are too common and they need to be nerfed hard for the health of Eve IMO.  Granted I get many disagree and that's ok.
---
When you think about it - it should have always been like this.  Null sec is ZERO security player owned space.  There should be no Concord “Tech” in the form of local. Intel. 
---
Local should be in low sec and high sec only, where space is controlled by Concord
---
Care Bears are crying.  Survive, adapt , overcome.  
---
It was becoming to easy for AFK ratting, no effort isk making, mining and generally safe systems brought to you by intel from tech (local) that shouldn’t have been there- high risk high reward has always been the case in eve.  
---
Null sec and wormhole space is space not controlled by Concord at all.  As with anything there are new strategies that can be implemented.  IE: cloaky eyes on gates - bubbles set - hit DScan until its second nature.  Mining off of maned Athanors.  
---
I’m glad the care bares in null sec are being forced out.  It will create better pilots and better competitors in null.  - go back to high sec - 
---
If you want easy go play WOW.  
---
————-
---
20 minuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutes
---
Oh no I totaly get what happened after your prior explanation, I was just finding it bizarre that this is how it works,  but thanks for making it clear
---
“Afford” doesn’t purely refer to ISK.
---
Eyes on the gate and the ability to bait will make those cloaky lokis search for greener pastures quickly enough.
---
Could always move to space like Tribute that's not so overfished then, eh? People need to spread out more I guess.
---
But hey, CCP was all about "helping" the little guy. They are teaching you how to "play" the game by breaking your spirit. Right up to the point where people realise Eve simply isnt worth it anymore.
---
I know..it can be completed in less than 10 actually (info from some pilot studies we did), but it really depends! Thank you in any case!
---
If your landlords aren't protecting you it's time to stop paying.
---
Wait till you discover ways to make in 15min more than in whole day of mining ... just to discover that all skillpoints you have invested in mining are now worthless.          
---
hint:          
---
* try ninja salvaging in some lvl 4 mission hub ^(t1 frigate with combat probes, salvage rigs and salvagers - you probe MTU )        
---
* ninja salvaging in trig incursions - bit more dangerous, you do this with rats, just expect to lose those t1 frigates .... but make more isk
---
screams from dock - solo pvp is dead, blackout bad thing!
---
Don't ever change &lt;3
---
I've seen a fair number of nullsec players running level 4s in marauders lately.  And not random shit-tier corps.
---
Its almost like most of our fights happen outside our home pocket 🤔
---
Blackout was created to force people into Abyssals!!!!
---
You can break even in Rally Points in a Myrm in no time at all, even without considering the escalations. You don't do the green sites to make money; so long as you're not losing it and you're getting a regular supply of DED lottery tickets, all is well.
---
No, the official stuff says it's just time from first boarding and nothing else (though the system leaves it open for the artists to have other things related to activity).
---
There is a damage effect for armor and hull, but that is seperate.
---
But... but... butt....  backout?
---
Only one way to find out.
---
But cloaks are omega...so you'd be really risking it.
---
oh okay got it, yeah that awkwardness kinda set me off, but as long as they get along again its fine I guess?
---
Thank You
---
Except for the randomly opening holes when you're sieged in your dread.  And even when that doesn't happen, there's still a time commitment to make your wormhole safe.  You just undock, orbit a beacon, then warp to the next.  Nullsec under an umbrella is the safe space.  You've got it wrong.  Too much spod.
---
Find a nice region to live in. The majority of highsec is a little overcrowded. Then analyse the markets, if your region has a dead market on something, go for those commodities, either manufacture them, or sell them at +20% from what you have purchased them. Sometimes manufacturing isn't really worth it, you could as well just sell the minerals.
---
The startup phase;
---
1. mining skills training - prioritise barges and mining yield skills over reprocessing. At some point you'll want to train transport ships as a side show. When you can fly a mining barge comfortably, maybe put up an alt in an  Orca and a transport ship beforehand, you'll go for reprocessing skills. They're not necessarily for reprocessing the ores yourself, but to be able to use t2 mining equipment.
---
2. manufacturing training - the basic manufacture skills are relatively easy to acquire, take your time carefully studying the markets, know everything about every item at best. Don't go for capital construction components in highsec, most of the time capitals are build locally, because their volume is just too high to make any transport infeasible.
---
3. trade skills - Train the necessary skills that improve your buy and sell order range, minimise taxes, max out contract slots, etc, etc. You don't need to max out your order limit right away, go with a 60+ order limit first.
---
I would put up a structure really late, with the structure being put up by a holding corp, due to wardec mechanics. If you want to keep it in your own corp, you'll need a bunch of people and structure management can become a full time job in the game at some point. In any way, a structure can be expensive not only in maintenance, but also in defense. Personally I'd put up a market outpost next to a lowsec and sell frigs and modules for example, sell a bunch of plex as market bait.
---
Well met.
---
oh no it was made clear already, I was just stuck on the awkwardness that must have been that whole engagement
---
No, I am not.
---
CCP already said "continuous D scan" would break the server.  So thanks for your impossible suggestion.
---
Aaaaw man, not those ASCII dicks!
---
This guy Provis.
---
Lol. Sure, thats how things work. Its not like you can show up after the drop right?
---
They have not, dude why are you talking so much shit. Im in fking TEST, you know how rare it is for us to drop supers/titans. For fks sakes dude stop.
---
They "can". If they fking hit the BFG or lance which is so rare thats its a joke that youre using it as normal procedure. Fking everytime people hit one they post it here. 
---
But its pure bullshit. Its not titans online. You are straight up talking out of your ass. 
---
And no one with caps is complaining because we understand how they work. We dont just sit and theorycraft, we actually know their weaknesses. So try learning them and then talk.
---
Frat caused a diplomatic incident by showing up to someone else’s trash structure timer.
---
PH set Frat neutral for the duration until the diplomatic incident could be cleared up in an attempt to avoid a situation where Frat would appear to be blue while shooting Horde because nobody could explain why Frat was shooting Horde at the trash timer. 
---
Frat gets reminded that Horde are friends, not food, and the diplomatic incident was resolved.
---
This truly isn’t that complicated, even someone such as yourself should be able to understand it.
---
just sounds like risk/reward is finally being balanced out again.
---
Null was safer than high sec honestly and that was so wrong
---
Well said dude. The nullsec space should be for experienced pilots in the first place but with how easy it was to train a newbie into a mindless tax collecting drone, a lot of garbage players coagulated in the best ratting space.
---
It is good but not for null. The increase in traffic in lowsec is noticable. The fighting for lowsec resources is real. Null needed something of reset and this is it. Smart alliances will consolidate into fewer systems, protect their borders and continue doing the thing. Same for corps within alliances that have decent numbers. 
---
I'm seeing things I've never seen in lowsec before. Alliances are being formed to protect each other even between rivals. 
---
Things are what they are. You have to adapt for how they are. Whiners will keep crying though.
---
you have literally zero idea what the fuck you're on about do you lmao
---
No worries. At least you're honest about it, and you're running through a semi trusted provider. I've had far worse incidents with other ad supported game community sites. I've had to file police reports over the amount of malware some other games' major service sites push.
---
Have you activated your almonds to consider that as a competent PvP alliance, we make sure that we watch for when baddies come in and bait them in order to rid ourselves of them? Literally just over this weekend:

Hi, I just donated $0.50, you're now my personal dev, why is this feature not finished? I PAYED GOOD MONEY SQUIZZ, I DEMAND ANSWERS.
---
No
---
At this point in the game, can anyone in null really exist without goons allowing them to exist?
---
Still doesn't mean all those entities are blue or renters, etc. I imagine that goons don't really gaf about controlling smaller groups, more likely their attitude is one of keeping the space away from certain big blocs while also trying to foster small homesteaders.
---
Neither of those activities requires more than 5 minutes per character every couple of days, and if someone IS running an SP farm with 2000 accounts I can guarantee you that they did not set up PI on all 2000 because that would take years
---
Wh is that way and as been bu design.  You dont pring all your stuff to wormholes, as once again pos's were orvshould have been, on lock down.  The mechanic of losing all things was there from day one, and as a former and currebt wh'er i only took what i needed, and left my valuable crap in empire.  And when i lived and owned null i operated differently. Though i was never entrinched as some people in larger groups
---
Thank you for being an adult.

Good luck, hope it turns out well. But hang in there, nobody has said the blackout will last.

It's almost like you guys can't supply any knowledge about the blackout then. Exactly!
---
Just bring back the suspect timer THAT WAS ALREADY IN THE GAME before CCP decided to be dumb
---
Sorry bro, but those few bad actors could cause a malware infection that could wreak irreparable damage. It's just not worth it. I'll support you by donating ISK or any other means, but ads get blocked on my system for that exact reason.
---
yeah maybe once the vast majority of nullsec gets tired of the blackout and the lack of content it entails and up and quit the game, leaving room for only those who were stubborn enough to stick it out, it's hardly great for the health of the game long term though is it? Cos as it stands with the dwindling amount of content for groups larger than  said 20-50 people if said 20-50 people tried anything there would be a mad rush to blob them to get what little fix of content they can. I still maintain that the blackout was the wrong decision and instead of the losing local they could have worked on dealing with how supercapitals interact with subcaps so that it wasn't an effective method of saving your shit or something more along those lines. Encouraging subcap PVP is what will save  this game, the blackout unfortunately only strengthens the need to rely on caps.
---
&gt; non marginal
---
mmmmm i love the sound of soy in the morning.
---
Much is broken about ded sites but give me a break. You just said it and nobody is surprised the average nullsec supercap pilot would have no clue how to run a ded (assuming it became worth it but they still do the 20 jumps back and forth to sell the bookmark.)
---
friends &gt; not friends (not enemies) &gt; friends?
---
"experimental" in that it experiments with where you place them, rather than just being in a static location which may, or may not, drive engagement.
---
I don't care much for the isk / hour. If I did I would sell the ores instead of using them for manufacturing. Or at least find some kind of ratio to sell / refine for. 
---
I think what I like most about it is being self-sufficient. When going for the retriever, it should have cost me 20mil+ I spend about 200K on blueprints and the next day I was all set. It allows me to do whatever I want and in the worst case I manufacture what I lost.
---
Besides, ninja salvaging? The few times I tried salvaging it was not much more exciting than mining, except I can't really watch shows during salvaging since it doesnt that as long.
---
Punctuation called.  It misses you.
---
"Providence is haemorrhage right now" because it deserves to -- your leadership has a history of repeated poor decisions and is paying for it.
---
That's fine, you be you, the responsibility is on Google, not me. Yes, you can argue that but you won't get anywhere with me :)
---
Ah, didn't know that - thank you!
---
Hahaha.
---
&gt; but HTML is non regular
---
wut?
---
If someone wants to put a &amp;lt; in their text then they're of course welcome to but allowing a &lt; in transcluded content will always lead to abuse. That's not a matter of "woo me Google employee me smart", I'm sure there's a shitload of Google engineers who know that. They're just not allowed to reign in the abuses as long as they create more income than trouble.
---
No, because everyone should be killing each.
---
Set all the peoples to red.
---
Perhaps you misunderstand, but that's ok
---
when are you going to find another iq point to keep your one iq point company?
---
Hey u/Squizz have you ever thought about registering for something like [https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/](https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/)? There are probably other options as well but this is a cool way to get some crypto tips from your users.
---
You just earned 33 seconds of dev time, which you just spent reading the comments on this thread. Next!
---
Just don't.
---
Shitty highsec corps are a major cause of players leaving.
---
Man, the things they have to fix to make the game fun for a new player is... 
---
But hey, lets just introduce new things we arent going to iterate and then just delete from the game instead.
---
No, they were supposed to but ccp backtracked on that.
---
No insurance.
---
No free rookie ship.
---
No bounties on players or rats
---
You didn't read my post did you :(
---
Alot of the guys that said "reee blackout im gonna unsub" were just talking they still play. Like my one goon friend in my discord he was raging that he unsubs all his rorqs and will stop playing eve. Guess what, he is still playing. 
---
And the minority that left null for highsec, are they realy important? Null was empty anyway for the most system.
---
Squizz have you thought about having Corp Advertisements listed on zkill in exchange for iskies?
---
Lowtax has been accepting cash for 2 decades and I don't think he believes he owes anyone shit.
---
I get it, really I do.  I name my ships and have favorites, but in Eve it very much helps to embrace the "ships are ammunition" doctrine.  If the social shame of losing a ship under silly circumstances bugs you, buy yourself a cat (if ya aint already got one) on which to lay blame ("...fucking cat!", etc.).  Children/siblings are also good excuses.  Pet fish, not so much.  But ya get the idea, just don't "go to the well" too often on that.
---
Otherwise, getting ships blown up is pretty much one of the selling points of the game.  If you've got the coin to replace what you lose, rest assured that you are indeed playing the game most properly.
---
Make an alpha clone there are free and try things out
---
There are alot of corps and ally s where you can get your first wet feets without paying.
---
Why is this totally free service not working to my expectations?
---
You had better be careful, or I will create a competitor*! Rawr!
---
*As long as it doesn't take too much effort.
---
Are you sure it wasn't 150 cerbs against a 8 man frig/desi gang?
---
Bad Squizz! Never take a vacation again!
---
You are fucking garbage bro. Get of your high horse, everyone is having a laugh at ya.
---
&gt;  loss adverse players 
---
I guess you are talking about all the carebears that scream blackout is bad?
---
I have been scanning down people's MTUs and shooting them right in front of them. This guy got upset that I shot it and aggressed me. https://zkillboard.com/kill/78371216/
---
Lost at least 5 billions in ships due to connection lost in past years
---
And Im sorry, I didnt mean to be rude. But people are missing the point and pushing a narrative really hard. I havent seen you do it and being rude towards you was not cool. Sorry.
---
This. 
---
I flew with a guy a while back had really bad issues with stress and anxiety. And losing anything was like a life changing event for him. He was a good guy but when he lost big shit we legit thought he was gonna kill himself or something. Not because he couldn't afford to replace it but just the stress and humiliation of losing something blinged out threw him into a full blown panic attack. 
---
Being able to emotionally afford the loss is just as important as being able to financially afford it. People can say whatever they want about you being a pussy, I know cuz I say that shit all the time, but it's okay to have issues like this. Dont let it get to you is the best advice I can give. I get upset at my losses and I fly almost strictly frigates and destroyers, T1's at that. It's part of the game. You work hard for what you have and when it's gone it hurts. But dont let it get to ya. Take a deep breath, step away if you have to, but when your ready sit down and move on.
---
It's funny that people take this long to post because literally everyone has spies in Horde so everyone knew so there wasent much point in making a mega dank leak the second it happened.
---
Actually i have, but that requires work and meh
---
It needs only one thing! No asset safety in null sec.
---
Load up the game, do the tutorial.  Then pick something which seems fun for you.
---
yes.
---
Well.. 1. It's not a massive (or small) donate button/link on the page... 2. I see no reason why that would raise my expectation from Zkill... Just that you are open to tips that may help you keep the services running while taking a bit of load off your own wallet.
---
Or you could just pocket it.. IDC.
---
Look at all these retards falling for a front page hail mary post.
---
FUCK NO.  Kill those stupid sticks with all the fire.
---
What about npc null though?
---
I flew through about 20 delve systems Saturday and did not see one ship on DScan.
---
pot meet kettle
---
quit frankly I don't give a fuck, I'm just highlighting the hypocrisy
---
Oh hey look, I ran another 3 relic sites in the last 15 minutes... another 100m. And found 2 more combat sites i could run if i wanted.
---
Carebear huh? Sure buddy. 
---
I never said I thought continuous dscan was a good idea, or that I was in favour of it.
---
Everything I said is true. But keep calling me names.
---
I lost 10B in an instant with a mistake the other month. shit happens :(   
---
But don't let it put you off! just gotta learn from it :D
---
What are you talking about? Ccp nerfed our isk making, if we cry loud enough they will give it back.
---
NPC isn’t necessarily Concord.  So no.  It’s just non player character

Video of a little skirmish that Origin/FRT had last week fighting 2v1 vs Legacy Hurricanes and Test Muninns.  We were there to contest an IHUB that was reinforced in Catch.  Test managed to save their hub while this fight was going on
---
Posting this video because this fight is probably my favorite brawl I've FC'd so far, and im extremely proud of our elite logi pilots.  Fighting vs 2 fleets is extremely hectic for logi pilots, but dispite this our only 2 losses were due to 1 pilot burning straight into the enemy fleet, and another one that warped in late into a bubble and didnt speak up at all.
---
Shoutouts to William Weist for recording/editing/dual boxing logis like a chad, Tiana for being the best logi FC ingame, and FWNaipe for allowing me to assimilate his fleet into mine to get more numbers :D
---
Blackout was a mistake, not a surprise.
---
Til dev =/= lawyer
---
Better than paid services not working to your expectations. Like EVE for example :)
---
But squuuuiiiiiiiizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, this is because you use PHP! who uses PHP! oh wait...
---
It will require a different way of thinking. Rather then having masses of space people don’t use  (no intel space) but hold for the sake of look we have Sov of this region it will be smaller groups living in systems and ratting/mining/defending and been active ie active camps or scouts to get the intel. Rather then people depending on intel from local
---
I use adblock, but I remember when I was active in EVE, I donated a bunch of ISK to you anyway.
---
Word, word. It all takes time and effort, yes, and the part about what's limiting people is 100% true. I've been told dozens of times solo blops is not a thing post-citadel
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/94888963/group/898/
---
lol
---
Ive adapted, alpha'd my indy toons (no need to quit!), moved my main to high to run invasions, having a ball. Got a jc in null for corp fleets etc but balls to feeding gankers.
---
Gobbins isnt the kind of guy who takes orders
---
Renter space used to include protection.  With local, VNIs, intel, etc "renter" meant someone was willing to grind some sov space and show up for some timers.  Seems now it means some actual defense and effort on the intel side.  
---
Now if you wanted to sit in a barge and AFK laser some rocks, or orbit a point and drone-rat, you are going to have to either pay up for the all frills intel/defense luxury rental space, or deal with what comes cheap, or safe, or remunerative (pick 2).
---
Thanks for zkill and all you do man. Yah I saw some annoying ads but I think my brain is slightly developed enough so I kinda guessed it wasn’t anything you did. Of course it’s google. That makes sense haha
---
The irony is incredible, you must be a sockpuppet of lorenzo or something. You just assumed people join to do exactly what you do, get your head out of your ass most normal people hate giant tidi blob fests. It s fun for the fc and whoever runs the show, but for the guy in his little battleship it s pretty garbage. At least if you tried anything else in eve to have, you know something to conpare to.
---
I'm just giving my opinion, not "talking shit".  And you know what TEST does 100% of the time every day?  Who's talking shit now?
---
Like I said, it's my opinion and if you played the game long enough and in enough areas you'd have gotten dropped on by TEST and Horde, and Goons and SNUFF and there's nothing anyone can do except escalate if that's even possible.  Suggesting I don't know how they work is pretty weak.  I talk because I've seen the game change since 2006 and nothing you've said changes the fact that there is no counter play for subcap fleets once titans or supers are dropped - let's not forget the fax that come in as well.  Why do you tell me how say 2 full fleets of Eagles or Munnin's with no escalation possiblity kill a single titan fit with a cyno.  I'm sure you know all about it and I'm ready to learn.
---
&gt;*HEY GUYS, WATCH OUT, LEMME COME THROUGH WITH THIS BIG BOTTLE OF FUCK-COMEDY-NARRATIVES STOOL SOFTENER AND TAKE-SHIT-TOO-SERIOUS LAXATIVES SO I CAN SHIT ON EVERYONE'S FUN.*
---
ftfy
---
Why ? WC are more powerfull than NC/PL they come everytime when you ask for their help, they don't demand anything in return and more important they never backstab   
---
can't say the same for Panfam
---
POSes cant be removed fast enough. We don't need more things to be spammed around. POS code is holding up a lot of better improvements to the game, and I am really hoping well see their removal sometime this year. We dont need them anymore.
---
Definitely not balanced.  It has swung too far towards Risk now.  But I do not think we will be going back to local in null.  Other changes needed.
---
I bet you think there’s no aliens at Area 51 too.
---
ships are ammunition, not an investment.
---
The best thing you can do to learn the game is find a small Corp with friendly ppl willing to teach you. As a new player I would not recommend joining a vary large Corp as it can be overwhelming to a new player/you won’t understand much. This is all just my opinion built off of my experience starting the game.
---
I bet if you pointed out what some of your "best defensive measures" are someone on here will suggest others you could use.
---
I know it is possible you have done the best and it really won't work.  But if you don't have at least one Procurer named "Bait" in your hangar you probably haven't even really started trying.
---
1. Have instadock
---
2. Have station set as destination
---
3. Warp to instadock
---
4. Once in warp, turn on autopilot
---
This will get your docking request in as soon as possible when you come out of warp. With luck, you go from warp invuln to docked without time for anybody to get off a volley.
---
I would agree with this except you don’t mention the ESI data that gives hunters knowledge of pve activity without even being in the system.  That intel should not be available in null either.   It’s ez mode for hunters right now.
---
As a fellow dev I believe you were kind and gave them 3 seconds to many. As a minimal contracting rate should be around 60/hr == $1/min. Thus they should have only gotten 30 seconds for their .50 cents.
---
I'm not saying it detracts from the impressive nature of the kill, but does baiting really equal hunting?
---
I would argue that Vonhole is by far the best blops baiter but I've personally worked with pilots who in my opinion are better hunters.
---
My apologies for assuming you were talking about your krabbing. I was legit trying to help.
---
I completely agree that blackout has accelerated the rate at which groups condense under umbrellas. I said before CCP preposed the blackout that this would happen, and that everything would be bait, a cyno, or a dirt cheap insured myrm. My content sounds pretty much the same as yours, and has been affected in exactly the same way.
---
That being said, our corp does lots of blops anyway, so it is not too bad.
---
Nice bait, worked well
---
&gt; The distance depends on the gate; regional gates have a larger radius, for example.
---
I remember this, but I've noticed lately (came back from a layoff) that it always seems to be 12km these days.
---
Your opinion isnt based onf facts. TEST does not drop super/titans all that often. I would fking know.
---
There are always counterplays. Just put out a cyno inhib and rep it. If titan cynos in FAX kill them. Dont get caught by bosons or lance (which isnt hard) and kill as much as you can. Literally what we do in NS every fking time. Will we get the bigger stuff, prob not. They can escalate much further.
---
But, do we cry about it? No we dont because we understand that you cant always kill everything. That if everyone could kill titans everytime then no one will use them. And thats the point, you have to understand your limitations. You cant be undermanned, undergunned and in hostile space but still think you can win. It doesnt make sense.
---
thread miss-matches the title, downvote
---
So just because CCP roleplays and tells you that only Concord can use MacGuffin to create Local chat, means other Entities can't?
---
Hey, let me give that a try:
---
"Harumph, CCP Falcon here, So Guristas were doing Pirate stuff again and stole the Local-technology from Concord, other Pirate Factions were quick to buy this tech for hefty payments. Now NPC Null has local. FIN."
---
Dude, please man stfu. CCP ads are filled with LS players? Go talk shit to someone else.
---
I know this is going to sound cruel but other than the corp closing is this really a bad thing? I mean if they can't handle the risk associated with the nullsec reward, shouldn't they move to highsec?
---
One place I'm thinking about moving to is WH space. I've lived there earlier so I sort of know the ropes. While the blackout is on, WH space is safer than null and gives better ISK, what's it not to like?
---
No, you can't do boosters in highsec or no, no one knows?
---
Don't logon
---
They Spent more time on that routine than balancing the game.
---
Only a couple days late.
---
Warmholes are nice rn
---
Only when you get the final blow on a player ship.

Lets put this in a business context.  At some point, your small business grows enough that you become either a threat, or a target of other businesses around you.  You have a few business decisions to make at that point.
---
1) Merger.  You either buy the local business to expand power and influence, or become bought out by a local entity and become a subsidiary (Pet).  You gain protection, but lose autonomy.  
---
2) Alliance.  You come to a joint mutual agreement to ally and/or protect each other's business assets as you both continue to grow.  These can be temporary, or long lasting.  A draft of agreement must be stated in order to not violate the so-called alliance
---
3)  Attack.  You go after a local business entities market and try to take it over.  You do not necessarily have to destroy the entity or capture it, just disrupt it enough in order for the target to shrink its market, or close shop.  Depending on your target, this could take a day, or years.  Most competition are risk adverse to losing margin or doing operations that are not in its wheelhouse or does not generate a income (nobody wants to spend money on extra advertising or client development in order to protect that of what they have).  They also do not want to invest more of their income to their employees of the company, but they may have to in order to protect assets, protect locations, or incentives them to work against the incoming influences.  This part of business strategy many MANY organizations do not do (It is very time intensive and takes leadership a lot to setup and maintain).
---
4) Leasing.  One could lease (aka pay) the enemy  a fee for use of their clientele or location.  This can be favorable to the enemy as it frees up time and resources (Players), to go work on other avenues of game-play and development.  Many corporations would take a pay cut if they no longer had to dedicate resources to a project, yet still receive a income from it.  
---
5) Bitch.  You can jump on reddit and bitch about things you have no control over and dwell on the past.  These companies are destroyed due to internal drama, complete lack of leadership, and the refusal to adapt to change.  These legacy companies become prime targets of other ventures as they realize that the clientele can easily be taken with little to no reprisal.  
---
You are thinking about your corporation like it is a single entity, a player, you.  You are not leading.  If you want to bring new joy to your workers, learn how to lead, learn strategy, understand business decisions, and be ready to make choices.  You treated Eve like it was a single player game.  Its changed, you haven't.  If these strategies are beyond you, I suggest you look at once of the other corporations with a bigger umbrella and join them.  At that point, you like to be led.  That is fine.  Its better to know what you like to do, and want to do, than get frustrated in a position that does not work for your gameplay or enjoyment.
---
Feel free to quit :)
---
Inconsistent leadership from the very top as usual. Sad!
---
Deep breaths.
---
The ships are just the ticket you use to have fun. Sometimes, your number is up and your ship goes boom.
---
I think part of it might be finding the right people to play with (not implying your corp/alliance at the time were "wrong").
---
Part of it is likely also finding a different activity to make your isk income, instead of null ratting in a 1B battleship.
---
Wtf did I just read?
---
Are you drunk dude?
---
Lucky you!
---
Do you have a killboard
---
That Procucer must have one hell of a tank to be able to withstand 90 bombers.
---
You just have to get used to losing ships.
---
Start small, welp some 5-10 mil worth ships, then 50 mil, then 100 mil. Soon 1 bil loss won't faze you.
---
We can't help how high you set your expectations
---
&gt; There is INSANE amounts of value in us doing one activity with 100% focus.
---
Good thing mining requires exactly 0 attention, so he can focus 100% on his math homework.
---
Loool. Youre cute!
---
yes i have considered that.  
---
But market seeding is an issue :D
---
Maybe I fail to make myself clear, I do understand WHY that happened. I find that "diplomatic incident" awkward.  Thats it.
---
Try one thing that helped me a lot when I began: fit a cheap Frig, go lowsec and go kamikaze to whatever frigate you see. Rinse and repeat a hundred times. You will overcome that handshaking that comes in fight, and get used to lose ships. And lowsec is the best place to learn real pvp. Not null, not WH. And I am a natural-born wormholer.
---
Also those afk eyes can have combat probes out and cycling as often as you remember to click it to further avoid surprises.
---
Oh u are my hero... lol gtfl
---
Yeah yeah i got that
---
No you see its not only goons that are the problem, its the tendency to blue up enemies at whatever chance people get in this game.
---
I d argue about that, puttinging your jobs in a random freeport is dumb. If you can show your corp azbel has been online for last months it will draw folks in and keep them in.
---
FYI: Renters were never paying to be safe from roamers. Landlords defend the sov and structures at most.
---
Finished, lessened my boredom, now back to mind numbing incursions :)
---
/u/sltyandsweet and I had our honorable 1v1 decided on reddit last night. He won but we have a rematch coming up
---
*yawn*
---
*anymore
---
Start with only going to Perimeter systems in an Invasion. It is best to run random fleets (4-8 ships) that show up in belts and structures to get a feel for how things work. Try to run the system when they first start up; i.e., "scouts are sighted". This is when they are at their weakest and fewest numbers. By the time a system level has been elevated to "conduits stabilized" or above, these wandering fleets will have become 2-4x more powerful and aggressive, especially in reinforcement waves.
---
Praxis and Rattlesnakes are the 2 main ships running solo for the random Triglavian fleets outside of conduits, although Marauders are also used. Missiles are preferred and drones are fine if run in the Perimeter systems.
---
While later on you can run the conduits solo in Perimeter systems, it appears you need more experience and ship experimentation with the Triglavians first.
---
Ah, i forgot. You have to assume totally that the ship that undocks, is a lost ship. Once you accept that, you will enjoy this game as fuck.
---
Add Glonn you can come join us.
---
Me and salty became friends last night after a 1v1, I'll fund you. 100m to start sound good?
---
So does everyone.
---
But that’s what happens when you have allies that aren’t pets.
---
Dude, they will chant their BS until they drop. Like every vital piece of data is showing a decline yet they are still insisting they are finding more targets. Even tho zkill itself is saying otherwise and thats without discounting the war.
---
How come no ones camping uejx!? Lift your game hunters.
---
You got a point there
---
I fucking love the Gnosis so much variety at such a low price if you're the kind of guy to never insure anything
---
Ahahahah, thank you very much!!!
---
No worries; no offense taken. I'm just speaking from my experience. I'm in a very small group that has a single constellation in PB, and I have been spinning a brand new alt in Rally Points sporadically while punching GOTG on my main. I've lost a few ships in the ratting alt (including losing one at the exact same time as ganking a carrier on my main, whoops), forced off several Strats, and been about 400m in the black on just bounties, plus quite a bit more than that after escalations (which I run on my main, but selling them would make bank too). The nice part about rally points is that they're so harmless that you can do a straight-up PVP fit without sacrificing much in clearance time vs. anything but smartbombing battleships. 6/10s escalations in Guristas space are quick to run and have a median drop of roughly 200m per site, with A-type drops pushing returns to 600ish or 1.3b+.
---
Come to whs, it's the bestest space anyway
---
Fit is not made to fight bigger stuff - it is made to run from big stuff - but still manage to tank quite well:   
---
There are some traits people miss about the Gnosis:  
---
It aligns in 4.2s ( that is cormorant level) giving it warp speed through rigs I can avoid fights that I do not want to take.  
---
Blue Pill with 2x XLASB gives me a lot of burst tank to get back to a gate if i happen to get into a gate camp.  
---
220mm ac cause I do like not being constricted by cap + tacking is good to dessys and some frigs if they get scramed
---
This. Start roaming in small ships like T1 frigs and cruisers and work your way up. Losing ships is part of Eve and in reality drives the whole game in a way. Find a way to have fun losing ships. You will get in those fights where the odds are against you and you just take who you can with you.
---
Last year one of the heads in our corp let out some \*autistic screeching\* after realizing that in the 1 HOUR he was afk, 3 of us managed to feed dreads on separate pvp roams haha
---
Well the statgates are operated by the empires, they inform the sov owners of ships passing through, there is a short story about this very thing in one of the eve magazines. 
---
So lore wise local should show any ship using the gate, but not those entering via wormhole or cyno.
---
I think it’s great. If you want to make null level ISK, you need actual risk. AFK ratting/mining for big ISK in null was stupid.
---
This is EVE, adapt or die.
---
that's just like, your opinion, dude.
---
Hey, you motherfucker eve players that spend more than an hour just gatecamping, wh camping, Jita-camping, or whatever boring activity you make in Eve! Just help this man with this study! Let's show the world what is the best mmo community in this planet! I will! 🙂
---
Oh wow, I forgot NPC null is same as Sov null.
---
People learn through mistakes and somehow they tend to forget that. You won't get better by ship spinning in station, and you definitely won't get better if you never take any chances and avoid all risk. Sure, it's hella fun when you are the one beating the crap out of the other side and not so much when it goes the other way around but... One time you suicide a whole fleet into that tanked battleship, next time you will know better and kite the shit outta that bastard.
---
By the way glad to see the good ole John still out there. New videos when? :&gt;
---
Yeah, being in alliance with frat drove me batshit crazy because everyone I shot be them red or neutral seemed to somehow be blue after diplo got involved.
---
Went through several 'alleged' botting regions like Omist, Malpais, Tenerifs, Detorid, didnt notice such glaring differences, apart from Period Basis. I didn't include Period Basis becuase because im not sure if some changes happened there or not.
---
What you are asking is so wide it s not possible to give a response. I would work on basics and work on your own indy and market then you will understand what to do instead of being told to by a random pleb on reddit.
---
I was thinking the same thing. there are lots of ships that get decent power spikes from even 1-2% more cpu
---
Loved the Farming bullet

&gt;The issue was never about grabbing SOV, especially if nobody else wants it, but to actually be able to use said SOV to grow. Doing things that you dont need an corp/alliance or SOV to do doesnt really fit into it. And btw, scannable DED sites are rare, no way you can sustain any larger group with them.
---
Blackouts kicking his ass, he refuses to try something different to get his corporation working again.  I gave him a list of things he can do to start getting his organization back on its feet.  
---
There is no secret here.
---
I have autism
---
Lol, so lowsec being shit otherwise is NS fault?
---
And lol, this is still a test. Dont get your hopes up.
---
A lot of corps will run kitchen sink fleets. Those are a good way to get used to losses as you go in not expecting to come out alive. I brought/gated a carrier in a fleet once. I'm honestly not sure how that thing is alive still since I'm a bad
---
Ahahahah! Thank you very much for this "call to arms" :) !
---
I mean, all it's doing is reversing the exodus to null that happened a couple of years ago. Most people who wanted low-risk farming were in high sec doing missions or mining and they're all coming back to hisec.
---
If it's any consolation, npc deaths are not counted in zkill statistics. Also, shit like this happens -  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/67362465/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/67362465/). People have lost 10s of billions just because they were sitting afk on a gate and forgot about it. So take a chill pill and relax.
---
Period Basis, would you like to answer this question?
---
I'm not atm at home, you can also add me Cunn Schell
---
Come now, the point isn't that one battle fit Proc will stop a bomber fleet.  It is that someone tried the very least and most basic step at not always being the prey.
---
Since a bunch of people are talking about mining in this thread, might as well drop the question. Is there any point in hi-sec mining anything other than velspar? It is the most common and seems to have the best isk return on ore charts? Am I just reading this shit wrong?
---
I mean, thats a lie but sure.
---
Ok "not all that often."  Point conceded.
---
If you notice my example there are no mobile cyno inhibs.  Bottom line is 526 sub-caps run from the titan in my example.  Yeah, you can try to kill off the fax or even a super if the pilot is stupid but generally the titan lives.  Caps have been too overpowered for a long time.  If i drop my titan in hostile space without support sure it'll die, but I want to see dropped titan's in friendly space have a good chance to die as well.  I know I'd enjoy killing one of the three titans sitting off a nullsec gate waiting to smart bomb or boson, with 20-30 "titan killer fit" bombers.  Who wouldn't?  You can have the last word, I'm done repeating myself.
---
🥳
---
Agreed, much better to just nerf the umbrella :\], when the super blocs stop producing huge amounts of everything the prices will adjust themselves and it would be worth more to the smaller groups.
---
Moon mining in higsec in orcas
---
Some interesting fits there (as well as some cheese fits =D).
---
I would say you missed a few things;
---
- LML Condor is far more common than its Rocket brother.
---
- No MASB Merlin or Kestrel? 
---
- No Adaptive invul Merlin?
---
- LML kite Hookbill is also viable.
---
Apart from that not bad at all.
---
Shut up retard
---
the blackout is the same, the ways you make money is the same...
---
But dude, thats what the guy is writing. How is a small corp gonna defend against that? Come on man.
---
You mixed botting with brains there buddy. Blackout killed ratting in null is all.
---
Imagine someone playing for fun and not for isk.
---
If you search for pvp you dont need Wh. From jita its like 10 jumps to gwt to one of the popoular FW places black rise.
---
Set a trap. You can do it!
---
Bad for your battery if you let it get below 10% consistently.
---
No its not. And NPC null is a lot emptier. Just because there are similarities doesnt mean its the same.
---
You decide to include it despite knowing that the service is regularly compromised by malware that might put your users at risk and still you say "I am not responsible"? Wow, I hope you are not writing software for a critical sector in your actual job.
---
Dude thank you for your time and effort in to making everyone else's eve-ing better.
---
We owe you almost as much as we owe ccp for all the fun we've had over the years. Thank you!
---
It looks like you can't supply 2 brain cells to rub together
---
But people weren't running their new instanced content when it had that important balance feature. So they removed it because they didn't want it to look like their new stuff was unpopular.
---
&gt;There's so much empty space now why would one rent. 
---
Because there's so much empty, good space to rent.
---
Yeah, wanting to rage quit is a familiar feeling in Eve. I've lost count how many times I've angrily decided to quit forever.  But the saddening thing is that the real quitting won't happen in rage: When I finally won Eve it was with a whimper, not a bang.
---
150 man nightmare fleet against 30 or 40 tengu/lokis
---
Good point on the fat and slow, but I did enjoy the EHP buffer.  But a roaming gang of T3’s could be very effective at running sites and out up a good fight in PVP.
---
Should be. It be a chatbot at it's base, not that hard to set up. Look up AIML and you can get some reasonably decent responses in it. Not really AI, but it's something you can set up in an afternoon (and will then spend the rest of your life trying to improve it, but oh well)
---
Use Firefox on Android. Install ublock origin. Problem solved.
---
yes and no, admittedly the big payout comes from loot drops but there is also blue loot (red loot?) that you can sell to NPCs with a fixed price.
---
And I think that's fine. Null sec was never supposed to be this super safe place that you can make ISK with almost no risk involved.
---
The problem is that high sec has more too many ways to make isk equal to that of null sec (burner missions, incursions, and abyssal sites). So people who want to make a lot of ISK no longer feel the need to do so in null sec, because now they have to risk their ships to do it. Where as in high sec they can do any of the above activities in virtual safety and make the same if not more ISK then they did AFK ratting (except they can't AFK anymore).
---
What CCP needs to do is nerf high sec income and bring back a reason for people to go to null.
---
It’s ironic how they’ve moved from null to high sec instead of lowsec. Null sec should be the most dangerous part of space followed by low sec followed by high sec. The balance was skewed before and your friends were evidence of that. I’m sorry they’ve left you but I’m glad nullsec is more dangerous again !
---
I know, I'm one of those big traders.  What we are talking about here, though, are two different situations:  traders using non-NPC markets to list buy orders, and also using them to put up goods for sale.  
---
There's little risk with buy orders; if the market gets popped, you're simply out the (low) brokerage fee and the time it took you to post the orders.  There's more risk for those listing goods for sale, but not a whole lot more risk - yes, it's a pain in butt to navigate asset safety and lose your (again, very low) brokerage fee and taxes, but you'd pay more anyway to list them at an NPC market, and you don't lose anything, you just need to wait for asset safety to run its course.
---
Most player-owned markets are relatively stable as long as they stay away from PLEX and injector trading, freeing them up for the buying and selling of hard goods.  It's generally not worth the big blocs' time and ammo to pop a structure that isn't cutting into their PLEX/injector trading anyway.
---
So, I come back to my initial position - I don't understand why non-PLEX traders, and industrialists/manufacturers in particular, don't make more extensive use of player-owned markets.  Fewer buyers/less visibility isn't a great argument, either; to paraphrase: "If you list it, they will come."
---
There is a sov war going on like 2 years or something provi is strong in eu timezone and trc/rc is strong in us time zone and they time zone tank each other with daily fights
---
Actually some of us are trying to create super cheap fits that one be caught by neutral, just eject out of the ship and docking in citadel, waiting for neutrals to go and come with new fits. But now we have to send some players to guard sites.
---
And yes, notification about ihub and TCU be reinforced and destroyed now
---
Boost non-sov related income, nerf income that rewards static, risk-averse play.
---
And as always, less stuff across the board. There's too much of everything in Eve right now, no one has a reason to contest anything.
---
Blackout didn't kill ratting.
---
It killed brainless, afk, riskless ratting.
---
You can still rat in null. Just be on comms, have backup from your corp mates and be ready to fight when you get tackled. You will get some great fights. Some of them you will win, some of them you will lose. As it should be.
---
You are saying often. I wont go into detail but by no means on the level you are speaking of.
---
Well if you havent brought a mobile cyno to kill something with a cyno then you are crappy. No they dont need to do that. And 2 full fleets are not 526 but 512.
---
And try to kill the fax, with that amount its not trying, its killing. Dude, you are so overly estimating these ships its not even funny. 
---
Ofc you would. Cause you dont wont to actually put anything worth risking on the line. You want to kill a 70b isk ship with a couple of billion and moonwalk out. And you think thats fair.
---
Finally.
---
*clone
---
Fey is still rented out
---
&gt; afk
---
&gt; riskless
---
Pick one
---
Blackout killed many activities in null. For now I am still answering alliance pings.
---
The ingame browser was so useful  because of its integration with the game.
---
Sounds like perpetual fun!
---
Frat didn't shoot PH. But did shoot legacy, the coalition they are at war with. In this case legacy worked together with PH for the same objective.
---
Are t1 abyssal sites profitable? I'm doing them to practice was just wondering if they are profitable.
---
Our leader said that preparation is still better, especially the region saw many activities before BO. Btw thanks
---
Love how you keep getting downvoted by butthurt null bears. I know the Wormhole life. Nullbears have no local... and that's it. They lost 1 damned tool and they're all crying. Null was too safe
---
"It killed ~~brainless, afk, riskless~~ ratting."
---
Non-Super-Umbrella Ratting
---
You're wrong and I FTFY.
---
They should backtrack their backtrack and chalk it up to the invasion.  T4/5 suspect-free in HS is bad.
---
Why are you writing it to me. Cause you are not responding to what I said but what someone else said. And everything you are saying is exactly what people, including me, have been saying will happen with the blackout. That its far worse for smaller groups than bigger and you are saying exactly the same.
---
The problem here is the blackout, not a lack of options.
---
Agreed
---
Always prepare for the worst but hope for the best!
---
Blackout is hitting provi bad tho reading the allance mails about membership quitting eve is fun
---
They never shoot blue. They did shoot the guys who were working together with the blue guys ( but also the guys they have a large scale war going on )
---
Don’t 
---
Highsec industry mining corps are the bane of this game, if you have to ask this on Reddit you shouldn’t try and make a Corp. go join a nullsec alliance or something and learn the game
---
Gemini Whale was responsible for a ton of those ratting numbers on the Dek side, and as best anyone can tell were 100% bots.
---
Its mostly just the supers in particular titans that need a nerf atm.  Not all caps.
---
&gt; Solo PVP....
---
&gt; Posts kill of PVE BS
---
Ahem.
---
We at WiNGSPAN Delivery Services are decidedly NOT pirates. While we might (OK we do) partake of a bottle of rum or grog from time to time, our full-time gig is as Delivery Agents, specializing in the covert provision of ammunition and drone parties to customers throughout New Eden, but particularly in wormhole space.
---
We do not talk like pirates, have beards with flaming candles in them (tho that would be cool), or walk with peg legs. 
---
We want to make you content, not walk the plank.  That is all.
---
Looks like they’re not starved at all considering they’re actually getting content.
---
put scan
---
Dude the ad appeared on the guys dick. He’s scared ok?
---
Not everyone is as reasonable as you on the internet.
---
If you consider repeating that same retarded bullshit over and over again I'm really sorry for you, but to each its own I guess vOv
---
Detox can be a painful process when fighting an addiction.
---
Tbh hunting ships are bad at actual pvp so if you are actively being hunted just bait the guy and kill him.
---
This is how had to be from the beginning. Carebears should be in hisec, low risk, low isk. Those who remain in nullsec, should be the brave and well-organised fleet pvpers and FCs that can crush any structure in a single fleet, those who can call to arms a hundred of well-trained pilots, and not a thousand skill-injected capital pilots. Lowseccers should be those who can fight 1 versus 10, destroy them and go victorious in an epic battle, because of their awesome pvp experience. And wormholers should be those who can kill anything anywhere, just 1 second after the victim notices them;and go everywhere in Eve just with anybody noticing it, just for the joy of destruction. And I think that eve is becoming this after blackout, and I am having fun as I never did before in New Eden.
---
Am I undervaluing my time? Dammit....

---
If you think GotB was pumping TAPI level MER numbers without botting with 1/4th of the active member numbers then I have a bridge to sell you.
---
Even with super umbrella you'd need to be in a supercap yourself or you'll likely die before the cavalry arrives.
---
Cant say bad things. It brought actual risk to more risk adverse null regions. Sorry Provi is losing members bro
---
Fit your ship for a bit of PvP and undock.  Makes ratting a bit more fun when you can get a fight out of it.
---
You actually made me sad by reading this. Wow dude, I wasnt expecting something like this on this sub.
---
Renting income went down by 2/3 in my experience. But that's partly due to hostile campaigns. Purely from blackout it went down by around half.
---
Abusive relationships are the best. Never feel more alive, until you drop dead cause you got stabbed.
---
how big? Cant see it, i am at work atm
---
Actually i want more pve rn
---
True enough.
---
Fade should have a drastic impact as well.  The bot VNIs were pretty bad prior to blackout and some have tried fitting three warp core stabs since.  But we've been able to stop a majority of it in Fade.  Will be nice to see MER for July for these regions.
---
I mean he's solo, and he's a player, and he killed another player. So that's like the definition of solo pvp.
---
Just because he killed a carebear doesn't mean it's not pvp. It might not be quality pvp, I'll give you that, but it is solo PvP.
---
Eve sux now,  but atleast we have Warframe.
---
Get baited, enemy open the cyno, zkill open his cyno, jump right into zkill's cyno then live forever there

Dude, it's a free website run by a guy in his spare time, not a freaking career.

---
You have to hit refresh one out of every 12 page views you poor thing you.  LIterally unplayable.

You're entitled to NOTHING.

Good shit doombunny.  Also +1 for logi perspective.  Its always humbling to see the perspective of an actually good logi pilot that knows how to de-cycle reps in anticipation of the next broadcast.
---
Praise Bob!
---
And thats why iphones are trash
---
Taxation also.
---
Please re-add text comments, the upvote system isn't enough.
---
Let's be honest, most of the isk generating activities in the game are extremely boring and repetitive. If you can't do them in a casual way why do them at all.
---
Sure, that will be ready by 2025
---
So scan hsec wormholes. And you can dip into wh space again.
---
Ive been wanting to try it. Would you recommend?
---
i read it as 2000 accounts spread over Elo's entire group of members. So 20 here 20 there it all adds up. In that case many would be likely to use their accounts for other industry activities as well as the skill farm.
---
Plat payout of 58M
---
*small corp*
---
Over 500 members and larger than 98% of all eve corporations...
---
Thats so very true.
---
I always hated the "git gud" response and I won't give it now.
---
But that is the point of Null.  If you want the rewards you can try to get better at some aspect where you are deficient.  Get more numbers.  Learn to be better at defense.  Join a better rental group, putting up with the cost, crowds, etc.  Try to imporve your own intel network with some cloaky alts on gates.   Find fits, tasks or income sources where the reward outweighs the risk.    Lobby CCP to nerf the umbrella so there are more "other-than-you" people for those bombers to hunt.  
---
The problem is that people got to thinking that the only thing unsafe about Null was that you didn't have a Concord response, but you still got to reap all the benefits of expensive rocks and ratting.  To the point that the rocks aren't worth as much anymore.  ( I think a hold of Veldspar is one of the most expensive in-game at the moment!)
---
Frat showed up somewhere they had no business being on the opposite side of a BR from their allies without any kind of heads up or disclosing anything about their plans.
---
Great that they didn’t actually shoot PH, just third partied on Legacy.
---
Less great that they completely failed to illustrate that fact to anyone outside of themselves meaning nobody knew who else they would shoot or why.
---
Again, minor diplomatic incident. Incident resolved.
---
I never stated they increase spawn rate in REGION, I'm just saying I had them installed across region \[" I upgraded half of the region with those just to check their impact. "\]. I just share my experience with them. From what i saw effects of Entrapment Array are system wide, not constellation wide. But if you have some hard data from CCP that says otherwise please share it, I'm sure a lot of people would like to know more. \[well, maybe not now because if blackout :/ \]  
---
And please show me on map all those systems with military lvl5 currently

[http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Tribute#adm](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Tribute#adm)
---
I really don't see much ratting north. Some RR pockets in Tenal and Branch maybe, but those are big grups that will drop capitals on 3man Kiki gang. Subcap ratting looks pretty dead, so is farming DED sites in small alliances without capital umbrella .
---
Roughly how much can a typical null block mining fleet boost an excavator or exhumer’s efficiency by, percentage wise?
---
“They never shoot blue” is categorically false for every alliance in the game.
---
Nobody is a mind reader.
---
You should be overpricing initial time slots over ongoing intervals (because any context switch must be charged to someone, it might as well be the person causing the switch). Which means they should have received between 15-20seconds for that .50c.
---
Yeah I'm working 12 hours today. 9.5 left so I can't yet
---
Keep Asset Safety.
---
Mommy and daddy had an argument, but they kissed and made up.
---
&gt; nullsec reward
---
where is this? since blackout the Risk far outweighs the reward for anyone who doesn't have multiple rorqs under an umbrella or a super who is also under an umbrella.
---
You quit cus you lost a bill? Lmfao how thin skinned do you have to be?
---
Link!
---
Null level isk .... you mean doing completely safe T4/5s in highsec?
---
You dont owe me shit, if anything we, the community owe you for the service you provide
---
I've been afk ratting since the blackout. Only got dropped on once and they over landed in my site and weren't able to get me.
---
I got dropped on a lot more often with local back when we were in Geminate.
---
I still like blackout and still hope it's a permanent change.
---
If the video had comms you'd hear tiana calling out exactly when to cycle on/off people, even before the pilot being shot broadcasted for reps :)
---
origin logi best logi

How does the "I don't care about you using adblock" fit together the popup you show people who have adblock enabled to ask them to turn it off: [https://i.imgur.com/poo9HEA.png](https://i.imgur.com/poo9HEA.png) (that URL is almost poophead :().
---
Do the experimental ads mean you will show more than two basic adsense ads per page? One of the big reasons I run an adblocker is because I've previously had issues with whitelisted sites redirecting mostly my mobile devices to random exploit kits and assorted spam and porn websites.
---
Not trying to attack you but if you want to just shoot shit and have fun maybe try out lowsec or hisec, or even WHs. Or just accept you're going to die at some point.
---
alts...
---
Nobody likes you.
---
I guess we are a medium size Corp, or a small alliance consisting of 1 Corporate. However you want the split hair to trigger you I suppose..
---
We all have embarrassing moments - it's part of the game, and part of being human. Don't worry about what the world sees on ZKB - what penalty is there, even if you had a page full of losses?
---
Just get out there, fly what you enjoy more, and what gives you anxiety less - this is your game, and you should play it your way.
---
its a mutual relationship website &lt;&gt; users, the users willingly give their kill apis. zkill would be nothing without its userbase
---
The devaluation of minerals doesnt have to do with the blackout as a standalone thing.  The devaluation of minerals is more directly tied to Titans and Supers being impossible to overcome as a defensive force in critical mass numbers coupled with Rorq mining being incredibly efficient.  The other factor that applies here is the moon mining changes spreading regular minerals throughout all areas and sectors of space and making it easier to get all of them across the board.  If you want minerals to go back up you need to either nerf supers (titans more specifically.) or reverse the minerals to be security space specific.  (I would do one or the other at this point and not both.)  
---
On the flip side, I think that there should be away to detect cloakers better as I think outside of super umbrellas and supers the ability to make money in null has been hit too hard ( with subcaps more specifically.)
---
Sent you evemail

GUYS I CAN'T FARM SUPERS EASILY ANYMORE

It's the same mechanics in regards to risk with even less potential reward.
---
&gt; 6. Have you continued your gaming activity despite knowing it was causing problems between you and other people? 
---
That... is a ***REALLY*** dangerously stacked question and I am seriously concerned about what it's doing in the middle of an information-gathering survey.
---
There are battle report tools with the ability to do more then 2 sides ;*)
---
After the first couple of minutes sets the scene, I'd skip ahead to https://youtu.be/W6rPwbLe7jk?t=465
---
I should try that on my boss just to see his reaction
---
That seems to sum it up pretty well
---
Embrace and own your losses especially the high cost ones.  You're gonna lose ships - hiding from it doesn't work.  Laugh about it, you'll get ribbed about it, so what.  As long as you have fun and you learn something from it, the loss is just a stepping stone.
---
Concord operates gates and allows for taxes. Seems like Concord does have some influence over null sec. So if you dont want Concord in NS, give tax and gate controll over to the sov holders. Problem solved.
---
If local was keeping you alive you don't have the mindset or skill to be in null.
---
As a fellow dev i concur with the above
---
I mean Tribute literally just got reset like a month ago..and you are shocked it doesn’t have a bunch of 5 military adm systems?
---
All regions but delve now only have a few heavily ratted areas. And this is a good thing. The ingame inflation was out of control, and no losses mattered to people or groups. 
---
Maybe the problem before was ratting was too safe and effortless before and now it’s not?
---
flair checks out
---
My heart weeps for you, it truly does.
---
Nah, you're just a salty scrub. Settle down.
---
Alts and pi toons probably. Just look at their active pvp numbers to get a feel of how many they actually have. Still pretty damm impressive to get were they are. Havent been connected to them yet cant wait though.
---
There’s also allies who don’t show up to strategic timers to interfere where they don’t belong just for frags.
---
What’s your point?
---
Thing is, this is exactly why people join blobs. And since CCPs intention is to make it easier for smaller groups then this is directly counter productive to their vision.
---
I mean, at some point we have to understand that we cant eat the cake and still have it. We cant hail solutions that further the blue donut whilst shaming said donut. Right?
---
Good riddance. See ya!
---
Why even bother with renting?  If it's all as soon and gloom as people keep stating then there should be plenty of space with low ADMs available.  I'd expect the renter alliances to be targeted a bit more as most roaming groups know the region(s) to go when looking for content.
---
Try staging out of NPC null and poke a few low ADM systems that aren't being used. You may get an initial response, but most likely the entity controlling the space is overextended and may give it up after a while rather than dealing with you guys repeatedly.
---
There's plenty of space available and as Caspar mentioned, you can help mitigate your risk using a few different tactics.
---
Just posting this from a few days ago from myself in another reddit post:  
---
The biggest things you need are:
---
1) \*\*Activity\*\* - stuff to do, people playing the game. This might be obvious, but can't be understated. Recruiting new pilots is important. In german we have a saying that goes "Schwund ist immer." which basically means that "there is always some dwindling". You need content, content creators, if there is none, create it yourself. Maybe search allies that can provide content or help if you need. Support every content there is, until there is too much of it (never happens though) If you're small, there are a lot of bigger entities that would love to help you.
---
2) \*\*Identity\*\* - some kind of "speciality" that speaks to a certain group of people. Doesn't mean you have to specialize hardcore to just one thing, but you should have a goal or a mantra or sth going for you
---
3) \*\*Trust\*\* - This means transparency in what you do, too. People wanna know what's going on and feel valued and involved. I don't think I need to write more about trust.
---
4) \*\*Endurance\*\* - not the ship, but the character trait. There will be failures. A lot of them. All the time. There will be criticism. There might be thiefs, spies, bitter ex members, traitors and people you dislike. There will be drama, losses, setbacks and a million small mistakes. You need to navigate through it, be calm and learn from it but never give in. Be brave and know that it will be hard. But it will be worth it if you push through.
---
5) \*\*A Home\*\* - Have 1 (not multiple) places, where your pilots are based and feel safe and at home. This is one of the most underrated points in my opinion. Having something to call your own (systems or at least a station) makes things feeling way more important and meaningful. You have something to defend and lose now, which brings you together.
---
6) \*\*Network\*\* - always broaen your network. You can never have too many friends and contacts. You don't need to be blue to everyone to be a friend.
---
\*\*Activity &gt; Identiy &gt; Trust &gt; Endurance &gt; Home &gt; Network\*\* - in this order! AITEHN!
---
Everything else is nice to have, or a bonus, attractive even to a special type of player. It's not easy. But I have done it myself, so I know it's possible. Also a nice catchy name surely is helping.
---
We joke around a lot with our alliance name and create all types of stuff around it. Not gonna happen with "\[ESAFCABINSSA\] English Speaking Academy for Combat and Business in Null Security Space Alliance"
---
Sick burn dude.
---
You don't like the way some dude runs his hobby website, don't give him your apis. Easy. Zkill is a great service.

---
I 100% agree solo PvP is not dead, the problem isn't that the content isn't there, it's just people don't look in the right places, or don't know how to handle blobs that come their way. Unfortunately EVE is in a place where all of the major nullsec blocs have concentrated around their particular staging hubs (ie. Goons around 1DQ, Test around D-P in Eso and 08- in Immensea, Horde in R1O in Kalevala, etc. etc.) and really just the insta-dock krabs live in the outer farmed systems of any given region. Now bear in mind I am talking about the more pvp-prone pilots of any given major nullsec alliance, not the krabs who will occassionally jump into a carrier to dunk 2 or 3 frigates. 
---
There are a lot of really good fights to be had, and often it takes you killing a krab in or near someone's staging to get them to come fight back. Yes, if you go to someone's staging and poke them, expect a blob, but it's how you handle the blob that defines your own content. If you decide to stay on grid with 20 people in their staging and cry you got blobbed, then you deserve it. If you burn a couple jumps to see which of that blob actually has the thirst for some content, you'll get yourself some great fights.
---
But as you said, it takes undocking, and with the way alliances are spread out, unless you have access to a nice jumpbridge network, expect to burn a few jumps to find it. I personally am a huge fan of Thera right now. Constantly changing connections and even if you don't get one into the region you want directly, chances are a connection is close to it, and a fantastic service like [EVE-Scout.com](https://EVE-Scout.com) can make it that much easier for you with pre-scanned signatures.
---
Good shit.
---
If we do im going straight for jeff raider and try to ransom his pod for a new jeff raider podcast lol
---
As long as you're fine with being supported with isk, and I get to adblock without the site borking, I'm gucci. Thanks for the work you put into this stuff.
---
~~Blackout~~ Shit Leadership is Kicking our Ass. FTFY
---
Dread Alt, Dictor Alt, Scanner Alt, Fax Alt(s), Super Alt.
---
Gotta have em if you want a small corp to thrive.
---
What makes a ship instadock?
---
But then you are no longer a solo BS.
---
EVE is a sandbox, and it allows you to do great many things. I'd say that you should start a new character and run through all the tutorials so you get the basics down.
---
After that, pick a career you're interested in, and try and find a corporation that specializes in that career. And see if you like it. If you do, great. If not pick a different one and try that. Keep doing it until you find something you like the most and do that.
---
You can always train for a new career later if you decide to switch. And the more skills you train the more you'll be able to do.
---
I dont really get your point.
---
Uh r64 moons?
---
Thanks for your concern, which makes absolutely sense! This question is part of a pre-built scale that has been tested and validated by other researchers in terms of structure, order, and wording. In essence, they found it reliable and effective in measuring attitudes (positive as well as negative) toward gaming.
---
Npc null is for plebs. You have to be dumb to live there. Like the krabbing isn’t even good. If those people were smart they would live in sov null. But they can’t live in sov null bc black out is bad for small alliances. 
---
There’s no point playing this game if you can’t afk vni Rat to Plex your accounts while you mine with your rorqs so you can build your 4th titan so you can flex on some stupid nano kitey fags like Rote Kapelle
---
You are right. Will post an updated image.
---
Perhaps mechanics but that theoretical and not practical. In reality its not the same.
---
I really wish theyd do this.
---
Shame you don't want to accept donations. I would gladly donate through something like patreon. 
---
I know why you run the ads and I would too, but because of the bad actors you mentioned adblock doesn't go off for anyone. Has nothing to do with the site owners and everything to do with Google's inability to guarantee their ads aren't letting malware slip through.
---
I have no idea what WH your corp lives in and what statics you have, but it doesn't take a long time to train up into a Gila do PvE that you say you want to do.
---
Also no idea what doctrines your corp uses, but if they took you in, I'm sure they have some newbie friendly ship fits that you can use in their PvP fleets. Maybe it's just tackle and ewar, but in WH every member is important.
---
Did you try asking your CEO, hey, what can I do to help you guys in pvp right now?
---
That's not that much tbh, and why the fuck would you be ashamed of losing a ship in a game known to be about that?
---
Ships are tools, you use them till they breake and pick anotherone... just don't fly what you can't afford to lose and learn to laugh about your losses (the stupid ones above all).
---
Welcome back o7
---
Im not a renter so I dont know their reasoning.
---
I've never watched Futurama does that make me a bad eve player?
---
You are a good man. Love you so much.
---
If you say so, then it must be true. Thank you :p
---
Yep. Null sec was safer than high sec, especially once you took suicide ganking and baiting into account. NS also provided more isk.  It's a perverse outcome.
---
The extra 3 seconds was complimentary to read the offer.
---
Yeah them not being able to get back into your drone bay because they're too fast is annoying.
---
Totally right, ADM dont lie.
---
Outer Passage was a haven for BOTS but they seem to have gone the way of the dodo since blackout.
---
And give me all your stuff!
---
I'll just mark this response as a reading comprehension mistake and move on.
---
&gt;the risk/reward of the abyssal sites.
---
Isn't this a self-solving problem though? One of the major issues before was the null ratting that was too safe and rewarded direct ISK. Abyssal sites have inherent risk of losing your ship and the rewards are purely in item form, requiring trading with other players as well as lowering reward as more people do it.
---
So as more and more people move to abyssal sites, wouldn't the reward just lower and make some people leave it for other things again until it finds an equilibirium?
---
Can confirm
---
Hahaha
---
R/eve isnt tech support. Take a downvote
---
We have 150 mains in waffles, 113 with kills so far in august. 486 chars in total. 
---
Not too bad given a few are still on vacation.
---
You're right there. Everyone in waffles does their best, 200 percent, and this includes the use of alts which frankly speaking everyone uses if you want to git gud in the game.
---
Why alpha indy toons?
---
150 mains
---
Yeah no other corps have alts.
---
&gt;I 100% agree solo PvP is not dead, the problem isn't that the content isn't there,
---
The content is actually the problem. Solo definitely died when people gave up on FW. There is simply no solo content in the game.
---
&gt;it's just people don't look in the right places, or don't know how to handle blobs that come their way. 
---
How is that not unfalsifiable? If you are in anything brawly, its just a matter of time until you get dropped.
---
Yodik confirmed Mad Lad
---
Dude, these guys are hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiilarious. They get super butthurt if you poke their bubble.
---
CCP appears to want everybody in a blob, so of course solo dies.
---
BLACKOUT IS GREAT FOR HUNTING BECAUSE THEY CANT SEE ME COMING 
---
BLACKOUT IS SHIT FOR HUNTING CAUSE KRABS ARE LEAVING SO GETTING LESS TARGETS 
---
FUCKKKK JUST GIVE ME MORE DUMB RETARDS TO SHOOT SO I CAN PAD MY KILLBOARD AND CIRCLE JERK WITH MY FRIENDS
---
He is a tool. He is trying to deny his members content just because a couple volta dudes are in fleet. 
---
As bad a mittens now days I think.
---
Hopefully not.
---
Yep. Supporting blues during the old structure grind days, one calls out neutral on grid with the bash fleet. Warp near the bash fleet to try to take care of it, neutral leaves system as I land and blues start shooting at me.
---
Stop recruiting cowards and instill in your pilots a better mentality. This is on you and the leadership, not the blackout. Had this been an invasion that you were losing you'd get the same results.
---
I have nothing much respect for the guys.
---
They actually have been very patient with me.
---
But i have like 1 month and half of the gane(and i was away on vacations so..even less).
---
I love Wh i just feel that i need more time to learn some more stuff. Like yesterday they wanted to roll the WH and i was on nita buying stuff..i miss being able to do that ..we dont always have route to HS.
---
Little things like that you know..i now eventually i will just live in WH. I feel that rn i will gain more if i day tripp. Atleast while i get pvp skills
---
And you won't get anywhere with google either if they are ever contacted about issues like this. :P
---

Please do move on. Because I doubt you have anything relevant to say.

I like waffles
---
You're going to leave wh space so that you can come back to it repeatedly.. presumably because you aren't good at PvP?
---
Don't what you're saying won't make a difference- you'll still be playing in wh space whether you live in whs or in hs. So it's silly to make it not inconvenient on yourself to find whs constantly.
---
I remember making over 200m/hr running t3 darks. Now I think it's the same level as running level 4s, which makes sense. Not worth doing though.
---
Something something blue donut
---
Just did a check. We have around 150 real members, so yeah 70% of the corp are alts.
---
You rage quit because of this?   If your corp/alliance cares about a loss like this, find a new one.
---
Damn you're right, I'll add that.
---
Seems a bit odd to want to offset the cost but not want to accept donations, but oh well. Personally i do run adblocker to avoid various kinds of malware, i'll just live with the annoying pop-up to disable ads.
---
Just don't go the typical shitty route of hiding the entire page unless ads are confirmed to have loaded, because that is pure cancer. :P
---
then just stay in your wormhole corp
---
As a heads up, pvp is in all spaces of Eve
---
Grab a T1 explo ship, magnate or heron are my preferred recommendations, and just start jumping into wormholes. Hit all the relic sites, and data if you wanna hit them too, learn to spam dscan, learn to continually bookmark whs and safes, and do so until someone blows you up, then repeat. This will help you learn the ropes of wormholes be the least damaging to your wallet if you're new.
---
If you want something along the lines of ratting, grab a drake with passive shield regen and then hop into all the C1s and C2s you can find and rat until your ship gets destroyed and repeat until you stay alive
---
I did this initially while basing out of my corp's C2. I lost a decent chuck of explorers, but I got the hang of it quickly while running explo.
---
fly safe o7
---
That was one of the best eve videos I’ve seen in a while.
---
#repsquadBestSquad
---
Ccp talked about updating bookmarks so they could be shared easier. Can’t find out when this is due! Anybody know?
---
Yes. :( It would be a good replacement for the corporate/personal hangar array he is asking for. It's also a pain that you can practically only share your BPOs with people if you are a CEO and they are in your corp. Otherwise you have to either trust your CEO and directors enough to lend the corp the BPOs or you need to trust the persons enough that you directly lend them. Hangars with similar concepts like currently in developement for bookmarks would be very nice there. But baby steps.
---
I believe blackout is a good thing for eve, however with most things CCP does, they only do one fix, when they need to do a number of other things in tandem with blackout. They didn't do anything to with spreading resources out and reducing the consolidation of them. They also should of gotten rid of nullification. It would at least give defenders a chance to prevent potential hunters from getting in their space. Currently however any cepter or nullified t3c can freely move within space without threat of being caught. Take that away and you allow smaller groups to at least attempt to bubble their space and prevent aggressors from coming in.
---
You make a post about solo PvP is easy and your "example" kill is popping some ratter?
---
Hunting ratters is PvE+ at best.
---
Your post highlights how bad the state of solo PvP is - you think it's cool to pop ratters. 
---
I mean blow them up for sure, but... That's the kill you choose to use at your example?
---
KRAB HUNTING SHOULD BE RENAMED TO PVK, PLAYER VS KRABS
---
\#repsquadBestSquad
---
Survey Scanner? This is still pointless. Save a location 155km from the nearest asteroid. Survey scan.. find the good one, warp 3200km from it.
---
Remove survey scanner? Okay warp to the one you think is biggest. Repeat till find a good one.
---
Don’t make it where you can save locations near annons? Warp at 100 or 0 and fit a cap Microwarp. (Burn away and warp to the good ones or just burn to a good rock).
---
A lot of people just gave up and stopped logging in.
---
The problem is, the player comes out and has no realistic chance to defend themselves as a suspect against a gang of dudes waiting outside. At least in null, low, friends could support you. No one can come assist you in hisec if you have a suspect timer.
---
No ship is completely safe when it’s in space.
---
Dunno what's so hard about hitting d-scan and staying alert. Lots of newbros run sites in wormholes and don't cry.
---
As I've been away for 8 months, is blackout of local comms a temporary situation related to an in-game event or is it the new normal?
---
I think what he means is he won’t block browsers using adblockers (like many sites do) or come on r/eve and bitch about people turning on adblockers. 
---
Imo a *very* gently worded single time pop up isn’t off message with that.
---
You might be right. I would like to bring my orca to the whole..but cant.
---
I would like to buy new ships just for the fun..most of the times i cant..its just the hurdle of living there you know
---
I'd also love to see that fit, I've got V's across the board in a Loki and I'm about 3 weeks out from a Tengu though I'd like to try to run some 10/10s now.
---
There never was a bot problem. CCP used it to push their propaganda and everyone ate that shit right up.
---
Im not afraid of losing them..im afraid that i dont have the commodity of hub to buy more lol.
---
I for one go out soloing all the time. 
---
I am objectively bad at it. but I solo.
---
OP not waking up during the English lessons.
---
Nothing wrong with an easily dismissable reminder. And if it bothers you that much get off the internet and go outside? :)
---
Join in game channel "triglav defense" these guys have been doing it well. Basically you web the crap out of em.
---
So, you want more structures where people can tether? The current issue with the structures is that we use them as friggin' gate obeservables in the nullsec blocks. That's what people talk about when they talk about structure spam.
---
Are shitty null, FW etc. corps much better?
---
Of course baiting doesn't equal hunting? 
---
They are entirely different things.
---
They are about as similar as the fat dude with a Miller lite and a fishing pole on the back of his boat is to the spearfisher freediving and climbing into holes while chasing off sharks to get his kill.
---
Curious : How many people a month try to interact with you as if you are CCP and work for them?
---
If losing 1b was that painful, I would stick to cheap ships.
---
You saved me 20mins of dying at work, thank you
---
Like heroin and cigarettes kinda addictive.
---
&gt; right now
---
it was always that way, if an equally skilled but numerically lower force could beat someone in the opponent's own turf there would be a pretty glaring balancing issue
---
Muy bueno
---
Renting is dead.
---
its annoying even if i white list zkill, it still brings up the nag screen,  there are workarounds but i cba, its meaningless nonsense
---
Arguably, giant nullsec alliances are more of a bane of this game than highsec industry. If OP enjoys playing the game a certain way, there's no inherent reason to tell them they shouldn't do it. Eve is a sandbox, "the game" you point at could be an aspect other players simply don't enjoy and avoid.
---
Dude, legit highlight for me that ya responded to a post of mine o7
---
Mmm, nope. I guess you never saw the bots simultaneously warp to tether as soon as you can into local? Do you think someone was behind those keyboards? Do you think they were at risk?
---
OP gets it. 
---
Don’t be afraid of dying and suddenly content is everywhere
---
When scanning around Tribute/Venal you find a DED every couple systems. Probably should take it from someone living in the north rather than some goonie.
---
baiting is an element of hunting. If you're hunting a krab, sure, you don't need bait because they'll be out running missions or anoms or whatever. But if you're hunting other hunters and pvpers how else would you get them to undock and put their stuff on the line? Also the man has hundreds of blops and multiple AT ships under his belt, there is no better hunter.
---
So your a new player, who doesnt have the "magic 14" and cannot sit in cruisers, yet you have an orca?
---
Nothing is impossible. I can play eve from a cellphone, and instantly acess the world from anywhetr.. Why fuck cant they program a working  dscan lmao.
---
Ahahah, you are welcome! Thank you!
---
A lot of people roll for profit. I don't know if they make much from it but I can definitely say there is hella demand for even above average rolls.
---
Wrong idiot!
---
Those were obviously real people that stopped playing. 
---
Get your narrative sorted out before you post next time please.
---
Not all of us live under an umbrella. Holy shit yall are so mad.
---
This may be a little late, but it takes a while to actually destroy a citadel in highsec (1-2 weeks depending on the reinforcement timers). There’s also an asset safety system where you can get your assets from the citadel back if you lose access to it or if it’s destroyed. It takes 5 days to get the assets if you go collect them at a station in the same system, or 30 days if you let it automatically go to the nearest station. Feel free to pm me or send an evemail to Razeleao if you have any questions. Some of my friends also run a highsec corp if you are looking for somewhere to go. We have a lot of people mining, daytripping in wormholes, and do almost daily frigate pvp roams in lowsec. (Ships can be provided for free)
---
Yes...i bought some stuff on discount at steam and used skill points on that..i know..im stupid haha
---
The only reason we shot you really was because your core systems were perfect midpoints to multiple keepstars.
---
Yt tutorials
---
The method I mentioned of get something cheap that will work, like T1 frigs for explo or pvp, are phenominal as it teaches loss quickly, you mentioned this isn't an issue, and they're cheap. If run outta ISK doing this or would like a fit then message me here or in game.
---

Are you the guy on that YouTube video squealing all over his room because his parents took away his Xbox? 
---
Grow up dude. Why do you need Reddit to tell you if you should play a game.
---
&gt; easily dismissable reminder
---
"Would you kindly" is not easily dismissable  =)
---
Same tbh
---
How is this without risk? If you come out of an abyssal site in high sec you still aren’t immune from 30 catalysts descending upon you.
---
Blackout was the first time I bothered to even try solo hunting.. Started with Loki has its been what we have been blobbing on..
---
Turns out I had a shit load to learn and I'm greedy and easily tricked, can't help but take obvious baits but I swear to Bob that it's been seriously fun! I always make sure to hang around in my pod to give a GF in local and let them know I realise what I did wrong this time.
---
Shout out to our Dino bros.. Been a heap of fun messing with you guys!
---
I loved my early days. A time of innocence in awe of the galactic scale and a magical sense of wonder.
---
Then the horror years being in either small corps where nothing happened and no one logged in or giant corps where I need to spend 8 hours a day logged in, never having enough time, Isk or skills to get the correct ship doctrines, constantly moving my entire set of ships to the ever changing staging areas.... aarghhh!!!
---
A decade after starting.... I'm finally happy :)
---
There really is nothing mechanic wise that prevents people from undocking and going out hunting. People always give the excuse that all your hunting is pve ships. Thats not the case, I remember when you would get a fleet together to just roam and then run into other roaming fleets and get fights that way. There really is no mechanic preventing this except us the players just not undocking and going out. I think one of the issue is just risk aversion and fear of losing ships. I know, I'm still trying to get over that, but I'm slowly learning being risk averse really isn't fun and going out and looking for fights is. So please if you want pvp, just undock and go out, you may die a few times but it will be fun and you will learn and get better.
---
You could extract that and re-inject the points into better skills at no loss because you are still under the skill point loss margin I would imagine. The orca is neat but if you want to mine there are much better options for yourself as a new player that wont hit your bank so hard with the loss, and I would also assume you do not have the command boosting skills for it.
---
Give ECM ships extra high slots and make ECM high slot module.
---
I'm not mad at all.  Don't even live in wormholes anymore.  But the myth of "perfectly safe crabbing in C5 space" is just that - a myth.
---
Jeez how old is this? Horde hasn't had sov in that area in a long time.
---
It just means you weren’t meant to be there. Wormholes are safer than nullsec, you should try tk move there.
---
Have you ever flown in TiDi?  Imagine the server load if every pilot in Eve was spamming d scan, automatically, every second.  "lmao" you're an idiot if you can't understand why that would cause crushing lag and server load.
---
I am new to the game, but as far as I can tell, invasions are only group content. When they show up in my system it just means I don't get to play Eve for a couple days. I really wish you could suspend your sub for those days, it sucks to be paying for a game you can't play - but I guess that's what Alpha account alts are for.
---
Shut
---
It sounds like you hate pve gameplay
---
CCP has indicated the blackout will last indefinitely, and that they're continuing to monitor and may make more changes as they feel appropriate.
---
There was an event related to the Triglavian invasion where CONCORD pulled back their resources from nullsec, thereby removing local. I would expect that if CCP decides to reinstate local (or a version of it), they'll include some lore warning.
---
It's not been made official one way or another but it's a pretty safe bet that it's now the normal..
---
My point is its GREAT that you're finding it hard to farm for larger ships.
---
Null wasn't supposed to be safe, the fact that you can use programs like Near2 to remain pretty much 100% safe meant the games economy had spiraled out of control, loss meant nothing in a game where loss is supposed to matter.
---
Now you care when you die because you have to replace it, and doing so requires effort and care.
---
Actually I recant that, there would be a loss, dont do that.
---
I am new to the game (and it's only my brother and I who are in our corp), but as far as I can tell, invasions are raid style content. When they show up in my system it just means I don't get to play Eve for a couple days. I really wish I could suspend my sub for those days, it sucks to be paying for a game you can't play - but I guess that's what Alpha account alts are for.
---
Move to highsec :)
---
I take it you didn't read my post, or then you need to work on your reading comprehension. It's not a matter of "local keeping me alive", it's a matter of ISK economics: I spend ISK on PvP, so I need to earn it somehow. Previously it was efficient (efficiency is the net isk/hr, i.e. bounties gained minus ISK lost to PvE ship deaths) enough to rat in null, it was also convenient because I could have my PvP there too. Now the efficiency has dropped like a rock, and it's much more efficient to make ISK in HS or WH space. So much more efficient that it's no longer reasonable to stay in null even if it would be more convenient for PvP.
---
Yeet!
---
I'm pretty sure that's his point in not accepting real money: he doesn't want anyone to get the impression they're his boss.
---
True but with the new wardec mechanics you'd need an alt corp to own the station or you risk attacks by wardeccers.
---
Trump, is that you?
---
Its the overall risk aversion in people today. People are so worried about being humiliated on social media like Reddit that it has bread the environment that we currently live in. Couple that with the fact people have forgotten that this is a sand box and no longer want to make their own sand castles but live in the big shiny prebuilt ones and you have the current state of Eve Online.
---
Yes and i'm the Meme God. 
---
(no it's not this a bot of EVE asking for Knowledge)
---
is this a leak? I thought PH Discord was just a thread of r/eve
---
thanks that will be very damaging for enemies.
---
All of that is correct.  Which is why blackout without a nerf to the umbrella is only a half-assed fix.   I keep holding out hope they won't stop there.
---
(Mind you a nerf to the umbrella can be multiple things.  Nerf its size.  Nerf how much it "covers" in the way of resources in  respawning anoms.  Make a counter to some sort of unfocused super response or a nerf of some sort to supers themselves.)
---
I've see plenty of people solo a minor conduit with a Rattlesnake or a Marauder every day. I've saw a Vargur and Golem solo a major conduit just this last weekend. These guys just really know what they are doing. In fact, that Vargur and Golem made it almost through the third stage of a World Arc run before a big fleet came and whored in on it. If you have mastery 5 it seems you can accomplish a lot with relatively little.
---
Says a lot about Eve, the so-called perma-loss (of your ship) MMO that has asset safety so you don't lose your stuff, and when players are now at actual risk in the so-called risky space they just stop logging in.
---
Imagine how many people would stop responding to your f1 warrior pings without SRP. A whole generation of eve players reliant on milk from the teat and free instant intel.
---
In the so-called hardcore perma-loss space mmo Eve Online.
---
Again....some decent programming. Fuck half reasom they got rid of local is because their chat system is shit. But yet i can go play other games and chat with people anywhere in game without even a single fps drop. Maybe they just need to hire mew programmer.
---
i guess you shouldn't have built a corporation full of mouthbreathers then
---
CSM member Gobbins did mention this change is gonna negatively impact smaller entities more, but ppl think he has too much wine.
---
Most of changes done over the past 3-4 years have negatively impacted smaller entities more than bigger, about time CCP reverses this and give playstyles other than multiboxing rorqs under cap umbrellas a chance.
---
He got Sov and Ihub timers.  Seems they aren't even doing that much.
---
But the seems there is room for "emergent" game play.  Pay more for an actual umbrella.  Pay less for the sov.  Or move on.  
---
Ironically this might be the answer for all those people who said LowSec is dead.  Now LowSec has a value in that it gives you local.
---
the blasters aren't for shooting NPCs. 
---
shooting MTUs will make you turn 'suspect' (flashy yellow) which can sometimes bait the mission runner into shooting you. mission runners tend to have shiny shit on their ships, and that tends to be worth decent money if you can kill them somehow. 
---
failing that, if they just aren't there to protect their MTU, or forgot to bookmark it, it will contain all the loot of their mission
---
How’s high sec?
---
Okay so you honed in on him mentioning DED for personal isk generation, then ignored all of his other points.
---
Reading your other posts in this thread, I just have to assume at some point you're here to whinge and not accept advice. Which is fine, that's what most people do, bit upon seeing this shit, it'll just bring you mockery.
---
yes.........
---
&gt;I think outside of super umbrellas and supers the ability to make money in null has been hit too hard
---
I think the issue you and many others may be having is that income was too readily available and safe/easy to come by for literally anybody in null. There will be an adjustment period, where people realize that it's actually unsafe to do maximum efficiency ratting/mining in a 20b+ krab setup outside of very specific areas. The fact that they were allowed to do so for so long everywhere is disgusting and is why the economy is so fucked up today. 
---
Today we live in a new reality, where the isk generation we feel as if we are entitled to is now gone, things will start to get more expensive and have more value. Sure within the 1DQ umbrella you're still as safe as ever, but it is worth noting that range is in fact limited, and you can't actually krab nearly as efficiently when you're surrounded by 35,000 other people who also wanna do nothing but krab.

Perhaps everybody *will* just be a whiny beta bitchboy and go running to Delve or Esoteria or the Drone Lands to be able to safely krab, but how is that any different from what cowardly turbokrabs did already? And in those places, the reaction to your presence as the attacker will be significantly delayed, and you will find plenty of opportunity to kill things. Sometimes you'll fail, sometimes you'll succeed, as it should be. Small groups will have to figure out that hey, I can't rat solo in my 10b worth of smartbombing battleships for 500m/hr in 100% perfect safety, perhaps I should single or dual box some other kind of PvE, and have alts previously dedicated to isk making on guard duty instead. And I shouldn't put out my hugely expensive krabbing setups because that attracts the attention of humongous groups I have no hope of countering. This isn't a bad thing, it's just different.
---
You've definitely got it all figured out.  How long until you fix the game for CCP, since it's so easy?  Or alternatively, you quit to play all these other amazing games?  We're all waiting with baited breath for your answer.
---
i'mma need 2 ropes for this one
---
On what do you base the assumption that 95%+ plus would chose to adapt their play style by returning to mine in Null (the example you use). Would it not be more likely that they have chosen to earn ISK in some other lower risk category rather than seriously adapt their playstyle to survive in a permanent blackout null.
---
Grow up to play an internet spaceships game? Sure thing
---
There's no such thing as a temporary change with no end date given based on the historical actions of CCP regarding changes. Change my mind.
---
Calm down miner
---
go back and check that and look at 1 year and 5 years.   1 year stops right before this summer but if you go to the 5 year graph you will see a pretty good drop on average players online
---
Not that much?  I don't know why you think that.  I Plex my account because I don't have time to rat or whatever, and even if I did, I have to think getting 1 Bil would take a looong time.  It's not that OP lost isk or money; it's that he lost time.   You can't recover that.
---
Others have hinted, but I'm going to say it directly:
---
**Getting SP won't help you be more useful in PVP.**
---
PVP usefulness in EVE is all about getting practiced at playing a role well. I don't know your exact skillset, but I'm guessing you are within a week of being able to fly a T1 jamming frigate. These are useful in any fleet, full stop. Fill your mids with jams and your lows for align with a bit of tank in case you run into a smartbomb. Your job is to warp onto grid right after the fight starts, fire everything once, warp off, repeat. The ship and fit should cost about 2m. Buy 10 because you will be so annoying you will be primary every time you show your face.
---
At first, you'll be able to effectively delete one enemy from the fight. As you get better, you'll get a sense of the best targets and when you can stay on grid, and you'll be effectively removing 2-4 enemies all by yourself.
---
Then by all means train the magic 14 and train into a Confessor, but **the** way to get comfortable in PVP is to do it.
---
Even under an umbrella, 90 bombers is more than likely killing what it drops, even pre-blackout. 
---
Hell, I use to frequently go on fleets of 20 bombers under an umbrella killing carriers and rorqs. This isn't something that magically changed just because you can't see who's in local anymore. 
---
Btw, not every drop is that large, getting too skittish to do anything in game because you're afraid of being killed constantly means yeah, nul/low/wh's are just probably not for you.
---
Also let us not act as though renter defense prior to blackout was anything more than docking if you saw a known hunter.
---
so move to lowsec? the entire purpose of blackout is to stop your crabbing 24/7 with total safety cause you can see if someone might hurt you.
---
he rats in a proudly self proclaimed "blingy typhoon" I think he's beyond help friend
---
And the change was that you lost local.
---
Ipso facto, you need the crutch of local to stay alive.
---
They moved on about five minutes after me posting this :)
---
I actually lost a carrier I was carelessly moving last night because of black out, had a hel dropped on me. I like blackout, I shouldn't have got away with what I was doing.
---
Exactly.
---
At least grow up enough to not need to ask the internet "should I play internet spaceship games? I'm bad at it and I rage quit".
---
The answer is no, you should not. You should go outside.
---
It entirely is.
---
NPC is actually harder because there is no easy fallback and as an overall quality of the systems is lower.
---
But what do I know, I grew up in Syndicate.
---
Agreed.
---
And he will throw a tantrum if you dare stole the corpse of the venture he elitely killed
---
Sounds like you hate risk.  Don't want to face a risk? Either scout out a quiet system and have friends, or run T3 and below.  Run a T5 on the Jita undock and you'll die.  Seems reasonable to me.
---
Wouldn't know, I'm currently busy being bored shitless in the empty shit hole that is null right now
---
Imma need 20 more heavy tackle Proteus, the Gila is escaping!
---
Did he just delete his account?
---
i have no opinion on the website really, but i dont like ppl going "fuck the users you entitled fucks" when they also add value to the website by giving their apis
---
fly as cheap as possible and buy ships in stacks. If you loose a ship but still have 5 more "copies" in the hangar, it doesn't hurt as much. 
---
Plus you already expected to loose them in the first place, you wouldn't buy more than one otherwise. 
---
best of luck
---
I got my gnosis to &gt;10 killmarks solo with scram and autocannons.  
---
If you bite in any bait provided that is kinda your own fault \^\^ and yeah in eve it should be a matter of time until someone kills you.
---
It's a bookmark, far enough inside the docking ring of a station that you'll always land within immediate docking range when you warp to it. [*q.v.*](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Bookmarks#Instadock) (If you haven't used bookmarks much you might want to read that whole page.)
---
[See also](https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/instadock-instaundock).
---
&gt;I know I won't die when I'm fullspeed aligned in my blingy phoon doing a haven
---
I wouldn't count on that. It is possible for cloaky ships to bump you out of alignment before you get the chance to hit that warp button.
---
I'll mail you tonight, I'm on Pacific Time.
---
Same with Tenal and Vale pretty much, but the narrative that is trying to be pushed by people in renter groups is because you can't read local you're now helpless.
---
83% of statistics are made up =)
---
It is possible for both narratives to be true. There can be a decline in general ratting but more targets due to the inability to reactively safe up. Not saying that is better than the previous situation, just saying they aren't mutually exclusive.
---
No one bridges 90 bombers on a single proc. Go any realistic scenarios lying around instead?
---
Yeah I did a google search and was just about to edit my comment with my findings. Thanks for the info!
---
Brave and other legacy groups rat in Impass. If you wanna use numbers, at least use the right ones.
---
There is s few near Baltimore, I’ve seen eve related stickers quite a few times on the loop.
---
Slightly.
---
Big thing is that natural attrition kills the proper shitty ones faster.
---
In highsec shitty ones hang on and spawn quick enough that there are always lots being super shitty.
---
Move to a wormhole. It's blackout all the time, and smaller corps do fine. As someone who prefers the smaller group atmosphere, I started it recently and can't imagine playing any other way.
---
Unplayable, uninstall.
---
Great, now lets glass the DeadCo
---
I'll try to talk in simple terms: I lose ships with or without blackout. If blackout makes it much faster to earn ISK for those ships in WH's or by doing abyssals in HS, then that's what I'll do instead of null ratting. Comprende?
---
You are old if you like mining. It is more boring than fishing. *Shrugs* Still better than gate camping though, which is worse than watching paint dry.
---
Sounds like someone has one too many spies.
---
Yup There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. Mark Twain
---
Then go run them in any of the dozens of high-sec systems that literally nobody visits, at a celestial that is off of d-scan of the gates
---
&gt; I can't rat solo in my 10b worth of smartbombing battleships for 500m/hr in 100% perfect safety
---
lol wut?
---
Literally none of what you wrote is the standpoint that I am coming from.  The economy was so fucked not because of sub cap ratters ( or rather they were a small portion of this.)  but because of moon mining changes coupled with rorqs and super umbrellas.  Those are the trifecta that did it.  Now with black out we mostly still have those things ( though rorqs are mining less with t2 mining drones.)   But have instead now hit subcap ratters and miners from lets say 100% efficiency to near 0, that is a problem, that is far too much in the other direction and is not balanced.   
---
Things may get more expensive or they may not because not only is mining down but isk generation is too with regards to ratting, so maybe?  we will have to see there because it will depend on how much less mining vs. how much less ratting isk generation there is (essentially less isk coming into the economy raises the value of the existing isk in the economy already and actually lowers prices on things.)  
---
This isnt just different, the specific effects on money making for subcaps in null IS a bad thing.
---
confirmed
---
Im sincerely surprised you agree with me heh.
---
There's serious discussions underway in provi about ending NRDS and also about merging some smaller alliances into CVA, I know for myself I've been giving serious consideration into putting my corp into CVA.  
---
General feeling is too many small groups are trying to do stuff on their own and not getting any traction, we need to merge into one large group and really focus to have a chance at survival.  Even if Blackout ended tomorrow at DT, I think it's highly probable that some merging happens in the near future.
---
ur thorax fit is trash
---
The problem is not the blackout.
---
People are pointing at the immediate change as the cause for drama.  The underlying issue is all the coalitions, alliances and organizations surrounding all of the very small corporations, and that they have 10 to 100X more resources for harassing the smaller groups.
---
The protection that the smaller groups had (and also every corporation had), was local.  The field was leveled evenly, but those conglomerates that have all the resources, manpower, and time, now have a new tool to harass and destroy smaller organizations, and that is the element of surprise).  
---
Groups, all groups, did the same thing.  Someone zones into local, you warp away, you log off, you hide.  You become such an unappealing target, the hunter goes away to hunt something else that will give them gratification.  Now the small organizations did not like this, but it gave them a barrier of protection, a safety net.  For larger organizations, that safety net was not used for safety, but for forwarding offensive intelligence.  It was easy for them to use.
---
Now that the system changed, the safety net for small organizations is gone, and the easy intelligence for larger organizations is gone.  The difference is that the large organization was able to switch to option 2, 3 or 4.  It took them more resources but it did not harm them very much.
---
Smaller organizations relied on this safety net for survival.  Now many.. MANY cannot figure out another viable option for protection.
---
It is not the blackout.  The blackout gave people exactly what they wanted.  What CCP did not do is give smaller corporations a replacement safety net.
---
Want to rat in capitals? try wormholes. or level 5 missions.
---
Want to make money solo? Lowsec or highsec missions, or Incursions for the straight isk faucet. Don't need to dscan much in the highsec stuff. 
---
If you want afk isk, it shouldn't be in what is supposed to be the most dangerous form of K-space.
---
You must be in PH to be so utterly retarded. Where did I say lowsec is shit and where did i put the supposed blame on null? Please fill us in.
---
Lol, Waffles is totally butthurt. That's all they talk about i'm sure. Is just about how butthurt they are about stuff... HAHA
---
I'll go with this for the no local. Since no Concord tech is available I will also take turning on and off gates for 1000 please. I will also take turning on local for certain people for 1200. Womrhile cynos for 2000 please.
---
I'm not surprised that overall ratting is down. Its anecdotal sure, but while I've seen less sign of ratters in space I'm still catching more than pre-blackout. A region can be loaded with ratters, but near2 plus intel bots meant that hunters rarely found many ratters still in space, just lots of wrecks and MTUs.
---
ARMOR SUPERS ARE FOR GARBAGE PEOPLE.
---
Whatever you say my friend, I have certainly caught more, blingier, targets since blackout.
---
Infrastructure protection is also important and covered in the contract. If your stations are bashed by a large group the landlords have to defend it or reimburse you as well. A smallish corp or medium corp with more spread out activity can better utilize those stations.
---
No you.
---
Which doesn't address the intrinsic risk, you come out of a site and you can't defend yourself even if you had a fleet of 100 orbiting the trace in Hisec. Carebearing should have risks but the risk of suspect timers here is very lopsided in the attackers favor.
---
Disagree. Provi and NRDS is the last bastion of good in eve. NRDS gives provi a reason to fight we are a police force fighting for new players. If you are not NRDS you are just a evil troll.
---
The issue is that building those expensive ships requires low-sec and null-sec only minerals, and if you're mining in a venture, you need to spend an obscene amount of time gathering all the minerals. You could probably watch all of The Office (~70 hours) in the time it takes you to mine and build that battleship, especially if one million ISK is a lot for you...
---
If you enjoy mining, absolutely feel free to keep doing it, but maybe give other things a shot if you only have 10 days experience, have never left high-sec, and have only ever flown a Venture. Don't limit yourself that much.
---
That does raise some flags, doesn't it. Null did become carebear central. After more than a year in null i got bored. The most fun i had was living in the wormhole and going out solo for pvp. Always hated the f1 stuff but it's a necessary evil if you live in a large null bloc.
---
what is a MTU?
---
Just follow the rules and stay blue. If you are a criminal you will be hunted here.
---
Nah, he has big hands
---
Delve has 34 systems with rats dying in them right now. Quit your bullshit.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve/1-SMEB#npc
---
Just ignore all the comments above. What they want to say is that our % of active players is probably one of the highest in game for corps/groups our size. Back in the day of WAFFLES 2.0 and loswec being great, we had around 400 characters in corp (140 mains) and we were able to get 90-100 piots in fleets regularly and easily and those numbers are numbers that bigger groups/alliance of a few thousand players envy us.
---
I did.
---
Botting is another problem to people that actively watch local as they rat. As they're also pretty much safe. But as we all know plenty of people go afk.
---
In Wolf Rayet Systems even the bigger WH corps run with Confessors and Guardians.
---
Buffer is not needed when you have some speed / sig tank.
---
It's not addictive for me, but it is endlessly interesting. 
---
I basically stopped playing over 10 years ago, but I've continued to read and learn about it ever since.. so strange.
---
I have a very unhealthy 5k+ total hours in it... Personally I say go for it! o/
---
If you can handle EVE's learning curve, WarFrame will not be hard to get started and get going.
---
Agree somewhat. People are so afraid of losing conflicts in this game that they would rather stay in a constant state of material build-up instead of having actual territorial changes and fun engagements. 
---
Although eve is what you make of it, its only a game anyway.
---
THIS and be willing to evolve as Corp grows and be a LEADER and a Example for your members.
---
***BEEP BOOP HOSTILES ON INTEL WITHIN 3 JUMPS BEEP BOOP***
---
For your info PvP means player vs player. Killing players who are ratting is a PvP activity. A braindead PvP activity but still.
---
Yay! Now come to low sec.
---
You’re the man squizz
---
Mobile Tractor Unit. its a deployable that tractors in wrecks so that slow battleships dont have to slowboat to all the wrecks to get the loot, or so that you can put more salvagers on your ship and not need to tractor stuff.
---
they're easy to kill because they only have ~50,000 HP
---
I get that the build is shit (seriously i once did a 4/10 expedition and failed to do it in time and missed out on an item worth 400 mil) but this is the best one i have so far and it is a copy of the cormorant build found in the Starter Builds chat channel (i think i accidentally also copied some of the build from the Beginner Fits)
---
Just limit yourself at 1-2hr a day or less. I play Eve the last few hours before bed when most people are asleep during the semester. Just find a way to keep you in check on your playing time
---
For low level combat exploration . this cormy is very good
---
I think this is the core problem with these discussions. All the "PVPers" seem to consider *all* null-sec activities as profitable as super ratting or Rorqual mining under super umbrellas. Which is obviously ridiculous.
---
Nobody was ever getting space rich spinning a VNI or two, or doing sub-cap mining on a couple of alts. With enough time invested into that, it could let you live in null and fund your PVP stuff, but it would have taken half your life to grind for the big stuff people are flying under the super umbrellas.
---
With the cost of operating those sub-cap PVE ships in null during the blackout, the rewards are simply not worth it. Almost all other activities, in all other areas of New Eden, are more profitable.
---
1. Fuck Google for allowing these stupid ass 100x redirect "u computer is of havings 1,0000 virus!!11" bullshit, it makes people block ads on websites that rely on them.
---
 
---
2. Thank you for providing this amazing service. I hope you're getting a steady flow of ISK (my own included) to make up for the fact that many of us use adblockers thanks to #1.
---
IM GOING TO BE DELETING MY ACCOUNT ON REDDIT SOON AND I WANTED TO DAY ONE GIANT LAST FUCK YOU TO JONN DUUNE.
---
GET YOUR ANTI CHESTER SHIT TALK IN NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE
---
thanks it's great for low level combat sites indeed however i do have salvaging problems (i use that one salvager so it takes an eternity to salvage and fleet worth of NPCs)
---
However what am i meant to store in that mobile tractor unit?
---
I’m in both. We’re getting pounded by snuffed right now lol
---
What IS MTU and MWD? also Guristas also do some thermal damage what about that?
---
Gigafortress delve
---
How much of ADM was bots, though? Definitely not all, but I would wager a lot.
---
Too many
---
I once bought a 3x t2 rigged field extender worm there for 60m.
---
But yeah, mostly scams
---
hmm so
---
Find a quiet system
---
Clear specifically Hideaways 
---
Kill elites or get escalations
---
Profit 
---
Wait so where can i find a 1/10 combat site?
---
Meow
---
What is an MTU?
---
Yeah, I agree - it is PvP, just boring PvP kinda like pressing f1 in fleet fights - for your info that's technically PvP too. 
---
But it's neither fun nor challenging (hence it's not uncommon for shitfit BC's [and smaller] to solo dunk blingy battleships) the only thing uncommon about this particular KM is that I was a bhargest instead of a rattle. 
---
This post claims that solo PvP is alive and well, but the best example he could cough up was catching a ratting ship.
---
That isn't good PvP, it isn't quality PvP, it isn't fun gameplay.
---
Solo PvP is in a bad state in Eve, let's not pretend that dunking blingy ratting ships is a desirable state of solo gameplay.
---
Wtf stop making sense
---
Nope.  No spys were used in this fleet.
---
Its all done by watching who their fleet starts ewaring/shooting and reacting accordingly, as well as years of experience.
---
Sorry if I came across too harsh.  Check out the Eve Uni wiki for ship fittings.  They're not always optimal, but they are a wonderful place to start and can give you some good ideas for what each ship can and should do.  The rest of that wiki is a goldmine as well - I cannot recommend it highly enough.
---
January 2018
---
MTU = Mobile tractor unit.  
---
It is a deployable thing that will tractor in all the wrecks to it and also takes their contents inside. It will make salvaging much faster since all the wrecks will be in single spot.
---
MWD = Micro warp drive  
---
Go fast. Makes your signature bigger, has capcitor capacity penalty and drains capacitor pretty fast.
---
You do some thermal damage but they do much more kinetic damage than thermal damage. For example this one deals 23 dps kinetic and 5  dps thermal http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=24048. Defending against kinetic is much more important than the thermal.
---
if they like doing exploration
---
Adding cynos and quadrupling mass limits to wormholes next patch, fyi.
---
Blackout IS good for little guys, the problem is that the blackout has stressed the importance of the umbrella. Umbrellas were the problem before but it was made less necessary by the power of local.  Without local as a safety intel tool umbrellas power has been emphasized.  The next step isn't to roll back blackout but to shit on umbrellas and power projection.
---
I run T4/5  abyssal sites in High Sec and I am fine with the return of the suspect timer, if it drives more competition out of the market I can charge more so all good for me. I have a nice little quiet system far from the trade hubs where I activate the trace if any hunter can be bothered to find me then they are welcome to the killmail, but in the spirit of more risk more reward I expect CCP will tailor the sites accordingly.
---
I pay my subscription and do PVE just to cover my PVP activities, and I'm seriously poor by EVE standards... still, nowadays, 1b is hardly a loss someone can't recover from.
---
And yes, of course isk can be translated into time/effort, and that's why loses actually *mean* something in this game. If that's a reason for you not to play, or have fun, or take risks, well... I'm sorry to say so, but this might not be the right game for you, because sooner or later you WILL lose your ships.
---
And 1b is around 2/3 of a monthly sub, and lot of people buy plex with isk to sub their accounts, so by that ratio it isn't really that much... ofc not something a new player would easily get in a month, but OP was flying a blingy Rattle, so I doubt he was a new player.
---
Risk aversity is a disease that prevents people from actually enjoying videogames (and EVE in particular).
---
WTF! Concord itself? 
---
So wait 1/10 or 2/10 escalations can only be accesed by frigates? (or do i have to be in a frigate while clearing a combat site to get them?)
---
Also what is the difference between Passive resists and active resists
---
I get that they both have varring amonts of resist % but still like what makes them different?
---
gf
---
 If its safer/easier to do it in wh/low/hisec than null where is that risk = reward all cap umbrellas are made by players and run by players I don't get you guys
---
Ho shit, brothers in arms, we just got our ass kicked by snuff :( well more specifically their titans.
---
That's why I'm here... I want to hear them sing "Up on a roof..."
---
In the client, ESC brings up a page that lets you edit graphics options. EVE isn't really too demanding of your hardware as modern games go, so you might have something else going on, but maybe try dropping some graphics settings if that seems to be a problem.
---
The patron saints of RG holes, DURA
---
are you always this oblivious, or do you make extra effort on mondays?
---
&gt; $400/month
---
Wow that is surprising to me. I don't know anything about hosting websites but I would never have expected that servers could cost so much. Just out of curiosity, would you be comfortable with disclosing how many page views per unit time zkillboard gets?
---
how about an limited anoiment active kinetic resist (it gives a 37.5% kinetic resist and i'm going to be fighting Guristas) mind you cormy really doesn't have much capacity for Flexibility

#ROTE KAPELLE LOVES BLACKOUT
---
Eh, we've had pretty much daily smashes with Caracals and other light stuff lately. If a hostile group is contesting timers of course it's going to be a serious response but I've had a blast flying in kitchen sink, nano roams, gate camps and some t1 shit for fun content.
---
Oh i answered the comments backwards (meaning the last comment was answered first) so that is what everyone (who told me to carry a mobile tractor unit) meant oh I thought about buying things from scatch (which yeah that is also what you're saying but this is much more affordable)
---
Definitely agree. I think it's a case of quality over quantity. There are fewer ratters (less quantity), but now the people you're catching are more actual players and not bots (better quality). So you don't look at a d-scan and think to yourself "which one of these 10 VNIs is a person?" As a result, you're getting kills but these kills are players trying to pay for other things like bigger ships and PvP adventures etc... The question is are we going to throw out the baby with the bath water just to get rid of the bots + give hunters more and better kills? If so, is that sustainable?
---
&gt; Still better than gate camping
---
gatecamping &gt; all other activities in eve combined
---
So WHAT???!!! I will tell you WHAT....The Drifter event is what FINALLy after 10 years on the fence got me to decide to create an account to play
---
Eve Online DESPERATELY needs more events like this because otherwise..its toast!
---
And if you don't like Reddit...**Then Leave**
---
And you take that this is an "event" with a determined end date from where again?
---
Fuck. Got me.
---
Ya, for sure. The whole tengu being offline thing made me complacent.
---
play for fun is retarded, i hope your make good isk per hour o/
---
you seem upset, are your ticks per hour not worth it anymore?
---
I have to say I am VERY Sad to hear this.  I was **JUST** in my Caldari Starter Ship to head out to Nullsec to hear the Drifters sing and now I find out the Freakin' things is over....shoooottt!!
---
well, it's kinda Fred's choice who gets to go out and blops lol
---
Oh don't worry, wasn't planning too. Upgraded my mining ship already and am not stuck to high-sec :)
---
Just Ansiblex around it.
---
A lot of us get off on the whole "two ships enter, one ship leaves" thing.
---
Gobbins wears the pants and he just wanted FRT to know he's the boss. That's all it was.
---
Unless you move out of Jita.
---
&gt;  The blackout is a finite event that has an end date 
---
And when is this end date?
---
I too live making L4 missions levels of isk in a place where you can actually die and undo hours of money earned.
---
And now, you can't even remote rep suspects.
---
Oh hey, I know that guy
---
Why is it dangerous?
---
Killing ratters is a good gateway into harder forms of PvP
---
I play for fun, shoot people all the time and barely do the minimum PVE required to (barely) cover my loses... so idk what the fuck you are talking about.
---
Learn to read douchebag, you are understanding things so wrong I'm starting to think you are in fact mentaly disabled.
---
We all pay the Vonhole tax once, and I am no exception. After that happens you have several ways to go, I joined the dark side myself 🖤
---
Are mutaplasmid bonuses stacking penalized?
---
Well most of them don't have anything with which they could even be penalized.
---
But for example armor repairer cycle time could in theory get stacking penalties with rigs.
---
Probably not but who knows what CCP does. For example some overheating bonuses are stacking penalized and it is very inconsistent.
---
Fair enough, but you can get exactly that in FW for a fraction of the price.
---
Come on dude... Eve has a massive lore backing it up!! It may not be nearly as much of an investment as it should be for CCP, but the major lore is there, and it is quite interesting IF you chose to dig it all and learn about it all.
---
You and 20,000 other players. 
---
Don't do it. Just join an existing corp, and encourage them to merge with or take on members of another corp.
---
Too many 5-man corps in the game. Should have a much higher entry bar. i.e. 6 month old character, do a charter requiring at least 10 other players to sign-on. At least 1 Billion ISK. 
---
99% of 'Recruitment' chat is 5-10 man garbage corps talking like they are going to rule New Eden by Wednesday of next week. LOL! 
---
We need a Month Of Merging. Get all the small corps to merge.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. love it! gonna haze them so hard right now.
---
It's freaking dead but I must say, dunking spectre fleet is pretty fun once in a while when they come your way. Otherwise, even the cloakies arent taking bait now. Or they left, I cant really tell.
---
 Our Indy guys are still out mining up a storm in rorqs, and sitting in the standing fleet undocked on the keepstar with my titan a fax and dread alts is not bad when nothing else is going on. Its great for shooting the shit until some gang shows up to kill rorqs, at least for the minute or two they stay on grid until the caps drop lol... 
---
I guess that's the state of null now. With blackout, Rorqs are safer than they have ever been
---
What people dont get, is that all the industry in null, is what allowed for cheaper ships and modules, allowed many people to constantly pvp and lose stuff. Now no one wants to lose anything because it's much harder to replace.
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE NO GOOD MULTIPLAYER SPACE GAMES? JUST THIS 20 YEAR OLD STEAMING PILE OF AUTISTIC SHIT (best of the bunch tbh), A CAREBEAR INFESTED SPACE TRUCKING "SIMULATOR" MADE BY THE SHITTIEST DEVS ON EARTH, A CROWD FUNDED TECH DEMO THAT HASN'T IMPROVED IN YEARS AND IS RUN BY A CON ARTIST, AND A SPACE MINECRAFT CLONE THAT JUST BARELY QUALIFIES AS MULTIPLAYER LIKE 4 YEARS LATER.
---
COMEON MOTHERFUCKERS, IF I KNEW YOU SHITS WERENT GONNA MAKE GOOD GAMES I WOULD HAVE CHANGED MY COLLEGE MAJOR AND DONE IT MYSELF.
---
Bomb runs are great fun in larger fights.
---
Blops drops are even more fun!
---
Scout/recon is useful in fleet scenarios too.
---
Also if it’s a whaling fleet wormhole knowledge as a scout helps before a fleet (e.g. reporting a wh chain to an fc)
---
Often its before the fight. Finding content.
---
During, usually its.staring st the enemy undock, a gate, a wormhole and a whole lot of dscan whilst you report to the FC enemy movements.
---
There are also gurus who combat scan down enemy fleets, or unfortunate log offs for quick.and easy dunking.
---
To some it up, youre a tool with important, niche utility but it dies depend on the group you fly with ofc.
---
Can confirm the annoying as fuck part and also that its gratifying asfuck to know your annoying
---
YOU ARE A LITTLE LATE WITH THIS FUCKFACE DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW POSTING WORKS
---
The blackout is null-sec only; You don't see who's in system with you at all unless they type in local. Only CCP can answer if it's the new normal or not.
---
In the near term yes. People are addicted to the point where they will spend hours ratting to pay for pvp ships. They will pull out the credit card of they can't make enough ratting. But when the wallet hurts, that's when addicts start to realize there is a problem
---
Most beautiful thing I've seen since the detorid bathhouse advertisement
---
Renters at least had idiots sometimes that would feed blingy ratting shipps and rorqs. Now nothing :(
---
Thats NOT what eve is about though.  Eve is about dying and risk.  If you wanna go kill shit in safety, run lvl 4's.  If you want bigger ticks, you should be at a real risk of getting caught.
---
I'm so sick of telling people this, look, all game companies can eliminate bots through detection software, it's super easy and widely available and works. So if your favorite game has bots, pretty fucking good chance the devs put them there or allowed it. And it really helped push CCPs agenda with reducing income now didnt it? Get a clue.
---
I love some one (the op) thst acuses others of flawed analytical arguements that then throws in unreferenced stats.
---
Okay.
---
They haven't announced when it would be released, only that it was in the works.
---
And me, send me everything all of it !!!
---
To answer your question let's assume something:
---
\-Assume that when people adapt their playstyle and farming techniques after any change, it's only detrimental to a regions content volume if it causes them to leave the region, not if they change what they are doing in the region.
---
**-Example A:** If the blackout incentivizes PI and Abyssal, and disincentivizes mining and ratting, both in null, this is a neutral impact to the net content available in null because people are in space in one way or another
---
**-Example B:** If the blackout pushes people to high-sec for alternative means of income, fewer people in null == less content == bad
---
I assume the change would have people adapt in neutral a neutral or at positive way (i.e. they stay in null and change methods or change income approaches) because null is very profitable and makes ease of play much simpler. The average lineman in an alliance only has 1 account and dislocating their income activities and other activities is not an option. The median null player cannot leave null because then they cannot respond to pings or do any of the "fun" things they want to do in the game such as pvp or industry etc. If they move their main account which is used for both pvp and pve to high-sec, they can only do one. This means that the outflow from null to high-sec will be very low if the blackout was permanent.
---
I should als
---
It's just a question of organization. Big power blocks can in principle control bigger areas. The smaller ones, will have to adapt and focus on smaller areas.
---
Pretending that by the simple fact that a TCU has your alliance logo in one system is enough for you to be secure it's a thing from the past.
---
They're really bad for profitability, T3 is when it starts making sense vs running missions, for example. T4s and T5s are where the money is.
---
Did they take away the Proving grounds?
---
Dude this is CCP they will bring out a patch that returns Null local by accident try and repair it find it to difficult say F... it creat some Trig lore about it returning and pretend it was always the plan in the first place.
---
CCP Stated that this was a test to observe impacts and see how people changed. It has not gone on long enough for anyone to seriously begin thinking this is a no nonsense reality. I surmise there are many hold-outs still waiting to see if the change will revert so they can return to business-as-usual.
---
blackout + vni nerf killed afk vni multi boxing. Were some of those people Botters? maybe. But allot of them were not. Subcap ratting is allot more dangerous during the blackout while super ratting under an umbrella is just as safe as ever.   
---
showing a dotlan map with npc kills before and after doesn't mean that all those people no longer ratting were bots.
---
I'm curious how wide a net CCP is casting for this - I got the same email and I've been winning Eve since the Casino War and the move to Delve. Might still give this a go, though...
---
Lol go get some water for u salt. I gave something constructive. You have yet to do so
---
or mtus and barges (and in the past vnis)
---
&gt; Infrastructure protection is also important and covered in the contract.
---
There was a keepstar in our system.  Emphasis on the 'was'.
---
Like ships, once in space, consider it lost.
---
Took out a fleet hours before and killed a frat gnosis 15 minutes before the were blue again
---
WHBOOOOOOO
---
This man tells no lie.
---
They have also stated a new age of chaos for the game and that the blackout was just the begining and that more shake ups for all regions and activities are to be expected...
---
You can scan.
---
2 things that could be happening, you were probably exploring wormholes of Class 4 through 6 or you got to the wormhole through hisec.
---
If you go to a wormhole through hisec (and especially close to a trade hub), the wormholes are probably all explored. You're better off exploring through dead-end regions, where it's more likely that no explorer has gone through the hole before you. Same thing applies if you're in a null bloc, people will probably already have explored your wormhole if you're close to your main alliance hub.
---
Second, always search your wormhole in this tool: [http://anoik.is/](http://anoik.is/)
---
If a wormhole is Class 4-6 (dangerous or deadly in the wormhole connection information), no data/relic pirate sites will spawn in it. Only Class 1-3 will have data/relic sites. Only try to reach C1-3 wormholes since there's a bigger chance there will be a data/relic site in it.
---
&gt;There are fewer ratters (less quantity), but now the people you're catching are more actual players and not bots (better quality)
---
I'm not saying your wrong here, but my corp had a few guys (myself included) that made isk ratting in Ishtars while semi afk.  None of these guys are boters.  Now they choose not to rat, because they don't want to feed.  Anyone your catching now is desperate or dumb imo.
---
k
---
That last time they messed with capital mechanics to the degree you refer to as "shit on" was changing jump mechanics and they lost 1/3 of their player base. I doubt they will do something that drastic ever again. 
---
Blackout is a nice hit to the balls, but with some reorganization its actually perfect for the four big groups in eve but much less perfect for small groups. 
---
I think it's awesome to see organized super responses now it's always at the ready. People who would have used them in anger once a year are now able to use em everyday.
---
Last night I was cloaked in LXQ2 trying to pick off randoms, and a goon jackdaw gang came into system, horde of all people dropped 20 titans on them. I lol'd pretty good considering horde was the noobie haven not long ago. Now they throw titans around like it's nothing
---
HTFU
---
This guy gets it, more accurately learn to combat scan as well for your fleets content. The guy who can scan a rattle and get the fleet a warp in in one scan pass is a hero always.
---
No it will pause.
---
I roamed through provi last night for a few hours and it was completely and utterly dead expect for 1 system that had 2 coveters mining a moon with a defense fleet.
---
1. Open dotlan       
---
2. Find system with minimal movement, probably some dead end        
---
3. Setup your base of operations          
---
4. The "average rats killed..." will be zero even if you run the sites 23/7 so no one trace you
---
i got tackled from 60km the other day in an oni by a malediction whose tank i couldn't break with a rlml oni. that malediction was like 13 bil abyssal fit.
---
 I DONT PLAY EVE RIGHT NOW, BUT I STILL COME HERE FOR THE MEMES AND VIDEOS.. WTF IS THE MEMES AND VIDEOS!!!
---
Uh, what?  I don't have to give anything constructive because I'm not the one complaining.  You are.  And you've got the "leet hacker skillz" to fix it.  It's all so simple.  Who's the salty one?
---
I thought "this seems so convoluted...", Then I realized that I have a container called "rare shit" sitting in Jita where I hoard all my event and dropped skins, and have the bad habit of buying new ones instead of just using the one I have in the container lol
---
Although I just have around 6b worth of shit in there &gt;.&gt;
---
There is no mutual relationship.  Zkill is a hobby, not the mans living.  If it goes away, man doesn't have to spend anymore time, money or effort on it.
---
If you have a problem with the way it's done, setup a boycott, make sure he never get's your API's again!  I mean, an ad on a free website?  The is right up there with the hindenburg on national tragedies.
---
reward ? only moon worth something in nullsec if you don't have an umbrella for your carrier/super/rorqual  
---
ratting is boring/don't worth anything in subcap if you can't afk-farm and with the blackout you can't afk farm, i love the blackout but they have to prevent umbrella and increase the reward in null sec if they plan to keep it (or make nullsec more dangerous, no more asset safety, can't dock your 3000super in one keepstar....)
---
Drones are probably one of the best tracking weapon systems. Heavy drones can track a frigate pretty well (especially the drone type that is specialized in tracking). The main issue is that they are pretty slow so a frigate could outrun one. In terms of ratting though, they will track well against nearly all rats.
---
Too much whine on the weekend
---
I didnt complain. U obv didnt read shit u just wanna troll
---
No, it just requires enough people running the right tier of abysses.
---
I was scanning systems in null sec right after downtime, so I assume it was all a fresh batch of sigs. I was hoping for data/relic sites or wormholes... but found neither and just gave up.
---
Again, I agree with you completely.   
---
I only disagree with OP suggesting that solo pvp is in a good place because "look, I killed a blingy ratter solo".  
---
His suggestion is that what he did is something cool and desirable - when in reality popping a ratter like that is boring and unimpressive, he just got lucky and tackled a blingy ratter that didn't get help - end of story.   
---
There's no YT video because the fight was about as cool to watch as it was watching the ratter shoot rats. 
---
It's just misleading is all, and suggests that something that is not in a healthy state in this game - is.
---
It was more like 65 nightmares 40 jackdaws against 50~ tengu/lokis
---
the nice touch is when the venture fitted a cloak on his ship (last one) as in, he's becoming better, tryng different stuff. idk what was the final execution but if i see a newbro tryng to mine in a nemesis after finding about cloaks... it's a very newbro thing to do but i suspect a more complex bait, second venture claoking up in a belt and then mr newbro in a bomber at 0 from cute ecm cruiser
---
Lol dude, maybe it's not worth it for you, but all the shit you described sounds miserable to me... so I don't do it. Instead I wh dive and roam in orthruses while doing abyssals for isk.  And I'm happier than ever :) Just waiting impatiently for a buff to blops &gt;&lt;
---
I have a HS corp that used to live in wormhole space and we left precisely for the reason that we wanted our members to become more proficient in the activities that wormholes require. I still regularly daytrip to WH space with my corp members, and everyone seems to enjoy it. We do plenty of PvE and the PvP option is available. If anyone reading this is interested in a good group to train with, contact Trident Newport in game. I will be with you as soon as possible.
---
Yeah I really don't understand why that was taken away or hasn't come back. T4/5 abyssals are way too high reward - and minimal risk, now that the fitting game has been min-maxed - to be available in highsec.
---
The only thing that ever rose in price consistently is the price of PLEX. The price of everything else has constantly been going down. The only thing that changes this downward trend are nerfs and buffs (mineral prices track buff/nerfs to the Rorqual pretty well). Something else that can change this is big in-game events, such as a big nullsec block moving to a new area. The rats of that area will get farmed intensely and BPCs of pirate items will drop in price.
---
All this has done is to make avoid playing at peak times.
---
Playing early or late in the day you don't see much in the way of the triglavians and the blackout does matter when there are fewer people playing.
---
Exactly, I think it is just a wake up call for the people who have never really known null as being "dangerous". It will be painful in the short to medium term as people adjust, but it really is what the game needs.
---
I think unsubscribing gets the point across better. CCPs changes this year have been fucking garbage.
---
No hard feelings guys, game is the game
---
Even worse... if you someone get alpha and gift a plex an hour later with another account it will stay paused till you log in your account and restart it
---
So much this. Give them a bunch of free frigates to try out, sure the Venture can be one of them, also explo frig and combat frig.
---
Show them explo, show them mining, show them combat sites and let them try FW places. Tie this all into a tutorial arc that lasts a few hours or a day.
---
New player retention would massively increase if people were shoved into PvP and into interacting with other players.
---
Isn't there a goon circle jerk post up right now about all the small entities taking sov in null in the north?
---
Yeah to a high degree that is correct. Only a small fraction of the value of abyssals is directly fountained as ISK through NPC buy orders.
---
CCP could also help that balance by nerfing the triglavian weapon systems, which are retardedly strong (a weapon system shouldn't have all three of high damage, high tracking and long range), which would reduce demand for them and for the hulls, reducing the price of triglavian loot.
---
No definitely the pvpers who are only running in cloaky ships and bombing excavators, those are the loss adverse ones.
---
No there just isn’t the activity except for a few hours around downtime
---
Congratulations, you discovered the progression of time.
---
dont lie ur wife was actually ur cat
---
did you know the blacking out of the chat/wh local happens completely on the client side?
---
here's what they don't want you to know - the good bots can see local. it's also why it sometimes bugs out and you can see people in local in wormholes.
---
i guess it's what happens when you decide to base your new chat system on ejabberd without having any competent erlang developers. the only thing they did on top of vanilla ejabberd was add a special control message to force people to appear on the roaster, so people (or Roskomnadzor, as happened when the chat was first introduced) couldn't block the XMPP port to not appear in local.
---
don't believe me? decompile the client and have a look for yourself.
---
If you're enjoying yourself, keep doing it. The one thing I'd take you up on is needing more than 10 days experience to start PvP. PM me and I'll get you on a roam with our guys whenever.
---
&gt;Literally none of what you wrote is the standpoint that I am coming from
---
But your statement that
---
&gt;But have instead now hit subcap ratters and miners from lets say 100% efficiency to near 0, that is a problem
---
Is just blatantly false. Unless you are in very expensive, high efficiency, pure krab setup subcaps with 0 support, you should easily be able to make money in subcaps. 
---
Nobody is dropping bombers bar on a single ratting Myrmidon/ishtar/raven/whatever in the ass end of space. Small roaming gangs or solo/small group hotdroppers (95% of what you will find disrupting your pve unless you are using high end assets for pve) should pose little to no risk to any group living in space appropriate for their size, with any clue as to how to defend themselves. It takes actively playing the game, and a small clue as to how to pvp, sure. But if you live in nullsec it should be assumed you are capable of these things anyways. To anyone who cannot defend their subcaps against 5-10 man roaming gangs in their home space, you are either spread too thin, or belong in highsec anyways.
---
I agree that solo pvp is very very rare and therefore dead.
---
&gt;feet pounds am pm
---
what is this?
---
Why should I move to the most boring place in Eve, to do missions?
---
Thanks
---
Define how nullsec was safer?
---
Man this reads like bad astroturfing.
---
Make 4 accounts, 1 alpha on each so you can try different things for free. One of the bad parts of the game is the training times, its quick to train into one role but takes ages to train into them all.      
---
            
---
1. Explo - scanning skills
---
2. Pvp/ratting/missions - drones/guns/missiles
---
3. Mining - mining/reprocessing.             
---
4.  Market - trade skills.                
---
              
---
Decide which to continue with at a later date
---
this falls under the farming of terribad null bloc playerd
---
This seriously is one of the best 3rd party tools
---
Guess you'll have to get good.
---
I play eve for the friendship and comraderie.  It doesn’t matter what we’re doing, camping gates, mining, missions, salvaging, as long as we’re doing it together and we’re on comms, i’m having fun. 
---
If you’re in nullsec just to pve, just run abyssal sites, you can do t4 and 5 without a suspect timer anymore and if you do frig abyssals, you get 3x the loot. 
---
You can also run incursions at 100m+ an hour.
---
&gt; No, I won't turn off ads because of a few bad actors.
---
The sad fact these days is that the shitty screening done by the advertising companies is making ad blockers a required part of safely using the internet. Once they existed to hide annoying ads. Today running with an ad blocker required to stay safe.
---
Signatures don't respawn after downtime. They respawn elsewhere after some time in your region after it is completed or expires.
---
Wormholes might have been rolled by others in your region because of blackout and the data/relic sites might simply all have been farmed before you explored.
---
Usually blue before you shoot them, just that it takes time for people to be set blue by alliance execs.
---
There’s absolutely no way an Ishtar or Enyo kills a pvp fit VNI.
---
&gt; the game is just less fun when I have to be dscanning every 3 seconds and looking at overview instead of just shooting shit and having fun.
---
Then maybe don't play in zero security space if the concept of risk is too much for you.
---
This thread is funny. Also pointless.
---
I love NPC Null. I lived in GW in 2017-2018 :-)
---
I wouldn't say it is harder but it is more involving and requires a bit more than just afk VNI ratting or carrier ratting with abandon. Like i said in another comment, this requires smaller pockets of defensible areas for the ratting and mining. I find it so hard to believe that the Imperium hasn't figured out how to do this yet. No, there is no local but there are gates, there are bubbles, and there is an endless supply of resources. All that is needed is some planning and slightly more advanced tactics than yelling in theta that you're tackled in your Rorqs because you didn't pay attention to local and intel for the last 20 minutes. There's still the umbrella and cynos. The weak will perish it quit and the strong will survive.
---
Name them. Shame them.
---
For catch the vast majority was just newbros not bots,  I know the systems I used to rat in are completely dead now, used to have a small community where we'd chat in local but now just nobody goes to them since it's so difficult to break even let alone profit from ratting there now
---
Quick question.
---
I've whitelisted zkill for the adblocker, do you get paid for an ad seen or an ad clicked? Or does clicked ad pay more than a seen one?
---
To be perfectly honest with you, I believe your mindset is the problem.
---
See, people were living here for a long time, so they were adapted to pre-blackout null.
---
Stop saying null was never supposed to be like that, it's been a decade. A decade of null being like that. Don't confuse point of view with the one of the playerbase.
---
Good question, thanks! These are the units of measurement used in the United States. But if you prefer Kilograms, meters, and 24h, feel free to use them (just specify the unit - e.g., 70kg)! Thank you again!
---
This feels like an odd zen koan.
---
So you're telling me that delve is magically 5x more active on a monday than it is on a saturday?
---
&gt; with the best defensive measures we can organize its just a matter of when the next enemy cyno will be lit and 90 bombers will be on us
---
This is the next problem that needs addressing in nullsec. There is essentially no counter to someone decloaking and immediately lighting a cyno. Either cynos need a spool up timer (1 min minimum), jumping to a cyno needs to take a meaningful amount of time (10s/ly?), or cynos need a decloak delay.
---
Possibly... but I've never scanned so many combat sigs without anything else. Strange indeed.
---
I think you're losing your time discussing with these guys. Most of the blackout lovers are vets with tons of ISK in their wallets so PvE is not somethings they'll consider.
---
Remember that most of the nullvets are allergic to krabs. Funny thing, they made their money on things you cannot do anymore.
---
I think it's trying to say something.
---
&gt; Is just blatantly false. Unless you are in very expensive, high efficiency, pure krab setup subcaps with 0 support, you should easily be able to make money in subcaps. 
---
No it is not blatantly false despite your opinion on it.  You have to factor in losses with a very expensive ship like that in null now.  What I stated before is correct.
---
&gt; Nobody is dropping bombers bar on a single ratting Myrmidon/ishtar/raven/whatever in the ass end of space. Small roaming gangs or solo/small group hotdroppers (95% of what you will find disrupting your pve unless you are using high end assets for pve) should pose little to no risk to any group living in space appropriate for their size, with any clue as to how to defend themselves. It takes actively playing the game, and a small clue as to how to pvp, sure. But if you live in nullsec it should be assumed you are capable of these things anyways. To anyone who cannot defend their subcaps against 5-10 man roaming gangs in their home space, you are either spread too thin, or belong in highsec anyways. 
---
Not in those numbers but they are getting dropped and murdered alot more now (I would also point out that a long time ago Bombers Bar totally DID drop on things like that alot just for the funzies when I flew with them abit.)  I also absolutely disagree with your premise that small roaming gangs should pose little to no risk to subcap ratters, they pose all of the risk to making any decent money doing it in null.  That is just a false statement.  That's even if you ARE actively playing while doing some of the most boring gameplay to make money to then do more fun pvp things.  I will never accept the argument that someone "belongs" somewhere as its just condescending horseshit.  Anyone can learn to go anywhere but that doesnt mean its WORTH IT.
---
&gt; Like every vital piece of data is showing a decline yet they are still insisting they are finding more targets
---
Fewer alts/bots/near-AFKers ratting, docking up before you even enter the system thanks to intel networks; more actual players out in space. Both can be true.
---
Adm was bot in some part of the universe that we all know.
---
No, my cats and dog were waiting at home for me. There was much zoomies when we arrived.
---
Plz take your negativity elsewhere and let me jerk myself &amp; my corp off in peace
---
Can't people stop with the "should be for experienced pilots". The fucking whole system of Eve is dangerous, you get killed in every system if you fuck up.
---
Thing is, playing with people in nullsec is more fun than playing solo in HS (lol LS). EvE grinding game is retardedly boring, why do you want people to invest in this game if they can't have fun (or be less bored ?) and at the same time get insulted by retards ingame/on reddit because "lol skill up nullsec is not for you" while owning themselves 27 rorquals or having old money in their wallet.
---
No, you got your gnosis to 10 killmarks because of luck. It could have ended immediately and probably will next time.
---
&gt;If you bite in any bait provided that is kinda your own fault ^^ and yeah in eve it should be a matter of time until someone kills you.
---
It's actually the bad game design that can make anything a bait.
---
It might not totally be over, there were recently reports of more drifter holes spawning which could be a prelude to them doing something soon.
---
&gt; my corp had a few guys (myself included) that made isk ratting in Ishtars while semi afk
---
It's a *good thing* that this isn't possible any more. You should not be able to print ISK while semi afk and expect there not to be a significant risk of losing your ship.
---
My hands are regular size
---
I have somewhere around 53 billion in skins. Not to mention some extremely rare (now a days) bpcs....
---
Delve has become industry and only industry. It’s why so many of your players stopped playing while other groups like Horde became more active. Is it really fun and exciting to grind out supers only to press f1 like a braindead baboon on an SRP’d op?
---
So you find the Bone for your group to chew on while playing lookout for the foes friends showing up is the main bread and butter  of such a person PvP?
---
NPC null is harder than sov null ? I mean sure, there are so many more hunters in NPC null than sov.
---
Sure.
---
But what do I know, I don't know how to compare activity and kb to disprove people.
---
Facepalm
---
But I am ratting in null right now! Just gotta watch my d-scan is all.
---
Am I doing a dead activity? Maybe I am a necromancer? Who knows..
---
Leave it to a CODE cultist to say something so absolutely meaningless as that.
---
sounds like the blackout to me
---
&gt;At least in null, low, friends could support you. 
---
Yeah, sure, they are totally gonna babysit you all the time. No. The reality is if you are found, you get ganked and nothing can change that. Because risk is often binary and badly designed, as it goes up, "content" is lost.
---
Fucking called it with the throwing up your hands and going "it's out of my hands google has to do something" as if that absolves you of the direct responsibility for the distribution of malware.
---
ok?
---
I'm pretty sure you are not a deity of anything. 
---
Anyway, specialize, don't generalize. T1 ships do one role well. Some T2 and faction ships can handle two to some degree (for example, an Astero can do both exploration and combat, but neither that well). 
---
T1 destroyers do combat. You can also rig them up for salvage. That's about it.
---
If your players are running to high sec instead of organising intel and scouting then they were probably never suited to nullsec in the first place.
---
Blackout is great and brings a much needed level of risk to nullsec. Now what we need is some balance adjustment to cynos and ISK generation so the risk is a bit fairer, and it's worth going to null if you can deal with risk:
---
- Cynos shouldn't be instant and they should be counterable. There are various ideas about this; personally I would like to see them have a 1 minute spool up (to match inhibs); for inhibs to be less bulky, less expensive and unanchorable, more like mobile bubbles, to encourage use, and to have a longer range (maybe 1000km); and for inhibs and maybe something like HIC scrams to turn off a cyno which is already up. This takes cynos from an instant-win button to a way of moving strategic assets around, but not straight onto a battlefield.
---
- Some forms of wealth generation which are too valuable in high sec should be nerfed - incursions (high sec only), the suspect timer for L4/5 abyssals, maybe L4/5 missions. (Also FW missions which pay a ridiculous amount when you're at T4, and can easily be gamed.)
---
- Risky ISK generation in nullsec can even be buffed, encouraging people to put ships out there in space and generate content.
---
CCP has never had any intention of helping small groups at all. Just look at their history of changes, literally nothing is there that helps small groups to be independent of the four main groups in eve. The blackout is the culmination of the last 5 years rolled up into a nice fuck you and its good. The big groups arent even sized buy blackout is helping them grow.
---
Then don't run them in HS, and have friends ready to save you.
---
And suddenly we have high tier PVE being a catalyst for exciting PVP content.
---
You win some, you lose some - In your case you win more ;) probs to you guys. Always farming my fellow alliance members that do not listen/watch intel
---
i think you give me too much credit :P  
---
Funamentally though, I may just have to agree with some of your points. I dont think eve needs more ways to create safe places, if anything I think it needs less. Day tripping is a choice to go dive into other peoples space to try and run their anoms, ore, gas etc. That style gameplay shouldn't have, in my opinion, a way to create a safe space.   
---
Safety should be earned by effort/work by pilots. Scouting, rolling wormholes, monitoring D scan. Most of which can likewise be countered to some degree by work on a hunter's part. There is very little counter play to chasing your prey onto a pos/tether/safe space.
---
Repeat after me.
---
While sound advice, its also kinda hilarious. Giving advice to a someone which cosists of *just use alts, scrub* strikes my funny bone.
---
Two really dumb choices. At least your leaving the game anyways.
---
&gt;(seriously i once did a 4/10 expedition and failed to do it in time and missed out on an item worth 400 mil)
---
How do you know this? Most 4/10s will give you like a 10mil module or nothing. You aren't going to pull an Invuln out of most of them. 
---
Also, the time to do them is literally a week.
---
People use 'afk' to mean 'not paying attention, but close enough to the keyboard to press warp every 20 minutes and hear NEAR pings'. And it was certainly possible to be doing that and be near riskless.
---
To be fair, here's a thing :
---
Low-scale ganking is boring after two days unless you're a madman that likes killing excavators.
---
High-scale ganking (e-g semi-large fleet) is only done with cloaky lokis and bombers since the blackout. Exit the fleets of T1 BC/BS, HAC and shit. Because these were used to have a fight, which you won't have because you'll get 356 supers dropped in your face in a matter of seconds, as nobody cares enough anymore.
---
People like to bash Goons with their titan drop and shit, but they were actually undocking stuff to fight these kind of gang before. And I'm on the opposite side of the political chessboard. Sure, if you were a retarded nanogang, you'll get your ass wrecked to the next fucking region just because, but honestly who cares about nanogangs ?
---
Just saying, I am on comms playing other games just for friendship-sake.
---
But is it worth the risk?  Why not just run incursions in high sec?
---
Yes, and just what would you do?
---
You would be surprised how often that happens. If a client wants a bespoke feature added to our product we make them sign a contract to pay for that features development.  Usually it suddenly becomes unimportant and unnecessary.
---
Servers aren't cheap :( If i went with AWS it'd be three times as much, easily
---
T5s are pretty risky by itself. And I don't know what stop people from attacking you anyways. Additionaly, you can't defend someone who is suspect without being attacked by concord, so having friends outside mean nothing.
---
Sometimes even someone on Reddit doesn't act like an obtuse asshole who won't listen.  :)
---
So...... don’t use his site then?
---
this guy gets it
---
I can answer the same way you are : Eve is not a singleplayer game, so why people are whining because super umbrellas are used ?
---
Because supers are too effective against subcaps ? Why shouldn't they be, they actually have no other fucking use in this game. 
---
You can take your "if you want to krab" and keep it to yourself, nobody likes to play a game the same way, and neither your opinion nor mine should matter.
---
CCP will do what they want to do, which is for now losing player count, Let them decide.
---
&gt;No it is not blatantly false despite your opinion on it. You have to factor in losses with a very expensive ship like that in null now. What I stated before is correct.
---
No, it isn't. My point, which you have missed entirely, is that if you are in a small group that can't defend itself, you should not have to factor in losses of an expensive ship like that, because you'd be an absolute fucking retard to use it in that situation and expect a return on investment. This is part of changing expectations of what is "normal".
---
&gt;I also absolutely disagree with your premise that small roaming gangs should pose little to no risk to subcap ratters, they pose all of the risk to making any decent money doing it in null.
---
They do not pose any serious risk if you actually have people around capable of defending, which any group that deserves to hold sovereign space in nullsec should have. To push off smaller gangs you need a small gang of your own with some semblance of coordinated composition, and someone with a basic clue of how to lead it. This is not asking much. It shouldn't be for an alliance that actually is capable of taking and holding sov. Balancing the game around people who are incompetent is dumb as fuck.
---
&gt;I will never accept the argument that someone "belongs" somewhere as its just condescending horseshit. Anyone can learn to go anywhere
---
So they need to learn, or leave. I'm stating a fact. Null for the last 3 yrs+ has been superhappycarebear land, now it's not. So the people that wanna be super ezmode carebears should go somewhere else, and those who want to stay and learn can do so. You say it's condescending, but in my experience the vast majority of the people who complain are just useless fucking dipshits who don't want to change or learn anything, just have everything handed to them on a golden platter as it has been. Every single person who actually left my smaller group as a result of how the blackout affected their PvE was a worthless fuckwit and not one of them has been missed. The did not belong in nullsec, not in a small group at the very fucking least, good riddance to them.
---
What all does it do?
---
What kind of content did you lose out on? Why aren’t you playing?
---
this is bait... this is bait
---
If you mean bashing ones head into a wall then no thanks, I'll pass. If you mean learning new ways to make ISK when CCP kills the one you were using, then I'm halfway there already. I've spent the last week or so practicing abyssals on SiSi so that I can do then efficiently, i.e. not losing ships to them so I can afford to lose them in PvP.
---
Unspoken are not really living up to their name since the blackout, hm ?
---
I mean, it kind of does exactly that. It's not his fault if you infect your computer with malware. On that same note, it isn't his choice as to what ads Google includes, only that they do or don't show ads.
---
Best way to avoid malware: don't click ads, use an adblocker, or just donate your fucking virtual pennies to a man providing an expensive service to us for free 
---
Or just shut the fuck up and use something else :v
---
Well, I'm somewhat stubborn. After all I've played Eve for over a decade. I also happen to like arguing to an extent, and I find it a bit ironic that I'm getting 'git gud' responses already.
---
If you don't want to do it fine.  But I've cut my teeth on hunting ratters for 11 years in eve.  I like playing the risk in the risk vs reward equation for pve.  I decided a long time ago that eve is a really tragic "space fight simulator."
---
If you wanted to argue that pve should be best done in PvP fits so that ratters can meaningfully fight back I would be sympathetic to that argument, however.
---
Didn’t live up to the name before the blackout either
---
What I love tho, is that non-null people find super ratting damn OP. Rorqual proliferation was OP. Supers aren't. Supers are not scalable and give less money than a solo dread in a wormhole, or a fucking gila in an abyssal site.
---
Supers are not that much safe against big bombing fleets or dreadbombs, especially with the fits you could see people using.
---
Supers were dying everyday outside of blackout, and supers keeps dying with it, at the same rate. So was local that powerful for them ?
---
Indeed today if you're ratting in a subcap, you're losing money.
---
You seem to not be noticing that that was the point.
---
There was definitely a bot problem. Just people didn't see it correctly, see the problem isn't that bots exist its that bots and players are indistinguishable. People like to thump their chest about vnis warping to a citadel all at the same time like that's not humanly possible. 
---
Except that you forget they are all responding to the same stimulus they all got at the same time: you entering local. The only valid move is to get safe because they will just die if you attack them. This gives bots the same stimulus and the same incentives as a real player making it impossible to tell their actions apart.
---
I wonder what the "awkward choices" were?
---
I gotta ask the question, but outside of Goons, Panfan and Legacy, who can counter retardedly large bombers fleets ? No one. Medium scale (30\~\~) fleets ? Not a lot of people. So whatever your organization is, there are a lot of bigger fish outside.
---
What are you doing then ? Joining the blobs.
---
Don't get me wrong I love fw as much as the next guy, but it's not the same. No where else in eve can you get a guaranteed 1v1 in an arena with a boundary that you can't warp out of.
---
Thank you Squizz for your hardwork, you are a gentleman and a scholar
---
And this guys, is why some FCs want more than 2 fucking dictors in their fleet
---
i love how it fails to locate my character files when its in the same folder at them
---
KRABS CRYING IN REDDIT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T USE NEAR2 TO PERMA FARM FOR SUPERS.
---
FUCK OFF
---
PVK WAS LITERALLY PERFECT BEFORE BLACKOUT, YOU ASSHOLES DIDNT KNOW HOW GOOD YOU HAD IT.
---
Thank for all you do!
---
I didn't say it was his fault. I said it was his responsibility. And i make a point not to donate to services with intrusive "turn off that pesky adblock" messages.
---
What would be the use of it then ? Randomly firing it in hope you decloak something in dscan range ? Combat probing in case there's a cloaky camper somewhere than can't instalog if you pulse it ?
---
I don't get it. You are complaining about not being able to fight groups that are known to throw it down. Why are you trying to fight them if you cant match what they have available? Have you ever considered a batphone?
---
I just dont understand this bitching about capitals all the time. Go pick on someone your own size is what they say.  Don't try to fight the bully and his friends if you are alone, it's common sense.
---
I'm just going to keep adblocking and soaking up the repair costs of computers fucked up by malvertisement.
---
Disable the ads until google gets the malicious ones taken care of.
---
He has a point though. HS is currently more lucrative than null unless you're using multiple rorquals under an umbrella. While being safer.
---
Seen INN, didn't bother to read.
---
It is not his responsibility to control what ads a mega billion, multinational corporation runs on websites that use their services you diaper. 
---
You can easily ignore the "pls no adblock" message and continue to use the site for free. It will not bother anyone. Quit being a baby.
---
maybe instead of just changing the ships and fits you use you could try changing how your alliance/corp operate
---
&gt; No, it isn't. My point, which you have missed entirely, is that if you are in a small group that can't defend itself, you should not have to factor in losses of an expensive ship like that, because you'd be an absolute fucking retard to use it in that situation and expect a return on investment. This is part of changing expectations of what is "normal".
---
Yes, it is, because even despite changing expectations that does not make the activity worth it still if your return on investment with ship losses typically no matter how cheap they are is too low.
---
&gt; They do not pose any serious risk if you actually have people around capable of defending, which any group that deserves to hold sovereign space in nullsec should have. To push off smaller gangs you need a small gang of your own with some semblance of coordinated composition, and someone with a basic clue of how to lead it. This is not asking much. It shouldn't be for an alliance that actually is capable of taking and holding sov. Balancing the game around people who are incompetent is dumb as fuck.
---
Except nobody wants to do guard duty in a video game.  Not to mention even if you do have a guard group you are likely still to be interrupted as they cant see the enemy coming.  With the tedious and time investment nature of the activities that is BUILT into them it kills your ROI constantly.    It's about balancing the game to be a game and with a balance of risk versus reward, not just all risk.  Balancing it ONLY towards the hunters is what is dumb as fuck.
---
&gt; So they need to learn, or leave. I'm stating a fact. Null for the last 3 yrs+ has been superhappycarebear land, now it's not. So the people that wanna be super ezmode carebears should go somewhere else, and those who want to stay and learn can do so. You say it's condescending, but in my experience the vast majority of the people who complain are just useless fucking dipshits who don't want to change or learn anything, just have everything handed to them on a golden platter as it has been. Every single person who actually left my smaller group as a result of how the blackout affected their PvE was a worthless fuckwit and not one of them has been missed. The did not belong in nullsec, not in a small group at the very least, good riddance to them.
---
No that is stating an opinion, an incorrect one.  The rest of this paragraph is you just hating other people who are different than you.  I am not arguing for going back to that, I am arguing for balancing it more towards that but no where near all the way, a middle ground as it should be.
---
Even quality is arbitrary.  Personally, I love killing ratters.  Without stomping on their efficiency we allow our egregious inflation.  And it's not that I hate ratters, I do it too.  I gotta pay for ships just like everybody else.
---
The problem with that empty space is that unless you install sov infrastructure yourself, it will stay empty in terms of asteroids and NPCs.  
---
People might not care about that system, but will totally nuke every sov and non-sov structure you put down.
---
As soon as he is aware his service is doing it and he has the option to stop it he is knowingly permitting the distribution by not turning it off.
---
It's especially great that the ECM race is shield tanking so when you fit ECM you also sacrifice your tank.
---
It won't really help when there are undetectable ships that can essentially just stop you or kill you preventing you making the reward.  Its essentially just all risk.
---
Fake news.
---
I wish INN and Goons would fail
---
&gt;  Randomly firing it in hope you decloak something in dscan range ? 
---
Pretty much yeah.  I didnt say it was....you know the best idea...just something is needed heh.
---
You lucky bastard... I don't have that much isk considering all my assets!! LoL
---
Contact ORGNC.
---
Remov snuff hat snuff
---
The stuff that was shot was not owned by Frat. Frat only showed up to shoot test, but since ph was helping test for that timer they were on opposite sides, hence the reset
---
If something, CCP and eve needs a competitor.
---
I love zkill and squizz, but I took zkill off the whitelist after google ads started popping new tabs open every time I load the site.
---
&gt;Were some of those people Botters? maybe. 
---
No, it's a definitely. Theq drone lands were a sea of bots, you could argue some areas only had a minority bots, but not drones. Perrigen Falls and Oasa were comically high adms for how few players there are.
---
Then again, he's right. Nullsec is keeping people because people living there evolved into several entities that were teaching new players a lot of things, will providing some help for them so they could grow faster, in the aging game that Eve is.
---
What are you providing to new players, ganks ? Irony and insults when people opinion doesn't deserve any credit in your mind ?
---
While you're right that giant tidi blobfest are horrible, you forget that you cannot understand that unless you lived through one. Big battle ads from CCP is bringing people in the game, not lowsec retardedly empty space, or L4 missions.
---
And if YOU find nullsec fleet brawls boring, that YOUR problem and YOUR opinion. If people are still playing in nullsec alliances and joining fleets on a regular basis, wouldn't you safely assume they enjoy doing it ?
---
On top of that: The ship with 0 Skillrequirements attacking a pirat Battleship. If it is such an easy catch/fight I will look forward to seeing your posts :)

---
Dm me for more details
---
How is it not easily disposable? Like wtf? Just click anywhere and it goes away.
---
There's essentially no counter to a rorq lighting a cyno and dropping some supers on a gang either. The whole instant escalation meta is garbage. It has a place in big ass sov fights where both sides are ready to escalate back, but in every day skirmishes it turns every fight into a gank.
---
Aight, spodbrain.
---
Find out what you want to do in the game and find a corp. So far for me the last 3 weeks have been the best ever in a mmo
---
I don’t understand why anyone would use an adblocker instead of donating isk. It’s ridiculously cheap. 
---
Well, unless you don’t play anymore. In which case, fair enough.
---
**THERE ARE NUMBERS ON THOSE SYSTEMS IT MUST BE A BOT**
---
I hate bots just as much as the next person but immediately assuming "*HURRR LOOK HOW ALL THE BOTS WENT AWAY DURRRR*" is fucking retarded. I interpret every person's upvote as one more baseless pitchfork pulled from their mom's basement. It absolutely blows my mind how now days people assert unfounded claims and other people support these claims as if it were scientific law without a single shred of evidence.
---
People have become really dumb, it saddens me.
---
Sorry bro drifters are in wormholes though go visit them
---
I mean, I do both. Can not be arsed logging in every time, and since I adblock by default I'd have to take an extra step just to whitelist, then log in. 
---
Kind of nonsensical.
---
Mail me in game. We can do merc contracts. - 250+ person WH Corp with merc experience. IGN: Fisher Kel
---

---
Fuck off
---
And the babyraging krabs that want local back as an instant intel tool aren't loss adverse?
---
There are thousands of other systems in Eve you can play in ...
---
This.  
---
With all the flaws and issues EVE Online has: There is no game like it, that offers the massive scale battles, the empire building and the economy.
---
There are already three primary anti capital ships in the game. The dreadnaught. The Supercarrier with torpedo fighter bombers. The titan with its doomsday.
---
The stealth bomber is also already fantastic for killing caps if you have enough.
---
So really, what you want is something nearly zero risk for the largest reward in the game. Right.....
---
Not everyone is made to play EvE the way some of the bitter blackout guys are advocating it to be.
---
Ask wormhole people what would happen if you were removing their ability to close holes to farm in peace. I know, it would break the whole WH dynamic, but just imagine it, while adding possibility for people to cyno in 200 dudes if less than 10 connections away. Would they like that ? A lot of wormhole people would leave to HS, because lol too dangerous.
---
Wormholes are fucking safer than HS and NS right now, but people are like "adapt or die these changes make sense".
---
And stop with the bullshit "you said that before". I wouldn't be speaking to german people with this mentality IRL.
---
Lol this is pretty much the answer to getting ganked doing abyssals.  IDK why so many people do it there.
---
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong but I have ad block software and have white listed your site so I get the ads. But I still get pop ups asking me to turn off ads once every so often. Is there something more I can do to stop that pop up?
---
&gt; while super ratting under an umbrella is just as safe as ever.
---
so half done just missing this part?
---
Impossible. Black out has killed small corps.
---
Google AdSense does a bit of both i think
---
Yep totally agreed. That's why my preferred proposal is for all cynos to have a spool up, not just under a cloak.
---
You aren't logged in, so it didn't know who you are...
---
there was an exploit some years ago, that you could keep the SP if you leave the game as omega and came back and get omega from ccp website and then log in.
---
Some got Banned and another ones keep their SP bcz they did it without knowing of it
---
And now, it just paise your quee if the omega runs out
---
You are dumb. Stop posting
---
Are you completely sure though? If no ads are showing up then it'll nag you
---
Bless you.
---
Alright mr i can't understand simple logical interactions.
---
More llke increasing ISK in nullsec. Which CCP won't do unless their nerf bounties because lol ISK faucet.
---
CCP shat on everyone for years with retarded balance patchs, lowsec dying, nullsec infinite anomalies, abyssal space and incursions.
---
People still say "go back to hs if you can't stand blackout nullsec". But to do what exactly, die of boredom ? Venture in lowsec and die of boredom ?
---
Sorry my dude, I'm advocating for you.  I'm saying that people saying your kills aren't "quality" are defining quality from their own perspective.  I think you're doing the lords work :)
---
Cry more about losing local.
---
Try trapping INIT bomber fleets with your small corp.
---
What CCP needs is to have a large organizational shakeup with nee leadership from the top down.
---
Finishing this while at school for my bachelor's. I expect top tier memes and results saying that video games cause violence kthx.
---
Most people who have moved into local in recent history are from highsec. Because the risk and reward scales were tipped with mechanics changes brought on by fozzie sov and jump range changes.
---
They are returning back to highsec because the risk and reward has changed again. They don't have the capability to thrive.
---
No you are wrong, I myself used to run 4 afk ratting VNI’s in east Deklein along with a couple other Corp members. The blackout deterred is from keeping them out as they would get caught more often. Then came the VNI nerf, so what do you expect? Of course there is less ratting, so don’t go around saying that we are definitely botters. We were not, afk maybe yea sure but botting was not necessary when all you do is warp to site launch drones and orbit.
---
But you haven't. And won't.
---
&gt; FRIENDSHIP IS THE LAST REASON
---
&gt; The more people I talk to and the more time goes on I see a clear trend in answers as to why they play EVE Online. It’s not the game. It’s the friends we have made
---
This is statistically less true when you look at populations that don't have much to do with nullsec mega aliances.
---
&gt; CCP’S APPARENT DISLIKE OF PLAYERS
---
&gt; A representative of CCP Games thought that to taunt a customer was the right course of action
---
I too like to generalize from anecdotes.
---
&gt; One only has to go back a look at posts and tweets such as CCP Quant’s epic meltdown on Reddit about ratting and CCP Zulu’s meltdown in a Dev Blog to name a few.
---
No game company engages in first-hand interaction with the entire player base about potential game changes as much as CCP. None pays a representative group of them thousands of dollars to fly and give them feedback. It is commendable that Quant was able to rant on reddit, because if he was in any other MMO/company he'd have no interaction with us at all.
---
&gt; NERF A LITTLE; BOOST MORE
---
&gt; CCP seems to nerf things in EVE Online more than any other game nerfs things and does so far more drastically than other companies
---
Only when they nerf your local CCP seems that way to you. 
---
To the rest, it looked like any structure that took the place of the POS/POS modules was OP af. Fighters were OP. FAXes were OP. Rorquals were OP. Whatever newly released turned out to be OP, and had to be nerfed afterwards. Local in null was OP when you think about it; it just took 16 years to nerf it. To many other people, it looks like they aren't doing enough nerfs.
---
&gt; PLAYERS REACT TO YOUR MECHANICS, SURPRISE!
---
&gt; Matterall commented to the effect that CCP had made players no longer use excavators. CCP Falcon jumped on it by saying that players are choosing not to use them. Thus inferring CCP had no hand in forcing players to do anything. 
---
What if the aim was to actually discourage such easy afk usage of excavators, to begin with?
---
&gt; SUPER UMBRELLAS
---
&gt; See Roquals above. They like to drop on arrogant small gangs and make them go boom. It’s fun to prey on them. Sort of like those gangs who think it is fun preying on the lone VNI or Rorqual. 
---
So its fun to deny kills and explosions and prey on hunters, but not fun when hunters are empowered via blackout to deny on their prey.
---
Copies all your settings from one account to another (keybinds, window positions, chat channels, etc.) . You can do it manually but this simplifies it.
---
I lived out of secure containers and T3Ds or cov ops in a C13 for the past year and loved it and my corp reached about 10-15 pilots in a couple months, but it was tough not being able to reship to go fight another group. I'd like a modification on the mobile depots to allow an un-packaged frigate in them or something so I can switch to a more combat ship, but I think my best avenue for something of that end is to keep pushing for FOBs. I've had a few ideas over the past year,  [Modular FOB](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/co18lo/modular_fobday_tripping_setup/)  [Small Citadel/FOBs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bip0w5/small_citadels_forward_operating_base_fob/)  [Small Citadels](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/85vy0j/small_citadels/), but I didn't think that an avenue without tether would be accepted by CCP since Cits/Refineries/Eng. Complexes all have tether and the FLEX structures only have 1 function so no tether. Finally packing up the C13 now and moving into a C2. Hoping a nerf to depots on reinforcement and an increase to storage or FOBs come along soon, but I'm not sure the C13 nomadic dream is happening soon sadly. Lol, with this post I kinda gave up and shooting ideas to see what would stick but I didn't know what to do with the POS mods.  
---
Also, you got my backing man. [7 Years Down the Rabbit Hole](https://i.ytimg.com/an_webp/X9P0f3KJCtE/mqdefault_6s.webp?du=3000&amp;sqp=CM6yxuoF&amp;rs=AOn4CLBE4OxF65a75GiX4S4e0S-G9StWcw) is what got me really into Eve in 2017 and I still watch it every few months. I've been following ya ever since first watching it and been listening to your podcasts since Day 1 of "Game of Holes" and now "The Hole Story" You are someone vocally fighting for wormholers and it's appreciated. Keep it up o7
---
That's not what he or I said.
---
Of course not but the could matters. The suspect mechanic is totally unfair to the recepient.
---
btw, never ran an abyssal site, have ganked people coming out of one when the mechanic was in place. So yes I'm advocating for not having an easy gank.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Not blaming you anyway.
---
Nullsec seems to be something people consider should have High risk/High rewards. Before blackout it was low risk/medium rewards, now it's High risk/medium rewards.
---
And yes I say medium rewards cause both HS and WH pay largely more for equal or less risk than pre-blackout null.
---
You're playing an MMO, and you're upset that there are other people playing the game with you?
---
shut up retard
---
It would be unfortunate if the only thing keeping them from toying with jump mechanics, but I think there is some space to play with it that isn't actual space aids (Fatigue).
---
Some ideas that had gotten suggested around here were like: dedicated cyno ship(s) \[not my favorite suggestion since it would be another alt tax\] or making cynos have a spool up time.  Another option might be making ships jumping to a cyno appear 200km away.  Idk or really care what the solution is, but I think most would agree that we need to tone down the power of capital projection.
---
NC/PL may not be in top form atm, but they could still roll over winterco if they chose to.
---
We should all count ourselves lucky that there are fewer people in null. Who needs targets anyway
---
Fu-k you. Go explore.
---
Why should people be forced to merge.. plenty of very happy small corps doing their own thing.
---
I mean literally I've heard FC's refer to some combat probers as God when they notice them on grid soooo lol.
---
 It's kinda not important but when you have it and noone else on grid does it's like, "yeah man I'm the guy who owns the dogs from John Wick 3,oh u got a pet lizard that's cool"
---
Careful driving though null sec like that Baltimore is -1.0
---
&gt;  it's super easy and widely available and works.
---
lol, no it fucking doesn't.  games that have bot detection software still get botted sherlock.
---
Yeah join a bigger blue group. Who would of predicted that  answer to blackout

Right - which would drive people to null/low to run them if you came out suspect.  The problem we're trying to counter here is everyone abandoning null ratting because of blackout.  If you're in "safe" null space owned by your corp/alliance, who cares if you are a suspect when you leave?  And if you want "safety" when running abyssal content, you can be safe in highsec - the trade off is you can't run anything higher than T3.
---
Thanks! Well, it is a widely debated topic, but I personally do not believe such an influence and there is poor empirical evidence suggesting this connection. This study covers several research lines, among which games and learning. I have written several articles about the topic (feel free to check here: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Enrico_Gandolfi) and my take on digital entertainment is absolutely positive and pro-active (I play video games as well).
---
Dude doesn't need a point. Have you seen the size of his kb.
---
Why should they ?
---
You seem to forget the fun dynamic. No fucking ISK-making activity in Eve is engaging enough, having solo wh dread and abyssal being the most "active" content.
---
Farming AFK is no fun, but at least you can do something else. Now you ask people to be aware 23/7 (reducing generated ISK due to less multiboxing), while preventing them to ever see an attacker coming in any way because lol cloaky gangs.
---
Then you lose ships. Well it's Eve, you make money, you lose ships, you make money again. But nullsec, outside of umbrellas, is no longer rewarding enough for that.
---
Indeed they lost the capability to thrive. Let's people move back to HS and stop playing, this is exactly the way the game should be : poors, newbros and industrial people to HS, while random bittervet pvper roam in empty spaces.
---
You actually tried to reasonably explain yourself on the internet to the masses.  Your doing it wrong.
---
You're joking right? A super is not gonna last long against a few dreads of course the super will take a few dreads with it too.  5-7 dreads is all you need to vaporize a super. 10 and its a debris field before the inhib is active.
---
I hate zKill, but I like your attitude.
---
If you just do it in some dead system nobody is paying attention to then it doesn’t matter if you go suspect or not because no one will be there to act on it.
---
I think you're looking at this from one angle only. A spool up doesn't affect defensive cynos at all because any capital can tank long enough to light one anyway. 
---
What we need is a set of changes to make *both sides* rely on cynos less. Fleets need to start moving around through gates again, both offense and defense.
---
I would imagine CCP having to compete would eventually cause this, if the leadership wasn't up for the task.
---
I'm saying the day i flew from one end to the other i did not pick up one ship on DScan doing anything unless the blown up safe cyno guy counts. That was Saturday. Today is not Saturday.
---
Lots of 'oops forgot to blue them' easier to just leave and shoot everyone.
---
God it must be a curse to have a brain as big as yours.
---
You do know one VNI per system is enough to keep the ADM that high right ?
---
I don't know why people are so mad at anything subcap related. untill they fix how much isk you make in a super under a blue umbrellla no one should complain about the risk of any subcap activity.
---
6. Quit 
---
Too many are choosing this option
---
Don't MAKE us take your open source code and pay to host it on our own servers!
---
You are dumb!
---
You aren't joking. In Maryland the speed limit is a joke. Not a single cop on the high ways
---
This, this is the post right here.
---
They weren't really newbie "content" anyway
---
Dang thanks for the reply
---
Lmao. Another comment from the casuals crowd. I WANT EASY KILLS
---
No really, I read the whole deal blah blah, some goons are unhappy, blah blah. 
---
Lemme break it down for you, is ccp perfect? No they aren’t. Are they flawed? Yes. Is this the best game currently available? Yes. So to steal a phrase, ccp isn’t trying to ruin the game, they are trying to flush the turd that is goonswarm.
---
Seriously, if your leaving, can I have your stuff?
---
Eve dev work gets intolerable quickly if you start putting deadlines on yourself.
---
For a cyno on the ship you're trying to drop on, a spool up long enough to allow an inhib to online would certainly make a difference.
---
tl;dr.
---
TIL: you also visit /r/choosingbeggars
---
Ratting without capitals as a whole. It doesn't matter if you have 2000 friends ready to help you on a moment notice when cloakies jump and erase you in 2 seconds from the system. it didn't matter before, but at least you were warned.
---
"WHEN YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY ASSHOLES, YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE."
---
WHY DO YOU ASSHOLES KEEP PM'ING ME THAT?
---
First step should have been removing chatlogs from client. Easy fix.
---
Pretty sure he's referring to that video, but I can't be arsed to watch it to find out.
---
Fewer people that just wanted to rat in the least engaging way possible, everything’s still on the market, nothing’s going up in price 1000%, so people are still collecting and building stuff that can only be made in null.
---
Anyone who left null because of the blackout was not ready to be there in the first place, depending 100% on docking up if something showed up on local and the local alliance ready to jump ships in to help.
---
Seriously you are resentful. Go do missions.
---
tl;dr CCP are pretty incompetent and need to sit down together and re-evaluate how they do stuff if they actually want to survive as all they've got going for them is most of the players suffer from stockholm syndrome.
---
Because d-scan helps against Recons and cloakies. Nice bait mah friend.
---
Small.  The alpha is only for like three counties, Oz, Norway, and one Asian country (not china) iirc.
---
I have the same thoughts. Tho I can't deny a correlation exists between people with extremely traumatic childhoods who grew up playing games that might have glorified martyrdom and revenge which may be affecting that individual's psyche. What do you think of that matter?
---
The problem is this is a player doing a high skill, high income, high risk activity in eve, and they are immune to other players.
---
Shut up retard  
---
thanks for giving me the oppurtunity to say this twice in this thread
---
You can just give him isk to turn the ads off.
---
Neither can I lol
---
Why are they so bad for profitability?
---
Are you a wizard ? Cause I'm sure as hell not going to do your homework.
---
Going out as a gang to aimlessly find another gang is a waste of time.  You MUST have some reason for people to run around hunting stuff.  Hunting ratters is one good reason, the spirit of moving sov with small gangs was one poorly executed idea.  Maybe pve for 1-10 people to do in pvp ships is another idk.  Hunting mining gangs is good too.  But just "lets go see if other nerds are flying around" is setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Why because you say so?  Corps have spent the time, money, blood, seat and tears to own the Null space they re in.  They should feel very safe nd be able to do whatever they want in that space.  You are the trespasser, it should not be safe for YOU, Sov Null should be nothing but pain for hunters, getting supers dropped on your head should be the norm as they are protecting their Land and property to the fullest extent possible. You think if another country invaded your land and started randomly blowing up your civilians that produced the means for you to exist you would sit by and only choose to engage for the "gud Fights",  hell no, you would drop anything and everything you could on them to serve as a warning of your lands and stop harassing your people. If you are so jealous they have the means and the power to semi afk rat that you have to ruin the game for them just to make the game fun for you, then it might be time for YOU to find a new game.  Go gank newbs in High Sec, cause it looks like that is the only "gud fights" you are really looking for. If you really wanted good fights you would join a corp and bash on other corps in open war and skirmishes, not killing carebears who cannot defend themselves
---
I'm actually impressed with the uptime. I cannot say that Zkill was every down down for me when I've tried to use it.

The adverse impact of free intel should not be underestimated.
---
I used to run 10 vni in deklein
---
You need to be more spefic mate, tell us where are you planning on mining at least (HS, LS, NS, WH?). Also keep in mind that you don't really have many options as an Alpha.
---
I almost forgot to upvote. Thanks for reminding me.
---
'Eve is too bland' says someone who has never played the game LMFAO
---
&gt; what do you expect? 
---
Personally, I expect that you have to be in front of the keyboard to earn a hundred mil an hour. To be frank, running 4 AFK ratters may as well be botting.
---
Alternatively, you all could set up a VM with Linux with virtualbox with a couple gig of ram and a vcpu and use zkill in there with ads enabled. Snapshot it before you use it and if it ever gets fucked up, you restore the snapshot. Modern computers can handle that with ease.
---
1. Your "Example A" is just plain false. In both the activities you've mentioned people spend less time in space than if they were ratting or mining. I.e.: Pushing people towards PI and Abyssals results in less available content in any given region.
---
2. The average(!) linemember of any nullsec alliance definitely has more than one account. And even if they only had one account, they can still have alts on that account that they use for crabbing, while their main is deployed.
---
3. You still did not provide any reasonable explanation of how you got to your "95%" assumption. You criticize the flawed statistics about Blackout that others have brought forward and yet you just throw a random number into the room that you pulled out of your ass 3 minutes ago...
---
instead of accepting cash why don't you sell raw data bundles and add some market features to also sell raw data?
---
Don’t worry,  till mittens swings his bankbook and flicks you like a booger onto the next game, you’ll still be here. 
---
P.s. your an asshole
---
&gt;Wrong idiot!
---
Are you saying you're the right idiot? I concur.
---
Click bait title but good point nonetheless. Eve places the burden of finding content on the player.
---
 because there were security camera bots set up in every system who would instantly report in intel channels as soon as local flashed
---
It seems like a waste of time
---
Which eviction was this?
---
Hey duder.  Thank you so much for what you do.  If I could donate I would, I make sure to show ads to give you all that gud money.
---
Good points and thanks for the probes! My 2 cents? Video games are multi-faceted tools that do not work for and by themselves. There is a variety of variables at stake (as you said, personal background plays a crucial role) when it comes to understand their impact and interpretation. We should work on this grey zone to understand the sector, covering pros and cons. In essence, what I am trying to say is that video games are not "magic wands" but instruments - they are neither bad nor good.
---
Outer passage had a little war too recently. Very little.

---
Great work on Zkillboard, keep it up please.
---
oh dope I get to go for three this is a good day  
---
And in highsec you can't be attacked without that person automatically losing their ship.
---
Well, I used to just hang around providence in a Hecate and get fights with the locals. Since blackout the only people I’ve found undocked and looking for pvp are other roamers like me, the locals were always docked/tethered.
---
Yep, that's the point.
---
I hear you. I'd probably be better off joining up with another Corp. Someday, perhaps I'll make one
---
Thanks will def check that out later!

We tend to fill specialized roles. In TEST our covops team (Predditors) are best known for [https://youtu.be/odio3cF_RyI](stealth bombers), but we also fly a lot of battlefield control ships. Dictors and ECM to cancel logi are common.

Btw, ya mind if I use your ideas on this in a post later?

They refer to the first Bioshock game, where MC was hypnotized to do everything told after someone says the words "Would you kindly".
---
From wiki: "Would you kindly" is a phrase that was programmed to function as a trigger for the post-hypnotic suggestions programmed into the mind of Jack. The system was created by Dr. Yi Suchong and was used by Frank Fontaine, posing as Atlas, to control Jack'sactions while guiding him through Rapture to achieve his plans for killing Andrew Ryan.

So people who don't want surprise pvp leave null to avoid it and get some fun out of the game, and your solution is to reduce the content they can enjoy as long as it props up the content you enjoy? All this would do would give another reason to join goon/test/horde for those looking to run pve content in relative peace.

I now understand. I have reversed my downvote and now hold the assumption that this was an underrated comment.

---
If you aren't good enough to hunt pvp'ers, hunt ratters.
---
Does it work on Linux?
---
Solo isn't dead lol, it's dead as long as the solo pvp pilots just dock and decide not to engage. But that is far from the truth, there are always people around main staging points that will 1v1, I myself do nothing but go out looking for those guys and get some great fights out of it. 
---
And I don't know what you mean by unfalsifiable, but of course you will get dropped/blobbed. If you hunt in someone's staging, expect to see mass numbers of kill hungry newbros, plus the usual home defense vets that will undock to chase off hostiles. 
---
But there is zero problem with the content, I find it on the regular, you just have to be willing to go get it, not be a solo pvp'er who docks up and cries there's no solo pvp :)
---
As well, if you're a part of one of the blue blobs, then it's makes it worse trying to find those fights when you already count your blues in the thousands.

---
Nice slippery slope.
---
But our production has only gone up. You and the rest of the chicken Littles assume that A) everyone who is not a big bloc is clearly inept otherwise they'd be in a bloc and B) that this wasn't the norm before.
---
You're crying because you were given something in the way of perfectly AFKable, decent isk making in relative safety because of the changes made to the sov system and jump ranges.
---
Blackout has shaken up your risk curve and instead of adapting you want to take the laziest road available and remove yourself to highsec.
---
Go on and leave. The chances of you being a player that provided content (chasing a gang vs docking up, roaming yourself vs being an F1 monkey) is honestly small, statistically speaking. From your mindset here I'd be remiss if you weren't a highsec transplant that only knows wallet growth simator online as the primary measuring stick of how you progress in Eve.
---
The question doesn't ask *if* gaming activity caused difficulty in interactions with other people, it assumes that gaming activity causes issues and then asks if the respondent continues engaging in the behavior that causes these difficulties with other people anyway. It's a question built off of an ungrounded and out-of-context assumption (gaming activity universally causes problems between you and other people), implies that the respondent should feel guilt about the fact that they are causing this problem, and then asks to what degree they are choosing to ignore that guilt.
---
Or, from a somewhat more extreme perspective, it's not a question that asks how your interactions with other people are affected by gaming, it's a question that asks "On a scale of 1 to 5, how much of a sociopath are you?"
---
Set Titan V, let your account lapse, resub a couple of months later :') knew a couple of people that did that.
---
Then they made it so you would continue training for three days after your sub ran out.
---
Now, with Alpha, it just stops.
---
This is happening in lowsec as well. Particularly those areas being targeted by fledgling null groups.
---
I'm not actually in Code.  I just support anyone who makes the game riskier for carebears.  But CODE loses their ship every time they gank someone - that's the least risk averse group in the game, if you think about it.
---
Forgive me, I am simply playing devil's advocate. But isn't this arguement a bit arbitrary? For example cigarette companies used the same arguement for candy cigarettes. But it was quite clear those led to early cravings for the psychological aspects of smoking from an early age.  Could this play a role in early psyche development? 
---
It's clear that there is a very grey area here in which we dont know what unintentional consequences the ideologies certain games pose on kids. For example modern warfare 2 in "no russian" where you massacre an entire airport of civilians is reminisce of school and public shootings. What effects does a scene like that have on the developing mind?
---
I'm sincerely sorry that you apparently have no idea how ads work, so give me a moment to inform you.
---
Companies who have services or products to sell sometimes need to reach out to potential customers in order to increase their sales, and therefore their profits. This is, in practice, a very effective technique known as advertising. In this, companies will create some form of media that has one simple goal: obtain potential new customers.
---
In this case, we will be discussing online advertisements in the case of the website zKill, as well as everyone's relationship with Google, a VERY profitable, successful, multinational corporation.
---
First: the basics. Google is not just a search engine, but also a host for an increasingly large amount of services in products. It's customers are quite literally anyone with an internet connection who uses the world's most popular search engine, which happens to be Google's own. Now, this is a very rough explanation, as I can't be fucking assed to point out every little gos damn detail that you chose to ignore, so I apologize for the bastardized summary.
---
Among these services are cloudfare hosting and advertisements.
---
zKill uses cloudfare hosting to provide us with his wonderfully well put together service for Eve online users, which can be very expensive. Squizz pays, as I believe was stated above, around $400 a month for these services, which include maintenance of the server his website is hosted, as well as other services I'm most likely unaware of.
---
Now, to poor people like myself, that's fucking expensive. $400 a month is just over 2/3rds of my personal rent costs. So, obviously, you need a way to pay for that.
---
Now, Google is very nice to us and offers a service known as AdSense. This next part is VERY important! GOOGLE WILL ALLOW ANYONE TO RUN ADVERTISEMENTS USING ADSENSE SO LONG AS THEY CAN PAY TO HAVE THEM RUN. For the most part, companies use this as a way to run their online advertisements in the hopes of gaining new customers. For those willing to run google adsense on their websites, depending on the amount of website traffic, google will reward them. In this symbiotic relationship, literally everyone benefits, including yourself, the user. 
---
Now you might be thinking (if you are at all, assuming you have some parts of your brain unaffected by spod mining), "Huh? How does that benefit ME, the ungrateful pos who thinks I have every right to an expensive to run service which someone needs help paying for in order to enhance everyone's experience with their crippling addiction to Eve online?"
---
Well I'm glad you asked, and it's simple, much like you assume me to be! But don't worry, I will also explain how it helps everyone else as well.
---
Companies other than google benefit because users will see their ads, and even if only 1 out of 100 people click, that is a potential profit increase for that company, provided they sell the person who clicked a product or service.
---
Google benefits because they ALSO gain customers in the form of potential service users, as well as gain money from providing their services, which can be used to expand their service infrastructure, and overall a better end-user experience. How do they gain service users? Easy. The above companies made profits based off their advertisements, so clearly, if I as a company see that success, I would most likely end up trying it for myself.
---
zKill in this case benefits from being able to maintain his HOBBY with revenue earned from allowing google to run their service on his website, in which end users may be recommended a product or service they need or want. Not only that, but using Google's services on zKill may open him up to opportunities which could potentially turn Squizz a profit, which could potentially be used to improve zKill. 
---
The end user benefits from this because it allows someone who runs a relatively expensive service to other hobbyists (for much less than what it would otherwise cost to run said service) to continue running this service and improve upon it.
---
Now, back to the adsense shenanigans I said was important earlier!
---
Unfortunately, other pieces of shit, who imo are scummy cum dumpsters, also use this service for their own malicious intent, whether it be in order to make money, steal other end users' information, or destroy shit because they feel like it. 
---
Logistically, Google makes so many damn transactions even in a single hour that it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between legitimate services or products from companies, or shitty malicious ads run by Bob knows who.
---
To compensate for their inability to remove EVERY single malicious advertisement, of which there are hundreds of thousands, Google has decided it is better for them as a company looking to make profit to just accept the paycheck and run the ads, but allow users to report ads they did not catch as malicious or illegitimate.
---
From a business perspective, this is a very effective and profitable move.
---
However, us as consumers do potentially suffer as a result of this.
---
This is no fault of the people who choose to run these ads, nor is it their responsibility to decide what ads to run.
---
If you want to be angry at anyone and stop being a fuckin rock sucking mongoloid, be angry at Google for choosing this type of business practice.
---
If you choose to not use services or websites which run advertisements, so be it. I'm not.going to stop you. But you should also get your fucking fat pod off Reddit, who ALSO RUNS ADVERTISEMENTS AS WELL AS USES GOOGLES CLOUDFARE AND ADSENSE SERVICES, quit your fucking terrible smug posting, and stop using Google. 
---
You're a fucking sitting contradiction you toxic mercoxit gas cloud huffing diaper venture baby.
---
Filled out, hope you don't mind some pretty vague estimated values for some of the things I don't measure.
---
Now if you'll excuse me I have some extremely non-problematic and non-addictive Eve to catch up on.
---
Thanks! Ahahahahah, have a good game then!
---
Just don't. Solo mining is poor pay, asocial, doesn't get you involved in 90% of the game or community and doesn't even skill you up in useful areas.
---
Hahaha because of luck, obviously if you think killmarks only come because of luck, then you either don't have a clue how pvp works, or you don't understand how to pick your fights properly. 
---
Not every pvp encounter means you just dive in head-first against all odds hoping for some luck. You pick your fights and take the ones that will be either good fights against equally matched ships, or you just take the easiest fights you can and not challenge yourself/your ship (if that's your thing).
---
But it's not bad game design, it's pilot choice. If I fly a T3 Destroyer, I know my ship has basically a 5% chance of killing a myrmidon, or Gila, and that is assuming they're pure PvE fit. If I decide to take that chance, and they turn out to be PvP fit as bait, then that is on me lol. The pilot has to be smart and know the targets, not just shoot any class of ship, and if they turn out to be pvp fit and kill you then you just cry bait hahaha.
---
doesn't stop people, trust me. They just use different tactics and different ships.

Insurance payouts are related to the mineral cost of the build as far as I remember. THis is why T2 ships dont insure well, as it doesnt account for the added T2 costs of the ship.
---
I probably saw you in Toronto too then! Have fun in Texas. It's always hot.
---
&gt; You think if another country invaded your land and started randomly blowing up your civilians that produced the means for you to exist you would sit by and only choose to engage for the "gud Fights"
---
Mate, it's a game. Hopefully you agree that IRL, the best outcome is no wars - which translated to Eve means no content and nothing to do. Using RL analogies is silly. Eve should be balanced for *fun*, not the ability to set up a domestic umbrella for perfect safety. Honestly I don't understand how it can be fun for the ratter or miner under a perfectly safe umbrella either.
---
&gt; If you really wanted good fights you would join a corp and bash on other corps in open war and skirmishes
---
I'm a wormholer so that's kinda what I did yes
---
Correct but that is much safer than nullsec.
---
You would be shocked at how often ships like recons end up locking you up and painting or pointing you faster than the main fleet ships can. It doesn't take much skill to recognize whats gonna happen shortly after.
---
All systems under 100 kills an hour is just rorqs killing NPCs when they spawn.
---
oh so wormholers are just a myth then, got it
---
Have you seen the Task manager while it get installed?
---
Check if your PC can handle EVE
---
I'M GOING BACK TO HIGHSEC BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE KRABS ARE.
---
FUCK YOU
---
You can still install adblockers though, so not sure what point you’re failing to make
---
Oh yes, I 110% agree. When I said "grey" I did not mean "innocent/neutral" This is why we need more studies that go beyond good and bad, black and white - it is just more complex than that! Kids may be exposed to games that contain inappropriate content, and online settings can be supportive as well toxic (this statement is valid for several media/technologies). In addition, parents often do not anything about the games their kids are playing...
---
waffles are better than pancakes in every imaginable way.
---
Lol dude.  It's not hard to find a pvper, they're looking for you.  If I just wanted to find people to shoot at me, I only gotta go like 10j.  To how many orders of magnitude easier it to find a fight idk, but it must be at least 50x easier to find a pvper fight than it is to catch an attentive ratter.
---
Then just answer “1” or “no” because if gaming hasn’t caused issues then you haven’t continued it while it causes issues.
---
Aside from my subscription I spend no money on the game...I asked around and it’s the same for the couple of folks I regularly fly with.  Making ISK drives me to do things, without that it would be a strange game indeed.
---
Yeah fixed daily life in null!  Impass hasn’t been as fun since blackout!
---
level 1 mission for a deep safe?? tell me more!
---
I do too, which is why you won’t find any of my VNI’s ratting anymore. I moved onto different forms of making isk. So I laugh when I see people complaining about less targets or ratting during blackout. Not to mention having the audacity to blame it on “botters” when in fact (maybe hard for them to believe) that these are real players that either went somewhere else in Eve or quit.

The economic reports CCP regularly releases disagree, but ok. Whiners gonna whine.

Obviously if you find managing your time difficult as is, EVE will probably only make the problem worse. That being said, there are plenty of interesting and low-time-commitment play options in EVE. My advice would be to complete all the "career agents" to the very end and see which of the major career paths interests you. Then try and find an active corperation which fits those interests.
---
If you stick with it, EVE Online is one of the most rewarding games out there, messy as it can be, even if you only play for a few hours a week. That's something that's kept me around; I can meanigfully participate in the universe whether I have 1 hour or 10.
---
The biggest long term concern will be your wallet :)
---
I honestly am having a absolute blast flying a griffin. I essentially turn carriers into useless loot pinatas. Supers get to play with 1-2 fighters. ECM is worse than it was but not many things are useful out to 80km let along 100km+.
---
Or i know that google has the ability to do a better job keeping malicious ads of their platform. But they don't because everyone just keeps using it despite the security breaches. 
---
This changes the relationship from web hosts and advertisers benefiting mutually beneficial while being net neutral on end users to a predatory one profiteering off the distribution of malware. 
---
I have 0 problems with advertising in and of itself. Only with the malware that it ends up being the channel of.
---
Not sure what you are implying with this comment. That’s not my char nor VNI fit, my fits had a neut and scram for brawling with solo hunters. Lost most of the time but always had fun getting caught.
---
safer how? You tackle something bigger than a battleship you get 4 faxes and a super dropped on your head.
---
If only I'd remember such implants are actually a thing when I'm a bit short on fitting.
---
To be honest, classic EVE sounds like a blast. Actually having to organise and coordinate shit is pretty fun. One of my favourite memories in EVE going way back is being part of a convoy in an old wormhole corp.
---
I'm a proponent/proposer of the Cyno Spool idea; let the first responders be an actual QRF nanogang or Enyo ball, then escalate to cruisers and battleships if the fight needs it, and then only bring in the capitals if the fight *really* warrants it. Or from the offensive side, when the attackers are sending in their waves, they send in their first wave of frigates to clear space for a beachhead, then bring in the heavier ships as the location is more secured. And from another angle, if either side wants to bring titans to the battle, they may need to bring the titans in either at long range or possibly even off-grid, to avoid having the cyno ships get sniped off before the field is bright enough to support a titan jumping in.
---
Secondary idea for interaction with Jammers: If a Cyno gets Jammed out, it doesn't instantly lose its full spool-up, so that a Jammer would pause the ability to bring in reinforcements, but wouldn't hard force both sides to revert to frigate bridging in between jams.
---
:thinking:
---
I’m not sure whether I, as a hordeling, should be proud or offended at this comment.
---
guessing because mining in high sec is cancer and not worth it.
---
That's a whole lot of words to ignore a whole part of the reason the blackout being shit is due to the meta being only cloaky bullshit or the smallest of gangs or dropping supers on shit and no mid sized fleet fights or subcap responses anymore but ok
---
&gt; No game company engages in first-hand interaction with the entire player base about potential game changes as much as CCP. None pays a representative group of them thousands of dollars to fly and give them feedback. It is commendable that Quant was able to rant on reddit, because if he was in any other MMO/company he'd have no interaction with us at all. 
---
Quant's rant was retarded because being the data guy should mean you UNDERSTAND your data. Supers at the time were doing around 140-150m/tick on people that were really focused doing so, which meant you were also active, so giving a number almost twice bigger than the reality enraged those that knew what was really going on.
---
Yes, CCP is active, especially on Reddit. But are they really listening ? Are they really listening to the CSM when they tell them their changes are retarded and will break Eve (Rorqual, Citadels, etc) ?
---
As much as Falcon is active on this subreddit, his ideas are too drastic and unfit to Eve as a game owned by a company that seek to make profits. And even unfit as a game on the scale of Eve, because you have " Massively  " in MMO, not "30 randoms dude on a server with 3000+ systems". Even he accepts that his ideas will never be implemented, and he must know even 1% would kill the game and the company with it.
---
&gt; Only when they nerf your local CCP seems that way to you. 
---
You're kind of unfair to goons members that were vocals about how rorquals and injectors were broken, almost as is you hate goons. And I'm saying that being on the opposite side.
---
&gt; What if the aim was to actually discourage such easy afk usage of excavators, to begin with? 
---
Oh no, i'm a game developer with full access to my own code, why can"t I think about I less retarded way to do things ? What CCP has done is preventing the use of expensive stuff because you actually have little to no counter to excavators bombing runs. Effectively deleting the use of something you farmed and paid for with no way to recoup your investment, on a moment's notice.
---
And yes, CCP is used to retarded patch and balance changes.
---
&gt; This is statistically less true when you look at populations that don't have much to do with nullsec mega aliances. 
---
This has been one of the many things said over and over again on all Eve medias : you're staying more because you play with friends than because Eve is engaging. But statistically I can also assess that it is true for everyone in the game because I too like to use statistically without having actual data.
---
&gt; To the rest, it looked like any structure that took the place of the POS/POS modules was OP af. Fighters were OP. FAXes were OP. Rorquals were OP. Whatever newly released item turned out to be OP, and had to be nerfed afterwards. Local in null was OP when you think about it; it just took 16 years to nerf it. To many other people, it looks like they aren't doing enough nerfs. They did give a lot of tools/abilities to the null mega empire linemember, and most of them were OP as fuck, and they didn't give nearly as many new tools to other people. If they won't nerf your new tools, I want a new hunting ship class for each citadel type you got. 
---
Then again, whose fault is it to have left the game rot in such a way ? CCP's.
---
CCP "buffed" nullsec because it was their only way to promote their game, because only nullsec brings heavy assets and heavy player count fights. Don't tell me Core stabs FW and HS missions are bringing players into the game. Nor keeping them in it.
---
You cannot blame people for using what they are given, and you cannot blame people for being mad when you get something vital removed because "oops we were retarded, let's implement some drastic changes on a moment's notice, the 0.1% of the playerbase we let rot in the last 10 years will be happy".
---
Seriously, you saw a bunch of nesters in a wh and didn't automatically think they were smartbombs and react accordingly? Sigh, and this is the elite of Pandafam these days.
---
kill your self
---
*shrug* I’ve never been in horde but zkill is pretty clear on the matter prior to noraus crawling up gobbins #£¥
---
Facts are facts. Horde used to run roams on frat for years before noraus took a knee (or two)
---
Because unless you're retarded and drink CCP koolaid "HS brings us more money than NS", there are way more active pilots in nullsec than everywhere else in the game.
---
The only thing nullsec is allowing is scaling, because people having 40 rorquals is fair. But if you are one person, HS brings more money.
---
The solution is the same as it always was, prevent scaling by removing the "afk" part of Eve pve.
---
I mean, if it is the chaos era you might as well shut local down everywhere, turn of all the timers, turn off gate guns, and end Concord/faction navy responses in high sec. 
---
Then after half of the player base leaves the game, you might as well add a button that immediately blows up any ship someone has locked. Then, and only then, will we appease people looking for easy kills. 
---
PS. I say this after having spent 8 years as an eve pirate. Hunting, catching, holding, then killing human piloted ships is *supposed to be* hard. Not easy.
---
Gotcha, i'd argue there's no risk in losing a ship you fit specifically to blow up cheaply, but they are a great recruiting tool for going to the null corps to be a carebear or to teach new players to look at local/dscan.
---
And how does the blackout effect cloaky camping when in goons hq on any given day there are no less then 30 afk cloaky campers, but you guys are mining anyway? So your arguement makes sense if no one was mining/ratting when you had a cloaky in local, but you guys did it anyway.?????????????? Please fill me in here.
---
&gt; Hold the pod! Hold the... WHO DID THAT?
---
mission site can spawn outside dscan range ...
---
No cynos, no blobs, the safest subcap ratting you’ll get outside of hisec, plenty of small fights, people actually using battleships, what’s not to love?
---
Thats why wormhole space is so great, it maintains the social aspects of old eve that made it so good. WH corps actually have people in voice comms. Go to null, 90% of your people are not in any comms or standing fleet at all, and chain dying to the same gate camp. Go wormhole space.
---
maybe use scouts? maybe have a response fleet on standby? maybe scan new sigs and roll them if your that scared.
---
LEGO my EGGO!!!
---
Always thanks.
---
I can’t play eve without zkill, reliable scoreboard is very important feature for me.
---
no
---
Find, does not mean win.
---
It seems as if the spod has gotten ahold of you. Shame..  
---
Its Almost as if you didn't read what I had posted, so I guess I'll make it easy for you.

---
In provi??
---
when i say cloaky bullshit i dont mean the cloaky campers, I'm talking about the only way to catch people outside of the main umbrella space is by being cloaky so you dont show up on dscan before you catch them and then cloaky bullshit not being able to stand up against a response fleet therefore leaving us with the only content being gank and run away or feed trying.   
---
small roaming gang as like 5 people is the same as it was pre-blackout, but its shit for small to mid sized fleets looking for fleet fights, this doesnt get talked about a lot but it definitley one of the biggest sources of entertainment for a lot of groups and sigs etc  
---
Like the thought process behind the blackout with what it hoped to achieve was fine I dont have an issue with wanting to shake up null or "make it more dangerous" but in practice its ass backwards, rather than doing something about how oppressive supercapitals are to subcap PVP they've gone fuck anything pve unless you have supers and fuck your pvp unless youre cloaky and want to only gank. it's all very one dimensional now.
---
KINGS OF ~~LOWSEC~~ Blackout??
---
Good job bros glad so see you're still doing work
---
You should use mine instead, I've recruited 50+ so mine gets a special landing page and a considerable bonus in amount of SP and isk rewarded [https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=a861aa2d-2b21-98i7-9b44-00836129-gb12](https://pastebin.com/iVjLZDDc)
---
Ok devils advocate who doenst agree, but did live in high sec for a long time.
---
in null sec, you can have clear definition on on who is the enemy.  If !Friendly== enemy, and if enemy, you can go hunt them, or dock up. 
---
 in high sec, you cant determine who is just a random person going through, or a just rolled alpha ganker, and you have no ability to preemptively deal with them.  There are ALWAYS people in the systems you are in.  You are having to gate through systems somewhat constantly, and gatecamps are a regular occurance in spaces you need to pass through.  You cannot do anything about said gate camps or cloaky scouts, just need to be a tough enough target to not be worth the hassle.  If they want to suicide on you, there's very little you can do about it.  
---
In nullsec, everyone can shoot each other, if someone is creating a hassle, you can form a fleet to deal with them, you can do a lot to remove their base of operations/make it difficult to move.  you can be doing your own thing, but still have a cohesive enough group to quickly flash to defense of space.  
---
in null you have cloaky camps, and ability to drop really big things with little danger, but there were people watching your back and looking to hunt those groups back.
---
Wait. CODE is talking about risk............
---
CODE are the ice miners of pvp. Just how many exploit complaint support tickets have you filed after accidentally engaging something that had a turret?
---
Do you have Minmatar frigate blue tiger skins? Alot of them are not listed. i would need slasher breacher wolf and jaguar.
---
Must be nice to use Ad Hominem arguments in every single post you make on Reddit, eh ?
---
I spent more time in wormhole in my Eve career than in NS, and I don't fucking care about blackout because I happen to live under an umbrella, if I ever wanted to make ISK which I do not need.
---
But you only think about yourself, which gives away the kind of person you must be.
---
Stop being an arrogant asshole and start thinking outside of your own bubble will you ? Try thinking about other people for a change. 
---
As a slippery slope, your production going up is as real as chemtrails. If you were producing LESS before blackout, it would just mean you were either not in nullsec, not in the same region, or you simply had less people login in. You don't magically ramp up your production of magic mushrooms overnight.
---
But here I am, leaving for highs.. oh wait.
---
&gt; Accepting cash will raise some of your expectations and what you think I owe you.
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo. At least speaking for myself. But yeah, people are jerks so nothing to argue about that. Anyway, 10/10 would donate just to help keep it running.
---
that was amazing, well played
---
Shame there's all of 10 corps there
---
What he said
---
&gt;I suspect the absolute majority (95%+) would choose to get back out their and adapt their playstyle.
---
you seem to have this flawed notion that the only income possible is by ratting in anomalies.
---
people don't have to quit or get 'back out there' they can just go and do something else, like level 4s in high sec - it's not like the income from afk ratting in a VNI was that good to begin with, it was easily eclipsed by so many other things that now it requires you to actually do something it's just not worth the effort for the piss poor payout.
---
if 'adapting' means more effort than it was, the activity simply isn't worth doing - and because it doesn't have to be done, it won't be.
---
I have also a wish as non PVE only PVP player, make it so that the guy who got suspect timer when he was blown up in a split second after people waited in their gang for him the 20-50mins have 2 month suspect timer to sell for the whole corps of the involved pilots which he can sell as killrights. Here is your Hisec lowrisk gang into you get baitganked by abyss 3 runners in cheap fits. :) Next Suggestion is make people in blingy ships have longer dock times so we dont need insta locks etc :P. I dont mind they bring those suspect timers back but for sure ccp lacks in the whole action, counter investment part. When the counter needs 2-6 time the effort of the action its badly balanced what applies to every other pvp game as thump rule should also apply to eve. And nope pick a random system where nobody is in is not counter play thats pre play strategy.
---
No not provi
---
They lose a throw away ship specifically set up to for this. That's not risk. That's like calling the depletion of a mining crystal "emergent game-play".
---
Do you really think the VNIs littering those areas almost 24 hours a day pre-blackout were all players?
---
That dude is salty about blackout because he's a pussy. Go ahead and downvote+ignore him like everyone else does.
---
&gt;Right up to the point where people realise Eve simply isnt worth it anymor
---
Shit on power projection? Then what, exactly, would be the point of alliances? As far as I see it, alliances provide 'content' precisely because they are large player built organizations who have figured out how to project power. This game *would not* be eve if coalitions, alliances, and corps could not project their power. It would be boring as shit--and in order to achieve your goal you are going to have to remove half the mechanics in the game, because even if you nerfed, cynos, supers, capitals, and faxes--removed them entirely--large alliances would still project power. 
---
You would, legit, have to remove death penalties, simplify the economy to equalize everyone... basically you would have to attempt to nerf basic human interaction by making the game boring for people who like the game for the emergent gameplay that basic human action enables.  You might as well convert eve into a guild wars arena.
---
bro quit being a bitch. literally all of ur problems in this game can be solved by just not being a bitch
---
Beg more.
---
&gt;There's so much empty space now why would one rent.
---
go grab 49 other dudes and try and take your own little corner of null sec.
---
....
---
yeah, that's why.
---
Shut up retard.
---
Scared isnt the right term more like it isnt worth anyones time and doing it would be dumb.  Also you cant scout cloakies coming in on you, not with any real success.
---
Not a myth but they operate under different mechanics and are often safer now than null sec.
---
A super and 4 faxes is still weaker than concord.
---
I'm not joking, you're just wrong.  Yes I have.
---
Talwar and Hound blue tiger would be great as well.
---
And you did this in all timezones nearly 24 hours a day with rotating characters? Wow, dedication. Oh well, I'm glad the afk """gameplay""" style is (almost) dead now.
---
&gt;stay in comms, put alts out on gates, keep notice of fleet movement in the area, don't rat or mine on weekends, and you guys are going to be just fine.
---
or go and do anything else that'll give you more reward for a fraction of that effort.
---
Why can't you adjust? I would expect this to be a thing with the VNI nerf, regardless of local.
---
That's fair, I agree with that.
---
Am I missing a step in how one goes about Corp theft? Assuming it’s k-space, can’t you just fly between the relevant structures, dropping items into your personal hangar, and then asset safety it out at your leisure?
---
yes a pussy who complains solely about the fact theres a lack of content, fucking idiot
---
waaahhh im blue 80 jumps out why is there nothing to do waaaahh
---
Its was all a CCP con to create a backstory for adopting No Local and use the players to kill bots.  We all got duped.
---
u a bitch
---
Yes, generally the DM is in charge of making and enforcing house rules.
---
ok retard
---
" you cant scout cloakies coming in on you, not with any real success. "  
---
wut? been doing it in WH's with relatively high success for ages. gitgud
---
refer to my previous comment, tia
---
Both those CCP options sound very likely to me really. Considering how many exploration bots I still see all over (more obvious than ratting bots), I'm going to assume it might be both.
---
same tbh
---
Protip: Don't use any of these shitheads links. They're full of shit trying to get easy money, and lying about what you get.
---
The problem here is that high sec ganking is not remotely a level playing field. The attacker has enormous advantages since the now-suspect pilot (who's only "criminal activity" was running a mission) is prevented/ punished further if they try to defend themselves without surviving the alpha strike first. The entire HS combat mechanic system is a train-wreck and needs a complete overhaul. Combat occurring isn't the issue. The terrible mechanics are.
---
So you're trying to speak to the point of view of small alliances while living under an umbrella.
---
Cripes, way to invalidate everything.
---
We've roamed all parts of space and haven't changed our tune or methods since blackout occurred. Things are only getting better and I find it hard to believe that people are flocking away when I still see plenty of real activity when we are out and about. Blackout has helped our gameplay, full tilt.
---
I'm telling you people are throwing their toys out of the carriage because they are refusing to adapt. It's easier to just move because a wallet going down is losing gameplay to them.
---
They have the same mindset as any F1 monkey, win/make isk at minimal risk.
---
Let them go back to highsec, they need the nannies.
---
Yeah, I dont believe you.
---
Buy low, sell high
---
Me too, which bring me to the followping point : Why fucking bother talking about bots when in reality CCP is the problem ?
---
this guy clearly knows his shit.
---
This was 100% my experience in Delkin/Fade/Pure Blind in 2008.
---
Suddenly reentering Eve in mid 2018 was a bit of a shock.
---
I found this same feeling again in a WH corp, and is the reason I haven’t had much to do with null except NPSI and exploration.
---
Wormhole krabbing is extremely safe. I’ve been in my Corp for about a month now and none of us have lost a single ratting battleship, because as long as you roll for good krab holes you are almost perfectly safe. 
---
If you could roll stargates and jam covert cynos, then there would be a comparison
---
Have you ever heard of a cyno?
---
Yeah I bet every VNI ratter had perfect attention to local for the 23h a day they were running.
---
It's us, the real people that are the untermensch. If only we had the dedication they had.
---
I WISH I COULD WORK FOR CCP READ REDDIT AND TAKE THE MOST CRYS AS EXAMPLE FOR GOOD GAME CHANGES AND FUCK IT UP MORE THAN USUAL OH WAIT CCP COVERED THAT ALREADY -,-
---
I think that talking about the might make CCP do more? We can only hope. Also noting that bots are nearly indistinguishable from players in some things (like ratting) highlights a huge problem with that gameplay type and perhaps something for CCP to consider (if they ever do).
---
&gt;claim the treasure that's EXCLUSIVE to YOU!
---
*and the smartbombers at the landing
---
There are a few different types. But I think mostly they try to get access to corp hangars or even structure anchoring and then just wait for the least amount of people around and start grabbing as much as they can. A few corps have "open hangars" that I think are the low hanging fruit. Most well established corps have all this stuff well under control. It's mostly the new corps ran by experienced people that this happens to.
---
How are you choosing to define win? Cuz if winning means me taking an orthrus and mercing some kiki's, then it's still pretty easy.  If you want me to hold the field 3v20+ then you have unreasonable expectations.  This is all beside the point though.  You are not the arbitrator of what is meaningful pvp.  If all you care about is 1337 gudfites, cool.  Ima be over here dodging your camps and killing miners cuz their anguish sustains me.
---
Keep at it beggar
---
You're beautiful
---
Since we’re talking about copying one another, you first
---
That's true actually, they still need to dick slap supers and then cynos. Fleets on both sides should be taking gates to get things done, not getting bosoned and not teleporting 50 bombers around.
---
I'd like to be that optimistic but for now time showed us that CCP does almost nothing against it.
---
It shouldn't be that hard to change Eve PvE to deter botting.
---
I would get involved with Horde. They literally accept anyone. They provide new player packages and have a pretty robust group dedicated to helping new guys get their feet situated. 200M is plenty for flying around T1 frigs, I'd recommend EWAR as a new player as it's extremely useful and lets you be a decent distance out from combat and not die all the time.
---
Freedom units.
---
Then again you read my post wrong. There are definitely bots in Eve.
---
The existence of Intel channels, NEAR2, screenscrapping bots watching gates on stream, and other unknown tools make people leave while not having to watch anything.
---
Push to talk, pvp on prime time, most people have 2 or 3 accounts already, whats the problem?
---
Drekavacs are heading to &lt;100m per hull, why would you want to stop this?
---
Use f9 to open system map, then hold your dscan key and click a celestial
---
This is very true.
---
Often times players are on celestials and stations, so track and do a 5 degree scan of them to easily tell if someone is there
---
Yup 97, 95, and 100 seem to be the speed limits not interstate and route numbers.
---
Delve

i dont mean ingame

P W.S IS RECRUITING
---
It isn't just Google, I know. I work on a high traffic website and all the major ad providers are just that, providers. Not vetters, not creators, just middlemen providing ads to sites with "free real estate." 
---
Bad actors get through, found, and blocked, by us not the provider. We pass along the information, but by the time they get to it the bad actor has moved on to a new account.
---
Dont forget that you need an open help desk ticket before doing anything. That's automatically 5 minutes. Also when I do work there is a minimum chargeable work time (mine is minimum 1 hours pay, so if it takes 15 minutes, I'm still paid for 1 hour). Especially if you are doing field work. That keeps people from calling you out to the field and expecting to pay $15 cause you were only there for 15 minutes.
---
Players is a loose term. AFK ratting and mining is not 'playing'.
---
I think you might have missed the sarcasm.
---
Eve is a Sandbox. You can literally do anything. There's no right or wrong.
---
I would join a Corp that's able to fight back against the people who you're at war with
---
Oh good point. It is annoying having to log in all of the time.
---
I think the point is that activity *is* down in the pictures.
---
Why do people play in nullsec then?
---
If u use mine, you won’t get anything special, but you’ll help a poor person have a short period of joy and piece.

---
pretty sure everyone has access to dscan and ability to put scouts on gates
---
I never advocated for small alliance, I do it for anyone even the risk-adverse krabs that fill Goon/Legacy/Panfams ranks, as they have as much right as me or you to play this game.
---
I used to be mad at game company that made the game casual and allowed players not willing to put any effort to reach the end game. But Eve is different : there is no end game. With the years helping, I also see the other side of the dice : a game has to have a low entry bar, but a high reward ceiling for those that invest in it. Eve has HS as a low entry bar, but nullsec, while supposed to be High risk, High reward, is either too safe (preblackout) or too risky (post blackout).
---
Put more rewards in NS so people start thinking it is worth being in space, and you'll see the difference. And yes, it will be fucking exploited to no end.
---
But you're right when you say people are refusing to adapt. Blackout is such a drastic change that people that don't have a lot of time, people in TZ where their corp/alliance is lacking numbers, or people that don't have enough skills or money are so largely impacted that they find no reason to stay there. 
---
Not everyone can adapt as easily as you may have, nor as fast. Then again, is it good for Eve as a whole, or only for a few people ? Probably not for Eve player count, as I assume people going back to HS will stop playing eventually.
---

Yeap. Idk why google doesn't crack down on it. Imagine how many more ads would get seen if there was a guarantee of no malicious content.
---
I threw it together in five minutes before our duel!
---
We had a good laugh about it, the main point is just to catch someone off guard and die in a blaze of glory but I got neuted
---
Didn't wanna bring my vexor too and have a 20 minute vexor Rep fest but we have a rematch planned
---
its not true though, gone from having more than 3 regions to explore for fights to well just that, like 3 regions to fight, being in goons holds literally no bearings on targets
---
Per real person, probably not. Per account, by a large margin. This is the heart of the issue.
---
And why people play in nullsec ? Because you actually can do something interesting once in a while, and be with actual people.
---
Exactamundo
---
Cyno is a bad game design and there is no counter. You win/lose without being able to affect the outcome.
---
Don’t leak our elites tricks.
---
Idk why you came here to talk about whatever it is you like to do.
---
My point is that solo PvP is not in a good place in this game, and you clowns saying you can bag blingy ratters like it's special doesn't change that.
---
Good article. We tend to always hope CCP will improve but it never does. That lack of leadership you mentioned is the core problem. Sadly, that means the very people who are the problem would have to be the ones that fix it. I think we all know how that ends.

Stuck how? It takes a slooow, weak ship to get caught by Trig gatecamps, you can just fly elsewhere. Keep a few ships in more than one location, then you can even travel in a shuttle or pod - trigs don't kill pods.
---
For solo to live, there must be something in space you can do solo. Solo was always dead in null, and its now dead in FW since its broken and people dont care anymore.
---
&gt;you just have to be willing to go get it
---
Dont have 3 hours to roam and then get blobbed/dropped/caught in camp.
---
You are very dumb. I didn't mention local.
---
null is much safer because your entrances are always static
---
concord doesnt rep the target
---
Trained some nice BS Vs and such back in the day when sub ran out :D Sadly not quite Titans.
---
nestors are one of the most popular RR platform in wormholes, and the FC didnt know it was a red giant... Also its like a year okd
---
Why did I read this with delonewolf's voice in my head?
---
I find it interesting that we're debating all over r/eve how blackout killed null because everyone docked up and won't risk losing their ship, yet there's a group that loses their ship every time they undock, and here you are saying that's not risk.
---
How can both be true?
---
right? thats why you keep goons blue? lmao
---
This right here is a great comment!
---
What about our other super leet strat of seeding a few of their doctrine ships with sebos fit so that they shoot faster than the rest of their fleet and throw off their alpha.
---
I've engaged plenty of ships that have turrets.  In fact, most of the ships I've engaged have turrets.  And were bigger than my ship.  Yet I still won.  Walk me through your reasoning?
---
Hold down C and click on something in your screen, like a stargate or station or something.
---
I’ll check it out :)
---
Finally someone connecting to help him learn the true spirit of Eve Online.
---
That video was something. The title already make me think smartbombs!
---
Then the Rorqual uses 1 smartbomb and kills a bunch of drones. I'm like really if that is it and they kill the Rorqual that's lame.
---
A bomber! Omg they are gonna get bombed, haha! *dies* Nevermind.
---
I was so happy when I saw the Nestors warp down. :D
---
I still love my kitsune in munnin vs munnin, i basically say "fuck 3 of your logi" and then on my alts i say "fuck 3 of your dps" w my crucis. 
---
EWAR and ECM is still good, just not as much so for solo
---
OR! You could send the very same 40mil to me and I guarantee to double your isk.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I would love to see some kill comparisons for players, with this reduction in NPC activity did we see an increase in player activity in other ways? Like Jumps, Kills etc...
---
Love you too boo.
---
A few tips:
---
You can c+click anything to align your camera to it, or v+click to align your camera and DScan. 
---
Alt + Z will toggle all brackets allowing you to see the icons of things like moons in space which may be hidden in your overview settings for your currently selected tab.
---
Ios is trash is pretty easy to grasp
---
Fortune favors the bold.
---
It would be hysterical if their mobile game wound up taking chinese players away from EVE to play that instead.
---
Even better, wait for an incursion in system and bookmark any of the sites - they're off 45AU or more many times.  Instant deep safe.
---
so your cloaky is permanently cloaked? never enters or leaves system never docks? i don't belive you
---
Blackout is actually amazing and invigorating. I haven't had this much fun in EvE since the original nano nerf.
---
Firstly, none of the things are actually forgone conclusions. NO, you DON'T have to remove death penalties or simplify anything.  Your premise is not accepted.  LONG before caps were as prolific as they are today, Alliances did just fine for themselves using subcaps.
---
The way YOU see it for alliances to hoard space they don't use is what IS the problem.  They have laid claim to hundreds of systems of which they use a small fraction of.  The value of being in an alliance is having the ability to defend the space you use (which is what I think we agree on) HOWEVER they should NOT be able to hold entire regions unless they somehow amass enough people to populate a region.
---
You've seen this thread, what do you see? The vast majority of null is, as it has always been, empty.  People congregate into a small collection of systems that pale in comparison to what they control.  The reason to control such sprawling empires? To make it harder to lose your space.  The more buffer you have, the more time you have to respond as well as strengthening your ability to win through attrition.  Neither of these promote emergent gameplay and only promote stagnation.  Why would anyone want to spend their time grinding through such a miserable system?  And consider this: With the current ecosystem, there is virtually no possible way to swing up.  If you want emergent dynamic gameplay, you want ways for smaller entities to meaningfully threat larger ones.  I don't mean that a 100 man alliance can come in and steal the HQ of a 10k alliance.  But 100 dudes should absolutely be able to harry the perimeter of a larger alliances sov, ESPECIALLY if undefended.
---
...Actually, reading your post I've concluded you're actually delusional.  You're assuming tremendous things I've never said.  I didn't say anything about deleting the jump mechanic or cynos.  They MIGHT and PROBABLY end up being part of some CHANGES but deletion? Can you be so obtuse to not think with some nuance? People have proposed plenty of ideas that tread smaller steps: Make cynoes require a spool time, restrict cynos to specific ship(s).  There are plenty of creative ways of reducing the ability of the big "bullies" of EVE from removing the ability for 20 man corps to have fun on their own in null.
---
Rorqs are ships on dscan&gt; I made no claims as to what kind of ships they were. Just that his claim was bullshit.
---
and they killed 5 of them, the jacks slipped past and killed around 5b horde assets afterwards.
---
Thank you for your comment!
---
I actually quite enjoy abyssals and doing exploration.  I just don't think anyone should be safe while doing it.
---
sadly the real counter people do even horde sometimes is simple. JUST dont undock deny content = no fun for the gangs.
---
I've never been in a Eve group that has used something else than push-to-talk for voicecoms.
---
Have you ever lived in a wormhole Corp?
---
&gt; Google does not intentionally distribute malware.
---
By ignoring the problem and not vetting adequately they effectively are.
---
&gt; That is why they include the ability to report malicious ads,
---
You cannot report malicious ads when they hijack the page and redirect you. This has been a nasty loophole for a long time not solved.
---
&gt;If you're so god damn insecure about your computer's health because apparently you fucking click every single god damn ad
---
You don't have to click ads for them to do nasty things anymore grandpa you need to get with the times.
---
&gt;and a lack of common sense, as well as the inability, or perhaps the stubborn mindedness and complete denial, to use adblock services, 
---
I do adblock.
---
&gt;maybe use some fucking antivirus / antimalware programs / services 
---
I am the virus/malware cleanup crew. I'm the person grandma and grandpa bring their computer to when it gets royally fucked by whatever nasty they came across. Everything from fake email attachments to fake coupon programs and yes to malicious adware infections caused by ads hijacking web pages and redirecting them.
---
True
---
I have adjusted by sitting under my alliances super umbrella just like everybody else. But I would rather be in Catch where I can get some fun content.
---
heh, this time with actual ships =D
---
you're just trash.
---
Lived in Paragon Soul for a while before cynos, I know your pain.
---
Define "mid sized".
---
then you need to scrap wormholes, cause most of the time fleets will use wormholes to enter enemy space. Wormholes &gt; Gates &gt; Cynos when it comes to ganking enemys with different fleet compositions. Hunting specific known target = cyno.
---
feel free to come to amamake and ask for a 1v1. any and all offers will be accepted and honored.
---
Blackout ... "[it really whips the Lama's ass!](https://youtu.be/D1uQQ5QVgqU?t=2)"
---
MY FUCKING ALTS ARE UNSUBBED I HATE TRIPLEBOXXING I MISS THE OTHER 2
---
&gt;:c But they all look the same!!!
---
Lack of *your* content.
---
absolutely!
---
You can say that solo PvP is struggling relative to how it used to be.  I agree even, the incessant heavy tackle jaguars are a plague.
---
I'm arguing with you though because you've decided to not talk about solo pvp's difficulties and instead shit on people who like to solo pvp vs ratters.  Just because you don't like it doesn't bolster your point.  Stick to your guns and demonstrate how asinine it is that as soon as you slap a point on a thanny it'll cyno in 5 hels 10 HAWs and a rag.
---
I always pay ISK for no ads DESPITE using adblock. I would not turn it off, so I'm glad I can pay with ISK to still support it. Thank you for that and providing this stuff in general.
---
A question though: why does it take evewho sometimes just hours, sometime almost 2 weeks to register characters joining orleaving corps even when their equally used alts of the same person joining (or leaving) at the same time? That puzzles me a little bit. Do you know that?
---
I agree that it has gotten harder for mid size fleets to get fights, most of roaming null these days is basically little more then hisec miner ganking. The days of a 40 man fleet getting a random fight with another roughly equal fleet is kind of over sadly. That being said it was already like that ore black out. The only way to get a fleet fight is on a timer sometimes, or from a response fleet when you jump on someone's super or rorq sometimes.
---
I just went to bed but will be back in 9 hours or so, send me eve mail or something (Cunn Schell)
---
Exactly, that's why this guys comment seems so odd. Like does he even play this game?
---
Concord perfectly jams which is stronger than the reps.
---
It was good times, yeah was extra work but was good times.
---
CCP made the mechanics. Three years of citadel spam, crazy rorq income income, skill injectors and easy farming and keepstar spam making more supers inevitable. EVE passed the tipping point and CCP was the one that did it, not the players. If this game wasn't so boring and the space was filled, there would be tens of thousands of blue donut supers and rorqs and millions of bots. That's just the game they made. Blackout doesn't fix any of this. It still sucks just having bots, rorqs, and supers to try to kill. Human players in subcaps in null are all but gone now. There is still citadel spam with shitty timers. They never actually finished tiericide. Instead of balancing old ships that no one ever uses, they keep just adding new ships. You could go on and on. It's not thenplayer base that sucks, it's CCP.
---
No it's not? You can make amazing isk with 10 or so rorqs
---
I've never been in one where that stops people talking endlessly about shit 8 couldn't give a fuck about.
---
Comms are always the worst part of any game. It's not exclusive to eve.
---
no problem m888 ill be on after work. ironically in about 8 or 9 hours haha
---
Yeah, so talk about that instead of glamorizing a shit niche of this game as if it wasn't in need of any help.
---
That's the fit that many of the, um, heavy subcap ratters in Dek have adopted. Good on you for PVP-fitting it, and see you out there in the neighborhood (offensively or defensively)! The PVP fit isn't necessarily for winning the fight, unless the hunter screws up - god knows I've lost plenty of those fights, too - more just to be difficult to kill until a friend can arrive to swing things in your favor.
---
You have around 70k players as blue. Or something silly like that. I have zero blues. I don't have any problems with content anymore after blackout. Stuff is great and some old friends re-subbing constantly. Gonna be having lots of fun after summer ends and more old farts rejoin.
---
i too fit nanos to my brawling shield thorax, you brought a vexor so its pretty obvious you really wanted the win.
---
yes i have
---
Considering the current climate of MMORPG development, that's very unlikely. The genre is very stagnant and on the life support of a few remaining games that are all getting old. Maybe Star Citizen can give them some sort of competition when it comes out in 2054.
---
I got my first 2 solo kills yesterday. Took me ~17 lost ships... but hey, I got 2 kills!
---
I was roaming around the Amamake area and was getting into fights pretty consistenly.
---
And you nullsec monkeys wonder why people don't want to live in smurfville supercap umbrella land.
---
We have temporary blue standing while evictions occur in wormholes. Nothing like this circle jerk however.
---
idk why were even having this discussion anyway, like I said the ships and tactics used are different. In high sec you plan on killing the target before concord arrive. In null you don't do that
---
Make your own account and recruit yourself. IDK if that works but you can try.
---
Obviously we need a Council of ZKill Micromanagement to run all these changes thru committee first. This lone wolf with his finger on the button will not stand, man.
---
Okay, that's great to know. Now can you please share those lines with us who don't know how to use powershell? I'm genuinely asking you here, no sarcasm or snark.
---
Alliances were smaller back then, so it was a full team effort. Lots of comrades made on the escort. Lots of fun crashing other's convoys as well. yar.
---
Have you tried taking a brave pill and undocking? I mean you might lose a ship and be made fun of on your corps weekly roast. You also might actually get a frag. 
---
Just an idea though.
---
If this works, I'm going to be so goddamn happy.
---
BTW, u/Windsigh, what does your flair mean?
---
Small renter corps omegalul
---
what's with all these awful front-page attempt post titles... they have all been embarrassingly bad - this is like the third one today
---
Because thats like saying "BUH I use faction ammo! That costs some small amount of isk! See, I take risk!!!" And acting like that is anything close to what the topic is.
---
&gt;  But just "lets go see if other nerds are flying around" is setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
that's literally what a lot of lowsec entities do on a daily basis
---
I do undock and i do get ganks, but its just that ganks its boring, you tried not talking out your arse?  
---
just an idea though
---
I have one region of outright blues but still doesnt fix the problem of there only being content in say test space or horde space or delve
---
You should take a nap, you'll feel better.  I started this dialogue with you because I was already invested in advocating for solo PvP.  I jumped on you because you started the conversation by shitting on someone who's enjoying it.  If you want to challenge the op, demonstrate the other areas of solo PvP that have lost ground. 
---
Basically I'm trying to invite you to be constructive instead of trolling people because you're bitter about the state of the game.  There's plenty to be bitter about, now channel it into solutions.
---
My advice? Don't. Seriously, don't.
---
Check this: why do you even want to start/run a new Corp? Do you have a unifying goal or mission? Do you have a pre-established group that you can rely on as your corp's core? Are you coming at Eve with some kind of ambition?
---
If you just want to start a Corp so that you can role-play that you are sitting behind a large oak desk, then just stop. Allow me to explain what is going to happen: you are going to draw in the absolute bottom of the barrel. You're going to get the once-a-monthers, the social nails-on-a-chalkboard, and the "mine?"ers. Your underlings are going to berate you with unrealistic requests that will turn into demands. People will tell you how you should be running the Corp. Discord and pandemonium everywhere. And ultimately, you are bound for 3 destinations.
---
1. You fade out of existence. You inability to motivate your members to work together or even log in and do things reaches an inverse critical point and those that actually want to do stuff realize there are better places to do it. The rest just fade to black.
---
2. You are betrayed. Assuming you manage some level of success, someone you depended on will reveal their true nature and take your Corp for all its worth. Maybe it will have been a setup from the beginning. Maybe one of your directors was suddenly looking over your cute Corp stockpile and realized he could cash in big time. Either way, your limited success will be your own downfall.
---
3. You don't die and aren't betrayed long enough that you just accidentally happen upon a winning formula for success. But your success draws you further and further into the diplo-political arena of New Eden, and eventually you align with some larger group either major or minor. But unless you establish a clear direction at that point your Corp is just going to be poached of all its talent until you are basically widotting into a bigger group.
---
You going to pay him the 5k to keep the sit up annually? Then shut the fuck up.
---
I can't believe people are still complaining about blackout.
---
pre-blackout i was getting those medium sized fleets baited out and into brawls every other day, which is why im so "salty" about the blackout, it's straight up nipped that in the bud and lowered the diversity of content that I can do
---
first stay away from trade hubs when you are war deced.   
---
second would be to ask your corp for help. if they can't or won't give any then consider returning to the starter npc corp or try finding a corp that is willing to help.
---
Thats on par with the rest of eve's corps tbh
---
lack of any content outside of ganks
---
20-40  vs 20-40 subcap brawls
---
That's also a great license plate you got there bud.
---
Evewho doesn't iterate through all 17m characters evenly, it tries to check recently active characters more than others, but it is far from perfect
---
Omg yeah, we would literally be shooting at others convoys like the wild west. Sometimes both convoys would get blown up and it would turn into a full fight over which side gets to loot the field. Sometimes one side would win and start bringing new freighters out to the loot and then the losing side would come back for round 2. Great times.
---
That's what i get for outsourcing the math on that
---
No, just hard to detect due to cloak... and thats nice, you're wrong.
---
rebind dscan to spacebar
---
set dscan to 5 degree angle, hold down space and click an anomaly in your probe scanner to scan that anomaly (be it combat site or fw plex) without having to move your camera
---
you can scan all planets etc using the same method from your overview
---
with combat probes you go launch your probes outside your target's dscan range, jump back to dscan range, then start lowering your angle from 180-&gt;90-&gt;60-&gt;30-&gt;5 to pinpoint his location, then lower your scan distance until you have him pegged down at which point you place your combat probes on top (better do it with manual placement using shift if you don't have good skills) so you can scan him with a single pass (recall your probes immediately afterwards).
---
And the "blue every fucker in 40 jumps" attitude isn't to blame? How about half-galaxy spanning coalitions?
---
Players got used to easy mode Eve, face it. You blue'd half the galaxy because it made you feel safe in space and everyone has natural loss aversion. Chaos era is either way too late or something the game sorely needs.
---
As the saying goes - "there's no use crying over spilt milk" - so supercaps+rorqs online is here to stay, for better or worse. 
---
**In my worthless opinion** the best things CCP could do are:
---
* find a way to harshly and permanently dissuade mass alliances, mass blues etc. Exponential cost on alliance/corp footprint in space, exponential cost on blue/red standings. Make it all payable to concord or some shit, who cares, just made everyone break up into little groups so that the organisation is such a fucking headache people just start breaking up. 
---
* Then overhaul the stupid indices so that activity is required way more often than currently to maintain them and make it trivially easy to take low activity systems, as in one single day and the system is yours, and critically, add some huge fuckin loss to losing a system. All your structures blow up the instant you lose a system, and everything inside dies. 
---
* Then bin off asset safety entirely, it doesn't exist in WHs and we're just fine. 
---
* Then spend a whole fucking patch balancing isk reward across high/low/null/wh, so that if you want mad isk you head further into unsafe territory and take part in real isk vs reward scenarios, not the pretend risk we had pre-blackout.
---
* Then shrink nullsec by about 30%. Why the fuck is there a goddamn arse load of massive fucking systems in the drone lands? It's all empty shit space for krabs, there is literally no point to any of it. Null should surround low/high, not be it's own fucking continent.
---
* Then add NPC null to every single region. Roamers/gankers need places to stage and it's fuckin impossible in most regions. Wanna blops drone lands? Go sit in space cause there's no npc areas, no lowsec in range and no stations/structures open to you. Oh well, not like we're favouring the 'defenders' right?!
---
* Bin off all real-time ESI information, you should get intel in the game. You think the USA breaks the fourth wall and asks the supreme controller of the universe for real-time industrial info in Iran? No, cause the fourth wall doesn't fuckin exist and neither does the supreme controller. They go get it themselves, putting scouts (read: drones) at risk to do so.
---
/endrant, please don't hate me, I know it's all shit.
---
But hey, we can all dream can't we.
---
A wormhole takes you to one system, from there you need to use gates and cynos to move around in it. 
---
If camping one gate doesn't secure all of your space for you maybe you can try moving your gangs around also. But of course it's easier to just teleport supers to a cyno, and it's easier to teleport 50 bombers to a tackled rorq. Which is why everyone does those things instead.
---
Pretty sure cloaks ignore dScan and that not everyone has the ability to put scouts on gates (or wants to do guard duty in a video game constantly.)
---
Sorry but due to complications at birth, my mouth and my anus are one and the same.
---
But seriously though. Fucking grow a pair.
---
It's written in Java so it should do in theory, but I haven't tried it and I'm not sure where WINE saves AppData files to
---
The entire playstyle is dependent on rolling a new alt and meticulously creating a believable, misleading zkill history.  Impressive in a sense but another egregious example of how you really have to abuse alts to play this game at the highest level.
---
mute them? like its rare that the annoying people are actually significant in eve and not listening hurts you
---
Why aren't goons just dropping response fleets like they always have? The blackout has no impact on PvP via response fleets which should be good content for goons.
---
Nice insight, covered some variables I wasn't 100% aware of. Ill give it some more thought
---
----  I suspect the absolute majority (95%+) would choose to get back out their and adapt their playstyle.
---
Totaly wrong lol,   for now that 95% just went down to alpha and some of them stay active as alpha doing things in hisec with only 1 character and not using theyr alts, and now if ccp want to reverse the blackout they will find that now all people prefer stay in hi sec as alpha account not spending time and money in this game
---
And that 95% its already shaking up eve from theyr systems and playing other games. CCP just made a big mistake with this blackout becuse that was the push many people need it for leave eve
---
No u
---
are you able to comprehend sentences? and are you able to parse what words mean? how does talking about lack of stuff to do correlate with the answer of grow a pair? does it just feel good to be off the mark or something?
---
Open up subreddit rules and scroll down a little :)
---
waaah i cant blob attackers as easily, waaah
---
It really is easier to type with a dick in your mouth
---
Research the Loki, it's the best t3c for pvp and also works quite well in pve when refitted
---
Cant give you fits for pve but test it on Sisi
---
I recommend atleast having a Scanner alt or an orca to live out of and store loot
---
T4 aren't too high a reward. Run a few and tell me they make you too much money. They're a bit above L4's, but not a crazy amount.
---
And no, if you get a bad spawn you can still easily die. People lose expensive blinged shit all the time. Also plenty of people run the PvP room, that's as risky as it gets
---
Some time before the heat death of the universe /s
---
because like all super cap umbrellas, they just drop super caps because why wouldn't you, in the same line of thinking before blackout non umbrella space had people in it where the only response they could have was subcap and you could bait out fights that way, and now thanks to the blackout they arent there to bait, because why would they be? it absolutely has an impact on response fleets
---
so you read what I said and went "you know what, I don't feel like addressing that point I will instead make up an argument in my head to argue against"
---
Implants are required for that level of DPS and they will get you even higher kinetic DPS on a tengu.  Over 1100.
---
&gt; this includes the use of alts which frankly speaking everyone uses if you want to git gud in the game.
---
I really wish that wasn't the case. IMO, players shouldn't *require* alternate characters to get the best performance out of the game, it should just be an option if you feel up to managing multiple characters for the benefits you can get from them.
---
I don't think I could keep a handle on it, TBH. Multitasking is *definitely* not my strong suit.
---
very good point! It is a pre-built scale created by other researchers, but you are right, it is something that should be added. Thanks for completing it!
---
This guy gets it.  Definitely needs doing.  Though I also argue something to at least try to deal with cloaks actively is gonna be needed to balance out the risk vs. reward abit more.
---
I have zero difficulties in finding fights. Absolutely worst case scenario is going to PH and fighting them there.
---
They always bring a good fight.
---
I don’t understand how you are finding it difficult so I assume that you are either waiting for someone to deliver you f1 content or are sitting docked up complaining on reddit.
---
You would think a marauder would be able to survive a haircut gank of at least no more than 5-6 people
---
Amarr Slavers deserve to die! RP aside, NRDS is one of the pillars since eve started for non minmatar (or traitors to their brother and sisters) to hang out in nullsec/experience it without being forced to join a block. No Blackout is not the problem, risk averse advantage in the hunting group to the prey is the problem :P. When CCP would learn that bringing a change to some game aspect maybe also needs a counterbalance. Dumb Example intel station or whatever, a auto dscan station which can see to which alliance/corp or pilot the ship is registered too etc. to help those few RP'S and more pat on shoulder cva guys keep their NRDS. But hey they didnt learn it for 13 years dont think they start to learn it now.
---
&gt; Open up subreddit rules and scroll down a little :)
---
[does so]
---
[sees rules]
---
*Pfft*, how'd that happen?
---
oh yes, cloaks, that null sec only mechanic. 
---
Guard duty can be done by alts so u just tab out when you hear gate flash or look at a second monitor or use newbros who cant fly supers and faction bs and give them a cut.
---
Definitely a well thought out argument
---
definitely something to try out for myself and look like a retard afterwards for when i somehow fuck it up
---
I'm an FC and a Squad leader, the only thing I do is go out looking for content, and the only content there is is cloaky bullshit and ganking people then running away. but at the end of the day you're not interested in arguing honestly you're just trolling for a response.
---
So, eliminate autopilot?
---
Nullsec is supposed to be scary and unknown. It's supposed to be hard. Small corps aren't supposed to hold Sov.
---
does not work how your imagining it.   typically the fight over before your friends can get on grid or the hunters warp off prior to help arriving.    What you suggest can work but it typically fights only occur on the hunters terms.
---
... and they might be people who show up for fights!   Without using casinos, a working 64 bit client, or tricks to make the server shit itself to get the edge in a fight.....
---
I think it's because CCP didn't want to make easy pve  that has good rewards because then it would be a massive isk sink. They're like lvl 1-2 missions, more for new players to earn a bit of isk without the need of high end ships or 20mil SP. So t1 sites are more for new players and learning what to expect from that kind of pve in higher tiers.
---
https://youtu.be/F6SMmoqqSlU?t=6 aaaaand its gone.
---
before the loki is the stratios.   
---
mobile depo in cargo for refits.  
---
ping between celestials and make a safe. drop depo there refit for your needs and off you go.  if your wanting combat make sure you refit outside of dscan range of your target. happy hunting.
---
What "adjustments" is he supposed to be making?
---
The cure for cancer isn't to tell people that are stupid for developing it in the first place and they just need to adapt. What grandiose solution do you have that would allow you to rat in a subcap in a high traffic area and still make sustainable profits?
---
I can see how unanchoring a structure might require some premeditation in terms of speed and timing, but isn’t stealing from hangars a pretty easy task, since asset safety exists? I ask because I’ve been reading up on some older accounts of Corp theft, and they all talk about arranging for freighters/DSTs, which seems kind of useless, given the existence of asset safety.
---
i brought the cheapest thing. who cares how he fits it, who are you the skip bayless of reddit? he doesnt care how you feel.
---
Not everyone has the alts for that.  and I didnt say it was a null sec only mechanic at all, you should read better.  
---
And im not going to submit a newbro to watching a gate all day getting bored out of their skull, that's just dumb.

Then get someone to show you how to find content ffs. You are clearly in need of some help. I don’t know what kind of “cloaky” groups you’ve been running into but I’m yet to find one.

Pretty good watch, 50 minutes long but ey, I thought it was pretty entertaining
---
u dont force anyone to do it. You ask nicely and give an incentive. If you can't get anyone to do it then oh well, maybe you have to rat in a VNI instead of a hel and make a bit less to risk less.

:pray:

Keep in mind he said contracting. They have to pay for insurance, extra taxes an employer usually pays, etc. 30% is a rough guideline for that stuff.

So why be friends? If PH shot your shit (or something you obviously wanted to protect), you still want to be friends? I mean... wtf?

This is me, I donate isk even with adblock cause the donations are ridiculously fair

&gt; By ignoring the problem and not vetting adequately they effectively are.

If they were ignoring it, every ad you saw would be malware.

---
https://imgur.com/a/izBY1Z5 try me bitch. 
---
&gt; ... when they hijack the page and redirect you
---
A good fix for this is either clicking the stop refresh button, closing the page, or just clicking the back button faster than you can apparently think.
---
&gt; you dont have to click ads for them to do nasty things anymore grandpa you need to get with the times.
---
So do you apparently? Its almost as if the eve userbase, in general, *has a brain and enough thinking capacity to avoid them doing nasty things*. As for elderly people, TEACH THEM. If some dumbass like me can watch copious amounts of porn and not get infected, so can they.
---
&gt; I do adblock
---
No, you USE adblock. 
---
&gt; I am the virus/malware cleanup crew.
---
Fucking lol, anyone who knows how to install antimalware services is "the cleanup crew. You are also not THE crew. You are one of millions.
---
&gt; I'm the person grandma and grandpa bring their computer to when it gets royally fucked by whatever nasty they came across.
---
My grandparents haven't taken their computer to any sort of specialist in decades thanks to my father and I. Half the time, your "cleanup" takes 5 minutes and you charge probably hundreds for something a 12 year old can do.
---
&gt; Everything from fake email attachments to fake coupon programs and yes to malicious adware infections caused by ads hijacking web pages and redirecting them.
---
Not sure what email attachments or coupon programs have to do with ads but okay. As for the hijacking, either pay the dude in virtual pennies or use adblock. I'd recommend you show your customers how to do it as well.

Copies your username and password and makes it available to Goonscum to steal your shit
---
I have no idea what you're trying to get at there you've genuinely lost me, can you elaborate?
---
yeah they are supposed to be hard to detect, hence the cloak  
---
but if you have scouts watching entry and checking new sigs then maybe it won't be so hard. maybe if you had a response fleet even just a few fast warping quick-lock ships you could force that scout off or even kill him when he trys to tackle something. so explain to me how im wrong or are you just buthurt that you cant keep making easy isk by your self in what was meant to be the most dangerous part of space in eve.   
---
if you and your corp is unwilling to change then you will be forced out as you should be.
---
Because everyone has the knowledge and the time to decompile the client
---
Capitals and umbrellas aren't the problem. The problem is the unrealistic expectations of the attacker. You believe it is your Bob-given right to come out isk positive when attacking targets in enemy territory. But you're going about it all wrong.
---
Do actual Intel work on the target region. Find the nerds who drop their faction supers like they are a meme. Use a blue spai alt to check when they are online and try to bait them out into the open. Then drop AN ACTUAL FUCKING DREADBOMB on top of it.
---
Stop asking CCP to win the game for you and come up with a tactic that isn't Take the Bidge-F1

I had conversations like this with ISK doublers. I have to admit though: They usually caught on a *lot* quicker.  
---
The things I did back then to pass the time between adjusting prices by 0.01 ISK....
---
im just a friendly bee who speaks his mind, moa is cheaper than vexor btw
---
I won't use my crap thorax heh
---
Re-adding suspect timers will drive the more expensive runners to more and more remote places, making them more difficult to hunt. As of right now, you can kill a 2bil sac with 2 suicide nados, or a 4-5bil Gila with 3-4 nados
---
Provi also has suffered a big hit
---
Are the moon ores such as sylvite worth mining, or is it better isk to just do the +15% yield arkonor/bistot/crokite?
---
Won’t happen. Ccp doesn’t acknowledge people live in wh. We are all just passing through. Jspace was never meant to have residents
---
I wouldn't paint these charts with just "botting"... it's obvious active players are not ratting as much due to the blackout. However, I feel pvp is up and that's a good thing... especially in null. PvE is at a decent place now where there's great risk in it if you chose so.
---
they dont have humor in the non existant bielefeld i know it i was there or wasnt i, i my memory's of that time are a bit blurred.
---
OP, I think you should figure out what you are asking us to tell you that you want... Then come back for a new post in 6 months and perhaps tell us what you think you want us to hear
---
at least you get warned about you being about to be destroyed by smartbombs
---
loki is better hands down. takes what 2-3 strats to kill a well fit loki. 
---
but in the meantime a low cost low sp starter ship would be the strat. or even the astero just to get a feel for what he wants to do.
---
If you can't figure out why it has had a nano...
---
Experimental fit. Point is to overheat and catch someone trying to kite you with scram, they obviously think it's either active or brick tanked and that it won't go as fast as it actually does.
---
We had a good laugh and enjoyed the relatively cheap welp.
---
When was the last time you had fun? You're free to join us..
---
If I’m trying to live out of ship, I think the issue with the Loki would be having to lug around ammo, which I think is the main benefit of the legion.
---
Then that begs the question of if it’s even viable to live out of a single ship.
---
Thank you!
---
a shit change that has a massive negative affect on most play styles? no way would people still be complaining!
---
Watching this makes me want to get ISK doublers on discord voice and see what I could do lol. It'd be like the reverse bonus room
---
Sadly the figurehead and paragons of major Eve powers are not known for their emotional stability. So likely, ya. Just a buttmad thing
---
CCP is literally run by a wormholer so strong doubts
---
Completed the survey there now! It's an interesting project and if you feel you need more data, I don't mind doing more surveys or responding to questions if I've the time :)
---
Aloha snackbar
---
Your saying that with the blackout you aren't getting content. I am legit confused how delve is not business as usual. Someone jumps on one of your rorq, you guys don't come in and fight. People drop on shit in delve pretty regularly according to zkill so how your not getting local content Idk.
---
As far as roaming sure it's pretty shit for you guys, but go roam horde space, they still deploy response fleets.
---
I feel solo pvp has increased. Many players who spent their solo time ratting are now turning to pvping... including me. I also do more group pvp and pve, which only benefits this game. Solo pvp is still very active and I haven't seen a blop yet. 
---
Try moving around to different regions.
---
It is not the comms you are angry at, it is the people. You have some problem you need to fix, or you know... just don't play a MMO game?
---
I’ve primarily lived in HiSec and I do interesting things with “actual people” all the time. Your answer sounds really judgey and bad faith.
---
Thank you so much 😊!! Sure thing!!
---
Seeing how a corp is leaving frat today and joining PH there is definitely more going on. But you can have your opinion ofcourse
---
both can be true.
---
Any hobby dev work does
---
Hey as a developer what type of back end are you running? Does cloudfare take care of load balancing and such? I've only had experience with aws.
---
I mean, the stats he gives are correct and easily verifiable. You can be a retard and that's cool, but go be a retard somewhere else you risk averse faggot
---
WH space is already at next level chaos. If you want to take it to the next level, NS should not have asset safety.
---
because instead of ccp fixing anything they just slap a band-aid on and fix none of the underlying problems with the game.  
---
the isk already almost wasn't worth living in null for sub caps now it for sure is not.
---
I would like to see Waffles take on their old allies to see who would win, but since everyone worth a damn in PL left to join Snuff or Waffles, it wouldn't be much of a show.
---
I really wanna like Waffles because they have gusto, but they are just so smug about clubbing seals. Either way, have fun space dudes.
---
They will add an local to wh space.
---
Wh space is seen as chaotic enough by ccp. Plus, they don't want to iterate on it as they are already years behind in iterating on other more widespread-use things.
---
Now that I think about it, they have made some chaos changes in spookyspace with the changes they have been doing with the drifter holes lately.
---
Can a moa field 5 medium drones?
---
Ask yourself why it's hurting your corp? The answer is that YOUR corp couldn't defend themselves, because many small corps are doing fine. You belong in high sec. Proper null sec corps are able to pve together and protect their space. If you're too small, merge your corp and stay in high sec. This is how Eve should have been. Null should not be viable to you until you are ready and prepared.
---
did the last like 10 comments not happen for you? I'm pretty sure I made it clear I don't do much in delve itself right? even so, personally I'm not interested in dropping supers and titans on gankers, it's not for me and theres no chance of getting a subcap response out before a cyno goes up and the supers come in.   
---
As for the go poke horde, you surely can see why I have an issue with only having like 2 reliable places to get any sort of response fleet right? things get stale, and post-blackout the types of content and opponent have slimmed a ton. reverting back to a previous comment of mine, they could have gotten so much more achieved by just focusing on making supercapitals a shit choice for countering subs rather than nerfing everyones play style but the ganker and small gangers.
---
Doom bunny best bunny
---
Origin logi was indeed the best. It made flying logi fun because we were always all on the ball and if someone couldn't tank they knew to warp if they could not just die
---
Rorqs have excavs and excavs can be bombed very easily in blackout.
---
Dude, wait, you're talking about that vid? Dude that's a crazy good vid. I always thought PH was a last ditch add on to the attackers. This all happened before my Eve career so I didn't know too much of the wormhole groups involved and their origins. I forgot about the entire thing almost. Thank you o7
---
He had too much wine, but he also was right.
---
Tangled up in Blue.
---
Haha, no probs mate o7
---
I sincerely don't understand what you mean.
---
Viable? Yes
---
Practical? Not really
---
You need to keep in mind that loot needs to be brought out of wormholes if you plan to sell it. If you keep everything in one ship, you'll run out of room quicker - that's not to mention the chance of losing everything from a single drop going wrong.
---
I'd recommend at the very least getting an alt that can fly something like an Orca and using that as a mobile base for storage.
---
"New player"
---
"Solo"
---
Sorry that is way more ISK than I have. LOL
---
People who did nothing but farm the same thing for years straight in the "theoretically most dangerous" spaces in Eve.
---
  
---
Were they actually ever engaged to begin with?
---
Nothing's stopping them from playing the game.  The game itself.. has not changed.  There was no ship nerf or buff.  There "class" hasn't died.
---
They run the risk of getting "jumped".  The anxiety alone made them quit.
---
That's a problem with the core of the game.  Bringing local back does not make it better.  It returns the game into the same stagnant place it was for a decade.  You will never get someone who does not want to fight, to go out and fight.  They don't have the time, resources, etc.  They all want to farm in the highest paid area's because.. well that's how they like to play the game.
---
The bar of entry was made worse.  Instead of playing the game and adapting, they quit.
---
.... they were just a warm body.  They did nothing to contribute to the community.  They farmed.  That's it.
---
You can nomad with one account in a legion but you will be limited in what you can store as you will be taking up a lot of space with refits.
---
Having an orca alt is the way to go.
---
WH space is ridiculously safe for groups who don’t go too big.  
---
If you have people constantly controlling holes you are invincible.  
---
Grr null will only go so far before more people realize this
---
I have done hunting for many month for my corp, we used to play with blackops and deploy deep in enemy space, I can told you, the only time we faced humans whil "camping" branch and some chunk of drone land was against Siberian squad in the z-k pocket
---
This is actual bs. Super ratting is the least safe.
---
1. Nerf to NSA - huge
---
2. Local gone
---
Why risk a ship? Ratting is no longer worth it in any ship.
---
Where do you think hilmar lives and why do you think he advocates changes that absurdly benefit wormhole playstyle?
---
I think a better option would be to limit what tier of abysmal you can run based on sec status. I don't know where the sweet middle ground would be, but like if T5s could only be ran in low sec or lower, and T4s could only be run in .5 and .6 space. Would accomplish your goal of giving high tier abyssal a window of vulnerability while not just making them lambs to the slaughter. You actually force them into specific demographs that you can then systematically hunt.
---
Thanks for all the Fish (I didn't expect anything else but I hoped for better!)
---
This.  I mean come what is the average amount of time you play eve a day.    
---
{DERP MODE} Oh YES I Play 12+ hours a day 7 days a week.
---
To become a Nomad, you have to be a Fenrir and get T2 surgery applied.
---
so thats what you call dynamic game play is it ? you push a player out of his playing style cause you dont want him to have some peaceful time while having a beer or having  to put his baby to sleep or taking wife agro . Pls can shut the fuck up ? like really stop trying to force your ideas to others if he wanted to play in whs he wud have .
---
fine i love you haha, vexor was free and moa is fun.
---
haha i wouldnt expect nithing but the best from you glonn
---
YES!!! The blog is back.  My Ishkurs are today, and will always be named "Sexy Times" after Feyd's blog.
---
As a cloaky bullshit pilot myself I am more than open to reducing the power of our cloaky bullshit ships in exchange for content destroying fax/titans/supers being nerfed to hell as far as their ability to defend space from roaming subcaps.
---
To a point, but it’s not quite that cut and dry. More runners means more people buying filaments. And also a significant bit of your money is in databases you sell to NPCs. 
---
It’ll drop but probably not that much
---
smell the salt on your sea full of it....
---
So move into wormholes then. Make tons of isk and be "invincible", what could go wrong?
---
Yeah uh what?
---
This was last year, right?
---
IT'S FOR A WEBSITE HONEY!
---
NEXT!
---
Maybe find a Corp with people you like?
---
Any corp that is involuntarily wardeced these days is bad and you should join a better one.
---
.... People do.  People don’t move into wormholes because why’re worthless and unplayable.
---
Shocking logic i know
---
Doesn't take me putting my hand in the fire to know that its hot!
---
Hard to detect, not impossible...
---
And I have already explained why you are wrong above, im not going over it again, thats on you.  It can be dangerous and still allow reward, currently with subcaps its reward thats not worth it and thats bad.  It will force out people trying to be there that do deserve to be there from bad mechanics and only bad mechanics.
---
Cool....or you are?? Waiting to blow my Starter ship up with its 65K Isk onboard?? haha
---
If your doing 95 while on 95, why even use that highway?
---
My entire stance on this whole blackout thing from the start has been essentially bring back local and "delete" supercaps.   
---
cloaky bullshit was balanced via local and acceptable now its OP to the point of it being pretty much the only guaranteed way of getting your ganks off and pretty much the meta currently.
---
&gt;and they are immune to other players.
---
What is stopping anyone from ganking them currently?
---
I feel you're saying that you want local back, because frankly, we can't do what you did in the past without it. You also clearly want to eliminate cynos and pretty much anything that can jump. I'm reading between the lines here.
---
Nice!
---
Having a pi holes doesn't make you a wormholer
---
And no one will want to do it because its awful to sit on a gate doing nothing (it would be forcing because who the fuck wants to do that?).  Actually a Hel is far safer than a VNI atm which is kindof the problem...
---
Best posted advice ever!  Well done good Sir.
---
Rude..Blocked!
---
Susika's Modified Boson Bookmark II
---
20-40 is an irrelevant number which you don't see because of fax. Fax require 100+ subcaps to break therefore eliminating the entire 20-40man style of gameplay.
---
Great, the more the merrier.
---
I used this only days ago to copy my new binds and overview, worked fantastically!
---
Also, it would make zero sense for CONCORD to make you a suspect when you're killing the guys who are invading CONCORD's space. Obviously not focused on balance, but it would probably be some pretty terrible reasoning for having a suspect timer.
---
I'm just memeing m8
---
Passed 1t last year.. .....
---
Prefer them without the suspect timer tbh. There's very little challenging solo content available in high.   
---
4/5's are hard enough that people end up dying without getting ganked. With the timer back in, people will just stick to 3's and probably end up loosing less ships.
---
Take my downvote.
---
Few weeks ago I woulda agreed. Now theres Tribute and western Vale happening.
---
Wormholes are literally safer than null
---
well no, pre blackout you could bait people who were outside of cap umbrella ranges, who got lulled into a false sense of security via the local, where their only response was going to be subcaps and if a cap came it had generally midded or gated quite a bit first giving plenty of time to engage the subcaps first.   
---
As a side note the Fax requiring 100+ subcaps isnt strictly true especially with the Triglavian ships being a thing now, also not to mention I've lost count of how many times we killed faxes and caps with about 40 assfrigs, yeah its not the fastest of tasks but it was doable. although I do agree Faxes are still kind of OP and I strongly believe they at the very least shouldn't be able to rep subcaps
---
Obviously I cannot make an educated guess as to any unseen motives behind the going-ons of Horde high command. I can only make assumptions based on presented facts. That's the trouble with ultimate understanding, you cannot know if you know everything there is to know because you are not omniscient.
---
That being said, if you have information about the backroom dealings of PH please do share. It's not like it won't be known by all the other major players anyway, and this is a forum for communication. Otherwise, I'd assume that a Corp leaving FRT for PH is just another example of FRTs failing headless leadership as the rats flee a sinking ship. As a prior rat, I can relate.
---
Sounds like you are looking for "content" in your own space. Its a lot easier when you go to enemy space but that might incur something known as "risk" which you are clearly adverse to being in 70k blue group.

---
Don’t know about your hole, but ours has very active the last 48 hours, we had a null, low, and Thera holes open up almost the same time.
---
We had a Wingspan representative apologize for not being able to make a delivery and send us a formal letter assuring us that they would try again, after we bombed their scout away.
---
Good stuff, I, a disciple of Bob, have warned the members of my corp to not take too much joy in null’s suffering, we too are to be tested and deserve no more mercy than anyone eles
---
。゜゜(´Ｏ`) ゜゜。
---
sounds like you are looking "up your own ass" to come to that conclusion but it's when we get to this point in the comments it becomes clear that you aren't interested in the merits of my argument and don't want to debate me seriously and the grr gons starts to seep out
---
&gt;https://imgur.com/a/izBY1Z5 try me bitch.
---
&gt;A good fix for this is either clicking the stop refresh button, closing the page, or just clicking the back button faster than you can apparently think.
---
You completely missed what i was saying. Or are disingenuously ignoring it. Not everyone has a computer slow enough to stop the page when you realize it's being redirected. You know that redirecting doesn't actually take 10s like you've been led to believe it only takes a second. Redirects from legitimate sources take 10-15 seconds to avoid ddosing themselves by redirecting traffic across their site. 
---
&gt;So do you apparently? Its almost as if the eve userbase, in general, has a brain and enough thinking capacity to avoid them doing nasty things. As for elderly people, TEACH THEM. If some dumbass like me can watch copious amounts of porn and not get infected, so can they.
---
You can bring a horse to water but you cannot make them drink. I can explain how to avoid getting infected 100 different ways but if they just shut down and "uhh huh" their way through my talk i can't really help them.
---
&gt;No, you USE adblock.
---
Now you are being pedantic.
---
&gt;Fucking lol, anyone who knows how to install antimalware services is "the cleanup crew". You are also not THE crew. You are one of millions.
---
This is so ignorant it's hilarious. It's like thinking that cloaky campers aren't there just because you can't see them in local.
---
&gt;My grandparents haven't taken their computer to any sort of specialist in decades thanks to my father and I. Half the time, your "cleanup" takes 5 minutes and you charge probably hundreds for something a 12 year old can do.
---
Yes, they can. But they don't. And the other half of the time it doesn't take 5 minutes. And not everyone wants a level formatting of the computer requiring delicate cleanup of the OS installation. **But go ahead, download tools that promise to fix your computer, that's totally not one of the prime ways you contract such an infection.**
---
&gt;Not sure what email attachments or coupon programs have to do with ads but okay.
---
They are malware infection vectors do try and keep up with what i was talking about.
---
&gt;As for the hijacking, either pay the dude in virtual pennies or use adblock. I'd recommend you show your customers how to do it as well.
---
I do ***USE*** adblock and try my level best to teach others how to as well. Despite the fact that it harms my bottom line to do so.
---
Is he going to pay the costs to repair the computers damaged by the malware he distributes? Then shut the fuck up.
---
classy

I'll leave that here, in case you have the isk to do that https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cfufju/solo_nomad_carrier_pixel_art/
---
\-Nomadically living is fun as you can find loads of content. If there isn't anyone to pvp for you, the run sites until someone finds you or you finish the site.  
---
\-T3Cs and the Stratios are your best options. If you know how to clear most C1-C2 sites with a T3D then you can do that too, but it can be pretty tough sometimes when trying to clear them in a T3D
---
\-Mobile Depot in your ships cargo, modules to refit if need be
---
\-If you're looking at a Semi-Nomadic lifestyle then bring a few giant secure containers, anchor them in system at safe spots made by despawned anomalies/signatures for best "safety." Someone determined enough can still get them, but by using despawned anomalies/signatures they'll have to at least wait a few days if not weeks to get to your cans, and by then you should be moved on or have them set up in a new location.
---
\-If you have access to 2-3 omega accounts, then use an orca to hold a ratting ship, gas huffer, and multiple pvp ships and stick to C2-C6 nomadic living
---
\-C13 nomadic living is best with an alt in a porpoise for hauling and secure containers in the system to be picked up by your porp pilot. T3D is best if you wanna rat, run data/relic, and pvp in C13. If you only wanna  run explo and pvp, then a blaster fit pacifier is best as you can cloak
---
"Sarcasm" "Woosh"
---
Always love new stuff to listen to on the way home
---
I don't believe you.
---
Umm, you can review the source code. You should do that before you sound like an idiot!
---
Ah, true true.
---
&gt;you might as well add a button that immediately blows up any ship someone has locked
---
Isn't that just a DD
---
I wasn't entirely sure if it was just me luck or not, but since the announcement I've seen an average of like 5-6 connections at a time instead of the usual 2-3. Very small sample size and anecdotal, could easily be confirmation bias, but glad it's not just me
---
Downvoted so CCP doesn't see. You monster.
---
No cynos are fine, just I think there can be some balancing done. As far as local what we did would work without local 90% as good. So I am not sure where you think I am implying we get local back. Cynos yeah you can get that from my post and from my post history I am long time advocate of cyno rebalance and I am pretty anti super proliferation etc. I do think that the power of blops fleets need a serious look at as well. Nerfing cloak t3s was a start and nerfing ecm was cool but other things without cloaky blops cyno fleets needs serious rebalance.
---
He didn’t distribute shit you mother fucking moron, and holds precisely 0 liability as it’s through googles ad platform. That’s on google, not him.
---
Learning to rat with a VNI nerf and no local. 
---
&gt; What grandiose solution do you have that would allow you to rat in a subcap **in a high traffic area** and still make sustainable profits?
---
Oh look, your first adjustment! You're half way there.
---
Must be a wh thing, i too drive a black charger (07, the best fucking body style they had) and live in a wormhole, and used to live in Bmore.
---
You think eve players experience shame?
---
Consider what you lost payment for some valuable lessons in EVE.   
---
\- first I would see if your corp is willing to help you out with a starter ship to help you get back on your feet. If they are not then maybe its not a good corp to be in if they don't provide basic services like that. My corp gives people ratting and mining ships to help them get their feet under them. 
---
\- If you end up leaving your corp I would sit down and ask yourself what it is you want to do in EVE. Does not have to be permanent, but just think about what you want to do in the game for the next few months or so. Then look to join a corporation that focuses on that and offers support to new players to help them get started.   
---
\- examples are 
---
\- Faction Warfare   
---
\- Industrial Corp  
---
\- Low Sec Pirates   
---
\- Null Block Alliance  
---
\- Worm Hole Corp  
---
\- Exploration Corp   
---
\- etc,   
---
If you are thinking about joining Null Sec and making serious money feel free to message me, my corp is recruiting.
---
I think your first mistake was joining a corp. All new players should definitely wait until at least 5mil skillpoints. That's my humble opinion. I would drop the corp and focus on getting yourself a nice fat wallet and a stable footing. people who say you should join a corp early, are dead wrong.

Maybe get goons to unblue test so that you have more space to roam? It's no ones fault but goons that only a few regions can fight you.
---
if u tell them they're getting 20mil per hour they do it they probs would depending on their own money making skills.
---
Hel is safer if you're under a supercap umbrella that can cyno support in at a moments notice yes.
---
It can be taxing. Takes a while to learn
---
I didn't play EVE ten years ago, but I did 5 years ago.
---
Back then JumpFreighter (Services), cynos, etc were already a thing, but there was always the chance of getting dropped by PL, BL., crazy Lowsec Russians etc and there was no supercap umbrella.
---
We spent our time on corp comms, nerdtalked about fittings, stuff etc. and waited for alliance pings to join fleets, while farming our Titans/Supers and put our alts in them. 
---
Sometimes we baited that cloaky guy next door when we had eyes on all relevant stagings in cynorange and knew that BL./PL didn't have 50 dudes waiting in lowsec.
---
Nowadays carebears turned into supercrybabies who cant deal with hitting Dscan, being on comms and need a super/rorqual to somehow be relevant in space, because they are too stupid to use sub caps.
---
Man theres some really shitty advice in here.
---
Default your hot key for Dscan is V
---
Set scan to 5 degrees, open your probe scanner so  you can see anomalies, hold V, click an anom.  You will auto scan that anom at 5 degrees without your camera moving at all, you can just hold V and go down the list clicking each anom about once every 4 or 5 seconds.
---
Go forth and murder the world.
---
Test aren't blue to Goons and I have been able to shoot them the entire time I've been in Goons, still doesnt solve the problem of there being literally only 3 regions to get content, Delve,Esoteria,TKE wooo such content
---
cool even more inconsistency
---
Hey squizz, have you signed up for Brave rewards yet? If not, please do. I'll set you on my auto contribute list. And I dont doubt there may be others like me who have started using the brave browser for everything, could be a good side source of extra income. Just my 2 cts!
---
&gt; Never take a vacation again!
---
Just try and stop me!

Honestly I would wait sometimes to get tackled so I can have some engaging PVP content. However, like I mentioned in another comment the VNI ratting days are over. I think CCP should of done the VNI changes sooner. It was too easy to farm isk while practically AFK. However, it also killed a lot of activity when it comes to ratting.
---
It just takes one developer to make a public bot and now everyone has it.
---
Only the rifter frigate skins sorry.
---
I have Hugin, Rapier, Rupture, Scythe, Stabber, Maelstrom and Naglfar as well.
---
Sorry about the frigs, I would love to have em myself.
---
You read everything he wrote and still put dumb shit like this in print.
---
Dave is quitting EVE, he's already decided he just cant nut up and finish the job, so you're literally wasting your time trying to make any real sense to him.
---
This is pretty much the only playstyle I've done. Right now I'm running a roaming Nestor doing relic/data, combat anoms while PvP fit in wormholes.
---
It's incredibly dumb and will be a big feed, but it's fun. In terms of ships you should be looking at Astero&gt;Stratios&gt;Legion (haters will say Loki, but muh bonused neuts). All three of those are totally capable of solo nomad'ing, with the cruisers being able to reliably kill ratting battleships. I'd recommend a Stratios to start with because you can get them effective for cheaper, they're a bit less skill intensive to fly than say a dual rep legion.
---
Dave you are actually an antisocial cocksucker, thanks for putting it in print though.
---
First, Eve Online has a steep learning curve. Learn to be comfortable with loss. 
---
Second, you’re playing Eve Online like it’s World of Warcraft. 
---
You’re grinding missions so that you can eventually purchase a more expensive ship to run higher level missions so that you can purchase an even more expensive ship to run even higher level missions. 
---
Best piece of advice I can give you:
---
Stop running missions immediately. In my opinion, missions are boring and won’t teach you much aside from very basic PvE mechanics. Even if you really like PvE content, there’s much better PvE content than high sec mission grinding. A couple of examples: wormhole space | exploration
---
Third, I genuinely believe that if you want to give Eve Online a fair shake you should have an active Omega account. It allows access to substantially more content and you’ll be able to diversify in the game much faster. 
---
Fourth, and probably my most direct instruction, get with a new player friendly group that has their head screwed on straight. 
---
Recommendation:
---
Google search Eve University and try signing up to be part of their corporation. 
---
Lastly, a list of things you can try to accomplish if you’re lost without missions. The list will be hard and you will get stuck. When you do, use google or YouTube to find answers. But you will learn a lot about the game along the way.
---
Use your directional scanner to find a celestial object at 5% scan radius - use planet 3 as your first target as it should be simple. If I play Eve Online for an hour I will probably use dscan 200 times. Both for hunting players in PvP and for protecting myself when I’m trying to PvE/PvP. Get good with it.
---
Find a t1 frigate blueprint copy in the contracts, purchase it, and manufacture the frigate. Mine the ores and process them into minerals. If you can’t find a specific ore/mineral buy what you need from a trade hub. I don’t think you can do this on an Alpha account. 
---
Use a set of core scanner probes to scan a few sites.
---
Wormhole - show info and see what you can learn about its description via google. Go into the wormhole and look at the system name. See what you can learn about the specific wormhole based on the J name. Try to do something in the wormhole to turn a profit. You will almost defiantly die but you’ll see a different part of the game. Be preparers to lose. 
---
Combat site - when you’ve scanned the combat site down grab a PvE ship and run it. Google the name of the site so you know what you can expect. Sometimes you’ll make decent money doing these.
---
Data/Relic site- find the site and try to hack it. Make some money and learn about exploration along the way. Do this until you find a filament 
---
Put up a buy order for a low price and then sell the item back for a higher price while in a trade hub. Notice how competitive the market is to buy and sell things. Use a 5mn afterburner II as your example module to flip. 
---
Use the filament to run a Triglav site. Google it when you find the piece of filament and see if you can run the combat site. 
---
Kill an enemy player. This will be very difficult on your own. Try getting with a group like bombers bar or spectre fleet for an evening. They are fleets open to the public and generally result in a lot of action. 
---
Hope this helps!! Good luck!
---
I dont think so, even getting paid that much per hour still sounds like pain.  Even getting paid 100 mil an hour sounds like pain for guard duty.  Not what people want to do with their time.  
---
You're right a Hel is safer with an umbrella only, but I dont often see them outside of that ratting.  (yes there are a few herpderps out there and on zkill.)
---
If you do the speed limit in MD you are more likely to get hit from behind
---
&gt; immune to other players
---
Holy shit I didn't know there we abyssal fits that used cloaking devices, tell me more.
---
Blackout birthed many activities in null. For now I am too busy having fun in eve.
---
Whenever there is a change in EVE, some will like it and some will not. That's the cycle..... adapt and have fun
---
if you're getting alphaed at falcon jam range having one more guy shooting you wouldn't make a difference, you would die before or after the nerf
---
&gt; because like all super cap umbrellas, they just drop super caps because why wouldn't you
---
because you want a medium sized engagement instead, thats literally what you're crying about?
---
you're quite literally sitting here saying you can't get a medium sized fight and then admitting its your own fault you can't.
---
this is simple, the next time a crab gets tackled, don't jump in supers, bridge in a fleet, you have literally 7 minutes to form it up while the guy is in panic, meaning you can get some, but not ALL of your coalition in fleet.
---
meaning you'll have an actual fun fight.
---
stop punching yourself in the dick then crying about how much it hurts.
---
Point taken. What's up grath, been a while how's life been?
---
Yeah, did I see you at the wh only party at eve Vegas last year? Hmm, Mebbe this year?
---
&gt; I'm an FC and a Squad leader, the only thing I do is go out looking for content, and the only content there is is cloaky bullshit and ganking people then running away
---
100% false, you whiney little bitch
---
Good to see you're still retarded, if you've managed to see that I'm talking about mid sized fleets you'd have seen I was talking about places outside of umbrellas. but carry on being  grath i suppose
---
This guy gets it
---
agree i think horde is now the main alliance in panfam.
---
If you want real chaos
---
Put a gate to stain in some wormholes
---
no problem; here you go:
---
&gt; Do you have like a hundred characters you wish all had the same overview/chat window layout / market quickbar / autojoin channel settings but then there's also awkwardly like two characters you'd like to not fuck with? 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Did you once autistically set that up for all hundred of your characters on all four of your computers that have slightly different resolutions but then the new chat system broke everything including your will to live?

&gt; Do you dread logging into characters and setting that all up again?

Either the stories you are reading are older, back when there were invincible stations players lived out of and asset safety didn’t exist, or they were just trying to avoid paying billions in asset safety tax and then trying to extract the stuff from a lowsec station that is probably camped.
---
To avoid war targets, you use a character that isn't subject to them. For example you've got 3 character slots on your account, right? Make another character who just hauls stuff for you that doesn't join any corp. 
---
Also: **Fuck wardec warriors**
---
looks like gobbins just had a bad day last week
---
"A pirate does not grind PVE, or industry, or markets for his isk."
---
eat a dick ninny
---
Go back, read your history. Ccp really were surprised when folks started living there. 
---
Yeah absurdly benefit wh? Like when they shit up the Higgs rig ? That made wh life sooooo much easier.
---
Completely wrong. Man the fuck up, go get some Nados, and go criminal. All this sounds like is wanting an easy risk-free gank.
---
Because that's what you want to believe that's not fact, that's fucking fiction.
---
Interesting read, thanks for the link.
---
I do struggle with the Blackout.
---
You're *adorable*.
---
i mean thats just with one ratter per system, if u got like 3 supers doing anoms in that system then suddenly its 60mil.
---
Like use your initiative, the previous status quo of security bots watching local was utter cancer and has been for years
---
You can NOT use your umbrealla fuck tard, or, you can do what we do and regularly get 40 an 50 man (midsized) engagements if you just try for it without calling a 100 man fleet mid sized.
---
You dug your own hole, the rest of us are doing literally just fine finding fights
---
WoW has had bot detection for years, are you suggesting theres no bots in WoW?
---
that has pretty much always been the case tho? for you to win against damps in a jamming ship before the changes it was necessary to lock it first and keep it perma jammed thru the entire fight, cause the second he's able to lock you you're shut down. Damps always were way better than jams in pretty much everything except spread logi/drones/fighters. Fighters being able to ignore jams however, now that's ridiculous.
---
Amazing, every word you said is true.
---
Just to clarify, our offers are 100% serious and each bookmark is carefully hand picked from a selected group of honest and hard-working chinese/russian anomaly runners filled with care and love.
---
No, I don't travel to the USA.
---
See I dont want you to shut up, I love watching you constantly cry and bitch because you're a content creator who suddenly can't create content, meanwhile everybody else seems to be managing just fine
---
I wish this was not so true.
---
I hope we are in for a ride...
---
Did you review it?
---
Clearly flairbaiting.
---
Rage is all I have since I can't overheat my mining lasers.
---
It sounds like CCP is going to be adding more Drifter content into wormholes, perhaps we'll even see Drifter fleets bashing structures out here.
---
I, for one, welcome such changes. EVE should be hard.
---
I'm *here for it.* Give all holes 10 connections, fuck bear holes and c1 rorqs.
---
Ohhh... My envious capsulers heart... ò.ó
---
Take the site down. That would be nice. Would make the game better
---
&gt;changes that absurdly benefit wormhole playstyle
---
\[Citation Needed\]
---
It is so adictive that I left the d out. I am always high while playing eve online.
---
hurr hurr goon cant think super proliferation bad or that subcaps are where the fun is hur hur
---
I’d say you are lucky you weren’t rammed. They tend to do that.
---
yes, that's how you hunt blops that aren't complete retards
---
No guys literally I mean just scan down wormholes. Open back-doors to 0.0 and burn it down.
---
You can always spot someone who has never lived in a wormhole.
---
I somewhat disagree. There's still more that can be done with wormholes. Drifters should be harder to deal with and should actually resist your occupation of their territories. DRBs shouldn't just orbit one spot on a citadel grid, they should be nullified and actually actively bash structures.
---
I should have clarified, wh style of pvp and hunting.
---
Namely blackout nullification and t3cs existing for covops to be stronger
---
Don't listen to these kinds of asshats. In eve the amount of grinding is up to you because there is no "endgame" as its a sandbox. The fun in the game is made by you and if he thinks its to grindy its because he chooses to grind all day.
---
Hah yeah, solo mining lol, imagine people doing what they want in the sandbox instead of only doing whatever Astriania deems permissible.
---
Say it enough times and eventually it'll become true, right? That's your strategy here?
---
While you are not wrong with the part about distinguishing actions. I disagree that the bots were even an issue. CCP can tell if an account is being used organically or by an inorganic. The technology is there.
---
I’m sure everyone moved to wormholes because they suck soooo much and people hate living there and there’s no benefits whatsoever right?
---
the chinese are botters, more news at 11.
---
Madlad figured out how to fit a t3 cruiser in abyssal space
---
None of these are designed or intended to "absurdly benefit wormhole playstyles", that's just a side effect of wormholers adapting to the new meta.
---
12km from the gate but regionals have a larger sig so the *relative* distance between two ships is bigger, even if ships are individually at 12km from the gate
---
source: i sometimes web my freighters
---
&gt; Except nobody wants to do guard duty in a video game
---
Scouting and picketing is pretty common in fleets, so you're wrong about that too. J-spacers put 'eyes' on connections all the time.
---
&gt; Not to mention even if you do have a guard group you are likely still to be interrupted as they cant see the enemy coming
---
Unless someone's bothering to logoff trap you, you will be able to see them jumping in. And no-one's going to logoff trap 3 guys in myrms.
---
all wh's will have a static stain hole
---
To much awesomeness?  (I’m sure you can fill in the rest with “We are number 1”, “Greatest country on earth”, etc memes)
---
No... it’s an effect of the ceo being a wormholer and thinking of ideas that would be fun from his own playstyle and nothing else
---
What
---
Love Feyd and his Ishkurs. 😀
---
No and neither did you. If you had and found what you claim, you would have posted proof.
---
For about 48 hours. Then, the chat room gets moved out of client. It's certainly easier to do it in-game, sure, but don't pretend like it's required. 
---
Still, I expect CCP to do this next, because they sure as heck aren't showing more foresight lately than the average poster in this dumpster fire.
---
The null alliances have newbie friendly corps with free ships. Horde, Karmafleet, and BN all have programs to get you going. You can loot billions from PVP wrecks to get you started.
---
I've lived in wormholes almost my entire eve career. I've made at least 50bil running c5 sites. Ive never lost a single tinker or Nestor. Ive been rolled into while running big since I know what I'm foing I press 4 buttons and I'm safe on both toons. Atm wormhole space is the safest and most efficient space yo live in and there is only a few reasons to live in null. But what do I know I'm just ya average reddit shitposter.
---
Personally I don't understand this. When I'm playing a video game I want to be 100% engaged. If I want to do other shit, I'm going to do other shit.
---
I've never felt like I want to play a video game and do another thing at the same time.
---
Some do, but these are just my personal rules to live by. 😀
---
Again, none of those changes were designed to benefit wormholers.
---
LUL
---
&gt;It's like ccp is punishing folks like me for not being in some huge umbrella protected bloc.
---
That's exactly what they are doing, they are just dumb enough to not realize it and instead think they are doing you a favor.
---
We did... we are doing just fine.
---
if you and your corp are not willing to adapt the way you play then no, you don't deserve to be there.   
---
back to highsec with you carebear or unsub. you won't be missed.
---
Nah blackout is still a good thing, like less "free intel" (hope they remove structures/entos alert btw)  
---
but if they keep the blackout they have to increase the reward in nullsec, make them like a wormhole high reward/high risk but limited, there more explosion in null sec more isk aren't gonna hurt, and if they remove asset safety that certainly not gonna be a problem if they increase the reward in a drastic manner  
---
but they have to prevent umbrella farm before that, ressource depletion just like Hilmar said (if bounties are affected) or a "cyno shutdown module" like olmeca gold suggest can help'
---
question: what would happen if ccp really puts the hammer on the big blocks down to the number of active humans playing this game?
---
are we not past the point where we found out every nerf for nullsec always punish the small alliances while the big can outright ignore it or just adapt cause of the ressources they have? Are we not past the time small groups actually matter in nullsec cause of changes CCP made shortsighted?
---
To be fair, leaving aside the intel impact of no local, you can still AFK rat in a Myrmidon. That being said, it's still a good idea to tousle the shape of things, especially when a single ship is so completely dominating the activity in question. 
---
Woe be to the poor suckers who think nerfing a ship curtails botting somehow, though. Not that you said this, of course, but it's a related point.
---
maybe go lolsec and become a pvper ??? idk
---
&gt; WH space is ridiculously safe for groups who don’t go too big. 
---
&gt; If you have people constantly controlling holes you are invincible. 
---
just have a rolling team single passing 23/7 on your hole retard
---
Linkin Park is where they drop all the podded victims. Steer clear.
---
the jeff and grath tank is real
---
&gt; I'm an FC and a Squad leader
---
I've seen you say this multiple times as some sort of qualifier for your viewpoint.
---
Counterpoint
---
I'm an Alliance Level Strategic FC, Logi Captain, AT Teammember, and Alliance Master-of-Arms and I find great small gang content, blops content and medium gang fights every week, almost daily depending on if I want to roam.
---
Maybe you just need more training?
---
Thank you for your Excellent Content. I straight up yelled "GIT 'EM" at my screen for this one.
---
I agree a long overdue balance is needed to caps, cynos, blops, and even cloaks. But as much as I love the blackout, I don't think the answer is more alts on gates and everyone on comms.  It will obviously help and benefit the alliances in the region, but it shouldn't have to take another account and 3rd party comms to feel somewhat safe again. There are a lot of solo players, and alphas can't cloak. This would mean that a single person would have to have multiple omega accounts, a decent computer with two monitors to run, they would have to be on voice comms, with a mic, and sit in a standing fleet. The blackout has fixed botting, but it's hurting the solo pver. I think its good and the risk is now there for the rewards they were getting. It's far more balanced than it used to be. 
---
But, I wonder now is the reward is better suited for the pvper? They do tend to have the advantage here... even in hostile territory. With dotlan giving away ratting systems, pvpers can pinpoint exactly where to go with minmal risk of being discovered. As you said, gate alts and comms helps, but I also believe CCP is looking at a sov array that controls local somewhat. I think the eventual end to all this is a local that hides alliance and allies, and has a delayed timer for anyone else in the system. This gives roaming fleets a set time to scan and track down targets before they appear on local. 
---
Or, another solution could be a constellation local... or even a regional local. Seeing what's there, but not knowing where.
---
Fair play, sometimes people say stuff as dumb as that so I missed it
---
you're glazing over an important detail.
---
the only reason that bait drake actually \*worked\* was because dps numbers were lower overall, the roaming gangs were smaller, and the drake could tank like a motherf\*\*ker.
---
tldr; you had \*time\* to respond. 
---
that \*time\* doesn't exist anymore with an interdiction nullified cloaky 100MN HAM Loki that can decloak within scram/web range and wipe your ratting subcap off the map before anyone has a chance to say a word on comms other than 'tackled'
---
Cool.
---
Sure? lol =)
---
My computer isn't slow enough to stop it from redirecting, nor is my internet connection. I have gotten redirected many times. Not hard to get around though.
---
Anyways, I'm gonna be honest I can't be fucked to read the rest of this. Good talk fam, hope I murder your ships in game :p
---
Alright to clarify, I've run all sorts of shit in almost every region and got mountains on content pre blackout. Theres a huge decrease on what there was before. Its now obnoxiously difficult to have fun in this game because everything is weighted to either extreme of super cap defence or risk averse ganking. The other stuff whilst there in some regard is now far far far harder to make happen than its even worth. Rather than placating small gangers who are a minority at the expense of majority why doesnt ccp focus on changes that can be positive rather than their age old method of nerfing everything to the ground.
---
Carebear postings are so adorable sometimes....
---
No proof doesn't mean it doesn't exist. My point is no one checks that shit, and 99.9% of people who have the code wouldn't know what to look for. So, you're trusting the people who wrote it, and basically the handful of people who "claim' to approve it, who could just be alts of the same person who wrote it. 
---
Thus... tread lightly my friend. You've been warned.
---
1. Scan down wormholes for content/strat ops
---
2. Combat scan enemy fleet.
---
3. Combat scan abyssal runners/ mission runners and gank them.
---
4. Provide cloaky eyes/pings for your fleet.
---
Fuck, what a great read!! Thanks for the updated guide. I was looking for some new activities!
---
Were they coming back from Eve Northeast? Ment a bunch of you guys
---
They are making money on those subs, they will let a certain percentage through. And why not, its revenue and increases player counts. When RMT gets a little out of hand they will do a little trimming. 
---
The problem isn't that we know that there are tons of people trying to bot every game out there to cheat or rmt. It what the Devs are willing to do, and in this case Im arguing that CCP allowed this to happen or even wanted it, maybe to look better for when they sold to pearl abyss. And now, why the huge push on botting? New owners want more microtransactions and less RMT, sales must go up! So reduce income across the board and blame it on botting. Most people can't make a living, so staying in the game means subbing and buying plex to stay afloat.
---
Who needs facts when you have infallible intuition?
---
You seem out of ideas in the moment, but not butthurt about the losses you've suffered... that is the right way of approaching eve. 
---
When I was a fresh newbro I flew highsec escalations in Gurista (in Lonetrek) and then Angel Space (around Hek).
---
I first had a Moa capable of doing DED 4 escalations which required alot of patience and resulted in a couple of buttclenching moments. 
---
When my skills were good enough I switched into a Gila and was able to look for DED 4 or DED 5 sites. 
---
With this method you are flying around from system to system and are keeping an eye on your probescanner. 
---
As soon as you see certain sites (identified by their names) you fly there and clear them. Each cleared site has a chance of escalating.
---
If a site escalates you will get a popup window and the location for the new escalation will be visible in your agency.
---
Within escalations you have to kill certain enemies or structures which CAN drop very lucrative faction modules. Sometimes the loot sucks, but thats just a RNG thing. 
---
Let's just say that you can make your first billions easily on that way if you are dedicated.
---
If you are able to multitask you can also fit a scanning module on your Gila later on and scan Unidentified Signatures while killing NPCs with your drones in sites. Every now and then you find some useful combat sites by scanning those signatures. I recommend doing most of the drone sites, since their loot can be quite rewarding for just a couple of minutes of work.
---
I would suggest that you do not do this on a wardecced character/corp. 
---
Also look up which sites can escalate and what escalations do drop decent stuff. If you are scanning for combat sites google what kind of loot can drop there. A couple if sites which are scanable are not worth the time.
---
I am on my phone right now. If you are interested HMU and I will try to provide you with more information on site names and fittings.
---
So provi will loose its identity...as someone who lived there for 2 years that hurts.
---
How are you guys there making ISK almost no one is ratting and no one is mining.
---
But hell don’t join CVA they are the biggest douches and have been douches to COGG for as long as I can remember
---
The fix to this is to change or remove cynos. Local blackout plus a cyno nerf would be great for pvers and pvpers.
---
I'm down with this. Rarely use it.
---
&gt; with the best defensive measures we can organize its just a matter of when the next enemy cyno will be lit and 90 bombers will be on us.
---
how is this any different from before the blackout?
---
I do agree that bombers should get at least 1 or 2 ticks of lock delay after exiting cloak, but that's hardly because of the blackout
---
And some people might just not be able to learn how to do it right. Trust me, they exist and I might very well be one of them. I'll have to wait and see.
---
Exactly. Been loving the blackout.
---
Thank you and saved.
---
You understand that ships had roughly a third of their who then they do now? In fact for years overall ship hp would get buffed because of fights getting bigger. That trend stopped years ago and who has remained roughly the same.
---
Come at me when you read up on stuff. You obviously didn't play years ago and thought you could half ass an argument here. Sorry bro.
---
Btw to put it in retrospect, you know how bad hull reppers and remote hull reppers are? Those numbers on the hull reppers use to be the same as the numbers on the shield and armor reppers. Rep numbers have also drastically increased but the hull repper will be a testament to an earlier time.
---
I laughed for like 20s straight.
---
&gt; you push a player out of his playing style cause you dont want him to have some peaceful time while having a beer or having to put his baby to sleep or taking wife agro
---
he can just, you know, dock up if he's not actually playing the game? sorry if I don't think people who are putting their baby to sleep should be invulnerable from dying while afk and not safed up
---
You know, I've always though ramming should be a think in EVE. Instead of bouncing off like you were hitting a rubber wall, you should do damage to the enemy ship. Specialized ramming prows could be fitted to make ramming more effective and reduce backlash damage to your armour and hull.
---
Thank you for this wonderful news article.
---
It's because Reddit in general tends to be an echo chamber, and this sub is particularly bad about it.
---
The "faction" that controls this subreddit is comprised of the "elite pvp" kids that CCP caters to, and up/downvotes generally occur along party lines, so...
---
If you want upvotes, insult people who don't play in the CCP-approved way, claim that the blackout is curing cancer and that everyone who quit because of it was a bot, or just post anything that someone with a two-digit IQ can easily recognize as supporting the idea that current model of "people whose gameplay doesn't revolve around ganking miners and/or ratters are irrelevant and exist only to generate as many killmails as possible before being driven away from the game" is sustainable indefinitely.
---
If you want downvotes, post actual, sound logic. That kind of stuff isn't welcome around here, since ignoring it is a requirement for supporting the self-destructive system that caters to the crowd that populates this sub.
---
Why do you even play an MMO if you don't like playing with other people?
---
Thx for the huge contribution to the game Squizz, Eve wouldn't be the same without you!
---
I like my solitude more than most people an am known to do stuff alone a lot even in "social" games, but who even gets "bombarded" with private conversations? I've played quite a bit in the last  \~10 weeks since restarting, and I've had exactly ZERO unsolicited private conversations. You can also simply auto-reject/turn off any and all chat and related notifications when you want to be left alone.
---
&gt;  The problem is the unrealistic expectations of the attacker. You believe it is your Bob-given right to come out isk positive when attacking targets in enemy territory
---
[citation needed]
---
Yeah, it's not always worth doing. Whenever I do, it feels more like playing starcraft than EVE.
---
What about that heavy interdictor mod created expressly to allow WHers to continue to use an exploit and close smallest holes?
---
Before the blackout there were more groups in our region, we wouldnt be the only.ones really get hit over and over again.  Before the blackout and bwcause there were more people we were more likely to detect a blops group in our region and act accordingly.
---
Now despite having real people dedicate as scouts all over, its way harder to see it coming. We are still fighting back, we arent leaving, but the sum total of the effect of the black out is that its more punishing on those of us who stay to fight that it is that those who quit, run to high sec or join a big bloc.
---
But hey, if the goal is to get everyone to join said bog blocs, the blackout is working.
---
Makes no difference to me if they did. I don't AP 99% of the time.
---
You're splitting hairs, though.I specifically said if you're making large money doing it then you should have to push buttons.
---
Might be cool
---
Returning to the game after a several year break and I’m making my first industry alt. Was wondering if there’s a YouTube channel that has some good info on how to be more effective at mining &amp; trading (pros and cons between ore mining and gas clouds and such, what’s profitable and what’s not) most the stuff I find is either explaining how to target things, which is too basic or talking about planetary interaction that I can’t do yet. Essentially just looking for pro tips I guess on how to get my foot in the door more effectively.
---
&gt; but it shouldn't have to take another account and 3rd party comms to feel somewhat safe again. There are a lot of solo players, and alphas can't cloak.
---
fc what are corporations
---
A solo player shouldn't expect to get risk free ISK outside the area where game mechanics protect you (i.e. HS). If you want to play securely in the player-controlled bit of space then join a player corp.
---
&gt; With dotlan giving away ratting systems, pvpers can pinpoint exactly where to go with minmal risk of being discovered
---
This is fair and I think stats available to hunters should be much more delayed.
---
why would blackout affect your ratting if you were AFK anyway?
---
Well, I wouldn't really *mind* having an EVE RTS game, but I think CCP should focus their efforts on the main product. ;p
---
You said botting detection software works, i said it doesn't and people still bot, you said thats fiction and not fact, and now you're coming back and saying yes people do bot but the companies knowingly accept it.
---
When did it go from fiction to fact in your mind?
---
I'm new to abyssals, but can't people see these when they drop probes to scan?
---
The meta in HS for solo is using an orca
---
Still seeing plenty of ratting in null, capital and subcapital.
---
Regular cynos need to be made a staging/movement tool only for caps and supercaps, period. Nothing with a cyno should be allowed a cloak. 
---
Right now what they do is what Covert Cynos + cloak should be used for, and in that case the largest thing you should be able to jump is a Covops battleship.  Insta cap-blobbing makes this almost irrelevant.
---
Fleet warp is now disabled
---
I was actually going for a "not going to a 3rd world country...
---
yes it is, by definition
---
Works better when you range it down to 5/15 degree
---
How would people know to drop combat probes to scan in the first place?
---
Probably because Google get paid regardless of whether or not an advert is malicious, and the people who actually get blamed/told to fix it are the websites themselves.
---
I mean, I just started playing and I'm addicted
---
His code is open source, that wouldn't solve anything.
---
If you have an issue with public killmails then talk to CCP about it.
---
You're not wrong, but some of it is nuance. "Blue every fucker in 40 jumps" is partially because of what you said:
---
&gt;Then shrink nullsec by about 30%. Why the fuck is there a goddamn arse load of massive fucking systems in the drone lands? It's all empty shit space for krabs, there is literally no point to any of it. Null should surround low/high, not be it's own fucking continent.
---
There's too much space, so when it gets taken, there are vast swaths of empty space. Instead of leaving it empty to invite people that will come invade you, of course people throw down ihubs and claim it. It's still sitting there empty, so what now? Well, why not put some meat shield renter buffers in it, and make them pay to get fucked? Duh
---
But still, none of this is the players fault. They're playing the game CCP gave them. If they hadn't turned all the player created outposts into faction fortizars, they would've had the structures and mechanics already in place to nuke asset safety. Would've pissed off a lot less people too if they hadn't just destroyed that player history. 
---
CCP just keeps doing all this stupid shit. Where's the AT? How's lowsec doing? Hey community team, thanks for all your effort and...shit, they're gone too. CCP fucks up everything they try to do. They tried to make EVE more dangerous and pushed everyone into bigger blobs and even more people using caps. They can't even do chat in game without fucking it up for years. Maybe have them try to ruin the game and they'll accidentally make it better.
---
Here's Part 1 of my run:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qpUH-9KpxU
---
Fair point, wait til after next election
---
&gt; Why because you say so? Corps have spent the time, money, blood, sweat and tears to own the Null space they are in. They should feel very safe and be able to do whatever they want in that space.
---
Why because you say so?
---
&gt; YOU are the trespasser, it should not be safe for YOU, Null should be nothing but pain for hunters, getting supers dropped on your head should be the norm as they are protecting their Land and property to the fullest extent possible. 
---
it was like that and it still is like that after the blackout.
---
&gt; Go gank newbs in High Sec, cause it looks like that is the only "gud fights" you are really looking for.
---
not all hunters are looking for good fights ,assuming that is pretty silly.
---
nice joke
---
That's also true, but then again you lose that much intels. it's way easier to do it ingame. And as I said, it's a first step, not the solution.
---
You cannot prevent people to create tools to help them live a better life ingame. And that's also why wormholer had it easy when they landed into an occupied system, nobody was caring.
---
Like shooting a discoball
---
You need to work on typing bud. Eve players need at least 85 wpm lol
---
But is it more interesting than what you can find in other part of Eve that are not HS ?
---
That's for you to judge, but I sure as hell can't stand highsec. Bias much.
---
Imagine drifter rorquals that come mine your moon chunks. That would be the era of chaos right there.
---
There is no counter to it? What is a mobile cyno inhibitor used for then? I know it takes time to anchor (like anything you deploy including a mobile depot, anchorable bubble, etc) but it is an option, and is used quite frequently when hunting "whales".
---
I like regional local tbh. Good idea.
---
Again, as I stated before, if you live in a blue donut (and especially if you're deep in one) then expect to have to burn for content. But where you live is your choice, and if you choose to fly with an alliance that is blue to everyone 40-jumps in all directions, then that is on you too. 
---
You can easily move to another area and hunt. I personally am a part of a blue donut, but I choose to live in Jita and keep a jump clone at our forward staging for when I need to be in CTA or Stratop fleets. But for solo roaming, I'm less than 30 jumps from a lot of main staging areas, and since I fly T3D's that means content is typically only 20 to 30 minutes away depending on if I detour.
---
Russians are known hackers and do so in every game they can. Trust me, Ragnarok Online was good before that.
---
But for the lone russian with 40 bots, you have 99 of them playing legit. Sure, some part of Dronelands were botfest, but not everything, as always. Remember that BOT has the tendency to form 250 men fleets to boot invaders out of Fra.. I mean dronelands.
---
Why do you complain about losing to a faceplant strategy then? And *you* in this case is the general you, addressing those to whom the point is relevant. Joe over there may in fact not believe he should be isk positive, so I will have to address Joe's complaint separately. But the first step in correcting any issue is to cut the bullshit and get to the heart of the matter.
---
Since you have offered up the fact that you exist, I will address you individually: assuming your stance is either that capital ship are inherently overpowered or that umbrellas are too effective, by what margin do you substantiate your claim. What power level is too powerful? What effectiveness level is too effective?
---
Shut. Them. Down. Make EvE pure again, stop the ego stroking that those killboards support...
---
Seriously, you saw a bunch of comments talking about how old this is and didn't automatically realize it was old and comment accordingly? Sigh, and this is the elite of reddit shitposting these days.
---
A gank catalyst isnt *risk* if its designed to be as cheap as possible and used like ammo, disposable and one use.
---
Yessss REMOVE ASSET SAFETYYY!!!!!!!!!!
---
Well, landlord obviously will try, but then again, if it happens to die, it dies, no reimbursment.
---
Don't underestimate the abuse renting was.
---
You could self host, but that's got it's own set of issues.  It'd be cheaper in the long run though.
---
why would a small mining and industry corp have people constantly in comms? to mine in belts? to queue up a few jobs daily or do some PI while talking to someone about how pointless your actions are?
---
Try it first before you make an opinion :P
---
&gt; HTFU adapt and all that
---
I keep seeing this, but it's kinda hard to follow through on that when you don't know *how* to HTFU. It's like how [the guy from this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/2pzeg0/unfuck_yourself_airman/) describes being smoked for not getting taught what he needed to know to do his job.
---
&gt; That's how you learn. You get beat up. You ask the stupid question. You make horrendous mistakes. You get chewed out. ***Eventually an NCO will pull you aside, get into your face and scream "UNFUCK YOURSELF, AIRMAN!"
---
Which helps absolutely zero in my opinion.*** But, there is light at the end of the tunnel. As you go, you learn from all the fuckups.
---
Emphasis mine. You want someone to HTFU? Then do more than just spout the acronym and actually *tell them how*.
---
How the hell do you think they know who to ban when the culling comes? Come on now put your thinking cap on.
---
They clearly weren't enemies, is what is confusing u/LeFayssal   
---
They shot at each other for one objective, which isn't huge news as they're blued up to their balls. The absolute state of the large bloc's meant there was no real danger of them not retaining blue-status.  
---
His question should read "Why should we care" he's asking for an explanation of why this was posted to Reddit at all (imo)
---
Highsec would either be a smashup derby 24/7 or a mass of concord on every gate depending on whether it was consider combat or not.
---
Gonna be golden when everyone realizes the ecosystem is gone and there is nothing left to hunt but the hunters.
---
If he knows that his system is distributing malware and he doesn't stop it how is that not being complicit with the distribution? I know he's not liable, but what i'm saying is maybe he should be. Big websites like facebook and ZAM also pull this kind of shit.
---
I believe you.
---
Can't wait till a cyno can be lit in a wh and a few dozen "hardcore" wormholers look at a grid with hundreds of raging f1 monkeys ready to fling shit for no other reason than an fc got mad at a corp that blew up one of his 12 procurer alts.
---
True simple can be pretty fun.
---
I guess that's a very limited use of the word "industry", then. I can definitely understand not wanting to mine in highsec, but to me "industry" is more the actual industry side; manufacturing, invention, reactions, etc.
---
They don't need them when they have stealth cameras everywhere.
---
How to stay aligned with the new meta? Lol dumbass
---
Thx for your work for all these years man =)
---
Be very careful when doing survey's like this not to cloud the results with a "tone" set towards a particular anticipated outcome.
---
I very much got the impression that you and your fellow researchers are testing a theory that online video gaming leads to obsession, depression, sleep disorders and social problems.
---
Whether that was your theory or intention is not necessarily important, what is important is that was the tone I felt answering the questions which instantly made me go on the defensive. (add paranoia to your list of disorders associated with online gamers)
---
Also how to stay aligned for quick escape due to no local.  It works.
---
&gt; don't rat or mine on weekends
---
So deny content? Got it.
---
I used to regularly unsub over summer holidays and come back to a new level 5... they where the good old days though, now we are all doomed.
---
I'm an fc too. Am I special?
---
cherry poppin daddy
---
&gt; Why do you complain about losing to a faceplant strategy then?
---
what does this even mean
---
&gt; What power level is too powerful? What effectiveness level is too effective?
---
I'm not gonna write a bible here, its a mix of way too many things and would lead to endless bikeshedding. Suffice it to say I don't -to a certain extent - really have a problem with a cap blob being very effective at forcing people off grids(and therefore making the ratting space secure through the grid being inhospitable to the attacker), i have a problem when it is very effective at killing the attackers no matter what in all but some very specific types of fits and compositions. 
---
nullbears for some weird reason love to say roamers feel "entitled to kills" when in reality its the opposite, complaining endlessly about "kitey bullshit" or "cloakies" when they're the only ones really viable to do anything in any grid, the latter really only being useful for ganking.
---
Ccp is actually leaning to keeping it permanent and might remove asset recovery from nullsec.
---
This comment will age like fine wine
---
I mean, I would never want people to have to pull all nighters to get a freighter/indy swarm to their staging anymore, but people don't really get how coddled they are compared to where things were just only a few years ago.
---
That sounds absolutely hilarious and CCP should absolutely implement that.
---
Your first wrong Assumption was that CCP did anything to affect *my* isk faucet. I actually made quite a bit of isk immediately after the blackout. I no longer had ask VNIs taking up my havens and sanctums.
---
That being said I felt sorry for the little guys trying to get by. Even bought one poor guy a Super because he had the skills but not the isk. I'm not thinking about myself here. Damn, I'm kind of a nice guy really, aren't I? 
---
But as far as your reply goes, you have in fact told the patent to just stop having cancer. Congratulations!! Your methodology for problem solving was found to be incompetent in the stone age and only recently saw a resurgence within the downtroddened, entitled masses of today's youth. In case you missed the analogy, you amount to little more than a muling child.
---
The topic here was about the ADMs being in free fall because systems aren't being maintained by rafters. Considering the ineffectiveness of an umbrella in a region like catch, we can extrapolate that it was subcap rafters maintaining the ADMs before. With the blackout in effect, the ability to rat and not lose isk to PvP gankers is slim to none. Thus ratting goes down and ADMs follow. The option of "rat somewhere else" isn't an option *BECAUSE THESE SYSTEMS ARE THE ONES THEY ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN!!!* Does that register with you?
---
&gt; To push off smaller gangs you need a small gang of your own with some semblance of coordinated composition, and someone with a basic clue of how to lead it.
---
or enough ramjags
---
Thanks for the info. Will randomize fleet targets more now.
---
Honestly this reads like a really wordy attempt at self-gratification with only the barest minimum of basic information which can be found in more detail (and with less masturbatory rhetoric) than in this article.
---
&gt; Accepting cash will raise some of your expectations  
---
Wow.  My experience is that expectations start at 10 (for zero contributions) and instantly go to 11+ for any vaguely tangible donation.
---
For me, if it's something I will find enjoyable I'll do it for free, and ignore any demands from entitled shits.
---
If it's not going to be fun, there needs to be a signed contract and 50% payment up front.
---
And no, I won't design and code a e-commerce site for "exposure."
---
I was in mackinaw empires when it disintegrated I know how bad it could be. It also depends on what the renters can offer. If they can provide a ton of cheap caps to the alliance they will be better protected than the ones who just rat and mine for the isk.
---
Get gud.
---
Yeah I really doubt you can cloak there. Just fit it with nanos and overdrives and Benny Hill the guy.
---
You forgot to ransom them to save their ship then let them explode anyway.
---
I imagine they already had competition and it didnt matter much.
---
&gt;Usually it suddenly becomes unimportant and unnecessary.
---
Funny how that works, eh?
---
And if they actually cough up the dough... then comes the scope creep.
---
Grr.
---
My car wasn't running the day before the blackout and I wasn't looking forward to the cost of having it fixed.
---
Then the blackout hit and my car worked again, so I the money I saved on car repairs instead went into buying over nine thousand plex.
---
Also, I didn't see my wife for a few hours after the blackout started, so I successfully had our marriage annulled on the grounds that she was clearly a bot and thus it was never a legal union to begin with.
---
Just let cynos be light able in wormholes for a month. They will all get activity at that point.
---
Approximately 8 hours before the suicide attempt.
---
Did you even read my post? We got content constantly. People roamed in fleets and we got fights, people ratted constantly and we ganked them. Does it sound in my post like we lacked content in early eve? 
---
Smart people didn't eat or mine on weekends unless baiting...........
---
I heard there was a blog or something about c13 life, that really intrigues me honestly. Would you by chance know about this? If so I would love a link
---
loulilol smartbomb yolotation... \^\^
---
True. Yeah convoy ops could go pretty late, but was still fun. Worst case we would get to a trade hub and call it, then get everyone back into null the next time.
---
We didn't really accomplish anything with this dialogue then. Can we at least agree that part of the confusion around the problem is each parties perspective relative to either sides engagement profile.
---
&gt; This is happening in lowsec as well
---
this has been happening in lowsec since the moon changes
---
Excuse me? He is a gigachad pirate.
---
&gt; No proof doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 
---
[What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor)
---
I'm afraid the burden of proof is on you.
---
The comms in my Corp are the best part of it. You are in goons though man do that really is in you. 
---
I’ve suggested this a few times to you now, leave goons and join a Corp that does the things you like.
---
Enjoy the game again.
---
I don't know. I've never had a problem with bumps while undocking. I'm sure it would be feasable. Plus, that's what insurance is for I guess.
---
What's not mutually exclusive, exactly? Not sure why the downvotes for pointing out that people are loyal to alliances similarly as they are to sports teams.
---
You can be part of something and have a "team" that doesn't also relegate you to being an F1 monkey.
---
Who cares? He sounds like Mittani having sex with his own clone.
---
Just take the upvote and leave.
---
&gt;Mittani having sex with his own clone
---
I wish, that sounds hot. 😉
---
Oh boy, why do I feel like I just gave another story idea to Naz Al Ghul?
---
I wasnt making an argument, ios and apple are trash, and for simpletons and the computer illiterate.
---
Well I mean actual hunters in real life put out bait for animals they are hunting I don't see it as any different really.
---
&gt; The issue was never about grabbing SOV, especially if nobody else wants it, but to actually be able to use said SOV to grow
---
using sov to grow a small independent group never really happened, not in the last few years at least. Local is irrelevant to that.
---
NaglWhereEverYouAre
---
&gt;and have been douches to COGG for as long as I can remember
---
In the year or so i've been running COGG, CVA has been nothing short of a stellar partner, I have 0 clue about anything that happened before Momo tossed me the keys to COGG though.  This past year has been nothing short of amazing, I've done a lot behind the scenes to help provi get to where it is now, or at least, where it was just before the blackout.
---
Groups are losing their identity though, smaller groups are being funneled into larger groups, which is the crux of OPs complaint, his 5 guys can't do anything on their own, if they try they get shit on, so they have to merge into the provi standing fleet and do what everyone else is doing, so why even go through the trouble of running a corp at that point?  This is where things are, this is what blackout did, and if that's the direction things are going to keep going, it's RIP smaller groups like COGG, really no point not to merge into one corp and then stick that corp into CVA.
---
But hey, what do I know? I'm just a lowly alliance and coalition leader.
---
Awesome video!!
---
I posted this idea in a thread about Abyssal site runners in high sec.
---
This.
---
Not enough people remember when eve was dangerous.
---
Step 1.  Play Eve..
---
Step 2.  Drop everyone in your life who does not play Eve..
---
Simple fix. Disconnect from the internet. Use the tool. Then uninstall and delete all files from it. Reconnect to the internet. Never give it a chance to transmit anything.
---
Otherwise I highly doubt they’re installing Trojans and shit in software like this.
---
I would agree with most of that minus the last bit. Having 2-3 haw dreads dropped on you every time you tackle a domi in TEST space is getting pretty fucking annoying. Especially since it's 2-3 guys in AFs vs a battleship. They even used a jag to bait me into a 1v1 then dropped a fucking super. On 1 Af. But, whatever, made you drop I guess.
---
Where's my fucking shirt?
---
I don't know.  He wasn't drinking that heavily when I left on saturday.
---
I like this. I shouldn't but I can't help it. It's funny.
---
Boooooo
---
who
---
Because most peoples overviews don't show blues.   
---
So PH set them neutral so they would show in the fight.   
---
PH then set them back to Blue after the objective was defended.
---
Excuse me there is more than 1 corp in WAFFLES.
---
Take my fucking upvote
---
It’s like foreplay and cleanup
---
&gt; A cheap ship capable of running the lowest tier sites with a cloaking device, that upon entry into the abyssal pvp arena 
---
Pretty sure only T4/T5's have access to the pvp arena  
---
Cheap ships can't run those, especially not with cloaks. Huh, guess there was no problem after all
---
Thank you so much man you're awesome. This worked perfectly!
---
Why havent i gotten my black leather collar in the mail yet
---
Except thats not what happened here.
---
Nah
---
i takes some effort to get hooked, but once you do you're in for a good 3,5,... 10+ year stretch
---
&gt; But as far as your reply goes, you have in fact told the patent to just stop having cancer
---
You literally asked me how to stop playing in traffic. Let that sink in.
