The Eve community is VERY small in those upper circles. You spend years playing with those guys, fighting them and working out deals and other diplo shit, eventually you become on friendly terms with them all. Null sec Eve is really like 20 friends playing against each other via the command of thousands of real players. It's the ultimate RTS.

Sorry, “Persons of China”
---
First was me I think. We didn't have EM hardeners in the refits and had a bit of a mess trying to form up. Call it a bad dice roll or call it unpreparedness. End result was the same. 
---

---
I was slaved, I know that much. Anyway, fun fight, all 30 seconds I was involved anyway. Always a pleasure flying with you guys.
---
Ah, Merican Corvette...
---
I would join Pen Is Out if I had over 2 billion in assets
---
The best part of blackout is I now have time to play all the content released in the new expansion of FF XIV
---
Is this a new BR tool that will actually work?
---
What he wants can be done without even using the SSO authentication in Excel, which is what that guide mainly focuses on.
---
We clearly lacked Intel on this one, so that's a fair assessment.
---
Try unity on sons (UOS) that's the Corp I am in.
---
Blackout isn't an obstacle, its a flaming pile of turds on a platter that the devs thought people wanted because they took reddit's advice. This is what you get when you base game changes on a circle jerk echo chamber of a reddit sub. You make a very small, very vocal group of people happy and the larger silent group of people log off and don't come back.
---
Yeah, as a guy living in the United States, it's really fucking hard to be able to play at 5 pm on a Saturday afternoon /s
---
I will add you as a contact and send an application in when I’m back. Thanks for the opportunity. I really need to get out of here. I will move my shit to jita

#bringbackbaneposting

Looking forward to it!

Iirc zkill uses AdSense for serving ads. He can not chose which ads show up on the site. He can block them once they appear, but there are no tools provided by Google to preemptively block ads. If you want the malicious ad gone, you'd have to report it to squizz (not mentioning cause he gets enough spam I am sure) so he can block them through AdSense.
---
Sorry?
---
Fwiw you're my favorite out of the two of you.
---
They batphoned Panfam and some other friends, plus china primetime, so large formup. Legacy did also have a rather poor formup I think.
---
It actually do work and load all killmails every time, provide correct numbers og pilots and ships, also maby its just because i aint a fucking retard that i figured out that turning my phone on the side fixed it perfectly for phones. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
What do I do when I get ambushed by warp scramblers?
---
I've lost over 5 ships this week, just by being ambushed by a bunch of these fellas...
---
I'm new/poor, which makes it worse...
---
You don't remember when you called seige in to help with that astra in 4b-nqn and some random Manning the keepstar in 9uy DD there gila fleet when they were about to leave?
---
A fights a fight, right?
---
Amazing how many people are satisfied with being the equivalent of someone else's NPC/minion. In a game where people can do anything, more so than in almost any other game, they choose to do as little as possible.
---
gf
---
Probably the gzip that's breaking it. I'll have a look at that tomorrow and get back to you.
---
Be where they aren't?
---
What circumstances are you getting attacked? Are you somebody's high-sec wartarget? Running into gates camps jumping into low? Something else?
---
Settings, general, uncheck 'try the new map', open the old map.
---
Gank it!
---
Make it all in ascee and name it dwarf fortress in space.
---
Not gunna lie I laughed so hard at this comment
---
It would make it more valuable, but how much is a big question. Keep in mind it is not the only source for faction cruisers, and at the wrong price point those ships stop being used. Look at faction BC's. 
---
The plexing itself isn't very good income, you can literally make more running missions in high sec. Running FW missions makes several times more isk per hour than hi-sec missions or plexing. It would be a huge hit if they didn't at least lower the lp costs for things in the store, or greatly increase the lp value of plexing, at the same time they do away with or nerf the missions. Maybe scale up the mediums and larges to the point that they are worth a fleet doing and worth fighting over. 
---
Another option would be to just make the missions have more tackling rats, so they are all but impossible to solo. We used to run them in gangs of caracals, and we got a lot of fights doing it. They are gated dead-space too, so you don't have people dropping caps on your head, which is nice. 
---
But FW gets very expensive fast, I speak from experience. I blew through billions a month, flying cheap stuff. Great times, but it was financially unsustainable for myself and most individuals. That was also back in passive moon mining days, so many FW corps/alliances could actually provide SRP. Few FW or low sec alliances can do SRP sustainably these days. Granted I could be wrong, but I'm at least not aware of many (there are really only a handful of big low sec alliances left).
---
For peoples reference, why running ads is important for a site like zkill: 
---
It's running on a pretty meaty server. 128GB of ram. Not sure the other specs, but I'm expecting reasonably high. So theres not inconsiderable expense involved. Adverts mitigate that. (Assuming people don't block them. Blocked adverts pay for jack shit)
---
This is really well done
---
what you're looking at is most likely an exploit that uses a sidebar ad as an attack vector. These sorts of ad exploits have been becoming more and more common. It's not Zkill itself, it's whatever ad service they're using not screening ads before they push them.
---
Yes they can't hold home sov in their primetime, doubt they're going to get TTT even if it's TEST defending alone.
---
Dreddit is recruiting, we are a larger corp part of test alliance. Swing by our public discord maybe talk to a few people and see if it's for you.
---
https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch
---
that was epic
---
Come play in wh space? Null static small gang pvp is the most fun I’ve had in 9 years of play
---
We have undocked subcaps to fight CAS numerous times.  Results are usually CAS running away, CAS docking up, or CAS massively outnumbering/outshipping us and then not engaging until everything is entirely in their favor.
---
This is still actively happening for me, iPhone X.
---
 He means use an interceptor for exploration. If you have good archeology and hacking skills they're a really safe explo ship. Make it Insta- align, put a cloak, core scanner, and a relic analyzer on it. Not sure if you can use the combined one, if you can, get the implant, it will work with relic sites too.
---
Thanks
---
I'm not exactly sure. I think the stiletto probably can, the crow may be slightly more difficult. I've never done this myself I've only chased around other people doing it and they were tricky to catch, had to smartbomb them at a gate to kill them.
---
So 2nd tier leadership has no clue of alignments the top leaders make and run in rando directions.
---
Not smart of FRT to burn the only batphone they have. TEST has alot more income independent of TTT relative to Horde. So, FRT, to spite TEST they'd rather bring relatively more harm to the only one effective Ally they have.
---
6 Eve accounts use less resources than a 5 year old fort in DF. Love the game, but FPS death is real.
---
I had this problem a week or two ago. If you check my posts you can look at the suggestions that were given, but it turned out to be a problem with my ISP Spectrum was messing up the connection. They replaced my router and it's worked fine since.
---
You had a killright on you. Did you attack anyone in high sec with safety red or a non suspect pod in low sec at some point?
---
Yes to both... so I guess that’s some kind of bounty system?
---
bet you're feelin pretty stoked epstien keeled over
---
This is the type of content i come here to see
---
He will find salvagation
---
Not all fights are created equal. At least I fought in conflicts that mattered in the past.
---
Gatecamps are my problem, they have fast ships, so I can't exactly outrun them.
---
Enlightened Industries in goons might be a good place to look for you. Or DM me if you fancy some lowsec small gang action.
---
The battle report is well written.
---
You've done something naughty and other players can legally shoot at you
---
If you commit an aggressive act on another player in high or low sec that requires your safety to be set on red they will gain a killright on you. 
---
If they decide to make it public either for free or for an amount of isk they can choose any player can activate that killright on you, flagging you as suspect for 15 minutes which means anyone is free to shoot you.
---
You are a retard.
---
RR is Frat aligned. They show up whenever Frat calls them.
---
Open old map drag cluster away.
---
There will be plenty of dumb idiots ready to feed trillions worth of assets ratting/mining in wrong region every week when the standing moves.
---
Well done Haydies.
---
Maybe some people just want a gud fite in the game? Not just do some gay-ass metagame bullshit?
---
Well then, FRT can stop batphoning Horde. :-)
---
The fleet looks strong.
---
It was really considerate of TEST to make up for it by feeding us an entire muninn fleet.
---
This has officially hurt my brain
---
Can't speak for more than the three CAS roams I've been on so far, but it's really hard to find stuff that doesn't get caps dropped on us or aren't solo stragglers. I've seen us stay and fight against some steep odds until it was clear it'd be suicide to stay.
---
Alright thanks I guess I’ll have to put this in mind next time I do something I shouldn’t be
---
Tbf if you add up all the dead fighters it was propably still about even despite tests turbofeed
---
Sometimes, I think EVE is a stanza for Everyone Vs Everything.
---
But is Snuff going to help defend FRT sov against TAPI?
---
Rest in pickles
---
Obviously, the Titan sticks out through the fly of the pants.
---
And rotates.
---
Yeah, there were bots but there were also largish Russian/Chinese corps heading the Minmatar-Galentte militias.
---
I work in adtech this shit happens and is almost impossible to nail down.  Its something you can only be retroactive about as a supplier.
---
Depends what you want to do with it. If you just want to farm the C4S with daytrips and make idle money off of a reactor/PI farm you're fine.
---
What's your corp history for you to think it'd limit you so hard? I recruit based on how well I think a person fits in with our culture.

Wooow lol

Guy in T1 ship getting wrecked by  turbo autists in faction ones. That's eve online alright. It's almost like they were worried he might kill one of them.

does the cruor actually use gallente frig despite what you wrote?
---
This happened to me once a while ago, it just went away after a bit and hasn't come back
---
You and op are still the reason I’m still subscribed to r/eve! And you are the reason I still pilot a spreadsheet every now and then. I would upvote you both twice!
---
Horde is the big boy in this relation, Frat is their bitch.
---
If Frat wanna survive they will do as Master Gobbins says.
---
I mean. What is life but this? In life it's harder to "do anything" you want but it's also more rewarding to succeed at it and has longer-term consequences.
---
Few would fault someone who "settles" for a boring career that "just" enables him to enjoy himself with a few buddies the rest of the day. But many fault the Eve equivalent, some who F1s for his paps and grinds out some isk so that he can BS on coms with his pals while his sig/small gang/whatever screws around.
---
Just curious if you know, but does he get paid for an ad shown, or an ad clicked?
---
Pandafam dude.
---
What a joke of a leader
---
Are you "eve is real"ing?
---
I got one down to half sheild
---
I was in the Gentleman's Agreement for basically my entire Eve career. I guess being upfront about not wanting leadership roles might help open some other doors but I don't want to be relegated to newbie/alt corps.
---
I've been reading nullsec is losing local which was THE big sell for me over WH so ya that's tempting..
---
yes please come belt rat in ls with your ascendancy pod
---
You mean the guys who are allied with PanFam? Better get your NullSec politiks right there bud.
---
Implying GoTG has content...
---
Pales in comparison to the amount of smut beamed into your AO I'll bet.
---
LUL an Eagle Fleet, okay bud TEST is broke now... You are clueless, bruh, and your memes are shit. Quit bad posting, at least put in a little effort to get to shitpost level.
---
Exacto knife and sticky paper?
---
Are you sure you want all the farmers to switch from missions to plexing? Like you said yourself it affects wz...
---
THIS IS MALPAIS !!!
---
There's no way in hell that this couldn't be used for a really bad OCR botting script. &lt;/s&gt;
---
~~Fly your raven into small gangs~~ get dropped by a nidhoggur and go home with 0 kills.
---
There's idiots doing that now...
---
Plexing is can be done semi-afk in a drone ship and earns you 100-200m/h. A lot more than HS missions. And way less effort.
---
You’re probably 100% correct on that one. Plenty of lads on here will be using VPN’s to hide their dirty fantasies
---
is it sad that I have been playing this game since 2006 and just learned that there was an advanced infomorph skill a couple months ago?
---
Stops playing, selling character totally not for RMT reasons.
---
There's a notification that pops up when a kill right placed on you, as well as a page in your character sheet that shows you if you have any kill rights on you, or if you have any on others. It can't sneak up on you
---
Or alternatively make 10 alts so you can be at everywhere at once
---
I farmed a bunch of Triglavian Salvage. Should I sell that on the market now, or are they likely to rise in price in the future? If you have an idea on how the price will pan out, can you explain whyy?
---
you sound pretty retarded there...you forgot about kids with guns when they used to live in omist....but oh wait....they were on legacy side till mango showed up (even bigger botters fuck out of here
---
If eve RP is cringe, then eve is real :think:
---
Not sure but I did buy it on the eve dlc site and got 1m SP and also bought it on Steam and got 250k. I payed with PayPal both times.
---
Encourage your fc's to take riskier fights and not overblob.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Hey if "science majors" are stupid enough to think the data or rather indicators arent available before the MER is released then Id rather be an arts major. Its honestly quite sad how much of an idiot you are. Like makes me fear for the world type.
---
But where... where are you jumping into gatecamps?
---
SAS \o/
---
COD hit marker sound when you sell stuff
---
Please do not invade my mind like this again thank you
---
Lets say we live in a world where we have easily accessible data that strongly correlates with the MER. Its shouldnt and cant really be used for details but in an event something big happens it can definitiely serve as an indicator for up or down. Now lets say a person making statements has taken the time to actually look at this easily accessible data before making said statements. I know, strange right? People actually looking at things before talking.
---
And then some community college reject decides to be Captain fking Obvious and state "statements without data are unreliable". Now imagine being the guy making the statement. Imagine him facepalming and thinking to himself, "Is this what the world has come to? Idiots with a quarter of a brain are talking?".
---
Its just sad.
---
Tl:dr, moron, you can find data on dotlan. Personal experience has nothing to do with it and its quite cute you are trying to beat an argument on a technicality. Now crawl back under your rock and wait for the next time you think you might win an argument.
---
It's better than catching nothing.
---
Except Krabs aren't safer.
---
Good God
---
Lol:)
---
Its not hesitation, its killing the shiptypes all together. What you fail to see is what happens when you bring 256 of those bombers. No caps will survive which means that caps will never be deployed again. 
---
Its a massively biased suggestion.
---
And titan HAW guns have been nerfed, so have supers fighters. You cant use what happens in Delve to nerf everything else. It just doesnt work.
---
top work as usual buddy, glad we finally got that first Nyx dunked in there :) The beginnings of our wild times helicopter dicking thru Detorid before all this war nonsense
---
Substance. Looooooooooooooooool. Read your first immature post then talk again about substance. And its not my friends. Im not OP. Youre kinda confused dude. Happens when you have too much hormones running around in your system.
---
Excellent content. Makes me want to play again.
---
Why aren't you sharing what you are smoking?
---
Hahahhahah. Omfg. You are delusional. 
---
Its okey, its really easy to calculate but sure. You go ahead.
---
That a big extensive interpretation, we can't police all our allies illegal activity. And a lot of alliances you linked are formes enemis, I don't understand your logic on this??
---
But we can police our own alliance and renters, again if you see botting in our space, please report to our diplos.
---
You are talking like someone who has never been in a capfight. Subcap support is always needed, has always been needed. I mean, its just a bad narrative. Especially after the nerfs.
---
You can erase caps with bombers, its super fking ez. Literally under a minute. But not for a small gang. You cant balance something that is meant for 256 man fleets with something that is for 5 man fleets. Its not that hard to get dude.
---
Hey u/crystalline_E
---
[Remember how you were crying about black out killing provi? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/co86o4/places_to_find_fights_in_null/)
---
It's not 2014 FeelsBadMan
---
&gt;kids with guns
---
i mean, tapi is the reason xix isn't dead, you know the cornerstone of botting grounds for almost a decade in drones, kids with guns is peanuts compared to it
---
I mean c1s with an unrigged astrahus I can see, using like a Drake for sites. It's not great but doable
---
careful to not cut yourself on that edge
---
Dude...i only found out about nullsec in 2014? Literally about 5 years after I started playing
---
No you? stop being dumb?
---
China ain’t Iraq. They kicked our ass at the end of 1950, they can do it again.
---
Im not entirely sure on your stance of the blackout but Im assuming its pro.
---
Why would you at all be able to disappear from local? You are entering someone elses SOV, you have the advantage of being able to pick your targets already. You want more advantages? I mean.. You get that without balance you will have less targets right? It will get even worse than it was. It already is. 
---
And this isnt "adapt or die small gang", this is small gangs need to get something from CCP in order for them to be able to find content that doesnt involve NS. Cause nerfing NS to fix small gang will just end up breaking NS without actually fixing the small gang issue. It will only hurt them in the long run.
---
It will 100% result in NS being depopulated, Im already seeing this on a daily basis and its happening during a test, imagine if the blackout got implemented in its current iteration. People would be leaving on a mass scale. The end result would be less NS players in the game which means less content for small gang which means small gang will start leaving as well because it will be even worse than before.
---
There is no scenario in which the blackout will work. And combined with the "NS is gonna fked for 18 months statement from Hilmar and Co" its dangerously close to actually breaking the game completely. 
---
Im sorry man, I want everyone to enjoy the game like I do. But we need real thought out changes, not memes, not regression. The game has changed, we need a future for it, hopefully one in which LS is more populated which means small gangs dont need to fight under an umbrella for content. But if you think ganking should be easier then honestly, just go to HS. Cause NS will defend its SOV and its people the best we can. If you wanna fight outgunned and outmanned, you are always welcome.
---
Itll be interesting when mine shows up on reddit.
---
Only Dreddit has this requirement. You may want to join it later, it's your choice
---
Also if you want to join some group, just apply, no reason to fear. We all have alliance wide newbie help program. Free ships for anyone that asks for them. 
---
There is literally no reason to stay in high sec. Just apply to Brand Newbros, go through the process, and that's all. See you in fleet.
---
So no need for the Reddit account? Great!
---
Some?

Fuck you, leave the blue donut.

Nice strawman retard

RR krabbers (bots) warp faster than usain on steroids

Good work cunts.

Its okey, youre a good boy otherwise:)
---
People do things for fun. If they get it, there we listen to someone higher in the command chain, as long as command isn't shitty/toxic/micromanaging and such.
---
It's called social contract, and it's been true for all kinds of group through out the ages. People just like being social, even if it they have to resign from some of their freedoms.

Eve online: The electric boogaloo
---
A message that pops up "Don't warp to this minor conduit because the Trigs will scram you, you fuckwit"
---
It's more of a lovers quarel than serious brake down. They'll be blue again within a week, and and then PandaFam will be united again.
---
Mist has a great accent
---
Been a while since I played but I would probably move into a nano hurricane
---
NPC null is always -1,0. But upgraded ihubs are required to get the full extent of anoms so you wont find more there. But you should have higher bounties, fac spawns and officer spawns. Also dread spawns but I think most rats you find are in missions or in belts.
---
walmart parking lot right?

Next to one actually

If you let all the air out of his tires is it warp bubbled?

Sure, what's your in game name?

And a Panda to screw it up.
---
Happy cake of day!
---
&gt; You are talking like someone who has never been in a capfight. 
---
I could say the same to you, actually.
---
&gt; Its not that hard to get dude. 
---
Looks like it is. 
---
&gt; You cant balance something that is meant for 256 man fleets with something that is for 5 man fleets 
---
That "something that is meant for 256 man fleets" is dropping with impunity on literally every fleet size nowadays - 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 - and unless you really outnumber a capital, there counterplay is close to zero. Then they introduced FAXes that only furthered the problem. That is a problem. And yes, you absolutely can balance it by creating something that is capable of actually threatening it back - it's not the only possible way, but it's one of the ways.
---
Capitals, right now, are way too good at every role - they didn't just get their niche, they simply took over everything because "more minerals", which is, once again, a problem. On the other hand, subcaps are not anywhere near as good at fighting capitals even in the specialized ships.
---
The prohibitive cost that has been a factor when they first appeared has long since become obsolete with all the changes to the game.
---
And, allow them to be used offensively against other ships, doing direct hull damage. Thanks.
---
Still less isk than 1 Vanq:)
---
If you wanted a good fight, why would you choose a citadel defense against the 3 largest alliances?  In highsec?
---
That's never going to be a good fight.
---
Well maybe not direct hull damage. I reckon damaging the shields could be good though.
---
Another important piece of advice, there is this thing we refer to as a "Hole Boom"
---
When someone enters a hole it makes a very muted "boom" sound (the sound it makes when you jump through one) And the wormhole has a flash around it. 
---
This lets people know someone had traveled through a hole.
---
They batphone them a lot, of course they would be blue.
---
Cynabal
---
How?
---
I lived in Hi-Sec, played solo, and no one mentioned Null until I joined a mining corp.
---
You are rather confused but sure. Keep spinning the narrative.

Dear CCP,

Buy Forza 4 and an xbox 360.

Steal the paint/decal system wholesale.

Let me make custom skins I can sell on the market.

Hold contests for community skin creation.

Never need to pay anyone to make skins again.
---
Never run out of new unique skins for sale.

If someone is putting you in a leadership role you don't want to hold, they're terrible and you shouldn't be flying under them because you're clearly more competent to start with.
---
I'd gladly pick someone like you up just to have someone with the experience under their belt, not to shove them into a director/ceo role and force them to recruit.
---
One of the most fun brawls I've had in a while. GF Test, Winter Co and Panfam.
---
Ambush the guy as he tries to leave the mall.
---
goteeeeeem
---
shit 2014 was worse b/c carriers could triage AND use normal drones
---
Judging you as being Minmatar
---
I'd say Hel
---
I mean low sec is the prime use for HG implants.
---
So, Perimeter?
---
yes? they already affect the warzone by swinging tiers anyway, the way you capture the warzone is the actual fighting fw groups taking it to t3 and some change then just wait for the farmers to switch sides, fill the ihubs and take the systems, been there done that
---
in 12 years of playing EVE I don't think I have ever heard of someone ratting in a rupture
---
that way we can whore on kills when we forget our combat drones in an ore anom
---
I was slightly less fortunate and lost two dreads, but it was a good brawl... gf all!
---
Noraus disappeared?
---
3 to 5 folks in a C1 could be a blast...Venture for Gas mining, T1 or up Exploration frigates ( really the best ISK, when you have the sites)...and do Combat Anomalies with really any Battlecruisers you are skilled into.  Not sure how many skill points you all have but 3 to 5 players on comms can be a formidable force if you want to blow up other Pilots in Wormholes.
---
that's a difference.
---
Depends on what you are using it for. Give us more info and you can get better answers.
---
Wow. Page after page of only red kills.
---
Cause Eve is supposed to be dangerous. Or is it tedious? I get confused.
---
What happened is that your corporation was likely wardecced by either PIRAT or CODE. They're free to attack you without CONCORD intervention so long as your corp is wardeccable.
---
Dicks out for Thukker Tribe!
---
Worth it.
---
Certainly better then a thrasher
---
No
---
Sobaseki
---
If OP was CODE,  they would have molotov cocktailed the obviously AFK miner.
---
People are happy cause ignorance is bliss.
---
People are sad because they can see what lies beyond their hand.
---
Pretty much like it is irl.
---
This brawl had nothing to do with the blackout. It's just classic old tango between us and RC\\SF.  
---
Speaking of blackout... tbh during the first few days we had interesting encounters but  they died down quickly. Overall our space feels much more empty.
---
Nano? I know a hurricane but not nano
---
Put it up on eBay.
---
Awesome thank you.
---
***k***
---
Ah yeah forgot skynet as well
---
It's a fast shield fit
---
Hurricane. Or Hurricane Fleet Issue.
---
Or, a Vaga and/or Muninn.
---
I mean, having another +30% people from siege green was definitely the difference in them attempting this
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

I personally think its a good idea.

its been attempted over and over.

and at this point. the idea has grown stale as none of them have ever.....actually produced anything.  so people are tired of the idea being brought up at this point.

---
problem with EVE, is the stories are not scripted. so theres always multiple sides. which needs multiple sources. which tend to be spread out.   and in a game as old as EVE,  often forgotten in old sites that die.
---
hence the Empires of EVE project and gamer tribute.  and yet they've missed so much.
---
Those (Russian)alliance had diplomatic relations with Panfam, goons  and pretty much everyone while they were doing their peak botting. In fact, panfam had far warmer relationships with the dronelands groups during the almost in which they accumulated those bans.
---
Touche.
---
You came to a sub about the game.
---
Who is going to be here telling you not to play?
---
Eve is too autistic for someone that hasn't gone down the rabbit hole to comprehend well enough to create a solid retelling imo

I use a VPN that comes with CyberSec, which blocks ALL ads. It's not just on websites, it blocks ads in apps too, very effective for only a few bucks every month.

Kicking a forward deployed light skirmish force unprepared ass, is a lot different than kicking a fully deployed, logistically prepared forces ass... But again, I get the point.

I understand. Seems like I might be beating a dead horse. Thank you for your thoughtful response, has any of the projects you've tracked down the players them selves? Because that is were I see most of the content being. but if so and it still hasn't worked then I would probably call it their

...you shouldn't have all your mining lasers on the same rocks...
---
Thinking about it, since you brought it back to the 50's, just ten years before that, China was basically conquered by a few hundred thousand Japanese at that time....
---
Some of the windows are still transparent, and the flashing colors between the window edges is frustrating. But the idea below of opening the map wide behind it all makes it better.
---
More likely the price will trend down on all of that stuff.
---
It's likely being farmed faster than it's dyinf
---
You're a dick. Lol.
---
Might be cool. A work covering things like the defense of HKs keepstar or the story of CO2 in the time after World War Bee or TISHU in the time leading up to it would probably be worth checking out. 
---
As for covering major conflicts I think its better to just hard pass. Struggles between the blocs is mostly boring shit and filled with toxic people and their dumb rhetoric. Rhetoric is fine when its witty or creative but in the last few years its degenerated into the "made you deploy" "already replaced" type shit and I doubt people on either side would be objective about the course of events. Add to this that the current mechanics of conflict are pretty terrible and don't lend themselves to good storytelling and there just doesn't feel like much good meat there. But I do believe that those stories from small to midsize groups have compelling narratives and most of the people involved would give you a pretty straight write up of how things went.
---
Dude you been invaluable thank you
---
np =)
---
You should pick the game up but not play it

A documentary would be pretty useless because no one will tell you the truth.

Why has he got all of his stuff I'm a low power citadel
---
This is r/eve, so I'm actually guessing he'd get some.
---
Is it really that weird to want a bunch of isk in case if I decide to try again three or four years from now? Come on.
---
Put a Nanofiber Internal Structure II in the low of a Hurricane you now have a Nano Hurricane.
---
why tf not lmao, i go to a enormous w 4 covetors, i go rock by rock until that shit is full. i have a scanner refit so i can tell how much is in it, if theres a small rock i use 1 covetor and both lasers til it dies
---
It's worth a try. Go through the full tutorial, ignore all the mails from the rookie-scooper corporations and join something like EVE University/IvyLeague
---
don't forget to pod after the crash.
---
It’s free to try
---
First things first, C1 sites are hot garbage for reward. Don't run C1 sites if youre after isk.
---
That said, you can solo most C1 sites using an Assault Frig (maybe even all of them cause I last used an AF in C1 sites something like 5 years ago (aka before the AF rebalance)).
---
I don't really remember which worked out better but I was using an Enyo, Ishkur, and Harpy all rather similarly fit. They all worked well for what they were but I have long ago deleted the fits so I can't offer you any help there. Today I would probably start with a Retribution.
---
My general style of running the C1 sites was to orbit the biggest ship close to speed tank their damage. The biggest concern would be to not trigger the next wave early so sometimes that meant chasing around frigates while a cruiser would beat on you.
---
I also tried a RLML Caracal but that was terrible. Too many long reloads, the dps was manageable. If I were going to do it today and use a Cruiser, I would try a blaster VNI. With its new hybrid damage bonus it should do nicely. In my experience Sleepers are really sensitive to targeting drones which are larger than they are (sleeper frigates highly aggro on medium and heavy drones) so start with light drones and work on the frigates or be prepared to recall your medium drones often.
---
Same here. I'm hoping I can get out of Eve what I got out of star wars galaxies online... I'll sell stuff to those that want to buy it to fight others buying my stuff.
---
This is the EvE porn I was looking for.

---
EVE is not like other MMOs where you level up from ship to ship. Each ship in this game comes with trade-offs, and you should fit your ship selection to the task at hand. You clearly have ratting in mind, but there's all kinds of PVE. Are you running lvl3 missions, looking at moving up to lvl4s?
---
I kinda agree.. the only reason i don't think they should be on the opposite side, though, is because that seems obstructive to that radar/tracking/informational tower thing. So.. this begs the question.. Do titan pilots really fly with their pants on their head...? Or do titans actually have TWO heads... o.o
---
hahahaha shiiiii XD I needed that laugh.
---
Spai
---
One point being that we never faced more than 100K Japanese at a time in that war, and that only once, at the end of which we needed nukes to begin the next phase.
---
TLDR: Waffles tackled defenseless renter rorqs. Had allies drop caps with them. Killed a couple renters. Shot their ally's caps. Then welped to 20 feroxes.

Was it a "Covert Research Facility" and did you get a warning when warping in?

You did a site that has the word "covert" in its name. These are the ghost sites. 4 cans in the site. If you fail the hacking game, the can blows up dealing damage. When you initiate warp to the ghost site decloaked, you trigger its timer (most of the time I find that to be 1-3 mins). When you warp in there cloaked, timer will trigger the moment you decloak. When you tun out of time, rats get in to blow the cans.
---
&gt;I don't get why this isn't a thing already.
---
Because unlike combat you don't need to switch targets every 10 seconds. You turn the lasers on and then just wait for 10+ minutes.
---
Ninja Salvaging was kinda made dead by Mobile Tractor Units depressing the value of salvage. It has had a bit of a renaissance with the highsec Triglavian Invasion site though in the last months.

yeah I can get you whole set of cordite blossom, I think the others were the "blaze" ones which I also have, there may have been a 3rd but i cant seem to recall it.

Only if they used ammo to activate
---
&gt;I have joined a corporation in highsec
---
Well, you fucked up.

There is absolutely no reason to ever join a highsec corp. If you want to dodge taxes, just make a 1-man 0% tax corp for yourself.

And what car was it?

So, EVE logo, cheap japanese car, next to a Wallmart.

find krabs.

camp them a lot and tell them to pay you. every so often it works, otherwise kill ema nd or steal drones when they warp off. made several bn that way so far.

How does your hero pilot who never docks up in his raven jump to another clone? Only if he welps the raven first?  Seems more likely he will roam around looking for someone \*anyone\* who will actually until he loses the will to live.

they pull about 400 "easily"

they pull about 800 on a hard CTA. i don't think i have ever seen them form 1200 on their own

Fuck off.

I can’t believe you’ve done this
---
E-Uni has a refining service that gives you the minerals back (with a slight tax but more than you'd have without a few weeks' worth of SP invested in refining). When I hear about what other corporations are like, I fully understand why the people who've been around forever tend to be HS industry types. If you want to do stuff in HS, there really isn't a better corp.
---
PVP types generally don't stay forever because we don't have as much to offer to PVP types (same with NS industry types, generally for the same reason). I am one of those PVP types, so I'm not planning on sticking around forever, but for a relatively new player, it's a great experience even outside of HS. And inside of HS, the services offered seem to be handled better (and less scammy) than most other corporations.
---
tech 2 ones do
---
How much would you want for a cordite blossom set or a Blaze set?
---
oh no 50 seconds of wasted time? cycles are quick and a single wasted one isnt a problem. I dont mine for income i mine so i can produce my t1 bullshit.
---
And what else would you do for ISK, i run smartbombers in havens but is there something 10x better?
---
And yet the US defeated the same Japanese army even after they basically defeated China. To carry the original point on, the US then in the late 90's defeats the Iraqi army of 3.5 million with just a few thousand front line military personal. The point is, I don't understand your point they way you stated it.... However, I do understand China as of today, is a major powerhouse in anything and everything, nothing like they were even 10 years ago.
---
Ah thanks, it was a ghost site. An expensive lesson but a well learnt one. Thank you for the link.
---
Seriously, like the other guy said, make an overview tab with EVERYTHING selected.  
---
Use that when you absolutely don't want to be decloaked.  
---
I lived in null for years, and I used that tab quite a bit.
---
The Tengu is the most commonly used because it can tank so much. Loki seems like not a bad choice good tank good range. The Legion and Proteus seem workable but not optimal.
---
FYI it takes months for the stuff to be delivered
---
No, this citadel wasn't to trigger good fights. This was to invite 3 bigger entities to come blob you and that's what they did.
---
If you wanted free gud fires, You can come to LXQ or contact any of the Horde FCs for a free gud fite without the need to invest and waste billions in deploying citadel assets.
---
No you don't.
---
How were they not immediately defenestrated by a horde of angry programmers?
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that it's not a coincidence the acronym for "player owned starbase" just so happens to be POS.
---
I’ll be in the same boat a week from Monday. Cheers.
---
ASeeing the regional incomes, RR are the biggest botters by far, the ones you defended by deploying near Geminate while Horde was busy with them.
---
Stop being retarded.
---
Haha :)
---
Exploration most of the time refers to the data/relic sites you have to scan down then hack. You want the dedicated exploration frigate for that; your fit cannot even hack to begin with.
---
Combat exploration is probably what you're aiming for - the goal here is to zip around systems and clear Hideaway sites in hopes of either elite spawn at the end or escalation(also called "expedition") into a DED complex. Combat sites don't need to be scanned down so you don't need the probe launcher.
---
Escalated DED complexes offer good rewards for highsec - faction modules and/or pirate ship blueprints - that can be worth tens or hundreds of millions depending on how lucky you are. All this in addition to all the bounties and loot you get normally from the site, as they're usually packed with enemies.
---
The good news is, destroyers are well suited to combat exploration. While slower than Frigates they still warp pretty quick and have stupid amount of firepower given the sites you'll be running in them. And when you do get an escalation/expedition, you can also run it in the same destroyer without having to switch ships. Well, the 1/10 ones at least.
---
Here's an Alpha-friendly general purpose highsec combat site runner:
---
    [Cormorant, Co]
---
    Vortex Compact Magnetic Field Stabilizer
---
    1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner
---
    Alumel-Wired Enduring Sensor Booster
---
    Small C5-L Emergency Shield Overload I
---
    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun, Plutonium Charge S
---
    Salvager I
---
    Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I
---
    Small Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I
---
150mm guns don't do much more damage than 125mm, but they have 40% longer optimal range - combined with double optimal bonus of the Cormorant you can really shoot *far* - in fact you have so much range that for most Hideaway sites you don't even need to move; you can blap all rats from the warp-in point. If Prototypes are too expensive for you, just downgrade to Compressed. The salvager is only for elite spawns, don't bother salvaging regular wrecks in this setup. I prefer Plutonium ammo for PvE because it's half the price of Antimatter and the damage loss is negligible - not to mention you get some extra range out of it.
---
That’s how you do it!

The problem is that ads are CONSTANTLY a source of attacks/malicious code.   Until there's a system to make malicious ads much much much less prominent, it simply isn't worth risking my equipment.

Taking the wheels off entirely.
---
Well it sucks for the guy, but are you really proposing to restrict game design decisions on the assumption that the player base will be in car accidents often enough for it to matter?
---
I mean, we’re talking about eve players here... How often do you thing we get out of our basement anyway?
---
I think that sums up the game nicely. I'm going to use that next time I have to explain EVE to someone.
---
Disclaimer: Not my video, just posting it since Lokley doesn't seem to post his videos any more. Great watch.
---
First time I actually logged and did something in like 9 months. Saw a sabre burning for supers and had flashbacks of sparton in AT practice asking why something wasn't screened so i figured I could at least scram that even if i didn't know how much or if the game changed. Was really fun. GF!
---
No it doesnt
---
Dont do this, just cargo deposit in ANY citadel and asset safety out
---
Why should the game be designed around edge cases like that.
---
Have a look at Blokada. VPN / ad blocker for phone

Very nice piloting Intigo. Hope you post more videos like this in the future. I'm honestly surprised that you decided to publicly show your brawling alt but I like it.

&gt; The Eve community is VERY small in those upper circles. You spend years playing with those guys, fighting them and working out deals and other diplo shit, eventually you become on friendly terms with them all. Null sec Eve is really like 20 friends playing against each other via the command of thousands of real players. It's the ultimate RTS.

It's also one of the content killers.

This is kind of true and more convenient in the long run. I have subcao alts in 4 regions and (super)cap toons and ships in two
---
To confirm this there is a quote ripped directly from an INN stream chat where a member of CCP used this phrase.
---
It's in my bio in game.
---
sometimes it's not that we want to play solo. It's that it takes 2 hours to change clone, meet friends in Jita, change ship, wait for the one who is late, start the roam, realize someone forgot nanite/ammos/drones/drugs, go back to jita, then head to  a low sec, make 40 jumps in low, find nobody , then finally find a fleet even more bored than us and we know already we lost but may as well whelp and go back to a lucrative activity.
---
Also, why WORK for someone else in Eve ? Because that's what corporations are. A part of the taxes are paid to make someone richer.
---
they are needed in specific cases. eg the "anomic base" versus angel, or versus guristas.
---
So you stream snipe and are excited to kill them afk? Holy shit scraping the bottom of the barrel
---
If you think I wouldn't pay the same 55 plex for a skin I made myself,  you are mistaken.

That was pretty funny NGL. Was nice to see Provi really stand tall after a fight.
---
Na it was just funny because think of the timing we were originally going to try and bait him with one Hyperion and get him to drop in the black ops battleships.
---
But we boat like 15 jumps from jita in battleships get there and he fucking walks away. 
---
It was just a funny turn of events, Besides this guy might as well have been AFK anyways there is a reason he is well known and its not because he is a leet PVPer
---
Quite enjoyable to watch. It's funny how people keep underestimating a BS's dps and possible application, if done right.

because we tried too often to stop the tide of stupid, only to get drowned. oh, the stories i could tell from that place... but it's too early in the day here to drink.

suffice it to say: i no longer work there.

And you never opened the Star map or wondered what all the other red systems are?

who cares?  GF is a bannable offense for mclean.
---
First minute nothing happens, last minute nothing happens. For a 8 minute video that's too much filler.
---
Are you 'at war' this is displayed in the top right of your screen.
---
Dod you have a 'kill right' on you? This would be because you shot some one in HS or podded some one in LS that you did without mechanics to support it.
---
Had you possibly taken something from an NPC or container that was makred yellow? This will make you 'suspect' for 15minutes.
---
He'd be better off placing a link to a tipping service (ko.fi seems popular) rather than trying to rely on ads, especially given how ads can cause things like this. Eve's population is fairly tech literate so adblockers can be expected anyway.
---
Tengu is probably your best option. Just in case you're running combat signatures in highsec: don't use a T3C; they won't be able to enter most sigs you find.

amazing - what was up with the MWD speed though at the end?
---
Is that a Jester or a Fool?
---
Yes, for real. If you have 2 accounts you can easily try it. Just get a frig with mwd and lock it with battleship. While mwd does increase sig and you will take more damage it wont change the lock time. Also target painters doesn't boost lock time either.

They're camping near the stargates, first it's just one guy with a fast ship the whole place, he sees me, activates MWD, and catches me with the warp disruptor before I can warp away.
---
The the rest of the fleet shows up to finish me off.
---
I think that's just the standard UI bug with modules shown as cycling but not actually in use - cycle them on/off or drag them around usually fixes it
---
he could have spotted it since the MWD was cycling while he was killing the gnosis, even while he was scrammed, but obviously not a big deal
---
No, this is totally not my alt, we are 100% not related players!
---
Oh, wrong acc...
---
Sometimes I do, but I do not mind if someone else does. Thank you.
---
That's a really good advice, thank you :)
---
Have no idea. This fit is obviously have no Higgs... Speed get back to normal after I turned mwd off/on, but everyone was gone already.
---
used them all extensively... Loki has best tank followed by Tengu. Problem is, you'll be hauling lots of missiles with them. Proteus is awful since the t3c update, dont touch it. Legion is awesome for the nomad life, you can carry loads of crystals for guns and chain c3 sites. Also no drones makes it great for WH combat explo.
---
If you're after null combat explo with no WH action, then Loki edges it if you are in friendly space to restock missiles.
---
Thank you.

TIL...
---
Heard something about this one, but never seen it myself
---
You can join pandemic horde for example and participate in fleet battles from day 1
---
Seems like an excuse to bail on the war to me.
---
Depends, are you a pussy?
---
My first ghost site was a few days ago, I warped in there and THEN started reading the uni page on it. 
---
"A timer you say? That's interest...... oh... rip"
---
The next few have gone a lot better :P
---
This would be... Uh... Pseudobotting?
---
They dont
---
Im puzzled by the rorqual kill - did they team up to kill the rorq and than snuff double crossed the titan pilot?
---
I personally get in there with my astero at 10-20. Quick scan, hack and open the cans with the juicy stuff, then I gtfo. I never try to open more than 2 cans.
---
Don't know any groop that runs armour but warp to me incursions offers srp.
---
Depends on the ship, are exploring then yes. Are pvping then you meed them slots.
---
Great video my dude keep it coming !
---
I successfully played Eve on a 4G connection when I was deployed to Kuwait in 2015. It ran just fine with 5-6 accounts. As I recall, even with updates I never went over 6gb per month. It was painful to download updates, but otherwise the game ran very well.
---
Arigato Warden sama !
---
You know, some people take pride in fighting outnumbered instead of blobbing. Considering they were 4:1 outnumbered they did ok.
---
Half the payer base will tell him the game is shite while logged in and krabbing.
---
When will people learn not to solo procurers or skiffs?
---
Target painters are a thing and will get you on kills, come to think of it so are drones. If you have no drones your doing it wrong.
---
That'd be the case if horde actually had any independent agency. We all know that isn't true.
---
What does [the activation page](https://secure.eveonline.com/Activation/) say?
---
N I C E
---
Probably camping...
---
If you get ganked, don't call IRL CONCORD. That's a total narc move.
---
Many good ideas, admittedly my whole issue with clones is the cool down timer, I got some solid implants and I am not gonna risk a station going low power with them, so often finding myself in the extra long cool down when I want to visit low/null. 
---
I would love if NPC stations had the same time requirement, just cost a crapload more.
---
And TestPhorde in direct interfering with Frat strategic objectives by protecting Test SRP income? :thinking:
---
It's because supers are absolutely broken.
---
Nice
---
Well seige green's main reasoning for siding with rc is that they need help vs snuffed out (atleast as far as i was /am aware) and that we don't usually shoot snuffed out as they are semi-freindly reds who don't shoot us 1st usually :P
---
Very nice video.
---
Love the editing and adding fleet comms always make the videos more realistic since you can catch all the emotions going on behind these internet spaceship battles.
---
take your pills old man
---
what?  bill....
---
ADC and a midslot was added, high slot removed.
---
Kinda sad now
---
Wormholer btw
---
Important detail. New bros can in fact run these sites.
---
For these sites you need a cargo scanner. Scan and then hack only the most valuable can.
---
Also you need something tanky enough to not get insta popped if you get a can explosion.
---
Personally I used to do these in a Vexor.
---
Fly Safe
---
Depends on if you can defend it.
---
The best fit is pretty useless if 10 bombers can run circles around you.
---
What part of "forget our combat drones in an ore anom" did you not get there? I'm sorry, when it's 1 AM and I'm dead on my feet and have work in six hours I don't really notice things like drones, you know? Other things take precedence, like docking up so I can \*go the fuck to sleep.\*
---
Prime AUTZ. OI OI OI
---
This.
---
It's time for you to win at Eve
---
I don't think I've seen anyone ever say that
---
The only real defense for an Azbel is a fleet, so you want to think of a fit that complements that.  ECM is good - you can jam out enemy logi to help your fleet kill them, as is tackle (webs, etc).
---
we can discuss it on the podcast if you like
---
260 upvotes? I think we're good for a while, at least until it regains exposure.
---
No idea what that is, so no.
---
All i know is calling another person (presumed to be guy, since eve) "hard" has some connotations. :P
---
Badabababaaaaa, I'm lovin' it
---
...almost anything is 10x better than mining.
---
Except they don't, you can go slaughter hundreds of empire police without any response.
---
If you want to pvp, why are you in a mining corp? There are corps that do both, and theres nothing stopping you from mining while you're in a pvp corp.
---
You wont ever get an accurate BR for a battle that includes so many dead fighters
---
got to hand it to test for sticking around as long even though lost fighters was damn good fun, the tidi was a pain as usual as well down to 17% at one point. That bubble burst towards the end of the fight tho what a hero.
---
I think TDF is the only armor group
---
How is lacking features a way to make up for a flaw?
---
They were buffed
---
r/cursedimages
---
They have longer reinforcement periods than unfueled structures that cost hundreds of times more.
---
Well I thought it would be cool to join a mining guild to make some start up low effort cash.
---
Novice plex's take 10 minutes each, imagining you could do 6 in an hour, at tier 4 thats 125k lp. At a rate of 1000isk per lp thats 125mil. But you're not going to do 6 per hour, and you'll probably lose ships or time to pvp'rs. When a faction is at tier 4 there are few systems you can plex in, so you'll get attacked or at least have to safe up much more often. You can make more blitzing lvl4's in high sec.
---
This is just abusive players, it has nothing to do with China. English speaking players have done this shit as well.
---
I mean their ships go into armor so often they might as well be the second HQ armor group.
---
This is nice and all, but can someone explain the point of abyssal PvP? You risk what I assume is billions worth of ship on what is to a large extent a coin flip? Are the drops that good?
---
Nothing's automated here.
---
It’s now happening to me on mobile, I can’t look at killmails without being redirected immediately to some page I can’t go back from. /u/squizz can you take a look
---
Lmao, first thing I thought was...  All this over a poco?  What year is it
---
There are corps crops that do both. They also teach you and some even give out ships,  skillbooks and other things to help newbros out. Have a look around and see what suits.
---
the loot from the cache is crap mostly, not more than maybe 10 mil or so, but the loot from others can be nice
---
\*nothing to see here wave\*
---
This is /r/eve so you will automatically get shit on for mining. Anyways go to faction wafare lowsec, lose a lot of cheap tristans, eventually you'll have enough experience to know what you're doing, which fights you can take, range control and so on
---
It’s cool I’m not too worried about what people think about mining, I’ll be doing that today as well, just roaming lowsec solo
---
Well skins are more than 55 Plex in a lot of cases, but yeah.
---
ooooof
---
&gt;Overall our space feels much more empty.
---
yeah we feel that too
---
https://gist.github.com/fuzzysteve/eaef4434773f8e311e417f6c37a16fa8
---
yep, almost certainly the gzip :) throw in a binary.decompress and it worked.
---
Also elo came back and obviously started using it, and other bandwagoned
---
I remember some groups still said it was shit even after elo was using it and then eventually adopted it *cough* Tri
---
Question: is the rag super obese fat or super skinny?
---
Use t2 subcap launchers, t2 paints, a web, a point, BCUs in the lows
---
If you don’t understand what I’m saying don’t drop an azbel
---
https://github.com/Kyle-Cerniglia/EvE-3D-Printing
---
They're not processed yet though, it's just raw 3d .stl files
---
So you have to do the clean up of what details to print, which holes to close etc..
---
Dayuuum
---
That would amount to dragging them out of the car after the wreck and beating them with a lug wrench
---
Which still helps their enemy.
---
I guess they fixed it [http://prntscr.com/or7mwp](http://prntscr.com/or7mwp)
---
the ingame channel "SF Spectre Fleet" has open fleets quite often that you can hop into, good place to get into PvP

join it, check it out

At the bottom it says that clones can't share the same Citadel... Ummm..... where do we send our corrections?
---
Do you have Tormentor Ironblood?
---
&gt;Can you press three fucking buttons every 10+ minutes? No? Then eat shit, botter.
---
You're completely misunderstanding what bots do. Tediousness doesn't affect a botter because yknow, the bot takes care of it. The botter isn't pushing any buttons, though grouping mining lasers isn't the most tedious thing in the world, fixing stuff like this in general makes the game less annoying to play and makes botting just a little bit less attractive.
---
Do you have any iron blood?
---
he has been back for about a year now and the institution is dead. Hope this helps
---
You don't need to wait at all. Of course, training a few skills up (which is done passively in eve even if you're not logged in) and discussing/learning/being taught a couple of basic things before you go in will get you better results, but it's not like grinding for months. A bunch of small frigates can kill a battleship with a bit of coordination, knowledge and player skill.
---
All you need to be useful is a frigate (the smallest class of ship) with tackle gear (modules that prevent the ships you target from leaving the battlefield). You can have your character train the bare bones basics in a matter of a few days. The idea is, you pin it down and start shooting if it's something small you can handle, or you pin it down for your friends to kill if it's something bigger.
---
There are a lot of corporations that take in new players in null security space (null sec) as well. These will give you a kickstart by offering you skill books to train for free, a place to make in-game money and access to a lot of people with more experience than you. However, they are also the gateway into some of the biggest power blocs in the game. If that's what you're after (the empire building game) they are a good fit.
---
If however you just want to go out and shoot stuff without being restricted by rules, diplomacy and doctrines (specific ships and fits that you have to train for and fly in alliance operations) and having to attend mandatory ops (often at inconvenient times of the day or night), they would be a bad fit in the long run. It could be useful to join them from a while, learn a bit about the game and then leave to look for something else.
---
Alternatively, you could join eve university. They have sections active in each different type of space available in the game (nullsec, high sec, wormholes, etc) to teach you the different mechanics involved.
---
If you head into low security systems, there are different faction warfare systems(FW), which lore-wise represent the ongoing conflict between the big empires in EVE. Inside, you will find Complexes(Plexes), which are tiered: Novice accepts only T1 and pirate frigates, Small accepts anything up to cruiser, Mediums are for cruisers and Large ones are for anything bigger. In the best case, you can enter a novice plex and fight another newbro on a T1 frigate. On the worst case, you will fight two or three people with pirate frigates, which will shred you, because the number of people that can enter is un-limited. The D-scan tool will help you determine how many people might be inside, but it's not always easy to scan and fight at the same time.
---
Keep in mind that beside the ship, Skill points and actual manual piloting skills will play a part in determining the winner, so you will get better in time.
---
Some beginner geared corps (like Eve University) take out newbro frigate fleets regularly, so you get your first taste of fleet engagements and learn the basic fleet roles and commands. If all goes well your fleet commander might be able to arrange a fight with a group with similar numbers and skills, an even match so to speak. This is an ideal situation though, most of the time the fights will be unfair and you will find yourself on both sides of the coin. 
---
So, combat in EVE is very accessible, and most of the time, unfair, because human nature is to never take a fight you fully expect to lose. So be prepared to drop on and get dropped by anyone!
---
How much for the harbinger blood raider, Oracle iron blood, and revelation iron blood. And dco you have any other iron blood?
---
You can spin the tires all you want, just remember that heat damage can transfer between slots on the RL server.
---
last time they did something like that it went sour fast. i think they now stay away from that
---
What specifically do you want to do or know about it? Start there. The first month or two of the game are fucking horrible - then you find a group if people you like and it becomes life
---
Ok, I laughed a bit too hard once I understood the last one :)
---
Don't think so because I'm manually clicking everything. I'm basically just cloud gaming
---
Thera is the exception because of npc stations. so u can jump clone to them.
---
There are several possible ways to deal with your problem.
---
1. Don't travel to low-sec to farm rats.
---
2. Find a way into low-sec that's less likely to be camped. What system are you entering? If it's close to the main routes from Jita, or an entry into an active Faction Warefare system, camps a much more likely.
---
3. Fit your ship for travel, in a way that makes you hard to tackle, and carry a refit for what you actually want to do. Refit once you reach your destination. The [cloak trick](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_Trick) is one way to do this: a rack of warp core stabs in you low slots might be another. Neither will be 100% guaranteed to be effective. What ships are your flying that get popped?
---
bUt Is iT rMt
---
...dont forget collateral. ;)??
---
Not for blood raiders, for guristas or dronelands yes or for the 10/10 in serpentis space. Im not sure about which t3 you d want use in blood raider space. You probably cant do the 10/10 in a t3.
---
&gt;So i thought, maybe it's simply the lack of midslots that made it trash.
---
And you were right, they added a midslot since then.
---
Is raising race specific ship skill give any damage bonus or anything?? or it is just a requirement  
---
like "Skill at operating Minmatar/Gallente/Caldari/Amarr battleships."
---
Dont fucking play it.
---
[removed]
---
Blackout is the best change to the game since I started playing. More pvp now than ever before. Just learn to use the ingame map for activity
---
There is no money in mining.
---
Just depression.
---
Invalid/already used.
---
You can definitely get out and get some frags in faction warfare and enjoy solo pvp from pretty close to day 1. Yes, without fitting and support skills you'll be at a disadvantage, but it doesn't take long to get these trained. Or you can bring some buddies and blob the shit out of people. Take a look at Suitonia's "eve is easy" series.
---
As for fleet battles, take a look at NPSI (not purple shoot it) groups, such as Spectre Fleet. They run public fleets for anyone to come on and cause trouble.
---
I am interested in the human variety
---
I hate this fucking sub lmao

Where is the cap stable highsec L4 clone? /s

I already wrote you via email, from ph***. ru mailbox, and we discussed them briefly.
---
I had to postpone orbit graph implementation as I switched to DPS graph, but next week I will have time to take another look at your notes.
---
Ah i just checked it  
---
Minmatar Battlecruiser bonuses (per skill level):  
---
5% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret damage  
---
5% bonus to Medium Projectile Turret rate of fire  
---
so it affect this right???  
---
thankyouuu
---
you do know there is an in game calculator dont you?
---
You can also see the MWD cycling, but not actually pulsing green.
---
So now it’s PH interfering FRT all of a sudden since they decided to show up this one time?
---
Oh, so that's where the other a-type was.
---
It's just that you can change clones in a citadel with a clone bay without getting a clone countdown timer. The switch removes booster effects, so you can remove the effects from a bad booster and try a new one
---
Ahh nice, thanks.
---
&lt;3
---
Vexor, caracal, and some other cruisers work. They're very cheap. The most effective will be a drake.
---
Im confused , whats the truth?
---
just fit whatever. if you don't have anyone to help defend it, it'll die anyway.
---
This version of Intigo is way better.
---
not for belt ratting, in a legion
---
Instead of doing what they should they like just pressed f1, so they whiffed the first volley.
---
If you’d like, my corporation is based in low-sec., where we do both PvP and mining (and we mine moons so, better ISK than high-sec., mining). We’d be happy to help you get going.
---
Send me a message ingame @Martin Lockheart if you’re interested.
---
DM me your in game name - I’ll send you some isk to buy a few extra Tristan’s.
---
Warp To Me offers SRP, but they aren’t armor. That said, the shield skills a required are pretty minimal if you’re DPS. You could train them in a few days to a week.

Check zkill losses.

I mean, he was fighting our players, who it's basically a free win

It was sarcasm, friend

You quitting sounds like a good thing

Engine Thermal Shielding rig, as pointed out by /u/PracticalPotato.
---
if frt don't reset his status, i think test and goons can get advantage agaist n3/ph/pl
---
Looks like you only have Shitposting II or III. Remember, anything worth training past I is worth training to IV, or V for an key skill like Shitposting.
---
Don’t knock it till ya try it Shep

Be aware of Security Rating Loss when you attack a player in Low Sec (unless you enlist in FW and attack an enemy). ;)
---
Yea. If you dont find anyone DM me. I'll do some PVP stuff with ya.

Thanks everyone for the responses. And the 1 downvote :)
---
I'll stick with TDF for now. Really nothing to complain about except the Desktop
---
I’ve never flown with them but I believe uroborus has English FCs. You probably need a vouch though
---
You could read the reviews on the Amazon page you linked...

Why not for raiders?

This is like the best comment itt.

I am interested in Imperium Jubile Skins, please send me a mail with what you have and the Prices.

Yes they are worth doing for the experience.
---
Incorrect.
---
yes such a rush to get into a tackle atron and die immediatley
---
Holy fuck that BR tool is cancer
---
em hole starting at 0% resi, still good with a proper fit Imo.
---
Hey man if you want a Corp that mines, and also PvPs, we're looking for nerds. We have a wh that be bust up moons in, drops 50% spod. We like to frigate roam and drop into null for brawls. Let me know if you are interested and I'll pass you the mail :)
---
Noone cares, you are all a bunch of salty little fucks and nothing you do will have any significant impact in the game.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but you and your friends are just a bunch of losers. Deal with it and go fuck yourself.
---
don't mind me, I'm dumb and misread the list of 7 frigs because there were more than one per line but 5 entries
---
In going to be honest with you m8. Mining is shit most mining Corps that "pvp" are shit. Join a good Corp. I'll leave that choice up to you because any advice I give you will he biased.
---
Tengu pilots?
---
I love your fit, there are 2 things to it. First there is a large crowd of bitter nerds who will always look down because in their mind your playstyle isnt minmaxed to make isk. Ignore theses folks.
---
Secondly, the 1 and 2 out of ten ded are frigate only. I dont have a fit to give you but suggest you test your own fits. Put resists proper for the space you fly in and probably an active tank instead of a buffer.
---
Love what you are doing, goodluck.
---
Whatever.
---
&gt; Plexing is already mostly pve. That would make it even more pve.
---
?? yes plexing can be considered pve i guess but removing missions wouldn't change anything about that, it would be the same amount as before minus the missions and with better payouts for plexing. The supply of plexes is way lower than the amount necessary to scale to the levels mission running did, so the farmers wouldn't just switch that easily to plexing full time.
---
&gt;  It's already horrible grindy system 
---
agreed
---
&gt; that is worse than 0.0 sov wanding.
---
hell no, sov wanding is far more cancerous. I hope you enjoy being jammed and therefore needing to warm up several times while dedicating an alt to do nothing but sit there and be unable to do anything else in another grid if you desire
---
There are a lot of newbro friendly corps willing to teach you, just join one of them and ask away.
---
EVE Univerity is a great place to learn, and they have an amazing wiki, you might wanna contact them.
---
Interesting... review says support can manually apply it? ah
---
welp some ppl dont read books it look like. that book is really good tho :)
---
I do it with 5.
---
No it's not.  Please enlighten us because your troll  Ass couldnt be bothered to..
---
Join a guild, and ask stupid questions =)
---
This game is Very Complicated, and everybody who's been around knows it. So we are used to hearing the same questions from new rookies all the time.
---
I highly recommend joining one of the noob friendly Corps, such as [Eve University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University). They will teach you just about anything you want to know.
---
Mining is easy.
---
It's also shit.
---
Because it already is.  No one, who ever lived in null has actually lost everyhing since the exodus expansion.  Yes your sh*t might of been locked up, but when an outpost fell the stuff was not blown up.  Pos's typically carried corp matierial used to construction of stuff, which could get some nice loot, but usually if u had stuff in a pos it was barely anything, as the corp hanger was usually on lock down.  The point is these are not actual edge cases. Eve is a game, shit happens irl and you should not be penalized 100% when shit happens. 
---
However, in my opinion there is wiggle room.  In that ast should not have asset safty, nor should ec's or refineries.  These should be treated like pos's.  A fort and up should though as they are cost for cost the same as an outpost.
---
If i could initate asset safty out of game, like from the eve app, then by all means low power buildings should lose asset safty much like a pos with no shield is WAY easier to kill.
---
how you wear condoms?
---
Mail sent in game, been trying to convo, what tz are you?
---
Bye Felicia
---
A lot. The ammount of ex member my corp had that left for irl issues suddunly, only to return years later and play again is long.  And eve was and is already designed this way.

Honestly I totally forgot about the test server, which would let me play around with fittings. Thanks
---
Can crabs experience depression?
---
The reset's interesting but no take on "Noraus disappeared" and that 9 months of TAPI shit in local finally led to a visit from local government employees who may even now be asking him questions about Tianamen Square and the Republic of China with a car battery wired to his balls?

Or possibly he forgot to take his laptop on vacation.

Panfam + winterco + HRE just blued up a couple months ago to go after legacy, for the second time in 2 years. Imperium and legacy are not going to let themselves get singled out. Sure you might call it a blue donut but it's a simple fact that both of us hate panfam more than each other.
---
GOTG do their own thing, I'm pretty sure neither legacy or imperium gives a fuck what sort does or if he loses all his shit. The one thing he's not allowed to do is assist panfam.
---
pandafam is also pretty fucking massive btw and that's after losing their allies in HRE and GOTG. Alliances like TRI and SLYCE have been recruited as meatshield.
---
If nothing else, I commend you for knowing your limit of engageability.
---
He is 3 months in the game and is asking for advice because he would like to train into a T3 Cruiser!
---
Where is the problem with that?
---
They can move a fast ship towards you, proper steps to take are, 1 inspect your surroundings and take your time. look waht is close to you. 2 click in space to align somewhere and hit your mwd then cloak then fire the mwd. 3 burn out successfully.
---
You forgot to mention that we often SRP all logi pilots as well ;-)
---
Fraternity/Elo still use Muninns alot
---
Thank you for the good Frigate fittings.
---
All I read was "I claim to be selling 1.5 t in skins legitimately, but I can't be assed to spend 800m on one injector so I can try contracting up a few rank. No seriously guys, I'm not a scammer or a retard, I swear."

Is this guy mining in staging ?
---
Goons called it shit since the ADC patch, and here we are , months later we get a minimum doctrine aswell, something something glacial speed
---
The battle was swift.
---
This looks like it was run through Google translate across six or seven dead languages, I hope to the gods English is the ops 5th language.
---
This might be the most retarded clip I have ever seen posted to r/eve, everything from the iphone you played this on, the ship/fit you use to your thought that this was reddit worthy literally boggles my mind. Sorry for being toxic if you are a newbro but damn.
---
You'll have to cisit Umar Hills and buy a copy of History of the Zhentarim from Fael. He can hook you up.
---
HACs in general have become to strong imo, the peak of subcap fleets should be battleships with an support fleet  , and not 2.7k m/s, 200k EHP, 100km range cruisers
---
&gt; Join a guild
---
What is a guild....?
---
You can't have two clones in a citadel. You can have a clone and your pod in there though. So what he said is correct.
---
Nice film.
---
Sounds like the dude has patience judging how long it would take to accumulate.... Stands to reason he's in no major rush to liquidate

Newbies should just all go to 0.0 space then, the place you feared and left like a bunch of salty kids

fuck that triple volume music

That feel if you are so late with the vid that zkill is no longer delayed.
---
Just go to lowsec and convo dudes who nuked you, ask them if they know of a corp in the area that takes newbs and gives out tristans. Then join it, dont go fucking mining leave it to bots.
---
Even against enemies for which the tengu is sub optimal, its so strong is offers you the same kind of performance as a loki or legion.
---
yes, I know
---
I do know.
---
some systems.
---
Nobody cares about coalitions when their highsec income is on the line.

If you pass thru  low sec in a pod you, you deserve to get podded

was Eros Blossom the 3rd?

Then don't join an alliance.
---
Next time, when it's a bit misty, icy or whatever, cover the windscreen with GF GF GF. All sizes. Cover every single window: forward side and rear. If there's a sun roof, cover that as well. 
---
Then leave a note under screen wipers explaining "car now permanently pointed due to lack of parking permit", and demanding ISK is sent to release it.
---
Post his reply to this sub or wherever, especially if he doesn't get the joke.

I live in low sec and the only time it bill has come up is the black out. People in null forget there’s more then sub 0 security systems sometimes

So I've been messing around with NPC mining spawns for a while now and I've noticed something odd with the Amarr cruiser response fleets.  I'm pretty sure this is not supposed to happen but it has multiple times now.  All the other NPC's lose range around 75km max unless its a battleship response fleet but the Arbitrator never misses at any range as long as I am on grid.  As you can see, arby is hitting at 1,767km for same amount each time.  I extended the range to over 2k and still hits for same amount Every time.  Can anyone else confirm they have experienced this and whether its a bug or a fkyurface, notgonnadoitwithasniper mechanic?  As far as I've seen the arby has unlimited range on grid and 100% tracking on the lasers.  Always hits for the exact same damage amount.  I'm leaning bug....but ccp.../me shrugs.
---
Tankiest hac is the eagle at about 100k, no one gets 200k, or 2.7 m/s, and at 100km your dps is trash, eagles have 230 dps with max skills with spike
---
All of the stuff you want to do is already happening without a big enough negative impact to the game to justify changes from CCP.
---
I think the 3rd one people might be thinking of is the Rosada dawn ones they released to support cancer awareness
---
what a nice summary of r/eve posted on r/eve
---
[MFW a dozen bombers show up to my mining op](https://imgur.com/a/KhvsAqm)
---
AFAIK it's been like that ever since these rats got introduced. They behave interestingly, at least compared to normal rats, but damn are they broken. It's a real shame CCP has a habit of often leaving things half finished ever since the expansion cycle changes.
---
YES SIIRRR! Hit me in game on my toon.
---
SaltyandSweet, i live in amamake. come by ill pay for your frigs to lose and we can go have some fun.

This
---
Another question: In the ad where the three bros find the massive ship (what is this ship called?), why dont the gang who attacked them (pushed the mout of their turf) follow the one survivor past the portal?
---
it's literally is said to be "a very common way to recruit new player in Serenity server."
---
Then afterward he says that the abuse game mechanisms are "not China's mistake ok?."
---
So in this case, answering his discourse requires to use the same terms.  So yes in this context it has to do with the china players. Just because chinese players are used to abusing the game, does not make it a good thing : it's still an abuse.
---
Mining is the WORST way to make isk in Eve.  Go kill NPC rats
---
Awesome Baldur's Gate SOA reference, have my updoot
---
Dont go to E UNI. The wiki is good, but otherwise..
---
Ugh
---
A new player wont make squat ratting.
---
&gt;welp some ppl dont read books it look like. that book is really good tho :)
---
it's a niche book, doesnt mean they 'dont read books' just because they havent read that one :P
---
Only way to live man. I think honestly eve is the only reason I stayed studious. Cause it gave me something to do while mining
---
These are the questions that need answering above anything else.
---
????
---
Can crabs experience?
---
I havent looked at eve in over 4 years, is the game still a money-pit?
---
Warp2me is shield, i am not affliated with them but bit ofa shameless plug they are good. When i was new to incursion running i joined them they are a really good bunch helpful an willing to give new guys an people looking to make a start in game out.
---
You get my upvote
---
You will get employed. Don't worry about that. Most, if not all, corporations are hungry for new recruits. The game is a real time sink, so think twice before deciding.
---
This makes me sad seeing a blob fight over and lose far more than the value of that Raitaru
---
meh
---
Is the game still a money pit? Like Pay to Win?
---
They were running a Tier 5 Abyssal Filament. Most of which lead to a 3 rooms with a few baddies to kill, and then you go home. You have to kill all the baddies in each room to unlock the portal leading to the next, and leading back home. So they don't usually follow b/c they're all dead.
---
But there was an in-game lore event in which you found the one room where the Triglavians were constructing a mothership in preparation for an invasion. The portal leading home is already open, and they don't follow you back b/c they're too busy amassing troops for the invasion.
---
The trailer showed that they did follow them back this time. By letting the mothership jump through, and then it opened a portal to let everyone else out.
---
This guy is PL and your just a dumb wormholer. What do you know about HACs?
---
The problem in eve is not the skillpoint differential (at least in frigate/cruiser), it's that finding pvp itself takes way too much time. Doubly so if you're not staging from the area you're trying to find fights in.
---
Eg. traveling from jita to bleak lands itself is at least 15 minutes (thanks btw to russians who always camp the gate so you have take a few extra cancer jumps and thanks CCP for making these systems so fucking big you want to kill yourself rather than make a 50 AU jump).
---
You go from kamela-&gt;huola-&gt;siseide-&gt;amamake a few times looking for someone in a plex... you find nobody (or it's something you can't engage since you have literally zero chance of winning). That's another 15 minutes probably.
---
You go sit in a novice plex in kamela for 15 minutes and you get zero fights or you have to warp out because some idiot thinks a T1 vs succubus is good content.
---
You decide to go back to amamake and sit in a plex for 30 minutes with 50 people in local and you get 0 fights because said people in local would rather camp a gate than 1on1.
---
You've now spent like an hour and a half with zero content. It's completely possible to 3h as well tbh. If you die and you're not staging from nearby, you have to jump back to amarr, buy a new ship and jump back to bleak lands which is what... another 14 or so jumps? I guess you could jump to rens as well but then you're probably doubling the price of your pvp which is not great for a newbro.
---
In lowsec at least, extorting ships is still very do-able, as is "helping" the more clueless of tourists in our pristine systems. 
---
Some victims will quickly offer a sum as soon as they realise they're doomed (and are upset to learn their offer is insufficient), and some will be surprisingly good natured about handing money over or losing their ship. It's all quite situational, and entirely your call if you want to offer a ransom or kill them out-of-hand. On that note, please, for the love of Bob, honour the ransoms you've offered: honouring ransoms feeds young pirate families, dishonouring ransoms makes them starve. And if a panicky mission runner just sends you isk without you first offering a ransom, take the ISK as that exchange is not commonly considered a ransom.
---
As for other activities, never forget that lowsec has a reputation for being somewhat scary. If your victim's corp is too wary of going to null, or a WH, then they really should consider moving to low. There are plenty of empty systems where, with due dilligence, it's very feasible to run PVE ops. It just needs care, attention, patience, a friendly hand and local expertise. Mail me in game if you want.
---
Dont take everything people say for granted. Many people have many tastes, and they will try to skew you towards their thing. Also, many people are misinformed or will outright troll you. 
---
Mining is good!
---
Hell naw, ratting is better.
---
Ratting is boring, do exploration in null.
---
That is dangerous, you should be a trader... 
---
Screw trading, join my nullbear corp and feed me taxes. 
---
Yadda Yadda.
---
The Eve UNI wiki is good reading material for starts. Maybe look for some YouTube vids.
---
Try to make some friends and ask them, but take everything with a grain of salt. 
---
Find something you like doing and stick with it.
---
And above all, remember Eve is a PVP game. PvE is only the means to an end. A rather boring but necessary means. PVP is where the fun's at.
---
Tengu is hands down the best for serpentis and guristas lowsec/nullsec.  The damage potential with kinetic HAMs is outrageous - up to 1100 cold with a bling max dps fit and implants.
---
Once you switch off kinetic ammo to EM or thermal for blood raiders or sansha, the loki gets about the same missile damage with every damage type as the tengu does with non-kinetic damage, and then the drone damage will put the loki over the top - looking at around 900 selectable missile damage + 100 faction specific drone damage.
---
Obviously both boats can be fit for max dps alongside a cap stable pith medium or gist large shield booster and high rat-specific resists.  The loki's higher non kinetic dps and resist profile make it better against factions besides guristas and serpentis but the the tengu can definitely run other factions almost as efficiently.
---
I've never used a legion but I imagine you can do a similar deadspace cap stable armor fit.  Achieving equivalent DPS to a loki or tengu may be difficult, and the range/application bonus on the tengu/Loki are really nice.
---
I would never use a proteus except as a last resort.  The maximum dps with railguns or drones is much lower to the tune of 3-400 DPS.  Sites will take far longer to complete.  Tengu or Loki are your best choice depending on which pirates you are facing, followed by a legion with as many low slots devoted to damage as possible.
---
It's not a gang, it's an invading force. In a system where the three bros actually roam for resources. So they are the one invading and find a counter-invading force.
---
The filament that is used to access the abyssal space is not only limited in time, but also limited by who can use it. It creates 3 sequential spaces in the abyss, with each one containing rats that you invade and the gate to the next. The last one allows you to get back to where you activated the filament. In that case the three guys were redirected to an invasion assembly plant, heavily defended, with only ONE space, and had to run for their lives as the defense would overwhelm them unless they have dedicated ships - which is a bad idea because it's very unlikely to reach that one pocket.
---
You are limited how far you can get in regards to skill points (~5.5 million), which take give or take 6 months. You cannot progress beyond that without paying. Staying alpha is okay for casual or undecided players. One you go Omega your time spent online in the game becomes a matter of how much you make per hour in order to sustain that state. Alternatively you can just pay for it.
---
Okay thanks.
---
XD
---
This is the best one yet.
---
These vids are great. 
---
I had already watch them and they are the reason why i didn't quit. And made it to mining. 
---
Without any guide even mining is hard to understand, how and what to do. Most important part i got from him was the career agent's missions, that introduces to some aspects of the game, but gives zero tips on the UI. This UI introduction void is very well put out by this dood on the episodes u linked.
---
Yeah... They also make 20b in one good moon in one night of mining operations, but whatever.
---
I just read a psychopath's stream of consciousness, didn't I?
---
Can crabs?
---
Can't tell you, but I heard we had to "clean" it from time to time ? Does it affect the performance of the ship ?
---
These guys are kind of special. There was no reason for that Loki or the that Devoter to get that close to you. It's like they were trying to ride you like a mechanical bull and got tossed.
---
The wiki is outdated with some stuff.
---
Oops, my bad, I should really read correctly. Leaving the error in my previous post rather than editing.
---
:thumbsup: yea i know. still on their discord. but seems like barely anyone plays. hope youre enjoying yourself and having a good time!
---
It actually represents CCP's final vision for EvE, where players and their risk aversion are finially replaced by massive npc armies constantly battling each other, making EvE a truly environment vs environment game.
---
aGe Of ChAoS
---
YES!!! This needs to happen. Its so annoying to put mining lasers separately every time.
---
Mine is more like "Session change is in progress"
---
&gt;its quite cute you are trying to beat an argument on a technicality.
---
What's that saying about technical correct? Best kind of correct, right? :)
---
Feel free to link any data you based your totally anecdotal statement on though. That's the only way to actually overcome the flaw in your claim.
---
Because nobody knows what Space Russian Emos are thinking
---
its simple, just dont leave the pc
---
How much can one be expected to "pay for it", per month let's say?
---
Ty for almost all good feedback replies.
---
Another question: 
---
I been mining with a Retriever on 0.9 sec. What should be my next ship? should i bet on a Orca? it as 6 freaking high power slots! :=) $$$$$
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6T_dLdFaE
---
Yes
---
£9.99 per month. Well worth it. Don't grind ISK for your monthly sub, it's the worst paying job in the western hemisphere.
---
There is a bunch of ways to play casually, you just need to put work into discovering them.
---
Blackout hurts active subcap krabbing as well. It hurts active mining as well.
---
The problem is not the lack of local. It's everything that was balanced against local is now too powerful. I don't want nerfs but local may be too ingrained into balance structure for the game to balance without it without a nerf.
---
Eve is a second job, in your case its your primair job. So no, you shouldnt be unemployed
---
At the moment the monthly payment is 14.95$. In-game I don't make enough yet to purchase it via the ISK route. I'm new myself :)
---
Your Karmafleet. They would accept you. Karmafleet is very good organized and would help you in your eve journey
---
&gt;Imperium and Legacy are not going to let themselves get singled out. Sure you might call it a blue donut but it's a simple fact that both of us hate panfam more than each other.
---
are you high dude? Both Legacy/FIRE and the CFC individually outnumber the entirety of the groups banding together to fight them. There is no existential crisis here for either of them. 
---
It's simply laughable that the 2nd largest coalition in the game constantly blues the largest one, and cites their comparatively tiny enemies banding together as a valid reason "in the interests of their own self-preservation". Last year Legacy was in a crisis. This year the only crisis is our own complete and total incompetence top to bottom.
---
You been scammed yet?
---
Ah, someone else who gets it. I can lie to my brain that "we were playing video games all night" when really 
---
IT WAS ME, HOMEWORK!
---
Ffs stop mining in staging we cant capital blob if you get tackled wtf
---
I also included in the repo a copy of triexporter with the most recent granny2.dll file if you need to extract your own files.
---
Highsec mining is extremely unprofitable and unbearably boring. I suggest you look into other ISK making activities.
---
Also your missing a cyno. Fit a cyno
---
I'm sure you'd find some link between current events and rats that are in the game for years already.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I must have confused myself thinking this post was referring to new players.  Please continue to tell everyone what you do with your millions of SP across multiple accounts.
---
Yes, they are bugged.
---
Probably not enough people mess with them to be worth fixing.
---
someone game a bullshit what he had a bounty on hes head, He asked me to kill him and split the reward. I didnt fall for that...yet
---
any sugestions that not involve pvp?
---
The range part sounds like a bug to me as well, but the tracking makes sense at that range. The further out, the easier to track. You might want to make a bug report.
---
Ships and modules have to come from somewhere. 
---
Unless you want rifters online?
---
It's just looks.
---
You can clean it though, it's under the skin menu.
---
It’s pretty terrible all around, I mean I had to check to see if eveonion posted this after seeing the suggestion for legion + implants to kill asteroid rats in LS. Just use a destroyer.  Crystals for a cerb? 🤣
---
Application is pretty bad after the Spring patch. Guns will only apply 1/2, missiles only 1/4 against a corax going 0m/s. A Thanatos that would do 18k volley is only going to apply for 6k
---
I hope test steam rolls frat for being dumb with this lmao
---
That's definitely a bug, I have yet to find any other npcs that can hit past 300.
---
Imagine being so bad at pvp that you get hyperdunked into only trying to fight unfit mining barges until you uninstall
---
Gas cloud harvesters as well!
---
Make harder PvE that requires constant decision making. Buffs krabs, nerfs bots.
---
Cloaked rifters online
---
Don’t play
---
For $2.99 USD you can own one as well. [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WCZ9MK8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Can you explain for dumb dumbs like me
---
never bought an injector... dont like them and dont wanna buy them. also not interested in dealing with market stuff anyways even if i had the skills.
---
Hey, thanks for the reply, I’ll message you in game :)
---
That worked so well with carrier ratting. Bots have yet to figure out how to control fighters.
---
I’m beginning to see that.
---
gf gf thx for fight &lt;3
---
Thats my plan after I get nuked
---
How much isk is a lot to you atm?
---
More than him apparently
---
Join a corporation, the beauty of this whole game resolves around the social aspect, wars and things like that. 
---
Also don't train for an Orca, it's a really specific role ship. i.e. a lot of people use an Orca as a mobile station as it can carry a lot of stuff to play a nomad type style living through wormholes. Bigger does not mean better, players who have been playing for 10+ years can still be flying frigates for small scale battles in lowsec for example.
---
Gimme 2 months of plex and i'll stop ratting for 2 days and go out, eat flowers and speak beeish (not some language the hurtful bastards we all know speak)
---
I mean if lowsec is more dangerous than null they should give rewards. Even in the blackout null is safer than low.
---
&gt;Early EU TZ
---
isn't that just AU TZ?
---
If the ads are so top notch, why aren’t you playing? 🤔
---
i bet would not have happened if there was a low sec gate to stain
---
I was farming these back in the day; one shotted my 800 mil stratios :( at like 200k
---
its more intuitive for stupid people
---
tbh, i started with eve in 2008 as a pvp player. I grinded 6 months the boring as fuck missions in high sec to just get decent skillpoints and a decent (100? 200m?) wallet. After that i joined a providence alliance, Cold Steel or something. I would be happy about such opportunities like brave newbies or pandemic horde, which lets you learn and experience the best gameplay what eve has to offer. While i would say, about 2, 4 weeks or more in high sec are a good thing, i am happy about these player alliances. In addition to that, you don't have to worry about your ships - SRP is there.
---
Homeworld is awesome. BTW, did you notice how all FAX hulls are vertical?  They're about the right size to be a mothership analogue, too.
---
wtf
---
You sound like you need therapy. *Lots of it*.
---
I have all 33 besides the 2 not on the market. (dont have the curse or the pilgrim)
---
I would run with the loki, you can get resists across the board at around 89% each, dps at 1040 with rage doing 34km, jav will get you around 740dps at 62km. cap stable perma running ab and booster. I have yet to find a site that can come even close to making me worry in regards to deds/combat sigs etc
---
The only way to not do stupid things is to stay docked. They took fight, made mistakes, got experience. They tried and deserve some respect for it, next time they'll do better.
---
Im online now, USTZ east coast, usually sometime between now and 12 hours from now.  mail works best as I may just hop on and off.
---
probably, the*
---
I think there’s more to this story...
---
While completly safe.
---
strangely enough, my therapist says the same...
---
no i would disagree, the tengu is limited to kinetic damage for the bonus. Yes you can pump out 1100dps which is great but if you want to be able to move regions and still pump out good dps then its the loki everytime which you can still pump out 1040 dps and thats in all damage types
---
Its dumb, if he tries to avoid pvp the orca in hs or rorqual in null is the best.
---
They tried, they got exp.
---
This is much better then not undocking until you have ultimate blob to win)
---
More beautiful than the ad for the detorid bathhouse I saw
---
It is not "pay to win" so much as CCP offers an extended free trial via alpha clones. 
---
EVE Online cost roughly $15 a month for a sub, you can get it cheaper per month if you buy like a 3 month sub etc. 
---
Me personally, the cost is well worth the time.
---
you didnt happen to warp in a loki to try catch him then get popped by the mordu's did you?
---
Your better corpmates are hot garbage for not letting you know.
---
To be fair.. I don't know I've got about 40 million in assets and I just did a 4/10 with a corp mate and got 250m in loot so that split is gonna be good for the wallet
---
Monthly sub?
---
Can't people just buy a lot of ISK and get good gear? All my friends say Eve is pay to win, but maybe they don't know what they're talking about.
---
 sorry only the gnosis (which is junk skin lol)
---
Give me an offer on them.
---
Yk what incursions are?
---
I doubt that would be RMT in CCPs eyes, I mean you don´t get any ingame items or isk for donating. All you get is info.
---
If I failed to notice your sarcasm, just ignore me.
---
&gt; in Eve, can you just hop on game, get some newbie ships, learn things about doing stuff with them, and then actually have chance to not  only be killed and wiped by some experienced vet, but also frag somebody too? 
---
In a word: no.
---
In more words, there are many factors that go into PVP making this situation extremily unlikely for a true new player. The "early game" ships, frigates and destroyers, are perfectly capable of getting kills. Actually I love T1 destroyer fleets, and frigs were fun to fly in faction warfare. But you need to know how to fit your ship somewhat properly, where to go for mostly fair fights, the capabilities of other ships and tactics to use against them, and you need to understand that a solo kill is a somewhat rare occurance in most space. 
---
Not to mention that you need to train your character some skills to effectively fight... a kitey drone ship isn't going to work well if you cant run all 5 drones or fly fast enough for long enough, for example. Progression in eve is mostly passive skill training. Then theres some active money grinding to buy ships, but its not too terribly much for frigates or destroyers. 
---
I know it sounds like a huge barrier to entry, but pvp in eve is extreamily satisfying. Someone you beat was worse than you at something that contributed to that fight and it's a great feeling when you do beat them.
---
&gt;Also, what about fleet battles? Can you participate in them as guest warrior or smth even if you won't join any clans and don't usually have more than 3 hrs per day to play?
---
Sorta. All alliances will want you to be a member to fight in their fleets in important fights. But some may have roams open to the public occasionally. Spectre fleet, bombers bar, and BjornBee (youtuber/streamer) run public fleets. Faction warfare corps and alliances will often invite other members of their militia to fly with them.
---
And tbh, the majority of alliances aren't that strict about how often you get on or for how long. Eve is the biggest collection of late 20s to early 30s men in gaming; most work, have other responsibilities and/or have a family. 3 hours is way more than I can put in most days atm, and it's been fine. But I'd highly... HIGHLY... ***HIGHLY*** recommend joining a casual corp at least, the game is 15 times as fun with friends (new or old) as without. 2 or 20 or 200 ships are always better than 1.
---
I just downloaded it. Want to help me get started? 🤔
---
Yea, let me dm you XD
---
Money doesn't buy skill or experience. If you want to buy a lot of ISK, inject into a flashy ship and lose it within a few hours, be my guest
---
Evemail my name in game. If I'm in known space, I'd love to
---
nope, its yesterday, i didnt google this combat sites unfortunately  
---
curiosity killed the cat..
---
people buy a lot of gear but still have no idea what they're doing and die very quickly
---
Most things in EvE: low risk = low reward.   
---
I suggest you learn how to deal with people trying to kill you early on in your carreer. PvP is an integral part of this game, and most of the time is not concensual. 
---
Doing stuff in highsec will only bore you to death and make you quit the game. Like 90 percent of new players do.  They keep doing their highsec thing **because they know no better**. I know because I was like that when I started as well.  
---
Hands down the best bang for a new player´s buck is doing exploration in null or wormholes. The ships you use are cheap and disposable, you can make a very nice chunk of cash, and most of all, you get into contact with PvP.  
---
With practice you will learn how to avoid getting killed most of the time. Reading up on mechanics, using good fits and making most out of in game and out of game tools is an important part as well.  
---
The best paying activity for a new player that contains no ship PvP is trading, but in order to do that you need a fair amount of market knowledge. And then there´s the market PvP you have to deal with.
---
Thanks for the update EQ, well done with the battle.
---
Yea

Cool story bro
---
usually i do L3 security mission (i enjoy doing simple mission)  
---
but somehow i'm intrigued by some combat sites, should've google this one before warping..  
---
i go for the cargo, then 3 ships came in..  
---
surprise surprise, get warp scrambled, managed to barely beat the 3 ships, then reinforcement came in  
---
i should've expect the next wave and warp before last ships died :o  
---
well, i'm learning something new everyday, good news about insurance (managed to insured it before this)
---
Not sure where I read it, but I believe it was said they got infinite range to simulate drones?
---
He's in a venture.  Nobody is jumping caps to save a venture.
---
How do all you crab haters fund your PVP, asking for a friend
---
I think he meant in null sec fleet combat specifically, where you only need to tank enough to catch reps. Also alpha would be a better metric than dps. And nobody shoot from 100km, usually its 50-70km
---
I do have experience in sov null tho, i've flown there for 2 years
---
Seriously. That’s why I gave up. As soon as you get a sweet fort it becomes cancer to play :(
---
Yeah, Gobbins and Dunk carpooled to our meetup last night.  Lady Scarlett and a Blades of Grass (FRT allied) diplo also attended.  I'll let the conspiracy theorists spin that as they will.
---
Sent you an evemail :)
---
Ayyy Loiso! I've been meaning to ask you about your brawl with synde. Nice job :)
---
the number of provi pilots engaged is false , this br add the reshipping munin fleet  so double the right number.

They did the triglavian invasions are some of the best group pve they've done. They only made it in high sec though same with the abyssal stuff. They left null sec to rot for everything except infrastructure improvements.
---
Only at DT...or patch up dates. Need some sun at least once a day
---
The real reason: FRT started ratting in Etherium Reach and we just couldn't contain ourselves. 
---
What would TAPI do if Goons started ratting in Gilas two gates away from staging?
---
Tech 3 version of the Rifter hull when?
---
What about if they come from miners who are not afk?
---
Yeah those NPC Arbitrators are bugged and have unlimited range. They were hitting me at 12,000km.
---
so you want fair fight,right?
---
In Eve online,Correct?
---
meh CCP doesn't seem agree with you
---
newbie with shiny BB must die.
---
newbie must know that eve online is not for him.
---
no, im saying that you're so bad and are butthurt about getting ass-slammed so hard that you go farm people who can't fight back
---
This question reminds me of UALX when FCs starting telling pilots to load up PI mode in an attempt to reduce server pain. It did not work.
---
Squizz can't take RL cash, but he does take ISK. 5 mil per month and it's ad free.
---
They also made it so that all the loot i s in salvage so randoms can come in and steal 90% of the site value from you in a 300k isk frigate. They were hella fun to do but we gave up pretty quickly because there was 0 reward with people stealing it all.
---
I dont wanna change game or CCP.
---
I just want newbie hurt and survive-or-die.
---
They have infinite tracking.  
---
This causes the tracking formula to breakdown and ignore range.  
---
All NPC's ignore targeting range.   
---
All NPC's will attempt to shoot you 1000km+.  
---
These NPCs will hit you because of infinite tracking.  
---
Other NPCs can hit you, but they won't because it is like 1/10,000,000 at that range.
---
Yeah still engaging and difficult training especially for newer logi
---
You could simply try nullsec exploration in a big Corp or alliance, it's a very good isk making method in terms that it doesn't require many in-game skills to get into and once you get the hang of it you can comfortably make 2+ bill a month, which is plenty for a new player.
---
 Ofc, that said, you need to learn to scan down sites fast and hack them successfully in order to win that much money, but there's plenty of guides for that on youtube
---
It's /r/eve after all :3 I think this won't get squizz in trouble, but CCP could use it as an excuse if they want to nuke zkill fast.

Exploration and buying the occasional CCP bonus pack.
---
I can imagine, they switch targets much more aggressively than sleepers.
---
I dont want impact or change the game.
---
I just want hurt someone and enjoy his frustration.
---
eve online is no game for loser or newbies.
---
I know and CCP knows too.

Through more pvp, whether that's market or ninja looting a field. Or plex, but I haven't had to buy any in good while

Awesome! So say I am totally dumb and don't know what to do now, how would you now use this?
---
If you want to PVP I recommend going to Factional Warfare space where people fight in t1 frigates a lot so the barrier to entry is much lower.

You don't have to join FW to fight people but you'll lose a little bit of sec status if you shoot first https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Security_status
---
If you decide to join it you'll have to leave the current corp but you won't lose security status for PVPing and you'll make a little isk for killing people of the opposite faction and running plexes https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction_warfare
---
Then check out Jebis twitch and YouTube for a visual of what solo PVP looks like https://www.twitch.tv/evelog and https://www.youtube.com/user/EVEJebiVjetar
---
Let me put it this way, you can spend thousands to have a titan pilot on day one, buy a faction titan from someone and outfit it with the best gear in game. And 99 times out of 100, you will likely die in the first few hours if you have 0 clue how to use the titan, how to navigate with it, or even how to tank it properly.
---
Money can buy a lot, but it does not mean an "I win" button. A handful of frigates piloted by pilots who have a ton of experience are often more deadly than a noob who funded his latest ship via Mastercard. 
---
Also, pay to win implies a specific advantage that cannot be gotten without IRL cash. Like gold ammo or the like. Thankfully, that doesn't exist in EVE. 
---
Even if you were to be an omega pilot for say, 6 months and trained well past 5 mil skill points, depending on the skills you trained you can still utilize most of thos points on an alpha. In fact, alphas I believe can utilize up to around 50 mil skill points in total, though any points past the first 5-5.5 mil must either be from being an Omega clone or injected from skill injectors or from the skill point giveaways CCP has been doing.

Goood... you begin to understand. Soon you will discover the way, the truth, and the life...

All bot-aspirants must die!
---
Sounds like someone should visit a doctor.
---
Yeah I was going to recommend that. Have run into a lot of people in game that said his series got them started in the game recently.
---
Im not crazy. I met doctor and he said no to me.
---
Did the same in preparations for my exams. Mining and studying really go well with each other xD
---
Being the one overblobbed isn't particularly wise, though? I mean if literally all the big fights you can fight are capital blobs now, where's the sense? We did kill an INIT Moros last night despite some other caps dropping in to help it. We only retreated after killing it, despite losing two Vindis and a Rattlesnake before it went down. From all I've seen the roams aren't particularly loss-averse, but engaging something you have no chance against doesn't make sense. Also do factor in that a sizeable chunk of these fleets aren't exactly elite PVPers, so 1:1 numbers would already put us at a distinct disadvantage in performance.
---
Psh, some of us still remember (vaguely) the pre-projectile rework guns XD.
---
It is interesting how, ever since, many minmatar hulls have been top tier.  I still remember some of the arguments from back then, (minmatar was the high skill faction, etc).
---
Man, we have come a long way from outflying missiles and people hating on railguns.
---
No it is 0.9 system which behaves like a 1.1. The most dangerous systems are deep in nullsec.
---
I mean, that's like real life. You also have to keep in mind the tribal, "my team" component and the genuine pride some people have for their corp/alliances. The feeling of being part of something bigger and having a purpose, however small, cannot be underestimated. Even in a video game.
---
Reading your post.... you need to google what bots really are.
---
i play every now and again im gettin back into csgo more and more at the minute tho.
---
Then send them to me, I'll quickly double the amount and send it to you right away. IG: 1Donald Trump
---
Both the community and CCP welcome newbros and we have always done so. Loser not at all, so please don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Hello
---
Have a look at our corp public channel ART5. We have mining, pve and pvp fleets daily
---
God I hate it so much that mining is recommended to new players.
---
Go a scanning ship and go exploring. preferably wormholes
---
I mean people where putting Arty on non bonushed ships at various stages in EVEs life span because of how strong the ability to volley opponents off the field was. I'd argue that Minmatar hulls haven't been top tier anymore than any other racial ship.
---
Show me on this doll where the post offended you
---
Sure, add me in game and I'll roam with you.  Or join Horde
---
I'm of average weight and this happens to me sometimes too, I don't think it has anything to do with weight.
---
Shut up retard
---
I'd take the revelation ironblood skin and the tempest blue tiger and nefantar skins for jita buy, pm if interested.
---
Being the first one on the scene in an industrial 😛
---
Fantastically put together. Puts other videos to shame
---
That's ISK though. Since the ads obviously don't pay for the server in ISK form, having a tipping service for actual money to pay for the server's costs could be a good alternative to ads that (as seen here) can cause significant issue and are blocked by a good chunk of the users. :P
---
you and your DeadCo boner ... :)
---
lol what could i expect from a f1 monkey/afk miner!
---
There's a few people here who learnt a lesson about getting into brawl range of a battleship when you don't need to.
---
he's talking about the munnin
---
It's not really about the numbers though.
---
Legacy and Imperium have no strategic interest in fighting each other and have a common enemy. It's really not that hard to figure this out.
---
I know I give him ISK, but it doesn’t save my login on mobile
---
They got baited in thinking it was an ez-kill hole-roller or just got over-confident and then it was too late. It was a good bait job, letting armor sink to the first responder, etc.
---
As Lokley said, they made mistakes, but don't overshadow how great a job was done in selling it.
---
Take my updoot
---
The burning ball of gas in the sky singes me though.
---
For sure. I'm not trying to downplay the masterful bate tanking on display here.
---
Depends on how you'll deal with it. I'm completely addicted. At the same time I work 2 jobs. But my social life and sleep take a massive beating. This game is extremely demanding, and you'll have to figure out where you can make compromises to fit it into your life. For me though, it's worth it.
---
/r/rimworld is leaking.
---
A group of people to help you do your daily quests for sp, trade items like amulets and weapons and armor with. You can partner up with friends who know how to craft very expensive gear, so you can access that gear more cheaply, even if crafting and gathering are not your cup of tea. 
---
You know, like corporations kinda
---
Elite spod munching in some cases.
---
He's definitely not trolling. My corp left legacy because of reasons similar to yours and decided to wormhole for a bit. EVE feels alive and fun again.
---
Was this written by Gary Busey?
---
The sad truth is they could have killed this thing in a garmur.
---
and smartbombs  
---
and space healing modules
---
Me neither, op pls reply!
---
Yeah stands up to quickly and blacks out just like local. Only happened once was a freak accident knocked the tv over on myself. Derp derp derp when I woke up
---
nop, they could waste a lot of time in Garmur, but only chance Garmur got is my internet dropping for like 20-30min.
---
They obviously don’t like you. Kill them harder!
---
there could be a fucking book of bugs about diamond rats which is why i'm excited that even more extra-strength npc's are going to introduced into the game :)
---
god, the more i talk about it the more i'm tempted to just put my hel up on the forums and start selling stuff.  
---
I like null but paps at times just feels like i'm being forced to go on fleet's when i have no interest in doing so / just don't want to that day or month. Being around so many whiner's and people that just make you think "im surround by idiot's" and so many other little thing's yeah it just keeps getting more temping yet i still cant make the decision.
---
Lol at first I misread it and thought it was just meters and was like “I mean, that’s pretty close fan”
---
And then the k registered and I was like “...oh”
---
you would rather not fight just because u might lose some isk?
---
it seems like you're speaking of personal skill based engagements and regardless of most other comments are saying, no, itll take you a long time to do it, not because the combat is particularly deep but because of skill point limitations, the scarcity of grids to actually practice and many other things,
---
anyone can do big fleet combat generally, there are public fleets etc, but dont expect any mechanical challenges from those(as in, unironically just pressing one button many times)
---
if you still wish to try and tough it out i recommend you check out suitonia's youtube channel(eveiseasy).
---
also, keep in mind most people in this sub are completely terrible at the game, and a lot of them unironically hate those that aren't/try not to be. Out of 10 comments 8 are gonna be laughably wrong, if my comment is included in those is up to you to decide really.
---
&gt;Make a bullshit post including your choice of trash-tier memes such as "adapt or die"
---
Holy shit the irony
---
It has to do with protein and iron levels I think. Eating some sunflower seeds always helped me with it
---
When ships jump through and emerge from a gate, are there any general rules about distance and location, relative to the gate?
---
*laughs in AFK Orca*
---
hapey cake day bby
---
The intention is not to brag it's a fucking shit post about a well known eve player being bad and getting ricardoed.
---
Thanks for your comment though :)
---
You live as long as you have cap charges, but the Garmur risks nothing. A BS without mjd cant do much other than get back to the gate or similar.
---
They should at a minimum have five mids so gimping isnt necessary.
---
dont mine in staging you fuckin mongoloid
---
You want the align time on your ship to be less than 2 seconds. So try fitting inertia stabilizers and low friction nozzles. Not all ships can get alignment to below 2 seconds, though. 
---
An alternative is to fly a ship that can use a covert ops cloak. When you emerge on the other side of a gate, hit cloak and warp off.
---
Although Orca has 6 high slots, it isn't able to fit a single Mining Laser or Strip Miner since the hull doesn't have any turret hardpoints...As people mentioned Orca is specialized to boost any other ship in the fleet, while mining pretty meager amount of yield (somewhere equivalent to a venture yield or as much as half yield of your retriever before getting to mastery lvl 2) by itself with mining drones. For mining an Orca only pays out for 3 acc's+ , so if you only use 2 acc stick to mining barges and exhummers instead. As for yield upgrade to retriever check out the exhummers, or switch to covetor. As ppl mentioned mining in highsec is unprofitable, unless your are out for ice which also inclines that you are lucky enough to find a free ice belt without any competion...as for other profitable activities either get into tranglavian (abyss sides) farming or highsec incursions.
---
And yet they are creating the opposite. Players are dropping like flies.
---
Says you I want content :P lol
---
This makes this thread much more understandable
---
if call this broken then take a look on concord first..I still wanna get my hands on instalocking, webbing and infinite pointing across the whole system. oO
---
Rather than having faster response time and any other malicios effects on landing of the criminal anywhere in the system, we have that shitty system that makes me feel like a flee. Yes there are 4 factions players can start with - none of them matters cause concord cheats infinitely in non-subtil way which always makes me thing who is the dog of the game...players or scripted A.I.
---
And smuggle stuff through null in a covops I guess? Is this a guide to becoming poor?
---
Out of curiosity, what are the unused things that used to eat Muninns alive, and why?
---
shut up retard
---
Eve is not pay to win. Experience is vastly more valuable than isk or skill points.
---
If they are worried that i would smartbomb their pod anyways, I will move the smartbomber out of range.

First, bookmark that. Then start reading. The "links for new players" sidebar there is a good place to begin.

You get a slight break for buying multiple months at a time.
---
why you need this? most time you have only 1 or 2 fitted. we aren't in 2007 where you mine in battleship
---
The only death threats (2) I ever got was from market pvp. .01isking or buying out and relisting, it's all deadly. I have yet to get that level of salt in actual pvp.
---
But, by your definition, hunting rorqs or mission runners is pve too... So I guess arguing with you is a bit pointless lol

* Open up excel.
---
* go to the data tab
---
* 'get data' -&gt; 'from other sources' -&gt; 'blank query'
---
* click advanced editor in the query editor which has opened
---
* replace the contents with the gist.
---
* hit done
---
* hit close and load.

you should now have a new sheet (which I'd suggest renaming)

You can now use vlookups to look up the data you want.

(I just realised that vlookup with multiple criteria is a pain in the ass. So I've taken out the split on the first column.)
---
  =VLOOKUP("10000002|34|false",prices!A:J,4,FALSE)

regionid, typeid, buy order (false means sell, true means buy), 4 is the column to return. false makes it an exact match

Ah yes, vasovagal syncoeve.

I’m sure this is meant to be a troll, but it’s so bad my head hurt after reading it. For real I just took 2 Advils and turned the lights off and went to bed. Fuck! My night is ruined.
---
Also, buying a titan, without having friends to back you up, will lead to being dogpiled. Sure, you'll get some kills, but you will die.
---
other NPCs hit you at 1000+ km because wrecking shots always hit.
---
It's cheaper to buy multi-month. :)
---
Look! It's a good example of the lesser spotted asshole!
---
Good luck with that. The TOS for using the API are hard on RL cash.
---
Muninns don't have fantastic kinetic resist - the saturation of popular rail doctrines (proteus, eagles, tengus, megas, even moas) meant that not only did they have lower tank than the other HACS, but they also got ownzoned at 70km by railguns.
---
This was a very fun fleet. Thanks for the fight!

With the ADC module they easilly push closer to 250k, wtf are you talking about? Go back into your wormhole retard

I personally love it when noobs buy skill injectors and tons of shiny shit for their ship with their credit card. 10/10 times they make a really nice killmail very quickly

uncloak and start mining with them

what do you think?

Sweet summer child. Things must seem so simple for you.

remember how hard *you* guys fed on the incident yesterday?

Glassing works.

iOS browsers tend to be the strictest browsers on that sort of thing, so I doubt it's your kit. For instance they tend to hate iframes with a passion: these can be fixed in your browser settings (best google it, I'm in the middle of filling my face and this takes time). 
---
However, the source of this filth is Adsense, and there's next to nothing a downstream site like zkb can do about it. The onus is on Google to fix their act as the publisher (glhf roflmao convincing a cult to fix their ways _always_ works). So if I were you, I'd report the ads to google then bang a few ISK in the general direction of his alt [zkillboard](https://evewho.com/pilot/zKillboard) and problem solved.

I tank 279.7dps sustained. Without cap charges, against uni-dmg(and Garmur does not have uni-dmg, so I'll have more tank with Reactive)
---
Can you please remind me Garmur dps?

But what about the "Goons are bad for the game" and "small alliances can't hold Sov" narratives? I am shocked! Shocked, that people would lie to a poor newbie to further their own goals.

If you are unemployed STAY THE HELL AWAY. If you ever want to get a job, that is.

Unless the job you are looking for is in senior management, business administration, web design, human resources or espionage/counter-espionage in which case play for a few years to get the equivalent experience as from several years in any of the fore-mentioned sectors.

No idea how it would constitute proving what money is used for, but taking RL cash for the payment of hosting costs is explicitly listed in the EULA as an exception to non-commercial/non-profit. The biggest caveat seems to be strictly voluntary, so any "perks" for donating are strictly forbidden.

They're all renters, though, just Goons by a different name.
---
&gt; Looking to sell off some major assets, I have been buying skins as a way of investing extra ISK I had since they started being released
---
That's a really bad investment because skins being released get better and better, so someone can buy these, but they'll pale in comparison and be lesser quality than future skins. This is why savy investors majorly ignored skins baring a few exceptions.
---
I'm sure a % of what you hold is actually good, 80% of that trillion is probably a huge headache and will be hard to sell.
---
Taxes were increased recently. Trading taxes booker fees and such. Significantly.
---
And the skills to remedy the tax - or just these skills? Something like that. Make sure to include this in your xcalculation.
---
You're probably doing business in Jita. Next door there's a Keepstar (big player owned station) in Perimeter xalled "Tranquility Trading Tower". Less taxes and main hub for skill extractors, injectors and such.

What Do you want for the Set from what you have?

lel

but true, i wonder when NCPL will come and ask those groups to pay rent

Oh look, another anti-blackout post written by a Chinese smurf account.
---
but i thought blackout killed any small alliances' hopes and dreams of owning sov.
---
I don't want to lose 15-18 billion isk on a 600 million isk Raitaru. I'll just buy you a new Raitaru. Here you go. Go deploy it wherever you want. Call me when something worth it happens. Until then I'll be small gang roaming taking fights.
---
Judging by all the caps that showed up on directional, they don't approve of this plan.
---
The reason I never did renter corp before is because why not just join one of the big guys?
---
Bro it’s fine you’re flying something cheap that keep returning until they run out of ammo likes real man
---
Renting from who? I know people in some of those groups, they would slit you throat as soon as rent.
---
ok wetard
---
&gt;Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shut down.
---
CCP dumped on the economy and isk faucets and will continue to do so. He's may be right in liquidating for isk now just barely past inflation's absolute peak instead of when it's worth much less isk in the future.
---
The isk might retain value better than the sp

What's wrong with desktop?

My boy com is the lord and saviour of the us tz tdf fleets

Yes. There's an excellent book on the matter by Naval War College prof SCM Paine that I'd highly recommend, [The Wars for Asia, 1911-1949](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107697476/). There's a lot of history in there that most Americans don't know. 
---
A related book from the same author covering some of the same but with a broader focus is [The Japanese Empire: Grand Strategy from the Meiji Restoration to the Pacific War](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107676169/). The latter's a good read for an Eve player because it's a good primer on the whole "what is grand strategy" question that's good for would-be professionals (Naval War College, remember) and interested amateurs alike. I can't recommend both books highly enough, they're simply excellent and cover the material without ever getting bogged down in minutiae.
---
So glad you recognized the show
---
Who are we renting from, I'd love to know.
---
Are you saying a faction officer spawn doesn't have a better chance spawning in npc space compared to player owned space?
---
Why did they change that?
---
( the context here is asteroid belts ) 
---
I don't farm officiers or do this pve - But I've read about it and I had no clue they made that change
---
Same lmao
---
Renters may not be the proper term, but the tldr is goons are letting them live there, essentially they have goons blessing, through backdoor deals or bribes maybe. You're not really an 'independent' if you are scared to cross the bottom line of the big blob next door. Can you mine any moon you please? Can you do what ever you want without a big blob group tell you that you can't? If you answer no to any of those questions, you are not 'independent'.

---
lol, goons are letting you live there. At least acknowledge that goons are being kind to you.
---
We are bigger than some of the smaller allianceses in eve, we set quite a footprint in the region.
---
More narrative then. There are alliances there that would not answer to goons or Panfam.
---
Gold magnate, c6 blackhole, 85km/s set up boost alts every  5000km or so and use it when in range, then send it to next spot
---
Lets be honest here and accept reality. If any powerful sov group saw a powerful enemy live next to them, they would evict them very quickly if possible with how null always has been. Or at the very least would be in conflict. In this case, goons don't give a fuck about these groups because they don't cross their bottom line. If they did, they wouldn't be there. 
---
Just be happy you're not large and/or competent enough to be given the ultimatum of join us or die by goons.

Thanks goons!

Ooo ... very non-PC. But me like.

Goons really gotta step up their narrative game, can't even agree on one anymore

Goons just simply dont give a shit about that space, it's too far away from Delve. By your logic anyone would have to thank goons because they could steamroll anyone they want to.
---
feed to save the supers
---
you realize SNUFF and Pen Is Out has sov on that map right?
---
This is next to goon/imperium territory and within their realm of influence. It would take no effort from goons to glass this region if they felt like it. Of course they don't give a shit, why would a human care about the ant below them? The same thing applies here, that region is shit to goons. If it was worth anything, they would expand their influence. This goes to ALL of the big null sov blobs.
---
Except that Euro farmer guy who yells at everyone
---
SNUFF nor Pen would cross the imperium's bottom line. Everyone else there is of no importance to the imperium.
---
What you're looking at here is the north of the map, delve is in the southwest.

[Humans are terrible multitaskers.](https://fortune.com/2016/12/07/why-you-shouldnt-multitask/)  
---
MIT concluded a deep study into our collective ability to multi-task, and found a perhaps surprising outcome:   
---
We are less efficient the more tasks we try to simultaneously do.  
---
Why am I introducing my comment like I'm about to drop the most cringe sweatpost of all time?   
---
Because I was just like you when going for my masters. I hated doing homework. Looked at it like a chore that I should put off; something required but definitely not relished.  
---
I struggled for all of my undergrad and most of my graduate journey with trying to "game" my homework. This was a common thing I would attempt to do: Find some semi-afkable type of activity in the game I was currently nolifing, and try to do my homework while simultaneously attending to my semi-afkable activity.  
---
Seemed simple, right? Only that I found myself having to send 2x, maybe even 4x more time doing the chore I loathed - which was the problems and activities required of my homework and studies - than if I would have just sat down and powered it out.  
---
There is INSANE amounts of value in us doing one activity with 100% focus.   
---
I hope you see my comment is in good intentions. I'm just trying to share my experiences of my own journey - specifically what I tried and ended up backfiring on me - so that perhaps it may help you, or others in similar situation, somewhere down the line. &lt;3
---
Where's your overview my dude?
---
Uhm, the only supers on field were hostile to you on that one...
---
and also close to panfam, ever heard of a buffer zone?
---
I wasnt sure of the mechanics of the way the data is downloaded on different settings. So running in potato mode was just a precaution. Plus my laptop is 7 years old so potato mode is kinda necessary
---
oh shit thought you were talking about the cap feed trying to save rus supers. my bad
---
You are a god thank you.  Now can I possibly do a vlookup from a typeId sheet?  For example, if I type in a name in Colum A they typeID will fill in Colum B and then I can use that to vlookup into the prices sheet itself? If not no worries this will still help a ton.
---
wow goons truly are a blessing to this game with their giant blue donut
---
You are free to your opinion, but it is just that, an opinion and a wrong one at that.  Proof is in the pudding for me.  Just as an example, last time I invested in my skin stock I spent maybe 10 B, I have recouped that at least twice over from that purchase and have well over 200 Billion left to sell... I am not too worried about what you think :) and I am not worried about having to wait a month or two to sell skins that are 5-15 b.
---
Damn that was fast, nice
---
Oh thats cool I'll try that when I am more prepared, if you want senda me your ingame name fellow pirate.
---
Ahoy!
---
My bad, the for-sure align time for cloak trick is (within 10s align time), which assumes MWD+cloak speed equals non-prop speed (when it should be more).
---
Mathematically speaking it depends on the mwd speed boost which depends on ship mass.
---
These are the kinds of video's I visit this sub for everyday. Fantastic work.
---
Braxus was right, wormholers are retarded
---
They have space in in Branch dude
---
Looks like it's going to be an interesting bit of space to live in.
---
Thats why they all joined IGC Mango and LBFB right?
---
all you mfs sitting here arguing over which way a pair of pants would go on a titan. bitch my alpha ass is sitting here in my cormorant crying 😭
---
Yes, I bought them too
---
I do not sorry.
---
This guy has your answer OP. You gotta find what satisfies you in particular, once you find that the rest will come much easier.
---
I was one of the first to die to the TEST munininnnin camp so I had a head start
---
The only thing good about mining is when you realize how much more fun/profitable everything else is and uninject any single SP you put into that horrible profession.
---
Rifters online sounds cool tbh
---
Good work dude. Nice video as usual.
---
also all the skins I bought I like, so whatever doesnt sell, i am more then happy to apply... in fact I bought them all over the years expecting to apply them to my characters, but never clicked apply... i have a total of maybe 5 skins applied, but once the value went over 500 billion, i just started trading in extras and buying more rare ones I didn't have.
---
calling someone a "renter" implies they paid/are paying for what they have, which in this case is a complete misrepresentation of what is going on there.
---
Kinda wish 1/4 of the screen wasnt taken up by the BL logo but nice video regardless.
---
&gt;It would take no effort from goons to glass this region if they felt like it.
---
we already did that, time to let the new forest grow in to replace the rotting dead wood that used to live there.
---
7.5b?
---
Hot to keep up Them adm's
---
"still"?
---
Its a monthly subscription game.
---
Technically, you can pay money to get ingame money, so if you treat it like a money pit it'll be one, but when has EvE ever been a money pit?
---
Interesting
---
lol ‘glad’ others are having the issue. I’m kidding, I know what you mean. 
---
So same here:
---
iPhone 6S
---
Ios 12.3.1
---
Safari
---
Got the same pop from a BR someone linked on Discord. Also if I went directly to Safari and loaded zkillboard it would pop after a few seconds. Cleared my cache and it did not come back, unless I clicked the BR in Discord again. Cleared cache again. It has stopped and I can go to zkill as normal. I haven’t tried clicking the BR again though.
---
Also note it did not occur if I went to zkill using chrome (iPhone).
---
cloak trick, use stats to figure out where gatecamps are to avoid camp, crash gate, have scouts...
---
working pricing out, maybe negotiable. looking like sell value for the skins is around 80 billion if I am not mistaken, message Dankcheese in game and we can work out a price if you are interested in all of them.
---
Curious about applying old ones to current omega. I noticed someone selling collectors edition codes...
---
12 km around the gate, but no exact location
---
wow bill
---
On the flip side, there's a lot of inflation in Eve, so it's quite possible prices will rise.
---
So you need to drop shitarus to get fights these days? Instead of just RFing an ihub or showing up with a fleet and goading them to undock?
---
They boost your income by 30-50%, worth it or not, depending on yourself
---
You can :) you just assemble the string, with &amp;
---
Yeah you can disband that shit blob now. Thanks
---
Who are you talking to? Lol
---
Can't forget the gas cloud harvesters.
---
Wait, people used to mine in battleships!?
---
That's freaking awesome!
---
Solo them.
---
I agree. Maybe it's not such a big deal for one person, but if you multiply the time lost among the entire player base it probably adds up to quite a lot.
---
Just add 1 assault launcher to your gila (better missile range), bring a mtu , easy profit :D
---
How did you not die from the time dilation?
---
For serpentis 10/10 you want a tengu if youre gonna solo it, but you need max range skills and about 2.5bil+ its good isk though.
---
&gt; Can you mine any moon you please? Can you do what ever you want without a big blob group tell you that you can't?
---
Yes and yes.
---
IIRC back in the day it didn't work with retail codes, you had to buy a subscription directly to get buddy program rewards.
---
It depends how quickly you're clearing the sites. 
---
If you don't routinely have plenty of time to spare, do NOT waste time in site 1 sat by an MTU to get the nodes. Multiple battleship spawns when the clock is running out isn't fun. 
---
I usually judge by the time I have left. If it's the final site I get em all.

He's not a wormholer. He's in BOT.
---
Oh the irony.
---
And here I thought this place didn't care if you inject into a T3, and caps were the only problem.
---
You probably found a ghost site, where you have a very small amount of time to hack the cans or NPCs spawn and start killing everything, plus if you fail the hack, the can explodes. 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites
---
Feroxes?
---
Yeah, that main idiot is in BOT. He can be rightfully ignored.
---
Not at my comp atm, but I would love the Ghostbird Kestrel and Condor skins.  I was trying to figure out what the price was, but I'm on my phone and the page isn't loading right for me
---
Check out the "recruit a friend" page for details. You'll get the accelerators and gametime when your recruit buys Omega time (gametime reward) or plex (accel reward) from the ccp website. There are also rewards for x referrals upgraded to Omega, and these will count upgrades to omega by any means.
---
That'd be amazing. 
---
Covetor should get the highest DPS cause it's paper thin, proc gets the lowest.
---
Yeah sorry , I went pub instead , rain check ?
---
Then why do people still cry about Rorqs?
---
Agreed. Have no idea why people are using it so much. Especially shit on mobile

Can someone post a link to that ad? Youtube is bugged on my PC for *some* reason and doesn't display ads.

Tedious. Definitely.

As evidenced by the people endorsing recent changes that rely upon spamming dscan. Anyone can do it. It's just most people would rather play something that won't cause carpal tunnel.

I'm pretty sure my cat would know a Futurama quote *that* obvious

Lmao, not seen anyone in armour when I've flown with em.

But no they're shield based.

For me it works just fine, may i suggest you to use an addblocker?

This basically.

Best people to fly with to learn basic fleet mechanics and make some isk as a new player.

I too, want to go home via pod express.

here is what nullsec looks like

https://imgur.com/a/wwK53hj

I get a redirect and maybe once out of every 20 zkill pages
---
And it's not Squizz's fault, at all. It's Google's fault for not vetting ads properly, complain to them.
---
Have you tried the zkill mobile app?
---
It's called orthostatic hypotension. Blood pressure drops too quickly when standing (thanks gravity) and you pass out. It's pretty common.
---
It's not new. It's been like that for at least a year. I use an ad blocker/script killer though so I never deal with them. Have you tried the zkill mobile app?
---
Eve is not pay to win by any stretch of imagination.
---
You can get good "gear" (ships and modules for them) by donating, which would make your ship stronger than cheaply-outfitted equivalent, sure.
---
However, that does not give you an absolute advantage, and you're still going to die if you don't fly your ship very well (to be honest, you're likely eventually going to die even if you do) or if you find yourself outnumbered, which is easy in Eve.
---
Hell, sometimes flying an expensive ship is more dangerous than a cheap one - in so-called high security zones, if you get attacked and are not a criminal, your attacker always gets destroyed. But if the potential gain from looting your shipwreck is high, you can easily find people suiciding a couple of cheap ships to murder you in one big hit.
---
There's a famous saying in Eve: "don't fly what you cannot afford to lose." I feel it represents the game very well.
---
It's brilliant! I bet you could make hundreds of thousands a night! Why did you let us plebeians in on your one easy trick to wealth.
---
Quick, kill local to get rid of this bot!
---
Lmao when I was new I tried to kill an NPC mining ship or hauler or something cause I saw its bounty and thought it'd be a nice way to get space rich. 
---
Needless to say moa got **absolutely fucked** by the response fleet, I didn't even know what was happening. Good times

This thread is literally triggering me.

You’d be better off buying plex with the electricity cost of running your PC all night lmao

How tf does google ads allow alert?
---
No is it on IOS?
---
apparently I dont have the kestrel, and the condor is one of the best condor skins, and only one on market is 1.5 billion, i know that seems high, but scarcity drives prices.  I wouldn't wanna let my 1 copy go for less then 20% off that price, so would still be 1.2 bil, maybe too pricey for a tech 1 frig skin, but i don't mind keeping it either, sorry. hope this works for you.  all the tech 1 frigs are over 1 bil and seems very limited stock or else someone else would be putting em down and beating the prices... also, not really looking to deal with something less then 5 billion at a time, not worth it really to me, sorry.
---
Nope, they're in PvP fit faction/tech 2 ships. Possible bling and definitely much higher skills than yours.
---
You were woefully outmatched by a single one of them. Don't feel bad, they jumped you like that because they wanted a guaranteed kill, not a fight.
---
No I actually didnt know they had one. Trying it now it seems identical to the browser version. I'll have to start using that. I still dont understand why they allow those kind of ads on their browser version.
---
Why. If you dont want to play the game just dont?
---
And if you need isk, jesus christ I cant think of a way to make less isk than that, which is pretty impressive
---
^ Solid advice. Someone should do the maths.
---
"Would you kindly unblock ads?"
---
AFK krav can still show up to other fleets and make decisions. F1 Monkeys are no different from bots. Change my mind.
---
Exactly. Also why do people assume any kind of ratting is AFK?
---
When I used a VNI, it was never AFK cause I didn't want to fucking die. I saw the AFK players losing one every few days. I eventually upgraded to a rattle. That (you guessed it) wasn't AFK either. Finally I moved on to a carrier. 
---
Is it time to AFK now or..?
---
Just wait. Someone will whine to their sugardaddy that someone was mean to them, then the fun will be over. It never fails.
---
Lol imagine being in BOT.

Did you like miss the part where Snuff has been anchoring 0 tax structures specifically to mess with TAPIRIUM LEGION's tax income?

Or the part where Snuff + friends hunt/dread bomb in Delve whenever they're bored?

Eve is not for everybody. If you get killed/ganked as a newbie you gotta do something or play a different game. Ive been playing since 2018 and I know the feeling. Adapt or get shit on.

yes lmfao

An effective anti cheat measure would also nerf bots, but it seems like nobody wants one of these.

Also, charge your battery.

at least take me out to dinner first before you call me dirty names

You only end up salvaging the wrecks from the last 2 hours. Also, you can make that much isk in about 5 minutes in Nullsec.

Wrecks despawn after 2 hours and at downtime, so you're only going to get bounties. Like someone else said, you may as well turn your PC and buy PLEX with the money you would save on electricity.

Yeah. But there most definitely is money. Just hang out with people who have a good 0.5 Athanor schedule. Put it on the biggest Arkonor rock you can find while you're at work or asleep.

If website owners pulled the ads off their platform until the malicious ad problem was solved google would solve it right quick. Instead they throw their hands up and go "nothing we can do about it" until google lazaly fixes it.

By all means tho keep it up i make money from fixing computers fucked up by malicious ads. Each one fucked up by your apathy is money in my pocket.

Link tutorial
---
Mining Lasers or Strip Miners should never be grouped. Two separate rocks per vessel is ideal to maximize yield. It will ensure the most amount of cycles to complete per mining laser.
---
Also take note of your cycles and make sure your second laser/strip miner starts when your first cycle is at half the time needed to complete (with max porpoise buffs at 37/38 seconds). This will give you more time to move the ore from the ore hold to hauler/container/foreman. 
---
When you "group" your mining lasers onto a single rock and have them synced up eventually a cycle to two cycles will be wasted. Instead of 1400/1600 a cycle every 37/38 seconds, it would mean 2800/3200 every 74.5 seconds. You'll have ore hold filling up more frequently and more chances to waste cycles if they were synced up. Just takes one distraction to get a miner and all his alts jacked up.
---
The idea is to have one laser per rock to get the most amount of cycles completed without having your ore holds max out before emptying them. Run with buffs or you're wasting your time.
---
I found the ts mute button. But I can't mute fc when he decides to engage desktop
---
Kool, it's not like I could waste my life on worse things
---
CCP needs to embrace creative destruction more.
---
I usually will go collect them while I'm killing the rats but I won't stay after they are dead.
---
You’re kind of rude
---
Everything in the game can be earned through playing and accumulating ISK (ingame currency). Paying RL money is more for convenience.

The point is twitch streams and YouTube videos.

Hate to say it and this comment will probably get downvoted into oblivion, but just quit. Don't waste your time on this game when you're not willing to team up with others and be prepared to dig through all the overwhelming mechanics and figure them out.
---
You will just end up spending your time solo in a miserable mining Venture in high security space, grinding forever, without having any fun.
---
Who shit in your cornflakes?

Yeah I don't see the downside.

Your cat is cooler than most people

shut the fuck up krab

Have the headhunter, the caldari union, the oragne octopus, and ghostbird as more rare ones.  Also have steel cardinal, wiyrkomi, hunter's quiver, and cryptic mimesis but those are all cheap and could get on market.  I would sell the headhunter and caldari union, the octopus isnt gonna make me any isk so I would just tell you to get it on the market if you want it, and same with ghostbird and others. msg me in game Dankcheese if you are interested in the headhunter or caldari union skins though
---
Take your pick, if I was an alpha and didn't want to subscribe with irl isk I would probably do high-sec incursions, you can make a a shitty incursion alt with the alpha restrictions and it's pretty decent ISK per hour for a high-sec activitiy.
---
It is sad that many won't be able to see a fleet in action because of the bloodthirsty that will kill a pod or shuttle that just come to explore, to bad shuttles are not immune to PVP.
---
I like my old Gila with 125 bandwidth and 400 drone bay
---
Please please never install anything in a root directory.   Applications should be self contained in their own directory.
---
One's literally a rag
---
There's another saying I heard in Eve: "if you ever find yourself in a fair fight, both sides have already fucked up". You can spend literally hundreds of dollars to get the most obscenely well fit ship and still die in your first fight.
---
It entirely depends.
---
Technically income is higher if you ignore and blitz, as you can squeeze in an additional site per hour if you're in a good ship.
---
But if you're not going for Isk/hr, but doing, say, 5 sites a day, they're worth it.  I'd say they boost the isk yield by about 15%-30%, with very high variation.  Sometimes you get 15 mil from one, sometimes you get 300k isk.  
---
You do need to be doing the sites quickly enough to warrant it, so it requires a more pricey ship.  If you're in a Gila, for example, you'll need to offset the DPS loss of equipping an assault launcher (to get at the far ones more efficiently).  You also need to know when to say "Fuck that last one" and move on.  Some of the cans are 80km from the gate and you're hit with a wave of blinding/tangling slowing your ability to get at them.  
---
This is all based on T5s, as they're the only runs I run.
---
easy there gevlon
---
What do you mean?
---
Karttoon would approve
---
what about a kilt
---
Truthfully? 
---
Botting.
---
Ships show up at a certain distance away from the gate at a random location in a sphere around it. The distance depends on the gate; regional gates have a larger radius, for example.
---
No, it hasn’t.
---
take your updoot
---
Why don’t you go do something useful like gargling bleach.
---
so true
---
Don't even worry about it. Bounty is paid out as a percentage of the ships value, and doesn't give rights to attack you in high/low sec. Also 100k is not worth anyone's time.

For a long whle now when I visit zkill I get the popup to please disable adblocker. Idisable and I still get it using firefox. Not sure why.

Wait maybe i did c:eve thing maybe, am I safe if i did?
---
Train for a super for your PVE, and you're stuck in nullsec, maybe even stuck ratting as one more faceless body in a bloc. For someone who is currently ratting in a Rupture (i.e. they're a newbie) this is really bad advice. Now is not the time for the questioner to start training their main into a super.
---
Fuckin.... Well played. Ugh
---
A job or if you are living in a relatively lower wage country just stay alpha. If you cant fly a super or sth grinding isk for plex is pretty ridiculous
---
You could do the "l33t h4x0r epiccc pc pr0" method and that is to find where the launcher and cache files are, select them and Shift+Delete
---
Maybe go poke around in appdata, there's probably also some eve files.
---
Something wrong with it?
---
I have a file in C:\ that is named EVE, does that mean I installed it safely?
---
Oh, just join CODE of you wanna gank people, they can probably help you out

Your 1% battery gives me anxiety

I just bought 4 injectors and have contracting skills, does that make you happy? also got broker relations 5, and accounting 5 and some other shit to 3s... saving an extra 1% on market transactions or so it looks like, now if i sell of 350billion on market i can recoup those losses :/

Bubble bursting or less bots to plex cause profit is garbage?
---
It's part of blackout, lose your isk lose your money
---
Run the career and then security missions till you get a bit of cash. That'll pay for your ships, whether you want to do more mining, exploration, or work your way up to l4 security missions (fairly profitable) or incursions with a fleet (very good profit for high sec). 
---
Can even try station trading, but that's harder now due to the tax increase.
---
Incursions :) Takes a bit to save up but once you're in its good money.
---
You're doing something very wrong if you've got 60 bombers against 200 muninns and the bombers are the ones who die.

Come on over to the dark side, we'll show you how it's done.

Great news is it's just wasted space that CCP built up in code and no one cares.

Ads are REALLY complicated beasts. An entire website embedded in an iframe. I would assume it just isnt possible to prevent them completely without some low level javascript API tweaks.

That's awesome

You're going to be fine, just play like normal. That bounty is tiny as hell.
---
He's one of the worst spodbrains on r/eve. This is just how he is.

Crystal clear. Think there are two discussions going on though, one about them being garbage (not really, just underestimated you) and them not just showing up with 10 T3s and Logi Support x6 (good on them for just having a fun fight).

no u
---
I read that YEARS ago and I don't get the quote.
---
I am so sorry but I cannot figure out how to combine.  I am obviously looking up the wrong thing.  I tried doing a nested vlookup like this :=VLOOKUP(VLOOKUP(A30,TypeID!$B:$C,2,FALSE),Prices!A:J,4,FALSE) but obviously this doesn't have the region id which I can't figure out how to push it through.
---
idk, you make probably the easiest and safest isk in the game, you can oneshot most subcaps while pointing them from 200km away. Not seeing the downside for training into a super tbh
---
Totally killed our hopes fam. rekt
---
Lol
---
But why on earth would anyone bring a keres and stay under 25km range.
---
Like ok nice vid and all. But if they had a little bit of respect for their fleet comp you should have never killed anyone unless your drones had managed to put pressure on the keres.
---
Only for a nullbloc spodbrain.
---
tbh c5 space is pretty much nullsec renters
---
I would assume it is safe. I can't say for sure though
---
Ok, well thanks

Sadly very accurate post.

in my old age i've gotten started working on things ive never really messed with in eve.  i started experimenting with abyssals and once i got those down i moved on to different things that peaked my curiosity, npc mining spawns being the latest.  one more thing off the list and will be looking for the next one soon.  thinking.....those ridiculous faction mining sites but i cant remember the name...only that the LP store stuff is laughable.  no one does those either i think...

Most see a bounty as a badge of honour, it means you've achieved the rank of pissed someone off enough for them to spend isk.

Really?  You were infuriated by limitations on a free character in a subscription game?

Something that others haven't mentioned is that whatever you equip to your ship will be lost to you if your ship explodes*.

That is why skill greatly outstrips a wallet. The only thing a large wallet does for a player is allow them to make a lot of mistakes quickly. Which may accelerate the learning curve, but it often doesn't seem to work that way. When your ship is worthless to you, you have less need to learn from your mistakes.

Occasionally when a new or awful pilot is known to put expensive mods on their ships they will hunted by people looking for a loot piñata. If you happen to become one of those players, money definitely does not buy winning, rather a constant stream of losses that the community delights in.

* when your ship dies, every mod equipped and held in cargo has a 50% chance to drop. Where it can be looted by other players. If your side wins the fight, you may get your equipment back and share in the loot from the dead hostiles as well.
