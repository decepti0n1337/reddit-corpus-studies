Lorde and bog rock. What are you talking about?
---
---
---
Not looking for parity.  The nerf bat is coming again in some fashion.   listen to ccp messaging about isk supply when they did the last round of nerfs.
---

---
The issue with the ratting isk faucet overload is coming from null sec (per the MER), and a big part of that is the supers that can, whether legit or bot, make a lot of isk.
---
This is a method of targeting the caps to a greater degree than the subcaps.  As one part of a larger strategy a scaling bounty system is a viable idea.
---
When the nerf comes, it would be nice if it was nuanced and tailored to affect the largest contributors of isk supply production to a greater degree than the small time contributors (in addition to hitting bots).
---
A dirty Stratios with 19 killmarks is sexy af.
---
Besides the whole fighter-catapult thing being opened up as a possible means to RF their cit, it does cause other issues. AS already mentioned elsewhere, you will tend to lose cynos, there could be drag bubbles as well killing stuff. Any stragglers will die.
---
Big ships could also be in danger, having a fort right in your face means that if a big ship lands on your staging and fails to dock right away, a hictor could point it to prevent docking in that 30 second no-tether space and then a couple dreads pop over and kill it. A dread, depending on skill, can kill a JF in 50-70 seconds and costs 1/5 the JF value assuming the jf is empty.
---
It is just an all-around issue with constant sniping, nitpicking, and every now and then big hits.

---
cap stability in simulations is measured in cap/s in vs cap/s out
---
in game, spending cap can take you below peak cap regen, leading to functional instability even when peak cap/s says you have enough. because you aren't always regenerating at peak
---
this is why you test on sisi if it's close

" Besides the whole fighter-catapult thing being opened up as a possible means to RF their cit, "  
---
You seemed to have missed the entire point of the OP's post. The issue is not what "tactics do I use" but rather "I don't have anyone online when their assets are vulnerable." There is no point putting up a staging citadel next to their station if there is never going to be anyone online during the venerability window to actually make use of it....
---
I do miss the fact that POS towers used the SAME ammo as player guns, and they had different gun types.

It was copy pasted, that was the intent. I got the assets from Google, and I believe that all of them were off of the Uni Wiki, I just am not sure. I am new to Eve and I was asked to make a promotional ad for a class, so I wanted to do something stupid but in the vain of Eve for my project.
---
I would like to join this circle jerk plz.
---
You are a fucking JOKE if you really think that...We are craving for "meaningful engagement" that's the only reason I play this game. That's not just a NC thing it's a fact shared by all PVPers in Eve ! Every PVPers would rather win a fight that was close and challenging rather than pressing F1 on an empty structure. 
---
If your leadership actualy cared for you, you would have come with half your number and it would have been an awesome moment for everyone.
---
Instead of that your leadership decided to fight us 10v1 just in case 7v1 was too close for them and you brainless sheep are like " THey'Re GOiNg To Do WHaTeVER THeY CaN TO NoT GIvE ANy MEANingFuL ENgaGeMenT"

Enjoy F1 some KS I'm sure they will gives you some awesome fights, thanks your leadership later.
---
My money is on 2 days 13 hours
---
50% for most expensive moons(R64) and I live in lowsec.
---
Now that one is pretty good.
---
Well considering it was meant to be a copy pasted project for a non-photoshop clasd made in 45ish minutes, I wouldn't feel too bad.
---
Because hes the military director and he sucks at his job
---
That is actually a sick burn.
---
Yes, and i assumed this was the real world, not some made-up strawman fantasy of absolutes.
---
You don't have 0 people online in a given timezone, you have far fewer people. There will always be some willing to alarm clock or otherwise available in off hours, even if the majority are not.
---
Having a fort on their staging grid opens up options and if you couldn't get enough to outright kill their staging, maybe with your enhanced position of having the fort on their staging grid your fewer people in their TZ can pull it off.
---
The fort in their staging's face opens up options that maybe you can take advantage of, even if they are TZ tanked. TZ tank is not an absolute defense, it can be worked around, although painfully.
---
ITT: Dumbasses falling for obvious flair baiting
---
You want to fix risk/reward in nullsec.
---
Reward nerf is not the answer. If you keep nerfing the reward you make another hisec with low risk low reward.
---
Risk buff is the answer. High risk high reward is what nullsec is supposed to be.
---
: ^ )
---
You sure sound like one so if he did he wouldn't be wrong.
---
Isn't the whole point of wormhole to be more scary and dangerous than Null? 
---
Nowadays thanks to citadels. it's Low risk/high reward
---
I actually enjoyed setting up my space town ^_^
---
And in this example the defenders active in the TZ their fort is set to, so just having a few people won't get you anything as they are going to be fighting with a numerical advantage in addition to fighting on their own citadel grid, so short of them being renters who can't fight or your group repeatedly alarm clocking for all 3 timers that citadel is an annoyance at best.
---
lol you brainwashed liberal nazi are sad and weak.... just like the goon
---
citadels are shit, and asset safety in player owned structures that are supposed to be able to be destroyed is shit
---
Was "and such" too hard for you to understand or do you need it in a big neon tattoo on your forehead?

"while idiots in our own fleet continue to shoot it"

  Haha oh boy
---
The danger level hasnt changed at all. Only the ease of inventory space and ship docking space on a member level.
---
Sound like what? Finish your sentence? I mean you guys win "a fair fight" outside of CN TZ and celebrate like if you won the lottery.... :)

He has been having "dramatic life changes" for a decade, its probably all bullshit.

Quite a lot of internet in West Aus was faulty yesterday. That is probably related.
---
Super nice to know the logo I designed all those years ago lives on in memes and can be recognized by like 8 pixels
---
what does this have to do with mindlinks
---
3 questions. 
---
1 have you ratted in a super?
---
2 how long have you been a super cap pilot? 
---
3 how many VNI alts runnkng afk at once do you think makes the same ticks as a super
---
It's still crap yeah. I know.
---
You could have at least put some effort in, dude. If I was your teacher this would get *maybe* a 60% if you're anywhere above kindergarten. Your background image is garbage and makes no sense, stretched and compressed to impossibly as though you don't know what the crop tool does. The colours on the lettering are absolutely garbage and it looks like you used the default font in whatever crappy program you used to make this. The perspective is completely fucked as well.     
---
Overall it doesn't look like a project you made in 45 minutes, it looks like something you half-assed in two to five. You put absolutely no effort into this whatsoever.
---
If your group isn't enough of a power to turn a fort off their staging into a threat, the group wasn't dangerous in any TZ.
---
no they're all retards who have no idea what they're doing
---
And the background, what looks like the first Google result for "eve online spaceship battle wallpaper" stretched obscenely to match this horrid resolution.      
---
This is what happens when we teach our children that every thing they do is perfect.
---
I put effort into getting rid of the background on the images I brought in.
---
I have also never touched Photoshop before this project.
---
I'm being honest with this question here: Why did you even post this?
---
Fuzzy Select doesn't equal effort.
---
Because I felt like sharing the first thing I made an attempt at. Even though I didn't have a single clue what I was doing I wanted to share something I cared about doing.
---
Wasn't fuzzy select. Nor magic wand. Used anchor points with the pen tool and then went back in after and used the eraser tool
---
Glad you enjoyed :)

???? that's like saying panfam and HRE are together
---
All of these projects that CCP were working on in the past were there only for making a good looking buyout. None of them were done for a serious game (wonder why they all failed?). I am curious on how this next project goes.
---
I mean... In wormhole space your assets don't magically appear in a safe zone so I'd say the risk/reward is still the same.
---
Yes, super and titan ratting
---

Guesstimate that 3 truly afk style VNIs can match an avg super ratter.

Happy cake day

ah, beat me to it.

Of all the problems to solve, I just wished they spent the time on a bigger one.
---
And bingo you figured out why plex keeps going up
---
Yes they were.
---
That is a risky move. Much like stocking up on tech 2 ammo for the change to faction turrets
---
But does it have sound?
---
is there any thread about this new torunament format? I found it pretty nice
---
Which one, super capital proliferation? Or faction warfare? What about Low sec? Isk faucet?
---
All problems big AND small should be addressed. Fuck off with this high horse of yours
---
Yep. Can't get bogged down by things like logic or reason if you want to make propaganda.
---
What happened on September 11, 2001?
---
Did they let you have cushions in prison or just nutra-loaf?
---
i updooted even though right now a slasher will probably manage to force a rorqual fleet and a ratting super to self destruct
---
It does hide it from the NC. killboard, so it probably does. PanFam players always have zkill front-and-center on their primary screen, with the actual game just a small window to the side like the minor inconvenience it is.
---
Would love to have that feature in Eve.
---
They don't understand the story behind a kill is what matters. Smh.
---
Enjoying the game and you? Besides down voting people that comment anything on TEST posts? lol
---
Yes! 880 vs 550 it‚Äôs fair fight.
---
The OP is actually saying that Unspoken Alliance is allied with The Imperium, not NCPL.
---
Are you ratting in a wyvern without dmg mods and t1 fighters or something?...
---
You know in doing this they should add the vni to have 4 heavy drones instead of 5.
---
Let the down vote begin.
---
All you can do is your own personal best

adding on to what others say, if you DO run the missions for LP... it's more profitable to buy and sell orthruses/garmurs.
---
How are those close and challenging fights against the braindead that rorqs still trying to mine?(lmbo)
---
Goons are all multiboxing rorq and super botters right? That's a pretty fearsome force, no? Nah lol we fucking suck at this game. Goons are the shittiest pvpers alive, so I don't really understand running away from a potential fight.  We're all braindead money children; you're telling me you couldn't take on 10 braindead monkey children by yourself? It'd probably be a fair fight.

General Advice:  
---
Any small group that wants to be neutral and own sov is going to have to roam around at some point (every large entity has also been evicted from their space, its just a question of time).
---
Take space where the control is weak (low adm, far from the owners staging) and simply be more persistent then the one trying to keep it. Fighting 1-2 battles three regions over to maintain some unused rental space is much different than fighting constantly every day for weeks.
---
Providence Advice:
---
I see in the other comments you are looking pretty heavily at providence. You could also talk to HTP &amp; TRC if you wanted to try being part of the pirate-bloc in providence. Provi-bloc will never deal with you afterwards but I don't really see that as a bad thing.
---
You could try joining provi-bloc as NRDS but they are not very accepting of new comers at a political level, getting sov will be damn near impossible and you won't have any say in how provi-bloc operates.
---
They are as neutral as any entity holding sov for a long time can be. They do bat phone a lot but since they wont deal with NCPL and vice versa the batphone will ultimately end with Test/Goons/Imperium. But they are neutral in the sense that they won't leave their own space to help anyone else.

So, TNA asked us to come along and hit The Buccaneers's fort. Timer was outside their TZ. They just needed some TZ coverage.  Sure, easy peasy, not a week long eviction, just a couple hours, a couple days, holding hole control. No payment, we just get whatever loot falls out, they just want the fort down. We're told there will be good fights. 
---
We get in and they haven't brought any hole control assets, short of a couple anchorable bubbles and a HIC. Questionable, but we get some supplies in and establish hole control. Fort shields get hit, and then we're moved to the other structures and take out their shields as well. Questionable, but not our call, so we go with it.
---
Come the time for shift change and for TNA to take over hole control again, they are just kind of... not showing up. Couple hours pass and they begin trailing in. They only have a few online, mostly in their POS. I contact the CEO and suggest they tighten up hole control, for obvious reasons, and I'm told this is their weak time and they can't hold it. (This is during the time they specifically told us they had covered.)
---
While this is going on, we're getting bombarded by people asking why we're evicting Buccaneers. We weren't. At least, \*we\* weren't. So now I'm getting the feeling we've been roped into doing an eviction for someone else, for free, while they sit and ship spin.
---
That's not gonna happen. So we change gears. We contact Buccaneers and explain that we're out, this isn't what we signed up for. They're, understandably, dubious but listen while we plan a way to get a fresh connection for them to scan in reinforcements while we keep TNA preoccupied. The goal for us was to just leave once that was done.
---
So, PGGB starts putting pressure on the C3 we need to roll to get the fleet all in one place. With bubbles up we pull in our backstop (rolling battleship sitting on the outside of the verge of collapse hole) and immediately start firing on TNA. 
---
Chaos ensues.
---
Our lack of scrams means all but one Guardian make it off grid into the Raitaru they'd anchored. We take our fleet and burn down the shields and armor of the low power structure and camp them in while the defenders scan out the new C3. 
---
We gather all our stuff and make a clean exfill as we told The Buccaneers we would.  
---
TLDR: TNA asked us to "help" with an OP, lied to us about what their part would be and were completely incompetent about it, so we said fuck it, gave the defenders a quick hand and GTFO'd our asses out of there.
---
That‚Äôs easily changed by banning them from docking in keepstars.

What‚Äôs the math then?  VNIs get 20M ticks, right?  60M for 3, so its 4, maybe 5 VNIs for a super tick.  They aren‚Äôt really getting 150M ticks on average day after day site in and site out with the nerfs.
---
I just checked my wallet and Titan ratting in Delve got me 70M ticks over handful of ~hour+ long sessions with wind up and wind down ticks included.  Got a couple instances over 100M. You could max that more, but this was pvp ft titan and my amateur krab skills, mock them if you must.

POS's were better for generating and having fight, but they had a crapload of other problems.

Is that what the Merlin used to look like?

They were actually. A titan was a massive asset that was planned for and managed.
---
A titan would have a main toon, it's pod. Often an holding toon and its pod, a POS, probably a backup POS. The POS would almost always be watched by a cloaky. People would know that so and so's erebus was at such moon.

---
  
---
You asked for an AAR, I feel like I can give one that's rather honest to the situation. I generally stay off Reddit for AAR‚Äôs but I want to give an explanation.
---
A few weeks ago, a corporation named Bean-Shidh contacted OPSEC wanting to kill The Buccaneers Fortizar. Bean-Shidh had gathered the required intel, timers, structure fits needed to actually plan an eviction. The timers where oddly in US TZ and since The Buccaneers where an EU Corporation, Bean-Shidh needed a US TZ corporation to follow through with the timers. The agreement was set that OPSEC would handle Us TZ Timers and hole control and Bean-Shidh would handle 0600 ‚Äì 1900 eve time hole control. They‚Äôre given reason for the eviction was The Buccaneers never fought, and they wanted to force them to fight.   
---
 
---
A time after this, OPSEC reached out to Hateful Intent to see if we‚Äôd like to tag along. As we‚Äôre a Merc Corp we generally enjoy evictions and eviction defense ops; OPSEC are friends and so we agreed to lend the assist. We where given the basic intel and set the date for when we would infil.  
---
Fast forward a few weeks to the day of the infil. Bean-Shidh Infilled as planned and set up their POS as well as set down a Raitaru. They hit the structures, and set up hole control. Hateful Intent was set to form up Us TZ evening and infil at 01:00 Eve Time Tuesday ( Monday for US TZ ). We formed as asked, prepped our own eviction kit ( never leave home without a life raft ) and went to get ready to join the OP. Once we infilled with a heavy armor fleet, we realized that bean Shidh had not brought any realistic hole control ships. For those reading this unfamiliar with wormhole mechanics; Rolling battleships for rolling wormholes and doorstops, Rolling HICs for Critical holes and Frig Holes, as well as misc tackle, ewar, long range ships.   
---
Luckily, we brought our own kit. Once the situation had solidified, towards the later side of the evening things quieted down for the night. Buccaneers and PGGB made a few runs at sniping sabres but nothing not easily delt with. A few runs with a set of Canes, Sleipnir, later on a sniper naga. Over all, what you expect a defender to attempt to do.  
---
Hole Control continued until 0600, no sign of Bean-Shidh. A few hours later, one of their members log into Comms and let the few guys know that everyone was at work and wouldn‚Äôt be on for a few hours. Now, This is Tuesday morning and the terms of our arrangement was purely for Us TZ coverage. Most of H1NT and OPSEC have daytime jobs. When Bean-Shidh did show up, they where ill-equipped and incompetent to what they where actually doing. Unaware of what a door stop was, or how to perform hole control left a long window where the defenders had free movement. It wasn‚Äôt until one a few of OPSEC and H1NT logged in that any sort of order could be established.   
---
At the point, the obvious was clear. Bean-Shidh where highly inexperienced in this sort of fighting. What pushed this further was the fact they where streaming the eviction live, shit talking The Buccaneers even before they had established the beach head. It was at this point H1NT made the choice that come US TZ we where either going to flip to assist the defenders or exfil and leave the eviction to die the painful death it deserved. Soon enough, OPSEC was also under the same impression and we made the collective choice to turn on Bean-Shidh before exfilling from the Operation.
---
The collective group bumped any floating ships of Bean-Shidh from their POS and killed them, then RFed their low power Raitaru so that The Buccaneers would be easily able to handle the final timer with the assistance coming. The group afterwards while assistance infilled camped Bean-Shidh into their now RFed Raitaru.  
---
This eviction was a classic case of don‚Äôt promise what you can‚Äôt keep. Bean-Shidh over sold their own capabilities, showed that they had no disregard or honor for who they were fighting. Even when we‚Äôve been hired to evict corps that I would say had very slim chances of winning a fight against, I always give them the benefit of the doubt. People can surprise you when you least expect it. Nobody is below decent respect until they're actions prove otherwise.  
---
This AAR , I covered the key details. To explain all the events would take much more time and retrospect. There is a few pieces of advice I‚Äôd like to give to The Buccaneers. Buccaneers, your first reactions where disorganized and lacking. If you‚Äôd like recommendations on how to prepare better for fending off an eviction; I‚Äôd be happy to lend some advice. Without PGGB in the hole with you, this eviction may have ended much differently. That being said, next time your under eviction; We‚Äôll be happy to be there to assist you folks.
---
No ISK exchanged hands for us to switch. There is an AAR up from OPSEC as well as one from myself.

This last sentence is so true. I've got a bunch of raitaru's in lowsec that I don't have any intention of defending. A local pirate group came into my area and when I'm not around they've rf'd them 5-6 times. I lost one raitaru, because it wasn't properly timed. Now, I time it for Wednesday at 3-4am. GL convincing people to shoot a 450mil structure in the middle of the work week in the middle of the night. (No raitaru's have died since I changed the time)

I mean, some of this is true but it's fairly demoralizing to fight against a well defended fort that has a (relatively) similar number of subcaps defending it. You really don't have any good options and it feels as if all you can do is lose vs that. They're such an insane force multiplier that it feels as if the only way to kill them is with titans.

Of course the Monitor is still counterable. I mean, with enough volume of fire you can still headshot the guy, but that can only happen at super large numbers of people or with dedicated alpha doctrines.
---
In mid-size fleet fights you're closing off tactical options and giving less opportunity for individual pilots or lower-tier FCs to do something. It's just more boring.
---
Oh shit somebody outside a 9001 man nullsec blob is making a reddit post? Ban this heresy! No other gameplay styles are allowed!
---
Outposts had sub-systems that allowed you to take out cloning etc.
---
Yet this mechanic was not brought to citadels.
---
Still wondering why tapi took the fight with only 300 people advantage... We are already heaving trouble finding a fight, when we bring 50 ships (the number includes logistic)...
---
Huh, I thought you just got fined from your wallet based on the value of your illegal cargo, did not know they actually shoot at you.
---
The only real way to solve super cap proliferation is to make supercaps no longer worth proliferating. Proliferation only matters when something is worth proliferating.
---
In mid size fights are u really willing to lose the utility or dps of another ship (aka your FC)?  Most mid size fights I see, FCs still fly blingy Loki's or boost BCs
---
Just my $0.02
---
"Delve is safe" -Literally no one worth listening to.
---
Yeah I'd read the warnings that pop up xD
---
I guess it depends on your definition of mid-size. I've seen monitors (mostly Elo) at 40v40. Below that I think you're right.
---
Yeah cuz prioritization isn‚Äôt a thing lol
---
Yup. But just nerfing the shit out of it doesn't solve the problem either. It will just piss off a lot of people and now you're left two entire classes of ships that are useless.
---
I guess technically it does the job but it's an awful way to go about it.
---
Sounds great in theory but I'm not sure most people realize how disgusting the pancake is. They're actually insane and the only reason people don't complain about them is because very few people/groups fly them.

Yeah my mid sized I'm thinking of is WH based or LS based.  Nullsec atm is stuck in the alpha shit faster than the others tactic... This is Uber boring and requires a monitor I guess
---
I would contribute real isk towards any reward for this brave dev
---
Shield, armor, hull.
---
Ask and ye shall receive. :)
---
You got two. Lol. :)
---
One other thing: A POS did not *necessarily* have to be manned to defend itself.

You forgot that they're blue with the Chinese now as well

The fun of the fight? The first two timers will likely go uncontested, and the final one decided by whoever has to stand down due to getting blobbed 9 days later. Those are direct consequences of the design decisions.  
---
Like, eve online is a videogame, and it is the way it is because it was designed that way. People will always min-max the mechanics to their benefit, because that's how you're supposed to play a competitive game of any kind. It's up to ccp to design the game in such a way that conflict and fun are incentivised.  
---
Fights generally aren't that much fun in and of themselves, they're fun because of what's at stake. If I want to have a good time brawl with another group, I can hit them up on discord and ask them to come by. What makes the game fun is the meaning provided by non-consensual conflict - having to fight for your shit, or make someone else fight for theirs. Having a reason to fight makes it more fun.
---
it's a pretty powerful hull, crazy damage/range with cruise missiles
---
Holy Cow, that one is fast!
---
I dunno, that's probably a good thing. Starting off with 100mil when you're months away from flying anything worth more than 20 or 30mil is probably not the best starting perspective. 
---
It sucks, sure, but I think that being a little under the gun for your first few weeks in the game is important. Makes it feel awesome when you earn like 2mil from a mission or mining or something. Those little victories make the game worth playing.
---
one level 4, and one storyline agent.

I mean two of those FRT pets are legacy rejects, and blades was a gotg reject, so what ever your opinion of legacy alliances, those guys are a level below that.

I'm a noob but I'm about to hit Gallente Cruiser 5 and I wanna go welp some Vexors. I live in null specifically Test space which direction should I fly and which fights should I take or engage? Also, got some good fits?

This is a joke right?

Yulai Federation was exprovi and would still be one of your pets if they hadn't been killed off, at least sort cock isn't scared of shooting neuts.

Can confirm, the man dropped 5B on me. Thank you again
---
This flew right over you head.
---
Lol, that's 100% your own fault, not CCP's.
---
Man up and accept it.
---
most people wont fight things if they don't have a reason to.  
---
i have only see 1 fleet so far defend there null sov in nc space and it was not a fun fight thing it was a "fight this thing you can hope to break alone or fuck off"  fleet, no one wants to lose fights any more and the value off there space and stations doesn't even help the idea of "defended you stuff"  sink in.  
---
if they lose a station just put other down, lose space just wait for the attackers to leave and retake it.
---
But haven't goons been saying "delve is not safe, you're a retard if you krab during deployment" for weeks? This is pretty low effort mate.
---
Wtf is that abomination
---
Agreed, 2004 player here.  I remember t2 components from mission running, actual mission rewards beyond isk, and combat that actually had an impact on the next few months of gameplay.  
---
Biggest problem in 2019 is ISK making is way too easy..open wallet: profit!  
---
Jester thanks for all this

Am I being trolled or has your joke out smarted me?

Praise bob

Then they will break and fix it again if they are hungry.
---
The old ibis model
---
That's the thing, who cares about those timers? The most fun I've had is in small fleets Viet-Kong-ing my way around. Litterally just fighting to live in the moment and enjoy the fight.
---
This is what makes EVE so different, you oftenly end up doing something unprofitable for the joy of it, oftenly that's the reward itself. Yeah, you lose your ship, but go down fighting.
---
Your argument that fights aren't fun. Are you sure you don't mean being a human relay isn't fun? Get into a smaller scale group. Or better yet, get a few friends and roam around in subcaps responding to marauders. You'll see the most fun is had when you pilot your ship. You make calls. You coordinate with your friends. Like the huge battles look good on paper, but are you truly having fun?
---
Brisc Rubal should do it.
---
Probably not

Good piloting, good music. What's not to like

Yeah, I'm new too and something similar happened to me with small arms, which gave me a negative wallet. I always look items up to see if they're contraband before I buy them now

So I work at a work-prison. We run 2 chows, breakfast and dinner. They start and end at specific times. We go through their dormitories at the start, announcing it has started, once midway through calling "Last call" and when it's over, that's it.
---
It never fails that there are always some that come shuffling up wanting to eat 5-10 mind after chow is over with. They have excuses like they didnt ver woke up or their cellmate forgot about them or they were busy in the shower.
---
I always tell them the same thing, because its prison and everything runs on a set schedule:
---
"Sleep Late, Lose Weight."
---
The same can be applied to this issue you have. You're a grown adult, learn to be more responsible with your time.
---
I know there used to be some ships that were immune to the cargo scans, but I'm not sure if that's still true.  It's not a very well known section of the game.

you can run a locator on known cap toons still you mong

The only thing inflating is plex prices,  because of the retarded feedback loop with skill goo.
---
I figure the initial dt will be 3 hours then another 2 hours of people bitching about massive disconnects and launcher issues, etc.
---
A pos also required multiple people and coordination to be truly effective and was gimped because it could be defanged.
---
This is such a terrible narrative you guys are attempting to put together lmao.

I cracked hard

Good writing
---
man i'm such an fucking stupid idiot for memeing

Oh I'm figuring the first DT will be 1-2 days, with a few couple hour DTs. This is the company that bricked about 15,000 computers overwriting win.ini, or autoexec.bat.

Ah, those oh so chill POS bashing fleets where we just had great conversations on comms and soaked up the paps. RIP

Oh yeah, I remember the feeling of that first mil‚Äîso good.

Judging through their economic prosperity feels more like goons are living in 1920s

Well, feels like missed a whole lot of free stuff(which is true)

Gladly attended a few of your fleets fly safe 7o

Now If TAPI can replicate this about 20 more times that might somewhat even out all the welps before hand.

Why not add an in-game card game with blackjack.
---
It's honestly hard to tell with TAPI.
---
Don‚Äôt forget keepstars significantly lowering the barriers for entry into a super or a titan (no need for coffin carriers in many alliances) which used to be the biggest cost of ownership.
---
TAPI: Not any old F1 monkeys, disabled F1 monkeys.

Outnumbering "All of EVE" 2-1 is fair.

I hope this will be contested. At least with dreads or something like that.

---
I don't like it because it's a "magical ship" somehow exempt from all the normal ship rules with magical absurd stats/bonuses just so it can do its job.
---
If FCs wanted to have a supertanked ship then they could have just fitted a supertanked ship. Isn't this half the reasons to even have fitting in the game in the first place?
---
OP is just jealous of how baller Unspoken are with their drekavacs.
---
You're still on about this? We're already moving back into position to roast some more botters and renters in the next few days from NPC. We're taking the NC. approach. Cant evict us if we unanchor everything/dont anchor anything.
---
Good I'm really tired of taking 10 gates for fleets. Now it still be one or a bridge.
---
Okay I'm on mobile and the resolution is really shitty and I can only see that there is a keep anchored somewhere but not where. Can someone tell me please?
---
 Vily came back lol
---
Goons dropped a keepstar in KQK1-2, which is in Pure Blind next door to 0-YMBJ which is NC's staging. It comes out in 22 hours.
---
An fc friend of mine is a master of the shield thorax, I use to love flying them, no one expects them. You never take that type of fit out without infoboosts though.

---
Marketing and customer outreach.
---
EVE is not a direct democracy. Ultimately it's the developer that decides what is put in the game and what isn't.
---
CCP is the developer, if player suggestions are terrible then they simply don't implement them.
---
Unless, of course, CCP is a *shit* developer and can't see which ideas are bad and which aren't.
---
I assume it is not like getting shot by Concord? I assume it is just the normal faction police response where it hurts, but you can still warp off?
---
Have you ever tried pulling the stick out of your ass and having fun?
---
Let's not forget FRT had home field advantage so they fielded fax support for the sub caps. Along with carrier and dreads to hit structures.
---
O-y is not a staging system since 5 month but yes...
---
Cool
---
That's like asking why people require to be awarded with XP and loot for grinding. Why not grind for the fun of the grind itself?
---
Because it's not fun, it never was. Retard.
---
HONHONHONOHONOHON
---
I had fun once and it was awful
---
Cutting the head off a snake should not be the tactical option. It shuts off content and, while I understand its merit if you don't want content, I'm happy theres a tool to make content faucets run free. Lower tier FCs should learn to be better FCs by analyzing battlefields before, during, and after the fight and reflecting on it with mentors. FCs do not improve by using cheap shot tactics.
---
They disrupt/scram you. So unless you're fast or stabbed you'll die.
---
Ah the first keepstar fight i won't be attending.
---
At least i have a more legit excuse than "fuck tidi" this time. old school friend's stag weekend.
---
while you're all shooting spaceships, we'll probably be splattering each other with paintballs.
---
It's a popular misconception that sandbox means that you can play however you want and expect results. Even a sandbox has rules &amp; mechanics that you have to understand to be succesful. And not being succesful isn't usually fun.
---
Amen, I'm not sure why citadels got such a "kind" treatment compared to POSes? The whole asset safety thing makes it super safe, as long as that exists we should probably expect them not be too beefy?
---
It'd be a whole other ball game if they were super easy to kill and had no asset safety, but now that they do...
---
Lol... how old are thou?
---
What is the point of marketing a product only to current customers?
---
It's not like anyone buy players goes to these events

Ah, man, it must really be annoying to travel around as a permanent -10 sec status.

The thing is you can just pay back discord and get to 0 again

What the actual fuck
---
The ISO standard is actually year/month/day, which also makes sense.
---
Only one way doesn't make sense, and it's the way Americans do it

Then we shall "fight" by going AFK in cloaked ships

Must get pretty expensive pretty quickly though if you keep paying off your crimes.

Dost thou not enjoy internet spaceships?

CCPlease remove all alts from the game and enforce one character per player
---
Nice vid.. Almost makes me want to play eve again :)
---
One little piece of advice, if you don't mind. KAR against that no web breacher made you sit still so you were taking extra damage. Try to keep your speed up and transversal low with manual piloting. Source - ex top 3 atron pilot on zkill :D.
---
Stole my fit too , btw :)

Building brand awareness and advertising their culture and stuff all over social media? And how do you know these events dont bring in new players?

"How to destroy what is left of EVE Online in One Easy Step!"
---
you know very little about the game and you should not express your opinion with such confidence
---
Need another 10 alts to reach the magical number of 69
---
They never should've merged Outposts and POSes into single class of structures.
---
the barghest has 2 drop sources
---
1: a rare spawn in lowsec, where nobody lives, from belt ratting, which nobody does
---
2: LP from mordu's legion. mordu's legion only has agents in a single system so it's exceptionally hard to run if you aren't blued up with the locals. that system has a single level 4 agent, so you cant take multiple missions at once to save on time docking up. the system is very large, iirc around 180 au, meaning you waste A LOT of time in warp. on top of all that, the barghest competes for LP with the garmur and the orthrus
---
as such, there's not many of them being created. the barghest is also a really strong ship as well
---
Sydney, British Colombia, Canada...right?
---
But you'd be making it for people that do want to look at them
---
He plays for fun these days i think, FCs some small roams around drone lands
---
881 vs 545, look at that 10-1 advantage silly tappy never take fight filthy blobbers
---
That would work if the bots are stupid and issue commands on set millisecond counters like pulling drones then warping then deploying drones again. 
---
BUT CCP has said that most bots don't go 24/7 and I imagine they're clever enough to at least attempt to mimic a real player.
---
what is dead may never die
---
Alright, who's "responsibilty" was this?
---
Blockade runners. Not sure if they're immune to scans by the fuzz though.
---
 Miss my times of M&amp;B Warband where I didn't know how to pronounce the names of the towns, made the game so much better.
---
Seconded.
---
You should have seen some ship models in ‚Äô08, they were fantastic [for the time].
---
And the earlier models... they are as good as industrial archeology.
---
And can subsequently do fuck all with it.

I hear init does them quite well.

---
^(Your redditing backfired shot down by facts ... o damn post better)
---
The only difference is that you dont need to ask your spais who to web.
---
Why not?
---
What do you think is more interesting:
---
* **F1-mashers being lemmings behind hard-to-kill FCs, having very little impact on their own on the fight**
---
* **Multiple squadrons acting independently but in a coordinated way, following the orders of a lead FC but ultimately left to the skill of smaller groups**
---
If Monitors didn't exist and it was still easy to headshot subcap FCs, then if someone could come along and have lots of small organized groups they could headshot and dominate groups who did not have that level of individual skill and coordination. Rather than changing how they fought or trying to improve the skills of lower-ranking commanders, people wanted to stay reliant on singular FCs. So they just made CCP change the game to suit their play rather than play in the sandbox.
---
my question is will this even come to the west
---
Fantastic news
---
You dont business real well, do you...
---
Kikimora is quite fun.
---
Fuck thats like 3 AM for me .............
---
Uh nope, pretty sure this was the first week
---
and if you leave that dialogue open and just ignore it, you can slowboat back to the gate you came from and just leave.
---
Million dollar fight hype time?
---
Since when do people not train CPU Management V?
---
I think f1-mashing lemmings have a fantastic role in the game. They get the content without having to worry about all the things I do. Without them I wouldn't have fleets.
---
But even lots of small organized groups are organized and planned typically by one singular motive. Its just how it is. Also, if the only way someome can win a fleet fight is by disabling the enemy fleet, they aren't really winning. They're mostly hurting themselves and their line members by turning off content.
---
Sleep is for the weak
---
And definitely won‚Äôt reverse scan from the target hole.
---
Hey someone jebaited on flair. Nice!
---
I'd rather face down a POS than a citadel any day of the week. POSes are not meaningful threats to capital ships.
---
Oh, that's easy to explain - no one complained about it so they felt no need to be all defensive about it and decided it's safe to axe.
---
It's usualy rather far down the list of skills one needs to train on a new alt.
---
That must have been a very long commencement speech!
---
Can you imagine keepstars without the shield timer? People would actually defend them üòÇ
---

Oh ya it‚Äôs a beast, I ran a officer heavy point on it getting like over heated 85-90k point combine that with all its slots and you get a neat station camper in Jita lol. Wish I could remember its stats but it was brutal
---
While numbers were miss matched, FRT had triage support which was a multiplier. 
---
Props for unlocking and fighting.
---
I'm been out of game for years but I'd so buy a pack of cards with modern ships... that and tiny ship models.
---
That is what the free sp is for.
---
they got a fight, its like winning the lottery.
---
Hardknocks....oh wait
---
please remind me what happened in Tennerifis last year before the russians moved in. Lorde BOG and Seren took tennerifis and Test couldn't win a single op. They had to move entosis dreads and their super cap fleet to take back the region. And that with mostly no FRT involvment. I wouldn't call them dumbster tier.
---
Looks like a fair fight, and at least TAPI was able to actually win a fight for once.
---
Have you tried re-starting your PC?
---
&gt; So they just made CCP change the game to suit their play rather than play in the sandbox.
---
Which is pretty much exactly what you're arguing for now...
---
The free SP is for the skills on the list before CPU Management V. TBH CPU isn't an issue that often it's the PG more often than not and even if it is an issue the 1% implant costs what 2mil isk?
---
[removed]
---
I was just thinking the other day that it would be better if citadels adapted some of the POS mechanics.
---
Specifically, to have any reinforce timers citadels should need to be fueled with stront. The amount of stront determines the length of the reinforcement timer, so both attacker and defender have a little influence on it, but it could end up unfavorable for either party. And to have any repair phase (for armor/hull) they'll need something else, like say construction blocks (or pick any other material).
---
Time to reinforce/kill (even with damage cap) should scale with the structure. With enough force you should be able to kill a medium citadel in 10 mins. There should also not be any reinforce timers for low power medium citadels (same as an unanchored POS).
---
As a result of requiring the bulky stront and "repair material", pressure on logistics will increase, which in turn hopefully will mean fewer citadels in the end (or more easier killable ones).
---
Well, keep in mind it's a new and fully from the ground programmed client, it¬¥is not like they could have just taken the basis eve code and crammed it onto a phone.
---
You compare apples to pears right now.
---
So turn your ship 5 degrees to the right...
---
A minimally skilled pilot should still have things trained to at least III, if not IV. Assuming you are training everyting to III, you are going to be around 20% - 40% less effective in every area, and that is excluding the bonuses from T2 such as T2 ships, modules, and ammo. There are definitely circumstances and fits where low skills aren't a deal-breaker, and you can definitely make up for SP with player skill, but not having some skills like Drones to V is very rough.
---
It's required for cynos and pretty critical on any missile boat.  It's also a 1x skill.
---
But yeah that's a bug.  There are some even more entertaining ones on some of the gates as I recall.
---
For the swarm!
---
We don't have a group of people doing that exactly, it is more of a 1 player wit 2 characters sort of thing. We have been experimenting with long-term diving/hunting fleets where we stage out of an orca though, so it is defiantly possible to make work on a larger scale.

+1 crates are fucking annoying.

The odd thing is, that America has had far more acts of terrorism from internal sources than exterior ones. 
---
Less people died on that day than have died in the middle East.
---
American tourists are no longer so arrogant and insufferable.
---
However, America as a whole is more paranoid and nationalistic.
---
It is how sensational the event was and how it shook the confidence of the nation that was significant, not the loss of life. 
---
Plenty more have died in longer more agonising ways.
---
You want easy wins against lemmings?
---
I think the fact it was such a distinct attack from a foreign terror source that was so alarming about it. 
---
Yeah there is alot of domestic terrorism but alot of that is lone wolf one-off attacks and not organized in such a way as 9/11 was pulled off.
---
Amen

You should all take a moment and wait for the BN-SH AAR if it's coming anyway. But while waiting consider whether it's fair to call BN-SH incompetent. Do you really think an old WH corp with good stats didn't know what they were doing? Rolling battleships...? You can roll any hole with enough fleet.
---
It all seems a lot like a misunderstanding on all sides.
---
Home field advantage off their best TZ :joy:

That anecdote could have any number of causes. Your corp might have a meme name and be attracting the gullible and young.

It's actually an f1 monkey incentiviser and removes sand from the sandbox. Having secondary and tertiary FCs, and reacting to the FC being destroyed was part of the game. At least someone's happy they got their tears heard. Enjoy. Downvote away retards.
---
I've read 1984, still don't get it. What do?
---
I didn't have a problem with the event, and I appreciated the 2-day grace period, because I did forget twice. But given that people's perception of time may be influenced by where they live, it seems it wouldn't cause CCP any harm to simply extend these kind of events till 5/21 downtime while saying "May 20," to make sure that anyone anywhere in the world who logged in on May 20 could still claim their reward. There's no downside. It just means that people in timezones that are more ahead get a little more grace period and for them it may be May 21, which would be a nice surprise if they were behind.
---
I‚Äôm in Horde and is the first time I hear about this guys, where do they live?
---
Did they change it? Because back in the day I was a filthy pirate I could just travel around with battleships because these stupid police would web me before activating point. Basically webbing me into warp.
---
Trig ships generally, but there is a vast difference between the LS and WH metas. In a WH it's usually a T3 or a strat. In LS whatever you feel comfortable in can be made to work, though some ships are definitely better the others. Also, no NS?

What about the Han Solo maneuver and jetcan it?

Some system has very few moons. Hed-gp - 7 moons. 0OYZ-G - 7 moons. I know nothing about the 2nd system. Except that, because we fought over it. Not endless spam, there was a hard number to go after. Whoever ended up with 4 in that system, won.

In this thread: OP makes a tired half-assed joke. People don‚Äôt laugh. OP pretends it‚Äôs because they simply lack the culture to appreciate his brilliant humor and chastises them for not properly appreciating both him and the book ‚Äú1984‚Äù by Orwell.

Any shield ship would like to talk to you.

CVA is obviously still living in Provi but there is still the "not red don't shoot" rule in place so as long as you aren't on the kill list you won't be harmed by the locals. And I think in almost every system is a Freeport citadel for neuts

but i want to shoot nc
---
think he means the gun slots.
---
i cannot disagree with you, as you have not made your point and opinion with reason yet.
---
you either dont have a view, or are struggling to put it into words.
---
just because a little fight here and there happens dude, doesnt mean shit lol. i mean, seriously, either: when did you start playing eve and actually in nullsec, or when and how hard did you hit your head?
---
Kiting takes a lot of skill if against multiple enemies. Manual piloting &amp; positioning etc. And when brawling you often can't fight that many enemies because you simply run out of ehp. When kiting you can fight unlimited enemies as long as you avoid taking damage.
---
Hitting orbit 500m and activating modules isn't really that special.
---
&gt;Just watch, this happened with pubg mobile also. 
---
Get stolen by your Chinese partner? Apparently the government rejected monetization approval for PUBG mobile and turns out Tencent already had a near identical clone under a different name that was already approved for them to move all the PUBG players onto. What a coincidence.

Let's hope Netease uses lube CCP. :)

You should watch list a few people in your fleet

Evicting a 200 man alliance is a bit harder when test and two goon sigs form for every timer

Well look at our killboard genaraly [BUCS KB](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98572673/)..and here [Fight with TNA](https://br.inyour.space/?s=1001957&amp;b=8600940&amp;e=90&amp;t=ub) \- when we saw that thers more guardians and heavy shit comming  we just burn away and left them unsatisfied.. TNA called it "NO FIGHTING"?   
---
Here is our small fight against  WHBOO  just **few hours** ago [BUCS vs WHBOO](https://youtu.be/xZXVsBbf4xU)  \- maybe a chaos but we won.. and we fought with potential biger corp... who wants to  bump his head against the wall of Guardians. TNA lied, lie and will lie again \^\_\^
---
Then we'll iterate on the reward system. 
---
Breaking and then fixing stuff that was fine before will yield a peach and pineapple pizza. And with a lot of garlic.

Except much less rare then an officer and can expect to see a few mordus spawns a day. Not saying they are going to be barghest though.

Also: a chance of immediate killmail if someone "forgot" to stront it.
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh this makes sense.
---
Thanks
---
This
---
good post
---
Making a limit of 5 accounts I see as OK. Farming sp with hundreds of alts is pretty cancer. But muliboxing is a prime part of eve that shouldn't be taken away.
---
You‚Äôll have a hard time finding fights if your in TAPI, since they like to blue everyone. I‚Äôd say ask your corporation who are your enemies, and fly to their closest system to kill some people.
---
:innocent:
---
Also, if you've fitted a cap battery, check if you have any overheat damage on it that you wouldn't have noticed if you've 'hidden' passive modules on your UI.
---
30 alts*
---
what about this:  
---
\- remove TCUs and iHubs from the game
---
\- make the TCU a 4th rig in a medium or large citadel
---
\- make the upgrades available as service-modules, add 2 more service slots (which consume fuel)
---
to claim a system one would have to anchor a citadel and fit the TCU-rig
---
make medium structures have shorter timers
---
leave timers for large structures as they are
---
restrict systems to not have more than 2 unique small and 1 unique large structure
---
monitors only go about 1600 with a blingy mwd, muninns go like 2400 linked. elo is probably the most recognizable fc in the game, if he didn't fly monitors he wouldn't be able to fc at all, but monitors aren't fast enough for muninns without snakes, so
---
of course not, a dreadbomb like we saw in MTO2 won't work against this many titans
---
I was not joking. :)
---
How nice of you just proving my point. 
---
:D
---
frat tried to split the fight with skillu engaging one of the hostile fleets on the other side of the system. if you subtract those two fleets, the fight between frat and legacy on the other gate was a bit more steeply tilted in favor of tapi
---
it's also possible they were using the now-broken br tool, which shows numbers more like 700:200 total and doesn't show the fleet skillu fought
---
I May have worded that wrong. Everyone under ncpl on the imperium kill-list in 'shit on' priority is part of the imperium was what i meant
---
&gt; Seems like it was a completely broken mechanic imo

And thats how Lumpymayo got space rich by skimming of the Brave moons while doin all the "work".

59 fucking accounts?

They can be scanned by probes, otherwise that‚Äôd mean there wouldn‚Äôt be any way to catch them if they simply warped and stayed idle on a safe spot. If you‚Äôre looking for a ship that can‚Äôt be scanned down and still retain all of its mobility, you can take a look at the Force Recons like the Pilgrim and use their covert ops cloaking devices to your advantage.
---
"ignorance is strength"

Fitting considering we are telling our guys delve is not safe atm

pretty much any wh group if the money is right...

You're right, none else here has any friends. You're the only one, and we are all envious.
---
O√Ø !
---
That‚Äôs a personal taste, so bear with me.
---
On ships that have a hull bonus to shield booster effectiveness (like the Cyclone), I generally try to get the hull skill as high as I can to get the best numbers out of the ancillary shield booster. If it doesn‚Äôt please me, I generally sacrifice a midslot for a shield boost amplifier. The rig that accelerate shield booster cycle time might be counterproductive, as you‚Äôll burn through your loaded cap charges faster for the same result.
---
With all the other slots, you‚Äôre free to place guns, tackling modules, EWAR and damage mods, getting your DPS high. But again, that‚Äôs personal taste :)
---
There are a few sites that for whatever reason have a skill check on gates. There's one Serpentis one, for example, that lets you take a shortcut if you have Plasma Physics 4. I guess it's meant to be a reward, but as you can tell, it's not very well thought out.
---
And then the week.
---
the unspoken guys are spinning more than a little here
---
for almost a month before ncdotto deployed they were receiving almost daily help from three different goon sigs (welp, liberty, sv) in the spire and malpais, and goons deployed ngsa (cloaky camping sig) to malpais as well
---
Early on, when I was still putzing around in High Sec, I came across some random mission that involved me finding some slaves in amongst the loot.  I was in Minmatar space, where a cargo hold full of slaves isn't looked upon too kindly.  I think a bit of my Minmatar character died that night, as the slaves were herded back into a flimsy cargo container and set adrift to slowly freeze and/or asphyxiate to death...
---
Why not use an offline salvage as a heat sink in your empty high?
---
*asshurt noises* 
---
i dont even have a horse in this race but you sound mad af mate
---
The money is inside the structures. How much is valuable Intel worth tho? :)
---
Then you should find some, it's better than being sat in that inevitable tidi shitfest
---
&gt;Then horde started escorting NC. every fleet which meant goons had to come and try to even out the numbers
---
got your order of events wrong there bud
---
hey you know you guys misspelled murderous right
---
Yes
---
Weird flex but okay
---
OP is probably the kind of player who rage quits and uninstalls when he loses his first ship.

p sure they still do that

The whole last week I got pings telling me to krab now because after Saturday (18/5) you'll die in a ball of fire.

wingspan does evictions

hole control too

hard knocks not sure

lazerhawks might

and of course!  goonswarm federation for not small fee can  evict wh people as goons have wormhole divisions

Wingspan don't do evictions at the express instruction of Chance. The kill low power structures all the time but if it's low power it's not an eviction.
---
Cheers for the tip :)

So how did CCP botch this? They gave you several days warning that it would start the 2nd of may and it did. You even got a few days leeway.
---
But guys, reddit told me NCPL didn't really want Tribute anyway!
---
Hard knocks still less dead than half of wspace. Sad
---
Yes, their "gallon" is still half full
---
He did. Would need to fit just 2 it seems.
---
Which sigs are we talking about? I never got a single ping to defend things.
---
Some things don't deserve to exist
---
This is still CCP fault, when they introduce a mechanic they have to think about the flaws or listen to what testers they.
---
Everyone knew the second they were announced it would be a clusterfuck in the next years and here we are citadels spam everywhere
---
IMO they need to remove the dps cap from initial shield timer, while significantly buffing its ehp.  also only allow citadels, not raiterus/athanors to have anticap launchers.  probably also a slight buff to subcap dps and locktimes.
---
everything matters :)
---
seeking social validation on a internet forum tends to be a thing mentally handicapped people do, accepting the fact is the first step.
---
Somebody clearly took a break from Citadel mechanism design to do the shirt designs.
---
&gt; Outposts had sub-systems that allowed you to take out cloning etc.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ‚Äã
---
&gt; Yet this mechanic was not brought to citadels in some form of implementation. 
---
It was actualy a meaningful thing to do to generate content.
---
Ah, the good old "let's punish our neighbors for being pussies" tactic. Classic 2010.
---
If PD for detecting bots was created, would there be bots to detect bots?

You realise without help it's probably going to be at least 4000 holes you visit
---
The house of parliament isn't your mail room Bam
---
While cloaky camping and Rorqual multi-boxing are downright required to play high-level nullsec warfare, there'll be people with dozens of alt accounts around.
---
Which is exactly what CCP's bean-counters want. Keep the subs and PLEX flowing in.
---
It would be cool if you could take them back to a Minmatar station and set them free for an increase in standings. It does feel weird that the ‚Äúgood‚Äù outcome is to leave them floating in space.
---
NS is easy, something that can fit a mobile cyno inhib, point, cyno and liquid O
---
I am guilty of switching guns around weapon slots during fitting to make SURE they are visually symetric. I don't care about empty slots for heat distribution or any logical order, but i literally will never undock if it can't be done. If you see it once, you will never unsee it
---
If you put the guns in the other high slots, the models on the hull will move.
---
It's actually a front for a shady bio/chemical weapons division.
---
Pandemic Horde space wouldn‚Äôt be bad to roam with a Vexor. You‚Äôre a pretty good counter to ramjags since you have drones for dps, although I would try to stick to systems away from bwf or o-vw because a decent fit ramjag will tank you for a while and you want it dead before backup arrives.
---
Monetized autism

What they need is a select/deselect all on the redeeming items page.

Goonswarm is effectively, Libertarian tendency people (or anti-authoritarian types) living out our Stalinist authoritarian regime repression fantasies online. :)
---
I think you missed the point /u/Aliventi was trying to make, which is that nobody really *got excited* to do that, except maybe the person planning the op. The fleet members would generally groan and hope for an actual enemy fleet to show up.
---
They're not arguing RFing random POSes didn't happen, of course it did, it was part of warfare, they're just saying it was boring and shitty content and POSes weren't really better than Citadels in that respect.
---
&gt; "They‚Äôre given reason for the eviction was The Buccaneers never fought "
---
:facepalm: 
---
TNA &amp; Buccanners are really different in the way they way, 
---
BUCS is more nano thingy with on average less than 10 membres while TNA is more of an heavy armor with number closer to 15/20.
---
(and at least BUCS does'nt live in a WR :p )
---
Maybe there is some polish drama we're not aware of :D
---
You get downvoted, but you're not wrong.
---
This current climate of arranging fights JUST to have a fight? That's disgusting and the polar opposite to the Eve of 15 years ago. Corporations and alliances fought because they wanted the territory. Not for """""""content""""""" or whatever streamer-aids wants.
---
fitting skills are far and away the most critical skills for flying ships in EVE, and CPU Management is one of the most foundational.
---
They matter far more than weapons and dps skills (better fitting has a better return in terms of dps, even if thats all you care about).
---
Train it.
---
Funny you mention "killary" and not the other guy.
---
&gt;Isn't this half the reasons to even have fitting in the game in the first place?
---
No. 95% of the reason fitting is in the game so plebs can ruin the FC's day.
---
*"FC I have an AB not a MWD, what do?!"*

Luckily for me, I already have friends and also aren't part of the tidi blobtastic shitfest of nullsec. Double win!
---
I've slowboated away from sites before when someone scary enters local. Sometimes when I get 150km away from the site it self destructs. I guess your method gets around that as you are not manually moving off grid to create the bookmark.
---
Well, at this point pretty much everyone is allies with a major Chinese alliance, at least if you count the Mangos. So you can‚Äôt really go hating on Chinese without hating on your own allies. That should help some, at least
---
That's a good choice!
---
Hard no isn't just a letter Kenny thing lol.
---
Its fairly common in the uk
---
I have also lost ships to Concord after jumping into hisec while criminal from lowsec shenanigans, blew past warnings and ended up dead. You‚Äôre definitely not alone in learning that lesson the hard way
---
No shit.. it works now!!.. thank you lord
---
I *always* cloak up if **anyone** enters local.
---
I will D-Scan and if I see a ship unlikely to have scan probes I may resume. Even so when I have hacked one can I will slowly move cloaked to the next can.
---
If I get the uneasy feeling of being hunted I just move to a new system.
---
Battle Rorqual Jump Hictor served /w Neuts and Bulkheads.     Great for bait and switch only 1.99b (excavators are not included).
---
Quafe Zero may be not but Strong Crash may be?
---
Do you remember the original hacking system? Once you hacked the cans the contents flew out in different directions. You had to quickly click on them to grab maybe 4 out of 10 items.
---
Asymmetric warfare.
---
WHs have a mass limit though. I don't think null and WH space are comparable that easy.
---
I take an arranged fight over no fight, but I'd rather have a real fight for an objective. 
---
Someone else said it already, you take the complaint about the current reinforce mechanics and pretend people liked POS services better. That's not the case (for the vast majority anyway).     
---
OP made a list how to iterate in citadel timers to make them more pos-like, not to take features away.
---
if YOU want someone to get evicted YOU have to pay for it. you cant guarantee that enough loot drops for it to be worth it
---
Wow someone else remembers the grabby system. I didn't explore for long after trying it.
---
# Some suggestions:
---
* **Reinforcement** of a citadel that affects sovereignty in some way will **weaken the defender's nearby structures**
---
   * e.g. shield reinforcement could expand vulnerability windows
---
   * e.g. armor reinforcement could affect other citadels' reinforcement timers
---
   * obviously the last timer is for the structure itself and that is fine as-is
---
   * engineering complexes and refineries are also affected by citadel reinforcement, but do not contribute to the negative effect when reinforced
---
* The **negative effect should correlate with the size of the structure**. Reinforced Keepstars should severely weaken surrounding citadels, something like 1 hour each. Reinforced Astrahus' don't change that much, something like 10-15 minutes, maybe even 5, who cares.
---
This incentivizes defenders to *actively protect* *their citadels* while simultaneously *limiting the number of citadels in a system*:
---
* Spam 100 citadels in a system?
---
   * Attackers shield reinforce 10 (what this number is is an implementation detail) of them, now all of them are constantly vulnerable.
---
   * Attackers armor reinforce them too since they weren't defended, now defenders need to be prepared to defend some of their citadels at less convenient hours.
---
* Only deploy 1?
---
   * That's your stronghold, better keep it.
---
   * Fight completely on defenders terms.
---
* Deploy a few?
---
   * Prevent the biggest citadel from being reinforced to allow better protection of the smaller ones.
---
   * Fights over the smaller citadels can turn the tide slightly so there is still *some* incentive to attack them.
---
# Another thing... Asset safety:
---
Asset safety currently keeps something like 85% of your stuff safe, right?
---
Well what if asset safety got worse and worse depending on the number of reinforced citadels in the system. The last citadel to explode would still have 85% asset safety, but the first one in a system of 20 reinforced citadels might only have something like 50% safety. Now you have a pretty good reason to evacuate. Who doesn't remember evacuation fights? #glorydays
---
CCPlease expand on this and put some more stakes on the line.
---
Thnanks, i hate it.

And now i am gonna notice it on my ships and i BLAME YOU and YOU ALONE for my suffering!

Looking forward to Eve Taranta next month!
---
imgur scales the resolution down for the mobile site.
---
You can usually look at the desktop version with the non-fucked pic.
---
But in words: gooms deployed a keep in tribute presumably as forward staging, or at least a content generator.
---
This would be an awesome idea against Alpha clone botting o_o
---
Boosh ravens maybe?
---
Sounds like a NIP
---
Hahahaha awesome stuff! 
---
I find once you have the Atron dialed in you can fight majority of the ships in novices, and take risky fights vs some navy/pie pie frigs in hopes to capitalize on your opponents mistakes. Definitely a fun cheap ship that is underestimated and will get you a tonne of fights.
---
Good fights!

Gf my dude :)

Hey that guy had a dumb moment, thought he was shooting a red structure and stopped as soon as he realised. He feels real bad

I like this
---
??? I literally took 2 ihubs with 5 dudes from my corp's small gang channel.
---
2 other TEST corps took faction stations in Tenerifis by themselves while the entire coalition was in Providence getting those stations.
---
What are you even talking about.
---
I do loads of smallgang pvp, but even at the corp scale part of playing eve seriously is fighting over space and structures. It's even harder for a 20 man corp to kill an astra at 4am on a Wednesday than it is for a null blob. Having done plenty of that kind of alarm clocking with the one other no-lifer in corp to do exactly that, I know what i'm talking about.
---
Maybe instead of assuming that everyone who wants to use mechanics to provoke fights is a mindless drone, you should try actually fighting a corp-level campaign against someone. Tell me how you feel after you've killed 10 citadels.
---
Everyone does evictions. This isn't K-Space, in wormholes everyone takes part in evictons. It's just part of wormhole space.
---
Put it this way, I can go out in a cyclone and pump out level 3's to generate vast sums of fw lp (it's magnified by you warzone control... And the objectives are normally a single shop or structure.
---
You're looking at replacing a t2 fitted cyclone with just 2 missions.
---
The rest is gravy... Plus, the mission plex is warpable to local, you can use you missions to bait pvp, essentially, paying yourself to roam.
---
Well planed monetization abuse of autism to be precise

For all the dumbasses claiming this is a bad thing in the game: you're stupid.

After FCing Horde, the amount of times some 0-effort spy would just say "shoot X, Y, Z in that order" and the entire FC pool for a fleet would be zonked would just absolutely ruin content. If all the FC's are dead, you know what happens with a fleet? It goes home or spends the next 15 mins warping around in system so it can logoff so that the FC can come back in a new ship to shepherd it home. It got so bad that I found myself flying multiple brick-tanked Hics/command ships while FCing so that every time they'd head-shot me or jam me or web me or damp me or scram me etc. I'd be able to just say "anchor back up on 'Insert Alt Name here'" while accepting that the alt that was currently scrammed/webbed/etc. was dead to me and the fight would go on before backup FC's needed to be called on. Having to FC from multiple ships/clients fucking sucked and, now that I'm no longer with Horde, I don't begrudge their FC's or FC's in different alliances like them for using the Monitor. 
---
It means that people can reasonably have a chance of actually FCing something mid-large sized without being instantly evaporated before the fight really even begins. If you like having fleet fights in EVE, especially the medium sized ones with 50-150 people, Monitors make those fights so much more plausible.
---
As a final point, if you think the Monitor shouldn't exist, then names being displayed on the overview also shouldn't exist. Fix it so that there is no "Name" column in the overview and you'd almost instantly solve the issue of head-shotting. (You would still have the ability to broadcast targets and/or display tags to designate targets)
---
There are also some hidden places that you can open using tags or special items.
---
That's not botting. It's just a coincidence that 45 people with exactly the same name all happened to want to mine in the same location.
---
Honest!
---
They can..
---
do you usually put you miners in different systems?

I‚Äôve never talked about social acceptation. I‚Äôve talked about the fact that everyone that downvoted your post think you are the retard.

We should work on removing that shit(at the very least from null), instead of introducing it to more areas of the game.
---
Dumping your items into a hostile station to automagically teleport them to safety from there... EVE 2k19 lmao.

Thus leaving certain systems more vulnerable and allowing enemies a potential place to get footholds... Isnt this a good thing?

The skills of your FC *always* dictates the outcome.  Or do you believe a line member's ability to lock up broadcasts and activate F1 is a skill?
---
This isn't really a benefit in the citadel era.  If you mapped this to modern day citadels every legitimate entity would just fill their territory to the maximum to prevent hostile structures from being dropped into their space.
---
I was sadly nearly a full region away when this happened.. Could not join in.

Gotta ask yourself what's more important. 
---
Looking cool, or being cool?
---
And, what's cooler than being cool?
---
im literally one of the top solo/micro pvpers in EVE, guess again
---
TBH being famous in eve sounds awful.
---
&gt;Turns out we are terrible at coming up with requirements for CCP to implement. Instead of complaining about what once was, we need to figure out how to improve what we have.
---
I think the only place citadels are broken (compared to something else being in more need of fixes) is in FW, and that is this the only place that citadels need a fix. Even so, maybe just removing one timer in FW is enough.
---
Emergent gameplay.  I‚Äôll allow it.

Esp when that alliance was only given 20 systems to start with
---
Yeah, that's not right, using enemy structures to dump your loot and then asset safety it back to lowsec.
---
300 is not even a callworthy fleet according to goons

---
High risk high reward in wormholes. Low risk/High reward is null. No asset safety in wh's remember.
---
The inventory and structure management is much better, which is good for your date of mind if nothing else. The only way wormholes are safer really is due to the same issue that effects all other areas of space; citadel spam and ref timers
---
Explained like a total scrub!
---
This is unironically culturally enriching.
---
They didn't dreadbomb, you don't dreadbomb a KS with a damage cap lol. 1000 titans or 100 makes no difference. 
---
You drop LR dreads in places out of range of the titans. No matter how many titans goons can muster the attacker will always have an advantage when dropping LR dreads in spots out of range of the massive KS model. Just have to be willing to lose a heap of dreadnaughts to fighters/subcaps to keep it paused.
---
Tdf is the armor incursion group with public channel - the ditanian fleet

It's ironic saying this as a wormhole, but join wingspan. They got this living style down pat and some even use orcas to terrorize people.

And now one moon frack yields up to a billion ISK only for few hours of mining, oh I love the progress in EVE!  p.s. One scoop of R64 moon ore wih maxed out capital mining ship is about 10 mil.
---
In the TEST SOTA (if we can even call it that) it was stated multiple times how people were shooting secondaries rather than primaries, and in general being poor at anchoring up, aligning and follo into broadcasts.

So, unfortunately, it IS a skill (or rather lack thereof) to some

Yet we all know he didn't.

Need more monitors
---
Unless it‚Äôs gotg and they bring more monitors than dps
---
100% Agree with everything you just said.  I have been playing eve for over twelve years now. I cannot count how many times I have seen FC's get systematically primary-ed  off grid because the other side of the field is full of spies and do not want the slightest chance that the fight could be fair at any level. I myself have been primary-ed off grid immediately after all FC's and back-up FC's were taken out simply because I was asked to take over the fleet. I said "no" and was getting yellow boxed by the enemy fleet. They asked again because no one ever says "no" and I yelled out "NO, I will not FC, what is the damn point". The enemy fleet stopped targeting me and gave me waves in local.   
---
We did not have monitors back then. It would have come in handy for sure!

You joke but we fought a Darkness Ferox fleet recently, was about 40 people Inc tackle/logi/support.

3 Monitors.
---
Just found the main anchor, webbed and they never switched once.
---
Nullsecer here. I enjoy these.
---
God yes, I had to open my stockpile of project discovery crates, over 300 of them. Took me over an hour
---
Considering the alternative to depositing cargo  is to allow scam courier contracts and to force rorques to go to L structures to deposit ore, well... Why was this added again?
---
As someone who's had to open 300+ project discovery crates on a half dozen occassions, I second this.
---
Didn't they remove the ability to warp into a sun?
---
XD
---
Are you referring to the recent community tournament or the tournament being held as part of the EVE world tour?
---
Ahh, ok, gotcha.
---
&gt;TBH CPU isn't an issue that often it's the PG more often than not
---
if you're using artillery all the time maybe, for close range ships it usually doesn't matter while cpu almost always matters
---
well downvoted but goddamn if that's not mfw browsing eve forums
---
24 minutes on Citadels, 24-32 minutes on faction fortizars, 16 minutes on everything else, times 3 timers shield/armor/hull. Plates can add 50-80% to those figures for armor.

If you think it's all the playerbase why even bother playing then?

No.

Fuck off and die in game.

338 vs 41 =  Skirmish... lol, non, its hard blobing... Only win way for goon... \^\^
---
At some point you need that tank though. Also it's not like the EHP was unreasonable, the FC legions people were flying before the T3 patch had double the armor EHP of a Monitor, even now they still have more it's just a toss up because of the sig.
---
i think  shooting low power is still eviction if someone  keeps living in low power structures.
---
\#ccplease
---
Wormhole space dude. Did a structure bash a couple weeks ago, netted like 70 Bil in loot.. From a dead group
---
What does that show? It took place after we were gone. It doesn't even suggest payment. I said good luck. Lol.
---
I'm not really sure how that is a brag or proof of anything.
---
It began as a skirmish, correct. The eagle blob arrived later on to break the apostles.
---
If it's low power they're not actively living it IMO. It's not hard to not have a structure go low power.
---
Tbh i am shocked that NC.[UNANCHORING] even undocked.
---
What about a broken imbalanced unstoppable uncounterable raven doctrine?
---
Unpopular opinion:  The shared living quarters / hangars in POSes forces corp members to trust each other.  
---
In a game that prides itself of allowing theft, backstabbing and villainy, this was a pretty dumb design decision.
---
They may know how to brawl and choose their fights. They do not know how to run hole control, at all. We had to explain a lot of very basic hole control practices to them and half the time they just left the holes completely unattended and stay in their tower.
---
I can't say on the whole they are incompetent, but as far as trying to siege a wormhole system, incompetent is a fitting description.
---
The real problem with the monitor is that it's a poorly chosen name which screws CCP out of a cool name/theme for something like a t2 BS or t2 ABC with a single bonused XL gun (and some larges ideally).
---
[Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship))
---
[another example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monitor_Faa_di_Bruno.png)
---
Outposts were better for content than citadels. My best memories were all from breaking camps on our home station.
---
There is no reason for a citadel to be able shoot when it isn't being attacked. It just prevents casual fights on the undock.
---
I have found myself downvoting stainguy lately. üòû
---
Don‚Äôt worry rush, they trying to tell their pets they are good
---
The Monitor is a good niche ship for junior FCs that still need that additional security. After that they can move to grown up groups that have multiple anchors, disguised by flying the mainline dps ship with altered max-tank-fit .... change my mind ...
---
Can't do that since I have all those keys bound to recording - muting related stuff.
---
damn right, your critics here don't know how far ocd can go
---
I wish CCP starts care about game economy and allow only 1-2 alt accounts someday...
---
I mean
---
Is he wrong
---
I did think that an open all crates would be a good thing having had to do a load of Project Discovery ones a few times myself but after seeing this post I'm now against it.
---
If anyone has this many accounts then they should have to open every single crate they have one at a time.
---
The board of meme overlords will decide its fate
---
You are mistaking language barrier with incompetence.
---
And all who cry ‚Äúnullsec Warfare demands 100 rorqs mining‚Äù don‚Äôt realize that titans aren‚Äôt meant to be as common as frigate lol
---
this. FFS CCP
---
The account brag notwithstanding, my thinking on this is you've made your bed so lie in it.  If this gets onto CCP's bugtracker, I hope it's a low priority enhancement request (i.e. No).
---
Between all the people in my house that play EVE, we have 12 accounts. We haven't opened this event's or last event's boxes. I dread it.
---
More like top micropeeners in eve
---
Hey, lets be honest here.            
---
In a game like EVE you need to have some kind of enemy for this game to be fun and engaging.            
---
Years ago i decided that it will be NCPL - mostly due to fact that those were the biggest and the meanest people around.          
---
Situation have changed, but it does not mean that i have to jump ships and find someone else to 'play against'.             
---
TBH when those 2 groups will die out i will change to their offspring - PH, as i am quite stubborn and old enough to "not like to many changes".
---
I guess 880 is at least double 550 lol
---
Hard to proove botting here, you would have to trigger multiple emergency warps from them and see how they go into warp, where they land, if they avoid easy trap bubbles and if they go back timed.
---
This could as well be just a nerd with a lot of accounts (what is very common in todays meta) that at worst case uses input broadcasting
---
I do not believe that to be the case.
---
They literally left the wormholes unattended during the hours they told us they had them covered.
---
That tells me they do not know what hole control means and that they don't know how to do it.
---
Given their goal of killing a structure, leaving the holes wide open for half the day is definitely counter productive to achieving said goals.
---
At best they are incompetent in the hole control mechanics, at worst they were actively trying to sabotage us.
---

Not really tho. We had the whole grid jammed, we nucked the last dread attempts easily. If not for blues there was a real chance it could have survived
---
Lately?
---
&gt; 59 fucking accounts? Sometimes I wish there was a limit to like 5.
---
First CCP would have to remove their retarded limits on what characters can do, 10 build slots isn't enough, 21 contracts are not enough, 305 buy orders are not enough.
---
Let‚Äôs not forget that keepstars haven‚Äôt just hugely exacerbated supercapital proliferation but also has a lockout effect towards small unaffiliated alliances and corporations.
---
You do realise that if you do not shoot at stuff you do not get registered on the BR right?
---
I really disagree, this is always a cop out. FCs in an alliance set the culture for what's acceptable and what isn't. If people are falling short of what's necessary talk to them in quiet points about fleets why it matters. If people aren't anchoring up maybe you're deciding anchors too late. Maybe try putting it in the MOTD, make sure to remind people when you land out of warp etc.
---
Target calling is an art too and frankly most FCs are pretty bad at it.
---
Rorq multiboxing required? I hope you're not serious. There are *way* better income sources than fucking rorq mining / carrier ratting
---
yeah .... alrightalrightalright
---
Compared to POS UI, Citadels are actually amazing, the old system was the equivalent of a caveman trying to start a fire in a blizzard with primitive tools at hand, the current system is like living in a modern smarthouse where you just clap and the oven is on
---
I have suggested idly the idea of a population cap for systems, perhaps dependent on ihub level and constellation/region capital designation, where e.g. a keep is 5 points, sotiyo 4, fort/azbel/tat is 2 and an astra/ath/rait 1, and region capital/constellation capital/normal system start with 10/17/25 points, maybe upgradeable at 10% extra pop cap per ihub level. 
---
I wonder if the idea of restricting structure anchoring as you suggest could be played with further: perhaps citadels need to be anchored on planets, refineries on moons, and engineering complexes either. Then this could be combined with this pop cap system, to further add trade off in terms of defensibility vs economic power of a system. 
---
It might also serve to focus or define conflict objectives, because a decision could be taken to try and contest the military systems, or break past them to siege the economic ones.
---
Being proud of that is kind of stupid considering sometime soon Eve will look like Serenity. Just a blob of one alliance. Doing nothing forever. Instead of saying hey this isn't conducive to a dynamic.server with variety.

Also, call it backstab if you want, but they did not hold up the end of the agreement they made with us. Regardless of competence or whatever. 
---
It was not until after I was told, by BN-SH CEO, that they were not actually going to do what they originally said they were going to do, that we changed our directive.  
---
It's bad business to lay out terms and then not stick to them. This is the first time Opsec has ever not stuck with the side they started, and it was because of their breach of the agreement we made going in.
---
The income doesn't really matter in null warfare. What matters is the super-capital arms race. To build a crap-load of Titans and Supers, you need a fuck-ton of minerals, which requires a shit-ton of mining. Only reasonable way to keep up with the big bois in null these days is to have armies of Rorquals going at it 24/7.

In a job, change functions internally or your work location, like a different floor in the office. In eve, when in a mega blob like goons, change sigs or where you krab. That is, if you desire to improve your brain functions. Most ppl I know irl rather have everything stable and predictable.

But tapi need goons to beat pamfam right? They could never fight them alone?
---
Sounds like you're in favor of citadels then or capital proliferation.
---
Who?
---
Look angry guy, I actually did say that nullsec sov pvp was made incredibly time consuming and boring by citadels and fozziesov, and referenced all the other posts in the thread elaborating that fact. There are conflict drivers and there are fights around them, but they tend to happen after 2x uncontested structure bashes.  
---
The rest of your pseudo english drivel doesn't deserve a response

Those limits remain for a rea$on sir not sure why though.

Shut up

New scorp looks like it needs to go on a diet.
---
&gt;... and generate isk this way. 
---
*Generated.* Past tense.
---
Eve used to have streaming support built in, it got removed because no one used it, they all just used OBS
---
Panfam made TAPI blue the Imperium.
---
Yes, because they could not win alone with equal numbers
---
Just my personal opinion. I like using citadels more but fozziesov and citadel mechanics were the two main reasons why I left this game in 2018
---
Oh, that's not 7 million's worth of crates. It's 7 billion :O
---
Oh yes, right.
---
That is a broad question. 
---
But Kiki is the new solo hotness, but fairly expensive for what it does.
---
Technically, it's only 4.166% improvement from having cpu IV
---
yes
---
I actually liked these ships. Especially the Imicus :-).
---
Then they decided they were not for asymmetry and wanted them all to look symmetric.
---
Too many people think that wormhole fights have to be max ping heavy armour or they aren't fun, this is so far from the truth and it can be bad for people's wallets and fun.
---
Ah yiss, them days when people didnt know how bad it could get. Remember when eve had outside wallet problems? Oh 2008, such an innocent time.
---
Did exactly that (different third party tool tho) with some statistics between 2013 and 17, analyzed login times, taxes per char and such. We mainly did to calculate srp tax per member, active non care bears had pay less into the srp fund. Found a miningbotter with that, low ticks, very high logon times, exceedingly high income for a miner in 2014.
---
Took me like 20 minutes a week.
---
Sadly they are only imbalanced when Init uses them against HK. Otherwise they appear to be counterable by other entities with caps and half a brain.
---
Can you write it for them?  I hear they pay better than INN.
---
Can't convert CONCORD to Mordu.  They're classified as a pirate faction.
---
boo fucking hoo

New skill, available to *active* omega pilots only.  *Deadspace Gate Manipulation.*
---
"Pirates have figured out how to lock their front doors.
---
Each level of the *Deadspace Gate Manipulation* skill increases the pilots ability to use encrypted deadspace gates.  Skill level one allows access to gate levels 1-2, skill level two allows access to gate level 3-4, etc.
---
Skill prerequisites are Hacking 3, Archaology 3"
---
It's what? It's literally top 5 on my list for new alts.
---
please go ahead and post more memes of fake wars to keep the RMT train rolling for your overlords
---
Not again!
---
weapons timers are a bitch.
---
Or at least there was. If all that corps are leaving, it looks it Will be undeclared PanFam space and they are gonna fill it with renters or small assosiates.
---
But *why*? Why does Eve have this weird meta where a single person must be able to do EVERYTHING in a multiplayer game? Im not gonna blame the players here, **but what if CCP had enforced a single account per customer/machine system from launch**? Wouldn't the players simply have to, idk, work together to achieve their goals?
---
I figure that allowing multiple accounts was a design choice that simply wasn't considered to be a big thing at the time (2003), but I really wonder how the original developers feel about the decision 15 years later.
---
And I *get* the argument that it brings in more money per omega-clone, but **is it healthy for the game**? Wouldn't it be better to have more active players, all engaging in group activities? It'd be more fun for everyone involved, and rather than CCP depending on a certain subset of players with 10+ accounts, they'd be spreading their customerbase a bit more. Look at what happened to Star Trek Online, for example - a very small amount players ("whales") fund the game through microtransactions and other bullshit, but no new features are introduced and new players immediately bounce off.
---
How does it move responsibility? CCP have this data, right? Then they can act on it, right? Did I miss something?
---

So by your reference to this scene in Endgame you saying that Goons are the good guys?

I totally agree, random cyclones, RR domix, nano fight are all cheap way to have fun :)

And they are better for the wallet that losing a 1b heavy armor ships every week
---
Sub for a month, inject, let lapse. 
---
Doesn't address what StainGuy was talking about, though. If the old code just checks if the character has the skill trained instead of checking for having the skill trained &amp; is also, currently in Omega status
---
He used to use lacheisises but even his lacheisis fit just wasn't durable enough in a munnin fleet with ADCs. So obviously we headshot the ship that was providing their fleet with 70km tackle and was the FC ship, over and over again. I distinctly remember a goku fleet where we headshot him twice, killing his snake pod the second time, on the extraction. I never have seen him show up on an alliance scale BR in a lach again, He was FCing a 20 man munnin fleet from a lach last night though, so at small scale the monitors utter uselessness at everything that isn't scanning and having goofy EHP still matters.
---
I'd rather stront check a tower in 10 minutes than shoot a citadel for 24 for the FIRST OF 3 Timers.
---
&gt;There are also some hidden places that you can open using tags or special items.
---
Like a gate to stain?
---
Then ignore it when you log in, and do it from neocom
---
&gt; Beans don't do evictions, never did, never cared, and this wasn't one
---
What was it then?
---
Uhm what. It happened with the first war between tapi and winter co. When panfam decided to move their super fleet over and outnumber them. The only logical move out of that was that they had to find an ally. Since test and goons already had some agreements they were the logical choice. 
---
A 3 year old could have figured that outcome out. Yet they happily did it anyway. 
---
PL is to blame for goons and tapi getting closer together.
---
Remember that. I'm not talking about the ability to directly stream from within the game. I am talking about a mode it allows you to stream while hiding certain UI elements from the viewer, by keeping them visible to yourself.
---
Trained, active and also omega. And offer the character a crossword-puzzle, upside down and a few captchas, while we're at it.
---
I get what you're trying to do here, but there *has* to be a better way. Why don't CCP simply make a query for whatever database they are using, that pulls up a list of characters that have been logged in for 23 out of 24 hours per day and received bounty/mission income for all of those hours? Maybe not even automate the banning action at first, but it'd sure as heck be a great list of accounts to have a human investigate further.
---
That Moa model just gave me a cancer. 
---
I take that back. 
---
*Projectile vomitting after seeing what i suppose is a Scorpion that was snapped in half by a hangar door or something.*
---
Whats that about not being able to defang, please elaborate. #learning
---
Can confirm. Have been on both the same and opposing sides of OPSEC and they are good folk.
---
Looking at the picture the character is probably +5 with them and so can warp in without fear of even that.
---
Legacy outnumbered panfam and winterco im that war
---
Also only pl moved their superfleet, not that it mattered
---
Atleast someone showed up..
---
10/10s already do it, you need leadership V.
---
Can't they just be bought off the Market though? The items that is.
---
Filthy moon miners are killing our moons!  Wont anyone step up to stop them?!
---
Whats next? Mining the planets?  The very stars themselves? How long before theres nothing left?
---
Help us CODE youre our only hope.
---
And you still have to click each one individually, so I'm not sure the point you're trying to make.
---
tapi is also like 3 times the size :thinking:
---
them theyll be forgotten in 4 mouths
---
Yeah it was FC tengus for shield fleets cruiser and up. FC Jackdaw or svipul for shield frig/destroyer fleets. For armor it was FC Legion and FC Confessor respectably. Even with absolute brick tanked ships and implants though I would still get headshot off grid. I was initially against the Monitor because if you could successfully pull of a headshot(Moreso on the Armor fleets frankly) you get rewarded by the hostile fleet in disarray. Frankly though with everything needing to be on grid there are generally better targets to fuck with a hostile fleet then the FC.
---
Its a great book. Many good ideas. Most double plus good
---
I wasn't trying to offer a 'solution' to botting, just clarifying what his concern was. 
---
This code is in the game from long before Omega and Alpha were variables in the game. If it's old enough it might not be easily able to be adapted to serve the purpose suggested in this thread.

Uh it was literally all of Eve vs. TAPI.  Panfam, the Holy League, Winter Coalition, and other small groups all piled on TAPI.

Why U don't say nothing about using kids in that message? LOOK! thers a kid in that convo!

WOW test can actualy win someting thats is def a miracle

i was thinking all thay do is just feed evryone
---
Meanwhile the spy alt in your fleet is on the enemy fleet coms like "yeah the three acnhores are player x, player y, &amp; player z."
---
All three get turned into couds of vapor in the opening seconds of the fight and youre sitting there like "b-but muh edgy reddit post?"
---
That shows - Heads up! Polish shitstormtrooper above.
---
In large grids (a situation where you are fighting over a structure near a gate so there can be a fight on the citadel or on the gate for example) dictors can matter quite a bit without FC interaction if they are good.
---
I give respect to Bob for actually coming out and throwing away a few ships. Certainly made the night more interesting and made the fleets happy with a little bit of content.
---
sure but they'll feed more in dreads than a keepstar is worth and we'll just drop another one
---
Cannon fodder is a primary role, and it can actually be very fun sending a swarm of 20+ tiny ships at people.
---
Tackle and ECM. If done right new guys can gt used to commands, Primaries and contribute to main body.
---
Join one that‚Äôs new-player friendly. Horde, Brave, Karmafleet are all solid options.

They run doctrines that ensure you can contribute from day 1 on.

Not really, would be far easier to just deny access to alphas rather than require players to have a skill trained.
---
oh I'm stupid lol
---
10 newbros in griffins with a few experienced guys mixed in. Can fuck up a logi support group hard. Giving main body a huge advantage.
---
need to undock and use titans to get on zkill though
---
they're also not very agile or fast in warp
---
yea, but he is asking for "true neutral" but then he is asking for what is essentially bluetral?  e.g. "you can have little bralws with neighbors but not mess each other sov/athanors"
---
This morning, in OP's room:
---
"Finally I've finished 1984. Time to announce it to the world."
---
Even Goons could learn a thing or two from this spin lmao.
---
Lets say 20m for the average vni is already rather generous while even a pvp fit super (at least a Hel, can't speak for other ones) can hit the 100m mark. So yes, 5 is far more realistic than 3.
---
I‚Äôll give you a package deal with rolling you in once the fight starts included.
---
I've studied Rick and Morty extensively. Still not high enough IQ to get this joke.
---
At least one keepstar will get burned this war then.  Good Job.
---
&gt;Also only pl moved their superfleet, not that it mattered  
---
During UALX the NC. superfleet was on it's way too but got waterboarded so goons arrived first.
---
It means you can shoot the offensive modules on the structure to disable weapons or ewar (the fangs). The fight then because fleet vs fleet. Winner takes all. After the battle the POS is usually extremely low shield and quick to finish off.
---
I didn't wanna put this on reddit because it just looked like a blob but I might as well explain what happened now. I had a 100 man harpy fleet that was out getting bonus objectives while the eagles and another fleet were hitting the main objective. In response to us hitting 3 jump gates and rfing 12 ihubs at once NC. formed about 12 jackdaws and went to elite pvp the entosis drakes. In response we split the harpy fleet in three and got boat with bombers  to keep doing our objectives while my main part of the harpy fleet just chased NC. system to system till they changed doctrines. After we finished 2 of the jump gates and about half the ihubs NC. undocks in the dreks. This allowed them to save the last gate as i pulled everyone back to deal with them. Initially we refuse the first fight they wanted on d-7 gate in h-w as NC. had instantly dropped triage. The dreks then decided to come next door to MSHD try and kill one of our entosis drakes before it finished the last minute of time on the ihub. NC. had not brought the fax with them to MSHD having left it on a fortizar to jump it back in if needed. This allowed one of my dictors to bubble their fax delaying its ability to jump to them securing our first kill. After this the triage made it to the field but we noticed that that the NC. gang has no tackle besides the Hics so using our command destroyers we continued to boosh parts of the NC. fleet off to be outside of triage range we continued this about 5-6 times till the only thing left was the two apostles and brothabob. With the main objective completed Asher was now not busy enough to care about what our harpys had been doing for the last 30 minutes doing and brought over the eagles to kill the apostles and brothabob for me.
---
god you're edgy

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6_SwXHVsAAIgYG.jpg
---
It was on its way becaus goons were on their way
---
Even goons could learn from a smoothbrain like you getting baited by dumbledore
---
Tackle and EWAR are essential to any operation. In big fleets, if you get the opportunity to jump on top of the enemy fleet commander and slow him down, their *entire* fleet usually slows down, which makes them way easier to shoot for your guys. I personally almost always fly EWAR just because it's hilarious orbiting someone at 80k with a Kitsune and watching them try to fight back, but they can't since they can't target an enemy ship. :)
---
If you want to learn about how you can participate in big fleets, you can always join [Dreddit](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/)! Yesterday afternoon we anchored a bunch of structures in enemy space and shit all over their response fleet and killed about $1000 USD of ships of theirs. It was hilarious.
---
To add:
---
* We have mentorship programs for new players that let you get a jumpstart into what you want to do in EVE. Our mentors are always paired with you based on time zone and interests, so you'll always have someone to play with.
---
* If you don't end up liking big fleet battles, we do small gang stuff in our corp and in our alliance, TEST, all the time. It's super fun. Check out http://www.memefleet.com/ for my favorite fleet.
---
* TEST offers free ships and skillbooks for new players in a program we call TEST_FREE. You're welcome to join and reap the benefits of being a new player by getting free shit and flying around for fun.

Excited for you to come fly with us!

Greetings,
---
 I was wondering if you could shed some light on some questions I have regarding this Op.  You use the word "eviction" throughout your post and I would like to know if this was the intent from the get go. Wrong Hole. leadership has communicated to it's line members on several occasions that it was not an eviction and that the intent was only to shoot as Buccaneers Fort for content and then leave. My question is, can you confirm what the intent of this Op was from the get go? I.E. did all parties involved know an eviction was going on or did it turn into an eviction?
---
Sorry if it seems like a silly question but evictions always have consequences with regards to wh politics and I would really like to get confirmation on what really happened because your story varies to some degree on what has been discussed within our alliance.
---
Thanks in advance
---
Go, Unspoken, GO!!
---
I don't care what anyone says, I support any small group sticking it to the big boys!
---
??? Were you even playing last year or you are just retarded?
---
I can respect that but the NC. not undocking is so stale meme.
---
Geography does not check out
---
Horde moved theirs down as well, we probably outnumbered them in subcaps, but they had us in titans/supers
---
Voltaurself was also in the mix, plus Tri, winterco and Panfam.
---
Feel free to add those numbers up and see what side was largest
---
&gt;but they can't since they can't target an enemy ship. :)
---
wrong. git gud
---
10/10 would shoot redline first again
---
why are you losing heavy armor ships
---
exactly
---
They are countered by comparably sized subcap fleets  not a dozen carriers/dreads lol
---
If my formatting seems poor here, it's because I'm replying from my phone.
---
I use the term eviction loosely in this post. As I said earlier on in the post, the idea was to take out The Buccaneers Fortizar. This was what was conveyed to us as well. Our infil wasn't untill later after they RFed the other structures, so I can't speak for what went on earlier from the first hand perspective. For that, I would refer you to OPSECs AAR.
---
Both Systems essentially play out the same, attackers only attack when they hit critical mass (aka more numbers than defenders can handle) then its a laborious structure grind.  
---
I don't understand why your options are:  
---
A&gt; leave them alone  
---
B&gt; Salt the earth  
---
Its so counter-intuitive, Why are their no raid/pillaging options in eve? Take the shields down and you can dock, combat hacking and you can break into one of the many hangers inside the structure, or even brute force blow the doors option damaging a percentage of the content inside that one hanger.  
---
I saw hope with the ESS being in the game... then nothing. You could do so much, hacking jump gates so hostiles can temporarily use them or even alter the exit location, Hold a fort or keepstar hostage and take control of its revenue streams, be able to heist the minerals taken by the refineries and so on.
---
This does not show all active titans. Some of us just got our Titans and haven't killed anything with it yet.
---
What is runaway inflation for 200 Alex.
---
I think there is also a Fleet skill that is required for some gates, I could be mistaken.
---
People also use them as extra insurance should they need to move a very expensive pod somewhere. 
---
I have a fit that is &lt;2s warp and also has 30k ehp. 
---
Makes it virtually impervious to smart bombers, and adds that extra safety. 
---
Also it has a small amount of storage 37m3 or something so if you need to go quickly gets a bling module or two that you need and can‚Äôt wait for it‚Äôs great for that also. 
---
Great for moonwalking through the smartbomb camps on the way to a deployment also.
---
Dozens!
---
You feel like? We're literally an autocracy.
---
nice theorycrafting you do there, now imagine being in a group where you literally have to lose all ships to have nobody capable of doing anchor anymore. Also imagine being in a group with actually SOME recruitement standards like full esi of everything, and being in a group where it takes more than an Alpha Account to infiltrate (so not Horde or Goons)
---
At the time they were a thing i wasn¬¥t involved in bashing of Death- and Dickstars. I only ever once was logi for a Dickstar bash. It was the most dickish thing ever but i prefer it over 1000 Keepstar killmails.
---
Can you give me a fit for gila, just for t4?  I have seen blinged out gillas for t5, can you do t4 in something around 1b/1,5b ?
---
U WOT MATE?
---
But then the POSes at worst are still about equal or better to citadels, considering you don't have to sit through a DPS cap for a defined minimum amount of time.
---
Are you on 23x7 to see this?
---
Yea, OP can get fucked.
---
Solid shitpost.... Take your upvote.

We have no issues with new bros. it really is ability to learn and work towards doctrines. 
---
They can be very useful and we fly low sp doctrines usually.
---
Have you ever tried to 1v2 a ship and a kitsune? Shit is jamming you so fast that you can't target anything for more than half a second.
---
Yea when I saw PL moving down it was pretty much given tapi had to blue goons...I dont think PL cared
---
Not really, it just checks if you have Polaris V
---
Ignorance such as believing Goons have been saying Delve is safe?
---
Let the goo flow!
---
Getting into cormorant, caracal and ferox doctrine doesn't take too long. Plus most corps have a low sp versions of t1 dps ships.
---
m8ey, ecm doesn't block you from targeting the ecm ship anymore.

You have no idea how many panfam are elated that  we wont have sov for awhile. Let's go do shit again.
---
Train into a Maulus and feast on the tears when your enemy can't lock past 10km.
---
To put a brand new pilot into tackle is wrong imo, they will just die. Flying a ceptor well takes a lot of practice.
---
Almost 900+ Million on the markets if I am not mistaken. It's really ridiculous Mordus ships are twice expensive as other pirates factions.
---
I guess I just never look. I flew a maraurder for months before I realised they do an animation and change a little when bastion is activated. Never looked.
---
AoM has a large presence in HS caldari space in the Osmon constellation. Or at least they did as of acouple of weeks ago when i was last up there. Ive seen them in other places as well.  Theres a pretty good chance this pic is from highsec.
---
All you can do is your own personnel best*
---
The 6 remaining players wouldn't make a terribly interesting game.
---
I agree, sort of; however, I think I will keep citadels just so I don't have to have multiple super parking alts, or have to coffin my main in a super/titan.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs how everyone pronounces it, so it works. Can‚Äôt wait for them to host Eve Vangcouver some day.
---
Golden rule of internet : Nothing is sacred. 
---
If you can't stand it, shut up and HTFU ffs
---
I'm trying to figure this out for myself as well. It's strange that "hole control" "door stoppers" and general eviction practices were used for an "Op" that's not being called an eviction.
---
All you can do is your own personnel vest
---
But what is the likelihood of running that many barges without input multiplexing? Honest question.
---
ahemahemTECHNICALLAY  
---
no offense i've brought this upon myself
---
Something needs to be done about structure proliferation. Either attackers need a lot more control regarding when timers come out, or there needs to be some kind of hard limit on how many you can anchor per system/constellation/region.
---
It's not like that keepstar is gonna drop a few titans anyway.
---
bro, i am running low on spod and it is beginning to show...
---
could you hit me up? :)
---
Low sec belt ratter here, yeah they are very rare. Havent seen a barghest in the last 2 months ratting daily.
---
You do need subcap numerical advantage...
---
And missile ship
---
That BR is a little fucked up because It‚Äôs pulling the guys when they were flying Jackdaws. So in all actually, when we took the last fight with Dreks, there wasn‚Äôt very many of us. Way less than 40

What this man said, normally every Corp has alpha fitting alternatives for different doctrines

Nice epic poem.

Saying that, I'm still always surprised when someone calls something their alt saw or I try and talk to someone else and it's the alt of the dude I'm in fleet with. I may be mildly retarded.

Tackle, ECM and LOGI! 
---
Logi is easy to skill into and it is fun flying around and desperately trying to lock friendly ships before they explode. :)
---
Your seeing them used because it's common practice when sieging any structure inside of a wormhole. An eviction refers to the complete burning of someone's wormhole. Killing a structure like a fortizar, you still perform hole control, doorstop entrance points, and use tactics you would use during any siege or defense op.
---
this is true
---
You say that and we‚Äôve had a Corp of like 20 people that we can‚Äôt evict since they have anchored like 66 structures in 2 of our systems and we don‚Äôt have people during their timezone, AUTZ üòÇ

I remember how IRC in their war vs RA (who had spyes in IRC to high heaven) and then old NC (same issue) dealt with this. No one knew the FCs characters in fleets. ON they would have their Main's name, who would be docked in station, if online at all. FC meanwhile would be in one of the hundreds BS', but tanked to the teeth, just in case. SOmetimes another alt or a replacement ship would be in the system as well. Back then "anchor" wasn't exactly a tactic, but here comes in SNUFFs experience - everyone knows our FCs. Hence they hardly ever anchor. We often have 3 primary anchors, who switch as soon as needed, and replacement anchors would be called by FCs if required. One thing you cannot do is FC, anchor and be easily visible all at the same time. That is a recepy for a leaderless fleet for sure.

Once you find you feet in eve you have to set your goals, "I want to do X in the alliance" is a great way to not feel like just a line member.
---
I'd be intrigued at that. I'm not sure how you'd do it without making it feel forced and unfair. But interesting.
---
I do not think it is really. Currently, because of the ammo bottleneck, the primary thing you are getting out of fitting faction guns and launchers to ships is fitting space for really tight fits. 
---
In fact, I would argue, there is not a whole lot of demand for faction guns and launchers because people cannot use the tech 2 ammo in them, and thus if they fit them they lose out on both the tech 2 ammo bonus and their guns specialization skill damage bonus. 
---
When the patch comes, faction guns will almost be ridiculously OP. The prices *will*, in my estimation, go up. 
---
Tech 2 ammo usage, on the other hand, might go up slightly; however, currently 99.9% of people who can use tech 2 ammo are fitting tech 2 guns and launchers are 99.9% of their ships and using that ammo. What will change is not ammo usage, but the fact that the bonused ammo will now be usable on the bonused guns.

Pretty sure it's an intended feature, not a bug. For example, you need leadership V to go into a Blood Raider 10/10 because the crew of your ship (yes, canon says ships have crews aboard them) is too terrified of the Blood Raiders to go in otherwise.

Here's an idea: in the attacker's primetime, the attacker attacks the structure and does X damage to it.  In the defender's primetime, they have to rep X damage to save the structure.  If they can't the structure is in the next stage of reinforcement (shield, armour, hull).

Anybody had this idea before?

And it did run to May 20th.  Most people just ASSUMED they would be able to claim during the 20th day-21st downtime; in reality, you had until 20th downtime, so last days claim was 19th OR 20th, not both.

No it isn't.  There's a damage cap.  There are vulnerability timers.  Let's not have any damage cap.  You can thwack it with as much or as little as you want, or maybe just enough to overcome any passive repair over the timer.  
---
If you come with 500 Titans and do 500 Titan's worth of damage and the other guy doesn't bring 4,000 faxes to rep it back up, it goes into the next state.
---
The attacker can attack it whenever he wants, i.e. in his TZ.  The defender can rep it whenever he wants, i.e. in his TZ.  All the defender has to do is rep more damage than the attacker could be bothered to do.
---
You could claim final reward on 5/20, the math checks out.  People made a poor assumption that they would be able to claim on the post DT 20th to 21st DT

Yea but Boris and the Bois will be

It at least makes it a little more balanced between attackers/defenders.

What was wrong with their combat/reinforce system apart from unnecessary gunner skills, a minor issue at most?  I'm aware they were RSI-inducing cancer to set up and maintain, but that's not what I'm talking about.  A system with the citadel "backend" for setup and living in and POS combat mechanics would be very nearly perfect.
---
So, you didn't apply enough damage to it to overcome the defender's future reps, and you didn't disrupt the defender's repping.  I see no problem here.
---
You pilot in a quite unique way, but this is not great. It's just HG Snaked Garmur in lowsec vs idiots.

dont even need that if. just remove supercaps and replace the jump fatigue restrictions on regular caps

That would be the fc multi-boxing monitors. All the cool kids are doing it.

Titans that don't undock can't be counted though.
---
George Orwell is disappointed in you.
---
We're talking about scenarios where the defender does not defend the structure whilst the attacker is attacking it, i.e. to hold the field to stop him from attacking it.   And we're talking about scenarios where the attacker does not attack the defender whilst he's repping it.  Of course it's fucking boring.  What do you want, fireworks rigs?
---
In reality Fleet A will attack the structure, Fleet B will defend the structure.  If Fleet B doesn't because it's not his TZ, he can "defend" it by repping it in his TZ.  If Fleet B doesn't interact with his repping to prevent it that's his problem.

lmao, why lie about clear facts. If you're going to make a narrative do one that can't be checked on dotlan
---
Stront coasting / surprise out-of-timezone attacks and moon limits were really good things for poses and the complete lack of both on citadels is by no means a small contributing factor to their issues.
---

I like the OPs suggestion.  Structure masturbation is not a way to get content back in the game.
---
Some toons are specifically set to KOS by the checker. I know this because I am, and I've changed to corps that are not.
---
Its a very convenient method. I've found that a large amount of my time in a Site is just travel time. More so in sites where there might be 30+km between cans. By dropping a Bookmark as you're warping in, you can turn a 10min site into a 4min one. 
---
That being said though, if there's only 10-15km between your cans, it might be quicker to just burn to them with a MWD. I still like to drop one down anyway though, that way if I've warped in at the middle of a Site, I don't have to worry about burning back to the other side once i've finished with one.
---
It wasn't an alliance effort. Just a Corp with a dream.
---
66 structure bashes sounds likely exactly what an AUTZ alliance wants....
---
Calm down Jamyl Sarum
---
&gt;Implying TIKLE was capable of doing that
---
Next time mayble they'll let you FC something bigger than Harpys Mr. I-FCd-a-Supercap-Moveop.
---
&gt; The fleet members would generally groan
---
People literally loved coming on my pos saving or shooting ops because I kept the loose and fun, and because I entertained them. 
---
Citadels are trash
---
so all the new system would do is waste the defenders time without changing anything.
---
From perspective of someone doing the job on the other side of fun (getting intel/spy info, keeping alt list for all kind-of important FCs up to date, having ship scanner and doing quick calculation who can we actually attempt to headshot) Monitor basically killed this specific fleet role completely, even further devaluating having good intel and spy network set up. And for me finding the most effective way to dismantle entire enemy fleet at the start of a fight was one of the most rewarding experiences in my entire history of playing EVE - being single person able to swing the outcome of a fight this hard.
---
&gt; As a final point, if you think the Monitor shouldn't exist, then names being displayed on the overview also shouldn't exist.
---
Overview applies standings too, so it would require much deeper changes in how overview entries are displayed - even now Goons have all hostile FCs set at -10 while all other reds are at -5, making it easily noticeable who the usual FCs in local/on grid are. This would just be the go-to way for headshotting, set standings and target by standings. But as general idea of denying easy effortless way of telling and headshotting FCs this sounds good, as long as it leaves a way around with enough effort and preparation.
---
the point is if you don't rep it then it goes to the timer - so you're going to have enough reps since it'll be uncontested since you just do it when the guy who reff'd it is asleep.
---
Lolol this is the perfect. I'm pretty in the libertarian purple on the political compass. But I am a statist through and through in this game. I don't mind paying my taxes at all....because I know big daddy gov will protecc

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with any big orgs (like Panfam) as long as it doesn‚Äôt push people out of the game. What‚Äôs best for the game are good pvp fun ‚Äî but at the end of it you want to be able to gf and if they are just pure carebears ‚Äî strike up a conversation.

I killed someone, in-game, the other day on patrol and realized he was a couple months old. I chatted with him, paid 10x his ship and during the brief conversation I found out he knew php and could help with our dev needs. I then lined  him up with a corp that could teach him how to survive in null. I find these types of guys all over the region, they don‚Äôt want to join null politics but do want to learn.
---
are you having a stroke? seize once for yes twice for no.
---
also remember that scanners allow to move a small fleet faster through wormholes.
---
Sometimes, people need help for some tasks likes salvaging after a super, moving cans in a mining place using miasmos, getting a cyno on a specific point, having a jaming ship ready to save a farmer.

Then why they posted on polish FB EVe group, they do evictions for fun.
---
you are correct sir!
---
I think it's too late now but I think Citadels (Astra, Fort, Keep) should have been the sort of base station then depending on the size of the base you could add ECs or Refineries onto them.  They would then be blown up if the "base" was blown up.   Then bring back moon anchoring.  Yes you could lock out a system like POSes could but that was an interesting mechanic IMO.  As it is now however you need way too many structures.

When this happens you either messed up keeping proper opsec, screening recruits or even more, given that spies for this specific group actually ended up in that fleet. Then it's fair - paying for mistakes made much earlier.
---
If you say so
---
33\*
---
&gt;We need to go back to one structure per moon.
---
So, your plan is to make it impossible to anchor an offensive citadel.  'Cause every competent alliance will just fill their systems with Ratairus and Astras to hit the cap.
---
Also, there's a shitload of moons in a whole lot of systems.  Grinding 100 POSes wasn't exactly a good time, but it also wasn't practical for your enemy to stage out of them, so you could just ignore them until they ran out of fuel.
---
Citadels have basically infinite fuel bays, and even the smallest ones can be an effective staging point.  So now you have to kill all 100 citadels before you can move forward with your offensive.

I feel like you could have gotten better fights by roaming Geminate (BWF-ZZ is literally 8 jumps from LXQ) than you would get by bashing NCdot renter structures and sov... 
---
Unfortunately, when you start taking out sov and structures, you get seen as a threat, so naturally panfam was gonna respond by attacking you. I don't think I've seen a PH offensive stratop get FEWER than 150 people, especially when it can form up in the staging system, so I don't think they could have avoided blobbing you tbh. And of course, working with goons near panfam supers is gonna get you blobbed out of existence.
---
It's just an unfortunate escalation issue. PH is incapable of attacking you without blobbing you, and if they don't blob you, goons would have blobbed them, so that basically made it impossible for y'all to get a good fight :/
---
Ah well, at least it sounds like you had some fun. I remember y'all being very willing to take fights, hopefully you keep that up wherever you go next.

No doubt there will be some renting going on but would definitely support lifting up these small orgs in some fashion like a market for residents.
---
Yay!
---
There was something fun about kiting a POS for 3 hours so it exited when you wanted it to not them. There is a lot about pre-citadel Eve that is missing now and honestly I don't think it's a good thing.
---
Fair enough.
---
Nice spin. Someone ran the (active characters count)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8y8ker/world_war_what_what_are_the_numbers/] in the early days of the war:
---
**Legacy**
---
36,509 total
---
99 titans
---
296 supers
---
**PanFam+GotG+WinterCo+SkillU+Trumpy**
---
53,770 total
---
582 titans 
---
1,327 supers
---
We were drastically outnumbered, especially in supers and titans. If you remove NC and GotG from the numbers (because they stayed north) we're on par with total characters but dramatically outnumbered with titans/supers. This led to having our ferox fleets camped in by super fleets.
---
Then we called in the Imperium:
---
48,256 total
---
459 titans
---
1008 supers

That's what I've had trouble with these last few years. Do I dislike things because they're bad, or because I'm nostalgic? I'm starting to reach the conclusion that it's both, but leaning heavily towards the "things are bad" side.

A lot of the 'broken' mechanics they've fixed or iterated on were actually really charming in their own way. When you have the people who are benefitting the most from unlimited citadel spam saying it's broken, you know you've got a problem.

They just need to give no warning and declare it so, so nobody gets an advantage. After 6 months everything will be back to normal. Just had to stop the bleeding.
---
Yeah, I said it sort of as a joke, but perhaps there could be sort of a whole cat and mouse setup behind it. Perhaps base it on a mix between activity per ship over time plus density of fleet? Maybe even have them stack over time (weeks) in a area based on activity.    
---
Essentially make it such that the more ships you run and more work they do has a higher chance of summoning a response fleet, maybe then setting up more of a cap ship strategy?

on small ships a 1% reduction in sig radius actually means a 1% increase in EHP vs missiles, and more when you have a small sig vs turrets (increases evasion by 1%).

for turret here is the gain for 0.94 sig reduction, in terms of EHP %, WRT the ratio of evasion/tracking

Right right, but it would make the spam-citadels-and-chill strategy less of an option for defenders.   
---
I.e. Defenders would need to invest the player-hours to rep the 20 Raitarus that got reffed. The attackers can actually make progress unless actively defended.   
---
Player hours is the ultimate resource in EVE organizations.
---
A tapir is an odd-toed ungulate?
---
Would they turn me away cause I already tried and left once? I was looking for something much different back then.
---
This still could be improved by making it harder to switch timers. Pick a vulnerability slot, then you're stuck with it and it should be costly / need effort to switch to another slot.
---
This is a very interesting problem in EVE. I'm curious if CCP will ever come up with a strategy to resolve this. 
---
Here is my wild idea: timezone regions.  Different parts of the eve universe have different timezone timers.
---
No, you would not be turned away. We have lots of folks who leave for a period and then return. But we do have special requirements for returning agents. Go to our recruitment channel to learn more.
---
There's no official primetime.  The attacker attacks whenever he wants.  The defender reps whenever he wants.  The only "timer" is the defender has x hours to rep before it blows up.  Kind-of like smouldering and then blowing.   The conflict driver is: (1) the initial assault, is the defender able to hold grid and prevent the attacker from doing too much damage to the structure? (2) the repping: is the attacker able to prevent the defender's attempts to rep the structure?  If he can't hold grid to do it, he'll lose the timer.
---
IDK, it seems kind-of like the old system where reps were a thing and the new one, where TZ are a thing.
---
Because a Client with a certain structural mind has something to do with Performance and graphics they use.
---
Matter of fact the Unreal Engine 4 is indeed VERY much open for mobile and PC sind the whole engine got ported to Mobile aswell.
---
they weren't.  we just had twice as many pilots in eve so there was more content.  If we went back to POS mechanics there wouldn't be any more fights since we are all blutral to each other.
---
This idea is pretty ludicrous when you think about it. Never gonna happen.
---
The game would have died 10 or more years ago of they limited everyone to one account. The people who play Eve are not the type that would actually work well together on that scale.
---
Circle-of-Who?
---
Or just fuck timers off altogether? Don't defend your shit, it gets blown up. That would drastically reduce structures in the game.
---
Hey thanks for the nice constructed response.
---
We did frequently roam Phorde space, but we snagged a rorq a few months back and got a similar response by having a Panfam blob of supers and titans on our staging citadel in SAH- the next day. :shrug: I think some agreement was made reluctantly on our end (blue donuts are bad for the game..)
---
We didn‚Äôt stage out of LXQ, just set it as capital for the higher ADM. BOT was always closer, and to be fair for a while they would undock and fight. It‚Äôs when they stopped we had to take actions to force them to (shooting structures, entosis, etc).
---
Our guys don‚Äôt play for idle meaningless content. We like objectives, we like a narrative, we like a goal. 
---
Hindsight, I don‚Äôt think we would do anything different. We succeeded in our Spire campaign. Systems that hadn‚Äôt seen sov changes since 2013 were destroyed, ADMs were reset, salt was gathered, idiots were scammed (something like 50-60bil?), structures destroyed, good fights were had. Our members were excited to log in.
---
MER showed a reduction in bounties of 1T isk since the campaign started in Spire and Malpais, not to mention the moons that weren‚Äôt mined, etc. We killed every Ihub in the region, and I think every TCU (I may be wrong. Who cares about TCUs). Many azbel forts sotiyos and countless smaller structures. 
---
We don‚Äôt really care about our sov. It was there for content. Content happened. Unspoken never expected to live there for as long as we did. 18+months I think? It started as a campaign vs the DRF and turned into us owning the region alongside Just A Game and fighting the Prothean Alliance, who we will always have an incredible amount of respect for.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, we will still be seen around creating chaos somewhere, and will still be seen frequently around the drone lands. So many really bad entities just moved in, and the existing ones think it‚Äôs safe now, like the BOT fleet we dunked last night :-)
---
O7
---
Seriously tho
---
I'm not sure about that.  You'll end up with the biggest TZ pillocking about in their peak trashing everything.  Got to give them at least a shout at defence.
---
But they still need 300 more to have "fair fights".
---
Not as far as I know, no. Some time back though, the fitting screen gave me a similar problem which went away after I repaired the module. It shouldn't have made any difference at all, but there you are.
---
Odd thought, but what about adding a mercenary option to war allies? Buy a corp of "sellships" for a period of time and war goals based in the appropriate time zone?
---
If you think POSes weren't content creator then you should think outside of sov null. Me and my corp were holding a lowsec pocket for nearly 2 years and we permanently cleaned out neutral POSes out of our pocket and generated timers, content and fight out of it.
---
Honestly, can't the biggest dick swingers still just trash everything? It doesn't matter what system you put in place, the corps with the most pilots in space have the most money/ can apply the most damage. If a big alliance wants a structure gone, they will make it happen eventually.
---
To negate the effect of structure spam, the mechanic "if structure is reinforced, then every other structure in system gets a debuff" is a good concept. That can't be limited to your own corp/alliance, as then you would use alt corps. So, how big a problem it would be that the attacker can anchor a structure and reinforce it? I would presume it isn't a problem.
---
E.g. as attacker, anchor 10 fortizars and reinforce them so it's easier to attack defenders keepstar. Would that be ok?
---
I hear yo  . _. '
---
I still don't get it, please explain it to me, i must simply be retarded.
---
Personally I find that more realistic than someone running 50 odd accounts
---
provide the source material please.
---
Now if they had a new overview loaded automatically for new players they would have something.
---
POSes were a far better system. We tried to tell them but they didn't listen.
---
Like when you put in these structures with timers, it makes it easy ot defend but it also makes the game stagnant.
---
Again, a select all button would allow you to just pick the ones you want.
---
Can you make one for unanchor structure
---
i doubt it, i don't know anyone irl that plays eve, other than people i've met at fanfest.
---
Yes.  They can now can't they.  The idea is to make it slightly less like cancer.  I'm not sure what the point of 3 timers is, for example.  And if the defender (NCPL) wants to drop 500 fax on his keepstar to rep the damage Goons did yesterday, well, they're not tethered whilst repping so that's a bit of a risk for them isn't it.
---
This game is extremely silly.  I can't think of anything else.
---
but the little guy can now attempt to defend his astrahus from the 2000 people trying to attack him, *WONT SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE LITTLE GUY*
---
Being less selective =/= being better, you should know, being in one of the more picky INIT corps...
---
Its way funnier to have NCPL fold up faster than  a cheap lawn chair getting sat on by a 600 pound man.
---
Have you ever heard an Astrahus scream?  Structure bash for enough hours and you can.
---
I would be a fan if they brought this back. We need small gang targets.
---
That seems like it would be unfairly punishing to single-timezone alliances that hold sov.
---
now why does that not surprise me? no, no, don't trip over yourself trying to answer, it's rhetorical.
---
One of my favorite memories is [after this fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-TIctNgIHA), killing 6/10 of their ships in a frigate, I got called a pussy for "always running away".
---
I to I'm guilty of this.... "but if you do it like that the weapons will not absorbe so much heating" ... "true but they will be symetric" :P
---
and large groups have lots of players who can/will take it in turns, and the small guy will get burned out after a few days.
---
it'll just end up as another thing that forces small groups to join big groups or gtfo.
---
if a small group has a system with 10 moons, they're still going to have 10.. whatever the fuck it is that mines moons, anathors? so will a large group. the thing is the large group has  more players to rep the structures and share the workload to prevent burnout.
---
imagine getting home from work each day to find out that some dick has reinforced your structure, again, so every day from now until forever you spend all your free time repping structures? that's bullshit. at least in a bigger org you'd only have to do it on say, a thursday, as your corp/alliance members can do the other 6 days of the week.
---
Yeah I'm strictly small gang or solo. I don't have structures that I use at all. NPC stations all the way. I'm sure my Corp has a structure somewhere... Not sure.
---
Have a chance that when you have a structure in vulnerability mode that NPC pirates will warp in a large fleet to besiege it. If they succeed the first window they'll return for the second one. Make it logistically impossible for corps to spam a million citadels if dozens of them are being attacked every day. Also it would force corps to put their vulnerability windows at a time where they can form up to fend off the attack. 
---
You can make strength of the besieging fleets base upon security status of the system, standings with the NPC pirates or if you wanna make it full anti spam make it base upon how many structures your corp has. 
---
I could see some much smaller corps getting high standings with Blood Raiders for example and then attacking Goonswarm structures by helping the NPC fleet take out a structure. 
---
This is what I hope Tri invasion will bring, I hope they destroy citidels in the systems they invade. Maybe the big big ship could have a death laser to delete some spam from my overview.
---
Given how many titans there are now and how watch list was changed, you can't watchlist the 3-5 titans that $ALLIANCE uses for bridging anymore. Yes you can locate pilots that have titans, but that's like dozens and they can dock them so there's no guarantee you located them where their titan is.
---
but switching timers isn't the issue - the issue is them just being in non-overlapping time zones.
---
so npcs to attack structures for you? i'm sure that won't become a solved problem in less than 7 days rendering it a dead and useless feature.
---
CCP needs to have more ways to keep you skilling at maximum, Omega rate... You present Exhibit H.
---
Been in Brave for about 4-5months and just recently I figured out that tickle existed lol..
---
if you don't want an answer, why reply?
---
that wasn't rhetorical, i'm genuinely curious if there's a reason or if you're just retarded.
---
Somebody show test how to not be risk averse.
---
I do they same when boom some new bro Explorer. That is cool.
---
What happened with UnSpoken and PanFam is different. It's was a small independent group, droped with Titans, supers and absurd numbers.
---
If you do things like that, isnt rare that groups like them join side to imperium. They were neutral, and NCPL choose to force UnSpoken to Goonies side. As they choose in past mess with TAPI, and so on. Now EvE need a big Coalition to stop Goons. But the half of the game that isnt Goons, is busy fucking each other. 
---
EvE needs a Lot of "UnSpokens" work their way togheter to negate the number adv of Goons. Behaviors like NCPL only push the smalls indepents to the wrong side of the War.
---
Lmao.
---
keep trying friend. 
---
From your source: 
---
&gt;kindly linked by [/u/Tsedd](https://www.reddit.com/u/Tsedd) \- **I think these numbers understate the Legacy + Imperium side a bit,** and they include alliances 
---
Active titans and supers =/= supers you can form on a max hype ping.
---
As for total numbers: 
---
Legacy 36509
---
PANFAM+Winter+Trumpy+Holy league: 36700
---
Why mix in gotg? they were never involved, stop adjusting numbers to fit your narrative. 
---
If you are going to adjust them, remove the ones that didn't deploy. NC, and MC. Horde didn't deploy but moved a SIG, so lets keep them there. 
---
Legacy: 36509
---
\#ALLOFEVETM: 30796
---
Test loves their victim complexes, to bad you stopped being the small guy years ago
---
Savage
---
Thank you üôèüèΩ
---
good.
---
Tackle and ewar are easy, useful, and profitable. One scram usually equals a dead enemy in a fleet fight. A maulus or Griffin used against an enemy dps ship makes them pretty impotent.
---
Inner Hell still. Smaller groups of experienced players evict bear holes/Indy holes for isk
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one
---
Can't really call someone that had ties with Adversity as bring selective amigo. Also, STK isn't that picky.. you just have to pass the adult beverage test. Duh.
---
Can you punish something that does not exist, tho?
---
I can't remember any relevant single-tz sov-holding alliance that is not a part of multi-tz coalition
---
Excuse me sir but you are way off base. Middle-aged or not, nerds don't play in rock bands
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
It'll always be the case that people in different timezones won't interact much. But AFAIK the main complaint about 4am timers is the fact that for players in the same TZ, the defender can switch their timer to 4am on a Wednesday and pretty much kill any attacker desire to contest these timers without even undocking.
---
More a question than a confirmed bug..and what's an EBR number?
---
1h of pve per week for like 2-5b is good enough for me.
---
Is that what you tell yourself mate? Is this what makes you feel elite as your chew on spod while your wife gets bodied in bed by her 3 boyfriends?
---
NCPL made the only logical choice in this situation since it's simply numerically impossible for them to fight the goon titan blob. So I guess enjoy those blue balls and structure bashes like your wife enjoys Jerome, Hector, and George.
---
yeah, which you can't remove or anyone that's actually playing in that TZ gets fucked, hard.
---
Acceleration gates on Novice plexes prevent anyone from warping in with something bigger than a frigate, but could something bigger eventually reach it if they burn in the same direction as the plex?
---
aww you cant link someone how to self destruct when they are tackled
---
Bug report. Did you file one?
---
NCPL have always been the big bad supercap blob, it never was "grr goons".
---
\*golf claps in background\*
---
I am the little guy. I still want this. It would actually help me, not hurt me.
---
they have a maximum target range. Also they just make your ship start targeting at the end of the cycle. Plus they make you target whatever is targeting you.
---
your parents didn't have any children that lived, did they?
---
CCPLEASE FIX THE GODDAMN MACH HARDPOINTS WHAT THE FUCK

well you've demonstrated that you're retarded, that answers that one.
---
What was going on with Caldari ships, just random limbs everywhere. That one-pincer-scorpion makes me sad.
---
Well i recently quit giving all my stuff away and now play on a new account. I fly a scythe or tackle atron and that is helpful. Although you will die a lot.
---
flairbait fam.
---
But then every 1337 PvPer from across the cluster would come to FW just to try to get on citadel KMs because they're easier to kill. If it's failing somewhere you have to change it everywhere.
---
The problem is CCP doesn't care about you unless you're in sov null. Hell, even the high sec war dec mechanics only changed after null alliances started complaining about it - high seccers had been complaining for years and were just ignored.
---
CCP sees null as it's cash-cow. It's where the whales with 23 accounts are. It's where the big battles that are pretty much the entirety of their marketing strategy come from. It's also not a very big part of the game overall yet it gets the most of their resources. That is why the game is dying.
---
If someone roam in your pocket. use a VNI,fited with neutra and bulked, try to be tackled on gate or somewhere. keep yours friends not for away.

Its interesting that structure proliferation has again resurfaced as an issue, while goons are currently looking at months of structure bashing as their primary content source.

oh nubee, were you even around in 2015-2016?
---
A better question is why don't you have CPU Management V?
---
Not NPC's, other player corps.
---
What is eve time based on?
---
The reason that they are auto target is because they can be fired without targets being locked. However, if a target is locked it will go to the designated Target instead of a random target that is determined by FoF (Friend or Foe)
---
I think those are universal reddit "rules" ?! 
---
It was from hazy memories anyway.
---
Ah quit your bitching and zoom out like the rest of us.
---
just to remind you, you wanted FOB structures, you got them.
---
&gt; If you remove NC and GotG from the numbers (because they stayed north) we're on par with total characters but still dramatically outnumbered with titans/supers.
---
Gee, it's almost like I specifically addressed that point.
---
I think you'd have to be hitting the koolaid pretty hard (or not have been present at all) to suggest that the underrepresented Legacy numbers came even close to making up difference in the titan and super gap. Stop being a salty idiot.
---
Well, if it‚Äôs your version then good. But to be honest : I use the upvote for things I like, and downvotes for the opposite.
---
whats wrong about it? Why should you be able to evict everyone? Space is for all, not just the TCU holders.
---
Even so those randomizations all have a set limit. I can say that I want a command to happen and have it set a random time between 250 and 2500 milliseconds between issuing commands And it will appear as though It's different... But it isn't... The data is definitely there if CCP has a way to search for it.
---
That was clearly racist. \*\*KICK\*\*
---
You replied to a bot fyi
---
I think you‚Äôre not seeing the bigger picture, you can‚Äôt deal with 20 guys, how are you gonna deal with people like Goons, Test or PH. This is what‚Äôs gonna end Eve, there‚Äôs no reason to pvp other than killmails.
---
I use 30 covetors without input broadcasting, not easy but possible :)
---
Think he's talking about the high-slot module that automatically targets ships within a certain range that are locking you, and increases your total locked targets.
---
I think it's possible in theory;  HOWEVER, it's important to note that bypassing acceleration gate ship restrictions is [considered an exploit](https://www.eveonline.com/article/exploit-notification).
---
I'll give him this; he isn't the dumbest shitposter on reddit, but he better hope they don't die

I've noticed that they do not play the locking animation, but if you wait targets should appear
---
Extremely defensive, aren't we?
---
Interesting, thanks.

Tell me who can, and who would be willing to go through countless hours of structure bashing thousands of structures?
---
same
---
Wait you are not only unanchoring your stuff but also biomassing your chars?

Actually I never thought about that. Good point about asset safety
---
But the advert didn't say that, they told me on may the 4th that I'd be able to claim all the rewards.
---
2984?
---
I think the non-moon mining structures should be limited to 1 per planet. Must be within .2 au of a planet.
---
What if you could skip the timers by paying real money, just like Clash of Clans.
---
I'm right though
---
I lost a 100m ship to that undock invite-trick in 1DQ1 not that long ago.  Character shared a last name with a friend, must have been both randomly gen'd or something.

Wasn't even mad.  Fuck me for falling for it.  I probably got a better laugh out of it than they did.

---
Been writing a post on this but will put it here anyway: in an age when caps aren't special or limited to big null blocs anymore, damage caps also hurt the little guy they were meant to help.  If you couldn't flashform 100 dudes to defend a timer, you weren't going to be able to do it in 20 minutes either.  But on the flip side, you can't drop 3 dreads and wreck a bloc raitaru in your space; they DO have time to show up with 10x the dudes and fuck you.
---
Bring back stront timers--so there's an organizational cost for running too many structures--make it so you have to go out and rep armor and hull (again, so you can't just fringe your massive territory with fuck you citadels) and remove damage caps except on fueled forts, sotiyos and keepstars, and this game is suddenly in a much better place.
---
For bonus points, they could also exponentially increase fuel costs for every cit in a system, remove tether and shields from low power cits, and disallow hostile militias to drop cits without system control in FW space...  holy fuck are citadels broken.
---
Can't undock if you have no place to dock in the first place.

Yeah no one would ever fight another war if they make keepstars drop super loot.
---
You dont often need to target anything to vni rat.  Very seldom there will be a holdout frig or two that targeted you but never shot at you.  In these cases your drones wont auto agro and you'll need to target them.
---
Stain isn't that awful - sure it's far away from Jita, but it's reachable with JFs by going just NPC stations. On the other hand, trying to move into NPC Delve is whole new level of experience.
---
I don't know. I did it about three months ago... although memory is fuzzy. Getting that ping at the center of the sun was a PITA.
---
Recruitment and literally taking any mongoloid with a detectable pulse are two different things.
---
I mean in PB especially you're still running the risk of having dreads or carriers dropped on you if you fly something like a marauder or piss the wrong people off.  But yeah look on zkill, you see a half dozen 5-20 man fights every day.  With a pocket of NPC stations right in the center, it's one of the last places a small group could deploy for content.

the same day you get that lowsec gate to stain

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you dont go through goonswarm areas or use racist slurs. BTW, Taiwan is still Chinese territory, it says so on their passports. Even UN refused to recognize fake "republic of Taiwan" passports. Chinese people do not take offense at mentioning Taiwan, because its still their province(only US screams about "independent" Taiwan). So you cant be kicked for that.

I mean, most goons I know love structure bashes... their comms aren't the toxic shithole that NC's are.
---
46DP is the best pvp around right now that I know of. There's a lot of small gang stuff going on. I'd wait on the Fort off the gate for some hot nonconsensual pvp to happen then go 3rd party it. Or get on comms for a roam with the other Test bros. Set your death clone to 08- so you can get back at it quickly when you die.
---
We believe in Dear Leader.
---
Dunno if you were around back in the day but this was an actual thing. Space with low moon count was highly prized for defensive purposes and major fights were had over getting the first moon (s) down to get a staging point.
---
Oh would you look at that. NC/PL/PH aren't even going to form to stop a goons keepstar from onlining *within jump range of their entire cap fleet*.
---
It didn't even take 2 months to make you look retarded, it took less then 2 days.
---
It is when every time you take a gate you get 30% tidi
---
Anyone posting on reddit could be called that though..

Yeah that's the one..wait. There is a second type of ATS? Since you mentioned specifically  high slot, there is a another module that goes elsewhere?

---
The thing is, realistically ccp aren't going to change the fundamentals of how citadels work. It's not ideal, but damage cap and repair timers are here to stay.
---
Our best bet is to pressure ccp to make them less entrenched and defensively strong by adjusting the current mechanics. If they got rid of an entire timer, shortened the span between timers, increased the damage cap and only let the defender choose the tz, citadels would be so much better over night.
---
If the time you hit the citadel could influence which end of the vulnerability period the timer came out, that would be close enough to stront mechanics for me. All of these are features of citadels as they exist now or have existed. We just need ccp to actually take action and fiddle the numbers in the database.
---
People in Angel space. 
---
Cries in Immensia.
---
No, but it does mean that it's coming down soon.
---
You could always use the 'new' built-in Eve map.  
---
Assuming you are okay with accidentally winding up in Nebraska, but hey, at least it isn't upside-down any more.
---
If you have an important structure bash and you need nerds now... call JT WENT WORTH... 877 NERDS NOW
---
Weekend timers change things a lot mate. People are a lot more willing to stay up late or alarm clock if they don't have work.
---
This is good if you can find a really good Corp, but a lot of smaller corps I‚Äôve seen have a lot of time periods with no one on. Not great when you‚Äôre brand new and can barely do anything solo, at least not without asking for help. 
---
And none of the really good small corps are going to accept random new players, you‚Äôll need to get to know them somehow and get a vouch
---
The day CCP forces me to use the new in game map instead of the old one, which they still allow, is the day I win EVE.
---
its gonna be a bee movie, at best, badom, psst.
---
This goon speaks the truth!
---
Imagine indirectly sticking up for the Buccaneers :dagger:
---
Imicus still looks like that, right?

iit everyone seems to forget about the daily "pos mechanics suck mega dick" threads pre-citadels

There‚Äôs auto targeting missiles.

I know that everyone uses it for agree/disagree or like/dislike. I do it too.      
---
But that is not it's originally intended use.
---
That's because POS were a lot more work to deploy and maintain.
---
The old system definitely had more depth and made systems more desirable then others for that reason. It also made those fights really intense.
---
I'd take that a win actually.

But is it, though? Is it really?

&gt;Yes, this pack is indeed only for new players.  
---
*new alts
---
Oh yeah, I remember that, I think I was part of the big PH F1 blob that time. I'm not certain, but I think the rorq(s?) you killed belonged to someone "important" in PH, and that happened while goons were invading the north, so a combination of personal revenge, support for Prothean, and fear of a two front war led to you guys getting blobbed. And I'm definitely not sure what the eventual agreement was, but I feel like PH would still have welcomed roams (especially into proper Horde space, Kalevala is basically all renters). Anyway, good luck dudes, hopefully I'll fight you guys soon :).
---
What's the ship between Nestor and Leshak? I took a break from Eve couple years ago, so my knowledge is spotty.
---
Looks pretty slick.
---
I feel like undocking is a necessary precondition for both.
---
Right. They are a completely different kind of toxic shithole, be we're into it.
---
Cracks forming
---
&gt;Not simply throw new players into the meatgrinder  
---
Tribute 2016 would like to have a word with you hordeling
---
auto target missiles are great for hi-sec anomielie farming to get escalations. 
---
ofc you need to use them in a quiet system or els a gila/jackdaw will come in and run the den, refuge or what ever site you farming
---
Everything he said. - Go watch the slicer video. That's how to kite - but keep it up sir, content is good regardless.
---
It works perfectly, in my experience.
---
However, it doesn't function in a manner as one might hope it would.  It will only target things actively attacking you.
---
Best to fit a T2 version for +3 targets, and never activate it.
---
But you're posting here too :thinking:
---
getting hot,  I can always sell garbage to some drug manufacturer.
---
Have you ever killed a citadel with a small gang? It is not fun in any way.
---
Joining a corp.
---
That way I can solo low power structures and salvage them for some money
---
'Legacy code'
---
Correct... unironically.
---
You propably forgot to add the russians to legacy too (not that they did much, despite what they claim)
---
Now you're speaking the new CCP's language.
---
Murder.
---
Time is a flat circle
---
Yeah, I realize this, why is that an issue, the other guy visited over 7000 systems or something in K-space. I'm probably going to need way more than 4000.
---
The best activity if you only have one account is uninstalling the game.
---
Logging out.
---
RMT is the new meta
---
Depends on how you want to play. Are you okay with paying the $15/month for omega? Then you don't really have to do much. You can join a corp and buy doctrine ships, go on corp/alliance fleets, and get SRP for those ships if you lose them. Usually flying interdictors and other suicide ships you end up with a net gain for SRP. Also, some of the loot you will find can be valuable.
---
If you want to PLEX your account, then you will probably end up needing some alts. It's definitely viable to PLEX on one account for one account, but you will spend most of your time in the game krabbing, which is extremely boring, and you will get burned out pretty quickly. This is assuming you have low SP.. if you have industry skills trained, you can just sit back and watch ISK flow into your wallet.
---
As for game content, there's a LOT to do as one person. You can fly around in wormholes and PVP, you can solo PVP in faction warfare, you can be a cloaky camper in krabbear nullsec space and kill some upset noobs when their 100m ratting fit VNI gets shit on. The entire game is a sandbox, man. The only thing you \*really\* need alts for is PI, industry, sometimes mining, spies, and cloaky intel accounts.

I run Test‚Äôs spy division. Spies are still just as effective as before. There‚Äôs more ways to skin an anchor than just killing their ship, and often times it means they stay on grid longer allowing you to kill more. Spies have gotten so many buffs in the last couple years it‚Äôs insane, so I‚Äôm not too broken up about only being able to tackle the shit out of an anchor instead of outright killing them.
---
They don't really like structure bashing and especially not the mass of structures put up by Simple Farmers, I was In TIKLE and was happy to bash those structures because why not, but the leadership and most line members were not keen.
---
And TIKLE is very capable of doing that, well they were when I was there.
---
Do you really need to 'defang' a toothless infant?
---
POS can at least put-up a decent fight when you have a few gunners, and have automated defenses (though sucks vs. multiple targets).
---
I mean I do combat exploration with a bit of trading on the side (mainly selling my loot) and enjoy it.
---
In the 12 years I have had my account, I have never been banned.
---
Stop doing things that get you banned?
---
Most activities will give you an "advantage" with more characters/accounts. But Abysal running is a solo activity that can't be multi boxed (that i know at least). Also maybe exploration. I say find what you enjoy to do. As in do the activity you enjoy, be it pvp, pve or industri and what not.
---
New players come in all forms. Most are not worth the investment that groups make in guiding them but 1 in 10 or so turn out to be resourceful and don't randomly leave the game 2 weeks in.
---
In all honesty you can do almost everything. Some things are less recommendable with only one account like wormhole life or flying capitals(or bigger). But even these things are not impossible. The only real issue im seeing is hauling with jumpfreighters.
---
Works here, but it's not updating kills - so either there are ESI issues or Dotlan has other issues.
---
Well maybe think of things in terms of accounts, not characters.
---
Example,  you would be wise to have a basic skills transport/market toon. Like t1 Industrial and basic market skills takes a few hours.
---
Then you return training your main(PvP,  perhaps) character.
---
The technology isn‚Äôt there yet
---
Initiative.
---
So you want CCP, a business not a charity, to intentionally refuse to take in nor profit? I'm sure that's goal #1 on the to do list.
---
&gt;Yes, this pack is indeed only for new players
---
&gt;&gt;*New alts
---
*New bots
---
However, POSes needed finer-grained access = 'legacy code'.
---
There is only 1 access that covers all non-station corp hangars.
---
Still,  an explanation wouldn't kill them.
---
Lumpymayo alt confirmed.
---
Yeah, I was more kidding then anything. It would be cool to have space casinos though.
---
As a little guy in Test who only has 1 titan, this allows us to survive against all the rest of eve and is good
---
I fell for it in 2009 when Gobbins invited me to fleet using a spy in the fleet invite channel (fleet finder wasn't a thing and you had to x-up to get manual invites). 
---
I only accepted it because I remembered seeing his name in COAD posts, just didn't realize he happened to be on the opposite side...
---
Even with the drop in recruiting standards the average NC titan pilot probably understands their ship a lot more.
---
You are a great a mining
---
 Looking forward to following you on more roams
---
Doing independent security research isn't "doing CCP's job for them." Botting is a complex problem and just throwing manpower and money at it doesn't make the problem go away. It takes expertise and novel approaches. Research like this contributes valuable data and makes Eve better.
---
Nobody expects Joe Schmo Capsuleer to go tattle on bots. Go play the game. If somebody wants to go the extra mile and perform analysis on bots then let them. There's no onus on anybody to report bots, whether they've performed research or not. Eve is not a fascist state.
---
On day when you move out of your mom's house and have to support yourself you will then learn you too would rather have a salary of $3k per month and not $200 per month. On that day you will realize how dumb this idea is.
---
They actually removed that about 6 months ago since it was basically 250k free SP for alphas. I think it gives you electronics upgrades III now or something along those lines.
---
How does that bring you pvp content though?
---
&gt;As a side note, isn't CCP_Peligro "a little" overpowered with that ban hammer swinging left and right?  
---
....wat?
---
They loosing players because of that lol. 
---
Me and almost everyone I know left because today carrier drop on single frig is not a meme but reality. 
---
I want these times where loosing a titan was a huge waste of isk, and when Jira burn was actually scary
---
Now alliances don‚Äôt give a shit
---
fair enough, i'll concede that sending the mail on the 4th is kind of a dick move.
---
I ran Mazes with them before i was blessed with the knowledge of our lord and saviour, the smartbomb prot.
---
TIKLE are beasts
---
I mean... X up when DD ready. Lock target.... fire DD... that's not a whole lot to know in tidi titan warfare. Which one of those is the test guy boot doing right?
---
But you can link where to pull out implants
---
Y'all gotta stop congratulating CCP for this shit mess we have. And get a damn head exam why you are at it. The Monitor telegraph's who the FC is. üôÑ
---
Best activity is shooting other players.
---
We had them for a fair while, then the Casino evicted Goons and they got salty so CCP banned Casino's.
---
You do. Ever since you were Bob r3born
---
Dude, are you still trolling around with that chinese governement propaganda bullshit?
---
&gt; they were RSI-inducing cancer to set up and maintain
---
I cried when CCP allowed modules to be anchored anywhere, instead of specific locations (stepped cube movement).  It made it a lot harder to make a POS look like it wasn't anchored while intoxicated (though that was often a requirement).  I had taught people how to easily and neatly arrange modules, which was then no-longer possible.
---
A corpmate used to taunt me by moving a random module by one cube-step position.
---
When you start earning money and paying bills in real life instead of living off mom and dad you will fully understand. There is no such thing as a free game. Somewhere someone is paying for hardware and bandwidth and and buildings and licensing and electricy and staffing. CCP is not a charity its a business and like all others it needs money. If they limited everyone to one paying account they would have to close eve down by September.
---
Even flying solo you're only a couple days away from 20-30m. Exploration is more saturated these days, but it's still easy to make absolutely massive bank compared to shitty l2 missions.
---
They're primitive, uncivilized, don't shave and can't communicate in a for us humans understandable language? Don't you think you're being a bit too harsh here?
---
Assuming for the moment that this isn't just a troll question, why would we want that?
---
Thanks!
---
KK thanks!
---
Only the idiots and clumsy would have no idea when reinforcement timer goes out
---
So yeah the downside is that it doesn't bring it to you.
---
But it does incentivize someone else to PvP them and you get your wargoals. Heck maybe the people you're attacking will hire mercs to fight you in your TZ on their behalf too. A bit roundabout yes, but I'm just throwing ideas out.
---
unironically all unsubbed
---
?
---
&gt;and large groups have lots of players who can/will take it in turns, and the small guy will get burned out after a few days.
---
Not to be dismissive, but N+1 mechanics have been a problem for EVE for a while. Bigger, more active groups tend to win things in general.
---
Sigh.... "unsubs"
---
some of those Gallente hauls feel so awkward with their blatant disregard for symmetry (I'm looking at you THORAX!!)
---
After returning to Eve 5\~ months ago I never thought I would ever reach anything near 100 subs. I was uploading videos just for fun so I am thankful to everyone who watches my videos and shares their opinion with me. This video is really special to me because of the extra work I did for it and the person is dedicated to. 
---
If you want to watch the first kill (part 1): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa8Bnd2LUpY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa8Bnd2LUpY)
---
If you like it, please share it. Thanks again, with the little time I have for Eve, it really means a lot people watched my videos.
---
&gt; POSes are not meaningful threats to capital ships.
---
They used to be.
---
However, the capital fleets has increased from the days when 6 dread fleet was a lot.
---
Screening recruits?!?! In Brave, everyone is a spai.
---
Why would you hire mercs to kill/save a 400m structure?
---
I‚Äôm going to be honest with you, I haven‚Äôt flow one of those in a really long time now.
---
I think they will have been updated but still the same basic design.
---
Well, just go back and think what you might have been doing for naughty stuff. Botting, buying RTM isk, ships, other stuff, Deaththreats or doxxing, racist remarks in chat and someone reported your for it. Etc etc.
---
Tell me more how CCP has no money after failing to make nine games, all funded by EVE
---
Not sure why this is downvoted since it's a good summary of the problem with hard structure limits.
---
Though having said that, did you bother to POS-lock every system in your control before?
---
feeding to my fleets, lol
---
More than 10... more than 5 would be the amazing map that Dust 514 got but we never did...
---
It's not too late, they could forcibly unanchor everyone's structures (in a special way that saved rigs) and change the rules.
---
Just tested if you are still linked to steam you can get 250k skill points and some free junk
---
abyssal deadspace, carrier ratting
---
If you disconnected from steam it goes to the account that was tied to it before
---
All 'stront kiting' does is make it the defender who gets screwed, not the attacker, and I don't think that's a good trade. It is a little bit frustrating not to be able to attack a system because you can't be online in its window. It is extremely frustrating to lose your stuff without a fight because you can't be online to defend it.
---
*Laughs in frigate abyssal sites*
---
Make low power structures come out of reinforce at the same time they were reinforced. 
---
It doesn't solve everything, but it's an easy fucking start.
---
It's more changing those mechanics could be quite a bit of dev time especially with "linking" to the base structure.
---
This. I believe it works on the same principle as auto lock ammo ie it targets closest first and they must have agro on you
---
Yes, but this cost a load of fuel to maintain and meant that if you wanted to invade someone you actually had to fight to secure a beachhead. It also made systems with more moons more vulnerable in proportion to their value, because you had to spend more on fuel to defend them and someone attacking them had more options to pressure you.
---
Then they have the g-awful crates within crates.
---
Yeah, of course, Goons are pushing this now because right now structure proliferation is annoying to them, whereas they haven't been for 2 years because structure proliferation to fortify Delve wasn't.
---
But that doesn't mean that they aren't also right, even if it's entirely for self-serving reasons.
---
No agro it will just keep cycling until they attack you
---
It's gotten my pals and I several carrier kills out in the Drone Lands last year.
---
Blows my mind.
---
You can solo a womrhole C6 with a Raven by being 400km+ from the sleepers. It is incredibly slow, but it's possible. With more Raven alts, you can even get decent clear times.
---
More like CCPlease stop doing events that reward accounts for just visiting the login screen, because it's not good for the game that this guy got 59 times as much reward as someone actively playing one account.
---
It means he's a cuck.
---
&gt;As a side note, isn't CCP\_Peligro "a little" overpowered with that ban hammer swinging left and right?
---
AHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHABA
---
Your claps are so off. Bcrlianpg bcalcakp sctlraopnt tcilmaeprs
---
Ok, but for most purposes, especially for a new player, they aren‚Äôt useful. There are exceptions but 99% of the time auto targeting missiles are inferior to normal ones
---
what a colossal waste of dev time
---
It was purposeful apparently there was 1k bad searches per day due to dash placement
---
&gt; I don't like it because it's a "magical ship" somehow exempt from all the normal ship rules with magical absurd stats/bonuses just so it can do its job.
---
Yeah, although you are overstating the level of 'magic', it feels very artificial. I understand why people wanted something tankier than a Sleipnir as a command ship (though there are decent armour options), but it should have been more like a normal ship with tank bonuses, not something that is ridiculously tanky but can't actually be fit to do anything else.
---
5% to owner for fuel.
---
And the Drake hardpoints.
---
NPC lossmails have never shown a full list of all NPCs that shot at your ship.
---
 I'm not even sure what the method is that shows which NPC even shows up on the killmail (I'm guessing its the last one to hit you before you die).
---
You like cheap plex? Buy it with money and sell it for iSK. That‚Äôs ho you get cheap plex.
---
Honestly no. It can be done but you will burn the hell out quickly. Don't do that take 5 minutes and do it the right way. 
---
It has nothing to do with multiboxing either. Eve is a game where if you try to be a jack of all trades you will be a master of non. For real. You need a pi alt to earn isk on days you are sick and can't login. You need a cyno alt if you ever plan to get the big stuff. You need an alt for said big stuff, maybe 2 if you want to actually not die doing stuff. You need an alt for building. You need an alt for mining. You need an alt for market trading. You need a shipping alt for moving all your crap. You need a scouting alt for pvp, hauling, and quick move operations. If you want to run missions you need an alt for that. If you want to explore you need an alt for that.
---
No matter what you decide you want to do in eve you need a character specifically for that one thing. If you combine all these things into one or two characters it's going to take years or a shit ton of injectors to get one character all those skills. You will burn out long before you reach your goal. 
---
I tried it your way for 10 years and sooner or later I would get bored but trapped behind long skill trains and kept walking away. I won eve like 5 times over the years. Once I figured out why you need multiple accounts and started setting them up I've been playing the last few years with no walking away. On days that I want to mine I mine. On days I want to fight I fight. Pretty much whatevrr I want to do on any given day I have a specialized character I can login to and excel at. Instead of being handicapped by one character or two characters that does 80 different things non of which they are really good at.
---
oh yeah, Chinese people love the shit out of KFC
---
TIKLE smash?
---
No, but that's because POS require monthly maintenance, take hours to set up (if you're adding guns and/or maximum dickstar,) and are generally a pain in the ass. Structures, you can throw down, and either not fuel them, or jump in more than two years of fuel in a single JF. It's a lot easier to lock a system down with citadels.
---
An elite pvp pilot.
---
The objective for many fleets isnt a fight, but to eliminate the enemy. So headshotting is quite effective in this regard.
---
Abyssals are rather common to multibox actually, running frigate sites with a few cheap ships.
---
Yeah friendly terms indeed. But there were no joint fleets before that happened. Like I said in my previous comment, the one you respond to but obviously didn't read. It pushed us closer together.
---
Great piloting - kiting sure aint easy but you made it look chill. n1 music
---
It gives you marketing 1 now.
---
According to CCP, it was never intended that CPU V was to be given as a reward. It was supposedly a "mistake". Then on top of that you had a bunch of old players run the tutorial to get a free 250k unallocated sp since they already had the skill trained.
---
Honestly I think its a shame. CCP should've just removed the unallocated sp feature if the skill was already trained. Fitting skills are boring to train, and giving newbros CPU V as a gift for running through the tutorial is a good incentive for getting new players to run through the tutorial.
---
But in the end its all better than what I first started with, which was weeks of training learning skills.
---
Less than you, by a mile
---
Cool. You play NC right?
---
No, it should be limited to the defenders of sovereignty. Alt corps/alliances that do not claim sovereignty would not be affected. They would need to claim sovereignty after the defenders have lost it legitimately and would become the new defenders.
---
I guess the only thing to worry about is making sure that A and B can't pingpong sov while C grinds structures, or at least make the debuffs last despite a change in sov -- you could do that by applying the debuffs always to each alliance in the system individually despite their status as sov holders or you could simply make the debuffs persist for a set amount of time or until some condition is met.
---
Yeah, that's true. What's bugging me is that it's showing an NPC that wasn't actually on-grid at all.
---
I submitted screenshots with my bug report, but 'most damage' and 'final blow' are attributed to Benthic Abyssal Overmind - a Drone Battleship - but the room was a Frigates-only spawn, not even a Cruiser or BC on-grid.
---
The vast majority of those structures only have ozone and cyno corvettes in them. Not like you'd be getting much more than what you get in salvage, at best.
---
Seriously just buff salvage instead of all the arguments about asset safety. They're dumb, it's not going to happen, move on.
---
Obviously.
---
AYYY
---
The first time I ever saw it used was when Horde/BL... were fighting GOTG for a bit. We were bored, sitting off a staging keepstar, when the FC just says "hang on, let me try this". A few seconds later, a Ranger Regiment Phoenix joins our fleet and then gets fleet-warped to us. Taught me to look carefully at fleet invites lol
---
What's the least gay compromise friendo
---
Oh, I agree 100% that spies are still effective. It's just Monitor reduced amount of options for good prep to affect outcome of a fight by making headshots insanely more difficult to execute - especially as a way to counter significant numbers disadvantage. Back in the day (and this is still my main argument why introducing Monitor was net negative) when you got two sides to try to out-headshot other side, win or loss was decided mainly by how many people in each fleet were capable and willing to take over fleet when primary/secondary/tetriary FC and all prior stand-in FCs got headshot, meaning there was real and measurable benefit in trying to get every single member of your group into a spot where they were comfortable enough to actually try and take over the fleet ad-hoc.
---
Similar case for when your goal is to not have a fight and still be able to win the objective or hit enemy morale - there's hardly better way to make enemy stop getting good numbers (outside maybe bosoning them while they're en route, repeatedly) than headshotting everyone capable of keeping them together and then probe hunting remains when they try to safelog. When you measure your progress or success rate by seeing enemy numbers drop and/or by just objectives, with no regard to killboard, headshots are the best and most effective way to go.
---
worst part is you dinobrains actually believe this.
---
Pretty much anything with subcaps can be done with one account, although for some of them you will want friends or corpies.
---
The average test pilot is lucky to even figure out his password to login. Anything beyond that is expected to fail
---
If you already claimed the old 100% off promotion, how can you claim this one?
---
123456 best password

I once switched corps mid warp to get a wardec'd rating rattle snake in highsec.  I got a stern talking too and a warning.  What the heck did you do to get banned?
---
Why are retards always so obsessed with cucking? It screams out like that one dude you knew at school that totally wasn't gay, but was cracking a gay joke every 5 minutes, not gay tho.
---
Cowards.
---
&gt;they make you target whatever is targeting you.
---
There's literally a setting that lets me do that already. Why would I ever use an auto-target module?
---
Part of why its so funny, so many of those crying for us to welp our supers into them and stop being cowards are doing exactly the same thing.
---
For those wondering about LS and NS.

LS: Tama at 65k

NS: BFW-ZZ at 56k

---
Don't you have to be docked to switch corps? Or is that an old Eve thing?
---
Without screenshots, we won't be able to tell. :Shrug:
---
It's only the best place to gank due to the sheer number of brain dead morons feeding easy billion+ isk kills every week.
---
Wait till you see the front windows if the retribution
---
Define "huge disadvantage". Almost any goal you could pursue in the game, you could pursue better with more than one account. Almost any activity is made better if you have another account either doing the same activity, or doing another activity simultaneously. Abyssal stuff is probably the only thing that doesn't fit this bill. 
---
On the other hand, there are a fair number of things you can do just fine with only one account, especially if you have friends to fill out other roles in whatever you're doing. It's not like you're completely gimped in, say, small gang pvp with only one account; you'll just need more friends to fill certain roles.
---
Numbers are pretty clear. You can spout salty spin all you want but it's right up there. 
---
New numbers are also pretty clear. We won.
---
"its the fc's job to not assume your linemembers have basic brain functions"
---
First, if you feel it's not worth it, then don't use it ? Nobody is forcing you. It's totally alright to not use it, and only fit it for its passive effect.
---
Then, no there is no setting for that. "auto target back" only works the moment someone starts targeting you, it does not acquire new targets after this initial lock. Auto targeter modules does.
---
Thanks, I think I am about to beat eve online
---
stand a chance"
---
imagine being in a fleet and only having 3 people able to anchor
---
Honestly, you can do almost anything the game has to offer, although having a second account will help with utility and logistics of what you're doing. Or for certain things it scales up.
---
Small gang warfare is very oftenly singlebox, on larger fleets people will usually log in their second accounts.
---
agreed, but not many people that wouldnt be true for
---
I year ago I found the slasher one again, took my some effort, but can't find it now.
---
That video impressed me when I started to play, I remember killing the wolf with the slasher, managing the orbit the heat....
---
I gave you the real numbers, you adjust them to fit your narrative
---
Your most used argument is "lmao you salty", how do you even become this retarded?
---
time is a flat circle.
---
I walk my dog everyday.  Not sure how it's going to help me fix oxygen deprivation from 7 years ago, but that's not why I do it.
---
Sounds super, let's push out a hotfix tomorrow morning so people can enjoy a 3-day weekend of carnage!
---
I know! (and nice catch!) But I don't see why we would make the game less harsh compared to the days of POSes where loot would drop in null/ls/hs too? I see why you want players to use citadels instead of NPC stations, so there's a tradeoff, but asset safety AND very easy defend... that's a double whammy!
---
But ya don't have too.  You can do it all in one.  You only need to freight it if you want that dank structure bonus.
---
Yes plz I have about 15 I need to remove
---
Oh wow that's so interesting.  Tell it again!  
---
Nobody cares dude.  You probably chose to be a prison guard so you had people to look down on all day.  10 to 1 you have a tiny dick and an even small income.  I'd rather be me with brain damage than whatever the fuck kind of loser you are.
---
Yeah tell me how refining unbonused goes for you.
---
You argued that our total players weren't as lopsided after you discount NC/GotG. Sure, I acknowledged as much in my comment. I'm arguing that your forces still had a serious titan/super advantage. The best you've got is pointing out that our numbers were underrepresented -- okay, but definitely not enough to overcome a 5 to 1 numerical advantage in CTAs.
---
they give you +2 or +3 to max locked targets, if you have a spare high slot its a possible choice for that reason.
---
some people believe and swear by an autotargetter preventing rat aggro on drones when they're afk ratting, but I personally have found great success holding rat aggro by just being physically closer to the rats (within 30km)
---
ok ok in reference to their modules . the actual drones (fighters) can be killed. I first though it meant fighters on a citadel could not be shot down and I didnt remeber that change. thanks
---
As a player who has only one account, I confirm this.
---
Most people say that pvp is the best part of eve, but in small gangs to not play without disadvantage you need main + tackle alt, in bigger groups capital + subcapital pilot (not fun to sit waiting for jump command if escalation is not needed) + fax (if your cap char is going in supercap) + your cyno alts according to your needs.
---
Works fine had issues with it in some countries. Do a traceroute.
---
That's the joke lol
---
Seems like a shit post arrived at least 10 years late
---
It would make too much sense, so no
---
Market trading.
---
I have 2 accounts 1 is my market one and the other is a FAX alt so it doesn‚Äôt make a difference.
---
I use 2 of these chars to trade and make around 11-12bil profit a month.
---
Which while may not be a lot for many people here has made it possible for me to buy a FAX alt and 2 supers along with various blingy ships and in general not having to worry about ISK
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt really know the granular back and forth but it seems tldr NCPL income (renters) was getting disturbed, and they responded in force. Sounds like a need for a solid diplo.
---
The game already has a login function check for alpha omega status.  Calling that function for gate operation is literally one line of code.
---
This is actually the most retarded comment in this chain thanks
---
You just hit the jackpot
---
You really want to loop yourself in with all the other retards who cant tell the difference between CCP DIDNT GIVE ME FREE SHIT and CCP CLEARLY MADE A MISTAKE WHICH IS EVIDENT BY THE MASS RESPONSE TO THE SAME PETITION?
---
 Why would you go out of your way to post an opinion online and not even stay on topic?  This thread is full of angry virgins trying to act tough.
---
Is there anything I could do during the 7 days of omega that could last me after it is over? Far as I see I can't undock in a barge and just never dock again because I won't be able to mine with it even if I was to jetcan the ore
---
Bro you're so fucking pathetic I have tears in my eyes from laughing.  
---
....telling me to go away, and that nobody cares....  
---
You posted on MY THREAD you fucking cuck.  Tell me more about how you dont care.  The more it's true the more pathetic you are for posting.
---
Your alts dont count.
---
And yet you took time out of your day to comment
---
Nice! Overview settings next, plox!!

For a group of people who think they're so damn smart, you fuckers have a hard time basic reading comprehension.

---
Havent read the article yet, but as soon as I saw Chloe's name, I knew it was going to be good.
---
Btw COM, Im still waiting for your safe logged carriers to attack my C4 pos. Ya tard.
---
Ok as a little explanation to everyone cause apparently I'm the worst villain of them all.  
---
I have no clue what I did wrong. Never been cheating/botting. I barely play the game, was invited to play by friend who was sending me some ISK and skill injectors from time to time, so I don't have to grind for eternity. He wanted to play in Eve with me as we already play together a lot so I gave it a try. I've spent some time doing Project Discovery as I find it a nice activity, but Eve is not really my cup of tea, even tho my acc was made 2 years ago.
---
Still I want contact support/devs. Already made total of 4 tickets each one 10-14 days appart. I saw someone reaching them via Twitter (I don't use it) and Reddit, so here I am.
---
I‚Äôm just going to block you, your literally a waste of breath! Just fuck off, no one cares about you
---
****Screech****
---
Tether is off center too.
---
This story will motivate you:
---
We killed an explorer and he convo us for questions (how to stay alive,what he did wrong etc.). We decided to make him join our corp. Even if we were mostly all 10+ year players, he ended up being super useful. He was probing all signatures documenting them on Siggy and finding us connections to PVP. He would follow us in a prober ship (he could not fly anything else) and would combat probe or find signatures our targets were in. Even if you are new, if you do something good, you will be valuable. My advice find what you like doing (mining, probing, logistic, pvp) and learn as much about it. You will be valuable. Also some corp just look for active players and are willing to teach EVE from A to Z. Skillpoints does not matter, your knowledge does.
---
POS was fun, but stront timer nah.
---
I still remember the stront guy was crying at local while we‚Äôre bashing pos at our AUTZ, every day, making him to woke up at 3am.
---
Old stront mechanics rely on few dedicated stront guys, and It was too harsh and unfun for them...Also It sucks when your group can‚Äôt get that dedicated stront guy.
---
I hope citadel must be repaired like POS btw.
---
That's the problem I was barely playing the game. There is not much I could do wrong as I was already doing very little in game at all.
---
You cared enough to post.
---
for sure.
---
but that's not an excuse to add more mechanics that favour or encourage n+1
---
FUCK REPPING A STRUCTURE YOU CAN EAT SHIT OP.  
---
Seriously though, that sounds like fucking hell because repping pos modules in hull is/was fucking dreadful.
---
I didnt create this thread to mine salt, but it's easier to troll people here then in game.  Holy fuck some of these dudes are taking real personal offense to this shit. I love it
---
The old system wasn't good. The new system isnt good either. But atleast in the old system, attackers could have some sort of advantage on when a timer comes out. Now it's completely up to defenders
---
Heavily depends on the ‚Äúintel‚Äù.  The value can range from worthless to ‚Äúmeh‚Äù I‚Äôd say though.  Any intel certainly not ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù as ALL of the work of an eviction is in the eviction and basically none is in the intel gathering.
---
**written by a goon**
---
&gt;Goonswarm Federation is the largest of The Imperium‚Äôs groups and the coalition‚Äôs de facto leader when situations involving the entire alliance are involved. (It‚Äôs also, for the record, the group to which I personally belong.)
---
Use the intel channels. Don't carry big ships alone in unsecure systems. Use a ceptor for quick 1dq visits.Don't accept fleet invitations,especially instantly. Take lessons from your mistakes.
---
And year won't make a difference at the end.
---
Don't get me wrong, similar thing happenned to me when i moved to null sec first time. But i learned better.
---
Fly safe o/
---
Fuck snuff
---
Is your friend also banned? Could be that you were targeted as RMT buyer.
---
another possibility could be that you were hacked. in this case you are banned to protect your account. Which happens actually pretty often
---
I think these days top tier solo pvp is done with marauders and dreads/carriers.
---
Most people are not really impressed about anti-ceptor tech1 exploration frigates (what i used to fly) haha
---
Make medium structures have only one timer too. They require too much effort for how little they cost.
---
Well done not getting caught, despite having to fly with bad pilots like that wolf and stiletto guy.
---
Kotaku is a load of SJW wank.
---
For example when I logged in to claim my 14h prize, it still said I had 2 days left to claim prizes. Myself and many others assumed that meant there would be two more chances to log in.  This would have been the 18th.  The event said it went until the 20th, and the redemption page said two days left on the 18th, Anyone who is used to stores running a promotional event Monday-Friday would assume that meant the event lasted utill the end of Friday, not the end of Thursday at midnight.  It wasnt until I logged in on the 19th and claimed my 15th prize, and it said only 14 hours left instead of the expected 1 day left, that I realized I had fucked myself taking advantage of time I didnt have to go visit family.  
---
If it wasnt for the mass response by CCP Archduke I would have been left feeling like the lone idiot.  The fact that they sent out the mass reply is evidence that the confusion was not limited to a small number of people.
---
https://youtu.be/2j3adcbEwSM?t=44
---
Not just on Eve. Maybe a couple years back I would easily put 80 hours into the game.  
---
Lets just say I have nothing but free time on my hand. I wake up, update market orders, derp around on whatever game I feel like playing. Log off my PC about 12-18 hours later. Rinse repeat. It's a sad life but someone has to do it.
---
[deleted]
---
It kind of depends on your playstyle. I only had 1 account for the first year I played, maybe longer, just mainly doing fleets (f1 monkey) or exploring. If you are in a corp or have friends to help when needed it is definitely doable. Really the advantage of having more than 1 account is being able to do things by yourself like give yourself a scout, a cyno, etc.
---
For timers I favour the ability for defenders to set a block of time - maybe 12 hours a day - when they can't defend and the structure is invulnerable.
---
For structure spam: Low power structures in K space should be as easy to knock over as they are in J space (one timer, minimum 12 hours). You also shouldn't get tether on a low power structure, so there's little point in spamming structures.
---
Medium structures should get one less timer - so one timer only when powered, and none when low power. It should be the armour ref timer that is lost so that when you ref a structure into armour, it doesn't go low power immediately.
---
The upkeep and effort for keeping large and XL structures up and fuelled is not unbalanced, in my view. It's Raitaru/Astrahus spam and low power structures that are the problem.
---
I don't get why all the babies in null whine about structures - you asked for this. Most of the negative things about EVE right now were things added to make null stronger. Look where you are now and say that isn't the case.  
---
Timers in null just make the game worse and null more static. They don't fucking matter because cits drop no loot in kspace. In jspace, where almost every player structure is a potential loot pi√±ata, the timer shit actually DOES serve to protect smaller groups from larger ones, and the logistics of moving things out or hiding them actually exist, compared to 'oh it went to asset safety'.
---
If you disconnect from Steam you can actually finally get good at the game and afford tons of injectors that will give you way more than 250k.
---
Get off of steam, folks. Kappa?
---
Well the message I get while trying to log in it says "I was banned for macro use / alpha account abuse" and "banned pending investigation" (for over the month). The problem is I had this account in Omega state for quiet a long time and as I said, I'm not a cheater. About a friend, dunno, he is a little bit more into the game, might have more than one account, I don't care. It's not about his account, but mine.
---
REMOVE ALL TIMERS . If you can't defend it when someone shoots at it you don't deserve to keep it. Please depussify Eve . Thanks.
---
Some random questions
---
If I warp to a mission runner after scanning him or warping to a combat site, can I bookmark a wreck, leave, then when the mission runner is done warp back to the bookmark and salvage the wrecks?
---
Where do people figure out if there ship is good enough to tackle X activity? Like missions or pvp or ratting. I enjoy trying messing with the ghost fittings but don't know if anything I come up with is useful.
---
Do cargo scanners activate the aggression timer? 
---
What is the proper use of cap batteries? Should I use larger sizes or smaller? Or whatever gives me more cap stability.
---
Not bad tbh. I still think defender choosing final day is too much but a 12 hour window is reasonable
---
r u retarded
---
&gt;Hello! Yes, this pack is only available for Steam integrated accounts.
---
You know, that wouldn't be so bad if there were a way to integrate my ***ten year old account*** with Steam so that I could redeem all this shit on my main.
---
Be sure to go back and do it to ALL my posts.  As you progress through my other comments, make sure to note on occasion I actively pursue negative karma.   
---
You see sometimes I get way too much karma for posting stupid shit like "ducks are super rapey", and then I intentionally go out of my way to get down voted into oblivion in other threads.  Karma is for pathetic losers who need incentives for social interaction and meta scores to convince themselves that others actually give a fuck about what they said.  Karma is responsible for the reddit circle jerk infecting most comment sections that see the light of /all.  Fuck reddit karma, and fuck you too.
---
So please continue to downvote my shit, or dont.  The points honestly mean less to me than your opinion, which I equate to autistic screeching.
---
Downvoted for kotaku tbh
---
No u lol
---
to be fair, compared to dotlan bot maps are bad
---
It's funny to see that it is still on the top of the board for most dangerous system. Its also something we expect nothing less of Jita though at this point. X)
---
You just use instawarp ceptors or fly in your pod.
---
Or, even better, have an alt that manages all your hisec affairs. This is sound advice even if your sec is 5.0 and you live in null.
---
&gt;An additional problem here is the later waves of dreads won't load grid.  So many of them will eat disconnects as soon as they hit jump.  When they finally get through the log in screen 45 minutes later they will be in a pod.  During this time the timer will unpause unless they drop dreads in excessive quantities from basically every angle, thus massively losing the isk war.    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;and THEN Goons drop another one.
---
&gt;&lt; wife's boyfriend buys me a rattlesnake for 10/10s, thanks charlie!
---
Wait wait...You NEED to address this. How did Charlie achieve diddling you wife and is it possible to learn this power?
---
This is great and should be really helpful for getting newbies up to speed.
---
That shouldn't change the overview color to dark blue (unless he's got some weird overview). He's likely +5.
---
Yeah, there's still not much danger from the faction police except for really slow ships in higher security space since the police still web you into warp.
---
 Not really an issue moving from lowsec to lowsec as those systems tend to be 0.5-0.7 where police response is significantly slower. Bigger risk is some random guy in a slasher can warp disrupt you on the gate until the police put down their space donuts and start pounding you. I guess the only other big problem is that you can't sit on wormholes in highsec if you're part of a group who uses those.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
bro I'm legit crying from laughing so hard.  please stop, my sides are kidding me
---
I used that last free one on my steam account and ALSO was able to use this one.
---
It's also not something you can prove with a screenshot of an overview. Right now all we've got to work with is the fact that some dude has a suspicious number of alts. Need more data.
---
Pretty lame retort for how long it took you, but feel free to try again.
---
I bet you also punch trees for jumping into your way while walking
---
You pressed f1 on botting super #24038. Why exactly should anyone care
---
My brain read that as Disney... odd, yet it fits if mixed around
---
The best time to jump in was before but now is great too.
---
Hi! thanks for your comment! 
---
In my overview, there's a velocity column next to the distance column. (but it's kind of hard to notice)
---
I usually use a tracking disruptor or a guidance disruptor for tackling and defanging bigger ships. (but not used in this video)
---
You're 10 years too late.
---
Shitaku...
---
Not really. Certain in-game mechanics have allowed one player group to swell in membership and resources to the point where competition is no longer possible, so they're just about to wipe the map and nobody can stand up to them. If that's your ride, join up, but I know a lot of other people who are unsubbing out of frustration right now.
---
Run
---
No argument that POS were terrible.  All I am saying is that CCP missed a significant feature when they rolled out citadels and the game is lesser for it.
---
Solo PVP
---
On the first glance I like it!
---
NC. is probably underrepresented due to their aversion to undocking.
---
Wrong game?
---
...and always use [sunscreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQlJ3vOp6nI).
---
Not a bad time to be new, I only started a couple of years ago and have played in a few different 'elite' groups before settling in the one I'm currently in. The hardest part is starting, the game doesn't shine until you work out what's fun for you and even then there's a lot of time spent building towards being able to do it effectively. 
---
Eventually when people start commenting on this thread you'll get recommended to various new player oriented pvp groups (e.g. Karmafleet, Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde), these are good recommendations for getting into the game and experiencing that side of it but very few will take the time to actively teach you things, this means if you want to learn more of the game's depth you have to ask questions and seek answers yourself (The exception to this is EVE University that even runs classes to teach players the game, bit stranger to get into but rewarding in the long term). 
---
Ultimately most of the game is gated behind skill points and they're mostly acquired by time meaning waiting won't remove that block - starting an account and throwing some skills in your training queue will start the clock ticking towards doing so.
---
im the l;ittle guy....fuck the little guy,nullsec need to be risky...I WANT CITADELS DROP IN NULLALL LOT,LOWSEX HALF LOOT
---
HISEC i dont care
---
Good that Lee states that in his articles honestly. Wish more writers did that.
---
Never disagreed with you. I think it's hilarious that Kotaku is writing about this!
---
it's free.
---
just log in and find out.
---
Wait are you upset I didnt give you enough attention?  Bro I only log into reddit once a day.  After that I stay logged out.  Nothing any of you say or do matters, and I dont need little red numbers fighting for my attention all day.  Now be prepared for another day of me not giving a fuck, or dont, I honestly dont care.  On one hard you're so pathetic it kinda hurts, but on the other so do my sides from laughing.
---
I miss Bobby
---
Underrated question right there. Can i have their stuff?
---
lol thanks, im a reddit noob
---
It's never a bad time to get into EVE! We still have regular content updates multiple times a year and balance patches every month. The game is still super engaging and very easy to get into for a new pilot. There are tons of easy ships to fly that have a huge impact in fleets. A lot of corps also offer mentors, free shit for new players, and tons more. ^(If you're interested,) [^(check mine out)](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/)^(.)
---
I don't have an opinion on this but I love the claps in the title. 10/10
---

AFAIK CCP doesn't do the kind of detection anti-cheat programs do like looking at the contents of your operational memory and processes running alongside EVE.
---
^^^maybe ^^^I ^^^will
---
Shameless plug; karmafleet is recruiting join today and win eve with us
---
They have a writer that regularly writes about Eve. Not a big revelation.
---
Big oof
---
CCP could even release APIs to the data so we can write bots to detect bots.
---
Good bot
---
Structure bashes are the best!
---
Can play another game while i do them
---
gay
---
no
---
Didnt you say you were banned with no word or reasoning on what you did? So that was a lie
---
Sounds like some1 needs to get out of nullsec blobs.
---
That's actually a pretty significant show of journalistic integrity coming from a Kotaku author.
---
Old eve.
---
That is precious.
---
This is news?
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs really an NPC or just one hell of a man in his Drekavac

I love how everyone is saying "omg 59 accounts" when you can buy these on the market. I invested heavily in some of these little things as they appreciate in value over time.

Really if you ignore burn jita and then the war dec undock/gate camps it‚Äôs safe.

Your Corp/alliance is war decced by one of the high sec greifer war dec groups (PIRAT, CODE, etc)

That, and the fact that Uedama, Niarja and fucking Perimeter (1.0 system lol) are close on the lists &gt;.&lt;
---
Walking in stations is a thing now?
---
Im not a goon, this is a meme parody but close to the truth
---
I mean the character's entire killboard is *just from today*, but on the other hand his name is spelled funny.
---
Maybe it's a CCP dev roleplaying in advance of the actual event? That would be pretty neat.
---
That's the high sec list. That's why. It splits the list into three. High sec, low sec, and null sec.
---
it's a player. look at his name
---
get fucked marshal tho lol
---
Taipar
---
just give me compress all button
---
Or HBO, they‚Äôre doing a fantastic series about Chernobyl
---
Anyone with better eng than me can ask marshal pilot about this fight.
---
Hi! Thank you for your comment!
---
Yes, the legendary slicer video, and the Magical Kiting 101 article are the two most influential learning material for me as a kiter XD
---
1) the Magical Kiting 101 article
---

2) the legendary slicer video

the title is a joke, obviously.
---
Sorry, we were moving some fleets around on the node
---
Venture is the best ship in eve.

goons stopped the "we're here to ruin your game" a long time ago
---
Epic
---
trying to preempt the ustz retard brigade that gets home in an hour and posts 40 "WTF CCP IDIOTS DON'T KNOW PRODUCTION SERVER REE" tbh
---
I knew there was a reason why I had Capital Remote Hull Repair Systems 5.
---
FWIW, the vast majority of my alts are Logi 5 Basilisk pilots, because they repped POS shield.
---
Almost there just need to forget to pay a bill
---
Right. You would need to undock first
---
Is not about just pressing F1, is about all the work, skills and organization required to be able to press F1. I am just sharing with the community the joy of making someone lose 15b twice. Also it takes time to edit and make a video enjoyable. Many wish they could atleast participate in a kill like that and a few can.
---
I liek bashing
---
I.. didn‚Äôt said otherwise ?
---
You can even do WH life with 1 account. Most corps will take you. And if you're living solo, you can just have two characters on the same account in the hole. 1 to play, and the second to scan your way back in.
---
I am good with this with one exception. If a structure is unanchored then Asset Safety. If it is killed then loot pinata.
---
That‚Äôd be neat, yeah !
---
Go tell that to the Marshal pilot tho...
---
 [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stront](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stront)
---
okey, i only thought, that maybe they thought your transactions from him were RMTs
---
Anyways, I would open a ticket. If you can't log into the account on the webpage, send an email at their support. that will also work
---
and ones in wormholes drop all the loot :)
---
Holy F, this was good. I laughed, cried and perhaps Ped a little.
---
Pick any number between 1 and 10. Whatever you pick, that's your IQ.
---
Every adventure, starts in a venture!
---
You're cancer
---
I'd be *slightly* more sympathetic if the Marshal pilot hadn't lost an Orthrus to the same pilot 5 minutes prior to this, or an Enforcer to *the same pilot* 8 minutes prior to *that.*
---
&gt; &lt;wife's boyfriend buys me a rattlesnake for 10/10s, thanks charlie!

Hold up.

You say that like OP knows how. smh.
---
Virtually all activities can be done with 1 account, so long as you play with other people.
---
Not their problem you're an autistic moron with 60 accounts
---
Artillery is great if you have good screening from your fleetmates.
---
Probably a bad idea, but are loans a thing, and who do you talk to?

If by golden krab you mean piles of isk, then yes.

Try Elite Exotic Dancers instead

why did you have so mcuh tank if everything was already damped retard

The sentence translates "we go and shoot citadels for fun and battle...". Says nothing about killing the citadels or evicting people. Figure out why.
---
whoosh
---
Do it, don't get it through steam though (people have had issues in the past though they may have been resolved by now)
---
I mean it's either a dev or some player legit decided to make a fresh toon, have it mimic an upcoming event, inject it up to Precursor BC/T2 capability, and run around solo murdering everything.
---
If there was a Benthic Abyssal Overmind in the first room and was the first thing to deal damage to you all the damage done by all the npcs in the site would be credited to that on your loss.
---
The other guy Trump had the strongest grass roots movement of any election I've ever seen. I can honestly say I've never seen a Trump shill bot. Trump simply does not need comment bots when his grass roots movements on the net are so vocal. Have you seen r/the_donald? its a practical fan club.
---
Hillary simply did not have that support so you did see a lot of narrative from comment bots that made flipping no sense in the comment chains.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to the bunch of salty vet neckbeards, try it for yourself and make your own decision. The game is great if you make it that way, it‚Äôs a sandbox, just because people don‚Äôt play right or all they do is bitch and whine doesn‚Äôt mean anything.

Butbutbut, InternetSpaceShips

I thought CCP had rolled that back years ago?

God I love Eve.

Kudos to the (potential) pilot sinking cash for some roleplaying luls.

you can tell the game not to render turrets, problem solved
---
...yeah...
---
With that cargo I'm even more of the opinion it's a CCP dev being clever.
---
It's like the days of Olde in EQ when GM's would actually masquerade as villainous characters to make the world seem more interesting.
---
I need an fc alt now
---
I agree fitting skill as a tutorial reward would have been great or just getting rid.
---
I said less recommendable, not impossible ;)
---
OP, wherever you end up, get on voice chat and talk to people. Ask questions, most people in the newbie areas of eve uni, karmafleet, brave, and PH are very patient and will help you learn. This game is brutally complex so try not to get overwhelmed
---
You can redeem everything at once in game.
---
Hell require defender to nominate 3 windows, spread over 48h apart with minimum 4h between windows. Attackers pick which one they want (final blow gets to pick.)
---
See, now thats better. At least you tried.
---
So heat as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jx2FSxLJ4) is incorrect?
---
Then dont go to kqk, they arent going to contest it. Go to Delve to shoot nc., they are busy killing ratters
---
I get that they were trying to remove that, but since when was EVE a game that protected it's players from getting scammed?
---
You answered you own question. Find a small pvp corp in your time zone and take it from there
---
Find a west-coast wormhole corp yo
---
It's probably doesn't scream out as loud as your wife does. No biggie tho, you'll get there one day champ!
---
Our guiding philosophy is solo with backup, meaning you are free to do what you want, but are encouraged to help out our corpmates when they find content in a WH nearby. WE definitely have people who operate as described above, but that is a result of personal preference as much as anything else. It definitely fits in well with how we operate though.
---
I knew I shoulda taken that left turn at Albuquerque!
---
From a PVP perspective;  
---
The smaller the ship, the quicker it is to train into being max skilled for it.  
---
The smaller the ship, the higher scan resolution it (generally) will have \[Quicker to lock onto targets.\]  
---
The smaller the ship, the cheaper it (generally) costs to build or purchase.  
---
I can't begin to explain how fucking frustrating it is to be in a fleet full of big-dick-dps vitter-bets, swaggin' out their dreks that can't be bothered to sit in an interceptor, since.......well, I honestly have no fucking clue. Do people not enjoy low-dps roles, because being able to do a lot of damage is considered cool or something?  
---
Everyone wants those fantastic fights with their big toys; but not enough people fly the smaller ships that make these fights possible. That battleship fleet of yours means jack shit if you can't stop smaller targets from just running away. So to answer your question, by being in some of the smallest and earliest ships in game, you help atleast one other pilot in your group step up into a larger, more intimidating ship they may have good skills for; or you may just very well be the reason why that enemy wasn't able to warp away quick enough before the rest of your group finally locks on and blows them up.  
---
People here generally throw out big nullsec names as places you should go to learn the game if you're new. I wouldn't suggest it as a starting point simply because it's too easy having everything handed to you, and skips a lot of the trial and error learning process that helps individuals flourish throughout the game (We all know that one guy who's been playing for years and knows so much about the game; except for why the gate guns just killed him.)
---
You should check out faction warfare for pvp, and incursions are a great form of group pve
---
Ok but you made a video about pressing F1?  Also what fucking editing? Adding an intro infront and song in the background? Lmfao

Thanks for watching
---
As with everything in eve, who you are playing with highly influences your experience. There are definitely some active FW groups out there, you just need to find them. Check out the forums and r/evejobs to find them.

We arent expecting any fights. We have resigned ourselves to knowing that we get to burn everything to the ground uncontested.

How did you set it up so that when you clicked it moved you in that plane and not in 3-D space?

How did you create those ranging circles around your ship?
---
RHML battleships arent good for killing tanky targets due to reload/clip magazine. If that drek had an AB it could still mitigate a fair amount of damage. Alternatively, if he was a max tank dual rep fit with RAH, he could just face tank the clip and wittle the marshal down.
---
Its why i dont use RHML, the reload will kill your solo battleship. It wasnt an application issue, it was a sustained damage issue. Torps may have been able to break it depending on its tank.
---
fuck me with ur butt pussy daddy

you do have to be out of your ship but it works if you eject in space

Agreed! My friends were on point that day! Amazing piloting from them!  .... on point... maybe I should say... on scram.... Heyo!!! :shootsselfinface:
---
Yes, the site well despawn after he finishes the site and leaves, wrecks despawn after 2 hrs.  
---
Figure out what is necessary (tank, DPS, speed, cargo, ect.) and build from there. Often you can find recommended fits and use those as a guide.  
---
Cargo scanners, and modules that enhance your ship such as sebos and hardeners don't give you a weapons timer.  
---
It's whatever gives you more cap stability and fits. Usually this is the largest one you can fit without using too many fitting mods and rigs.
---
I think the new player experience... has not kept pace with the advance of player expectations over the last decade.
---
Regarding lifespan, I think EVE is unique enough where it will survive, although maybe never thrive again, until a viable replacement is fully solidified. There's a few potentials out there.
---
review his posting, its pretty obvious what the answer to that one is.
---
I plan on winning eve pretty soon.

They're really good for BR 10/10's actually, makes it so you don't have to kill anything but the tower in the last room.
---
They still cost more than POSes ever did.
---
&gt; alpha account abuse
---
maybe your friend did something shady with alpha accounts and/or the referral system and banned every account using his referral code? (or maybe ccp doesnt actually believe eve players have friends? /s) Just a guess. Have you tried reaching out to see if he is banned too? You might not care about his status but it could help piece together the explanation of what happened to you.
---
Curious to see how this will be abused

The problem is you need to train omega skills to do omega things. This means that once those skills go away the modules they are needed for go offline and while you will still be in the ship, you won't be able to undock again after you dock.

Eve is dying since it's release so it will keep on dying for years to come.
---
CCP/pearl Abyss are currently working on local client for korea. Looking at the dedication for grind/pvp korea has in other games. It can give a big jump in active players if the marketing is on point 
---
Serenity server is getting a relaunch soon, dunno if it will succeed or nah. Since most chinese alliance moved to tranquility.
---
Imo the more local clients the better for eve. No idea if there is a french/german/spanish client. 
---
I know there was one for japan but ccp stopped supporting it few years ago.
---
The new player experience will never be able to adequately keep the majority of new players. This is not because of CCP, but because of the players.
---
More specifically the type of players that is attracted to this game. Face it, eve is hard mode. In my opinion it is the hard mode why this game even still exists. Making it more casual would alienate the majority of the existing player base
---
In a world where there other space sims already catering to the casual player, EVE is better served by sticking to its existing type of player.
---
So? Pricing is a shit balance mechanic and too prone to fluctuation.
---
How many rats do you need to kill to raise the military index of a system? If you increase levels it should spawn all the sites that come with that level for that particular security band, plus all the levels below it correct?
---
FW is kinda forgotten and so is most of low sec. It desperately needs a revamp and mae it interesting again. But wh's should be perfect for you :)
---
I can't see a thing, there's too much screen real estate been taken up by all the attention whoring nonsense like your character sheet. Apart from not seeing a whole lot what we *can* see is painful to watch, you killed a bunch of basic AB fit brawl/ scram kite fitted ships in FW, using a kiting one.  That's never happened before, congrats.
---
All of the friends I have tried to introduce to the game just get overwhelmed very quickly and go back to familiar games. Getting out of your comfort zone to play a game is hard when games are mostly there to be a comfort zone. 
---
I agree, I hope that when Eve does eventually peter out, there is something very similar to replace it.
---
The scams weren't the problem tho. The problem was, everyone knew that type of scam could happen, so they avoid any courier that did not have NPC station as destination.
---
But yeah, the nullsec use is just another victim of fixing the game for highsec, like swapping ships with weapon timer.
---
Anything that helps bros help newbros is good for Eve.
---
PL has more old goons than goons does so it makes sense.
---
They're cheap for nullblobs who spent last few years nothing but gathering isk. They're not too cheap for normal people.
---
I don‚Äôt date... I only get fucked... hard... by my relatives
---
Eve is the only competitor in its niche. Single shard MMO with the possibility of combat/interaction between thousands of players. It's deeper and more emergent than any other MMO you can play as well.
---
If CCP chose to invest in the long term health of the game it would have kept whomever it hooked in and ensured small but steady growth. Instead, they chose short term gain. Most of the ecosystem design in the game is determined by that choice. It benefited only one playergroup. Those whose main goal in this game is getting bigger and better ships, or creating bigger empires (I call them asset acquirers). Today's decline is thanks to that design.
---
Basically, if you design this game such that grind and numbers win over creativity and skill, you'll see it decline in the long term. Because every other MMO is like that, and their PvE experience is much better.
---
Also.. I like your name
---
Hahaha. Anytime brother

Heh, they tried to do that to me. Except they booshed me when I didn't click invitation to fleet. Then podded my ass.

---
CCP in no way will keep this ship afloat even if they release their fps counterpart
---
But EVE isn't really hardmode.
---
The concepts of the game are not overly complex, nor difficult to learn. The only barriers are the *vectors for learning.* There's very little in-game help, there's no ramp, and the majority of online info is hideously outdated.
---
There are games with far more difficult concepts and mechanics that *seem* easier because they are presented so well.
---
1. Low power citadels have no RF timer
---
2. Low power citadels have no damage cap.
---
3. Medium structures receive only 1 timer.
---
4. All timers based on stront allowing for TZ flexibility (retain self-repair)
---
5. Increase self-repair time from 15m to 30m for Medium Structures, 45m for Large structures, and 1h for XL structures.
---
6. FLEX structures (Ansiblex/Pharolux/Tenebrex) restricted to spots around moons; may not be anchored on grid with a Keepstar (may be placed on grid with Sotiyo however).
---
7. Logarithmic damage cap; at current damage cap, structures will begin deflecting shots. At 2x current damage cap, structures will deflect 50% of incoming damage. At 3x and 4x damage cap, structures will deflect 80% and 95% of incoming damage respectively.
---
8. Ansiblex now gives Jump Fatigue. -20% Jump Fatigue compared to same distance titan bridging.
---
We need changes like these in game to give some momentum back to people who are not in sov entities.
---
See this I completely agree with. Unfortunately if you look at the trends with many games nowadays, many "niche" games like Eve tend to get gutted because of how cut throat the industry has become. Eve, like Runescape, however, is one of the "old guard" MMOs that still has a dedicated player base so it will probably go in a different direction than others.
---
I agree, the game mechanics itself is not hard mode. The other players is the hard mode. 
---
And that is fine. That‚Äôs why most of us still play.
---
Blockade Runners tend to get instant blapped on the undock regardless of those things.
---
I'll bet a paycheck CCP's last stand will be offering an Arena Mode.
---
There are new players every day. Eve is a huge game, and there are new players every day, and fortunately many people (myself included) are willing to teach new players. There are a lot of corporations that teach new players, as mentioned by other on this post. What you can hear negative about the game is only related to part of the game, which doesn't affect you as a new player (wars between big nullsec alliances). Eve being a huge game makes it so everyone have a different perspective on the game,  it's not the same for everyone. Just get into the game and check if it fit youre likes.

&gt;They're cheap for nullblobs who spent last few years nothing but gathering isk. They're not too cheap for normal people.
---
This has always been the case, sorry. Even during POS days, if you wanted a medium POS with a sizable infrastructure backbone, you needed 500m minimum to start out with it and even that was cramped. Turns out bigger entities who can pool resources can effectively spam these structures when there is very little tethering them to certain spaces.
---
Pricing has never been a good metric for balancing; titans were supposed to be enormously expensive to build, and yet by 2013 there were alliances which had hundreds of them. This problem has only been accentuated over time by changes to mining and the availability of minerals. A balance has to be struck, but that balance does not come just from pricing, and using pricing as a metric is a shitty idea in general.
---
This is the real answer.

wut do?

Seems outnumbered to me, but my math might be off.

Don't proving grounds already exist?

Active titans =/= titans formed on a max cta
---
Amen! I have been preaching this for years now and very few people understand as well as you do.
---
tbh I don't think attackers should have any more control than they do now...but defenders should have less.
---
The nice thing about stront was that it was a bit unpredictable. It balanced out the attacker/defender bias in timers since neither side could easily accurately predict when the timers would be.
---
This I like to hear. I was here when Pearl Abyss bought CCP and while I understand everyone's concern (long time Runescape player here...) I think that a larger company having faith in Eve is a good sign and they do seem to understand that USA players aren't ok with the level of monetization that Korean players are.

I think this is a jab at the abyssal deadspace arenas they came out with but I could be wrong

---
Except, the claim they're too cheap for 3 timers is exactly a plead to balance for cost. They don't ask all structures to have 2 timers, only the "too cheap" ones.

Hi, welcome to eve. I would like for you to review this reality. Where 50 accounts *is* a thing. And all the things you thought weren't things because *''surely no one would ever do that...''*
---
~~They~~ We do here.
---
Like I said above, I am a bit pessimistic about the future of niche games. The industry is so cut throat and streamlined nowadays I feel like niche games struggle to survive or worse yet are watered down to the point where they are no longer niche. But Eve is an old guard MMO so it may have more staying power.
---
I agree, if CCP wants to attract a larger audience, they need to completely revamp the early game and new player experience to better assist players in understanding the game and building a desire to keep playing, even if it is tough at times.
---
You act like goons are the cancer but your attitude is the cancer. Stopping new players from joining is exactly the wrong kind of solution.

Exploration or red vs blue come to mind.
---
Which you then spent on extractors to move that 60m exp to your goon-rorq main right? ^^^/s
---
&lt;3
---
Honestly that's what I've been thinking as well. Unfortunately most game companies nowadays are more concerned about sucking out as much short term return as possible to keep their game afloat instead of addressing the deeper issues with why it is dying in the first place.
---
Wow, didn't know that!
---
&gt;It's only the best place to gank due to the [fact that it's the only not dead highsec system left in eve]
---
people flying blockade runners in highsec are dumb anyway, DSTs are far superior
---
stront citadels, remove a RF timer, limit it to 72 hours of stront
---
keepstars keep 2 rf timers, low power structures don't get any rf timers
---
remove local
---
all eve problems solved
---
The capacitor is rather irrelevant. He doesn't have any active tank mods and is scrammed anyway, so no MJD/MWD.
---
Much more serious is that he's out of ammo apparently.
---
Or, you know, just get more players to be FCs so that you don't need to always rely on the same handful of players to literally hold everyone's hands.
---
Is it really that difficult to teach players how to call/broadcast targets? Or read the map? Because no, it isn't. The Monitor is just an excuse for players to be lazy. It should never have been added.
---
The side that didn't bother to train more FCs is the side that deserves to lose.
---
Idk mate, it's a strong niche. The game survived this long thanks to it. Imagine CCP made right calls since the beginning.
---
Back in my days, we set your enemies to -5 and their fcs to -10
---
Meanwhile, NCPL unanchor in Tribute, anchor in Perimeter.
---
it's almost funny how many people pointed out the potential problems with citadels early on and everybody just laughed at them and now we're all here wondering why the game is so shit
---
It's going down for real.

thats a lot of words to call tapi members cucks

Another character to look at might be Perun Clade Koschoi, member of the Perun Koshoi Clade. Another one member corp that is kinda odd and has no killboard history. But has existed for a little over 3 months.

You can still have corp hangars inside an Upwell structure.
---
So the solution is to be unfair to the rich blobs and fair to normal people.
---
Well, you're not supposed to use this on your ten year old account anyway durr...
---
Well, it's closer to equal than Frat's claim of fighting 6 to 1 when it was just shy of 2 to 1.
---
This is the ping they sent out immediately after the fight:
---
&gt; \[Aezekiel Á¥´Âì•@WC &amp; Friends#coalition-pings\] @‚Äãeveryone    **You fought 6:1 outnumbered** and multiple objectives were completed.  This is their prime time.  Every fight we take builds  us up for the next one.  Never doubt that what you‚Äôre doing scares them, it‚Äôs why they want to attack you in your home, and why they have to blob you to get anything done.  They fear you because you are far better.  Any one of you I wouldn‚Äôt trade for ten of them.  I‚Äôm proud of you, but you should be proud of yourselves. Keep pushing yourselves a little harder every time and we will get where we deserve to be together. 
---
Still, OP is shit for focusing on numbers when there was plenty of other exploitable moments during the fight.
---
It would be great to have all structures be 2 timers, I'd love for that. But medium structures are also small, 8k m3, and so you can haul 6 of them in a well fit DST or 2 in a cloaky hauler. Large structures need a JF or Rorq in order to be placed, while XL need a full freighter to place. 
---
Cost is a factor in this, but so is the volume of them, the ability to be spammed in many locations without needing a larger target that is seeding them, and the fact that, for their size, they are very difficult to remove paired with that spammability. If you doubled the cost of Astras/Raitarus, I doubt that would affect their spammability except for the smallest of the small entities.
---
As it _requires_ an action by the 'victim', abuse would be unlikely. I think.
---
There needs to be changes that specifically go after the large null entities as well.
---
Throw a cap on the number of structures in system, either with a hard limit or with multiplicative tax/upkeep costs for each additional structure beyond the first three. Make it so even Goons can't afford to have 20+ structures in a system and spamming will cease to be an issue entirely.
---
I haven't checked but I didn't think it was an alpha clone skill. After all, most of the stuff you need it for is command bursts.
---
Prediction: It's gonna anchor but goons will **still** find a way to feed
---
You know there's a new default overview added just a few months ago?
---
I haven't done the math, but I suspect downtime would occur before you could fly far enough.
---
I'm not quite sure what you're on about, there are no "rich blobs" because all blobs are inherently rich these days.
---
Man that was a great write up, and I agree with all your points. I stopped playing in 2014 after /:jumpfatigue/: was introduced, and I have noticed a massive change in how the community aspect of the game is being handled. There's a distinct lack of communication from CCP and the gutting of the community team is clearly apparent. 
---
I came back because I missed the beast but it feels a lot different than when I left especially when regarding AT and other community events, now it's just free sp and giveaways rather than meaningful content.
---
Locking the right target, source: am in test and have watched how bad mainfleet is at shooting primaries.
---
citadel spam with shit timers is still a thing in w-space too. Most people don't want to remove 20+ raitarus from someones home just to stop them saving most the loot.
---
Yeah it only takes one character to hit dock
---
How I'm feeling about eve nowadays: F
---
Tax and multiplicative costs make it harder for other entities to form beachheads in other people's spaces; I would like to see a hard cap on Keepstars in a constellation through an IHUB upgrade in some manner, even though I know this would disallow Keepstars for lowsec/NPC null (but honestly it would incentivize actually holding space at that stage).
---
I feel the same way chasing after ratters, to me nothing more boring.
---
Wait are you saying that NC totally gave up?        
---
Like it was proven that you can just suicide dreads and kill anchoring keepstar.
---
This war is great, never before did so many people get baited.
---
That's the point. The "rich" was comparative to "normal", not another type of blob.
---
Solutions that have a negative effect on everyone are not the solutions we need, because not everyone is causing issues with structure spamming. We need solutions that directly target those who are causing issues.
---
Adding stront back to the game and removing timers for low-power structures doesn't stop a group like Goons from being able to spam 50+ structures in a single system. We need a fix for that. Specifically for that.
---
Huxley &gt; Orwell
---
UALX numbers were IIRC: 103 legacy titans (4 of them armor), 48 imperium shield titans vs around 185 titans from FRT, skillu, PL, TRI etc. The legacy + imperium side came out about even on titan kills because of tether and throwing about 400 dreads directly into Valhalla as well as the necessity of the attackers to shoot the anchoring KS with more DPS then the normal damage cap because of TIDI fuckery.
---
Hole control and door stopping is not indicative of an eviction. These are processes used to protect your fleet from an unknown fleet(s). Generally speaking, if someone is bringing a fleet in, they already know what you have and will bring the perfect fleet to counter yours or double the numbers with more logi. This process is also used for anchoring and un-anchoring structures.
---
Wow - this is really cool because this was literally a suggestion from someone at the Little Things round table at Eve Vegas 2018 and Karkur was very interested to make it happen, and here we are!
---
where do I sign up this sounds FUN

If only you could use insta-undock/dock spots...
---
I just did, well tbh on 2004 char
---
Don't be sad mr skeleton
---
Killah Bee said today on Talking In Stations they could do that but it would cost more in dreads than what the keepstar was worth and we would just drop another one.  They would run out of dreads before we ran out of keepstars to drop
---
Well they scream high value cargo to go along with their blingy hull killmail
---
Yeah, come out. It's easy for new players to make money right now because of how secure and lucrative nullsec is, **even as a daytripper**. My friend, before coming to join us in test, made his first billion running sansha sites in Stain. There's shittons of money even solo right now, getting into ships is easy, getting skilled up is easy.
---
As for fights, the game needs more new blood out looking for content, because every theatre right now is super risk averse. The community needs to contribute more to the health of the game, and I think the voices in the big alliances in favour of that are getting louder.
---
:getin:
---
I think that's fine.
---
Say you're BRAVE. You have 10 structures in your home system (shouldn't need more than that, even for a group that large -- these aren't POSes, they're stations with infinite capacity). You then go to war with TEST. So you want to anchor another 3 structures as FOBs -- yes, it will cost you extra.
---
But you're going to war. I think the additional cost is justified, because war costs money to wage. If you want to pay less to wage war, then dump the amount of structures in your system. Maybe you don't need 10. Maybe you can do with just 5.
---
I don't think a hard cap would make sense for Keepstars. It would just completely hand over the keys for supers to large groups that don't need that type of exclusivity.
---
I do want to see sov tied into structure mechanics though. I'd rather see a "flagship" citadel (just a citadel that's keyed for sov) that replaces TCUs and stations, and can take system upgrades as special modules to replace I-Hubs.
---
&gt;Adding stront back to the game for structures and removing timers from low-power structures doesn't stop a group like Goons from being able to spam 50+ structures in a single system. We need a fix for that. Specifically for that.
---
Removing timers will help alleviate that; if you think that balancing structures around a price or tax will fix it, it will not; Goons were already infamous for having an advanced financial team that can manage their warchest allowing them to take hits that would bankrupt most alliances. Taxes on the citadels will not stop them one bit, especially now that they have trillions flowing in every month.
---
When I was a goon, I actually made great money doing this.
---
For lowsec it's dscan pvp like hell right now. I see guys out in worms, kikis, garmurs, etc, I have \_NO IDEA\_ who wants to fight those rock paper scissors matchups. I don't get a lot of good fights in lowsec. Also a lot more ganky combat recons now that instaslide is gone. Honestly FW is in a really shit place right now.
---
In jspace, covert ops is still big, combat recons are still big, etc. You usually start off with a gank and it escalates, much like in null.
---
The tax could be even more severe. 1, 2, 3 are flat costs, 4 is x2, 5 is x4, 6 is x8, 7 is x16, 8 is x32, 9 is x64, 10 is x128, 11 is x256, etc.. Even Goons couldn't afford to pay, say, 100 trillion ISK each month for just a few extra Astrahus.
---
Ultima Online is still up.
---
EverQuest (the original) is still up.  So's EverQuest II.
---
It really doesn't take that much money to keep an MMO online, which means they can stay up with a rather small playerbase.
---
In EVE's case, they'll probably need to shrink the galaxy if the playerbase gets too small, but that's really not hard to do.
---
Even the fleet size isn't really relevant. With 5 minute siege cycles, a properly fit Dread isn't going to fall to a POS focus firing on it.
---
i think it lasted for 2-3 years before it died
---
skill farmer complaining about free stuff. as ccp guard would say HTFU

And when they do undock, all faction titans will remain docked.
---
Also known as a work camp or internment camp, it's a prison where people are put to work to support the expenses of their imprisonment.
---
Flycatcher too.
---
The only problems Citadels have are: 1) Standup bombs aren't interceptable by defender missiles  
---
2) TiDi fights can mess with repair timer, but then again lag has always been an issue in EVE and at least now the nodes don't crack under the pressure so things are improving
---
Just enchant it.
---
Every year this comment gets more fucking stupid but people insist on saying it, I don't get it.
---
All these other comments are my alt reddit accounts
---
Will there be a fight foe this one from yhe north?
---
this week marks three years since you started posting your drawings to /r/eve 
---
is it honestly that much to ask that in three years your artwork might show some kind of progression
---
Fuck you, this is excellent work.
---
It's better than your artwork.
---
As I Goon I have to agree.
---
No. This sentence doesnt translate like that. "leci siƒô biƒá cytki dla funu (...)" means nothing more that "shooting citadels is done for fun". "we go and shoot for fun" would be "my latamy i strzelamy dla zabawy". "leci siƒô biƒá cytki dla funu" is an impersonal statement like "cooking is done for preparing food" or "breathing is done for being alive. 
---
Polish is a hard language. Very hard. And you translated it completely wrong. He was writing some obvious thing like for example "fishing is done for fun, for getting fishes for dinner, for testing new rods or for spending time with your father-in-law".
---
Siege cycles used to be 10 minutes.
---
It took 4x to 6x coordinated gunners, with 2x neuts to empty the cap (step one).
---
Was able to use it on my old steam account without any issue. :)
---
They want you to skill inject it.
---
Which corp?
---
Really? You are complaining about OC? I don't think you understand reddit much,
---
If it‚Äôs taken you might as well delete the post
---
Yes check forums
---
wewlad
---
Goons are dying.
---
&gt; Not really. Certain in-game mechanics have allowed one player group to swell in membership and resources to the point where competition is no longer possible, so they're just about to wipe the map and nobody can stand up to them. 
---

Will attendees be getting Skins, same as the other events?
---
Maybe he can setup a bee sanctuary, can't sting a skeleton.
---
Nice drawing, I like your art.
---
Goons died after WWB, PanFam said so.
---
&gt; goons stopped the "we're here to ruin your game" narrative a long time ago
---
Agree.  The people who made the original goons would beat mittens and his kittens with a glitter covered dildo until he bled from the ears.
---
I have hope that maybe it turns around one day,  but it‚Äôs not looking good.
---
Im a relatively new player. 
---
Just joined FRAT. 
---
Have no idea whats going on with botting/bots?! 
---
Just want to have fun and do some fleets.
---
And this makes me kind of sad :D
---
Nice art btw, like it
---
That has quite an Isengard-y look to it. Nice work!
---
join goons, play the game in easy mode  
---
suck some mittani stick, make a shitton of money in your VNI  
---
fly your third titan after the 5th month, boast on reddit and claim victory  
---
tbh its a perfect alliance for a newbro, you'll be able to shower in ISK very fast
---
Isn't it nice that CCP values it's customers so much they only ever run such promotions on Steam.
---
Just an FYI- the only bots that are being banned are ones that run absurdly long. If your VNI bot only rats 4-6 hours 3-4 days a week max you're all set.
---
So the newbro Corp of goons is Karmafleet I don't have any personal experience with them but from what I heared over the years they are as good a noob corp as any other of the powerblocks. You would do well joining one of them. (Goons = Karmafleet, NCPL = Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies)
---
When it comes to the banter it's pretty much that banter I don't know a single guy that has serious ill will towards any other alliance it is a game after all although grudges exist and goons used to be the bad guys "We aren't here to destroy the game we are here to destroy *your* game" was a saying I belive. But in recent years they aren't any worse than the rest of the powerblocks.
---
The post doesn't really have anything to do with bots though?
---
Nice
---
Interesting
---
buy one more plex - buy ship - get killed - buy one more plex ... never ending cycle of CCP
---
Now you know the truth
---
I'm interested in your knowledge
---
Hey man. Don‚Äôt make me press F1 on you.
---
No but since everyone on eve reddit is talking about bots, I thought this is kind of a rule or something
---
Yeah but that's not working as intended so why would they change anything to enable even more people to do it?
---
*woooosh*
---
You thought wrong.
---
Can confirm: This post has nothing to do with botting.
---
I'm sorry if I ruin this.........................but where is the "dickbut"?
---
**~~HEY CCP~~**
---
What are you doing? 
---
What do you have planned? 
---
Let us know, it's good for business. Happy customers stay.
---
Thanks for clarification.
---
I mean honestly its working out just fine.  Ore is super cheap.  If you want that bonus couple % you deserve to have your ass stuck in a freighter hauling with the rest of the spodbrains chasing those couple million isk.
---
You're right. Nobody ever clicks those random links in jita local.
---
What is doorstopping in a wormhole?
---
Dead Star Syndicate is also pretty active in west coast. Only problem may your SP if your recently new.
---
Couldn't you just web/tackle the monitor and expect the same thing - for someone else to take over?
---
Let me know if you figure out how to get under 8 accounts, which is how many i currently have subbed
---
On his briefcase
---
I will quit the game before joining goons.
---
THE FUTURE
---
I know you are not He, you just a wannabee
---
I gotta admit, I'm looking forward to a flood of Korean players coming into the game.
---
More client localization is better for the game.
---
Hence my point about bots being largely impossible to discover. Players whose role it is to resolve inter-player conflicts are inundated with claims that someone or other are botting, but when you get down to the basics of in-game actions that are provable using player-developed tools and ESI information, a good bot is indistinguishable from a middling-to-good player. That point, though, is one Team Security are either unaware of, or are actively ignoring, and I know where my money would be, given how long CCP Peligro has been at this. The visibility of catching some is better from a PR perspective than the invisibility of catching many.
---
&gt; following what now appears to be an attempt to meta-game the CSM.
---
wow people actually believe this, amazing.
---
Preach! What's the point of the game when nothing can be lost? Plex vault and asset safety is killing the game!
---
They say they need to have asset safety to accommodate returning players, but how many current players are lost because nothing is at stake any more?
---
getting a second account
---
Correct me if i'm wrong but didn't the 425million go into the pockets of the former investors?
---
Only time i ever used them was to kill griffin navy issues with a kestrel in low sec before the ecm changes. Some people would just tunnel in and not warp off even though i was jammed and couldn't tackle them back.
---
If i wanted to be a bee i'd just need to reinstall
---
The difference of information FC has (even for more high-level fleet command) while still on grid and removed from grid/system is immense, and - again back to my first reply - finding and keeping alt lists of all key members of hostile groups was big part of it. It included random dps alts that just anchored, whatever scout alts there were, link alts etc. - so no, web/tackle is incomparable to "alpha and pod home" if you rinse-and-repeat until enemy fleet runs out of people capable of commanding it.
---
And back to the last point - how many secondary/backup anchors can you keep webbed at once without hostile fleet deciding to just screw it and anchor on webbed guy since 20% of the fleet was webbed anyway?
---
Yea, about that 3rd Titan after 5 months.  I think you're overestimating somewhat the value of a VNI tick.
---
The game, not a system. :)
---
the vast majority of ships can warp out just fine since faction police webs you before pointing
---
Beta cuck fetish
---
Take this gold you bastard
---
The fools don't even know their own universe mechanics!
---
OP did you even read the book? Did you understand the content if you did? Your reference is light years away from 1984\`s context.
---
Really puts all the "EVE is dying" posts into perspective, eh? The players make EVE a terrible and boring place for new players and then wonder why nobody wants to join the game.
---
Nope, haven't started a new player in a long time. Good to hear. Thanks for the info.
---
Love the videos man. Keep em comin!
---
Karmafleet
---
I can only add that you should spend a week or two in highsec.  Ask a LOT of questions.  Try completing the starter missions the first week.  By your 3rd week you should have enough grasp of the game to try PvP.  Ask how to fit a fleet PvP tackle ship (lowest skip point barrier of entry) and make an effort to go on a free roam sometime that 3rd week, voice comms are a must but you can get by if you are able to listen (ie you don't have a mic).  If no one will take you, hit me up.  I am a poor FC but I subscribe (live) for spaceship explosions!  Madullier is the correct spelling of my last name, I had a typo setting up my Reddit account.
---
it was a bit of a joke mate, yeah
---
If you did low-sec exploration and want to step it up join a null or WH corp that lets you do whatever and explore better space.
---
You really have to decide what you want to do, my current goals are to make the max possible PI profits with two accounts over a month (excel says around 8B), and generate at least 2 billion gas and/or ice mining in C5 systems.
---
Being west-cost and all the sites being taken by then is a non-issue, they spawn throughout the day. Even if you don't want to do sites in W-space you need to learn how to use them to get around, if you are half awake with cov-ops it's relatively safe to traverse and end up in a new pocket of null.
---
With this in mind the guy who wanted to recruit me was very nice and helpful, provided a shit ton of useful links about eve even gave me the brief on what are the major factions, Initially when I saw karmafleet immediately thought of reddit, did not even know karmafleet is part of goons.
---
I‚Äôve also seen that test is another major corp that seems to be more appreciated on this subreddit but I doubt they would have a noob.
---
Like I said any general input about which corps are ok what to look for etc.. is very welcome
---
It is quite common to do when companies are looking for buyouts. All you are doing in trying to up the value or share price on sale. There are many companies that only exist to be bought out. Tech sector for one example.
---
What do you mean?
---
haha, that's not rock
---
Yeah get with the program people, the new meta is removing the places you can dock from space too.
---
No u
---
aww, the nancy man looks like a qt. i feel bad now
---
Arent you guys RAZOR?
---
Jita isn't a 0.9 system really, it has a custom Concord response and disabled most spawns.
---
The larger structures have a higher strategic value then the mediums, plus they aren't as easily placed and spammed. The grind through mediums is tedious, as even an inactive group can shove enough fuel in them to keep them running for ages. So if not a reduced number of timers how about removing the damage cap so they can be taken down quicker? Imo that would hurt your normal people more then having one less timer to worry about
---
wow nice comeback
---
Exactly they need a tool that will dig through their own server data they have logs on their end as well
---
Ticket holders will get a skin code sent to the character they registered on
---
Eh, gonna ask you of all people  
---
How does making more accounts actually work? Do I need a different email?
---
I see.  Yes, headshotting the FC's is a valid strat (maybe less so now) but as others have commented, it leads to dull fights we're the enemy leaves or welps, which seems boring imho.
---
The standard health and safety swastika
---
Ah, okay.  You're not being scammed at least (that isn't allowed in karma). :p
---
Karma is the biggest corp in GSF.  They're very newbie friendly, and have top-tier support for newbies.  They have access to everything anyone else in the alliance has (which, again, tons of support), and then some.  My understanding is there could be a little delay in getting through the recruitment process, but that's really the only bad thing I could say about them.  It's a huge corp, you may or may not like that aspect, but if you want a closer-knit group, look into SIGs and squads once you get in -- they're great for that.
---
When an offender is on the end of their sentencing, and have shown decent behavior, they are allowed to take trade school classes and hold jobs in the free world to build up their personal accounts. This way they can be readjusted to living outside the prison walls and and have less chance of failing once they are released.
---
Wrong kind of work prison. I should have specified. Work-release.
---
You may appreciate a story I heard on the radio today.
---
Chuck Jones's father was convinced that he'd be a business success.  However, every business his father started had failed.
---
His father was always so certain of success, that he'd have the new company's letterhead printed before the company was even a reality.
---
When the company later failed, there was always letterhead leftover, which he gave to his children to doodle on.
---
Despite the father's strict rule to use only one side of the letterhead, so that it would be consumed as quickly as possible, Chuck Jones had a supply of letterhead to doodle on that lasted him through childhood, and into adulthood.
---
Chuck Jones would one day approach executives at Warner Brothers with an idea, and strike a deal for a short animated feature about a hapless coyote and his pursuit of an indomitable roadrunner.
---
The first episode was titled:  'Fast and Furry-ous'
---
An entire series of cartoons would follow, and later be known world-wide under the umbrella of 'Looney Tunes'.
---
/u/Catlos please don't ever stop 'Post-it' drawing!
---
And the deal was *up to* $425M
---
Half of that figure was guaranteed, the other half was tied to CCP's/EVE's performance
---
joecuster is right tbfh.
---
Pretty much hit the nail on the head. Great write up. Not sure how much longer Eve can go on before it collapses under its own weight or incompetence. But when its the only game in town like this, you keep drinking the kool-aid.
---
&gt;Which corps are ok what to look for That depends A LOT on what you want to do. If you just want to find your feet in EVE for now join one of the Corps I mentioned above they are all good ones and will help you understand EVE and find content you enjoy. If you are looking for more specific help you would need to tell us what you are looking for theres a corp/alliance for everything. 
---
Oh and about joining TEST the redditwarrior alliance has just about everyone blue on TQ so if you ever feel like shooting someone you might want to look elsewhere.
---
You really don't need to go that in depth about your cuck relationship amigo, but no worries champ you'll get there one day!
---
The goons beat the drums

Looks like he needs to give Miguel his blessing so he can put his picture on the ofrenda.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve also seen that test is another major corp that seems to be more appreciated on this subreddit but I doubt they would have a noob.
---
I don't want to discourage you from joining Karma -- they're great, but I want to correct you on this.  TEST isn't going to turn away newbies either, and http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Brand_Newbros directly targets newbies.  I'm not too aware of what their support stuff is, but I'm sure it's pretty good.
---
Nope you can even friend invite your email to get the 750k sp
---
I checked [sov.space](https://sov.space), and it seems that Amarr have bounced back (iirc, a couple of months ago Minmatar were in control). Did something (i.e. actual fighting) happen or did  just the FW alts / bots switch to the other side because the Minmatar LP was devalued too much? :P
---
Are there any sites with news about FW, or is it just famers nowadays so there's no need for a FW news site?
---
Everytime you complete a site, another site spawns. Your TZ has nothing to do with it. Broaden your area or join a null corp.
---
He still has an wormhole space corp.  It's one of his alts.
---
Thanks a lot mate, really good stuff.
---
I am seriously considering the karmafleet thing. It seems really up my alley.
---
Was just worried about what the deal was with all the goon hating on the subreddit.
---
Some one paid attention while at the re-education camp.
---
yikes
---
In the age of skill injectors, why not just use 3 characters on one account?  I am itching so hard to stop winning at the game and play again with one account and 3 toons.
---
yummy intact armor plates...
---
Small gang is a great place for alts. Backpack bifrost alt, sabre alt if you find something big to hold, ceptor, even a simple Nano ship like a gila isn't a bad idea
---
Yeah it's just banter and propaganda. Some of it is realy good at times especially during war-time but don't take anything you see on this reddit to serious.
---
I cant remember what account is linked to steam :(
---
Horde may do all of that but I offer as FC the ability to instill in new players a sense of worth, and to show them how little value dying actually has in the early game. I find that it teaches them to take risks when they see fit, because after all, it‚Äôs just pixels.
---
WH has seen a big increase in Sabre/Kikimora solo/squad doctrines. Both ships are strong. Asteros and garmurs are quite common too.
---
up to 425m to make it look like eve is doing better than it is, i doubt it's really worth that much or that the goals set were realistic
---
Oh, okay. For people who don't know that's a place people have to report back to every day. Basically you can go to work from jail because you're not a significant flight risk.
