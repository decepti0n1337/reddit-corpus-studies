Right. But thing is that Wingspan do evictions.

---
Cal/Gal facwar is dead. Amarr/Minnie facwar seems to be the new hotness where people all fight. Galmil all went to nullsec (a lot of them are former nullsec people anyway) and Calmil is like 80% bots atm.

Took roam to amarr facwar a couple weeks ago, got good fight in less than 5 minutes.

DREDDIT IS RECRUITING. Seriously we are really trying to get a small gang core going in Dreddit and looking for nerds. We have some good west coast people (I'm one of our east coast FCs for corp stuff). 
---
Wormhole or lowsec pirate corp could be good too, I will ALWAYS recommend Stay Frosty if you want to operate in low.
---
Also Reddit has no idea how well clone soldier + mordu + lowsec DED hunting fuckin prints money.
---
Only under very specific, unique circumstances. We are not going around evicting people.
---
I thought it was.
---
I had one account from RMR to Trinity.  I mostly left it unsubbed with the exception of Power of Two promotions.  I only had two accounts up and running for a good long haul during Odyssey.  Then I became an hero in game.  Now I shitpost with 0 accounts subbed or active because the game is far more interesting to read about than it is to play.  
---
Unless you need links for small gang stuff, need caps for backup, need toons in different corps for spying while laundering isk from non spy accounts or vice versa, need scouts for the fleet you are flying in or need more cyno alts for move ops, you really only need one account.  Now that you can dock supers, that extra account is useless for a super alt.
---
Ouch man you better get him some cream for that burn.
---
Anyone trying to 'replace' CCP Guard is in for a bad time. That dude was just awesome, and while the position might get filled, they can't replace the certain *je ne sais quoi* that man brought with him into a room or across social media.
---
People multi-boxing with roquals aren't paying for 59 subscriptions. The accounts pay for themselves. If anything , CCP is losing money.
---
is this a troll or serious? can't tell
---
Who you lookin to evict?
---
They just don't do hard evictions
---
If you want, I can repost it so you can upvote again.
---
Imagine thinking everyone who does not agree with you actually being in goons, haha.
---
We've got 30+ dad people who have to drop fleet in test, everybody more or less accepts RL &gt; eve. Hell one of our corp FCs has to do that sometimes.
---
What's a Gate Pass?
---
We don't think but we hope.. if you really have 50+ active accounts you have a problem
---
You must have missed the post a few days ago when that ex CSM member pretty much entire confirmed much of this "non issues" -- as well as the fact that the only thing Hilmar knows about EvE is how to spell it. 
---
Sad state of affairs indeed.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
So if I am following you. This change is going to make using a faction gun a very attractive thing if you want to bling out a ship
---
Spending time on bridges, gate camps and pos bashing are honestly some of the most chill memories Ive got of Eve. Late nights of PoCo bashing where the real fuel was spiced rum and someone inevitably passing out.. Quality time with the bros.
---
Complain and assert facts now; verify later.  
---
/s
---
Exactly, citadel shots are literally the opposite of fun
---
Eve ages way better then any other mmo. I think it will continue to bring mature gamers into it when they grow board with button mashing mmos. The problem is that we as players need to do more to help new players and make it a fun place to be. Also more stuff needs to blow up
---
If they just added a pvp 1v1 arena in every trade hub there would be a huge influx of players
---
It is meowkitten and his panfam cohort, better watch out so they don’t start PMing you threats for talking shit on reddit.
---
That is what this game needs. With leader boards and isk entry fees.
---
Wormhole is fine with one account and a good Corp.  When it’s slow you can scan a chain and find content to ambush or fleet up for.
---
Where do you think the PLEX they use to sub their accounts comes from? It doesn't magically spawn on the Perimiter market. People buy that stuff for real cash and sell it to the people who use it to sub their accounts.
---
It makes little difference to CCP whether *you* pay for it with your own money or if somebody else pays for it with their money. Either way CCP is getting the money.
---
Yep this. It’s impossible to get someone to play this game long enough to start to like it. “What do you mean I can’t actually make my ship turn with asdw”? I quit dumb game
---

---
You can use the same email as many times as you want, I have 13 accounts total, 8 active at basically all times. Having at least 2 is very very handy, even if you train multiple toons on the 2md one and keep your main training steadily, it's very helpful.
---
Yeah, you're right I forgot about that
---
Great video the first drop was well matched with the awesome system of a down song the explosion wow!
---
Dont listen to those who instead of helping just put down others they just try to get rid of what they can achieve
---
No, we need a "Throw out the trash" button that trashes any pointless shit worth less than 1m. I'm sorry CCP but seriously some of this crap, you had to be there to understand it. Some, I admit, is timeless....Sort Dragons Guide to Diplomacy is the gift that just keeps giving.
---
Me leaving a corp after just stealing a ton of their stuff
---
Exploration.
---
Ohhhhh, yeah I'm familiar with work-release. Wasn't sure what a work prison was though
---
Why wouldn't they believe the truth?
---
A truly based and unique opinion.
---
I'm not mad I'm not in that deck. Really, I'm not.
---
*stomps off*
---
He's not wrong, though.
---
TL;DR: the EVE 'style' of game interfaces and mechanics have become pretty common and are *relatively* easy to exploit, while also being (sometimes) kind of difficult to automate (very consistent, because consumers) protection for.
---
My 2 cents since no one has replied: the more a game relies on um... how to describe. Menu-based inputs? Where the majority of your interactions are through static objects and 'readable' text, especially consistent text (like target names and stuff), the lower the barrier to entry for automation is. Disclaimer, I've never played EVE past tutorial so that's why all my references are vague, idk how the EVE specific terms super well. 
---
And the average "coding" knowledge across the population (of gamers at least) is going way up over time. The barrier to entry for understanding like AHK input-tier of automation is pretty low too.
---
So a lot of people will just kinda try out a (1 account size, at first) setup like the one Globbby describes, just to see, *because* of the barrier to entry being so low. It's like... whatever, the setup will cost me a couple hours ot whatever, which I would have spent fucking around on comms prolly anyway. And worst case ot gets banned and my main is fine, so... whatever. 
---
And over time people sorta figure out what the "net" metric(s) is/are. And it sounds like the net for this game is just "session length average." Because it's not like CCP (or anyone else) has unlimited "high level" access to all data in their own programs. It can be a major PITA to try and "pull a stat" in general, let alone "pull enough stats on everyone, to detect all bots, automatically, and ban them, at a greater than 99% success rate" Like the scope of that, even for an internal dev team, even if it were a static environment with no new changes, *could* be pretty damn big. 
---
Disclaimer again like, idk the database structure, reporting capabilities, like. I dont even know the game *really* lol. I'm not trying to defend CCP or anyone else or make any kind of statement about botting in EVE. I'm just trying to share some insight, for what little it's worth, as someone who works in IT type stuff and also spends time around really way smarter people who spend time breaking games similar to EVE (but way more rudimentary usually, it's just... when a game is this brand of automatable on it's surface, it doesnt matter too much how shiny it is).
---
the reason you can't evict them is because no one wants to live in those systems. so it's going to be a perpetual structure grind
---
eh - but shitposting is 3/4 of the fun lol
---
WiNGSPAN has only ever done evictions of people who have had spies in corp AND have messed with intel and tripwire. It has nothing to do with how difficult the eviction may be.
---
I was expecting a meme. Left disappointed.
---
&gt;I’m sorry but you aren’t as good as you think you are.
---
How many times do we have to say we're terrible at this game?
---
&gt;once those skills go away
---
Just to clarify, you keep your Omega skills if you revert back to Alpha, its that those skills go inactive and unusable until you get back to Omega.
---
i want to enchant u
---
Exploration is what finally got me some decent ISK, and was fun to do. If you do relic and data sites in lowsec/nullsec you can make some really good money. Its what I still go back to when I want some "fun" solo stuff. You need to be careful still as you are in likely hostile space so it adds to the fun.
---
No, but he lives on in spirit
---
There should be an EVE mail on the recipient.
---
And now you know........the rest of the story!
---
Step back boys, I'll cream em!
---
In lowsec you can get literally any ship to work in small gang or solo.
---
In WH it’s mostly play fighting with heavy armor like Damnations, Bhaals, Vindis, Leshaks with triage/guard and dreads
---
Yeah I don't think Goons ever said they were good at the game. It's hard to make the case that they haven't built a good empire though.
---
FW you would be useful from day 1. Admittedly mostly for deplexing at first and then oplexing and then pvp.
---
Sidney skins incoming
---
When you activate it it only starts targeting targets that reboxed you and takes as long to target as it would if you were targeting manually (so sometimes 3+ cycles for a BS to target a frig.)
---
Anyone else notice he said NC and not NCPL.
---
jesus degenerate weebs are PvPing this is incredibly haraam
---
dunno why the reply went here, 90% sure i replied to somone talking about how POSes can only be anchored one per moon and how some systems have very little moons and they become a game of who gets majority first

He came here to tell us ships get blown up in Jita.  Restating established things is his wheelhouse.

Best thing you can do is not give up.  Best game I have ever played in my life.  Join a corp.  get on comms.  Talk to people.  Ride together. Die together

I thought I had typed it all out, that was my bad.

Get a wormhole with a static nullsec.

Oooohhh this is fun. Do Snuff next.

Moral of the story

Never forget to buy a gate permit
---
The way you have phrased thus kinda tells me that you know why you were banned. They haven't confirmed it do you think there is doubt.
---
I'm gonna guess and say that you sold isk.
---
Can one make links with these that look like a contract but actually the undock button?  Asking for a friend.
---
Let me get this right.

You bring X thousand dudes with whatever amount of titans.

The rest of EVE could actually step up, but I guess it's easier to just cry endlessly about goons.

Oh? You are virgin?

tl;dr

What you said is so inaccurate and so incorrect, I am beginning to think you have zero experience im actual business practices and M&amp;A.

I think it is impressive to have more f1 monkeys you have to be doing something better than your opponents

---
Now is as good of a time as any. The steam sale gets you into the game with some free SP and Omega time. Give it a try, if you don't like it then you aren't out anything.
---
That’s a great story thank you for sharing it.
---
This is the kid who got bullied in school, and he believed his mom when she told him "they're all just jealous of you honey."

Yep, and the magic sudden advent of login-inflating metrics all over the place like dailies proves they really want the rest of that payout.

He was the face of the company, him finally leaving pretty much sums up how far the company has swirled down the toilet.

Umm if you hit it at the same time all the time, why didn't he just set the stront level to his preferred timer?

Lol. I’ll move on to toilet paper for my shit posts

Have you tried renting? You pay nullsec alliances to not murder you and you can rat away
---
If someone wants to come grind down Delve, they are welcome to do it.
---
Both even. I agree.
---
I get the sentiment.  
---
Incoming longpost, I tried to make it short and failed miserably.
---
When I was first starting out in EVE and really first getting sucked in, I felt like the the devs shared a really close bond to the players.  They weren't some gaming company with executives, they were dudes who loved games and above all - loved EVE.  They were One Of Us.  We knew what the some of the teams were working on, and the minds (and posters) behind them.  In short: they had a personality.
---
This wasn't without its issues, obvi.  There were tons of swings and misses, and plenty of instances where we collectively wished for a more structured gaming company.  We got mad, they got mad, but it always resulted in a stronger bond.  The community, apart from vocal fringes, had a sense of cautious optimism.  "Yea CCP will fuck up, but we'll set them on the right path again n b d"
---
Somewhere just before Aegis sov, the relationship between player and dev started to sour.  The CSM felt like it leaked every month, the community was leaq'in right along with it.  Then Aegis sov hit and we kind of lost our shit collectively.  The cautious optimism started to shift more toward doom-and-gloom-unless-proven-otherwise.  Not everyone, obvi, and not all at once - but that was a general shift in the mood.  
---
From my perspective, CCP pulled back hard.  We had the big name devs we all knew and love, and they kept at it, but the new guys seemed to be increasingly afraid of us.  Maybe not afraid, but they seemed to value our views less and less.  
---
But we still had Stuff.  The community team was always there, tons of side projects were sourced and enabled even if it was an against-all-odds scenario.  There are literally hundreds of podcasts that 99.9% of the players never listened to that had a Dev on to give insight. Seagull always seemed approachable and One Of Us, not some executive who only cared about the bottom line.  
---
While there was pullback, shit was still getting done and the names we knew were still active - just not as much.  The relationship was still swinging away from cautious optimism, and we began to lose some of the public devs once and for all.  I remember the exact moment after a Fanfest panel when someone took Fozzie's quote out of context about AT prizes (where he said something akin to "I literally don't know what they're going to be, we legit just went through all the races" and it was reported "NO AT PRIZE SHIPS THIS YEAR DAWG HURF BLUF")   I think honestly he was just done at that point, which sucks because I loved to read his posting.  He, along with Rise, was our Golden Boy.
---
Then we lost the Community team, people started leaving the company (a totally normal thing btw, turnover in the games industry is like 18 months), and we didn't really know the new people - and they didn't really want to know us.  Somehow, though, shit kept getting done.  I have literally no insights into the goings on of the company, but it really did seem like CCP Guard and CCP Falcon just started working twice as hard.  Maybe they've got cloning tech, who knows.  
---
A few things fell through the cracks, and existing projects really got that 11th hour feel to them.  But fuck it - we'll do it live.  There were some really fucking ambitious projects taken on, too.  The whole "hey let's do 7 fanfests instead of 1" thing, to go along with the Triglavian Invasion theme.  Really ducking cool honestly. And we got a new community guy, CCP Dopamine - things finally seemed like they were going in the right direction.  
---
Buuut, wasn't perfect.  The AT got axed, because instead of doing it last minute with the same rules CCP opted to delay it by a year.  It's a shit situation, but honestly I'd rather have no AT for a year then the same one twice.  Then CCP Guard announced he was stepping down - a huge blow because he seemed to be one of the last pillars of Devs Who Didn't Kinda Hate Us And Made Other Devs Not Hate Us Too.  Then Brisc-gate happened, which was just fuckin weird.  And now we're here.  We still get forum posts and dev blogs, but can you name the executive producer?  
---
I honestly believe that EVE has endured not because of its gameplay, not because of its art, but because of the community and - most importantly - the relationship between the community and the devs.  It's unique to gaming, and its value cannot be measured by any metric.  
---
It's not just hiring a new guy to fill in for Guard; we have a responsibility too.  It's vital that we swing the pendulum back toward "cautious optimism" and away from "doom-and-gloom", to encourage more interaction.  And it's up to CCP to throw more dudes in front of us, to talk with us, and deal with our sperging.
---
I'm thinking about this for our crew, too. Access to nice nullsec for explo/ratting/PVP, and the scanning everything only has to happen once a day assuming you let the hole expire. Not a lot of overhead!
---
Don’t know where you’ve been but there are always fights in Black Rise. Cal/Gal might not be what it used to be but it is far from dead in terms of solo and small gang PvP. Lots of neutral gangs come through looking for fights also.
---
Pvp, exploration, mission running, null sec ratting, etc. You can do most things in eve solo, it really it comes down to what do you enjoy.
---
join the tapirium of the galaxy to learn cuck and incel powers
---
I mean, I don’t think you’re wrong. But at the same time, even if creating a robust and nuanced system for detecting bots is a huge pain in the ass, if this problem represents an existential threat to the game, you have no choice but to address it. 
---
I have a half-baked theory that it might be easier and provide better secondary effects to tweak the gameplay in ways that make it more difficult to automate in the first place (as in, make PvE combat more interactive). 
---
Both is probably the answer. In one form or another.
---
Classic fucking Gobbins honestly
---
Shout out to Charlie, the real MVP

Come on, if you are gonna link it link the whole trailer
---
didnt know how
---
Clips are limited in length, but you can link a start time for a video for twitch. Won't stop until the end of the whole video, but has no length limit that way.
---
me mad? na...enjoying the drama here....Jita market its pretty fun tho
---
If link does not go to the correct time, trailer starts at 33:17.
---
Yes. Started playing in January and I’m having a blast. I don’t have any experience of Eve of years prior, so talk of “it used to be better” is meaningless to me. It’s super fun to me now and that’s all that really matters
---
Seriously, though, join a corp ASAP. Many big and small alliances (a collection of corps) have a “university” corp solely dedicated to supporting and training new players. Dedicated and talented pilots can be hard to come by, so there’s an incentive for us to invest in new players to get them up to speed. So look for an alliance that has one of these corps and join up.
---
30? I think its closer to 50
---
Elise, I'm happy to work with CCP and put a ton of positive media their way, if I feel like they deserve it. I ran INN's interviews at EVEsterdam this year, and I thought CCP's willingness to work with us and get people talking was great in-person. I'm constantly trying to fight in the corner of EVE tournaments too - like you say, we need to swing the pendulum, but we can only swing it if the guys at CCP want to help us out on that. 
---
As it is, I can name the EP. CCP Burger is a fantastic guy, and honestly one of the most conversational devs I've come across at an RL meet. But earlier tonight, I was wondering about the difference between Burger and Seagull when it comes to a roadmap. Upwell structures are an anomalous idea in terms of feature production, but we knew what the rough plan was. We knew which features went with which Upwell structure, which were folded into the structures that went live, and what the future plans are.
---
Currently, the roadmap is being fueled by lore and a story-progression. I love this, a s a videogamer who always enjoys having a yarn spun for me. On top of this, the Triglavians and the current Invasion is a great concept, but I can't help but think that they could do more. Additionally, if they can't, they can at least tell us why more is impossible at the current time, surely? The community is not unreasonable, and we are (mostly) beyond eager to help CCP out if they give us even the slightest reason to. The issue I have currently is that I'm not seeing the reason in recent months, and I doubt I'm the only one feeling this way.

EvE alliance reddit roast is now the new AT

try to take on an abysal site
---
&gt; In EVE's case, they'll probably need to shrink the galaxy if the playerbase gets too small, but that's really not hard to do.

Fascinating idea. Love it. And there’s this Invasion thing happening in a few days...
---
Webpage is working for some while others are getting a 404, so idk. Its working for me personally
---
These two statements are not necessarily mutually exclusive: you can think you are terrible and be even worse. (this is normally known as being in the bastion)
---
I'm renting. I get to do what I want with my corp and live in null. Might be worth checking out.
---
How much do you pay to rent?
---
can you paste the content for us that are 404. thnx
---
Idk how much renting costs, so Haven't thought about it
---
ill give ccp 2 points for effort
---
5 points for visuals and 10 points for the quip about having implants
---
&gt; if this problem represents an existential threat to the game, you have no choice but to address it. 
---
it doesn't, you had the dronelands filled to the brim with bots for a decade now and the game didn't implode. Literally the only reason people can't shut up about this shit now is because muh reddit points and people like peligro liking the attention and fanning the flames.
---
bots have always existed in eve, and they will always exist. And they aren't even in the top 10 of things killing the will of people to keep playing.
---
Moon mining. I'm in a moon mining Corp. We got a nice Hi sec system with 10 Athanors just pumping or that A, B, C ore and the higher quality moon ore every day. When a moon pops we send in a couple of Orcs scoop it up spit the Isk and the rest of the time basically do what ever we want. It's honestly like printing Isk

I mean your post hit a lot of the same notes I feel, my response wasn't necessarily directed at you but more my general feel about the situation.

Also Burger isn't the EP (though he is the creative director and an awesome community facing dude), it's ManBjorn.

You spelled trashbin wrong :)

I mean they have survived for a decade as being the biggest baddest super/titan alliance in the game and have always fallen back to dropping the hammer when they might lose.  Will be interesting to see how they adapt to being 2nd or even 3rd best now.

Yeah it takes lots of practice. Also turning on the tactical overlay helps a lot. It shows the vector in which direction your enemy is moving with an arrow.

Do something new.

---
Did CCP listen when they *probably* pushed for timely iterations on pivotal game components such as Aegis/Fozzie sov, Citadels, Rorquals, tiercide, facwarfare or Faxs?  
---
It's years and years that go by with these things still screwed. All while the Art team sits on an increased budget ^/s, the devs manage to tweak a slot layout and on a mainline ship and module or two in order to keep us busy creating/adapting a new meta, instead of bitching about the boring metas we inherited from Aegis troll ceptors, or Citadel spam, the list goes on.  
---
The CSM can bring the CCP mule to water, but they can't make it drink. Unless of course you're talking about meta gaming them into knee jerk bans...

So I installed Eve Online on Steam and now I get a Steam login showing up in the launcher and shared with my original account, When I remove it from the launcher, it just gets re-added the next time i open the game ??? Do I have to have this?
---
I thought TCF collapsed forever ago?
---
So glad I was in no chatter.
---
therefore never send to know for whom the hon hons; it hons for thee

People who get annoyed by stuff like this just don't like to have fun. No one was harmed, no one was hurt, maybe some ears were left ringing; but weaponized autism is some of the best content that any community can wish for.

The game is built for China and the far east to blow massive amounts of cash on microtransactions.    Western version, will not happen IMHO due to restrictions on loot boxes in both Europe and the US (soon).

Scan more than once a day, be aware of what all your sigs are, whether they’re inbound or outbound, and the relative mass on them. Get a good wormhole tracker and keep your connections updated.

No. But I do remember that after WWB test was really interested in you guys never holding sov again. Everyone else didn’t give a shit because it was basically impossible to actually do.

&gt; Good thing that worked out for them.

Congrats on winning the N+1 fight. Not sure why people are shocked by this since you were the biggest before being evicted from the north as well.

I beleave you need to go through the process of un-linking your account from steam to fix this, but I'm not entirely certain.

I'll throw in a plug for wormholes. People talk about wormholes as the space where you have to be hardcore. You mentioned that you have to "scan everything". Here's a secret: You don't have to be hardcore to have fun in wormholes. Find yourself a hole with a highsec, lowsec, or nullsec static. Each will have some advantages and some disadvantages for you. Have spare ships, and roll up characters on all your spare account slots. You want the absolute minimum on those accounts, but sit them in a T1 scanner. They're your lifeline when you inevitably get podded out once in a while fooling around. Now you're all set. Sure, you'll get ganked more often if you don't check your connections and roll incoming wormholes, but who cares? If you'd rather spend less time scanning and are willing to accept a bit more risk, *you can do that*.
---
I forgot with my other response: NPC nullsec might also be a good option for you. Keep in mind that there are assholes out there who will camp the shit out of you for fun (so I personally prefer wormholes with the new neighbors every day) but there is plenty of empty space out there where you can get some of the bounty of nullsec. You'll get your assets blown up eventually, but you will probably make more profit than you did in Highsec in the end even taking that into account.
---
A case could *almost* be made that there are some lore reasons for the Skins not being universally accessible across hulls that share a model - warring factions, etc.   Then they go and make Blood Raider Skins for a variety of Amarr ships.  Any trace of that goes right out the window when you're looking at ships that (in terms of lore) would be expected to be fighting side by side.
---
Now I am even happier I was in no chatter
---
Is this hell
---
You take that back. 
---
We are all unique and and it is for this reason we must all attempt to kill each other and take the others possessions at all times. 
---
What is new eden coming to ffs.
---
Nonono not at all, just RPGs. Although yeah that's a good point. AI will totally kill poker sites, right? Huh. Cause like, youd have to have programming capable of reading the screen (since theres no like, item tag or object on the screen right? Idk I assume poker sites arent displaying the cards in such a way that you could easily ask what's on the board and what each card in your hand is, positionally like you can with some games)
---
Whereas in a game like EVE, I imagine it's much easier to ask the game those kinds of questions. Logic is simpler, like, the list of questions required to ask the game in order to make a 99% good choice within the specific activity you're scripting, is relatively finite, and then executing on those tasks is relatively (to other games) simple.
---
 [Anything here?] 
---
[What is it?] 
---
(Insert X number of possibilities that all correspond to 1 next action tree that's maybe 4 or 5 unique clicks long plus copy-pasted stuff)

    Everything after this is just basic tasks, all the thinking was done already up there

---
Anyway I'm sleepy and rambling and not even capable of writing my own code lol I just thought it was interesting that a "tinkerer and shitposter and bittervet but not 100% troll" sort of character would post that, made it seem like the game is probably a little more cracked open than I realized. Which is probably dumb with how old this joint is.
---

I believe the Triglavians are only coming to show us the benefit of seeing the universe their way.

I can’t wait for them to give me one of their motherships :-).

Let me introduce you to our lord and savior...skill injectors

On a serious note, yes the game is worth returning to. With “just” 31m sp you can do a lot. Also, you can play for free in the alpha clone state if you just want to try returning and not put any money into eve until you want to (though your skills and therefore ability to do certain activities are limited).

It's the only game that I've regularly played for more than a year, so...
---
I'm still not sure what goons plans are here. Burn renter structures while they loost 100 times more back home than they will ever have the chance to kill in tribute. Typical goons propaganda about nothing more than racking up tidi and loosing a trillion on the first few days of their campaign.
---
Ok, thanks. I noticed removing it from the client/launcher crashes the launcher but leaving it alone, my regular account works just fine. I guess I'll try and ignore it for now. I thought originally it linked the accounts but didnt show the Steam User as a usable account since I set it up with an existing account. Maybe its a glitch with the newest Steam update or something.
---
Abyssal sites for isk and PvP when you want to have fun.
---
Just accept the fact that you will never "get it" and move on.  It was not meant for you, stop trying to wrap your fragile mind around it.
---
It is always to start Eve as new player. Will take a lot of time till you learn it all, explore all activities you can do.
---
Then you might get bored and whine about failed sovereignty mechanics like some if us, but that's at least 2 years from now.
---
weak
---
SP and isk aren't a problem in Eve 2019.
---
Stagnation is. Hope you can handle it and find something fun and new to do in the game.
---
i went to op2
---
Absolutely. The game has one facet that hasn't changed through the years - SP don't really matter that much. All they do is open more avenues, but you can do plenty without having 200 million.
---
I'd say, find a group that is active in your timezone. Hook up with them, and just sit around and talk shit and fly when you have time. Maybe it'll scratch the itch and you'll be done. Maybe you'll swing right back into it!

That almost sounds like a reason to respect wangspin so I must formally deny it, as reasonable as it sounds. /s

I would say part of the charm is day by day seeing skill tick slowly up, if i was offered all skill to lvl 5 right now i would probably not accept it, i have multiple 100m+ sp chars but its the time i spend on/with them that makes them feel like mine.

You can join small null-sec alliance, thats a medium point.

Also, TCUs aren't really a meaningful indicator of sov ownership, Ihubs are. And iirc Period Basis is starting to have slight problems with those?
---
Eve University (E-UNI) has a reasonably active incursion community particularly on weekends that runs mainly vanguards so you won't be making the same HQ site bank as you might with WTM, but beginner friendly and they will take alphas if you meet their skill requirements, but you do have to have to be either in euni or have been in corp in the past to run with them, on one of your charters/accounts.

Tbh don't care, extra 250k sp for new titan pilot i am training on this account.
---
what you're smelling is the 2500 goons that just moved into KQK
---
... ~~players~~ customers outside Steam don't bring enough added value for CCP to offer them such things.
---
I'm someone who tries very hard to stay optimistic, and still has a bit left for Eve as I lived through another game that got ran into the ground by its developers *hard* a few years ago. It was a much smaller game, and its playerbase went from thousands to dozens in the span of about a year and a half.
---
I don't think Eve is there yet, and as such I have a genuinely curious question: What can someone like me do to either help swing things back to optimism, either for the playerbase at large, towards CCP, or just for myself?
---
When the game arrived to battle of titan vs titan fleet you know that there was a problem, in some cases they have replaced battleships which push other time to support at best :/
---
when people can't match titan numbers there is not point to start the fight just to get farmed and provide content to your opponent
---
You are right after wwb it was pl started picking on co2 we joined in a bit later there. I mentioned some days ago indeed i wasnt happy shooting co2 and test so he is not wrong with saying bad desicions in my pov...
---
You don't imagine how much yours is.
---
Still. They want good communication: r/eve. So they give it to a few players, they get us funny quotes, and boom, million views on their video.
---
Not if people cherry pick
---
Weaponized Autism
---
I feel like if they'd brought a ton of sub-caps it would be fights all day, every day.
---
But nope.  Nobody wants to go on field with a shit load of titans that literally outnumber your entire alliance.
---
Which promotion?
---
So it will be :    
---
Vily, Innominate, Merkelchen, Aryth, Gobbins, Dunk Dinkle, Sort Dragon, Steve Ronuken, The Judge, Xenuria.
---
60 have sold at that price, 60b in profit ))
---
dead link?
---
He means undefended krabs who dpnt deploy, because thats all they can kill anymore.
---
You know there were planned 3man frigate-only abyssal sites right?
---
Dunk Dinkle for CSM
---
An A for the effort but the context is unaccurate
---
Not really - but its as good a time as you'll get without a time machine, so if you are interested give it a spin.
---
Let me know in a month whether you went home already because the sov wanding burned you out.
---
or just not be trash at the game to where you need to buy plex to pvp
---
Who in their right mind votes for Xenuria?
---
Maybe the money paid for at safety should get given to the players on the killmail, a bit like bounty payouts
---
How do you make repair drones and shield matinece drones fix your ship instead of others I dont know how to target myself.
---
https://dscan.info/v/3c4dc137fc36
---
lol that was one of the stupidest things I've ever seen over comms. Well at least they had fun doing it lol.
---
&gt;Let us know, it's good for business
---
Not for CCP. Not here. If I was responsible for talking to the people who post here I'd just shoot myself instead, it would be a better use of my time.
---
“Shit I have implants in my pod”
---
Not enough booty ma boii
---
Good Lord that fucking voiceover...
---
Just make em pay for each timer. Like 2 bil per cycle on am astra 5 bil fort and 20 bil keepstar. If you refuse to pay it simply dies and your shit is in asset safty. This would fix the number drastical and even encourage shooting them in the first place
---
Haha.
---
omg my sides
---
Only spais hon'd
---
A lot of ppl hate them and i probably get downvoted for this.. Yes they had a negative impact on the game but without skill injectors i wouldnt have stay till now without.. After a break for a couple years i was able to get into doctrine ships and what not again..
---
Imagine Dink and Xenuria in the same CSM.
---
Doublethink. Classical NC. :D
---
... is this what a ddos feels like
---
mother of gawd, that's beautiful.
---
far from even being close to correct
---
and now you feel really bad to let your dogs in wormhole space last time
---
You can't, those are only used to repair other ships, not yourself
---
If you want to rep up, use armor repairer/shield boosters or just dock at a station/structure to repair
---
i have to admit this trailer is pretty dope...
---
I guess PanFam doesn't like it when they get farmed for content.
---
Probably the most realistic part of comms there
---
Oï !
---
You’ll never be able to use your own drones or remote repair modules on yourself, since it’s impossible to lock your own ship (if you do a left click on your ships with the CTRL key pressed, it’ll start the locking animation for less than a second before giving you an error message).
---
And to be honest, logistic drones don’t have a lot of repping power by themselves if they aren’t used by logistic cruisers, so you’d get better benefit keeping combat drones and repairing your ship with local armor repairers or shield boosters, or simply docking up in a friendly station or structure.
---
Mom I'm scared
---
Tackle and ewar is extremely important, and a necessary part to making fleets successful.  It is very easy to skill into, and the ships are provided usually if need be.
---
Dude....TEST is one of the biggest blob alliances in the game. He said small/medium gang stuff.
---
OP, I think faction war would be your best bet.
---
We want to farm you for Gud Fites!! Come back!!
---
Just stole all his dogs!
---
I did my research and I’m afraid I couldn’t find any answer with hard numbers. However, I remember reading something on EVE University saying that a Rorqual could maybe keep up the Mining Index to level III all by itself if the pilot was very active, so I guess a super ratting in the system could do the same for the Military Index ? That’s speculation however, excuse me if i can’t give you a better answer :/
---
How is the best looking titan the one fewest people own??
---
We have literally no recruitment standards but superior alliance organization, that’s the secret to fielding a million driveling monkeys
---
About as much as yours.
---
I love goons.
---
and my comment, although when read plainly may seem like i directly am stating that there is no pvp in nullsec.
---
i know full well there is still fights, and pvp in nullsec, im fully aware people may say 'but we are at war now'
---
what my statement actually said, in context with the rest of the total message not just the one line read alone,
---
is that nullsec pvp is dead compared to the good days 3-4years ago, before citadels. around and about when the T3D's came in, war was proper war then, it was downright fight to the death of either side war.
---
now its who has to pay a little more SRP out of the Rorq mining tax funds
---
undefended krabs, undefended buildings. Is there really a difference? Both have zero brains
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/927292903/
---
Join a Corp that has a kill board that actually backs up what they claim.
---
We are extremely active during us west timezone.
---
Honestly it sounds like they had fun. Putting Eve politics aside that's all that really matters in games.
---
Tbf WWB mostly revolved around entosis where tenacity mattered more than raw numbers. I still think had goons as a whole fought as hard as some of their renters (who we really struggled with as PH for some time), they wouldn't have been evicted because many of those that piled on would have lost the interest and went back to whatever else they were doing.
---
Now with everything revolving around destructible structures the only metric that counts is how many titans can you bring.
---
Goons had 3 major move ops.
---
So when the spire loses ALL its ihubs its no big deal, but when a handful of PB ihubs get reffed it means something... :huge think:
---
only one is dying right now
---
I'll have to take your word for it, I'd rather not put myself through that just to see what its like.
---
Nobody was saying that. PNO is perfectly capable of fighting on their own, as their history proves.
---
makes me laugh how much goes to shit when people cant use dotlan, theyre like satnavs of the day to cabbies.
---
im proud to say i was able to maneuver my way 4mids absolutly fine, with 3 caps alone, through snuffed space. without an issue.
---
once dotaln was back up turns out i used about 7k more fuel per, but same amount of mids. :D
---
That is what spodumain does to your brain.
---
I am thinking about giving EVE another try after few years. I have started with EVE like 4 years ago, but I have only played for about 70hours.
---
I am thinking about getting back to the game right now, but I am not sure if I should continue on my old account or create a new one. I remember that there was some referral system and I got some in-game currency from the player that provided me his link. I see on steam that there is some Invasion starter pack as well for 0 USD.
---
Could you guys help me to choose what would be the best way to get started?
---
Your weapons specialization skill bonus still will not apply to them.  Tested on sisi the other day.  Still attractive as hell for crazy tight fits with nowhere to take from.  T2 guns will still be measurably better, and as such will still be the first best choice.
---
I have to admit, that level of autism makes me admiring
---
How long has it been since you have actually played? Did you ever get an email notice saying that your account was accessed through a different IP? If you truly have done nothing then it will all get worked out. CCP's timeframe on issues is way different than your idea of what their timeframe should be.
---
1.2T killed in delve so far says otherwise.
---
small/med scale pvp and good Pve sound exactly WH to me
---
Dang it I was wanting to do a tankier vexor or other drone boat with them.
---
Didn't expect this weak shit.
---
probably just my connection to it all. but ive heard alot more from what NC. have accomplished than what Goons have accomplished.
---
Do logistic drones get remote repairer boosts and remote shield boosts from the remote logistics ships?
---
Eve is dying since 16 years.
---
Other games dies in a year.
---
undefended krabs? They've been dying for days
---
Absolutely it is a good time to get into EVE!
---
The differing opinions you hear are due to how much people love this game. Players base is probably on of the most passionate you will ever encounter. From a desire of wanting the game to reach its maximum potential, you end up with a small sub-section of the community, mostly bitter vets :-) , openly criticising the game and being quite harsh. 
---
This on the surface of it all leads to some new potential players like yourself becoming worried if it's worth it.
---
Trust me, once you get in-game, if EVE ticks "your boxes", all the above mentioned negativity from some players simply becomes background noise.
---
There is a Steam promotion which currently gives you 250,000 free sp + 7 days 'double speed' skill training time, however if you get given a buddy link you can get 750,000 sp. This equates about the same as 250,000 sp + 7 days training time.
---
However, if you end up upgrading from the free to play alpha account (which has some limitations) to the Omega account (always on double speed training time + access to all ships/skills) the person that gives you the buddy link gets given around 350 PLEX (sort of an ingame item that can be converted into game money).
---
PM me here if you want a buddy link &amp; when/if you upgrade I am happy to send you the 350 PLEX that CCP will give to my account. It will be worth a small fortune (1.5 billion isk) for a new player like you.
---
This kind of sums up the state 0.0 is in. I'd say CCP should wake the fuck up but who am I kidding, they don't give a fuck if their game has become Titans Online.
---
because killing dumb krabbers is an accomplishment.
---
This is what I send people atm

join lowsec alliance. all the good ones roam null. and mostly dont have permanent hisec wardec;s
---
I lauged too hard at this. :)
---
Why should any side stop shitposting? Apparently, this is the only battlefield NC is still willing to defend. :D
---
yes, like any other drone
---
i think with all of eve he meant the 35% of total players that are not part of goons and pets
---
EVE: The CSM is now goons REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Also EVE: \*launches 2 or 3 relevant people which happen to be the same from last year's elections \*
---
Stitch is the only guy outside of Imperium who got my vote. People can't just complain about who gets elected in the CSM if they don't provide competent people.
---
Damn booshers stole my dogs.
---
Please kick Sort and include Stitch. It is now an emergency.
---
they're good drones brent
---
Even Meridian 59 is still kicking.
---
I meant does the logic ships bonuses boost the logic drones reps towards ships.
---
molok?
---
"oh shit i have implants in this pod"
---
that feel though
---
we haven't even made it to week one of the campaign yet, but if you think killing stupid people who can't understand "don't undock you rorq/super" after it gets pinged daily for 5 days is winning a war I pity you.
---
there are so many unknown eve players on CSM candidate list. omeca and all the others should do an AMA so people can hear more about who they are and what they do in eve.
---
Fuck that guy. He probably does not even know how to not get killed in highsec.
---
It’s not that hard actually. I’m working in IT and my project is all about finding bots on web services. 
---
Most of the bots are obvious: they click the same button the same place in the same manner. They have same reaction timers. All they do is basically repeats. 
---
If you will throw random timers on their actions you will see then that bots never talk in chat, never look around in eve, never go to find some stuff like you know warping from Amarr to romi and looking for prices or ship fits at the same time.
---
&gt;Now I shitpost with 0 accounts subbed or active because the game is far more interesting to read about than it is to play.  
---
This sounds familiar
---
With neural networks it’s even easier.
---
I'm not the one who claimed nothing is being flipped, am I?

I was doing a *thing* with my gf when that started.  
---
We couldn't continue.  
---
I'm laughing again by just remembering it.
---
Although it depends on what you want to do in EVE, I would say generally: no 
---
I have been through a few 'stale' cycles in the game (in nullsec terms) but this time it feels different. Unless CCP is willing to make some rigorous changes to sov, the amount of space (wh and nullsec) available, conflict drivers, etc, I dont see the game going anywhere interesting. 
---
There is too much space, sov-warfare is way too tedious timing wise, there is insane amount of structure spam. It's just all around unfun. EVE has always been a chore, but now it feels it's to no end (within the context of the game of course).
---
The EVE 10 year symphony at the start is the very music of heaven for me.
---
That was done so fantastically good, it stirs the soul every time I hear it.

we can re build, bigger stronger and more Krabs

_If we ever..._
---
Not gonna lie I wrote 5 minutes ago that out of Imperium and allies, with the exception of Stitch, most of the people  are unknown to the community and called them incompetent, which was a mistake. But, it also confirms the point: they need to show us who they are and why they should be elected.
---
Whst does it feel like to be that retarded you'd participate in something like that?
---
Say what you want about the guy (i mean he really is a slimy asshole) but sadly you gotta admit his activity level on the CSM.
---
Probably the same place your favourite uncle touched you
---
Cthulhu for CSM 14 !
---
They  were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
---
I guess you misunderstood my post. I was pointing out that hte only undefended buildings in delve that have died so far belonged to the people who are trying to act like they have invaded delve. Our Ihubs are still ours, our TCU's are still out and our stations are still standing, all you have managed to do is kill a bunch of window licking krabs who can.t follow orders and didn't deploy with their allinace mates. In other words "nothing of value was lost."
---
I have actually been super anxious of this video cause I love seeing move ops. Large or small, it's awesome to see.
---
He will make his coalition to vote for him. Like he just saved them from goons.
---
20 accounts isn't that tough though I expect I'll be out of practice by the time the war ends
---
Wait, olmeca actually took my advice? I'm literally shocked.
---
define "flipped" because here is PB in dotlan,  [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Period\_Basis](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Period_Basis)  and its still all goon, you haven't even managed to actually flip a single Ihub yet, so it looks like you are claiming to have done something that hasn't even happened yet...
---
Why would they show a great trailer like that on stream without having it ready to release on their YouTube channel in 1080p+ goodness? 
---
Now the only videos out there are twitch streams and YouTube reuploads in shoddy quality (like this one - no offense, OP).
---
This is beyond stupid, it makes no sense at all. This is when they should be building hype and letting people crosspost the official trailer upload to other places, trying to bring in new players, but instead it's just falling a bit flat on its ass.
---
Am I crazy for thinking this?
---
Actually TEST is way better to my surprise
---
fml lmao
---
Out of curiosity, what was that game and what do you think happened?
---
It's honestly not clear why *anyone* would want to run after that disaster. CCP making very inflammatory public accusations against an individual (which should really never happen even if they have ironclad proof) without apparently even the slightest attempt at independent verification does not represent the kind of organization I would want to waste my time volunteering for.
---
From the discussions with some recent candidates whose NDAs expired, it doesn't even sound like they really are even accepting much guidance or honestly communicating with more recent CSM and I doubt that's changed for the better in the last few years.
---
It seems like a thankless, pointless, and dangerous (at least to your reptuation) job. I mean I guess the potential "free trip to Iceland" is nice but how much bullshit is that really worth putting yourself through?
---
Yep my point.      
---
It looks like he works hard and have a lot of knowledge already how to work on CSM.
---
"These idiots don't count cause they're idiots duh"
---
"no major wars" this is said with a straight face as more than  a quarter of nullsec marches off to war and almost another quarter of nullsec picks up their skirts and runs away to avoid the war.
---
Yes, but that is why they do it, they are testing the will power of the people who own the area.    One can argue that Simple Farmers make the area rather interesting, but mostly for people that are not aware of them.   I did not lose a single ship to them when I was in Catch, though they were after one of my BR's with multiple Sabre's so my Loki escort was not able to deal with it so I had to wait them out.
---
I was in about two campaigns to burn their stuff down, but I thought that there was not enough will power by the people involved.   It could have been very possible in my opinion as TIKLE and the rest of Legacy AU TZ could have done it, and when we did do it for too short a period they could only sit and watch and throw in smart bombing ceptors and slippery petes.
---
But my alliance was more focused on Provi and ended up working with HTP and PHEW, which is the main reason I got fed up and left.
---
Thank you kind sir

Wasn't there but seems like they lost the tactical fight while winning the IHUB timers.
---
well if you don't sov wand as well there's no reason to come home so...?
---
I've poked about it. It's not entirely dead, so I suspect it's a caching issue. Works on some connections, not others.
---
well NC. idiots don't count because they drop corp as they die so why not?
---
Star Conflict. Went from an enjoyable arcade space shooter with a sometimes rough but manageable grind to a pay2win, Jesus-feature, lootbox fest where an OP ship would be added every few months which was blatantly more powerful than everything else in the game, and could only be assembled with parts that came from lootboxes. It's been like that since 2015, but before that it was a lot of fun.
---
The devs had an elusive relationship with the players, but in late 2014 it turned to one of open contempt. They are well aware that they have fucked the game for a profit but their stances and methods have not changed in years. They've kept the lights on by taking advantage of the Russian playerbase who are willing to shell out on the lootboxes no matter how bad they're abused by the devs.
---
So you want to ban people based on them making trips to amarr? Why would a vni alt ever do shopping or logistics.
---
Besides having weak identifiers like that, many bots idle for random amount of time at citas or in the site, open the market or wallet to check their ticks, sometimes read their eve mails. It's not hard to fuzzy the exact place to click either
---
Yes it's almost like they don't have a community tea... wait.
---
You would think they can find one person to change the status of a video from "Unlisted" to "Public" on their YouTube channel when it airs on the Down Under stream. 
---
But maybe I'm asking too much.
---
\*gets rid of plex stockpiles\*
---
It was an example that was showing that human attentions/ focus is splitted 90% of the time. Only bot can focus on one thing for a long time.
---
Sort dragon blued up with goons and nobody was taking sov in fade
---
Can't target paint citadels though.
---
And yes, better bots can do random things but it’s always look “not humanish” if you look at long term stats. Anomalies in bot behavior is always present.
---
thats what they get for being lazy and not joining a random null block
---
Clearly we are talking about the Levi, the best looking titan.
---
Please let that dumb meme die. If anyone would drop corp or pull implants (from PL at least) they'd get as much ridicule from us as from you for being so stupid.
---
Steam has a 100% off sale on an Eve starter kit, it gives you 7 days of omega and a few bits to help get you started. Outside of finding 'starter' promotions, theres no real good or bad time as Eve is somewhat gated by time.
---
No I get it, losses don't matter if someone posts on reddit that they don't matter.
---
&gt; I would like to see a hard cap on Keepstars in a REGION
---
Fixed.
---
GOTG was spent before the big battles started last year. Their FCs and line members were burned the fuck out. That said I agree that GOTG could have been a major player this time around so Horde going after Sort was probably a pretty terrible idea.
---
If you're a renter you basically subject yourself to this bullshit and you lost the right to complain about it.
---
lmao no, this guy has the worst of the worst ideas - even if he somehow made it he would be laughed out of the room for every one of his terrible ideas.
---
So having more active and engaged members is now not something we should be proud of. We have more active and engaged members because goons treat goons properly. KarmaFleet is recruiting.
---
It's a nice trailer honestly, too bad the content looks a lot like Sansha incursion but of triglavian flavor. I hope the NPC behavior is different and is a mix between abyssal high tier and pirate EC.
---
Would they get as much ridicule as that guy who got pissed off at all the ridicule he got for losing a rorq and smoked an entire station worth of clones??
---
So you want to make already very easy to kill structures in hisec even easier to kill.    My medium structures in hisec are already too easy to kill as it is.
---
well they did join a null bloc, its just the shitty one.
---
Best part is a large part of rmt are nothing but nc alts
---
&gt;Sort dragon blued up with goons
---
Well yeah that will happen after horde takes a run at you and NC sits on the fence waiting to see who wins.
---
I've been dying since the 80s
---
That's because there have been almost no offensive fleets until today.
---
all renter space is shit due to next to no intel
---
zkill doesn't matter my dudes. It's all about what you believe
---
yep. which is why this post is comical.
---
&gt; I remember the exact moment after a Fanfest panel when someone took Fozzie's quote out of context about AT prizes (where he said something akin to "I literally don't know what they're going to be, we legit just went through all the races" and it was reported "NO AT PRIZE SHIPS THIS YEAR DAWG HURF BLUF") I think honestly he was just done at that point, which sucks because I loved to read his posting. He, along with Rise, were our Golden Bois.
---
I feel like this is disingenuous. Everyone was waiting on knowing if prizeships were going to be a thing and they were (as you said) hilariously late with any kind of announcement (for the AT in general and prizeships specifically). It looked like classic CCP "dont say anything and eventually it'll go away I hope".
---
Fanfest just happened to be right at that time and someone asked Fozzie at the round-table about prizeships and there was a real awkward "Uhh we dont know exactly, we cant confirm anything right now". With how half-assed everything was up to that point people put 2 and 2 together and it seemed pretty clear that at that time there was nothing planned. If anything was planned it would have been super easy to answer "theres prizeships for sure, we're just not sure on the exact ones" and a firm answer on that alone would probably have alleviated the concerns significantly. 
---
I mean yeah I guess its possible that there were prizeships all along and they forgot to announce it and Fozzie was just tired that day and mispoke but giving that much leniency to CCP in that context seems to be weird. I dont know why you'd present it as "poor fozzie and ccp got taken out of context", that just seems dishonest.
---
There is no such thing as an unbiased opinion. 
---
There is nothing inherently wrong with bias. 
---
Claiming something is not biased does not make it so.
---
whats is McDonald's doing?
---
Make them specifically only anchorable within range of Astrahuses and Fortizars. Give some benefit to the Citadel class (as opposed to Engineering/etc) besides just less fuel on the clone bay.
---
Also, one of the things about POSes was while you could surprise attack them outside the defender's timezone, the POS would still fire back. This wouldn't deter properly fit dreads, but it would stop a pair of AFK Talos/VNIs/Oracles from doing it. Citadels require an active gunner. I want surprise attacks and stront coasting back, but I think it's reasonable to expect the citadel to defend itself - with less dps unless it's actively manned.
---
I assume he references goons as the of the entities acquiring assets. Its funny that they are the ones out creating the content while others are just interested in farming the bots and enabling styles of play that really do kill content. 
---
Olmeca, maybe just maybe small groups could break into null without having to join larger entities this problem wouldn't occur in the first place and it might solve a range of issues? As for no content, there is plenty if they really wanted it, but they don't. You yourself are an example of that.
---
Makes sense.
---
Killing idiots in Rorquals and ratting supers in Delve isn't really much of an achievement tho. Especially when all their protection is away on deployment. - People go "whaling" in Delve every day, and losing these people who are out ratting during a deployment isn't exactly hurting the Goons. The reason we are hearing so much about it right now is because NC. is trying to cover their show of weakness by listing these kills.
---
Meanwhile Goons have essentially taken an entire region from NC. without a single shot fired.
---
I'm not aligned with either side, but one *achievement* seems somewhat more impressive than the other.
---
I don't think that is easy, especially because "not humanish" is a distinction that is very human. You would need a statistical model or something to recreate that finding - and then trust it blindly when you turn it on to ban all the suspects.
---
Or you could serve those people a captcha, like you may do on your website project.
---
Not to mention, they will sell faster too
---
WHY DID 500 TITANS LOSE TO 600 TITANS?
---
To the CCP dev responsible, THANK YOU
---
The problem is you grind the structures, it takes time and effort, but dropping extra 10 structures doesn't really. The small structures are so cheap, you can just mass spam them. As long as Simple farmers (or any other entities for that matter) want to continue harass a region, they can do it. You can do a campaign to burn them down and after a week they will anchor another 10-20 structures in different systems and different times.
---
Imho the defender is always at a disadvantage. Border regions like Catch and others that are gateways from high/low to null are more or less always doomed to have this. That's why people try to settle more in regions that are further away. Therefore I understand completely why some alliances may decide, ehh fuck it, we aren't going to participate in this neverending structure grind...
---
Hey look, it's the goon "narrative!"
---
Also, when are we getting a real executive producer again? Because since Seagull left it's been Hilmar and he doesn't have a clue about EVE.
---
Goons also caved because a bunch of alliances accepted very dirty casino money to invade.
---
Have insults bound to a macro
---
NC. move around anyway. so i presume its no big deal to them.
---
this is a pvp game, and one things factual. actual kills matter, actual kills is the content.
---
and goons have given more deaths to NC than NC has to goons, in my eyes thats NC winning. whats space? nothing.
---
and in reply to NC. 'covering thier weakness'
---
everytime i hear 'oh thats justa  goon pet, or renter.
---
what a bunch of poppycock, a goon is a goon, renter or pve lord or not, its a goon. and its a death on goon side. dont hide behind 'but thats not really us' :D
---
Well, we basicly mapped huge dataset to train our networks and then manually reviewing about a 1/3 of accounts marked as bots and I can say that this is pretty effective method. Sure, mistake happens, but it’s easier to handle mistakes than monitoring 100,000+ accounts. 
---
I think that CCP have enough data, it’s just not the thing that will make more money if they will ban all bots. 
---
I am strongly don’t like any botting and even don’t have a second account for 5 years playing but I must admit that less bots = less money for ccp
---
I don't get it. What am I looking at here? I see the Omega sign for the Omega clone option. And the ISK amount at 1.2 billion or so. Does it mean 500 PLEX cost 1.2 billion somewhere?
---
But that strategy will totally not affect them cause they loves shooting Citadels anyway so it dosn't matter for them!  
---
This is total UNDERSTANDABLE cause there are not 5 Post's a day about them crying about us not fighting.
---
Now we can send our enemies a link in local to show them how to undock\^\^
---
Super capital proliferation has brought safety to most nullsec empires, most alliances now operate a near permanent super umbrella in their ratting space. Nullsec will be very low risk for the time being, and unless ccp basically crushingly nerfs caps that isn’t gonna change.
---
It still kinda sucks. RMT corps didn't ask for this war. They're just collateral damage
---
How is that relevant to dropping corp? He didn't drop corp as he died.. :surprised\_pikachu:
---
I would recommend staying in there for littlebit longer, so you learn more tricks from those guys.
---
You can also make good isk in null sec with low skillpoints, by using Vexor navy issue.
---
After you get some isk and experience there, you can decide if you want to move on for smaller groups.
---
Excuse me, but it is not just structures, what do the structures actually do?   They are bases of operations.   When I was there I was wondering why we did not set up a task force of people ready and willing to go after their gate camps, bait them etc., in other words counter camp them and just do it, and all those structures would mean nothing.   I tried to suggest that to some people and it was like all focused on the structures.
---
It is so much easier to sit there and go meh structure spam when you could go after their reason to be there, their gate camps in a systematic campaign of counter harassment.   But it is so much easier to go structure spam...
---
gf. was a fun brawl
---
we can smash on the couch if you like ...
---
yes you are 100 right there and there is no shame on it. I mean it would have made more sence to bitch when they just basicly didn't do the exact the same 2 years ago and even explained on Firesides how effective this strategy is. Mittens himself was explaining this to add maximum Boredness to or grinding and camping ´Saranen...
---
Thank you I have around 78 mill isk I hope I can build a vexor with that.
---
I mean, even that Kotaku blog earlier admitted the only thing either side is going to lose in this will be some renter income.
---
I believe i can flyyyyyyyy!
---
I believe i can touch the skyyyyyyy!
---
uncle Ron?
---
What happened to your csm run? Rmt bite you in the ass?
---
Close. My current ratting build is around 90-100M. 
---
But i am also your enemy. :D
---
I am not biased but I think you're wrong.
---
So you have multiple people posting on reddit about how retarded your guys who are dying are but that's somehow different to one guy who got ribbed for losing a rorq?
---
im sure NC. didnt ask for this war either :D
---
so he is right?
---
Honestly, i miss Fcon, Bastion are doing a good job of picking up the slack but i just miss seeing the name attached to everything retarded that happens in Eve.
---
you and me both.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3XQcCyyPc
---
So i ask you a simple question since you are not aligned to any side.
---
Who had more fun the last days? 
---
The dudes whaling, killing Titans, Supers, Rorquals, Jumpfreighters, Freighters, Dreads, Carriers, etc etc.....Or the once who moved a whole week and basicly didnt fire a single shot with their bazillian titans.
---
Pls be honest.
---
what your looking at is a screen shot taken out of context then posted on reddit for sensationalism -
---
what this actually was, was a player run talk explaining his path from alpha to omega, then 1.2bil here is what he is OVER purchasing omega at this point
---
go to lowsec or NPC null
---
npcs don't attack pods? or did that change
---
i just violently threw up
---
so everyone is whining about plex prices when random alphas can plex and keep billions ?
---
&gt;next to no intel  
---
Every renter worth his RMT has intel bots
---
Anthem died in two weeks
---
Goons deploy north and NC deploy in reddit 
---
One is fighting in game other is fighting a propaganda war
---
I don’t believe the Triglavians meant to do that. These three ships suddenly appeared and that startled them.
---
one has kills. the other we are commenting on thier reddit post.
---
want to re read your statement after realising those facts?
---
&gt;The danger level hasnt changed at all
---
Implying forts aren't easier to defend than POSes
---
Ok. Make sure you are on discord - speak / type up on the relevant new bean discord channels and someone will help you out. Make sure you do some of the new bean training fleets which are frequently advertised in the relevant places. Look out for fleets and fleet pings on discord .  Seriously do not worry about not being an English speaker, but you might want to ask about some of the non English horde corps, there may be one that works in your native language. 
---
I am away this weekend but If after the weekend you still feel lost and you are EU time zone - then pm me your in game name and I will help you out. 
---
Eve is daunting, horde is big and busy, it’s easy to feel lost but we will get you having fun. 
---
(Pro tip - starting out in standing fleets you are always better off in something fast and cheap like a frigate, you will get to the fights quicker and you won’t care about loosing ships, you might lose 15 rifters in a row but on that 16th time when you are first on grid, and manage to tackle something juicy for the hard hitters to help kill. You will be seen as a hero)
---
what does this even mean
---
good
---
dosnt matter anyways cause since we dont fight anyways they didnt want that useless IHUB anyway! all went as planned long time ago.
---
if anything they actively say they are bad at the game.
---
it was made in 1 week
---
Right, but *"didn't wan't that region anyway"* is a solid argument? NC. may pretend to be some sort of nomadic group still, but we all know that hasn't been true for a long time.
---
Kills happen. That's just what EVE is. When it comes to large-scale wars, what matter isn't who loses the most ships or how much ISK is spent (especially when we are talking about uber wealthy groups like Goons and NC.) but rather infrastructure and territory losses.
---
By effectively evicting NC. from one of their more profitable regions of space, where they themselves removed huge parts of their infrastructure, Goons have hurt NC. far more than losing a few ratting Titans in delve has hurt Goons.
---
Easily the best fight I've had this war so far.  Caught reps in hull twice.  thanks for bringing the fight :P
---
It's almost like we spelled out that we'd be executing a Fabian strategy and have done exactly that since the C02 backstab, and all what we've predicted is coming to pass.
---
I'd vote for the NC. dudes responsible for taking down all those citadels. I bet they had tons of fun.
---
Thank you the main problem for me here is when these newb friendly fleets start at 14 (for my time zone) roughly when I'm in school.
---
Soooo indeed there's nothing?
---
There are a certain type that do. When they were in the Abyss, if you lose your ship or don't complete the site in time, you lose your pod as well.
---
&gt; I am not biased
---
Yes you are. 
---
&gt; but I think you’re wrong. 
---
I respect your opinion but do not share it.
---
How did you get ebola? The bruddahs, dey did not spit on you.
---
this. because content. something the remaining playerbase doesn't get and won't learn after the real content creators left years ago
---
its a game, kills are what matter, nothing else.
---
content for players, not money for the larger corps. the side having the most fun is the winning side, always in games. and grinding to take space or kill structures compared to whacka-moleing supers. i know which side id like to be on.
---
IF goons were made to move like NC did, Goons would die. people would leave, numbers would fall. NC have moved without much bother. at least in comparison to if goons where evicted. this tells me NC. retain thier nomadic trait and ability. whether or not they move as much as before or not.
---
Provibloc and the like moved out of Provi when panfam invaded. because there is always a bigger fish. goons are the biggest fish, takes strategy and tactical though to take on such a force.
---
If you haven't played much recently it could even be a protective band because you were hacked.
---
Or you used a different pc than usual / VPN or something.
---
In any case, submit a ticket and be patient. They sometimes take some time but from what I can tell get to things eventually.
---
Horde left fade before the last war, they are good at running
---
I am entirely unbias about why I have feelings about this statement.
---
Finally understand CCP plan. Players blueball each other so they make NPC fleets now that can kill ya. GG
---
everyone complains about plex prices always, its just most people are not willing to put in the effort to afford it claiming 'they have a life' 'dont want to grind all month' rather than working out efficient ways of doing it.
---
in summary, its easier to complain than to work for it annnnd this is reddit
---
shut up idiot, they're releasing incursions for the third time and this is the greatest year for eve online
---
Idk, that seems to be his job tbh.
---
Sort paid goons to leave him alone but screw his allies instead.
---
Stitch Kaneland or Insidious may get on, flying the solo flag. Big Suitonia sized shoes to fill though.
---
Matterall as result of TIS community might be in with a chance...
---
we weren't dumb enough to let the retards have roles.
---
Okay, so you died to an NPC, and your bitching about it on reddit why?
---
half of all null going to war, the other half in the middle of a war started weeks ago... how can you look at the whole map fighting and not see a major war?
---
Get those purples off your overview before I have an aneurysm.
---
It's no more an issue as if a player was stuck in there, It can be forcefully evicted from it's location via the medium of guns, Shoot it?
---
All your picture shows is a rat stuck in the station, it doesn't prove someone went out of their way to get it stuck there, that's  not proof of anything.
---
&gt;its a game, kills are what matter, nothing else.
---
That's where we disagree, my friend. For many of us this isn't just a came of shallow combat, but more of an empire-building thing. EVE is a lot more than just killing things.
---
Clever use of game mechanics.
---
fuck off
---
I don't really see how this is exploiting. Bubbles are a normal part of the game and a rat spawning in a structure is propably a bug, but it's hard to proof people cause that on purpose when they propably just want to bubbletrap the rats, which is a totally valid gamemechanic.
---
Excavator dogs are really going down in price!
---
So right... get the hype machine going... nerds gonna drool.
---
:/
---
You are too demanding bro. Ease up a little.
---
Not funny.
---
im not talking about bubbles. im talking about the stuck in station part.
---
I want to see where my nerds are and in small scale pvp it doesn't matter at all
---
Watching at work without sound - @ 1:53 min into the trailer that 180 turn from the jag/wolf? made me chuckle.
---
Oh sheeeeeeet kinda moment...
---
ahhh righto. cheers
---
&gt; NC and PL leadership and membership were not interested in playing the empire building game
---
That's such a bullshit argument, panfam holds 7 entire regions, 3 more than the imperium.
---
yeh i know its a part of the game. but for me. having fun counts more than the industry side of things in eve, guess thats why im not in goons. because i enjoy the fights. and dont really care much for the money or isk
---
much kinetic, very slow
---
there has yet to be a fight bigger than a cruiser skirmish. There is no war and nor will there be. Can you not see how you have no one left to fight?
---
The argument was about ridicule, not roles. Lets try to stay on topic
---
We had the exact same situation during the last war, they hard try reddit and dumb pve lost in delve the narrative was working around goons losing shit in delve while making no damage up north thanks to cyno jam party 
---
But at some point the cyno jam party had a weak point (their staging) and they had to defend it, and that's how x47 happen.
---
After that battle the narrative from goons losing shit went from cry from anti-goons people on reddit crying all around the place "eve is doom goons won the game CCPLEASS" 
---
This war seen already another turn their moveop only made people cry, I mean someone even post "goons are losing this war look at their fuel lost while they are losing rorq/super and meanwhile what NC lose ? Nothing ah" but we all know in a few weeks the "isk war" ncpl fight for will take another turn once goons will burn all structure the north have still online
---
And I'm not talking about the propaganda effect of this war bringing even more people to goons (who don't want to be in the winning side ) the damage done to renter  (their only income) and the cost of making their space ready for pve again (hello adm to raise while ccp recently nerf combat spawn) or all the structure to replace the Ihub etc.
---
What people don't get is goons are rich af they can go out on war and make their enemy lost a few bil in isk and then come back home in delve where everything will be here to do some turbo krabbing, meanwhile the enemy will have some issue to rebuild, look how it turns out for gotg (even before ncpl backstab them) I'm not saying ncpl will be in the same position since they won't suffer "heavy lost" (I guess important structure will be off the grid, they won't feed subcap fleets with no srp etc) but they won't be in the same state as goons once this war will be over
---
"People would be like: There he goes! Homeboy fcked a martian once."
---
There is an ep since last summer but they have never done a formal announcement
---
Somehow I feel more satisfied having an empty document than reading his ideas. What can I say
---
Always take care of your dogs ladies and gentlepodders!  
---
Ingame and out!
---
Sorry but this is most amazing things CCP did in years.       
---
Like finally NPC Pirate faction standings started to matter.      
---
I truly hope that CCP will expand those rats even more and put them in each anomaly across New Eden nullsec.
---
You're very much implying that's part of it in the first part of your paragraph lmao.
---
He actually bought time for his allies, who instead of using that time to bolster themselves, decided to attack Gotg and thus weaken their overall strength all at he same time losing Gotg as an ally.
---
At that point there was no need for Imperium forces to push in because the in fighting had severely reduced their fighting effectiveness.
---
Sort did the only thing left to him and actually secured 2 months of armistice to his allies yet his actions were taken as betrayal. How can it be so when all GOTG had was in ruins, they were broken, it was not betrayal it was surrender.
---
https://i.imgur.com/RjDyK9R.png there have been alot of that kind of manipulation the last weeks i have notice, this one is in dodixie, luckly someone had added most just that day when i needed one so i dident fall for it
---
If I´m not mistaken, Drifters also pod, and some certain Diamond NPCs
---
Goons: "Pretty Please Do SOMETHING for our Narrative!"
---
NC.:  "No"
---
Oh, i don't blame that. The fact that pirate faction can help or kill someone based on standings is great and i have no issues with that. The fact that NPC get stuck inside a station and stay there until DT and camp everything is bad gameplay doh.
---
Was not the question i asked for. We did not started pulling them on you move op.
---
Looks like clever use of mechanics.
---
This is an important point that people fail to acknowledge in that Citadels do not defend themselves and require a player.    So people can waltz up now at any time and put it into a timer with no defense possible.    So if the citadel can defend itself perhaps more people will put ships into space to defend their stuff.
---
I would do the same DPS, but of course the points would not be intelligent like the POS one.   In terms of fighters I would suggest that only a manned citadel can use them.
---
lol, look at all the goons with clever use of mechanics.
---
Sorry I forgot deploying sov structures was incredibly challenging.
---
Fix your damn standings.       
---
Tbh those factions should keep some ships always on the stations and attack any one with bad standings.
---
Then why respond? 
---
Everyone has some sort of bias and that’s  ok. 
---
It’s Friday. You English how you want my friend!
---
i simply explained the process. it might be a reason why diamond rats spawn inside the structure. The bubble part is not an exploit.
---
What's the point though, nobody will buy it - and soon market gets reseeded at a fair price.
---
Anyone care to share how this kinda manipulation leads to isk making in this scenario? I am no versed in the ways of market pvp.
---
Good way to deal with people playing stupid fucking station games.
---
But you can target paint the freighter carrying them.
---
Literally me when resettles to null-secs
---
I have to show my unbias in theme with the OP.
---
..thats actaully not what happened. the exact opposite happened.
---
If that's the case, don't stop believing whatever it is you keep telling yourself.  Glad you guys are not sticking to that Fabian strategy plan.
---
Well noted. I shall add you to my database of unbiased commentators.
---
How do you know that?
---
Triggered by the incorrect spelling/grammar of the title
---
yeah, and a guy with roles was ridiculed and it cost a station full of clones.
---
I appreciate your support. You are a good friend.
---
Do VPNs cause issues?
---
The best ship is the friend ship
---
triglavs do :D
---
Yes, come back - I got back 2 months ago after many years and I'm having a balst - 31 mil sp is plenty.
---
&gt;it might be a reason why diamond rats spawn inside the structure  
---
So the process of causing an exploit isn't exploiting or how am i supposed to understand this?
---
so I guess you aren't actually following the wars. There were multiple cap battles up to and including super caps dropped by panfam in the drone lands recently and test and Frat have been dropping titans on each other regularly.
---
(Free trip, which you mostly spend in a meeting room. the only 'Iceland' thing about it, really, is the physical location.)
---
We apparently 60 have been sold at that price so vOv
---
Will Keynote be available soon?
---
Free sp and some other stuff on steam
---
Goons could care less about the renters.  They just want to kick over Panfam's sandcastle.
---
Bought time for allies. 
---
Lmao
---
look at the market
---
CCP was asked in the AMA by Cagali what he they would do about the stagnation in null and lack of pvp in general. Hilmar takes the mic and gives a woke answer. Didnt expect it from him at all. Pretty much says:
---
- Removing region specific resources was a mistake
---
- Defending is too strong, sov needs a change to favour attacking
---
- Local is too strong 
---
- The game needs a shake up bad, and that he would rather they overdo it and shit hits the fan than to let it keep dying.
---
There are worse things people have said :-).
---
the only thing i saw here was 'who doesnt want to be on the winning side'
---
me. i dont want to be on the biggest fish side. thats cowardly and weak. and boring. no challenge.
---
goons are full of sheep for this reason. sheep with no skill or knowledge. it works because they have sheer numbers. but the general line member in goons is a fucking inadequate grunt.
---
where are all the dudes who want the fight, who want the brawl. like the days of mass joining phoebe republic just to be on the smaller entity side fighting an unwinnable war. just because its fucking fun and a challenge.
---
i have a feeling we are going to struggle to agree on things here, an presume what ive just said is going to piss off a few dudes. mostly the sub human monkey of goons :D (maybe im saying it to poke them cos its fun)
---
but all in all its a game. and i hope people join against goons, to fight the biggest dudes around for the GF's.
---
but i infact dont want goons dead, just fought. goons have incredible leadership level balance. theyre pretty well run from what i can tell. maybe slightly less well run than a few years back. but its still impressive.
---
My krab alts do exactly what you'd consider to be `bot behaviour`. I log them in, I kill the NPC, I log off.
---
r e m o v e l o c a l
---
&gt;The game needs a shake up bad, and that he would rather they overdo it and shit hits the fan than to let it keep dying.
---
yes please
---
Wow that's promising. I'd really like to know how he sees that being achieved.
---
Well, he is the ceo. He should order his minions to so exactly that.
---
They should have listened years ago to suggestions and warnings coming from people who actually PvP.
---
Local doesn't need a huge change (removing it entirely would maybe be too extreme), but delaying it is an interesting idea.
---
What did you just do?
---
Contrary to the doom and gloom, since the Pearl Abyss buy out, CCP is no longer under pressure to please profit hungry investors.
---
It is clear to anyone that bothers to open their eyes that CCP is thinking about the long term lifespan of EVE, just 2 recent examples: EVE 64-bit due soon and Eve Aether Wars Tech demo.
---
There is a lot of life left in this old beast.
---
Hello @ globby
---
what is this, is CCP the good guys now?
---
:jamal:
---
just get good standings with them
---
Oh but come on. They won before. Look. I thought they were super elite and the best yeah?
---
cool looking forward to never actually seeing this translate into in game changes
---
like i really appreciate what he has said, but if he believes that why hasn't there been changes, especially when he says he would rather overdo it as opposed to doing nothing.
---
ABOUT FUCKING TIME
---
It actually got me wondering about how much control he has or doesn't have about what happens in game. Maybe short term cash-out pressure was too high on him and he did what he knew was bad to get good numbers for the PA sale? dunno, but gets the noggin going. Either he doesnt really think its a problem and he ignores it, or hes dumb and doesnt see it as an issue, or he does know its bad but he needs the injector $$$
---
People will complain even if plex prices are 200m and if they are 20b
---
Fact is it has never been easier to plex, you can get an alpha into a battleship and do incursions for 20hours, plex
---
Or have a omega, skill extract it, do some pi and plex
---
Where do you see the volume per price range?
---
Everyone that lives in nullsec is a renter. Get off your high horse.
---
this makes we wanna vote for him
---
NC and PL haven't left the north in 3 years defending their rental empire. You are obviously playing the sov empire game but are now crying because goons look scary.
---
I knew this day would come :)
---
Yeah boyzzzz.... CCP is on it! I teared up a little....
---
Love the bit: "needs to be scary again...."
---
sory I misunderstood you.  
---
logistics ships have a special bonus for logistic drones :
---
T2 ship :20% bonus to Logistic Drone transfer amount / racial cruiser Lv  
---
T1 ship : 100% bonus to Logistic Drone transfer amount as role bonus
---
I think triglavian logi and fax also have some bonus about logistics drones
---
Our glorious Overlord has stated that He Shows no Intention of being in council.
---
Either He gets all the power handed or he will just take it. :)
---
In subcap era, we fight with battleships and cruisers, ncpl drop tons of carriers to shutdown the fight. Now it’s supercap era, goons brought titans, what other bigger stuff will ncpl drop to show it down?
---
&gt;Maybe short term cash-out pressure was too high on him and he did what he knew was bad to get good numbers for the PA sale?
---
he's been doing dumb stuff for a lot longer then they were trying to get bought out.
---
I would like to see sec status reflect loading time for local chat...like a -1 have a 1 second delay all the way to like a -10 with a 10 second delay or whatever good math. vOv
---
Flouncing
---
No, that's blatantly wrong. He bought 6 months for himself and 1 month for allies (1 month is something imperium would require anyway to move fronts / logistics etc). 
---
So effectively, he was buying himself out of the conflict.
---
If that Trig capital ship isn't actually as big as shown in the trailer then that's going to be disappointing.
---
https://dscan.info/v/3c4dc137fc36 
---
This happened.
---
Is shipping still more expensive than the item itself?
---
Did Imperium RF NC.s assets yet?
---
Not human for sure
---
https://imgur.com/a/icWz3bI
---
How's those renters in delve?
---
just get rid of it haha
---
lmao plexers
---
look like you cannot abuse the " safe" station in delve to deploy from there cause the rats might kill you?  
---
Fix your standings and this is not a issue...
---
They don't need to nerf caps. I have been arguing for a mobile cyno inhibition rework for over a year now. There are smarter ways to fix the umbrella.
---
I know i shouldn't. But there is this nagging little feeling i haven't had for a long time. Might this actually be... Hope?
---
Goons have been far more nomadic than NCdot ever was. It's also less than 3 years since goons lost every system they owned, which rather undermines your assertion that losing delve would kill them.
---
Best to fit a t1 version because it requires 1cpu instead of 30 something*
---
FC: Who let the dogs out?
---
In that case,
---
k e e p l o c a l
---
Cagali a damn sxc legend. This is what people should do, when they get the chance to speak to CCP, ask the right questions.
---
and when they did, it broke them? they have rebuilt. well done. mostly as its a game and most these big blocs have pretty much unlimited isk. but their numbers reduced heavily. was my point, nc. 
---
provibloc got kicked, lost huge numbers. but have rebuilt.
---
Nc. same thing here. but numbers? meh same same no huge number loss. all on the chin. actualy. lets fight back where we actually can. not the jaws of the beast but the squishy sides. best ive seen out of of the 3 of them
---
Triglavian titty implants
---
*YEP*
---
does anyone else understand wtf a "diamond" rat is? I just see normal rats. Not only could you fix your standings... but you know you can also target-shoot them as well... this is truly the most non problem I have ever heard of... Rats Station camping you....
---
Google eve university and get reading. It's probably gonna take hours or days. But it's all you need knowledgewise. All of the rest is practice
---
Well i lived for about 3months in renter space because.. Well.. I didnt knew better xD.. Intel isnt the worst part.. Its the "uh a neut lets dock up and wait till his gone"-mentality that drives you crazy x)
---
NC withdrew to Tribute allowing Imperium to single out GOTG if we redeployed to northern Pure Blind. I don't see what other option Sort had except let his space burn.
---
Yes but he did buy 2 months for the allies. (thus not being blatantly wrong)
---
Look i dont really care about Sort and Gotg in fact i kinda want em dead especially after he took sides with possible boters against his more pvp oriented Slyce? corp. 
---
But still at that time the thought had cross his mid to bargain for his, then allies. Yeah it was a small time 2 months but still it was something, and he probably payed a lot for that time as we all remember.
---
I dont think the enemy was as exhausted as you claim (source i was there:P). But yes the 2 months would have probably been required to change fronts.
---
I like the part where any form of action even a single nanoangstrom away from "complete multi-generational enmity" with "goons" constitutes ironclad blue standings and abject betrayal. Like, seriously.
---
words
---
I thought that made a lot of sense and it’s good that it comes from this bigh up in the organisation.
---
We should not have blue donuts where everybody is nice to each other just to keep the good stuff coming.
---
I was watching Judge Sarn’s stream early this morning and he went right down to Delve and, smack dab in Goonland he dropped a drag bubble, caught himself some goons and claimed 3 kills before he was taken out in a 2v1 fight. He was not at all intimidated to engage.
---
That’s EVE. You don’t play it safe, you go find yourself some trouble and kick as much ass as you can along the way.
---
That’s the fun part. Doesn’t need 5000 pilots to make waves. One guy determined to have fun is enough to engage real content.
---
Lol I didn't expect them to release candidates today
---
Wtf I love CCP now?!
---
i missed a gudfight... i hate work...
---
That's what I said. The Casino War. 
---
What are you? Retarded?
---
The best time to get into eve is: NOW
---
Come lose spaceships with us and discover the best ship in eve.
---
&gt; get good numbers for the PA sale
---
I think you've hit the proverbial nail on the proverbial head here.  This game has been going downhill (in gameplay terms) since injectors and actually I would go further back and say since PLEX.
---
One month.
---
So far, all indications I've seen are that it's a massive beast. It looks to dwarf existing titans like existing titans dwarf everything else
---
Create a free account. Do the tutorials.
---
I first gave Eve a go around 2008. Been on &amp; off for 10 years with many lengthy breaks, but I keep getting drawn back in. I feel like I've still barely experienced all the game has to offer.
---
My issues have been joining extremely active corps which overwhelmed me. Now I'm in a fairly casual corp with few demands on my time I can come and go as I please. I'm playing more than ever now.
---
inb4 the seraphim invade
---
Was that a fkn Trig Titan?
---
For a returning player that has been out of the loop, listening to that AMA gave a lot of promise for where EVE is heading. CCP is listening.
---
Honestly, player base original worries of Pearl Abyss buyout, are not accurate. It seems as though CCP now finally has the time to focus on the gameplay and its development rather than shareholder bottom line.
---
I also predict that once Korean localisation comes in we may be in for a fun influx of MMO obsessed new blood.
---
Exactly.
---
so you want no local delay for carebears, just for the hunters who are hunting you? lmao. fuck off idiot.
---
He hinted a bit at "local" - so I'd say they have some ideas about reworking that somehow.
---
It's not beyond stupid, they've got the official one premiering on youTube in 4 hours or so.
---
This is just the sneak peak before the trailer is launched.
---
With ya on this one - delay is an easy potential fix that could be tried out. Having just entered a wormhole for the first time the other day I agree that wormholes should kept the 'no local' feature - there is something inherently cool/mysterious about it.
---
Remove local then watch 80 - 90% of the games population unsubscribe overnight.
---
Sometimes stagnation is better than the death of your product.
---
what if you could hack a special site (undefended, must be guarded by players) in the "core" of a constellation that would down local for the whole constellation for some time, thus disabling bots in that constellation?
---
what does he say at -14 seconds?
---
He does not like kicking what?
---
I would have to know more before I either hate on/love on these ships. The pictures look ok I guess. Do the salvagers ramp up their salvage? Does the Freighter Ramp up its storage bay the more it .... freights?
---
Congratulations, it's retarded.
---
just find a Low class WH fot start and learn the ropes (my advise is C3/LS vanilla).  
---
the 0.0 static is cool for pvp and eventualy relic sites but not for Krab. ISKs are inside the WH my friend. 
---
about mining, when you will try gas huffing, you will never go back to rocks  
---
But yes, scanning is a daily duty.

Retard on reddit- "omg I'm glad you guys ditched that Fabian strategy"
---
what skins are they?
---
Get excited when you see plans, not promises, folks.
---
I wouldn’t worry too much if you can’t make them. Most cover flight basics and you will pick them learnings up in fleet anyhow. They just give you a kickstart so your first few ops aren’t too stressful. 
---
Make sure you reach out on discord to one of the NBI lot and they will give you some help and your introductory care package if you haven’t already had it. My offer to help out next week still stands, I’ll sort out some throwaway ships for you then as well, it’s a lot easier to learn when you don’t care about losing ships.
---
The trailer on the EVE Youtube channel is set to air today at 4pm
---
They're not actual concepts for ships coming. CCP Antiquarian was explaining that when they start on a new ship design line they like to poke at all the different types of ships possible in it to help flesh out the visual design.
---
let the krabs go, the pvpers will stay and then more will come. The game will be better off haha
---
PA buyout means they can chill, not worry about bottom line &amp; focus on the what we all wish for.
---
Watch this space...
---
ye of little faith....!
---
Believe!
---
not a great look here
---
d e l a y l o c a l
---
you'd prob still play again
---
The similarity to Incursions is just formal from what I have deduced. There will be abyssal weather effects in invaded systems, definitely more EWAR, enemy remote reps (Rodiva logis confirmed as enemies). It will also probably be randomized like abyss waves are. So far it seems far superior to Incursions.
---
god that's sexy
---
Looking forward to seeing concrete changes to address these problems in the next update.
---
It's ccp Jin. Getting exited when you see plans is like getting exited when you see promises.
---
Get exited when you see it on sisi, and even that can be a long shot
---
The Korean localisation might bring some 500 players max, I can't see it being big in Korea
---
Words are free.
---
ah so it was just for visual fun. Although I still would like to know what in their head they were thinking of when designing them to what they would do and make them different.
---
Stop talking shite and pulling random figures out of your ass.
---
CCP devs unwittingly implaying that wormhole space provides the most interesting content with it's lack of local, no sov and general scary-ness
---
Thats hot, thats hot

they are showing it today in fact. They just use the premiere tool from youtube which releases a video automatically at a specific time. today at 4pm

You should watch the AMA segment from EVE Down Under today. It'll be on Twitch. You might be surprised by how comfortably Hilmar talks about complex gameplay and technical aspects of EVE.
---
Too many pronouns amigo. Who is “they” in this context?
---
Don't be a bitch, just means you will have to have actual people at the gates watching, called scouts for maximum krab safety, also would make it where you can't mine as AFK as you can rn.
---
Stront kak en schijt
---
I actually just love looking at those. So sleek. And so well drawn, despite them literally just be doodles. Might just be jealousy
---
as much as i like to hear this..
---
but sadly alot of promises made by ccp on fanfests never really make it into the game and are just shallow words.. so yeah.
---
id love to be proven wrong tho
---
Yeah I was embarrassed to be on comms at this point.
---
this clip going in my bio
---
Stitch is like the anti-Dunk Dinkle and hopefully has a decent chance to win
---
I know you’re mad but no need to resort to name calling.  It’s only a game bud.  It wasn’t even that bad of a loss.
---
&gt; but if he believes that why hasn't there been changes, especially when he says he would rather overdo it as opposed to doing nothing
---
this..  i fear its just shallow words again by ccp as usual on fanfests...
---
Mad about what exactly?
---
I have a main in a casual PvP corp so I don't have regular login demands to weigh me down.
---
My alt does some station trading, but with exploring I can make a billion in a 5-6 hour jolly to null sec. I go through wormholes to get to null to avoid gate camps.
---
If that's not enough Isk you may need a big corp for some nice, profitable, safe blue space.
---
It took me 10 years to find the balance that suits me.
---
EVE Nova fights on the citadels can take out the shield generators or sabotage the armor hardeners. Win fights in EVE Nova on enemy iHubs to drop ADMs faster. There are a million things CCP could do, problem is they're not doing anything at all.
---
regarding its size i would call it a super-titan \^\^ but yes it is
---
Whatever it is that’s got you mad enough to call me retard.  Unless you’re just normally an a-hole.  In which case carry on being one.
---
"Your reputation" in this case means "your spaceship reputation." With how many other CSMs do you know who they are and what they do? Brisc himself brought in the tie to his RL persona, and even ran on it. Sure, he couldn't expect the shitshow to follow, but for most people I'm not sure it could get to that point.
---
You're sure right though. It's clearly a lot of trouble to contribute to the CSM just to be ignored.
---
Yes please! Like it would make so much sense if people wanted to turbokrab their system they have to lower their defences. Make also the jumpgate/cyno beacon and jammer also count so that you cant anchor it on a keepstar grid.
---
CCP we really need this, please.
---
Looked pretty good. Lots of deaths both sides and sorta equal numbers?
---
Oh. 
---
See retarded things. Call them retarded.
---
Unpopular opinion: all of the titan models in this game look dumb
---
Pull dogs in, pull dogs in, no links, align, align, pull dogs in.

Duuuuuuuuuuude I love Hilmar now?

LOL GRRRRRR NC how dare you not whelp your 200 titans vs our 1100+

Opinion's are like assholes everyone's got one.  Please remove the stick from yours.

I liked his ideas shared earlier on reddit about the diminishing returns across systems and regions the more they're farmed.
---
if a botter use the same vps sure
---
If I catch Antiquarian (and remember) tomorrow i'll ask him.
---
I'd thoroughly recommend Antiquarians talk, he's a funny guy and showed off a lot of these kinds of concept art. The thorax ones, he said they're not in the pipeline, just messing around but... want nao plz.
---
What stick? Is something bothering you because someone called you retarded for your post?
---
"energy transport vessel" whats this?
---
I have 2 accounts with a single character each.
---
Account 1 is PvE for making Isk
---
Account 2 is PvP for losing Isk
---
Both are Omega, but I guess an Isk making Alpha can work.
---
The FCs were exhausted. You have to remember the war was still in outlying regions. Farming more populated areas would have been 10x more cancerous for Goons at that time.
---
See people who seem to have a stick up their butt, call them out for it.
---
You aren't wrong, but why is that?
---
Looking forward to a possible followup to this :P
---
Where is this blue doughnut? In the last 3 months I've been on fleets as the aggressor to literally all parts of New Eden (including J-space) except obviously Imperium space.
---
My first thought was "Is dis a Station players can use one day?" and after the engine was heatin up i was like "OH LAWD HE COMIN. I need this thing in my life"
---
Delay tied to gate cloak. 60 seconds max to look around. Simple, straightforward.
---
I don't see how you getting called retarded makes me anal retentive. Take a deep breath. You're seeming offended.

As a formerly good show once said “Words are wind”.

my mind instantly went to a ship specifically designed for cap transfer.... but it could also just be code for exotic male dancers hauler.

He still is pretty much in control of whatever he wants to do, the problem is he is out of touch, doesn't give a shit and would rather play with his fancy new tech than invest time in eve.
---
Ant hills.
---
I wonder what good you think delayed local would actually do?  Because as far as I can see it you'll have fewer targets to shoot, so in total the number of targets won't change will it.  It'll just be the usual dummies who you can already catch because... well, they're dummies.

This is more accurate than that Nado that keeps sniping my Large Skill Injector tanked shuttle.

This is why I can’t afford to PvP. The modules are just too expensive.

Great kills as always Tommy. I have a personal weakness for Garmur killmails and upship kills. At least people know GOTG are angry and cancer. I don't know how Brave gets the reputation it does
---
Can vital core gas sites be Jedi huffed?
---
How do you benefit compared to having 2 characters on one account and MCT?
---
People have suggested that before, but I think 60s max is insane. I hunt a lot and just 5-10s would make a massive, massive difference.
---
Also, that suggestion would make certain systems more valuable as ratting systems than others, if the gates are far away from where the majority of anomalies would spawn. I think a flat 5-10s delay that only triggers on jump-in through gates (so it doesn't buff login traps) is far more interesting.
---
thank you.
---
I didn't call you anal retentive, but hey whatever floats your boat.  You're the one calling people retards for not agreeing with your world view.  Like I said if that's normal thing for you, then like I said, more power to you.
---
My drones are barking!
---
It's only 60s if you wait out the cloak. Dscanning can suuuuck so the extra time is welcome and not really a negative. Variable time makes more sense  with upside and tradeoff.
---
They listened to the bigger voice. The whole of nullsec that wanted safety and control. They even elected most of the CSM to carry their concerns up the chain.
---
Same IP or same provider?
---
I'm glad to see there are no less than 3 posts on it.  Clearly eve is dying.
---
its their invasion beachhead, i am very excited how this all will work
---
No. He's wanting carebears to see neuts in local 5 seconds before they hit system. Duh.
---
Not at all. I called you a retard for being retarded. I felt that was obvious when I told you this.
---
So maybe a new captial type?
---
Nothing of value would be lost.
---
Get excited when you see it on TQ
---
Who runs those eve mogul citadels... it would be a shame if something happens to them
---
Oh look another whine post about my station bubbling.
---
**SPOILER ALERT:** It's already been debunked that the bubbles don't cause this. The spergy undocking and redocking of your Horde group is causing re-aggression and de-aggression resulting in numerous warp in / warp outs of the rats. Stop complaining about my bubbles, they aren't the issue. It's you.
---
Nah, no Theta FCs yelling at people to stop jumping.
---
This kind of bad feeling of not getting anywhere and having no objective happened to me lots of times.
---
All you need to get out of it is to undock and do stuff. I know it sounds stupid but eve is a game, and if you stay docked you're not playing it. 
---
Personnal advice from what you say ? Find a nice wormhole corp in your TZ. Doesn't need to be huge at all, and you'll get small gang pvp everey day, lots of easy isk and wormhole life is just... &lt;3

you can see amount traded per day, assuming that the price was manipulated the whole day, and it shows 60 pcs ...

Start of the week Heavy Warp Scrambler II  (usually around 150 Mio.) were cleared of all empire markets. I caught the last 2 for some 220 Mio. Someone than put them to the market in Jita in 1-unit-orders for 350 Mio ISK. Had to buy 3 because I needed my 30 points.
---
Hammy is such a feeder.
---
All the multibox miners would cream their jeans.... "i can ramp up mining to higher than a Rorq?!?!?!"
---
He's right. If people wanted no local, they'd go to wormholes as that mechanic is already in the game. And wormholes aren't exactly overflowing with the demand for it. 
---
Literally the only time I see people saying they want no local in null, they are usually wormholers. 
---
I know a lot of people were not logging in or undocking when local was having its worst issues.  The game might not lose that many, but that change would come with about 20% of the population unsubscribing.
---
except volume per day is for sell orders and buy orders …
---
Shit, is the botting problem really that bad?
---
lmao
---
"at that price" ??
---
It just needs to ramp up in cap-usage and crystal damage as well.
---
Well, NCPL do things for more and more people blue Goons. Harvesting what you sow...

You guys are making good progress. Keep it up.

you'd not be able to login both at once using just one account, i'm guessing the pve char is on a separate account so it can do (semi-)afk pve while the main is doing more interesting stuff

There are renters in Tribute?!?!  I thought that was the elite space of the EvE gods as they cast each other down!  Whoever holds Tribute holds EvE as history has taught us.

It's like they say: the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago; the second best time is today.

I was around both times when Plave created and recreated RVB. Joined on an alt a couple of years ago but wasn't happy with what I saw, it was VERY far away from the initial ideas. No idea how it is these days, might give it a try again.
---
Ok.  Let me ask you what exactly makes my original statement retarded?  The whole point was bore Goons into leaving, how does taking a fight and feeding, align with boring goons into leaving?
---
Hahahahahaha you said Slyce and PvP.
---
Hey you take that back, we're not that degenerate
---
post lossmail so I can print it out on magnetic vinyl, gold foil it and stick it to my fridge.
---

---
Yeah dropping vis of local in null isn't a bad idea honestly. I'd support that and null cloaky bastard pvanythingIcanshoot is all I do. So nerfing local would be to my detriment but I'd still like it.
---
OP, Antiquarian made a _lot_ of emphasis to say these are not in any pipeline, and there's no current intention to release ships based on these _ever_.
---
Good job ignoring that with your contactless post.
---
I can get on this bandwagon tbh. If they nuked local in null totally then I'd probably just unsub totally, but I could work with this.
---
Why is removing it too extreme? You can totally still find people quickly if you're hunting.
---
I can already see the Capchains in Delve-Miningbelts
---
You are right Rvb isn't the hsec 50ppl fights anymore. Now we try to have fleets everyday everywhere. We also moved to Black rise HS
---
The whole conjecture that you're retarded bubbled from the assumption that the rubber helmet fits comfortably on thine head. Then it was compounded by your offense taken by the comment. Further building up your capacity of retardation to the point of downs. 
---
In layman's terms
---
LOLfagbbq
---
When I was in that position I was saved by finding the right corp. You need an element of luck, but try to match your interests and timezone to an active group and you have a decent chance. Have a look in evejobs, talk to people in their public channels and be patient. There are some great groups out there.
---
Everything burning would actually be in their interest since folk would pay to replace shit. Limited PvP means limited replacements means a stale economy.
---
saying != doing          
---
Sorry but i will not be "happy" until something is actually done.      
---
Over the years CCP teach me to cautiously approach what is being said or promised.         
---
Way to many things did not get into game or were left in half developed state.               
---
Some changes introduced huge issues that no one cared to look at.
---
Maybe he was listening to 70's porn music with the sound down on the stream.
---
And your evidence is?
---
Oh wait, you just made that up. 
---
Never mind.
---
Plans? How many plans that were never fully introduced we see over the years?
---
&gt; Eve is the only competitor in its niche. 
---
I hope Dual Universe changes that or at least pushes CCP to step up their game.

this just this

we may be large but we have sigs and squads who do small gang stuff all the time, Predds are a good example of what some of the best small - medium gang content in the game currently.

Idk how the fuck you can say we're the ones with reading comprehension issues. I'm not the one who made a boo-hoo I quit the game because I didn't get my free shit because I couldn't understand the WRITTEN FUCKING RULES.
---
Fuck off kid, the masses have spoken. You've got some major maturing to do if you are so angry that you feel literally cheated out of free shit because you couldn't click a button once a day. 
---
The truth is, you're not mad about the mass reply, you're mad that CCP isn't catering to your childish bullshit. You're mad that everyone who comprehended the rules got a bunch of shit you'll never get and all they had to do was click a fucking button. You're mad that no one agrees with you outside of the handful of other REEEEEtards saying the same thing. 
---
Quit the fucking game pussy, no one cares.
---
God damn, you're like those bitchy stay-at-home moms who go to the grocery store with expired coupons, only to be told they're expired, throw a giant fit to the manager, and then go home to complain to their friends on Facebook and boycott the store because they felt CHEATED.

Please remember, Hilmar has always been one to talk a lot and deliver none of it before you get all excited.
---
Shame that combat and ship piloting is never like that.
---
Ex Tribal Band pilot. TEST deserve honorable mention. But only goons can achieve the cancer I truly crave.
---
Small scale pvp is fairly simple, train yourself a tackler alt or something, and head out to nullsec in a cruiser and blow up some dudes! For PvE, incursions maybe? Or mix both of those and get yourself a C3 - Nullsec wormhole, live out of an astrahus and make money by running sites in there :) all decent options.
---
Get excited when complete feature is on TQ not a half messed stuff that breaks a lot of things and no one want to look at them for next 4 years.
---
420 carriers ayyyy blazeitbro
---
need to paint all that structures
---
Reminds of those Ubisoft trailer, I mean that cringy fake "co-op" voice acting
---
That would be a nice proposal if CCO start recruiting very dumb people who are awarded for silly proposals.
---
A limit on structures on each system is needed, be it moons, planets, a fix number tied to sec status, I don't know what the best way to determine the limit would be, but one is needed.
---
Division 1/2?
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Is it really necessary for Goons to paint a freighter to not miss it? Asking for a friend ..
---
NO! Make it so that a single citadel can fulfill all functions.                
---
Sorry but you need now athanor per moon you want to mine, T2 Rigged Tatara, separate Engineering complex for most of the production you want to do (unless you spend like hundreds of billions for 2 sotiyos with rigs).        
---
Basically you need to drop dozens of structures in system to create viable place for a medium sized corporation.             
---
Goal should be that you need 1 ... ONE citadel to do it and not 20.      
---
So 3 timers not 60 ... and so on.
---
Good on Buccaneers that they survivied.
---
I'm still kinda confused about the whole OPSEC/Hateful idea of "we didn't know it was an eviction but brought rollers and HC ships". Normally that would go as eviction assets, like noone anchors a pos+rait, makes a timezone base HC plan etc for anything but evictions. Like i get everybody wants to save face here but lets just be real here.
---
Because missiles get worse the bigger they are?
---
Visualky really cool aside
---
My first reaction of watching this trailer is "Woah this triple-boxing guy talks to himself"
---
No, that's actually the reason why this game is dead atm, to the extent even Hilmar sees it.
---
And for NS, make TCUs important, by placing moduels in them like ihabs, but for the amount of numbers of Citas you can place. So if you have ADM 1 you can only place medium citas with base number 1.5, at ADM 2 large citas with base number 0.67, and with ADM 4 xl-citas with base number 0.45.
---
That would mean with ADM 1 only 1 medium cita could be placed.    
---
At ADM 1,5 you can place a second medium cita.  
---
With ADM 2 you can place 3 medium citas and 1 large citas.   
---
On ADM 3 you can place 4 medium citas and 2 large citas.  
---
At ADM 4,5 you are able to place 6 medium citas and 3 large citas, and for ADM 4 (like capital system) you can place your first xl-cita, and with ADM 5 your second, ADM6 brings nothing for xl-citas.
---
It's almost like poses were better in every way.
---
nope, the game does not need such a limit, it's perfectly fine without it.
---
you can remove the citadels from your overview if that is what annoys YOU. No need to fuck everybody game just because you are pissed of having to update your overview.
---
Again i disagree.       
---
First thing CCP need to solve is to combine Citadel , EC and Refinery into one structure.           
---
So people don't need to drop 20 structures per system in order to utilize the area.       
---
**Sorry but if i am contesting area i want to have 7 structures in constellation to take care of and not 140 ....**      
---
Splitting structure functions **was a HUGE mistake**
---
Confirmed The Mittani is Cthulhu and Delve is R'lyeh

What for, exactly ?
---
As you say it, it's extremely stupid.
---
Wait goons deployed 1300 titans?
---
Almost bought one
---
I was like "hold up what the heck why this Hyena costs 1.2b"
---
Thx pop-up
---
Energy vampire dogs need to get buffed.
---
I kinda see your point. Doubt CCP will remove structures though, having some kind of restriction on how many you can have is probably more realistic
---
Whatever your dumb ignorant opinion of the war is, goons have more fun in this damn game than anybody else. I've loved every single fleet I've been on with these fucking clowns.
---
More were deployed.
---
If local is delayed (let's say by 10 seconds), it means that a hunter has time to dscan, find a target and warp to it before the ratter notices he's in system. It makes ratting less safe. If the delay is longer (let's say 1 min), a fast warping ship could potentially get in system and kill a ratter before any intel channel get informed about the hunter's presence.
---
What I really don’t understand is why haven’t people started lighting fires in Delve? 
---
Almost their entire umbrella is deployed, NPC Delve exists and it neighbours LS.
---
except 75% of people are in hs, so good luck being last one when the servers shutdown
---
Quality post. Thanks.
---
the diamond rat NPCs are by far one of the most entertaining things CCP has done with EVE Online, finally some sort of risk vs. the safety of 0.0 stations
---
Now you have to explain me how you can hear people chatting with radio comms while submerged in a fluid.
---
You don't understand the structure spam problem
---
Remove low sec then theirs a clear split pve n pvp side of space
---
maybe because there is no such a structure spam problem ?
---
Are you suggesting Goons are essentially renters of Panfam?
---
Possibly, this is just one op.
---
Hilmar does NOT  play the game,he has no clue what he is talking about...remember when you try to explain what EVE is to someone who never played it :D
---
Cause you WIdotted entire coalitions into one alliance.
---
the worst was the E3 gameplay of GR: Wildlands. That was cringy as fuck
---
OF COURSE THE CANCER SHIP GARMUR SURVIVES
---
It's scheduled to go live at 1400 EVE time, according to YouTube.
---
what
---
RIP Eve...
---
A factor is development takes a lot of time, especially working with a legacy codebase like they have (speaking from experience). The time it takes to QA any major changes (like, say, the recent changes to wardec mechanics) is probably on the order of a months because a simple change can have a rippling effect.
---
Let's assume they wanted to implement a change they mentioned and start working on it now, the earliest possible release date is probably a year from now, with maybe a partial release 6 months in. And that's an optimistic estimate, it could easily take them longer (especially since they're developing multiple features concurrently).
---
I would really appreciate it, thank you!
---
He didn't though, goons would have needed that time anyways
---
It was just a way to make it look like he didn't betray his allies
---
Wtf I love Hilmar now
---
No, that's the home defense fleet
---
FOB rats pod as well
---
Classic Shadoo is the best.
---
Excellent idea. They delay would be proportional to the trusec of the system.
---
PL deployed their supers exactly once and ran back because imperium started pushing in the north. NC supers haven't left the north at all since the casino war.
---
Is that a recent battle?
---
I liked the idea of local being a structure that you can deploy and destroy. So an invading fleet might send a few ships before the main fleet arrives and destroy local chat. A group could harass and periodically destroy local to mess with ennemies.
---
Yes! Get rid of local!
---
What did i just do ?
---
So...... which is which?
---
Not really.
---
If you enter a system and see neuts in local you know there are targets.
---
If you enter a system without local and you hit your dscan and there are anoms/citadels out of dscan range you still dont know if there are people in system, so you have to start warping around to cover all of the system to dscan it.
---
Possible yes, but i would prefer a delayed local wich just tells me if its worth it to spend my time in this system.
---
Perky tiddies = good tiddies.
---
So, EVE going downhill from launch?
---
As soon as you make any movement commands you should pop up in local. that gives hunters up to 60s to dscan and or select a site to warp to. and it wouldnt be OP to the point that people are on grid before they enter local.
---
I can play two toons at the same time in HS. Just considering the reward in ISK, not the loot, not the LP, I made exactly +274M isk over 152 min for the first, and +180M isk over 155 min for the second. Average that means 88M isk/h/account, considering some of the missions I did were for the loot not the raw isk it should be better.
---
I did over a bit 500M worth of loot in those total 5 hours, but as I said I don't consider the loot.I also did a bunch of LP but as I said I don't consider the LPs, just the raw isks.
---
Playing in null I did 60M/h in a VNI, 80M/h if I also had a very efficient salvage and loot along this. 
---
sorry byt Unless you play with a super you don't make more money per account in null. And that's assuming you only use one cyno alt, no fax alt.
---
Just play for free for a bit to see if you like it. It's still a good time to join.
---
Asset safety in lowsec and highsec, timed local to security index.
---
Fly to the centre or any sites spamming dscan. Drop combat probes and scan immediately to give you a general idea of any ships around. Go to town.
---
No it wasn't. Why not follow that train and start combining ship functions too?
---
Eve is about specialisation and structures shouldn't be any different
---
Seriously though, you know that isn't even remotely accurate to what we actually had for the KQK onlining, right?
---
Especially when they're spoken from the ass. (Not that Hilmar is talkin' out his ass, of course.)
---
But I wouldn't even be hyped on seeing plans, Jin. We've seen plans for... well, a lot of things that simply never happened.
---
Where does the astra go then? Anywhere?
---
I mean, if they finish that "Faction Warfare" idea they had once, I'll agree with you but until they get around to that I wouldn't get excited by things hitting TQ either.
---
null pve and hisec pvp .... the other way would just be silly
---
Good to see CCP/CSM coming to see the game's problems as we have been arguing for past 3 years now.
---
In the end it doesn't matter. Nobody is gonna fight em anyway (or can for that matter).
---
And NCPL fucked it up with every one who could save them now. 
---
You didnt want to play the Empire builder game, so fall like a barbaric gang. Just, stop crying because of your own actions and choises.
---
Good point i forgot the small citadel...it could go in planets or moons.
---
I'm not a fan, they'll just end up making them like Jump Gates. I remember CCP saying you could disable those, but they have a shitton of EHP and no one gives a fuck if you shoot them.
---
Tying things to structures has "CCP will fuck it up" written all over it.
---
Part of me seems like that is a oversight it would be nice to have more options for expensive fits that were really risky but powerful. I am fairly new but it seems like the big alliances need a way to lose more isk. They are to big and wealthy. Would be great to see fleets forced into having to run really spendy doctrines vs each other.
---
&gt;no one wanted to forward deploy another keepstar and go balls deep, well except init probably.
---
This is accurate.
---
INIT. had no interest in that peace treaty.  Probably won't have much interest in the next one either.  We'll see but INIT. is a PvP alliance and we need some real wars now and again to keep things interesting.
---
So why aren't you fighting instead of seal clubbing?
---
Words are wind
---
If you were immortal and got to sculpt your body, would you do this?
---
I'm down in period basis. It's 1 bil per month. You get access to entire region.
---
They have; the local fire department has been doing fine so far.
---
It's not about getting excited. It's about seeing the CEO of a company having an interesting mindset. Not many people in his position would say "I rather upset my customers than don't do anything at all".  
---
Hillmar getting involved with the actual development of EVE again seems to be a good thing, at least longterm wise. But as usual, the ideas and directions CCP takes are awesome. The ways the finalize them are often hardly close to their own dreams.
---
&gt; me. i dont want to be on the biggest fish side. thats cowardly and weak. and boring. no challenge.
---
Literally seal clubbing the dumbs in delve rn.
---
&gt; where are all the dudes who want the fight, who want the brawl. like the days of mass joining phoebe republic just to be on the smaller entity side fighting an unwinnable war. just because its fucking fun and a challenge.
---
Aren't you it? running away from the fight...
---
“Unless you want to get onto reddit’s front page”
---
Ok, who’s going to make the post?
---
Hmmm That's not bad
---
Who?
---
Grr goons etc etc but this game can be bloody beautiful
---
Cannot access the scan from my current location.
---
Get excited when complete feature has been on TQ for half a year and hasn't totally destabilized the game, or been nerfed to hell, or both.
---
Why the hell do we still think that bad voice quality is still part of every radio communication in a world, where we can transfer a complete human mind in a seconds all over a vast network of stargates several thousand lightyears apart?  
---
This bothers me.
---
well that is the impression i had of them.
---
Seriously, this has been pointed and explained a thousand times, if you are too lazy to look it up and too stupid to understand the reasons on your own, I won't waste my time explaining it to you.
---
no, it has not been.
---
People just complain they don't like something as if it was a general problem of the game
---
IT IS NOT.
---
We are the brave elite pvp alliance NC. Instead of doing anything at all, like harassing move ops or stragglers, we are all going to dock in low-sec until Goons go away. Why? Well, you see... this is what an elite pvp alliance does when they are outnumbered. 
---
We do not look for opportunities to fight where the odds are closer to even and we do not look for opportunities to resist in any way. We hide, and then post on reddit about how us hiding is us really sticking it to the goons.
---
"large part" is prob not true, but several corps and members of panfam does indeed rent moons and /or system.. or well.. 'where renting' lol :)
---
No, that's not a straight up dscan so take those numbers with a grain of salt. I guess it could be an accurate scan of all our move ops combined but certainly not a single form up.
---
provi doesn't count :colbert:
---
I copped a fucking mumble ban today and I literally didn't even speak in mumble. Pretty sure I accidentally keyd and they just ban hammered me...

As a returning player; how do you open the old one?

That leaves the 10th spot more the less up for grabs unless someone not listed above gets a #2 or #3 slot on a nullbloc ticket. If folks rally around someone hard they have a chance to break in.
---
That's not a bad idea. Tie appearing in local to gatecloak. Gives the hunter time to load grid, all that good stuff, d-scan to know where to go, prep the dude they're gonna cyno in, and so on. And it doesn't totally break engaging fleets right after they jump a gate, because you still see everyone come in.

Both Elo and Chori didn't make it 🤔🤔🤔

From being in nc and I can say everyone I spoke to in nc had a corp and alts in rmt to make isk with. Is your brain that narrow minded to think that didn't happen
---
Nancydot got tired of winning.
---
abandoned dogs :(
---
Do you really have to make dozen of youtube videos, tons of reddit posts to encourage your corpmate to come into the game ?
---
hard times
---
Nice video
---
&gt; But then every 1337 PvPer from across the cluster would come to FW just to try to get on citadel KMs because they're easier to kill. 
---
So what, let them. There is no downside. 
---
&gt; If it's failing somewhere you have to change it everywhere.
---
I was on this today, it was hilarious!  
---
Mine! Mine! Mine!
---
Correct.
---
If CCP correct both null and FW I will resub as soon as it's done and stop winning eve but when it will happened if that happened is the question
---
Getting rid if local isn't going to happen. That already exists in game and most people choose not to live there. Null would end up emptying out even more than it is now.
---
Allow them to be linked somehow. Unified cargo  and services (so people want this) but at the same single timer.      
---
Like you go to some system and you see :            
---
* Sotyio - big toys      
---
* Azbel - research      
---
* Azbel - some production       
---
* Azbel - some other production
---
* Raitaru - some other thing that you want to T2 rig, but not pay 50bil for t2 rig      
---
* Raitaru - as there is some niche thing people want to do.          
---
* Tatara - you know, you need to refine stuff         
---
Not even considering the tons of M Refineries on the moons.       
---
And this is when you are in wealthier corp as if you are not you just split all of this L and XL EC on T2 rigged raitarus with azbel in the middle.         
---
Before you say "not all people produce/mine" ... well that is what current EVE mechanic wants you to do.  If you are in sov and want to utilize it - this is your goal!.            
---
You want to hear something more funny?      
---
There will be 2-3 citadels on top of those structures in system ... just because.
---
What is general ship class destribution for ratting?
---
 I mean for high sec you probably won't do any good piloting carrier, so I think destroyer is better for this. I am not talking about missions. Combat sites and belts only.
---
Maybe they are leaving high sec?
---
Don't be so bitter, dude. You should be used to living sov free by now.
---
Can confirm no one else is having fun!! No?
---
The eve bully(CFC) is back on his feet, bribed some (Test, snuffed) to help him, beat some (DeadCo) up, to now  terrorizing the known universe again with thousends of skill injected cap-pilots.
---
And after they terrorized the north, or glassed as they call it to sound nice, they will come for the east and the south next, cause there won't be any one left to stand against them, and the bully will rule the sandbox called eve online, because joining the wining team is easier for weak then stand up against the bully.
---
Somebody's mom forgot to pack their Go-gurt this morning.
---
Here's the problem.  Most of you people seem to vary only one thing and assume everything else remains constant.  It won't.  People's behaviour will change, meaning fewer people for you to drop except, as I said, the usual suspect who're vulnerable to you already as they aren't paying attention to local.
---
so, you actually have no link of a correct explanation of the problem, and were just playing the "if you can't find it that mean you are bad" retard card.
---
So all I said holds. You are just a whining bitch and nobody cares about your personal issues with citadels.
---
RvB is changing....
---
Our Leadership and Managment are awesome guys!!
---
Our FC´s knows there shit too!

Rip NCPL. It was your choises and actions what bring you to this.
---
You choose not to build.
---
You choose to fuck up with people who could fight un your side.
---
You choose to cheastbeat yourselves by rolling over small/med groups.
---
Don't cry if you have not their industry
---
Don't cry if no one of the big groups lift a finger in your help. (Or Even, they join the masacre)
---
Don't cry if a bigger grop rolls over you.
---
EvE is not dead. It's just you who are going into drain.
---
You have a certain point, it is really hard to fight such a overwhelming force. BUT on the other hand, most of the northern alliances just rested on their win over Goons in WWB and didn't change their playstyle to the current meta.   
---
Other alliances did, like Test/Legacy, and they have build up a pretty impressive super-fleet basically from nothing. Imagine what NC/PL could have done with their ressources if they had the same motivation/spirit that Legacy has shown?  
---
At this point I really think that the healthiest for NC (and PL) would be to actually lose their space and a big amount of their assets. So they are forced to rebuild. This has proven to be the right thing for Goons, TEST, PH to a certain degree and maybe even the DRF - which is yet to be seen to be fair. If they continue to their current strategy, they won't become stronger in any way.
---
Hon!

Both accounts are Omega so both can train at the same time without having to use Plex/MCT.

---
that poor tristan hahaha
---
Are Goons allied with Snuff?  What's going on there.
---
Delicious flair/post combo.
---
I want to know what software CCP uses to make trailers. I would LOVE to try my hand at making a fan-made trailer of my own if it came out anything close to this.
---
What is really important is not only the great amount of Titans itself, but that for every Titan in the fleets there is usually a FAX (alt) ready to jump with him. As you can see in many capital fights, that is the key to win most engagements.
---
 You don't REALLY need it, but its a luxury yacht. You want luxury, you need it.
---
welcome to the CSM experience
---
Remove asset security in null.
---
This for real ?
---
Still phasing in citadels. I'm think we will see changes come into the game in about 5 years, maybe londer.
---
why ?
---
Why should it count only when they don't do it ?
---
&gt;EDIT 2: The X47 timer was a foregone conclusion. There was no way we could prevent the keepstar from dying so the option was to attempt to kill some shit on the way out. 
---
It was definitely a foregone conclusion when the defenders failed to learn any lessons on how to actually prosecute a supercap battle. The X47 armor timer was relatively even, but the hull timer was a clown show on behalf of the defenders. I think I counted seven different ways in which we outmaneuvered the defenders in that battle, based on things we learned from the armor timer.
---
Didn't know there were new rats.... Im guessing they are killable right?
---
Fuck test.
---
that is all
---
I was looking for that Goonie-Goon guy on Twitch last night, but he never showed.. wanted to see his reaction to all this disgusting display of power from the Goons.
---
Tethered capitals, NS greatest motivations.
---
And who do you think will be next? Nobody can stand up to em so there will be no meaningful content for all those pilots and their titans (well, there isn't any already really). 
---
Rip ncpl why? They will just evade em. And so will their next targets. I'm not blaming Goons for what they are doing, i'm blaming ccp for making it possible.
---
pretty sure nc has plenty of isk.
---
So the current broken chat is not a bug but an experiment to eventually get rid of it?
---
&gt; The game needs a shake up bad, and that he would rather they overdo it and shit hits the fan than to let it keep dying.
---
Yeah, let's see them actually do this before celebrating empty words.
---
If only
---
Capsuleers are fully interinked with their pod/ships on a cerebral level.  The sounds and visualizations are happening in the pilots mind, not on a screen in the podgoo.
---
&gt; CCP is listening.
---
Yeah, no. They say they're listening, but actions speak louder than words.
---
I would love some context in what is happening in this. It sounds like someone bubbled their own fleet caps among some other things.
---
It wasn't even that. Plave set it up to create an even playing field as much as possible, keeping the ship types basic and without trying to inject too much strategy in to all. To at least TRY and avoid vets just crushing newbies left and right. Also no ECM, zero, none. The idea was to be an alternative type of "pvp-light", with easy entry.
---
When I joined 2-3 years ago: people were flying HACS, RR, ECM, people bringing neutral alts to help them.  It was really no different from FW or other forms of PVP. I'm not saying it's bad or terrible, just that it has moved away from the original ideas and didn't act as an alternative anymore compared to other pvp forms (specifically FW).
---
Eh, maybe I'm just an idiot living in the past :P
---
Like it would make a difference...
---
If theres no local i do exactly the same things as i would if there was local...Use D-Scan..
---
I think the carebear should learn to hunt before speaking.
---
Is the other fleet on grid with them?
---
I can only hit the upvote one time :(
---
sounds like wwb.
---
They've known for the best part of 5 years that fac war needs fixing. They keep saying they want to but they don't have a plan OR resources.
---
Kinetic ammo?  I ONLY HAVE NORMAL AMMO!
---
FC WAT DO?
---
I completely agree with you but my point still stands. And i'm not blaming Goons for doing it, but ccp for fucking up the game.
---
What happens if everyone else doesn’t play the game the way we play the game. How do we keep score?
---
Because the defender tried to play it safe and made the decision to keep his dps out of the fight for most of the time (only untether for doomsdays etc.). Not a generally bad decision on a tactial level, but proofed to be the wrong.
---
Clown fiesta.
---
HERES  stupid question! so i picked up the free starter pack on Steam here ([https://store.steampowered.com/app/1088740/EVE\_Online\_Invasion\_Starter\_Pack/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1088740/EVE_Online_Invasion_Starter_Pack/)) my question... how do i start it or activate it or whatever.. cuz it just opens the launcher with my other Char's on it. no new account no nothing.. ?? kinda confusing lol
---
nope, because of frigates. only instrumentals
---
Any gas site without stationary turrets can be ninja huffed. Check out a wormhole site guide and if it doesn’t list turrets under the NPC list, you’re safe.
---
no
---
Imperium is in a NIP with legacy, that’s half almost of 0.0
---
Depends on who you ask.
---
How would people's behaviour change in this case? Will people stop ratting or mining because of a change like this? I'd doubt it. A change I could see is having alts next to gates to see who's coming in, but this could be defeated by harassing the scouts (creating content with drops and counter-drops), or happening upon a wormhole that already leads into system.
---
Just finished paint balling. Took one to the side of the head.
---
But, now we're waiting for pizza before we do some crazy golf.
---
Hope you're all having a good Friday and those of you in the UK are looking forward to a good bank holiday weekend.
---
yo bros we gonna show eve our dank warz yo...
---
we havinz deh most fun bashin dem citadels
---
lets link our comms to show how fun deh eve is.
---
this is why i unsubbed 3 years ago. Knew the game was going downhill but this is pathetic propaganda content.
---
They left a couple hours into UALX iirc, about the same time the Imperium armor supers departed... the node died before they could actually do anything though... pretty sure they went back north shortly afterwards
---
I like the idea of multiple structures, scattered over the system. Relatively cheap, and fairly quick to anchor, and relatively quick to destroy (No reinforcement. Or only one, and they stop functioning when reinforced. Reinforcement would really just be to stop off timezone locusts destroying your grid every day) I'd also think having to have them at least X AU apart. 
---
Then you have thresholds for coverage. If you have less than X, local doesn't update. between X and Y, it's delayed for some time. Y and Z, it's delayed for less time. Over Z, it's immediate.
---
*Maybe* throw in the ability to repair them from reinforcement. *Maybe* with auto-destruct if you don't.
---
You want to know what ship to use for belt ratting in high sec? Yes, a destroyer is fine. If you’re asking something else, you need to clarify the question 
---
Also, HS belt ratting is a terrible way to make isk and probably very boring. If you want to stick to high sec, try doing the low level anomalies and signatures.
---
It depends on what ideas you have for the game. I love the empire building and industry stuff of EVE, so I like the general direction of the game. What is missing is drive for conflict and motivation for "nomadic playstyle", similar to PL in the past. So basically the possibility to influence the game even without owning vast amounts of space... I don't know how to solve this though ^^
---
You have the safest sapce for PVE that why i guess a lot of people come to join you because they are probably lazy and want to play the game in easy mode and on the strongest side which can be understable.
---
Going voluntary to a less strong side which will mean harder game (pve interrupt by camping, being dropped, ,evicted, with smaller defense fleet and so on) isn't in the current way of playing games for quite some people.
---
All ship losses should lose 1 skill level of the shipclass being lost
---
erm... Its EvE Onion...
---
NVM! i found it! you have to clikc Add account then other services the steam icon. then log in.. duh...
---
ARMOR HAC, ARMOR HAC, ARMOR HAC!
---
I'm sincerely sorry that you feel this way. You can not hold against Imperium that they are the most organized group ingame and as an result of that their members prosper and can bring to table due this well coordinated and strong fleet. There is no mechanic in game what would prevent another group doing the same thing. Imperium does not interfere any in-game groups growth as Imperium welcomes all well organized content creators to any game out there.  I salute personally every single member who fields their assets on this war, you are the true hero of EvE universe no matter what colors you fly.
---
After signatures, now you can also find enemy players within 10 jumps from the agency!
---
Get excited when bittervets complain about the feature saying that it used to be so much better in the old days
---
I go into enemy territory and agress some guy there... then I will post about the overwhelming response from the locals.   
---
10/10 please do again
---
Dont let perfect be the enemy of good. 
---
Delayed local is not perfect, but its one of the better suggestions that has been thrown around.
---
Idk it so well so idk
---
Well, what was it 18 months ago PL did that to Provi....  it is kind of going around.
---
It's a feature!
---
Welcome yolo T3Cs 24/7
---
So many dogs around the gate that my hauler couldn't cloak. This should be illegal
---
It sounds like some beautiful engineering
---
Dont forget NC was in the loop and were actually supposed to pay part of it, but never stayed true to their word.  So when they also agree to it but grrrrr later?   Hmmmm... what does that make you?
---
I mean I get it... ya'll wanna grrrr DC now too.... but at least get your facts straight when you spout off and regurgitate crap on reddit.  Kinda makes you look silly when ya do.
---
&gt; Its funny that they are the ones out creating the content
---
Goons have been enjoying CCPs catering to asset acquirers for a good time. That's why they could cram so many people inside the same region, same umbrella, and farm undisputedly.
---
Look where it has gotten us? You have 1200 titans on grid. Nobody will fight that, and it's not their fault. You are deceiving yourself if you think you going region by region sweeping infrastructure with 1200 titans is "content creation". That is exactly how Serenity has died. And even your linemembers will be bored after killing a few structures.
---
Game mechanics supported huddling up and bluing each other too much. As a result, you have grown to be a force nobody can contest. Game gives you no reason for you to break up your bloc. You wanted these mechanics. You were given them by CCP. Hence the deprivation of content by asset acquirers.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76872189/
---
got 'em.
---
Empire building is just fine for me too. That is not the problem.
---
cringe
---
Its not unwitting apparently, Supposedly Hilmar has started playing Eve again and got interested in WHs and now lives in one.
---
Did you even read the title of this thread?
---
There is nothing CCP can do that won't piss off all the Titan pilots.
---
I'm wondering if it's going to generate content or if it's something that will be figured out and endlessly farmed like incursions are. More ways to generate content is the #1 thing the game needs, not more PvE.
---
PL supers were involved in UALX and NC supers were on the way when the node crashed, do more research you piss-poor excuse for a reporter.
---
&gt; seven capital letters 
---
micro-agression!
---
and I ask you what allows you to affirm that 60 have been sold "at that price".
---
All I saw was random affirmation not based on any real source.
---
There is MUCH more to Empire building than owning Sov.
---
&gt; Will people stop ratting or mining because of a change like this?
---
Yes.  People who rat or mine in subs would, else be forced into VNI to limit their losses (VNI ticks are so shit I wouldn't bother).  Those who have an umbrella to save them would carry on as normal, as they do now.
---
Delayed or removed local would completely change behavior of most and, as I keep saying but nobody's listening, the people you'd get are the people you can already get because they either don't care about feeding or aren't paying attention to intel.
---
Zerg gameplay sucks
---
I am arguing it would make precisely no difference whatever.  It's neither perfect nor good.  It's ineffective and counter-productive.
---
Make bounties scale more to the lower the security the bigger the bounty. Make long function tied to security. The higher the security the lower the delay for local. The lower security will have bigger bounties and more delay to local.
---
Ihubs and structures are not TCUs, that is what he means.
---
idk about you but I rather fight a T3C blob and a cap blob
---
i feel you!
---
the game changed so RvB needs to change.
---
Now its possible to be 1 day old and sit in a super/carrier
---
and you can get space rich very fast. 
---
There are also a lot more possibilities for new players like horde, brave etc..
---
so its hard to find people who want to live the RvB way !  
---
for now we try to hold up a weekly shedule on fleets.
---
like
---
Lowsex fleets once or twice a week
---
Training fleets for different things. Basic training for mechanics like slingshot, what is falloff,  how i fly manually without anchor.
---
Hsec fights before flying elsewhere.
---
Nullsec roams
---
and fleets who stagged from thera.
---
we try to hold the content high that our member can enjoy lot of different things.
---
we also joined for 48 hours FW Caldary to see how the FWfight mechanics work.
---
Also, even if they intend on doing something, CCP moves glacially slow when it comes to reactionary changes like this. 
---
Even if they *know* something has to be done, it may take ages for it to actually happen.
---
I agree. But what is it then exactly? 
---
Some people defending NC have usually played the "we don't want to play your game" card. And I wonder what they actually like to play then.
---
Init are a pvp alliance but the rest of the imperium doesn't give a shit and walks all over them. The last war in the north? Init started the whole thing and enabled the success of the war, but in the end they were called back without a vote AND goons were the only ones paid, when init were the ones who truly earned it. Now that there's another war the rest of the Imperium is already tugging at inits leash. It's a shame, they're a competent group but they choose to stand alongside the cancer killing the game.
---
i love being on reddit while i am at work (✿◠‿◠)
---
friday is the worst work day of the week for me but these threads makes me feel better (◡‿◡✿)
---
that hon hon soundcloud made my day (◕‿◕✿)
---
They always get away with a few orders with people not paying attention to multi buys or just moving too fast. So they buy out the market, do this for a day or 2, get some quick isk, and then go back to standard market pvp.
---
That's the joke.
---
You missed the point. 
---
So what if NCPL did exactly what you said? We'd reverse the situation and here you'd have NCPL roaming around with 1.5k titans and someone else getting fucked. 
---
The problem is CCP nerfed every other playstyle other than one: hole up, farm up, build up. That's it.
---
bring back sp loss for not updating clones!!
---
Well, I would wait to say they folded. They do not push back head on, but that makes sense since Panfam has at max half the amount of supers.
---
If they take the fight head on, they would just lose, period. But with picking fights carefully, they might score some victories. And maybe, only maybe they can demoralize (or simply bore out) some imperialists. That might be enough to score a "bigger" victory, with a surprize-large formup. 
---
It is basically the same situation Legacy faced a year ago. If you can't win the big battle, you gotta wait and only take the small enough battles. And then, there will be a time where you can punish a mistake.
---
Do yourself a favor and google The Onion. This is Eve's version of that.
---
This sounds like something you'd hear on NPR.
---
That's the gobbins line.   The truth is that the first thing that happened after we heard about the deal is sigs and squads wanted to redeploy and keep going.  Mainfleet and the roaming titan fleets may have gone home to delve, but sigs and squads just didn't feel done.  Luckily gobbins decided that he was going to not be a part of the cease fire,  so we were given something to do.  We probably would have gone to the drone regions instead of hanging out in geminate and TKE if gobbins didn't decide to look a gift horse in the mouth.
---
So an agreement to not take space or attack structures means blue? Even though there have been fleet battle against each other? Even battles over 3rd party structures where we were on opposite sides? I think your definition of both blue and doughnut is too wide.
---
idk about you but i'd rather bail from any kind of blob
---
null...empty? are you retarded
---
yep, though only on that single dscan. so they most likely deployed more
---
pve expansion yawn
---
Thanks so much and thanks for visiting and doing the video. :) Looks like the link is invalid now, do you have it on youtube?
---
IMO T3C SP loss is retarded and shouldn't be a thing. The ship loss (and thus its value) should be the consequence. It would be especially damaging for "new" players getting into capitals, compared to veterans who don't give a shit because they don't have anything more to train anyway.
---
We would have zero freighter pilots in hs lol
---
Except that none of those are the issue with null sec.
---
You could make sov so easy to take that a dead chimp could do it but if a 300 titan fleet lands on your head after 30 secs you ain't gonna keep it. 
---
Local has never been an issue years, it only makes ganking ratters and miners harder but that's it.  PvPers will always take on roaming gang but again its fleet sizes that are the issue.  Roam or respond with a fleet 10 times larger will kill the chances of a fight 80% of the time.
---
Region specific resources are stupid, it just allows the most powerful entities control the rare materials and increase their strength.  By all means have variable availability across regions but don't give one coalition or area near total control if key resources.  Or even better make material deposits that vary over time or deplete if over farmed.
---
Nullsec was far more interesting when alliances were smaller and more numerous.  So you either need to find a way to get more independent alliances into the existing space or make more space and make it exponentially harder to control the more you get.
---
It's all cause some fecker left the gates open.
---
More like get excited when you see it implemented. Not just in Eve, in basically everything.
---
No Suitonia RIP
---
sigs and squads deploying to tribute wouldn't be a problem. when you actually deployed sigs they didn't really make a impact, even Test and INIT couldn't do anything relevant in their northern deployment. 
---
The truth is that he made a deal, without talking to his allies. His allies then being mad at him for it shouldn't be a surprise
---
Some people think that the name displayed on dotlan matters.  So they don't understand why you go for ihubs rather than tcus.
---
He said Thermal.
---
no u
---
Still working on that one for my campaign, getting a 2 year old toon elected is gonna be hard for me to justify
---
This comment is even more retarded than the thread
---
Burn it to the ground Hilmar.
---
You English is SO CUTE!!    Talk more; I need a good larf.
---
So you just have to look at the number that have been sold today. If the manipulation has been happening all day then you can just work it out
---
Lvl1 doesn't take lo g to yrain
---
Well, nc/pl can play the game any way they want. They will just have to accept what's happening atm (and they probably have, despite some people shitposting on Reddit. That's just what happens in Eve when groups go to war).
---
My concern is for the health of the game in the long run. Cause if every war in eve just means counting both sides titans and the weaker side (the side that is not goons :)) will just evac, people will start quiting the game out of boredom pretty soon.
---
They probaly already have been doing that for some time, to be honest.
---
it does not work like this.
---
The number sold it the number of orders that were fulfilled, not the number that were sold at 60M
---
You need to wait after DT to know the maximum value sold, and the average, for a day.
---
Providence?
---
To be fair, for all the people i've talked to that have lived in Whs and then gone back to null the biggest complaint was no the lack of local but a combination of having to scan and the logistics.
---
Most people liked the lack of local, so saying thats the reason people done like to live there is disingenuous at best.
---
&gt; Why should it count only when they don't do it ?
---
Because that fits his narrative.
---
look here https://evemarketer.com/regions/10000002/types/19806/history
---
hey, spending hours grinding structures is fun
---
But is it war?
---
let's take it the other way.
---
Imagine no ship has skill penalty on loss, why would it be wise/good to have some ship have those penalty.
---
You have 2h.
---
Totally agree. 
---
The question is, how to solve that problem?
---
I feel like those don’t really fit trig style
---
Not Tech 1. Think about the newbros!
---
Judge Sarns official motto while he was in rifta was "fly drunk, fly rifters!" so I'm not surprised at that :)
---
That's ok and thanks for the info :)
---
Passive gila should have no problem in t4. that's maybe around 40m of fitting max
---
Gobbins just didn't like the fact that he lost and needed to save face.  Panfam and the north making up excuses to turn on each other to save face is pretty much the norm.  How you sell it to the line doesn't matter, they'll buy it because they want a win, even if it means people they've fought side by side with.  :shrug:   I'm sure gobbins will spin this too as their friends tactically retreating or something.  Or the isk war.  That's always a good one.
---
All actions in eve incur skill loss now. If you undock you return all skills to 1
---
Yep.
---
pap?
---
pussies
---
There are many reasons people dont live in wormholes. Including limited real estate. No local is one of the biggest reasons people are actually there.
---
fighting any of goons is seal clubbing imo if your really going to ask that.
---
at no point have i stated im in or connected to NC. lets start with that. me? 
---
and if i were faced with fighting 1000titans with fax's id probably look elsewhere for a fight too.
---
i wonder, if goons attacked Vydra, just Vydra, would Vydra field everything against 1000titans. or would they coware in a corner, or would they hit the big nasty bloc wherever they could?
---
If you start shooting them, they'll call their buddies in. If they don't die and you warp off they'll hunt you for a little bit, even warping and jumping gates if needed.
---
Yes! And if you want some free sp get a buddy invite link! Send me a dm and ill hook you up
---
Capitals are T1 ships, so this should apply to all T1 ships.       
---
**But basically idea of any kind of skill lose is dumb in game where you pay real money to get this SP.**
---
Region specific resources was the driving factor for most of the major wars in EVE. I would like to see it come back, but the biggest issue with EVE currently is the proliferation of Supercap/capitals that was caused by rorquals/skill injectors.
---
Holy shit nice
---
Nc undocked. What a time to be alive
---
I dont get posts like this one
---
Op asks a "question" however is very biased in comments and denies facts and other statments thatvdont align with his view..
---
But then again i forget reddit is filled with mindless drones who belive the properganda from their side and are always rigbt
---
I don't remember hearing that phrase uttered in the tv series, would you care to enlighten me \[Im honestly curious here\]?
---
He said to play and to be a wormholer recently in an AMA.
---
If only i had that answer :)
---
Scary showerthought - what if trig incursions use FOB/sotoyo code and spawn fleets of diamond trig rats with the advanced AI.
---
Source?
---
According to last years fanfest and also [this article](https://screenrant.com/eve-online-ccp-games-ceo-hilmar-veigar-petursson-interview/) he is playing the game.
---
&gt; Killah Bee
---
LOL
---
&gt; Sort Dragon
---
The fuck?
---
&gt; Merkelchen
---
Congrats in advance.
---
&gt; Olmeca Gold
---
I just want to see what happens.
---
&gt; Gobbins
---
&gt; The Judge
---
Does he even play anymore?
---
&gt; Aryth
---
Again, congrats in advance.
---
&gt; Xenuria
---
Yes, for the chance to hear him and Olmeca debate stuff.
---
&gt; Vily
---
Neat. Also yay Canada!
---
&gt; Innominate
---
Congrats in advance, again.
---
POS only anchorable at moons was also simple which is why people hated it. 
---
The solution is not for arbitrary restrictions on what you can or cannot do.
---
NO U
---
Neural networks and AI are unnecessary for this problem, this is not an issue of selecting a 3 from a bee or selecting an obstacle from a stereoscopic rgb image. This is monitoring and analyzing actions taken by characters where you can manually select the data to record so you don't have to segment the data from the noise.
---
This kind of analysis is better suited to a properly configured and thresholded algorithm (preferably weighted on the cautious side as not to ban legit players on accident)
---
Don't know. But no one can face them alone. You needed the GotG and Test moving to Tribute or, pushing right now from Period Basis all way up. Fucking up their renter economy first and then their own house.
---
You needed to the independent small groups to harass randomly here and there and they should leave Tribute, or at least split their forces in two.
---
Fraternity could be a wild card there, but NCPL should talk them to explain that if Goons wins, is serenety 2.0.
---
But, NCPL just keep messing around with everyone and now cry about CCP let Goons be that powerful. Every other group had the oportunity to build that strong, but didnt. EvE let you play the way you want to, don't blame if someone choose to be the strong and you choose to be weaker because "no Empire builders lol" Remember. NCPL choose to mess with TAPI, NCPL choose to push med/little groups to Goons side, NCPL choose to not build a heavy industry. 
---
Small groups smashed in Dronelands by NCPL are not CCP fault. But NCPL being smashed by Goons is? You take fun picking a small group, well, they are having fun picking you.
---
You enjoyed being the Hammer, now is your turn to be the anvil pal. Poetic Justice.
---
if you want cap skill loss, then give us T3 caps. then take skill points from them.
---
Anyone you want. 
---
EVE is a lot more fun when you stop trying to follow the guidelines of what is best for someone else if they were in your situation.
---
What you **want** to do will always be the best activity for you.
---
Nope, only account created via Steam
---
wow great lip service
---
Both are ccp's "fault". And i think you highly overestimate the impact all this is having on ncpl.
---
Ok so red boxing but not yellow? And then if they never red box me nothing happens at all, right?
---
save face? what? 
---
&gt;I'm sure gobbins will spin this too as their friends tactically retreating 
---
You know what NC. is doing right now literally is tactically retreating right? the same way goons did it in WWB, and the only smart thing to do.
---
The more you know. I've only ever heard it in letterkenny
---
Remove it from empire too
---
Quicker than they fixed the other exploits. Lol
---
Just remember, at some point people were hype for VR, Dust, Mobile and a billion other things that crumbled into sand.
---
I assume for the same reason my camera makes that classic shutter sound when I take a picture using its entirely solid state process -- it's what people expect to hear, so we simulate it to make them happy.
---
Nah that was just the first moveop. We moved even more
---
Never not scan, at this point my scanning figure is like those birds that constantly go up and down.... I can't stop, even when I have local chat
---
The problem is that when the official one launches, it will not be as upvoted because it's old news by then. And people are resorting to reuploads because of this.
---
goons in tribute
---
BURN THEM ALL  [https://dscan.info/v/3c4dc137fc36](https://dscan.info/v/3c4dc137fc36)
---
Horde killed ncpls ability to put up a reasonable fight by attacking GotG; you can blame gobins (lol CSM candidate) for a weakened north.
---
The Incursion trailer had better dialogue.
---
Do Vydra hold nullspace?
---
Once again the 'i want fites' crew expose how nothing could be further from the truth, you don't have to win the war to put up a good fight against odds you can't beat head on, but that would require effort and tactical thinking instead of literally running to the opposite end of the map and clubbing the retards in their crib.
---
[Literally the only fights you enjoy](https://i.imgur.com/09UzcM3.png)
---
Is ugly as fuck. But it get the work done. It's not my best, but i never had formal education on it.
---
I could speak a few lenguages more anyway if i hurt your feelings with my english.
---
Hahahahahahaha oh wow buddy that’s not why people hated poses
---
Naw, you're right.
---
I am biased though I would love to see what facts~ I denied. No one is really answering the question either, how is it possible that panfam went from fighting a decent defence to timing everything to au tz and hoping goons get tired?
---
That's a blue croissant at best, even if INIT wasn't on frosty terms with test these days
---
Yes and yes.
---
Ashimuus are seriously cheap right now you can welp them all day every day. That might be a fun option..
---
Of course. You can move to Low, and keep doing your thing. (Barbaric/tribal style). Even trying to re build after.
---
Sorry, posting from mobile. It does it automatically:(
---
Id pay to see that.  Let's take it one step further and have a roast kinda like TV.   Everyone/CEOS takes turns in the hot seat while everyone else shits on them.   Trade places, repeat.  I think it would be healthy.
---
Haha was actually pretty fun sounding with the lag
---
This is true, but I have hopes for the coming year after reading some of the csm blobs, as long as another gsm does not get elected a lot of what hilmar brought up is also reflected in many of the csm hopefuls campaigns
---
Real meme trading
---
Sentry dog guards your shit.
---
Maybe INIT should leave the biggest coalition in the game then
---
as always master maneuvering
---
happy cake day btw
---
What's this from?  Not even close to what I had on dscan last night for the timer.
---
from here on known as "the best boi"
---
this hurts - i sold my soul to the spod gods to buy these titans :-(
---
The only thing you can get from that ama is that Hilmar knows how to market the game, period. He isn't entirely stupid and honestly can say anything he wants as long as it creates "hype" and extends the lifetime of the product they made, take the rose tinted glasses off, the dude just markets the game properly, nothing else nothing more... I don't trust those crooks as people here already said, get excited when you see it on SiSi, and even then hope it doesen't get axed...
---
So real talk, what are the realworld expected improvements with this client.
---
What can you do if the CSM is made up of primarily huge coalition backers and the like, who are only interested in keeping their sandcastles safe and don´t have a modicum of knowledge about real PvP.  
---
Krabs will go baaaaaaaa that ratting while aligned and checking d-scan once in a while is too difficult anyway.
---
While we are at it we could also unfuck cyno inhibs - what is the point of a thingy supposed to prevent cynos from going up, but actually gives the other guy one minute to light his cyno?
---
Given its limited effective range it should online instantly. No discussion.
---
LoL no poor allowed
---
Survival of the stronger. No more, no less. Still can be in WH or move to Low or Even some afk mining in high.
---
NCPL has superv PvP skills. But lacks Diplo and builders ones, -or the will to-. You need both in the biggers leagues. If someone doesnt want to farm up and build up, and chooses not to, it's not CCP fault.
---
I’ve been wondering the same thing, other than some performance improvements, what else can we expect?
---
Jedi huffing is not ninja huffing. Ninja huffing is the spring out after the rats spawn, Jedi huffing is sig tanking the rats while still mining gas.
---
use arrow keys.
---
**IKITURSA**
---
Bonuses:
---
Precursor Cruiser (per level):
---
* 5% bonus to Light Entropic Disintegrator tracking speed
---
* 5% bonus to Light Entropic Disintegrator damage
---
Heavy Assault Cruiser (per level):
---
* 20% bonus to Light Entropic Disintegrator maximum damage multiplier bonus
---
* 7.5% bonus to Heavy Entropic Disintegrator maximum range
---
Pretty sure the bonuses should be for Heavy Entropics not light entropics, hopefully its just a typo.
---
No, not *that* kind of PvP alliance.
---
Why don't we just remove that stupid mechanic?
---
Do you own a Titan?
---
Goons at least fought in subcaps in wwb, there are a lot of fights, even when they were completely outnumbered they undocked and fought in subs, nc/pl/panfarm aren't even forming. They've completely retreated and have zero intention of defending anything. They have no ops planned to defend anything either.
---
Can someone copy the whole text?
---
You know you can rat while aligned, right?
---
Karma is bitch. If you go around terrorizing all smaller groups for too long you will end up against someone bigger and stronger that can do the same thing to you eventually.
---
You lost the armament war and failed to acquire sufficient allies to stand a chance.
---
Maybe next time you should try something else? This all seems very similar to When Matthew Perry showed the Tokugawa Shogunate that their way of life had end. Adapt or Die. The north is a spitting image of feudal Japan where the Warrior elite rules and collect tax from the farmers. When you are ruled by warmongering people they will make bad policy decisions. Attacking potential new allies, creating new enemies or if there are no handy enemies, conjure a reason to attack a weaker ally, why not blame them for loosing a war while in fact they were the ones ending the hostilities..
---
The Imperium however is more like a group of nations who have embraced the industrial revolution and now vastly outgun their opponents.
---
Go ahead and do what you can do to survive this war. Run if you want to. Just remember that the "win by making them bored of war" tactic might work in the short run but it will just mean that The Imperium will come out of the war fairly unscathed and bored.
---
Do you know what creates war in Eve? Boredom.
---
Not welping = crying?
---
The problem isn't that capitals exist.  The problem is that we want people to use them (engage, be aggressive) but we also don't want vast disparities in power that result in suppression of content (other side just docks up/quits).
---
There isn't a good resolution to this.  Suppress the use of capitals is suppressing content.  Not suppressing capitals suppresses other content.
---
It's actually only in the books apparently, but it's a repeated phrase within the series. Surprised it never actually appeared on the adaption.
---
The trailer itself is great. The only thing I didn't like about it was the voices. Previous trailers had a more intense feel to them. The voice acting in this one feels underwhelming, to say the least.
---
I’m sure ccp would say “mechanics working as intended. Huge sale on plex/skins/extractors this weekend at store”
---
The removal of asset safety is a bit touchy, instead of removing it, I would like the price to recover assets increased to better reflect the worth of those assets. 
---
This way we don't have servers die when you kill a structure in a 10% tidi fight and it is still more painful to lose the structures than currently
---
looks like someone got a little training from the marketing crew... doubt much else has changed...
---
I'm having a blast up here. Traveling is fun so I really appreciate this weekend north for the war.
---
&gt;INIT. is a PvP alliance
---
You can call it whatever you want. But no one will respect you as a pvp alliance until you start resetting all of your blues.
---
"Reduced jam duration on Hornet EC-300, Vespa EC-600, and Wasp EC-900 to 5 seconds (was 20 seconds)"
---
This actually had me smile a lot more than i care to admit
---
(p.s.: how does one actually quote properly)
---
Your user name checks out.
---
1) In these days of injectors, this merely means increased cost for losing capitals. While it might be valuable, why don't we directly increase the cost instead of creating demand for SP farms, putting pressure on PLEX prices?
---
2) Under this proposal losing a carrier and a supercarrier would have the same amount of cost increase.
---
3) The proposal actually punishes one of the most important ways to fight the capital menace: Dreadbombs. We suicide hundreds of dreads to keep umbrella regions a little bit less safe.   You want to increase our cost per dread from 1.5b per dread to 10b per dread (else cut down our dps by not maxing skills). Why? That just means more safety for supers and titans.
---
Patch notes
---
- something about triglavian ships i don't fly anyways
---
- something about wardecs i don't do anymore
---
- something about production i don't know about
---
- new highsec event that *might* have potential for non-consensual pvp i like
---
I like it so far
---
I like the fact they went "Bridging? Nah, just *bolt a fucking gate* onto the bottom of the Titan and we good."
---
Trying to wormtongue init is so 7 months ago.
---
So, this "Invasion" will be located exclusively on HS for the moment... not sure how to feel about that.
---
Feeder and known blobber. :P
---
Underrated comment. :)
---
REMOVE LOCAL!
---
There have been fights over Ihubs the past 2 nights/early morning.
---
&gt;(p.s.: how does one actually quote properly)
---
\&gt;(p.s.: how does one actually quote properly)
---
“You kicked my drone.”
---
Maybe I misunderstood, but didn’t it say that it would spread and maybe eventually a larger invasion would come by?
---
But is this not the meta NC. &amp; PL introduced. I remember being a starry eyed newbee in the White noise war and being constantly shit on by PL and NC. titans. Mass titan numbers have been the meta for years, its just now your are not in the lead.
---
i love australian capsuleers with reckless abandon.
---
and someone needs to give all of streamfleet a hug on my behalf.
---
also mad props to the inventor of brown sugar pearl milk tea, because holy moly that’s good.
---
Then how else would you know who to pay your rent to?
---
&gt;entosis 
---
&gt; tenacity
---
hahaha come on now. sov warfare has very little to do with it, the fact they were massively fucking outnumbered was the only relevant thing.
---
*  The amount of Anomalies and Signatures in a K-Space system is now visible from anywhere. 
---
ffs ccp we warned you
---
Your client is less likely to randomly crash in very large fights.  You may be able to go a little less potato mode in very large fights.
---
That dscan isn't even remotely close to what was moved, someone literally pasted that shit multiple times into that tool to get those results
---
I feel you. Eve players been burnt too many times with false promises so till CCP actually come through with their promises playerbase remains sceptical.
---
Im going for glass half full .
---
I AGREE WITH YOUR OPINION AND WOULD LIKE TO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR NEWSLETTER.
---
killing exploration content and making null even safer in one go =(
---
One reason for your client crashing in big fights has been eliminated. That's literally it. It won't improve your FPS, it won't fix desync, it won't let you go less potato, it won't open up any new gameplay changes.
---
It's a good thing and I'm glad they are doing it, but there's a serious failure to manage expectations here on CCP's part.
---
They weren’t plans you muppet
---
They were *roadmaps*
---
That's why I said "for the moment".
---
&gt;But no one will respect you
---
You've made both the mistake of thinking we care about your respect and thinking you speak for everyone.
---
So, uh... it seems the billboard is stuck on a *very* short loop, between this and "Star Captain". CCPls do something about it before I start seeing him and his fabulous Mirelle spectacles in my sleep...
---
It was the book lmao
---
&gt;also would make it where you can't mine as AFK as you can rn.
---
I mean, that'd be the case for groups without an overwhelming umbrella, sure.
---
Delve and the like would keep on truckin' just fine.
---
You might need some glasses mate, that's some wicked shortsightedness you've got there.
---
&gt;Added the Board My Corvette button; Corvettes will no longer be made available automatically on docking in a pod, instead the player can choose to be placed inside a corvette using this button. If the character does not currently have a corvette then they will be provided one and then boarded into it. If a corvette is already in the ship hangar the character will board it and the standard modules fitted will be repaired.
---
Is this only in stations, or will it be available in Upwell structures too?
---
You're Goon pets. It is what it is. Competent pets sure, but pets. Most major powers historically have had a competent pet or two (e.g. MC under BoB).
---
They need to ban VPNs.
---
Safer? I agree it makes PVE easier, which is bad, but safer I don’t know about... in theory you can now tell when someone is ratting next door without having to be in the system
---
That's nice dear.
---
How do bots generate money for ccp?
---
&gt;1 comment
---
10 seconds + a nerf to the sheer number of green sites. I jump into a system, see a VNI on 10 AU, and then notice that there are two dozen anoms in range to scan. I diligently d-scan from the more-likely to less, but I'm all but certain that it's going to be gone. It would be far better if I-Hub upgrades bumped the quality of the sites and their respawn rate but not their sheer numbers (removing lower-quality junk).
---
I thoroughly enjoyed seeing a trailer that accurately depicts EVE players as largely incompetent.
---
People paying real money to get this accounts running(before they can plex them at least)
---
There is no reason to ignore the problem in other cases
---
Or just balance the game so that a ship that has five times the performance of a T3C doesn't cost the same?
---
Ignoring all things but efficiency, there is no reason to buy a marauder or similar when you can lose a carrier or dread for a fraction of the price. The scary thing is that supers are approaching a similar point and the only reason that they haven't reached the same level of throwaway status is because of killboard autism.
---
enlighten me senpai
---
Triglavians do not share the same sympathy, the pirates of New Eden do.
---
finally a high quality video without autistic screeching. thanks!
---
10b hel lmao
---
All pve in eve gets solved. People wouldnt do it if they couldnt win it 100% of the time.
---
Its a shame cause if it was dangerous after the first week this feature would die out and no one would want to do it.
---
It's been a while since we had such a good cinematic.
---
The only thing that saddens me is that this expansion is entirely focused on a PvE event. Hyped about the trailer, but not about the release and tye 'content' coming with it.
---
Yes but did they think of where to get water on the way?
---
If someone wants to crab in peace they will check out new signatures in nearby systems. If its a WH it will be rolled, if its a explo site it will be cleared. Right now this didn't happen because noone wanted to jump systems to check. I just hope that people will be too lazy to use this info to its full potential.
---
Sure but admitting it is the first step right, slide me in the cautious optimism section.
---

Maybe he sells citadels
---
&gt; "Woah this triple-boxing guy talks to himself" 
---
its... its not normal?
---
You don't leave a coalition just because your friend stopped you from beating an unconscious person to death.
---
In Upwells too.
---
You can calculate it from the daily average.
---
Get excited when its in the next patchnotes. Plans from ccp mean jack shit since they dont followthrough with 90% of the shit they PLAN to do
---
Damn near everyone in the game is a pet; some are more aware of that than others.
---
And how did those same people respond to goons doing it in the casino war?  Did they respect them for making the "only smart" call?
---
You should watch it with sound great line right before the 180 turn "oh shit I have implants in this pod"
---
For people who rageroll a k space static in their wormhole for content, it shoots us in the foot.
---
I guess Incarna showed them they can recover from an epic misstep. I just hope they don't go too far and find the times have changed. But I do like that they are willing to risk a few things. (full disclosure: haven't played much in last year so currently he is risking little for me)
---
&gt; In order to declare an aggressive war, the attacking side must now designate a specific Upwell Structure that they own somewhere in highsec space as the "War Headquarters" for that war. If the War Headquarters structure is destroyed, removed from space, or removed from the control of the attacking organization for any reason the war will enter its 24 hour cooldown and then end.
---
Doesn't it take about a week e.g. the length of most wars, to kill a highsec structure anyway?
---
FFS Wardec team. You had one job.
---
Still no reason to come back to the game after 18 months out then?
---
There’s a fleet before this that the hon hons turned into clicking and then into Mine. But then we decided PAP was funnier because thats what tracks our participation.
---
First really good looking and hyping trailer in a long time.
---
It is hyping for the wrong things, though. I'd like to have a hype about a PvP fight, not PvE, which ofc is equally important, so that you can find your pew-pew.
---
I would think so yes, why would all the goons thats calling nc cowards now call themself the dame back then?
---
Better than season 8 game of thrones anyway!
---
On sisi it applies to both stations and upwell.
---
"Oh shit, I've got implants in this pod"

---
War Declarations:
---
The next stage of the War Declarations revamp has been released, including the introduction of War Headquarters structures, War cost simplification, improved mutual wars, and war UI improvements.
---
More information about these changes and where they fit into the wider design for war declarations in EVE can be found in this dev blog.
---
War Headquarters:
---
In order to declare an aggressive war, the attacking side must now designate a specific Upwell Structure that they own somewhere in highsec space as the "War Headquarters" for that war. If the War Headquarters structure is destroyed, removed from space, or removed from the control of the attacking organization for any reason the war will enter its 24 hour cooldown and then end. If a war ends due to the removal of the War HQ, the former attacking organization will be unable to declare new wars against the former defending organization for two weeks.
---
The identity of the War HQ structure is included in war notifications for the defender, as well as being visible to all interested parties through the war report window.
---
Wars that are active during the Invasion expansion downtime will continue without needing a headquarters structure during a transition period that is scheduled to end at downtime on July 25th. If a war is active without a War HQ at the end of the transition period it will enter its 24 hour cooldown at that point and end the next day.
---
War Cost Simplification:
---
The cost of aggressive war bills has been set at a flat fee of 100 million isk per week.
---
Mutual Wars:
---
Mutual wars have been revamped to improve quality of life for participating organizations
---
Aggressive wars can no longer be converted into mutual wars. Instead, mutual wars may be started through an invite/acceptance process.
---
Mutual wars may now be started without any isk cost or structure requirements
---
Either side of a mutual war may now decide to end the war at will, triggering the standard 24 hour cooldown before shooting stops
---
Corporations that are allies of the defending side in an ongoing war can no longer join an alliance until the war ends or their ally contract finishes, unless the alliance they are attempting to join is also the only defender they are allied with.
---
User Interface:
---
Added the Board My Corvette button; Corvettes will no longer be made available automatically on docking in a pod, instead the player can choose to be placed inside a corvette using this button. If the character does not currently have a corvette then they will be provided one and then boarded into it. If a corvette is already in the ship hangar the character will board it and the standard modules fitted will be repaired.
---
The styling for the Undock, View Outside and Take Control buttons have been updated.
---
Updated Redeem Queue Notifications so that they now appear in the Neocom and not in the notification widget.
---
Hangars are now visible below the station services by default.
---
Remodeled the Agency!
---
New cleaner and more functional UI, using the Progressive Disclosure approach to funnel the user to their desired content.
---
Bookmarking pages is now possible, allowing you to skip the funnel and get straight to your most used pages.
---
Agent Finder is back!
---
Filters are now more visible and easy to use.
---
Filters will now remember their last settings for each page.
---
Reset all filters button is available.
---
Search for specific planet types in the Planetary Production Agency page to establish your colony on, and if they are within range of your Remote Sensing skill, see their available resources without opening the PP window of each planet.
---
The amount of Anomalies and Signatures in a K-Space system is now visible from anywhere.
---
Combat Anomalies, Ore Anomalies, and Ice Belts show the exact type of site from within 1 jump away. At 2 jumps or further, only the existence of the site is shown.
---
Storyline Missions and Escalations will guide the player to their respective pages by displaying the NEW! label.
---
Contested level of Factional Warfare system and available FW complexes are now visible from anywhere in EVE.
---
Incursion locations and incursions types (Scout/Vanguard/Assault/HQ) now shown in the Agency.
---
Amount of accumulated CONCORD LP from completing Incursion sites is now shown in the Agency.
---
Sites shown in the Agency now have the same contextual menu when right clicked as they do when right clicked in space, so you can now fleet warp to a site for example.
---
Tooltips explaining the various features of EVE are present throughout the Agency to teach players about the mechanics of each.
---
Triglavian Invasions are available through the Agency.
---
In-client CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Survey) in system menu
---
The new Help Pointer feature has been added and is available in the Utilities folder of the Neocom.
---
This feature allows players to share links to different UI elements that will highlight that UI element with a label and arrow when clicked. It is expected to be especially valuable for veteran player mentoring their new friends.
---
More information about the Help Pointer feature can be found in this dev blog.
---
War UI Improvements:
---
New “War Info” tab in the Wars tab of the corporation window, which explains the war declaration system and shows you the war status of your corporation at a glance
---
The "Kill Reports" tab for a corporation has been moved from the "Wars" tab to the "Home" tab of the corporation window.
---
New “War History” tab in the corporation window under the Wars tab, which displays previous wars and currently enforced peace periods due to surrenders and War HQ removal.
---
New “Mutual War Invites” tab in the corporation window under the Wars tab, visible to corporation directors and CEO which show all the current incoming or outgoing mutual war invites. Here directors and CEOs can also find a toggle to block incoming mutual war invites if they wish
---
Improved the war history section in the show info window for corporations and alliances
---
Updated and improved the war report, including information about the identity of the War HQ
---
Added a “Wars” tab to the show info window of Upwell structures if they are a War HQ
---
Added an icon + tooltip to structure entries in the structure browser if they are a War HQ
---
Added an icon to the character selection screen that clearly displays when your characters are involved in an active war
---
Added an icon to the top section of the character sheet that clearly displays when your characters are involved in an active war
---
Added an icon to the crimewatch timers section at the top left of the screen that clearly displays when your characters are involved in an active war
---
Added suppressible warning popup when undocking in High Sec while involved in an active war.
---
Updated and added numerous war related notifications and warnings.
---

Your take away is the players being goofs? And not the fact that the fortizar sized titan , station thing can move and has engines ??????
---
Bpo when ccp ?
---
Sure great, but when are you going to give us more space to grow?
---
(✿◕‿◕✿) these threads are always the best (✿◕‿◕✿)
---
hope you guys are all going to have an amazing weekend, can't wait for invasion on tuesday &lt;3
---
Done o7
---
The plot definitely has more depth and reliability.
---
stop complaining then
---
&gt; War Headquarters:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In order to declare an aggressive war, the  attacking side must now designate a specific Upwell Structure that they  own somewhere in highsec space as the "War Headquarters" for that war.  If the War Headquarters structure is destroyed, removed from space, or  removed from the control of the attacking organization for any reason  the war will enter its 24 hour cooldown and then end. If a war ends due  to the removal of the War HQ, the former attacking organization will be  unable to declare new wars against the former defending organization for  two weeks.  
---
&gt;The identity of the War HQ structure is included in  war notifications for the defender, as well as being visible to all  interested parties through the war report window.
---
FINALLY
---
Humans have become accustomed to seeing and hearing certain things in movies/shows that even if they are not real our brain has said it was real. One example is being show with a bullet in a movie always causes a blood explosion to happen even tho that's not how that works in real life but we have seen it so often that if it doesn't happen it looks weird to us
---
Could be worse, could be paying rent for space you cant rat in due to campers and your landlords invite PH to come mine in the systems free of charge
---
This is pretty weak.  I doubt anyone think delve is in any danger in the slightest.  We're currently at work.  When we come back home it'll be like you were never even there.
---
They are a problem because they are disposable 600 million mobile depots that also provide invulnerability and high-quality defenses, making awake-or-bot ratters extremely difficult to catch. Moreover, those ratters (or miners) have no reason to ever leave system in a ship that can be caught and generate a small-scale, emergent fight. (Travel down pipe -&gt; die to small camp nobody had seen yet -&gt; get friends and break up camp -&gt; yay! fights.)   
---
Want to remove that structure? 2-3 timers and a week later, you can, and a new one (or four) will be back up before the first one is even dead.
---
I can only say happy clicking to you :)
---
I steal dogs for a living.
---
When said DPC is dcing and not able to do things for hours on end it was the correct decision.
---
Not gonna lie, I want a high quality copy of that image for my desktop, the only version I could find was a shitty low res one :(
---
We're just rehashing what was said to us.  Can't have it both ways.
---
Actually the turning point was the Test Goon war. Max numbers from then will never be realized again.
---
EvE is too small.
---
Goons teaching others how to take risks? The same goons who never took any risks, and either fielded overwhelming super numbers or didn't field them at all? The same goons who only post "docked, lol" after a win?
---
NC/PL fielded their super fleets numerous times while not being sure in victory and docked after the initial losses - unlike goons, who don't undock unless they are sure.
---
Sure, that simply means goons are better and planning ahead, better at strategy. Gut one thing goons cannot claim is bravery.
---
running renter empire vs recruiting every mouth breathing monkey that can mash f1?
---
&gt;even if creating a robust and nuanced system for detecting bots is a huge pain in the ass
---
Even if that were true (its not), eve has a ton of "dumb" bots that would likely get caught by checking the number of ticks per day. CCP could do this in less than 10 lines of code.
---
Can confirm. I was in TEST back then and we were starting to get antsy waiting for the perfect moment to drop the hammer. High Command told us we couldn't waste it, that it had to be done at a decisive moment and so we waited.
---
Eve is a game of patience and dedication in sooooo many ways. The payoff though, oh so sweet and unlike any other game out there.
---
The trailer looks good, I don’t feel the tone worked however. It just didn’t have the impact of other trailers imo.
---
Zzzz.
---
You dont think there is a chance that the noise is a result of more people becoming aware of the issue?
---
gf thanks for fun fight
---
Capsuleers kind of forgot about the Triglavians. But the Triglavians didn't forget about them...
---
Thanks for answer. And what class will be great for low and nulls?
---
Goons teaching others how to take risks? The same goons who never took any risks, and either fielded overwhelming super numbers or didn't field them at all? The same goons who only post "docked, lol" after a win and "made you form" if they themselves decided not to risk?
---
Yes, that simply means goons are better and planning ahead, better at strategy. NC/PL lost so much more supers battles not due to being better. But one thing goons cannot claim is bravery.
---
Fucking with local is a bad idea period. Last time they did that they broke the chat from MONTHS.
---
Yes.
---
Thanks for answer. I want to do both belts and combat sites. 
---
And what classes will be great for low and nulls?
---
Even then just focusing on Havens there are too many though.
---
Still, better than including actual autists screaming in their $30 microphones in your trailer.
---
Goons talking about abandoning allies? XD
---
Usually they are on the other side of the WH, at least in the case of doorstopping.
---
how would they know its a WH, it doesnt say it will be identified, simply just a Signature.
---
&gt; You have the casual comms chatter that is very close to real one, the  cinematic environment is close enough to reality too. Plot, visuals,  forgetting about the pod etc. - all cool. 
---
they got this perfect mix of worth shatering events going on with immortal demimods reacting to it in a joking fashion. Love it
---
I get what they were going for, but it bothers me that the guy says “I don’t know why I even play with you guys” - this definitely seems like the type of trailer where you’d want it to feel all in-world instead of “this is a game”. But that feeling of “haha I made it” after the ship makes it out, followed by “oh what oh god what’s that” is pretty sweet~
---
I can’t wait to see the Xordazh in action~~
---
You seriously claiming GOTG being able to fight anyone anywhere? XD
---
Why?
---
I click them often for entertainment, but as I learned to read and calculate in school ... you still need to be really, I mean really really, stupid to fall for 9 of 10 scams ...
---
There are several flails in what you are describing.
---
 - mobile depots take less time to anchor, can't be seen on the overlay.
---
 - citadels provide very bad quality defense unless they are backed by a fleet.
---
 - citadels don't increase the anoms / roid belts in the system. Moon structure do create roid fileds, but now it needs activity when before it needed nothing. Thus it actually gives you MORE targets.
---
 - yeah you get nothing from kiling a structure and it costs you time. Guess what ? It needs time and money to place that structure( 600M+ anchor), also to move it somewhere else.
---
I've yet to be explained why structure spamming is a real issue and not just basic rants of people.
---
And your "get friends to break up camp" is … sorry but when does it happen ? They'll get bored, just wait for them to leave.
---
good response. thanks. TBF this is actually precisely what i understood would be the case, guess i was hoping for more (and obviously CCP isnt managing expectations here)
---
You're awesome. Thanks!.
---
They won't, but they will know something changed (sigCount++) making it easier and faster to find newly spawned WHs.
---
What?
---
Alts are used for eyes in neighboring systems regularly. Nullblocs also have intel channels where your alliance mates can post about dangerous shit that is close by you which makes their alts your eyes in a way.
---
This does nor resembles the truth in any way!
---
Cyno inhibs aren't killing EvE.
---
Big alliances are, the mobility of these groups is too large, and they don't fight each other like they used to. Station mechanics were actually good, you can't change my mind on this.
---
well barely
---
So still no suspect timers on t5 filaments?
---
A culture of dextrorotatory lactic acid bacteria has an IQ of 2. You think he will reach it?
---
Not serious. Any "bought time" = time for goons to get even more ahead. Everyone knows that now, everyone knew that back then. As soon as legacy started cooperating with imperium against a common foe - the 3-sided eve ceased to exist and the losing side gave up for good. Any further content is not going to be serious - structure bashes, pointless evictions, invasions of undefended regions. The last actual content left is going to be roams and fighting frenemies without any all-out-wars.
---
Not the answer.
---
War needs risk, there is no risk in war now. EvE 101 said this OVER, and OVER and OVER again. The amount of destruction is too low.
---
I think that's because citadels are too cheap. Stations were a good thing. And there is no risk in sov warfare.
---
So excited
---
Is it bad that 20ish Slyce seen by people outside as the only PvP GOTG had left in there?..
---
Can you fix the title to mean something in English?
---
He was kicking ass, man :-). That was so much fun to see “This system is now my system, I’ve got a gate camp here!"
---
sounds better
---
that's my favorite movie
---
hey as long is its dangerous if you fuck up, but you can get to a point where you can run it with out dieing there they design has done its job.  
---
yay we can run it easily.  
---
some kinda fuck up:  yay i just died,  
---
would be ok with me.
---
How it touchy? Eve didnt have asset safety for almost ever. It was a huge conflict driver in wormholes due to the plunder a conqueror could garner from killing assets.
---
Instead we get rorquals on ice.. and no asset risk to the massive stashes people can safely store in "dangerous" space.
---
You can always protect your assets in an Npc statoon.
---
"GOD DAMNT TOD, DID YOU LEAVE THE GATE OPEN AGAIN" Some trig commander.
---
&gt;You can call it whatever you want.
---
Are you doing selective reading?
---
Honestly why are cynos instant? Would it help at all if cynos were lit, but had to "charge up" a certain amount before anyone could jump through? Giving whoever is tackled some semblance of a chance to either fight off the tackler, call for help, etc?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bo4zed/i_was_on_eves_csm8_i_was_spacefamous_for_a_long/
---
After the initial losses that is. First they were saying "everyone should be deployed, no one cares if you die there" and as soon as they said that they organised secondary defensife umbrella there =\]
---
mega oof
---
I agree local isn't the issue, it never has been. And idiots who think it is were just the wormholers who the left.
---
*Fucky isn't that was Hilmar is? A dirty fucking wormholer?*
---
I unsubbed, because war doesn't mean anything. You can't pin alliances to the wall like in the Test/Goon war.
---
Visually? Sure, great, whatever. Being impressed by CGI hasn't been a thing for quite a few years now.
---
But the dialogue is just... Bizarre. It's like they are talking about playing a game. These are supposed to be in-universe characters diving into a filament, right? But we hear them talking about stuff like it's a game "Yea, you know, 12 ships, kill em, get loot" and "Hey it's empty, guess someone's already run this pocket LOL". The only thing missing are emoji.
---
Good. It's a testament that the blue donut mega block strategy is so effective that people bow to your might. Is that not what the strategy seemed to accomplish?
---
Goons also set the bar on how effective the retreat to low sec strategy works. Look at them now.
---
Feel better already lol.
---
We had just successfully anchored our keepstar in kqk and that was our victory sperg. Mumble wish sitting all over itself with a 1k people speaking all at once.
---
Almost as if we need to:
---
* Remove asset safety
---
* Remove local
---
* Make it difficult to move in to
---
* Give actual incentive to go after territory
---
Now if only there was something already implemented in the game that could be used as a template. 🤔🤔🤔
---
still much smaller then one off them,
---
Jesus christ you guys are stupid.
---
Theres a difference between rewriting the entire chat and editing like a few lines of code.
---
When Citadels were introduced, they had to compete with existing structures to win over players as a place to make their new homes. CCP had to overbuff them in order to get the structure changeover to happen.
---
Now that outposts and POSes are effectively obsolete, it's time to re-adjust. Now it's "safe" to start dialing the pillow forts back and making changes that will promote attacking over defense.
---
His info is from CSM8 and that's a bit longer ago than last years fanfest.
---
you may want to try range dscanning, it cuts down on the sites a lot faster that way
---
The time spent to get and anchor a medium structure and to kill it are dramatically different. Let's say you have group of 10 people, with 10 VNIs making 45m an hour each. They can pay for a raitaru in about an hour and a half, and anchor it the moment they bring it into their space. The same group of 10 attackers, if they can even kill a structure defended by itself and a fleet of nine, have to spend 5x that amount of time to remove the same structure if it's fueled. The asymmetry in creation and removal means that there will be an ever-increasing number of structures.   
---
A manned citadel is plenty to push off a solo or small group of hunters. To have a similar level of defense in an enormous asteroid cluster, you've gotta have another person or alt out there in a carrier or two, and those don't have the benefits of structure neuts and webs and etc. Cost-wise, medium structures cost about the same as a well-fit solo pirate BS; the former can push off a small roaming fleet no problem; the latter will die in a fire.  
---
If your friends prefer to just dock and wait than break up a camp, I dunno, get better friends?
---
yeah was wondering the same...
---
This is a really cool idea. Disables comms in that area basically. Fits in with theh lore ("they've knocked out the communications hub!"). 
---
And you could do alot of damage in 30mins. Could make it even longer I suppose, but you don't want to make it so you could perma lock it. Would need a cool down afterwards. Or else alliances would perma lock local in hostile space during campaigns.
---
it's the Caldari Modified Jump Portal Generator, please use it's proper name.
---
Oh, I do. Sometimes you just have 20 sites, 10 of which are "decent" for ratting, between 5au and 10au and you just need to get super-lucky to catch anyone.
---
I have a ton of fun in Fw space. 
---
I'm in a Corp based out of null sec but we maintain a null static wormhole for content and some of us are active  in fw space for more content as well, a across most timezones except AU, but even then I've been out with Corp mates late night west coast time plenty. 
---
You can find a group of people that fit your playstyle, you can generate content for yourself. Eve is constantly changing and I won't discount what people say about CCP ignoring certain aspects of the game, but it's always possible to find fights in null, whs and especially Fw lowsec.
---
Sounds like the Fabian strategy is working?
---
Tbh I always thought he said Pharma hax, as if he was justifying why he lost a fight
---
Failing to realise it's *all" PvP, is the answer to OP's dumb question btw.
---
This isn't normal bro trust me. Pvp is cheaper than krabbing if you do it right. This is some fuckstains ruining the market.
---
Init will do as they're told like last time.
---
PogChamp
---
I should hope so ;-). Who would stick a T2 module costing a billion friggin’ ISK on their 200.000 ISK cruiser?
---
Fixed this... :P
---
A lot of null content right now comes out of small groups living in c2-ns statics. 
---
This change gives null defenders yet another advantage since they can quickly find and scan down new sigs in their area. 
---
Hilmar talks about making space scary again, then this shit comes through immediately after.
---
I see this as a plus as Im always looking for wormholes.
---
There you go talking about things you know nothing about. It is known that the Hakonen deployment and Bigbilltheboss were the catalysts for this. He didnt want to undeploy his dreads so was killing stuff up north. He got Asher and Kun'mi interested and the rest is Reavers/Black Ops laying waste to Deklein Fade and Pure Blind. INIT showed up occasionally.
---
Most Important Change.

---
&gt; The asymmetry in creation and removal means that there will be an ever-increasing number of structures.
---
But why would that be an issue ? Of course if I buy a structure I expect attackers to spend more to destroy it than I had to spend to build it ! The issue would be if I need to pay 600M structure, and take 1d to anchor it, and an atron comes in and kill it whenever he wants.
---
But anyhow that would be the same whether there is structure spam or not. You are describing an issue you feel there is with citadels, not with citadels spam. That's a completely different issue.
---
&gt; A manned citadel is plenty to push off a solo or small group of hunters. 
---
Not the mining structures. The combat structures (citadels) can't be found where there is content to be had (anoms, gates) so who cares ? Again, this is related to citadels and not the spamming.
---
&gt; If your friends prefer to just dock and wait than break up a camp, I dunno, get better friends?
---
So much salt .
---
No
---
My thoughts are in Null citadels should droop loot when killed. Asset Safety should be disabled after shields get reinforced. Players that have not logged into the game for 60 days should be allowed to keep their assets via asset safety. 
---
Further I think that the deposit to station feature should be disabled for player with a Combat Log Off Timer in stations they cannot dock in. This would address an issue I see where someone roams into an enemy's space get s a kill with shiny loot and immediately asset safeties it back to lowsec. Leaving no chance for the persons friends to avenge the death.
---
I hope by "invasion" they mean that there will be a horde of Trig titans out there blapping player assets.
---
P much
---
Playing it safe cost you guys that fight, taking the minimum amount of risk and relying on the keepstar to keep you safe. Not considering that we might drop supers at 0 on you and the keepstar and tackle you.  Asher said we were either gonna kill that keepstar or die in a fire. What he didnt count on the lack of will to win on the other side.
---
I think you're misunderstood? He's talking about the security status of the *system* not of the user. So if you're ratting out in a system with a sec status of -0.8 local chat doesn't show the hunter entering the system for 8 seconds. If you're ratting in a system with a sec status of -0.1 he shows up after only a 1 second delay. In low and high sec he shows up immediately.
---
i really liked the trailer. i think it would have been alot better if the pilots would have sounded more serious though. the comin relief bits really took me out of it.
---
I refer you to my original comment which, it appears, means we have gone one full circle in this discussion, with people incapable of understanding how their actions and the environment change other people's actions and motivations.
---
no one because no one has 200k isk cruisers
---
then decide on what it's supposed to say. I'll be fine or It will be fine. because you know, sentence structure. but you do you man
---
If they removed local in null and fixed FW.. I would probably come back to this game. Otherwise it will just be bots and batphones online.
---
to be fair I believe there is an issue with citadels, but it's not the spam. It's the fact that attacking forces don't get a share when they kill a layer. IMO armor layer should drop materials, that need to be provided by the defenders once the structure is repaired in order to put that layer up.
---
Only 629 billion, none if which has been covered by SRP, oh and that is only 17 Delve Hours either way, so not really much of an impact yet. :)
---
probably sold to themselves or between alts
---
They decided to do some "Testing" for a few months before re-introducing the suspect timer.
---
Aka, want the t2 trig ships to settle in price before doing so.
---
no price too expensive for that sweet titan tackling nyx
---
Yeah that is a good point, why did they remove region specific resources?
---
Unlikely. They could be alpha accounts, and when they are not, they use plex.
---
Naw I’m good
---
The first step is acknowledging the problem. 
---
I haven't been properly active for a year or two, but this makes me hold out faith that coming back and continuing a subscription may be worth it.

Absolutely, the comic relief bits really killed any intensity they built.

Earlier player feedback, just look at it...
---
Having a large entity spread out in an attempt to control the rare resources might create a thin umbrella that could lead to content.
---
It depends on how it is rolled out
---
Are you?
---
Combat anomalies, ore anomalies and ice belts are the signatures that are already visible...
---
Now all the explorers can play with the big agency window obscuring the screen YAY! IMMERSION!
---
Can confirm.  I chose KarmaFleet b/c my turbo-hard-mode days are done, and the 'personnel management' of GSF is best in the game.  My isk goes far with double-SRP so I don't have to krab so much, but when I do need isk I can do anything from exploration to incursions, super ratting or wormholes with sigs/squads.
---
Best fun I ever had in EVE was being part of an 8-man rental corp that liked to fight, but that's just a higher level of time investment in the game than I'm willing to spend now.
---
tl;dr Goons is indeed ez-mode, if you want, with plenty of opportunities for hard-mode.
---
Who? Who could save us now? GotG? They'd just rammed their knife into our back in this war again. Test? They wouldn't be in a situation where they could seriously threaten goons if they hadn't sucked their dicks.
---
Because you still haven't really explained why you think it's a bad thing, you said everyone would be forced to fly VNIs, but why? They do that already. I don't see why ratters being able to warp off the second someone enters system is a good thing, can you explain to me why more ratters dying is a bad thing?
---
Capitals, no.
---
Supers and titans? Yes please.
---
I am referring to the This Is Eve video that I replied to.  Not sure if this was all the same incident or a mix.
---
&gt;Or else alliances would perma lock local in hostile space during campaigns.
---
I suppose this the balance point - but is this a bad thing? It would make actual recon a lot more important, as opposed to "+1000 1DQ"...
---
Not really. Just no houses left to burn

Haha, now I can laugh at myself. I was trying to figure out if they had removed mining sites from wormhole space because I remembered having to scan them down when I played before (when they were grav sites)...I had figured out they were visible in K-space already, but for some reason it hadn't clicked that it was the same way in w-space.
---
No. The current diplomatic situation that has teamed up both of the two biggest powers is a player decision from PL, specifically.
---
The are consequences when you put morons in leadership of major power blocs.
---
It's a start. Maybe I'll be back when ndustrialism is viable again, but more PVP is always good. More market for my ammo and small ships, and more opportunity to dip my toes into lowsec pvp in ships I've made myself.
---
I activated it yesterday on my 20mil SP account. Got the items and the skills. Couldn't use the accelerator as my pilot is older than 35 days.
---
Can confirm, that statement was made
---
I thought the small stuff fighting is what all you wormholers have been screaming needs to happen for years.
---
You're back, you "won", but stop pretending that your *public* response wasn't a thinly veiled "I'm going to sue you."

It appears so.  He has no hope of being elected, but he is a funny meme candidate.
---
Thx!
---
only a fag call others that name :o
---
Yes, but now also the amount of scannable signatures, EVERYWHERE, its no exploration now, its just scanning and hacking and having half your screen filled up with a window that nobody wants to use in this context.
---
let me say it.

---
Add local jammers that work the same way as cyno jammers
---
Its a very disappointing field of candidates in comparison to last year. The lack of small gang representatives is sorely noticed.
---
Bots aren’t a problem because they have been around forever? Tell me, has the game gotten better or worse in the last 10 years? Bots exist so they shouldn’t even try and get rid of them?

It's not about good, it's about if what they are doing is impressive.  And it isn't...at all.

Or it's what you say when you're threatened with suit so you come to an agreement to write an apology that frees up the accused from having to report himself to the state bar and then both sides to spend time and money in legal action, esp. if the accused party just agrees to resign after you apologize.

 飞袖李, Fei Xiu Li – One of the well-known Chinese capsuleer from Serenity. AFAIK, he has a very good reputation in FC-ing a small fleet battle. Here is a voice message recorded by his fleet mate (credit to this guy) during a small fleet engagement back in Serenity and this is how he got himself a funny meme “摇修老的蛋" (Translation: Rep on Li’s Capsule/balls &lt;– literally)
---
Here is my translation, it is a bit messy … Enjoy 
---
Li: 所有人进 – Everyone gate in!
---
Li: 所有人 – Everyone \*\*\*\*ing gate in!
---
Li: 所有人斯 – I SAID EVERYONE!
---
Li: 准备修飞袖李 – Prepare to rep Fei Xiu Li !

---
Would it not be cool if they were the first NPC to por pilots? Hidden message? I wish...
---
He's not entirely wrong. The game needs industry, but coordination between industry and PvP would probably be good for the game.
---
just overthrow mittens and declare end of hostilities
---
Agree
---
There were not enough people doing Abyssals so the Trig decided to come for us. This is our fault
---
Bullshite. 
---
If people wanted sunny weather they'd just move to Africa. 
---
Thats how fucking stupid that statement is. 
---
No local is just one of the things that differentiates wormholes, and as someone whose seen a lot of people move back from WHs to null/low local has literally never been mentioned, its all the logistics.
---
Learning about kicking Slyce for reporting bots in his and RR's area basically disqualifies him on a "fair player"-level. Rooting for changes regarding eve on CSM, but on the other side providing a haven for his botting friends at the very same time ...
---
&gt; Get excited when you see plans
---
Why?  CCPs put out plenty of plans that went nowhere either.
---
i cannot enjoy my game with all these nano / nullified / cloaky / logoffski fleets all day every day
---
Pap
---
Agreed ... he's in the CSM for 3 years in a row (less then Steve ofc, but more then all the others). So he must have done something right.
---
&gt;What this means for exploration? Its not exploration, its merely scanning now.
---
How has it not been that since forever? You set destination to a couple of places, follow the yellow gate and look for signatures in the probe window.
---
What's the "unknown"?
---
Its 3 coalitions get it right. Tapi + goons + garbage of the galaxy = tapirium of the galaxy only blue to 85k characters
---
My takeaway from this is that CCP clearly has a spy in TEST comms.
---
lol Jebi is the “Goonie Goon” guy now?
---
It's quite simple.  The more often ratters die, the less likely they are to rat.  Most people don't like feeding, especially in the typical manner it happens in Eve where the attacker has all the advantages.  Consuming the population of ratters with delayed local will give you a short-term boost in kills.  Medium to long term there will simply be fewer targets to shoot.  
---
This isn't difficult to understand so I'm not sure why people are having trouble with it.
---
\*Albion
---
Not knowing if you will find anything, checking each system on the way, not having to have the immersion broken by using a window that blocks out the view.
---
Exploration should be about exploration, taking in the vistas while venturing system to system, hoping to find something.
---
I’m not happy about this, surely it would make more sense for them to invade the less defended areas of lowsec to create a beachhead? 
---
Also this would actually give low sec a bit of individuality and hopefully bring in content with people coming into low from high and null to run sites.
---
The more they plex, the more people will sell it(and buy them from ccp in first place)
---
If it is not in patch notes, it does not mean the change won't come through. We'll see after deployment
---
Well, pack it up guys, this dude has spoken
---
You mean they wouldn't be in this situation if pl didn't turn on them. Shocking that test looks for allies that don't just decide well time to kill our friends.
---
Where is Steve Ronuken on your list? it is easier to vote the most unknown and incompetent player into the CSM, then to not have Steve on CSM until he says "i don't want anymore" ;)
---
I will cherish the memeories when i was a newbro doing exploration in npc venal and finding 6-7 relic sites in a single system. Bad change tbh
---
Tie entire local to gatecloak, for hunter AND hunted. That way if you stay more than D-Scan range from a gate, you're a little bit safer... But as hunter has already loaded system etc, the moment he decloaks, he can see you and you him.
---
Using your logic, every ship can be YOLOed so every ship should have consequences and cause SP loss, right ?
---
*recalling Dogs to Dog Bay*
---
You are clearly underestimating the complexity of some of these bots they have today
---
With that logic you could say people who die in pvp would stop pvping, but it is pretty obvious that isn't true.
---
These dudes only camp novices with a bait slasher and then blob you, avoid.
---
RIP Logi, always willing to lay down your ships for the fleet
---
"Goons made a bigger bolue donut then yuu haha pwnd!!!"
---
No ship should have sp loss, but the logic behind t3cs sp loss is stupid and can be applied to caps just as well. It should not be  a thing.
---
u/BBTB2 ur a god dang h4cker!!!!!
---
Well they already do in the Abyss (and Drifters were the first to start podding players anyhow, back in 2015~)
---
it’s cool man, i am cool, you are cool, he is cool,
---
everybody is cool!
---
"who brought ECM Dogs?, logi watch out for ECM Dogs"
---
"Turn on them"? MBC was never meant to last. If they had, we would have been in the same situation just two years sooner
---
Also that could open up scouting /tackle to more pilots. If 5 warp in at the same time, they get 60 seconds to decide who goes to which site and perhaps nab something. You could also pre scout local, crash gate and maybe be out before someone notices you were there. Then you can jump in the 5 dudes if you know someone's there.
---
Don't open the agency window
---
That's new to me.
---
1 we don't use slashers. Stiletto it is.
---
2 we don't camp them we warp into sites.
---
I hear NC. moved into the area lol
---
I missed the fight but I am enjoying the Eagles thus far...
---

---
Not me, i escaped your meme yesterday but you just baited. Look at your kb
---
Well i would argue evictionsare not pointless  (salt)  or invasions of undefended regions (current case not undocking).
---
This provides content both in game and on reddit, stems the boredom for us and gives us more time to get more ahead of our enemy. 
---
So no, invasions have a purpose for the ones doing the invading. I for one rejoice in burning structures, as we all know, I not so great at an actual fight, but hey no need to worry the enemy will not show up regardless.
---
&gt; The sense of unkown is gone, 
---
You don't know the type of the signature. If you fancy yourself as an explorer just because you didn't knew what signature were in a system before warping into it, you're an imaginative dude but then just go outside playing with a stick if you're getting so much from so little.
---
Lol Harpies.
---
Well without GotG, they have less bodies to throw at the enemy.. effective with them is a different issue.
---
Enjoy the immersion of the agency
---

---
thank you good sir :)

Go pvp without ammo
---
you're a fucking 10 IQ yogurt blaster.
---
Ah I understand you mean 4 ppl in fleet is a blob. When you roam around.
---
Metal only stays for a short time in sites when he warped in there where a ship to 100%before
---
There’s no reason that should surprise you.
---
&gt; NC and PL haven't left the north in 3 years defending their rental empire.
---
Ignoring 10 of the last 18 months spent in either Provi, Khanid, Syndicate or Curse.
---
4 dudes vs a t1 ship is a blob. Its bad practice. He did that for hours. Again look at kb lmao
---
Salt.  
---
What I see is an Algos pilot who was unable to clear off a T1 frigate in the time it takes a gang to jump, warp, and take an acceleration gate.
---
No, that's not the logic is it you thick cunt.  If you want to turn it around, imagine ratters are able to interrupt PvP by suddenly showing up and the PvP'ers ships exploding.  
---
There.
---
So did I. It pains me every time i hop in my titans. They just could look so much better.
---
Like i said, not me, you slasher was a pleb so i got away i just noticed you scrubs do that so will avoid your blob. Also its a max tank slasher that gets you outside the gate
---
You stalk him?
---
so.... how can the tell its a WH and not a spawned combat/data/relic.
---
Or are you just freaking out over something that wont be a problem, just like premade probe formations were turned into the devil when they changed it but everyone loves it.
---
When is this change happening ?
---
If you consider a quick glance at zkill stalking....
---
Either way the end game of it was test has no reason to be friendly to NCPL. So they became friendly with goons after NCPL repeatedly tries to kill them. Now people act confused as to why TEST has no desire to help stop goons.

Thank God. No more wasting of 30 minutes of my life per day scanning down combat sites I don't want.
---
Local is coming soon, to a wormhole near you
---
Its a Nyx-tackling Rorqual, so better watch out ;-P
---
You are correct, I don't know why you're being downvoted. As a shitter / VNI ratter if these changes were implemented I simply wouldn't rat due to the risk. My gut reaction would be to pour everything I have into my mining character and wait for moon goo operation nights.
---
It's really stupid to think that making it easier to gank ratters is going to fix anything.
---
Here's the thing, if I'm ratting I'm already at a serious disadvantage. I'm engaged with several enemies already and your ship is likely designed to counter my own as you know what my resists are. You are likely going to win if I can't escape. And that's the problem in a nutshell. It's never a fair fight. Nevermind the fact that small roams mean I'm outnumbered 3 to 1, 5 to 1, 7 to 1 plus the NPC's hitting me.
---
There is no part of ratting that encourages group play and most EVE players find it too boring to be a group activity. If you want small roams to have targets you need to change ratting to be a small gang activity so that ratters have a reason to stay and a reasonable chance to fight back. If the fights are never even close to fair, there is no point to stick around for the engagement.
---
It's ridiculously simple math. Giving every advantage to roamers isn't going to drive pvp.
---
Bought imperium membership you mran
---
make a new server xD
---
Atm it looks like we are becoming Serenity 2.0
---
I like this thought. I always hated being blapped by a cyno. But would actually go rat by myself if I thought the fight would be one on one in the hopes of getting jumped
---
Them saying it's "top of their list" makes me wonder if this is a reupload from 2009.
---
The whole anti-Goon facade was to trick Goons to meme me in for a free Iceland trip.
---
Well that's certainly not true.
---
You need a [map](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve)?
---
Does anyone actually do incursions outside of highsec though? :p
---
it's so much fun pew pewing and mining with my friends all over the world, it brings me eternal joy c:
---
help me understand how those two are related?
---
Yes because we were burning the structures
---
There have been both.  CCP fails to deliver on about 80% of everything they plan OR roadmap.
---
He's just a troll, ignore him.
---
Now now... Let's not go insulting yogurt blasters...
---
Why do you even play the game?
---
It was considered stale that groups were just fighting over the same regions all the time and that whoever held it had unfair advantage. They wanted conflict to move around more in the universe and be more dynamic. And yes people were saying that removing the biggest driver for conflict would be a mistake but here we are.
---
So rascist against renters OP. I was a renter my first time in null sec. Went there with all my high sec noob friends to get a taste for null sec. Was 2 years ago. And there were more corps like us in the area. It's not all rmt/botting
---
That's all fine. I don't mind removing local as long as long as they change cloaking as well.
---
We have had a couple of bug reports of this, these artifacts occur on some gates when graphics drivers are out of date :) give your drivers the ol' one, two, update and if it doesn't resolve the issue feel free to submit a bug report and mention me in it and I'll take a look
---
HS invasion? matter of weeks before it becomes a farmable incursion ;p
---
Yeah that's called PvP, sounds pretty fun if you ask me :)
---
I think someone posted that's how it is in game in the last week before the patch. It was snuck in without telling anyone.
---
We need all the help we can get
---
Oooof. You got schooled brah
---
Pearl Abyss wants to make the game accessible to everyone.. even autistic Goons.
---
As someone who is heavily involved in eSports and has had to deal with our Korean overlords. You underestimate the Koreans and their love of grinding.
---
This is very durrhurrdurresque to be fair
---
Are most people doing exploration sites really wanderlusting through the galaxy as you describe?  I feel like most have their route through their homespace going in circles, grinding through sites to make isk.
---
There are only 2 alliances in this game it seems. NC. and goons.
---
Simpy by the fact that anything in-between, or independent, is slurred as either of their pets anyway.
---
"top of our list...of things we won't do anything about" perhaps
---
and this is why this game is in a shit state.   CCP can promise the moon with no plans to deliver and half of the community suddenly jumps on their nuts again.  This happens over and over, no matter how many times they fail to deliver, I'm starting to think this community has brain damage.
---
tbf, the amount of enjoyment the CSM gets from the trip, I wouldn't wish it for my worst enemies.
---
Ah, a kill mark for every friendly I couldn't save :)
---
 if TAPI leadership would get out of their myopic view of the meta and politics
---
being a problem and being an existential threat are two very different things you absolute brainlet. Its literally quoted on the reply jesus christ
---
Awesome!!!!
---
Also, with how out of touch the devs are, their idea of a "Shakeup" could be introducing a supercapital rorq that mines 3x as much as current.  IT'LL BE A BIG SHAKEUP MATEY!
---
Imagine all of the terrible decisions they've made over the past few years, now imagine them going full retard on said ideas.  That's the most likely result of them trying to shake things up.
---
I dunno the avatar looks awesome

Atleast they were fighting lol. Worked out pretty well

It might be the least-stupid looking but I wouldn't call it awesome. It's literally a mushroom.

WTF does 'woke' mean. Does it mean good? If so why not use normal words
---
&gt;Reduced jam duration on Hornet EC-300, Vespa EC-600, and Wasp EC-900 to 5 seconds (was 20 seconds)
---
WHEW
---
Yes, but the year or so leading to the buyout turned it up to 10 with a very clear shift for short-term metrics.  A lot of people saw it, but we were called conspiracy theorists....until the buyout was announced.   Then it was extra clear.
---
A better analogy would probably be "Go pvp without offgrid links". Sure, you could do it, but you'd be at a disadvantage versus someone who does do it
---
Wow went the same route, now wow classic is the beez kneez because it lacks those "QOL"  features

That’s not the structures fault thats peoples fault.

You can currently do everything in 7 structures. Ppl just overkill cause its eve online and they don’t wanna get evicted.

Curious how some people see The Imperium. They’ll just give that stuff to the Chinese from serenity.
---
People did join together to handle the bully of PL/NC and now those bullies have been getting shitstomped with a victim complex.
---
So I bought a Badger to put salvage in, and I got some 'Expanded Cargohold II' and 'Medium Cargohold Optimization' I to make the hold bigger its up to 16.458 m3 now (shows in fitting and in space), but when its docked in a station it shows the original hold size of 3.900 m3, any ideas?
---
&gt;Fucking up their renter economy
---
Think we make 1b one time payment per corp that rents space in PB so... meh.
---
NC was literally preparing to jump in when the node crashed you mong.
---
THIS. I often don't want to given newer pilots the chance to be the first guy into the system on larger fleets where we have 10-12 pilots coming behind them, because then we end up missing targets and a whole fleet is out on some content. If I can coordinate jumping in and giving them a chance to get experience hunting without hurting the rest of the fleet, this is actually really helpful for teaching.
---
It's a mix, seems like a lot of it is PGL which is probably why it all sounds like 1 incident but the [Armor HACs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-kGGW0UlPA) one is pretty famous.
---
What a krab.
---
Can we camp stainguy in his station?
---
For community issues 100% pro, for anything on the game meta ... just no
---
We were suffering disconnects as well, mind you. Unless you think that we have premium access and preferential server queue positions by dint of being in the Imperium, of course. Of course, we chose to engage anyways, without the safety of tether.
---
I can imagine Hilmar in wh alone,and boost of his expirience and understanding of EVE...
---
That's just StainGuy.
---
Still, that 2% trading cost.
---
flair checks out ...
---
Yay more bashing! /s But it's a good change considering the previous situation.
---
Good video, but i’m afraid you’ll get copywrite strikes for that.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bs6mcl/citadels_idea/eok78p7/
---
&gt; Introduce a tax on the number of structures, period, per corp. to prevent groups from spamming structures as FOBs in space they don't own. That way, alliances can't just corp-tank the structure cap mentioned previously.
---
The tax per structure per system would affect alliances (if applicable), and there would be an additional tax per structure overall that would affect corporations.
---
In addition to that, throw a hard limit on structures per system and a hard limit per corp.
---
Hahaha.  Funny how many people ignore PA's only other product, it is a shitfest designed to nickle and dime their users as much as humanly possible.
---
if you want that then explore in low-class wormholes
---
Telling someone to get exited is basically telling them to get killed, or closed out of their game :p
---
Unless you meant excited, which is quite different.
---
Given that I've always despised them, and supers, I've always been vocal against them, having one would make me a huge fucking hypocrite, wouldn't you say?
---
X to doubt
---
Investors.
---
It won't help there. The combat sites it will show are the anomalies, i.e. the one you already don't need to scan down. All the signatures will still just show as signatures.
---
All people with an interest in sane ship balancing and a healthy Non-Blob-Meta should vote for stitch. He should be the follow up to suitonia.
---
Weird, I would assume people would just buy Meta or faction modules instead. Horde isn't even shy about using T1 mods if nothing else is around.
---
Expecting the different results from the same action over and over isn't glass half full, it is the definition of insanity.
---
Objectively the reason we are the best and most powerful alliance in EVE.

CCP: releases highly anticipated triglavian power creep expansion
---
Eve players: FFS CCP signatures now visible at range, literally unplayable, I'm unsubbing.
---
Yikes. I'm jaded and bitter, and don't log in much anymore, but compared to the sad existence in your mind, I'm really feeling like a peppy glass-half-full sort.
---
But valkyrie and dust both released, so simply citing them by name is a terrible example. The integration and impact of these titles was disappointing at best, but they promised VR and Dust, and we got VR and Dust.
---
I enjoyed it up until they cleared the dust cloud.  Then it started great, "o shit that's a lot of ships" after that, they missed a golden opportunity to turn the running into a high energy chase like from Independents day when they were flying through the canyon. Could been like "Overheat ur MWD let's push it guys" with lots of energy. 
---
Just the few lines and the energy of the situation after seeing the ships needed the change. Nothing else. The flow of the video and angles was perfect and amazing. 
---
I give a solid 8/10 video
---
Yeah, it's useless feature when sites are free for all and everything can vanish while you travel to it. I guess CCP are trying to give some obscure corners of space more visibility in hopes people move there. (They won't)
---
 Stain guy shits up every thread
---
i have done my first official op with my new corp and had a great time
---
I don't think this change is that bad tbh. 
---
Sure, now you know if and how much signatures are in the systems around you, but the type of the signature is still not known until you scan them. With this change you can plan your exploration-runs through k-space, which is also nice for newer players but for veterans as well. 
---
0.0 Sec could profit from this change, but i don't think it will. Even though the signatures show up on the agency, somebody still has to scan them down to know if they are whs or combat sites. Before this change somebody had to scan them down as well. People who didn't bother with scanning them down beforehand won't do it after this update and people who scanned and bookmarked everything in their region continue doing so. Nothing changes. 
---
You just aren't going to stumble upon empty systems anymore if you don't want to. Whats inside still remains a mystery until you take a look.
---
Where is the agency located? Doesn't seem particularly pertinent to know about enemy players 10 jumps from the agency, if you don't live anywhere near the agency.
---
why are you here if you’re so deeply cynical? sounds like you need to move on.
---
Should I be afraid of memory leaks? I only have 8gb ram on my potato.
---
How dare you suggest the north was incompetent, its these damn rorquals CCPLEASE
---
good ol, Jump Hics
---
that goes against the very definition they took first, which was to separate functions, and i agree with it, splitting things up opened much better options to enhance or upgrade said structures capabilities. 2nd, it also provided the ability for the attacker to hit different goals in different conditions (ie: should i attack their staging citadel? or sabotage their economic backbone?).
---
You don't need to fill the entire system with structures to use it, however in the past people DID drop 20 POSs on all moons, just to have "sovereignity control" over it. Remember the time when you contested sov with POS?.
---
Yes. There is an incursion squad in goonswarm and other null sec entities
---
yeah koreans don’t really play video games actually. maybe like 500 do.
---
why are you friends with people who play dota2?
---
&gt;I think you misunderstood?
---
Fault here is on /u/Nelthaerius for being completely vague and not giving any specification as to whether he meant system sec status or personal sec status. Given his post, it really is impossible for us to tell which he meant.
---
My point was that even that even plans and implemented projects don't automatically = gold.
---
I realize this must have been difficult for you to ascertain what with me making a relevant reply to a guy saying get excited when you see plans, hence I will refrain from calling you retarded or even implying it.
---
Inb4 wh intel bots, thanks ccp
---
It is a beta so problems are to be expected. If you are concerned about said problems, don't opt in. 
---
However, the more people that use 64 bit and report problems, the better.
---
So lets be real here, no-one can remotely oppose this, or do anything to actually ever stop them.
---
That is normal, and is the result of you looking at something giving you the base stats of the ship, and not the stats of the specific ship fit in your hanger. Your ship isn't magically loosing cargo space when it docks, unless you are re-packaging it or removing the cargo expanders from it.
---
&gt; Would need a cool down afterwards. Or else alliances would perma lock local in hostile space during campaigns.
---
I seriously fail to see why this is not a good outcome of a feature.
---
or just an OTEC cartel remember?
---
They are using the best strategy provided to them, just like the imperium did back in the casino war, and look at us now.
---
It seems pretty obvious that they are listening. Actions aren't relevant though to them listening. Reacting accordingly is not a component of listening. They can listen, and understand, and acknowledge the problems, that doesn't necessarily mean they have to then act and fix them.
---
Make the trailer funny, or make it serious/epic. Trying to do both at once is kind of weird.
---
Yep running sansha missions now
---
It's a balance for sure. Otherwise you might as well just axe local and make it J space. Even jamming a few systems half the time would be beneficial to the hostiles, while not crippling the defenders TOO much. Attackers would want to time attacks with jammed times and defenders get some respite between jams. It brings in more opportunities for sandbox play on both sides. And that's what we want.
---
Let the huntards live in their little magical world, they'll never see things clearly.
---
It might also bring some 5000 players max. To try to offer a concrete number on the MAXIMUM number of players it brings is just downright silly though.
---
&gt; and when they did, it broke them?
---
No it didn't.
---
Well, it certainly wasn't goon comms or all we'd hear is Hon Hon Hon Hom
---
A full half is a big ask, tbh. I'm happy to cruise along the 30-32% mark.
---
I love how the bloc dudes don't even bother with introductions saying, I'm already elected, why bother.
---
While this is true, asset safety has become a major aspect of K-space life, removing it would severely impact the willingness of people to move out to nullsec or other areas of K-space where NPC stations are sparse. 
---
I will not deny that we need a mechanic to reward fleets and individuals for bashing structures and removing citadels, but I think that can be done without removing asset safety. One idea that I remember and am a fan of is: increase asset recovery costs and pay the pilots on the KM according to the damage done to the structure when it dies. This would be isk neutral since you can calculate the payouts from the asset recovery cost pool.
---
See my reply below, but essentially we still need to seperate from j space. You need to be able to defend space SOMEWHAT or else people just stop caring about sov. 
---
Right now sov favours the defenders yes, but supercap blobs also make numbers matter more than tactics. You need to balance sandbox tactics on both attacking and defending sides. 
---
Don't swing hard in the other direction, because that just create the opposite problem and in 2 years null is dead because sov isn't worth it.
---
Damn, almost 1:1 titans and faxes
---
With another 1000 supers and 1300 fax's.... GG
---
Number of accounts comes with how much you want to invest yourself in this game. I started with 1 account and 1 char 
---
, got to 3 chars then 2 accounts and now I'm running 3-4 omegas and 6-7 alphas with 3 chars each. Beeing able to be anywhere and doing everything when you want it's handy but you can just play with one for a long time.
---
Accounting and Broker Relations... do they do anything for orders placed at player-owned markets, or are they strictly an NPC-moderating thing?
---
I don't understand why people think local is an issue. It isn't.
---
This idea that all space needs to be like WH is retarded. WH space is different because it's WH space. No local, no asset safety, etc.. are things that make sense for WH space because it's *meant to be different* from all other space.
---
I've been active in RvB continuously since 2011.  In those 8 years RvB has seen quite a few evolutions, changes, and moves.  The latest long-term experiment involved rules designed to keep things simple with T1 hulls only for station grids.  We did not see an increase in Forever War activity during the year that rule was in place.  In fact, it squelched what little spontaneous content was left.  Just two days ago we had an event at our arena featuring balanced fights, starting with T1 cruisers and working down to T1 frigates.  A total of 8 people showed up for the event.  
---
On the other hand, we roam Black Rise daily in loose small gang comps.  Super casual atmosphere, very inclusive with roles for newbros including tackle, logi, ewar, DPS.  We also have forays into Null Sec at least twice weekly via two entry points, one being Thera.  Players of all experience levels are always welcome to all scheduled roams.
---
And NOW we are breaking all of the molds by joining both Red Federation and Blue Republic into the Caldari side of faction warfare in Black Rise.  We had a contest for who could kill the most Gallente Militia and who could crab LP the fastest in 48 hours with a 500m ISK prize for each.  The winner farmed enough LP to buy 12 faction cruisers while also getting tons of good solo and small gang fights.  We are all very excited by this experiment and have no plans to leave FW anytime soon.  
---
The SPIRIT of providing a place for newbros to jump in and learn by doing pvp is alive and well in RvB 2019.  But way more people in RvB are interested in a variety of small-gang content in low and null than in staged high sec pvp-light.  That said, we still schedule and encourage Forever War events for the benefit of players who may be intimidated by low or null sec.   I'd love to see more of that kind of content with a return to the 20v20s of old, but there's just not a lot of interest.
---
We will always keep the flame lit for the Forever War, but our focus is on providing as much fun, casual, inclusive content as possible to as many players as possible.  I hope you drop in and join fleet!
---
You sure that's the *first* thing you want CCP to do though?
---
Word my bad
---
Try actually selecting the cargo hold of the Badger with the inventory tool, and you should see that you have 16K m^3 space in it.
---
Well, we know that CCP doesn’t much give a shit about QA from the myriad examples over the years of shit getting reported on SiSi and then pushed to TQ. (Yes I know sometimes its too late to make changes but there are examples of bugs being reported 2-3 weeks in advance of patch day. If they don’t have a validation process to adjust the patch based on relatively timely feedback, than why the fuck even bother testing).
---
So pushing bad/broken features, nothing new.
---
Specifically it gets even better with the example of local chat. It’s not even a new feature, it literally *already exists in wormhole space, live on TQ right now*. I can’t speak to their method/module formatting but the chat subsystem is probably the one place where I can confidently say they could directly copy-paste code and fix that entire problem *right now*.
---
BuT wHaT iF iT’s BrOkEn - we literally just established it as a direct feature the *CEO himself* has said is a factor in stagnation, and that breaking it is better than leaving it be.
---
Hell, if they’d done that from jump they probably would’ve had less problems migrating the chat backend in the first place last year.
---
No I did not received any email saying that my account was compromised (accessed through a different IP). This account is in fact connect with my Steam, so it is secure. Could you share some more information on what is "CCP's timeframe"? Does they live in different dimension, do the week is our year or what?
---
Mutaplasmids: Is there anything they can't do?
---
Sir, please. There is no PvP allowed in this primarily PvE orientated game. Warp disruptors and MWDs are cheating.
---
Continued harassment of ideas about making EVE more about PvP and making renters engage in PvP will be met with more nullbears creating alts and making salty posts with flimsy logic on reddit.
---
It's a show about advertising, called 'Under the Influence', and it is surprisingly interesting with similar stories:
---
https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/mobile/arts-culture/under-the-influence/
---
I guess it was [S08E21 - Brand Envy](https://podcast-a.akamaihd.net/mp3/podcasts/undertheinfluence-Znohr2j3-20190522.mp3)
---
This is way more complicated than the pro removal folks think. 
---
People aren't interested in having all their shit go poof while they are offline, on vacation etc.
---
&gt;nology that is str
---
Or Neural remapping...
---
I think he meant system truesec but messed up?
---
Eve didn’t have asset safety for ages because it didn’t have citadels fo ages, it had indestructible NPC stations. Now those are gone from sov null, so there’s no equivalent to what we had pre-citadels.
---
Hi guys I'm a "journalist" trying to goad you in to welping years of accumulated supers and titans with my half ass attempt to prod and pretend n+1 doesnt exist.
---
Honestly they should just welp all their titans super fleet to goons (not faggot rebrand emporium) so goons lose their foil and source of any propaganda they have.
---
If NC and pl did welp their accumulated assets it would be the best way to defeat gsf.  Eventually they'll get bored and shit on test too then we will see the same shit cycle of 3rd tier gsf propaganda recycled on reddit again.
---
Fuck off op. Nobody is buying your shit post.
---
Signed- someone who hates all null sec entities who has NO bias
---
Gold Caviar?... Smells like Gold Piss tbqh.
---
How else is he gonna complain about it? Full time activist on reddit and in-game.
---
Completely useless kikimora nerf, CCP style
---
CSM's been overly stacked for risk averse null blocs forever now. CCP at \_least\_ needs to consider that.
---
The hardcore base doesn't relate well to casuals. That's one of the main reasons why harsh mechanics like no chat are being proposed in places they dont belong.
---
Besides, local isnt what has made nul crap.
---
I’ve been wondering is Stainguy with goons?
---
I found a picture of an abandoned Minmatar sentry dog: [https://previews.123rf.com/images/nikita201/nikita2011707/nikita201170700014/82174799-strange-dog-sculpture-made-of-scrap-metal.jpg](https://previews.123rf.com/images/nikita201/nikita2011707/nikita201170700014/82174799-strange-dog-sculpture-made-of-scrap-metal.jpg)
---
That's a reply typical of 5yo.
---
Maybe the Reddit community here is really retarded if someone thinks this halfwit's proposal is good.
---
Yeah, I want sure about the "play" as well, I much prefer immersion, and that definitely broke the wall
---
Thanks all of you for commenting. I appreciate those of you who tried to help as well as all bitter insults and trash talk, as we all know that no one was ever falesly banned.
---
My goal was to get attention of actuall CCP support members who claim to lurk in reddit, so let me try summon u/CCP_Peligro. Could you be so kind and have a look at my case? In fact you are the one who banned me. I truly belive a short explanation wouldn't kill you.  Especially as I'm pretty sure I did nothing for what I could be banned.
---
Its very interesting that groups now believe they can retreat and rebuild.  I have to ask myself and others if theres any truth in that,  as my scepticism kicks in.    
---
The biggest blow and worst type of blow for Eve is being demoralized.  So i ask;   if you build a sandcastle and every year in December,  winter is coming from Delve,  your sandcastle will need rebuilding, and the entire region is reset,  will people endure that gameplay?    
---
As i recall,  in Serenity server the Mangos (the chinese dominant super/titan alliance) hellcamped the remaining free folk.     
---
Realisticly fights resulted in subcaps vs subcaps,   with few capital support on the smaller group (less kills).  Im all for breaking up Alliances and introducing new groups btw,   i think the diplomatic/bad leadership choises should have caused alliance restructuring more than these decade old alliances we have now,  where some leadership doesnt play eve anymore,  or takes yearly breaks.   
---
Quite possibly we can simply now create a nullsec RvB alliance and blab eachothers ships for fun,  but without real lasting deep wounds..   
---
So realisticly we can all just join Test and Goons and play this way..  or accept the Winter thats coming.
---
 CCP: We don't actually play this game, nor we accept opinions form those who do. So get rekt I guess.
---
Exactly, local isn't what has made null crap.
---
My group of 20 has no problem finding content. We have roams almost every day and most of the time we find good fights.
---
.. and we have local. Clearly it isn't the problem then, right?
---
It's something else. Something else needs to change.
---
1.  \&gt;  These dudes only camp novices with a bait slasher and then blob you, avoid. 
---
2. &lt;pastes killmail for an Algos caught on a gate&gt;
---
Pick one?  
---
Also, can you post your killboard?  I'd like to see what you consider best practices for small gang pvp.
---
Maybe make them only placable on gate grids?
---
So if your system has 5 gates, you need 5 deployables to give your system local coverage from all entry points. If you dont have one down, you get a delay. If you have one down on a gate, then people can blow it up or alternatively, hack it to knock it out of commission for maybe an hour? It would allow covert ops frigs a role as a way to disrupt their local network before you move a gang through.
---
hilmar talks the talk but often times cant walk the walk
---
OK assuming that Hilmar's Generals will be given marching orders to achieve this and that he will hold them accountable in the future - which CSM candidates are most likely, if elected, to influence and cajole the Devs to bring finished game solutions, to make his words and aspirations a reality on TQ?
---
BTW - Get behind Hilmar while he is there, his exit clause from the sale of the Company may run down in two years time.
---
I am looking at the blue bar along the top saying how much space is left, I am in the ship now and it shows 2,645/16,458 m3 spaced used, when I leave the ship and get into my VNI, I look at the badger in the inventory menu the blue bar shows 2,654/3,900m3 and will not let me put anything larger than the remaining space of 1,246m3.
---
He's a nice shitposter.
---
There are more people in goon so statistically there are more shitposter. So it looks like he is with goon butactually he is a sansha agent in disguise.
---
Fabian Strategy
---
Thats rich coming from a  daytripper.
---
ye of little intellect....!
---
Here is the argument:
---
1) Every "major war" has to include people contesting capital forces of the entity with the largest capital force (else you leave out over half the titans in this game)
---
2) Nobody will contest against capital forces of the entity with the largest capital force (given the distribution of forces atm).
---
Therefore, no major wars.
---
For [combat sites](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#Cosmic_signatures), ship choice depends on the site. A Gila handles anything you'll find in highsec, I think.
---
A real popular thing in null right now is a VNI something like this:
---
    [Vexor Navy Issue, Angel Anoms]
---
    Damage Control II
---
    Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
    Medium Armor Repairer II
---
    Reactive Armor Hardener
---
    100MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner
---
    Large Compact Pb-Acid Cap Battery
---
    Denny Enduring Omnidirectional Tracking Link,Tracking Speed Script
---
    Omnidirectional Tracking Link II,Tracking Speed Script
---
    Auto Targeting System I
---
    Drone Link Augmentor I
---
    Medium Ancillary Current Router I
---
    Medium Capacitor Control Circuit I
---
    Warrior II x5
---
    Valkyrie II x5
---
    Berserker II x5
---
For higher-level DED sites in null, I think people mostly use Rattlesnakes. The VNI above should handle just about any anom except the havens and sanctums.
---
He’s great haha, I love how sometimes he actually posts something serious and people still don’t take him seriously 😂
---
I think the point he was making is that not using the Agency would be gimping yourself unnecessarily, because you would be at a disadvantage to other explorers who do use it. Why risk wasting your time visiting empty systems while other explorers will be going straight to the good stuff?
---
This exactly, I live in null and my safety increases with this mechanic, but i dont like it one bit.
---
Welcome to USTZ facwar
---
That's part of the major flaw with Star Citizen. Reading the comment you replied to, these are his theories, and not confirmed or denied by SC. Everything that have envisioned for the game is from an ATV or RTV episode from like 2015, and is all verbal. The road map shows basic features that are on iteration 2 or 3, but nothing ground breaking.
---
The game has so much potential, but lacks any sort of substinance. I do believe the SC community is to blaim for much of it. Most of the interest appears to be for playing the ship hanger meta game and bragging about how much RL money they dropped. I see more posts about atmospheric entries or "gib" &lt;ship that isn't released&gt; than I do about the progress of server meshing or additional game play mechanics.
---
Its disappointing, but I wish they limited or defined their scope. Perhaps even just have one solar system, and then have DLC systems later on. It's such a massive game with absolutely no scope.
---
Or have local be an actual structure that can be scanned down, and hacked/destroyed.
---
Hm, no dubstep this time...
---
Yeah but its like they talk by the air...
---
Then dont keep all your shit in null sec. Wormholes figured out that amazing concept years ago. Asset safety is a complete joke. Takes all the risk out of the game in the name of convenience and golden parachutes.
---
This trailer is really well done from a cinematography standpoint. Breaking the immersion doesn't bother me as much. The one thing that does bother me is how the ships are avoiding being hit by flying like the player is controlling the ship with a joystick and the ships spinning out of control. Ccp, joystick support when?
---
* The amount of Anomalies and Signatures in a K-Space system is now visible from anywhere.
---
are they fucking retarded???!!
---
Pve in a nut shell from veterans to newbe players.
---
Yes but is like they talk by air
---
It’s been a while since I bought one of those. I forget what they cost.
---
I think it was just the right amount of cringe.
---
Markets charge two kinds of tax: NPC sales tax and brokers fees. The only difference between Upwell markets and traditional station markets is that the brokers fee is set and collected by a player entity in the Upwells. The NPC sales tax remains the same. So Accounting is still worth having, but you can skip Broker Relations since it won't apply to non-NPC brokers fees.
---
Too bad, i got exited for a moment there :(
---
in this case, there are talking about FOB response fleet that spawns when a fob hauler ( a NPC whose name starts with a diamond )notices ennemy players on grid.
---
This reponse fleet contains several types of player-like ships, with lots of ewar and scales with the fleet on grid.
---
Can agency info be pulled from the ESI? If it can, then what is to stop a group from essentially mapping the signatures of a region? If spawns work like I think they do (when on de-spawns it immediately re-spawns somewhere else), then you could figure out what each sig is, and watch for whatever spawns when that sig disperses. Over time you could figure out exactly what each sig is, and track where it moves as it gets run or de-spawns from time. Sig ID's don't change with DT so that isn't an issue, and it would let a group with the correct tool be able to chain things like DED sites without needing to waste any time hunting for them.
---
I may be the party pooper here but that dialogue is just cringy.
---
Ok so you cant keep some of your savings in high sec or liquid isk? The entire game has to go downhill and remove the risk reward of operating in "dangerous space"?
---
People kept things in poses before citadels and they were huge conflict drivers. Citadels are just better versions of poses. So please enlighten me on why asset safety is necessary except to retain care bears cause that's all it does.
---
I do. I use Thera wormhole to go where a connection is open to null and just wander around hacking relic and data sites and use Thera to leave.
---
This looks shopped, I am an expert.
---
I recall Co2 putting up a lot of good fights last time, even if they were losing a lot. That's who we, INIT, engaged with the most often. Partly because they showed up to fight the most and partly because they aligned with similar numbers to our fleets and our FCs indicated it would be the best fights rather than dunks or blue balls. I also recall the first half being more back and forth struggle but by the 2nd timer on x47 it was becoming very clearly one sided as the armor timer was beat and USTZ people poured into the fight it was decided with absolution by numbers and the north running into double resist wall titans catching reps and not getting the kills with their volleys in return for the south getting kills. Before that specific turning of the tide, I would say it was a slow degrading slide and loss rather than all out route. After that armor fight, it felt like it became an inexorable advance. Not having Co2 or Darkness people to show up and fight this time will have an impact, but I won't prognosticate on the level or manner of impact.
---
you guys … &lt;3
---
Part of that is because your skills are no longer effecting the ship, but it appears that mods aren't either. Ship skills alone wouldn't create such a discrepancy. That is weird.
---
But the titan numbers, in x47, with the keepstar timer!
---
But if youre exploring for the sake of exploring, why are you competing with anyone :D
---
You can move your corp to Providence and use the space you just have to abide by the NRDS rules.
---
&gt;takes no risks  
---
&gt;looses first molok in the game to a disconnect
---
this is quite the improvement over wars and the agency is starting to get into shape.
---
Dont wanna risk your shit?  Dont move to dangerous space then. The only thing you are arguing is null shohld be more like high sec. 
---
They already have high sec.. so be smart and move assets out periodically.
---
I've had all my nice shit killed in w space 4 times (I fought with underdogs what can I say) the losses became less and less every time when I only kept what I needed where it was needed.
---
It was a little discouraging but I got over it. Done fly what you cant afford to lose right? Then dont store all your shit in a treasure chest in a place it can get killed. Null sec flourished for many many years without asset safety
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

He didn't say they were doing it well...
---
Agreed, protoss for life
---
Yes, when I got back from 2008 I had Gallente battleship IV without having had trained Battlecruser at all.
---
At this point you need to be a vet just to understand what offgrid links are. You are aware that this are not a thing anymore, right?
---
Instead of Eve crashing in large fights at 4ish GB, it'll crash at 8 GB.  So there's that.

I hope all the VoC guys in molden heath remember all the honorable feeds (content) i provided during my stay in their lowsec home. In case you didnt know, everyone and thing in lowsec molden heath is a VoC alt ready to drop on you. That 3 day old newbie? VoC tengu. The nullsec guy who just jumped in from LX4 into Skarkon, VoC alt.

nice, another year where we decide who is allowed to make vacation in iceland...... thats for nothing else, right???
---
Am I missing something? It only shows anomalies right? So Havens and the like. But relics, data and DED are not anomalies so they will not show? Does not sound to me it will say DED 6/10 or standard sleeper cache in system X. Anomalies I don't love being shown but not world ending
---
need something to do while bashing structures
---
No. The number of sellers (and the amount) seems quite constant.
---
If you really believe in your logic, 100% bots would be the best ever, wouldnt it?
---
Nice story, completely wrong.
---
Yeah I fucked up with being vague cause I was tired. I edited it, I meant the sec status of the systems.
---
It wasn’t. Sorry.
---
Compayn &amp; Blood Ruin both running for CSM.
---
YEET. Good luck dudes.
---
cant wait to get out in the cloaky sabre and wait right outside the system where a sig despawned... free intel \o/
---
There is more than one reason you'd want to keep defenders from getting help in. Our goal was to kill the fort.
---
To that end, letting everyone and they're sister in wouldn't have been beneficial. Hole control during an op like that is both normal and crucial.  
---
[Our Tatara that was destroyed](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76587593/). When Sleeper Dreams killed this they didn't leave the holes open for whoever to wander in, they held hole control for the time needed to complete the task. (Expertly so, as I observed).  
---
Once the structure was down, they gathered their loot and left. This is a good example of what we thought we were going into. Except intel said Buccs had fairly strong defenses on the fort, so we planned for that, as well.
---
so your solution wold be that PANFAM blued all of eve to beat goons? whats the point? there wouldn't be any  more content for anyone
---
True but they've done this in all EVE ads
---
they do invest in the local economy though.
---
I think that settles it then, not a goon, they never take reddit seriously. Although I too want justice for the stain gate.
---
Yea just Chang it to “fly”.
---
Thanks. How about markets in player structures in sov null? Is there NPC tax there? What NPCs would collect it?

On an unrelated note, John Wick Parabellum was a fucking amazing experience, jesus christ.

Also in case anyone wants to have a chat we have a public discord now! https://discord.gg/SyNZx27

Can it reach 8gb?

I dont think

So riled up you cannot even tell that dscan is fake.
---
"How does the pod know what lasers sound like? Maybe what I think they sound like really sounds like hybrids."
---
&gt; The game has so much potential
---
I fully agree. It looks awesome. You’d have to be stupid to say anything different. But that doesn’t make it a game.
---
I’ve said, a few years ago now, that they showed an alarming tendency to add on new features they were going to incorporate, with ever increasing seed money.
---
That’s a profound mistake on the part of the designers. What they wanted to do is to make a feature list that they wanted in the game, build those features into a functioning game and, because they have all that money, add blocks of new features as they were developed and relased. That way the eager player base has a game to play, in the mean time CIG are constantly iterating on the product.
---
As time goes by and more features become available and, very important, when they learn what works and what doesn’t work, they can then decide what direction to go into. Just because it’s shiny and you can build it, doesn’t make it a great idea.
---
What have they done? They have said: it’s going to be great, it’s going to be perfect. We’re just going to build this new feature on top of what we already have. Trust us, once it’s fully integrated, it’s going to be awesome. And then they add yet another feature to it. More complexity, more integration problems. Now you have stability issues, things that need to fit the narrative of the game. It becomes a huge mess.
---
It is telling that you call something the ‘ship hangar meta game’ where people brag about the cool ships they bought. That they then can’t do anything with because the environment doesn’t allow for exploring features, seeing what works, what doesn’t what breaks, where it breaks, how it breaks and why it breaks.
---
The hangar queens forget that they are not building the narrative of what their shared dream should be delivering. In EVE Online I get to share stories with people about things that actually happened to me. My story is not the most heroic, but it is my story. I was there. I was in the moment where my hands were shaking so badly that I could hardly click on the control feature to make my escape. That’s my story, that’s my lived experience.
---
Star Citizen has not delivered on that at all.
---
- First you say what you’re going to make
---
- Then you build that set of features
---
- Then you give it to your players
---
- Then you listen to them as they moan and gripe about stuff that doesn’t work well
---
- Then you repair that
---
- In the mean time you build the next set of features
---
- Go back to the top of the stack
---
As soon as people have stories to tell about the things they did, then you have a game. Then your universe comes to life.
---
For the money they got and the time they had it’s disheartening how little they have to show for it. I’m reading ‘testing basic game loops’. I’m not impressed. Your paying customer is asked to serve as the alpha tester of features that are not ready to be released in... how much time?
---
I see they spent a lot of money making it look nice. And then they have extremely questionable design features such as requiring multiple crew mates to fly in the same ship, which I find highly questionable. Not for the people who’ve been waiting for that for years. They have that message internalised. But new people, who come to check that out, they won’t want to do that. They will want to own and fly their own ship, not ride along with someone. That’s years of design effort wasted for no return. That’s focusing on the wrong thing when the right thing would be to give you guys something you can take into space and then kick your ass out of the space dock to go and do it already.
---
So much wonderful potential, so much waste.
---
From internal reports, it sound like Incarna came VERY VERY close to killing CCP.  At that time, the playerbase was larger and had much more goodwill towards CCP than now.  If they pulled that shit today, they wouldn't recover.
---
i actually disagree with this.
---
i think they should tie local to a structure. the caveat being that by having this structure caps your ADM to 2 or 3 across the board. you cant get high end combat sites, anoms, or mining sites if you have local. if you want to make good money, you have to do it with risk. want significantly less risk? make significantly less money.
---
How is dropping against a fully defended enemy Keepstar in EUTZ with relatively even numbers at first not taking a risk?
---
About the cap batteries, one of the main considerations is what it does for your cap recharge rate. Because it increases the size of you cap pool without increasing the time to full recharge, it effectively increases the recharge rate. They also confer some resistance to cap draining attacks.
---
I think the typical use case is to fit an oversize one on a PVE ship. Like for example the [PVE VNI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bs2pgr/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_may_23/) I just posted elsethread.
---
can they find me a gf ?
---
Dunk - Brave has the votes to get somebody on.
---
Battlecruiser was once a skill that was not split into races, it was just "battlecruiser", so you probably had that one trained before it was split
---
"Stalking all these posts" because I just read a comment about it on an EVE fb post and wanted to see what the fuss was about.
---
Why are **you** paying attention to 'em a month later?
---
itt lots of ccp handles (✿◠‿◠)
---
Woof. You’re scaring me kid.
---
&gt; *Combat Anomalies, Ore Anomalies, and Ice Belts show the exact type of site from within 1 jump away. At 2 jumps or further, only the existence of the site is shown.*  
---
Not too much of a problem. Although I expect relic sites to be stomped within minutes of spawning.
---
Naw... 1 week to become just another farm, 3 weeks for “elite” groups to form that will only accept you if your ship is worth 14 billion ISK
---
Also FOCUS BITE
---
So many upvotable comments in this thread.
---
I loled
---
This is pretty funny not gonna lie.
---
I did that the very first time I got in a Rorqual on accident and even had launched my drones. Thank god there wasn't anyone nearby to take advantage of it.
---
fax numbers are a little weak.
---
&gt; *Fixed an issue where Sisters of EVE Advanced Combat suits were not appearing in the market.*  
---
Sister of Eve Analysis Coats had previously only been sellable on contracts, but the buttons at the bottom disappeared. You need AK points to purchase them from the LP store.
---
Given the intent and context I think the intended meaning is pretty obvious though.
---
Yes, I agree.  There should always be the option to do a scorched earth style raid where you simply destroy everything and then fuck off without having to spend a week grinding repeated timers for every damn structure in the system.
---
And you know what, sure goons, PL and NC can take advantage of that, just like they can take advantage of just about any system you could think of but this way so can everyone else
---
This is pretty fucked up for wormholes, but I don't think CCP cares.
---
Yes. Everyone go farm K-space sites! No way hunters could use this mechanic.
---
&gt;Bpo when ccp
---
I'm sure PL already has em.
---
was it placed in wrong position? NO
---
IMHO CCP should make the game more realistic.
---
* Mining and anomalies shouldn't be static. Should degrade with heavy use.
---
* System security shouldn't be static.  Should improve with heavy occupation and use.
---
* Moon content shouldn't be static.  Should degrade and reveal new material after prolonged period of mining.
---
* Communications shouldn't be 100% reliable.  
---
* Collisions.
---
Yeah I know, was the best analogy I could think of though
---
Amen. Ladies and gents this is our new CEO
---
Hi there, small gang representative here. There are a few of us, some also backing WH/LS/FW. Cable Uta and Insideous Sainthood are the 2 off the top of my head that are smallgang/WH/LS focused.
---
Caldari Battlecruiser 3 is a requirement for Battleship skill now.
---
I swear, sometimes it seems like you could walk across Delve by stepping from one citadel to another. Other than the marketplace in 1DQ, I think the average occupancy of each structure is about 1.
---
I tried to pick at the source of  [https://www.eveonline.com/ccplease](https://www.eveonline.com/ccplease), but I not good at that, but you could block all the text and other elements, go full screen and take a screen shot.
---
Yeah, even I can't find some twisted, disingenuous justification for this. What is CCP even thinking?
---
No, but they can give your sexuality +20 gay
---
Yes but when they done balancing years ago, if you could fly battleships or command ships without the new required skills then you could still do so without need the new skills.
---
its a good thing
---
its a good thing, now not just aimlessly roaming hoping to find an anomaly
---
This is the most detailed and accurate accounting of mainfleet comms on record.
---
Thats more of a "how do you define an eviction" kind of thing, hitting a target of oppotunity in chain and controlling the holes for like a day to hit like a already reffed structure etc is just yolo bashing for money. Any sort of planned hit on main structures like forts is eviction territory, like killing the main forts of a wh corp will severely cripple the group to the point of they might aswell move out, expecially in low class due to caps not being able to jump out. 
---
I know the roll tbh, we have left a rait and not completely evicted someone in the past, but it's pretty much still an eviction. The people we hit sure felt evicted afterwards. Like saying "it's just for the loot" doesn't change the fact that you strip those assets from the people living there and removing their main structures to do so. 
---
I do get that perception is important tho, and i have tried that kind of "please come to this loot bash" to then get roped into running the entire eviction and have like 3 people from the actual group wanting it being there.
---
this is ... beautiful!
---
Knocks NC for being unorganized and lacking foresight.  
---
Knocks goons for being organized and having foresight.

new feature: tracking speed reduction and explosion radius increase based on in-game iq test
---
That's what gatecloak is. If you break cloak early, you don't get the full 60 seconds.
---
I feel like you were channeling me in this post and i love it.
---
A do over I honestly wouldn't mind, even if I had to build up all my skills again.
---
Well you can still "find" them ... by looking into your agency window ... :D
---
We reshipped and reformed in less than 5 minutes. One of this "already replaced" moments. Second pass through we demolished everything in our path. So yes we were knocked to the mat, got up before the count, and won the match. In addition  we accomplished our larger mission which was to keep the focus on us and off the other fleet which worked. 10/10 would be distracting meat shield again.
---
Cable/Chori got vetod by CCP
---
I have also heard the idea of having people up in local but have them show up as unknown pilot with no standings until they break cloak and the gate confirms they identification. People still get to see when someone comes into a system but can no longer instantly determine friend or foe.
---
Oh, Rip. I heard about another, but didnt hear about cable.
---
For someone pretty critical of the event, you sure have no clue what it was about.
---
The event was commemorating each year of eve. Most of the days had a reward commemorating something that happened the year related to the day.
---
So... Technically it did.
---
I don't even understand why anyone would think this is a good idea... I mean, we know they don't play the game, but c'mon! This has "retarded idea" written all over it!
---
&gt; cornerstone of your argument
---
I don't follow which screenshots people share online are fake. If you disagree with the idea of Goons having at least about 750-900 titans deployed, then GTFO here, because they do. If you don't, GTFO as well, because I can use that in my argument.
---
Shows how many sigs.
---
The real exploration has always been in wormholes anyway. Man up and jump through some hisec wormholes.
---
I need this soundtrack without the dialog. I can't shake that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8WQTj7iEBw basically has inspired this.
---
PUB DISCORD LETS GO
---
&gt;so be smart and move assets out periodically.
---
lol - many of those who think this way have no idea what this means. I would agree, if it would be possible to not only compress ore and ice, but all the other materials too, like hevy water, stront, T2- components.
---
It's not so easy for an industrialist to "move assets out periodically", when there are 20M m³ of stuff in the production hangar - and 20M m³ really is not very much if you produce Titans or supers ....
---
I like the idea personally. Capitals are broken across the board they should cost more to lose than a well fit faction cruiser.
---
Long term, however, it opens up a lot more options for them like the ability to finally drop support for clients that, frankly, shouldn't still be used by anyone... like, I get it, you don't have money, but you can get a computer tower for 150$ that will beat the crap out of that 10 year old gaming PC.
---
You should do one of the iRacing 24h LeMans races with that. :P
---
It would.  But of course I didn't know whether or not you had which is why I asked the question.
---
Just here to remind everyone that the ex csm member now winning the game confirmed hilmar doesn't know shit about eve or even the status of most of what he just spoke on. 
---
Pre-scripted by someone else. Those ideas are fucking awful.
---
FFFFFFFFFFFF
---
FFF
---
FFFFFFFF
---
Well, the answer is no.
---
when typing out a post in the box it gives you, check the lower right hand corner of the box, you'll see "content policy" and "formatting help", click formatting help for a list of cool shit you can do in your post to do things like italics, bold, and quoting among other things.
---
Bingo. 
---
Everyone forgets that so quick. Also the ex CSM member now winning the game who confirmed that he doesn't know a damn thing about the state of EvE politics... Much less the actual technical aspects...
---
This is just lip service to keep a dwindling fan base "appeased" and on the hook. Not to mention the ideas presented are terrible and not even remotely fleshed out. (nor are they his own)
---
Yet this thread is FULL of people with too much cum in their eyes to see the reality.
---
As if that's a unique trait.
---
If you look in settings and then shortcuts then drones there’s a recall drones shortcut you can add. 
---
Personally I use space at to launch drones, and shift-space to recall drones. But a lot of people use space for d-scam instead of v, so up to your preference
---
I love the "drop 10% of all assets" instead of charging some random fee. Net outcome is the same for the defender, but incentivizes attackers.
---
I never said it was good or not. I just commented on your handle tbf. If you wanna cry about about it by all means, but I ran out of tissues wiping away Golden Piss Caviar off my bumper. Sorry, not sorry.
---
There's 9 things in that nearby system
---
What are they?
---
*Go find out stupid*
---
Yeah but you still show in local as soon as you jump. So you might as well not even be cloaked. They know exactly where you are and the bubble is up. 
---
60s gives you a chance to make some decisions before being seen. The only way they know someone is there is if they saw the gate actually activate.
---
Yeh go PvP in a T1 fit Rupture vs HACs.
---
Might be a decent one.
---
I laughed pretty hard at that br
---
Eh, I didn't enjoy it as a new player. It honestly felt like I was just fresh-blood fodder to throw into someone else's fun. The high membership numbers felt impersonal, a 180 from the "take you under our wing" mentality that sold me on it in the first place. I was promised being trained and ended up losing a ship over it and wasted travel time.
---
The skybox in PB really is incredible
---
I want to do abyssal site in gila. What skills should I train for max efficency and survival and dps of course.
---
I agree completely on the first three but have to think about the last two. What do you mean by "Collisions"?
---
I did as well, glad I went with my Dread instead of Herpies
---
"  why WOW players want to go back to classic. " execlty
---
Never said blue said non-invasion pact ae combat over space and resources isn’t happening. The combat effects ratting incomes, moon mining, ore/ice, loot and fac/dead space drops. That isn’t happening and to top that off the two largest groups only roam and Occasionally fight over structures but more for content than actual combat. That’s bad for the game, look at 05-08 and see how many people and various groups and coalitions at that time. Now look at today, it’s like 5 groups maybe with 2 not fighting for real and the other three sorta but not also doing the same thing but with people that hate each other in those groups as well like Dark and PH.
---
True :) I guess there has to be some sort of carrot/stick incentive though. There's only so many skyboxes you can see before the novelty wears off.
---
Well thing is it requires the ability to defend structures and whatnot. It's not s coincidence that titans have become sub caps for big alliances after asset safety was introduced.
---
Granted it can help the little guy but we arent really seeing it help the little guy. 
---
I mean its just non sensical to have a "no security space" with an asset safety net.
---
Also keep in mind lack of asset safety creates true rivalries. The most dedicated myself and the organizations I flew with ever were was when we were evicted...lost 100s of billions of isk and were forced to rebuild.
---
We legitimately had real enemies as a result. Not fabricated propaganda enemies and we wanted them to suffer. Why do you think eve had such joy when hardknocks was evicted?
---
That was 10x more captivating than these "keep the content for our line members" fabricated wars that plague null sec.
---
Poses building titans were huge flashpoints for actual engagements..and titans meant something... because you actually lost the effort you put in.
---
Why must you always assume the worst? Here they are giving you free rats to kill which could contain pretty good loot drops. The proper response is thank you for these awesome gifts we are about to receive. Thank you.
---
Maybe if NC/PL were such \~\~elite pvpers\~\~ who couldn't possibly lower themselves to allowing \~\~stupid newbies\~\~ in their alliances they'd have a few more people.
---
But they choose not to, so they don't get to complain about numbers.
---
It's not really is it because it's not a contest.  It's you sitting there and then your ship exploding which I'm pretty sure would make you rush to reddit to cry like a little girl in a pink frilly dress, with ribbons in your pig tails, about how unfair it all is.
---
Dark, NC. and Frat and all the little groups are the other croissant or donut. Used to be like 10 coalitions back in the day and that was fun. Sadly all things new become not new and people figure out every little trick and it starts to make the game bland.
---
It being over 2b and having grown endlessly since it came out is what most people are upset about. Some people are retarded sure but lmao.
---
&gt;exectly 
---
WOW called, they want you back
---
Does it affect wormholes? I assume it wouldn’t.
---
By default the Recall command should be Shift R.
---
Also, the game should automatically send that same command if you initiate warp while your drones still deployed. But it doesn't wait for them, it just sends the recall. So if they're close enough then they'll dock up. If they're too far away, they'll be left behind.
---
wouldn't this just do nothing for wormholes?
---
It effects the use of wormholes as a method by which to attack players in k-space. Since K-space players will receive a notification of a new signature at a distance, they can effectively canvass a wide area and known exactly when holes spawn (or at least know when to scan them on an alt to determine if they're a security risk.)
---
... Definitely used for different things bud.
---
If you didn't treat them like shit and abandon them at the drop of a hat they would be loyal and follow you anywhere. 
---
Honestly, some people...
---
That was before my time in rvb. Now we are a smaller family and everybody counts as independent pilot
---
Pretty sure CCP views this as a feature, not a bug.
---
[WHY DO I KEEP HAVING TO FIX THESE FOR YOU?](https://i.imgur.com/opdMzbn.png)
---
Make sure you imported your skills to Pyfa. And make sure it doesn't think you have extra implants or boosters or something aiding you.
---
If you had actually come to Delve with us to finish off goons, instead of deciding to invade us, then yes, you would be in a lot better shape. Instead you sat at home circlejerking while goons rebuilt to a situation better than ever before. You made this bed, and now you sleep in it.
---
I kinda like that I can keep track of NEW sigs appearing nearby when before I never took a second pass at each system for new sigs.
---
Its not the only reason for sure.
---
This can only end well :D
---
Upvoted, liked, subscribed, bell rung, comment below!
---
These monthly public fleets are dope yo
---
/u/querns_gsf has a pretty good reply on it (never thought I'd say this!) above
---
it makes it even easier for nullbloc people to find the WH you came out of and start rolling it right away
---
This was three days ago.
---
Ya on somethings ccp will super quick respond on other things it can take months. You could always go to iceland and take a tour of the offices and bring it up then might go faster.
---
They literally did exactly that, that was WWB. The problem was Panfam gave up on WWB the moment goons left the north, and allowed the CFC to rebuild instead of pursuing them south with us. All they needed to do was have the endurance for a few more weeks but they gave up instead.
---
I dont think anyone finds a wormhole 2 systems over and decides its a bad day to krab because of it.
---
It actually started with dronelands but now is rorquals/skill injectors.
---
They'll probably sort this out at the same time they sort out ECM and it's related ships.
---
Get excited when you can walk in station
---
Because you can see it spawned so you go check it out. Easy.
---
We aren't 180 ppl more like 20 active a day?
---
You are right, but then actual real players that aren't bots will start resubbing, leading to a Eve renaissance of sorts. Real players creating content lead to more people following them. Eve is about enabling content creators and not pandering to the solo null bears and bots.
---
I don't remember the time I actually complained about anything in the sub. :)
---
Ah yeah, the comment above can be seen as a sarcastic one, but it is not.
---
Nullsec &gt; HighSec
---
Poor, forgotten dogs
---
no they didn't. MBC was made to get rid of the goons from the north, not farm them until their last member left. Everyone knew as soon as goons were gone they would go back to shooting each other again. 
---
No one wants to follow a alliance around and farm it to death. Think of how burnt out the fcs were after all that grinding, do you think any of them were up to more weeks of grinding? Ask any of the lead fcs in WWB why they didn't follow goons and you will get that answer. and you do realize that if they did that PANFAM would be where goons are now and go around the map with 1.5k titans fucking everyone over? This is CCPs fault, not PANFAM, Goons or any other entity
---
Everyone quit because the game is shit now
---
Forgive him, he lives in the drone lands where 2 weeks of not seeing another person let alone another blue actually happens 😂
---
Want to go find out what's in a system? Travel there and scan shit down.
---
Are you a hunter? See a nice system with many cosmic signatures? Set up a trap on the way there or at the valuable sites.
---
Win-Win, carrot &amp; stick achieved.
---
&gt;So yes we were knocked to the mat, got up before the count, and won the title.
---
lol
---
See the whole problem with your argument here is that one group was able and willing, and did exactly that. It’s completely untrue that the MBC was burnt out and unable to continue, because a) Test went down to Delve and b) Panfam invaded Test. That doesn’t speak of burnout to me, that says that the MBC had plenty of people not burned out, just half of them decided to take the easy way out, and are now bitching because ‘how could this happen to me.’
---
you mean the people who are tackled who just instant pop a cyno back and bring in their entire supercap fleet in range? yea really need to give them more tools to fight off the tackle ship
---
In certain ways it does let you go less potato. Visual effects get loaded into RAM so for megablob fleet fights you had to turn literally every graphics option off to keep RAM use under 4GB, even if your PC could handle the graphics. Makes the game even duller than it should be is running at 10% speed and 5 FPS when you cant even see doomsdays, explosions, or lasers. 
---
Will be nice to run everything at max settings, even though it will still probably sit at 5 FPS and 10% GPU use.
---
Don't be jealous because you can't get that many people to log on
---
What about scoping local to your current in null?  It would work in tandem to the way the overview works.  If folks are actively scouting and reporting in the Intel channel than good on them.  If it's a bot they will have to update their code to work against an Intel channel at least and if no one is reporting Intel, hunters will have a better chance of catching them.
---
&gt; "Collisions"?
---
Wild guess:  unrealistic collision mechanic, i.e. 'bumping', including consequence-free (no damage)
---
That's strangely specific.
---
Of course not. The krab will either roll it or make sure an alt is there to keep an eye on it.
---
Windows will start killing applications if it runs out of memory rather than let your computer.
---
Holy shit this is a horrible fucking change. I will definitely never resub again.
---
the time to re-adjust was within the year after citadels were released not years later after they proliferated to all hell and assisted in creating never before seen safety and wealth generation
---
This guy gets it, all of you arguing for null asset safety need to get over you fear of losing your internet space pixels, if owning a titan is too much risk for you, then don't own one. That used to be one of the balancing features of titans, why do you think everyone and their dog owns a titan now? Because since asset safety there is no risk, in turn that low risk is stagnating the game.
---
Its not out yet tho.
---
You can never have enough GSF
---
I actually think this means we are REALLY going places
---
Tell us how you really feel XD
---
It doesn't really work like that unfortunately. Textures all get loaded into graphics memory long before they're being used in frames rendered and shown on your screen.
---
It seems people tend to use vespa in abyssal site and not hammerheads. Why?
---
They used to bring pretty big numbers. Even if they're not very good, an extra 200 meatshield BS between the enemy and their supers were very effective in enticing Nancy to undock.
---
Hi, does biology skill work on the standard accelerator you get from the free steam campaign?
---
&gt; Meteorites and comets should be a thing, impacting low power citadels and random capital fleets.
---
&gt; 
---
Space is big...and EMPTY.
---
I don't think this would have any place in the EVE Universe.
---
Probably just a moving station
---
&gt;Test? They wouldn't be in a situation where they could seriously threaten goons if they hadn't sucked their dicks.
---
They conceivably might have built up in Vale just as effectively, and with an extra 6 months to do it in as well.
---
This looked good. The ships were great for a small excursion, not for something this dreadful.
---
I loved the skins on the ships. Great color schemes.
---
The big Triglavian ship is one I will want the blueprint of.
---
Looking forward to this expansion.
---
/I stopped paying a lot of attention to the guys meeping about it not being good enough or stupid. Satisfying EVE players is an exercise in futility. If CCP managed to bring back Jesus Christ and introduce him in a new expansion they’d complain he was ‘not genuine’.
---
I was in Judge Sarn’s Twitch stream this morning. This is a man who understands what he’s doing in EVE. He goes ‘I’m fucking going for it, drops a bubble at a Goon gate and takes out three goons before they get his own boat. Fun was had, good fights were enjoyed and the record shows that he was the badass in charge for having the balls to go out and make his own content. It certainly inspired me.
---
Do you even play eve or do you just shitpost uninformed opinions?
---
another retarded change
---
Neither Dark nor MC. nor Frat get to play the "little group" card.
---
Panfam + snuff + Volta + test + probably some others I’m forgetting, and that’s just what I’ve seen in fleet.
---
Having the perspective of having done this for a decade, I can tell you that this is one of the moments where we look at what ~~our players do~~ CCP does and less of what they say.
---
:D Personally I'd want them away from celestials. _Maybe_ needing combat scanned. 
---
Though, tbh, this is all design fiddly bits. I'm not a game designer, and make no real pretence at being such.
---
 I get pinged every time somebody responds to a comment I made. You made two comments on two different comments I made a month after all this went down, and you're saying things that are not true. 
---
Stop being a fucking idiot. If you don't know how reddit works, get out of here. 
---
It's Friday of Memorial Day weekend. No, I don't have any lobbying to do when everybody's been gone for hours.
---
ah I see, that makes sense!
---
And to think Hilmar was talking about how he believe nullblocs have too much control in their space earlier today 🤔🤔🤔
---
I see a lot more complaint about them not welping than complaints about losing.
---
They have been pricks for years and glad their lives are  disrupted but its pathetic all this gsf crying when they do the same exact thing gsf did.
---

---
Btw, you really dont need 2 accounts if you dont feel you need them. 
---
I am an 8 year vet had 2 because it was handy for WHs, you could have one cloaky scout and then another in a hard PVP ship. 
---
But that said, due to money issues i only currently have one account. 
---
It really hasnt changed much, its kinda annoying only having one training queue but hasnt bothered me too much.
---
As long as they cant be put on citadel grids, in anoms or burner missions or next to a dread spawn in a belt, im fine with any other location that cant be gamed.
---
Get woke, go broke. It’s actually misused in this situation as he is saying sensible things.
---
cap stable in simulation often isn't actually cap stable. Especially if it's only marginally cap stable. Because the peak recharge is a very tight band. Go below it, and you can end up draining your cap.
---
Anything below around 36%, (or higher if you're using something with large cap requirements, but an infrequent cycle time) is generally not actually stable.
---
if they arent relic bots
---
F to my only remaining playstyle.
---
Arguing on the internet is like running in the special Olympics, even if you win you're still retarded.  I already admitted to having brain damage in the thread.  What exactly is your excuse?
---
I did not add this but I'm a pro goons but I recently left them to fight them because being on the winning side is boring it's like playing gta with cheat mode
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/the-great-skill-change-of-blessed-2013
---
Panfam fucked up with diplo, gotg were still on their side if ph / BL had not attacked them after (for 0 result...). 
---
Goon had krabb like crazy since this time also. 
---
It explains some change in numbers / strength.
---
* Fixed an issue where Sisters of EVE Advanced Combat suits were not appearing in the market.
---
You guys have no idea how long I've been wondering why I can't see these things in the market. Literally since I got one all those years ago.
---
&gt; •	⁠Local is too strong
---
And they could solve this one quick and easy tonight at downtime. Make it the same local mechanic that’s used in unknown space. If they want to come up with something different later, they can. But this would have a massive net benefit immediately against the stagnation, allow smaller groups to carve out unused space and fuck bots over hard. Also remove notifications of entosising. 👍🏻
---
The hunters of explorers will get more use out of this than explorers...
---
Dont be so flattered that I'm taking 20 seconds to give you attention.  I'm taking a shit at the moment, and grunting out little pieces of your likeness takes priority.
---
Oh good call. Welp the CSM will definitely be fully locked by nullblocs + Steve.

NO IT'S A CONSISTENT THEME NOW

/u/jintaan Come support #TEAM10
---
They might as well have made a blank screen video 4 seconds long that just said "potato".
---
I thought it was still a thing.
---
And they did that job just fine. They created a clear and objective goal for defenders to accomplish to end a war, or for them to hire mercenaries to help them with.
---
This guy gets it. Titans should only be for the most neck bearded of all... those willing to dedicate a toon to life in a space coffin.
---
Instead we get kids who played 2 years posting on reddit how proud they are to own gfs 783rd active titan when they have no clue what that actually meant at one point.
---
Scarcity made titans cool... risk of losing assets made strategy nich more important.
---
&gt; Exactly, local isn't what has made null crap.
---
There is a significant player lobby for 'more frags' (easier kills, and content that is dropped in their laps).  These same people tend to overlook how that devalues combat, because all they care about are ISK figures on killboards for bragging rights.
---
They don't want a move and counter-move strategy game.  That's 'boring' and 'difficult'.
---
Bring me a doll so I can show you where Asher touched me
---
Agreed, take your upvote!
---
like in battlefleet armada 3, or any naval warfare, a collision results in damage
---
"Oh shit I've got implants in this pod."
---
In all honesty the player base likes earning stuff. The only reason we still have the current population is because people can earn the isk for shiny and big ships. Thanks to alliances that earn isk to give back to the playerbase in forms of SRP, Infrastructures. Hilmar said he would rather break the game than keep it like it is. scares me the most of anything. If all that you wanna do gets implemented there will be a vocal minority having a couple months of hunting and than the "asset acquisition" folk will stop playing.
---
I love it!!!
---
Are support ships welcome? Y'all take linx/ewar/tackle and such? Cloaky warpins?
---
it was already possible using dotlan.
---
Easier exploration should boost salvage supply and drive some prices down.  Maybe it's their hamhanded response to complaints about salvage mat shortages.
---
But who are we kidding.  It's just making it more casual friendly and denying the thrill of the hunt.  And it's a nasty nerf to wormholers hunting nullbloc whales.
---
He also has to buy his votes...
---
Just because unknown space has this doesn’t mean we should ignore null. That’s like getting a flat tire and not fixing it because the other three tires are fine.
---
It's a server change and they probably didn't want to make a patch note for it just before a big release
---
Thankfully never again.

Looks like CCP went with "nah who cares, fuck explorers"
---
This is a literary method of calling goons cucks in a creative manner.
---
What a garbage change. If they dipped into the community for even ten minutes of feedback they'd have seen why this is an awful idea.
---
so no major wars...
---
Templis is one of the bubbles. We'll fuck you up if we get in your eye!

Sadly. Working =(

I actually like this change. Kiss my face

Whoever fights with hons should see to it that he does not become a hon in the process. And when you gaze long into an hon the hon also gazes into thee.
---
You must be one of the scumbags that helped get rid of it. I guess no fun allowed huh? Nothing that's purely cosmetic is allowed to be in the game?
---
Very unlikely but Hilmar the CEO of CCP did tweet a few months ago hinting at it, with their new korean overlords it would be a gold mine for microtransactions so who knows; but if it does happen it would most likely be years away
---
ha quality
---
Appearing in local must be optional, period. Bring in a transponder system similar to crime watch, three settings.
---
Appear in local
---
Appear delayed in local (only appear when chatting)
---
Don't appear in local.
---
Limit d-scan pings to 60 seconds, watch eve grow into a massive pvp game and end botting overnight.
---
I wasn't there when it was here, and any amount of dev / designer /  QA time wasted on this bullshit is a massive waste.
---
So sad.. played this game for 4 months, loved it, but I already burnt out.. PvP is too difficult to find, systems are usually empty.. and too much other stuff.. got a little bored already.. too bad I joined too late
---
After thinking about it I think CCP sees this as a QoL change and nothing more. Too bad they don't have insights from people who actually play the...oh wait
---
F for Eve.
---
Players have wanted this for... well since the game was released I think.
---
As an active explorer myself I dont really understand how this will play out. If someone clears out a site 5 systems out, will my agency get updated? If so it would give out alot of intel. I usually run around null sec and speed clear relic and data sites trying to be ahead of other explorers. Every system other explorers have to check gives me enough time to clear a site. If they see systems getting cleared in their agency window they will either catch up trying to get ahead or choose a different route, which then again kills the experience of racing against other players. I dont know. Seems like a weird change to me.
---
I havent in a while, but I like to start somewhere, explore, go through a hole, come out some other region and keep going for 2-3 hours before finding a path to hs and jita.    Easy to do, just random flying.
---
Until Rorq's are smashed witha nerf bat and/or a Titan killer introduced, like a T2/Triglavian Dread, this will kill Eve. It's just a ticking clock to Serenity II.
---
The CEO of CCP doesn't know how to fix his game, call me surprised.
---
Why DO I play with guys?
---
Blablabla. ;)
---
Why not. Most of the times that's all we get.
---
Yep! Bring whatever ships you like, though as before we have ships prepared for most situations, so if you *wanna* bring something blingy it's not required, but it's on you to keep it alive! :D
---
I have a feeling the chat is the new POS code.
---
Friendship is the best waifu
---
Low quality, we never leave home without our knives for backstabbing. 9/10

drone lifes matter!
---
Emotes and cat ears
---
Well this sounds like a easy fix....
---
Incarna baby! Oh wait.
---
I'm appreciative that CCP patches the game. I'm thankful for all the friends that i've met over the years. I'm thankful that when my eve break ends, eve will still be here.

Am i missing something or are you just stupid?

he just hates ncpl because they killed his ibis once
---
he is a goon line member yes
---
Hac numbers were nearly dead even nc. actually had 2 more to start with
---
See, dscan reduced to 60s will kill most PVP because hunting becomes nigh impossible. All it takes is people watching gates
---
Did you forget to switch accounts?
---
Get it? Because goons are pussies?
---
There are 8 hard points on the model and 7 guns.  The Hyperion should be next on the list.
---
So it makes null less safe?
---
I literally never heard that as a complaint for pos
---
Ya, bumping a titan might cause it to move a little (conservation of momentum), but it should totally wreck the smaller ship.
---
can't trust euros to do anything right

We can beat nc in 1:1. We can beat PL in 1:1 we can beat ph in 1:1. But yeah sure we are pet...

Do it then hilmar  ffs please.

Nope.

CPUs have been 64 bit since around 2004. Your 10 years old gaming PC should have 64 bit OS installed. Even a 15 years old PC should be 64 bit compatible if it had brand new CPU back when it was made.
---
Imperium brought 2 drakes, cheat mode activated
---
Panfam was so dumb for attacking any entity that isn't already Goon affiliated, thus forcing those groups to blue Goons.
---
is that a bathtub full of urine?
---
what happened to posting nice pictures of pudding :/
---
But yet NC won't come out and fight.  Hmmmmm....
---
It seems very likely.
---
who told you that? wouldn't be someone who benefits from lying to save face, would it?
---
Put your money where your mouth is. Turn off local chat next patch Tuesday.
---
&gt; So what does pirat do now? Drop 10-20 different hqs
---
Ummm yeah, that's exactly what they'll do that way they don't lose all their wars if a major block kills the one hosting their war.
---
*gets 1 jump out and checks again*
---
Oh, a bunch of shit. Cool.
---
*goes back the way they came*
---
I'd go one step further, and remove any and all ref cycles with no damage cap. That way people can't be little cunts and hide behind timers and/or have to actively fend off a fleet that's come to destroy it.
---
They haven't been planning on deleting local... they've been planning on adding it to wormholes this whole time!
---
Yes, I am just assuming these same people are running 32bit XP or 7...
---
Gah, when did I start getting old, 10 years seems like it was much further back... =/
---
Init beat NC in 1:1?
---
Very rare for those two to fight alone.
---
They have groups around them, they each have some coalition they are a executor of and overall combined are more or less like Legacy and Imperium. So yes they each have a little group.
---
As a loser you would say that.
---
well it is, it just other groups haven't grown as quickly as goon's if the north had all joined up and started to build up like goons have you would have 2 massive blocks with these numbers slugging it out.
---
oh shit I gave you my constant location
---
Did you mean to say Targaryens? :)
---
Don't see why it can't just scale.
---
Hisec local is normal. Lowsec normal is delayed. Nullsec local is delayed more, or switched to constellation.
---
RMT Is the alliance ticker of the space in question.
---
In the sisi test I was in I was able to run everything at max setting and all effects on, it ran like a dream and honestly felt like a different game being able to actually have everything visible, if you look on twitch at the talking in stations streams you can probably find the vod of that test.
---
I'm jesting that maybe we should look to the one fine tire and try to patch up the three broken ones the same as it.
---
You dream we had a lot of big fight and win in the pure blind campaign last year. More than this year (because vale is empty)
---
It's slang. Believe it or not, people have used slang since the dawn of language.
---
I DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT THAT, IS THAT ALL YOUR PEE? THAT'S PRETTY GROSS MAN.
---
But who is the goldfish?
---
I don't see how this makes nullsec safer.
---
In fact, this just helps the hunters find sweet spots to gank krabbers without even having to be in the system.
---
Fight happened over a ihub timer NC. got to keep the ihub but a fun fight was had so I dont think anyone left upset.
---
Guess we'll have to go back to using hecates...
---
Not sure what your point is here
---
Oh ok. 👍🏻
---
I'll take 5 please
---
There are some weird, mentally fucked, people playing this game. We had a guy in an old alliance that made up some shit about his "wife" having some horrible disease before ripping off his own corp. Wasnt my corp, but it was wild to watch it go down.
---
Karma is a bitch though, and I pray this one never catches up to him, making his ruse a reality.
---
sad
---
That's not true.
---
It's sad that you think that.
---
I mean, personally yes. I just randomly choose a direction and fly that way seeing what I see and meeting the random people. I mark wormholes on the way and when I want to go home to high sec I just jump through a chain back to the safest spot.
---
No, it isn't, idk what is wrong with him.
---
If playing n+1 in a game that is, and always has been, designed to reward n+1 gameplay makes us pussies, then I’m the biggest pussy you’ve ever met.
---
Let's get sloppy.
---
It'll get fixed with the Shield Slaves Expansion.
---
That would be too low effort for the attacking side
---
What the fuck, they're actually going ahead with this? Do they even feedback bro?
---
This takes away the feeling of, well, exploring when doing exploration, which is one of the things that makes it fun. It is also a huge source of intel - depending on how quickly it updates, it could have serious implications for hole control for wormholes with a K space exit, it would give information about other explorers in the entire galaxy, and let hunters pre-camp promising systems.
---
This is **a bad idea** and CCPls reconsider.
---
Stop teasing me.
---
I seriously hope not.
---
I'm confused. how is it a huge cost and a ton of damage for a 500m structure that eats maybe a hundred mil of fuel a month?
---
which of the new ships is power creep lol
---
they're shit
---
Don't let piss poor design and implementation get in the way of the truth. The crapness of CQ was its own demise and long may it rest. Chris Roberts will happily take your coin for the space pixel eutopia you want.
---
You can already do this, if you Ctrl+A on the probe window, it will remember that, and you'll see new sigs as unselected.
---
Titans Online, wew.
---
TEST
---
Seems like free intel, tbh. Part of the lure of exploration is RNG, and finding a signature-rich system for yourself to exploit.
---
If your wanting to just do defensive fw then a venture is perfect don't really need to fit anything. Just keep an eye on dscan
---
Would you rather have the development time go into being a beautiful space Barbie, or on spaceships?
---
People complaining about Rorquals are so cute, as usual when a wise man points at the moon, an idiot looks at his finger...
---
Think about it, if you nerf rorqual again what will be the result?
---
More rorquals on field, same amount of ore, same problem.
---
The problem is that people can use a rorqual in no time thanks to injectors instead of take their time to train the in the old way.
---
Same problem with bots, how can you think to get rid of bots if you can train a new bot in no time after a ban?
---
Remove injectors, that's the only solution, and it's not impossible, it requires only balls of steel and the will to do what needs to be done.
---
So people just wouldn't make any ISK because of a small uptick in risk? That seems unlikely in the extreme.
---
Not sure what we're going to do - but god damn it we're going to do it.
---
Because if you don't use it then your complicent in harboring botters.
---
&gt; 750-900 titans deployed, &lt;  1200 titans on grid 
---
this is why you are funny to watch, you don't actually bother to fact check until after someone points out mid rant you're using the wrong data.
---
do any of you that are mad about this even do a lot of this? I feel like this is a new bro thing why not make the game better for new players?
---
Great words but I won't believe until I see some actions - particularly given that almost every change in the last two years has gone in the opposite direction.
---
I for one look at maps on dotlan for that
---
Do you mean like their numerous plans to focus on balance more or do you mean plans like releasing dust on a console that already had the next gen announced?
---
Just for clarity sake so I know what interpretation of "plans" CCP is using this time.
---
well we've all seen his wall of words posts before, its not like we need new examples of his bad ideas.
---
the best part of him running will be the reddit posts after he doesn't get elected.

i read a little about, and i want to try as start for attacker missions, much profitable i think if i see i loose a lot or too hard for me then ill start with defensive.
---
Not sure what paint you were huffing when you made that comment but I was talking about how Darkness surrendered and then Horde decided to try and evict them because they didn't like the deal darkness cut. Darkness didn't bail on panfam till half of them attacked and the other half watched and did nothing.
---
being a logistics god versus quitting eve for some trim
---
Apart from showing sigs in the Agency (see the other thread) this looks like a really good update.
---
If you stick to novice sites the basic 5frigate you get whilst doing the starter missions is enough to kill the frigate
---
I was disappointed when, after the Garmur escaped, the abyssal rift didnt open again to spew out massive ammounts of triglavian ships and that Titan. 
---
Was expecting them to blap that Garmur after it escaped :(
---
Still a solid 7/10 video
---
But my point is he has done the exact same thing before with Incarna and monacle gate/jita riots were the out come. This is not the first time Hilmar threw the game under the bus for some quick cash, it's just the most recent one
---
Because obviously, it matters for my argument that the actual amount is 750-900 instead of 1200. /s
---
This is why you Goon folks are funny to watch. You'll always find petty irrelevant points to express what you really mean, your hate.
---
but then they'd have to dirty their hands with PVE
---
Appreciate the effort but your formatting reminds me of structure spam and couldn't read more than 1/3

No!

---
Nah man you just check it, set waypoints, then close it. It will be a huge boost in explorer income as there is less wandering aimlessly. 
---
I will say it takes a bit off of the immersion by actually being excited when you find a relic site.. but id prefer this, semi-explorer btw
---
Maybe read again, i was making fun of people calling pet everywhere.
---
But i very much doubt we can beat NC. 1:1. PL perhaps, but not NC.
---
Freaking awesome. All Panfam is doing is crying about how unfair it is, even though they spent a decade with the meta in their favor showing no mercy or sportsmanship for their enemies. Karma is a bitch.

What’s the fastest way to make hundreds of millions of ISK as an Alpha without much time to play? I can’t afford most things, and would love to become one of those rich players. Thanks :)
---
Just try it. Holy fuck. Some of you are the worst people imaginable. Its a change not the end of the world. We all call for change then cry when it comes. 
---
Think of hunter that see anom sites frequently resetting. Might be able to be able to be used to track the system for ratting activitity.
---
Meaning roaming gangs will need to make less frequent trips into dead end systems. 
---
I dont mind the change as its described. Willing to try it
---

---
Yeah, alphas can fly fully T2 fit frigates and destroyers these days (including faction frigates, though not having Frigate V affects the bonus on those quite badly), so you can definitely be effective in FW.
---
Buying PLEX, then using it as seed money for station trading. Be aware though this is more likely to fail the succeed as making a lot of ISK off the market requires significant game knowledge.
---
That crystal guy seems pretty cool
---
Yes, it applies to training boosters.
---
This has to be the worst change ever. Like do they even play this game? People don't want crap handed to them. THEY WANT TO EXPLORE DAMNIT!
---
Lol the CEO of CCP is up here saying the balance swung to be too safe but no, the hunters are wrong.
---
Vespas have significantly higher shield EHP (hammerheads have more of there EHP in their hull), are somewhat faster, and track better the hammerheads at the cost of some DPS. They also do kinetic damage instead of thermal.
---
nice worthless comment
---
impossible
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
To be brutally honest, they should just play the game man. Who gives a shit if they're outnumbered? It's a game and we just want to have a fun little war. You think we're going to respond to every single NC fleet with 1300 Titans? Goons have day jobs too, bro. Even IF, *IF,* we did a Scortched Earth doctrine and deleted your shit, we would just leave and you'd rebuild it anyway because ISK is infinite in this dumb internet spaceship game. Plus, who gives a shit? It's pixels bro.
---
It's cool that NCPL thinks they're hot shit for pruning off the retards in Delve who refuse to listen to leadership. But you fail to understand that we're letting them die for being retarded. Their losses mean dick to us because they spent their own money for those supers/titans/rorqs. None of that shit comes out of Asher's or Mittens wallets. And you're delusional if you think zkill means anything.
---
Just play along with it. It'd be a much cooler narrative if NCPL actually tried and put on a good show. It's not like any of this is gonna matter once you log off anyway.
---
The point of a video game is to play it for fun. And I think everybody would have a lot more fun with this game if we all fueled the war hype. But if your version of fun is evacuating/avoiding everybody who actually pursues you for content, then I just feel sorry for NCPL leadership. It's really funny too, because everybody will bitch and moan begging for content and as soon as Goons offers up content (to ANYBODY) on a Titan-sized tritanium platter, y'all 180 and say "nah, we're good."
---
Also, you guys had plenty of opportunity and time to build wealth and a war machine that could match Goons, but, your leadership clearly decided that wasn't possible for some reason and here we are. The blame also lies with your allies.
---
I don't know man. I'm just telling it how I see it. Even WH corps are more eager to fight us *in Delve, knowing we have a supercap umbrella,* than NCPL is *in their own space.*
---
If anybody has a dissenting opinion or a grievance, let me hear it. Because I really want to understand the other side better too. I'm *trying* not to be biased, but please understand that I *really, really want this war to go full swing.*
---
Cool vid.
---
Wouldn't it be great if Eve combat actually required you to aim, or dodge? And if the Triglavians actually invaded space that people might care about and took the fight to over-entrenched player groups?
---
So it's CCP's fault NC is incompetent?
---
just remove local
---
Shield and drone skills, navigation skills that relate to ABs and base ship stats, as well as Gallente and Caldari cruiser. The passive gila is repetitively low skill in comparison to the active gila for higher class abyssal sites, and is less expensive as well.
---
Ship bumping.  The way cynos work.  If my Titan exits a warp tunnel into the ship model of another it should be more that a bump.  A high speed "bump" and a frigate should just vaporize.

Panfam has chosen to deploy the downvote brigade rather than any actual ships lmao
---
There is an and there that you clearly didn’t read. 
---
I’ll rephrase it below.
---
Each (Dark, NC. Frat) runs its own coalition, small groups surround them. So when you are talking about Dark you have everyone around them they control, frat same way and panfam, etc. that’s more or less the other croissant. 
---
Also numerically with Imperium and Legacy nip they are the small groups 🤔
---
Hammy is annoying on coms. Can not stop talking
---
I’m a total noob, so forgive me, but what’s the issue here? Doesn’t it just make exploration a little easier?
---
We need EvE Classic.
---
So maybe they now need to be re-adjusted in a reactionary faction where they are super-duper squishy and fragile for awhile, until they are brought under control. Then re-re-adjusted to make them more balanced.
---
I really like these characters, I hope they stick with these three guys for each expansion haha
---
Yes...that's the problem.  It's not exploring if you already know where to go and where not to go.
---
They should basically have the same reinforce mechanics pos's had. There wasn't an issue with them imo
---
Terrible
---
And Who is Hon Hon Hon Honing with Hedliner? And does it Feels akward when Killah Bee Calls for a Big CTA for Supers and Titans, and his Hon Hon Honing Sounds like JU Standing 5 Minutes After Downtime? PanFam lifes matter!

"Why do I even play with you guys!"
---
:cringe:
---
Keeping the 'fourth wall' intact with, "Why do I even fleet with you guys!", would have been better.
---
Most of space is underutilized as it is. The higher the population density, the more content per square AU you're going to find. If anything, there's too much space as it is.
---
Eventually, yeah. POS bashing was fairly well balanced. I wouldn't be opposed to about a 6 month period in which they are much easier to bash than POSes were though, just to clear some of the fucking things out. Then make them like POSes.
---
Im personally really hoping to see the thorax redesign come through. that was one sexy phallus

PanFam always Seen allies as meatshields. Since PL turned into a Fortnite Clan, and NC shat on every relationships, there are not many allies back. Followed by blaming goons, and the excuse that they " just wanna log in and have fun aka insta gratification" Put some "no free Iskies for Moon Goo" on to that pile and you have that result.
---
&gt; Yes, I am just assuming these same people are running 32bit XP or 7...

Just leave them to their delusional memes, Goons dont PVP, goons dont take risks, goons will never leave delve, all this mining and industry is just people selling to highsec etc etc.
---
They believe whatever stupid garbage they want to believe, to reflect their own agendas and egos, and it shows by how they have become completely ineffective organizations over the last few years, they huff way too much of their own jenk.
---
I'm not involved in null sov, to me anytime wasted on sov is a bullshit massive waste of time. Null population make up a tiny amount of the paying player base compared to high sec'rs, lets not waste anymore effort on sov, it clearly does not pay the bill anyhow.
---
LOL, you trying to prove him right? New goon tactic?
---
Not for numbers that don't matter.
---
Hey wait a minute!
---
Think it should repeated that people understand and use the voting process. Do not just select one candidate. Fill up with as many candidates that fit your playstyle or that you feel have merit to be CSM.
---
If your first pick doesnt get in, then your vote goes to your 2nd pick and continues on until there is no one else on your ballot to transfer votes, or your pick wins.
---
So if you want representation in small gang/ship balance/wormholes/lowsec/highsec (under represented areas of the game) fill out your ballot with as many people represent those areas.
---
If you only select 1 candidate then youre essentially throwing your vote away if that 1 person gets eliminated.
---
Realistically, there will be 1-2 spots not dominated by nullsec vote power (potentially). We will need voting consolidation to have a chance at those spots.
---
Disclaimer: This is not a post saying vote for me. This is just in general to anyone who wants a representitive in an area of the game that isnt nullsec.
---
Not even comparable.
---
“Let’s not go after the root of the problem” “lets go after a tactical stop gap instead”

Does it as you for a reason when you pick no?

" But it will make nullsec EVEN safer." Are you high? If anything this makes a hunters job easier because they don't have to enter a pocket to see if there are any sites there worth checking for people running them.

Same effect.

In 2018 NC spent around  3 months in Delve during the Gehi deployment, . after that deployed to Curse and then moved back North when Goons &amp; co started pushing into Fade / GOTG.
---
For you as a player, the main benefit is that you won't crash because the application runs out of memory, which frequently happened during large fleetfights.
---
There is also a roughly 10% FPS improvement, due to more compiler optimizations available for 64bit math and memory operations.
---
The only drawback is an increase in memory usage. I generally saw about a 50% increase compared to the 32bit client. There is nothing that can be done about that. 64bit applications by design require more memory than their 32bit counterparts.
---
Your mileage on the latter two points may vary (just some ballpark numbers I noticed during development), but you definitely won't crash anymore when the application requires more than 4GB of memory.
---
drop supers on it
---
It just so happens that I am diagnosed with a mental disability, you biggoted pos.
---
Yeh, now why do you need to use a mobile cyno inhibitor, the balance of eve is built around the fact that a different ship , often class counters what you field. A combat ceptor can hunt cruisers, stealth bombers eat battleships, what is the counter to supers and titans? Currently none.
---
Title sounded like the setup for a joke.

Possible and good.

&gt;don't hurt legitimate vpn users because you can't fix bots
---
What if the reason is dependent on VPNs?
---
Why would he...he controls the business side, he is not a developer.
---
Considering 64 bit client will use ~50% more memory. It only leaves 2GB free after the 32 bit client crashed. It could reach 8GB for sure depending on your settings.
---
"Make it scary again"  I like the sound of that.  I'd like to see it done in a way that does not involve just nerf batting everything.  Something big like a resource shuffle.   Titan module to open a wormhole to a T3C fitting with a module with some significant fatigue timer and fuel cost.  Fast anchoring staging citidel that can only be dropped on grid with another citidel like an enemies staging keepstar.

Fun to camp a wh that has not been lived in for a min and wait for day trippers to pounce on.
---
I personally loved the comms - thought it was hilarious and fairly realistic as to what actually gets said.
---
“I don’t eve know why I fleet with you guys” that doesn’t really work.
---
Everyone keeps saying that, but I see Frat in their corner making a pile of supers and titans just as fast as they can turn them out. They went from avoiding super fights with test last year without half the map backing them up to having equal numbers to fight test with and being willing to drop them. All it takes is a willingness to actually understand that you need a PVE/industry base to your alliance to solve the issues panfam is currently experiencing.
---
I see the most annoying problems in different places.
---
1. As the price of Plex continues to rise, the price of minerals and other materials is stagnating or falling. It's all in abundance, so it's cheap and anyone can afford a titan or super in no time. CCP made it too easy to farm/mine, there is way too much ISK and stuff in the game. Just think a moment about, what a titan would cost if mineral prices would have inflated like the price for plex.
---
2. Skill injectors have been a bad idea too.
---
3. real ISK sinks are missing
---
&gt; 80-90% of your population
---
I'm talking about Everytime you die, the games asks how your experience was.
---
Aww, then baked on the text, PS has a intelligent fill thing that will probbly fix it, or I can go at it with a clone brush later.
---
I agree. There needs to be more counters to capitals.
---
But in the context of our discussion (see the comment tree above) proliferation is specifically about capital farming. Capital farming is specifically under protection of supercap umbrellas. Supercap umbrellas specifically depend on cyno mechanics. Circumventing these mechanics is possible with cyno inhibitors. The better mobile cyno inhibition is, the more possibilities will occur to circumvent them.
---
You should take the advice your flair contains
---
1300 titans in one alliance move op, if you don’t think super/Titan over proliferation hasn’t gotten out of hand, I don’t know what to say. 
---
Ccp has to know there are to many supers/titans, they just don’t know how to stuff that genie back in the bottle while still having ever larger “million dollar” fights.
---
I have a suggestion.
---
I miss Drone land alloys...
---
God bless
---
You clearly don’t do a ton of exploration. 
---
The randomness of popping through a whole constellation to find everything and the unexpected encounters being forced to go through gates having no idea if anything is in that next system.

---
Peaks and valleys bro. You can't fit people into the valleys, they only live on the peaks. So peak space needs to be increased.
---
Second problem I have specifically with everyone that is left playing the game is that you think this is all "A OK" when you have no notion of what your missing. Content density needs to drop WAY down. Like, through the floor levels. Because your "higher the population density" is a problem, **a serious fucking problem**, *we can't all be on the same team*. But the ONLY options are the mega teams. There is no coincidence that there is a war of North vs South every year. Well every other year now.
---
They are thinking: "we try it with only fully visible from 1 jump and when if there is only one guy who found that helping, we might consider (in other words, it will come) increasing the details to be visible from everywhere"

Get on grid with your drones, right click on your capacitor and there should be a 'reconnect to lost drones' option. Failing that if you can get on grid with them you can right click on them and chose 'scoop to drone bay' to get them back.

If the area despawned and you didn't bookmark it you will have to combat probe them down with an expanded probe launcher and combat scanner probes.

If your argument is:
---
"No one can stop the goons and they are breaking the game"  
---
Then it is shit.
---
Goons have been telling people what they were doing, and why they were doing it for years.  They even told people how to emulate it, and why it was powerful.  Shit, you can even view the fucking goon market on a public site.  
---
Now, the argument is that the goons are breaking the game because they did the thing they said they would do and no one else did?
---
GTFO.

Ok?

I see. I was looking into the game, but I've discovered it way too late, by that time the talk about its p2w nature was everywhere. So I decided to skip it straight.
---
It was one of the reasons I first played the game. One of the reasons many of us started.
---
No hand holding, literally a figure it out and die 10000000000 times to find what works or what’s where. 
---
This let’s do 90% of the work for you shit is boring and for lazy retards that quite frankly don’t really deserve it.
---
It takes a measure of achievement away from it, that’s really the only part aside from the isk positive that many of us get from exploration.
---
But agree to disagree.
---
As if anyone needs a spy in test comms to figure out what it's like.
---
Ok we need to stop legacy affording 8b of raitarus is simply too far.
---
Space Barbies please. They teased it, I got on board, and then they snatched it away.
---

---
Eh, the "big and epic spoopy bads" lose a lot of their impact when the trailer then instantly hurtles through the fourth wall and it's just players derping around, making it utterly free of consequence or impact. 
---
Meh.
---
yes?
---
This is the most accurate representation of wormholes I have ever read.
---
I don’t like a game to hold my hand either I started playing eve after a long run in EQ and it’s the reason I like the game too. But there is only one thing to me more frustrating then a game that holds my hand and that is a game the masks difficulty with wasting my time. If they want the game to live and have a new player base there is no reason not to do some quality of life changes that remove some wasted time for players so they can spend more time doing the challenging content. A big part of eve for me is the planning and analysis of data before setting off on a adventure. This give players another tool to use to do just that rather then just jumping gates randomly.
---
so the invasion is beginning now? Explains why there have been no progress since it originally started
---
so after months, is this it? I cant wait for the PGL morale post mk17
---
Of all the things they could do to the game I just don’t get all the hate around this who cares.
---
I started EVE like 4 years ago. 
---
Did mining. Sucked. Took a break.
---
Came back, did small lowsec corp. Was fun then sucked. Took a break.
---
Came back and did the nullsec blob twice. Was fun then got boring and downright sad. Took a break.
---
Still wanted to be a part of EVE so I recently came back and started chilling and doing explo more. Now we're here.
---

Again, adding another thing to pull people away from actually playing the game and policing players. Not the players job.

 You have actually lost me. If i have understood correctly all of this data currently exists and lives on a ccp database. Ccp could do the analytics and develop an algorithm that detects bots based on bounty payouts. And then they could ban people. There doesn't need to be any action whatsoever on the players. Right?
---
Great video Olmeca.
---
Good luck with the CSM, we need more people like you.
---
Why wouldn't Goons want changes?   Can't kill people if they aren't playing the game. 
---
Besides, the CSM doesn't make changes to the game.  They can only make suggestions which are ignored more often than heeded.
---
CCP once again making changes nobody asked for.
---
&gt; This is some Rook and Kings level quality and story telling

o7
---
That's the thing.  It wouldn't be small would it.  It would be a huge uptick in risk, as it is in WH, though at least in WH you can close most of the gates (other WH).
---
Taking WH as an example, the value in anoms would have to go up a lot to make it worthwhile to take the risk.

This is what I mean about changing only one variable when you need to change many to retain or create a new optimal.

That’s Literally the definition of hand holding, go to x system for 5 sites. That’s the most “I’m a lazy pos” excuse I have ever heard. I’m all for new people and a more streamlined attempt to introduce new game play and a genuine basic tutorial, but that’s it.
---
So you're saying this is your fault, you son of a bitch!
---
Does it work?
---
They needed goonies to keep NCPL busy so they could get their blob to the sufficient ratio.
---
A lot of us care, I care. Been in exploration since way before Wh space.
---
Id be fine with it being in hisec, as it would make the content more visible to new players, but it has no place in nullsec
---
It's a vily moral post. So it's better
---
Nice video, i think you did strike a nice balance on the storytelling  . +1
---
Almost R&amp;K, i am sure with your next videos it will improve.
---
Also, running incursions can be done as an alpha and makes you about 100mil/hr
---
Remember when PGL had a Twitch stream? I have that SOB a Prime subscription.....
---
It's a video game screen shot.  Forza or something. Idk which one.
---
Oh damn, I guess I've been got.
---
I think you underestimate how Goons suffer in a stagnate game as much as everyone else.
---
It's "adorable" you think that's more likely than what I mentioned, and that it's the only solution.
---
Delet this
---
the adrenaline pumps are so unique in eve. thanks for sharing brother! o7
---
Thanks o7
---
Lol excavator boshing, u won eve, I guess bottom feeders got to make a living.
---
I mean, they could in theory probably look at what you did that day and gauge why you might have disliked the experience... Like you lost a blingy ship, or you complained in local about the cloaky camper, you name it.
---
But of course i doubt that they have the capacity to properly assess that much data.
---
This looks shopped &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt; Almost R&amp;K
---
I'll take it :)
---
Thanks for being a good sport. We must find ways to try to get along regardless of flair. Including me.
---
Lol, sucker. Probably "loaned" him a ship too.
---
What is that window you are showing? Never seen it in 15 years of playing...  😋
---
oh hey you unmuted me.
---
i still think you're a cockbag but your videos and content is good stuff.
---
Can always log on to SISI and find out for yourself.
---
What gets me is that he was so casual about saying "Oh, it only took 55 hours of dedicated grinding/pveing to plex the account. That to me is fucking crazy! I'd much rather dedicate an hour or so of irl work time to plex an account and then spend the rest of my time actually playing the game I want. I get some people like the "challenge" of earning isk in game to play for free but still, after a while it gets boring if that's your only goal.
---
Bad change.
---
Could legacy you drop a Komodo again
---
Looks like Eve decided to move to w-space.
---
Vote for Stitch / Olmeca / Pain.
---
Thanks! Consider sharing the vid with your friends :)
---
Forgetting hes got clones and bringing the wrong ammo. 10/10 accurate portrayal of capsuleers.
---
For years CCP tried to appease players with cool content, updates, expansions and re balancing.  Then they tried to tease us with free login gifts, but that's just way too much effort to keep doing.
---
Turns out that adding two buttons to the settings menu for us to rage at CCP through, buttons connected to nothing as there is no back end, will increase daily logins more than anything else.
---
4000 iq play by CCP
---
It scares me knowing  there are weird as fuck people playing this game
---
I did remove all mutes. I'll try harder to get along and ignore those who can't. I appreciate you not basing your comments about the video on your preexisting beliefs about me.
---
b.. but i thought THEY are the victims getting evicted?
---
What the fuck ccp
---
Doesn't this mean that the kiki will now get bonused damage in c2 wolf rayets?
---
How is this bad again?
---
&gt;It is hyping for the wrong things, though.
---
You say about a trailer for an expansion where the main event is our space being invaded.
---
Why would it have been a trailer about a pvp fight?
---
Well done!
---
I'm still halfway into the video, but looks like a top quality work which will surely inspire many people to try out the cloaky lifestyle.
---
Didn't he just start playing the game again last year to actually understand what has to be done though?
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely skeptical too.
---
When they want it to. I just don't think CCP has 24/7 bot hunters. When they can ban 100+ accounts at a time it may be worth it. Also, the affect of removing them from the economy can be negative. Just like the USA could stop counterfeit money (using the plastic tech that has been around for 30 years) but removing that much currency from the market is seen as a potential huge negative.
---
Jokes on you, he hasn't played since December 2018
---
Listen here, if I dont see the back of some guys ribcage explode from being shot int he chest by a low caliber handgun, wellt hats just a shitty unrealistic movie with no SFX budget.
---
For all of 10 seconds.
---
I was going to say... If you believe that I have this bridge I would love to sell you. Low low price.
---
Im not the least bit worried about memory. im  moving to a 128GB platform shortly for other applications.  
---
use all the memory you want.
---
I'll go
---
Is this going to effect that at all? In my experience a system with a ton of sigs is not really more likely than a system with only 1 or 2 to have a relic site. And now that everyone can see systems with a lot of sigs those will be visited frequently, and it'll be even less likely for lots of relic sites to build up there.
---
They figured out how to avoid forgetting to stock up on topes.
---
Great video!
---
Sure. Hit me up with a time and place.
---
Lordhaber
---
But NCPL is not defending so...
---
Clicking the thumbs down icon automatically opens a text input window that wont close until you type out why you did not enjoy playing EVE Online today (minimum 500 words).
---
Because competing against a human is still the most exciting and challenging thing in 2019. Competition against AI is I guess just something to do, but not nowhere closer.
---
Until scientists make AI better.
---
It is a dagger, but yeah ...
---
Bottom feeders implies the base of the food chain - which is you brainless spod munchers. 
---
Way more fun to make a few billion taking it from others than extracting it from rock pixels
---
I personally think there should be more 'categories' of security in space. -0.1 shouldn't be the same as -1.0. Maybe implement it in tiers with the lowest security systems having more risk than the more moderate 'null sec' systems
---
Physical RAM is not relevant. Assuming Windows 10, your OS will first compress memory to reduce its size (negligible performance loss), then clear out other background applications (alt tab performance is slow), then start using your hard drive as memory called the "page file" (major performance hit). Realistically it will never crash due to running out of memory.
---
impressive!
---
This is actually what I do. I'm still kind of a noob and when I'm playing alone I enjoy going out in my astero and go wherever, looking for sites. Better than ratting or grinding missions
---
put maldonado in it and watch the show
---
That's just today. There were another 20 or so yesterday too.
---
So you're against a solution?
---
The point is, if you were maximizing isk, then you were already setting out a circle, mapping all sigs you saw in something like Tripwire, and just going around and around scanning down all the new sigs that popped up. This change doesn't significantly effect this playstyle, it allows you to cross out certain pockets and you might be able to slightly increase your isk/hr but it won't be a huge change. 
---
If you weren't trying to maximize isk then just ignore this change. You can pretend it never happened and it won't effect you at all.
---
Is Army Of Mango joining Test in this offensive push?
---
I believe there’s a fleets section on talking in stations discord. I’m sure if you put a post in there with a time and place you could get some people. 
---
Alternatively maybe start your own discord, get people to join it and ping for NPSI fleets?
---
The obvious answer is leave your Corp and join a PvP focused Corp, but I’m assuming there’s a reason you don’t want to do that right?
---

---
great, just have to bring in the goon bias detector and bad dinosaur pics and i don't even need reddit anymore
---
Well I really think there should not even be red Xs until you have at least scanned the system. But that is a whole mother topic. Adding these to the agent finder does not make it easy mode it’s already just a time sync there is nothing complicated about scanning.
---
Don't be this dumb Cerevox, we already have Krabs whining and crying in alliance chat about how a scary new signature showed up and they want someone to scan it for them.
---
This doesn't instantly make all wormholes known and it sure as hell won't suddenly make people more keen on reshipping from their VNIs and Rorquals.
---
 legendary video! I respect a lot folks that can multi box. I can barely play with one account! - Pax 6.
---
So if you get to a system first, and scan it down, it's almost a guarantee someone will come for it.
---
I might switch from poping out to null to do relic sites, to poping out to hunt people doing relic sites.
---
Max skill Astero with a injecter and dual reps and a faction scram is going to do well right?
---
This is like thinking a carbon tax on everyday citizens will make a difference to global warming while exempt corporations run thousands of dirty factories.
---
Do you play the game in any way that isn't sov null? Then you are playing wrong! Let us at CCP help you play how we want you to play by slowly killing off all other parts of the game.
---
It's because we love you that we want you to git gud.
---
Is an Orthrus a thing in Abyssal space?
---
CCP TEST PLEASE IGNORE
---
Awesome video.
---
Inb4 goons salt in this thread.
---
The idea behind it is literally the opposite of this.....
---
Make the big corporation pay more because they are losing more ships.
---
My thinking is the everyday citizens aren’t the one throwing several caps away each week because they can. 
---
The everyday citizen that occasionally loses a ship in pvp wouldn’t be affected as mich as the mega corporations that lose billions a week
---
My point is that people have run the numbers and insurance is an abysmally small portion of the isk faucet despite what people keep spouting.
---
but they ran away to delve so they still aren't in the south which is good enough for tapi.
---
haha gottem
---
Before the T3 rebalance I was sometimes wandering around null in a Tengu, hacking sites and occasionally chating with locals. Always been out for a couple of weeks when i did this. The only way I could stand exploration. With this change and the rebalance they killed this playstyle. GG CCP. Again
---
i have it on alt level2 but still can fly the battleship
---
its not a world ark, its a sun eater. notice there are no stars in abyssal space? and ccp said it will fuck with suns,
---
Karmafleet for example.
---
I would vote for this guy, but I think their are better candidates
---
Here's the thing... If you wanted a "little war," then you wouldn't have deployed 1300 Titans, 1300 Supers, 1300 faxes and 500 others support capitals...
---
Also, why would anyone put a good fight up against goons?  This would provide reason for goons to move their shit half way across the universe again at a later time in search of that same good fight.  
---
The same thing happened back in the days of B.O.B. control.  Smart groups just stopped fighting them except in small specialized groups picking off the idiots.  This is currently the only way to fight goons as well.
---
Honestly, I applaud the goons in their use of the system to make it work best for them but I really do think it is killing this game we all love. Oh well off to wormholes.  Oh wait goons kick that sandcastle over from time to time too.
---
The point is, if you were maximizing isk, then you were already setting out a circle, mapping all sigs you saw in something like Tripwire (so you don't lose them if you have to log off, or if DT hits), and just going around and around scanning down all the new sigs that popped up. This change doesn't significantly effect this playstyle, it allows you to cross out certain pockets and you might be able to slightly increase your isk/hr but it won't be a huge change. 
---
I honestly think it will barely make any difference, I forget to insure 9 out of 10 ships or sometimes I just don’t care..
---
Awesome work. Great video. We need more people like you in Eve.
---
That requires logging in tho
---
par quality UI then?
---
Wow man good job!!! I may not understand your playstyle but , you put a lot of work into your profession and this video. No one can deny your talent. Keep up the good work 💪👌👍
---
Sure, can Noraus do something about the botting problem in FRT?
---
Our downvotes will blot out the sun.
---
Fair enough, 
---
I would personally love them to remove insurance completely. Like I said We need more isk sinks.
---
This was just an idea of at least Helping that situation. Instead of making it worse by providing isk.
---
Resubbing 6 accounts.
---
.. says the alliance that spent the last year renting space to KWG.
---
I mean, camping relic sites in ships like that is not a new idea. Just go exploring in stain and you'll see how that plays out, I've been attacked by everything from a solo astero to a nemsis with black ops battleships on the other side of a cyno while in a helios before, and everything in between.
---
The problem with astero is they have a 6 second window to cloak up before your targeting resets from decloaking. So you won't actually kill much. The best way is a dictor (sit at 3km off a can, cloaked, and use the bubble to prevent them from warping while you go for decloak), although I am not too sure if a dictor would kill a dual deadspace rep injector fit astero. Another option is a stealth bomber, since nothing will be able to escape before its locked unless they have superhuman reflexes (and you can just get right on top of them to decloak if they try cloaking) although the bomber can only go for t2 exploration ships or shitfit asteroes by itself, it needs some backup to take on bigger stuff.
---
Yes but that ship in the video is a Garmur
---
I need your votes. I am Xenuria.
---
Yeah I’m the same, and unless it is t1 it isn’t worth it. 
---
The only time I know of it being well worth it is suicide capitals.
---
CCP baiting us with free downvotes. Well played CCP well played.
---
you gonna get my vote.
---
Remember the days when things were lucrative because they were hard and it took time and effort to get good at them. 
---
That is what gets player hooked.
---
Thank you. A lot of what you said provides the kind of perspective needed to not make the entry back into the game feel overwhelming but also not so specific that it's boring to read haha.
---
Judging by [the post from earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bsfss9/this_is_not_a_moon/?st=jw2myhj6&amp;sh=8607e2aa), reporting that they undocked 4800 Capital ships at once... I don't think Insurance refunds are a vital portion of their income. They can clearly afford to buy / build a LOT of stuff, so they're doing pretty well financially.
---
There definitely do need to be some ISK sinks, especially aimed at the bigger Alliances. Solo players, little corps, small fish in general... The universe is getting too expensive for these people to really even function without PLEX'ing their brains out. And the big fish obviously have too damned much money, if they can undock 4,800 Capitals. Anyone remember the good old days, when (a) Capital ship was a legendary occurrence? When CCP put up a memorial for the first Titan ever killed? And now... they can undock 4,800 of the suckers just b/c they're bored and they wanna go ruin somebody's day.
---
Incursions are an ISK faucet. Rorq bots are an ISK faucet. PLEX and Injectors are ISK faucets. Too many (easily macro'd) things are pouring money ~~into the economy~~ straight into the big fish' wallets. We don't need an ISK sink, we need an ISK black hole.
---
yes give us space segways and  space skateboards
---
Yes in null and lowsec all the time
---
Watching you decloak that Widow hit me straight in the heart. I really miss blopsing with Gulnar. :(
---
If they wanted to “fix” exploration, they could have just put a few commodities with market demand in data sites.
---
LAWN
---
If they keep with the structures, an observatory could be used to either add or remove local in k-space, which could spice things up.
---
So Test is Eve's second largest alliance with a comfortable supercap umbrella and a solid alliance with goons.
---
And also a poor fragile underdog in constant fear of eviction by imaginary enemies.
---
Sad.
---
I'll happily endorse a vote for stitch on this one. Great content creator with solid knowledge of mechanics and great balance ideas.
---
I usually have the attention span of a toddler when watching eve videos, but this was an easy watch. Great job and good luck with the CSM elections! 
---
One small bit of constructive feedback: be careful with the music volume when speaking, it's mostly good but there are a few moments where it's a bit too loud and overpowering your talking (for example at 09:48-09:58)
---
Let's say I'm not looking to maximise isk (I wouldn't bother salvaging L4s in hisec if I was) but the other guy running sites in the same area as me is. I bumble around with no planned route, hoping to find a system with several sigs in. The other guy looks at the map, sees where the concentrations of sigs ares, and heads straight there. The odds of me rolling into the good system are low as I'm just drifting about, while the odds of the other guy hitting it is good because he's headed straight there.
---
We can pretend it doesn't affect casual players but in reality, this change affects everyone looking to run sites whether they know it or not. 
---
One upside is the opportunity to look for systems with lots of sites, wait for someone to warp to the last one, and gank them for the loot.
---
KWG will pay anyone to not be attacked/invaded. If FRT owned the space surrounding Omist they'd be paying FRT.
---
Hey man. I voted for you last year and was disappointed af when people who purchased votes beat you to the council. IDK if it would have mattered a lot, but it was your spot. I hope I can represent blopsers and hunters this year, or at least someone can.
---
Thanks! I was an idiot and didn't backup some of the editing in the sub components of the video. If there are parts where the music is too loud, that's because I was too lazy to spend an additional 5 hours. I probably should have.
---
Even if he was in WH's alone, that is better then him NOT playing period since 03.
---
ypu know why they made the PI changes last year? because Hilmar most likey hurt his wrist setting up colonies and went 'well this sucks'
---
A lot of ships are like this. Its so if they change the ships hardpoint layout they do not have to go back and redesign the ship.
---
Systems with lots of sigs rarely have lots of relic sites. After this change they will be even less likely to, because all the relics sites in a system like that will have been done, so they will be a lot more spread out. 
---
You're less likely to find a system with 5 relics in it, sure, but you're average relic sites/hr won't change to much because they respawn pretty quickly.
---
Really nice video. How have the rorqual changes and the fall in excavator prices affected the sustainability of your operations, if at all - do you still rely on drone booshing to keep all those accounts subbed?
---
GL with the CSM run!
---
YAWN
---
Im using woke in the alt right sense of mocking the left which is in of itself also ironic. Im just trying to be edgy man
---
Excellent.
---
Like most of CCP dev time spent.
---
And your meatshield alliance is sov wanding delve, wonder who will burn out first. Hint: not Goons
---
&gt;What if the reason is dependent on VPNs?
---
what if what reason is dependent on VPNs
---
What if no more supers could be built.  The ones we have now would be it.
---
LAWN.... xD
---
&gt; they can automatically connect the information of what you were doing and the like/dislike
---
I mean.. they apparently arent able to filter out the"players" orbiting hubs 24/7 so i doubt that they "connect informations" with your downvote on sisi...
---
Not at all. I'm all for napalm for botters. I just saying there are sometimes other reasons™ their removal not being expedient...
---
Idk if they forgot about it or it is delayed, but I see nothing about flagging people doing T4/5 Abyssal sites in HS
---
I remember testing POS starburst with a sieged dread. That was fun. The dread would go on and on for a few thousand kilometres.
---
Was going to post something similar. Worth pointing out bob died because one person defected - the odds of that re-occurring are quite slim I think.
---
Insurance should just be removed its retarded, the premiums simply do not match the payouts made.
---
You are great Olmeca.
---
Awesome job!
---
Meanwhile:  Hilmar "i think we need to make eve scary again..."
---
This has me more hyped than the invasion cinematic. Please keep doing gods work.
---
Can this be combined with the new pointer window?
---
Learn what a isk faucet actually is before bitching. I wont argue that isk sinks are needed, but from what you listed only Incursion is an Isk faucet. Neither Mining, nor plex introduce isk to the economy, they just transfer it from a to b
---
Ignorant of the world outside what you can see.
---
I’ll give you credit for putting together a quality video and the effort you put in shows. 
---
With that said the narrative you start laying out regarding “whaling” is severely misguided. All of the “op-success” footage reference in this video is of Delve, a place you can’t jump a gate without tripping over some idiot in a shitfit Hel or group of afk rorquals. There isn’t any evidence or elaboration on the significant amount of effort needed for proper “whaling” because you don’t need proper effort for Delve. The amount of legwork, analysis, data accumulation, research, Intel, etc. needed for regions other than Delve is mind boggling and I seriously doubt you would be successful in other areas.
---
You are very misleading in your message and then this “documentary” rolls into the typical Olmeca tinfoil grr goons GSM narrative like we are out to get you. You even somehow manage to manipulate the changes CCP made with NSA and Rorqual nerfs a “pro-umbrella” argument point. What??
---
**Pros:** Good quality, good footage, nice music.
---
**Cons:** It is all fluff for a multiboxer with bad opinions and false identity of being a real “whaler”.
---
3 of them were gate camping in Impass, almost clapped their Sabre with my ratting VNI and got away as he jumped gate and couldn’t keep me bubbled, then they were flaming me and one of them said “thanks for faction drones btw” I had some faction warriors that cost me like 10mil lol.. 
---
Does that answer your question?
---
What? You're saying people can't afford a 12 dollar monthly sub but can afford to game for 55 hours a month? Lol, give me a break mate
---
When I did it I would recruit randoms from NPC corps, invite them to my chat channel and hand out fit t1 attack frigs to roam the Caldari/Gallente FW zone.  
---
It went from roaming with 1 or 2 people to growing to having a gang of 10 or so as the months past. If I recall correctly I did it once or twice a week for almost a year. 
---
My tip is be organized, do it often, and be patient as you may only be 1 or 2 people at the start but will grow with time and your reputation.
---
no u.
---
Definatly R&amp;K level, and as a wormholer and long-time whaler, you've got my vote
---
You forgot: "pretending to fight a war against botters while supporting/housing one of the most known bottingroups for longer than the  bad botting enemies are on tq"
---
Hey bud. Just try less hard for once and enjoy the content that everyone else seems to be believing to be good.
---
Sold!  
---
Love it amigo!
---
I’ve heard so too, but personally I don’t fly capitals so I wouldn’t know, but I agree with what you said unless it’s a t1 ship not really worth it, I mean anything cruiser isn’t really worth it either..
---
This reminded me, we went on a praxis suicide fleet and the FC told us to insure our ships and I hear in comms “But Fc the payout is 1isk” lol.
---
While I love the idea of 64 bits I'll refrain from having it until mandatory because CCP is known for its bugs and how long it takes to fix them.
---
What if bots are extra difficult to ban because of VPNs.
---
You can ban VPNs from being used to connect to eve.
---
ITT Cry babies doom saying as always.
---
Too late, it’s turned into a black hole and is being lewded by the internet. Quick, feed it upvotes before it eats us all in a fiery inferno the likes of which F1 monkeys could not witness without staying at their PC throughout the whole day-long battle.
---
And the vote bots are ready
---
It would be easy to find keywords in player feedback though, right? If players were allowed to write comments regardless of upvote/downvote, the general response can be seen through the keywords and CCP can get a rough idea of what the player base thinks, add that to the forums and I think it’s a robust system.
---
Any idea what this will do to multiple clients running? Better or worse?
---
TIL. Guess they'll have to move to highsec then :)
---
...but does it ask you why? Useless if not lol
---
Ccp listens to bug reports?
---
&gt; I am just curious why so many care of you don’t like it don’t use it problem solved
---
You could say the same about any cancerous tool, like ECM, or off grid links, or anything else. It's a dumb argument - the problem is that the tool is available and that changes the game.
---
"Botters are bad, but its ok if we get paid by them. Thus we protect them"
---
Stop the updating and changing the mechanics. I'm so tired of keeping track of whats what. Just revert the game to how it was 5 years ago. I'm ok with destroyable structures cuz killmails are awesome. sbu's tcu's ihub's all of it. stop messing up the game. a good idea in theory doesn't mean it's good in practice.
---
Funny, there were definitely TEST tickers defending it last time it came under attack. Must've been my imagination i guess?
---
çok güzel olmuş eline sağlık
---
\&gt;bbbbut you got the numbers a little wrong!!
---
I was pondering the Trig thing. What I would love to see would be them basically pick areas of EVE with lots of activity, mainly nullsec actually, and start "invading". They basically turn up and use that big mothership to start murderfucking structures. Give the big mothership some sort of titan eating laser. They will slowly eat up all the citadels in an area if left unchecked and require a huge effort to stop. They get drawn to high APM/high mining etc. They turn up to kick sandcastles over. They want to bring balance. Maybe they invade jita every so often and just destroy any ships in local.
---
I hate to judge before all the facts are in, but it seems you are a turbo nerd. I like it. Good luck on your campaign.
---
So you’ve never heard of other countries? You know lots of people play in areas where paying real currency for a sub is outlandishly expensive. Get some perspective. Sorry for your ignorance. I vaguely remember being a toddler. It’s a scary world out there when you don’t know anything.
---
&gt;What if bots are extra difficult to ban because of VPNs.
---
bots aren't easier or harder to catch because of VPNs- you can just ban individuals easier
---
&gt;You can ban VPNs from being used to connect to eve.
---
you can't
---
I see what you did there, substituting a new word for the "P" in "PL!"
---
You're so clever.
---
Easily the only fight*
---
FTFY
---
Your video gave me chills..  Got my vote!
---
Counterbaited git gud
---
It's NPCs. They're as much a threat to Eve as, say, the Burning Legion is to WoW. A plot device for those who care about the lore (myself included), and tantalising loot to the rest.
---
No. We are are currently in talks to see if a merge into PH is possible and if current leadership is willing to let Gobbins run the show as he is more in tune with the current Eve meta and politics.
---
Bots can be harder to detect because VPN's allow "load-balancing" of bots. So you dont really see maybe 50 clients connecting from the same IP.
---
Why cant you firewall all known VPN address ranges?
---
&gt; Why cant you firewall all known VPN address ranges?

the issue is that you can't know all vpn address ranges.

implying you can't obtain many ip addresses from your ISP

No threat NAT all, it's just more pve, stacked on top of all the other pve in the game, some of which is broken or so old that it no longer makes sense.

Deplexing in a venture is even more mind numbingly boring than mining. He can fly any number of cheap frigates like a tristan or kestrel and oplex, maybe even learn to pvp. Venture deplexing is like top 3 worst suggestions for a newbro in the entire game
---
I understand where you're coming from. But do you not hear what I'm saying? If you can spend 55+ hours gaming then you can spend a few of those working some shit part time job to pay for a sub. If you're in a position where you can spend that much time gaming and can't afford a sub you shouldn't be gaming, you should be working. Cue the downvotes
---
&gt;as he is more in tune with the current Eve meta and politics.
---
Unironically true
---
This video is better than all of your posts. I enjoyed it until you reverted to type and started whining and it turned into an al gore presidential campaign

TL;DR Bad bait.
---
PL has actually turned around a lot in the last year, they have got rid of all the dead weight of shit corps like nesw and busa and have merged into one large corp under herr hedliner
---
Make an alt, join horde, ping and FC.
---
Also, what countries are you talking about? How much of the game's population is actually from those areas?
---
How?
---
Really nice of this girl to help you for the audio
---
I just group them and drag them
---
&gt;A titan with a cyno can die
---
Tbf, only if it's afk or outside jump range.
---
That actually sounds quite nice..
---
Sitch / Olmeca / Blood Ruin for CSM.
---
Correct ;)
---
Due to the state of the the CSM and the game, I decided against running again. You have my votes and also my gratitude for sacrificing your sanity and time for the rest of us!
---
this will be a interessting subreddit if we only get screenshots of a tethered super fleet and videos when a cap jump to another system... ohw and dont forget the coms! NEVER FORGETTT THEEH COOMMZZ!!!!11!!!!111
---
It was a feature added to sell $40 trousers.. good riddance too it.
---
ITT: smugposting
---
We get it, guys. You mined a lot and built many titans. So long as you have fun!
---
&gt;the issue is that you can't know all vpn address ranges.
---
So the problem isnt that it cant be done, but the fact that some info might be unavailable. That can be solved over time. If that info were available, would you agree that it should be done?
---
&gt;implying you can't obtain many ip addresses from your ISP
---
You can get say a /22?
---
&gt;your meatshield alliance  
---
All Imperium members are equal (except Bastion, they're a bit less equal). We don't have a meatshield alliance.
---
Too funny 😂
---
This all sounds like carebear-talk, to be honest.
---
It is all a conspiracy!  And I can prove it!
---
It’s definitely doable but I would recommend joining a Corp and having people you can fly with. You will be at a disadvantage for solo but in a gang a t2 fit frigate with decent skills can make a difference
---
Even tho I’m an Imperium member , and mostly just enjoying my holidays with couple of friends (mostly dying , but fun anyway ) with ability for great incomes , I have noticed this type of shit even in 2017 . In this time I have just moved to Delve , and basically decided to try out the whole mining thing , trained and bought a Rork ( trained mining barges on my 5 alts , so I mostly focus on protection not on money  , including an fax alt) and basically started making money in safest way possible . Meanwhile in the rest of the Delve supers crabs without ozone to lit a cynos , and big miners just thanos snap entire asteroid fields with 50 rorks with passive fit , without any fax . For me , this not just  means  that this is idioticy of some of man , but also because in clear sly of Delve , under supercap golden shield , everybody forgot that this is eve god dammit . They ratting like it’s some kind of the high sec on steroids . We forget what is paranoia and fear of being caught , and thanks to your effort , you helping us unwear this pink-rainbow glasses that showing us happy ponyland of friendship .  
---
P.S Without a doubt , one of the best eve videos I have seen in this year .
---
Only if they really attack everything in the game.  Otherwise it is just another PVE event like incursions are now.  My thoughts at least...
---
&gt;So the problem isnt that it cant be done, but the fact that some info might be unavailable. That can be solved over time. If that info were available, would you agree that it should be done?
---
No, because many more players utilize vpns legitimately, and many players play exclusively with vpns
---
it's a problem for multiple issues
---
&gt;You can get say a /22?
---
what?
---
Hunting capital kills and targeting an alliance are two different things, I have participated in both styles. When you hunt a region, spend months studying and logging enemy supers / rorquals, analyze their activity time, and move dreads 2 mids deep into enemy territory to sit in space for days, and do this with a handful of people then you can talk to me about *elite whaling*.
---
Also stop referencing that titan kill as “under the umbrella” it was next door through a gate which is a huge difference than being in jump range.
---
Core, is that you?
---
HON HON HONNNNNN
---
More rats to kill that's all
---
Then where should i keep all my shit? in HS? whats the difference? shit, HS is friggen more dangerous than nul anyway.
---
News Flash: The vast majority of people arent going to store shit in citadels that dont have access safety. If cits stop providing it people will start storing all their shit in NPC stations in nul. and in the areas where that isnt a thing people will put only tiny stock piles of crap they need in cits and have it shipped in as needed. Asset security isnt a problem when compared to the actual major issues going on right now.
---
No I’m not core
---
a true hero of eve.
---
Great, now I need to see my doctor about an erection lasting longer than 4 hours
---
Horrible change.
---
TAQOSTAR, at least spell it right.
---
Click Click Click
---
Stagnant gameplay, citadel spam, turtling, and super blocs (im in one) are the problem. Local has nothing to do with this.
---
in another convo i'm having in this thread people are blaming asset safety. jesus christ guys NOT THE ISSUE.
---
I want to be hopeful. I want to for the sake of EVE. History says otherwise though. Maybe playing the game instead of just managing the company has shaken something loose he hasn't felt for a while. 
---
Definitely being a wee bit optimistic with that statement. EVE needs change.
---
Thanks!
---
The volume change decreased my roaming speed from 8.3 to 5.5. It's not lethal but it's significant. 
---
The price changes, along with people becoming less afk, took my isk/hr from 7b to about 4b.  I don't do as much stealing anymore, as I don't have anything else to spend a lot of money. I did get lots of Naglfars and, recently, afk campers. I'll just focus on maintaining them now, which is like 5-6 hours of work every month (plus I lose a lot of dreads, so maybe make it 10-15).
---
http://prntscr.com/nt13qb

Yes, you are missing something. It shows the actual sig type if you are 1 jump out, and just the number of sigs if further out. This makes watching for new wormholes very easy, as you just scan down your whole area, then use the Agency Intel Network to watch for any new sigs that pop up while you're krabbing. Making space safer for Rorquals since they can easily watch for new holes popping.
---
Haha yeah I love making fun of Africans xD💯👌
---
And if I'm ignorant, inform me. Tell me how much "outlandishly expensive" a sub is in terms of the areas you're talking about. Otherwise sit down and shut the fuck up because you know I'm speaking sense.
---
Scan your consultation, head to your krabbing system, fire up the Agency Intel Network and watch for new sigs, run and check them with your alt and know instantly if you've been rolled into.
---
vGood
---
From testing, apparently not.
---
We osrs now
---
It is also pure pandering. The Agency Scanning charges show that much.
---
So its okay because frat would do the same?
---
If i read the Patch notes correctly they will only invade Highsec for now, so they might stand a chance if we cant use capitals
---
Ah ... that would be useful.
---
Maybe even a survey:  'How could we improve your destruction experience?'
---
CC: damage dealers on killmail.
---
I think I've seen something like that via Eve-mail from CODE. and / or Wingspan Delivery ('thank you for your business').
---
same
---
If anyone asks why no one wants to fight link them this dscan.
---
Ah, another exciting chapter in the Great War of Anchoring Mechanics.
---
&gt; Also stop referencing that titan kill as “under the umbrella” it was next door through a gate which is a huge difference than being in jump range.
---
Nah, I didn't refer to Fountain kills (or the most recent ones we killed during deployment).
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76385004/
---
&gt; where they are a rarity.
---
So Delve is full of titans which makes it easier for us. You logic would imply people would kill them left and right, right? But somehow nobody killed a Delve titan for over 1.5 years before us. Basically since PL dreadbombs stopped working. 
---
&gt; When you hunt a region, spend months studying and logging enemy supers / rorquals, analyze their activity time, and move dreads 2 mids deep into enemy territory to sit in space for days, and do this with a handful of people
---
Bro this all sounds pretty mundane tbh.
---
Would be more interesting if NancyDock, pathetic legion and sPaiHorde actually fought. 
---
But we are happy to glass their space while they eat out ass.
---
It honestly doesn't matter when you take into account that jackasses can right now cargo scan every can in a relic and data site and cherry pick. That is about as non-exploration as I can think of. The cans should not be scannable forcing you to hack them all.  Having some intel on what systems have cosmic signatures isn't going to change Null one bit. That information is already know by the sigs and often times reported in Intel.
---
Reading your post I get the impression you have blue balls
---
they're also quite retarded.
---
wormholer btw
---
With regards to the stealth bomber instalock. The solution to that is a Burst Jammer or ECM drones if you ship flies them.
---
What is this nonsense? You're not supposed to enjoy playing EVE.
---
&gt; Kinetic ammo?  What are you talking about? I brought thermal!
---
r/EvE_irl
---
Nope,  it's not double  - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing - it's 256 TiB.
---
old dead meme for an old dead game.
---
Which is why you fit a sebo to the bomber. Nemesis and manticore can do 2 scrams, mwd, and sebo easily enough. Use it with scanres to get the initial lock faster than switch to eccm
---
Weaponized Autism, Only Autism.

I have no idea how it's going to work.

[youtube TiS vid of just as the test started](https://youtu.be/qJbRb3-bGF0?t=4457)

Hahahahah! Wonder what the bots will vote daily.
---
Are these rules for PL? Considering goons are instructed to use the ingame report system
---
Daily downvote Bot hears you
---
4d chess.
---
f for the pubbie
---
That was spectacular. Thank you dude.
---
They are basically like your end-game raids in other mmos.
---
EVE is fuckin being killed
---
ffs
---
A 5 hour long video 
---
Couldn’t find the trailer and being on mobile is not easy fast forwarding. Anyone have a time stamp or link to the trailer?
---
&gt; we lacked force projection?
---
What game are you playing?
---
Do u no de wae to Tribute?
---
I should join Bastion to got gud. Inceptionflairbait
---
That was fucking awesome!
---
You have my votes, you are exactly the kind of person CSM and EVE in general needs. 
---
&gt; Are the Triglavians an actual threat? 
---
Only if they can [climb stairs](https://www.pinkandgreene.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/0/001_196.jpg).
---
As long as I can keep my own doctor
---
As long as the taxes keep flowing?
---
I hope they Will Maybe it Will fix some over production or something and Bring some change to null
---
There shouldn't be insurance. At all.
---
There could be some performance improvements due to changes in optimization.
---
Whether we'll notice is another issue.
---
I'm pretty sure they don't disable virtual memory.
---
(Your performance will suck if you do hit that though)
---
It was my corps farewell fleet after leaving BRAVE and we were just in kitchen sink nonsense we had left in GE. The inhib was to protect us from Brave caps and then our resident mad man suprised everyone (Including us) with the bloody Hel. :D
---
Im so confused
---
life.....life finds a way
---
Some aspects will be better.  Some will be worse.  Probably not a huge change unless you exceed your computer's physical RAM, and 64-bit clients will use somewhere around 50% more RAM.
---
true for PI,but making SOV changes and never fought a SOV war is kinda elephant in ceramic store moment :D
---
*woosh*
---
I know some of these words.
---
I brought it up to the team responsible for this and gave my feedback and linked all the community threads, they said they would take it into consideration, seems like they decided to launch this without any changes, and are going to see what happens.   
---
I highly recommend everyone who dislikes this change posts on the official eve online forums in the official Invasion feedback thread (if/when that thread goes up).
---
&gt; A factor is development takes a lot of time, especially working with a legacy codebase like they have (speaking from experience). The time it takes to QA any major changes (like, say, the recent changes to wardec mechanics) is probably on the order of a months because a simple change can have a rippling effect.
---
They don't care about QA, they kept pushing stupid mechanics and broken shits even so people were showing them it would be a mistake.
---
Every guys with a brain turned on knew from day 1 that citadels were going to be a pain in the ass.
---
This is a very good video, and the CSM definitely needs more balance and more non-krab representatives.
---
Yes asset security ties hand in hand with unabated ratting. See what your brain doesnt understand is space is even more meaningless If you dont have to protect muh stuff. 
---
I do wish npc stations were still there to offer some folks the ability to keep their shit in nullsec they also gotta face risk (or win the station back) to get their stuff. 
---
But if you dont think safely parking fleets of titans isnt an issue you're absolutely brain dead. There should certainly be risk owning major cap fleets.
---
Appreciate the good vibes o7
---
And people who actually hunt anything else got shafted because now you can instantly see a new potential wormhole spawn within 5-10js of your rorquals. This is honestly worse than the HIC nerf before they made the mass entangler.
---
F for the structure bashing dick riding f1 monkey.
---
Genuinely fascinating video start to finish
---
I dont do video's so I've always had to try and explain what you illustrate about saving bookmarks and probing targets.
---
You get some of the very best anger when you follow that line of bookmarks to its end and unwrap your present.
---
Good vid bud.
---
&gt; IMHO CCP should make the game more realistic.
---
Noone care
---
sneaky flair change
---
This is not a Liberation, it's a Rule, dying beyond the pale.
---
The word retard offends you? Good
---
July 2029
---
your flair on this subreddit SUCKS LMAO
---
Tinfoil hat stopped your brain from external interferences, it doesn't inhibit your temporal lobe
---
I miss back when you had to scan to even see if sigs existed, and then they still had flavor of "gravimetric" etc. Not everything needs to be constantly dumbed down.
---
So absolutely nothing’s changed?
---
