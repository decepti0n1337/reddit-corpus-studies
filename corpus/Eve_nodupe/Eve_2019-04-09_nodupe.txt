Unfortunately everything that happened is within the EULA that everyone agrees to when starting up the game. They can discontinue service for any reason, they own the likeness of your character/account, and they can post information of your account with exception of personal information. They can also provide you notice of a ban via posting on their website if they so choose. Within their EULA they didn't defame him at all, they used the information that they own the rights to, Brisc decided it was a good idea to tie his personal/professional life to the property of CCP.
---

---
It sucks when we lose content creators of any sort and is unhealthy for the game, but there really isn't much that can be done aside from Brisc trying to have a civil conversation with CCP and getting to the bottom of it on his own. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out if at all beyond where it currently stands. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Some copy/paste of the relevant EULA:
---
A. By CCP for Termination of the Game
---
CCP does not guarantee that it will continue to offer access to the System or support the Game. CCP may, in its sole discretion, cease to provide any or all of the services offered in connection with EVE (including access to the System and any or all features or components of the Game), terminate the EULA, close all Accounts and cancel all of the rights granted to you under the EULA. CCP may communicate such termination to you upon 30 days’ notice in any of the following manners: (i) when you log into your Account; (ii) in a notice on CCP's website; (iii) via electronic mail; or (iv) in another manner that CCP deems suitable to inform you of the termination. If CCP terminates the EULA pursuant to this section, you will not receive a refund of any fees.
---
B. Rights to Certain Content
---
You have no interest in the value of your time spent playing the Game, for example, by the building up of the experience level of your character and the items your character accumulates during your time playing the Game. Your Account, and all attributes of your Account, including all corporations, actions, groups, titles and characters, and all objects, currency and items acquired, developed or delivered by or to characters as a result of play through your Accounts, are the sole and exclusive property of CCP, including any and all copyrights and intellectual property rights in or to any and all of the same, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.
---
Without limiting its rights in any way, and subject to the other terms of the EULA, CCP shall have the right to display and publish any information (except certain personal information in your Account) relating to any character in your Account, for example, in charts, lists and other compilations, without notice or any compensation to you whatsoever.
---
You hereby irrevocably and without additional consideration beyond the rights granted to you herein, assign to CCP any and all right, title and interest you have, including copyrights, in or to any and all information you exchange, transmit or upload to the System or while playing the Game, including without limitation all files, data and information comprising or manifesting corporations, groups, titles, characters and other attributes of your Account, together with all objects and items acquired or developed by, or delivered by or to characters, in your Account. To the extent that any such rights are not assignable, you hereby grant CCP an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, assignable, royalty-free license, fully sub-licensable through multiple tiers, to exercise all intellectual property and other rights, in and to all or any part of such information, in any medium now known or hereafter developed. The foregoing assignment and license in this paragraph shall not include User Content (defined below).

We probably won't ever know specifics. It had to do with leaking information that was under NDA.
---
That prime minister is still in our senate, that "replacement" is our president ( icelandic president has almost no power and he replaced the guy that had been our president for 20 years and is a pretty good guy).  The constitution hasnt changed and hasmt been voted on by the people. I dont believe people got compensated although our economy has been getting stronger(until the wow air thing). A few bankers were actually jailed and the jail they went to is an open prison(basically a summer camp they can't leave too far away from).
---
Sorry we didn't censor things to your taste, we will upgrade our title from moderators to gestapo.
---
&gt; their level of influence is so far away from their US counterparts.
---
&gt; Lobbyists have a ton of influence in the EU.
---
These two statements are not contradictory.
---
I dunno, when was the last time someone successfully sued CCP for being banned?
---
If u are from a Schengen country come right in
---
Sorry OOTL here what was judgment day
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **6th Cakeday** Ladeuche! ^(hug)

This just in: "Video Games ruined my life" New anti-gaming lobbyist speaks up on the horrors of online gaming.
---
I want to move to Iceland...
---
I’ll give you some silver to change your mind?
---
Are you telling me that American politicians might not be the brightest?
---
We almost defintely won't get one. Anything under NDA (which is what was leaked) will be kept there.
---
Theoretically in however many years the relevant NDA expires we could be informed at that time, but there's no guarantee. CCP won't disclose anything even then, we'd have to hear about it from CSM members whose NDAs have expired on the matter.
---
Nobody is disputing the ban here. Its about the public spectacle CCP did out of this that is the point of order.
---
If I was innocent and working in government spheres and someone accused me of breaking a contract... I think getting in front of a judge would be my first priority.
---
:okhand:
---
the day the Judge transferred all of C02's assets to Goons
---
\#nocollusion
---
Where in his statement did he employ whataboutism?
---
That's step 1.  produce no breach of contract.   step 2. sue for defamation - his character and finances are impacted by such allegations which they published.
---
Never will
---
K
---
Ah I remember that, never knew that was the name for it. 😂
---
They didn’t drag it through the mud. They stated what are, to the best of our knowledge, hard facts. If he believes the allegations are untrue, then he should file suit and prove that CCP wronged him. Until such time as that happens, I believe CCP.
---
We aren't allowed that anymore, saying ok is just another way of expressing WHITE POWER, all we can say is praise bernie
---
Plenty of 19 year old college students can end up as unpaid super testers for up and coming games. I imagine it happens. Not necessarily often, but it's not something that damages you forever.
---
Having already made a career out of building trust, running in-game on a campaign of that very idea, and then breaking that very trust? Holy bad ideas, Batman.
---
Not only that, but he *ran on the campaign of being a politician*.
---
I'm disappointed but honestly not surprised.
---
Yes on second thoughts let's not elect him let's elect yet another nullsec man, you know, for variety.
---
Ah the trump tactic- deflection
---
the titan is the biggest overpriced toy.
---
and you wont and are not entitled to see it
---
If he does sue CCP the evidence will then become public until then they wont share it with the world
---
Yes. Also keep in mind that sometime this summer or shortly after there will be more drone implants in the game and the current ones may undergo some changes. The current drone HP implants are not worth using due to the DPS loss, but it may change.
---
As far as alternatives go, you can fly different ships now but they are more filament type limited. Vedmaks, Sacrilege for example are excellent for Electrical and Fire. Sac, Cerberus for Dark. Phantasm, Zealot for Electrical, Ishtars Cerb for exotic.
---
Nah. It'd be nice if it was, cause it's kinda scary thinking that all you invest in something - even a game - can be yoinked without any recompense. But it's similar to renting a property:
---
* You pay your month's rent, you get to live there for the month. Stop paying (or break any of the rules, or the landlord doesn't fancy renewing your lease) and you're evicted with no claim to ownership of the property.
---
* You invest money in the property, putting up nice wallpaper or upgrading the shower, and that makes it nicer for you while you live there, but it doesn't give you any right to remain when your rental period expires, and you're not due any refund for those expenses when you're kicked out just because you couldn't rip out the plumbing.
---
Obviously there's more fine print when it comes to renting property than renting access to a game, but even at that level it removes any real option to claim rights to the game/character based on prior payments. I think that's where we all go wrong: we think we own our accounts, characters, etc., but in reality we're renting (or borrowing, for the Alphas down the back) the right to access them and ownership of all pixels remains in CCP's hands.
---
What spectacle?
---
The same one done for any csm?
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cmyz6/ankhesentapemkah_removed_from_the_csm_due_to_a/
---
It does not, they changed that requirement a while back. For instance, if that were true, it is highly unlikely that Aryth would run, as he takes great strides to avoid his name being released.
---
Cause no attorney ever has broken any laws lolz
---
Additionally, as far as I know most of the money from that sale went straight back into other titans (of the more affordable variety) for himself and his corp mates. He had 20 orders for titan hulls lined up that he was producing at more or less build cost. So if his "secret intel" was a titan nerf, he's really responding to it in a weird way.
---
...bruh... he was your guy

Distribution missions are only useful to raise your standings, that's it. Their income is crap.

seize the means of balance
---
Noobman was perma banned for nda breach without monetary aspects involved. Nda breach is nda breach irrespective of reason, and in the past has been a permanent ban. As it should be.
---
If he's just loose lipped, or breached it with good intentions, even without people acting on that information, it would and has been a perma ban before. He's not the first.
---
The CSM, or 'council of stellar management', is a group of players elected by the playerbase to serve as an interface with CCP, the developers. The CSM brings concerns from the playerbase to CCP, and CCP uses the CSM as a sounding board for player reactions to development ideas.
---
As part of their duties, the CSM is necessarily privy to confidential information, such as upcoming balance changes, anti-cheating efforts by CCP, and the like. Needless to say, this sort of info could be used to very great effect to give player organizations unfair ingame advantages. Therefore, CSM members have to sign an NDA saying that they agree to not leak insider information.
---
Here, CCP is swinging an epic banhammer at a CSM member who apparently thought the rules didn't apply to him and passed on info to his alliance mates allowing them to gain said unfair advantages and make piles of ingame currency. He denies everything, of course, but the general sentiment is ... not favorable to him.
---
Yes, that's it.  Unknown stranger on the internet knows my intentions and thoughts so well.  I appreciate you reminding me of what i really think and feel.  Thanks!
---
A salvager is one option. Or a firework launcher.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Dude his in game name is his real life name he kind of put himself there
---
You can accept something as factually accurate without liking it.
---
I fall down a lot and hate gravity with a passion, but doesn't mean I can claim it doesn't exist. Or well, I could, but that'd make me a fucking moron as well as clumsy!
---
Ah got it thanks for explaining
---
Who hurt you?
---
How many defamation cases have you litigated? Which states?
---
Lol sounds just like r/The_Donald . Maybe they should make a r/TheBrisc and circle jerk there.
---
Don’t really know him but I never got that impression from his post’s or on streams.
---
How many defamation cases have you litigated?
---
How so? Shouldn't Brisc be held to the same standards as everyone else?
---
Not entirely, there are level 3 pirate epic arcs,  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Epic\_arcs](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Epic_arcs)  see here. The empire epic arcs are the ones off limits. You can do the rest.
---
*quotes texan law on Icelandic company*
---
When  you type in his irl name into Google, this is the first thing that comes up and its irrelevant who linked his IRL name to his ingame alias. CCP knew that the "allegations" can be traced back to him IRL yet they still did it like they did. I dont care whenever he is banned or not, I just secretly hope he is indeed innocent so CCP and a lot ppl on this sup can eat manure.
---
Oooh May do a firework launcher, may I ask though, what use do you find for a salvager? I mean Granted I do bounce out as soon as soon as it looks like trouble, but I never see any wrecks in a normal venture out to null or j-space
---
I agree. This seems well written and like a well thought out response. I don't see how he's trying to deny and deflect anywhere.
---
This is a Discord channel too
---
dcvamd-meetup
---
And most of the Danes in England would be considered Norwegian.
---
Because its a eula, not a court document. They just said he violated it. They get the right to do that when he signed it. 
---
He went so deep in linking his real life that his eve sauce spilled into it. So ccp didnt defame anyone, they said this guy broke nda, hes banned, litteraly said the character name (which jappens to be his actual fucking name). Thats all.
---
Ugh, a *cargo scanner* I can’t believe you’d put that on a ship ever, what a bad player 
---
/s
---
Tying this to himself IRL might be actually the best thing he did should he be actually innocent. Cuz he has a chance to get this into court.
---
It's almost as if the position of comments changes over time. SHOCK
---
If you're in your own space, you can use it to shoot cans that aren't worth hacking
---
&gt; and they cannot disclose the info as well because another NDA is on them.
---
Generally not true. A judge *can* seal court records, but he would need needs a really good reason to and there isn't one here.
---
it depends on the area.  in some cases you just cannot have a camera, in others its all devices.
---
What a shakeup that would be. That seems difficult to stabilize in the short term. Plenty of interesting implications.
---
Rattle, marauders, maybe other faction BS could do it, or a couple t1 BS.
---
In the US, truth is a complete defense. I have no idea on Iceland.
---
Been in wormholes for like three years. Never heard of him. His campaigning obviously sucks, and he seems even less active than me.. Somehow
---
Not a chance when I haven't even heard of you. Find a cantitidate who's known and you might get somewhere. Other than exooki.
---
Well depending on how you have your dscan, you might occasionally find wrecks abandoned by ratters who got spooked or simply didn’t have the time or capability to salvage them. I’m not saying it is a frequent occurrence, but it’s not completely out of the question. 
---
I think that is your best option as a utility mod in the third high. 
---
But festival launchers are more fun.
---
Dude, you wouldn't be here if CCP hadn't kept working on this game for two decades. I remember 2000s EVE. That game was trash, and this game is still trash, but a whole lot less so.
---
I have little faith in the CSM getting the right thing done, but I have even less faith in CCP doing the right thing on their own
---
That's the kind of question you ask when you have nothing of value to add to a discussion but feel like putting someone down anyway.
---
Lol, a lobbyist with an accusation of whats basically insider trading. Id be surprised if anything negative happens lmao.
---
This sounds like a whining millennial who didn't get what they wanted and someone who obviously doesn't understand EULAs, ToS, or NDAs...
---
Your formula is great, you're one of the only EVE youtubers I actually watch.
---
Reddit loves a good mob, so naturally everyone is tripping over themselves to point and laugh. It's a sad day for everyone if Shines and Pando are really gone.
---
&gt; Problem is, it's not false information
---
That would be the real point of contention. CCP hasn't given us the details needed to be sure.  "They never mentioned his real life identity" would likely be rejected by a judge that.
---
Turns out a forum thread and appealing to a single npsi group doesn't work well as a csm campaign
---
?
---
I actually find the whole CSM thingie more credible now. He got denounced by one of them after all.
---
Or they become a pundit on a news channel.
---
I don't think CCP will risk such action unless they have proof of it. Seeing them post a news of this magnitude means they don't fear any legal action (or they are dumb as fuck, but I don't buy that).
---
Nevertheless, please remember that YOUR definition of defamation is not the one that matters. Icelandic law matter in this case (because of fucking US supreme court and EULAs). A quick glance to the Icelandic Criminal Code voids any claims there.
---
Very much so. At high end you will want to use Augmented drones with faction DDAs and be at least spec skill 4. This is for stuff such Abyssal T4 T5 and some higher end DED sites etc.
---
And how exactly do you fight allegations without going to court against a company known for simply ignoring people until they go away?
---
That sounds like you think the CSM reported Brisc to CCP for some tinfoil shit, and not because they are doing their job.
---
bing bing bing
---
PROGOD DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. 
---
Oh wait you're ProGod...
---
This is officially awkward.
---
Not really. There's even a wh discord, yet he never appeared as a cam cantitidate there.
---
Knowing your experience in defamation is very valuable.
---
Thanks for the info. Is there a big difference in profit between the different filaments?
---
"true representatives"
---
It's okay, you can say what you really mean.
---
This is just way too funny given all that’s going on in the world right now.  Love it, bravo!
---
Again, U.S laws have no bearing in this case.
---
not enough of one to actually receive any of our votes though lol
---
Steve is pretty much the definition of what a good CSM member is, he’s the model everyone else should follow when in office. He’s always super willing to chat and also his tools are nutso crazy levels of useful. This is the first year I won’t have him listed first, for obvious reasons, but he’s a definite second.
---
The suggestion is that he will eventually, later down the line. For now what we're seeing is step 1, is what I think they're saying
---
You mean those things that have no legal standing?
---
Literally no. I get it, you're in Tuskers, the old guard is your daily experience. But the EVE population has been turning through at a steady rate. 99% of the players I used to fleet up in the 2000s quit a damn long time ago. Hell, there are OG Brave guys who are "old stock" nowadays.
---
He's a Republican. 
---
They only get upset about the fact he was caught, Even then so long as he has money he'll be fine. Deny everything until there's irrefutable evidence against you that you couldn't destroy, attack the character of anyone against you, love the goal post of the conversation, misdirect to say someone else got away with something, add what aboutism to the mix, claim to be the most honest there is, blame everyone else to avoid as much responsibility as possible, repeat as much as possible. 
---
These people are always against paper trails and accountability at every opportunity.
---
Wait, I've read this SCP before
---
An NDA is an NDA, CCP keeps things under NDA because to do otherwise would directly affect his business interests. It’s super simple, if something is under NDA, do not discuss it with anyone who isn’t CCP or the current CSM. It’s not ‘ok you can tell your neighbor because they’re extra special,’ it’s an agreement to not disclose. CCP nuked Noobman for this last year, they have a clear and consistent policy on it. If you don’t want to be subject to the NDA, don’t run for CSM.
---
In many places, a contract without a break clause is not legally binding.
---
This isn’t a court of law.
---
99.999999% of cheaters dont get a dev blog written about them
---
We're all still waiting for your credentials though.
---
Let it never be said they didn't show initiative!
---
All stories posted here are works of fiction. Only a fool would take them as fact.
---
most interesting and true fact right there.
---
Concerning isk, Pando is
---
-poor af
---
-uninterested
---
-clueless

Everyone who knos him and had any isk-dealings with him can confirm. Thats why so many like him, dirty barefoot dreamer who lives solely to fc
---
It'll go back up, it always does

lmao

It's been a while since I've looked at the difference between the VNI and the Ishtar. Assuming Gallente Cruiser V and Heavy Drones, the Ishtar has 12.5 more max velocity and tracking speed. 
---
/u/PillarofPositivity is exactly right. That will translate to higher effective DPS.  
---
Here are the traits: 
---
  
---
Ishtar
---
&gt;**Gallente Cruiser bonuses (per skill level):**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;5% bonus to Sentry Drone hitpoints and damage  
---
&gt;*7.5% bonus to Heavy Drone max velocity and tracking speed*  
---
&gt;*10% bonus to Light Drone, Medium Drone, and Heavy Drone hitpoints and damage*  
---
&gt;**Heavy Assault Cruisers bonuses (per skill level):**  
---
&gt;5% bonus to Sentry Drone optimal range and tracking speed  
---
&gt;5000m bonus to Drone operation range  
---
&gt;**Role bonus:**  
---
&gt;Can fit Assault Damage Controls  
---
&gt;50% reduction in Microwarpdrive signature radius penalty
---
VNI
---
&gt;*5% bonus to Drone max velocity and tracking speed*  
---
&gt;*10% bonus to Drone hitpoints, damage and mining yield*
---
I'd like to elect Iceland as World Leader. Can we get enough city state votes to make this happen?
---
HODL!!!!
---
&gt; Is there a big difference in profit between the different filaments?
---
Yes. In general dark and fire are most profitable but also most difficult to run. Dark requires its own ships and fits and is the hardest. Fire filaments are a bit more forgiving, the ships used for them can usually also run 1-2 other filament types.
---
Gamma and Exotic will yield least income but are easiest to do and most popular ship / fit for them is a passive Gila.
---
Electrical filaments can be done in many ships and fits and are mediocre income. They can be challenging on ships which lack natural EM resistance.
---
Tasteless. I approve.
---
Fraid not.
---
Confiscated assets make sense if the breach was along the lines of "doodah that is currently worthless is getting buffed to ungodly awesomeness", so folk buy up the crap doodah at crap price points with the intention to sell them at a markup after the change is announced/implemented. Those stockpiles need removed so that when the fellas come back a year later they can't just sell them on and complete the plan.
---
He doesn’t know shit about wormholes and his only talking point when he went around to various discord servers was that he was a wormholer. He also was inactive in many of his corps and those corps (nosov, sound) were on the verge of dying during his stays so there was no experience in the meta on top of it. If he wants wormholes to vote for him maybe he should make a mark outside of NPSI.
---
If anything this should increase confidence in the CSM, considering the information was first reported by the rest of the CSM. That’s what an ethical CSM body would do, and now they’re removing the component that’s been identified as unethical.
---
When people talk about victim blaming it’s usually rape victims or the like. Not getting Fucking removed from a video game spaceships council. Get a grip.
---
Is a Jew must be bad. Is black must be a criminal. Is a Trump supporter must be a inbred racist.

Thats what sold this.

r/negativewithgold
---
&gt;All of your comments are equally funny
---
except for yours
---
Hey guys remember the last 5 times it fell and went right back up again?
---
I don't make legal claims like "if that person has made the connection between the character and himself that is beyond CCP's control an not their responsibility." precisely because I don't have credentials.
---
You do claim to know how the law works, so I wanted to know what your basis is.
---
This is all to distract us from the cyno pulse distuptor generator being released to TQ tomorrow. Can't throw shit if you don't know you're supposed to be pissed off. [insert meme]
---
Brisc's response thread uses a lot of lawyer phrases that when used together following an event like this usually add up to I'm suing the fuck out of you, so its a good bet we get to see the dirty laundry get aired during a lawsuit.
---
CCP conducts business in the US and can be sued here.
---
Brisc, 
---
The fact that you are trying to force feed us a red herring about your real life to distract us from the real issue just affirms that you probably had no business on CSM13. In the future, be more diligent in all your actions when you desire to be someone significant.
---
Festival launcher \~ or \~ if you head to drone space you'll need some damage for drones that can show up at a site.
---
Did CCP use his real name, or his real life position in their allegations? Because other than that, Brisc Rubal is a username.
---
How big of a claim could Brian have if *he* is the one who publicized his real life credentials? CCP never publicly required those credentials right? So, in a sense, Brian lowered his own expectation for privacy by revealing he is a public figure, and he set himself up for it.
---
It's also interesting that CCP is only mentioning these things in regards to in game transactions... nothing irl, are they? 
---
Last but not least, the allegations against him are in regards to in game transactions and use of internet communications. IANAL, but, doesn't that apply Federal jurisdiction due to the interstate commerce?
---
Well if you hold those opinions, good on you, bud.
---
You are not using any facts. just like talking to a liberal brain about global warming.... you dont have facts, just feelings. Read what you said... you dont use any facts and just rando guess that are 100% wrong. Idiots like you live on places like reddit where the dumber you are the more upvotes you get because most people are dumb but you think the upvotes tells you otherwise. 1mill wrong opinions dont equal 1 facts kiddo
---
People fight real hard to keep a clean image. That's why a under the table thing is under the table.
---
" ccp will never release the proof "  
---
Brisc's response to this so far used all the words that normally come before the filing of a lawsuit. So if a lawsuit does in fact get filed they are going to have to present the proof they had of why they did and said what they did and said, and at that point it  would become public record.
---
1. Request an investigation against yourself.
---
2. Provide records that are kept regarding your activity in regards.
---
3. Enact any legislation that strengthen accountably, checks and integrity.
---
4. Apologize and attempt to make up for damages with interest for mistakes and misunderstandings. 
---
Basically the opposite of what we see with a certain political party in the States.
---
Good times.
---
somebody that lives in the usa
---
well propulsion modules change the question a fair bit
---
pushing the brakes before cycling the mwd allows you to be within the warp speed bounds (0.75-1.05) by the end of the cycle- once it decycles, your vmax is updated to your regular speed and since you have accelerated to near 75% of your max speed, you enter warp immediately or within a few seconds.
---
people generally exploit this mechanic using a 500mn on capitals, it doesn't hurt acceleration and takes you to the threshold without needing to slow down beforehand. the result is the ship entering warp at the end of the cycle, allowing for sub-10 second align times on capitals. a 10000mn should also work.
---
i dont have enough smarts to consider the underlying mechanics, i can only talk about the emerging gameplay elements. it's good to know such documents exist though.
---
Need to have "Demacrats would never lie" in this string of irony dude.
---
True! Nothing I hate more than hacking a container I know has only 2 carbon in it
---
If you think about it it's actually simple.
---
They are accused of using NDA-covered informations to gain an advantage ingame.
---
Why would CCP provide the reason itself so it can be shared online (as people are banned and thus not binded by any NDA or EULA) ?
---
&gt;he bought the dip
---
dump it
---
Justice will be Brisc
---
&gt; You're just wrong on this my dude. Any time you attack someone's credibility, or state that they did "X" when "X" did not occur, you can be found to have defamed that individual.   
---
&gt; CCP Games must prove that the NDA was violated in order to level such an accusation against an individual (a finder of fact would need to verify of this, in other words, a jury or judge via bench trial), particularly given the nature and stature of this individual. They poked the wrong bear on this one I'm afraid. 
---
By that rational every lawsuit ever filed has been potentially defamatory if lost. No one is winning a defamation suit against a company for saying "we think he's violated our rules". Though if there is a test case, this might be it.
---
That's a lot of words to say I don't have any.
---
Do some basic maths before writing about something you don’t understand yet.
---
NO COLLUSION
---
VERY LEGAL VERY COOL
---
NO RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE
---
irony dude
---
About time we got the real story. Thank you Naz, from every citizen of New Eden.
---
Geography is on CCP's side. I think you would actually see it happen if they were based in somewhere like mainland Europe or the US.  But Iceland, most people would just go fuck it, too far and too expensive.  However, someone with an out of game reputation that is getting damaged may follow through with legal action.

&gt; also pretty shitty thing to do to someone for "in game" reasons
---
What, ban them from the game and remove them from the game's player representative group is a shitty thing to do for something they did 'in game.' What fucking planet are you living on?

I spawned into this thread from that other thread...I think we just warped to wormhole RE3DD1T...
---
with them it's more they tell the truth but their truth is fucking ridiculous

I'd be more than a little upset if it were my home. If you make any money building - you're doing it in someone else's structures, paying taxes to someone else's alliance, at someone else's rate. Or, more likely, you're selling your ore to buyback at rates your alliance no longer controls. At home, your indexes are dropping. [Impass](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Impass/N-CREL#adm) indexes are the lowest I've seen them in ages. Look at [6E-MOW](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/6E-MOW) ADM over the last 7 days. Dropping like a stone. I dunno about you but I'd be more than a little pissed watching my space start to become harder and harder to defend while I spend my time shoring up someone else's ADMs, filling their pockets with refine/build taxes, and staging my gear out of a red-hot war zone where the people apparently protecting me seem to be pretty incapable of actually doing so. Meanwhile, TEST has to undergo exactly zero of this hardship. They sit in esoteria, business as usual, while the C-team alliances in Legacy do the actual work of, you know, maintaining the space.
---
The fact is that if a rorq gets tackled in impass or tenerefis or feyth, TEST isn't coming in time. The locals have to save it. If a super gets tackled in those regions, it's dead. They survive by not getting caught or their own alliance rescuing them, not by getting rescued by TEST when they get caught. TEST isn't burning faxes and supers from Eso to Impass, much less Tenerefis or Feyth, in 7 minutes (less tomorrow). So this idea that they are moving to Immensea because they can be protected there is kind of laughable - and hasn't borne out as of yet.
---
Because CCP referenced only the online persona. Not the man. The man chose to link his name and background to that. CCP took the same standard action it would do against any CSM leaking. Just cause it's Brisc doesn't make it special, as much as he wants it to be.

CCP is also not entitled to our money or playership, however if they don't wish to lose that, an explanation would be welcome.

Do what? get banned from EVE? no

Im going to wait and see what CCP says he did to break his NDA and if its not indisputable, they are fucked.
---
Wow...way to Brisc yourself out of the game man.
---
why don't we have a word for "Speaking about a topic without having substance"
---
To this day I can't end you should all thank your lucky stars that even a meme Wormhole Corporation got its candidate on the CSM the year it did. I don't think you could fathom how low on the totem pole Wormhole space was when it came to Citadel design.
---
Thanks! Appreciate your simple explanation :)
---
There's a not-non-existing chance that he didn't do it.
---
In which case either CCP wanted to torpedo CSM or the CSM wanted to torpedo something.
---
Not hard to see which one is the most plausible explanation.
---
tl;dr “goons bad. CCP bad. Brisc innocent.” - guy who apparently got banned for spouting racial slurs in local

I like you

I hibernate in the winter is all. Coming back soon.

CCP can release whatever they want, the NDA only applies to CSM members, not CCP itself.

Brisc's first name is not Brisc...it's Brian.

So, he's either lying or he's incompetent, and both of those are bad
---
Do you like to chew tinfoil?
---
I was always of the understanding that you can con, deceive and lie to the players in that game and the GMs won't do anything. Heck, my character made millions once by stealing all of the corporations items and selling them on the market. 
---
Is this no longer the case with the game?
---
&gt;You're just wrong on this my dude.
---
&gt;They poked the wrong bear on this one I'm afraid.

We'll see. But I'm pretty sure we both know how this will end up. :)

---
In a case like this, yes, I'd expect them to lift the NDA and announce whatever it was to the public together with the evidence. This is in my opinion the best option for ccp. Whatever it is, it would've propably been announced sooner or later anyways and it can't be as bad as loosing the trust of an alliance like init.
---
You mean those things the us court system has rules in favor for multiple times in the past?
---
Anyone have any potential ideas what information CSM has the general player base doesn't that could be used to make ISK?
---
Depends on what flavor
---
Those of you pointing out brisc as a lobbyist/politician all sorts of crap, and that it would not be wise to trust him, remember that it's super easy for CCP to scapegoat brisc for this exact reason, that he is vulnerable to criticism more than others and you guys are all predictable as fuck.
---
The tinfoil and fox news
---
Unfortunately, U.S. Politics effects everyone, and everyone has an effect on U.S. politics. When it's bad, everyone talks about it in hopes it changes because it's all about reputation and money. If global business literally held American politics accountable, like say the businesses stance on the war in Iraq, Syria etc, American politics would change almost overnight. 
---
On that note, I'm sorry.
---
Just moved out to null and did my first full day of ratting. I'm sure it will get old quick, but today kept me entertained and excited. Got burnt out running level 4 security missions. Question, do you guys bother to MTU? If so what's your strat on using the MTU? Having to save loc and come back to it when your cargo hold is full is annoying.
---
&gt;In the United States a private business cannot slander or defame a public figure
---
CCP is not in the United States. Not sure if they even have an office here anymore. And they did not slander him in any way shape or form, simply stated his character, in the game has been banned on grounds of an NDA violation.
---
Brisc in turn however can file a lawsuit if he feels he has the right to and if he feels he has reasonable chances of winning. But the deck is kinda stacked against him as follows:
---
1. Since Brisc is an admitted public figure, if he chooses to file this suit in US under US laws, then he has to prove malice on CCPs part.
---
2. CCP has a history and goes far and above due diligence in protecting its players RL identities. Even very recently, if those players request it. Brisc failed to make any such requests in a game / hobby / environment with history of numerous incidents which affect people very negatively IRL. His full public identity disclosure is 100% result of his own negligence in this area. Had he not been negligent to a great extent, any and all damage done would have been confined entirely to the game, his game characters, accounts, etc. No RL consequences whatsoever would have come into play. Again, this is 100% due to his own negligence.
---
3. CCP would not take a very high profile action such as this unless they had some evidence that will justify these actions for 100%.
---
4. Even if it gets to court and in front of a judge, and that court / judge find CCPs evidence to be solid and it becomes public at that time, Brisc will be in a much more public and magnitudes bigger shitpile then he already found himself in.
---
The best solution for him would be to just get the NDA accusation dropped via direct contact with CCP and downgraded it to a TOS / EULA violation somehow. This would not affect him IRL and CCP would still keep tehir ban. If it fails, file a suit with intent of doing same as an out of court settlement. But then he starts to run a risk, what if CCP decides to take it to court then counter sues for legal costs and in the process he gets even more screwed ?
---
kinda hard not to when the guy we're talking about is literally involved in US politics
---
&gt; Reddit is a shit hole turning on a guy with ZERO evidence....
---
While the people on this sub don't have the evidence, I'm pretty sure we can all say that CCP's word on the matter is credible. At least for now, just think of the consequences for the company if they don't sit with enough proof. They wouldn't do this without it.
---
&gt;  why is CCP not emailing people when and why they are being banned?
---
As far as I am aware they don't have to tell you why you were banned. While there are some that do, there's many that does not tell you. Unless it's som truly garbage developer they won't ban you without a reason, either.
---
&gt; you all should be ashamed. This is a persons life
---
Many have stated that Brian has involved EVE and his career a whole lot, which is pretty clear imo. Why mix the two, and why break a NDA when you know for sure that players will be notified if you're caught + it can have a huge impact on your professional career?
---
Also grow some thick skin please, this is like one of the last places people still make fun of everyone else, like it was before. In 2019 everyone wants to sue you if you look at the the wrong way VoV
---
We'll see if CCP releases more proof, either to the public or to the involved, then it will be taken from there.
---
Lobbyists are to politicians as lampreys are to fish
---
Thing is, this is not "in a virtual world".
---
CSM matter may be linked to EvE, it's still insider information that, for example, could affect the game's economy and cost money to CCP in the long run.
---
The reason CCP NDA shit is not to prevent insider trading per se, but to prevent impact on their monetary gains through the game.  
---
And don't misunderstand me, I actually like what INIT it doing when i'm not blowing them up in space.
---
the last time they banned a csm (noobman) they had evidence/did an investigation before banning, i doubt they'd handle it differently this time
---

tl;dr
---
how are they fucked lmao, what's brisc gonna do, sue them for everything they have?
---
CCP Says the CSM members bring it to CCPs attention. CSM members are all "high rank" CFC members. Why would goons want to take out Brisc?
---
Well its simpler for CCP to show their hand rather than draw things out in potential legal proceedings.  If Brisc is merely sabre rattling and ultimately does nothing in the face of CCPs stonewalling then yeah that would be telling.  All that is left is to see how it plays out.
---
Lol. Republican's certainly have a good rapeutation to worry about, don't they?
---
Oh i do have enough trust in CCP to believe they did a good investigation into it. And CSM being named as the source makes it pretty hard to try and argue against.
---
They have made some pretty bad ban calls in the past. They are not exactly perfect.
---
/r/The_Brisc done
---
because they actually like the game and don't like cheating scumbags?
---
or are you a party over country person?
---
(don't answer that, your profile speaks for itself)
---
tfw you're this thinskinned over a legitimate retard who linked (with no encouragement to do so from ccp) his rl to his eve getting banned for breaking eula and not getting special treatment
---
cry more
---
Superb.
---
Probably because it's not that.  
---
Announcement made are no longer covered by NDA (unless specifics), they could then talk about it.
---
It's probably something they didn't announce yet.

Lots of things affect everyone, lots of things are out of everyone's direct control. Reddit is obsessed with politics, as if their own lives are dependent upon such things. I guess that is what happens when our lives are so complex and so easy that we can externalize what few problems we actually have.

REAL NAZ AL-GHUL. POGCHAMP

Unless sealed. Which could happen with NDA shit.

Also good luck filling a lawsuit in Iceland.
---
I know absolutely nothing about this ongoing situation. But in the past I met two guys I never liked much and couldn't figure out why. One of them disbanded BoB. The other started the casino war....so yeah. Interesting when vibes or experiences  get validated.
---
That's why Brisc being guilty is by far the most plausible explanation. Not many reasons to frame someone like this.
---
yeah.. that is US politics! Trump and Brisc!
---
The people that say this don't have a clue.
---
Eve has too many 'magical' systems in place that cause unreal economic effects to be contrasted to reality.
---
Definitely simpler, and as a nosey person unaffiliated with anyone involved, I wanna know! But I don't see it happening, or at least not for quite a while with heavy redacting, purely because it's going to be hard to show proof without revealing the information that wasn't supposed to be out there (undermining the argument that it matters that it's secret) and/or revealing their means of checking up on such claims (making it easier for others to avoid those detection systems), and/or revealing who tattled (making them a possible target). 
---
Shall either be very interesting, or fade out of public view when the next big thing hits.
---
Yeah you definitely won't just pop them and stop whining.
---
Goons, not CCP. CCP is stupid and banned someone based of what a Goon said. Not the first time and sense the first time worked so well... maybe baiting CCP into a lawsuit sounds fun to a Goon who has everything in game and very little out of game.... ALL CCP has to do is have real evidence.
---
3 dreads 1 hole.
---
Imo, using an MTU is a waste of time, for the reasons you describe.
---
an attorney how represents himself has a fool for a client.
---
There are things that even CCP won't tolerate within the game.
---
In this case, a (ex) CSM member violated a REAL LIFE non-disclosure agreement that all CSM sign and used confidential information to commit insider trading.
---
i need evidence that you have more than 3 braincells
---
If they didn’t do anything at all. Stop pulling this out of context
---
I'm here and running an alliance and a corporation because I'm having a pretty good time in the game, glaring issues aside.

I'm pretty damn sure word of a few guys alone isn't enough to call for an NDA breach.

Lets say I make a Contract with you that says "you will deliver 5 tons of dirt to my land".  On the way you realize there is a toll on the road, and I own that toll.  This is your fault, not mine.  There are no legal repercussions for this.

---
Politics is the discussion of our governance and am attempt to keep public servants in check, and remind them that they serve the public.   
---
As an example, less education funding means people are less qualified for their jobs later, lowering the quality of life of everyone. That means higher mistakes, higher cost due to accidents, lower comprehension and understanding. 
---
Politics puts people in power to determine what kind of car we can have, whether or not porn or alcohol is legal, if it's okay they a business sells you beef when it's not beef, whether or not you should have a certain pay for work or even days off. It even effects if your browser history spills be made public. 
---
Politics is far more serious than I thought growing up.
---
If the dude is doing so "unironically", does that mean there is a way to ironically breath goon penis? I'm more intrigued by how that works tbh.
---
Exactly, we hope so right. But so far... nope, just a guys life being ruined and another alliance wiedotting into goons.
---
Basically everyone who claims they didn't do anything to get banned I do still suspect a bit.
---
I work in customer service for custom measured blinds/shades.
---
The amount of people who swear up and down they didn't measure incorrectly and we messed up and post reviews claiming such things makes me view complaints like this with a grain of salt.

---
Holy fuck. 10/10. Did not expect that ending. This is masterful.

&gt; If CCP does not bring irrefutable evidence then they are screwed and Brisc will be a rich man 
---
Lol

No collusion, total vindication!

Yeah, because you *have* to suffer from rape in order to be a victim. That word simply *cannot* be used in any other circumstance, right?

---
...
---
No nope nup negative none nyet nein
---
You can always haul crap. This is boring and sucks ass. You could bait with it, which is fun and doesn’t suck ass, but does make your wallet sad. You could also also probably do some wormhole shenanigans with it, like maybe get a freighter safelogged with some ships and wait till you have a chance to fly shuttles in, then surprise them with a bunch of ravens or something(iirc this is how goons evicted hard knocks)
---
Thank you good sir. I hope you found the story enjoyable.
---
Eve is honestly one of the most complex self contained ecosystems and it's fascinating to watch the developments

You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
---
may be he is a very  nice guy .. usually other goon CSm member doesnt knw much about game mechanics , they are in csm to flip other alleince leaders and director . or make deal with darkness in csm meetings .. :)
---
Pretty! Good work.
---
I'd love it if they added a variant of Large Collidables so you can tell which ones can be shot up and which ones are indestructible, but within current limitations this is still a decent reference.
---
This is a shit post right guis? Have we been baited or is the OP just another internet snowflake?
---
I think we should know and I think the days of behind closed door actions for CCP should be over.  After all their prior business practices led them into the jaws of Pearl Abyss so perhaps its time for changes.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
*Brisc Rubal would like to know your location*
---
I used to be a CSM member till I took a CCP to the knee.
---
Who’s the .75?
---
It doesn't matter. An action has a reaction of hurting his reputation. Whether this happened because he linked his persona with his account is irrelevant as long as that action hurt his reputation was is untrue.
---
Bravo. Well said.
---
It's an interesting matter, because Brisc could sue CCP because they announced that he broke an NDA, but at the same time, CCP could likely sue Brisc because he broke the NDA he signed.
---
Even if innocent, Brisc will probably be perma-banned and never allowed back onto the CSM. CCP are very bad about backpedaling when things go wrong, the only time I can think of in recent memory was "Greed is Good", which isn't all that recent, but he could get the other two initiative members unbanned and, more importantly, get CCP to clear his name.
---
I have not verified but I have heard discussion that the market for faction weapons saw manipulation prior to the announcement that they can use t2 ammo in the future.
---
He linked his name when he signed the NDA - ccp has accused him off a serious breach of ethics which will require reporting to his State's bar. 
---
Ccp has accused the person IRL of breaking his word about not disclosing secrets. This is literally the heart and soul of how the legal system works and thus is a major attack on someone in the legal world.
---
Either the allegations are true, and brisc is screwed or they are based on ccp's personal standards of whatever they think constitutes sufficient proof for kicking and banning someone.
---
That standard may not actually be enough to hold up in court though, against a libel suit.
---
That is, ccp is used to kicking and banning people without having to consult their legal department so they may have done so in this case as well.
---
As a result they may not have considered that posting this accusation on their blog could constitute libel with great damage to his real career. And if they truly don't have a legally sufficient evidence of breach of their NDA then they are in trouble should brisc bring a libel suit.
---
Already brisc's warning should have triggered their legal department to ensure that no evidence is inadvertently destroyed or go "missing". 
---
This is serious stuff man. This didn't happen in the game. It happened IRL.

---
Pretty good deal.
---
I don’t have issue with ccp banning the guilty , what I don’t like is them not showing evidence. If legit seen people be accused by ccp of rmt who were innocent and successfully proved it, because they were lucky enough to have that chance. (Were talking trilllionaire level players here). Their secrecy around bans is frustrating because they have banned all sorts of folks with no obvious reason why.
---
Also Texas lawyer here; can confirm the above. My colleague knows his stuff!
---
*OwO, what's this? * It's your **1st Cakeday** AlexanderTalar! ^(hug)
---
Ummm yeh actually they should, much of ccp are players themselves, imagine if you got banned because you ganked and ownzoned a ccp staff member on their game account? (This is suspect as half of damn code. Have been banned despite no obvious reason as to why)
---
+1
---
&gt; The email provided no information regarding the allegations, charges or evidence supporting such a ban.
---
Okay sure, but what do YOU think it's about?  Or do you have no idea at this point what the details are behind the alleged breach?
---
While I don't really give a flying fuck about OP or his ban, I do however find it strange that everybody is taking CCP at face value on this without the tiniest bit of supporting evidence.
---
Dam I need in english to read this....TLTR?
---
A part of Briscs CSM election campaign was to make use of his real life experience as a politician. He readily named himself and uses with official IRL Twitter to talk EVE on occasions.
---
It should be noted that doxxing isn't voluntarily tying yourself to your real identity on a platform of your choosing. 
---
It is the release of real life information of a person beyond what they have chosen to give out on a platform.
---
What would he possibly sue for?  He can't claim defamation as CCP only name his in game character.  It was his own decision to link himself with his in game character which was something that CCP had no control over.  What grounds would he have especially considering per the EULA we all signed he'd have to sue in Iceland.
---
/u/deltaxi65 what are your thoughts on Eve's player base unionizing to prevent further abuses like this?

Went afk as far as I can tell. I took a solid 1.5 yr break several months after wwb so I think I missed his departure.

begrudgingly upvoted...
---
This was pretty good.
---
It'll never get that far.  CCP never defamed the man himself they only released a statement on his character.  It was his own decision to link his real life identity to his EVE character and he also used that to springboard his own career.  Funnily enough if he did sue them I could see CCP launching a counter-suit against him for using their IP in business relations since he directly referenced his role in their game as a means to better his career.  Either way this is going to be a fun few weeks.

---
That ending really made the whole read worth it
---
At the end of the day this is about a volunteer position for a videogame, and a privilege that was granted to him. He didn't have to associate any of this with his job, but he did. That's his issue.  
---
CCP's rules are CCP's, no one elses. They can take away his position at any time, and his account, as per the EULA. He signed a contract, and that's that. CCP never accused him of violating any rule outside of their own and haven't even told anyone other than him what he did, so why would this ever hold up in court as libel? That's a real stretch. You need to remember this wasn't a job, or a real government position, or even anything remotely close.

OP is MAGAcel and i'm fairly sure was also booted off the list of csm candidates because he just couldn't hold in his unironic naziposting, OP is snowflake
---
He really doesn't though when did CCP reference the man, never.  They only referenced the in game character and they had no control over him linking that character to his real life identity.  There is no possible defamation suit here.
---
Ahhhh. I see.
---
Well. That’s a lot of yikes.
---
He's a lawyer by trade and his initial reply looks suspiciously close to the start of a slander (libel?) lawsuit. I'd be very suprised if CCP made a statement.
---
Did kind of like that to some WH Czechs once!

Sat in there cloaked for a while. Once we figured out the activity and population times two bros went in miner boats "to steal some gas."

Then jumped on the wh defense team. Looked like a turkey shoot to them, so every one who was logged in was sitting there hammering on the barges.

Then it got really fun when we figured out they had not much combat power left to draw from. Popped and looted almost everything. Left when a few too many Proteus showed up.

Doing some shenanigans with an Obelisk already paid for seems good. Thx! o7

You have to be an actual victim of something, not just a guy that broke an NDA and got banned for it.

Yeah, I used to think that, now I don't.

Politics is as serious as any other natural phenomena. Unless you believe that people are supernatural, apart from the universe and able to control it, then the movement of society follows the same set of rules with the same amount of agency as everything else in the universe. The patterns are far more complex, but the rules are still the same. 
---
 
---
People who place the meaning and value of their lives into ideas like politics are welcome to do so, but I am highly skeptical of the efficacy of such a delusion.

 whats that a lobbyist was found to be corrupt in the one place he couldnt be(CSM) in Eve Online
---
They never accused the person they accused the in game character.  Had he not linked himself to his identity outside of the game no one would have known who this guy was.  That is not on CCP that is on Brisc himself and they can't be sued for libel against a fictional character.
---
&gt;campaign video where he shows himself, talks about his RL
---
&gt;RL twitter for his eve shit
---
&gt;even before CSM told corpmates he was a politician
---
he's not incredibly bright you know
---
Well, first of all, your country (if it is America) has done more to improve the material lives of people on the planet than any other society in history, so don't be so hard on it. Forgetting the blessings and pointing out the curses is the default mode of consciousness. 
---
Second, lives are made and ruined by the individuals who live them, not the material wealth they control. Otherwise all lives prior to the ones living right now would be "ruined", and the lives of all humans who lived over a century ago would be worthless.
---
Lmfao. Some internet nerd brags that he's a lobbyist and then SURPRISE DID A CORRUPT and suddenly everyone is a reddit lawyer that knows how a international libel case is going to go down. Please keep going I just invested in a popcorn machine.
---
But add more legalese you used too many layperson words.
---
Buddy, go tell some lobbyists that another lobbyist did some insider trading in an MMO and watch how quickly they laugh you out of the room. It matters to the extent he will be ragged about it at the bar, and that's that.
---
I'm not justifying his wrongdoing, just saying that as far as it affecting him professionally, that's incredibly unlikely and reveals the wishful thinking on the part of INIT's detractors. Lots of weird astroturfing going on right now.
---
Not defamation if it's true. Please don't try to Texas Law.

Don't get me wrong - I'm thrilled that Legacy has decided to increase the concentration of targets near me. I'm not saying this because I'm altruistic - I'm saying it because it reflects poorly on TEST, and that makes me happy.

---
When exactly was it he got banned the second time? I seem to remember co2 peaking on their pure blind iteration with him at the head, and then the Imperium stomping that into dust, and him not getting banned until after they had turned tail off to horde's couch or whatever.
---
Regardless, what you make it sound like is bans aren't to punish all people, only those who matter, which I generally find the opposite to be true, with them bending rules a little to allow content creators to stick around, as it's good for the game.
---
This belongs on r/iamverysmart lmfao

I think that would be the point of the suit- If it WERE true, CCP would win because they wouldn't be defaming him, they were telling the truth. If it's NOT true, then his character was smeared and it was indicated that he violated an NDA when he did not, and CCP would lose. 
---
Either way, people would see what the truth was. 
---
I am not a lawyer Bee tee dubs, that's just the impression I get from some of these replies. In my own field, we have a saying: The data will tell. Kinda the same thing I guess, in a roundabout way.

Pretty much anything.  When I was there for the AT I was shown spreadsheets with upcoming stat changes to every ship of a certain class and engaged in discussion of what I thought of the changes and if I had any opinions on them.  With that alone I could have made trillions knowing those ships were due for a change and which ones would come out ahead of those changes.  But I also know better than to break an NDA, and CCP's is no joke.
---
You're a fucking idiot
---
Thats correct.....
---
It doesn't matter if they used a pseudonym- he only needs to prove that his reputation was hurt in real life because his colleagues know that's him they are talking about on pcgamer.com.
---
Another lawyer below explains this in greater detail. Scroll down and take a look why arranging a pseudonym doesn't give you a valid defense against libel.
---
Since CCP isn't a news organization it wouldn't matter in the US either.  The only time corporations are insulated from defamation claims against public figures is if they are news organizations.

So brisc has to report that himself? And it's a law?

**Paid for by washington.org**
---
Why does anyone do the shit they do? What a stupid line of reasoning... what kind of defense is that?
---
CCP is accusing him of breaking a legal agreement.  This is already past in game stuff so CCP can't hide behind their standard obfuscation.  If Brian wants to challenge this then CCP will have to either drop their complain or open themselves up to the discovery process.
---
&gt; I find it rather hard to believe CCP would indiscriminately ban the three of you with no evidence.
---
Why not.  CCP's done it before.
---
By this logic he would have been silently banned, no Devblog post about it.
---
Brisc gets banned and all assets siezed.
---

---
You guys have no sense of history. Chance, you are not even in the bottom 10
---
You don't tell cheats how you caught them.
---
&gt;CCP's rules are CCP's, no one elses. They can take away his position at any time, and his account, as per the EULA.
---
So far so good, but their Eula doesn't protect them if they libel someone in real life.
---
&gt;CCP never accused him of violating any rule outside of their own and haven't even told anyone other than him what he did, so why would this ever hold up in court as libel?
---
Ccp has accused him off violating their NDA. This is particularly egregious to a lawyer because it will trigger reporting requirements to the State bar, which could result in disciplinary action.
---
Besides that, pcgamer just reported on a real life lobbyist being accused by a corporation of violating an NDA. That is a serious accusation against anyone, let alone a lawyer because it sullies their reputation. It becomes a material issue when dealing with clients when they ask whether he has ever been accused of breaking an NDA. 
---
Client confidentially is at the heart of how the legal system works. If you cannot be trusted to keep to your NDA then you can't be trusted to keep your clients' secrets.
---
Stuff like this gets lawyers disbarred.
---
So, yes, ccp has a right to ban him for life from the game and he likely won't have any recourse. But ccp has no right to libel anyone in real life, which if the accusations turn out to be false, will get them on real trouble.
---
CCP's legal team has historically been pretty shitty.  Remember their whole "we own your IP because you put it into the game" thing?
---
Don't.  It is a hilarious loss mail in waiting for less than 50% more isk/h.
---
Yep. I believe all state bars have a reporting requirement; some require it only when you're accused, some when a court decided that the accusations were true, etc.
---
Hmm I wonder if someone is this is a forced dip by someone trying to artificially manipulate the price down

NDA's are part of the eve universe.  They are accusing him of real world things so they get to operate by real world rules.
---
Oh wow, so there is actually a fair bit to potentially be made if you have dodgy intentions.
---
Yes.
---
Ha ha, I think that part of his speech triggered Clinton flashbacks for a lot of people, 3 of us made the joke in twitch chat within about a second of him finishing the sentence.
---
Nah, in those cases, they just file.

The more public statements made, and the more those statements protest innocence, the less likely there will be a successful lawsuit.
---
I answer as habitual of character bazaar.
---
**The best tip is.. until 5m the price is 3.5-4b**
---
**Then the price is aprox 800m per 1 million skill points.**
---
 Example :
---
Pilot of 10m skill points
---
1 ) Good pilot aspected without waste, can be 10-12b if focused
---
2 ) Not focused : 8m - 10m
---
Rarely the price is better than that. Characters with direct income as carrier ratters, traders with reputation, etc, can have a surplus of 2-3b 
---
Example : I put to sell recently a porpoise orca miner of 6.5m with 800k points without use. I was waiting for 5- 5.5 but someone payme the 6.5m of the value.
---
Disclaimer: Slaves, totan boosk, good reputations or other small things can be a surplus in the price.
---
No.
---
Ok - you are the fourth worst CSM ever.
---
Yikes this thread. 
---
Panfam and wh guys seem so confident of his  guilt.
---
Good thing CCP had a perfect record of getting proof before the banhammer or I might think these guys had an agenda or maybe even an ax to grind.
---
I was a super tester for a game back in 2015. Part of the agreement between them and I for joining the team - as I had recently announced I was quitting and was somewhat of a public figure in the community - was that I would not pull my punches on any criticism, part of which was why they came to me in the first place.
---
After I criticized a major upcoming update (which turned out to be the first in a long line of Jesus Features that ran the game into the ground) I was accused of breaching NDA (which was false, I'd only commented on information they had disclosed in the devblog) and removed from the team. I was not banned from the game as I believe the studio realized the removal was by one vindictive dev rather than the studio proper - but I had to watch it spiral, which in some ways felt worse.

---
The problem with showing evidence is it reveals exactly what CCP was looking for.  So the next round of RMT/whatever they don't do that.  You also end up with edge cases where two people do something pretty similar, and one gets a ban and one doesn't because of very small variations....or the GM was angry that day.
---
Also, private company, EULA says they can ban you for nothing, yadda yadda yadda.
---
You fucking mongs are too funny with this "sue for defamation" shit. It's a fucking bluff and he thinks he's going to make them blink with these bullshit "legal" threats.  I guarantee they have evidence, but they aren't going to show a cheat how they caught them. It's Iceland bitches and they don't have to prove shit to some sleazeball US attorney. 
---
You fucking retards could try to look a little less stupid by trying to insist he has any sort of leg to stand on. He's fucking done. Time to move on. Show's over folks
---
Might get a raise, really.
---
It was GigX, typing with a pair of hands he "found".
---
That's the best Rorikroll I've seen to date. Bravo.
---
I suspect CCP hired a lawyer to write the contract or at very least look over it. I'm pretty sure they didn't just write a couple words on a cocktail napkin and sign it.
---
Brisc (can I call you Brisc? I feel that we know you much better now you've poured out your heart), Brisc thank you for your protestations  of bewildered innocence.
---
One problem: we really don't believe it. Not any of it.
---
Sorry.
---
As I understand defamation, Brisc Rubal will have to prove malice, not just with negligence, as he is a public figure, as he even describes himself. Defamation only applies to negligence for private figures.  
---
He will need to show that CCP was not just trying to do their jobs, but were actively trying to harm his reputation as an attorney and a public figure.  
---
Even being a member of the CSM could constitute being a public figure, let alone his job.
---
Please don't.
---
Daddy pls
---
Which is why he should have kept his RL career out of the game
---
He signed an NDA in real life, not in the game. 
---
I'll take your word for it that lobbyists wouldn't care about that, though. From the admittedly very small number of lobbyists I've met (a whopping 2), they seemed like a..... Ethically flexible type.
---
So you were winning for two years and decided to stop?
---
Wondering here too...
---
I DIDNT DO IT
---
  IF I DID, ITS BOY THAT BAD
---
  OTHER PEOPLE DID IT BEFORE SO ITS OK
---
  NO COLLUSION. BELIEVE ME
---
I seriously find it hard to believe that someone in his position of importance within a government lobbying position of the US would risk his creditability on fake money and fake importance, to gain an advantage that doesn't matter.
---
Let's be real. EvE at the end of the day is a game. Being an attorney is real life.
---
Was linking the two smart? No. But he did so anyways, knowing the repercussions that could happen. Let there be proof of the accusations from CCP and the CSM before we send someone's real life towards a bitter end over fake power and fake money.
---
Extremly acurrate vid... \^\^
---
&gt;When you type in his irl name into Google, this is the first thing that comes up and its irrelevant who linked his IRL name to his ingame alias.  
---
Which is his doing, not CCP's.  CCP never revealed his name, nor confirmed that Brisc is actually that guy.
---
That's an important distinction.  Otherwise you could announce your RL name and then do all sorts of shit looking for a ban to sue over.
---
Lobbyist
---
I approve of CCP acting quickly if this is true, but this repeated theme of them banning people with no contact, explanation, evidence, anything is very concerning.
---
 Scum
---
Also, EULA (and probably the NDA itself) requires the lawsuit take place in Iceland, and that would *probably* be binding in a US court.
---
Not in Iceland.
---
So there is a very drastic drop in value if a char is not focused. Did you sell the 7.3M SP Orca miner for 6.5B not 6.5M ISK?
---
I think the defense was more along the lines of. They have shown no proof and not even stated exactly what I was supposed to have done.  
---
Now, if you want to uphold CCPs right to ban players without showing proof of why, that is fine, it is a game. Deciding he is actually guilty and smearing his name in real life without showing proof might cause issues for them though.
---
Insider trading out of game or in game?
---
&gt; In this case, a (ex) CSM member **is accused of violating** ~~violated~~ a REAL LIFE non-disclosure agreement that all CSM sign and used confidential information to **alegedly** commit insider trading.   
---
FTFY
---
The only thing that ties CCP's actions to his identity is his own statements.  Thus the harm to his identity is his own statements which CCP did not solicit nor require him to make.
---
Also, the EULA says he'd have to sue in Iceland, and presumably the NDA itself is going to say the same.  So, not very easy for him to sue.
---
Also, it's Iceland and nothing is legally proven at this point.  He'd be able to deflect with "those vikings are crazy".  He takes it to court and CCP does have proof, and thus he loses, it's suddenly much, much worse for him.
---
A spare capsule. 
---
It just appeared my my corp impound one day.
---
If only there was some catchy name which we could use to describe Brisc's exit from the CSM.
---
No. There is zero evidence on who did it.
---
What I love here, is the reversal of attitudes on fleet doctrine when a guy is getting ratfucked IRL for EVEN POSSIBLY violating an international, provisional, and unenforceable NDA.

It would be extremely strange for no politics to be involved with something like this in the OP. I have no idea why you're surprised that politics would follow someone who is involved in lobbying policies.
---
Spoken like a true lobbyist.
---
To be honest, I only voted for you in CSM just in the slightest of hopes that it would have you step back from your political career. Turns out you're into ruining this game just as much as real life.
---
Also, how the fuck does a lawyer even remotely get into the danger zone of breaking an NDA without intentionally doing so?
---
Are you about to file a defamation lawsuit like everyone else in the GOP? Too bad, you signed an NDA.

---
&gt; what I don’t like is them not showing evidence.
---
That's not how this works. This isn't a democracy and no one has any right to see evidence, not even Brisc. 
---
I do however trust that CCP has enough evidence based around this situation. Why? Because they wouldn't inherently hurt their what makes them money.
---
I think you're forgetting that when Mittani was on the CSM, CCP published the real names of CSM members.
---
BUT HER EMAILS
---
Brisc...I hope one day you can laugh at this propaganda. I have sympathy for your situation because we are in the dark about what happened. Doesn’t feel right since you were elected. Anyway...I hope this tickles you one day. All this is the internet’s weird way of complimenting you.
---
Yeah but remember that time Chance was concerned about Citadels creating an invincible cyno superhighway? What an idiot
---
Uaxdeath was bad but ironically not even close to the worse part about being on CSM X
---
IANAL ... but in light of the almighty shitstorm that could *potentially* head CCPs way from openly accusing someone who they are fully aware relies on professional standards, of breaking a legal contract for personal gain... It's not unreasonable to assume that whatever evidence they did have has already been put under a do-not-discuss and sent to outside counsel.
---
I doubt we'll ever see the evidence. I doubt anyone accused will either unless it's eventually brought up in a defamation court case... which isn't exactly out of the question, considering CCP had full knowledge of the unambiguous public link between the character and the person behind it / their profession.
---
https://injury.findlaw.com/torts-and-personal-injuries/what-is-defamation-per-se-.html
---
Brisk is either guilty, at which point he deserves to be banned for all eternity and given no quarter by his alliance... or he's not guilty, and CCP better hope they have some cash spare.
---
unless of course he actually wins in which case releasing the details would be part of the settlement
---
Magic 8 ball says, not likely.
---
Is there actually any law or oath that prevents politicians from lying or doing whatever outside of office? This is the first time I've heard of something like that and I haven't the faintest clue what it could be referring to.

Not sticking up for him, but it is definitely not beyond the pale that other members of the CSM conspired against him.   The CSM is anything but a bunch of angels.
---
What kind of lawyer/lobbyist unintentionally puts themselves in a position where a company can even be remotely suspect of them breaching a contract?
---
Spoilers: None.
---
You actually think this has something to do with Republicans?
---
I approve of this message
---
He was just trying to make some brisk rubles....  
---
... I'll see myself out.
---
That's a fairly good point, so there'd be some room for a suit making CCP having to prove breach of contract.
---
Well, basically I would say it was simple, it has to be insanely hard to keep that stuff a secret, and he likely told a couple people he thought he could trust and 1 or 2 of them tried to take advantage of the info.  I mean honestly I would also have a hard time not telling someone I thought I could trust.
---
Yes, if not focused can be bad price. Try to have cybernetic V at least.

No, the character was 6.5 inclding 800m unallocated. The 6.5m was fair.

The case of course has different facts and countries, but a precedent has been set. Someone slander an online persona and because he had made it known who the IRL person was behind it he sued and won.  So by saying they never mentioned who the IRL person doesn't mean they didn't slander him.

lol. Jus satin, all the "He must be punished for his proven betrayal to the community!" comments seem to have some flair in common.
---
Due process?  It's an NDA violation but also we are subject to the EULA.  There's no remediation for banning, in a legal sense.  They can just ban you.
---
And yet CCP has unbanned when their nose was rubbed in the proof.   Hard to line up the facts though when you don't know the charge.
---
It's really fucking with me that CCP won't put out an actual response to this. I don't think they thought of the implications of slandering someone with a BAR Certification, or had any intention of actually seeing this through. If they have even a shred of evidence, Brisc wouldnt put his IRL carrer on the line to speak out against them. I Hate to be that guy, but this smells like foul play from the side that has 90% of the past CSM NDA violations and constantly bitches about Imperium's control of the CSM.

If you work in modern US politics as a lobbyist you are a parasite though and though. What reputation is there to tarnish ?

sorry, but it's delve that is cursed

He broke a legally binding contract,which shows he can't be trusted with information and thus will bring up questions like ''has he done this before'' ''can we trust a person like this''.. He has effectively ruined his reputation not just virtually but professionally and all this added media coverage is just adding fuel to the fire that is his career

I played SWG with Brisc for over 7yrs, almost 10?...

I unfortunately had to deal with Brisc quite a bit, his guild lived in our guilds city.

He will go to any extreme for a perceived 'win'.
---
Hacking, lieing, cheating, misogyny, 'casual' racism, all par for the course with Brisc.
---
His common retort to me over in-game issues: "It's just a game, why do you care so much to be a White Knight?" .

My typical response: "Exactly! it IS just a game, how low low are you willing to go to 'win'?"  (There were zero 'win conditions' in SWG.)

No matter what he is, he is criminal scum
---
He’s still around, doesn’t play eve though.  Used to play siege with him
---
Just realized the heaping mounds that discovery would roll out of CCP.  God, I hope he sues.
---
He’s tried running for office before.
---
&gt; SO FUCKING STUPID in so many ways makes me wonder if this actually is a mistake...

**Hanlon's razor** is an [aphorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism) expressed in various ways, including:

"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor#cite_note-jargon-1)

Farjek, you need more [bloooob](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76109888/)

Sounds just like the old we found a manny titan alt

&gt;than governments do
---
Then America does, don't include the world in your folly USA.
---
All I'm saying is they better have their ducks in a row on this one
---
It's all about the Texas law
---
Would not have enough cowards to run the party as is intended.
---
&gt;Usually being accused of corruption is a pretty bad thing to have happen.
---
In America its considered a soft skill, in the government it's mandatory.

EVE simulates things in one-second intervals, or ticks.
---
The point of instalocking tackle is to lock you up in one game tick and tackle you the next, which is theoretically as fast as it can be done.
---
With a covops cloak, you spend one tick aligning to drop gate cloak and activating your own cloak at the same time so you're gone by the time the second tick rolls around.
---
The same logic applies to travel interceptors, which try their best to warp within 2 seconds so that there's never a chance to catch them unless latency breaks something.
---
Can't be a worse read than The Fountain War
---
The EULA doesn't matter. The CSM signs an actual contract. If they have proof that he broke the terms of the NDA, then it isn't slander or defamation. There is probably language in the NDA for what happens if it's violated. Knowing he's a public figure, he probably shoudn't have signed it or broken the NDA (assuming he did break it.)
---
They will mate, they will.
---
Lol. Only here so I can say "I was there when brisc was banned 2019". This thread is great.
---
A mistaken ban isn't malice. It is, however, lesser stupidity than fucking your own RL career for Eve, so I'm inclined to think that maybe we don't know the story here.
---
Wonder if this is next level meta gaming.
---
That's a very disingenuous argument if you are honest with yourself...
---
Not dead, just no hands.
---
Well I get recommended every one of your videos anyways, so I might as well subscribe.
---
See you on a gate somewhere!
---
Imagine thinking you’re entitled to “due process” when you get removed from an internet spaceship video game community council.
---
Ah yes, the GOP. If course this is all politics now and we're supposed to pretend that the DNC are as pure as the wind driven snow. This sub if turning to shit.
---
I regret that I have but one upvote to give for this tale.
---
Yeah this guy is an idiot. Claiming to be a public figure greatly reduces your protections against libel and slander lol
---
Surely it could be any party; the greens, libertarians, independants... there's just so many of them!
---
You know, you seem awfully invested in politics for someone who wishes politics wasn't discussed on reddit.
---
I've heard 'Dickslap' and 'Fuckwit' but you sir, have successfully fused these disparate ideas in a single critical mass of insult. Well played.
---
I didn’t want this video to end.
---
You are such a lepton.
---
Enjoy your plat you brilliant wanker.
---
God save the Queen!
---
Tfw the sub is "turning to shit" when it is suggested we replace the party currently in power that has more corruption exposed every day with Icelandic vikings after a CSM member who used to be a republican politician and still lobbies for them is banned for space politics corruption. Also, this just in, if you disagree with one side you are automatically on the other side even if you don't think that.

Briscxit
---
Hahahaha
---
Goons really plunged that knife in deep
---
Hey, I'm proud of those losses! Took all of 2 minutes to kill me with all that on me
---
Haha, I thought this was a joke until I was sent a link, Karma is a right bitch.
---
It's a conglomerate of people that add up to less than an FC
---
So what the fuck does it do anyway? I wanna know what my stupid drunk idiot ass wasted $6 bucks on.
---
EULA ≠ NDA, any EULA violation could be dealt with as business as usual, i.e. no recourse for the affected, here they claim a NDA breach, which is something different entirely.
---
Well, more accurate would be to say majority of null is goon and pets. And Null is far more organised than HS.
---
LEGAL ADBLOCK, THE LOUNGE THING, AND A MONTH OF REDDIT PREMIUM AND SOME OF THAT GOLD THING
---
I'm not saying that is what should be done. I simply want to point out that by holding him to the same standards as everyone else, he would have just been banned. No devblog. My actual opinion on the matter is that he chose to be on the csm, and he should be held to a higher standard for it.
---
I hate that you're a goodposter.
---
Oh god the Lounge. Don't go there. If it's anything like it used to be it's an aids sundae with a gonorrhea nodule cherry on top.
---
It's the only thing keeping the commissar at bay.
---
Ah yes, we will be sure to give ol’ Brisc a good ribbing in- game. 
---
Anybody know his Epic gamer tag?
---
Don't worry, I've never been on reddit.
---
CCP does business in the US and if they want to continue to do business in the US, then yes, US laws do have a bearing in this case. They can be sued in US courts. They can choose to ignore the suit, but similarly, a judge could then bar them from taking money from US customers. Think they wanna take that chance?
---
Uhhh what? Unless I missed something in the devblog, you're missing a very important piece: CCP never actually identified Brisc by his name in the article, only his character name. 
---
It was Brisc *himself* who hamfistedly tied his EVE career to his real-life identity as a oublic figure. 
---
I didn't know a single CSM member's real life name until today. If they didn't actually identify him, Brisc **doxxed himself** - which perhaps the most comically stupid political move I've ever heard of.
---
F
---
It is. They permanently banned him and two other high-standing members of a huge alliance. And made a public post so we'd know why a high-standing CSM member was removed.
---
Based on the attention this is drawing to itself I think we are all expecting some transparency to this issue. To act like this it must be clear and evident or it just seems that eve is acting against someone whom has been critical of how it operates in a bid to shut down that criticism. 
---
Ccp please provide that evidence so that we are all correctly informed of the decision.
---
He ran for office in the past and lost like 40% to 59%, so he's at least tried.
---
&gt; “SILENCE!!!”
---
[I KILL YOU!](https://youtu.be/GBvfiCdk-jc?t=70)
---
How is the game doing compared to 1 or 2 years ago? I'm thinking of coming back again
---
Why only 1 year ban for 2 others and permanent for Brisc? Should be permanent for all 3.
---
And you?  
---
He's a public figure, CCP would need to have an intent of malice for there to be grounds for defamation.
---
Brax was silently banned for csm leaks irrc.
---
There was no collusion.
---
I waited for this, All day!
---
allegedly.
---
This is what I thought, also is there a character exchange free included in a bazaar sale or does CCP just transfer it? If not who typically pays the transfer fee, buyer or seller?
---
Lionel Hutz could have mounted a better defense
---
bring niv back :D
---
Keyword “past”.
---
No idea whether Brisc is guilty or whether the evidence is compelling but what you're suggesting is a really bad idea.
---
The only way to operate a multiplayer game across hundreds of legal jurisdictions is to get players to waive our rights as a condition of playing the game. Essentially we're guests in CCP's universe and we can be asked to leave not because they can prove X Y or Z against us but because it's their house and they can just say go without needing to justify it.
---
Clearly that's not pleasant and the occasional past mis-steps by CCP make that even less pleasant but that's the only way they can operate.
---
Otherwise all the bot owners and isk spammers would use legal methods to prevent the company from taking action against them.
---
So here it is: generally a games company will be pretty sure before it does a high profile banning like this. They know it will blow back disastrously if they get it wrong.
---
But they have to avoid creating precedents and explanations that allow their processes to be analysed by crowds of people and deconstructed. They need to not operate like a publicly accountable organisation but like the private game that they are. 
---
Releasing more information jeopardises their position as arbiter of what is allowed in Eve because - if it came it litigation - it could undermine their claim to not be accountable to players. And regardless of litigation it pits community managers and games dev against people who in the real world have pretty scary skills such as lawyer, investigator or politician.
---
For what it's worth I don't think it's fair to judge Brisc as anything other than unproven. CCP bans are not a court of law or a legal judgement and he hasn't received (nor is entitled to) due process. In particular I don't think you should judge the real life person on this one-sided process in a video game.
---
Googled.  I fully expected a Trump relative or Kardashian-ex.
---
Still don't know.
---
Bravo good sir, Bravo!
---
Here comes the pitchforks and hive minds... just remember who was on CSM when this next patch of awesome changes hits.
---
No, I actually rage rolled out C5 static to help them and urged others as well because fuck null.
---
:/
---
Other than Steve R., who on the CSM is popular?
---
Yep fuckslap wins it. Assclown just doesn't cut it anymore...
---
Pardon me, as I don't actually understand the law all that well, but the suit would have to be a defamation(libel?) suit filed by Brisc, correct? Is that potential suit hurt at all by Brisc's description of himself here as a "public figure"?
---
My understanding is that CCP can ban him at their discretion, so the only potential legal action that can come of this is a defamation(libel?) lawsuit about the blog post, right? And if it was a defamation lawsuit, is it true that CCP would only have to prove that they didn't show a reckless disregard for truth in the blog post? Seems like a relatively easy bar to hit.
---
Note: all of my vague assumptions are based on US law because I don't know 2 city names in Iceland, let alone how defamation works there.
---
Not bad but he aint no Hralti the true lord of posting.
---
EULA ≠ NDA
---
People don't seem to understand there are a lot of lobbyist organizations that do honest work. Especially when state and city governments are about to make really stupid laws or policy.
---
This post shows how ignorant you are. Its already a focus group.
---
can you expand on how this would be put into effect?
---
lmao. so why were there 6 gsm and 0 FW or WH representatives?
---
Those who can, lawyer. Those who can't, politic. Those who really can't, lobby.
---
Always pay seller.
---
There doesn't have to be malice for defamation.
---
Yeah I read the comment someone made about that. It sounded like a law student wrote it; any good lawyer knows that his seeming admission can be argued as not meaning "public figure" in the legal sense but only in the sense that lobbyists have to register with a public database, and/or that all lawyers are public figures because of our work. However, public figure in the legal sense means a person who is discussed in public, for example, celebrities or sports figures. He's admitted to be such notoriety.
---
Etc.
---
hurray drama
---
I was waiting on some form of this, thank you.
---
Thats not how this works.
---
Doesnt matter who made the link. The link is there and publix information.
---
You cant accuse brisc without accusing brians s.
---
gotta love hindsight
---
You said that's not what you were saying at all, and then just repeated what *he said* you said, except more explicitly.
---
If what you were suggesting were reasonable, then if I go out and make an inexorable connection to my real life identity with my in-game character through whatever means, I have created a sort of shield that I can use against CCP to claim that any statement made against my character in-game by CCP is actually made against me, even if CCP had absolutely nothing to do with connecting the two identities. That's absurd.
---
There does for public figures, which Brisc claimed he was in his post.
---
Yes, but this is the equivalent to getting in a car accident where someone gets seriously injured and admitting the entire accident was your fault, you instantly lose your ability to avoid a huge settlement.  You don't admit to things that hurt you, ever.  Make the other side prove it.
---
nothing says dont panic like multiple pings telling you to not panic
---
Too soon...
---
If it hurts his real life business? You can sure as fuck bet he will.
---
Yes, in Texas law, there needs to be grounds for malice, not just negligence. You cannot sue for defamation strictly on grounds of negligence unless the individual is a private figure, and not a public figure.  
---
Brisc is a public figure, not just a private figure, under Texas law.
---
They idea being CSM should be 2 people from each gameplay area. So you could do something like 2 Null, 2 Low Sec, 2 High Sec, 2 3rd party developers, 2 wormholes etc. That way they actually have the expertise to give feedback and kmprove the game in different areas. Instead we currently end up with a system where we have like 7 CFC on CSM because the only thing that matters to get on csm is that your alliance / coalition leader sends a mail telling everyone to vote for you
---
&gt;Innominate continued to sip his wine glass, which was in reality a mixture of every soda sprayed from the machine at the local McDonalds

*Hearty chuckle*

My typical response: "Exactly! it IS just a game, how low low are you willing to go to 'win'?"  (There were zero 'win conditions' in SWG, except for driving other players out of the game)
---
Above is the screenshot of when 'Brisc Rubel' hacked a rivals website, wiped it of all data and left this pic as the home page. Since they couldn't beat them in-game he resorted to his true favorite past time 'meta-gaming'. (isn't hacking illegal? ;)
---
STOP FUCKING PANICKING DUDE
---
&gt; ccp has accused him of a serious breach of ethics which will require reporting to his State's bar. 
---
&gt; Yep. I believe all state bars have a reporting requirement
---
You dum dum, we're talking about something that took place in a privately run online game, not some real life misconduct involving his work as an attorney. What have you been smoking?
---
He's from VA not TX btw
---
Okay it’s not just me, he seems guilty as fuck. Every sentence read like a guy caught with his hand in the cookie jar
---
EVE players voted for it. Is it really *that* hard to understand?
---
Well, that's the thing, if Brisc is being legit then he has grounds for a defamation case. Because this sort of thing _would_ damage his reputation in a way that would, in turn, damage his livelihood.
---
 The Convocation of Triglav outside the struggle recommends immolation
---
Yeah i read on myspace that the trig titan will be made up of 420 kikimoras
---
would this be picked by ccp or the players? ngl, your idea would stop the current conversation regarding Rubal seeking "expert advice" that seems to be what most people think led to him being kicked.
---
As if being a politician in Amercia holds any kind of value these days. Get rekt cunt
---
I hate you but thanks for the real story
---
Brisc, what have you done with this cigar?!
---
exactly. Its an elected comittee but how does that make it a focus group? A focus group is a group of deverse individuals brought together to give target feedback on a specific topic. How is the current CSM diverse in their gameplay in any way?
---
So dark shines did my first 10/10 with me back when I was a new bro. Years later I formed my own allaince with a few friends and got some blues then fc'd a cap fleet against him. I flew my first cap in a fleet with him as an fc. Only 8 caps but it was awesome. Dunked some dudes in low sec. He will be missed.
---
I haven't studied law in depth or are familiar with Icelandic law. However a US suit for defamation does differ if it's against a public figure or official; that person needs to prove in addition to negligent falsehood that there was malice in doing so. That is to say, CCP needs to have not only said something harmful and false, they need to have published *knowing* it was false or recklessly not caring about the falsehood. This unsurprisingly is a super hard standard to show (and is probably not even possible or accurate here) and doesn't exist if you don't up and decide you're a public figure like Brisc declared, so that was a very stupid move on his part. Here's [more detail about it](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/proving-fault-actual-malice-and-negligence). So a charge of defamation is pretty much right out the window already from that abomination of a damage control statement, regardless of whether Brisc is innocent or not. Someone who claims to be familiar with law really should know better if they intend to sue for defamation.
---
Pretty much the only avenue to go about it is to challenge whether or not he actually broke NDA. In that case CCP has to step forth and show he did do something wrong and make a breach of contract. If they failed this would mean the contract is still legitimate. Of course that still wouldn't mean they have any legal requirement to unban anyone or return any assets. I also have no idea what kind of contract the CSM is but I suspect they can tell CSM members to sod off whenever they feel like too, so I doubt he'd get CSMship back.
---
Though it would be amusing to have a CSM who is not allowed to play the game.
---
my mate almost won an election for a slab bet. 
---
he got to the debate planning on remaining mostly silent. realised all the other candidates were numpties and had no option but to argue with them. won the debate, got offered preference deals from other candidates and missed being elected by a couple of hundred votes. at one point he started shitting himself and researching how much of a pay cut he'd be taking.
---
he's still an engineer not a politician.
---
Idealy i believe it would be a bit of both. Players apply for elegibilty like current but ccp decides what catagory they can run in with there being limited spots in each catagory. players then vote on their top for each catagory.
---
I'm not saying this is (or isn't) the case here, but to answer your question in a general sense, I would assume that lawyers tend to push the boundaries so much more because they think they can exploit loopholes in contracts better than non-lawyers. Stereotypical lawyers (at least most every one I know, who are admittedly mostly people I knew in college who went on to become lawyers later) seem to think that they are the best lawyer in the system, unappreciated in their time, and that they're some sort of mastermind who will find their way around any legal challenge they want to, and bend the law to their will.
---
Shocking. A career politician lied and used privileged information for person gain. That isn't possible.
---
&gt;In the United States a private business cannot slander or defame a public figure.  They do not have immunity to execute free speech when that speech is harmful to an individual directly.  The media has a somewhat loose exemption here, unless the media agency acted with malice to damage or injure. CCP does not function in the capacity as a news agency, and it's postings and blogs cannot be construed to be news.  Therefore, CCP is not free from recourse from the player, especially with articles in the press covering this story with a clearly one-sided investigation that, according to the player, slanders the player individually.
---
I think calling him a player in this context damages your argument.  
---
This issue is specific to his violation of the NDA; that fact that he plays internet spaceships is completely irrelevant.  The NDA may as well of covered the location of the urinals.  the effect for Bric would be identical.
---
You don’t know if he broke a NDA or not. No evidence has been proven or shown. You’re only jumping on the hate band wagon of ccp banning him. The same ccp who has banned numerous people for false reasons
---
Anything for my biggest fan
---
Leaked csm info to Corp insiders
---
Tldr "I didnt do it"? As a us lawyer he should know what it makes him look when he writes 5k words of wasnt me.
---
The Emperor protects
---
is that a fat joke
---
Because ccp ran with allegations made up  by other csm members because he wasn’t bending to the rest of the summits popular wants for other major null blocks ideas
---
Sorry I was talking in terms of why there are 0 fw/wh reps. I don't know what the GSM actually does besides letting down the people who voted for them (noobman, manfred sideous, brisc etc).
---
&gt; CCP will solicit the CSM’s feedback on different aspects of EVE Online, and at different stages of feature development.
---
sounds like a focus group
---
No, if I wanted to talk about your mom I would've
---
Imagine a trig titan with a doomsday damage spool up
---
Sounds fun
---
To be fair, an out he gave to CCP and the general public by repeatedly and enthusiastically linking his real world to his game world.
---
Yes, but is truth *really* truth? I mean, if you think about it, it doesn't have to be "true" to be truth. You know?
---
But they so small and homogenous!!! /s
---
Thing is, this harms his reputation. I wouldn't be surprised if he sued.
---
Its one ping edited several times, as the screen shot says lol. Lexy can't type for shit
---
shut up seraph
---
delet this
---
uck you
---
Nah
---
hey, Hy is a good fc too.
---
Before my time I'm afraid.
---
If you haven't figured it out by now, CCP's enforcement actions are largely bullshit.
---
They habitually ignore cheating and EULA violation that are beyond obvious only to put on a theatre of enforcement whenever the complaints become too loud or hit the media.
---
If it seems like it will take a bit of effort to correctly identify the involved parties or obtain evidence, they aren't even remotely above randomly targeted action with a complete absence of justification.  I mean, what are the people they ban going to do, cry on reddit about it only to get mobbed by legions of fanboys?  It's not like CCP has to defend their actions.
---
I personally would have never believed it, but then it happened to me.
---
I don't really pay attention to csm stuff but doesn't ccp post a list of candidates along with information like to name and location each year?
---
The NDA he signed wasn't in game.
---
brisc rubal paid sans undertale to fuck my dad
---
Unrelated, but is "thinks to himself, 'self!'" an Expanse reference, or just something people say that I never noticed anyone say until Alex said it in The Expanse?
---
Not the best time to post about this amid massive drama. But this topic will be worth revisiting in a couple of weeks when the dust settles. Another case of someone who needs to get banned. More to come.
---
An NDA is an NDA.
---
shhhhhh
---
ah yeah see that, used to NC, no one enough fucks about spelling to edit pings
---
To uphold an NDA in bother England and America you must write a legal notice telling the person how the NDA has been violated and what the repercussions will be. CCP servers in England make them subject to British Law.
---
lexy is uhh a interesting individual
---
Haha I started making my own earlier today using this political classic. As soon as I read Brisc's response to the dev forum post minutes after it went up, I was suddenly transported to the late 90's. All of this has happened before, all of this will happen again™ (except now it's nerds and spaceships, but minor differences)
---
&gt;Immediately upon receipt of the email, I contacted CCP Dopamine and CCP Falcon to request information about the ban. As of the time of this writing, I have received no response from any one at CCP in response to my repeated inquiries. The lack of communication, transparency, and due process coupled with the rush to publicize my removal is indefensible and damaging to my reputation.
---
I...actually agree with this. Huh.
---
The CSM is no longer just the CSM if it starts to accuse real people of real-world ethics violations involving NDA contracts outside of the game. 
---
These allegations really could have a serious impact on Rubal's professional life. In any other venue, he would have every right to know exactly what he is accused of, what the evidence is, and just as importantly, *who* is making the accusations.
---
You can't even file a generic ethics complaint against an attorney without first disclosing exactly who you are, with your personal details and complaint in full being passed on to said attorney, because you can't adequately defend yourself if you aren't even informed of the allegations *before* your guilt is decided and action is taken.
---
I'm not making any assertions on whether or not Rubal is innocent or not, as I'm just some asshole, I don't know shit, but I can say that if CCP want to be big boys with serious business NDA contracts, then they're going to be held to a far higher standard than this. 
---
Forget the video game side of things, this is a public declaration from a company that an attorney knowingly broke an NDA and used confidential information for personal gain. That is a terrible, terrible look for a lawyer. *If* Rubal isn't full of shit and the evidence against him is weak -- or, Hell, with this community, outright fabricated -- then this really could have rough consequences for CCP.
---
This is not a court of law, this is Judge CCP. They are not required to, and do not turn over any evidence they have that lead to a ban. So forget about EVER seeing the evidence, it will not happen. CCP doesn't do this shit on a whim, when they do it's when they have damning evidence. Brisc fucked up and paid the price.
---
B I T C O N N E C T
---
I don't know who or this Brisc is but many of these conclusions seem like a long bow to draw. There is no conclusive evidence that brisc leaked any of that info. Seems that he had a difference in views and you dislike that fact.
---
&gt;As  ~~an attorney~~ clown and a ~~public figure~~ neckbeard in the United States, my ethics and  reputation are regulated by ~~a~~ code of ~~professional responsibility~~ Uedama and  ~~statutory~~ texas law
---
FTFY!
---
Not really, lawsuit can get filed, but that in no way means CCP will turn over any evidence. Pretty sure there are EULA clauses and NDA clauses stating that. So IF a lawsuit gets filed, I can see CCP's lawyers arguing, and winning a suppression motion to keep from having to turn over internal documents.
---
Good point, kinda blanked on that.  
---
Tachs do have a fairly similar range/tracking profile.  
---
Having said that tachs/cruise do only hit slightly over 300 dps without damage mods/implants/boosters/rigs.
---
I was banned for 12 hours before for saying in Jita  local:"CCP Fozie is James 315" you can banned for anything.
---
I upvoted a seraph and a querns post today.  Im not sure how I feel about this.
---
They may not announce the specific subject matter that he was accused of leaking. But they will have to answer the questions of what proof was presented, and by who, which in this case is way more interesting.

---
Again, that is something I see CCP as refusing to do, their lawyers making arguments, and winning said arguments. And that's assuming a Judge or Magistrate doesn't simply throw out the whole lawsuit to begin with.
---
It's a pretty good concern troll effort - you oughta spend less time moving goalposts, though. The backpedaling just makes you look wishy washy. Pick a theme and commit to it.
---
" Again, that is something I see CCP as refusing to do,  " They do actually have to prove they have  a valid reason to accuse brisc of violating the NDA, which does involve them showing the court evidence such a breach occurred. We may never get to see it, but they will have to prove something happened.

 Oooh, if you have never been to Alaska, go there while it is still  wild. My favorite uncle asked me if I wanted to go there, Uncle Sam. He  said if you don't go, you're going to jail. That is how Uncle Sam asks  you.  The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it.  Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do.  Anything. As long as you believe.  I remember when my Dad told me as a kid, ‘If you want to catch a  rabbit, stand behind a tree and make a noise like a carrot. Then when  the rabbit comes by you grab him.’ Works pretty good until you try to  figure out what kind of noise a carrot makes…  How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That’s your challenge for the day. T hey say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. A snail is, in loose terms, a shelled gastropod. The name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name snail is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word "snail" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Gastropods that naturally lack a shell, or have only an internal shell, are mostly called slugs, and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called semi-slugs.  Pokémon, the lovable little characters who have become favorites in  video games, TV cartoons, comic books, and toys, comes to the big screen  with this animated feature film. In a fantastic alternate universe,  there are 151 different varieties of the creatures called Pokemon, each  with its own unique talents. Many humans attempt to capture the Pokemon  and train them; the top trainers can teach the critters how to capture  and train other Pokemon, making them Pokemon Masters. Ash Ketchum is one  of the leading Pokemon Masters, and with his friends Misty, Brock, and  Pikachu (a Pokemon with electrical powers), he discovers Mewtwo, a  super-powered Pokemon created through biological engineering. Mewtwo has  powers of which a mere Pokemon can only dream, and when he uses his  skills to create even more super-Pokemon, Ash and his Pokemon friends  must join forces to battle for survival. A major box-office success when  released in Japan in 1998, Pokemon the First Movie was accompanied for  its 1999 U.S. release by a 22-minute short subject, Pikachu's Vacation.   Well . . . he lets it ruin his life. He gets so obsessed with going  after the one thing that hurt him that he loses sight of everything  else. He becomes isolated from everyone and everything. Paranoid. He  feels like he can't trust anyone around him ever. In the end, he loses  everything, even his life. And for what? Total stupidity, if you ask me A differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives. In applications, the functions usually represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the equation defines a relationship between the two. Because such relations are extremely common, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.
---
In pure mathematics, differential equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions—the set of functions that satisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.
---
If a closed-form expression for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.

This post is not about Brisc. I defended that CSM election system should change way before Brisc became a CSM himself.
---
Based on the amount of comments / threads etc. I'm going to say no, not by quite a bit. It is in the top 5ish of the last 2 years though.
---
The busiest was the mini summer of rage in 2016. That actually overtook Judgement day / Co2. Second busiest was when TEST brigaded that "Million Dollar War" thread to the #1 spot on r/all (from r/gaming). Those two events trounce everything else.
---
This is a contender for the #3 spot though - and #1 for purely organic activity (aka, not brigaded by another sub or the news). We'll see when the data comes in.
---
Every time I feel like I know how it be you go and pull back the curtain.
---
Reddit is a liberal hellhole if any political board is a sign, for some reason people still believe anything the media says.
---
Brisc, Shines, Pando ... I don't believe for a second that any of you are guilty of the infractions that have been alleged. I'm not just saying that because I'm a member of The Initiative. but because I simply know that none of you would've been stupid enough ... I call on @ccp_falcon to release evidence to substantiate the allegations against these individuals ... If they are guilty as charged then this should be no issue at all, if CCP is unable/unwilling to do this then all it does is give strength to the case for the defence ... Fingers, toes and everything else crossed for you fellas!!
---
Grr Orange Goons!
---
Not CCP's problem that this idiot used his rl for in-game gain. If anything legal actually happens he's just gonna make it worse.
---
I like them, they're pretty close, but not quite there I think
---
Funny coz that's not our Discord
---
Well it wasn't CCP that "caught them", it was Goons that "caught them" then tipped off CCP. Sounds a little sus. Probably involved a Titan sale or purchase and Shines/Pando said something like "Yeah Brisc said they're getting nerfed" and then Goon whoever screenshotted it and sent it to their representatives who then brought it to CCP.
---
DON'T PANIC MY DUDE!
---
I never moved the goalposts, and I'm not concern trolling. I really do think legacy member alliances should leave legacy. I just don't care that they're being used because I want them to be happy. I care because there was a time in this game where 2,00-5,000 man alliances in a coalition didn't need to be treated like minor corps in an alliance. TEST treats their coalition members like dog food, uses them to do the grunt work that supports their alliance, and then leaves them out to die when it becomes convenient (CO2? XiX?). They're terrible for this game.
---
BUT THE WORLD IS GOING TO END ... WHAT DO?
---
Absolutely glorious.

No, the #1 FC will forever be Mister Vee, even when he is winning EVE.

&gt; I unironically breathe goon penis
---
It's 7am and you already my day, thank you.
---
&gt; But these groups can be converted into self-governing bodies with CCP supervision.

Thus putting all of the power into who can politic, undermine, suborn, and generally meta the fuck out of those groups.

Norwegian Vikings held North of England for a decent period, and Danish held the south - the danes stayed longer and the Viking kings held England almost until the Normans came - who were - ironically, almost direct descendants of Vikings as well - the viking called Gangerolf being the most (in)famous one taking and occupying Normandy initially for the Vikings. But the first Vikings stayed so long in England and mixed so well with the population and the english language is filled with norse and completely nordic/scandinavian language words.   
---
A lot of english words referring to body parts are identical in english to scandinavian names and words for the same.  An arm is an arm, a hand is a hand in both languages, so is a leg, finger, etc. and its scattered throughout english language. The Norman invasion brought mainly french words as far as I know put possibly they still used a lot of scandinavian words as well.
---
if its abandoned just kill it and if it taking too long then you probably forgot to go siege green
---
Not really as long as CCP has the final say on who gets added and dropped.
---
NIP ended when FRT invaded Immensea
---
american corporate lobbyist, same type of people who lobbied for monosanto to not give cancer after it was proven it does
---
basically a morally bankrupt death peddler 
---
and you pretty much dont succeed in that world unless you are pretty much a diagnosed with sociopathic mental disorder
---
anyone who ever worked for a lobbyist can attest to that (unless that person themselves is as broken)
---
&gt; but now he shot himself in the foot by admitting that hes a "public figure".
---
But does it matter if he admits it? Is it purely a matter of self-definition? I kinda doubt it.
---
Now this is shitposting

I lost it at suitonia losing six kestrels a second, and again at the backstabbing joke. 10/10 you could’ve ended the Cold War with your propaganda.

Why not both?

You just won't see the smart ratters using it anymore.

The Skyrim nod at the end was pure, pluripotent perfection, Naz.

You've outdone yourself this time.

What do you have against shipworkers that you have this level of vitriol?
---
10/10 spin.
---
Imagine getting nuked from orbit for market manipulation via corax
---
The repercussions are hopefully in the NDA itself.  I don't see what stops them from sending a letter and banning at the same instant.
---
I dont know either. We should wait and see.
---
Outstanding!

And so is a cow. It’s a highly religious animal in Hinduism. One does not exclude the other. Though I agree not all ships have a religious meaning, such as the Kestrel, the Heron, the Cormorant, the Ibis, etc.

Cracks forming?
---
I must have said this a hundred times in the last five years, but here's 101: the NDA does not apply to what CSM members say about each other.
---
Noting of value was lost. Can we keep politics away from eve please.
---
It is not the responsibility of CCP to ensure that the actions of a player do not result in repercussions outside of EVE. CCP at no point in time has referenced to Brisc with personal information. However, Brisc has repeatedly shared his personal data and his position and job freely.
---
CCP called out a player by player name. That is all that they can be held responsible for.

If I, a random citizen, were to take up an issue important to my community to my representative I would be lobbying. If we hired an advocate to speak on our behalf they would be a lobbyist.
---
Lobbying is not a bad thing, or a bad profession. It can be abused, but that’s true of everything!
---
I'm sat comfortably on the 'wait and see' fence. I have my thoughts about the Rorq changes and how little they will actually impact the intended targets. Personally I was barely motivated to rat and mine in the first place. PI and tech 2 ship construction should get me through the twilight years or at least long enough for the impact of these changes to be felt.
---
Regardless, something needed to change. I am just hoping CCP are working on ways to allow people to generate income in a more engaging and fun way that isn't just at the mercy of RNG or based or grind-heavy.
---
This is bad...
---
Lol you mean you don’t want to sit there for an hour to kill it
---
See, that is wishful thinking.
---
CCP will not release any information to the public because it will break open a part of the NDA, as well as it revealing too much of their processes to combat cheating and corruption like this. You likely will never get an answer to that, as the release of such information can be very damaging to their efforts in combatting cheating, amongst things.
---
Excellent idea, should post it on the official forums too!
---
Unheard-of.
---
I have no problem with someone violating the NDA to be kicked off of the CSM, but I’d like to see that backed by an evidence-based motivation.
---
We’ve had more than one of us get the ban hammer for totally legitimate reasons, I’m going to want to assume that this applied here as well, but I’m not comfortable with bolt-out-of-the-blue decisions like this. This makes it look like someone did something very very stupid deliberately. I’d like to know that the decision was fairly reached.
---
happy cake day!
---
My eyes hurt...
---
Yes, something political perhaps.
---
The guy is a lobbyist.
---
When you show EVE players the line, they have a long history of sliding their ass right up to the line and shaking it at CCP so close to the line that the line lasers their ass hairs off.
---
This is all rather confusing. Does anyone actually know what dude did. Also lol at the lobbyist angst - at least half of you dummies (the ones with jobs) are almost certainly represented by lobbyists whether you realize it or not.
---
It happens thousands of times every day within every organisation on the planet - it's not hard to believe.
---
So you're telling me that another space person just left this infrastructure out here, unpowered, and I can't pick it up? Seems like their loss.
---
Accusing someone of breach of contract is something that has a factual basis, and is going to generally meet the malice requirement if provably untrue for any public figure.
---
Right now PLEX price is at an all-time highand starting to crash back down.  Look at the trend carefully before dumping all your assets into it, you might be better off with a different commodity.
---
that was one of the scenarios we were talking about. effectively using the structure as a lure
---
Stop fetishizing particles, it's 2019 for fuck sake. I bet you only date people of certain wavelengths too
---
due to privacy laws, they might not be allowed to publish the allegations? so, a lawsuit might actually be something they look forward, as that'd allow them to publish that information publicly (or, to the court, and it might be a public case)?
---
and finally: they're accusing him of a breach of the NDA; i'm quite certain that they have also an agreement in there that specifies which court is responsible for settling disputes in this kind of situation. and i very much doubt that it's in the us. however, i'm neither a lawyer nor associated with ccp, so i might be wrong on all accounts here. \*goes fetch some popcorn\*
---
I feel 42% more pacified by the multiple bold written "DON'T PANIC"...
---
Brisc broke NDA not the other two.
---
though a NDA i think would have specified a court for settling disputes, which i doubt would be in the US
---
This sounds right like a confession to me.
---
So the basic version of actual malice is, first of all, applied to the media, *not a partner in a business dealing* and secondly, only requires, knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of whether a statement is true or false.
---
In court terms this means, that if you put someone on blast for breaking an NDA via your own statement, and you ***don't*** have 100% ironclad, court ready proof of that, you will likely lose the defamation/libel lawsuit, if it even gets that far. Because your attorney is going to strongly encourage you to settle.
---
Having signed a CCP NDA myself in the past, it is very clear about what you can and cannot do. Mine was due to me being a volunteer moderator, as I had access to a series of private ingame channels, as well as direct Skype contact with high ranking members of CCP staff. If Mr. "Throws his toys out of his pram" there didn't read what he signed, that's 100% his own fault.
---
first rule of lawyer - never talk to the authorities.  
---
second rule of lawyer - a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.
---
I was also worried about the amount of scanning but I think a mix of the 3 options you gave would be best bet.  Carefully checking corps for wars was our old style of play - buddy list put an effective stop to that.  I think I'll replace that by simply assisting on every war I can.
---
gives the added bonus of I'm not fighting anyone who doesn't want to fight.
---
Looks like 90% of my corp is jumping ship in a few days anyway - off to play with the big boys
---
\*sets fire to everything\*
---
I'm not panicking. It's just stupid shit I do without guidance.

Getting down voted by the window lickers in this sub just mean you are correct.

Downvotes = accurate and well formed opinion.

Upvotes = you are an F1 monkey preaching to the choir.
---
Only true if here were to try and sue say, PC Gamer. The basic version of this requirement of actual malice is, first of all, only applied to the media, ***not*** *a party in a business contract* and secondly, only requires, knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of whether a statement is true or false in that context.
---
In court terms this means, that if you put someone on blast for breaking an NDA via your own statement, and you don't have 100% ironclad, court ready proof of that, you will likely lose the defamation/libel lawsuit, if it even gets that far.

Do not discuss with whom is written in the NDA as the other party besides you. End of story. Not even your wife. I work in a very sensitive IT area in IRL and i sign these all day, entering datacenters almost only in my underwear, no electronic devices on me. If feels like f\*cking 007, when someone asks me what i do for a living i just tell them i repair printers.
---
Harvey Birdman?
---
The CSM NDA actually has something very specific to say on this exact point, which I will feel comfortable talking about after my own NDA expires on May 12, 2019.
---
i wouldn't

lol

shit will drop even harder as people panic to sell their stock piles before the price gets too low
---
I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Allegedly.
---
gotcha, CCP will only add people who sign the NMA (Non-Meta Agreement) 🙄
---
Yeah, every company loves risking lawsuits and pissing off their playerbase for no reason..

Occam's razor says they checked first.
---
You can.

You look dumb.

Looking into Norse words in use in English the  list just goes on and on and on:

... berserk, ugly, muck, skull, knife, die, cake, trust, though, likely, gift, same, odd, wrong, knife, skull, slaughter, hell, heathen, husband, by-law, litmus, lead,  skill, troll, saga
---
...are just a few examples.
---
Or the completely ridiculous "we applied a shitty magic "dirt" photo-shop filter, so now alliance logos are transmogrified into our exclusive property"
---
The proper GSM way is to have the ISK ready to do the buy seconds after the official CCP announcement. 
---
At least wait until the day of the announcement so the daily volume chart shows no anomalies.
---
Really, no idea at all?
---
The morons think that internal affairs at CCP have not investigated this fully before implementing a ban.
---
CCP has no line of duty to release the evidence, why would they? Help people avoid being caught cheating the NDA in the future?
---
"(Interviewer) Is there a chance for a misunderstanding?"
---
"(Brisc) It's possible...." "If it is a mistake of a misunderstanding I'd like to get it resolved"
---
According to Brisc it's not possible it's 100% nailed on. You categorically deny any information disclosure, then say it is only possible that this is a misunderstanding. It's either a full on misunderstanding or it isn't, you being a point of fact should know full well and yet you keep weaseling around an admission of guilt.
---
&gt; That's just too much over a game.
---
EVE is not a game.
---
EVE is real.
---
-*IF*- it is true that the guy tried to make real life money off of internet space ships, and I don’t believe anyone of you motherfuckers further than I can throw them in a Jovian gravity well, then he did something truly stupid for which he should rightfully be punished.

IF it is true.

---
&gt; A politician using his position for personal gain? SAY INIT SO!
---
that makes me think, does ccp confiscate plex? or do they sell confiscated plex for isk?
---
if they would sell the plex before removing the confiscated value, it would slow down the price growth of plex as well create an additional isk sink.
---
since ppl banned tend to be rich. rich ppl tend to invest into plex more often than poor players (therefore more often than the games average). if ccp now bans a rich botter for example, they lower the plex/player ratio, which causes an increased growth of the plex price.
---
&gt; When did /r/eve turn into such a cancerous shithole?
---
How long have you been playing?
---
Well we already know CCP seems to have a love of pissing off the player base.
---
Didn't see much in the way of fallout. Held up really nicely though
---
&gt; Ethically flexible type.
---
I think that’s part of the job requirement of a lobbyist.

[Meanwhile, in INIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDAmPIq29ro)

Lobbyists really are just predictably scummy goddamn

I've been out of Eve for like 7 years but this is somehow very Eve and very relevant to today's politics. Oh CCCP, what a game you've made.

---
To give context for the strict rules for CSM it was created in the first place after another scandal of a Developer helping an in game group.
---
Specifically [The CSM was created after a pretty bad scandal where a Dev was a member of a major alliance, and was caught spawning in game items (BPOs) to benefit that alliance. The result was a breakdown in trust between the players and CCP, and the CSM was created to provide players with a direct voice to the developers.](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/what-exactly-is-the-csm/124371/6)
---
if CCP want to be bothered with useless CSM anyway, they simply can just randomly pick 7 dudes which have been active during actual year and send them ingame email.
---
If they reply, welcome onboard, if they dont, next random.
---
Simple, clean and no ineterest groups involved directly as now.
---
Well said Brisc.
---
For sure, I think everyone would feel better if they showed us the alleged activity.  More transparency will be better for all of us.
---
if only i could fit this much irony to my Vindicator
---
Just like real life
---
I agree. A normal player requires normal activity. But publicly throwing CSM out before telling them is shitty. If he did whatever, sure, fry him. But, how this has been handled is complete shit.
---
The NDA is a RL legal document. It's not spaceships make-believe law but actual RL law.
---
&gt;They never accused the person they accused the in game character
---
No, they accused the RL person of breaching a RL legal contract, which will have RL serious implications for his professional standing.
---
Great great post!!!!
---
That is a ping that was sent to INIT though.
---
Can somebody please seriously make naz posts into full fledged videos clear skies style or whatever jesus shit its good
---
How?
---
Whatever other csm members accused him of, CCP must have found evidence of it or otherwise not have taken action. OP most likely is full of shit.
---
Let's just say the CSM is the worst and have done
---
thats most subs lol
---
Sue for libel and defamation of character
---
&gt;Unfortunately everything that happened is within the EULA that everyone agrees to when starting up the game. 
---
EULAs only hold force within the game as they regard CCP's relationship with you as a customer. 
---
CCP can ban you, but if they tell everyone you broke a RL legal agreement and that has actual RL consequences for your professional standing, then hiding behind the EULA won't get them very far at all.
---
To use a hyperbolic example, if I own a pub I can bar you for whatever reason I like and you can't do much about it. If I bar you and put up a sign saying MORTEKI\_1 IS BARRED FOR BEING A RAPIST, then you still don't get to come and have a drink in my pub but you sure as shit can do something about the sign.
---
CCP can permaban Brisc all day if it pleases them. What they *can't* do is just go around telling the world and his dog that he broke a legal agreement without providing a particle of proof. Or even so much as an assertion of what he actually *did.*

It depends what they have in the jurisdiction clause of the CSM contract (NDA etc). If it says the courts of iceland or some other entity, he’s pretty much fucked and can’t do much about it
---
Giving the most connected players the most valuable information is a horrible concept. A popularity contest is the wrong way to find people who know the game.
---
Which proves that the Judge will be mostly remembered for having no hands

I dunno, I quite like the idea that it's a Goon conspiracy to WI. INIT into GSF.

I don't understand.

Have you ever seen Chirpy?

This weeks eve is dying thread?
---
You lost me at wardecs honestly I assume they didnt change them cuz they didnt know how muce damage they were doing or how to fix it in the first place. I actually like the new wardec system. The old one was just a way if bullying someone into not playing or learn to play in hostile space faster than they want *which I can agree the second is good but thats not what it did in practise most offen*
---
Yes I agree they need a solution to the rorq that isnt just nerf it into the ground. But it seems they want to nerf it into the ground instead of fixing the issues. Being that its basically afk proof. Which is honestly the bigger isse. If you had to micro it like a hulk oh god watch how fast the numbers drop.
---
Anyways. There is no game like eve.. I doubt there will be eve more so with todays culture.  A mainstream title cant survive if its got eves *freedom* 
---
Freedom being kill anything, steal anything scam anyone... new snowflakes dont like that.
---
If someone has the guts to build a game with eves core ideals most of us could flock to it but eve offers a lot tho in one package yes its a variation of being in a ship in space doing something but most games are your a person doing something somewhere right.  Idk.. Rambling now I think lol
---
I am sure they are guilty. CCP took a great risk here. CSM was a controversy for some of us and to come out with a thing like this they knew it will bring huge attention and create a shitstorm. This plus the fact they banned 2 others means they have logs and proofs beyond doubt. This people are fucking cheaters and deserve to be purged from the game.
---
Ok. Bye bye

Just don’t go roaming in delve or you will have boson titans dropped on you even if you are in a frigate and I’m not exaggerating.

Probably what is interesting for you is to check the balance of powers.

Winter Coalition (Frat+friends) is a fairly new Chinese coalition that has shaken the balance of powers dramatically

CCP had to appoint a CPM for Dust 514 after the first elected group didn’t really work. The appointed focus group was actually great.

You get these threads because folks are fearful of the games future, I am, I was too young to play in the games early days (I joined when I was 16) and so I only get to see it’s decline rather then it’s triumph. A big part of me would have loved to join around 06 or what not. Also snowflakes? You do realise that games like rust and dayZ which are extremely punishing and rough games were basically top tier in popularity until a couple of years ago right? Those were primarily played by folks in this generation

thank you for your thorough explanation.

I currently use extractor planets too, P0-P1, but they are all the same resource on each planet. Mainly because then i know if i hit the 24k avg units per hour. 
---
The issue is, like you mentioned the migration of these hotspots, meaning i either have to relocate the factories every 2 weeks entirely, or move the extractors very far away.
---
Would you advise me to switch over to 2 different P1's on each extractor planet? I looked at resource density on each planet and currently extract what is most dense. Meaning that some planets get one particular P0 sucked out of them and nothing else.
---
&gt; Someone who claims to be familiar with law really should know better if they intend to sue for defamation.

they should also really know better than to throw around words like "due process" regarding this situation

---
From smoke filled backroom fanfic to a goddamn Skyrim intro. Masterpiece.
---
he also claims (in this post) that he's a public figure. in us law*, to defame a public figure you have to defame them with a falsehood, knowingly, with malice. best case scenario ccp are just idiots who didn't do enough research, which doesn't meet that threshold
---
*whether or not this precedent applies depends on what jurisdiction hears the (potential) case

You're supposed to pop the cans that have nothing/crap in them.

You don’t know this. A napkin signed in a bar is still legally binding. But this is just for humor sake

Same, at this point I want this to all be an elaborate backstab.

Skyrim belongs to the nords!!!

This seems to be causing pandomonium amongst INIT to lose their top FC's is a real dark shiner to get. But to make matters worse Brisc is a fucking lawyer that people trusted.

EVE 2
---
Duh
---
follow @doomchinchilla on twitter
---
Can I get a quick rundown? I don't know what Eve is or who this guy is but this is somewhat important and I'd like to know, thanks.
---
&gt; Regardless I'm pretty sure CCP wouldn't ban him for a weak reason
---
Having followed ccp banning activities i would't look for much logic or consistance.
---
Reminds me of crypto, really.
---
iirc it exists as a form of first amendment protection for the press - they're allowed to report on speculation and rumors about public figures without being afraid to get sued if the rumors turn out to be completely false, as long as they publish them with the intent to publish news, not the intent to defame the person
---
Good luck. I hope that you will sort this nonsense fast!
---
wonder if that has anything to do with the "Eve Intel Bot" part.
---
zzz.
---
A book about your 8 step program
---
&gt; I can't imagine a world where being a lobbyist is considered public life
---
a reasonably sized part of his job is testifying to congress and he has appeared on c-span a couple of times. he's closer to a public figure than i am
---
Cargo scanner is core modules for real end-game explorers. It is not for cherry picking on regular relic and data sites, but instead for speedrunning sleeper caches AND find the big value loot on ghost sites.
---
CCP is mindless as always.
---
Because the body originally formed to hold CCP accountable to the will of the playerbase is best when it is accountable only to CCP.
---
Ever heard the expression, "never set the chickens to guard the grain"?
---
I mean its a GSM and goons prolly wouldnt hurt a member of the Imperium for fun, Steve Ronuken has no reason to, much like Suitonia, Sort is up goons ass anyway. The only one who would have a reason to is killahbee but the man is an FC, not the kind of paperpusher that would apply this kind of tactic. Aside from the point that the article sounded like it have been multiple CSM members. So tbh you should take off the tinfoil hat off (or use some more tinfoil and assume it was a plan by Aryth to discredit CCP by making them react on false information)
---
Largely because it generates conflict, and unlike in the real world things that generate conflict are encouraged.
---
&gt; hold CCP accountable
---
This is not the goal of CSM. It's a glorified focus group. Companies pick their focus groups. CCP picked focus groups before.
---
Besides, they don't determine exactly who goes to Iceland under my proposal.

---
When you're so high on your horse that you retaliate on an elected player on a volunteer panel and publicly shun them without even confronting them.
---
This clearly wasn't a decision made by lawyers. This was developers being trigger happy with  their banhammer. It happend before and it will happen again.
---
Also, love that the court of public opinion is already churning out. The other day Brisc was as cool as a cucumber, now everyone has come out to badmouth him.
---
We need the googly eyes gif version.
---
&gt;multiple
---
It's actually a single don't panic ping pasted 6 times in the screenshot, but ok.
---
Brisc Rubal appears to have thought that, just like the real world, his actions would have no consequences past a vehement denial.
---
He has learned a new lesson today.
---
The problem with CSM is that at some point they started representing bigger coalitions instead of normal players.
---
On the other hand we choosed them. Ccp gave us opportunity to choose people which will represent us. They didn't have to do it. They could just make all decisions by themselves
---
Well according to some of the streams I've listen to they do confiscate and hold it to introduce back into the economy
---
From the PCGamer magazine 
---
&gt; But maybe tying his real-life political identity to his in-game one wasn't the smartest idea. 
---
Maybe?
---
Anyone care about this olmeca guy?
---
wow thanks ill look into this and see if i can find one im looking for :)
---
Except no. Noone, no matter his profession should be able to tie CCP's hands and do shit with them only being able to watch by publicly linking his IRL identity to his ingame one. That shit is entirely on him.
---
So, I don't play Eve and just follow the lovely drama it generates, but what's the general consensus on this guy?  
---
Guilty or probably the best black op in Eve history?
---
the only turn and burn i wanna see are those funky SpaceX boosters coming back from orbit, along w/ my sides after reading this post

---
&gt; It's a smear, plain and simple, unless they present all of the evidence.
---
From my limited knowledge of US law, this might be key. Truth is a valid defense for libel, and while I don't know the boundaries of that, i.e. whether or not having the perception of being in the right after having investigated to the best of your abilities is enough, when it comes to blows, CCP just have to present the data they used to justify the ban. 
---
In that case, as a potential suit would gain the attention of many people, if CCP is right, Mr. Rubal's career will most likely really suffer, which makes pursuing this matter any further a gamble.
---
As an aside, insider trading is exceptionally easy to prove if it's done in any significant quantity. In Guild Wars 2, I've known people that got kicked out of the partner program because of it, and since then you've had posts every couple of big patches that some crafting recipe got changed because some idiot tried to cash in before the patch was out. What I want to say is, if the studio has an eye on the market (and I assume CCP does, as economy is such an important factor in Eve), they will not ignore unusual movements.
---
all 350.000 of them...
---
And then theres lobbyists that cause these stupid laws - see article 13 in the EU
---
I just googled this. 10/10
---
Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
---
Oh those guys......... no their just coffee boys not strat FC’s, TBH i barely know them

Can we consider FOBs as capital class PVE? Is tere actually any PVE that is meant do be done by caps? (Not talking of Havens and Sanctums ofc ).

I’m betting it was the plex discount, leading to pumping the price up and dumping on discount days for fat loots.

Does the US recognise precedent from Canada? I know over here international case law isn't recognised as binding, but if it's a rare or exceptional case, it *can* be accepted as guiding.

Bris is now an indelible part of New Eden’s history :-).
---
Not really.  The sides aren't even remotely balanced. There's a reason there are very few indictments in Democratic administrations and they're as common as flies on shit in Republican administrations.
---
Wait US lobbiest breaks a rule and now has to take the consequence.. wait CCP is actually archiving things not even the UN archived so far? Please continue... This denial is typically for a "politician".. disgusting not even to take the consequence..
---
Furthermore I want to point out that some involved in this had been banned some years ago for using macros / bots...
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/NHrsn15JJqPNS/giphy.gif
---
That’s what I’m saying.
---
Breaking the NDA would be an insta-ban from the CSM, we’ve seen it before, but a permaban from EVE... that’s not something CCP does lightly. If they go so far as permaban the guy... I’m going to think there’s something going on that’s worse than someone calling someone else poopiehead.
---
The DayZ Arma 2 mos was way more popular than DayZ stand-alone, probably same amount of players as eve during its peak according to steam, but again DayZ died off due to bad execution but you’ve made a good point.
---
The fact is,  if some one is dishonest then they will be dishonest regardless.  There is nothing stopping people just telling someone what's in those meetings, stopping electronic devices does nothing tbh.  How do you know other CSM members haven't been leaking Info? You dont and I bet they have
---
CCP wont break their own NDA.
---
So who was saying that eve is dying?
---
A good reminder after 16 years in eve, its a game, keep is at a game and seperate it from your real life.
---
&gt; It is not for cherry picking on regular relic and data sites
---
But that's exactly what I see all the time, some regions are because of it not worth exploring because its full of cherry pickers.
---
&gt; but instead for speedrunning sleeper caches AND find the big value loot on ghost sites.
---
For sleeper caches I can understand it somewhat, but just for that its not worth sacrificing a mid slot. And in ghost sites you can hack one additional container in the time it takes you to scan the cans if you are a "end-game explorer".
---
Interesting proposition... especially the part which you mentioned that you are public figure. What were you trying to do? Increase your credibility? And now seeking public support against ccp? I’d love to see what’s going to happen If this turned out to be true, using irl identity to increase credibility in game will successfully degrade you irl if this turns out to be true :))).   Need update
---
They had a nice [fallout retrospective](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-complete-history-of-fallout/) recently.
---
Though many people don't do that, that's why I always get a little bit pissed if people are suggesting to fit a cargo scanner for exploration.
---
&gt; eca
---
LOL
---
does the signed copy contain NDA leaks in the custom greeting ?
---
Does it have a “destruction” economy like eve?
---
Sorry I only had one "Are you stupid enough to trust me" token today and I was torn between you and Carlos Ghosn, and he won.
---
And that's saying something.
---
I thought that ended up giving you a lower virus strength?
---
&gt; On the other hand we choosed them. 
---
We didn't choose them. Elections favor infrastructure and organization. Null alliances already have those due to the fact that their playstyle necessitates them. Others don't bother to create them just for CSM elections. Thus they get chosen. Nobody can talk about "people's choice" when the voter turnout is below 10%.
---
Of course CCP doesn't have to listen to players. But if it does listen, I propose, that there is a better way which they can choose who to listen.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
I'm confused why someone would post an official I got banned from a space game statement on his official Twitter, especially in the position he is?
---
Epic mate
---
They didn't accuse him of EULA breach, they accused him of NDA breach, and that is attached to your real life. In the legal profession you also have to disclose that sort of stuff to regulatory agencies.
---
Now imagine the twist: CSM conspired to troll CCP about Brisc for the lulz, the game is up, CCP purges CSM &amp; bans Imperium from candidacy, CSM XIV is lowsec/FW/WH people...
---
depending on the incursion group you join.
---
nothing beats the high skillpoint, expensive choices of course.
---
but shield buffer rattlesnakes, hyperions, and i think rokhs still do help out. but you would pretty much be aiming to earn until you could afford one of the better choices, rattlesnake, vindicator, nightmare.
---
3months in eve is considered short timewise, although it feels long. just continue as you are, all that early game skilling is great as the game is pretty limited until you get alot of the skills up and running
---
He was always worse than StainGuy
---
TBH i gotta admit that if they are no actual evidence... that sounds kinda wrong.
---
At this point it's not space pixels. It's CCP's business.
---
sometimes its not you that crosses that line but other peoples, keep in mind this isnt always a choice on your very own end but a choice of other peoples doing the connection between your own real life and the "eve" life.
---
I knew it. It were the goons 😮 come init join the other side leave imperium if been told we got cookies or hotpockets
---
NDAs are agreed with real people. Since yer man is a lawyer IRL there will be requirements to register the NDA breach allegation with regulatory agencies. That's IRL consequences. Your space rules have no power here.
---
Cant wait until this hits the RL news cycle.... everyone f5 your news source of choice.
---
Alpha is like an unlimited trial period but if you want to get into the game you need to sub, 1 account isn’t too much money to sub assuming you live in a wealthy country.
---
Yep, and the proof probably contains confidential information, CCP wont break their own NDA to give some reddit pubbies evidence.
---
[removed]
---
I hear Star Citizen is gonna be great someday.
---
Disputes of the NDA, sure.  However, defamation is separate.
---
Yes, attorneys and lobbyists are very trustworthy these days... They have high moral standards and will never ever seek to enrich a small select group of people/corporations.
---
+1 to CCP reputation for all I care.
---
You can fit some weapon in it, for blowing of other unarmed explorers or the rouge drones that can spawn in rouge drone data sites. Some time ago I did fly a buzzard with one polarized blaster and managed to score a few kills in it.
---

Strong comp, wp
---
That's why the guy has a bot to post pings for them. Quite clever to be honest, no need to have people with the spies watching the pings and reporting them themselves. The bot probably relays pings from as many corps / alliances they want.

---
that's not entirely far from the truth i suppose. i suppose you could say winet started wwb by pissing off iwantisk, who are the people who bankrolled the war against goons
---
&gt; someday
---
You're s genious.
---
&gt; Depends on the jurisdiction. In most common law countries, this is merely a defense. It's not a complete exoneration since there are damages and asymmetrical responses to consider.
---
That's objectively false.
---
In most jurisdictions I'm aware of, including many parts of the US, truthfulness is absolutely a complete defense, quite simply because libel is a defamation suit, and a defamation suit must *by definition* rest on the falsity of the statement. That's what defamation is. 
---
In addition, most courts by doctrine (and some by law) accept truth by substance (ie. the statement was at it's core true, even if some details were off). 
---
Standard disclaimer that this isn't and shouldn't be taken as legal advice, I don't guarantee it's accuracy, completeness or validity and you should neither act nor rely on this information.
---
The EULA pretty much states that CCP reserves the right to ban at its sole discretion, without explanation.
---
I believe they are choosing to leverage the EULA in this case.
---
Idk, I'm expecting a Brisc Rubal CSM Removal SKIN sale in a few days.
---
i hate to agree w/ code, esp in politics, but as a European i can just agree and say that the dems are having a shitshow at the moment
---
he was init, not goon
---
I'm a simple bee, I see Olmeca post, I downvote
---
when they gunna perma ban daddy noraus?
---
The fact that he got caught could be more damaging professionally than the ethical violation itself.
---
AAR?
---
,you are banned. Deal with it.
---
Unbanning ppl because they are fcs or content creators isnt a argument.
---
tbh even if you are a grr-goons, you should not follow the first crazy guy in town yelling at everything
---
Covert cyno
---
This is why they mentioned the character Brisc Rubal by name and not the person who uses that character. The character as an entity is owned by a company in Sweden. CCP's legal team obviously had a long and hard talk about this. Further more Brisc would need to explain and prove that this entity known as Brisc in some contributes to his professional life and that he, further more, is able to extract value from that. More correctly, that his livelihood somehow depends on the entity known as Brisc Rubal. If he can prove all of these things it will not change the ban. If he tried to fight them in court they would simply deny him access to Eve online which at the end of the day the man wants to play. This approach was possibly the worse strategic move possible if his goal is to play eve online again. If it is to sue ccp its a much better approach. But if he ever hopes to be in tranquility again he's dumb and should really rethink his approach.
---
Thing is, US law is retarded regarding EULA and tends to respect the clause where all applicable suits should be done in Iceland.
---
Good luck finding a judge to overule that and actually agree to a hearing in the US.
---
If he were in the EU I would agree with you.
---
I actually killed POS with very small crews, and even solo.
---
And used towers as bait too.
---
INIT aren’t Goons!!!!
---
To be fair I think CCP is in deep shit if they don't have the proof against Brisc. Just because he was stupid enough to mix games with his professional life, which lead to things such as certain news outlets picking up the story. Pando and Shines just have to be happy with the early unban.
---
I also 100% believe that CCP has the proof needed, they just don't get rid of someone like this because they feel like it. If the intel they have turns out to be false CCP is in pretty deep shit regardless, which they certainly don't want.
---
Probably so, because it would be years in the future.
---
If it was judged today it would not be released at it could impact the business.
---
For me it was Kendar with the AK
---
most people here aren't gonna be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on this for the same reason - he's an insufferable fucking clown
---
just makes you think, maybe fostering community goodwill would have been a better move
---
@channel @everyone @here
---
He might get killed.
---
i don't fully agree, CSM members don't always need to be a specialist in a certain area, they are also a point of contact for the people they represent. A person you can tell your problems and solutions too.
---
Like when some1 wants BPCs to  be stack-able too a fixed limit.
---
they don't always need to know, they need to be able to filter out what is good or semi good, turn it into something good and then bring it up to ccp
---
I agree with you on that point, was just noting that it wasn't "virtual".
---
They probably do shittier things everyday.
---
if the facts match the rumors, brisc didn't decide to use the nda to get ahead - he shared information with alliance member #1, who shared that information with alliance member #2, who decided to use that information to get ahead
---
All of them!
---
hi bisu hope you're well
---
shines and pando aren't perma'd, if the bans even stand. they'll be back. you don't get that space-important without being addicted
---
Yeah, often with a scanning alt in system so they can probe a chain should shooting happen. And anyway CCP will eventually remove and reimburse them...

wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow

Run 2 out of 4 cans in a ghost site and potentialy miss the 5b BPC in Superior ones ? I wont do that. Also why would you "sacrifice" a mid slot ? Usualy you run : 
---
-Integrated Analyzer (Zeugma for instance)
---
-Faction scram
---
-Prop (AF or MWD)
---
-Cargo Scanner
---
Nor does it apply to what CCP says, it applies to what the CSM say about what CCP told them.
---
CCP is completely free to say whatever they want about this ban.
---
&gt;"Not backstabs," everyone in the room replied.
---
I should think so, they are copyrighted by Snuffed Out.

Ending was 5/7

He signed the NDA with his real name, because its a real world legal contract, thats how it works.

You Kinda a pulled a Judge on Init you are super famous now!

No

This is how it should've been done

Not at all, EUTZ (18-21ish EVE time) is generally when EVE has the most players active.

See https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
Thank you, 5/7 drama. Very good entertainment. Get fucked buddy.
---
&gt; is the EU timezone dead?
---
No, but DST in the EU will be soon.
---
It seems like it honestly, thing is for us EU guys that have work and whatever usually get on around noon-evening when it’s usually morning/day time for the US guys, so possibly that’s why it seems more active at night as both time zones kind of collide.
---
But honestly as an EU player if I wanted to experience the most content I’d have to be up between 10pm-6am gmt +3, just my personal experience.
---
CCP would never fuck up
---
CCP would never ban people for stupid reasons
---
therefore brisc deserved to be ban right?
---
Superb post: It needs to made sticky.
---
IT'S NOT A BUBBLE
---
This is quite simply delightful.
---
Well, there's this [Astrox Imperium](https://store.steampowered.com/app/954870/Astrox_Imperium/).
---
&gt; Astrox Imperium is my attempt to create the space game that I wanted to play, but no one had created. I wanted a single player, open-world space game that is similar to games I enjoyed, like Homeworld and EVE, with economies, factions, and a story..
---
Haven't tried it myself, and it's an early access game, but who knows, might be what you're looking for.
---
A lobbyist is not a politician, as he is not running for elected office.  A former one?  Sure, but not now.
---
And as such, CCP will be extremely careful about how they proceed. CCP does a great many things wrong, but when it comes to legal repercussions, they are highly unlikely to play it simple.
---
Furthermore, while reporting such may be neccesary in some states, it isn't the case everywhere else. CCP is not responsible for Brisc Rubal wrangling with law in VA, as their operations are not based there. Any consequences in VA that follow due to Brisc signing an NDA for a videogame, are his burden to bear.
---
"High profile"...he is a maritime law lobbyist.  That isn't exactly high profile.
---
Aww thanks man
---
pls yes
---
I don't give a shit about that what I do care about is you messing with my religion.  Seriously how do you think we get our horns? Drinking blood is the only way!!!
---
A *Republican* lawyer and lobbyist
---
Not a politician, he is a lobbyist, there is a difference.  Politicians are elected criminals, lobbyists are hired criminals.
---
He’s also selling popcorn futures when he expects the price to rise. He’s not very astute.
---
They might also have spouses with a sudden interest in playing EVE. At least I heard this happened for someone else in the past.
---
autist faggots like you are the reason why abortions should be more common
---
You might be in a game region where most people playing are from USA.
---
There are a lot of players in the EU timezone too and most players are between 20 and 22 GMT when both EU and parts of US intersect.
---
And we all hope he does, he is magnificent
---
So, you state in your little post that the focus group members themselves would choose who else was in the group.  In before GSF has all focus group members within a year.

You should really think things through before putting pen to paper Olmeca Bronze.

Oh I appreciate you may have meant it about a keepstar getting omegablobbed. You'll note the only thing remarkable about that story from the perspective of the media was ***how damn long it took you to prepare for it***.

Judging by the sperging on reddit, definitely guilty as charged.

But then again, that's reddit, everyone and everything is guilty until proven otherwise.

For my part, well, he's an american lobbyist. Wouldn't trust him in the slightest.

They should get Vee back in-game to smooth the transition, though, of course, his brand of 'elitism' got stomped out as well.

looks like you need an attorney, i seem to know a guy who does that, he is even a lobbyist and knows brisc VERY well
---
You were on the CSM?
---
Is it just me or was that forum layout way better than the current design?
---
Was he also perma banned?
---
mabye one with hands
---
Wow, I had to double check who posted it!
---
I already down voted without knowing it was them.
---
Judge gets upvoted for once. What is this.
---
"Politician" lmao. He ran for office once and lost by a 20 point margin. Before that he was a lobbyist and after that he was a lobbyist.
---
Shocking no one has pointed the fingers at Russians.
---
God I miss the old forums. Not the OLD old forums, they were awful, but the ones in that link. How have we managed to so badly devolve forums and communication in general the last decade or so?
---
I mean, for desktops at any rate.
---
Except for the word "gift" which means both poison (the thing that kills you) and marry (getting married will also get you killed).

Killah Bee wants to know if you’ll take bribes to build a narrative for him?

Your stance on lobbyists shows your lack of knowledge about how politics work.  
---
Politicians cannot make informed decisions without lobbyists.
---
if you check again you might notice that this was posted long before the Brisc drama.
---
KenZoku is recruiting ... too soon?
---
Yeah, quite honestly if you have to deal with him you have to have the patience of a psychiatrist. That is how delusional he is. But you gotta give it to him, he brings content to everyone he encounters.
---
i guess.. but the defamation was of his ingame character, not the person (that was as i understand it done by himself). but even then, it'd only be defamation if it wasn't true, which would be settled by the NDA related lawsuit i think? however, i'm not a lawyer, and i didn't look at the relevant laws either as i'm neither a citizen of iceland nor a citizen of the usa

The only IRL politician in CSM turns out to be corrupt. A lesson to remember: don't vote for politicians.

\&gt;"Not backstabs," everyone in the room replied.
---
\&gt;"Oh." He sat back down in disappointment.
---
on fucking point
---
The RL career was the mechanic used to get him elected.  Without it he's just some other nerd playing computer games like us ;)
---
It is. Whenever CCP changes the forum layout it becomes more bloated with empty space and gimmicks then the last one because :modern:
---
Free to play has not really affected the game, the active players that like the game become omega anyways.
---
It is possible to play as alpha but you will eventually be annoyed by it, also many corps don't recruit alphas.
---
Paying the sub with isk is not possible anymore without making the game your job, the price skyrocketed.
---
The game is heavily stagnated in nullsec due to capital proliferation, lowsec hasn't seen changes in ages, but you can have fun as always, just need the right group, so no fear of moving until you find a really good fit.
---
to my knowledge they weren't kicked, they rather declared they are going to invade cobalt edge to kick HK renters out. Funny as balls.
---
Glad we aren't blowing this all out of proportion without any actual evidence...
---
No, having CCP oversee the markets doesn't generate conflict any more than CONCORD patrolling hisec does. Who are you going to fight? CCP?
---
I was laughing at this for about 5 minutes. My wife kept asking what was so funny. Sigh. If only she knew.
---
While I wouldn't want to remove the CSM, at first glance it do sound better if we don't only elect players based on how many votes they get. There should still be some sort of voting, but instead CCP should add categories so that all aspects of the game gets a rep.
---
Q: How can we be certain the CIA wasn’t involved in the Kennedy assassination?
---
A: He’s dead, isn’t he?
---
I mean it's a good thing no one gives a fuck what PGL thinks. We all just ridicule him when he does stupid shit (like losing half a nightmare fleet to bombers, going mega-emo mode, and standing down ~5 fleets because he fucked up.)
---
Yeah those forums were great, also the ability to log in there and read your evemail and notifications, the newest iteration was better left undone.
---
How do you kill, that which has no life?

Or just ban those who do it and keep the CSM since they bring a lot to the community ?

No he was an active FC in some of the later great wars, still is around.
---
Iam kind a SHOCKED too... who would have guessed :D
---
More, MORE!
---
stop I'm having flashbacks
---
it's "sang", not "singed"
---
Wonder how much the cutbacks, staff changes and loss of talent at CCP are to blame for the current mess, since this is on track to become a real mess, at least compared to the incident with Manny.
---
No, I know exactly how they work, I just still don't think they're that big of a deal. Very small potatoes in comparison with other shit that is wrong with this game.
---
I mean they literally can't
---
Schrodinger CSM, beign both a corrupting entity yet also throwing leakers to CCP.
---
MAKE RUBAL GREAT AGAIN!
---
Cannot agree more :) Said pretty much the exact same thing yesterday when i was talking to corp m8s. Steve is the "of course he gets on my list"-candidate for CSM. :)
---
Tut tut, well they have retro-banned before so he may still not be safe.
---
I'm probably retarded but I don't see much difference.

i find it a bit funny that a real life marine industry lobbyist is also a submarines in space video game lobbyist

Can somebody explain to me? I don't play EVE online but like the stories from the game though
---
The drifter battleship tracks poorly if you orbit close. Spiral in at first. It starts with very low shields so the sooner you engage the less it regenerates.
---
I didn't say that. I was responding to
---
&gt;T2 mat cartels like the old early 2010s OPEC are beautiful examples of what makes EVE special.
---
by agreeing with you. The good thing in my opinion about those cartels is the large-scale content they can generate, an example being OTEC and the resulting war between the CFC and HBC.

---
Whom'st've'st indeed...
---
Deliberately taking your role as a RL politician into account kinda defeats the purpose of your plea and if anything, makes you look *less* thrustworthy. Not smart.
---
 The fact it took CSM members to throw this guy under the bus shows CCP never enforced the NDA and possibly allowed countless tiny leaks over the years by just ignorance
---
Everytime I read something like this, I just want to cancel my subscription and move on...
---
Really? how is it a mess. Some people got banned for cheating. Kind of the end of the story.
---
oh man... that's a tough one to explain to my colleagues after I spat my tea all over my desk laughing my ass of. your writing is awesome man. keep it up
---
The circumstances demanded a Brisc response.
---
&gt;CCP never enforced the NDA and possibly allowed countless tiny leaks over the years by just ignorance
---
It's kind of you to say ignorance there. Let's hope that pure incompetence from ccp is all that was in play.
---
In the same way that using an artist's non-legal stage-name or author's nom-de-plume can constitute libel or slander, any name which you are known by as a proxy for your reputation is subject to those laws (in the US; no idea about Iceland). The NDA was signed by him not using his toon name, and the claim of NDA breach is therefore directed against him and not his toon, whether the blog post uses his RL name or not.
---
Aren't FOBs in HS where you can't use capitals ?
---
cloaky camp or gate camp ?
---
Offering an example from almost 4 years ago under different ownership and different management as equivalent to what happened yesterday is a pretty big stretch. 
---
However, it is also unsurprising given your source is still desperately grasping at anything that will give him relevance, so...
---
The Zeugma takes bonuses from both Hacking and Archaeology. So while the base stat for virus strength is lower, it is much higher after both sets of bonuses are applied. I'm sitting at a strength of 60 between Zeugma and a Blackglass, and I haven't failed a can in months except on purpose to pop an empty.
---
don't you think it's fitting the way that weapons scale as well? if you kept them on titans but removed their damage bonus, like they did with rapid lights on the drake and drake navy, as the intention of titans was to shoot structures and other caps, never subcaps
---
Id say the game is a bit worse but future looks brighter.
---
Supercapital proliferation became a thing, as do ratting titans btw. The economy took a hit and so did plex.
---
But ccp started addressing the core issues pf the game(bounties and nerf rorqs) plus new content is being added often so i think the future looks better
---
Contrast this by CCP Leeloo then
---
&gt; The reasoning for his removal will of course remain confidential between CCP and Manfred, and we would like to thank him for his contributions during his term with CSM X.
---
And this by CCP Dopamine now
---
&gt; It is with great disappointment that I bring you the following news. Brisc Rubal has been found to be sharing confidential information with a member of his alliance that was later used by another alliance member to conduct illicit in-game transactions.
---
EULA ≠ NDA, there is a reason why Leeloo wrote that the way she did.
---
When I was ganking heavily we used t1 or t2 scanning frigates for this role.  Bumping was usually a Omen Navy or Stabber Fleet.  Bumping machariels are good, but the nomen ends up with a similar profile once you oversize the mwd.  Being less pricey is an added bonus when you have other fleets trying to gank your bumpers.
---
Banning from the game and claiming RL contract breach are 2 VERY different things...
---
Companies do stupid things every day. While NDA breaches are the fault of the person in question, the way CCP publish their allegations with no corroborating evidence is their problem. We are in the land of defamation right now.
---
Very good patches coming along for capitals and wardecks, abyssal space was a welcome sight for PvE, incoming implants, subcaps are seeing regular balance patches. Lot of things could still be improved and many issues can't really be fixed anymore but going pretty well. Depends maybe what you want to do.
---
Was waiting for this. Thank you!
---
New to the game but already complains on reddit ..
---
First of all we don't know that, but if you're correct, and for the sake of argument say you are, they should then have used the standard EULA violation and ban. 
---
EULA ≠ NDA, and there is a reason why Leeloo wrote that the way she did, something CCP lawyers then were well aware of, but seemingly are not aware of now. Therefore this will become a hot mess, even if you're completely correct in your assumptions.
---
they do business in the US and thus are subject to US legal proceedings.
---
Low effort. The 'Brisc' Damage Control mod is offline.
---
&gt; The only statement CCP has made was in regards to the breach of the EULA and NDA. 
---
That's why when employers are asked for references in America, they just give at most start and end dates. Statements in any negative light can be used as cause.
---
Terrible idea incoming, why not just use the siege/NSA comparison as a balancing point for fighters, hard nerf the speed of fighters and boost it while the NSA is active  
---
That way carriers have to commit like every other capital in the game
---
well, the only way to overcome an unfair advantage gained by a small group through breach of an NDA is to give that information to everyone.
---
Todd Howard!
---
i would say even if there was a lot of leaking nda stuff CSM is still a net positive to players as a whole
---
Well then, i am not passing that fatty over to you again, waste of perfectly good weed.
---
For me the CSM brings nothing, I get more engagement when I reach out to CCP employees than I do a member of the CSM, if I have an issue I want to bring up I seek out and approach the relevant developer who seems more willing to discuss my concerns as they are far more invested.
---
so, a perfect eve player...
---
If he is required to report an NDA breach because of his job, and the NDA breach claim turns out to be spurious, those potential reputational damages could fall on CCP.
---
nah its clearly a push to get eve back into the mainstream news, get  a bunch of new subs from the publicity and make themselves look good to papa abyss
---
CCP invited that by asking him to sign an IRL legal contract with them as a party. They are bound by contract law at that point as well.
---
No problem.
---
Sure. Becouse CCP usually do things like this just for fun. And they are wrong, cause who got the hammer runs to the public and say it is wrong. Always
---
they were probably using brisc as a head on a pike so that everyone knows CCP is serious about the NDA. if they just remove him without saying anything players wont get the message and will still continue to complain about large alliances stuffing csm with people who will send info back to alliance leaders.
---
Don't worry , Brisc's wife will continue playing.
---
Not as much as Snuffed Out loves them.
---
So because brisc says he didn't that must be true?
---
I find the article rather tasteless
---
&gt;he was goon, not goon
---
What?
---
Brisc's lawsuit is not going to ask to restore hime to the CSM or unban his characters.  Brisc's lawsuit is going to say that CCP could have banned him without publicly alleging that he violated the NDA, which amounts to slander/defamation, and CCP should pay him $BIGNUM for the damage to his reputation.
---
Considering that CCP's own policy is not to discuss bans, there's certainly grounds to make that argument.
---
Your reward has been transferred
---
Buy gold.
---
Unfortunately not. Like what Brisc is saying I absolutely deny any wrong doing.   
---
I have contacted CCP and asked to work with them to get to the bottom of whatever this is. If they do not do that then I will be done with Eve for good, which makes me sad.
---
a wannabe politician wanted to be space important. So he got elected to the wannabe important focus group of eve players. He gave the intel he got there to his friends so that they could benefit from it. Now he is banned
---
In Hungary there is an article about that on a newsportal [https://index.hu/mindekozben/poszt/2019/04/09/korrupcio\_miatt\_tiltottak\_ki\_egy\_lobbistakent\_dolgozo\_ferfit\_egy\_jatekbol/](https://index.hu/mindekozben/poszt/2019/04/09/korrupcio_miatt_tiltottak_ki_egy_lobbistakent_dolgozo_ferfit_egy_jatekbol/)
---
its an NDA aka not accessible by the public and thus holds no relevance for connecting a public person to an ingame character.
---
As if carriers aren't oppressive enough even with those changes.
---
If you don’t like it, vote next time, encourage others to vote
---
You clearly have no clue what you are talking about. I think you made about 4-5 mistakes in such a short statement.
---
&gt; If they do not do that then I will be done with Eve for good, which makes me sad.
---
Good. Cheaters shouldn't play.
---
The scum will find some new thing to exploit, but this does make wars a little less cancerous.
---
Yeah because 4 years is so long ago, surely customs, traditions and real life defamation laws have changed since then
---
POKE!
---
Gate camp. Ill try the bubble
---
EVE IS DEAD COMPARED TO TWO YEARS AGO!
---
He has no case. You guys can argue this until your fingers bleed, it won't change reality. If he files any sort of legal action against CCP in any US court, it will be immediately dismissed.
---
God Damnit TodAlWard i swear this is the last time its gonna work.
---
Sounds familiar lmao
---
lol retard.
---
If that is what you think he meant, well...  I think you are smarter than that.
---
Holy shit. You are either a lobbyist or have been taken in by the status quo. That is NOT how politics work. Lobbyist are paid by special interest groups to try and sway legislators to vote in their favor.  
---
If a politician needs to learn about something, they go to their advisors, and their advisors go to subject matter experts.
---
As far as I know in all cases where a CSM leaked information and got banned for it CCP never outright said "they leaked information and were banned for it". Same standards.
---
The large groups can already do this to the small groups, because they have the numbers
---
I congratulate the person that bent you over and, it would appear, reamed you into oblivion. 
---
Such hate.
---
&gt;Brisc Rubal was there, wearing nothing but a suit and tie just like the day he was born.
---
lmfao how do you come up with this shit, Naz?
---
Hungary News Cycle props!
---
hate lol?   
---
You break the rules, you take the punishment. Don't act like you're all innocent
---
&gt; For me the CSM brings nothing,
---
Your ignorance is not proof they do nothing. CCP would not keep them around if they did not think they were a positive benefit to the health of the game because maintaining it costs them money.
---
How do you think a career politician makes informed decisions about subjects he or she is not versed in?  
---
Who do you think those advisors talk to? Who do you think the subject matter experts are?  
---
Exactly, lobbyists.
---
Thanks. I needed that.
---
Just some elderly goon apologist. 
---
Banned now. No loss.
---
I'll try one later!
---
Welcome to Icelandic communism op, the company is named crowd control for a reason.
---
That is completely irrelevant in this case as the defamation suit would go before the Icelandic courts. Just last month a man living in South America won a lawsuit against a Icelandic journalist for writing an article connecting him to a drug cartel and dissapearance of an Icelandic citizen. This went through the courts here in Iceland.
---
Is he really a "public figure"?  Lobbyists operate in the shadows.  He isn't running for office or anything.  He's only a "public figure" in Eve.  Nobody else on the planet knows he even exists.  Regardless, he chose to become public to the Eve community, using his perceived status as "politician" (he's not a politician - politicians in the US stand for office, he's a lobbyist!).
---
But Noobman didn't even try to challenge it and did so publicly. If Brisc could make it seem like it was a personal attack by CCP by proving other members of the same CSM also broke the NDA - however well intentioned - by seeking out advice from experts in the game, he could try to sue for defamation which would probably get settled out of court.
---
Bot saying he should be able to or that I agree with his actions, merely that if CCP aren't watertight, acting against an attorney could get ugly.
---
Lol.  Oh please, enlighten me oh wise one /s
---
Again.  There are no territories in hi sec.  POCOs are shit and it does not really matter who owns them, literally no one cares.  
---
Wardec mechanics do, in fact, help the smaller groups, as those groups that would harass them can now actually be fought and hurt, instead of just getting blapped on an undock all day.
---
But sure, I have no clue lol.
---
Great, another patch to remove everyone from the game except for those in large coalitions that can also field rorquals and supers.
---
You trained  a whole year for Carrier, too bad, it's now a useless piece of junk, it can do nothing a Dread can't do.
---
It can't even farm now.
---
Only if you have a super and also in a large coalition. Everybody else is fucked.
---
Same goes with rorqual, a slight pinch to large coalition players, KO to everybody else.
---
Good job, CCP, keep destroying everything that's not a large coalitions and very old player.
---
That is demonstrably untrue (unless your referring to the impending climate crisis)
---
I heard something else... a strange spike in the value of the Corax.  Lots of rumours going about.
---
Star citizen is not comparable to eve really. Very different games
---
[Traffic](https://imgur.com/a/KeZMhZO)
---
No they won't. 
---
CCP can ban you for what ever they want, without reason.
---
I recall Lenny_Kravitz2 posting something similar about his integrity when he was banned. I had a look to see if I could find it but he's a prolific thedonald poster now so I quickly gave up.
---
where is the fun in that though?
---
I'm from Norway. I know the difference...
---
Ban whoever the snitches are
---
And we aint even salty about it😂
---
i thougt init was a proud indipendent alliance that does not need a goon
---
As far as I have understood it, Brisc always thought of himself as a representative in the CSM, who can collect ideas from others and bring in, instead of trying to figure out solutions by himself.
---
Unfortunately if you are bound to a NDA, that's not how it works, since for others to bring in their ideas, you will have to leak information or at least give an insight what are the current topics of the CSM.
---
Unironically upvoting a NazAlGhul post... WTF is going on with EVE 2019...

 Bye bye o/

---
Well you can start off by reading what I wrote which explains your questions.
---
Now, if lobbies are innocent and simply subject matter experts. Why would they not simply be called advisors. Their job is in their name. They are lobbying for special interest groups. Why are their laws about politicians becoming lobbyists for x amount of time?
---
Might I recomend a small group, called EBWF (F.U.N INC). I've not flown with them for awhile but they're an up and coming, now a good public fleet, more small gang stuff and less, fleet meta than Spectre-fleet. And always a Riot
---
Lobbies are just as much universally innocent as they are universally evil.  
---
If you think politics can operate without lobbies, you are in for quite the surprise.
---
god wouldnt that be a fun joke module for them to put in?    
---
something for the login rewards, officer mod 'Brisc' Modified Damage Control, as good as a Civillian Damage Control, but gives you a suspect flag aslong as you have it equipped your ship
---
oops, renaming my titan from "Eat at Giovanni's" to "PizzaIsLove".
---
Wow this post is still up. Talk about autism to the highest order.
---
It will be more like ADCU. Works for a few seconds, while you bullshit line members with political talk, until they realize tye truth
---
i don't mean you'll evade the ban, i mean that if they ban you for a year you'll be ready to go in 11 months
---
that actually makes me sad too. it's never a good day when a content creator leaves eve
---
i was just saying this to myself also.
---
it feels ustz is very busy. compared? are you also living in lowsex?
---
Well the corax is a t1 destroyer and easily made even by a low skill industrialist. There is just no point at all trying to fuck with t1 destroyer prices because their numbers can be swamped in an instant. Faction guns or other faction, t2 or t3 modules and ships are the only way to make any decent investment. If he shared Informationen then it was for multiple hundred billions at least
---
I think you're right about that, I mixed up the NPC Sotyos with the FOBs. 
---
Question still stands, however.
---
Eve is a drama game.  And we love that &lt;3
---
So... You didn't get an answer from them outside their worktime and/or in their resttime. So you come to reddit, and tell us that you didn't do it because you something in your real life. You didn't do it because you attended 95% of the meetings and calls. 
---
And you don't know why it is, but your alliance mates bans are a mistake, cause you didn't tell them anything. 
---
So translated: you exactly know why it is happened, you just want something what u can argue with in front of the public. Also you thought this is just a game, but you stepped a line, and now you realised that it can affect your real life.  
---
And you know why you got it, since there is even a devblog about it.
---
Tell me: if you sure that it is just a misstake, why you instantly put it in front of the public? And if you sure about it, why you didn't take legal steps, if it affect your real reputation?
---
That was amazing.
---
1) Citing the reasoning behind the removal of a person from the CSM - effectively an accusation with no opportunity for the accused to answer - opens up a can of worms, regardless of whether the accused was innocent or guilty. The example in the link above avoids that problem.
---
2) I believe it is, at the very least, polite and appropriate to acknowledge that I was not the one who found that link, and to give credit appropriately, regardless of the relevance or lack thereof of the source of the link.
---
I just really hope that there will be no backlash on CCP. If they fucked up and loose the upcoming lawsuit then it could have an immense effect on the future of the. CCP could well loose a lot of money here.
---
Wtf are you on about? Somebody just explained lobbying to you, and you go "nope, that's a regular advisor".
---
What the shit?
---
I like how you listed 'skull' twice.
---
Are we next, or are we considered already dead?

"In Hungary" trusted news source high profile ~click me~
---
Maritime law you say?  Does he also go by Cherith Cutestory?
---
Tbh you'r right but abyssal and trigs are cool. Yeah missions, incursions, lowsec, nullsec they desperately need attention but also i think CCP have a big plans, at last that's what i think after first world tour event, they say this year is mostly about upgrading tools for next gen, 64bit (they say maybe we will get HiRes textures, damn they even didnt abandon WiS).
---
But if You need really something new and refreshing then probably You need to look here in about next 2-3 years
---
You don’t even know who he lobbies for. Still just emotionally biased assumptions.
---
&gt; Also, this just in, if you disagree with one side you are automatically on the other side even if you don't think that.
---
Which would be true if we too were confined by binary political system and forced to align all aspect of out life with politics and that specific system. Which we aren't.

Sure satisfying when literally all normal carrier farmers will have to move to other income methids, diminishing the profits made from everything else, includin whatever you do for isk.

Satisfying will be your whining when you'll realise that.

I tried to suggest to him that the third book should be about low sec :D

Don't argue with this guy IRL hes a hot shot lawyer with a kick boxing gf and drives a locally built Mercedes
---
i find it hard to understand the mentality.
---
its not a challenge at this stage for keepstars and goons. its just time that slowly but surely more, and more and more and more get placed. to what end?
---
its nice to win, and be strong, i get that. but im shocked so many spineless people dont want to fight the cearbear goon lifestylers. its a pvp game you know?
---
2. &gt;&gt; maybe you were "bumping" the structure near your ship : your ship can't align properly and try to move around the object your are bumping but if this object is really nig (like a station) your ship bump the structure for a long time... pretty annoying and sometimes it can get you killed, in pvp or in pve
---
you don't need to see your ship exactly next to the structure on your display to "bump" this structure because some of them are (considered by the game) bigger than their visual shape and size.
---
it happen often on acceleration gates for example (you can try it to see how it works and how to avoid it)
---
hope it helps
---
Whats up with the Skyrim reference at the end?
---
I agree, something from Trump's twitter would be better
---
Lol. As a public figure your ethics are regulated.  That ended a long time ago in the US.
---
This is CCP we're talking about...
---
To be fair, most lobbyists are lawyers, especially when they're lobbying for law legislation.

There's really nothing wrong with being a lobbyist in general, as long as the persuasion isn't done with gifts and bribes. They serve a purpose to cough up and compress hard numbers and research so legislators/regulators can make good and enlightened decisions based on data available they cannot possibly work out themselves.
---
go to lowsec. its fun. nullsec are slowly destroying the game
---
''delve and goons etc will eventually do nothing but place multiple keepstars in every single system in nullsec.
---
and push through with titan, super. keepstar fleet setups
---
As someone from Central Russia, I felt I had to say something, but I have nothing to contribute except some comment on coincidences.
---
I almost forgot that most of people in this sub are neckbeards and male feminists.
---
Dude stop. You’re not allowed to say anything positive about brisc. Goes against the popular decision.  Down vote brigade is coming.
---
&gt; Sure satisfying when literally all normal carrier farmers will have to move to other income methids
---
Lol no

&gt; diminishing the profits made from everything else
---
I would rather trust Gacy with my children than the OP to keep anything secret.
---
paying for plex on accounts is super easyi, and MANY people can make 1bill per 8hours of gameplay with one toon without a rorqual.
---
They can be done in subcaps but it requires a lot of them.
---
huh
---
So, time to make "remindme 5years" posts?
---
I agree
---
Andrew Grown: "I'd love to write a book about lowsec. CCP, can you let me know who would be good to talk to?"
---
CCP: "What's Lowsec?"
---
You should learn law dude
---
You don't have a clue.
---
Why would 'experts' choose drastically different people? Consider this, the amount of the playerbase made up by goonswarm and affiliates dictates necessarily most game experts are likely going to be affiliated with goonswarm or other such entities. These mega alliances represent every plausible playstyle in the game and also house the lions share of the playerbase.
---
Your new group is going to be pretty similar to the old group if it was a fair representation of the playerbase. Who do you think your new group (which is going to be Goon affiliated) is going to vote in as new members?
---
Than there is the fact that you wan't less information shared with representatives under the guise that would be better for the game. That idea is ludicrous and saves maybe one incident every two years of some semi-successful speculation that makes 2 players in the entire game money? The Brisc incident doesn't effect me at all but a lack of insight or information on the part of representation sure could. CCP already is picky about what they share for harm reduction.
---
It seems shortsighted and unrealistic.
---
oldtown floods.....also its full of overpriced touristy shit.
---
This makes sense if the NDA was not violated.  If it indeed was, I can see how CCP needs to tell us that CSM members were removed.  That doesn't explain why the would tell us about shine it pando of course
---
the only exhibit needed in that case would be his video running for csm where he himself links his in-game name to his real life identity. Without that there would be no strikes against his character.
---
Some guy just got 20 years for swatting. Cause a game. You would think that why would somebody risk his freedome for a game. But he did.
---
OP is full of shit. I can’t see CCP banning him and making a public statement about it given his day job unless they were beyond certain.
---
Sucks. I liked Brisc. Seemed like he really gave a fuck about people playing all aspects of the game rather than just one little pocket or style.
---
How is that a threat? I'm literally saying what some crazy goon could do should CCP decide to give out his info, I guess in this world of snowflakes I need to make a footnote - I am in no way associated with GSF and that message was simply stating the possibility of a life threat to the whstleblower existing as a thing, not that I was planning to do something...
---
yet someone actually won EvE today
---
Oh if only Eve could finally die. It won't happen, but it's nice to dream.
---
If you truly did nothing wrong, this sounds like clear defamation considering the potential impact on your personal life. Food for thought.   
---
Though frankly, your profession and party affiliation make it hard to believe you truly did nothing wrong.
---
*shrug* I tend to be nice. Even tho one of Brisc’s last actions was to nuke my home system, he’s still a human being who has to feel like shit right now regardless of innocent or guilty.
---
I’m not actually certain that this would land in Icelandic courts. Fairly certain CCP still has a US address somewhere.
---
An mtu is a waste of time, multiple aint. Slap 4 of em in your vni, run 4 havens, grab 4 more, repeat until done krabbing. Grab a t1 indie, wreathe is my personal choice for speed+decent cargo, and empty em all at once.
---
Even with guristas loot being shitty as fuck it's still far better isk/h emptying those MTU's than the vni krabbing itself is. Other NPC factions that drop better loot make it insanely profitable.
---
As an added bonus you never miss any faction spawn loot. Especially a thing if you're multiboxing VNI's.

The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. You can get away with a lot. Let that brush dance around there and play. Zip. That easy.
---
This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.
---
Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. This is truly an almighty mountain.
---
You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just make a decision and let it go.
---
There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Don't fiddle with it all day. Brown is such a nice color.
---
You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. A happy cloud. Have fun with it. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.
---
Play with the angles. You can do it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. You can create anything that makes you happy. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.

inb4 ccp admits they got rused by fake leaks
---
You can still sub with isk, PLEX is quite pricey compared to what it used to be but the isk making activities in game are also more abundant. 
---
It is viable to play as alpha only however you will be locked into support ships for most alliance doctrines barring a few exceptions. 
---
Free to play hasn't really affected the game a huge amount apart from some rampant botting in highsec, which leads me into your next point of level 4 missions are now locked behind omega, but it has allowed more people to dip their toes in the eve waters. 
---
if you are looking for a Nullsec corp to help you getting back into the swing of things look no further than Dreddit, we are the bedrock corp of TEST Alliance, we are extremely active PVPers and provide good space, buy backs, subsidies and active mentoring for newbros (and probably old bros who are returning if you ask nicely) check out www.dredditisrecruiting.com or hit me up with a PM if you would like to know more.
---
CCP currently only has offices in Reykjavik, Shanghai and London now. They closed the Atlanta office which was the only one in the US. I doubt any attempts to force US law to apply to them will stick.
---
Well, how difficult it is or isn't to prove malice depends on where the defamation claim is filed. And in a case like this, with enough money, the world, as it were, is your oyster.
---
I heard from a reliable source he was involved in an incident in Dallas in 1963
---

---
CSM doesn't represent me or my interests, that's for damn sure.
---
So, yes, get rid of them. There are well-established ways to get user feedback that literally hundreds of other companies have managed to use successfully. Why can't CCP do something similar?
---
The story has it that he was one of the space suited people in the fake moon landing pictures from 1969
---
Manny wasn’t banned so if you want to draw parallels like that you logically should consider the hypothesis that he didn’t breach Eula and nda to the same extent. But in any case times change and things change. Ccp has been trying to be more transparent and that’s a way to be transparent and preserve the image of the csm. The damages in real life are only a consequence of his own choice of disclosing and using his real name.
---
&gt; Considering that CCP's own policy is not to discuss bans, there's certainly grounds to make that argument.
---
That’s totally irrelevant and not at all why CCP doesn’t discuss bans. CCP doesn’t discuss bans because there’s often no positive reason to, and any discussion of a ban involves providing means and methods at least in part to people who could and would use that info to reduce their risk of being caught and thus banned themselves.
---
If you get banned unjustly, you submit a ticket and hopefully someone looks into it and sees the mistake. Sometimes they might provide just enough information to you to get clarifying information.
---
Though given that this community always complains about CCP not banning enough people, it’s odd to hear so many people suggesting CCP is too hasty and thoughtless in banning people now.

---
Your crimes against the English language, unfortunately, won't be forgotten
---
i think skillinjection is a massive game ruiner.  people spend too long complaining ccp broke the game, rather than changing the meta and working around it.
---
eve online is a goon cearbear game nowadays
---
You used "I" 21 times. To put this into perspective you wrote roughly 21 actual sentences that were not simple lists separated by periods.
---
Should have read the Terms and Conditions better.
---
The sheer stupidity of claiming that being a lobbyist somehow enhances your credibility should be a bannable offense in itself.
---
In the EULA everybody accepted that everything within the game is the property of CCP. Even the names. And they can do anything with it. So yeah, they have the right to bann anybody without proof.
---
Did you learn this all in the night classes you took to get your GED?
---
What people don’t know is the pulse will cloak all ships in system rather than decloak
---
Fuck me i just spat my coffee. Take your updoot
---
It's literally illegal here, and our political system works just fine.
---
Perhaps you should look up the definition of defamation. Firstly, I'm fairly certain that defamation implies that the statements made were false (i.e. Brisc didn't leak anything and CCP is besmirching his good name). So there is your first burden of proof. 
---
Secondly, regarding real life, CCP makes no mention of his real name/real life position in their post announcing his punishment. That's done purely by Brisc himself and by other third parties. He made the choice to link his RL political career with his EVE life.
---
Providence has regular big fleets in EUTZ (around 18-19 Eve time). I dunno, look for corps that are mostly EU-based? I did that and have no problem finding people to play with.
---
I've seen some people being banned, sometimes very close acquaintances. All of them claimed innocence, all of them were screaming CCP were in error. Every. Single. One. was banned for good reasons and good riddance. Sure, mistakes happen but I don't think there's a shadow of a doubt in this case. CCP act when they have evidence that satisfies them and them alone, as this is ultimately their game and they are the ones best equipped to make such determinations. I don't think they'd take any chances in a high-profile case like this. Remember, this is not only Brisc banned. It's 2 more high-profile members of a high-profile alliance. No. They got what they deserved and I'm 100% sure of that.
---
CCP's headquarters are here, they pay taxes here so to me it seems reasonable he would be able to pursue a lawsuit here if he wanted it. I see two solutions for Brisc. The first one being the liability lawsuit which i'm almost certain he can not win in Iceland as he would have to prove damages to his character in a foreign state. Unless he gets out right fired that's going to be difficult at best and his best option there would be the US courts.   
---
The second one being to force CCP to release the "evidence" by going through the Icelandic courts. As he's not a national and doesn't live here liability is out of the question but they are accusing him of a liable offense which is breaching a NDA. They are in all intents and purposes not alleging but stating he broke the law and if faced in court, CCP would be required to back that up. If he wins or loses the lawsuit can be totally irrelevant if he just wants to clear his name.
---
They banned him for violating the NDA and you’re thinking that nobody bothered to bring it up to the lawyers?
---
C’mon man. Think about what you’re suggesting there and you’ll figure it out. Also suggesting that the post on the blog could be interpreted as libelous is a long stretch. Nothing in the post was remotely construable as malice.
---
because the op. like me, paid the higher price for insurance. meaning now the payout means im basicly breaking even. a little unfair?
---
i also support reduction, or hopfully complete removal of insurance on capitals. (caps only dont nerf battleships more)
---
and make insurance purchase on supers like 10bill to get 15back. a real risk or investment.
---
but either give me my insurance payMENT back and let me re insure, or let me get the same amount i was told i would get when i bought the insurance
---
It's either that safety or so risky it doesn't make a profit.
---
And no, you won't have anyone's stuff, keep dreaming.
---
I'll be waiting to see you cry like a bitch that whatever you do for isk is not working, like I explained you earlier will happen.
---
Maybe more people are cashing-out their Plex holdings after reading the release notes for today's extra-shitty patch.
---
&gt; CCP would need to have intent to ruin his reputation, aka, malice.
---
which in discovery would be enough to find a single mail where CCP employee calls him something
---
Does your IP address lead to a militia compund in West Texas?
---
he can come out publicly and say he didn’t do it, ccp is not preventing him from defending himself. We don’t know the nda but it’s more than likely clauses saying that ccp can do a lot of things in order to protect its IP and Confidential information, this included
---
There's still a lot of lobbying going on.
---
Yeah sorry, your capital ship wen tfrom perfectly aligned safety to "I now have to like, watch intel channel", how fucking terrible.
---
did goons agree to this when things didnt go thier way or play to thier palms?
---
That's all true, but had he not publicly linked his in-game persona with his real life identity in his video announcing that he was running for CSM there would be no ties between the two. He has no one to blame but himself.
---
You have the "krabs are needed for the game" mentality, it's so much fun.
---
Very cool and very legal!
---
And it helped turn DUST into the powerhouse it is today.
---
The guy just didn't know the rules of the CSM.
---
You don't exploit NDA'd info until your 2nd term.
---
I do hope they publish a larger report at a later date... if only so we can have the details.
---
Have you heard about our god and savior, Noctua? May beige be with you!
---
The sort of hidden part to that is "Go out of your way to pick goon enemies to fill this group"
---
The second he broke that NDA - he fucked up. The rest doesn't really matter from his perspective. It matters from the perspective of the other 2 guys but hey, at least they only got 1 year bans... I kind of hope they try to avoid the ban and get caught though :).
---
That does not absolve him of wrongdoing. Loose lips sink ships (and sometimes FCs).
---
/r/woooosh
---
It’s called art
---
This kind of news could have real life implications on his career. This will be interesting.
---
Well CCP did nothing wrong here ... they released a statement that brisc is banned and no longer CSM and thats pretty much it.
---
Everything else what happened after that is a result of who he is in RL and nobody but he himself started telling everyone that he's a politician in RL with his first video.
---
So when CCP said he got banned and removed from CSM, they said his EVE name and thats it. They didn't release any real name or anything that would lead to who he really is. The fact that everyone knows who he is, is because of himself. And the drama that results out of it, is because reddit comments upping to 1000+ in one threat plus a couple online gaming news sites saying "hey look that RL politician broke the NDA between him and CCP and got punished for it with ban and removal of CSM" ...
---
So there could be no backlash on CCP, as they can easily prove, that it's not their fault that this might have an affect on his RL now.
---
Collusion delusion. Ridiculous bullshit.
---
EVERYTHING a company does that's customer facing is marketing.
---
Honestly I'm hoping this ends his political career, probably too much to hope for tho...
---
This is exceedingly naive. CCP has a LONG history of brutal arrogance and self destruction, saved ONLY by an exceedinly loyal customer base.
---
There is always a lot of freighter sized hauling contracts.  It can be good isk for the work involved.  
---
Jf contracts also pay pretty well, and can get your adrenalin pumping.
---
Just a bit of fun
---
Give some time to the Triglavians to learn about AFK VNIs. They'll jump on the bandwagon.
---
Come to Provi
---
I’m here, not ready to believe that a professional lawyer, an actual lobbyist, would be out of his depth understanding the nuances of an NDI as a contractual obligation. That simply can’t be too high of a hurdle to clear for him.
---
I regret not knowing who he was until now.   I feel I've missed an opportunity to blow up his spaceships...   repeatedly...
---
Actually, I'm sure a case can be made for damaging the real-world reputation of this guy if this turns out to be a mistake on CCP's part.
---
I'm saying without evidence either way, and knowing the history of CCP being utterly incompetent I'm not ready to assume he's guilty just yet.
---
&gt; CCP's headquarters are here, they pay taxes here so to me it seems reasonable he would be able to pursue a lawsuit here if he wanted it. 
---
By here you mean Iceland? Sure yes he *could* but I meant he didn’t have to. If they have an actual footprint in the US then he could likely find a US court with jurisdiction.
---
Also, I don’t think either of the two options you’re suggesting are what’s going to happen. Brisc officially doesn’t give a shit about us players, CCP, or what happens or happened in game right now. What he cares about is the fact that if you google Brisc Rubal it’s pages full of PCGamer clickbait that have zero info on them but are flooding the airwaves with his name. 
---
Brisc knows what he did and why he got caught, it’s just easier to play dumb and villainous CCP. Any suit he brings will be mostly meritless and only intended on getting CCP to consider an action to limit what they say further on it. Brisc doesn’t want what he did public. Even if the proof CCP has is questionable he definitely doesn’t want that public, because even questionable proof then adds much more validity to the claim. Likely he’s talking a big game about how they told him nothing but why would he want them to say anything? It’s a terrible idea for him.
---
because fighters/drones arent used enough already...
---
Innocent or guilty his best bet was to keep this quiet until he'd fought it, now his name gets dragged through the mud until it's resolved and CCP takes a bit of flak for a 6 months before everyone forgets and moves on.
---
Innocent or guilty this signal blasting is only going to hurt his rep more.
---
Hehe boiii
---
except that PLEX is useful.
---
For DPS, Nightmare or Vindicator with T2 guns and lots of DED fittings.
---
For shield Logi, Basilisk or Scimitar with Logi 5 and T2 reps.
---
Both also require a full set of implants.
---
You can probably get away with cheaper ships if you stick to Vanguards.
---
Good catch. Editing...
---
Don´t know why you get downvoted for this. You´re pretty much spot on.

Kidding, right? For the money they get i would sell whole my family to slavery.

Right? Everyone who's been around for a ban or two knows this...
---
Speaking from cal/galmil lowsec area, AU right through EU is pretty busy

---
do some research on the topic to further elevate your own knowledge to a new degree, or don't, either way its one's choice to be ignorant
---
Well, we are past the gaming news sites :)
---
This is their property. They make the rules. The rules are they don't have to tell us anything. We agree to the rules when we accept the TOS. Welcome to the internet.
---
Brisc just thinks he's special obviously. Why else would anyone link their real life to Eve?
---
If you abstract from the current incident you are saying you are able to determine that he has done it becouse he was accused and he denied it. According to this logic if you are allegedly did something you commited that crime regardless you did it or not, which is like feminist lvl logic and thats not that high. 
---
Yeah it seems he is not innocent but i am sure that's not the logic you should follow to find it out.
---
I often go to parts of TEST, where there are many scripts, very many, very many. What do you do with these robots?
---
Aw, I thought it was fitting.
---
I know :) found already some non pcgamer news sites that released a short article about it.
---
Don't go retriever then, go with a good tanked Procurer that get expensive to gank. AFK mining with a expensive paper thin thing shit gonna get you rekt, HS, LS, NS or whatever.

Sorry but the moment when someone is posting his face on some dumb shit and this relates to game - it is doxxing.
---
Because it’s easier to go “nyeeeh I don’t like your opinion” then to actually respond to it, I reckon “grrrr goons” is also apart of it
---
Being on CSM not makes you public person.        
---
Yes you can use someone ingame image but not RL one.
---
There’s just as much evidence proving them guilty as there is evidence of innocence.. by that I mean, there is no evidence atm.
---
No one knows what happened, so no one really has the stones to throw. It’s all speculation, so yea, considering that you have no evidence and decided to lash out.. I’d assume that your comments are fueled by hate.
---
 "Aryth was the darkness that the light could not banish. "  
---
Accurate.
---
&gt; Separate your ingame agenda from someone's RL.
---
He was banned for breaking an RL NDA and leaking information from the CSM which is the one thing every CSM haters are waiting to whine about the CSM despite very good effort by CSM members to provide the best that can be done with the institution.
---
That's neither IG agenda or "someone's private RL" you fucktwats.
---
He posted his face and made all the connections himself.
---
Lol. Acting like this is a fucking trial
---
 Releasing personal information or connecting any Reddit account or eve account to a real identity will lead to a permanent ban. **Same goes for posting personal images** 
---
So he should be banned cause he did it himself for his CSM campaign ?
---
Wrong, normal Carriers are useless now for farming and almost useless for pvp.
---
Say what you want but when you will be whining that yourbisk making method became overcrowded/low income, I will remember you how you were cheering on the changes that brought it to that state.
---
Or when your subcap gang will no longer be dropped by carriers that had alteady bad application but instead by subcap gangs that you won't even be able to run from.
---
Sure, crabs are not needed for the game to work but you can't really handle them moving to other income methods either because i  this game, their supply and/oor demand is already limited.
---
Not saying you´re wrong form a moral perspective but isn´t there a difference in that regard between personal images and publically published material?
---
I agree with you 100% and personally i think it's more likely he's guilty. I'm just giving a possibility under the assumption that he is in fact telling the truth.
---
You have no idea how this works, don't you.
---
but people should love a gon speaking out about the health of the game because in a grr gons mind you guys are a main contributor to its degradation (besides CCP ofc). grr gon btw.
---
Rorqual nerf.
---
VNI nerf.
---
Gila nerf.
---
Carrier nerf.
---
Worst. Patch. Ever.
---
&gt; Or when your subcap gang will no longer be dropped by carriers that had alteady bad application but instead by subcap gangs that you won't even be able to run from.
---
LOL everyone would trade carriers with subcaps. That's why everyone is going to Horde or Brave space, so that they can fight subcaps they can fight and kite around.
---
Stop hoarding reddit karma
---
I think you're going to have a tough time demonstrating an expectancy of privacy in this specific example. There doesn't seem to be any grounds there. However, I would agree it's rather indecent, indignant and downright dastardly the treatment given. Which is the same treatment anyone else seems to get in this subreddit. Status quo as it were.
---
Well tbh not my call - but abusing someone "face" by some teenager with paint skills due to pixel game should not be allowed.       
---
"The ball" is now on the moderator team of this subreddit.     
---
For me it is hard to judge - like for many other people, mostly due to fact that you have people from around the world.        
---
There are countries - that forbid this kind of thing , while at the same that allow.
---
Still it don't give right for other people to abuse his RL image.      
---
They can use ingame image - to be "within rules"
---
If I got kicked from the CSM would that make the entire thing about carpentry? And yes it is politics, Eve politics. And yes American politics are meaningless, it's just a whole bunch of ignorant people who don't understand that agency is
---
As if PL and their “let’s go kill a bunch of alliances for shits and giggles” is any better for the game, almost everything goons has done served a direct objective with a specific goal, NCPL literally have killed alliances because why the fuck not? Also folks are naive if they think goons are behind the games degradation (literally all problems in the game would still exist with or without goons)
---
Strictly speaking he is in a public facing job, has put himself within the public eye and has no reasonable expectation to privacy (legally speaking), and therefore using a picture of him is well within the public domain and fair use.
---
Doesn't make it less shitty, but its not doxxing.
---
found 13yo        
---
&gt; "fucktwat"
---
This is not doxxing. In order fot it tp be doxxing thd information shared would have to be reasonably considered private. Users using images he used during his election campaign for CSM is in no eay doxxing. Think things through bud.
---
why do u even put effort into posts if ur gonna post under olmeca?

It should be noted that doxxing isn't voluntarily tying yourself to your real identity on a platform of your choosing.
---
I'm not defending anyone, just saying that Brisc's response telegraphs a stereotypical legal strategy.  The 'defamation' reaction is another of the 'no positive reason' to discuss bans.  It's also one of the main reasons companies don't publicly discuss personnel actions, if one were to consider CSM membership in the realm of human resources.
---
In my state, an employer can fire you for no reason at all.  If they tell you they're firing you because you got pregnant, then you will certainly win a lawsuit.  Likewise, CCP could have kicked and banned Brisc without any public explanation, but by making a public statement - especially if that disclosure violates their own written policies, they allow an opening to (what I imagine is) the inevitable lawsuit.
---
it's not doxxing but its pretty shitty
---
Thanks for the encouragement.
---
You wouldn't love their game if they did. Because it wouldn't let you murder and scam anyone you wanted.
---
Just let successful attackers have the 20% or whatever is was instead of it disappearing into the void imo.
---
There’s just no positive outcome I can see for him having any of the “evidence” out in public. It’d be a colossally stupid move on his part even if the evidence is 50/50. CCP wouldn’t have banned him on 50/50 evidence though.
---
Ok like i stated - depending on the respective country law it can or cannot be doxxing.          
---
Yet the rules of this subreddit forbid using someone personal images :           
---
&gt;**Same goes for posting personal images**        
---
So if not considered doxxing it is against this subreddit rules.
---
Maybe he should sue them instead then?
---
I was thinking about this. It makes sense they would have their own drones.
---
You remember the stock market crash in 2008?
---
I wouldn't say, he broke his NDA with THEM and told his buddies in advance the crash was coming because it was all planned. But he did.
---
He and his buddies made literal BILLIONS of dollars. 
---
Look it up, it's well documented by [some article in which a half sentence could be interpreted in a weird way when you pull it out of context]. 
---
Also he will deny that he was involved in 9/11 but we all know the truth!
---
i get that you black out stuff if youre streaming or important chats in general... but this is a bit to much imo. maybe stack them so you only have to black out a small portion of the screen or just dont hide them if there isnt any sensible stuff shown.
---
apart from that, nice vid! i liked comms (even if i cant understand them at all) and the translation!
---
Yet you made no shitpost when we were having fun at Falcon's expense. Pretty sure no one here asked him before posting ;)
---
Agree with StainGuy for once. Brisc Rubal, the character, might deserve a ban but using his real life image like this is a little disappointing and tasteless.
---
It's exactly the same, stating truth is not illegal, but making a defamatory statement about someone they had a contract with obligates them to either put out evidence backing it up or retract the statement.
---
I'm not sure why this is confusing.
---
This is why you don't tie real life in with EvE. He opened himself up to this shitshow.
---
A lawsuit does nothing if you are the cause of your own issues. The best he could hope for would be some kind of stfu-and-gtfo hush money settlement. if it goes that route you can bet he will never play eve again, his two friends might not either.
---
CCP better have a tight case here. Going public about breaking a NDA is a serious charge. Especially so when directed at an attorney.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
I was thinking more their handling of the whole micro-transaction store release and how they approach nerfs with a sledge hammer mentality, what you mentioned is just how the game works.
---
God forbid you receive a ban and your picture is available to this subreddit, friend.  All the memes that will be posted forever maiming your likeness. Personally, I will relish the impact you feel tenfold in that moment. 
---
Come on, really?
---
It's rumored that he's one of the few people alive who knows the whereabouts of Elvis Presley
---
Gonna disagree with you slightly on this. 
---
He's already linked himself IRL to his in-game moniker. That's his prerogative to do so. The problem is that CCP has **PUBLICLY** stated that he **broke an NDA** and as a result he's banned. 
---
This falls into libel territory because, according to Brisc, he's done nothing wrong and CCP will not (or has yet to) supply him with any proof that he's violated the NDA. CCP is also not a news outlet so (in the US) they're not granted the same allowances when it comes to possible libel suits of public figures.
---
IRL Brisc is a Lawyer (has passed the Bar and is part of the association) and has to self-report the fact that he's accused of violating an NDA. This can have real-life ramifications so if Brisc is innocent as he professes to be then he must sue for his personal well-being. 
---
If CCP had just publicly stated something like "Brisc and friends are banned for reasons internal to the CCP and the CSM" then there'd be no leg for Brisc to stand on for a libel suit (or it'd be much harder to prove). Then if CCP privately informs Brisc that he's been banned for NDA violation he still has to report this to is Bar Association and has to follow other, more difficult, avenues to restore his credibility in the eyes of the Bar Association.
---
Perhaps. But they never talk about individual bans. There's never been a ban that CCP has "explained" the reasoning behind.
---
Don't need malice - he's not a public figure despite his use of that phrase to describe himself
---
&gt;God forbid you receive a ban and your picture is available to this subreddit, friend. All the memes that will be posted forever maiming your likeness. Personally, I will relish the impact you feel tenfold in that moment.
---
I've not released my picture on Reddit, or this subreddit. Therefore to use it as you suggested would be doxxing.
---
If I tied my EVE + Reddit account to my real life identity explicitly on this platform then have it.
---
It's not a difficult distinction to make.
---
So really no difference then.
---
Also Wizards, Harry. You mustn't forget the wizards.
---
Ok so i just added a link to official reddit rules.     
---
Even if this don't relates to doxxing , reddit strictly forbids stuff that currently is happening on /r/eve                  
---
Again i have noting against people using ingame image - but moment all those 13yo are staring abusing paint skills with Brisc RL image - even if they are not doxxing - they are going against the reddit rules.
---
YOu might have missunderstood me there. Yes I am totally thinking you should get what you paid for and not fall under the new insurance policy all of a sudden. What I mean is to rework insurnce as a whole but active insurance should stay the same until it runs out or the ship gets destroyed.
---
*sigh*
---
Yeah, you probably do. Because he is in this context a public figure and thus why they published anything in the first place. Not really that hard to see.
---
The ship actually looks pretty clear to me and the rest of the station has a pretty good now.
---
Can you keep sex away from hookers?
---
"Until then, Don't Panic" implying Panic may politely resume during and after the alliance update.
---
You're right, please make sure you never do, either. We'd love to slap national or community embarrassment on it in low effort shitposting to make sure it floats around online forever with your likeness. No worries though, our tasteless behavior will be protected by this ridiculous precedent.
---
now THIS is SPODBRAIN on a whole new level
---
&gt; But don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or upvote obvious vigilantism.
---
I'll discuss further with the moderator team. I'd also like to point out that if Brisc himself contacted us asking for posts related to the use of his tied image then we'd act on that.
---
I'd also like to invite you to recall the CCP Falcon meme that went around a few weeks ago. By the same ruleset those posts could have been regarded as harassing.
---
Situations such as these are not clear cut.
---
I was yearning for a good old downvote  today thanks buddy!

CCP Really doesn’t want us undocking huh... Only thing missing is the exotic dancers, but I’m expecting that in future updates :)
---
TAPI?

There's a known issue that hangars are too dark if you're using DX9.  Switching to DX11 in the launcher should resolve this, if your system will support it.

Why does everyone keep bringing up texas? Did CCP recently move their HQ to austin or something?
---
I guess you'd better call saul

Ah, that could be it! Thanks!

Cluster Fuck Coalition, old name before we were forced to be branded as Imperium.

That is every lawyer. Law School weeds out the scrubs who don't fit that bill.
---
Will receive enough salt from you after you realize what I say is true.
---
Seemed really dark when I first logged in, but I got used to it after a few minutes.  
---
The lighting looks hella nice as well.
---
Except a simple removal request to subreddit moderators would have the images removed, and a right to be forgotten request to search engines would remove existing traces of it.
---
There is a very clear precedent. We actively removing and ban people that dox with a zero tolerance policy. Myself and others have been doxxed (properly) in the past by some severely damaged people.
---
* Any personal information linked beyond the tied platform is removed
---
* Any requests made by a user to remove content that could be tied to a person/user, result in the content being removed.
---
* Accounts involved are banned and reported to Reddit
---
I can assure you right now that despite you being a massive ass and hypocritically saying that you'd love to contribute in something that you condemn, if you modmailed and requested something related to you be removed, we'd remove it. If someone posted something related to you beyond the platform, it would be removed.
---
oh dang, more sp? i better get my butt over there to make more new alts right now!
---
I think the point you need to drill through the thickest of skull you have is why it is even necessary for Brisc to have to ask for a picture of him being called a national embarrassment is even worthy of this subreddit. I'm not trying to harass you, the standard you're asking our community to live with is unacceptably toxic.
---
Interesting to know, thanks!
---
Ya well in the USA it is hard to tell the difference
---
CSM is a great bridge of information between CCP and player base. The problem is that the selection method is based on popular vote and that system is broken as empires with huge player base will vote significantly more then let's say low sec or wh ppl. and that is the broken thing here. Selection should be done differently.
---
I would give you gold
---
**DON'T PANIC**, DO NOT LOSE YOUR HEADS. It is business as always. I get it.
---
&gt; Situations such as these are not clear cut.
---
I guess it is time for it.
---
Are you active in every forum where images of politicians, celebrities and public figures are used as memes, or just this one?
---
I would think his eve days are done regardless of winning or losing. If he loses they would obviously up hold the ban and if he wins they could simply revoke his access to the game under the EULA that says they can suspend your access to the game at any time for any reason. Either way after an event like this I don't see them letting someone they accused of breaching the NDA back in.
---
I have no idea how my reproductive fluids got on that llama!

Yessss, a shitpost from the master

If you're selling votes let me know fam
---
does 2% damage give you 5000 dps?
---
FC, panicking, what do?
---
There is more in this game beside f1 content. To me, it doesnt matter if i pvp in a rifter or a carrier.
---
I usually fly 150mil-400mil ships in standing fleets, by the time I lose it, my afk VNI character has made the money to buy a new one. I don’t see a problem here, plus Carrier ratting seems too mind numbing for me, I’m fine. If I wanted to make a lot of money in a short period of time actively, I would just do exploring..
---
Do you have any idea how much making sure CCP does before banning obvious botters? This is a large factor on why it takes so long for bots to get banned.
---
Now imagine a far bigger incident, namely, this one. I am 100% sure that CCP has extensively checked and made **completely** sure that they're in the right here. Because of that, I am convinced that Rubal broke the NDA.
---
shouldn't the init icon be on the face of the two marines accused of the red alert?
---
fuck off
---
my pentium 4 and gtx 460 cant handle that
---
Take to the sea!
---
Just to point out, CCP have a history of taking action against players using vague or unsubstantiated evidence so I wouldn't be so sure that they got this right.
---
A rusty dull one, please. I like it when they scream. :D
---
I mean CCP where sure enough not to just ban Brisc, but two other affiliates too. On the TIS stream, when Brisc was told about the other people banned, he says: "Oh that makes sense now" but quickly clams up and goes back to "I didn't do it". You think CCP would just ban a high-profile CSM member willy nilly without any investigation? What would they gain? Obviously there was significant evidence.
---
Before you say: "I want evidence tho" CCP has never released info about NDA bans, because they have no obligation to say, and if they did, they would leak info they didn't want leaked.
---
shines is pretty adamant he won't. pando doesn't reddit much or i suspect he'd be doing the same. we'll see
---
This game caught my attention when i first found out about it a while back, seemed rather interesting and it seemed a little in-depth close to Eve level.
---
Any idea how active the player base is, I might get it to play a little while trying not to get burned out from Eve.
---

EBR-174351 was submitted from SiSi last week for this issue. EBR-174501 was submitted from TQ today.

I was flying directly away from it for about 2 or 3 minutes with the nose of my ship dipping left and right like a fish trying to get off a line. I might have been bumping it at first, but that wasn't what was keeping me out of warp.

Horde is doing good, almost the most active in their coalition and fighting fights on a regular basis except now they also have capitals and supers.

Horde, Brand Newbros, Brave Newbies or Karmafleet for your newbie Null needs.  
---
Game is in a little bit of flux at the moment, some hostilities across the map are kicking off and a big balance patch landed today.
---
I think it also slightly nerfs booshing and stealing excavators, you will have to bring a blockade runner to scoop instead of scooping with the CD.
---
I know you are probably mentally handicapped but in the past people didn't rat in carriers and the game was just fine. I know, shocker.
---
So quit. Noone cares lol.
---
Were not allowed to encourage self harm in this subreddit. That being said, your posting is shit.
---
&gt;If you're not with me, you're against me
---
Yep, good old 'Merican politics
---
But we have turtles in Space!
---
How's the quote go?
---
EVE is a collaborative science fiction drama with a space ship side game.
---
EVE's out of game fan base is humongous. Everyone likes reading watching the big battle videos and hearing the spin up stories. Everyone likes to read the posting, the out-of-game narratives, and the side blogs.
---
To the non EVE player, the actual loss of space ships and in-game currency is almost trivial to the w hole laser beaming, big explosion spectacle.
---
I normally agree with most shit you post, however in this instance you are wrong.
---
It is not nice, the media are cucks &amp; the so called amazing eve community can be the biggest douche canoes, but he used his RL image for a virtual game to elevate himself to a public figure.. Very shortsighted for an intelligent guy IMO but that is just hindsight.
---
I actually hate the fact that CCP did this in such a public way. It could have been done back room without the drama, but the game is tanking hardcore atm in numbers so the inner septic of me says, this is a media stunt for publicity...
---
Lol if only. That would be hilarious if nothing else. 
---
I checked a t1 HAW Naglfar primarily and was getting about 2500 DPS before patch and about 2300 now with faction EMP.
---
Ok let me ask you something.          
---
**What would you do if on a game related subreddit some people started to go after other player real life in a very negative way? Using this player real life pictures and even more details that relate to stuff he do**         
---
Like we are gaming subreddit and other people RL stuff should be no concern here.
---
Wait what?
---
Step 1: Take the nsa off and throw it in the garbage where they will all inevitably go in the comming days,
---
Step 2: install another Fighter support unit
---
Step 3:  fit sentient sebos with scan res script and sentient sigamps. 
---
Step 4: Warp to anomaly. 
---
Step 5: align out to your favorite fortizar or pos
---
Step 6: Target frigs and cruisers and one battleship
---
Step 7: kill one battleship until small ships are locked. 
---
Step 8: kill off the small ships
---
Step 9: repeat steps 6 through 9 to continue carrier ratting while remaining completely invulnerable to gankers
---
Beware the old blood.
---
The bog's made the call.
---
Fighter weapons have a hybrid of missile and gun mechanics with explosion radius/velocity and optimal/falloff range.
---
What flames?
---
TIL that this subreddit is a shining beacon of goodposting.
---
That's legit, they were starting to kind of test drive that program when I was playing but more under management of the big boys. Thanks for the Intel
---
thats a lot of words for some retard who doesnt have a fucking clue what hes talking about
---
Well put
---
siege module give 2% bonus to HAW damage instead of 2x
---
No, that was me. Brisc was actually behind the camera.
---
Yea honestly the politics looked like they were ramping up and that's what made me want to come back. I remembered when the big war stuff was going down there was plenty of entertainment in inside and outside of the game.
---
lol no.
---
If this was a PL or NC guy you would be one of the guys screaming for harder punishment. 
---
He was the one linking his real life identity to the game, its his own mess. 
---
Fuck off with your bad posting
---
I'm sorry, but I cannot agree and don't think you have offered much of a case to support your claim. They should, at a minimum, lobby to the people who a political figure represents. Convince them of the merits so that they will vote for representatives that support your cause. Don't tell my representative what I want them to do. And don't pay them to support something they otherwise wouldn't.
---
didnt ppl report this on sisi for like 2 weeks lmfao
---
The game is not in a position to make this change without a big negative consequence, retard.
---
Don't ask him to think about what he does himself, he can't think that far
---
ccp should hire Muller
---
It does when your CSM campaign was all about you as a RL life person.
---
No national tv? I'm disappointed.

God fucking dammit

RIP HAW phoenix

T2 HAW Nag has about 2800dps instead of 3600dps
---
Yep, typical amirite?
---
Myrm is OP in solo.... hou cant buff it

Wow, okay, that's bigger than I thought. F
---
Cheers for both replies, I'll have a look at EBWF
---
I've been following the Vic Mignogna case against Funimation and this is pretty close to the same thing that is going on over there as well though that whole thing has turned into a giant shit show.
---
&gt;Secondly, regarding real life, CCP makes no mention of his real name/real life position in their post announcing his punishment. That's done purely by Brisc himself and by other third parties. He made the choice to link his RL political career with his EVE life. Every other CSM that has gotten the boot has been named by their in game identity, the linking of the two is not a fault of CCP but Brisc himself.
---
People keep saying this but why would that matter? Imagine I take out dozens of ads claiming that h3h3 or pewdiepie are child molestors. Do you think I could get away with "lol I didn't use their real name"?
---
If CCP fucked up, I hope he sues them into oblivion for it collapsing the company and everyone involved in manufacturing it.
---
I’m curious how they intend to prove he did the things they are alleging.
---
Nice watch, thx for upload.
---
I'd like to applaud the CCP quality control people for making sure they didn't miss any huge, glaring issues with the latest patch prior to pushing it live on TQ. Fantastic work as always folks.
---
I don't think this ends the game for anyone. The fact that all their favorite devs might have been shitcanned or forced to find work elsewhere over the years making CCP less and less of a family and more just a feeling-less business is probably the main culprit. 
---
A few anom nerfs and you can still chain lower end anomalies - a few more and you start to think maybe it isn't a good use of your time. It wasn't a good use of time at it's peak, you were just disillusioned. But now you can find yourself willingly believing it's a waste of your day to farm space pennies on Eve.
---
Mining nerfs? You could continue to log in your `10 rorquals (or 2) and play whilst being constantly reminded you're wasting your time - or you could just extract and sell that SP, drones and ship to net several hundred hours worth of isk and save yourself the trouble this year.
---
When you cut down to the minimum and keep just a couple accounts active and extract the sp you don't need each month you can sell the spare assets at $4 a billion. Get value out of your time spent in game, your due and put that into the next game/entertainment/life experience.
---
Economy changes in themselves don't end things for eve players, but it can be the straw that breaks the camels back. The OP represents a very real issue which is the idea that it's not worth grinding isk. Whether it actually is would be of little consequence so long as enough people feel it's not worth their time over another game. You still have access to the vast majority of EVE content by putting your accounts on maintenance mode, extracting spare SP and getting rid of the fluff assets.
---
If CCP has evidence to support the ban they should publish it. It doesn't matter if you like Brisc or not look at the bigger picture. If CCP can ban player but not provide evidence or a chance to defend yourself it could happen to any of us. We all have the right face our accusers.
---
As someone who made one of these (admittedly) low-effort shitposts, the image I used is from the PC Gamer article. It's not like I am using a family picture, nor am I the one who linked his IG and RL personas.
---
That said, if the mods decide that this is unacceptable, I will gladly remove my terrible shitpost.
---
If this was brought to CCP by some CSM members, then i bet CCP did some investigation so.. i don't know, seems bad.
---
You have a strong hate boner
---
The health of the game is relative to how profitable it is. Not how you subjectively perceive the quality of it's gameplay.
---
Not worth it, 35 mil ticks were bad anyway.
---
Already had to full-tank and put cyno on my carrier due to cloaky campers.
---
I guess I together with many others will overcrowd the isk making methods of the very players that complained their way to tjis nerf. Serves them right, those methods are so much less risk and more reward anyway.
---
[It all makes sense now](https://imgur.com/a/Aq5xlcp)
---
Fuck I cannot not upvote FPS Doug.
---
I have been carrier ratting without an nsa for a couple weeks and it works just fine 50-60 Mil ticks easily with Ishtars on alts ask ratting doing 16-20 Mil ticks each. This guy is salty because he's too lazy to adapt which is fine these are the idiots who will die with their nsa fitted.
---
"What format is this number supposed to be in the database?"
---
"Just throw a 2 in there it'll be fine."

for people cheating in eve? yeah. Botters, RMTers, people using intel for their own profit. Its all the same shit tier of people.
---
Hah sure thing bud!
---
Now we have a nerd to all caps
---
Well the 2% increase in HAW damage vs. 2x increase seems to have counter-argumented me...
---
The patch is now live btw with that exact bug
---
aaaaaand it's live

Is this really, did CCP really fuck up that much?

damn I forgot about FPS doug

So you're just stupid then, I see. Literally what the guy above said. Actually you're in less danger than with the NSA now as three sebos won't use as much cap as the NSA cycling more or less all the time, depending on when you clear waves. Now you're always abouve jump cap ;););)
---
I have absolutely no love for lobbyist, but I also don't like seeing gaming companies take extremely harsh action with zero transparency. Mistakes happen and in the current environment when people are getting banned from various platforms based solely on their political affiliation... I'm not super comfortable with a political figure getting banned for... " trust us, he did it.". I understand video game companies cannot be very transparent when it comes to people who hack/glitch/exploit a game because it only makes them harder to detect in the future. But evidence that someone violated an NDA doesn't seem to warrant the same level of discretion. If they have hard evidence and he is asking for it... Burn him to the ground. If your evidence isn't strong enough to burn him, maybe it doesn't justify the ban, especially not this extremely public ban. I mean... When I logged on today the launcher had it front and center.... I have never had a game tell me when I logged in that a specific player had been banned. Not to mention the news article I saw about it yesterday.
---
Real talk, stop playing eve in high sec.
---
So basically, if you arnt Goons, dont join CSM coz you will get banned if they dont like you.... ouch
---
Don't worry, you will before me and it eon't take long, every thing CCP does to kiss uup to you has an unforseen(by you and cvp) consequence right back against you.
---
Nooooo
---
Right Click Jump To is recruiting. Let me know if you're interested.
---
This sounds no different to me than any other player that got banned after they got caught.
---
You done goofed, son.  To bad, so sad.
---
"Guys im not bitter, I promise!
---
See I even joked around on the naz post

Guyssss? "

Hell ya, not were thinking about the REAL issues here.

Public fucking ban reports for all players.
---
Everyone in this game has alts. How do we know if an alt wasn't used to do the deed?
---
HAW dreads were just collateral damage
---
You didn't read about the explosion speed and radii nerf, did you ?

Or are you 100% clueless of the actual, not the imagined carriers capabilities in pvp and pve?
---
free the stunt!

I AM NOT A CROOK.

0 second gif, why
---
They go hand in hand
---
You're basically the only one who think so, everyone agrees this change is changing very little if you have more than two neurons.
---
Foxhole has an active core of players who have played, which gets refreshed once in a while with a flood of newer players. The community is quite helpful and (generally) friendly ~~(certainly compared to many other gaming communities I've seen).~~
---
This.
---
&gt;  And compounding that by coming out swinging and attacking CCP's conduct simply reeks of the worst kind of political shit-slinging.
---
When you're caught in a lie (or in this case, a scandal), admit nothing and make counter accusations.
---
You can't sign an NDA with a false identity.
---
As if we did not have enough local corrupted politicians to write about as it is. :D

"EVE is dying" posts run directly counter to your point.

On the official forums he said he "believed" he'd done nothing wrong. So what exactly did he do that he thought was ok?
---
&gt;It always shocks me how in EVE people measure progress by their SP and isk and not their fun/hr. In a sandbox people still value $$ over joy lol.
---
maybe, but just trying to stop the "CCP can't say anything because of NDA" disinfo
---
There’s been a tiny number of times where CCP has publicly disclosed that someone specifically was banned. There’s a similar number of times where CCP has publicly disclosed *why* someone was banned.
---
GigX is one, as is Noobman. The Mittani is another. None of those bans has ever even remotely been disputable. What suggestion is there that this time would be any different? They publicly disclosed the bans in all of these cases because it made sense to do so out of a sense of transparency. Only Noobman’s is relevant to this scenario, and in the sense of people cheating using inside information they have a history of firing employees when caught doing that as well.
---
Brisc likely knows exactly what he’s banned for. He also likely knows that it benefits no one for CCP to release any information about him. What he likely wants to do is discredit the credibility of CCPs claims in a way that provides the greatest ambiguity possible. A court case of any kind does little to help him in that sense. By discrediting CCP based on their “lack of providing evidence” he’s also potentially building an argument that he can use in the future to sweep away anything that comes of this for his day job when the dust settles. Going to court to fight a defamation charge that he’s going to have a tough time winning coupled with the extremely high risk of serious and credible evidence being disclosed that could be potentially damaging means that the risk/reward ratio of him pursuing a case is incredibly high. It makes no sense.

Boaty McBoatface for CSM.
---
He didn't write this statement to you. He wrote it to CCP lawyers. The translation to human is:
---
Look dudes! My real life income depends on not breaking NDAs, so your statement is ruining me. Therefore I have no chance but to sue you and fight with everything I can. How about we avoid that, you post an apology and clear my name and in turn I announce that I leave EVE on my own accord, this way none of us is ruined.

I have also wondered this as I see it a lot
---
 idk ,dps on my [naglfar](https://imgur.com/a/crIqWFH) looks normal .
---
do you have a fucking brain malfunction?
---
They've always had the power to ban anyone they like without reason, you agree to it when you open an account.
---
Sebo prices spiked for a reason. Remove NSA put in 2 sebos, and you are fine.

Glad to hear you upgraded from voodoo 3Dfx

They did as much as work as most of your alliance fc does.

Till this started probably on April 1st and it took CCP a week to clear their ticketing system queue.
---
No u

I got 3600 dps on my nag, while it should be 3900 according to pyfa (skills imported). Somewhat confused
---
Praise James!
---
Indeed it was, on Saturday at 7am.  On Sunday at 17.15 it was attached to our internal defect (created 30th March) tracking the issue by a volunteer bug hunter.  The defect was resolved yesterday but due to timing did not make it into the RC and the fix will be in tomorrow's patch.
---
Everyone:
---
r/eve: (another dumpster fire)
---
Can we disband your posting first
---
nice nag fit
---
Some Rolling Rock, good choice.
---
it's something that's hard to get over until you've either had more isk than anyone needs or more cap pilots than you need. Many people choose than to realize you don't actually need all that sp or ISK to have fun.
---
&gt; might be hard for CCP to enforce now 
---
Or they continue to ignore everyone and keep on banning.
---
Prediction: It won't stop until you all stop playing EvE.
---
Shut up shillguy
---
 You put a gun on the off chance that someone sees it and thinks that you are bait.
---
“I hate drama, thats why I hang out with guys”
---
-r/eve
---
Its the Commissar's job to shoot anybody who says otherwise.
---
CCP should never ever harm a player RL by doing stuff like they did in a way they did.        
---
Like WTF even if some information leaked this is the worst way to approach the situation - aka don't talk to Brisc - go 'toxic' public and ignore him when he tries to contact or clarify the situation.        
---
WTF CCP.
---
I love the people complaining CCP hasn't responded with evidence yet assuming they've simply refused to.
---
Whether or not they refuse to release it is to be seen. CCP is historically slow to act when it comes to PR shitstorms.
---
[Oh boi.](https://i.snag.gy/KSdpJB.jpg)
---
Indictment is an accusation. Accusation is not proof of guilt.
---
The Democrat playbook includes miring their opponents in legal proceedings then accusing them of being "badmen" because of said proceedings. It's just a different form of attack from a party of old, rich white people who are desperate for power.
---
Take that conspirtard Russian nonsense we heard about for two years, pushed by Democratic agents and politicians. It baffles me how anyone with a working brain would trust the Democratic party to represent their interests.
---
Ootl?
---
It's called Night Court, thank you very much
---
It was really funny to hear his name involved with that. Because the guy was always being a dick. It finally caught up with him.
---
I wonder what the problem is that caused the delay.
---
Alright, let me know how that goes. I'm literally on the edge of my sight.
---
And it is against reddit rules, also in some countries it is against the law.        
---
But as we have people from around the world... and i don't even care to check under what laws reddit operates .... **it is against reddit rules**
---
I watched a review and some gameplay, seems like it and plus the local voip, it actually seems a lot like Eve with logistics, crafting and carving out territory.
---
Someone being banned doesn't usually get a news article on the eveonline website either. They could have kept quite. Or just say they parted ways or whatever. 
---
But they had to make a public statement about it knowing his in-game persona is linked to his RL persona. Without giving him or anyone any proof of what exactly he did. His alliance mates could have just made a good guess buying the right thing from the market or whatever.
---
Brisc, Shines (and Pando) are the accused.
---
It was one ping written after our Auth system removed those mentioned due to not having linked Active eve accounts.
---
The edits are due to conflicting information about whether pando was the third banned player. He was included again after I confirmed with him in PM. Yes I am a hitchhiker's guide fan !
---
Accept that they are accusing him publicly of a real life breach of contract. If you are going to publicly disclose that, you open yourself up to actual legal issues if you can not prove it.
---
he did, but this is reddit, a gaming reddit         
---
I don't want to violate someone RL i want to talk about EVE.          
---
Stuff is against reddit rules - that is enough for me as this simply can close this subject.
---
That's not what it sounds like from reading their statement. Not being able to bring electronics in to CSM meetings anymore? Sounds like they found out somebody was streaming or recording.
---
wasn't this already caught on the test server .. I think you might be right
---
It is fucked up and need to come to end.      
---
People are stepping out of line and going to someone **real life** because of ingame agenda.           
---
LIKE WTF
---
No, it isn't. We're shutting down anything beyond what was in his CSM campaign video but there's a very clear line between public figure and doxxing. Every single rule you linked in the OP accounts for this:
---
&gt; Releasing personal information or connecting any Reddit account or eve account to a real identity will lead to a permanent ban. Same goes for posting personal images
---
1: Releasing personal information - nothing has been released here. It's the same image as the CSM video. If something else appears, report it.
---
&gt; connecting any Reddit account or eve account to a real identity
---
This was done by the person in question.
---
&gt; Same goes for posting personal images
---
Picture at a private party? Personal image. Picture of him on Rachel Maddow on MSNBC used in his CSM video? Not personal.
---
Your last paragraph you skipped over the very first sentence:
---
&gt; Public figures can be an exception to this rule
---
This part you should report if you see it:
---
&gt; But don't post anything inviting harassment
---
I'll define harassment as any form of encouragement to fuck with Briscs real life. Think: Calling him or people he knows.
---
So no, it isn't doxxing in any way, shape or form. This is heavily reflected in both our rules and reddits rules.
---
Zzzzzz
---
Yes, you're a uniquely smart dude in the world of Eve Online that has understood this patch will bring doom to everyone.
---
Those are not HAW weapons
---
Wait you think anything else is going to happen regarding this? 🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
---
Where is test at these days?
---
Our Corp used to be in test but after test lost fountain we stayed in fountain NPC space and formed a small alliance with some other small corps that wanted to stay behind.
---
I always participated in the large fleet ops when I could but preferred solo or small corps ops. Roaming around in enemy space in t2/faction cruisers or t3s. Not sure I would be a good fit for a large corp like Dreddit. Much prefer to have a small tigth-knit group.
---
How has the value of isk/ships changed over the last 2 years? Between my main and 2 alts I had something like 30 bil isk and 100+ bil in ships (mostly faction cruisers and BS, something like 10 t3s and tons of dead space mods).
---
Between my 3 accounts I could fly everything from all races up to Marauder's and while I was away I think I finished training for the t2 transports/haulers and the jumpfreighters. Don't think I would go back to running 3 accounts since back then I was making so much isk that I could sub all 3 using Plex and still have lots of spare money and ships (usually one night of plex running would be enough to sub all 3 for a month back when plex was at 1 to 1.5 bil)
---
Speaking of t3s, how are they nowadays? They were by far my favorite ship to run. They were so versatile for running dead space sites and probing other complexe runners out (also ganking mission runners). God I miss the days of 100mn tengus with links lol. Those were the days.
---
Wherever I ended up going I don't think it would be worth it to move that stuff. But then again I probably couldn't sell it in fountain so would have to at least get it to jita.
---
OH OH Ii wil GO so On ReDit TherE is Some GuY thAt was Useing the CsM to LiEKe Get free Stuff And he Got BanHammeR Like YesterDasy HapyPY EndnNDing YES!
---
So like this CSM guy from WH (heavily related to NCPL) that got also banned.      
---
I made like 1000 posts about it and involved his real life .... oh wait.
---
Did he link his real life identity to his in game identity?
---
Balance changes : Yes
---
Obviously it's not enough for everyone else including the moderators. This is will be a good example to point to in the future when your EvE buddy thinks it's a good idea to link his real life with EvE.
---
Also, can we stop the virtue signaling bullshit? The mods already stated if Brisc comes forward and asks the pictures are taken down they would do it.  Brisc hasn't done so. It's not our job to decide what he wants.
---
Your comparison is actually completely nonsensical and illogical, so you've got that going for you.
---
Everyone knows Eve players have large sig radius’s
---
If you switch to the 5 year view, the highest average concurrent players for 2018 was lower than it was 2017, 2016 and 2015. Over all the graph doesn't look like it's in a huge "eve is dying" decline either, but certainly not growing. (what happened at the end of 2016 / beginning of 2017 that caused that huge spike and drop?)
---
Uh commander, there are missile launchers just floating in space over there
---
True. Under socialism when things go bad, you can just exterminate anyone who criticizes you and blame it on capitalism.
---
Ok? Congrats to them?
---
It's just NC paying their rent.
---
Not just me, most othets don't even bother with the likes of you, that's what I was saying.
---
First thing: I dont want to defend him! I dont know what happened behind the scenes, but if his statement is true then CCP didnt try to talk to him BEFORE banning him/going public. 
---
Normally that would be ok for a random account botting somewhere in 0.0, but this is not some random person. He is a member of the CSM and his RL name &amp; profession are known. On top of that he works as a lawyer/lobbyist/politician where any legal problems could get him in real trouble. I wonder why CCP didnt at least try to resolve this internally before going public like they did...
---
Most underrated post here atm. Please sir, take my upvote.

WOW VERY COOL

Thank you for the subtitles! Learning from other FCs is fun when you know what is being said on comms.

---

---
And you right with 800mm dps of naglfar looks very sad
---
There is no mess, its already over.
---
The likes of me, you mean literally everyone, including alliance leaders who managed to build their alliance success on people carrier and super ratting because they know that sebos and cynos are still a thing ?
---
I loved how many times people from NC probed it down, just to let it go due to neutrals in system.
---
You'll only make the national news if you Davy Crockett about million dollar space battles.
---

---
Do you have a Cerb fit you could recommend?
---
He posts every NPC sotiyo here. To this day I'm not certain anyone knows why.
---
I bet goons sabotaged the development somehow.
---
if eve is dying, its because of braindead retards like you that apparently have no fucking clue how the game works and are only concerned about their ticks/ratting safety.
---
The move to 64-bit has surfaced a number of issues, mostly around memory management.
---
The devs working on getting the 64-bit client ready are making good progress but it makes sense to be as sure as possible that we've resolved these known issues fully before we put the new client in players' hands on TQ.
---
Wait until game comes out of early access imo
---
I have no idea what you think I do ingame, but that ain't gonna stop me laughing at your insane projection and retarded rant.
---
A million up votes for this!!! Let me go make 1,000 more Reddit’s to up vote!
---
TEST is in a good spot, we own a large swathe of the south and have become one of the larger super capital fleets in the game, we have fairly consistent wars  with locals and deployments all over the place. Its a fun bunch of dudes. 
---
Value of ships has gone up in terms of raw isk but not that much past isk inflation. 30bn will keep you pvping in small gang for a good long while. 
---
Dreddit may seem large and daunting but there are smaller sigs and groups that people settle into within dreddit itsself and you get the opportunity to fly with the gods of bombing Preds. 
---
Tengus outside of pve are pretty meh and prots aren't used much either. 
---
Moving from NPC null isn't too bad personally i would give you a hand moving stuff out if you did decide to join Dreddit or a TEST corp.
---
Finally, the nerf phoenixes need to bring them in line with other dreads ^/s
---
Thanks. Was that defect just for rapid torps or all HAW weapons? Because I'm looking into it now with a few others and something funky is going on with the Damage Modifiers for all of them.
---
I play foxhole, it’s really fun, you should try it.
---
Spying isn’t allowed though
---
i have no horse in this race i was just letting you know that just because a company is based in a specific location it is subject to laws of the countries in which it does business.
---
Mind numbing is VNI ratting and mining. At least carrier ratting is super click intense and keeps you constantly engaged instead of pressing F1 once and coming back 20m later.
---
&gt; . The standard to prove defamation against a "public figure" is different, and much higher.
---
There's zero chance he could have avoided being considered a public figure anyway. He's held government positions, run for public office and his current job involves making press appearances to comment on legislation and lobbying government agencies and the legislature. He's close to the textbook definition of a public figure. If that weren't enough his campaign for CSM and publicity around it would have made him a limited purpose public figure for anything having to do with the game and his activities as a CSM member.
---
Pointing out the obvious doesn't really hurt him, but it does emphasize the damages to him since this accusation has potentially severe real life consequences for him that it wouldn't if he were a truck driver.
---
It gets on peoples nerves because they just want to farm their multi-hundred billion blueprints in peace and stainguy brings more attention/eyeballs to the fact that you can PVE several hundred billion isk blueprints or kill/rob the people who do.
---
Sure beats ratting/mining the whole year. Just get all the payout with little time invested

---
I am not sure what I feel now honestly. I literally tried to rat in my carrier for the first time since the patch hit today and I can't be bothered with sisi at all.
---
Running three sebo IIs, not even faction for this. Scanres on all of course, no NSA. Just to test this I left one highslot open as I unfitted said NSA, but I have no FSU to replace it with in the station I was at.
---
I literally get more or less, as this depends, the same amount of ISK paid out to me in bounties compared to what I got yesterday. My 20 minute run was even far from optimal as I still have to try out the best way of doing things now and there was several things I did wrong in that run which lost me time.
---
Was this not tested on Sisi?
---
I'm sorry, are you fucking retarded? BeepBoop847 doesn't get a news article because he's about as relevant as you are. Brisc gets a news article because he was on the fucking CSM.
---
This folks is what happens when you let you child play with gasoline containers and dry cleaning bags.
---
Let's see, shall we? Are CCP with a profit goal set by the Korean overlords rushing into something and opening themselves up to a lawsuit, or is the lobbyist who got caught doing corrupt shit trying to lie his way back on the CSM?
---
So it was ok when he used RL pictures of himself for game related stuff when it was in his favor but it's not ok to use the same pictures now that things have gone to shit. Just politician things I guess...
---
You just described the entire Eve UI design philosophy

Look, I understand what you’re saying. But when ppl have to start worrying about irl from a game then maybe we all need to take a break. But see things from my perspective. If I were the whistle blower and I read that, it would of taken on a whole different meaning. And if ppl had to start worrying about a certain alliance because of some in game corruption then definitely need to take a break from the whole pixelated universe.

Yay today is a free day to roam. HAW dreads are crap, HAW tians are crap. lets get out the fun fleets!

He would have to sue regardless of the reason publicly provided by CCP, right?
---
Makes module balance changes, weapons no longer show up cloaked in graphics engine. Holy shit is that some spaghetti code.
---
Remember those ballets that disappeared and Bush won Florida? Me either
---
Brisc is just a man baby who threatens litigation because that's what he was taught to do was a lobbyist. Even if he wanted to do something it wouldn't be held in US courts. The threats are as hollow as his "I'm innocent" shpiel.
---
I mean, no.
---
Vic was accused publicly by various individuals of varying levels of sexual harassment, and then Funimation and RT terminated their contracts with him once the outrage got big enough. 
---
OTOH, we have Brisc, who was accused privately of violating the CSM NDA by other members of the CSM. CCP then looked over the evidence, agreed with the report, and banned Brisc, Pando, and Shines. He wasnt banned by CCP because they stood to suffer from a PR perspective, as is (probably) the case with Vic.
---

You will do nothing.  You will fade away and be gone, and no one will remember you.   That's because there's nothing to fight.  No recourse, no discussion, no appeal.   Just inane blather on Reddit that no one cares about.
---
Brisc is US lawyer.
---
CCP is Iceland company.
---
Look at how many fucks they dont give about a law suit.
---
Et tu brutix
---
That particular defect was for rapid torps.  There is a 2nd (open) defect discussing overall HAW weapons being around ~1% out - something to do with weapon upgrade effect calculation far as I can surmise from the defect.
---
What are you in about?
---
2 sebos instead of defense on a carrier that already was low on defense in a cloaky camped region can turn the tides towards the blops or dread bombers.
---
And sebos still won't make up for the low application.
---
Lets be real—this subreddit exists for shitposts and dramaposts.  That’s why I’m still here even though I won Eve 3 years ago.
---
What’s mind numbing about not being stuck ratting, unless you LOVE playing lock, F1...

My VNI makes me money, while I pvp. Definitely not mind numbing imo, idk what you smoking on..

Well, most of them are icelandic, after all.

---
I mean I get the logic of that, but I wpuld've thought anyone inclined to drop on the fleets running them or try steal the loot is probably already watching them. I guess I meant more "who is this for?" than "why post".
---
If only they delayed everything that wasn't ready for activation. 
---
Like every content patch 
---
Or bans

I don't know. I won Eve for years. Now I'm back.

CCP already removed the advantage gained from this breach.
---
Giving people access to an information related to an upcoming feature/change that could impact the economy and is not ready yet would be the worst move they could make.
---
2 had MJD's. But yeah, that 1 guy had to sacrifice a mid just for his balls.
---
It was brisc and init causing plex prices to spike
---
Oh StainGuy, please never change. 
---
He voluntarily submitted all the info we need to make memes. 
---
But if someone goes out for Brisc in RL, i hope federal court is gonna have a field day with such fucker.
---
Thanks for the update.
---
Ather the devs be upfront and transparent about possible delays and make sure the new product performs smoothly as possible. Think we've all seen what an early release ~~new chat~~ can be like. Take your time and keep up the good work.
---
Thats what the info said. Last time I checked though a HAW nag shouldnt be doing almost 5k+ DPS like a 2x modifier would suggest
---
Goons vulcan mind melded him violating the nda
---
I'm not panicking and i have my towel.
---
Ok, good to know that you're tracking.
---
I was comparing a HAW nag fit before and after, and I was seeing a ~10% drop in DPS. 
---
Other people are reporting different results, and there's seemingly no consistency in results so I haven't been able to put together a good bug report
---
There was also a ~4-5% drop in the damage modifier between pyfa and ingame. I know pyfa doesn't always get it perfect, but that %error seems high. 
---
Another person was comparing a Moros fit with pyfa vs ingame, and their %error for the damage modifier was more in-line with your ~1% figure.
---
I only really started digging into this this morning but I'm out of time.
---
ccp fucked up, nothing new
---
But will any suit related to the game ever be admitted in court?
---
I sincerely doubt that any court will be willing to spend time on these things.
---
You can sue but it would be something along the lines of beach of contract (by CCP)/wrongful termination and only to resolve whether he broke the NDA or not. Nothing related to libel. And only if CCP doesn't give him specific examples of how the NDA was violated. If they give him examples then he can contest but any good lawyer would probably look and stop you if there was nothing.
---
Now he can (and objectively speaking probably should) do both the libel and breach of contract (they'll most likely get rolled together into one suit though).
---
I do think that they probably should have avoided saying that he breached the NDA.
---
That is an actual, real world legal offense.  He might be able to argue that they did not prove in a court (due process) that he actually breached it.  
---
My bet is that this just dies off though, and we stop hearing about it.
---
It's almost like he should have kept his rl and Eve names separated if he was so high and mighty
---
customizable interiors when?
---
I want the gallente one with the holographic dancer pls
---
Oh hey, Aryth.
---
DW pretty sure the worst one is corbexx, who joined goons the second he got elected the 2nd time.
---
&gt; That is, ccp is used to kicking and banning people without having to consult their legal department so they may have done so in this case as well.
---
Just to be clear, banning him is fine. It's publishing a press release accusing him of violating an NDA which could be a legal problem for CCP. 
---
Unfortunately for Brisc as a public figure it's almost impossible for him to win a libel suit in the USA against CCP. If he's innocent though he might want to sue anyway to find out the basis of the accusation and get any exonerating info out there.... maybe find out if he has a more winnable case for slander against one or more CSM members. Or, he could sue them in Iceland which probably doesn't have the same public vs. private figure distinctions which arose out of the USA's first amendment.
---
As my ex-gf (god bless her immortal soul) used to say: 
---
Better late than early.
---
That libel suit only has grounds if CCP has exactly zero evidence that Brisc broke an NDA, however. I understand why they went this way - they want to make an example out of Brisc, given how "collusion" with players in the past hasn't gone well (T20, literally any thread about the CSM).
---
Likely the only reason we haven't seen proof of Brisc violating the NDA is that it concerns changes yet-to-be-seen, and CCP rightly doesn't want to reveal that unless compelled to by court of law. They could and probably should reveal that information to at least Brisc himself, given that he probably couldn't break the NDA on something he didn't know about, but we wouldn't exactly have proof that that transaction of information took place either. However, as said before, the moment CCP gets wheeled in front of a court of law, all they have to do is disclose whatever evidence they have of Brisc breaking the NDA, and then it's an open and shut case.
---
7/11 was a part time job
---
Since english is not my primary language I couldnt care less tbh
---
Your position appears to be that the health of the game in financial terms are objectively linked to people's subjective views on the gameplay quality. The fact that there have always been EVE is dying type posts is evidence that this is not the case and has never been true.
---
My vote is on verbial fluff
---
Isn't it the opposite for the game though? Ugly as fuck but actually functional.
---
I'm not a lawyer but I seriously doubt any sort of international business law applies in this particular situation. I think there's a lot of jargon and half-truths being thrown around. 
---
Are foreign businesses subject to US law if they do business in the US? 
---
\-Yes, but it's not quite as simple as everyone is trying to make it. Just a small amount of reading on the subject left me with more questions than answers. The short answer would be: it depends. 
---
Can CCP be sued for libel in Brisk's case?  
---
\-You can try to sue anyone for anything in the US. The real question is will it amount to anything? I seriously doubt it.  The US has the most friendly laws for the defendant when it comes to libel and plaintiffs have a high bar to meet. 
---
Honestly, Birsc is posturing hoping CCP will back down. I doubt that will happen. Even if they take the safe road and recant their public statement, he's done. They're not going to reinstate his account. Especially after the little shit show he's trying to put on.  He should have handled it privately. Maybe CCP thought they were doing the right thing in at least giving the community an explanation for banning one of the most high profile members of the community. It looks like they'll probably rethink doing that again. It will be back to no answers on those questions.

Imagine thinking CCP taking the briscuit has anything to do with content. And lmao thinking the nerfs will reduce content rather than increase it
---
It happens more often than you think.
---
In most cases, it brings better people than the ones that actually want to be politicians.
---
People in authority are usually the people you don't want there.
---
Too bad they fired the only people with social skills on their staff.
---
The NDA is signed by the real person, not the in-game character. As a lawyer, regardless of whether he linked the 2 in any other way, breaching that NDA would be a serious ethical violation that would likely need to be reported to his state BAR.
---
You take the eve is dying posts seriously? Your argument and point of view says more about you than me... I think you need to take a little step back m8.

You mean you don't like inefficient use of screen real-estate and poor delineation of different elements in the name of *A E S T H E T I C*?

Oh [they knew](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bb71zo/psa_new_siege_module_rapid_torpedo_weapon_bonus/ekgrt3c/) they just didn't think it was important enough to force the fix before the patch went out or something.

&gt; brisc would have to prove damages to have a defamation suit
---
That would be really easy to prove though. 
---
&gt; which, oh look your account was always our property it says so right here in this eula
---
The ban isn't the problem. The press release accusing him of violating an NDA is.
---
*aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*
---
&gt; First off, why on earth would you think that reminding everyone that you are a lawyer, a lobbyist, and a politician (!) is a good idea?
---
This is less about public relations and more about implicitly threatening CCP with a libel lawsuit. He mentions that he's a lawyer and lobbyist because this particular accusation is particularly damaging to him in ways it wouldn't be for a truck driver. NDA's are his bread and butter and an accusation that he violated one for a spaceship game is going to have a real impact his career. He also has professional ethics obligations to state bar associations and ethics laws which he has to comply with as a licensed lobbyist etc.
---
Language.
---
Hey, I actually read you guys &lt;3
---
But if they say publicly that he was banned because 'reasons' wouldn't it weaken CCP's position in a lawsuit?
---
they fked up way seriously and yet people still pretending it did not happen
---
You need to inform me of these, I have good Guristas standings bruh
---
I've been a world of warcraft player for a long time. I've done this song and dance before you aren't treading new ground here. Your "wow you think that's serious" deflection falls completely flat on its face when we both know that any given post could be either or. There are people who joke about it and there are people who genuinely quit the game because they feel that X change is 'ruining it.'
---
/r/eve is worse
---
The Mittani sends his regards.
---
It's for the better, mass test showed some epic memory leaks. I'd rather wait
---
&gt; Maybe he should sue them instead then?
---
He wouldn't have a case against them. They're only reporting what CCP said which is perfectly fine. CCP is the one that issued a **press release** making the accusation. IF it is false and IF he can prove that he has a potential libel suit. 
---
As a public figure though he has a snowball's chance in hell of winning. If he were some random person he'd only have to prove they were negligent, as a public figure he has to prove they did it out of malice.

The hangars do look darker than they did before.  That's part of the design.  If you think that what you're seeing is broken, please submit a bug report in-game (F12 -&gt; Report Bug) and include screenshots so we can evaluate whether you're experiencing something unintended.

Not entirely sure why you being a wow player has any relevance... Also eve is a good year older than wow. I've seen this song and dance countless times before in eve.

Wow a post with nothing original said..how pleasant.

They cant explain their case in such events for super obvious reasons, that doesnt necessarily make them unsubstantiated.
---
lamo
---
Honestly,  I wouldn't doubt that CCP is thinking they should just can the whole fucking thing, especially after this shitshow.
---
It's obviously been more trouble than it's worth and would save them time and money. Randomly surveyed players would give better advice than a group of alliance promoted puppets. Just saying

system ship was built in?

Punishing isnt what makes eve eve tho. Cuz if that was the only reason eve is eve why the fuck am I playing it I hate shit like darksouls and dayz.
---
So I repet snowflakes dont like losing theyre stuff eve makes being lose said stuff.
---
Most of those games are more survival than anything else. I could say space engineers or empyrion is close but im still miles away. Honestly the closest game ive played to eve has been a text based one from decades aco called medieva that is the only other game ive seen as much play choice and freedom.

So yes they are popular but they dont have the same flavor as eve.

I'm just gonna download more

Sounds like he was genuinely trying to take expert opinion from alliance mates but one of em got greedy and acted on the insider info and in process fucked Brisc over in RL. He essentially  fucking got betrayed and backstabbed here by Shines or Panda.
---
In either case, whether he was doing it out of genuine intention to contribute more productively, he breached the NDA. So, there he goes down, but that didn't fuck him over, but the information that was acted upon by being greedy is what essentially fucked him over.

Take a look at the kiki skin. There is an interesting line where the "red dot" is with the white light animations. [https://imgur.com/a/fDyEyWC](https://imgur.com/a/fDyEyWC) (sorry for the shitty picture), my gamma is low and doesn't work well for screenshots apparently. In game its much clearer.
---
Where that red dot is though, it appears to be a link of systems like in the solar system map, and the red dot is a focal point system. Maybe where an invasion would start?

If you were the leader of a coalition that had a major part if their player base carrier ratting(not super), would you admit to them that they CCP fucked them and create panic or try to pull the time until you and them can think of something to replace their income method hopefuly still keeping them around as you need them to stay around and capable of fielding ships to defend your dpace?
---
Lobbyist to be more specific. 
---
But that, in fact, makes it even less surprising.
---
They don't need any case.  CCP can remove you from the game just because. They don't need a reason.  lol

Currently burning with a ceptor to c-j seems ccp has stepped up the easter egg game

No because that's neither what's going to happen nor what CCP intended.

Any company that does business in the US can be sued in US courts. Yes, they are based in Iceland which does not matter one bit.  Doing business over the internet to US customers makes them subject to lawsuits in US courts.

---
People declaring the game dead unironically (even if you don't want to admit it they do exist) run directly counter to the point that the subjective quality of the gameplay is directly equivalent to a game's profitability. People think the game is getting worse with the changes, the game's profitability doesn't go down. Therefore they cannot be the same thing.

If siege mod is stacking penalized with damage mods, it will be much more than 1%. For example, naglfar with 3 faction gyros:
---
No stacking penalty: (1+1)×(1+0.12)×(1+0.12×0.87)×(1+0.12×0.57) = 2.64306775
---
Stacking penalty: (1+1)×(1+0.12×0.87)×(1+0.12×0.57)×(1+0.12×0.29) = 2.442005811
---
It's 8.23% difference in volley and dps. For phoenix it will be similar difference in rof and dps.
---
Gun damage mods (like MFS) use postMultiplication, to avoid siege being stacking penalized just use preMultiplication \* 2 or preDivision / 0.5 or postDivision / 0.5 (like you do on t3d modes to avoid stacking penalties).
---
Missile damage mods seem to use postMul as well, so resolution is basically the same.
---
The NDA has no bearing on what CSM members say about each other. CCP will never reveal why they banned Brisc; they have never revealed why they have banned anyone (hell, it's highly unusual for them to confirm that they *have* banned anyone much less why).
---
But the CSM members involved could talk about it today if they chose to with no danger of breaking the NDA. They probably won't either, but they *could*.
---
Shut up back there!

15 years of work whipped out from under me with no chance to prove myself innocent, it kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

&gt; Its not so clear cut and dry as you make it out to be. CCP did not disclose his RL identity. That was 100% his choice in a game / hobby that has a history of affecting people IRL. This was purely his decision and 100% purely his negligince even without any evidence or evidence not holding up, the RL damages can not be attributed to CCP.
---
That doesn't matter one bit legally. It's not like they didn't know that his IRL identity is publicly known, nor did he only reveal it after they made the accusation. There's nothing "negligent" or wrong about him making his real life identity known.
---
Their press release did a huge amount of damage his reputation and career prospects. ***IF*** (and only if) the accusation is unfounded and they didn't do their due diligence before issuing the press release he has a very real cause for action to bring a defamation suit against CCP.
---
Ehhh depends entirely on what your against.. I can agree its rep is great. But I would rather a t1 logi and a vni.. But I do see your point.

There've been some in-game changes to the UI in the name of "modernization" that some players have despised, such as changing all of the Neocom icons to the same color, making it harder to differentiate between them.

C-J6mt is where all the particle effects on that skin are colliding, and the QA-P7J Constellation is what's mapped with it.
---
Guess the real question is; Is this a mistake on CCP's part for releasing these skins before they had time to actually put something in C-J? Or was it intentional and there is actually something unique in that system now.
---
Lol you guys are getting barbequed by pine cones and no vacancies lol. That says alot.
---
also, no tests necessary
---
Out of everything that happened, I genuinely hope INIT is okay, even the morons that are acting like Brisc is innocent. The whole point of the NDA (game side) is to prevent people from having an advantage and damage the game's future and Brisc has done that in more ways than one now. He took the risk of leaking info and now line members have to pay.
---
Looks fine to me
---
Whoa, a post that isnt about briscexit?!
---
Since you’re quitting eve, can I have all your stuff?
---
Something like this probably. 
---
Being drunk on EVE coms can kill your entire career IRL.
---
Oh, the power of EVE.
---
If Brisc was a libel attorney he would have known announcing himself to be a public figure hurts his chances, it doesn't help them. A public figure must prove actual financial damages.
---
CCP doesn't ban without evidence. Just because they're not showing everyone doesn't mean it doesn't exist
---
Anyone can appreciate a good write. This was indeed one of them lol
---
&gt; First of all we don't know that
---
Don’t know what? What we know is that people were banned. We also know the reason for the ban: NDA violation with an in-game impact. We also know that this kind of insider information leading to in game effects is considered cheating and against the EULA.
---
What we (for the sake of argument) don’t know is what evidence CCP based their decision on. Ultimately though that’s relevant to only three (known) people and given the situation we can’t hope or expect to know more. If CCP had chosen to not disclose why Brisc, Pando and Shines were banned as well as Brisc being removed from the CSM this community would be going even more berserk than it already is.
---
This whole thing is dumb. People who believe Brisc because he claims to not know what’s going on are being intensely naive. Claiming CCP shouldn’t have told us why they did what they did is foolish.
---
I liked Brisc. This sorta sucks. I thought he was probably one of the best CSM representatives at getting the average EVE player’s voice out there. He seemed reasonable and listened to suggestions, even about areas of the game he didn’t participate in. None of those things matter at all, however, now that he’s been banned and removed.
---
Fuck off, we're full
---
I say'd "if".  
---
If Brisc didn't break the NDA then there will be a lawsuit. Because he can sue CCP if he didn't.
---
lm just waiting for the drama to kick off

You don't get to appeal anything. If they have evidence of it, your entire bullshittery goes out the window. Door is that way. -&gt;

Did the Donald take over the eve sub?
---
They do business here, they can get sued here. In fact, they can get sued in a lot of places, many of them are much more sympathetic than US courts when it comes to defamation. I can't wait for discovery, that'll be a hoot.
---
To be honest with you, and maybe it's because I don't carrier rat or fly dreads/titans,,, I simply do not see EVE Online is such a disheartening decline that it makes me look for/hope for a spiritual successor.
---
I will continue to play the game as I have since Oct 2012 and enjoy every moment until such time as the game ceases to exist (if that ever actually happens).
---
The day after that happened. Corbexx and a lot of the rest of the CSM members were unironically talking on Skype about "people are overreacting" and "why does this make anyone mad?" I tried to explain, from the view of a fellow CSM and pseudo-wormholer, that it \*seemed\* like a giant \*backstab\* to run as an "independent" and then switch political parties \*after winning\* and can you imagine how mad people would be if this happened in a real-life election.

Yeah, but under American Law he probably has to prove CCP acted with "actual malice" and by "knowing the falsity" or having "reckless disregard for the truth". If CCP did ANY sort of cursory investigation, there's probably no room for a successful libel suit, unless Icelandic law makes proving libel a lot easier than American law does.
---
as someone who was in exceed/no holes barred back in the day i literally found out on the FF livestream. The whole corp was so mad.
---
I'm sure Brisc will have fun with a libel suit after describing himself as a public figure...
---
While I agree with the majority of this post, don't give him the credit of being a politician.  He's a lobbyist, and lobbyists are the detritus of the American political system.  I'd call them all bottom feeders, but catfish don't deserve the insult of being compared to lobbyists.

Doing a quick Google it looks like lobbying the EU is very different. In fact you could almost, ***almost***, make the case that in the US, lobbyists would have shut down an article 13.

Just love the Stratios. A blinged one with the right Pilot in the controls can screw a lot of people's day.
---
I understand the NDA implications. My issue is these guys not having the opportunity to defend themselves, given the circumstances. CCP admits this information came from the CSM, not from something CCP monitored internally. 
---
If this very sensitive NDA info is so important, why post a devblog that literally everyone logging into the game will see, all while the accused players have zero information about what’s going on?
---
Like him or not, he’s an elected community rep, and an alliance leader. Summarily executing him (and 2 other major FCs) affects thousands of players. They’re not rando botters or RMTers, they should have an opportunity to answer the charges before CCP alerts the media and the entire player base.

Maybe sometime in the next few years I will stop clicking the market to open the map.

Well, you can push the analogy too far. Caesar wanted to make life better for the prols.

I cannot believe I am defending a lobbyist, and a Republican at that; however, *potentially* this is the very reason defamation and slander laws exist. Because it turns out people can say things out of malice, or negligence because they think something, which can have real world consequences for the person they say them about.   
---
So if someone lies about you publicly, it gets posted all over the internet and connected to you, and you lose your job, then you have some legal resource. Parsing out whether or not someone has harmed you in some significant way is *exactly* what a legal process is all about. 
---
You see... the real world is not EVE online; and maybe you have been playing this game too long if you think you can say or do whatever you want and there should be absolutely no consequences when what you do causes damage to other people.

Current spawn mechanic is flawed as it promotes half of eve and allows spawns deep in sov space where there is almost no possibility for escalation.         
---
This was meant to be PvEvP so PVE leading to PVP and person victorious takes the prize.           
---
Fix for this is quite simple - make those Sotiyos spawn only in NPC nullsec - as **anyone** can contest them by pre staging in NPC stations in the area.           
---
So this is my agenda - by making them public i significantly bring the visibility on the matter - making less likely to run them quietly, thus reducing the "turnover rate" and leading to more fights about them. (like 3 sotiyos that i posted here where contested and capitals died)

My goal is to get CCP attention enough for adjusting the spawns so it will be truly PVE**vP**

On the one hand, doing this stupid shit could lose him his job. On the other, it wouldn't be the first time someone did some stupid shit online and lose their job.

Who cares, CCP is going to remove POS within the next few months(years? decades?).  They all be gone then.

CCP is not going to spend time and money changing game mechanics that are going away in the future unless really necessary. That's like renovating the kitchen of a house that scheduled for demolition.

I do want to be clear, though: While Corbexx' decision to jump to Goons was terrible, he DID still do a lot of good work helping guide many changes through the lens of WH space. I always bring this up, but CSM Citadel design discussion would have been a 100% disaster for wormholes if Corbexx (to a greater extent) and I (to an obviously lesser extent) weren't around to say "No actually you can't do that with timers/tethers/clones/fuel/etc because it will instantly destroy wormhole space as we know it."

You think CCP will take a hands off approach to that work around?
---
Kurt cobain too
---
Maybe they don't need a filter. All this "filtering" has seemed to only promote a minority of player opinions and not EvE as a whole. Not to mention the number of scandals that have broken due to these players using their position of knowledge and influence to further promote their own groups interest. Who would want to have to keep dealing with the fallout from that? 
---
I think the Brisc incident might just be the nail in the coffin for the CSM. It may have weathered it had he not wanted to turn it in to a fucking circus. Him and his little mouthpieces though are just furthering the idea that it's just not in their interest to keep this thing going anymore.

Can confirm winning eve for two years but still checking in here for the drama
---
Seems like ccp just left it in by accident nothing happening rn
---
I think during all your mining, that spod dust got to your head. THIS is why you mine the Ochre first.

maybe, but why would i ever trust/vote for u again after u pull smth like this
---
CCP; 1 step forwards, and 10 stairs down with a broken leg.

---
Davy Crockett's my dad thank you very much
---
The curious and their ignorance are easily parted.
---
I thought we caught this on SiSi like two weeks ago?
---
Yes. They can ban you. You make that agreement in the beginning.   
---
If though, you make a public announcement, disparaging a person with no proof for a real life breach of contract, you open yourself up to a person suing you. Not for reinstatement, but libel.   
---
Now, if they have real evidence of his guilt, then they can present that in court and possibly convince the judge that the actual proof once shown to the court and the defendant and they can order that it not be made public.     
---
But, if taken to court they can not just no produce any evidence of the breach. If he is innocent and takes them to court and they either do not posses or refuse to show evidence of the breach, it is very possible that they would be on the hook for a libel judgement and that could be expensive.   
---
In the end though he would still be banned.
---
Implying bastion ever really lived.
---
Just because they can't explain their case for obvious reasons doesn't make them substantiated either.    
---
The fact that they haven't explained them does make them unsubstantiated.  That doesn't mean they're wrong.
---
The issue presented is whether or not Brisc is a public figure as set forth in the Sullivan Doctrine.
---
Arguably he's a public figure only in game/gaming non-public company that is a commercial venture that most people have never heard of. It's not like he's on the the board or some commitee of Microsoft. 
---
Which means this all is so ambiguous it's not only perfect for litigation, from his standpoint, it all would make a great law school or bar exam question.
---
be careful around /u/masterpierround he sent me nude dm's after finding out I was underage
---
CPR then headshot
---
&gt;This is literally the heart and soul of how the legal system works and thus is a major attack on someone in the legal world.
---
What legal system are you talking about here?  Cause Brisc is a lawyer in America where this is absolutely positively untrue.
---
Removed lol
---
Are you using word that you don't know the meaning of?
---
Probably the same guy talking to himself using the same style of broken English buying a newish char for probably a load of isk. Once questioned can just say he really wanted the char and " This is a very formal transaction,legitimate source of the isk"

&gt; but it makes sense to be as sure as possible that we've resolved these known issues fully before we put the new client in players' hands on TQ.
---
One would have thought you would apply the same logic to the capital changes you guys just made....
---
Contrasting how it was handled has nothing to do with the guilt of those involved.
---
The radio silence from, among others, all those CSM members today, who yesterday said they would give an account of what had happened, strongly implies that finally someone called a lawyer at CCP HQ, and all involved were told to STFU until this is over, which is how it should be. The devblog yesterday wasn't done professionally, the dev blog 3½ years ago by Leeloo (which this thread links too) was. Why is that?

&gt;By contrast, American companies like Google or Apple get treated very harshly because they don't have the same political pull.
---
This is one of the most insane things i've ever heard.    
---
They don't have the same pull because they spend less on bribing politicians.  You talk about VW, well they actually got caught.  You should check out the coal lobby in the US at some point.    
---
EU Lobbyists are hamstrung by regulations we would kill to be able to impose.
---
nice witch hunt but there's nothing here to indicate RMT, just a guy with bad English
---
&gt; Very small potatoes in comparison with other shit that is wrong with this game
---
So you think being able to repeatedly decline missions with essentially zero standing loss due to running the boosters, allowing one to maximize farming of LP via choosing only farmable lvl5 missions without the prior and significant 4 hour downtime vs huge standing loss decision tree previously faced without the usage of boosters... is a small potatoes thing?
---
What, my friend, do you think is a "big potatoes" thing, then?
---
In high class WH, useing drea
---
While you got most all of that right Funimation made a public libelous statement about Vics firing based on unfounded and baseless accusations. Not saying its 100% exactly the same just that the situations are similar.

Why would CCP fall under US libel laws?

I'm guessing this is the timeline.  
---
How do you call the remind me bot?
---

---
Bobdamnit not another spike in Mexallon prices
---
So I genuinely have no idea why you responded to my comment with this, but I'll play ball.
---
First off, this has nothing to actually do with the game. Sure, the company runs a game and what he did effected it, but it's about a guy who potentially damaged CCP's monetary income. People have to understand that in-game reprocussions were secondary in nature.
---
Second, it wasn't some dude like CCP Falcon who made the decision, it was most likely brought to their team of laywers who reviewed the NDA and the evidence and the made the call for breach of contract. Claiming a breach of contract isn't the same as a communinty team member banning some random dude for RMT. They have to cover their ass and any rash decisions will have extremely adverse affects on the company's future. While CCP may be a down to Earth company, this situation is no different than if he would have done the same thing with Coca Cola, minus the U.S court part. 
---
Finally, from everything I understand, he wouldn't even get to bring this to U.S court. It would be Icelandic court where he's most likely unfamiliar with the law and wouldn't stand a chance on his own.
---
In short, what happened has nothing to do with the game. Brisc Rubal didn't break an NDA, Brian Schoeneman did. And you're right, real life isn't like Eve and has consequences. He also intentionally directly linked himself with his Eve persona for his whole campaign, so obviously shit is going to track right back to him. 
---
Also, I keep repeating this, how the fuck does someone who professionaly deals with contracts as a lobbyist manage to even get close to being suspect in breaching them? He should know better than literally any other CSM member what he can and cannot say. Unless CCP has a grudge against him (which would directly be finacially irresponsible and illogical), it just makes him sound worse of a lawyer than one that got caught lmfao.
---
I don't think he gives a shit about Eve anymore, the fact that you type in his real name and the first thing that pops up is a breach of contract is bad for his job and he absolutely needs to get his name cleared if he's innocent.
---
A fitting end.
---
Remember when that literal nazi ran for CSM and CCP was like "what no, 1488 and runes invented by himler aren't proof of nazis"?  
---
Lots of homework.
---
You could argue that he's not really a public figure... if it weren't for his reddit post saying "as an attorney and public figure in the United States..."
---
he is in shit fit (also for pve) and take the bait.. Just lol.
---
But thinking, you can do like this, play like a retard (t1 acolyte drone on Hyperion) and be in a good pvp setup to fuck the baiter. Hyperion is a monster in good hand.
---
In hight class WH, anoms can be done by dreads.  
---
I mean, they was made to bring chalenge (and isk) to capital ship
---
My question is:  "Who the fuck cares?"  
---
This guy is no different than any other stupid pleb that has ever been banned for breaking the rules and he shouldn't be treated any different either.
---
He's throwing around a lot of swag from RL, hoping that it'll intimidate CCP into revoking the ban, all while claiming innocence.
---
And we're all surprised?
---
What'd we think he'd do? 
---
"Ooops, yup you got me guys.  Thanks for setting me straight.  I'll show myself out now."
---
That's not how these characters work.
---
Here's how it always goes:
---
\-Deny
---
\-Demand clarity for ban
---
\-Plead for community support
---
\-Company drops logs
---
\-"Game's shit anyway" tirade from rightly accused.
---
And this will be no different.  Guaranteed.
---
sad i can only upvote once ...
---
Please come farm my wormhole instead. Pleaseeeeeeee

And, opposed to some other CSM guys, not a very competent one regarding game design and balance

It looks like it could be cool, for as much as you can make out.
---
Everyone remaing F\*\*\*ing calm!!
---
Ty, this is what I was looking for
---
It’s stuff like this that makes me forever fascinated with EVE, despite only playing it for a few hours and deciding the actual gameplay wasn’t for me. I also think it’s crazy that a lobbyist, someone who has a job that you would think requires almost everything you can give to succeed, has also played an MMO for 13 years.
---
I just trained into carriers. 😂🔫
---
Activating a filament in the system brings you to an unique abyss site.
---
The bottom line is that U.s. law stops at the waters' edge. CCP does not even have to acknowledge  anything in the U.S., even if in a directed judgment what U.S. assets are there to seize?  AT worst no more Fanfests in North America with direct CCP attendance-saves company and Fans Money, and the presentations from Fanfests are streamed anyway.
---
  Writs could be filed in Iceland/Korea or both, but then  the laws are different and the court systems outside the U.S. make the U.S. system seem speedy.

It's a bit unfair that *only* this guy got banned for what certainly seems to be extremely widespread practice, so widespread that I don't know anyone that has confidence that the big alliances aren't routinely fed information before it becomes public knowledge.

Shocking.

If he is a lawyer, he has to self report this to his bar association. And they don't take kindly to people who break NDAs as judges put them on a bunch of cases. At the very least, he will have to go in front of the bar association for this and risks suspension. They will look at everything from ethics to the breaking of the NDA.

That's exactly how much your HAW nag's dps looks like before the patch.
---
That's true.  You have very good point there.

Lets be honest, is anybody surprised CCP completely fucked the HAW changes? They are becoming the next Studio Wildcard in terms of developer incompetence.
---
*Bing bong, bung bing bong* even
---
You must be high as fuck
---
They're not doing it wrong, we are.
---
CCP is letting us pick our advocates, and I think that's a better system than letting CCP hand pick an echo chamber of "experts" who share their goals and viewpoints. It's you, me, and everyone else in the electorate who are letting it turn into a popularity contest instead of voting for people based on their merits.
---
If you don't think we're finding good candidates then do something about it. Get other people together and form an independent committee to evaluate the candidates and make endorsements based on their ability to contribute real insight instead of their popularity or alliance loyalties. That's how this works IRL (I sometimes manage political campaigns).

They have business holdings within the US and do business within the US.  That is what makes this interesting/complicated.

Can rorquals refit off a depot/ship maintenance bay while in siege?
---
A little tip: reddit stalking is something the admins can and do ban for. It depends on how much and what type of content but if he's following you around a lot that might be an option for you.
---
Otherwise though I nuked him from r/eve.
---
Given how long it took to ban gigx's relatives, I highly doubt that CCP would ban brisc without verifying the validity of claims against him.
---
Pictures or video would be lovely.
---
Yep...never knew Brisc’s US law degree let’s him be able to litigate in Iceland.  
---
Zero fucks given (in Icelandic)
---
He has like 40+ responses, including one from you, so yes?
---
\&gt;No you'r dumb   
---
It is "you're" or "your", there is no such word as you'r. But please, go on.

Well he certainly claimed to be one.

So if I just say shit online, it suddenly becomes true?

We live for this shit.
---
I remember reading somewhere that CCP said this was basically impossible given the way that their code works.
---
I for one have always enjoyed the pos kiting mechanic. The defender is left completely unable to timezone tank his structure like he is so used to doing with citadels and tcu/ihubs, and that in itself is satisfying. The attacker has control and forces the defender to either commit forces to regain grid control to repair it to 50% and restront it or be forced to form at a time which is not convenient for them number wise. POS warfare kiting mechanic is one of the better promoters of pvp content, the timezone tanking mechanic discourages pvp content
---
Pick the argument back up then if that's not what you want to do.
---
Guys I need to know how to explain this to my wife so she gives a shit.
---
What lawsuit? It's their game they have the right to ban anyone for any reason they want. It's in the terms you agreed to when you made your account.
---
You're just talking nonsense honestly. Future of the what? Lose. Not loose.
---
What would really be fascinating would be if the fact that he declared himself to be a public figure would come into play.
---
Holy shit, Good spot man, That looks like it could be this capital / structure we are seeing in the new T5 rooms.
---

Who the fuck is pathfinders? I don’t think they’re a real wormhole corp.

His entire post history is just n***** and f***** and he sent me multiple DMs telling me to kill myself, so I assume he'll get banned eventually. Thanks for the quick response though &lt;3
---
Two Words: The Agency
---
Where has CCP made anything public about this? As far as I know the one making it public is brisc himself.
---
There's no libel suit if they never publicly accused him.
---

Lol all the try hard comments about legal bullshit. It's a game if CCP says u gotz to go then byebye
---
Haha.

I have two paid accounts but I don't play on either one (just playing SkillQueue Online), does this count as winning or am I just losing extra hard?
---
" Brisc knows what he did and why he got caught, it’s just easier to play dumb and villainize CCP. "
---
This is why liable / slander laws exist on the books. The "mob" (Aka the Public) care very little for due process / evidence / trials. They make conclusions based on literally ZERO evidence and are willing to condemn an individual based on rumors alone. Proof that humanity has not changed since the 1600s.... and Salem Trials are still possible.
---
Only if it's on steam!
---
It is great to have subtitles :)
---
Fair
---
No, but when lawyers try to argue that their client is not a public figure, a statement from their client saying "I am a public figure" is pretty hard to overcome.
---

Fuck that, whatever happened to their titan? That's one sexy hull.

---
It does not obligate them to do any of that unless he chooses to file a lawsuit. They do not need to publicly disclose anything if they don’t want to.
---
Just fucking no.
---
So is Brisc ready to purchase a mining permit?
---
Alliances die in fountain. Its like a big graveyard.
---

---
Yall so cute making theories about Triglavian ships &amp; C-J lol
---
C-J is an infamous system in Russian community because it was fought for by Red &amp; XIX for years and years. It was controlled by Red for too long, XIX claimed cultural victory when ownership was changed, there were dozens of separate dramas all over C-J. That is the reference. Pretty sure that's end of story
---
In the context of an ambiguous designation, a statement (online or offline) in which you give that designation to yourself would make it difficult to legally argue against that statement at a later time, provided the statement was not made in jest, out of ignorance, or out of delusion. Brisc's post was coherent, clearly serious, and comes from an attorney, so it was not made out of ignorance. This clearly would serve as pretty strong evidence to assign him the relatively ambiguous designation of "public figure" in the American legal sense.
---
Multiboxing thanks you o7 comrade leaq
---
I think Drama is a massive overstatement.
---
There's no libel there though because you don't do any *provable* character damage by saying "reasons". Any damage to his character is pure speculation and it's reasonable to have to inform the Eve playerbase because of the unique role the CSM has. Straight up saying "He broke an NDA" without any public evidence is very different.
---
Also this is all going off the assumption that CCP has not given him any specifics on what bits he broke. If they did and he then goes to a public form to claim the contrary then he can get into trouble for that (reverse libel effectively).
---
You ready to Amokify?
---
I think its a clue for something. I looked at the front end it looked like some sort map. with lights going into one point

The Ragnarok is good. It was blooded in the legendary battle of DW-T2I which crushed CO2 and dethroned Panfam when PL was exposed as the emperor with no clothes. That battle was the source of the infamous quote:

Question is if it will be finished till fall when the next MacOS comes without 32bit legacy support
---
An NDA is a very real contract.  
---
And he is an US politician. Those people can make a lawsuit out of every bullshit just because their feefees got hurt.
---
Make up your mind. First you say he doesnt get special teatment because he's on the CSM. And now you're saying he is getting special treatment because he is.
---
why does the spaghetti CCP makes always smell like BS?
---
It's a contact for CCP not him. He broke it. Not them. Do you even understand what's happening here?
---
Ok, so if I just say shit online, it does become true.
---
"Sorry dread pilots, there were always going to be some collateral damage."
---
cans dont take shit from guns
---
well, you just said that online, so...
---
&gt; did effected it, but it's about a guy who potentially damaged CCP's monetary income. People have to understand that in-game reprocussions were secondary in nature.
---
I replied to you because you said something about homeboy being someone who just uses legalese to make empty threats--though maybe I quoted the wrong person. 
---
In any case I actually *agree with you* completely. If Brisc is guilty of the accusations against him, fuck him. CCP is within their rights to ban the shit out of him, and tell the world. 
---
The only problem I see, and this goes back to the recent high profile banning of Nolak for RMT, is that CCP seems to have made a habit of banning people and then not providing any detailed information to the party banned regarding what, exactly, led to the ban. 
---
In this case it is even worse, because not only did CCP ban someone, they made a point of announcing to the world that they banned him because of an NDA violation. The real problem is that this person's identity was publicly known, and the person behind the Brisc avatar works as an attorney and lobbyist, a position where he almost certainly is subject to a number of NDAs as part of his every day work. This means that CCP's 'outing' of Brisc will almost *certainly* have real world consequences for Brisc. 
---
Given that, someone on CCP's legal team should be fired, because of the legal exposure *potentially* created by a public 'airing' of the CSMs dirty laundry, in as much as unless CCP's evidence against Brisc is rock fucking solid, CCP Games *could* be in a world of hurt financially over this. 
---
This gets real complicated--assuming Brisc is not full of shit--when the decision to ban and then publicly announce the banning was the result of an NDA violation was made *without CCP even talking to Brisc* as part of their investigation. 
---
And ultimately, this is what bothers me most. I have played this game for 13 years and in the last couple months I have seen CCP ban two long time players without, if we believe what they say, bothering to consult with the people who CCP has banned, nor having been willing to do these long time customers the courtesy of informing them of the *exact* nature of the the EULA violation being CCP claims to be basing the ban on. 
---
Legally speaking, CCP is well within their rights to ban whomever they want, for whatever they want; however, from the point of view of a purchaser of their services, and knowing how much of my time, money, and social life is invested in their product, the idea that I could potentially be banned for something and not be given the opportunity to at least know why, or attempt to defend myself, strikes at my sense of justice.
---
Looks like Tails needs to lay off those injectors.
---
Ohh, gossip!
---
Take your time and get it right.
---
This is overall actually a pretty good look for the CSM. It only makes it look better, not worse. The report came from the rest of the CSM, which meant that they took their roles seriously enough to crack down on a fellow member who was violating his NDA. CCP then removed that person, leaving only the people who reported him on the CSM. This is the CSM working well, not the CSM fucking up.
---
I dont think either of us wants to know the truth about that. :-P
---
You must be real fun at parties... lol.  
---
They are just memes, my dude.
---
If you think unofficial lobbying doesn't exist in whatever country you live in, you don't understand humans.
---
That being said, lobbyists do suck, on average.
---
&gt; had he asked  "What would happen to X if CCP did Y?"  instead of "What are the problems with X?" 
---
Given CCP's comments about banning electronic devices at future summits and going over how NDA's work at those summits, this seems a pretty plausible series of events. But given his career he should have known better if that was what in fact happened.
---
The average person is really fucking stupid, and I'm saying that as a fairly average person
---
Of course there'll always be some variant or another, but I'd still say *legalizing* the practice is kind of fuckin' insane.
---
Please post when you can.
---
Funny, that's not what you said about gigx eh?
---
Lol no, it's fairly spot on. Extreme to make the point clearer, but a fairly direct comparison. Which part did you misunderstand? Perhaps I can help.
---
but then how did they afford to plex 6 accounts at 2b per account lol your logic is flawed
---
next you're gonna tell me plex wasn't always 2b per month LOL
---
ikr I keep telling him but he won't listen
---
Have never said gigx shouldn't be banned.
---
&gt; starting training on one character automatically pauses training on another
---
I'm ok with this, but make it randomized.
---
If I start training a new character, I want to browse through all of my accounts which one stopped, then start that and start the whole thing again.
---
I saw her Twitter-Account ... now I am scared as fuck
---
It was scheduled to be released in July but Brisc Rubal spoiled it to alliance members thus the whole release got delayed by a year.
---
&gt;Maybe they don't need a filter. All this "filtering" has seemed to only promote a minority of player opinions and not EvE as a whole.
---
They want a filter. We shouldnt assume CCP are in good faith trying to fix the game. T20 was just what they were "caught" for.
---
If CCP wanted to talk, they could come here and do so, but they dont. They have know where the community stands on things like injectors, but nothing gets done. Remember the 300 page injector feedback thread? I do, and I also remember CCP posting like 4 times, ignoring the "real" issues.
---
It strongly appears that CCP as a company is deceptive and dishonest as fuck.
---
Aryth obviously noticed suspicious insider trading happening before the GSM's designated normal insider trading was due to occur. Cant let some 5th ballot place candidate make all the dank profits. Brisc's crime wasn't the insider trading but the goon fucking.
---
Now we are talking!
---
At the begining the panic was because we were affraid that it was Bliss the #3 guy banned, it could fucked up the entire alliance. We really dont want to finish like CO2. When we knew it s Pando, we were sad for him of course because he is a good guy and a good fc but the most important INIT was safe.
---
He's not getting special treatment (such as an essay from CCP to tell him exactly why he was banned) for being on the CSM. We however are being informed of actions taken against a CSM member after he decided corruption is ideal. But do feel free to whine more about muh bans ;(
---
T20 is still a sore point for us old-timers, i still believe NC/PL are receiving insider information from current CCP™ employees in their alliance.  Remove CCP™ employees from high ranking alliances.
---
hmm, maybe they wanted to live up to that statement and Mittens/Aryth didn't like it ? thonking intensifies ...
---
Whereas I'm more of the opinion that criminalizing speech is kind of fuckin' insane. I can't believe I'm here defending lobbyists of all people, but there it is.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/ppne2z/brisc-rubal-removed-from-the-csm-13
---
"Brisc Rubal has been found to be sharing confidential information [...]"
---
"[...] and that the non-disclosure agreement is respected."
---
I cherry picked a couple lines out the article but (I personally believe) it's reasonable to assume that this is CCP claiming he violated his NDA. 
---
And again, according to Brisc, he hasn't received any info as to what he specifically did. This then becomes  CCP's word vs his word which is exactly what a libel suit was invented for. 
---
Even if he did actually violate the NDA there's still a (much smaller) chance he can get them for libel but it probably wouldn't be worth pursuing.
---
I take my memes like I take Eve... far more seriously than I should and probably to a point that it may someday have an adverse effect on my health.
---
No you don't seem to understand.  
---
CCP claims that he broke the NDA and that's why he is banned and expelled from the CSM.  
---
Now I am not sure how Icelandic law is (or wherever the NDA was signed), but if the mere accusation or the ingame sanction is something the legal system even perceives as a punishment, then if CCPs claims are false, he can sue them.  
---
However, if he wants to sue them and it turns out that either CCP can do what they want because the legal system doesn't acknowledge an ingame ban as a punishment or if CCPs accusations are right, then his ass is on fire big time.  
---
I am guessing that CCP wanted to be nice about this and just ban him and kick him from the CSM, but (and I am not quite sure about this), they could have sued Brisc becuase he broke the NDA which could have costed them large amount of money in one way or another.  
---
So if this clown sues CCP and it turns out that CCP is in the right, he can kiss his career goodbye and CCP will have finally enough money again to hire the community staff.
---
You are not good at debate.
---
Brisc was turned in by fellow CSM members. Its the Goons who wanted your alliance head shotted. So they can Widot you.
---
But yet we pay them not in USD but a different Currency. OR at least USD that gets converted and you get charged a conversion fee.
---
They haven't had business holdings in the US for a while.
---
The person I was responding to didn't provide an argument at all - what else would I respond with?
---
Keep irl and eve separate, nothing good can come of playing with irl friends.
---
Third? There was a second one?
---
When did the inside a station/citadel visuals change???
---
*Eyy, another year!* It's your **7th Cakeday** Drewinator! ^(hug)
---
and ..... it was just RL content
---
That is clearly a rabbit
---
I thought it was funny...
---
/r/SubredditDrama asks it's readers not to brigade threads linked there.
---
/r/Eve posts a image of the post instead of a link. OP knows we cant be trusted.
---
You don't tell cheats how you caught them. Just gives them more information on how to avoid it. Plus it could also open up the door to all kinds of bullshit armchair lawyering like all these threads on Reddit are doing. 
---
CCP feels like they have plenty of justification for doing what they did, so they made the call to do it. If someone wants to try to fight it in court, so be it. I ran across a few websites doing a brief search with most attorneys advising that software companies usually cover their asses in EULAs and unless you can prove that they knowingly published false information, you're SOL.
---
LOL, dzialania onu stron sa skoordynowane, a sam ban dla Briscka byl najprawdopodobniej planowany duzo wczrsniej. Brubal jest sztucznie stworzona postacia przez samo CCP. Roznica pomiedzy nim i dziesiatkami innych ccp sztucznych tworow jest taka ze jemu dano prawdziwa twarz. Ogolnie cala akcja nie warta wiekszej uwagi a Wy sie podniecacie jakbyscie dziewictwo wlasnie stracili.
---
Just come afk with us. Our telegram game is on point.
---
"impossible"
---
&gt; So essentially this trusted RL friend infiltrated my home
---
"set up" when you invited the guy over to your house. 
---
Are you sure grath telkin invited you?
---
Please train skill extracting and injecting
---
That was quite a roller coaster.
---
it shows the starmap of the constellation with the system labelled as the focal point
---
I'm going the George Carlin route.
---
Or simela.
---
Ooo I didn't see that that was stupid! But here's where it gets sticky. His saying he's a public figure doesn't mean he is legally.
---
&gt; Edit: obviously if you have proof I’m a rapist there isn’t much I can do. If CCP has proof there isn’t anything to be done.
---
That's the rub. They've made an public accusation with serious RL consequences. I can remember when they made the same accusation of that absolute moonbat Ankhesplat... fuck whatever her name was. She made a few noises about libel, but soon shut up and went away after CCP showed her the evidence.
---
If they have proof, they'd better be ready to demonstrate it. Not to r/eve but to a court.
---
i think keep irl and eve seperate should be pasted onto the column to the right.
---
I think ccp needs to stop giving skill injectors to this dog
---
Invited him over hundreds of time, and I've been to his place just as many. Infiltrated might not have been the best choice of words.
---
Well, color me mistaken.  I thought they still had a few non-eve interests over here.  Some research shows me mistaken.
---
Thanks for the correction.
---
Fail spy, suck it
---
gr8 b8 m8
---
I have information, that Dark sold a Molok to a guy from Snuff, and this Molok was confiscated by CCP. From the money Shines bought "normal" armor titans to bolster alliance numbers. It would be a total joke if CCP backs this ban with HAW-Patch, as this would show how much they NOT understand about the Meta. Other Option is that something is up on the timeline for Faction Titans that is not published yet.
---
is it comming with walking on stations?
---
Injectors bring revenue. If it's doing so consistently without too much backlash, they're going to keep doing it. They are still a company after all. Everything else comes after revenue
---
He was never your friend to begin with.
---
Sure, but it seems like he could arguably be described as a public figure anyway, and wouldn't his description of himself as a public figure hurt his case, at least?
---
&gt;he sent me nude dm's after founding out I was underage
---
I didn't know gallowboob had an alt.
---
Remind me nearer the time mate, WhatsApp me!
---
They literally require you to register for csm election with RL identity.
---
This has been asked and requested a lot. Won’t happen because the client is not setup to do it.
---
Like, how could this possibly happen?
---
After reading this, i think. nothing of value lost!
---
this is new
---
I'm inclined to believe that
---
Haha, alright then.
---
&gt;r/eve in flames
---
Sardines are really dumb. We're literally drinking from the fountain of drama right now.
---
That was 2 years ago. Since then they've made queues stop when omega lapses, so it's not impossible.
---
He's a lobbyist... You just don't get it. He could be caught red handed doing pretty much anything and he his career.
---
He's a lobbyist... NOT a politician. Second you don't get money from defending yourself in a lawsuit so wtf are you talking about?
---
Mostly agree. There's a small chance (probably not worth pursuing) that there's still a libel case due to the order of operations: 
---
He's informed he's terminated (he's not given any info), they make the dev blog post (he still has no info), he goes onto a public form and says he has no info and professes his innocence. Then CCP gives him the info after the fact where he's now (possibly) lied in public about not violating the NDA. 
---
Had CCP given him the info at the same time they terminated his accounts (assuming it happened before the dev blog) then he opens himself up to stuff by going and professing innocence (lying). I don't think he'd do that. He seems level headed enough to not stir the pot further if they actually presented him evidence of his hand in the cookie jar. 
---
Most likely no suit happens because everyone settles (regardless of his guilt).
---
Indeed. Looking forward to CSM statement later this week.
---
Actually you said the same, just much longer.
---
And they do not have to show their proof to us. Only to a court in some situation. And since it is an NDA, it will stay on the court.
---
And since CCP have a pretty fine law department, I am sure they wouldn't say that on public, if they have no proof for it.
---
Nah, I quit the game and RMT'd everything on the way out.
---
Look up legal ethics requirements for lawyers. We have to do cle on it every year in Texas at least. Most other states have the same requirements.
---
But most importantly, client confidentially is how the legal system works, otherwise no one would tell lawyers their legal troubles lest it be counted as a confession by subpoena-ing the attorney. 
---
The American legal system is well known for keeping client confidentiality secure; there are legendary lawyers who kept their mouth shut out of a professional obligation to a murder confession for which an innocent man was convicted. They helped him only when their former client released them for their obligation on his death bed.
---
That's how much the legal system expects you to hold on to your promise. Violating an nda is a demonstration of breaking promises. Obviously that doesn't comport well with the basic duty of American lawyers.
---
0_o
---
At the expense of killing the game, and the backlash is strong, but they ignore it, and are "protected" by the filter.
---
If the only concern is revenue, then pure p2w would be acceptable.
---
It's not his word vs their word. They have everything. This isn't some he said she said there is obviously proof. Chat logs, etc. They didn't just ban him because they where told he broke the NDA they know he did.
---
Wtf... Apply some common logic already.
---
you castrated your own alliance by being corrupt, thanks shines
---
Yea they said they have to rebuild the whole log in process to do it.  I personally think they are full of shit, .. They must have some wierd way to log in if they cant simply, make a button to change toons. I understand the implications of a quick alt changing system would in a way mean you can play three characters in one depending on how fast it is.
---
They're the same in my book. His ilk are one of the contributing factors of why American politics is so fucked up.
---
Maybe, or maybe some members saw it as an opportunity to rid themselves of someone they saw as a threat. Init has been fast becoming an entity that can rival some of the larger entities in Eve, and maybe this makes some people uncomfortable. Who knows, this is Eve. 
---
My comment wasn't aimed at how benevolent the CSM acted in this particular instance. It was more or less pointing out the return on investment for this experiment in allowing a council elected by the playerbase to affect game design decisions. Has it provided CCP with a valuable asset in trying to understand how the game has evolved and the changes necessary to continue to make Eve a game people will log in to play, or has it provided an avenue for insinuation an exploitation for groups that can manipulate the system?  There's always been an argument for the latter, and when incidents like this come up it only further reinforces the idea. How many times has this position been abused and not been found out? It doesn't speak well for the concept itself and people like Brisc and his mouthpieces only drag it further through the mud.
---
Will never happen, legacy code &amp; zero _actual_ business need
---
So you spying and betraying, even if it is "only" ingame is okay, but if someone does it to you, it's  sociopathic and legitimately.  
---
There is a saying, don't do to other, what you wouldn't like other do to you!
---
If you spy, be prepeared to be spied, if you backstab someone, be prepeared to find a knive or to in your back also.
---
And yes eve brings evil out of everyone, - ohh and it's real, it's damn real!
---
Train hard into the thanny my boy. Use hyperspatials to move faster and 4 fed navy dda in the lows.
---
True.  In this case though, I'm betting that Brisc took some video/audio, and shared it.  Then it got leaked to another CSM member and they took it to CCP.
---
the only change that would bring is that goons would have 2 null representatives, 1 highsec representative, 1 lowesec representative, 1 WH representative and one industry representative. TEST, NC/PL and Horde would have 1 null representative. Steve would be a highsec or industry representative.

You have to ask?

Moral of the story is:  if you really care about keeping a secret, don't tell *anyone*.
---
Again, they're a company. While some of the employees are passionate about the game, they answer to those whose only concern is in making money off of a product. 
---

This is fine. *sip*
---
[Is the CSM's time up?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)
---
No one's criminalized speech. They criminalize *corruption*. Lobbying is just formalized, legalized bribery and gives vastly disproportionate political ears given to those who benefit the most from fucking over the rest of us to begin with.
---
Not debating the ethics of spying. This happened three years ago so just simply sharing a story
---
I would have no problems playing with any of my RL friends, they're not scumbags, and I know where they live.

I could be wrong here,but if im not mistaken Netherworld skin series was a reward for attending Amsterdam in NETHERlands, its also orange which is Dutch national color

C-J6MT could be perhaps the homage to russian players based on that youtube video by Andrew Groen
---
TODD HOWARD YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN
---
Absolutely it could hurt his case! 
---
That's why I said that was a stupid thing to say. On the other hand Michael Jackson had himself proclaimed himself the "King of Pop" when all of his music was basically R&amp;B and Bruce Jenner says he's a woman so....
---
Sound to me that your operational security could use some work, only you and your handler should know that your a spy. $0.02
---
seems likely i was thinking it was something along the lines of where it will be a potential invasion point for the triglavians with the skins being "camo" so to speak with the space around it. But as said in the comments ccp posted yesterday showing these off on their instagram as being for russia attendees so more likely was just an accident they left it in meant to commemorate those players
---
Trust is biggest liability of all.
---
I have a feeling people who enjoy being an asshole in game are also assholes IRL, so obviously they have asshole friends.
---
Not about libel, but on the breach of contract CCP's position would be weakened if publicly they gave another reason for the ban?
---
Even so there are actually 2 separate discussions here:
---
* the ban which is covered under the eula;
---
* the termination of the csm contract due to breach of nda.
---
The fact that he is making this so much about the opaque banning process and not the breach of NDA is very telling to me.
---
That's true for the vast majority of RL friend I have that play EVE
---
Memes over substance, the absolute state of eve reddit.
---
He should've taken the deal they gave The Judge
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
There’s no fucking witch hunt here. There’s people believing Brisc because he says he’s innocent and there’s people believing CCP because they said he did it. The only difference is that CCP also has nothing to gain from making shit up while Brisc has every reason to be dishonest.
---
Logic is a *crucial* component to critical thinking and logic tells you that if you’re going to distrust a statement you should distrust the person who has the most to gain by being dishonest.
---
Side note: You should learn what actually happened in Salem by the way.

This was so confusing for Godbless. I got purged because Cythrex was my vouch. Luckily daddy Penif's heart was extra brown and brought me back to ISRAD the next day.

Honestly Olmeca, if you put half the effort you do into "burning Delve" into campaigning, you could probably get yourself elected to the csm. Admittedly a terifying prospect.
---
Oh, well obviously bribery and corruption of that sort are illegal in the US as well. So really there's no difference, you guys have just banned the name.
---
You stopped being friends with someone over a video game. You're worse than your friend and even weirder than he is. And no, I wouldn't care that he took photos of the computer. That's actually pretty funny. You're by far the bigger bad guy in all of this, and far more unhinged than your buddy who seems chill and kind of funny.
---
Stop abusing our Lords name, heathen!
---
That makes literally 0 sense. There is a huge range of issues that will be brought before a Congress-person during their term. Many of these pieces of legislation, the representative will have 0 knowledge of the subject. A majority will never come up on a campaign trail to know how your representative will vote. 
---
Say you are a pharmacist and someone proposes legislation that would effect your career, such at not allowing you to administer vaccines; a practice you've done for years under the law. This is not something someone would campaign on, so in your scenario, how are your interests represented? 
---
You can call/email them with little issue, which basically results in a tally mark by a staff member at best case. If it's a state representative, they could be hours drive away. Many people live paycheck to paycheck and can't do an 6 hour drive during the weekday to meet with a representative. There are pharmacy association to join which either have people local to said representative or pay someone to represent the groups interest. They can meet with the representative and present the thoughts/opinions and how it would effect constituents. It should be a piece of the reasoning someone determines how to vote. This is a process that happened not too long ago in my state.
---
Lord help us for we have strayed further from the light.

Except that kodiz guy man hes a shitlord

I welcome your downvotes. :joy:

&gt; And they do not have to show their proof to us.
---
&gt;&gt;they can order that it not be made public.  
---
I covered that.   
---
&gt;I am sure they wouldn't say that on public  
---
Except they did publicly announce the ban.

https://www.eveonline.com/article/ppne2z/brisc-rubal-removed-from-the-csm-13?origin=launcher   
---
&gt;Dear Citizens of New Eden, 
---
&gt;It is with great disappointment that I bring you the following news. Brisc Rubal has been found to be sharing confidential information with a member of his alliance that was later used by another alliance member to conduct illicit in-game transactions. As a result, the following actions have been taken:      
---
So, their legal team is stupid. They would have been better off just doing the ban and shutting up. Then they never have to produce anything in court.     
---
Now, if they really do have proof. It is not that bad for them. Go to court. Show evidence. Evidence gets sealed and the case is dismissed.     
---
It is a hassle, one they could have avoided by shutting the fuck up, but not a disaster.   
---
If on the other hand they for some reason can not produce sufficient proof to convince a judge that a breach did in fact occur  ....   
---
Well, now they have some shit to eat. They will be nailed on Libel. They will be responsible for damages. (How much is debatable).  
---
The big issue is that if that happens he will be able to state that a court found no evidence of the breach. This will make them look really bad and be a PR nightmare.     
---
There was no reason for them to do it the way they did. Unless of course they want it to go to court.
---
Must be a truly lovely life to live when you are simple enough to fall for the test spin.
---
&gt;Again, they're a company. While some of the employees are passionate about the game, they answer to those whose only concern is in making money off of a product. 
---
The idea must be to align your product with the interests of your customers. They are now hostile to us.
---
If what you are saying is true, the CSM was always a sham. They should have no problem coming out and saying that.
---
&gt;Pretty simple math. Hate to say it, but it's true
---
I think that statement is wrong. Profit from injectors is dependent on subscriptions, so if it is true now, it may not be soon.
---
It becomes interesting to apply that expression to wardecs and all the thousands of players who quit for 15 years until they recently changed it. Who gives a fuck about player retention when its profit you are after? No relation there, right?
---
... yeah, no. If you don't see how the practice in the US is bribery and corruption, I can't help you.
---
I'll admit, I had to read that a couple of times before I got the joke. Good one.
---
On one hand, it must be nice not having to think for yourself, but on the other hand, that means you constantly think you're somehow the underdog.
---
Ok
---
How so?
---
"Infiltrated my home" good lord you're overdramatic
---
Dont trust this guy OP, you can farm in safety in *our* wormhole.

The second releases this year (i think june), and it runs from 2011 to 2016 iirc.

PGL is just looking for a narrative people will eat up doesn’t matter if it’s true or not. Easier to get people rallied up against the ‘dirty cheaters’ for the us vs them.
---
This is a tie
---
Ya was about to ask the same thing. Who is pathfinders?
---
How many friends do people have which they do not trust? If you do not trust them, are they still friends?
---
Business secrets are always sealed.

I am pretty sure the contract is subject to the court in Reykyavik so would hve to check whats the potential for libel there

Please let me know where you found such a cheap bulk supplier of tin foil

it's a game lmfao
---
large scale eve 2019 is a war of titans and rorquals
---
Winning is not playing the game but just browsing forums about the game.
---
If they would not be able to produce the proof, they wouldn't kick him from CSM, and write a devblog about it, which they would be suable. They are not that idiots. So there is no shit to eat. Especially since nobody gone to the court. And if they right, they should be able to go to there too to sue Brisc
---
And how does a lobbyist who is bias on a topic, is not elected and not held responsible by the represented group help that group?
---
Complicated issue comes up.
---
Without lobbying : Either they get it right or wrong and they face backlash if they screw up someone's life. The next guy is elected on a platform to fix the issue. 
---
With lobbying :
---
Lobby A: Do it because reasons.
---
Lobby B: Don't do it because reasons.
---
(+money for some reason) 
---
Either they get it right or wrong and they face backlash if they screw up someone's life. The next guy is elected on a platform to fix the issue.
---
it's a video game, they could kick the whole CSM tomorrow for no reason at all if they feel like it.
---
Frat Belt and Roaded everything between Cobalt Edge, Geminate, and Detroid for like a year and people are suddenly confused how they acquired a large fleet?

Right? Gotta watch your valuables at Kodiz house

kill yourself faggot (in game ofc)
---
I just updated my windows last week to 64-bit in anticipation. Come on August! I’m ready
---
CCP time passes in glacial pace.
---
&gt;Maybe they don't need a filter
---
They definitely need a filter. There are lots of ideas shown to the CSM that would be SUICIDE to post anywhere publicly, either because they're so OP, or screw over a whole section of the game, or just so cool people would be pissed if they didn't come to fruition.
---
You can't just go up to random players and say "Yooo what if we add a new race of Earth-sent scouts to the game and also you can now spawn characters as having pirate bios, with pirate corvettes on up?" People would be pissed if that didn't come to light, even if it was only a "what if" idea.
---
Just for clarification, that's not an actual thing, just an example.
---
That's what I like, good for looting on gates.
---
I once roleplayed a thief in a game and got thrown in jail in real life.
---
PGL is one of the few  to be able to beat him out on that
---

It seems within the realm of possibility that he didn't actually exploit the information himself, but that he gave the information to the other two who did exploit it.  He can still get fucked though, breaking an NDA so that others can use the information is only slightly better than using the information yourself.

Yeah this is pretty much the weirdest thing to happen to me in EvE. 
---
What was also strange is that Flying Condor did not reveal to me who the spy was in my corp and i had a feeling he was also trying to mess with me. I started aggressively looking for your spy toon and I found you the following day because you had a YouTube video which contained in game footage of you, clearly showed you were in PL but your YouTube account name was the same name as your main you claimed to be you, which was the basis of getting back invited into my corp.
---
I took it personally that you had abused that privilage to spy on us and i just wanted to mess with you a little bit and get you into a little bit of trouble. It did not feel good when you were kicked as that definetly was not my intent. If we ever meet i'll buy you a beer and i hope life wasn't too shitty following this. Backstabbing IRL friends is the shittiest thing someone can do in this game.

You can create another Alpha on a separate account. A few even, if you decide there are different activities you want to create a character focused training queue for.
---
Get a tool called [EveMon](https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon/releases/tag/4.0.11)
---
use it to build a skill queue and follow it.
---
you can create a skill queue in EveMon from an imported fitting. so find a fitting capable of running the Abyssals you want to run (sorry i'm no help here) and import that.
---
It can be a possibility yes. But i think it will come more from killabee side.

Agreed.

Easier to just shut the fuck up though.

They have the right to ban. They ban. Then shut up. It would have been the safest and cheapest way to go.

Oh man I remember this really well, reasonably sure that bait Aeon was mine.  Everyone in the fishing crew was super confused trying to figure out what happened and where the leak was, because honestly nothing made sense because you had stepped up before and this entire plan was yours, so it made really no sense to sabotage your own op.  At the end what tipped it out of your favor was because you came in from RKK, who took your app without a vouch lol
---
Glad to hear you endured it and are still kicking around.  EVE is a wild place!
---
There's no comparison, gobbins takes the win.
---
I saw the same thing back in February and made a bug ticket for it.
---
PGL, "hold my sippy juice".
---
Realistically you can make a new clone and apply what you've learned and still have a 5mil sp alt which wouldn't be a bad thing.
---
Otherwise it's time to figure out how to afford Plex. You're not going to get much further without it.
---
If I were you I would just make a new character. If you're happy to be doing what you're doing, don't let me stand in your way.
---
You're mistaking me saying pgl is just as big a retard with saying gobbins isn't a mouth breather.
---
I remember this whole investigation and the back and forth. Sorry you had to go through that. It was a shitty situation from our side.
---
FIX IT
---
YOU WERE STUPID
---
No but u you talk in stations
---
Yeah not at all defending my actions as spy with this post. Just sharing a bizarre story with the community years after the dust settled. Definitely would take you up on that for me. Moving to Korea in 3 weeks, looking forward to the first Pearl Abyss sponsored fan fest in Seoul ;)
---
Gobbins isn't comparing the same thing. Frat bot, the counter to which would be Test bot. Test cannot be held accountable for their renters actions just as nobody accused people renting from Frat of botting.
---
Can you short sell plex?
---
The had this feature until 2006/2007 area. It was removed due to Caching issues, basically it could cause people to appear that were not there.

With unspecialized characters, dedicated buyers usually calculate it based on injector prices. Usually the last 5m sp is unaccounted for. With specialized characters that dedicated skill famers don't usually go for, people who have a purpose for it will be much willing to pay higher prices for them. 
---
While that's speaking from the perspective of a buyer, as a seller, you'd want to calculate your injector + PLEX transfer price to make sure it's worth it for you to sell. If you are unable to sell for the price you want, you may want to consider extracting. Make sure that when you extract the last 5m sp you leave the character with is focused towards something, so someone may actually want to buy it.

I don't think he wants money, he just wants to either clear his name, or find out what the hell he supposedly did.
---
Reminds me of when Goons declared war on White Noise because they "ran and operated an RMT cartel" 
---
Though to be fair to PGL, TAPI narratives are always gutwrenchingly terrible.  I don't think he realizes that people will follow him and Vily without a narrative, to have fun, occasionally fail, and eat hot wings.

Believe it not plenty of eve peeps are good peeps in RL when you can seperate the game from the real world yah doing alright. There have been plenty of people ive clacked heads with  in game but had a good laugh with in rl.

Gibbons still sane as ever I see.
---
Except we have plenty of examples of CCP dropping the banhammer too soon and reversing the decision. To just assume anything right now and say "durr hurr logic!" to back it up is absurd.

I think you can use the refer a friend system and create a 2nd account and get the new triple bonus SP. So that should help in getting a fresh start.

I dont think Brisc has done something worse then Manny. I think its morelikely that CCP tries to enforce their rules way stricter in the past time and people who would just get a clap on their hand before now get permabans very fast. Still this whole story is currently very onesided and I do hope there will be a bit more clarification on what was going on.
---
Well, there’s kind of a difference between having someone actually watching your screen with you, and just meeting them every now and then for beers.
---
I even know the OP IRL as well, and he’s pretty chill. Hasn’t backstabbed me yet that I know of! (He’s kind of a dork though.)
---
FRT was kinda known for its promotion of titan ownership and handholding new titan pilots while they built their replacement 2nd/3rd titan. but no such love for supercarriers fo some reason.
---
I mean according to CCP test can in fact be held responsible for their renters botting.
---
It’s harder to multibox supers.

The man that was spying get spied more in return! Good story.

So let me get this straight. You're a dbag, and your friend did the right thing and told your victims?

Fuck off kid. You're the sociopath

This isn't your average every day ban. They released a fucking news article about it. They clearly are not taking this very lightly. Almost like they know what they are doing.
---
Seriously, like I said apply some logic here. Bunch of brainless drama queens and armchair lawyers here today...
---
Thank you for proving my point that mob justice still exists today in humans. 1600's, 1300's changes nothing in the mentality of a group of humans today.
---
Innocent &lt;---- until PROVEN guilty. You claim logic is crucial component.... yet you also pass judgements on individuals without a single shred of evidence made public.... except the word of an accuser.
---
It is not Brisk Rubal's job to prove himself innocent. It is CCP's job to PROVE he is guilty. Spreading libel information.... without giving the accused a chance to even see the evidence or defend themselves publicly.... then making such libel content public for the world to see.... is the very reason why we have libel laws in more 1st world nations. Something Iceland takes very seriously.

I've meant to get into Eve for the past few years but never had the time for video games. With graduation coming up I want to find some new hobbies and Eve is my first choice. Right now I've got a job lined up in data analytics. Realistically how much data could one take in for Eve? That's what I find exciting.

Titan guns and doomsdays work a lot better in bigly blob fest than super fighters, since there's 0 travel time, burst DPS to clear enemy caps instantly, and same or higher DPS.

The first part of the statement was purely hypothetical. It was to make the point that the reasoning behind turning in another member may be something other than the benevolent nature and concern for the game they tried to suggest. With people it usually is more self-serving more than anything

Total psycho. He knew how much you’d invested in it, and how much it would hurt you to do what he did. Clearly it had a large impact on your happiness for a while. He had no stake in the matter in-game, he literally just got off on seeing you upset. That’s definitely not a friend, probably this was a relatively cheap way to figure out you needed to cut him from your life.

Being a "Public figure" does not mean you can't sue for defamation. It only means you are subject to criticism, satire and even ridicule. If someone makes a false claim against you, like you stole money, you can definitely sue and win for defamation. Take a look at Jesse Ventura vs. Chris Kyle.

That isn't how government works. Very seldom are laws passed and changed the next session lol.

Idk, Paradox games did this with Europa Universalis 4 because of a similar issue. You couldn't return to the main menu without fully exiting the game because spaghetti, so their solution was exactly that: the "Exit to Menu" button closes the and relaunches the entire game. It's actually annoying as fuck, but EU4 takes way longer to load than EVE so idk.
---
I agree, it happens. Labeling the entirety of the lobbying industry as bribery and corruption is a bit harsh, but it certainly happens. Of course the same thing happens in your country as well, so it seems the only difference is you claim to have outlawed the name lobbying.

As a test member, this is correct and I agree 100%.

There is also precedent that CSM members have been banned before and CCP has publicly announced it.

Obviously Brisc just needs to no u CCP then he'll get his accounts back.

&gt;s to 
---
This is a situational argument at best. Certainly you do not tell an RMTer, "we identified \*this\* transaction, using \*this\* tool as RMT." What you say is, "we identified your transfer of 10 billion isk on April 1st as an RMT transaction, this is a violation of the End User License Agreement..." then you cite the end user license agreement.   
---
Trust me when I say, there is a way to tell someone \*why\* they were banned without giving them any information that will help them cheat in the future. 
---
**Incidentally,** this only applies to RMT issues. It does not apply to other types of cheats that involve the use of game mechanics to duplicate items, circumvent concord, etc. ***And it certainly*** does not apply to Brisc's case, where there banning offense is "you violated the NDA." In fact, I would say that this is doubly the case under these circumstances, when CCP's accusation is that Brisc is in breach of contract. 
---
Just the presence of a NDA and CCP's public claim he violated it almost *necessitates* CCP has a legal obligation to disclose to Brisc the exact nature of the asserted contract violation. And here is where the law gets kind of cute. Had CCP banned him for "ethical concerns" or "inappropriate conduct" and had not, literally created a news story on dozens of gaming news outlets that Brisc, the American politician, is being banned for violating a signed NDA, they would have been on better legal ground to not disclose.
---
Imagine if you were dating/banging said individual and then were betrayed...

You’re right sorry. I should have said test leadership.

more blatant racism from PGL... tisk tisk.
---
It's an NDA on a unpaid project and CCP isn't gonna follow this up with a damages lawsuit, so if he ignores it and gives up internet spaceships well that's kinda it. 
---
Like it's a none story for anybody that doesn't play eve and given his denial and CCP's inability to present evidence ( without violating customer privacy ), it's really not gonna have all that much of a massive impact on his Real life. 
---
Specially compared to the cost of hiring lawyers and going into a lengthy legal fight with a multi national compensation that is at best gonna result in them posting a public apology on a dev blog.

You're acting like he's a special snowflake. If anyone else broke the NDA, they would have cut and pasted their name instead of Brisc. He's the idiot for linking his real life and his account for attention. If he never took that leap, this would be a nonissue. Just because he put enough information out there that literally anyone can put two and two together isn't CCPs fault.
---
You really need to understand the difference between game infractions and real life breach of contract. They are extremely different and no amount of italics and boldings will change that lmfao.

What the FUCK are you talking about?
---
&gt; Thank you for proving my point that mob justice still exists today in humans.
---
Are you the kind of person that thinks that people who think convicted criminals are guilty enforcing mob justice?
---
&gt; Innocent &lt;---- until PROVEN guilty. 
---
He was banned. That’s being found guilty. What you or I or anyone else thinks is totally irrelevant. :thinking:
---
&gt; except the word of an accuser.
---
Yeah there’s no “accusation” here. It’s an explanation of why punitive action has been taken.
---
&gt; It is not Brisk Rubal's job to prove himself innocent. 
---
It’s not CCPs job to prove to you that he’s guilty either. You aren’t a jury in a criminal trial. Actually there’s no actual crime here. Violating NDAs is breach of contract, so civil case at best where totally different rules apply.
---
&gt; Spreading libel information.... 
---
It’s your job, by your logic, to prove libel. Not the other way around. :thinking: or are you just going to go with mob justice and guilty until proven innocent?
---
&gt; is the very reason why we have libel laws in most 1st world nations. Something Iceland takes very seriously.
---
Yeah none of what you said is accurate except that Iceland takes defamation very seriously. Which, again, suggests that Brisc is lying and that CCP, who again has nothing to gain by lying, libeling, or removing Brisc from the CSM, is telling the truth.
---
So if you’re going to make the claim that CCP committed an actual violation of law, then habeus fucking corpus my man.
---
Esp when it's one of the only balance features they've done in a year, you'd think they could at least get this right.  CCP :hold my beer: moment yet again

Come on we all know it’s not even google - it’s /r/legaladvice
---
Seeing him hurt? Or to do the right thing not to see others hurt? 
---
Like I said when you're a bully and your friend stops you from kicking a kid, he's not the problem. You are
---
Come on I use /r/legaladvice.  Don’t insult me
---
Plus it's not like you need to see the ship to use a station. As long as the menus are visible it could be all text for all I care.
---
Why are you so angry?
---
I mean, he proved himself untrustworthy the second he made it known he is a lobbyist.  Literally the most untrustworthy profession on the planet.  At least common criminals generally admit they're criminals.
---
I know a lot, but I'm pretty shit at it!
---
That's what new line members are for.
---
I INVOKE TEXAS LAW!!!
---
Imagine just playing the game because it's fun and not because you're saving the universe from the evil du jour
---
Oh man I saw PGL said go fuck yourself dude in the end.AHAHA
---
&gt; You don't fix non-critical issues the day before a patch.
---
Delay the patch then.
---
Ok so what am I looking at here? Didn't Lumpy dissolve a few months ago?
---
Why not automatically store unused skill points as a skill injection package? If the account doesn't have anything in training, add unallocated skillpoints saved up until training starts on a character. When training starts, log the time of no training and deliver the package?
---
One of the requirements to run for CSM is releasing your real name. Granted, he chose to make his profession a cornerstone of his campaign, but its also fair to say that it probably would have come up one way or another, even if he didn't volunteer the information himself.
---
I think it's more along the lines of being responsible for the shit you say online.
---
You are a fucking mong if you equate someone baiting internet spaceships with *bullying*. It's like saying sacrificing a pawn in chess is bullying because it let me take a rook or something. Try not to be *quite* such a retard?
---
Aww is the widdle dino upset that I insulted daddy piggles?
---
Reeee
---
Awww did I trigger the awoxer?
---
I know what I'm doing, I prestiged on Phoenix Wright
---
Awoxing is killing friendlies, matey. A bit of a non-sequiteur, or just further retardation?
---
EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.
---
Or even worse, clicking People and Places every time I want to open the fitting window because they're both just circles.
---
tbh that would actually be pretty cool, at least as an option
---
whaaaaaaaat? who could that be? :)))

What do you think a spy is? Someone pretending to be a friendly.....

You dropped this, friend.
---
Keep playing with the current clone but make a new one on the same account and train that one. Make ISK while the new clone trains.
---
What you want to do is train into a Gila so just do the minimum you need on Caldari and Gallente frigs and destroyers to get to the cruisers then get both to IV. Max out the light missile skills and rapid lights and max out drone skills and medium drones.
---
There are a few other things to do too, spaceship command IV, max out your shields, add some relevant targeting and navigation, max out CPU and powergrid.....
---
By the time you hit the 5 mill cap you can fly a Gila that can do T3 Abyssals and it'll be something like this

Again, all the armchair lawyering going on in these threads means exactly dick. You can't say nor can anyone else here what should or shouldn't happen. The courts can decide it if Brisc wants to take this that route. Anything else being said is just opinion, plain and simple. 
---
My opinion is that I don't think he has the justification to do anything and all the shit being talked is just that, shit being talked. Regardless of what happens legally, his ass isn't getting unbanned. Worst case is they are forced to recant their statement and may have some small financial liability, but I doubt it.
---
Let’s just say it as it is !!! Lexy is a dick !
---
In my professional opinion as an amateur legal expert, that dude that got kicked and is throwing a temper tantrum about it is acting like a fucking clown. It's hilarious. Don't try to shut it down. It just gets funnier and funnier from here.
---
I dunno, its pretty gneiss for me
---
Which is very distinct from awoxing. It's the difference between infiltration and betrayal. Are you really this simple?
---
In my mental image of it, /r/Eve is pretty much always on fire. Like a burning pile of discarded car tires, or the coal seam under Centralia, Pennsylvania. Things like the Drisc incident are just equivalent to someone tossing a can of hairspray or lighter fluid into the flames.

I'm just going to assume the person I like is in the right and that the law reflects my opinion, whats so unreasonable?

Perhaps, but I know plenty of game developers that get along just fine without it and don't have to deal with bullshit. Just saying
---
No, not at all :) Just putting some limits on analogies.
---
Like I said. Triggered the awoxer
---
Do avocado birds in Texas shit out guacamole?  Because based on how nasty Tex-Mex is I have suspected for quite some time that a bird’s anus was involved somehow.

well atlest you get the truth from fox. if i turn on fox news i know what im gonna get. if i turn on cnn and msbc idk what ill get, maybe fake news about another so called hate crime, or russia this and russia that. just to point out im not fan of trump OR the clinton. but i have my own mind i would take propaganda over fake news all day long.
---
Oh im not denying that at all they are entirely taking the easy way out my shouting spaghetti code lol

Ticks arent that great too for them I hear
---
Responsible, sure.
---
I'm just commenting on the fact that "because someone says 'i'm a public figure' therefore, they are legally classified as a public figure" is a dumb argument.
---
" who think convicted criminals are guilty enforcing mob justice? "
---
I wasn't aware Rubal was taken to a criminal court..... I also was not aware that CCP is considered a public court in Iceland? I guess CCP goes far beyond just a simple private company.... now they are the official police force of Iceland itself?
---
" He was banned. That’s being found guilty.  "
---
See my above point.... I wasn't aware a private company had the power to .... proclaim someone as guilty and then publicly shame said individual? Does Iceland relegate legislative actions to CCP now?
---
" Yeah there’s no “accusation” here. "
---
Yes.... there is.... Then the publicly shamed said individual without allowing them a chance to defend themselves. This is publicly attacking his character, which could cause damages in his personal life.
---
" It’s not CCPs job to prove to you that he’s guilty either.  "
---
When you spread libel.... it is. Publicly shaming / attacking an individual... is the very definition of libel if you can not back up your written claims.
---
" It’s your job, by your logic, to prove libel. "
---
Hence why I hope Brisk Rubal takes CCP to court. Iceland takes accusations of libel seriously. CCP will be forced to back up their claims publicly.
---
Fucking Endie stealing my glory.  I lost an Aeon at some point
---
&gt;  I don't think he realizes that people will follow him and Vily without a narrative, to have fun, occasionally fail, and eat hot wings. 
---
pretty easy
---
1) we are big strong heroes who won a war against skill hk frat tri etc and it was pretty easy and free, we're fucking awesome
---
2) they bot and cc warrior so they have infinite stuff and we don't have infinite stuff so it's going to be hard to fight unlimited titans 
---
this all coalesces to: its going to be a hard fight because they have unlimited titans but we have actual skill and knowledge so we can pull through. 
---
full disclosure I'm just a wormholer who can read, I have no dog in this fight
---
And now I can’t get the visualization of a bird... SHITTING GUACAMOLE!!!  Thanks asshole
---
SovCits never limit themselves to just one word.

Lol that pastebin makes Gobbins looks much worse than me
---
&gt; we have actual skill and knowledge

But it's TEST, though.

NO COLLUSION!   TOTALLY EXONERATED!!!

Wouldnt really know, i kinda flew a regular carrier on SISI to get a feel for it but subcap stuff, especially covert ops, is my thing and passion

Hmm, maybe there was an old mission Armageddon model used here whose id number is now colliding with a newer NPC Marshal.

EBR-174558 ugh sorry submitted this before seeing your reply.
---
Yeah I'm not just making this up, I have an alt in Test (not Dreddit, maybe Dreddit is different) and people are just mondo excited to fly in a PGL or Vily fleet regardless of the outcome.  
---
The whole narrative building ("we're the Rebels fighting off the bad guys!") was the downfall (at least partially) of Test 1.0.  This is TAPI 3.1, people don't need to feel like they're fighting some great injustice to fleet up and have fun.
---
&gt;  The accusation from Test is Frat don't police people within their own alliance
---
Other than the numerous times Fraternity has literally awoxed and then booted people from the alliance for botting???
---
i watched a show about lawyers once, i think that makes me 10x more qualified than anyone in the world, please bow down to me simple citizens, for i AM the law.

No worries!  I didn’t inspect very closely and if there are problems then your bug report is just the way to get them resolved.  Thank you!

If the flag has gold fringe on the outside, it’s a maritime flag and therefore this court is ILLEGAL!!

It’s not “asshole,” it’s “bitch,” you mis-gendering GameStop jackass, you!

Wow some people take this game to the extreme. You're mate Flying condor is a massive dick.  I would of personally chinned the cunt for taking things way to far.
---
Can we pay the art team to just keep this model instead? Geddon is cool, but Marshall is peak Mass Effect.
---
Yea, statutory rape should be a crime!
---
   
---
I am sorry to hear that a player who is so committed to all players in so many different ways Areas that really need a lot of time, so its time from the RL life, wasted on the community. That one such puts it on stake. He should be given the opportunity to defend himself and his previous investments should play a role, because this shows his character that he shows. I hope it develops for the better and to educate. If he's guilty, it's still sad, but those who play poker can fall too low.  Good luck and may justice prevail.
---
I'm just going to sticky this one for a little bit. The fever pitch legal ramblings are just... bad.
---
Occasionally you’ll find a t3c wreck or something, which can drop a couple mil in salvage, and it costs like nothing to just have a offline salvager.
---
You have to have some actual character to assassinate, though
---
Looks like time to batphone Goons on that narrative now too!!
---
Europe isn't a race, retard
---
A fair bit if you use it for trading or production lines. 
---
Production can get complicated though it will take a while to accumulate the capital needed to do it at huge scale. When you get there though I’ve seen some capital ship producer spreadsheets and the stuff they track and the quantity of materials is incredible. 
---
I don’t do much trading but one of the richer people in the game is a guy who has a bunch of characters spread out at trade hubs and abuses trends and pricing between hubs or even within them.
---
A while ago.
---
something not being true is the least of the concerns once you wanna morale post. Some might say it's even required, otherwise there would be no need for morale posting in the first place
---
Listen here you tampon chewing monthly raging demented feminazi.... women can be assholes too ok? 
---
You got a snap doh??
---
&gt;well atlest you get the truth from fox.
---
&gt; but i have my own mind i would take propaganda over fake news all day long.
---
truth != propaganda;
---
That's what will happen regardless of what they or their bosses knew or dreamed it will happen.
---
So that's a yes, you really don't understand the difference between the two?
---
I believe neither INIT FCs know officially from CCP.
---
But Brisc definitely does, as they would have to send him an official termination due to NDA breach, and he cannot reveal the reason because it is probably illegal to do so.
---
I'm the first one advocating for the end of the all-powerful game company terminating your account on their term. You should have the possibility to fight it in court and sue for damage in case of wrongful termination (which you actually can in some places).
---
As for the statement before they can discuss with CCP, I would agree with you, as long as the ban is done before warning them. CCP probably released their statement to prevent a shitstorm of tinfoil warriors saying CCP is anti-goon/init/goatfuckers2000.
---
I feel personally attacked *and* don't even have a response to that beyond "no u".
---
Well i definitely can’t argue that, touché good sir/ma’am
---
Best r/eve post of the year so far.
---
This is the most Eve story I think I've ever heard.
---
One the one I feel bad for you because obviously it sucks to be betrayed like that...
---
On the other hand I want to give mad props to your sociopathic friend for fitting into our world so well. Yes he's an asshole but *DAMN* did he play you. This is prime Eve Online right here
---
The way the game mechanics support this kind of anti-social behavior and the way the community encourage it has a fair amount to do with why I quit eve.
---
Various parts of identity and relationship management which mitigate antisocial behavior are absent in eve, and it tips the balance in a direction that I find distinctly un-fun.
---
I do?
---
Rings a bit hollow coming from Corporal Narrative tbh LOL
---
&gt;Likely the only reason we haven't seen proof of Brisc violating the NDA is that it concerns changes yet-to-be-seen
---
It says right in the devblog:
---
"...All the illicit assets and ISK gained from this incident have been confiscated..."
---
ISK already being gained makes it unlikely to be related to future changes, since there'd yet be no change in the market for an unannounced change.
---
he's a bad rules lawyer and thought that recording somethign and showing it to someone else wasn't a violation of the NDA
---
One issue that you neglect is that, at no point so far as I know, did the CCP team mention any personal information of Brisc Rubal. He took it upon himself to campaign using his real life status and name, pushing himself into the limelight aggressively.
---
CCP condemned the player Brisc Rubal for his actions, but not the individual behind the player. Furthermore, the move by Brisc Rubal to link his real identity to an online persona through many online posts, comments and platforms, results in that information becoming part of the public domain. You can not expect privacy to apply to information that you repeatedly publish by yourself on an open platform, whilst encouraging others to make that connection.
---
While CCP makes many mistakes, they do not fuck around with legality of things like these. We will not see proof publicly as that will create a business problem in that it impedes operations if all that NDA information that was abused, leaks. As the privacy aspect was effectively killed by Brisc, and that CCP is under British(?) jurisdiction, only males this case weaker for him.
---
Brisc doesn't matter, never has, never will.
---
He’s no one special.  
---
It doesn’t matter
---
We’re just as entertained as you are. 
---
In all fairness he deflected all the shit eating that legacy did over the weekend quite nicely.  Somewhat appreciative of that.
---
All jokes aside: thank you.  The misinformation going on is not good for anyone.
---
Yeah they can get a bit overzealous sometimes. I mean there's certainly drama but we're all collectively enjoying it here. Nothing is burning but Brisc Rubal's ears
---
In very specific scenarios where the truthfulness of a statement is questionable, a statement by someone stating it as “true” makes it *very* difficult for that same person to legally fight that it is *false.*
---
We can change what it posts initially but once the thread is up we can't edit it.
---
"some"
---
Looks like it actually happened today!
---
WOAH shots fired lmfao
---
 You cant outrice the chinesse man
---
I'm pretty sure he was saying initially that he does not believe he has done anything wrong to deserve a ban...  His story hasn't changed.  Just a different words to say the same thing.  I believe the forum post came first, right?
---
I dream that one day I’ll have a case where the opponent is guilty of the exact conduct (s)he alleges against my side, and that I will be authorized to respond with just “NO U.”
---
He's a lobbyist. I don't know if you guys just live in different countries and don't understand or what. A us lobbyist is EXPECTED to be a complete scumbag. True scum of the Earth people. His entire profession is barely even legal to begin with.
---
The notion that this is going to damage his illustrious career as a legalized bribe negotiator is pretty ridiculous.
---
Sure.  They can.  They didn't just ban him, however, they publicly accused him of something.
---
Except they gave a reason.  If that reason isn't true, that's the problem.  Not the ban.
---
That's supposed to be some sort of argument for other retards like you?
---
&gt; See my above point.... I wasn't aware a private company had the power to .... proclaim someone as guilty and then publicly shame said individual? 
---
Welp. They do. You can too. If you state facts you can publicly shame anyone you want. That’s what the western definition of free speech has long meant.
---
If you state something that’s non-factual then things get less clear.
---
&gt; Yes.... there is.... Then the publicly shamed said individual
---
That’s not an accusation. Shaming someone isn’t an accusation. You’re bad at this game but I’ll credit your persistence.
---
&gt; When you spread libel.... it is.
---
This however, is an accusation. How about you go and attach your out of game person to a published statement of that accusation? I’d be curious to see how that works for you, and I certainly hope you have a lot of evidence to support your accusation.
---
Otherwise, well, you know.
---
So again. Habeus corpus. Bring out the body. Prove there is a crime you can accuse them of.
---
Ok but what is a CSM? I'm like genuinely curious. I visit the sub maybe every six months when there's enough upvotes cause something's on the go. But it's mostly shitposts about it (to be faiiiirrrr, it's generally just shitposts anyway)
---
Well you need a good narrative to convince people to  play Perimeter Ops Online (POO) since no one wants to join fleets.
---
Rest of the INIT FC "get me brown pants" or drop Titans on every frig? Will be interesting to see how this shapes INIT and their role in the Imperium.
---
I'm fairly certain he hasn't yet taken legal steps because... As he said... he doesn't yet know what the specifics are.  I get the feeling that maybe he likes this game, or something, and would rather deal with CCP than a judge?
---
Oh wow you actually think there is a difference? Both are a character betraying their Corp and or alliance. They are even lower than high sec gamers
---
Oh I thought you were talking about the walking in stations thing lol.
---

Rule #99.
---
I like how you think law is complicated, go do something useful and challenging like physics. Lol law is the basic bitch of subjects.
---
Obviously you dont know this sub very well.
---
You misspelled "sovereign".
---
Or fabricated.
---
Fabricating evidence is also a fun one.
---
&gt; It becomes interesting to apply that expression to wardecs and all the thousands of players who quit for 15 years until they recently changed it. Who gives a fuck about player retention when its profit you are after? No relation there, right? 
---
The unfortunate part of that is that they based a lot of their decision off of that little statistic that players who were killed tended to stay around longer than players who weren't. This stat was pushed by a large number of players who didn't want CCP to change the current PvP/WarDec mechanics in what they claimed was "dumbing down" or being "friendlier" to casuals. They wanted Eve to remain "hardcore". 
---
This was a view that was pushed by a number of the members of the CSM. It was only when the playerbase was in deep decline that the voice of reason won out. So you can thank your benevolent CSM for not allowing a change that would probably have saved those subscriptions.
---
Yep, that's just weird. Not the fun kind of weird, the creepy one.
---
lol u think im in test or have ever been?
---
Ah. I understand now. You are right.
---
War is peace
---
Freedom is slavery
---
Ignorance is strength
---
As one member of the legion of F1 button pushers generally under your command, I’m enjoying the role reversal.
---
Correct
---
To give you a serious answer. The Council of Stellar Management (CSM) is a group of people elected by the players that represent them on matters that CCP are undertaking. They basically provide feedback on new features/changes coming to the game. These members are under NDAs because they are privy to game features way in advance of the general public. 
---
Brisc was the leader of one of the largest alliances in game (The Initiative) and was a member of the CSM until he broke the NDA he was under and CCP expelled him. He allegedly shared information to two people in his alliance. Because of him breaking the NDA he got a permanent ban and the two people that he shared information got 1 year bans.
---
I suffer from perpetual optimism.
---
DO YOU EVEN LIFT, BRO?
---
Once i watched JFK! I know my shit, lady!!
---
I am gonna sue you for making this a sticky.
---
oh my... you think every single min on fox is about propaganda for trump? looks like all you watch is cnn and msbc. trump is bad, he is russian spy! he is member of kkk BLA BLA BLA. go watch some independente news insted. kinda sound like a sjw
---
So, a couple of questions about diamond rats (before I try to test these on the test server):
---
1) Are there any resources about the list of spawns of regular diamond rats and FOB diamond rats, based on the ship / ships you 'trigger' them with?
---
2) Do diamond rats in systems with NPC Sotiyos behave similarly to FOB rats? Will these Sotiyo rats come as reponse fleets in belts and / or attack Citadels in these systems?
---
3) And last one about NPC Sotiyos. When people run them with supercarriers from range, do they just warp at 3k+ and burn fighters? Or is it possible to land near the structure, drop fighters, and warp to distance?
---
He's this guy who I saw one time turn up on an Eve stream wearing a shirt and tie and holding a crystal tumbler, probably containing single malt.  I remember thinking, "how odd".
---
The CSM is a jolly for a select group of gamers with too much spare time on their hands.
---
where did this dumb information come from? whoever told you that, tell them they're retarded for me
---
supers can clear a haven in ~2:30, a titan can go no faster than 4 minutes at the absolute maximum
---
more blatant xenophobia from PGL... tisk tisk.
---
retard is a defamation
---
I expect memory management issues was hidden by the fact the client crashed when it used too much.
---
I snagged it during last sale and it's been great. I haven't played a multiplayer game where people communicated and helped each other out to the extent I have seen in Foxhole. Since it's only 20 bucks, I'd say its worth a snag.
---
And? CCP are the only ones that see that.
---
that's a yikes from me dawg
---
Bless your heart
---
hmm
---
UPDINO!!!
---
"I swear it was beer!"
---
No I don’t, ma negro?
---
Was that the right terminology to reply to one of them there retards?
---
All true.
---
At the same time,  the dude tweeted about a video game issue from his professional Twitter account, and deftly tied his video game reputation to his RL one.   Of all games not to tie your professional reputation to..
---
This is the quality of shitpost we need, but don’t deserve.
---
&gt; if i turn on cnn and msbc idk what ill get, maybe fake news about another so called hate crime, or russia this and russia that.
---
so basically you don't like the concept of news.
---
&gt; Lol that pastebin makes Gobbins looks much worse than me
---
naaaaah
---
I am not the one passing judgement.
---
You are claiming "logic" shows that CCP could not possibly be lying about Brisk Rubal. May I ask what you could possibly be making such a claim based off of? Do you have internal access of all documents at CCP's office? How do you come to such conclusion... based on nothing? Why are you swearing / getting heated.... seeming to take this personally?
---
If Brisk takes CCP to court on Libel charges.... and CCP backs up their claims and the courts throw out Brisk's charges..... then I will acknowledge that Brisk was guilty of what CCP claimed.
---
I reserve my judgements till I see evidence.... Yet.... you claim "logic" backs up your claims that Brisk is guilty.... based on no tangible evidence given publicly....
---
Are you a lobbyist  IRL?
---
Not really
---
real pain the ass tho
---
But the question is if he has a case, as CCP did not play it on him as a real life individual. Also Brisc chose to tie his real life to his online alter ego. That is your own responsibility.
---
All these people talking about libel....libel against an Eve account yeah right. It's his own fault he told the world who he was gtfoh.
---
F.
---
\#IHopeThatWasSarcasm
---
Oh look, we got a gigx poser here.
---
That entirely depends. If Brisc sues in the US there is nothing he can do as CCP no longer operates there. So he must head to the UK and follow UK jurisdiction. Good luck with that nightmare.
---
I heard there's a lawyer available with lots of time on hand.
---
I mean it's reddit it's where the clueless post there casual take on the subject ( and i'm very much included in that ) because if they where expert there likely would not well be on reddit posting about it.
---
Actually he did get a vouch.. ahem. Yea.....
---
Yes you would know all about legal ramblings after you got dragged through the ringer by 61 lawyers for being an accessory to illegal activities happening on r/eve you cuck.

Links first:

[Gameindustry.biz article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/ccp-announces-the-council-of-stellar-management-to-empower-players-through-representative-democracy-in-eve-online
---
Unfortunately the links to the page from the dev blog to the ‘reasons’ for the CSM are dead. 
---
So some conjecture based on history:
---
CSM likely started shortly after the debacle when it was found that a member (or members) of CCP staff was unfairly assisting their ingame alliance (iirc it was BoB). Players obviously believed the game to be rigged, so one of the ideas that came up was player representation.

CSM is basically the group of designated players that are allowed more organic access to developers and CCP as a company. In essence they function like a focus group, with the focus being everything EVE/CCP. It’s not perfect, but it does allow a bit more guidance and direction to CCP if they use the group correctly.
---
One thing that CSM members have access to is secret information on things like active development that would normally not be shared with players. This information is covered by an NDA that also includes rules against gaming the system with that privileged information. Which is what all the drama is about.

&gt; I never spin

&gt; and I resent the accusation

&gt; how dare you

Says the guy who once managed to spin so fantastically hard he made his national news.
---
"previously naive", huh? That's kind of adorable. 
---
The simple fact is that they're very different things, with different motivations and mechanics at play. Infiltration is a long-term intentional job. You go in with the intent to infiltrate, spy, and potentially sabotage. There's no betrayal there, because you were never on their side to begin with. You were *always* their enemy, they just don't know that. Yet. 
---
Betrayal is when this is *not* the case. Betrayal necessitates being on the same side, briefly, at the very least. You can't swap sides or betray someone if you weren't on their side, or their friend to begin with. 
---
One of these is someone betraying their corp and alliance. The other is someone doing *exactly* what their actual corp/alliance expects them to do. 
---
If you can't tell the difference, yet call other people naive, you might not be cut out for Eve.

/u/Salivan_Harddin Is there a 'In case of bot error, dial X' I can ring up about this?  
---
Cable News is utter garbage and largely infotainment that just confirms a certain audiences' priors.  
---
SJW is a meaningless term.  I do enjoy the 'go watch some independente news insted' from the guy who thinks Fox provides "truth".
---
"Trident - The three prongs of misery and chaos" was a good one tho
---
PR, he either owns up to it or denies it. 
---
Given denying the ban would well lose all credibility, he has to own up to the accusation, with a denial of the facts.
---
Ahhh ok, thanks for the explanation mate. I think I finally get why it's so funny. CCP thought it was a good idea to involve eve players to better new Eden
---
Narrator voice: it wasn't
---
&gt;The unfortunate part of that is that they based a lot of their decision off of that **little statistic** that players who were killed tended to stay around longer than players who weren't. 
---
Which was arguably laughable and in the same league as "skillpoints dont matter".
---
&gt;This stat was pushed by a large number of players who didn't want CCP to change the current PvP/WarDec mechanics in what they claimed was "dumbing down" or being "friendlier" to casuals. They wanted Eve to remain "hardcore". 
---
They just wanted what was enjoyable to them - griefing. It was never hardcore. It was predetermined, stupid, and with a predictable result.
---
&gt;It was only when the playerbase was in deep decline that the voice of reason won out. So you can thank your benevolent CSM for not allowing a change that would probably have saved those subscriptions.
---
I think it was the fact that CCP was bought. The new company probably wanted to see things like new player retention. When it turned out CCP left it in the dumpster for 15 years, they were told to fix it.
---
Injectors could be because of revenue, but could also be a random idea that somehow didnt get killed in time. There is no particular pattern that fully explains CCP's actions.

Wasnt mittani something like that too and got fired and banned?

For most people, almost anything that isn't a single subcap. Carriers will shred you, and most small tackle can keep you pointed indefinitely as you will have no means to track them. So as soon as shit starts landing, you get the fuck out or you die.

well since it keep getting debunked EVERYTIME russia collusion debunked but there still talking about it fake new. smollett faked a hate crime cnn and msbc still saying he is innocent. covingtons school trip fake news from ccn and msbc still wont change statement. do you need more proof why i rather wanna watch propaganda than fake news?
---
No kidding. Apparently there’s a small chance you can find a t3 wreck in some systems/sites, but that’s so situational that i’m just going with a firework launcher
---
Completely agreed.  Even if you are entirely knowledgeable, your opinion isn’t relevant. I’m really beginning to believe this game is better without the 4% of players who read this tripe sub.

happy bs downvoate day
---
If you look at the battle reports for fights like X47, UALX, and B-R, you’ll notice that supercarriers don’t die very much and not nearly in proportion to their attendance. 
---
Primary reason for this is just that titans are the ultimate solution against capitals (if not subcaps as well). When you count things like reps into the picture, you’ll see that it is enormously easy to outrepair the relatively low damage of a super. This is less of an issue for titans. Doomsday’s are the only realistic way to alpha another ship of such massive HP before reps can have an effect. 
---
You simply can’t replicate that kind of absolute killing power on supercarriers.

 I’m going to represent Brisc against CCP, and all you cucks better be ready, because when we win the servers will be closing.
---
&gt; They literally require you to register for csm election with RL identity.
---
Register yes, but they do not disclose that information. In fact they go to good lengths to prevent RL identity leaks at the request of any CSM member. For example look at some of the latest CSM videos / pics, see the ones censored out for jsut this purpose.

Not trying to be an asshole here, but it’s "*affects* people", not "*effects* people". [This should clear up any misconceptions.](https://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/affect-effect/) And again, I’m truly not trying to be an asshole, so I hope you don’t take it that way.

I had an old mate in the military I played eve with And hung out with IRL(2012ish). He was having a tough time in eve and so my bro and I gave him a carrier, paladin, blops, bunch of battleships etc over the course of a year so.   
---
Well, guy ended up stealing everything saying he deserved the stuff and went loony after he started dating some woman. Ended up trying to take it out on me IRL because he outranked me at the time. Tried to write me up and get me sent to captains mast because I didn't let him go bat shit crazy on one of my sailors. Did not work out well for him.   
---
Mostly im disappointed over it. He tried to reach out a couple years ago but that was a hard pass for me.   
---
Sorry it happened to you mate.
---
Goons use them like Horde uses Stabbers : heavy tackle that just needs to survive long enough for the DPS to show up.
---
Um , i couldve sworn some dood was on here a while back talking about how he eventually got revenge on someone he had gone to school with IRL.  
---
Im wondering if this is that same situation from the otherside.

Depends, was it Law &amp; Order:SVU or regular Law &amp; Order?  God help you if it was Criminal Intent.

I am sure what i think is in the NDA is what is in the NDA and if its not in there it should be in there anyway and was only left out by mistake. Also lets complain about free speech while we are at it and also taking away anyones space guns is clearly a braking of the 5th. How dare a non-US company do such a thing???!!!
---
TAPI, still in the victim mode with father complex.(daddy being whoever being #1 at the time).
---
Know what's common between GOONS and PL and not TAPI? Goons and PL both aimed to be at the top, they went for it, got it, lost it, got it again etc or didnt and they stopped fucking bitching about it eventually. All we've heard is TEST cry about whatever made-up injustice has been inflicted upon them that month for the past few years.

CEO of RKK vouched me, 00tricky is a RL of mine
---
I will grab my popcorn and enjoy CCP reply.

For instance how will you send court subpoena from US to Iceland.
---
That's pretty naive thinking it would have no effect on his real life is they announced it. They knew he was open about his real life identity, which true is his doing, but this is also the first time they have EVER announced someone's permanent ban, and also the first time they announced a reason for said ban, which is normally included in an email from a GM, not in a news update. Let me remind you, any emails from a GM are typically not supposed to be released, on threat of receiving a ban. Now this is obviously different from a normal situation since he's on the CSM, but there is definitely room to argue CCP went outside their normal procedures to publicize this, while knowing fully well it could hurt his real life career.
---
I'm glad they're dealing with this corruption in a correct fashion, but I can't help but feel a little bit like they're sensationalizing this for their own benefits, as it could have been dealt with much quieter with the same exact results, as far as punishments for breaking the rules goes.

Attributes and implants affect SP/hr.  How would it know how many SP to accumulate?
---
&gt; So you think being able to repeatedly decline missions with essentially zero standing loss due to running the boosters, allowing one to maximize farming of LP via choosing only farmable lvl5 missions without the prior and significant 4 hour downtime vs huge standing loss decision tree previously faced without the usage of boosters... is a small potatoes thing?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; What, my friend, do you think is a "big potatoes" thing, then?
---
All this does is for L5s, same people that used pullers before now don't have to switch to them as much. As for the regular HS L4 burners and regular missions, there is literally almost no change. Where before you just jumped a system or coupel systems over, now you can kick the can on that jump a little longer with the booster. 
---
Both of which I have tried and done. These differences are so miniscule its ridiculous to even bring this up as a problem. 
---
if you wanna address some real shit then how about concentrate on stuff like cap proliferation, small / mid corps disappearing from the game, NS faucets still fauceting idiotic amounts of ISk, multi account requirements in many segments of the game, Rorq changes being shit and not changing anything. Stuff like this. Incidentally, if you think L5s are an income problem of any sort whatsoever then take a damn good look at MERs. So its not as if there is no data on anything I just brought up, its posted for you to see every single damn month.
---
Hey Hawkeye! I actually had an alt in with you guys during that time (Glory Homer). Don’t remember the name of the toonie. Wasn’t spying just wanted to play wormhole life on the side without leaving PL. Really enjoyed playing with you guys and very sorry to hear about that

except it wasn't, and if you hold an opinion like this you quite clearly did not decide last month that you hated media other than fox news.

oh for fucks sake

&gt; do you need more proof why i rather wanna watch propaganda than fake news?

you aren't offering proof, you are offering weak as fuck justifications for actively consuming media that deliberately misinforms you.

Very true of course. I'm very weary of when I choose to rat. Aka 16-18k online. Nobody living in the hole. Alt on at least one of the holes.

Also is your reddit name a reference to the ‘74 Roadrunner?

I once caught the closing credits of "COPS". I am the real expert here...

Shouldn’t have broken that NDA then.
---
It's not a trial. But you're also acting like you know what happened when literally none of us do except for CCP and the people accused. I honestly can't stand Brisc but writing a blog post calling out a bar qualified lawyer for breach of NDA without also providing proof at least to them sucks and sets a pretty shitty precedent. They should have just left it at he was permanently banned.

We go into this war against enemies who are stronger in the aggregate than any we’ve ever faced before, and we can expect them to have nearly infinite money to fund the war effort between the farmers and their leader’s credit card reserves. The past six months of peace have allowed our enemies to buy themselves a substantial capital and super capital fleet that will be incredibly difficult to overcome.

Actually it was Law &amp; Order: UK.
---
He broke a rl NDA
---
When he has a job that requires trust he should know that breaking a NDA will have consequenses for his career. He can't just say "its just a game" because that doesn't matter, the fact is he obviously can't be trusted.
---
What if he does this in a more serious situation?
---
Well the worst CSM members get a flair, why not some intenetz space lawyer?

Treat skill point gain per minute by the minimum attribute, then apply the attribute multiplier to the skill is activated on?
---
So if the skill is charisma based, multiply the skill points by the characters attribute. 
---
However I think this may be open for abuse, but it would better than nothing. 
---
So.
---
Time no characters are in training at the lowest average attribute as an account item.
---
Attach to account for skill points allocation. 
---
Multiply skill points by attribute modifiers of the skill being trained.
---
Former CSM, also former top man of Hard knocks. Was banned last year for leaking NDA.
---
Again, you're saying "He broke a rl NDA" but neither you nor I actually know that for certain since there's no proof provided. This goes beyond just banning someone from a game into personally damaging their career territory. I'd say that deserves a release a proof.

Goes on Reddit to complain about arm chair legal advice and provides arm chair legal advice..
---
Here’s your claw hammer
---
Appreciated, but it doesn't really answer to me what kind of information one might risk legal action by sharing with other players.
---
&gt;  It is absolutely his fault for connecting his real life to his in game life.
---
It's the equivalent of saying, "Well, she was just asking for it wearing *that*." Or, "Should have locked his door, then he'd still have a car."
---
That's victim blaming. You're blaming the victim for engaging in what should be completely normal behavior rather than those who take advantage of it for nefarious purposes.
---
It's a player voted group of other players (generally high level people inside their alliance that act as stooges for their alliance on the council) that is supposed to help CCP understand player sentiment,  find out pain points within the game and give representation to the wider player base around what CCP should focus on.
---
Brisc has been banned because evidence has been uncovered that he used information gained under the basis of NDA in order to profit within the game,  having shared that information with other members of his alliance.
---
CCP has their head up their arse if they don't think this hasn't been occurring frequently with other CSM representatives.
---
nice vid! It's fun to watch with subtitles.
---
ALL DAMPS ON THE DOMONIX!!!!
---
This is entirely possible. I vouched a fair amount during my time. It's all kinda fuzzy but I think I may had been in RKK at that time., So maybe that is where the confusion on my part was.Also I miss tricky. He unintentionally poached me from Snigg by just telling me about RKK history and BoB times.
---
Legacy leadership would kick members when they complained about botting in their area of influence.
---
There was a time when running in the CSM meant CCP doxxed you as a matter of course.  I, as evidence  point to their own site  https://www.eveonline.com/article/csm-7-elections-final where every candidate is named as well as country of residence.  Yup, I am there,  too.
---
There's a reason courts have character witnesses. People don't just do a complete 180 overnight.
---
Finding a group and gaining trust with their leadership over time is the general way of doing it. Many groups have their trusted diplos sorted, but growing corps and alliances will have upcoming opportunities. Good luck
---
The NDA would cover information like dev plans for reducing ship costs, adding or subtracting slots on a ship, having a new ship, changing to how items spawn like anomalies or asteroids.
---
Essentially the CSM have information to things that are 6 months to a year out that the players do not have.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/ccplease
---
It’s also apparently player driven
---
The fact that you got so triggered in that pastebin kinda tells the whole story...
---
Aha. So, "ship x is gonna go up in cost in 6 months so I suggest you buy loads of it now", basically.
---
satire is lost upon you isnt it
---
Something like that yeah.
---
Yeah, I'm not buying it. A logical action would have been to announce his ban. The logic behind defaming him by announcing a rl NDA contract breach w/o giving any context, even to the accused, seems needlessly tactless.
---
Still not sure about this. I'll update you when imperium leadership let's me know how I feel.
---
Awesome story!
---
Call your rl mate and buy him a beer.
---
Only in eve can you experience stuff like this and if you are a subscriber you sure got your money worth
---
But we know how much BS CCP feeds us for YEARS.
---
Everytime they fuck up they come up with shit like this. They don't like a ticket ups we have no logs.
---
We call their shit ups i don't know or no comment or whatever.
---
For the love of humanity stop the fucking white knighting of CCPs BS. Stop telling people what the hell we can do and cannot do. Get mod rights of you want. Otherwise STFU.
---
I’ve heard The Initiative (INIT) might have a few vacancies..
---
This game is pretty incredible for the RL lessons it has. Usually they're relayed to personal finance and risk taking, but this is something different.
---
Of course manipulation and deceit exist in people everywhere, but I wonder if the community that surround this game exhibit it so much because the game gives an opportunity for it to emerge, or if the people in the game are disproportionately antisocial or unsocialised that they tend to behave that way.
---
A lesson for life: just because you can indulge in certain conduct by the rules/law it doesn't mean that you should.
---
Lesson two: there is almost no end to the evil that *some* people are happy and willing to do to you, even if they're your closest friends/relatives, and *especially* when money or sex is involved. Here *some* is bigger than you think. It is always OK to be impolite and not put your trust in people for something. You're always told as a kid that to be a good person is to not be rude. IRL is far more nuanced than that. Rather, you need to learn when to be very rude and when to be nice.
---
That said, I sometimes don't mind people getting scammed in the game if they learnt something. The_Judge could have been your IRL business partner rather than your spaceship buddy, that guy in Jita local could have been an IRL Nigerian 419er rather than just a goon pretending he's helping you join Karmafleet, it could have been you wallet or worse that you left around with Flying Condor while you went to pee.
---
I get this game, but I would not at all be OK with my IRL relationships with people if they scammed me even 1% of what gets described in this post or /r/eve.
---
This is a helpful statement. Diplo is a lofty goal to achieve, but you need to put in your time like anything else in eve to achieve said goal.
---
Keep at it, talk to your Corp leadership and if they are any good, they will give you the tools and knowledge on your next step toward said goals.
---
That’s actually not what I’m on about, most of my space friends who taught me how to play this game in my early days are gone.... out of the corp I was with when starting out back in highsec so long ago I’m the only player left, most of my old contacts and folks I met are gone....
---
That’s what I mean by deep decline, these people had been playing for years and all disappeared at similar times as well (last 3 years).
---
Imagine if you’re a game dev for Eve, and you plan on introducing a balance pass to nerf, say, VNIs. You’d want to get feedback from players, and luckily you already have a group of people (CSM) who think a lot about how the game works and how players might respond to changes. You ask them about the planned change, but stress that it’s still secret. 
---
Now imagine one of those CSM members told someone else about the change, and then that person liquidated their VNI stock before anyone else knew.
---
First, we tell Dr. Yueh we have his wife

people with insider knowledge they will soon be useful buys up all the guns on the cheap and sells them when their price rises.

I find it fascinating that you can sometimes hear a person's voice by the manner in which they write.
---
Wow. I only dabble in Eve for about 10 years now and basically just enjoy the stories. This was brutal.
---
Exactly. I would be like damn you had me lmao.
---
I would be proud intact lul.
---
Also gives a target in game to fuck over.
---
OP is way too invested in Eve.
---
okay lets ask you WHAT IS Proff? couse it look like your a for left liberal that cry's rape but touching a shoulder
---
No it doesn't. 
---
Brisc is of course free to take it to court, where it would have to be presented.
---
But we as a community are not entitled to it, Brisc is not entitled to it.
---
And imagine acting like they weren't all doing this.
---
People who believe Brisc didn't do this are almost as stupid as people who think Brisc was the only one doing this.    That's what happens when you allow major corporations to vote their own stooge onto the council and have no condition that they must remove themselves from the alliance that effectively ensured their seat.
---
What 180? He is a lobbyist. Do you not understand what that means? Using inside knowledge for personal gain is his fucking bread and butter dude...
---
I think there's a line that gets crossed when you walk into somebody's home, take photo's of something in their bedroom while they're gone, while also supposedly being years-long friends from high school.
---
If the nature of that violation is not obvious to you then you have problems.
---
Start at the corp level, gain peoples trust. At the corp level you'll be working with alliance leadership, then you might end up helping them out if you're a reliable trustworthy person. etc. I don't think most corps have a clear path drawn out, because 1) it isn't worth it and 2) spies would just use the path
---
Now Vard, that’s considered impolite :(
---
Not everyone who plays eve is like this. OP is a douche though.
---
Its mainly info on upcoming changes that will be made to the game. Example is if a t2 ship is going to get buffed then you friends all start hording a bunch of that ship, csm member gets booted and potentially banned if its bad enough. As for something that would have legal action, maybe from the accused trying to get revenge, but for ccp to take legal action it would have to be business damage something along the lines that eve going into maintenance mode but 5 years worth of balance patches and releases are already prepared. Just a hypothetical scenario though.
---
Why not ask Killah Bee, he's the only one with motive to report it.

\#bittermuch
---
That's when lobbying is abused. Lobbying in and of itself is not nefarious, just as unions are not inherently nefarious.
---
The entire point of lobbying was to help educate members of Congress on issues they may not understand. Congress writes laws governing every aspect of life, many of which they're very much clueless about. Lobbying is meant to bridge that gap, by having experts share their knowledge.
---
Naw.

Bullshit. You keep drinking that Kool aid.

Dunno, heard he's not reliable with client attorney privilege.

I just read a bit faster so I can soak it all in.

It definitely brings to light how neutral the council members need to be. I thinking the idea is great and likely a reason we Eve is still around.

But boy they need to get people who are impartial to player politics.
---
It really doesn't.

Almost as stupid as people who make unhinged accusations without having evidence.

My IRL friends introduced me to EVE, and we had a tonne of fun ganking people in 3-4 man frigate roams. They're my best friends, and I will always remember the good fights.
---
looking forward to this

This isn't the first CSM member removed for breaking NDA.
---
I'm gonna need you to take 10 to 20 percent of there, Sahara_J
---
but who leaked?
---
All will because clear in: Space Court.
---
I dont care. FRT ist TEST, that makes them the badies by definition. (We should self-report botters, tho)
---
Yes, every lawyer is simultaneously the best lawyer in the system. No lawyer who ever went to Law School *ever* loses in court. :eyeroll:
---
I have four RL friends (or, to phrase it more accurately, I know four people IRL) who went to Law School and are now lawyers. Three of them are dumb as bricks (but Dunning-Kruger caricatures), lazy, entitled and arrogant, and get paid *great* money for it. I think the main thing that draws people to a profession in law, and also the main personality trait that makes them financially successful at it, is arrogance. I don't pretend to know why for sure, but my best speculation is that they tend to respond really positively to arrogance, so financially successful lawyers tend to hire new arrogant lawyers to work for them and the cycle continues.
---
Maybe that's what you meant. If so, my bad.
---
The fourth (who I do consider a friend, not just 'someone I know') is pretty smart, a massively hard worker, doesn't get paid nearly as much (but I think he's doing fine) - but he wanted to become a lawyer because he wanted to contribute meaningfully to water / environmental law in our state. He's not exactly a "normal" lawyer in terms of his motivations or career.
---
I had a BFF who I would have trusted with just about anything. It's lucky I didn't have kids as I would have trusted him with them too. He's apparently doing his third prison term for being an active sick pedophile. No matter how close you get to someone you will never know what's really in their heart.
---
Meh for a day or two maybe. What are we all so offended for?
---
;((((((((((
---
You're absolutely right, but perhaps making up these narratives is just part of the fun for them.
---
This ^
---
The players need to elect impartial players who want the game to do well, bit isn't effected or invested in Eve drama, and is trustworthy.
---
Alright man you definitely don't know what you are talking about.  
---
First, he is a politician. Candidate for the Republicans in fact.  
---
Second, he could (acctually couldn't but yeah we know how lawsuits and false accusations go) sue CCP for damaging his reputation and IF he won he could sue them for reparations in terms of money.  
---
Third, CCP could sue him for leaking classified information (under the NDA) and damaging their potential income as a company. Again, reparations in terms of money.
---
Don't say other people don't know shit of you can't even manage 10 seconds to google his employment profile.
---
But how will we play detective/lawyer then?
---
i didn't check the dps before the patch to see if this picture is legit or not but earlier (and currently if they havent fixed it yet) the siege module only gives a 2% bonus to haw damage instead of the 2x like its supposed to.

&gt;so what was your purpose to "point out" this "do you know"
---
&gt; I have an alt in Test

The real reason you won't come on corp drunk fleets :pepehands:

No. I refuse to knock off being a lawyer.

I have a fancy lawyers tie and everything.

bahahaha
---
Command Destroyer or Assault Frigate will complement anything in hostile null.
---
Especially Command Destroyers can fuck around a lot in combination with a Sabre Bubble since you can boosh the Bubble as well. A Magus has a pretty high active tank and offensive Command Bursts so I guess it'll do a good Job.
---
Since a 100km boosh in any direction will give you time to either disengage or seperate your prey from any reinforcements its kinda cancerous to field against it.
---
Your standart Assault Frigate like the Wolf etc. can pull close to 300dps heated and has shittons of tank. A Skirmish Command Burst can increase Tackle Range boni by about 30% so you don't really need to bring an Interceptor for Tackle anyways.
---
If you want to drop or camp bigger shit you want Bombers tho! They can pull 1400 dps if fitted correctly and can get rid of your usual Rattlesneksneksnek rather quickly.
---
&gt; was the downfall (at least partially) of Test 1.0.
---
I mean getting the deep dick from the CFC with next to no allies didn't help much at the time either.

Still making bomb ass videos bud? Nice to see you're back to playing

what are you training for now?
---
So not to shit on your story too much here, but the moment we saw an Aeon inside of our space we kinda knew what was happening.  PL was also (at the time) aggressively farming us inside our own space, so we knew very well that PL had the ability to dunk on our heads at a moments notice.    We had eyes on the various stashes of ships you had around and realized very early that this was bait.  
---
Condolences for that shitty friendship though, that sucks.
---
You might like to consider the possibility that they didn't
---
This is actually sad to read.

Must have hurt like SOB, to have someone you consider a friend back stab you in a f-ing game, a GAME.

I feel for you OP.

Apart from that, ty for an interesting story.

Point of being racist?

so what is mullers report just a bounce of bullshit?

99% of people trying to play eve
---
Supercarriers are actual shit and cancer to try to use in the mega tidi brawls.  I brought one to UALX and I don't think I ever got the bombers to actually fire on anything in between disconnects.
---
42 is pretty low, if you want to brag about killmarks.
---
There is no allegation or evidence. Until that is made public, the entire CSM and CCP integrity are called into question.
---
Penny Arcade once described EVE as a "Treachery Simulator"
---
Seems apt.
---
Almost feels like taking people out of the EVE playerbase has a pretty nice chance of resulting in shady shenanigans.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
You were caught RED HANDED. How can you defend yourself when you were caught in such a manner?
---
Its like a murderer, standing over the body, knife in hand, covered in blood, sreaming "I DIDN'T DO IT!!!"

Trust me, the type of player you are, EVE is better off. Just take your spanking and never darken the Gates of EVE again.

&gt; what about 2 weeks before? do you fix it then?

From what I heard when he was on stream it sounded like once he found out who the second person was who was banned he realized the context CCP was using, and what actions led them to believe he was leaking information. If you listen to his careful responses, he says he never leaked any information that was given by CCP to the council in confidence, or talked about what was the topic of discussion at CSM meetings. That leaves a lot of room for technically not breaking the rules. Especially if it's with information that was publicly available from other staff sources like twitter.
---
How about now? How many are left? One? Two? Looks like we are a little more relevant than you thought we were.
---
The problem with this post is that if people take your advice where will they find drama and rage in such easy, juicy abundance?
---
He is not a politician. He holds no office in the real world. He tried to be a politician and failed miserably. He's a lobbyist.
---
To your second point that's not entirely true either. You should read the sticky on this sub. Libel is not that simple especially when they can prove what they are accusing.
---
Sure you can sue for damages if someone breaks an NDA but what did they lose? What damages? Just because he broke an NDA and he gained from it does not actually mean CCP has lost something out if it.
---
You're literally talking right from your ass here.
---
The NDA that was signed, assuming it is somewhat typical, wouldn't have any kind of stipulation that says "We will talk to you first if you do something shitty" and in fact, ESPECIALLY because he was a CSM, he should not be given the chance to speak. He was caught red handed, in direct violation of the CSM agreement, and as well, I am sure that it violated the EULA/ToS.
---
Are you hitting on me?
---
I agree with everything Gobbins said. Good read.
---
&gt; so what is mueller report just a bounce of bullshit?
---
since trump and his hand picked cronies are fighting to make sure we don't see it, i'm unclear why you ask.
---
&gt;  and what did the left do when mueller put in the report?
---
demand that we can see it rather than barr's book report that he's now testifying isn't a summary.
---
&gt; there startet to scream russian spy we dont care about the report we know we are right and so on
---
....so have you read the trump junior emails?

Nah fuck The Judge

But, how is a US player who is also a politician, going to go to another nation and start proceedings? the Icelandic courts would throw his ass out on a dime.

I like cars and world-class works of art and that one is both.

I could have referred to a da Vinci or a Rembrandt I suppose.
---
Already done. Goliath said they started tracking the bug on March 30. It's another comment in the thread
---
It’s not like the Judge knew them irl, that’s the biggest difference here
---
Only people I've known IRL who play eve had died from OD'ing on heroin.
---
the second carriers drop fighters the server eats shit. Atleast with titans you have some instant damage without boating fighters and they tend to perform better than fighters in heavy tidi
---
"Guy who's a professional faker at sounding innocent in genuine sounds innocent and genuine"
---
He works as a politicial and legislative director and founded a lobbying firm.  
---
Yes libel isn't simple and I didn't say he will, I said he could sue CCP. Would be a stupid move from what I gathered, tho seeing as CCP only used his IG name and he was the one who put himself into the spotlight.
---
We also don't know what he said that he broke the NDA so we don't know IF CCP has lost anything. IF they did they could sue him.
---
Don't be rude to people because you are trying to prove your point man.

Shocking, I know. Was tempted to throw in a reference just because it seemed like the cool thing to do but naaah
---
Plus the fact that it has a blackops jump drive sold me on it
---
I think you're misunderstanding me, I think he's probably not completely innocent, and he probably did enough to technically not break the NDA the person reviewing his case probably isn't a god and probably assumed the stuff they read was just the tip of the iceberg and that the report was credible. He seems like a "technically I wasn't breaking the rules...." kind of guy, but that's just my opinion.
---
Correction.  It's ma'am.

I doubt it, to my knowledge he went inactive from EVE after I blocked him irl. No activity on his zkill. He only picked it up again to play with me and I never told him I found out. Who knows maybe he lurks this reddit and just found out today
---
Well, the internet turned shite a while ago........When all the "Normies" and then companies(big corp money) followed the normies and got their interest and claws into it, and it went all commercial and "arse  down, tits up", when suddenly, we were all faced with:     
---
"Thats not normal to know", "Thats not how it was", "Thats not what my schoolbook said", "Thats not how you are supposed to read it", and the last one "YOU ARE WRONG THIS IS :FAKE NEWS".

PS: I know it sound a bit "tin foil" and cringy but:  Search Your Feelings, You Know It To Be True......
---
Fuck you Brisc
---
we dont have any titans
---
&gt; I am not the one passing judgement.
---
You’re the one accusing CCP of a violation of *law*. CCP is within its rights to deny someone access to their service for any violations of their agreements and can terminate membership in any invitational subgroups therein for any reason stated or otherwise. They literally did nothing wrong there. I don’t think we disagree. 
---
Where we might differ is that you, without evidence of any wrongdoing, are claiming that CCP committed a violation of libel and defamation laws.
---
in its attempt to be transparent about actions with high profile members of the community; as we have asked them often to do; they provided their reasons for a decision of removal and permanent ban. In doing so, they made a statement that NDA violations had occurred.
---
This can *only* be libel if it can be proven to be demonstrably false. Good luck with that. I await your evidence since you’re so willing to baselessly accuse CCP of legal violations while also howling about consequences.
---
&gt; I reserve my judgements till I see evidence.... 
---
You’ve already claimed CCP has committed libel. This is an accusation. Provide evidence, retract your accusation, admit that you’re making accusations without evidence, or continue being an obvious hypocrite.
---
&gt; you claim "logic" backs up your claims that Brisk is guilty
---
I stated quite clearly that logic suggests that the person who has the most to gain by lying in a contested situation is most often the one lying.
---
CCP has nothing to gain by kicking Brisc from CSM, Banning him, Shines and Pando, and providing an unsupportable statement as their reasoning for their actions. They benefit in no way from this.
---
Brisc on the other hand has plenty to gain by claiming to be innocent and ignorant in this situation whether that’s truthful or not. Not hard to spot who’s most likely to be bending the truth.
---
Wait until they put that gender into drive.
---
You don't need a  narrative to shoot people and blow their shit up, just say that you wanted to shoot people and blow their shit up. Stop spinning and just undock you retards.

&gt; Our Generation Is FAILING, Why Jordan Peterson Is One Remedy
---
thanks for reccing a guy who thinks a white nationalist is worth listening to
---
You were bumping off the structure.  You go to warp when your ship reaches 75% of your ship's maximum speed in a straight line towards the thing you are warping to.  However, if your ship hits another ship or "collidable object" it will not take damage but stop instantly.  This can happen even in a small ship.  You figured it out though, just fly away from the stucture and you then try to warp.
---
You just said he's a lobbyist in that first sentence and that's literally it. He's a lobbyist. Not a politician. Why is that so hard for people to grasp? Never been elected. Works for the private sector in politics. Not a politician.
---
&gt; the cringiest thing I have seen all year and this is coming from someone who suffers through VG discord all day
---
This was the best bit by far
---
The good news is that this is very much curable.
---
The collidable area of some structures can extend quite far out and bend towards other parts in odd ways.  The bobbing is a telltale sign of this.  Sometimes you can get really stuck and have to do a bit of manual piloting to free yourself.
---
You understand that this doesn't make him a sociopath right?
---
Did you read?
---
“I have no evidence to back up my claim and I’m in no way informed on the matter but I think the subject matter experts are full of shit.”
---
Lol, I think you are crazy. I was clearly not running into the ship. Every single other post on here clearly explains what happened. I never stopped instantly. I was constantly moving and fighting to move away from the ship for a few minutes. You could have flown a death star between me and the ship before the warp finally took off.
---
But.. But... TEXAS LAW!
---
Right cuz its hard to make a button that reopens the same program that just closed. Ffs I could make a script that does it.
---
Dunno what your interpretation of a politician is, but I would get it checked. Heard Renifran Lemon works well.
---
good thing they have this little handy tool on their keyboards named backspace to solve it.
---
yeah, law is typically practised in a standing position
---
Then fucking do it and submit the code to CCP.
---
more like CRINGE!
---
Do you realize how far you travel in 2 or 3 minutes... I doubt the structure extends well beyond double its visual size.

You can't sign an NDA with a fictional persona, and it doesn't matter how the the link was made between that persona and the person- the link exists and is public knowledge.
---
TBF, that deep dick was pretty kinda an inevitable result of previous narrative.
---
Imagine being so poor you have to carrier rat.
---
sure, as soon as they open the eve codebase and/or hire me to do it
---
Right cuz they take any suggestions right? Thats why cloaking is still busted.
---
I have no strong feelings towards either party right now, what opinion am I meant to have?
---
Why do you need the EVE codebase to write a script that opens and closes the program? ????
---
\&gt;No opinion  
---

Pick one

You're still alive? Holy shit

Excellent excuse. “I could kill that Dragon, but the Lords won’t let me. I’m the best but not allowed to prove it.”
---
Gtfoh.
---
I can tell you stalk a lot of women since you think court documents are love letters.
---
There are allegations though. Rubal broke the NDA, and according to CCP, not only did Pando and Shines not report Rubal to CCP, somebody (which one would assume to be one of the three that got banned) completed illicit in-game transactions with the info.
---
CCP takes forever to ban the most obvious of bots, partly because they wanna make completely sure. Before banning a 10 day old account that rats all day!!
---
Now imagine they ban Brisc Rubal. You can be damn sure they have extensively researched and checked the situation.
---
Doing a public detailed report on what happend would be stupid, because then what's the damned NDA for? Also they don't have any obligations to make it public.
---
And no, this is not some hate boner for INIT. Among my "enemies" so to speak, I actually respect especially init and snuff a whole lot. The reaction from me would've been the same if suitonia broke the NDA.
---
But there is no question that Brisc rubal broke the NDA, and that both Pando and Shine knew, without letting CCP know. They all messed up, hence the bans.
---
 [Please](http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ari-Gold-Get-The-Fuck-Out.gif)
---
Well, the OP of that thread is init, so he might be mistaking the flames coming from his alliance.  Perfectly understandable.
---
Sounds pretty accurate coming from an inti pilot
---
oh wow your kidding me...... listen to him insted u mongo jesus fk.. he is center/left and he is mixed race.... as he said himself. ocasio cortez and her new green deal have really messed you up.

But where will my drama come from??
---
because you need acess to it to make it replace the existing buttons* and select the specific characters without needing to overcomplicate the script.
---
* yes I could inject the UI process and change it that way but its way too needlessly complicated and people actually get banned for doing that.

If you were bumping then you were not moving very far.  It might have shown some normal speed for a split second but in reality you were almost at a dead stop.

Interesting. I haven't seen said Xenophobia except for one idiot on a fleet a few weeks ago who was roundly panned by the other 50+ individuals when he said something stupid. Willing to be the \~2% xenophobic idiot quotient is fairly standard across alliances

Hey that was just Jintaan. Don't put that evil on the God-fearing people of Providence.
---
He's *also* a lawyer. And violating an NDA as a *lawyer* is a big deal.
---
oof
---
fucked them didn't ya
---
err, do you think they send the code to your machine in the native language instead of a byte code/asm? you know those are not trivially converted back to their original form and in most cases its actually impossible to do so right? and you know that to recompile it you gotta do it to the rest of the eve chain for it to work right?
---
and that's before even getting into the fact that most of this code is server side so odds are you're not even exposed to it.
---
i know you're the hacker known as 4chan and all but at least try to make it believable
---
it does certainly look splendid
---
He's multiboxing tails
---
You never realize just how long the wait is between the last Naz post and the current one. Thank you for ending the torment
---
Except his real life is a lawyer. A lawyer breaking an NDA is kind of an issue. I know everyone focuses on the whole lobbyist thing, but let's not pretend him breaking an NDA isn't a big deal here.
---
It's pretty funny considering the sigs and corp I'm in have been foaming at the mouth for this ... and near as I can tell couldn't care less about the "why". Main important factors seem to be:
---
A) They are nearby (thank god)
---
B) They generally put up a fairly fun fight (dropping supers on 5-man gangs not-with-standing since that is par for every major alliance these days) 
---
C) They are nearby
---
I can't think of better qualifying traits for the perfect "bad guy" to my "good guy"

The only thing better would be if PL moved back in next door. Ya'll still owe me for the hassle of moving my crap out of the North when I came back after you evicted us while I was busy winning EvE after WWB.  ;)
---
^^^ you win sir.

Endured and still kicking! I actually quit EVE for a month last year, but you know how EVE has a way of becoming part of your life and roping you back in.

I started learning Korean and subbed back up to join a Korean Corp. Nothing better than playing a world wide game and having instant access to native speakers while studying the language doing something fun. I got a chance to meet some of my Korean corp mates in Seoul while visiting there in December and had a blast
---
I wish they'd change the environment, rather than trying to nerf ships, as nerfing ships to effect the large groups will almost always hit the smaller groups more.
---
I'd prefer asteroid belts and ratting sites respawned at an increasing delay the more they are used. Which would force larger groups to have to spread out, and smaller groups can probably stay the same, some medium groups would be stuck in the middle, but can probably manage.
---
I spent a few months in goons, their organisation is amazing, I was impressed, though seeing 25 rorqs in a belt, under a near impenetrable umbrella really drove home the imbalance to me.
---
Did he know them and trust them IRL? The difference here is the RL aspect imo. Anything just in game can be considered "that's eve".
---
No need to be sorry! If anything I'm forever grateful to you guys for exposing it all to me and saving me potential worse headache (irl).
---
I’ll be consulting with the CSM ahead of time, so I know what’s getting nerfed or not

Actually you called the guy a sociopath.

Wasn't everything that CCP have consistently fucked up over the years?

And that too, which he is. We had mutual RL friends from school and after telling RL's about it I wasn't at all surprised to find he burned people in similar ways.

I'm sure you were pretty sketched out the first time we met irl. It's crazy how small of a world it is. I met BlackHarb1nger irl because we were in the same 80 man pirate corp (The United) and our power went out at same time camping the Rancer gate. We both got back onto coms when power came on and it turned out we lived only a couple of block away irl.
---
Not even the first time I randomly met an EVE player irl who was in the same corp. Hyjack's story definitely takes the cake for this:

Great read although not so great ending.  I only ever got into Eve because an RL friend convinced me to try it.  He doesn't play anymore, but I trust him a zillion percent so if he ever did something like this to me, I'd be done with him too. Eve is a strange, but glorious place. Thanks for sharing.

WE DID IT REDDIT
---
Really? Like an eve honeypot/honeydick?
---
Yes, I don't think we disagree on anything here. My point was that he can't sue for defamation solely on the fact that they posted his (technically their) characters name and said he was banned from the game based on breach of NDA on their website, since he agreed to allowing all of that upon launching the game, just like the rest of us.

No I understand you, but I'm saying that he's a professional bullshitter and CCP, like any other company has a team of lawyers on standby for this kind of stuff. I don't get why people have this impression  that it's just random guy calling these shots. These are real life legally binding contracts and need a legal team to create verify and examine any infringement.

I honestly don’t see any difference, if I didn’t find out through reddit about the nerf, I wouldn’t know about it.. Still getting same ticks too
---
What’s he the victim of again? Nobody has done anything to him. He broke an NDA and is being removed from his video game position for it.

Is he in frat? Supplying them with capitals?

He also beat them in video games?

Curses!  I woulda got away with it, too—if it weren’t for you meddling kids!

Consider yourself lucky to find out his true character before you entrusting him with bigger things IRL.

Tldr- there is no difference between using video game mechanics to spy on people in a world of make believe pixels vs being invited in to their home outside of the game and betraying someone's hospitality and genuine real friendship.

Fun Fact: A scorpion navy issue and rokh have the same scan res as a niddy and only like 6mm behind a thanny.
---
These battleships in their current state are expected to use SEBOs and sig amps to get higher scan res, which means sacrificing tank just like your carrier example. Except a carrier's base EHP is triple of those battleships.
---
Hell, you still get highslot damage mods (FSU) and tank mods (links). Batlleships dont get any of that and your base EHP is already higher.
---
So why should carriers get special treatment to tank and hi slot x5 SEBO's (with no penalty) when those battleships dont get the same benefits?
---
turned out it was just a tarp
---
Many of us believe pgl has war on us just because he is jealous of noraus's black cards. However, the truth is more and more Chinese are used to play games with their cards and this game is much cheaper than many other games, for example, Japanese mobile game, FGO.
---
Thanks to the strong economy and Chinese yuan, our credit cards perform much better than before. Is 70k dollar a year a huge number? Sorry, it may be big but not huge.
---
And to be honest, titan, the strongest ship in this game, is very easy to build, much easier than T2 building. Selling Plex and buying injectors or just buying characters can solve the skill problem. The only problem seems to be the ore. But, as everyone knows, rorq is another imba thing.
---
Believe it or not, I alone build about 15 Titans and 40 supers in this 6 months, even export some to lowsec and drone lands. There are many bigger builders in detorid.

Two guys from the East of my country were (are?) IRL friends and have played many, many games together. Mostly MMOs. They are grown men with families and full, rewarding, happy lives outside of Eve.
---
Power struggle over privileges and roles in our small (&lt;20 ppl) corp got SO BAD that these two dudes went "friends-off" IRL. They used to BBQ at each other's houses in the summer. Their kids know each other.
---
All because one of them took up Eve later than the other and had no patience to learn or form a role for himself. Other guy didn't help the situation much because he would basically belittle his friend over our shared chatroom for being a newbro.
---
Buddy took everything from the hangars, wallets, and fuel storage that he could access and bounced. I don't blame him. The conversations got maaaad nasty!
---
Maybe they just weren't meant to be lifelong friends IRL after all. It really sucks all that tension came to a head over a stupid spacegame.
---
How can someone deny what they don't know they are accused of?
---
Bird Law has been invoked. Strap in boys, we're going to Mexico.

Me too, for reading that far
---
I can't remember who exactly was involved, but I distinctly remember the drama storm around at least two instances of an EVE honeypot/honeydick over the years.  So, yes, that has happened.

I am far from a PL sympathizer. I dodged a PL hotdrop from a spy in my alliance by literal seconds.
---
I think what OP is saying is, he would not scam or double cross a RL friend and expected that in return. I have people I feel I would trust IRL in the game but  if one of them betrayed me in game in this way I'd just give them crap for it and not trust them in EvE anymore. Would still be friends with them.
---
Is it now healthier that only large coalitions can do it? That and carrier ratting, which now is only worth doing with a super?
---
P.S. I never liked Rorquals, I believe they are a bad idea to be multiboxable but further restricting them to large coalitions is even worse IMO.
---
&gt; Which would force larger groups to have to spread out, and smaller groups can probably stay the same, some medium groups would be stuck in the middle, but can probably manage.
---
Smaller groups won't stay the same if they're kicked out of space by the larger groups and medium groups who need more space.

The narrative that one entity in the game is nothing but botters and to go to war for that reason creates more than one loser:
---
It forces everyone in Legacy to act against this entity. And they all will look bad if they fail at this holy crusade and cannot completely eradicate "the botters".  
---
At the same time, it makes everyone look bad who flies with the accused.
---
Then it makes also CCP look bad "for letting the botters exist". 
---
And in the end, the whole of Eve looks bad to the uninformed outsider who cannot differentiate.

There’s an integrity check anyways. The script comment was dumb I admit. So was my further comments on it. But honestly why even say that you’d need the code?

---
Null is big and often empty, but there isn't enough room because it isn't divisible in arbitrary ways. When large alliances grow they eat entire regions, because holding less than a region is strategically terrible. And many of these strategic zones are either multi-regional or can't be held without coalition-level allies. If you look at years worth of influence maps you can see areas where the patchworks never last long and large color blobs always snap back.
---
Nullsec has a bunch of natural borders, blocs tend to expand until they hit one.
---
wow is even cheaper than that i think they got 1 expansion per 2 years,and the sub is cheaper than 15.

Dude, what are you fucking complaining about. I used to mine in Hulks. 30-40 Hulk fleets. If we were lucky we had an Orca. No. Wait. We didn’t have an Orca back then.
---
When the Orca came in, that was a massive improvement. If you were in a specialised crew there’d be one guy who would have a Rorqual. One guy. If he logged in.
---
When one neut showed up in system *everybody* hauled their ass back to the POS. That’s what you did.
---
You have very powerful exhumers now. Back in the day [2008] the Hulk was the behemoth of mining ships. Barges were laughably inadequate but until you trained for exhumers, that’s what you flew. Barges, much unlike to day, had 0 tank. If you sneezed in one you blew out the bulkheads. And their holds were -tiny-.
---
Now you have all those sexy ass ships to mine with and it’s still not enough. Now they have fleets of Rorquals. We were lucky to see one.

---
Ugh ... what a mess CCP have made.
---
It never should have gotten mining drones.  CCP violated their own long-standing rule of "No ship shall ever mine more than a Hulk!"
---
It is a private company, and it is a game.  There was a contractual agreement between the two parties.  Neither has to "prove" anything.  If CCP has sufficient reason that THEY believe indicates he did something, then they can take action, and they don't have to prove it to anyone.  They also probably will not say anything else about it, because the only way they can "lose" in this is if they run their mouth and put information out there that could then be disputed, twisted or whatever.
---
&gt; I'll probably go back to orca + 2 exhumers combo again 
---
Good, that's how it should be if you can't defend rorquals tbh

Will you pls marry me?

It really depends on what he says in a filing.  They wouldn't just throw it out because he's a US citizen.

Pretty annoying you spent resources to change the hangar again yet you STILL can't spin supers.
---
&gt;  I wonder if the community that surround this game exhibit it so much because the game gives an opportunity for it to emerge, or if the people in the game are disproportionately antisocial or unsocialised that they tend to behave that way.
---
The former. People can (and often do) literally use EVE as a training grounds for all sorts of behaviour they wouldn't dare to exhibit in real life - but then inevitably some bits of it would spill over to said real life. I've noticed it in myself back when I was still playing - nothing dramatic, just a bit more heartless than before (or after) EVE times.

I DEMAND THE EVEMAILS!
---
If you switch to and Orca and several exhumers that just generated a more target rich environment. Looks like the nerf worked to me.

I remember when GOTG was collectively raging with their entire super fleet on the gate demanding we jump and fight:
---
  "Too busy, watching Vily eat hotwings"
---
  Then we jumped the other direction
---
Shut up and buy this doctrine ship that will only be pinged once.
---
That's not how nullsec works. It's big and often empty, but outside of a very few select zones, one group already has control over it and won't cede that to anyone, even if it's inconvenient or they aren't using it to its full extent.
---
I appreciate the effort in this shitpost
---
Personally I don't think it's that clear cut, looking at an alliance level, null is a nice patchwork, at a coalition level, sure, large blobs, but there are plenty of medium sized groups in there. Smaller groups I wouldn't expect to appear on that sort of map, they either fly under the radar, or are renters.
---
I've also heard, no personal experience, that even the larger blobs have struggled to secure 2 regions. And spreading resources thinner might allow the larger guys to take more pot shots at each other, which I hear is something lots of people want, eg content.
---
Objection your honor! Hes badgering the witness!
---
"Conspiracy theorists" are right more often than you'd think, in a lot of things.  A lot of times conspiracies come from people actually looking at things and realizing the things don't quite add up, using basic reasoning skills.   A lot of times they're considered conspiracy theories because the average idiot lacks said reasoning skills.

I came here to say "Well it's just a video game; a good IRL friend, I feel, can totally backstab you in a video game and it's just as if you guys were playing any competitive sport; whoever wins, wins.  It shouldn't affect your friendship."
---
Then I read the last paragraph...he invaded your home!  That crosses a line!
---
Then I read the whole story and I'm conflicted.  He didn't really invade your home; he came at your invitation.  AND, you admit your obsession with the game was unhealthy and that you were letting it ruin your mood and your real life.  
---
If you guys were playing fantasy football or something, and he used knowledge gotten from you to do some shenanigans in the league, would it be horrible?  I dunno.
---
This one is weird.
---
I'm kind of amazed what people will believe with no evidence. People who presumably live in less superstitious areas of the world, with high technology, universal education, etc.  
---
If it wouldn't pass for evidence in an actual court, it's not evidence. There is a reason we have the standard of innocent until proven guilty and it's not a technicality, it has to do with the fundamentals of how you can fairly and accurately enact criminal punishment. Sure, this is a game, it's not as important, it's not 'criminal' and it's a private company, so these things don't matter as much as proper evidence in a real life infraction, but it still remains true that evidence is important for establishing guilt and it's still better to reserve judgment or assume innocence until you've seen some proof.
---
I don't even tell my friends my Reddit account

I'm not confident with CCP releasing random bits of customer data because it's used as evidence.
---
Like do you want your credit card number on their website? I personally prefer to keep that data between me and CCP and the company that issued the card, a threesome god intended.
---
I like a good narrative, tbh. It's like low-key RP that I don't have to work at or be invested in.
---
The only time they really become problematic is when people actually believe them

One step closer to real p2w.

I mean all it's gonna do is CCP will then move on to just banning and removing people from the CSM and saying there removed, without giving us any reason would you prefer that?

I do enjoy these. I very much like the detail put into it

The nerf was designed to target Rorquals directly, not every other mining ship indirectly. You shouldn't need a friggin supercap umbrella to be able to fly Rorquals. If they died more often but were cheaper and didn't require stupidly expensive drones then it would be fine.

If they have solid evidence, why not just show it? Hell, why not show it to the accused? In any actual punishment context in the real world, even in many cases in the medieval world, the accused had a right to know what they were accused of and to review the case against them. When CCP can't even match the more enlightened cases amongst MEDIEVAL law, that's pretty bad.

Before someone goes "lmao this isn't criminal justice", I'm aware, but the principles of being able to defend yourself don't change.

&gt;Do you even know how the EVE client is built?
---
no, that's why i'd need the code
---
&gt; But honestly why even say that you’d need the code? You’re going to be unable to connect anyways because you won’t be able to recompile even if you had the code into something the client would accept.
---
"the code" of course includes the build scripts and specifications, and if I have those then yeah odds are I would be able to compile it and connect to the server. And even if for some reason I didn't it would still be enough to make a solution and send to ccp, you know the entire premise of this discussion.
