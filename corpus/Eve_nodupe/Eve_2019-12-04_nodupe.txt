I live in a WH. No asset safety.

I think mainly we play for the people; the friends we've made through this game. But also because EVE is one of the only stories gamers can be a part of that is continuously changing. It's one of the only games out there with major consequences, where one person can make a major impact that everyone hears about. There are a number of other things that set EVE apart as well. The real time economy is fairly unique to EVE. The politics, as far as I know are unique only to EVE. Lastly it's a great feeling to be part of a tribe of players that can shape the game world around you.

I don’t get why its 2.5 days CCP for the hull timer? Would not 7 days hull timer be better that way people can chain things between weekends.
---

---
For example, I’m attacking a citadel timed for 13:00 (Chinese TZ). I would ref it on a Thursday or Friday for a Saturday or Sunday exit on the armour. I will then contest the armour timer on Saturday / Sunday + or - 3 hours on 13:00. This is outside my alliances TZ which is for the most part EUTZ. Say we win the armour timer on a Saturday and the hull timer generates on a Tuesday around 13:00 + or - 3 hours.
---
I’m at work IRL around those times the timer will exit and so are most my alliance comrades. Should we not be able to have a go at killing the structure outside our TZ on a weekend?
---
Hope this makes sense.
---
Didnt think the drop was that loud lol
---
you aint gettin my 15 grand, gotta blap me first &gt;:3
---
&gt; he is putting his money and effort
---
Tbf these kind of abstract philosophical points are moot with respect to citadel balance. You can talk about defenders' right to pick their own time. I can talk about attackers' right to play the citadel bashing game at their own time. The game not being a job is equally valid for the attacker.
---
What should matter instead of abstract principles is whats currently happening in the ecosystem. Do too many or too little citadels die? It looks the latter to me; therefore balance should change for attackers' favor.
---
I don’t know. Feels like too much attacker freedom. Coming from someone that’s always the attacker. We get to choose the days, and basically roll the dice. With some planning you can get it outside their TZ with 3 hour deviation. People will stay up late, **most** can’t skip work early. So for example, let’s say my Corp is U.S. east-west TZ. We set our timer for 8pm CST. Aggressor decides to roll the dice and see. They’re entirely EST. The timer rolls back 3 hours. That’s 5pm CST. Assuming most people get off work at 5, that means the only TZ that is available is EST. They just TZ gambled into wiping out your home, and there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.

Yes this times a million.

If Legacy compacted itself into 2-3 regions, you would have a TON of space opened up for smaller groups to take advantage of and grow in. That's not a problem. Especially if resources aren't so dense in an area that you don't run into scarcity issues.
---
I fail to see a problem with a group that couldn't beat VOLTA in 20 minutes of forming not being able to wantonly mine in rorquals. I live in sov null, and I know I don't have a super umbrella to save me. So I make money in a different way.
---
What? Pred was late? Audible gasp.
---
Existing structures remain unchanged, If the adm goes up after you've anchored a structure it also remains unchanged. I got this information from your quote btw.

You don't need to be a hardcore player to learn how to bring a decent counter comp.
---
He told you yes. Most likely there is something you don't know, that you're supposed to discover by yourself.
---
I can basically just give Korean advice: Don't get shot and you will be fine. In T5s you get 70% optimal range reduction about 1/2 the time, so that gives you a lot of survivability too, and its impossible to get 30%. In T4s you can still get 30%s, which pose a much bigger threat than 50% in a T5 IMO.
---
A first person shooter is more popular than Eve?
---
Color me shocked.
---
Destroyers: Cormorant
---
Cruisers: Moa (or Tengu)
---
Battlecruiser: Naga
---
Battleship: Rohk
---
All work plus more. Caldari is cool. What other people are saying is the weapon systems, hybrid turrets and beam lasers, are the longer range. And typically with sniping platforms you'll be sitting still for better tracking. So speed isn't a factor. You might be referring to being kitey. In which case you'll want a different set of ships.
---
I like this.
---
None of those things are mutually exclusive with VOLTA asking to blue test at one point
---
We were already in snakes...you decided to run feroxes against them.
---
why we still here??? just for suffer????
---
Super's can only dock at KS's right?  So is the danger mostly on that point in addition to the fact that they're actively hunted (still, maybe or are they kinda ubiquitous at this point?) that makes moving them so dangerous?
---
This doesn't do anything. Great work ccp.
---
People defend their structures if it within their power to attempt to do so, regardless of what assets are in it. Couple that with jump freighters and the time between initial RF and final, it is easy to evac assets when you're active. So in its current form asset safety helps players who take a break and return later. What it doesn't do is stop groups fighting.

Market trading should not be on mobile
---
Why should PI and market trading be put on mobile client??
---
PI takes a few minutes to update. Market trading requires updates to remain competitive. Why should you have 24 hour access?? If you are unable to do either of those things it’s time to find something different. 
---
Mining you can at least be killed in space. 
---
To have access to market trading on a mobile device is a terrible idea.

make an alt and throw it in one, the game's completely different, dude. Hell, use your own buddy invite, get the 1M SP and put it into the Magic 14 or a specific cruiser like an Osprey Navy Issue, scan relic sites for ISK and go nuts with 70M ISK Cruisers in small gang shenanigans.
---
&gt; And these guys hold your credit card numbers....

This is just regex matching. A good implementation if anything, just a coincidental matching string.

People who want no asset safety are free to go to wormhole space. It is the same as no local, if you don't want local go to space that doesn't have it. You don't want new space you want to change the space people already live in to fit your wants, and you don't care how the people who play the game care about it. So instead of cheering for CCP to ruin someone elses game to meet your desires how about you ask for them to add space you want?
---
I just came to this came from a CSGO player normally, and I can say that this game is easily the most mind blowing thing I’ve ever had the chance to play. 
---
It’s incredibly niche and nothing will ever compare to this game. I’m 7 days in, and I completely understand why someone would get lost in this game for years. It’s almost dangerous.. love it
---
Or better:
---
Make an alpha Jita alt, that has a script, that whenever one of your bots are convoed, initiate private chat with a random station denizen, and copy+paste the texts from goodie-two-shoes. The jita dude answer, the gatecamper replies, that his money hasn't been doubled, despite the promises... Oh boy! Just let them fight!

I mean sure, Muninns resist Lasers but then once the ADC is off the table Muninns are made of paper (compared to 10MN Legions)

Wet is a state of being, Water (generally) is in a liquid state of being. Things get wet, water is a liquid that makes things wet and is itself not wet.

I really enjoyed reading your comment. My friends also hate me at parties when I bring up the topic of water not being wet.

Can you tell me how to abandon my family? Need more time for eve

10 days out of 20 you were waiting for an answer from KF. You used skill injectors which run around 800m each to accelerate into a ship on what, your 6th day in game or so?
---
How many injectors did you use total, how did you even know what they were at a week in game, and why would you use them to get into a ship that nets 25m an hour return? 
---
Since a new player cant earn injector money in game out the gate i have to guess you bought the injectors with cash at a third party vendor.
---
How much cash did you spend buying injectors from a third party?
---
Except they didn't actually. They realised figures on bans without specifying what the bans were for.
---
Use Google.

Can you se your time spent outside of steam launcher?

---
&gt; So can you link me an example of CCP banning a CEO that was falsely framed for RMT?
---
That's not my argument, that's the dumbshit statement you came up with comments ago to try and mischaracterize what I said. It's your out, to act as " I'm not actually retarded ". of course, you just made a simple mistake and the tasmanian devil of stupidity that follows was simply because of that stupid mistake.
---
In actuality you simply puppet mastered me. 90's aol chatrooms could have never prepared me for how hard you owned here today. Mastermind status surely.
---
I play EVE because I've spent so much time playing already that I can't bring myself to stop.
---
mate just look into  hacking and scanning and dont waste your SP to inject into wellfare ships.
---
mining is lowest pay and even a rorqual only gets a third of a fulltank supercarrier... mining is so popular because you can upscale it with minimum effort and multibox several rorquals at a time.
---
Actually, this kind of stuff is sent to QQ all the time. Obviously, this doesn't reflect well on Chinese Eve communities but most people don't do this and it is what it is. Whether or not a screenshot of a chat will make CCP take action or be concrete enough evidence that RMT is occurring is another matter that I don't even have a clue about.
---
Yikes
---
&gt; How do you separate this from me setting up the ceo. Like if someone reimburses or buys a super fleet and I get a super or anything - if it looks this much like RMT anyhow and I'm a spy or different chinese faction this would be a great opportunity to yell RMT to get the leadership banned out 
---
And im telling you CCP would be able to spot that. But you just really like sounding super spastic dont you.

Hi just wondering is there any way to stack resources ? Or is the functionality not there yet ?
---
Untill it turns into dust.
---
The problem with crying fake news is that those who are inclined to ignore the factual background behind allegations simply have a convenient soundbite to hide behind.
---
Sort acting incredulous about such a preposterous idea does on first glance appear plausible, but if you examine the actual evidence, the opposite is actually true: by sheltering RR, and by trying to suck every dick in the game to bring more blues to protect RR, he is creating a botting haven.
---
Coupled by the recent Iron Crown move to join them in Branch (Iron Crown are renowned botters and RMTers), it's pretty obvious what the truth is.
---
The only question then is whether Sort is in fact: (a) complicit, (b) ignorant, or (c) completely fucking oblivious.
---
I dunno getting a warp in on a fleet hiding in a safe spot is pretty fucking rad.

18:42, the start of the krab uprising due to broken spawns... in years to come we'll be having flash backs of this exact moment
---
For a new player I'd say Tengu is definitely way beyond their capabilities. Cormorant is a good starting ship for both pvp and pve content.
---
I would like to see citadels in low power for X number of days/months just blow up and drop everything, like in wormholes. They have no power for shields to protect against radiation and micro roids. A simple mail to everyone with assets when it goes into low power and again the week before it will dump everything.
---
If you are going afk for a long time then either fuel them for long enough so even if they blow up asset safety kicks in (think it should be a manual thing not automatic on blowing up but that is another story) or move your shit somewhere safe before hand!
---
You should more make an article about : why do we stop eve?

So probably in the next half hour.

That fort is 2 jumps from TRI sov.

Coalition alliances in a fight on the same side is batphoning now?  
---
TEST being blue to half of eve as well so..   
---
Content is ~~destroyed~~ generated. It was a fun fight, as Jesbar said, fun without no-one outblobbing the other party.   
---
Looking at the amount of alliances is basically a little bit giving the idea of a batphone fan fest, but no one was batphoning in a reeeee type of manner.   
---
Or how fudge should I know, I press just F1..
---
I already explained this once but I’m gonna say it again for everyone else’s benefit. 
---
If they set their timer so that a -3h roll makes the timer come out while they are at work, then they set their timer wrong. If it rolls +3 and they aren’t prepared to stay up past midnight for one special night to defend their structure then they aren’t putting in the required effort to defend the structure. 
---
It’s sad that people aren’t prepared to stay up a little bit later for one rare evening, this game is hardcore, that’s what makes it great. There are plenty of ways to play the game on safe mode, even null sec has npc stations.
---
Yeah so complex pvp when people need to activate 8 keybind at the worst... with 60 APM at the best.
---
It broke yesterday too, but. I think it sorted itself without reboot
---
spoken like someone who'd rather let other people make pvp easy for him than actually take initiative
---
And it's a good feature.  Just change the name of that unfortunate skin.
---
Alternatively, you can get a worm and solo t1 filaments. It's only ~40 mil/hr, but much less risky, and for much cheaper than a gila.
---
Yeah for some reason I thought I meant deleting Indy core as well - my bad.
---
I trained mining rorqual char, tried twice - normal mining, moon mining.      
---
Never did it again.      
---
ps. Still remember when i talked to Warr and Globby about using bombers to gank stuff as they have nice alpha for jita 1.1 sec stat.         
---
They told me that it is expensive ... month later globby started to hyperdunk.
---
This feature already existed in Osmium (the older people in here will remember) and I personally loved it. 
---
Also, I admire the fact that there's “Microwarp” in “Malediction Crown and Swords SKIN (Permanent)”.
---
Nah just more involved drone mechanic, probably be interesting to have all dones have more active control. Would limit afk drone boating.
---
with the app eve droid or eve nova you can, I dont know which one of those had that feature tho
---
This thread isn't about Goons or Init. Care to take another stab at a pathetic meme insult?
---
We are talking about a single shard PVP based MMO.  You can't balance around the little guy when the main draw and reality of the concept is the large scale; leaving the large scale broken causes the game to die, as we are seeing now.
---
If they as common as people say in Branch, CCP might be waiting to do a ban wave and just purge the whole corp from the game.
---
 Quick note for people.
---
If you’re running into a bug, try bug reporting it from within Eve.  
---
That gives CCP more logs from your client, meaning they have a better chance to actually run the bug to ground.
---

Well now people just need move a bomber over there and camp the POCOs
---
Thanks for actually staying to fight. I hope your boys had fun. Ours did!
---
This but unironically.
---
r/evejobs
---
I think you are wrong in one assumption: 
---
You kill the shield, it adds +1day, and searches for the next available time, and THEN applies the +/-3hrs RNG.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
War starts Sunday at 00:00, you bash before the set timer e.g. 3:00 (shield has not timer), reinforcement is at 2:35. So it adds +24hrs, 2:35 on Monday. Next available time would be 3:00 Monday. (if reinforcement would be at 3:25 it would come out for armor at Tuesday 3:00) Then it applies the jitter -/+3hrs. Making the timer for armor at Monday 6:00 (most extreme example). Reinforcement happens at 7:00 monday.
---
Now, at 7:00 monday, 4.5days are added: Friday 19:00, which then looks for the next possible set timer, which is again, 3:00 on saturday.
---
Therefore, last timer is on Saturday 3:00 (+/-3hrs)
---
Maybe you already realized, the 1.5days, 2.5days and 4.5days make sure that the next timer will always be 2, 3 or 5 days later. Except you manage to have a 9 hour long fight ( 0.5days=12hrs/ 12hrs -3 hrs from jitter=9hrs of fighting). Since the time is always the same for both, armor and hull, there is little that can be tricked around this.
---
Shutdowns or Connection Losts ?
---
Weird hope your phone autocorrected Nyx with Police Skin.
---
Probably related to the coming lack of downtime in some indirect way
---
I don't think too many people are going to be interested in helping monetize your retardation.
---
so isent it prety bad for a 10k+ player aliance to get 20 ppl in? just proves ppl in test/goons only is there to make isk and then they leave for pvp corps when they have had 1 real fight
---
&gt; So, practically, if I'm trying to sell some goods I should sell it to a BO only if the BO is unusually highly priced. When that's not an option (which will be most of the time), I should instead put the goods in a SO only if the current lowest SO's are around or above the EP. Sure I could sell them lower than EP to move them faster, but EVE rewards patience so I'll probably bide my time until I see a good opportunity, which will be easier now that I have another avenue to move goods (i.e. SO's).
---
It all depends on how worth that difference in margin between the BO and SO is to you. Unless you invest a lot of skillpoints into trading you may end up losing a good chunk of that value to taxes anyway if the margins are close enough and you will run out of market order slots if your goods don't move quickly so it does make sense to sometimes sell to BOs. 
---
The Estimated Price is somewhat tied to what players are paying too, so it *is* possible for that estimate to shift over time to either increase or decrease. It's better to treat it as a ballpark estimate and not an absolute. You can check the market history of an item going back weeks or months to see what it has sold for in the past so you can see if it's trending up or down. Sometimes it makes sense to hold on to an item until it increases in value, but it's possible that you're holding onto items that are trending down in value over time.
---
Yep, if they removed that POS's would be able to warp and take gates
---
... or someone who knows how most pvp player get to experience pvp.
---
Well we have to ban all around good guys like gigx that emotionally overreact to a complete asshole screwing him (and a few hundred people) over. But we cannot throw out thrash that rl-doxxes people and has the impertinence to claim he never would harbour Botting/RMT while everday people receive Mails from CCP thanking for reporting Bots in Branch/Deklein/Tenal/Fade and the RMT issues of RR /bunnyrabbit are well proven.
---
Except you keep banning players who disagree with you from your stream, so you can maintain your echochamber of thought..
---
:Bigthink:
---
Ffs 😂
---
I think the 6h window makes a little sense, to take at least a little control from the attacker and make it a more random TZ wise.  
---
Also I think the window fits pretty good to the 7 day hull timer. So you give the attacker the ability to choose the day, but don't give him the ability to choose (at least) a somehow perfect time frame.
---
If you use the new bookmark system you can control who can enjoy your christmas tree with an access list :)

NC is our last hope. Deploying to Branch when?

One of life's greatest pleasures was shooting a pos only to find out it wasn't stronted and that you were getting a kill mail.
---
Indeed it was amazing for it's time.
---
One step forward two steps back.
---
Can confirm, it's a ton of fun and good with with some support to tackle. I think probably one of the best times I had was GOTG had brought a 30 man corm fleet to ref our small tower in their space. I managed to harass them enough to get a kill and keep them from reffing the tower.
---
Heavy missile Hurricane?
---
Now I've seen it all.
---
then its just a normal bug then lol
---
I agree with this, it gives time to get help in, but not enough time for all of EVE to gather.

---
added to shoot on sight list
---
The system as proposed, 4.5 days (RF Mon/Tues, fights on the weekend), would work fine for small to medium size warfare. So at the least it would be an improvement for that.
---
You're going to get the 27min minimum 10% tidi regardless for fights over key structures in 0.0 for armor and hull. With the size of the coalitions in Eve these days, it's simply not feasible to roll their territory in anything shorter than a couple of months unless you manage a headshot in terms of a coup or 'Judge'-ment.
---
latex gang rise up
---
I will make sure that everytime i see karma fleet suggested again as newbie freindly corp that you guys are a bunch of cock suckers.
---
[removed]
---
lost in the message, but I strongly agree with bot/ADM repercussions
---
If I were King of CCP, if an account got banned for botting, whatever systems he was found botting in should have the iHUB just outright destroyed. Or at least on a 3 strike policy. 3rd ban = bye bye IHUB
---
Give defenders the time, give attackers the day boom balance done:
---
Allow citadels to be hacked on the shield timer. Hacker sets final RF day. Set a cooldown after hacked + cant be changed when damaged/rf.
---
Final timer set to next RF day thats 2.5 days+ later. If I want final timer on a weekend, and want to do armor on a weekend, I can do it. If defender timer is in my tz and I want to do armor on Monday and Hull on Thursday I can do it. Defender will always have tz and citadel defense advantage. Sounds pretty fair to me.
---
Beating up the retards at school and making a Reddit post about it. Shit man, I shove sticks in the wheelchair kids spokes but you don’t see me bragging about it.

Are there any guides for these sites out there? Are they somewhat difficult?
---
The first stage to solving your addiction problem is admitting you have one :)
---
Anyone else got armor timers on reinforced citadels freezed ?
---
Proposal, delete wormholes. Solved. PS. Satire.
---
In the context of smaller groups? Yes you're essentially correct, if someone wants to evict you then you're probably getting evicted. In the context of bigger groups who have enough members that they can roll on any day? The extra day is a buff.
---
OCHRE FIRST YOU FILTHY KRABS
---
Nah you can one-shot a c5-c5 hole with a carrier. And the polarisation from the old static doesn't carry over to the new static. Just jump through and jump back every 3 minutes. At his peak he got it down to less than 2.5 minutes per hole.
---
the one thing that pisses me off the most is that now we're expected to login to eve any day of the week... it's not like this aging community of 30+ year olds have carreers and families, right? 
---
Some of us kept weekend timers so that we could have good fights when most our corp members can be online. We could tell our families and work that we will be busy during "these four hours" so please don't disturb etc...
---
CCP needs to pay attention to our REAL LIVES and how they impact how/when we play. This change absolutely ignores that aspect of our lives, pushing us away from investing much in to the game.
---
Bad move, CCP.
---
i came here to post that
---
Wormholes can go back to their old ruleset, there really wasn't much that needed changing on these fronts there.
---
That is because it blooms your signature radius take a look at your simulated radius with them on and off.
---
Lmao
---
Why do you see being a cock sucker as insulting?
---
so...
---
are they blue to you now?
---
so the 50 test pilots dont belong to test hmm
---
Not to mention costing heavy missiles on a shop with only 3 launcher slots and zero bonuses...
---
Blue?? We're past that... Hurricane guy is now in Test High Command
---
Kiki needs a nerf, we got it.
---
They still have to join right? I can't just make a bunch of trees in providence and access list everyone so they are forced to see it
---
He ended up being chill in the end. Everything got off on the wrong foot and just snowballed from there. We talked like adults and all is well now.
---
SMA lives? Changing mother fuckin sides!
---
I remember when i was in PH and we staged out of geminate and goons drew a giant dick above our keepstar...good times
---
Sensor strength is separate from sig radius so your comment does not stand as factually correct. Now outside of skills and external command boosts also impact your sig radius in the same way as shield mods do.
---
&gt; (in structures we seem to call this TZ tanking, but we don’t with sov)
---
I think this is because it is a bit harder and more resource intensive to TZ tank as effectively as with structures. 
---
With structures, TZ tank is basically a couple setting changes to a menu and done.
---
With Sov, you still have the initial choice like structures do, but there is much more middle ground between successful TZ tanking and unsuccessful. Basically, how good a TZ tank is depends on the ADM, which requires regular effort to maintain, and allows an avenue for the attacker to influence the RF timing cycle. 
---
For example: an abandoned, low-power structure can TZ tank much better (4 hour exit window, soon to be 6) than a system which is rarely ever used (iirc up to 18 hour exit window).
---
You can definitely argue Sov mechanics as TZ tanking, but it pales in comparison to the ease of which structures do it.
---
Holy shit, you said something that's actually a great idea!
---
Thanks for all your work Avio, Im sorry that at this time that I've left Venal on anything but mission running alts but gotta go for greener pastures.
---
As for the Rorqual stuff, yeah it was pretty crazy, I was not expecting to have company on the Tatara grid that I was scooping. In hindsight, its really good that I brought a Rorq and not a JF to scoop it as the JF would have 100% died to that gang and I wasn't interested in losing a 2nd one inside of a month.
---
Downvoted
---
I was just there yesterday. Harassing people 2 jumps from there and never saw a gatecamp, or anything that seemed relevant to this discussion. What did I miss?
---
Very true, because if you run out of hull, your ship explodes.
---
I probably shouldn't say this, but you would be hard pressed to find a fleet where we don't have everyone multiboxing. If we dread bomb, 12 dreads are accounted for with 4 guys
---
What is the difference between this and the AT tornaments of past.
---
you can't overheat a module if one is repairing.
---
What are trees? Oh now I remember. It's an ancient life form that went extinct in the 23rd century
---
This is kind of the way I see it too. Everyone takes these discussions as if every group only has a single structure as their home. 
---
I get this can be rougher for those smaller groups that do have maybe only 1 home structure but I imagine such groups are a super small percentage of the population and this is a pretty clear application of Malcanis' Law.
---
I always had those issues.  Nice to see you are now able to profit from them too :D
---
It's almost as if there is a lot of interest in online tournament play but CCP doesn't want to expand on it at all 🤔
---
What? They specifically increased timer window with this change.
---
only in the same slot. repaering highs and overloading meds should work iirc

Collateral damage?

Bet you are fun at parties.

Remove from overview.

So this could go both ways depending on how the timer lines up with your schedule as a player. Personally I think that a 12h timer is more likely to go unnoticed. The don't log in for one afternoon and you ahve your kill. This is so circumstansial though. I prefer the pre-change 12h just because it means less effort on the part of the attacker in most cases.

In a system with 50 moons you CANNOT have 50 small belts per day. They have a minimum cycle time of like 6 days or so? Sure you could have 50 in 1 day or spread them out however you like, but moons don't create daily belts.

I LOVE THE BOWHEAD \*.\*

But now it is gone. And i went down with it. A good captain never leaves the ship ♥
---
Now i am in Utopia, forever.  The dreamland. Although it  is so dark in here, and cold :(
---
And i am all alone, in between the wrecks of my beloved bowhead, unable to escape. Damned to haunt this place forever \*sniff\*

Yes, I am talking about evicted without a fight instead of a fighting with the attacker. The ability to choose your defending days outweights the of extra defensive day. 
---
We have a multi hundred pilot alliance that could easily fight against any size of attack. But after the change I feel the risk of losing everything by simple not being able (work, holidays, etc.) log in my characters on weekdays is too much of an risk to keep defensive ships in the system.
---
Most reasonable adaption to this is just go from defended wormhole into assetless wormhole. Since the defensive fleet is much more expensive that few farming ships which you can just SD on the tether and proceed to log off for 12+ months with the rest of the valuables.

Clearly tl;dr for you
---
Calling us colalteral damage is hilarious considering my propsal can be implemented without even touching nullsec.
---
Thank you for the explanation!
---
I have had none of these issues. Still don't love the bookmark changes tho.
---
imagine using ingame chat in TYOOL 2k19.
---
You wormholers really are wild.
