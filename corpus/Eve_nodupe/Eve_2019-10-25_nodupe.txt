---
Yea for sure, this sub is overly negative nine times out of ten. I also understand that we shouldn't go 100% doomer on this sub as it will only hurt our playercount.  
---
But don't you think it is a bit disingenous to be like "i am sitting on my blue donut and i am having the time of my life" while everything else is on fire? It is such an ignorant stance to take wrt to the health of the game.

&gt;Not gatekeeping just geniuenly curious.

Shut the mwd off but keep the mwd bloom . BAM, useless solo, not that opressive and actually make them a force multiplier! Or, make them have a signature radius ADC, making them harder to kill while in combat situation for a little time. 
---
Just ideas!
---
About the only part I really agree with is that the new player is really poorly prepared for the world that they are entering. 
---
Overall I think the high sec mecanics strike a pretty good balance. A new player can easily spend months in game without hardly any worry of ganking.
---
This guy living in the future, he already has cat ears

There is a large difference between groups that PVE to PVP and groups that PVP to PVE
---
There will be dicks everywhere
---
Bumping mining barges would be somewhat more interesting. 
---
Also, if the player used autopilot, they can't wash the graffiti off for 48 hours. *"oops. reset the graffiti timer again"*
---
&gt;Plus they can work on more then one thing at once.
---
Maybe in an ideal world.  Not in the reality of this company.
---
So I’d this the same eve universe but played on mobile?  It would be neat to do mining or market stuff on my phone. 
---
But I don’t think I would want to restart...but in the other hand it would be cool to have the playing field restarted
---
I am familiar with the EVE lore. There is no reason a capsuleer shouldn't be able to get the same view if they wanted though like for fun because its a game.
---
Yes they do, and people will cut them some slack once they get to the point they should have been 5 years ago.  Still waiting for shield slaves to be announced (again) at Vegas.

That's some Culture shit right there.

Well, I hope that your sentiment is shared by the many, because ultimately NPSI has only been held up by passionate, dedicated people and has only done so at the peril of content given by CCP changes. Removing these dedicated people or causing drama for them is biting off your nose to spite your face. I did good things for spectre and NPSI as a whole.   
---
If like you say its community driven, why not have a vote, or strip all my roles and ban me, so I could not speak for myself. At least I opened any and all major decisions to staff and command, before removing without warning. Please understand what a dictatorship is, Spectre is now an oligarchy like BB, Unlike the dictatorship control Jayne had. Regardless, if this is the end of NPSI with spectre so be it. This contradicts my NPSI hub vision whereby all Public fleets are posted and shared, this impact is larger than SF. Secondly I'd like to say the ancients NPSI alliance is certainly not the conventional alliance. You want to talk to the other NPSI leadership who run it? I am ashamed of myself for not getting rid of this super drive with toxisity that some people possess in eve. At least I wont go down as the twat that ruined it for everyone.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish! o7
---
I think the thing we all failed to realize was that people join NPSI fleets to get away from the politics of nullsec and we were throwing them back in. That and PL wasn't paying us enough to really make that much of an effort.
---
I care. Sad times without u :'/
---
pve is trash in eve, yet the only thing left to do

hmmm

I will bring the supers only for you

Before Galmillistan - may be. But in the last two years - yes, SNUFF hadn't been involved in FW at all. Two years ago SNUFF left low-sec and hadn't fought anyone there for half a year, GalMil managing fine on their own. Then we came back to lowsec and deployed agains SC&amp;co, while GalMil abandoned FW and went to 0.0 on their own. Then we went back to 0.0. GalMil came back and CalMil just stopped fighting. The supposed "SNUFF involvement" of when CalMil stopped was imagined. As in "they may support GalMil, hence we won't even try". But in fact, the imagined "may happened" never actually happened. It may have happened if CalMil would escalate beyond subcaps and SNUFF would be free, but never actually did. The myth of SNUFF stopped people from escalating freely. But not from fighting. And don't go all "no one fights without escalating". Plenty of groups do. Some of them fought us, very succesfully as well.
---
IF you did less shit talking and more forming up for CTAs we might have actually been able to do something other than kick you off the couch you were surfing on.  We said we would hold the door open for WC to leave and we did exactly that even if we did have to nudge you out the door. Actions will always speak louder than words, we simply refused to be WC's scape goat to Krab heaven in OP. We have and will continue to, consistently, do exactly what we say we are going to do. Hope you enjoy your "nomadic" life style.
---
&gt;I said it was the best it's been
---
this is wrong, multiboxing 10 vnis or rorqs is not good gameplay
---
back 10 years ago PvE was far more rewarding and balanced
---
it works for some of them. for this one I really want it to have a disintegrator death star thing.
---
Calm down, miner.
---
There's significantly more PVE content than any other time in eve. Skill injectors catastrophically ruined eve by requiring CCP to have to balance for basically instant and unlimited scale.

There's nothing wrong with mining in highsec if that is what you enjoy doing or if in my case it is relaxing and something to do while you shoot the shit with others in game or in discord or mumble or whatever.  I enjoy doing small scale industrial stuff and providing basic ships for my corp. 
---
And let's be honest. How cool was it the first time you joined a highsec mining op that had an orca out with max boosts?!? I wanted to be that guy just to help the newbros and look badass in the Orca and now I am.
---
&gt;I do think provi did overthink it

Have you ever heard a guy talk about it in thinly-veiled references to CVA being Israel with Spectre being a bunch of terrorists who think they have some sort of noble cause but are actually just pawns of Iran/PL wanting to do some really bad stuff? No? Well here you go (audio recording link):  [https://forum.eveuniversity.org/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=113640](https://forum.eveuniversity.org/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=113640)

High Command.

I'm still waiting for those chaos things they promised. And those weekly changes to game mechanics. And harder gameplay. And something done to instant local intel if not total blackout.
---
Will we ever see the 2 second delay of action-to-resolution disappear?  It makes manual piloting feel sluggish and strange.
---
With the police pursuit skin released for the bus along with some other nice looking ones - I doubt the interbus would sell for much tbh. The nyx one would likely fetch a nice penny.
---
So, would you tell us how much isk we can extract from hs??

I had to quite Eve because of NoVac. I quite today as I am tired of the harassment. NoVac even went as far as trying to ruin another players Eve life just because he was my friend. NoVac is not a good corp.

The Skilling spree could work, but everyone has that right now.

It looks like a guy with a fake wide shoulder syndrome attempting to hug something... I wonder whether or not it will play in the game just the same.

I really hope that this will be Triglavian titan:  [https://lparchive.org/Freespace-2/Update%2023/img-8.jpg](https://lparchive.org/Freespace-2/Update%2023/img-8.jpg)  so trigs can steamroll drifters and make some dank drifter-inspired skins for our ships.
---
&gt;I sincerely hope they never add caps
---
iirc there was a phoenix shown in the alpha trailer.
---
Halo headkrab? Is that you?
---
Not so much anymore. Or at least, there are now way better options for AFK ratting.
---
Try to take a look at the Myrmidon, or if you have the skills and money, an Ishtar.
---
And the difference is?
---
You could reduce the amount of crystals you extract - either by moving the extractors off the hotspots or stopping the extractor for a day - it should even out then.
---
You can also launch them into the POCO and store them there, but that is a bigger hassle than simply stopping their extraction and burning through your current stock.
---
The optimal solution would be to increase your heavy metal extraction rate, but that is probably impossible.
---
That's formally known in the Darkness FC channels as 'The Jacob Dean Maneuvor'.
---
what the 2nd event? i have only daily log in one
---
Or even just resell it right there if you're even lazier
---
It would be sad to see you go. I have not been able to play very much lately due to RL, but it would be a real shame if I knew I would never lose another Sabre to your Hurricane while trying to hold tackle for the rest of a gang.
---
Why can't SF go back to what it was and just host a load of chill NPSI fleets with a mix of experienced and newer FCs and stop worrying about trying to be some "NPSI Hub" or w/e.
---
SF was always about giving fun and easy access PVP content with a good mix of options but I feel like you guys are more worried about what BB or everyone else is doing rather than yourselves.
---
Strip it back, stop using discord voice comms (because...yuk) and stop trying to promote all NPSI organisations in the game!
---
Are you ratting? like anomolies in nullsec?
---
Or running missions?
---
Wow - wrong post?
---
If you can run them very fast, they might be.

i can see myself

This happened in Provi a few years ago... was assume ... FC said 'uh oh' on coms and everyone knew...

How will it make a good structure basher? Its DPS? Because a T1 fit Naglfar already does about twice the damage cap of an astrahus, so you don't need more. And you're not gonna engage a fortizar because it will neut you out and kill you. So unless it has a crazy tank on it, it's still not gonna be good for structure bashing. 
---
It will be good in j-space if: 
---
 * It ramps up to considerably more damage than current dreads, so it can help break stalemates in heavy armor brawls
---
 * It has considerably less mass than regular dreads (just like the Leshak is lighter than most battleships) so you can get more of them through a wormhole and into a heavy armor brawl
---
 * It has more tracking (same as other triglavian ships) - again it becomes useful in heavy armor or ratting
---
Everyone wants something flashy to revitalize the playerbase
---
I just want tiericide finished
---
They cost barely double. If you cant afford that, maybe a 200mil battleship which youre putting at risk (low sp) isn't the right ship at the moment.
---
You are right, it wasn't meant for mobile... working on that.
---
Yeah, but when he can type why shouldnt he be able to defend himself? His post proved he can make allegations so it doesn't seem he has a cognitive problem?

Adding on that this is literal - you are barred from l4 and l5 missions as an alpha.

The Implication

Just stick to mining bud, it's probably the only thing you know fuck all about.
---
Some of you nerds need help
---
Don't salvage? You're losing a lot of income there man. It takes me 3 min to salvage it all with a noctis. Plus the drops themselves, with the surveys, I make anywhere from an additional 100 to 160 mill an hour.
---
The small screen and the idea of only playing the game while shitting are not the main issues for me, rather the fact that mobile games are designed and balanced in a way that ensures you can’t enjoy them without spending a metric fuckton of money on microtransactions.
---
thanks dude, appreciate it
---
Sad part is that this would be more fun than ever in current state
---
You won't get paid out if cloaked or if you are even just sitting 200km away. The payout works based on the damage you do. When I warp in my noctis with 2 or 3 left, a message appears saying that I was not part of the top 59 players that did damage, and he gets no payout.
---
200 km is 108 nautical miles
---
Every once in a while, but their overall trackrecord is a mixed bag with some really bad decisions and/or bad implementation/execution. I hate to criticize CCP so much as they have some good and hardworking people, but some things they did resulted in outcomes even a toddler could predict, for which they were warned but webt through with it anyway..
---
No it’s not, you are missing his point
---
Freespace 2 is still my all-time favorite

You can send stuff to this character

yeah I killed a couple at the start, didn't watch their range, and thought of the ONI hull bonuses when I read osprey to begin with, so I feel ya lol

As a member of a corp that left because there was no pvp at all from the alliance, this is is very true.
---
when the client dies ok, when its a desync ok, its all fine, but he warped off as his mach died, so ye
---
Having to hold Ctrl to select multiple entries in a field that is clearly only useful when you select multiple entries is bad. Please change it so that clicking toggles each individual field on and off. That would also solve the problems people have on mobile.
---
A 7th NPE revamp, obviously
---
we had really strange stuff happening during pvp with desyncs and rubberbanding since the 10th of october (Conduit bug)
---
Good times in fountain

Trust me when I say it's a lot better worded than if I had to type it up myself.

trig caps,  eve death is coming.

Gotcha. I tried my Tengu, got the piss neuted out of it by the elites in anomalies, I may need another fit in not sure. Waiting for an escalation I think it’ll do better there &amp; travel is much safer with it. Rattlesnake first now it’s impenetrable so it seems. Hoping to get a Golem moved out soon, will have to check my faction skills for a Typhoon.
---
correct, they would just repair and not shoot, but don't know how they select their targets, maybe just one person gets repaired

so when its RLY a bug its fine, but is for some guys hard to believe,

Smh why are the drama lamas so prevalent on this sub?
---
Obligatory "can I have your stuff?"   
---
Honestly, I'll give it a good home.
---
This is too good lol
---
You're trying to say that being an edgy, annoying teen is the only way to play this game if you like PVP?
---
Are you serious that's what you want to say?
---
Good idea. I would help , if I could, but I am no coder. :)  
---
Design wise though, you should get rid of that horrible font. Otherwise it looks promising...
---
I'd LMAO if the Vegas crowd just flat out boo'd the keynote
---
Holy fuck. I want this. It would be so insanely deadly to warp in on someone in a dscan immune ceptor.
---
*More CCP employers working in anti bot.  
---
*More community team members.  
---
*Regular small scale balancing passes. keeping an eye out what is a bit too strong what a bit too weak. (and don't decide by who cries the loudest on reddit but CCP should form their own opinion informed by a dialog with the players. needs more personell see point above)  
---
*Keep promises in general. Where is the tiercide? Where are the shield slaves?  
---
*remove attributes and give new players PG and CPU level 5  
---
*remove HAW guns  
---
*rework some aspects of citadels. There are several suggestions. My personal opinion there: No jump gates and cyno beacons on grid with an upwell structure. I think that athanors should be more like jump bridges too. No docking/tether only two timers. Would make it a) easier to attack a mining group b) fights over moons would happen more often.  
---
I could probably come up with much more but I guess that's already too much for once. In general eve is a good game. It's just that it could even be so much better.
---
Do it with 3 account warp in a no it’s with salvage drone after it’s cleared. It takes about 5-6 min to salvage a site with 5 drones.
---
Hey stop it!

Don't give people ~ideas~

Redo FW to bring in more pvpers and reduce bots.

Bingo. We have very few credit card warriors in our group. The *vast* majority of us rely on money made in-game to fund our PVP activities.

I doubt anybody would buy the interbus erebus at 10b, but it's a rare skin so who knows. The erebus has a lot of really nice skin options at this point, so the interbus one is kind of bland by comparison.

So true .... i cannot even fly one, or don't have any ability to get it out ... but 15M just to have it and by chance getting it moved, even if in 50 years the citadel might get blown up :D who knows
---
The massive decline of player logins even with free sp disagrees with you. And don't try to counter with bots because those just moved over to high-sec.

Making a mobile client for TQ would make infinitely more sense. You could market it exactly the same way and even charge for the app if you wanted.

Everyone who plays eve would use it. Plus you would tap into the mobile market.

nono my fella, we will treat you as everyone else, as im sure you want as would i in the same situation, Eve is a game, if you didnt enjoy your stay in a corp, then leave, you are free to leave at any time, clearly you were not welcome and ended up being kicked.

Do you have basic economic knwledge and know what sinks and faucets are in an economic system? And how it plays out if you buff the biggest faucet to explode by multiple 100% and meanwhile kill all sinks? That would answer all your questions ...

Given the sheer number of failed projects CCP has developed outside of eve online: Dust514, World of Darkness, project Nova, and the one that generated the most buzz, Eve Valkyrie (which had all kinds of bleeding edge momentum), what differentiates this from those projects?

That seems like an abdication of journalistic integrity considering what other game companies (Blizzard) have done recently. People should know what the company's partnership with a Chinese company entails so that they can make an informed decision about the products they use and buy.

You made the mistake of thinking salvage is loot. You loot the wrecks, you ignore the empty salvageable wrecks and move on.

Uhhh, you know ccp didn't sell themselves, right? Their shareholders sold them.

Or a ratatu they are good if he what’s yo make stuff

Warp in, drop mtu, kill rats, empty MTU, move on. If you want to salvage while you kill that's fine, but you made the same mistake the other guy did by thinking loot = salvage.

Problem with nergals is that they're a bit too much of a magnet though
---
pretty standard new-player sweatshop.
---
What? The botting servers I was in became dead or full of complaining. They didn't keep going or go to highsec at all.

It might have happened after a few more months.

Scree!!!

Valkyrie should have been a runaway success.

WoD ruined the company’s morale.

&gt;I miss the days where 3 to 5 man gangs were roaming null everywhere and wreaking havoc with bubble camps
---
Remove interdiction nullification from the game entirely.

Do they still stream keynotes on YouTube?

No-one here gives a shit about echoes.
---
They also had fatigue so nobody used them to go more that a single jump.
---
They were not nearly as overpowered as they currently are.
---
After we castrated them for daring to implement blackout, they're really going to have to pull something out of the bag for this one. Unfortunately they seem to be hyper-focused on Trig stuff as if it were the only thing in the world at the moment.
---
On one hand, oh shit what a deal. 
---
On the other. Witnessing a mistake that might end a career.

&gt;playing since 04

&gt;My play style is ... a high security player who likes the industry side of things and the occasional adventure into low or null.
---
&gt;Things such as new ships, new structures, or more chaos era stuff is about the only thing I want to see.
---
&gt;They need to make it harder to hold and let the alliances form true coalitions. So when you see a player and click him it's Corp/allliance/coalition on his tag.  **(NGL, this is a decent suggestion)**
---
&gt;Goons now next to impossible to conquer in this players opinion. So structures need a balance pass right? Or do they?
---
&gt;Just some crazy thoughts from a high sec player I know 😁

Not going to disagree with that, but moving them off citadel grids doesn't affect ability to move quickly with them. This isn't even the worst iteration of bridges which makes me laugh at some people (not you) who pretend it was harder in eves glory years.
---
Can confirm. When I was asked where I want to be born I said: Bruh hit me with that shitty eastern european start, I like it rough.
---
when they say they're removing all ISD's and replacing them with competent human beings i'll be excited.
---
I wonder if they will announce CCP Hilmar leaving/getting fired from CCP before or after Vegas...
---
Calling it now, New Symmetric redesign for the Thorax
---
I hope CCP announces shield slaves again. Fourth time is the charm!
---
Send it to me and I'll double it.

TEST komodo, please ignore?

Most likely you'd just get kicked out of Goon corp for "goonfucking" that term is so fluid it's practically liquid...
---
Plus one for being that guy.  Expected response from someone not willing to have a conversation about a game cause I play it different than you.  Fly safe!
---
Pussy.

Triglavian drones first.
---
Just a warning Be very carful of NoVac ( NVACA ) That corp will rob you blind if you ever get on their bad side. You wont ever get your clones out of the WH and they make it mandatory to have three different clone sets.  OMG you should see the ships they sell. One doctrine requirement is a navy scorpion. Then they sell it to you for 300 million of Jita. Heck of a scam lol.

Imagine being in Brave and talking down to someone like this dude.

“STaY cLaSSy” or some shit right?

Fuck right off with that elitist attitude man. He’s just expressing his opinion on a public opinion based forum.
---
love the 1440p, thank you.
---
Go out, stop living under Tests shadow and see how hard it is for you.
---
Because it’s a random sequence. Nothing like hacking but simple and easy to do in 5 seconds.

it is once you enter warp, not on button hit.

'No Dope' in game would love some donations as well :)

You're making yourself look like a massive tit, you should probably fuck off and calm down.

I completely agree that supercaps shouldn't be effective against subcaps. They should be anti-structure and anti-capital platforms. But I also really loved blackout. It reduced player numbers heavily, which obviously is bad for the game in general, but it made nullsec **a lot** more fun to roam. We saw caps dying at very high rates compared to both pre- and post-blackout, which again I think is super necessary as part of ending supercap proliferation.
---
As I said, I think it was a step in the right direction and was definitely working as alliances hadn't yet built workarounds when blackout was reversed, but that how it was done it would have eventually ended up hurting small corps more then the large alliances. However had CCP kept blackout and also added some sort of change to prevent permanent cloaked camping, or instead made blackout a delay (long enough to hide in, short enough it's not worth putting cloakers on gates) then it would have kept things dangerous for large and small alike.
---
"You wont ever get your clones out of the WH" ...youre in a wormhole corp
---
"they make it mandatory to have three different clone sets" ...implants are incredibly useful in fights
---
"Then they sell it to you for 300 million of Jita"  ...haul your own ships in then?
---
You sound incredibly unprepared mentally for wormhole life as part of a decent corp to be honest.
---
They should have gone for a 15/20s delay before appearing after jumping in. This would have shifted some window of opprtunity to hunters while keeping some window of escape and reaction time for alert pve’ers. Total Blackout was too binary in its outcomes, which eventually kills certain activities

That was over a decade ago. Let me repeat that. Over a decade ago. When the Promethean Titans were just introduced. Now we have thousands of Titans. That's roughly the same as the Amarr Empire has. In Lore they are stated to have a few thousand Promethean Titans and I think 3 confirmed Iapetus Titans. That's not a lot all considered.
---
Not to mention that their Fleet doctrine is terrible. Like, Flagship Avatar terrible that leads a Fleet of Capitals and Subcapitals. Honestly, it's more racial Kitchen Sink what they fly and nothing else. Nothing will really stop Capsuleers from wrecking them with superior tactics that they will 100% have.
---
I think that's a dude
---
Look at you being edgy today.
---
If they fixed FW I would resub. I had alot of fun there
---
Dude, capsuleers are immortal and prone to going insane. This shit is probably tame compared to what they would have.
