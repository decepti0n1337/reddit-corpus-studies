Cool, thanks! Not to make you do all my work for me, so no prob if you don't know, but any recommendations on a corp or finding a corp?

It can't be that hard to integrate the events of potential FPS game to EVE.
---

---
For example, if it was possible to conquer a citadel instead of destroying it by successfully boarding it, it would be as simple as to sent a a single bit (0-station was not conquered; 1 - station was conquered).
---
He even doubled down on strawmaning...
---
Pretty good watch if I don’t say. Bit long but I learned so take the upvote.
---
Find me the player who killed a titan in the last 5 years who honestly say it wasn't fun and interesting for them to kill regardless of how cheap it was for the owner to buy, I'll wait.
---
Yes it can do up to t2 in that current fit! I will have a t2 run up soon! Thanks for watching
---
canceling the project is wasting money?
---
no
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
And if you can't find them.  Hard to know where people are when there's no local to let you know where people live.
---
It's a fleet ship rather than small gang, look for devoter losses from any of the big wormhole corps for an idea of how it's usually fit.

You of course appreciate that almost all wormhole groups are &lt;&lt;50 people, and that most of them are barely taking their connections  to half mass after jumping back home, leaving plenty of mass left for a BC or HAC fleet, and as such your complaint about a fractured response fleet is somewhat farcical, given that as long as the fc and a proportionate amount of logi and dps makes it, you’re basically good to go.
---
I continue to maintain that dust should have been boarding parties launched at enemy supers, with objectives in the FPS game directly tied to the ship they board, like "disable doomsday" or "hold engineering for 5 mins to overheat shield hardeners"
---
Supers have bots defending with bot difficulty based on # of infantry units stored in the ship, and can contract defenses out to player squads if for example a large scheduled fleet fight was happening
---
Thanks for you nice words, I am putting up more abyss content over this next week!  
---
The module in the mid slot is a "Assault Damage Control".  
---
Its a damage control that you can activate to give you extreme resistances for a short time! Its my ow shit button :P  
---
Thanks for watching!
---
Yeah that's exactly what we want. We want everyone in the game to stop playing so the servers shut down and all the time we invested in this game is gone. Fucking retarded
---
o7
---
Didn't you hear? PVE in null sec is considered botting...
---
If you actually understood wormhole mechanics, you’d know how misguided your claim about wormholers complaining about that idea due to not wanting null response fleets is. rolling is the primary means of _finding_ content. The issue with unrollable connections, particularly if they’re your statics, is that if you have nothing interesting in chain you can’t try to roll for a new one, and might as well just log off.
---
In one way, yes. How many mobile games, etc. have they tried to make. Aka spent money on, just to scrap it? Sure you won't be using more money on it, but tons have already been wasted on what they've worked on so far.
---
Those are all good rorq alts
---
I found this video extremely interesting.
---
It addresses an important aspect of human psychology in super-stress environments. It’s well worth watching.
---
Sorry for taxing your attention span there, spud.
---
Unfortunately this content type of which you speak has no nuance or genuine challenge to it in current EVE meta, and boils down to ‘hurr durr super/Titan blob,’ especially in this context.
---
While I agree with you, how are you going to simulate and program shouldering it with what amounts to only having one eye in the middle?
---
Maybe it has already been done? I don’t really play shooters.
---
10 - 20 mil and hour at most without koons
---
I don’t know a lot about abyssal stuff so I’m learning.
---
What's koons?  i haven't played the game much and have been away for a couple of years.
---
Moons*.
---
With the MWD cooldown nerf carriers have full force against subcaps *in one particular place*.   It makes them into an area control tool.
---
Can someone point me to a list of the limitations on alpha accounts?  What you can/can't fly or use?
---
Once again I don’t understand this. Why does it need to be “fixed”? Why not harden the fuck up put down the pop gun and build a fucking sandcastle instead of trying to sleep on a piece of drift wood with the seagulls?
---
imagine not being able to focus for 47 minutes Pepega
---
Imagine thinking that adrenaline levels are directly proportional to the ship value.   
---
I had fights where I lost t3s and I was like "meh should've known better to not take this obvious bait, gf, gf, cmon guys, I need that pod express"   
---
And I had fights where my dual-rep AB Incursus was under probably over 2k dps but had to last long enough to kill the interdictor that was tackling our ships.  
---
I think that it is quite obvious which of fights generated more adrenaline - and salt.
---
Ah thank you!  Moon mining is much more profitable than belt?
---
Apparently everyone left null sec, so there's no point.
---
Waaay more
---
Imagine watching a 47 minute video on battlefield psychology for a videogame and thinking it applies to why people can't F1 right.
---
That’s just the rorq/ super alts extracting biomassing and unsubbing
---
I agree with you completely. My group uses shield blops quite a bit, as we need to max as much damage as we can because we run micro gangs. We might have 3 or 4 people in an actual fleet but everyone is dual or triple boxing. We do know what it's like over-farming a region. That's why we have multiple FOBs to operate out of. We have 3 to 4 places to choose from when picking where do drop. It's really nice and perfect for a group like us.
---
Yeah this seems pretty reasonable. Maybe add some kind of special troop transport ship that has to interact with the citadel in order to make it vulnerable to attack or something? I mean, the gameplay in both videos looks fun to me. I thought the whole thing got canceled a while ago though?
---
Look at the Monthly Security Report that literally got posted today.
---
Sometimes I wonder what Eve would be like if CCP had spent the money on it instead of all the other failed games they've spent on...
---
I think you've gone crazy. I live in null and defend every day. I risk doing anomalies and sigs knowing I could get warped on any second. I don't give a turd how people play as long as they're in front of a computer. Seems like something not too drastic to ask for in a computer game. 
---
Everything else is made up troll shit. Sorry null is too scary for you now. Grab some balls. I'll see you around mate.
---
What's the "best" mining ship you can use in hisec?  Mainly for solo excursions.
---
..... it's a representation of the act of shouldering the weapon, made to work in a video game. Would you rather it came up on the right half of the screen? Maybe black out the left half to simulate closing the other eye?
---
Also, as for gameplay, while not all games require ADS, it does add to immersion, and also adds another factor into fights. The choice to take the time to aim, or risk less accurate shots but get the shots off faster.
---
can´t make any isk when you don´t undock and unsub your accounts, no?
---
Thanks for the assist!
---
He clearly does not. We need two new flairs on this sub, one that says "subbed" and one that says "unsubbed."  
---
 u/Jibrish thoughts?
---
Maybe simplify the fitting. Most of my FPS playing friends had no patience for CPU and PG.
---
Yeah but blackout...
---
Racoons. Those dam koons can find ISK in the craziest places man. Get yourself a few koons and take em to high sec, you'll be rich!
---
LINDYBEIGE!
---
Uh, if that were true and highsec was a superior option for them, then that's what they would have been doing all along. Seems to me blackout has made nullsec more difficult for bots and so has made this lesser highsec form of botting the new standard. If highsec botting was superior, that's what would have been done all along.
---
&gt; Still there is huge value in at least one person representing hunters of Eve, coming from that background 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Stopped reading after that one.
---
"We need more diversity!"
---
"It's very important for me to represent the people who killed most of the diversity in EVE!"
---
As if the CSM wasn't enough of a joke already...
---
Do you think I'm just shitposting and don't know what I'm talking about? Then work the logic out for yourself - think about what impact so-called "hunters" have on the rest of the playerbase, and consider how the necessity of avoiding them restricts other players' activities. It's not just krabs they negatively impact, either - consider how much less risk averse EVERYONE would be (especially, but not exclusively, krabs) if taking risks didn't automatically result in being pounced on by a gang of cloaky bs or a hotdrop.
---
Now imagine how much more fun EVE would be if everyone were less risk averse.
---
Im a cyclops its exactly how it works for me
---
Aww man. I really wanted Project Nova to replace planetside for me. As a large scale 'halo' like shooter. I don't want to be confined to ships. And I want to feel like I am part of the greater eve universe in whatever way.
---
&gt; If CCP caught the full ring then I doubt they'll get it back up anytime soon (if ever).
---
This is an astounding level of ignorance.
---
" then that's what they would have been doing all along.  " No, its not, they follow the biggest return they can get with the smallest amount of risk possible, now that's highsec.  
---
" o has made this lesser highsec form of botting the new standard. " Yes, which doesn't solve a damn thing, the bots are still here and they are still printing isk,  they just print it slower.
---
Idk why this is downvoted. Funny imo welcome to poverty sec.
---
Fleet fights aren't limited to big blocks. There are - literally - thousands of newbies, and most of them do want to fight in fleets.  
---
The question here is how many fights it takes before an individual is able to follow FC commands while monitoring:
---
* Distance to anchor
---
* Targets (especially important - and stressful - in spider-tanking fleets)
---
* Watchlist
---
* Overview for yellow or red squares
---
* Own shied, armor and hull
---
* Capacitor
---
* Ammunition
---
* Batteries for boosters
---
* Drones state
---
* Incoming buffs and debuffs icons (not sure what's the proper name for these) such as warp disruption or remote repair
---
Procurer. Anything else gets ganked by players of npc Triglavian groups.
---
Why do you have Chrome, IE, Firefox and edge on your taskbar?
---
Imagine thinking that battlefield psychology isn't applicable to a battlefield
---
LMFAO this guy 😂 😂😂
---
ESI only gives character data as I understand? It won't even give data on account status so I don't see how it could be used to dox unless someone gets mail permissions (which I'm firmly against always).
---
I see your point but eveskillboard only gets access to skills, skill que, implants, standings, clones, and structures. Of those all can be hidden from public view except for skills and skill que. Since my corp details already reveal that we are an all alpha corp there's not much we're giving away. We aren't going to anchor structures either as that would enable war decs and defeat the purpose of the corp.
---
I'm against ESI for more personal and tactical stuff like in game mail but I think this is fine for what I'm trying to do.
---
Yeah just give everything ONLY a powergrid or CPU score, not both. Kill fitting skills. So you have like 100 fitting points and you make it work, the end.
---
Considering the bots have so many orcas out there
---
I’d say pretty profitable
---
Sure, why not, take an upvote for the effort.
---
Testing/troubleshooting
---
Not having chat means that people will just move on to higher isk/h activities. Null is not exactly profitable unless it's safe.
---
Bombers. Bombs.  Fit a cloak and you have COMPLETE power to choose your engagements 
---
T3 cruisers if you also want that oppressive power of choosing engagements.
---
Have fun
---
I have the Frozen Corpse of George Clooney.
---
I wish supers are more rare in game, otherwise you’re just crippling another super in a blob of supers
---
how much per hour would a procurer make?
---
Don’t need to not AFK Orcas
---
IDK, I have a 6 toon setup (4 procs, boost Orca and haul Orca) and mining at moons for 2 weeks, very lazily, I got 14 bil in compressed ore.
---
10 - 20 mil
---
Most of the whiner/goon arguments boil down to sarcastic one liners based on hyperbolic straw men. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; They are going to introduce a much larger class of warships for players to build (probably at the scale of the Trigivalin world ship thing), because clearly that's going to help solve SuperCap proliferation and be "more harder" to build than Supers.
---
I'd prefer a mothership class that alliances/corps can use as a mobile station and industrial base, like in Homeworld.
---
Does he still have hands?
---
Think of the narrative!
---
Funny thing is all you want is easy isk which ACTUALLY ruins the game. In reality, It’s only ruining it for people like you who are risk adverse and just want to watch their wallets tick while their excavators cycle..o wait...too soon? Tears for unemployed INIT/goon excavators anyone?...borat says “Notttttttt”
---
Your stuff?
---
true, but no reasonable dev is going to look at that situation and decide driving 30% of the player base out of the game is going to generate more content and solve the stagnancy issue.
---
So the literal best case is they go in and kill your fleet and then can't get home?
---
Damn. I wasn't expecting the on-grid cloaked log to be fixed so fast. Good thing.
---
I just want some sort of ground/station combat that plays into PI and planetary control. Invading enemy space with ground troops they have to deal with on top of space combat would be awesome. A cloaky transport drops troops off on a planet in WH space, behind enemy lines in NS or in FW space to work toward capturing those areas.
---
If a planet gets taken, it has a negative effect on something in the system, but is reliant on supply chain via ships bringing assets to the system. Don't resupply? Those troops gradually die if countered by opposing forces, as resources run low.
---
Immersive gameplay is something that could bring more players to Eve. Especially if you get a new type of gameplay to break up the average day of a Capsuleer, while also giving Ground-Pounders an aspiration to fly one day.
---
so theres no point to an orca over a procurer for solo mining other than capacity?
---
ESI gives a lot of character data. It gives ZERO account data for security reasons.
---
Now just because you don't mind having your skill public does not mean other people in your corp won't mind ; just because you don't get how it could be used against you, does not mean people won't find a way.
---
Cat-ear skin for pods.
---
None currently tbh I had one not too long ago
---
Not very
---
Xenuria I'm 100% on this train. The killing of Dust/Legion and the backtracking with Nova are KILLING ME more than anything with the main EVE game could. They have the opportunity to create a truly unique gameplay experience and are gonna piss it away. It hurts man.
---
i think we should ask suitonia what are his thoughts on volta trash using loot scripts
---
Thank you!
---
&gt;If CCP turned a blind eye to botters they would stand to make a shit ton of money. So following your logic, why wouldn't they allow it?
---
Its ironic you would say that the same day their August security post showed up, that shows them banning more than 8,000 accounts for botting this month alone, combined with the Jan-Jun numbers that have banned more than 30,000 accounts this year.
---
Either find a corp with a few Athanors popping moons daily or hang around an ice system.
---
Boost with Orca, mine with either Procurer or Skiff.
---
It looks clunky for an FPS. Wish they'd just hire out or partner up with a company. Just get something close to Destiny 2 gunplay and you'd pull in a whole audience based on that alone. Flesh it out with connections to Eve, MMO-like mechanics... you'd have direct competition for Destiny. People in Destiny are getting tired of ships they just look at, bland cosmetic items and a world that doesn't feel like it changes based on their actions. This is being addressed by Bungie in the near future and maybe moving into Destiny 3, but players definitely are looking for more there.
---
A single afk orca can make 50-100 mil a day in a decent system mining good rocks. This assumes 5-10 hours out. Moon mining you should be able to make more.
---
&gt;haha
---
ur gay
---
Don't close off my isk fountain is all I hear from wormholers just like all you hear is that from nullsec. I can just as easily claim you don't know what nullsec wants from changes as you have about me.
---
As to your actual point, are you implying there is an end to your chain and you can't go any further? Nullsec routinely goes dozens of jumps to find a fight, why shouldn't you have to travel far. And no rage rolling doesn't count because the entire fleet isn't rolling it, ships designed to roll are while the rest wait.
---
It's a needed change to reduce how easy it is for wormhole krabs to make money, sorry if it affects your play style but you gave no sympathy to us.
---
so is there any risk in semi afk mining in a procurer then (in hi sec, (i mean im also going to do it in null but i accept the risks with that))
---
&gt;But not logging in is less profitable
---
when you unsub and start logging in to other games your eve profitability  becomes meaningless. This is the price of driving people to take a break from the game, they suddenly realize there are better options out there where the devs don't intentionally try to prevent the way they want to play the game from being viable.
---
Yes. Triglavian npc gangs will kill you.
---
No but you see they pulled their drones faster than I could shoot them
---
Let me give you some feedback regarding this topic that comes from outside of your gon filter bubble: 
---
It´s just a buzzword meme that can apply to everything and anyone who isn´t currently tryharding as much as you are. 
---
I personally like to call these groups of players bots and/or carebears: gatecampers, highsec gankers and wardeccers, miners, people in large alliances, people who undock with more than 5 people in fleet, people who need to get told when to press F1, people who do low effort/low payout PvE, people who use ECM drones or fly ECM ships, your mum, afk ratters, people who don´t feed bling ships into at least 1:15 odds on a regular basis, hotdroppers, batphoners, people who use PvE fits to PvE, people who bring hardcounters to 1v1s, goons, testies, snuffers, wingspan, every single soul who lives in nullsec, Fozzie, people i killed when they should have killed me, people who didn´t kill me when they should have killed me. 
---
That´s about it from me. But i´m sure there´s more.
---
LP is not an ISK faucet, quite the contrary, in some cases.
---
Easy there Satan
---
Is it really a bonus though if it makes it last longer? I'm thinking its reduced time.
---
This can be arranged.
---
I don't play to the nullsec narrative.
---
I know they are not imited to  big blocs but that's where the majority of fights and newbies go to. Distances to anchor is a 3 clicks to set after warp. You also don't realistically need to watch your watch list unless flying logi which a majoirty of pilots are not doing at any given time.
---
Most doctrine ships are made to be cap stable and plenty of ammo and fcs call it out 5 times to switch hard to miss. You can usually just assign drones depending.
---
I mean sure if its a newbies first or second time I imagine he may be alittle spooked but it's not alot to manage at all. That's drastically less to manage then most games and you risk losing your SRPed doctrine ship in a majority of cases where you lose virtually nothing.
---
This is CCP we're talking about...
---
Damn! Thats a lot of shit!
---
Wouldn't be surprised if that was how wrecking crew operated tbh
---
good bot
---
Fair enough, but by your own admission then the bots are now earning less which is in fact a step in the right direction.
---
So your saying you don't yell "pew pew pew" over comms when in fleets? 
---
Get on my level
---
You mean when the MER showed every region in null had at least a few hundred billion in mining and ratting even in places where not many people lived?
---
Yep, more room in null for people who might want to take the risk.
---
And why would it be bad if people moved to high sec? No matter where you play, your omega costs the same.
---
Good. It should have been done ages ago. We need a different equilibrium than what we had, even if it costs some subs in the short term.
---
Pretty much any ship you are confident flying and know well. Small ships like destroyers are good for firepower and mobility. Larger ships are ripe to get blobbed, or you'll just be avoided and both have any fun. My preferences are thrasher, Coercer, confessor, hecate, retribution. The tech 2 and 3 ships are a fair bit more expensive, but not excessively so if you just stick to the basics.
---
I guess the question is, once you already have an Orca for hisec, what's the point of mining more?  Just to collect isk?  What's the end goal?  I guess some people do it just for the relaxation.
---
check the sunday peak times from 4-5\~ish months ago compared to now  
---
random Sunday in April: 36,000+
---
This past Sunday: just over 26,500  
---
5k avg loss + 10k peak time loss isn't bad its fucking catastrophic.
---
Eve player take down shields. And as soon as armor takes damage FPS players have to be loaded on a ship and snuck on to bypass all other timers and flip the structure instead of killing it.
---
Saying that the "Chaos era" had to happen to save Eve is like telling an injured athlete their leg is broken and something has to be done, so you bust out a chainsaw and cut their leg off at the hip.
---
Sure, but I mean, at least those are people who are actually playing the game, and can be killed in theory.
---
its a cliff
---
Both would have been DOA
---
You have to set your own goals in eve. Some folk want to be space rich. Others want the minerals to build stuff etc.  While still others like the zen of mining.
---
This has nothing to do with PVE/PVP players...
---
This guy invested in something and now thinks it became worthless and wants a refund, and people make fun of it, because asking for a refund on something you bought ingame is utterly stupid.
---
Glad to see the bumping change. Abusable no risk tactic that is essentially used just to fuck with people indefinitely.
---
Time limit leaves option to prebump for a gank...and resetting the timer with scrams allows for a cost value for fucking with people or providing some additional time for a gank to arrive.
---
Well executed change I think.
---
Most of those were badly fit and not well tanked at all.
---
&gt;not the grossly overinflated thing it is.
---
You were clear, you just used  all the wrong words for the point you were trying to make.
---
If by years you mean 10s of minutes shooting juice directly to your brain. Sure.
---
This is bullshit. Nullsec still gives more money, people are just afraid now.
---
If this remains the case for another month or so then the value of everything that was so plentiful in nullsec will become more expensive, making it more worthwhile to do.
---
Got an easier fix.
---
Delete Capitals.
---
Reimburse mineral value of the ships and modules.
---
Thanks man, really means a lot
---
given the drop off in people playing that might not happen, there's going to be a decreased demand for those ships
---
They seem to think that's a good thing so don't count on it.
---
serenity died because they closed it, not because the lead devs chased large portions of the player base off the server through targeted changes.
---
Correct which is an awful business strategy but seems to be the one ccp is taking.
---
In no way is freighter botting a real problem. Autopilot does the same thing.
---
Good game is losing its chaffe. Once that flattens out CCP can start rebuilding for the Third decade.
---
If you've got the skills,  ice mining can make more. With a orca for boosting and it's drone alongside a covetor I can usually clear 38 to 40 mil isk an hour if there's a bunch of belts available
---
Inflation for PLEX IS inflation. It's the metric that you'd want to look at most...
---
........ Uh.....
---
Have you read everyone’s opinion on nullsec for the past 3 months?
---
Gtfo especially flairbaiting me with that stance rofl
---
cutting into their income while simultaneously driving them to an area where they don't have to pay rent and are exponentially safer fixes nothing. They may be making less now, but it costs them less to make it and their losses will be non-existent. CCP played hot potato with the botters instead of getting rid of them.
---
Imagine imagining
---
Don't make fun of my disability
---
Isn't this the guy that keeps posting racist comments in the public chat in Wargame: Red Dragon?
---
You're right!  And I did fine belt mining very relaxing.  I have no idea how moon mining compares.  Is it a similar experience?
---
Osprey Navy, Omen navy and Scythe Fleet issue is fire yo.
---
The Navy Faction cruisers are great for solo roaming. Their capabilities vs engage-ability is fantastic, they're capable of speed, damage and application range, while not being too expensive and begging to be ganked/blobbed. T2 fit works perfectly fine.
---
The Vexor Navy Issue looks pretty legit now, but I have not had the chance to dive into it heavily. I'm sure you can make some amazing solo pvp fits with it.
---
Wow, talk about a non-sequitur word salad. Good job bro.
---
That’s how subcapital balance works dude. A solo ship dies to 5 ships of a lower class. A battleship versus 10 frigates might not be able to kill a battleship but they can hold it down and sig tank - that’s totally reasonable. Just because supers cost more doesn’t mean they should be the be all end all of every engagement. If supers are good versus small ships, they become the answer for every possible enemy composition.
---
Keep ur eyes on the channel, more to come!
---
Thanks for watching
---
Oh, they are safer making it superior? Or is it worse for bots? You gotta make up your fuckin mind.
---
AFK   
---
Protesting   
---
BRB
---
Uhhh.... I mean running around on planets and shooting stuff is cool but I'd rather see something new that still feels EVEish rather than a game that will invariably be FPS #6345 with nothing special about it.  I'd rather the gameplay be 90% crafting, farming, exploration and trading with a little action mixed in rather than just be constant mindless pew pew.
---
get well soon
---
Cringe
---
I don't think they have a strategy, after looking at how they have operated the last decade and a half, seeing all their side projects collapse due to mismanagement, and then seeing their CEO publicly posting on his official twitter page that they don't understand what they did that made Eve successful in the first place. There is no strategy and that seems to be the main issue, Hilmar's approach to Eve reminds me of the Joker monologue in Dark Knight, "I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it" Well they caught the car with the making of Eve and don't seem to have any clue what to do with it beyond keep the lights on and pump the player base for all the cash its worth.
---
dat be 2 more than mine :)
---
No list that I’m aware of. 
---
No T2 ships, no capitals, no precursor ships.
---
Also cannot use Covert Ops Cloaking Devices.
---
And there are some assorted market/science skills that you won’t be able to train while alpha.
---
"couldn't bee."
---
that is so cringe.
---
if you try any harder you're going to hurt yourself. The gross income is lower than it was in nullsec, but the COST of operating in highsec is a fraction of what they were paying to rent and bot in nullsec, and the added safety of not needing to worry about losing ships at all in highsec means they keep everything they make because they have no rental bills and their losses will be few and far between.
---
The bot makers are probably wary of the Chaos era and know that ccp is going to shake up things even more and dont want to deal with fixing their bots only to have to do it again in a few weeks.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if they would just give up and go farm WOW?
---
I'm assuming by "cheap" you mean "under 100Mn".
---
Bombers are a very good choice. Fit torpedoes, they'll give you the best bang for your buck. Don't drop on anything that has drones, they will tear you apart, and try to avoid dropping on anything bigger than a BC unless you have a friend. Fit a target painter and go ham.
---
Cruisers are an all-around good option. The Caracal is probably the most versatile cruiser out there, you can fit RLMLs to go after things smaller than yourself or HAM/heavies to go after things your size or bigger. The Moa isn't that bad of an option either.
---
T3Ds are really fun, though you'll push nine figures with a decent fit. The blaster Hecate is an absolute solo PvP god, and if you want the bomber experience but don't have torpedo skills then fit a polarised Hecate and overheat into your enemies. It's fast (insta-align in propulsion mode if you fit it right) and powerful.
---
Pirate frigates are decently cheap and fairly powerful. The Worm is a fun little thing to fly, kite in it and let your drones do the work. You can get it up past 200 DPS and it'll tear through even cruisers. You can also do something like this in a Damavik, exchanging more DPS for a longer time on field, and your enemies get overconfident when they initially think you can't break them. The Damavik is also pretty nasty in small gangs.
---
Avoid dictors like the plague. They aren't particularly good on their own and people dock up the moment they see them on d-scan.
---
Maybe they switched to farming WOW since it came out?
---
Fun fact: mining is twice as fast in the foothold of Invasions and the rocks in the sites are worth better then normal belt ore. My public fleet has a battle orca we bring with our shield fleets. 
---
Bonus fun fact: the majors' ore has morphite in it.
---
I mean subjectively I don’t think anybody finds killing other ships in this game BORING, because you wouldn’t be playing if that wasn’t your thing. But in my estimation, having supercapitals not only cost more but have a lot of non economic value associated with them attracts many people to log in, participate, and hunt.
---
Smell the salt in the air....
---
Show me on this JF model where the bad man touched you.
---
:^(
---
What do the numbers say?
---
Question is, will they fix the additional issue notifying you when someone logs on/off in system?
---
This has nothing to do with botting or being safe or whatever isk/plex idea is new. They are changing the game in ways people didnt like and lots of players posted in the forums warning them not to make these idiotic changes and they did it anyway. Guess what? People stopped playing. Now the game is in a freefall. I would like to think that CCP could fix it, but these guys are too stubborn, they will sink with the ship because in the end it will drive plex sales and they will get a bonus. Fuck the players, fuck the customers; that is the new CCP motto
---
Why doesn't CCP just eliminate suboptimal fits?  
---
If there's leftover CPU or PG, just have a slider or automatic optimizer to improve performance of some class of modules very generally or base ship stats.
---
It seems silly to approach this an NP-hard problem when it doesn't need to be one.
---
Just curious of the bombers bombed your fleet at all? And what the makeup of your fleet was? When we used to wolf pack bombers if we had 50 dudes show up we'd have definitely had 20 dudes sit back and bomb the fleet. We'd probably also have at least falcons on grid.
---
Although that was 4 years ago so meta may have changed.
---
Yeah honestly I would just do mainline dps for like two fleets a month and whore on everything for kill reqs.
---
Most people aren't getting so excited at pushing f1 they can't focus on killing primaries.
---
Wow that looks like complete shit. I'm sure in true CCP fashion it will crash and burn like everything else they've tried that isn't EVE
---
And turn all of Eve into a years long battle royale style eventually ending with everyone in Jita? Meh.
---
The price estimate is still fairly close. My curiosity got the better of me, so I went fishing for a more authoritative response from Miniluv, the game's #1 highsec ganking organization, and the folks I talked to said that estimate was about right.
---
Ok so it's superior to be in highsec? That seems pretty unlikely, or that's what they would have been doing all along. 
---
An overall reduction in their income is the main point of stopping the bots in the first place and since you at least acknowledge that obvious fact, that they made more money in nullsec, then you must concede that, as far as botting is concerned, the blackout has been a good thing. 
---
That or you can contradict yourself to fit the way you happen to feel. Lots of people do that.
---
No one actually cares.
---
If they continue at the rate they are losing players and its going to become a necessity just to prevent the game from looking empty.
---
Game seems plenty alive to me. It probably feels less alive because in the majority of systems you no longer see exactly how many people are in them, but there's plenty of hustle and bustle if you fly around.
---
Something like this would only be warranted if people start regularly getting traffic control errors when flying around.
---
By that logic, first 4 years. We need more systems.
---
What are you talking about? Do you think *all* subcap ratters were bots, or something?
---
That's a very good point.
---
No problem.
---
That clone mechanic SUCKED! It was like CCP went too far into HTFU mode.
---
Are you saying that the amount of systems should fluctuate based on how many people are logged in at a time? That solar systems should just appear and disappear as players come and go?
---
Or is this just a veiled attempt at yet another "game sucks, everyone's leaving" thread?
---
Too many friends of mine quit because it isn’t fun to have to try 5x harder to plex an account or be someone’s ccp fed kills because “dangerrre”
---
It’s retarded
---
What's the term for this reduced economic activity again, I forget?
---
Just an idea to promote more content and activity having less resources would make pol fight over them more.
---
Yes.  Thats what people are saying
---
Bringing back the credit card warriors who are “elite pvp” is a mistake because they quit once for a reason
---
They WILL quit again
---
The game you are looking for is PUBG...
---
Neither am I. Plenty to hunt and kill here if you aren't a shit pilot. No F1ing here, so you might not enjoy it much.
---
holy fuck dude. Ok I'll try one more time, nice and slow. Given the changes to null highsec is NOW superior botting space. The bonuses to botting in highsec are: no rent, less ship losses to hunters, more space to work with then the small region they would have been renting, easier content meaning less time spent training. The downside is you make less then you would in nullsec. BUT they get to keep all of it because its highsec and they aren't paying rent or dying as often, so while they make less in the long run it takes even less effort for them to bot there.  
---
" then you must concede that, as far as botting is concerned, the blackout has been a good thing. "
---
Bots being in the game is BAD, Blackout has not removed bots from the game, meaning it has not SOLVED anything so its not "good" from your point of view. This has been my stance since the start of your nonsensical claims I am contradicting myself. I'm not, the point is just going right over your head.
---
Every pvper that has zkill open on another monitor is FOR SURE doing that
---
Just organize around more populated areas. The map size is a little big imo but its manageable. What we really need is heavy resource depletion/scarcity.
---
You do know
---
And i’m just making sure here...
---
If someone drops the mass of a literal planet
---
You can bring your own mass of a literal plant
---
And
---
This MAY surprise you
---
But you CAN shoot them :o
---
Hmmm this is fair some sort of resource depletion would make people actively need to move to gather more resources. Didnt ccp hint at this in some interview?
---
Just because something hasn't been solved entirely doesnt mean that it hasn't been improved. You can't seem to grasp the fact that you're acknowledging my damn point when you say NOW highsec is superior and BEFORE nullsec was superior. That literally means that the bots make less now as a direct result of the blackout, hence, the blackout has been in regard to bots, a good thing. You fucking slow shit.
---
I see your point. I'll take what you've said to heart and use the resources you gave me. Thank you for all the help.
---
https://i.imgur.com/K86kVK2.jpg
---
This might actually be impressive if an iota of the same amount of effort was put into making the game less rewarding to bots, or in making player activity somehow differentiable from automated activity from the perspective of the player.
---
If the maximum effort approach means something to you other than busywork, then carry on, but don't expect a medal.
---
Eh you can pretty much send every packet that a normal client would send so I don't see how they could detect it
---
NEITHER ARE RORQS.  They generate 0 new isk ever period
---
less than a page of kills ever
---
nice input
---
Yeah yeah cloak from this thread now that you’re challenged
---
Or is that only what you do ingame while screeching about how op the blocs are?
---
I apologize for having a job and only getting play a few hours a week.
---
ccp does whatever they want tbh
---
your input is irrelevant
---
You’re an idiot mate, glad you enjoy the frigate play
---
Anything less than getting rid of the bots is not a solution. If they are concerned about making less while botting than can just run more of them, its not like you need to be omega to bot in highsec as opposed to super/carrier ratting in null which requires a sub.
---
Your mom blows my gasket
---
that’s what is odd, i’d assume they stick to simpler scripts if they went from afk drone boat usage to something else, it’d be something easy
---
Missions have a LOT of moving parts to track
---
1. Pay for your account like a normal game if thats an issue.
---
2. If they were so addicted to 99% safety in some of the most rewarding areas of the game that they quiet when that 99% safety is threatened, that speaks to how bad it got for circa last three years.
---
Why don't you just krab in the C4 itself?
---
its almost like you didn't read far enough down that "single page" to see the kills before blackout started or something...
---
Last time i tried to rat in carrier i wanted to sd before clearing the first wave as well. Don't think it really depends on a ship type...
---
1.  No.  You pay for my account if you want people like me to be your targets by that back assed logic
---
2. If those so addicted to 99% safety they only fly cloaky ships are willing to kill the game for their killboards.  Fuck them they are cancer. you know it’s true even if you don’t want to admit it with how bad it’s gotten for the last few years.
---
19 total kills and not a single one is a ratter, all industrials or miners
---
really pathetic, your experience is irrelevant
---
No because plex prices do not affect most players, since most players pay for their account with dollars and do not plex their account or sell plex. There are three groups of people heavily affected by high plex prices; People who sell plex to fund activities, people who bot, and people who have access to high isk/hour activities (such as WH, L5 missions, and burners/abyssals before they got zerged).
---
High plex prices benefit the first and hurt the other two, but does not affect 80-90% of the playerbase, who are affected more by the "basket of goods" CPI, which hasn't changed in much in years.
---
So then why are you trying to change that?
---
Well if Panfam went out, it’d be too dangerous 
---
their killboards matter more to them than they do to the wettest blanket of a bomber pilot after all
---
Or the demand will crash and we will enter in a deflation. This is more likely to happen, even CCP Rise said his concerns about the ISK generation who is close to become negative now. Null-sec won't go up if everyone send his alts to do missions, and traders won't do shit for a low null-sec demand even with bigger margins that the customers won't accept.
---
You will certainly not care, but the others players won't be OK with that.
---
Null-sec haven't be fixed, period.
---
recession
---
I switched from wow to eve BECAUSE losing mattered.  I got bored with eve over the years when as that shifted to mattering less and less.  What do you know, I unsubbed about 18 months ago.
---
I would say Tank is a benefit of the Orca fir solo mining, but the skill grind to get the yield up to the same as a Proc or Skiff is much longer
---
remove c4 space
---
I see how blackout really succeeded in preventing effortless isk printing.
---
Space is supposed to be big, huge  people want everyone in eve to live in the same region? If anything I would increase distances and make it even larger where larger entities find it more difficult to cover tracts of space.
---
They have been getting rid of them. Like, what are you even arguing here? That because they didnt manage to 100% solve the problem it wasn't worth doing anything? 
---
I'm sorry you lost some ratting income but try to be a little more objective than that.
---
Thanks guys for all the replies!
---
This has been some great info and much needed food for thought.
---
I think for now my plan will be to expand into WH exploration doing day trips and once i can get more time to play i might reactivate my other accounts and see if i can set myself up in a C3 with a rattle or two
---
Gambling ISK?  That's kinda neat, if TOS
---
Yeah that's a bad argument. All your saying is the krabbing was so expressively easy and safe that everyone was rolling in isk before blackout.
---
I have no idea what  you're talking about at this point dude.
---
The perks of Orca mining are
---
1. the absurd tank for a hull fit. Not 'ungankable' tank but pretty close unless someone is seriously miffed at you
---
2. it is probably the afk-ist of afk mining. Set your drones to individual rocks and walk off for twenty minutes to do something else. 
---
3. Gonzo holds means you can chew on rocks for several hours without stopping
---
It's very low management but it's slow. I wouldn't do it as a money making method unless you're busy that day and still feel the urge to log in just to do *something* to nab a bit of extra ISK.
---
If EVE was going to be successfully integrated with anything, it might as well be something like an RTS or TBS.  
---
The development budgets are smaller, the backend requirements are less costly, more assets can be reused, and there is synergy with the current subscriber base.
---
How do you hack a server side game? Wtf
---
It's the same but more lucrative.
---
You do have to change position every so often cuz the rocks are more spread out.
---
I thought years ago CCP said pulling CONCORD was naughty business. Did I imagine that?
---
Almost as much effort as a C5 with not much better payout than a C3,
---
I see primarily goons here fighting aggressively against blackout. As far as I can tell. GOONs have the most to gain by having local back.
---
it does look awesome on a shirt [https://www.customink.com/designs/evej0nny6/qwp0-00bz-3bgv/share?pc=EMAIL-40778&amp;utm\_campaign=shared%20design&amp;utm\_source=share%20link&amp;utm\_medium=shared%20design&amp;utm\_content=shared%20desktop](https://www.customink.com/designs/evej0nny6/qwp0-00bz-3bgv/share?pc=EMAIL-40778&amp;utm_campaign=shared%20design&amp;utm_source=share%20link&amp;utm_medium=shared%20design&amp;utm_content=shared%20desktop)

Local brainlet vocally announces brainlet status.
---
Get help dude
---
&gt; Is that good for the game?
---
Yes. No more inflation.
---
But you're also working under the idea that this is it. Nothing more will be done to balance nullsec. That's foolish.
---
I don't understand.
---
You enter an orbit around the target with them at the center.
---
Actually oblivious. I was extremely skeptical but they’ve put a lot of work in and its pretty impressive. It might still yet be an mtx infested crapshoot but as it stands it’s very good
---
They are whining and whining and whining about how they are entitled to kills?
---
No. They aren't.
---
Hence cartoon world.
---
Killing concord is definatly considered am exploit but this?
---
You just don't know enough about the game to understand the difference between that and this.
---
Bots mostly.
---
The relaxation thing is a fallacy. People aren't sitting there enjoying the orca mining.
---
I may be mistaken but I thought "preloading" is what is was called and it was a no go. But it's been a long time since I've seen anyone really talk about ganking so I could be mistaken. Not that CCP has ever had much concern about ganking.
---
Once upon a time I would mine on one toon while hunt for pvp on another. I personally found the mining somewhat zen like. Moon mining in hs is functionally the same as belt mining but it is much more profitable- or at least as profitable as hs can get. Now moon mining in low sec or null, is  vastly more profitable, but that comes with less zen and more excitement.
---
No, we just need incentive to sprawl
---
This guy, always wants the population nicely corralled...
---
Can't use cloaks at all
---
you can make 25m hr in an orca with 500k ehp afk for 2 hours at a time, it's shit but it's super easy and scales up really well
---
The phone thing still applies but region doesn't.

But also you can apply saying you have those phones and live in Australia, get the code, and install the app from apkpure

Yuck. Please do yourself a favor and stop posting.

Yeah, I believe they're planning something around it.

Hi there! I’m completely new to Eve online, just started yesterday. I watched most of quill18’s beginner videos, and I’ve completed all the beginner missions for industry, exploration, business, and combat. 
---
I’m really interested in the exploration aspect, and plan on doing mining on the side whenever I want to be AFK and watch a show.
---
I understand the basics of exploration and scanning for anomalies, and I think I kinda understand hacking, but what would be some things that would really help set me up for success when it comes to getting better at exploration?
---
Just pulling concord off the gates after a successful gank ;) if you find the corpse of syzzel or templer one to thirteen these are my alts :p
---
&gt;it it favours the risk adverse pvp'er
---
why do people keep spouting this 'risk averse pvper' meme
---
in and of itself, but if the change causes players to leave but the overall health of the game improves later on it's worth it
---
this guy was an anti-ganker, his carebear moron brain on full display
---
Moving up from a Myrmidon, I've started running C3's in a Praxis with heavy drones and rapid heavy missile. 
---
I am getting massive problems with drones being aggroed constantly by Sleepers, like on the first wave before a ship is even down. This was not a problem in the Myrm which did less damage from guns than the Praxis does from missiles, even in the same sites.
---
I have tried relogging, exit and boarding ship, logging different alts then back again.
---
Celiac?
---
first of all- he wasn't mining
---
second of all- uedama is highsec, not lowsec
---
please stop posting
---
Oh ok. So I was literally asking a question and you're a dick. Thanks for clearing up what was going on here.
---
I'm from indiana, and have never seen a license plate like that.
---
Hecate , watch squishy on YouTube and that’ll give you some good insight on when to fight and when to run
---
You have to leave blue space to get a fight in a pvp ship
---
Input broadcasting isnt the same tho
---
If you dont want to pay to play the game, you dont get to play. How it works.
---
As for safety, you dont really get what PvPers are looking for do you? The PvE targets are not the point, the roaming fights between response fleets and the such are the point. Thats the beauty of these changes, bringing that back strong.
---
Counterpoint: When you're in tidi and the primary broadcast doesn't go through, you make sure you whore on the faction titans because you are calm and logical.
---
Have you tried unbluing your neighbors 2 regions away and shooting them
---
My advice is learn to manually pilot and kite. Take out a slicer.  Get used to cap management, rep management, controlling range etc. Roaming in a cruiser means a lot of shit will get away from you and also means you'll die to every gatecamp
---
Not the Celestis so nope
---
Youre arguing with the man who helped mox the kool aid, i wish you luck
---
\~ Data and Relic analyzer modules can no longer auto-repeat, since auto-repeating is almost always an incorrect choice for these modules. \~
---
It's about damn time.
---
You will get reimbursed sometime after the pos module reimbursement occurs.
---
Hilarious all these nullbears saying how safe it is yet eat shit when they try to setup farm holes
---
Serenity had inflation of unbelievable proportions. It was stupid expensive to get anything going on the server. But then again you might not realize what I was even talking about.
---
tbh the only left are the scap ratter. all other have 0 chance to survive
---
I didnt say blackout. I said the nerf bat. Time to start nerfing buy orders for blue loot. I say 50%  change to be less profitable is good. Gotta stop the isk faucets.
---
Do I look like someone who has life goals or self respect? Of course I still do. For now.
---
Was it original? It was a thing when I started, but I came in towards the end of that; think I only ever upgraded a clone once or twice. 
---
I kinda feel like, I understand why it seemed like a good idea at the time, but in hindsight, wow, what a bad idea with nothing but negative incentives to actually take risk.
---
Thats not how that works, but sure keep believing your own bullshit
---
I quit
---
Better twist at the end than anything m night shyamalan has done.
---
I'm an idiot because you disagree with me? That's on you, pal. I'm on CCPs side. Backing everything they've said and done. So... If you're not happy you can play another game. See ya.
---
They have said you can't move concord to your benefit. Miners used to and may still do it have an alt attack someone and draw concord. Then have their main gank in another area.
---
i think they should have some way to detect data from multiple alpha accounts coming from the same IP or something right?
---
Thank my titans by having my fax logged in for ***if*** when they accidentally jump instead of bridge
---
Then why are they afk?
---
There are some really good, suspensful shows on Netflix. When a big plot twist happens you may have the adrenaline pumping so hard you don't even hear the target switching (or remember you are supposed to be shooting stuff on that pesky second monitor).
---
that’s how drones work! every ship that uses drones, obviously subcapitals, can be defanged. That is part of the trade off you make when flying a drone ship.
---
You still need fair representation from multiple playstyles.
---
[deleted]
---
Undocking as a criminal will spawn CONCORD(or move existing spawns to your location) this is working exactly as intended and is **not** an exploit. Causing CONCORD to spawn under circumstances it should not spawn **is** an exploit.
---
If all you want to do is mine then please join a group in null sec that will do this better.
---
You can easily  make a few 100s of a million isk with moons. Then when you are waiting for the moons to pop there are max boosts rourqals you can buddy up with to not only have +59% mining boosts but on field  ore compression.
---
Pandemic horde is a newbean alliance that can help you, though  the things I mention here are true in most null sec alliances.
---
Your posts are traveling down the slide into grr goons territory :(
---
They need to add more systems. Change the gates and travel routes. Increase and decrease security levels. Add more K-space to K-space worm holes. Kill planets and moons. Have planets and moons get born. 
---
Eve needs to be constantly changing. The population is fine. The bot farms left. Players are still out there.
---
ayyy
---
You lot? This is one moron spewing his stupidity, don't lump us all in with that.
---
Did I say they were or why are you bringing them up?
---
Yeah that's the whole problem, people want to do pve in eve as afk as possible because it is fucking awful. Now that they can't be afk... welp.
---
I was so excited for jf jumping to covert cyno. But a bunch of people had to bitch and fuck it up. I would have much rather jumped my jf to a random covert cyno then to a hisec gate instead of having to do it just right on a station and warp so you can dock up if someone tries to grab you cause if you do it anywhere else anyone in system can just warp to your cyno.
---
Force Auxiliaries should be able to as well. I mean force auxiliary literally means force multiplier. Whats a better force multiplier than more ships?
---
And it still continued to run until they turned it off.
---
He said compare it with past maps, and past maps showed activity.
---
they didn't get rid of some with blackout, they got rid of some by banning them. The blackout did not lead to bans it lead to decreased player numbers.
---
if blackout should fix the massive increase of titans and super capitals, then ccp made a wrong  reflexion.  
---
in my opinion there are a few point that made it possible:  
---
1. Implemention of citadel with unlimited production slots.  
---
2. Mining Rorquals: i would like to see boosting rorquals on grid of the mining site. No 'Excavator' Mining Drone.  
---
3. Add the Boson  DD. Ttitans should be used for capital and structure fights. its a pretty  strange concept, that titans can wipe out a sub cap fleet. Boson DD is like the old remote DD.
---
so first I wasn't active, then I am active but not enough to matter, now I don't kill targets you approve of? Keep reaching.
---
Posts like these don’t help either
---
I'm in TAPI and most of the people I regularly played with have gone inactive, so pretty sure it is a lot of humans.
---
can i have your stuft
---
Er... that's not where a huge chunk of people in nullsec are getting their money. The vast majority of ratting in nullsec puts isk directly into the wallet of the character, and the loot is worth far less. The economy can't balance out bounties on rats.
---
&gt;Oh no, my wallet is larger than my common sense, so clearly have deficiency  in your ability to play the game.
---
FTFY.
---
Lol the dorritos
---
"shaking things up" without fixing any of the real problems is not going to help the game.
---
Eve is dying posts are what really kill eve
---
Kill mark padding with alts?
---
I honestly don't know,. I live in high sec and daytrip to wormhole space or do abyss. I think that for subcap pilots who aren't in an alliance, there's better options unless you were a bot.
---
You have a better recommendation?  Are we supposed to try to convince everyone that everything is fine with the game?  Here, let me try:
---
"Sure numbers are low, but rest assured that nearly two decades of MMO games have proven that using surprise mechanic changes to randomly punish a specific portion of your players for doing exactly what you told them to do vis-à-vis "build your empire," is a much better approach to management than sitting down with your development staff and coming up with meaningful and engaging change."
---
Does that help?
---
Fighters can kill smaller ships if the carrier uses the tracking modules and if the support fighter squadrons are used.
---
And now "empires" are fucked, stagnant, and boring.
---
Don't worry, it happens to lots of game.
---
How do you know that most people just pay for subscription only? Personally I subbed and sold plex for isk when I was first starting out but now I can just buy plex with isk. I don't think that's a uncommon thing to do.
---
Maybe something more than aimless tantrum throwing
---
Stop being intentionally naive. This is how the subcap and capital balance works. No capital ship should be able to be able to easily win a 1 v 10 engagement regardless of their fitting.
---
Agreed. I too could throw spears at shit I don't understand, but I don't because it's a waste of everyone's time.
---
A lot of us used to subcap rat because it was a decent way to fund our PVP stuff, repair sec status and help our sov all at the same time. It wasn't making any non-botter wealthy, not by any means, but it was good enough for our purpose.
---
Now the amount of effort required is just way to high for the ISK it produces. Most of us have switched to something else.
---
Mining in high sec is one of the worst ways to make isk in eve.
---
there should be no such rorqal or orca mining. i hope ccp made them back to main focus booster ships
---
Unfortunately the most recent infomation I have is from Fanfest 2012, where CCP said around 25% of accounts are plexed. I don't have any data on what percent of *players* plex their accounts but I'm willing to guess that number is lower than 25%, since people who plex their accounts often plex multiple accounts, so that 25% of accounts is concentrated in a smaller proportion of people.
---
&gt; Don't close off my isk fountain
---
You dense mother fucker, he's talking about PvP. 
---
&gt;As to your actual point, are you implying there is an end to your chain and you can't go any further? 
---
Yes, dead ends are common. Systems that drop you into highsec or into the ass end of chinese space during US prime. You should actually learn how wormhole life is before trying to whinge about it.
---
I can't wait to see what the cyno changes will bring, lmao
---
I'm here for the PAP... you mean I have to shoot shit too?
---
/s
---
This is what happens when you elect a CSM candidate who runs a campaign of """balancing""" nullsec empires while having absolutely zero idea about how nullsec works and has zero experience with null empires.
---
Great write up and lots of good information on WH life. Stay safe out there by yourself but always take the bait. 😁
---
Where are the ship balance changes? Besides the cyno stuff, there's huge swathes of ships that have been completely worthless for *years*. How fucking hard is it to adjust some numbers?
---
Ah yea m8, it was totally these changes and not the stagnation of the game that was continuing as is anyway. *Maybe* these changes sped up the decline, maybe, but at least they are doing something to try to change things rather than let the game die in stagnation as the krabs hum happily along slowly blinking out.
---
It won't be either. It will die a fast death if it even survives the CCP stillbirth. They are a shit game development company and always have been. They got black swan lucky with EVE and have been trying to figure out wtf to do for years.
---
I honestly believe it's better to have 16.400 online players than 16.400 + 10.000 bots
---
No ship balance changes at all, besides the cyno restrictions. Meanwhile half the ships in the game sit unused because of how stagnant the meta is. How hard is it to adjust some stats, CCP?
---
Can't pad kill marks with Rookie Ships, Shuttles, or Capsules.
---
It's desire that is the issue rather than knowledge.
---
This is what happens when idiots spam reddit with stupid ideas and even worse posts.
---
35 entities, ok so 1 alt each for 18 people sounds about right for holding a high sec moon through intimidation ganks.
---
No u
---
Oh, it's this thread again.
---
I think you are so butthurt about getting no no touched by cap drops you dont give a shit handout balancing
---
i would second the caracal they’re great for learning! also i like the algos a lot as a destroyer. great little drone boat
---
So 10 rookie ships should be able to take out a titan?
---
Your logic doesn't track mate.  If the game was in decline, and you make a change that hastens it....maybe change something else?
---
You are an idiot...   It is better to have 45000 online  back in the day.  Bot's are CCPs problem not players.
---
We actually had an argument about this on comms a while back and I pulled the numbers for a three-month span. PIRAT was topping all highsec ganking kills on every class of freighter and JF by a close margin. It's not that PIRAT is killing that many...it's that a lot fewer are ganked than people think.
---
Posts like these continually remind CCP of bad policy... Since the listened to Reddit to make the changes, maybe they will listen to reddit to correct the mistake?
---
Well at one point CCP told us that EVE was about empire building, it's not the players fault that they did...
---
I don't think a pure FPS game really fits that well with the EVE player base. I'd like to go down to a planet do stuff sure, but the stuff that I'd like to do is more along the lines of finding a sweet spot to mine and construct a space elevator to my raiteru so I can corner the noble metals market and manufacture light neutron blaster IIIs, and a drop ship for my land titan for a while before I get blasted by CODE. We are mostly a 30+ yo crowd. I don't think many EVE players look forward to just getting headshotted for hours by a 14 year old who is mainlining Mountain Dew.
---
Did you know to look for ship(s) in your hanger after you docked?   You don't automatically get wrapped in a new ship after docking.
---
Empires are boring because we have achieved our end goals....CCP never gave us something else to go for.  A developers job is to continue the narrative and expand the game.
---
You are what happens when cousins marry
---
End goals? It's a sandbox, you make the goals. The fact that you see "holing up in a region and getting at many titans as you can" the end goals is the problem lol.
---
Maybe just get used to your mainline fleet not being caps?
---
Can we all agree null sec used to be safe haven for botters? CCP has corrected the issue with a blackout. Everything else will settle down and eventually get wrinkled out. But stop thinking it was better to do nothing, because all this community did was whine about CCP never doing anything to fight botters. 
---
You get what you asked for, so don't cry when the solution was something you didn't expect. CCP obviously knew player numbers would drop, yet they did it anyway. Why is that? 
---
Same goes for cyno changes. Players whined about cap drop overkills. So they make a solution. Heck... JFs had covert cynos at one point but God knows why people argued for cyno vigils! And among your tears you lost covert cynos for t1 hauler cynos. Like seriously people? 
---
I don't get you all.
---
*This* is something I’d really like to see CCP work on.  For all the blackout salt, this is what’s going to kill EVE:  shit balance left to rot for years.
---
Alright. My bad. Who are the external developers making this who have created this device dependency?
---
id assume its more phsically hands off the keyboard, music running , rather than actual afk, atleast for part of the time
---
Blackout hasn’t stopped the bots.  They’ve just moved to high/lowsec mate.
---
"smaller ships" should mean battleship and battlecruiser size.
---
Not frigates.
---
And that pattern of behavior goes back years. 
---
\&gt;Era of the Drake
---
\&gt;Era of the Dramiel
---
\&gt;Era of the VNI
---
Like they just leave shit broken forever
---
S h o w M e W h a t Y o u Goooot
---
Everyone bitched about rorqs “printing isk”
---
Not only do not re-iterate. CCP never fixes which are oviously mistakes. 
---
Example the Claw, changes its bonus from damage to rof, then realize that is not enough to nerf such fleets.
---
And then remove the bonus to jump across bubbles for the whole line of ships. 
---
But the bonus never got back to Alpha for the claw. 
---
For me the most irritating thing is, tha CCP changes this and that for nullsec env, and if this is adverse for the other envs, lowsec or wh it doesn't mind.
---
I mean sure, but making further changes also takes time, so it's not like they can do something then immediately completely different things. 
---
Regardless, any major changes will be met with some real fucking anger and salt from those who dislike them. But they have to do something more than watch a dying game. And no, listening to the random shitters on here isn't productive either.
---
not surprising
---
If the krabs who absolutely require perfect intel and minimal risk to play wallet simulator are leaving, I have no issue with that.
---
For the majority of the time they spent undocked they weren’t content for anyone.
---
Whats surprising is the level of carebear that was prevalent in NS. I knew it was bad but holy shit.
---
Can confirm: every character in WiNGSPAN is a bot run by /u/wingspantt
---
TNA do nothing but roll people in and drop an assload of caps and scorpions on everyone anyway, Inner Hell are only doing what is right.
---
I have a corpse of markee dragon, what do you reckon that would go for?
---
remember tiericide?
---

---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Links can be chained through structures, and therefore you do not need to build central clusters in a "spot" blooming outward. I used to painstakingly setup all my planets with these complicated "spot" setups. Something like your description.
---
However, I tried it out on the same planet with same skills (diff char obv) and found that I fit the same exact number of structures with this setup:
---
LP=F=F=F=F=F=F
---
The links run through the Factories and into the LP, carrying product from LP to F and back to LP from each F. If the production shifts to another Tier, then it would simply repeat on the other side:
---
F=F=F=F=F=F=LP=F=F=F=F=F=F
---
This is much easier to setup and tighten up versus:
---
F F F F F F
---
F-F-LP-F-F
---
*Imagine links between the top and bottom rows with the LPs
---
Anyone else notice this?
---
Yes, it's no surprise when people have trouble understanding what you're talking about when you rant incoherently.
---
The wording of the announcement talks about initiating warp _on_ grid ... but the reddit post about the issue talked about initiating warp somewhere else _to_ the grid of the player, which makes a big difference. Does the fix also covers the “to”-case?
---
imagine playing this game to whore on kills
---
wait nevermind thats literally 1/3 of the playerbase
---
I mean CCP keeps trying to invest all that EVE money in games that are not EVE, see: Dust514, World of Darkness, this thing, valkyrie, etc.
---
it's all of the above
---
Holly shit, that legion loading screen is EPIC, WE NEED THAT!
---
Hope you guys enjoy. I put my heart and soul and one or more appendages into this =D
---
Mixing up the meta just for the sake of a shakeup is fine. But it needs to fucking happen as soon as it starts to get stale again. Munnins have been FOTM for like a year now. Just nerf them and buff something else so we can at least fly something different.
---
I don't know either, sorry.
---
Both yes and no. The most adrenaline I've had when playing eve was flying an interceptor and burning 70km to tackle a group of munnins.
---
Also, 2k dps incursus, the t1 frigate? 200 is more likely.
---
What can I hunt with solo bombers? Sounds amazing
---
Well learning is something I need to do. Until I moved to null I haven't had the option to really get into PvP very much, but now it's at my doorstep!
---
Best comment here. Thanks for the abundance of info.
---
It's a problem for people who only farm anoms. Things like DEDs/Abyss/WH or even l4 blitz isn't half as boring as gameplay is more diverse and rewards being active and skilled, not mentioning that you don't have to farm this way for 10 hours to get decent money.
---
&gt; This is what Project Nova will probably be. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJqzs2atD3E) 
---
Is this just a shitty knockoff of Destiny? If I wanted to play Destiny, I would play destiny (I don't btw, it's a shit game).
---
the man said ``under`` meaning 2k dps was being dealt to him
---
You could talk to Dust players in local? How did that even work?
---
I actually don’t fly much in null space these days and own a supercarrier, so I have a dog in this game. There is no question that they are overpowered.
---
Also, what do I hunt as a solo bomber?
---
&gt;No, its not, they follow the biggest return they can get with the smallest amount of risk possible, now that's highsec.
---
so you admitted nullsec had lower or equal risk and better rewards than highsec t1 hauling before the blackout
---
Safe space - as safe as no asset safety can be.
---
The only good reason is for the bragging rights of dropping your blinged out Sin haha
---
Yes. But neut pressure on cap injected ships has still a strong effect. This ranges from active tanks which can only use their tank at the same moment they inject, amarr ships which can't use their guns to not being at jump cap.
---
Further, those mechanics are still the same if you fit capital sized neuts to a battleship. Not even to speak of that the battleship will cap itself out. The OP's ideas are not practical and I thought I explain to the OP why instead of the typical /r/eve "lol u stupid".
---
Can confirm. Slicer is basically the best ship for learning how to kite.
---
ok, that makes more sense.
---
You can get through most gate camps in a cruiser if you are fast enough. One of the reasons I personally enjoy the Stabber in null.

---
Nothing can top Csm 9 in terms of bullshit
---
So you think it's good for the game that a rookie ship could defang a supercarrier?
---
I would rather play a good game with 10k online, than this post-citadel bullshit, crowded with afk farmers. 
---
Why care about numbers that have very little correlation with actual gameplay?
---
You can't go wrong with one of these for a little excursion. They are fantastic even if not the most versatile of ships.
---
Abyss, sure maybe, dunno bout wh, DED I can speak to and once you've done it more than a couple times it is exactly the same as doing anoms. Solve the easy puzzle and it becomes a snoozefest with a reward at the end. L4 missions I assume are the same, get your correct fit, shoot the right rats at the right time, bingo money. Other than DED sites, none of that matters anyways because we're not talking about wormholes or highsec, we're talking about nullsec.
---
  
---
Regardless, you missed the point that farming anoms is a HUGE portion of null income. Also, the less anoms farmed, the less DEDs are generated, so it really hurts that gameplay as well.
---
It took I think around 4 to 5 hours or so, to do by hand.The detail is what got to me and I'll admit that I got a bit lazy here and there as simply glossed over a lot of detail in the engines of my ship as well as those lovely lovely Amarrian trimmings.
---
if you buy them ingame with injectors its actually 45% to use a daily injector over a large or small injector. in jita, a daily injector is 55 mil, a large is 800 and a small is 161 (almost exactly 1/5th price). a daily injector is 50k or 1/8th of a large injector. 55 *8  = 440.
---
literally 55% of the cost per sp as a large injector. So if youre going to let your sub lapse and you want an injector anyway, cheap sp right there
---
"The numbers never lie, hovewer what they say can be misinterpreted remarkably easily" - some long dead guy maybe
---
Historically, most empires were like that.
---
How many of those are going to be rollers?
---
Krabs in null, Rakoons in high... it's a fucking zoo m8
---
Well I never said that no humans left.
---
Krabs would definitely have higher propensity to leave.
---
Are there any groups within ProviBloc which actively seek out PVP? Or is it just NRDS across all of New Eden? Supposing a CVA member (or some other alliance) found a neutral in J177013, would the ROE of any corp in a ProviBloc alliance allow him to shoot?
---
I mean, in casual PvE MMORPGs like WoW it's also damn near impossible to make large groups of people follow simple instructions...
---
I don't think the problem is with adrenaline. More like average IQ.
---
which is fully reimbusable
---
bo hunt is a 1.0 carebear so yeah good call
---
Lack of staff. The people that do balancing also do other stuff and balancing existing ships doesn't advertise as well as new shit so very little/no time is assigned for it.
---
Another unsatisfied crab customer
---
Can I use your invite?
---
what was it last year same date?
---
Id like to thank my ceo for handling corp logistics so well. Always awesome to see stuff well done on time
---
&gt;CCP seems to habitually do once-a-decade rebalance of hulls and weapons systems, declare mission accomplished, then never again revisit them, even after they've totally fallen out of use.
---
Before I try to explain, I have to note that while this sadly has a good part of truth it's not simply like that. In some instances CCP keeps an eye on changes and does changes. Examples: after they overworked the assault frigates they nerfed the speed of the retri to be reasonable. The indeed kept an eye on highsec wardecs after they changed them end of last year. Again sadly there are only a few examples of good follow up compared to a huge amount of obviously out of balance things which are left for a long time.
---
Now, for why it is hard. Companies like CCP actually consist of human beings. Those have their own agendas and motivations. Working on a big change and implementing it is interesting for a dev. Following it up isn't really that sexy. It also means that a person admits an error. As we all know humans love to admit to their own faults. Good management is the key to compensate for that. Some manager would need to put into his calendar "two months after change ask in meeting what it effect was and if it needs change" same for four months again. And no this isn't the CEO's but it's the CEO's job to make sure his guys do that.
---
Some answer(s?) in https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bo4zed/i_was_on_eves_csm8_i_was_spacefamous_for_a_long/ talked about reiteration and so on. I think it was similar to what I just said here (didn't talked about a solution though). There was also a lot of talk about personal agendas of devs. (No evil plans just what motivates a person to act.)
---
[http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) ?
---
Steve Irwin would've had a blast
---
I thought your reply was so absurd it was almost not worth answering, but I just want you to know that is an awful strawman and doesn't represent my argument at all.
---
Covetors, most importantly.
---
I seriously wonder why they don't try to differentiate themselves from other shooters by taking full advantage of EvE's setting to make one that plays different from all the others.
---
Give us movement like in Titanfall or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eLVRkYIe84) for the cancelled Tiberium FPS.
---
Give us guns that take full advantage of the versatility offered by directed energy weapons and caseless liquid propellant firearms, letting us adjust the settings on the fly to get different performance.
---
Give us enemies that draw upon the sheer variety that we can find in New Eden, so that every faction's NPCs look and feel different. Also, make Rogue Drone combat forms pants-shittingly terrifying to fight.
---
Yeah, which is fucking impossible, not to mention it would have been a fucking terrible idea(like DUST)
---
If EVE wants to make a shooter/space sim/RTS/whatever in EVE universe, it should absolutely **NOT** ever be integrated into the actual game, and instead based on some *past* major EVE lore event.
---
For some maybe. The amount of times I've seen a super drop from my corp is literally once and we've never super blobbed.
---
Free proxies ? Tor ? Idk
---
Not if the gatecamp is even half good at catching stuff. Cruiser align time and your sig really hurt when you're playing gate/aggression games.  Also when flying solo you can find 1v1 engagements but if you commit in a stabber it usually means you're getting blobbed soon after
---
I have no sympathy for people who only krab but why do people have so much hate for the guys who krab their asses off to pay for their accounts/pvp who always join ops and krab till their friends get on to do small gang stuff should they just go get fucked too? Should only credit warriors play?
---
Right. Im just looking to make actual products, cause it seems that i would probably end up making nanite paste for myself to use for PVP, issue with that is it isnt really "making profit" lol so Im not too sure.
---
You can use Domi like the Raven, just replace "cruise missiles" with "sentry drones".
---
Interesting idea.  There would prob be a lot of scepticism each time though about whether local going down was deliberate or another 'feature'.
---
I think it would be best if CCP had one of the missions you take in the tutorial involve getting suicide ganked and podded by a fleet of 20 insta-locking Catalysts. Preferably after the player has been given some *really* expensive modules to fit, just so they learn what it feels like right off the bat.
---
Another mission should involve dying to a gatecamp.
---
If they are as dedicated players as you describe then they should be able to make isk with relative ease.
---
I mean they might lose some ships occasionally but I don’t see anything wrong with that.  The idea that it’s completely unsafe to rat or mine now is ridiculous.
---
Probably very few if you look at C5 corps, joys of carrier rolling.
---
The codebase is a partial birth abortion that somehow survived with duct tape and hot glue 
---
There’s no fucking way anything is simple to implement in our dead game
---
Can someone explain whats happened? lol im confused
---
How much for a real GigX corpse?
---
If I had to guess...  I would say a lot of fun was had here.
---
it was truly awful because your very high SP characters really would only be suited to larger, more expensive ships, flying a sabre or an interceptor in a fleet was like just asking to double your lossmail (or more, depending) if you were in the upper SP brackets. It was absolutely silly.
---
Same problem as always, hilmar and bad choices.
---
Has the super expensive keepstar been built yet? Just wondering
---
&gt; Bombers are a very good choice. Fit torpedoes, they'll give you the best bang for your buck. Don't drop on anything that has drones, they will tear you apart, and try to avoid dropping on anything bigger than a BC unless you have a friend. Fit a target painter and go ham. Make sure you have a covops fit and pick your fights carefully. Your main advantage is your ability to choose where, when, and how to strike, so make sure to use that.
---
that only leaves moa as a viable target
---
hooray! What do u do at CCP btw? just curious
---
the Whale Song
---
thera bros? whats that
---
I'm particular towards the Eve-esque fitting customization for my character/ship/etc. That's what I hope for when I hear that sort of thing.
---
Expecting interaction with TQ is almost a given for me. I can't imagine CCP not doing it, but this is the gaming industry we're talking about I suppose.
---
Miners and explorers. And gating industrials
---
Lack of vision, I'd totally go for a slower paced shooter with way more strategic decisions - which appears to be their original design.
---
beep boop
---
Do u mind if i ask how u hunt? I love hunting but only just getting into it but would like to do more of it.
---
Also u can only live in a c5 if u have other omega alts to multibox on right... u cant do it with 1 toon is that right?
---
Thought problem, how long do you think does it take for a ratting ship to pay for itself if you lose one and have to replace it.
---
- Myrmidon
---
- Dominix
---
- Ishtar
---
- Nid/Thanatos
---
Ishtar. 
---
Svipul.
---
Alright guys, we need to organize 12000 players to attempt to cripple gsf’s 1000 supers that they brought today.
---
Management doesn't undersatnd why balance is important for retention. So it's not a priority.
---
Also would u recommend skilling into gas huffing cause it makes good isk? I live with a c5 static so i can run over there and run some gas sites i guess, the isk just seems really poor with my 1 omega toon. Btw how much does gas huffing make u?
---
remove c6 space
---
Idk i left a wormhole today and scanned a signature in the middle of far null (top left area) and warped into only to meet another astero running the site already lol, seems nicely populated xD
---
I was one of the few mino on grid, it was a close call. gf overall.
---
I just use myrmidons and the replacement time is similar to that of the old VNI.
---
Why is the sabre so commonly used? can anyone explain to me pls
---
???
---
Unless ur using a Mac
---
check the app info in settings and there may be a "move to sd card" button
---
This is just beautiful.
---
lol you don't need local to hunt and know where people live
---
I don't have any specific opinion on how CPP is doing balancing the game, but EVE is exceedingly complex and balancing a million little interconnected systems is incredibly difficult. Many PVP games are similarly difficult to balance and almost all of them have communities that think the balance is shit. You ever been on an RTS forum? Yikes.   
---
IMO Game balance isn't really solvable past some complexity threshold and if it is that usually means the game is balanced pretty flatly.
---
This is definitely one of the better ones.
---
Sad to see so many Orcas go, they wanted a better defence.
---
Still not as easy as orbit and assign sentry drones
---
great job guys
---
May have
---
hwat
---
Literally just check region killboards, lmfao. Proper scouts can pretty easily find the gangs you're looking for
---
Was that the one where mittens cried, complained, spun bullshit, bled tears all over the boards, cried to CCP then his entire group ran away and docked up like a bunch of sad cunts?
---
that one?
---
We should leave all Null changes to people who live in null. They're the only ones who utilize null for content and resources. That would actually lead to the healthiest and least stagnant gameplay in the null region.
---
Orcas fined for farming in rorq mining space, fine paid in full with there destruction.
---
It's this, CCP do not have enough people to fix a system as complex as this.
---
Yeah. But BEFORE they reworked AFs, they had been horribly underpowered for many years.
---
Because "balance" in all honesty, is a myth. The best they can do is stir the waters from time to time and break stagnation.
---
Hey olmeca, what flavor kool-aid did nully serve ya?
---
bomb them
---
I went by 4 systems. Same setup. Pod at a ping on the dead end in-gate. I jump in and find all out the myrms scattered and docked. I can't be arse to camp to these bots. I only have an hour or two to find some in game content each time I login.
---
If this is the case, they must have like, 1 person in charge of all balancing.
---
How fucking hard is it to tweak fitting numbers or falloff or whatever on the most obviously imbalanced ships once a month? It'd take an hour per month one dev who also plays.
---
I'd almost pay isk to a fucking fund that rewards gooners a few hundred million isk to get 10 solo kills. Solo/small gang is easily some of the most heart pumping and rewarding content eve has to offer. So many "experts" on the subject have never ventured out alone or with a small group. But somehow small gangers are the "risk averse, covert cloak using" pvpers.
---
None have it. Probably need adb to format card.
---
You're correct about shooting right rats and all (which isn't nessesary in anoms btw) , but you're foregetting about scanning and travelling around, you also have to refit (or have several) ships according to missions/sites and actually learn how to run them effeciently. The thing about reward in the end is also very important as you have to choose between escaping a threat and getting said reward. I loved blitzing l4s with afs, some people farm l5s with bombers. There's really more depth to these activities than i can express in a single post.
---
I don't see any problem with being a nullsec pilot and farming whs or anything else. There's nothing to prevent you from getting isk the way you preffer, wh system upgrade exists for a reason.
---
I couldn't miss the point you haven't made. Less DEDs genereated already made the loot like 3 times more expensive and there was never a shortage of sites, you're talking nonsence. I'm sorry, but anom farm is shitty gameplay regardless of how huge it was. It's really a great thing that people now have a reason to learn better ways of making isk.
---
Hunters cant kill in complete safety whatever they desire using cheap shit anymore. The bots now have bot respond fleets. All you elite pvpers, step up the reddit sperg, demand more nerfs again, before eve dies.
---
Dont think so, Ive got it in my samsung s8+ which has a sd card plugged in
---
Now you're wasting time on Reddit posting about it. Hmmmm.
---
Imagine if you had wasted those hours on any other game. At least in Eve you might learn some valuable skills.
---
Winnerwinnerchickendinner
---
Apply basically this same thing but x10 and you'll have solo PvP. Not only do you have to monitor all that stuff, but you ARE the FC, everything that stands to be gained or lost is yours individually, there's no tidi to help buy you time for decision making, etc.
---
Realme C2 doesn't have the option.
---
Did you self-medicate your stroke with more meth?
---
not sure then sorry
---
Anchor, Ammo, and Broadcast window are really all you need to do for fleet fights. Only takes a few fights for a new guy to learn it all.
---
&gt;so you admitted nullsec had lower or equal risk
---
no, it had higher risk, but not high enough to discourage botting from a profit loss standpoint.
---
September and october will also be interesting after the cyno changes. Hope blackout keeps going. 
---
Fun fact i heard from lowsec folkes, LS is more populated lately from ex-nullsec guys. My guess there is local and that's for some players the savety they need for their netflix-playstyle.
---
Its a shame your opinion of me doesn't matter
---
I literally did this today and now have to re-sort a bunch of rolled abyssal mods. Great chance
---
Can't be bots the blackout killed all the bots silly
---
because that takes effort and CCP can't be bothered to put any effort into their product.
---
Thank ye :)
---
Cool stuff. So sad this is so rare in 2019 :/
---
sad but for a brief moment they were the best looking ships in the game ;)
---
It’s because of the advanced AI every sleeper rat get. They will actively seek out and destroy drones, and ships using remote repair modules or aggressive EWAR.
---
 You can try to use one of your alt in a brick tanked ship with one or two RR modules (if you’re using a Praxis, I’d say your armor tanked ?). That way, you can even tank a bit more damage, although I don’t know if you’re struggling against the rats or not.
---
Concerning your Myrmidon having less troubles, maybe it’s because you used medium drones and they generate less threat to the sleeper AI than heavies ? Don’t know &gt;.&gt;
---
Good stuff! That is one of the main things about EvE, every encounter matters in some way, the butterfly effect is very real in New Eden.
---
It's a pretty cool tradition of paying it forward, back when I was a scrub (2011) I was in FW and a corpie of mine had similar happen to him in LS, which is where I learned of it. I also spent two years in Red vs. Blue which is a great place to learn to be mates with the very people you habitually hunt. Someday you will be the predator and you'll hopefully have the opportunity to pass on the tradition.
---
It's nice to see CCP recognize the value of this, I hope they are able to help some peeps out.
---
Thank you for reminding me that I'm on /r/eve. I forgot for a moment.
---
It is my favourite ship in EVE by a very wide margin. However, losing ships is part of the experience.
---
* Osprey Navy - great at killing frigates/destroyers. Good practice for the Orthrus.
---
* Retribution - good for kiting above class ships. Has good staying power on grid due to good capacitor life. Applies good dps at range.
---
* Wolf - good for kiting other frigates. Basically does what the slicer used to do in the old meta. Fast.
---

Dominix.

How does it feel to have your entire rhetoric made obsolete with the use of a single word?
---
Report?
---
Scanning itself will help you. The more you scan around, the better you’ll get :)
---
Also, I have a little tip to give you concerning scanning down signatures faster. Basically : every signature in the game can only spawn in a 4 AU radius of a celestial body. 
---
This mean that if you see a signature near a planet, for example, instead of selecting the signature and trying to scanning it directly, you can center your probes on the planet and set them at a 4 AU range, it’s generally enough to reduce the scanning passes you need to scan down a signature :)
---
Train up your Scanning skills too ! Its the best QoL upgrade you can have, alongside Hacking and Archeology to finish harder exploration sites.
---
Also can’t use T2 large weapons.
---
This couldn’t possibly be true. Sort Dragon is a CSM member who is Anti bots. He would never ever give additional space to Ranger Regiment for their bots and evict SLYCE because they wouldn’t agree to be goon pets. 
---
How could you ever think this....  sarcasm btw.
---
FC what is primary? 
---
So shoot everyone but that guy?
---
I heard shoot everyone but that guy.
---
Directions unclear, shot everyone but primary
---
"Oooh no a toxic dane loots faster then me he must be cheating"
---
Well, it's also one thing to have an account, but it's another thing to actually play it. I have a couple of unplexed accounts too, but if all they do is seed wormholes, is it really fair to count them?
---
THAT WAS  well no words for that  thanks sedow for the fun
---
Mining and Indy in my experience are slow going to get to where you feel like you’re doing something good. Skilling into a barge would be the first goal with your sights set on an orca ultimately. The skills needed to make yourself a good orca pilot take a while to train so I would either wait on Indy or inject a bit. I’ve finally gotten myself into an orca and can make a decent amount of isk with just mining, but I’m also using two alts in barges to speed up the process.
---
I am literally just repeating what you said lol. So where do you draw the line? I mean rookie ships have close to the same sig as a bomber, should fighters beable to track bombers? Make up your fucking mind
---
Or Wrecking balls/slowcats doctrine.

---
AAR: Would have been cheeper to let the Wyvern die. 
---
Seddow forms goku fleet after strat op gets blue balled. Goons rage forms. Loses Titan’s worth of caps.
---
Sure,  first account is always your subcap. Though placing a mining barge on it is not a bad idea so you can turbo krab when you need to.
---
Second will grab indy 5 and mining barge. Move that to porpoise if you upgrade the 3rd account to omega.
---
Third will grab refining and if you do make it omega a mining barge and PI. The supply chain for the items you wish to make can now all be made by your three toons.  
---
Your not going to stop training, the porpoise  will turn in to a 2 bill boosting rourqal. Your going to probably put a combat capital on the 3rd account. Your going to want to pick up capital industry at some point on an account to put all these minerals to use. Lastly with the change your going to want a dedicated recon pilot as you het in to capital piloting.
---
I think you can post sell orders on the forums concerning wormholes, I’m almost sure I’ve already seen some already.
---
You're welcome for the find mate!
---
Do i need to have stuff setup inside? or do people buy connections?
---
for a newbro there might be some adrenaline involved
---
for most of us it's about whoring on as many targets as we can and thus letting hostile hacs catch reps lol
---
Having some installed facilities inside can increase the price you can set, netting more money (people will generally want a citadel where they can keep their stuff in case of an eviction).
---
Connections are also important, as PVP groups will want connections leading to active space for their needs, PVE groups might want a same tier wormhole for ratting when they run out of anomalies in the wormhole they bought, and for easier logistics an highsec or lowsec connection can also help.
---
Honestly i had the feeling at first but since i learnt how to set boundaries its gone now.
---
Rule 1 never play eve to escape. If you play eve when you feel bad its time to stop and take responsibility  for your life. 
---
Rule 2 never chase others dreams when u play. I play for my director role much more than spaceship elitism and im much happier now.
---
Rule 3 if youre bored in eve youre probably responsible. Go take care of irl or try new stuff.
---
Hope that helps
---
What about it copies EVE's intellectual property?
---
Huh?
---
Pamfam and fraternity keepstars are no where near each other. Also unless you tackled I highly doubt a titan pilot would even try to lock you up, due to it taking upwards of 20 or 30 seconds to do so.
---
Wounds like you misinterpreted the situation but it also sounds like you had fun. So its a big bad of what ever haha
---
&gt;If this is the case, they must have like, 1 person in charge of all balancing.
---
Not as far as i know. From what i understand people like Rise are part of other teams who do other things and this takes priority over balancing. Over the years players have asked CCP to created a dedicated balancing team that can do frequent changes to OP/UP ships/mods but as CCP pointed out in the past; fixing broken things doesnt sell expansions, new content does so nope.
---
So have u seem anyone buy an empty wormhole without anything in it? Just wondering...
---
I hear mighty beans are recruiting 😂
---
/s i have no idea who is noob friend in wh space and can not think of any groups off the top of my head.
---
When your Seddow is Jesus, Init Panda is absolute GOD
---
Looks ways more Arcadey than EVE, is it actually even an MMO?
---
It happens because who cares about 3 frigates
---
Definately a MMO - one of the videos had Amarr looking ships and stations in it.
---
We're all going to die anyway, nothing really matters.
---
Depends how much of it is copied i guess - at first look, it looks like the whole game is EVE Mk2 but with small changes.
---
AAR: GOKU emerges about 5 jumps from 1dq1 and tackles a wyvern.   Wyvern is able to get a cyno up and faxs drop along with a few dreads.   GOKU goes to town on caps, once the are you going to fuck off phase is reached a hel warps to a ihub or something dumb and get tackled.   2nd wave of fax drops to support dumb hel that obviously was an idiot.   After a bit GOKU goes back to 1st spot and kills every remaining fax on grid.    More fax continues to drop.      Now the funny part in this is goons reship harpies like 3-4x.   One of the FC's finally comes out in a monitor for a harpy fleet after previously landing on-grid and eating 20 bombs.    Nice brawl for some late night fun after doing some sov work.   Goons should award the avatar on-grid a medal or something for killing all the inhibs though.
---
F
---
Players campaign for boting accounts to be deleted.
---
Ccp deletes an huge number of accounts according to the msr.
---
Online accounts drop.

:shockedPicachu:
---
YAY Bombers Online is Live!!!
---
This is great
---
That's the prettiest I've seen Eve look in a while, gj!
---
sadly no fix for proving conduit spawn rates, will still be only available for only 1h/day :(
---
Venture change not doing much on botters, they will just use unfitted t1 ships and warp away as soon as someone enters grid, some of them can be fitted to be instawarpable. Why not make Plex capturing an active process that prevents warping while doing it?
---
great to see that the Log's get fixed, that was just a gamebreaking bug
---
Crabstomer!
---
why don't you try making your own fit?
---
Found the nihilist!
---
You wouldn't say that during...uh, whatever time zone this is!
---
If I'd get back every second playing EVE, I'd play EVE with that time.
---
One thing too (and wow suffers from this, as do most MMOs) where things can be, in reality, pretty well balanced or very close, but the community perception can be wildly different that that. I’m not saying that’s the case for any single change, just that in some cases ships can be perceived to be worse than they actually are.
---
👌
---
Is it a mobile game?
---
Mobile and PC - I'm gonna give it a try to see how close this is to EVE when it hits on Tuesday.
---
The reality given in that AMA paints a picture of a company chasing jesus features and consistently failing to iterate on concepts as a whole not just balance. While reddit can distort the truth theres just no reason to leave ships in poorly balanced states for years on end. Why CCP fails to address issues in a timely manner is a genuine gripe that many people have.
---
Honestly the only reason to mine is to make your own shit.
---
But the fleet we are going to fight is caps, that's the point he is trying to make. The cyno changes are worse than citadel spam.
---
&gt; and instead based on some past major EVE lore event.
---
because most people dont F hate prequels. prequels prequels prequels. why in hell would i want to experience some past age?
---
I mean if you feel like you wasted your hours then you probably did. If you enjoyed the experience and weren't too excessive then you probably didn't.
---
The major design flaw of Dust was "PS only" and I would not be surprised that is the reason they can't port it to PC.
---
As long as you have fun man it's not wasted time. If eve isnt fun for you right now then dont play it.
---
NUUN is recruiting
---
EVE will still be around, r/eve will be around and people who want dank leaks and drama will be around until humanity ceases to exist
---
Complete and total stagnation, as defenders will be able to use caps and deny their use to an enemy preventing any and every fight that might matter in the slightest. CCP will be the biggest blueballers ever.
---
It's more of a process, rather than state. Like walking the rope.
---
I will say that was less than fun. gf
---
Anyone with the IQ to amass the resources to build it would also have the IQ not to waste them on a massive white elephant.
---
Except that what we had was 16,000 players and 10,000 bots in nullsec.
---
Now we have 6,000 players and 10,000 bots in hisec.
---
No, we make fun of it because hes wrong....
---
It's okay because we're all actually on a spaceship in automation or deep sleep in a real life simulator playing internet spaceships.
---
They do its mainly  new bros and people that do not understand what there time is worth. 
---
If you want minerals you can park up next to a rourqul pilot  have 59% mining boosts and compression. He will almost certainly buy what ever you put in his fleet hanger if your wanting to sell the minerals.
---
Its straight faster, safer and easier to do this out side of high sec.
---
I think you are mixing nullsec and wormhole space. Or even highsec. Or generally don't understand what the fuck you are talking about.
---
Think his is exactly the right response plus all the “eve is burning “ comments means they have to push next big content instead of being able to stop and re evaluate. Basically let ccp do chaos era,  ride the storm out and if we stop crying they’ll prob rebalance as no pressure to do the next big thing??
---
EVE survived Perpetuum, so I'm sure it'll survive a hybrid mobile / PC MMO that has an "optional" monthly sub in 2019. It looks good coming from EVE as a player in the limited promo, but since it's Chinese MMO, I expect them to go wild with shop options that would even make EA feel queasy when it finally launches, especially due to being mobile in design.  
---
The good in me hopes it provides healthy competition that rattles CCP just enough to make some improvements or even new areas within the game to break up the staleness, since Second Galaxy is boasting to have 50k+ areas within it, as well as scarce resources to gather. Also claims it can support up to like 2.5M concurrent players and 1k battles, meaning they're bringing big guns to the table and feel pretty confident over their title. Here's a random youtuber and article for those interested:

I like massive white elephants

But goons told me Stuka/Goku fleets run away as soon as theres any resistance :o
---
Would have lost less if they just let the wyvern die.
---
Dealing in absolutes is a bit basic.
---
Botting has massively declined would be a better way to put it
---
Bring a scanner, find the new static, leave via that instead. Furthermore, it’s not like null sub doctrines cost much e.g. with feroxes you might as well self destruct if you win.
---
That makes you the exception not the norm then, keep on doing what you’re doing :)

I never thought of the competition aspect of this - they do say that competition is healthy. In another positive note, if people are copying EVE, then its good to see this genre become more mainstream.
---
&gt;  back in the day they had the idea that killing pods should be an extremely brutal activity reserved for your mortal enemies or something like that
---
Ahhh the early naive days of MMOs when we hadn't quite started to scratch the depths of human depravity.
---
Accept that doesn’t really work with an MMO where the players create the content.
---
It was playstation 3 only due to a business decision by CCP. They didn't want to risk eve players cancelling their subs in order to play dust.
---
I see how game which went way too far with "everyone is a winner" and "let's be noobfriendly" lost half the population in 3 years and finally is getting back to being more hardcore, while bleeding usless alts, bots and some retards on the road. The things chaos era is getting rid of have never attracted any player base, it's not some "playstyle" that is going to die. 
---
Please convince me it's not fine.

No he was not, he was moving a mining orca with mining ship inside to the place he wanted to mine. From jita until he died in uedama.

Google is your friend
---
Why do you even care about balance.
---
Obviously if you're too weak you should buy stronger modules and ammo.
---
"It's balanced with isk."
---
How long until people like you understand that eve's combat system is not that great? There are webs, distance and resistance rock paper scissors. All the interesting stuff is locked to specific hulls.
---
And there is nothing you can do in the heat of the moment if you're ship is not fit for the situation.
---
How do you "balance" that 100km range point that was posted the other day?
---
&gt;"But my toy isn't fun now."
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
3 frigates is about triple the amount of frigates that justifies lighting a cyno and jumping 10 carriers in these days.  
---
I am not sad about cynos on assault frigates going away.
---
Guess I didn't really think that through huehuehue
---
he's being a retarded edgelord but yeah nerfing jaguar may bring the myth of balance closer to reality
---
As iratus pointed out, you’re simply ignorant of how existing wormhole mechanics function, so unqualified to advocate for changes to make it riskier. No pvp group rolls their static for pve content, and if you take away that ability, they won’t be able to find pvp content, or be the threat that makes pve content risky. 
---
To add risk to pve you just need to add more roaming holes and maybe drop their lifetime so they cycle faster.
---
A crucial difference that seems to go unnoticed is between wormholers and null is that we have not been advocating for changes to make pve safer, in fact we have been asking for several changes to make pve more risky for over 2 years at this point. We want more pvp content opportunities, and the unrollable/higher variance statics would result in fewer...
---
Eve Uni has a wormholes division, but I think you have to be in the Corp for one month first. It was where I got started
---
damage to rof was an elegant solution that wasn't enough in the end  
---
lmao if you think claw's problem is the lack of alpha atm
---
I wonder how many people cancelled their subs to have the money for a PS3 :)
---
1/3 ? That little?
---
Thanks for the answer! So my second account toon's gonna go for industry and mining barge, and my third (alpha) refining. I reckon wiki can handle the details for me. Now is there a difference in race I choose or can I go with what I like?
---
Also what about trading/hauling thingy, do you think it is worth it for yet another account or a supporting toon on already existing account? Or maybe I should skip it for now?
---
Thank you for the information, I have a clearer vision now.
---
Avatar was mine and ya we would have lost probably less had we not got split on two grids. Basically the mango hel messed us up really badly.
---
You can take any ship in the game and make it work somehow. I wouldnt say half the ships are unused.
---
I use freighters for npc ratting. I really don't know what I'm doing

My happiness with my life and my time spent on this game historically had an inverse relationship. That’s just me, but I haven’t played in a long time because I’ve been a happier and more fulfilled person IRL. I’m still interested in the happenings of the universe though, so here I am commenting on the reddit.
---
message me in game. Davey Seed
---
https://youtu.be/qCvaK1ugd04?t=292  
---
"Upgrade now" for what looks like Premium Credits. No thanks, I will stick with EVE.
---
It'll likely just mean that caps will be deployed off grid of an engagement. Instead of cynoing in on a fight, the other side will just cyno in off grid then warp to the fight.
---
Why not? I find current eve much more enjoyable than a year or two ago, despite lower online numbers. It's not like online is linearly tied to amount of content and most players create nothing. 80% of blue doughnut can unsub and they will be only one who notice it.
---
Rookie ships also have absurdly low DPS. So sure, in the same way that a thousand paper cuts would presumably kill a person absolutely if you have enough rookie ships you should be able to kill a supercapital. However, that's neither here nor there, as the point is more focused on *reasonable* balance situations, like cruiser fleets against supers that we see every week.
---
So to summarise, you tried to run away from a PL Supercap move op, but followed the same route as them. When you are moving supers you don’t take pot shots at other random shit that’s about because you get an aggression timer, which means if things go wrong you may find your super stuck on a structure you cannot safe log and will get bumped and die. You didn’t escape and evade, they just weren’t interested, sorry fam.
---
Well we all know what happens next goon deployment
---
Mittens is gonna scream knowing **WHAT THE FUCK GOES ON IN THIS GAME** and *invades panfam* lmao
---
So before I go on, cool for you for finding it enjoyable. I do as well. So, with less people, less people spread through out the game making it harder to find content. Just because there’s a blue doughnut doesn’t mean the  allies won’t get dropped hard by allies (just look at goons dreadbombing a titan and seddows goku fleet)
---
Was there when the record PCU happen. Can't really say that much changed at all, same shit with same risk averse krabs that never provide any meaninful content and maybe less bots.

why don't you look for CEO counseling yourself Hilmarr....

Maybe try responding with ships other than caps?

How do you report someone without their name ?

Because this is /r/Eve and this is where the krabs come to entertain themselves, with or without big changes. Literally nothing they said matters.
---
Make RR BS GREAT AGAIN!
---
Hey man keep us posted on your thoughts after you've played a few hours please.
---
This would leave to null to having their private jump bridge to 4-4 and every other connection to non-null cut off for the sake of krabbing.
---
I fear you underestimate the unacceptable level of risk involved in the warping side. Caps never warp into a fight even when they have overwhelming numbers (that's why supercap umbrellas never save anyone in their own staging system, not because they are too lazy to go anywhere without a cyno). After the cyno changes the defender will always "win" without a fight meaning that: -
---
a) nullsec will be come MORE stagnant.
---
b) citadels are now even more unkillable.
---
You must work for pearl abyss.
---
Answer: no, only pussies like you, and look, there's many...
---
Great advice above but I'd start cheap and work up. You will die a bunch which is fine but can get expensive.
---
..that if you fall for it, you're troll-vulnerable...
---
yes, we're toxic, wtf do you expect? the devs make sure to create new bittervets out of thin air with every new change to the game ("oh, look bois we thought this new thing will be good for us all!!" ...."here we go again....")
---
Ferox online best game....
---
Because you want to whore on every target and following strictly primary will result in not getting on every kill.

&gt;  I do believe it was an original mechanic because back in the day they had the idea that killing pods should be an extremely brutal activity reserved for your mortal enemies or something like that
---
This reminds me of that issue in Ultima online where they tried to build a virtual ecosystem, and players destroyed it by senselessly killing everything that moves https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFNxJVTJleE
---
!remindme 2 years
---
The point is, game requires way less than 10k online to be full of all the content you want. And as AU TZ player i somewhat speak from experience here.
---
Look up the rule of 6 on youtube
---
if you could find a reference where one super and a bunch of faxes killed Stuka/Goku fleets I would be interested in reading up on that!
---
Nicely executed. Well done!
---
Was this arranged?
---
report the watchdog pod and related accounts will be flagged as well
---
Email security@ccpgames.com with details and they'll investigate
---
"..hold my beer!"
---
Yeah this would make sense and avoid a huge shortage on release day.
---
Fixed an issue where logs from the client would indicate when a cloaked ship on grid initiates warp.
---
Because it doesn't make them money.
---
I'm in no way deducting away from what Test accomplished, good job to them. With that said, your comment is painful to read based on the shear ignorance. Here is why:
---
* Getting everyone to quickly stop what they are doing is quite a task.
---
* Getting together a subcap response takes times.
---
* Establishing logistics for said subcap fleet (i.e. bridging titan) takes even more time.
---
* Motivating a bunch of nerds to insta-form a solid subcap doctrine capable of countering 100 bombers / kitey stuff is impossible - I don't care who you are. 
---
* Anything less than a 50+ man subcap fleet of assault frigates is going to eat shit and have no effect.
---
* Anything more than a 40+ man subcap fleet of assault frigates will result in the enemy instantly fucking off.
---
* You are completely neglecting the fact that a super capital is tackled and required capital assistance.
---
* You are completely neglecting the fact that the best course of action in a situation like this is to essentially drop a hammer and hope they just fuck off.
---
* There is no counter to the stuka fleet except either crazy-good skill shots with bosons / lances or a fleet specifically designed to counter stukas which lands you at one or two options. Neither of those two options can respond in a timely manner.
---
* You are completely neglecting the fact that a spontaneous insta-form consists of numerous real-humans so you can expect an initial 50-75% fuck up rate on the get go.
---
* Then there is the Hel.
---
I hope this clears things up for you.
---
they ban them so they can record-start new unique accounts... so Hilmar can boast
---
You can tell Sedow that Ron just jumped ahead of him in the cool kids line.
---
Myrms, dominixes, can bomb excavators, ishtars if you’re up for a bit of risk.
---
Mining barges, i wouldn’t go for procurers and skiffs though
---
What I see is mostly a game that copies all the same things eve copies and then made all original stuff where eve has original stuff
---
it's really not hard to multibox that many myrms when it takes them 30 minutes to clear  site.
---
Hell, of it's better, that's good too.
---
I do like the look of the orca. It just visually looks so well suited to it's functions.

People still just jump caps in at stukas ?
---
Not buy, I’m not actively seeking wormhole sale ads to be honest. But I guess if it has connections that fit perfectly to someone’s needs (maybe even an added effect that can further please them ?), someone might want it ?
---
if people keep yelling to the ship captain "***iceberg! ICEBERG! Iceberg!***" and he doesn't pay attention or hear it until the 100th time it's yelled and manages to make a last minute maneuver to avoid disaster it's still worth yelling 100 times and more.
---
maybe you should screech more on r/eve until CCP delivers you a solo-campaign offline mode
---
I'm very much remembering it.
---
Where they turned the local in nullsec off ‘temporarily’
---
For some bizare reason(and there must be a good reason for it) many game companies have trouble with the balancing aspect of their game.
---
Wow has the exact same issue, where some classes are completely broken and are either overperforming or the opposite.
---
IT seems like CCP is working on a scrum like process, where they only work on their designated project. Doing balance is a project, and therefore need to take priority over other projects that are deemed equally, or more important than balance changes. 
---
In my opinion i think it's a shame that it does not get more focus. Here they can do concrete and absolute changes, that can breath fresh air into the meta. In effect it'll enable people to try out new fits and give a strong incentive to undock.
---
I fully agree. I screamed like a little girl when I first saw it :-). It is such a beautiful ship. I love the looks, the versatility, I can build one myself if I have to, there’s nothing I don’t like about that ship.
---
When they were new they only had 3 high slots, now they have 6. I love that ship to pieces.
---
we pew pewed eve uni wormhole corp for a few days and the rank and file enjoyed it immensely. Then the WH leader bear tinyballed dickhead running it Diploed our CEO crying about it and got us to leave so they could bear in peace. Made Eve uni chaps there stop engaging/having fun.
---
nah
---
like what? being a sociopathic asshole ready to stab his friends at the blink of an eye?
---
So as a wormholer you are qualified to explain how PVE and PVP works in nullsec but when someone tells you, that is not how it works those are just carebears crying about nerfs. 
---
If PVE players were unable to crit their wormholes and restrict entry into their system they would be much more vulnerable. If this hurts PVPers, as you and your cohorts have been celebrating for nullsec, then so be it. You seem more than happy to see nullsec suffer so I have no sympathy for you.
---
It very much is, yes :)
---
That doesn't sound like a win to me if we are still losing our entire fleet.
---
something that happens when developers restrict the oxygen supply to the brain
---
Yes as an Indy guy a barge first then skilling to an orca.   When you can bring some other barge alts online (you can skill point farm them to save some isk/rl $) once they are skilled.  Also will give you more build slots for industry as well.
---
The fc in the monitor would be me after the 4-5th time the original harpy fc died I finally logged in and took over
---
Maybe you should screech less in general?
---
Nothing about it said temporary.
---
The wording was "indefinitely".
---
No test had a wormhole and used it we would do the same if we found something to catch
---
I always thought having EVE players drop clone trooper commodity items into a shuttle pod type thing and injecting them into enemy structures (to represent lives) and then posting good ISK for the contract to "win" the encounter was the way to go. Then the shooter players would play a short mission in an immersive sim style (think Deus Ex, Prey 2017, System Shock 2) vs AI (or other players if the defender has a counter contract) would be the thing to do.
---
All of them were in one anomaly.  Pin point on a 5 degree. I warp and land only to see wrecks. Did not screenshot who those wrecks belong to. I then warped to a fortizar(dscan) and find all of them dock except one that just landed. Then he docked too. Its pretty obvious, there isn't that many sites in the system anyway.
---
I managed to kill the watchdog pod. Heh
---
Looks like a steaming pile of turd tbh.
---
As someone formerly living in null, and someone who gets most of their content in null via a null sec static, its pretty clear I have more experience in null than you have in wormhole space.
---
PvE players critting a hole is not enough to prevent them dying, all it does is restrict what you can take through to kill them, and necessitates taking a scanner through so you can find a way out again afterwards. The risk in high class space predominantly comes from other groups rolling a connection to you, not through your own crit/rolled off chain. Again, you prove yourself insufficiently knowledgeable to discuss these matters.
---
The PvE problems (which we have been pushing for fixes for, for years) where risk was lacking were FoF farming, which has finally been fixed, mjd BS in sites, for which we have asked for scrams instead of points on the NPCs, and Astra farming, which CCP seem content to ignore, to our chagrin. Otherwise, to get the big income, you are sieging up 15-30b of dreads, which will, and do, die if someone rolls into them. 
---
PvE risk/reward in nullsec was (and arguably still is, if differently so) broken, and had been for years. If you think differently you’re delusional or too new to know any better. PvP in nullsec is currently in a poor place on large scale because conflict drivers are lacking and structure/sov gameplay is not fun. On small scale power/projection disparity on capital vs subcapital hulls ruins most content, and the large coalitions diminish availability.
---
Idk which BR you're looking at but the one i'm seeing here has almost 50 supers and a harpy fleet that got ripped a new one.  
---
But i think we already determined last time that your argument in reality isn't "grr, you don't fight", it's "grr, you don't feed".
---
It’s an irrelevance to the line member with SRP, and it’s a win for all the players content-wise. Have you not noticed that subcap doctrines are economically irrelevant in their cost to larger alliances? The only reason losses at that scale is morale, and if it’s an active choice to fight, and then risk self destruction if you win, that’s not an issue either.
---
For some reason, CCP will only focus in one area at a time. It will take them months to review and theory craft a balance. One it’s agreed upon they deploy it, watch it for a bit them move on to revisit it several years down the road.
---
CCP main excuse is not having the personal and resources to constantly fix all issues and balances. They also rely heavily on the CSM which had their voters complain about cyno updates and blackout. So when the CSM went to talk to CCP, majority of their time was filled with discussion on blackout and cynos while WH, LS, FW, ship balances, etc barely received any light.
---
So if you want a change, players need to vote so the CSM isn’t focused on nullsec carebearing. Get CSM member who well diversified in different playstyles and interested in the general health of the game. Otherwise, it will always be filled with 90% of member who will pamper null and feed into their selfish needs.
---
Problem is the battle report you see is split between two grids there were never 50 supers at one time. That said yes the harpies ate shit multiple times.
---
i'm a community developer for eve online :)
---
Your actually so dumb? Literally Jackdaw's or a decent FC with Munins *surprised pikachu*
---
So would you say the Gokus fought the resistance you brought in?
---
Insert expert cry post No9000.
---
&gt;o u can only live in a
---
At this moment I hunt very little. Its more crabbing at this moment. But pretty soon I will start hunting again.
---
How do you start? Let's say you warp into a new fresh hole and you see a citadel on 8AU, but nothing on grid. You can warp cloaked to this citadel and check if there are any players docked. It could be that they're just idle, it could also be that in a few minutes you see someone undocking. Depending on the ships, you can sometimes predict what they will do. 
---
Is the person in an Astero, Helios, Buzzard etc, then most likely he will warp to the hole you just opened. If its rolling ships, they might want to close the hole you just opened. If its an Epithal, they will do some PI so watch to what custom office they fly. If there is a null sec static and their killboard shows lots of kills in null, thats where they will go. If you see a hauler and there is a HS in the chain, pretty sure he's going there to sell or buy some goodies.
---
This type of hunting is basically trying to understand what they're doing so you can search for a weak spot. For example three megathrons trying to close a hole that is 80AU from their citadel, means its a large warp to get some help. You could target the last one jumping through, scram/web the guy and shoot him.
---
With 1 toon? I would not recommend that. I would play with at least 2 but preferred more accounts.
---
Remove HAW from capitals please.
---
Who's getting fucked? Who hates crabs? What are you even talking about?
---
I struggle to believe that in the extra minutes a few fax buy, you can’t form a proper response fleet. XIX can (and have consistently done so) ping 50 muninns in 5 minutes, pretty sure a form of that size and nature meets the necessary criteria to push the bomber fleet off. Is it more important to save the tackled super or kill the goku fleet? You mention both in the same list.
---
Your points about logistical complexity are well and good, but stacked up against defender advantage don’t really count for much once attacker’s initiative is lost a few minutes after they strike.
---
The people that worry so much about balance and not about the bigger picture must be Bernie supporters. Fuck sake enjoy the damn game people. I log in every day and pay my subs because I love the damn game. Ccp is running a business, content is their business. The game
---
Is complex, get over it. Black out is fantastic. Yea my rorq is retired and I’ll probably extract the skills from my two rorq pilots but who cares. Only the people with 15 rorq toons that were ruining the game’s economy( goons).  Bunch of whinny bitches who over analyze shit they have no control over. Fucking nerds
---
This. The interface makes me want to hurt myself.
---
(Unless you're horde and warp the jackdaws in at a perfect bombing angle)
---
I think that citadelspam is terrible is a thing we can all agree on.
---
Well, that is a good point.  I guess it depends on what the devs want the game to be.  If they want to have the most hardcore game in the world with just 5000 players and their alts.... then yeah; they're on the right path.  However, if they want a successful game that makes lots of money for their shareholders, then no.  Before the Drifters showed up, Hilmar himself said that injecting more people into nullsec would drive conflict and lead to the types of changes that we want.  I guess they decided to go another way with it.
---
I didn't say that we don't need change.  Just that chaos isn't taking the game in a healthy direction.  We need actual changes that answer the problems with the game now and set us up to keep the game engaging for another decade.  This ain't it.
---
I mean, off the top of my head, getting rid of concord would have been healthier for the game.  No Concord, more highsec ganking.  Shake up affect the largest player base in the game.  Highsec no longer safe.  Safety can only be found with lots of friends, which generally means in wormholes or in nullsec.  More people in these areas of space, botters and renters get displaced.  Coalitions grow larger and need more space, which drives more sov wars.
---
dont kid yourself now

---
I do recommend gas huffing for new players as its a pretty simple income. Now I usually park 4 ventures in a gas belt. If you find an Instrumental Core Reservoir, this sheet tells you that you can clear this belt in 3 hours and 38 minutes. With 4 toons this is +- 55 minutes to get 400M in gas.
---
I only harvest gas when I'm doing something else. I just can't watch 55 minutes to the same ships flying around a gas belt. So it feels a bit like a semi-passive income.
---
Because Hilmar is there
---
It's only NRDS in provi
---
I mean today I decided to take a 5 mil merlin out on a solo roam (since I haven't do e Amy PvP roaming  since I got back) and got cyno dropped and killed by a carrier so
---
You literally have no idea the balance. The mer shows wspace collectively makes 80% of what null does but you act like null is still to safe a makes to much. Do you think there are 80% the people of null in wspace or US it a small group making a lot of isk. If pve players couldn't crit their holes you wouldn't have to resort to rolling into them, you could find it in the chain. This would change thing for pvp players but would also expose pve players to more risk. It seems to you just want free kills in null, but want your space kept safe and don't actually care if your desire for easy pvp hurts the game.
---
So it won't happen :(
---
Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted
---
What is the risk?
---
[https://www.eveworkbench.com/](https://www.eveworkbench.com/) should be helpful or zkill
---
&gt;And there is nothing you can do in the heat of the moment if you're ship is not fit for the situation.
---
And this guides fits to extreme specialisation. If you're going to play rock paper scissors you may as well have max out on one of those attributes through compound %age fitting.
---
Yeah i suspect the null sec numbers are going to be lower for September.
---
Everything. Where do you think the ships, guns, and modules you buy in Jita came from? Someone built/looted them and they were hauled to jita.
---
Looks like you're not enjoying your Eve time, maybe it's time to stop mining space riches and actually have some fun.
---
Hey, but Sans is in smash now!
---
I feel like Eve is like the only thing that gives you joy in your pathetic life and that is why you keep crying like a little bitch day in and day out. Grow up. Eve is owned by CCP and they can do whatever the hell they want with it. They don't have to do anything for you. If they lose money for their wrong decisions it is their problem not yours. If they fail, they fail. If Eve shutdowns, it shutdowns. Move on. Get a life.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/puj0c3/nullsec-local-blackout-in-effect
---
Gokus fought the supers just fine. There was not a critical mass of carriers to punch through the speed and sig tank. As for the resistance I brought in not at all I logged in after the first several harpy welps and seddow left when I land on grid.
---
Capitals warping is a shitshow.
---
Aligning takes upwards of a minute. Capitals are often set to not follow fleet warps because it is more disastrous for caps than subs when it goes wrong. This means caps all have to manually warp. When that happens you lose 2-5% of your fleet to miswarps (they go to the sun or the wrong gate/planet/whatever) and even for those that get it right there is a lag of up to a minute between the first warp off and the stragglers getting into warp, yes even with a minute or two of aligning. This makes cap fleets highly vulnerable to losing stragglers to tackle. It all adds up.
---
And that is BEFORE you factor in the defenders making the grid a toxic deathtrap for warping capitals in advance.
---
Do all of this which a fleet of supers and you are losing 15-30bil per lost ship AND you are more likely to lose the  actual fight/objective as well.
---
Compare all that to simply opening up a cyno and saying "jump to XY in AB".
---
Or you could just say "fuck it" and wait for the next chaos change to maybe make the game worth playing. It's not like it can get much worse right now.
---
Just a clarification - collectively faucets is not the same as generates for the player - WH doesn’t get the loot drops like NS does. 
---
You keep arguing about being able to find these non crit holes in chain but it just doesn’t work like that. Short of ‘go and see for yourself by joining a WH pvp group’ I’m not going to be able to explain why that’s wrong because I don’t know exactly where your misconception is rooted.
---
I will restate this again though - if rolling mechanics are broken, through inability to roll the hole (no mass limit) or increased mass variance, pve will get *safer* because the pvp groups won’t be able to hunt or connect to each other to even the inconsistent degree at the moment.
---
I’m not invested in WH isk generation methods particularly - we don’t have any kind of high class hole (farm or otherwise) and I can assure you that there is no dank isk for a group to make in a C3.
---
In nullsec, local chat used to work like it does in HS/LS (people show up as soon as they enter system and leave the channel when they log off/leave system).
---
The blackout is CCP changing local to work like in wormholes (you appear if you talk and stay there for 15 mins).
---
The problem was that it's too easy to bot. There's plenty of other ways to make isk and I'm glad you found one that works for you.
---
Evict Slyce because it wasn't going to be goon pets? Is that the new spin on that, wow.
---
Supers were split between two grids. Then as supers were jumping out from the initial grid, gokus landed and tackled 4 supers. So we had to commit more faxes. It was never 50 supers at the same time on the same grid.
---
I don’t think Nomen recommendations can be taken seriously anymore. The jaguar has since tarnished the glory of the nomen.
---
Just a note you say you struggle to do stuff when nothings going on - maybe I’ve misunderstood but in wormholes I’ve found one has to do a lot more themselves generally speaking. Not trying to put you off just don’t want you burning out because you don’t end up liking wormholes! 
---
Best place to live imo if you are willing to put the work in. Hope you find a group that helps !
---
Is it really that hard? Is there no other areas in space to go to? Nothing else to do but rat in a solo subcap in null?
---
I have said this from day one of the Blackout killed the bots, and yeah VNI changes (that part i liked as i like new pvp ships). 
---
You can't out program bots. They will just come back in another form. You can only out program the lazy botters that give up on making changes. 
---
The ones that still see a profit it in will still bot.
---
I never hunted in null sec because it felt kind of dumb watching everyone warp off when I got in local.
---
whats pearl abyss ?
---
If I had to guess, what we call broken, they (wrongly, imo) call the meta.
---
I'm glad i waited for the end.
---
What I actually think is, since you have no idea how computers work, you should use an existing program for that. People talked about Seat, I don't know it but I can tell you that, with a PhD in informatics, I had to work on my ESI side project one year until I had a correct lib - and I still am working on it, making new performance features, fixing bugs, etc.
---
I mean, I’m not defending anything (nor do I work in game development) but I’d imagine it’s pretty damned hard. Think about how many variables affect the balance of a given ship. Then think about how interconnected those are (eg, if you adjust one thing, that affects the capacitor drain/CPU/etc, which affects nearly every other system, potentially changing what can be fit as well as overall performance). Then you have to compare the changed ship with every other in its class to verify that you haven’t given anything an unfair advantage over another. And it’s not like you can just look at a single number and say, “well this ship is a 90 now and this one’s an 85.” You have to determine balance based on numerous, potentially disparate systems. And imagine the testing involved - how much data they probably need to sift through, how many fits they have to check, how many hours spent trying to figure out how users are going to try to find that one perfect combination that exposes an unfair advantage based on a seemingly minor change.
---
Maybe I’m thinking about it wrong -as I said, I’m not a game developer. But as a developer, the idea of making a change like this (let alone several) gives me some level of heartburn.
---
Literally dont understand the words coming out of your mouth. I think you were in such a hurry to shit on BBTB that you shit on yourself instead..
---
Leadership, management, social, business, etc. There's plenty of crossover of EVE and 'RL' if you look at it from a certain perspective. I guess it's like anything, really.
---
What a title to click on, let alone upvote.
---
Imagine your brain values a pixel spaceship at the same level as your life.
---
Ok
---
Check out Spoopy Newbies, brave Newbies wh corp.
---
He was joking man :P
---
IIRC something roughly similar was done with carriers and triage with the change to faxes
---
The hell is a Ramjag? I tried a quick googlensearch and NUFFFIN
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Because internet spaceships...get over it nerds. Go move to Reykjavík  apply for a dev job at ccp and do something about it. Or just shut up and pay your subs.
---
There was still a response that exceeded one super and a few faxes and given how much of it died it looks like the Gokus fought back and didn't just immediately run away. If you want to argue just how much exactly was on field then you do you, it won't invalidate my point.
---
Exactly why it won't happen. This is a "new" feature from CCP, it can only be quarter assed and then updated later to become half assed. 
---
They've gone through efforts of changing icons so items didn't have the same icon to avoid confusion and proceeded to use the same icon for this.
---
This is the brightest timeline then.
---
Fit speed not DDA and tank if your exploration fit.
---
Dota 2 has *one guy* doing game balance and they release very frequent balance patches.
---
The game was stagnant...
---
But had more players.
---
But you blame that it was stagnant
---
When it had MORE PLAYERS
---
Good god you wormholer tag people drink some insane koolaid to think around things like this x.x
---
So Jaguars are insanely fast for an assault frig, with a few overdrives it can reach near-interceptor speeds. So people fit it with a huge tank and hard tackle and fly it straight into kiting ships. They're extremely powerful because the ADC makes them essentially unkillable for 15s so secondary tackle has time to get there.
---
Ramjags are so prevalent that the first consideration of a kiting ship is usually "how well does it handle ramjags?" and if it can't, it'll just die.
---
Pretty much hits every hallmark of something very overpowered: brainless to use, reliable, meta-defining, extremely cost effective
---
Ah yes.  I too want a game where everyone lets me win and plays my way and the game to change if they play in a way that beats me.
---
But i cant afford my own game company, lucky for you Hilmar can though, and he is willing to DESTROY this game to make it his way &gt; anyone and everyone else's alongside his vocal minority :)
---
Wormhole Society (WHSOC) are probably the best Newbie-friendly WH corp out there.

Haven't been paying attention to Eve lately due to rl, but I just learnt poverty jump freighters (rorqs) won't be able to use INDUSTRIAL cynos

---
I thought that was was happened when industrial core was activated.
---
They arent the covops cloak abusers hiding in solo-able c5 wormholes mate.
---
&gt;How long until people like you understand that eve's combat system is not that great? There are webs, distance and resistance rock paper scissors. And that's basically it. All the interesting stuff is locked to specific hulls.
---
Really outed yourself as bad here
---
A Jaguar with an AB, MWD, warp scram, 2 medium anciliary shield boosters, and an ADC. Ramjags are fast and tanky, so they're used as a sort of a heavy interceptor for tackling.
---
It can come in fast with the MWD to scram a target, and once it gets in, even if you can get a counter-scram on it, the ship can just move around on its AB. It's also hard to kill due to a combination of its speed, sig res, and T2 resists, so what limited damage it takes is quickly mitigated by those oversized shield boosters. And the coup de grace: if it still ends up in a bad situation, it can activate that ADC for a further 75% damage reduction for 15 seconds, either allowing it to hold on to a target (generally until it's dead), or disengage and recharge.
---
By that logic its no longer 16400 + 10k bots
---
its 6400 + 10k bots
---
It's the company which purchased ~~a massive white elephant~~ CCP.
---
Its actually where "cloaked" and "wormhole" people come to show how tough and smart they are while everyone else is wrong in their eyes NO MATTER the data or logic brought to them
---
Era of the kikimora
---
I'd say the drake was never really OP tbf. It was popular mostly because it was extremely easy to fly in most roles, you could rat with it, and it was low on the target priority list, so if you brought it to a kitchen sink home def fleet, you'd probably survive. Just a very newbie friendly fit in general.
---
Now that's what I call edgy

The average response to a stuka fleet.
---
I think your hitting on one of the main issues with the current meta that blackout / cyno changes will hopefully fix.
---
People have gotten used to pve in supers where they know if things go wrong it’s insta cyno and wait for the umbrella to save them. The umbrella knows the cyno will last a while so they can chill semi afk / wait for pings / get in on the first cyno or latter cynos.
---
This has been going on long enough people think the umbrella mechanic is a sign of organization and forgotten that compared to subcap response fleets (old days), the umbrella mechanic is easy mode.
---
There are plenty of subcap responses to bombers. Yes they take to time to form, no they are not easy mode. They shouldn’t be. If your out by yourself in a capital / super you shouldn’t get an automatic get out of jail free card. It should take effort to counter.
---
I think once people accept easy mode is going away, they will be surprised how well they can adapt. I started this game in TEST when the Honey Badger Coalition was on it’s prime, I remember the response fleets to ‘blue titan / super tackled’. 
---
It’s not easy and full proof, it shouldn’t be. That’s the point.
---
I can live with that, how would you counter this then?
---
&gt;How do you "balance" that 100km range point that was posted the other day?
---
Why not both?
---
Because you seriously think that the blackout was about hurting the bots ?
---
30 % of my corporation is MIA and this is only a preliminary census, I think it is worse than that. I can assure you that they weren't bots, it was people who just wanted to contribute to something even if they mostly only mine/farm after their IRL job. Few times, they took fleets for home defence but not as such as a "PVP player" because they have a LIFE.
---
The Blackout discouraged them to log in. Going back into high-sec isn't contributing to anything, and being a target practice for the now risk-free "PVP players" isn't motivating. We am trying to figure out some ways to mitigate the damage, but the fact is that the Blackout is a disaster for many.
---
It wasn't what I thought initially when the amount of logged off didn't have exceeded 15 %, I even wrote here that I expected more logged off. But now even in Eve-Offline, a full crash is going on. It was just a matter of time.
---
When there was newbros in the corp, in null, I went with them and we used shitfit so they would not be afraid to lose it.
---
We had someone at the gate (previous system, in a pod) telling us to dock when people where coming.
---
I'd say 11/10. Even absolute krabs and jita traders would rush to get a green entry on their kb
---
it's all straw from the neck below!

How is it a counter-point tho? Tidi is adrenaline killer if anything.

Bring extra sets of probes in case of disconnect.

When I left CSM X I legit thought tiericide would be done in a year. Oof
---
Not really. Watch the vid.
---
literally lol
---
Your name is literary DarkSasukexXx
---
The average response is *bring all dem supers!!*. The command "frag fighters" is stuck in my brain by now.
---
As I understood from CCP Falcon(?) at last year's fanfest in Iceland, they are aware of these things but once they notice a particular ship is being strongly preferred won't rush as top priority to nerf it so as to give different ships some time in the spotlight. They were discussing the Loki then and its popularity. 
---
Makes sense to me as if the trending ships shift over time it also incentivizes extra skill acquisition. Since acquiring skills can take a while, preferences shifting more gradually also makes sense.
---
I love you and your videos
---
And my answer to that (rather ignorant) argument against blackout is: While some bots might (will!) survive the Blackout, the big difference between now and then is that it actually takes real programming to make a bot now and even WITH real programming, no bots will ever be 100% safe. 
---
Before black literally anyone with a macroprogram with an OCR (read: all of them) could create a "botfarm" within a few minutes and 0 programming experience.
---
Now, it takes dedication, programming AND more expensive ships to even get a bot to work, and even with that you are not safe because of no local.
---
CCP has even less an idea about EVE balance than your average player
---
I always wondered why all the ships were so shit. Then I saw the VNI nerf. I get more fucking DPS out of the medium drones. Wtf CCP.
---
You forgot to mention that the team responsible for balancing already deployed assets is always criminally small and rarely sufficient for the tasks they are commonly assigned.  
---
The folks assigned are usually only a handful, and if it isn't gamebreaking (defined by them, not us) it's never an all hands on deck situation
---
You are stupid.
---
Balance too fast and the meta had no time to stabilize and your balance is completely useless. 
---
There is no end to balancing. Why would CCP place more money in a thing that can't be finished ? That can't be evaluated ? Just because the "balanced" is a reality in your mind, does not make it real for everybody - especially not for devs who already have to work on this on problems that users have no idea.
---
Let's say I'm in an abyssal site and want to orbit the gate at 20km. Because there are rock formations on the left and right of the gate I want the orbit to be aligned such that it avoids the rocks. For concreteness sake, I want the orbit plane to be vertical, with the face of this plane pointing perpendicular to the line between the ship and the gate.
---
Now, if I burn towards the gate and slightly down, such that I would end up tangentially to my intended orbit, then I would assume that the game sets up said orbit because it requires the least amount of maneuvering given my target, current speed, and direction.
---
Instead it seems to choose some random 20km orbit around the gate. My question is: is the game choosing the orbit parameters indeed randomly or are the rules that would allow me to set my speed and bearing such that I end up in the orbit I want?
---
Seriously? Is thay all you can say to a new player that asks a legitimate question?
---
One of the ccp guys said on one of their 'shows' that tiericide and the implants got pushed by 'blackout and chaos era'...........................................
---
Cargo scanner in the empty mid. Never not cherry pick.
---
If you finish for the day near a system like this and manage to kill the pod they'll have no way of knowing you didn't log-out in- system, good chance you'd be able to bypass the security that way but out does rely on delicate timing.
---
Wut?
---
We got a kinda nice balace change recen- last year. 
---
Corax got the pg it needed and the cyclone got 15 cpu for some reason i still dont understand.
---
And actually spend *effort* forming a cohesive subcap fleet counter? That’s too much work! Those don’t even have a jump drive, you’d have to *gate them* like a plebeian.
---
For the same reason there are no scientist working on Tesla's infinite energy : because it's a myth. It does not exist and it's actually an idea that was already debunked many times. But people still want CCP to spend money on illusions …

Are you serious?

---
When you land you anchor, then forget about it. 
---
Spider tanking is not very much used in todays meta. And when used it's mostly on drone ships
---
This is where you target from. 
---
Just close down the overview. You dont need to be looking at that. 
---
You take damage you just broadcast. The only other thing you have to do while doing that is looking at watchlist and ctrl + click targets from there
---
a none factor as almost every doctrine is cap stable
---
What about it? you forgot to bring ammo before you had to undock and think about anything on the above
---
Same as ammunition. This should be done before you undock. And if you run out you'll not be alone and the FC probably already knows
---
Making them assist is to hard?
---
Again something you dont have to bother about unless the FC asks and is trying to disengage. At that point you dont have to think about any of the above either. 
---
Only 2 or 3 of the above points could take your attention at the same time. It's not like you have to think about everything at the same time.
---
no pooors
---
Apparently your reading skills are less then fantastic. No where did place a argument against the blackout. Please take a moment to reread. 
---
Also in eve, i can currently point out at least 3 places i could initialize a bot where it would be "100% safe". Next thank you for proving my point that all it does is remove the lazy farmer. 
---
Lastly, you can't out farm a bot, price of the ship matters very little when you can farm 5x the cost of that ship cost in a day. ( no mattet the scale). Losses are always expected when botting. Now a new meta will form. But as long as it will turn a profit it won't end. In fact with a few of the more recent changes, i will expect a new breed or two to start showing up.
---
Great cyno change. 
---
As someone who is living alone in deep NPC null, i can’t get back to HS because i need a BR or DST to light cyno’s and i don’t have one here. The market here is also dead. I can search for a WH that leads to HS or i can try to cross 45 hostile lowsec/nullsec systems.
---
This means i also have to buy like 10 dst’s/br’s and move them to my cyno systems that are full of hostiles and likely lose them. Yeah, not going to happen. 
---
This patch is going to destroy my gameplay. Well, i’m going to destroy my sub. 
---
Time to wrap things up here. 
---
Watch out for a lot of contracts in the Stain region if you want my stuff.
---
Well that is even more exciting.
---
You can go with whatever race you like, very small differences that can be made up in less than a week of training.  Some people choose based on starting systems to have the school system close to Jita.  My trader is just a second toon on an account.  I have a barge alt crosstrained to hauling.  Another thing with industry is you can potentially use all the toons on each account to have more build slots.
---
CCP like to do a lot of number crunching and examination/data sets before they even think about changing something.
---
The word you're looking for is "Except", not "Accept"
---
yeah so  people can create an amount of cynos on day 1 without even having the bpo…
---
Magic wand = 45 myrms named zxfgyhw, uyfdjjwe etc running sites 23/7

It’s like.. please consult this excel sheet and tell me if 200 people start shooting you!
---
But still extremely frustrating when people just get lost.
---
Game was way more hardcore and popular at the same time. I personally want it to be that again. I don't give a shit about how much CCP earns and i believe they don't need our advice on the matter. More people in nullsec is good for sure, but the quality of null content was very dull despite pretty epic numbers.
---
The chaos era is definately a step in a right direction. We can already see isk getting it's value back and some smaller groups moving to null. Game was and will be engaging for a long time because of player created narrative, it has nothing to do with local chat or how fast vagabond is or how to cyno.
---
It's unclear to me how you can call for removal of concord and cry about chaos era at the same time, terrible idea overall. Safety in numbers is probobly is even worse than concord. The more people involved in activity the less impact any individual brings to the table. No surprise all the "empire builders" get bored before they even think about starting their own corp...
---
NP Tapi will be batphoning goons for the next timer in the south soon (tm)
---
Nah.. that’s stupid. Thousands of years in the future and our fighters can shot at frigates?
---
I like Ron. He's a nice guy, but he's not very bright.
---
Is there a tut on pulling out clothing files? Or is this the same process as ship models?
---
Devs are busy with the mobile game and that undisclosed mmo ccp is working on so there's no one left to make balance changes
---
TDSIN(The Dark Space Initiative) whilst massive has great newbie program as long as you can Scan and fly any kind of DPS 
---
Just be willing to learn
---
FWIW some alliances run buybacks as well as corporations. They will vary in how wide-ranging they are in what they accept as well.
---
I suspect they are mostly not open to outsiders. 
---
I know of 2 buybacks within my own alliance.
---
Then how do you explain all the people who can't do what you say is so simple?
---
This guy eves
---
Because elements of the core game mechanics were poorly designed. In EVE we have multiple sizes of module being able to be fitted across multiple types/classes/sizes of ship. So when you attempt to balance across modules, you have to do so across multiple dimensions. If they'd used a single size of module for reps/weapons and used hp, dps, rep amount etc to balance on ships, they'd have made things a lot easier for themselves. Try it: get a gang of mixed ships together and just fit small reps/weapons - battleships suddenly gain the longevity they should have and frigates/cruisers need to use speed and attack them in waves to limit time under fire...
---
Like half the shit you said is wrong. Broadcast after you take damage? Close overview? You get targets from watchlist?
---
Have you ever been in a fleet? Lol.
---
they don't lie because they don't talk.
---
You are lying by implying they do talk.
---
&gt;Are you serious?
---
Yeah, I am
---
&gt;Distance to anchor  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;When you land you anchor, then forget about it.
---
Wrong. Anchor can use propmod without telling because comms are busy or have higher speed due to better skills.
---
&gt;Targets (especially important - and stressful - in spider-tanking fleets)  
---
&gt;Spider tanking is not very much used in todays meta. And when used it's mostly on drone ships
---
"Not very much" and "mostly" aren't really arguments.
---
&gt;Watchlist  
---
&gt;This is where you target from.
---
Ummm... and? Still have to watch it.
---
&gt;Overview for yellow or red squares  
---
&gt;Just close down the overview. You dont need to be looking at that.
---
Wrong. You really want to notice if all enemy DPS ships are targeting you, because that's when you want to warp off or broadcast for reps
---
&gt;Own shied, armor and hull  
---
&gt;You take damage you just broadcast. The only other thing you have to do while doing that is looking at watchlist and ctrl + click targets from there
---
Wrong. Broadcasting after starting taking damage often does not provide enough time for logis to react.
---
&gt;Capacitor  
---
&gt;a none factor as almost every doctrine is cap stable
---
Cap stable as long as the enemy isn't using energy neutralizing, that is.
---
&gt;Ammunition  
---
&gt;What about it? you forgot to bring ammo before you had to undock and think about anything on the above
---
Reloading it on time.
---
&gt;Batteries for boosters  
---
&gt;Same as ammunition. This should be done before you undock. And if you run out you'll not be alone and the FC probably already knows
---
Contrary to ammunition, not that many batteries can be carried, meaning that cap booster can't be just let to run continuously.
---
&gt;Drones state  
---
&gt;Making them assist is to hard?
---
No. Returning those that are taking damage to and/or launching new ones is.
---
&gt;Incoming buffs and debuffs icons (not sure what's the proper name for these) such as warp disruption or remote repair  
---
&gt;Again something you dont have to bother about unless the FC asks and is trying to disengage. At that point you dont have to think about any of the above either.
---
You don't have to bother checking whether you are receiving all remote repairs or capacitor boosters? Or that you are being neutred?  
---
What fleets are you flying with lol?
---
so much on this  !
---
That#s bollocks. It was PS3 only because it was produced in some collaboration with Sony.
---
Stop kiting then and brawl my NYX &gt;:(
---
Tether kills the station fights of old a lot more than the structure weapons do.
---
Code is one thing, basic principles of game design are another. Sure, they can't port the game itself... but they could have just re-released a carbon copy of it.
---
Eh, but at least if you do want to engage on the grid of a citadel you don’t have to worry about this large amount of dps you can’t force off.
---
It's definitely not all the trig ships, but the kiki is fucking ridiculous.
---
Hello Kitty Manticore skin when?
---
use a 500MN to align. Even a 50 000MN makes it to 21s align.
---
Make several groups of caps, each warping to a different distance to the target, to avoid bumps.
---
Teach your pilots how to follow a warp order.
---
Seriously, all the problems you describe are from your cap pilots being dumb.
---
What an odd name given there is another rip off called dual universe.
---
That is truly unfortunate. Chinese market dragging down the others because why have quality content when you can have more money?
---
please if you have nothing to say, just don't post.
---
Looking at your killboard I'd say you truly have. Time to go, no more r/eve.
---
CCP Doesn't understand easy.
---
People aren't asking for complete equilibrium of ships, and just because that's impossible doesn't mean they should completely abandon balance passes. You're attacking a (very obvious) strawman.
---
What are you even talking about, what kind of dumb question is that?
---
And it's 100% serious I assure you
---
&gt;Makes sense to me as if the trending ships shift over time
---
What is overpowered usually remains overpowered until it's nerfed. History has shown that players often cannot fix this.
---
&gt;it also incentivizes extra skill acquisition. Since acquiring skills can take a while, preferences shifting more gradually also makes sense.
---
Not with injectors. Allowing knowningly imbalanced ships to remain so for the purpose of making money is unethical.
---
Nah man
---
yeah, delete delve pls
---
Nope wasnt arranged. Another pilot and I wanted a quick roam before a CTA, saw a wormhole, and saw the Wyvern. Since Frat decided not to show, we asked our friends if they wanted content. BR shows the rest lol
---
Yes. The blackout was aimed at stopping bots. That's a fact brother. I'm sorry your players stopped logging in, but that doesn't change the fact what CCP intended to do. 
---
I look at it this way. If you're in null with a ton of players refusing to login and play now, perhaps you don't belong in null. Start recruiting again and get players that are willing to take that risk. Null is not meant to be safe and you have all the tools to help you defend yourself in your space if you choose so. 
---
Bottom line is that is in Eve you don't get to choose when you want to PvP. It's always a possibility. If your members understood that, they'd be online now. Perhaps it was just poor corp management, because my null corp hasn't changed one bit.
---
I'm pretty good with my 6:1 kdr, no help required. 
---
It's not like i play the game somehow specially or i hate blobs or something. I just see the game finally moving towards what i see as good.
---
It's also not obvious for me what are you worried about. Are you really scared that CCP will blow out and game dies?
---
Most people who play Eve don't touch a lick of that. Just anti-social autistic elitism and screeching.
---
You have never met goons clearly. It takes about 5-10 mins to form a fleet unless it’s a capital fleet. People are fucking lazy and just don’t want to hop in the defend home anymore. In that amount of time, that many bombers can kill what you see posted pretty easily. It’s stupid that frigates can punch out battleship DPS. They go so fast with such a small sig that fighters don’t apply at all and they just kill the dromis that would actually be helpful. The only response that can actually work are munnins or maybe a well piloted jackdaw fleet?
---
 Btw only a few FCs in the coalition are allowed to take munnins out while the majority of skirmish commanders have set approval lists they can use. So if none of those people are available, we just sit with our dicks in hand trying to get out.
---
A coffin
---
Hardly promotion when its a company trying to rip off EVE - just like another game we know that was debated here (cough Star citizen cough)
---
I like how they're getting rekted and you can still see mining drones on the asteroids.
---
Fuck priority dude, how hard is it to move some numbers around?
---
You want me to believe the entire balance team spent last MONTH(160 work hours) on coming up with the cyno restricitons?
---
Literally what are these people even doing all day?
---
They tried to say it was because of a racist spreadsheet and stuff. The reality is RiotRick has a stronger backbone than Shart Draggin and wouldn’t just bend over to goon rule.
---
Fair point. Lose a lot of votes when your coalition is mostly bots.
---
It was aimed at stopping bot farms and bringing back the risk to null sec. It's a huge success, if you don't listen to the few whining about it here. I always say those crying just cry the loudest. It's not really the majority opinion.
---
didnt know tapi was allowed in delve :bigthink:
---
Because devs don't play the game, they have no idea what changes various ships need.  
---
CCP have ALWAYS been terribly slow to rebalance ships and when they do it's cack-handed.
---
Counterpoint though - there will always be an "optimal" setup for a particular task, so "balance" is going to be a moving target.  When I started, the Proteus was THE wormhole hunter, a great heavy tackle/covert cyno ship, and nasty in null fleets with rails.  The Loki was hardly ever seen.  I'm not disagreeing with your point, but it's not simply black and white - there will always be a hull that falls out of favor no matter how finely tuned CCP does this.  We're all turbo nerds who love min/maxing after all.
---
You're not wrong, I'll give you that. Some of it is player experience, which will cost tens or maybe even 100s of billions to help offset. It can't all be done of the test server. Some alliances may be able and willing to foot that bill, frex Legacy seem willing to dreadbomb just for practice.
---
The bit about warping at ranges is irrelevant as the entire fleet will get pulled into a catch or drag bubble placed by the defenders, or they will need to warp to a ping first, except cap fleets are NOT maneuverable. 
---
Especially supercaps fleets specifically need to keep themselves bubbled at all times in order to prevent losses due to DCs.
---
The question is why dont you have sound on?
---
LOLWUT
---
Someone misses killing cyno ships
---
TESTs lawyers would like to remind you that the fleet doctrine is Gokus, not Stukas. Thank you.
---
So don't fight on a citadel?
---
Yes, it's a "random" inclination around the target based on speed and distance.
---
Why you can't contribute from hisec? Can you explain how pvp can be risk-free? What's the whole idea here?
---
Like you only want to play some one casual-afk way, but only if it's nullsec, which is safe and you're still poor, but you somehow "contribute" and you rather quit, than even think what to do next. Get the fuck out.
---
Not really. More like when you went to a different region and were harassing the locals you would sit on the undock trying to bait them into fighting. A lot like what happens in Syndicate with eve uni.
---
Yeah, reddit told me we're too busy sucking goons off to dunk on them. I feel lied to. :(
---
I enjoy playing generally and have the past 8 years; I’d rather not have CCP or retards on reddit fuck it up... btw no u get a life
---
The sad thing is, those are probably all alpha myrms.
---
Following the trend of PVE activity request: Denied.
---
I get what you're saying, but the videos don't exactly show that.
---
We always knew that legion/dust would be a more or less dumb sci fi shooter and the only interesting bit would be the in-universe integration.
---
It is worse than that, you know all those free SP events CCP has been doing? Botters probably rolled hundreds of accounts using account creation bots, then used the free SP to train myrms or other things. They have a stockpile by now I would think. They hardly miss a beat.
---
Most claim to have one, but it's either a total ripoff or nobody wants to be in charge...
---
Would be nice to have someone actually taking care of it so both sides benefit, players and corps.
---
The CCP strategy of not-iterating on balance passes and other development does more than just leave some ships/modules as broken-garbage or absurdly OP.
---
I think the real damage is caused with the implementations like we're seeing right now with changes to cynos.
---
An intelligent approach to curbing cynos/capitals would have been to slowly reduce the number of ships that can use cynos (iterating every couple months), until the meta moved to a place that rewarded intelligent use by krabs/hunters/pvpers/jf logistics, while not completely swinging the meta with any given iteration.  Instead, CCP has gone to its usual strategy of over-the-top changes in order to accomplish its design goals.  Which, as past attempts have proven, just doesn't really work.
---
Because iterating properly takes effort.  The idiots in charge such as Hilmtard would rather piss away money on other projects while slapping bandaids on EVE.  It's clearly the guys in charge over there for the last few years at least are either clueless, gives 0 shits about the game, or both.
---
Don't be so bitter. 
---
They've done stuff like that before, like converting every carrier with a triage module fitted to a fax?
---
I've spotted 2 so far. I have a character in one of them already, it has access to the system. The CEO hauls all the buyback shit to Hiya every 2-3 days and makes profit. It's the corp's income source.
---
Well, if you are not arguing against the blackout i guess we agree.
---
Yes, it has become a lot harder and less profitable to use bots now. Yes, we will still see people try (and some may even succeed), but they will never be 100% safe unless they are in lowsec and above, in which case they will  profit will be decreased even further.
---
Gotta have room for all that sick 0.7 sec belt rat loot
---
&gt; the entire fleet will get pulled into a catch or drag bubble placed by the defenders
---
well your fault for warping to a drag bubble. Again, not a matter of balance but of players.
---
&gt; Especially supercaps fleets specifically need to keep themselves bubbled at all times in order to prevent losses due to DCs.
---
Again that is an issue with the players not the game. To be fair also an issue with the game servers. But that should not be taken into account for balancing purposes.
---
It wasn't OP in that it was "OMG BROKEN" but in that it was just way too good for its price.  It could project OK DPS to retarded distances and have a massive tank for practically nothing.
---
Hilmtard doesn't
---
Falcon is a mouthpiece that says whatever he thinks players want to hear at any particular time.
---
And CCP does not consider completely abandoning balance passes.
---
You're making a very obvious strawman.
---
Yes, very nice.
---
This is not that. This is obviously botting.
---
Thing is, forming subcaps doctrine takes time. Even more if you need links and such. Too contest full Goku/Stuka fleet you'll also need numbers, and to gain enough numbers, you'll need to send a ping. This things add up, taking precious time. And no, no one will gate subcaps to tackled super or Rorq. They'll be Titan bridged to the site, or to the beacon in system.
---
I still wonder what kind of subcap doctrine can hard counter gokus. Beamfesors? Jackdaws? I have seen Munnins being somehow effective, but I don't know if it was tested vs full fleet, or multiple fleets.
---
Brainstorming ideas on how to get everyone to leave null, and thinking up new  SKIN patterns.
---
Do you guys even have to dotlan index when you come to delve? 😂
---
This isn't an excuse.  They had plenty of staff over the last 10 years, they just fired bits and pieces of them after every failed project.  If this were a new issue, then you may have a point.
---
I didn't realize Templeman was back. Nice catch!
---
Not really. The whole place is Carebear Land
---
The game wasn't hacked, accounts were
---
And why should they? If every little t1 industrial could be used to jump around then there'd be no reason to have JFs
---
Actually the graph is more clear and impressive if you just show the last one year numbers.   
---
The trend started well before ‘blackout’ and only started to pick up speed after.
---
I’ll take “Vines that will never die” for $200, Alex.
---
If you had live a bit in null-sec which is obviously not the case, you wouldn't ask this questions.
---
Simply farming/mining permit to supply local null-sec production and rise the ADMs for any incoming defensive situation. Mining in New Caldari don't help for both.
---
PVP can be risk-free if the risk of the hunter to be seen is low, and if he don't have to fear any decent retribution for his attempt of killing someone. The supercap umbrella was a bit too much I admit, but it was a counter-measure against any offender.
---
Fact is, the PVP players who criticized the risk-adverse krabs of null-sec, has become the new risk-adverse population of the game as the situation for them have greatly improved with the Blackout and the incoming cynonerf.
---
So well, at least stop acting like an elite player. You have become the new krab, weakling.
---
while i agree that more fights would happen, i'm just not sure i'm a fan of station games
---
Just adding the words “chaos era” to something does not actually make it chaotic. Or a good idea.
---
It would definitely make things chaotic because you couldn’t simply just stay on the grid of a fort and have that backing you up. Or cyno beacon and jump bridges being defended by a fort or keep star. 
---
Wether it’s a good idea, I don’t know honestly. Why I put it out to a public forum for discussion. So feel free to tell me why you think it’s a bad idea. (:
---
This is just part of chaos that’s all.
---
But that’s eve. There’s a different cup of tea for everyone. I’m not saying take away tethering. But, I think that citadels are too oppressive in their current state.
---
You don't give a shit about what CCP earns?  You sure?  Because it will be hard to keep the servers running if they can't pay the power bill.  When the game no longer makes a profit, it dies for real.  Want to know what a good measuring stick is for the game health?  Skins.  Check hoboleaks and see how many new skins are coming compared to game mechanic changes.
---
Isk could get value back in a lot of ways; we don't need a blackout for that.  And, as supplies dwindle and more and more miners and industrialists refuse to be prey with no way to defend themselves, prices will adjust to negate the changes to isk value.  Look beyond the range of your blasters and think about the game as a whole.
---
In 3 sentences, you went from "quality of null content was very dull" to "Game was and will be engaging for a long time."  So you even know what point you are trying to discuss?  It wasn't engaging.  Very few people were happy with the state of the game.  But this is worse.  Anyone who says otherwise either has nothing to do with nullsec and is just making assumptions or are just trolling.  
---
Smaller groups moving to null are filling the vacuum created by Imperium burning PanFam space before the chaos.  And, they aren't doing well.  Smaller, independent entities are being crushed.  The donut is bluer than ever.  
---
I never called for the removal of Concord.  What I said was that it would have been a smarter move than nerfing nullsec for easy hunting; that driving players *into* nullsec would have been healthier for the game than driving players away from the game entirely.  And that is just the idea of a dude sitting in his jammies still working on his first cup of coffee.  A professional game development staff should be able to do a lot better. 
---
And I don't even know what those last three sentences even mean.  I award you no points, and may Bob have mercy on your soul.
---
And, yes, I do see the chaos as CCP nerfing nullsec to make it easy for weak ass hunters who couldn't adapt to fight in nullsec.  Before this, killboards were full of kills in nullsec every day, but certain groups just cried and cried.  "Carriers are too hard to tackle."  "Fighters too stronk."  "HAW Titans are bullshit."  "Perfect intel touched me in a bad way."  So, CCP made it easy for them so they could come to nullsec and finally be able to get kills without the sov owner being able to effectively defend their space.  Except that now, all their prey is leaving the game and smiling as they watch it die.  Those who remain are turtling up with max Tenebrex jammers  or super ratting and Rorq mining under their umbrella.  CCP has created an environment where the only advantage to having sov is that you get to dock up.  There is no reason, no benefit for anyone to take anyone else's space.  "Player driven content" for nullsec is more than going on a frig and dessie roam.  But yeah, this guy on reddit thinks that the chaos era is a step in the right direction, so hit us again CCP and this time put some stank on it.
---
Could it be that these side failures has protected EVE Online because Hilmar was looking at other things and other devs to threaten and screw over? 
---
Now that EVERYTHING has failed — nothing is left — he is now here to kill EVE with sincere hopes he is the Savior.
---
DELETE WORMHOLE SPACE AND HIGHSEC
---
They need to hire someone that's actually good at number crunching then, because in 99% of cases the average player points out the flaws in every one of their proposed changes the second it's on Sisi.  And they're right almost every time; at best CCP has to change a ton of shit with player feedback before it goes live, but more often than not they do their "we have blah blah data saying you're wrong", release it, it fucks up exactly as predicted, and isn't touched for 2 years.
---
Yeah dude, just stop. 
---
The moment I made a list of all things I could have done with 15+ hours a week was the moment I quit. 
---
You could literally develop a new career skill set in 6months with your eve play time.
---
You can solo sites C5 sites in cloaky ship? Which one?
---
As it should be, otherwise you get committee decisions. You need one person in charge of pulling the trigger and handing out tasking to devs. Ideally, this person has a grand vision that coincides with other high level decision makers. 
---
The complexity of Eve and the cumulative nature of it's universe present unique challenges, but the fundamentals of analysis are the same. Look for mountains and molehills and even them out so that every blade of grass has the potential to grow to an even height. Excuse the analogy for 'even playing field.'
---
The game has been protected from Hilmar because of side projects. Now we face a time when his sole focus is on it similar to these other failures. By trying to become the Savior of the Sandbox, he has outright killed 20%+ of the playerbase.
---
Yes, but it is done strictly for the purpose of pulling Concord off a gate or other location to allow for the maximum amount of time to gank. Technically it's not supposed to be allowed, but I think CCP realize that this is one of those cases where it would be too time consuming to bother with.
---
The bare minimum, to raise some funds to blow on another game that relies on the eve intellectual property that will fail.
---
Unspoken alliance? Please heed your creed and unspeak more
---
It's supposed to be, but CCP realize it would be way too time consuming to deal with. Just about every ganker out there pulls Concord to give them the maximum time to gank.
---
They screwed up the factions, that video shows the Amarr and Caldari facing off against each other.
---
true!  V0lta is trash!
---
Why are we fighting when our only event should be CCP and their shitty blackout
---
Number of staff currently working there.
---
I think that's a great idea, although now on top of station games, you have tether games.
---
Please dont act like this is a comparable situation to the ratting nyx thing that was going on for ages. Also... why dont you just go kill them with a bomber or two?
---
Oppressive from the attacking side, for sure. 
---
With previous mechanics, you had more of chance of insta licking and such, which spawned undock/dock bookmarks. It sure made camping a lot easier.
---
I guess my point is if a dude wants a 'time out' or whatever, there shouldn't be an additional 'paperwork' step to doing so (eg bookmarks for every station). Maybe if we messed with tethering timers instead?
---
Does anyone honestly think this is healthy? It’s as healthy as side projects that CCP Hilmar worked on. Now that EVERYTHING has failed, his focus is now on EVE, and that spirit of failure is here.
---
Null-sec is not safe, we made it safer.
---
You don't understand human nature and his history. When humans find a new location with interesting ressources, they won't just go here sometimes to get some valuables and go back home. No, they will spend effort to domesticate the area, make it safer so that it is possible to maximize the exploitation of said ressources, in short they will civilize it.
---
What happened in null-sec isn't different of what happened in the USA in the last centuries, if you need an exemple.
---
So this measure wasn't meant for bots, it only targetted the unhabitants because they DARE made it safer by their collaborative effort. Despite the fact that CCP did help building this situation by making capital ships easier to access, by creating the actual sovereignty system who contributed to slow down any territorial disputes and so creating political stagnation, etc. and by no seeing it coming.
---
In short, the target is wrong. CCP punish players for playing the game THEY defined. And of course many didn't like it and rather stop log in than accept it. So yes, we will recruit and there will be massive restructurations and concentrations of corporations in the next weeks.
---
And the bots who mine belts in high-sec are fine. I was afraid for them.
---
I expect a TOTAL political stagnation in the few next months, the blue donut will finally be a reality. And so well, coalitions will be hurt but will remain. Less players overall, so less targets to shoot, market screwing up, etc.
---
Balancing a massive multiplayer game is apparently really simple and CCP is just lazy.     
---
Lol have you played any other mmo ever? Even ones far less complex?     
---
Game has problems but anyone saying balancing is easy is just retarded.
---
He was but he wasn't... obviously hes trying to imply that "the bots simply adapted" which is only half true since an alpha clone myrm wont be even close to the ticks one of those botting nyxes used to get AND its actually very catchable.
---
Well tethering mechanics would still be in play. Like I said I’m a different comment it’s more about not having to deal with a large amount of dps that can’t be forced off, dealt with, or really mitigated on a smaller scale. 
---
I agree insta locking stuff on station is super annoying and not fun to deal with so I wouldn’t want to get rid of tethering.
---
Yeah so the logistics of the game doesn’t grind to a halt because no one has the module.
---
Sadly the nomen is no longer king of elite dvd bluray :(
---
I miss those days...
---
Any carrier fit with triage was changed to a fax, you aren’t wrong.
---
Blackout was a mistake right bro?
---
Cause some alpha clone myrmidons that you can kill with minimal prepp are the same as uncatchable nyxes? I dont get the people that complain about it at all...
---
Yeah, let's give a unfair advantage to people "for reasons".
---
The correct fix would be to release the bpos and the modules BEFORE the patch prevents fitting the old one. Funny that you don't ask for it and instead rely on getting an unfair advantage from CCP…
---
You mean like the people who leave blue space to pretend they PvP by shooting Excavs? Power to you if that's what you want to do but you don't get to act all high and mighty over it.
---
Random allegations are just random allegations.
---
Sounds exhausting
---
That sounds like a social issue more than a gameplay problem that needs solving. Caps not applying sounds like working as intended. 600 dps is barely battleship class, well within the realm of HAC/BC. People being too lazy to defend home sounds like you should trim those people, if they’re not prepared to contribute, or refuse to defend them.
---
I have met goons the odd time or ten, now that you mention it... your classic response force provides content for no one. There are solutions to these issues, but not if you’re unwilling to look for them.
---
I hope you see the irony of an easy mode doctrine requiring an effortmode form to counter for the sake of crabs that make about the same isk/hour as running abyssals in highsec.
---
I'm guessing someone got slapped by a citadel. Show us the kill mail.
---
Oh miner you always make my day. I generally stay away from citadels cause they are death.
---
I don't, I was AFK at the time. What was it supposed to do?
---
Only if you use proper English. :\*
---
No one said it will stay permanent. It has been 2 months, that is a pretty short time for a 15 year old game and obviously ccp wants to properly collect data on the impact of blackout. That doesn't work if you just take the first week of hype, things need to settle, people need to adapt before you can properly see if it works or not.
---
Defenders would just need to shoot the structure once to activate its weapons.
---
It's probably vacation season and the whole balancing team is off for a while. This is very common in other countries that aren't America. - /r/Eve explaining CCP to me.
---
Hey r/Eve nerds!
---
On stream I talk about PP a bunch (HAH!) and people watching say they don’t do it because they’re not sure how to set it up, or think it’s too much work or not worth it. So I made this video to show a basic setup of an extraction planet! As I say in the video, it’s not the 100% efficient/optimal setup, however it’s the setup that I use on all of my toons and it works for the way I do things. 
---
Hopefully some of you find this useful! I know it’s ballsy putting something on Reddit but if it can help one person out then it’s worth it. Planetary production is a really good way to generate ISK passively, and once you setup it requires little effort to maintain and do the routine work. If you have any feedback or suggestions let me know!
---
yes, contract me your 10/20 bpos and I will purchase them at the price of the NPC SO.
---
Seriously.
---
Yeah, my writing is especially terrible today, sorry for that. Just forget it and go back to crying.
---
Did you see the fall off of human activity and rise of high sec bots?  Check August MER high sec botting substantial increases and human activity fall off through the roof in zkb.
---
Lolol "Mom get the camera"
---
&gt;Now, for why it is hard. Companies like CCP actually consist of human beings. Those have their own agendas and motivations. Working on a big change and implementing it is interesting for a dev. Following it up isn't really that sexy. It also means that a person admits an error. As we all know humans love to admit to their own faults. Good management is the key to compensate for that. Some manager would need to put into his calendar "two months after change ask in meeting what it effect was and if it needs change" same for four months again. And no this isn't the CEO's but it's the CEO's job to make sure his guys do that.
---
While this maybe a contributing factor it does seem that CCP suffers more from it than average in the industry.
---
The impression I get is that there is a curtain arrogance and dillusion going on. This whole smart academic tough guy image. They think they're not making an mmo video game for turbonerds but 'changing the world'. I think a recent example are Hilmar's latest appearances where he talks about 'eve has been solved'.  I'm not sure he actually believes this bullshit or he's just being the CEO, or both, but this kind of pretentiousness illustrates it. Nothing is 'solved', there's just CCP incompetence and complacency.
---
Yeah obviously it needs more detail than I have put in. You’d have to probably apply enough dps to pause repairing or something similar. So if they do that then they are at least risking something.
---
EXACTLY! The only people who even remotely get any of those skills mentioned are either in Alliance leadership or FCs which comprise a whole 1% of EvE population... literally like any other fucking game out there that requires any sort of guild/group/party management...
---
Yeah. Good thing these aren't random and they're supported by reasonably reliable evidence providing probable cause.
---
It's an alpha. This is the wrong subreddit. Everyone in EveEchoes is under nda so they can't help you really. Try the official discord
---
They are random.
---
You seem like a proper plant pot
---
I run a buyback for my friends high sec corp. I pay you shit and then flip it on the market for a profit and split the profit with my friends
---
For fucks sake, no one is saying balancing is 'easy'. OP is saying that they should at least ATTEMPT it. 
---
There are no balancing changes at the moment. None. Didn't CCP say they switched to the more frequent release schedule for this express purpose?
---
That, or maybe they really didn't want defenceless prey.
---
I've seen real salt about the fact that the cloak trick is a thing though.
---
Your mom's a strawman.
---
Hong Kong numba 1
---
Also the gaggle of active tanked FAXs that melt when targeted by 150 bombers.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78828919/
---
55k active heated reps against what is close to 100k incoming damage. Any hostile fleet that can threaten a super is going to instantly pop active FAXs.
---
You're overstating your case.
---
I started playing 6 years ago. There've been at least three pretty major balance passes since then.
---
Also what a lot of other people are saying: it's not as easy as you seem to think.
---
Yet people are able to undock a super. Bring subcaps and win easy
---
Ok. Let's make it so every ship just a RNG and if it's more than X number the ship explodes. Yout can't know when it will explode so it's chaos. And chaos is good.
---
Wow, amazing, a major balance pass every **two years**
---
Are you saying this is something for them to be proud of?
---
Only a few people being allowed to call for an actual response fleet is a self imposed problem not a game mechanic.
---
That's the thing though most gate camps are terrible.
---
Exporting T1's like you are going is really expensive and bulky. Unless you have a specific reason you need T1s you should be processing into a T2 via an advanced industry before exporting.
---
You don't know anything about what it's like to work on a big old computer program, do you.
---
Sounds like you just need to PLEX up, homey. Don't worry, paying for a game you're really enjoying playing isn't so bad and will help CCP bring about more CHAOS CHANGES. Isn't that what we all want?
---
Yeah, it all depends on where you are and your taxes! In null sec with richer resource densities it’s easier to extract T0 and produce up to T2 and export that, but in high/low sec where resources on planets are a bit more scarce it’s harder to get a smooth flow of T0-&gt;T2 on a single planet. 
---
I didn’t go over this at all in the video but taxes are a big part of this and is something to consider - because it adds up!
---
They did this with capitals and there was no problem. How is being prepared and unfair advantage?
---
Naw, but once I got away from it due to skin problems eating it makes me feel like garbage.
---
If you look at a garbage man "from a certain perspective" he's the savior of the world, but you don't...
---
Hahahaha
---
I do, actually, but more importantly, why should that matter? They're clearly capable of making changes to the game; there's lots of UI changes and graphics updates, far more than balance passes.
---
The willingness of people to make excuses for CCP's obvious incompetence still amazes me after 13 years of playing this game...
---
stop bitching. This won't lead nowhere but to you fooling yourself even more.
---
You're
---
bruh I revisited this video for the first time in like 3 years yesterday just out of nowhere for the hell of it, and today its here. Getting a feeling of Baader-Meinhof phenom here
---
I do have two Omega accounts. But the Spree put Alpha accounts into unequal positions which rubs me the wrong way. As for Chaos I like the blackout personally, but who knows about any future chaotic stuff and it is good or bad.
---
&gt; harder to get a smooth flow of T0-&gt;T2 on a single planet.
---
I don't find this to be the case as you only need 6000/hour, and with only 4 non extractor buildings on planet, you can have a lot of extractor heads.
---
17,000 MW from level 4 CC - 5200 for Extractor x2 - 1600 for basic x2 - 700 for advanced x1 - 700 for spaceport (low volume enough to not need a dedicated storage) = 14-15 extractor heads depending on planet size for links.
---
The irony of people who've spent the past 2 years jumping a few supercap alts onto everything complaining about easy mode doctrines.
---
that be one thicc strawwo-man
---
I am not sure why any other company would want to rip off eve. It's not massivlely popular when you compare it to other mmo's
---
what happened over there
---
As a solo null roamer, this would make getting fights a lot easier +1
---
Algos used to be a lot better. T1 destroyers don't do very well in the assault frigate meta though
---
Looks like someone tryed to evac from a wormhole with all his stuff... he failed.
---
Cyno changes must have been a 2 minute brain fart, noted on a napkin during lunchtime
---
I don’t even fly a JF? Are you ok? You seem really upset about nothing and won’t even answer the question.
---
i came to the conclusion a few years ago, eve / gaming / mmorpg  must be considered (at least by me) as low forms of entertainment)   dont invest emotionally or financially unless that time or money is disposable,    yes this internet gaming fan club can make friends, and its sometimes good fun, dont confuse it.    
---
Generally speaking.
---
I don't think it would be that bad, but it would certainly help with the transition.
---
I never thought about that - I’m going to try it out! So it’d be 2 extractor nodes, 1 basic, 1 advanced, and the storage/launchpad? Or do you not even use the storage facility?
---
This seems like a hard task when you are rebalancing tons of ships, but if you did one or two a month? CCP has numbers, rebalance the lowest used ship and the highest used ship every month. Don't try to make it a top or bottom tier ship, just adjust them numbers a bit. Giving something a little more speed or a missing 2-3 powergrid isn't going to cause it to run away with the game.
---
But muh chaos era
---
Explain?
---
Botters gonna bot; Blackout just forces them to change. 
---
I see this as an invasions oriented change also.. since a Myrm can tank many of the invasion's gate camp NPC groups
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Nah
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/071/746/57f.png
---
So you wanted planetside 2 but you're getting battlefield in space?
---
Yea it would have been worse a few years ago before citadels.
---
Of course we are. We are just usually too busy fighting of Pandafam Empire.
---
Whats that make, 30 mil isk an hour?
---
Nice. 👌
---
or he  was involved in looting fallen citadel and someone caught him
---
No.
---
The volume is not high enough to justify the storage facility, but if you want you can certainly add one and just run 13-14 extractor heads.
---
you think bot coders are stupid? They randomize the activities.
---
Lots of variables are in play, for sure. But when a ship is broken one way or the other, there's usually some big clues about why, and even if there isn't one thing standing out, the number of things that can be tweaked should make it EASY to tone stuff down a bit.
---
Like, the Kiki. Long range, good tracking, high damage, high speed. It's blatantly overpowered. There's a lot of variables involved. But you don't have to have a grand unified theory of eve ship balance to be able to figure out how to tone it down a little. And if 3 months from now it's still an issue, you go further (or backpedal if needed). That's the whole point of iteration as frequent, small checkups.
---
&gt;You want me to believe the entire balance team spent last MONTH(160 work hours each) on coming up with the cyno restricitons?
---
Probably took 10 minutes once they decided on it, then they did fuck all for the rest of the month.
---
Thats not how the calculation works. You are not taking into account resists etc. Also https://zkillboard.com/kill/78828939/ my fax that died in that fight. Almost 2 mil damage, 190 ships on the lossmail. I would have tanked longer but I was doing several things acoss multiple clients and did not notice that there were no cap booster charges left in the cargo. So the cap booster didn't reload and I capped out. The 12 seconds it took for me to move the cap booster charges from the fleet hanger to the cap booster and the cap booster itself reloading, cost me the ship
---
&gt; balance team
---
lol
---
What advantage? We are not talking converting a module into a much more expensive one, they cost the same to make which is less than 1m Isk.
---
Converting it would be inline with how CCP had done similar changes in the past (all carriers with triage mod fitted got turned into fax and how they converted subsystems in the big t3c changes for example).
---
yes you are asking exactly this.
---
lmao, test batphoned pretty hard goonies last week, you better remember your pet status or the batphone may stop working
---
Pretty much. Im not grrr goons at all about this.  They found a method that was very effective and invested heavily into implementing it.
---
Theres been so much focus from the rest of the player base and now ccp's bad attempts at attack ing that playstyle but few seem to be looking at the underlying factors that invalidated the other methods.
---
No
---
Fit 2x nanofiber internal structure and 2x warp core stabilisers in the lows. Take an extra 8 scanner probes. Don't run data sites, your time is better spent looking for relic sites, so scrap the data analyser and take 2 scan range finding arrays. Take 5 EC-300 drones instead of 5 of those hobgoblins. Rest seems good
---
People in subs don't attend home defense fleets because almost everytime they get called, when they finally land on grid everything died or warped off just a minute before. So it's not worth if you're not in a cap.
---
Thanks for clearing that up and proving you have nothing logical or relevant to say.

---
Munnins are expensive, they don’t want to hand out expensive doctrine keys to people who will just feed them like candy, which is reasonable. Maybe a jackdaw fleet could handle the stukas but I’m not sure, haven’t been able to try it myself. 
---
Also the whole “not applying/working as intended” pops everyone’s thought bubble on “supers are op they do everything with no counter” if attackers brought these fleets sooner, then we would have to regularly form subcaps to defend. Now that people are, we will have to catch up. Someday the rest of the alliance will wake up
---
Eve taught me the spreadsheet skills which got me my current job. It also taught my wife how to recognize a scam. Those two facts alone have made it worth it, nevermind that I usually had fun along the way.

---
What a nice post sir. Thank you.
---
tfw you get AFK instead of go AFK
---
Maybe afterburning frigates should not deal short range battleship DPS from 60 km. A hound shooting CN nova does about the same damage as an Apocalypse at 60.
---
Nobody is trying to "be content" while farming up money, because that invites people to put you on farm and then you make no money from the constant disruptions.
---
You get your moneymaking done then reship into combat ships to fight people.

Dude.. you and PL were at Frat's timer last night. *lol* https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/fThrS7BxJoMLjh8yY

There's a pretty big difference in the self rep ability of a lif and an apostle.
---
&gt; You have never met goons clearly. It takes about 5-10 mins to form a fleet unless it’s a capital fleet
---
git gud or eat shit? seriously what kind of argument are you even pushing here? 
---
&gt; People are fucking lazy and just don’t want to hop in the defend home anymore.
---
yeah, you recruited all those smoothbrains and jerked yourselves off over how catering to krabs and lazy bottom feeders made you win the game. 
---
&gt; So if none of those people are available, we just sit with our dicks in hand trying to get out.
---
sounds like you should have recruited some competent PvPers and offered them an environment where they could thrive.
---
I'm sorry but if you expect this game to be balanced, I
---
Bots disappeared due to economic pressure too. it’s not profitable to keep hardware + omega + electricity when income is significantly diminished. RMT is close to unprofitable atm.
---
I see nothing has changed since I left in 2011
---
Yes let me try to fight 30  rorquals with my 9 man roaming gang.
---
How about i just grief your excavators instead
---
I’m more just bitching about the whole situation. People say super caps are op blah blah blah but frigates and destroyers can render a 30+ super group useless with ease. And yet everyone wants to nerf them into the ground because attackers were too retarded to just bring real fleets to fight us. It is on us now to learn but with the game dying so fast, I’m worried that no one will take the problem seriously till it’s too late
---
Reeeeee, I regret going on a trip this morning, missed a dank frag :(
---
I'm sorry but if you expect this game to be balanced ever, I'm not sure what games you have been playing with this many options for vessels or characters to play? Has any game somewhat like this been balanced ever? I can't think of one, new ships being made the best just allows things to be different and that is all balance is. People adjust and change, and overcome, or just go with it. At some point its changed and the cycle continues. Balance however I just don't see it ever.
---
Not op but lots of replies seem to think it's super easy.
---
Why does everyone assume "balance" means "every ship is used in perfect equilibrium"? You're railing against a position that literally no one holds.
---
Once I figure out how to back everything up I'll try that. Thanks!
---
Because there's literally one dude doing it.
---
What we are seeing is actually an exasperated effect of the low game population. Due to the one server concept and the much smaller community, opinions circulate much quicker through the population. Due to *that*, people on Eve have gotten used to having their opinions heard. The fact that everyone has an opinion is not a unique concept to Eve players, but you opinions individually resonate better in a smaller community that is as tight knit as this one. Basically, we all aren't as great as we pretend to be.
---
then your arguing for the wrong thing, if you want the meta changed, asked for that....
---
He's got a pretty sweet job then, getting paid to do nothing all day
---
My biggest regret is that i didn't start playing Eve sooner. I've had and am still having, an amzing time and have met some great people. 
---
Maybe just stay off r/eve, this place can be too negative.
---
 Besides all the balance changes that do happen, the new trig ships, and a bunch of other stuff.  Balance change is slow, not non-existent.
---
It takes an hour per cyno module, before engineering complex bonus or implants, to build an industrial cyno from an 0/0 print.  
---
So yeah, it's gonna suck on the first days because there's gonna be a big window where you really can't go anywhere unless you use recon cynos for your JFs. 
---
I prep'ed minerals ahead of time to try to poop out a bunch of cynos in 5-6 hours for myself, spread across 10 build slots on a handful of chars, but that's not going to last long enough for me to put any ME/PE research onto the blueprints and still build more cynos from them.
---
Great video!
---
stronger weapons = more expensive and rarer.
---
right now. we got Tech 2, which is same price as some tier 4 tech 1.
---
and faction modules, which are weaker than tech 2 despite being 25x to 100x or mroe the cost.
---
unless you look at missile launchers, which do more due to rof.     or resistance/repairs which do more.
---
but outside of those, the rest of modules are a mess.
---
TDSIN, POSPY, WHSOC, are a few newbie friendly corps to get your feet wet.
---
~500 dps isn't close range battleship DPS, close range battleships can deal triple that.
---
Yeah I do think people are missing that point, the lack of afk vnis isn't exactly hurting the amount of content.
---
You don't see these post often enough among the myriad of "is this game worth playing", "new player, played for 20 minutes so far, why are people complaining about this game".
---
THIS IS EVE, it's a fucking waste of time... no, there's no "and that's why we love it" at the end... it's just that, shit...
---
Yeah well CCP seems addicted to putting everything worth fighting over inside or right next to citadels.
---
Which is a very good thing
---
Oof be careful sort might kick you
---
Thank fuck
---
Comment was directed at your general attitude towards life and other people.
---
Rick is a good dude, never had a problem with him, good guy. Now sort... He can fuck a running chainsaw
---
Supers are overpowered, just because a single very specifically built comp can fight them (and pretty much nothing else) doesn't make them fine. Try fighting supers in a caracal fleet, or ruptures, or feroxes, or hurricanes, or T1 battleships, or oracles, or literally anything that isn't a 100+ bomber fleet.
---
Try roaming around an area with strong super umbrellas in fun comps / small gangs and tell me how it goes. Svipuls also used to die to a 100 man bomber fleet but literally nobody with a brain would try to defend them as balanced ships.
---
Sounds your manufacturer is greedy and disabled it in order to sell their own upgraded models with more internal storage.
---
'Always' use meta MWD's. T2 MWD eats you capacitor and fitting, especially on a frigate. The Quad-Lif has less cap penalty, the cold-gas has less cap per cycle, compact saves fitting.  
---
Have you considered killing other explorers and taking their loot? Drop the data module, fit cap booster and and a scram. You can also a carry a mobile depot and go full pvp, AB dual scram, cap booster. Change the trimark for a repair rig

[You can't scare me with this!](https://youtu.be/K3CTdTtT4ng)

Also a good bet!

Holy fucking shit. That's so accurate

Ill pm you on discord.

Do I know you, or do is there any particular reason you feel compelled to comment on my general attitude toward life and other people based on a single fucking comment thread involving me and one other person?
---
lmao I'm using the same terminology as CCP, take it up with them, genius
---
Alphas can train until you reach 5 mil SP.
---
I don't see how it would make any sense for unallocated SP to not count towards the total.
---
Make meta modules useful. It was and still is for those modules not done that meta I was crap, then they got better stats all the way up to T2. So you only ever used the highest meta module you could. They started revamping modules so they would all have one stat better than the rest but lose out on other stats. An example would be a prop mod that uses less cap per cycle but would have a lower top speed and higher fitting requirement. The idea was to make them all useful because you’d have to sacrifice something to get another advantage. Balancing those stats took a while as you had to balance them for all the ships they could be put on but it made all the metas actually useful. They rolled these out in groups of modules with the changes applied each patch and then one day they stopped. Development time went to other projects and the tieracide has been in limbo ever since.
---
Eagles actually do over 400 dps @ 60km, and of course have the advantage of being able to shoot way past bomber range, and can apply better and instantly.
---
This post is correct. It was made worse by the hel warping off to another grid.

Fair enough on keys to muninns but feroxes are cheap as chips. It’s a shame caps have been so potent for so long, because for most of the game it’s been much less flat as to what ships are best such that you could specialise and be valuable solo/gang/fleet in any hull size. It’s left a lot of people misunderstanding how hulls are supposed to fit together.
---
In fairness we were out of ammo.
---
If pilots flew their ships perfectly the ships would still all stack on top of each other and cause massive bumping once the fleet comes out of warp. This is a bug and not an issue of player skill.
---
Warping is a no go.
---
If you don't have anyone who knows how to FC reasonable defense fleets then maybe it's a you problem and not a game problem?
---
because there's more important "trying to save the game" issues to work on
---
October 12, when PA boots Hilmar, for causing 1/3 of the players to quit.
---
Dual universe is a fundamentally different game.
---
Thank you very much for your perspective of the fight!
---
It is well known that Tuskers have their humour glands removed as part of their elite AT training regime.
---
This was a fun scrap. Goons do it to us. We do it to them. Everyone fucks pl
---
You know what fixes Bots in Eve? Turning the server off. No Eve, no Eve bots. CCPlease
---
Which one? a Vindicator in void range with all drones out that's also in capital neut range and scram+web range?
---
But the complaint is caps don’t work. Seems to me like the process to get subs onto grid is what groups need to work on.
---
But the whole idea was that these changes weren't even targeted at industrials or this side of cyno-field gameplay, why make this other group of players jump through hoops when the end goal was to hamper super-cap mobility?
---
You don't think keeping a fresh metagame is important to saving the game?
---
Not surprising, this is the cheapest Realme C2 available. ADB it is then.
---
No, I don't believe it's "more important" than trying to correct some bigger issues.  
---
But, that's cool, we all have our opinions.
---
Yes that's a close ranged battleship. Even a close ranged megathron deals double that of a bomber.
---
Close range battleships exist almost solely on the small gang spectrum; A fleet battleship can be expected to do roughly 500 dps at range, all things considered.
---
That solves nothing. Most minmatar are op compared to other racials. Pick another battlecruiser comparable to a Tornado.. yeah, all others suck. And this is just an example.
---
The races are for the most part only cosmetic at this point. Though caldari has a neet death clone location, you can always death clone to the system near Jiti and fly back to your real home system and reset your death clone with no waiting a year.
---
For hauling you do not need a 4th account, using a miasmos at the same time has having your mining ship out on the field is not cost-effective till 5+ accounts. So just do the hauling after your done for the day.
---
Also, do speck to your corp this advice may not be that great if your corp is set up diffrently to mine.
---
Then why are *you* bringing up `close range battleship damage`?
---
You'll have to spent extra effort to find out what site they were running with dscan and go report the wrecks owners
---
&gt; 400 dps @ 60km
---
How many mids are you using for tracking computers? Eagles take quite a bit more damage than bombers and need a heftier tank.
---
One mid, which is fairly standard from Eagle fits.
---
That sounds like a all win situation
---
Then that means you probably have their name on a kill mail. That's the seed you need for this report.
---
"Lemme just warp somewhere random make me harder to find"  
---
\-Warps to sun at 100 :D  
---
Also Planetology and Advanced Planetolagy is worth getting to 4. It makes your scans of planets much more accurate i.t.o resource location; your extraction amount wont go to shit within in a day
---
only if they all warp to the same target and same distance.
---
I mean the whoring on kills is just to stay in corp/in all the groups that require them.
---
I did other things when I was actually playing the game, like logi.
---
Yea obviously after the first couple days it will be fine, it is just hard if you are expecting a shipment or need to move fuel or something. I know how hard logistics people work and it is pretty shitty.
---
Kestrel and everything the same size as you and some cruisers.
---
That was beyond fucking awesome!
---
Thanks. Very good points. Well there is only me and my mate in our corp so I guess we can split and one will train a trader or refiner and the other industrial or something.
---
I told you : the fix is to release the modules before the  cynos can't be fit, not to transform existing modules.
---
There's now a "report bot" in the hamburger menu in the show player info screen.
---
Maybe next time add this info to your post? Seems relevant to what you were trying to convey. Take care.
---
Because at the end of the day we're just playing a fucking video game for fun?
---
Do you peg people often?
---
orthrus did nothing wrong.
---
report bot on myrmidons that are docked up before you can show info?
---
If you're not sure of the player but have information, emailing is a good option.
---
Start of the line with this vni as i attempt to take it through all tiers of the abyss! Will it make it?
---
Not where I saw this going. Mostly because your not a new player I guess.
---
There is a perceived problem (maybe miner but it's vexing) that the season of skills caused me as new. I'll try to explain it if anyone cares but it has contributed to me not logging in as often as I did.
---
You are moving the goal posts to ridiculous places. Good day.
---
this cyno change update is more than petty it is punishment from ccp for player complaining about the cyno changes and not being able to do cyno vigils
---
I am not. I am telling you that what people claim are issues arusing from the need to warp are actually issues created by the players.
---
I honestly miss the idea of jumping JF's to covert cynos. Yeah the change sucks but ninja logistics got so easy then.
---
&gt;Just saying that CCP prefers the wait and see method/over-analysis, while I feel the players would excuse mistakes as long as the updates were more frequent. Meaning, flavor of the month is preferred to flavor of the year.
---
This is sort of my biggest point, it should be a no-brainer to aggressively release balance patches and roll back as needed, like icefrog does. There's no excuse for infrequent updates with a launcher and daily downtime to push changes to the client on a 24 hour cycle.
---
I see 0 problems with this.
---
Looks at two kids playing the "I'm not touching you" game...no thanks.
---
What’s the difference between that and two fleets squaring off before an engagement?
---
I didn't downvote you, but I disagree with you.
---
oww, are you guy just sat in a 2 man corp with 0 support? Are 100% sure that is the best for your enjoyment of the game? 
---
You're not going to get any help skilling in the game, most of the corps give you a skill pack and a plan to get you on your feet. You're not getting access to corp citadels, means any industry will have huge fees due system indexs near public structures. 
---
You're going to have to learn PvP the hard way which I suspect means you will end up avoiding it altogether.
---
Put the corp on an alt, and both you really should consider joining a corp together, attend fleets together, work your way up to running fleets and make be a buy back. Make some friends and maybe consider running your own corp when you're in a position to help others.
---
PI nerds unite! Good job man wish I could get around to making a video.
---
Games have always had classes that are beyond useless. How it's a thing after 20+ years of patchable content is a question only Satan could answer
---
It’s so dumb and obvious no one would think about it...! ;)
---
in this context it is right they are risk adversed 
---
1 - they choice when to fight or even if they will fight, don't think they will win don't engange don't want to loss a ship
---
2 - they are 100% safe you can't find them it is as good as being docked 
---
3 - use dotlan/ingame intel to look for players in space and npc kills or cynos
---
4 - use zkills to see if there are gate camps avoid that area or go to that area
---
To be fair, it would just be crafting/farming/exploration game #6345 then. Think it just depends what you prefer
---
"more players" that are semi-afk mining are not "activity", buddy. Stagnation comes from lack of real, high stakes conflict, and capital proliferation killed that.
---
The diffence between maneuvering for advantage and denying a station Gunner the ability to use his guns because you didn't touch him yet?
---
Well the biggest is one of those fleets can start firing at any time. The station Gunner would have to wait until he was "tagged" so he could play.
---
Id pay decent isk for that, but its a fairly common corpse, hes played the game, and thus died.
---
The reasoning behind taking away the gunners toys is because it hinders smaller engagements and the gunner is risking nothing to be a whole bunch of fuck you in a 300km radius.
---
I haven't seen a real hardcore pass on weapon balance since gallente got dragged out of the trash can in my early days.
---
How dare a for profit company do things to nudge you towards paying them money while they provide you a service for free right?
---
Spoiled asshole
---
Pretty good chuckle there
---
I remember my friend getting so salty that his beloved old archon got changed into an apostle when he was afk.
---
That's not a gokul fleet. It is, in fact, a stuka fleet. You have command destroyers. If you didnt, you have a goku fleet.
---
Muninns.... Jackdaws... Both will do, even harpys can work, but you need numbers that's what it always boils down to... These things take time, I've seen both work well against Stuka/Goku but you need numbers at least say 60- 75%+ the numbers of the bomber fleet, plus boots, boosh, logi, everything... And against a skilled bombing FC... It only takes one mistake and your erased from the grid so these form ups take time you can't just yolo in with 50 dudes.  OP is pretty smug considering the same thing happens regularly to test and nearly every group at that lol (although I would say test is better then most at responding to these fleets no doubt) Bad super/rorq pilots cause FCs to end up in tough situations... sometimes the formup is quick enough to drop 15 fax and 30 dreads or titans/supers to chase off (you will likely lose caps that bounce)... but usually it's the same formula feed FAX/caps to buy time unless you have a serious blob of blobs ready to go, then go once you have subcap numbers.
---
This is awesome, I just set up my first PI chain and was wondering why it wasn't making money.
---
Turns out you need more than 3 extractor heads
---
no.
---
I actually really hope I'm wrong about all of this, and the cyno changes lead to a renaissance of nullsec strategic warfare.  But I don't see it.
---
&gt;the entire fleet will get pulled into a catch or drag bubble placed by the defenders  
---
&gt;well your fault for warping to a drag bubble. Again, not a matter of balance but of players.
---
Have...have you ever actually seen a capital battlefield?
---
Even when both sides are cynoing in the whole area is a bubblefest. If defensive bubbles can be used to fuck with an opposing fleets positioning, holy shit. That's why currently T3s are used by cap fleets as initial cynos and will often light the cyno in a hictor bubble.
---
For what it's worth I agree it is a bad player that tries to warp their capital fleet when the grid is bubbled by hostiles, *but that is why capital fights just won't happen anymore*. If the "defending" side can use a combination of cyno jammers, bubbles, and enough sniping firepower to keep force recons dead, the "attackers" will never get on grid. The defenders aren't trying to make a fight, they are trying to win their objective, usually a citadel, and will be happy to do that by denying their opponent any opportunity to win.
---
&gt;Especially supercaps fleets specifically need to keep themselves bubbled at all times in order to prevent losses due to DCs.  
---
&gt;Again that is an issue with the players not the game. To be fair also an issue with the game servers. But that should not be taken into account for balancing purposes.
---
Nah, it's a problem with the game, when a super or Titan DCs it loses half it EHP and then tries to warp itself to a probe-able random location off grid from the very people who might be interested in keeping it alive. No amount of player skill or training will change this and CCP will never reimburse supercaps lost to a DC. Even asking CCP to reinforce the node in advance doesn't remove this risk. The only counter is to bubblefest your own fleet so you can at least lock and rep the poor bastard until they can get back online. The idea that super fleets can warp around with a hostile armada in the same system, including T3 cruiser FC'd subcap fleets which can combat probe and be on your DC'd supers in seconds, is not a realistic option.
---
Honestly you went to his house, you should be hindered.
---
"My Lord, we tried to attack the soldiers by the castle, but the archers inside ATTACKED US! Castles attacking is unfair!"
---
So it boils down to you wanting the game easier for you. Make that the title. "I want the game easier for me"
---
That seems to be the plan.
---
The only problem is, the server belongs to PA now, so CCP can't just decide to shut it off. So they're going with the longer route of shedding enough players to make the game unprofitable, which will eventually force PA to shut it down.
---
Citadels are not great was said to ccp before they came out, the spam and how cheap they are to replace isn't great, loads of idea of citadels but that is another post
---
Jump gates in 2010 where much worse than now you could have more than one in a system and you had the auto defence of a pos 
---
hunter right now have way more access to free intel in null then the hunted.
---
your really moaning that there are more players in null now 
---
2010 i was ratting in a wyvern and would drop it on everything
---
Besides, it's Lorenzo. Elitposter elite of the elites, only surpassed by StainGuy.
---
All life is is filling time and doing what's entertaining to you. Eve is a great waste of time imo. You just salty cuz they made some changes you don't like.
---
Dude he is talking about the rorqual. Wake up.
---
space rock drill animal
---
Unfortunately yeah, almost always better off in a retribution, despite the reduced dps.
---
Also how easily it is squashed by carriers makes it kinda rubbish in this meta. Osprey navy or scythe navy are much better tank-wise :)
---
Hindered yes, but citadels are already incredibly safe with tethering. They don’t have to engage me if they don’t want to. If they are caught off the fort due to aggression I feel like that’s on them.
---
CCPs game has changed over the years. Complaining now is naive. People have always adapted and moved on. This is nothing different. Eve was stagnant and boring before the blackout. Krabs were far too safe. And null blocs lived in way too much peace for the highest area of wealth. They took a chance and shook it up. I applaud that. I'm very disappointed at the reactions of players who got too comfortable and secure in their safe null sec. Shame on them for not realizing what Eve was meant to be. CCP veered off course and all these noobs took the bait that was fed them. Injectors. Plex. Items that give effort no meaning anymore. 
---
Sorry if people are running away, but this what Eve was meant to be and what many players loved about it in the first place. Harden the fuck up.
---
&gt;a bit long
---
Lindybeige videos in a nutshell. I ramble a lot, this guy makes me look like an amateur.
---
CCP is waiting for yall to sink isk into small disintegrator specialization so that they could take kikis behind the shed. And then the cycle continues.
---
&gt;don't have to fear any decent retribution for his attempt of killing someone
---
I only don't fear retribution when my targets are bad at the game.
---
Instead of complaining, think about ways to be better. If the dirty PVPers can kill you, I guarantee you can kill them. Gate camp them. Bait them. Does not having a local chat really invalidate these options?
---
https://youtu.be/JARn16yojbQ?t=81
---
truth, luckily many share the same opinion as me, the change was not for you, and you were not effected by it
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;No he was not
---
thats what i just said retardguy
---
why would you intentionally make your own pvp risky? why would you want to make yourself more likely to die?
---
Do not worry. They are planning to announce some new "great" game that will not see the release date like many times before... Another lost money they could have put to Eve...
---
Pretty much actually, and if you don’t have the right people online, it’s like yelling into the void for help hoping someone will pay attention. I mean, I wish caps could work against them but they don’t unless you have so many fighters out that that have no hope of killing them all before they catch the target. 
---
A total of maybe 20-30 people are consistently the driving force of home defense and the rest just leech.
---
But muh something something ElItE pVp MiNmAtAr RiFtEr YaRr pew pew
---
Fact: CCP has a really bad trackrecord in some areas of game design, particularly balance. There are numerous cases where CCP has been pushing through idea’s for which we all correctly predicted what they would result in, and they went with it anyway, only to later conclude themselves they fucked up.
---
I have zero confidence in that they suddenly become competent.
---
We need rigorous changes to the game, but rigorous is not the same as binary unsophisticated changes. The blackout change is a clear example of this. Rather then introducing some local delay of eg 15 seconds to shift some but not all window of opportunity to attack and escape to the attacker from the victim respectively, they pretty much turn off the lights. And this isnt some pve whine as I dont have to pve anymore myself. It’s just looking at it from distance.
---
yeah you did an excellent job of tanking.
---
I guess it's a "second galaxy" to play EVE in, with whatever galaxy New Eden is in being the first.
---
&gt;this is what’s going to kill EVE: shit balance left to rot for years.
---
This is literally why Eve is always dying.  Gross mismanagement of gameplay balance.  
---
Eve is always losing core players that just get tired of the same broken mechanics.  Almost every 'fix' is more broken then the last, again due to mismanagement.
---
Eve pay structure is again completely mismanaged.  The game should survive off monthly subs, not plex, not injectors.  Currently, this system rewards anything that captures new players while simultaneously turning their back on older players who no longer 'pay to play'.  In a way, Eve is a pyramid scheme.
---
Ship tiers and jump drives are another issue.  Eve should have only 1 tier of ships, and PvP should be accessible without 6-12 months worth of fitting, tanking, and damage skills.  Either all ships or no ships should have jump drives, and every ship class and race should have clear and present weakness and strengths to other ship classes and race.
---
Ethetera...
---
Someone with Gunner roles must be present for those guns to work. Which means coming off tether may be a mistake, but it could also be a trap. If you keep falling for traps that's on you.
---
We do have very competent pvpers, they just aren’t always around to help defend home at the drop of a dime. A lot of people are protesting the new changes as well which hasn’t been helping numbers.
---
We should all email them a bug report about that.
---
I'm sure they'd appreciate the feedback!
---
Are you init?
---
This right here. Stop pretending he's a hard man for starters.
---
Goonswarm, as an alliance, has multiple buyback services, the most widely used are priced around 110-115% Jita buy for almost any kind of ore/mineral/salvage/module.
---
Same with drek
---
Unless you use said bots to vote...
---
Probably there abouts, maybe a shade under.
---
I started laughing out loud in the cafe I'm eating breakfast at. This is so damn true.
---
We have people who can, but not an unlimited number available at all times.
---
I don't see the point, it's just painful getting the fucking things off grid after you wipe shit unless you can be bothered being organised with alts etc. 
---
The solitary time we did drop a super was when these guys rolling holes popped out in our system and kept trying to sandbag us. So I baited with a tackle hull tanked mega and my friend dropped the super. They kept blobbing with trig ships then running away, so it was nice we pulled that off.
---
just mix shit up, if it's op for a month who cares game stale
---
blackedout was a good start, now make a reason for people to big brain the game again
---
Definitely a healthy thing to get pissed off about space pixels ;)
---
Different devs. We get the third (fourth?) string devs now.
---
Actually, the warp tunnel isn't the whole problem as I've been in capital warp tunnels and they space out in a sphere just like subcaps do, so bumping isn't that bad.
---
However, the drag/catch bubbles will totally cause caps to bunch up into a bumpy little mess, making warping into a capital battlefield impossible.
---
This will make meaningful combat in nullsec exceptionally unwise as (currently) the only battles which matter are over citadels which are single points of conflict. Citadels are not hellcamp-able. This means the defender gets to set up. The defender can set up bubbles, cynos, and have their supers, caps, and support fleets ready long before the vulnerability period.
---
This means that: -
---
a) the attacker has to use caps (cos no amount of subs will break organised caps).
---
b) the attacker can't bring caps unless the defender lets them.
---
Now, occasionally we may see situations where the defender goofs up b) in some way and the attacker can actually spot this and exploit it, cyno and deploy, but this will be rarer then a cunning defender baiting the attacker into a trap. I other words a non-retarded attacker will simply never attack anywhere actively defended. This is worse than the current null stagnation.
---
By themselves these cyno changes may possibly have made a bluer doughnut than anyone has ever seen or wanted before.
---
Again, I honestly hope I'm wrong about this.
---
&gt;just mix shit up, if it's op for a month who cares game stale
---
I really think this would be very preferable to what we currently have.
---
Figuring out new fits, new roles, and new ways to play the game in response to rebalancing is a big part of the game for many people, both pvpers and krabs
---
If it's a Sigil, my money is that they thought you're bait.
---
No. Because optimizing fits is core game play.
---
&gt;However, the drag/catch bubbles will totally cause caps to bunch up into a bumpy little mess, making warping into a capital battlefield impossible.
---
drag bubble does not change the way the warp works. It changes the destination of the warp, but you still land around the  destination.
---
good getting blasted by bombers? 🦀bomber nerfs inc🦀

Hi nova
---
Oracle is better than the Tornado
---
Talos is generally better too
---
Naga has it's uses
---
If anything the Tornado is the weakest, most niche pick, of the ABCs. It's just that it's niche use in suicide ganking is the only viable use for any of them right now as their threats have been power creeped to oblivion, and ram jags prevent them from operating at range.
---
Do it!! I had no clue I was going to do this video until a few minutes before when I realized I need to re-do a planet. 
---
I’ll go ahead and say streaming is a hell of a lot easier than making a video, especially if you’re doing editing or what not. Luckily for me I did this video and I didn’t edit or anything extra!
---
Whers have been screaming for years that wh PvE is too safe. We are on your side here. But completely removing the ability to roll holes would make wh PvE considerably more safe. The primary way we catch wh ratters is by rage rolling our static and rolling into them mid site.
---
If you want to make it more risky. It would have a much bigger impact if whs die after a few minutes, and outbound connections spawn instantly. Also wh sites should scram to disallow the use of mjds.
---
Not if you have 100 of them...
---
you can warp your caps to a cloaked alt, eg a cloaked sabre.
---
You not doing it is a choice, don't make it sound like it's a mechanism.
---
Wait I though test goons xxXxxXxx red and razor were on the same side in this game
---
This is what most people critics don't grasp.
---
EvE is a HUGELY complex game with a tremendous number of vectors to gain ISK. People will ALWAYS be looking for the easiest vector and it typically isn't identifiable until 1000 bots start doing the same thing every day.
---
It's the same with PvP. All the spreadsheets and math says, by odds, Fit X is 50/50 with Y. But, because of the production chain problem above, Fit Y quickly becomes 75% of the cost of X.  
---
It's a complex problem to solve that is more comparable to calculating the number of communication channels than anything else.  
---
So, if EvE had just 2 missions, 2 rats, 2 ship, four items to fit, and two asteroids that crafted just 2 of the other items (assuming 1 mission always grants an item and a rat always gives the other. 
---
Then the actual number of balance combinations to account for is 66.
---
If we just change the number of asteroids involved to the actual count in EvE (12) but kept the ores at 1 to 1, the increase in balance combinations goes from 66 to 231.
---
It is a tremendously difficult problem and one that goes unproven until a year or more into a rebalance cycle.
---
There are blatantly overpowered ships that are extremely oppressive to literally any ship that isn't them. Jaguars are the standout example, any gang with less than 1000 anti frigate damage is pretty much pushed out of the game as a result of a 50m frigate.
---
You didn't listen at all did you.
---
&gt;The best they can do is stir the waters from time to time and break stagnation.
---
it's completely stagnant, and has been since eve was released
---
You should fuck all the way off.
---
I haven't been playing the game for about 7-8 months now. The recent changes like the blackout or cynos were not the reason I quit.
---
all PVE is shit gameplay
---
a side not though caps are the one thing that is actually balanced in this regard.    Pick a cap and just jump in with it.   They all work the same.    Now look at what everyone is suggesting for defending against stukas  how many different trains are you looking at.   Just a thought.
---

C'mon, you have to fork over for a Nereus to light your jf cyno instead of a noobship? The horror! 
---
If that's not a rounding error on the value of your cargo you're doing something wrong.
---
ramjag
---
The risk of bumping is minor compared to the real issue: -
---
a) the attacker has to use caps.
---
b) the attacker can't bring caps.
---
CCP changed cynos so that supers couldn't rat with the safety of an umbrella.
---
What they have actually done is fuck cap PVP.
---
I love cap PVP, so I really hope I'm wrong, but you are not convincing me.
---
It's why we have compact and enduring MWDs. Tiericide was great.
---
Could afford 30bn+
---
Couldn't afford an escort capable of taking down two destroyers.
---
The game ran on PC. I played the closed alpha on PC.
---
Get your align to under 2s, use inertial stabs, not nano.  It will help you with the 2 smartbomb guy in Stain.  Avoid fights, get probe strength to 90 some and two sets of probes.

---
Dust was funded heavily by Sony.
---
I'm telling you, why make people spend resources/time/effort doing that when they're not even the problem or necessarily what was meant to change? It's punishing a large group of players and a big aspect of the game for no reason other than collateral damage from removing the cyno tumor.
---
If it can be made easier for these people to continue their fun in the game - and you're not even giving them new equipment just changing labels/allowances - then I don't see why they shouldn't be helped
---
Yeah dreks are pretty strong too. I guess it seems like less of a problem since you can at least pin them down with a frigate and blob them like any battlecruiser.
---
I already answered to that. Read previous answers and try to understand their meaning.
---
"unfair advantage" is the key here.
---
It’s an alpha. You are suppose to help them test the game, not really play it. Undock, fly around, shoot stuff and report anything that doesn’t work as expected.
---
I am not trying to convince you.
---
I tell you where you are wrong, but you are free to have an opinion of your own.
---
LOL, but where is the cloaked alt? In the bubbles or at a ping over 150KM above the battle?
---
Cap fleets are not mobile, and are really, really, really probable. By the time they come out of warp 200KM off the fight the hostiles will probe them and then waterboard them until after the timer has expired.
---
i.e. it's not an option for the attacker.
---
hi
---
Well yeah but...
---
I don't know u
---
Balance only truly affects older players.  Older players are often not paying any money any more.  Basically they don't care about retention passed that point.
---
?
---
you go to delve often? finding a super is not that hard
---
30 * 15 — not bad
---
Thank god infinite anoms are a thing
---
Funny how the people pushing for "no local" had no problem dealing in absolutes *before* the blackout. It was absolutely going to kill botting, no question, no way for them to recover.
---
Now that there's proof that it didn't, *we're* being basic for pointing that out lol
---
then learn to place your alt correctly, and/or to destroy bubbles.
---
I know what you mean : if the grid is full of bubbles then there is no way to get your caps inside the fight, as the bubblefuck spread is too wide. Then you lost because you did not have anything to clean the bubbles, hey. Don't expect that just because you have more caps, then you will be able to have instant firepower anywhere.
---
That's called tactics.
---
why should the risk be on the pve'er side only? 
---
should it not be balanced that both are at equal risk when in space? if you say no as a hunter i should be safer that is risk adverse pvp
---
The excuse for years has been basically that they are being careful, not wanting to do exactly what they are doing now with chaos.  So, IMO, there should be no excuse any more to just start flipping levers on ships and mods all over.  They can start with Barrage ammo and the poor poor proteus.
---
This guy balances.
---
So you've moved on. To what? Posting on /r/eve?
---
Let them bot in peace.
---
underrated post...
---
&gt;why should the risk be on the pve'er side only?
---
it isn't
---
&gt;should it not be balanced that both are at equal risk when in space?
---
depends what they're doing
---
&gt;if you say no as a hunter i should be safer that is risk adverse pvp
---
being selective about your targets is how risk is managed as a hunter, it's super easy to get caught by what you think is a target, only to get scrammed and have 3-4 people kill you nearly instantly
---
do you even have solo/small gang kills?
---
Yeah he hit the overheat button on his booster. Congrats?
---
When does your NDA run out? Really want to hear the rest of the story, doubt i'll be surprised by the level of incompetence CCP can display but i'll keep the popcorn warm for that day...
---
Tell that to the "grrr gons" brigade.
---
Honestly every time they make balance changes you get the same hyper autistic crowd screaming that things are being changed too fast and that all changes in the game are made for skill injector sales
---
trying to stop people from wasting their lives away on this garbage... you know, kind of like a drug abuse intervention...
---
Tell me how you suggest to balance the 100+ ships with 1000+ possible combination of modules with their different meta level  and the 100+ rigs on different play style?
---
sounds to me “change this cus i suck in pvp”
---
You need an extra monitor to do something productive and you gonna feel fine :p
---
Triglavians gonna be loaded with skills if they can figure out how to send mail in triangle talk.
---
Opinions are like assholes. Plenty of people on this sub still enjoy playing EVE. The people who see your posting and agree are just bitter turds in the same boat as you, hopelessly bitching about how bad the game is instead of moving the fuck on.
---
Nice to see *somebody* sinking some money into "EVE".
---
You'd be surprised how useful that is in everyday life.    
---
As is it's opposite of pushing forward with comrades you trust.
---
Could have avoided all of this by allowing corvette cynos
---
We once rolled our static wh into the middle of a massive move op or state of the alliance gathering of some such event and our small cruiser gang for dropped by all sorts of caps plus countless subcaps. Rick sent a mail to us apologising for the overreaction, explaining there just happened to be tons of dudes all in caps who all got excited at the chance go drop on something. Good dude indeed I really appreciated the mail
---
Additional bonus fun fact: Because reasons, you can't search for those invasion-specific ores (Bezdnacine, Rakovene, Talassonite) either on the market or the Search New Eden tab, so it's really hard to actually know about that aspect of them
---
Google translation sucks, it translated that as "Frat sends its nuclear energy". Does this mean something similar to "Frat sends its regards"? Or does it translate to "Frat is a superpower"?
---
Truer words. Imagine a month of rotting garbage in front of your place because there are no garbage men.
---
Older players are also content. You dont want them in invincible ships. If there are no older players, who is going to buy the plex?
---
Aye I'm glad he doesn't have to deal with sorts bullshit tyranny
---
I feel your pain, too scared to adapt and hope that sufficient whingeing rolls back blackout.  I hope that ccp boosts null rewards and gives you the incentive to undock, else head to LS.
---
Wow an argument against any possible change ever, cool
---
Sorry you're so brainless you can't find any obvious faults with the current metagame, my condolences
---
We have compact, enduring and scoped versions of most modules that have the relevant stats. I'm not 100% sure which categories are even missing them right now.
---
I found it's been great for lower SP characters and pvp fits
---
Oracle says hi.
---
That’s not so much balance you’re referring to as the difference between only one good solution and having having multiple viable options.
---
There is a time period that older players hang around hoping for things to be fixed.  And compared to new bros, older players are often in much more powerful ships.
---
fozzie claw
---
what they can do is make a system where nobody is safe. Putting an alt to scout a gate is cool, but once a covert cyno is in the system, it becomes easy to drop on the myrms. 
---
The point is not to make it so any roamer is guaranteed to be able to grab and kill a ratter, its to provide imperfect intel to both sides so they must take un-educated risks. Botter or not.
---
Cheep like -50m I think you are looking for a frigass with reps, like Enyo or the one you can fly o like the  most. If you are cheep like 100m I would take a Svipul with combats probes. But hey, there are a lot of options.
---
That sounds pretty shit for the few active defenders. Back in the older days of selective vs mass recruiting, those guys would be the core of a much smaller and more elite group most likely.
---
have you considered that maybe it's the ones still playing that are the bitter turds, literally subjecting themselves to suffering just to piss off those who tell them it's a garbage game? it all depends on the side that you are on...
---
I'm pretty sure they said they would do exactly this then we got a balance pass then a small iteration and then they forgot about it completely...they need to balance their development priorities and stop making promises that are forgotten a month later before they can think about balancing the game...
---
More dots! Cancel dots!
---
then it was probably a squad warp into insurance fraud or something
---
Get rid of Sirens and Dromis too, self tackling Supers and carriers was a truly dumb idea.
---
Im guessing based on how i personally feel and know others to feel that its because being part of a blob isnt fun, so, i personally want a smaller scale, to at least be viable. But, with the meta right now, its very hard to do anything small scale, rorquals are hard to beat under an umbrella, and theres very little counterplay. And so with sandcastles like delve and eso, if thats all there is in eve, then that kills off a lot of the game.ive been a part of nullblocs for most of my eve career, and, it just got terribly boring being a number. I think eve thrives better as smaller groups, ofc i dont want all groups to be 300 man corps. But i dont think alliances over 5K are a good thing. Ofc super/cap proliferation plays into it as well, but i doubt anything will change at this point.
---
Glad to hear it. 
---
Next on the list of chaos is changes to cloaking and covert cynos. Your continued support will be appreciated.
---
dude it was like 2am in the morning US time
---
each neut burst will kill cap on whole stuka fleet, so neut bursts and web bursts on each super will solve their sig+speed tanking very fast.
---
lmfao this post is fucking gold
---
meh
---
Yes i've done small and solo gang stuff. I've done bait work be it being the bait the bridger andf i've been on the other end of it.
---
Risk management is one thing but i've said this for years if you are undocked i should be able to find you and kill you cloaked ships right now are overpowered. I'll also state i don't want it to be an easy find but covert cloaks should be the easist to find as you can warp off still cloaked
---
100% agree
---
Yeah, but powerful is okay. Overpowered is not.
---
And that's why we should quit supporting ccp. They are only in it for the money and dont care about fixing this mess of a game
---
Agreed.
---
You didn't make a coherent point at all did you.
---
Maybe if you live in null you should be at least somewhat competent in PvP. Wouldn't hurt to encourage your members to learn how to defend themselves at the very least instead of relying on the "pvpers that aren't around"
---
What a sad little comment. I feel sorry for you.
---
Honestly, for the complexity of the game, the devs do an absolutely smashing job of it.   
---
   
---
Sure, they're human, but they do a better job of balancing than pretty much any game in the last twenty years.
---
I too feel like Shrek
---
I am impressed that someone could make a post that so easily sums of the entirety of reddit users with "wormholer" and "cloaked" flair so well.
---
Finally someone that actually gets it.
---
I like that can even jump JF to cyno-jammed system.
---
A cloak and being able to jettison, would have made one helluva fuel truck.
---
Nomen is still viable but it’s really tough and unforgiving. The retri is just so much better in the current meta. The staying power of a bling prop/repper/point retri with speed drugs is insane combined with the sig reduction.
---
CCPlease gibs officer TPs
---
&gt; Rule 1 never play eve to escape. If you play eve when you feel bad its time to stop and take responsibility for your life. 
---
i disagree with this rule as it stands, "i've had a bad day" i log in play eve socialize with friends i've escaped the mind set that made me feel bad it has cut the cycle. 
---
&gt; Rule 3 if youre bored in eve youre probably responsible. Go take care of irl or try new stuff. 
---
I agree with this statement there is so much to try and do in eve. 
---
&gt; Rule 2 never chase others dreams when u play. I play for my director role much more than spaceship elitism and im much happier now 
---
IMO this is semi right i enjoy helping others get to the dreams/goals in eve when i can.
---
Fortunately for them there are no other games worth moving to :p
---
wouldn't it be wired if this was true and death was only you waking up to go to work and we aren't even humans as they are a construct for this game
---
Jackdaws are surprising good in small nano gangs and very new pilot friendly. They’re slow so stay away from things, but they’re also extremely quick to warp even with 0 speed or alignment in speed mode, which makes them forgiving to new pilots who are getting used to manual piloting. Just stay well out of point/web/scram range and once you’re there, switch to range mode and do your thing. You’ll obviously need a gang for this to work, or at least something that can get in and hold point while you apply DPS. Killed many ratters and had many small gang fights just like this.
---
what you DON'T want the PVP meta to descend to whoever gets caps on grid first just wins the fight with no risk of a counter drop as LR dreads/carriers haze the only 2 ships able to light a loud cyno
---
Look at the bottom of the interface to the chat channels. The one marked local is for the solar system you are in. So what I know, bare with me. The speaker list on the right in that window is a real time list of all players in your solar system. People use this as a tool to help them know if someone is in system that doesn't belong. By working together large groups could track a hostile form system to system and help secure their vulnerable assets.
---
Now press the "v" button. A map will pop up and you may hear a ping sound. This is the directional-scan and by changing the angle slider and range you can use this as well to see ships nearby. Like local though it's of less use the more things show up on it. Information overload.
---
Every system has a security rating in the top left. The lower the number the less Concord will interfere. Null sec  systems are 0.0 or less systems where Concord does not go. There players can hold ownership of systems and create civilization from chaos. These civilizations require hundreds of man hours to maintain and just as many people. The accomplishment is admirable.
---
Some say because the game doesn't support the creation of these societies well and they are require too much effort to create they are unfair. They cried here on Reddit and other places that the ability of these groups to guard each other and work toward the greater good was unfair, the CEO of the game company eventually agreed.
---
The CEO created a ChAoS ErA. Blackout was the first of many changes intended to make the game harder for the folks already putting in effort to maintain these societies.
---
Blackout is the removal of the real-time aspect of the local list in the client. This reduces the information to be shared making sneaking around easier if not trivial with certain ship modules.
---
The result was predictable. Those who used the real-time list for those main source of risk mitigation found themselves overwhelmed and moved on to other playstyles or games. Societies that used capitals to guard capitals remained.
---
Enter cyno changes. After fishing the lake dry of small fish in under a month, eyes were turned to the big ones. It's too hard to kill the big ones they say with the low effort they wish to use, so Papa Hilmar is making changes where the ships that were left to be saved are harder to do so.
---
Obviously low effort people are happy. High effort players are not. These changes are low effort changes for low effort people. I'm sure you know how well doing things in a half-assed way turns out.
---
This isn't possible. Subcaps can never, ever kill capitals - especially when the capitals out number them. This is FAKE NEWS.
---
CCP most likely owns the intellectual property of the designs if he drew them for work.
---
It did essentially. Alpha Myrms are not the same as botting Nyx's you  dolt.
---
just have it be somewhat capacitor intensive but it have possibly like a 15-20km range and act like the PDS on citadels
---
I think it's much much much more difficult than you seem to think and make it sound.
---
The harder you pat yourself on the back for something, the harder it is to admit you were wrong.
---
I wouldn't say delete them but change their roles from points and webs to damps and paints
---
Yes they can be other ewar but not point/webs
---
Haha yah. But those hunter groups are kinda forced into cheap bombers because of the capital umbrellas. It’s not fun to lose t3cs and stratios because a bunch of ppl dropped 20 nyxes with faxes onto your group that spent 2 hrs searching for this one niddy to drop on. The bomber meta is a response to the capital umbrella meta. Just cause and effects. 
---
Sucks to be on the hunting side and you work so hard and then the other guy pops a cyno with one button and then all his friends come in to kill you. Why make it worse on yourself to lose a fleet of t3cs when you could just lose a fleet of bombers? Not going to get into what’s killing the game. I’m just going to say that it’s all cause and effect. The players that love eve and have played for decades aren’t going anywhere. They’ll stay, both sides of the fence. They’ll suffer through because they love spaceships just like I do haha. And eventually they’ll find a way to adjust their playstyle
---
Let the salt flow brother, let it flow
---
I dont say improvement cant be done.. The problem is how things were brought.
---
The ships can’t and will never being balanced as you want... Otherwise, copy paste all the ships and swap the skin for the different races. 
---
“Proteus is the worse since rebalance” is totally wrong. Statement totally wrong
---
All I read here is "I can't fly my 25 rorqs now without risk, waaaaaaaa".
---
You do not want to do trade with an alpha clone, without full trade skills the percentages are really bad. About minning I have no idea :P
---
More info? I am aware of the PC releases that CCP had for a while but i thought only devs had it for themselves. What kind of PC could run it?
---
I am sorry but i will keep it. They stated they will support more devices soon, so i will wait
---
I kept waiting for the entertainment the Heads all require.
---
If citadels are changed and it becomes possible to hell-camp them then maybe it'll be possible to still get around a defenders preparations. But otherwise unless a defender wants to allow an attacker to bring caps or massively screws up, it will be beyond cancer to get caps into position, in a timely manner without massive risk.
---
Please understand - I live in Delve. I don't need citadels to be killable. I just think its retarded if they are. Especially if it's an unintended consequence of trying to prevent umbrellas from existing.
---
I was a GM at the time. The internal alpha build was PC based, but very complete.
---
That was a fun scrap! Poor jackdaws though..
---
Post is actually a goodpost, but noone has the patience to read its 4th sentence.
---
Do you 1v1? a t1 noob doesn't fight a t2 or pirate faction.  A vet with perfect fitting might because they don't care if they lose, and their probably running billions in implants and drugs and links.
---
I've seen plenty of T2 fleets annihilate much larger T1 fleets.   From both sides.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is:  To a newer player, older players are overpowered, not just powerful.      
---
Tbh I don't remember where this conversation started, but when T2, caps, pirate faction ships are the realm of the older or injected player.  Do T1 fleets even happen anymore?  That's broken.
---
holy shit dude it was insane how much you tanked, we were shooting you for a long ass while and had to move all the kikis in occult range too
---
blackout and VNI nerf killed just players settled small regions like provi... :-(
---
Huh? You are so delusional It isn't even funny anymore.
---
Null should be very hard...but could use a buff to the reward part of risk vs reward
---
&gt; Null sec should be hard and my one request is for you to boost rewards in null to provide some incentive for the herds.
---
In theory, very high income which you get while losing a lot of shit and still not caring much is as engaging as it can get. Very hard to balance while relying on players to constitute both sides of the equation.
---
i liked that, too. they probably could have done some damage if they had combat drones out :P
---
he's kinda on and off tbh, but he does make things fun :D
---
thanks!
---
faction modules and faction LP stores are fucked in the same way. few modules are good and all others are so overpriced and never be used, same with many implants and rigs...
---
Don't you make more then a highsec orca with a booster venture on a nullmoon? You can get a retriver with the Recruit a friend bonus, send that alt to horde or some alliance like that, then go on the moon ops they ping and sell to the buyback. Bam easy isk.
---
Welcome to eve!  You must be new
---
Sure, we're flying blackops fleets. So covert ops frigates and cruisers, main DPS bombers.   
---
We sent hunters out a wormhole to a random region, a target it caught, and we take a blops bridge to it. You saw the rest :)
---
It only took you 4 days to figure out that there could not possibly be anything suspicious going on in a room full of the Eve online's most sophisticated sociopaths that CCP decided will share sensitive information about the game in exchange for your suggestions to influence them...
---
I actually believe your statement is sincere and not coerced, suborned or compensated in any way because if your intention was to lie you would have hopefully been smart enough not to foolishly discredit yourself by making such an absurd claim "in good conscience" in the first place.
---
Metagaming in the CSM is like botting in eve's alliances, if your not doing it then your already falling behind the competition...
---
You sir have been made a fool at your own expense.
---
Welcome to the CSM, time to catch up!
---
iam older player and Iam paying for main and use plex for 3alts which were used as cynoalts, indy alts, mining alts or semiafk pve with VNI/ishtar/gila/domi ratting. after all blackout/VNI nerf/cyno changes iam done with all my alts and with my main I just join some pinged fleet, from these changes my ship do not create any content for hunters :-D well played ccp
---
&gt; Yeah Blackout isn't doing anything to curb capital growth.
---
sure it is, lots of people quitting = fewer capitals.
---
They should have introduced the module before patch day...
---
Neither were your alts producing any value to CCP.  And only a fraction of PVPers are even interested in chasing your shit fit afk alts.
---
Null already has pretty great rewards. I just want there to be LESS FREE INTEL.
---
Like, I use it myself, but being able to tell who is doing what where just by looking at the map is stupid.
---
&gt; This has been a problem since EVE began and it's not something other games seem to suffer much from.
---
I mean, imagine CCP going changes on the same schedule as any other game company that run PvP games. People complete training into some ship only for CCP to change it. And blind change at that because without said ship properly going into wide usage CCP's feedback can only be limited.
---
And don't forget industry and market being shaken every time.
---
Of course while that is a valid excuse for slower balancing process, even that excuse has its limits. So there's that.
---
Ya, that was quite funny, we were at the SOTA, and suddenly someone reported a cruiser gang in the middle of our space.
---
CCP needs to just come out with EVE classic. They can even keep the same graphics they have developed. just go back to the old style jumps and pre fozie sov and this game would fill with life again! Ditch bombers and cloaking because that shit is the gay
---
&gt;I dont say improvement cant be done.. The problem is how things were brought.
---
What does this even mean?
---
&gt;The ships can’t and will never being balanced as you want... Otherwise, copy paste all the ships and swap the skin for the different races. 
---
Funny, I never actually elaborated on what I wanted balance-wise specifically for exactly this reason, all I ever said was they should make changes more often. So you're basically making shit up now.
---
&gt;“Proteus is the worse since rebalance” is totally wrong. Statement totally wrong
---
You're the first person in 150+ comments to suggest the Proteus is anything but complete garbage, so I think you might just be a moron.
---
Dont see why JF are even in the game. All this risk adverse gameplay shouldn’t exist in a Hardcore MMO. Go play classic WoW FFS.
---
cloaking has nothing to do with what we were talking about, nice job changing the subject
---
just curious for all those people that play in hisec, what exactly are you using the isk for?
---
And bombs
---
Wait...there's more supers in delve? Shoot I was not aware.
---
"Do you think its a good idea?"
---
short answer, no. 
---
long answer, nope.
---
shit fit, really scumabag? https://zkillboard.com/kill/76730744/  
---
you know shit and think that there is no value... so many roaming pvpers were trying kill my alts but now they do not need into our pocket, because it is dead :-D well played CCp
---
\*affected
---
So its just another whining post?
---
- ReditUser: Change things often CCPls!!
---
- CCP: Change what?
---
- ReditUser: THINGS!!
---
Im ok with the fact people do not agree with me (do u), I’d prefer a loki to be honest but my prot+Asklapian do the job perfectly for my use case.

Using plex still brings in money. It's simple economics. IF there's demand for plex to pay for omega, then plex is worth more isk. If plex is worth more isk, more plex is bought for cash to sell for isk. Plus, its ~$20 for 1 month of game time with plex compared to ~$15 if you buy with straight cash.
---
Seriously, no MMO company that does this (I know of at least 3: Eve, WoW, and Runescape) would do this is they didn't make money off long-term players. Back when I played WoW, I didn't pay for membership for years. Blizzard was still making money off me though.
---
TL;DR why on earth would there be an option to pay with plex if CCP didn't make money off it? Whether I pay $15 cash and you pay $15 cash, or I pay $15 cash and buy $15 worth of plex a month and you pay with ISK, CCP makes money. If the plexers quite, less plex is sold.
---
You're right.  That's why they were chasing you specifically.  Most of them are shit fit.
---
You still only produce value because plex exists, which it shouldn't.
---
There's people making billions who never undock and you're here pitching a fit because you don't like starships.
---
I didn't want to distract from my main point of wanting more frequent balance iteration by spawning a bunch of discussions about the minutiae of which ships and mods are bad and why.
---
I don't know why this idea is so hard for you to grasp, almost like you really are a moron or something.
---
more anger sir, more ANGER!
---
Yeah, what does he think this is some kind of EVE discussion board!?
---
What's up with your sound? I had to turn my headset and YouTube all the way up just to even hear shit. Although just had a quick glance at your other videos. Shit tier quality, no comms or explanation about anything. Talk about boring.   
---
Then again, I don't know what I expected from someone whose highest watched video is the Eve online Trailer that you ripped straight from CCP and uploaded to your channel for views hahaha
---
thats just "gemini whale united" botting renter , housed by theran alliance structures ( at least until recently when the botter moved to deklein after losing half his fleet in fade everyday)
---
he reships into these mostly alpha myrms every day, killing him is kinda useless for the most part, he just reships and proceeds...
---
it is sooooo obvious botting and going on for ages now ( [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008988/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008988/)  )  i have the feeling its actually only 5-10 guys actively playing in that alliance, with dozens of alts ratting away...
---
I have not-perfect skills (IV IV) so if you're similar, I'd do 3 heads per extractor, 6 basic factories, and 3 advanced. Makes T0-&gt;T2 fairly consistently in j-space although sometimes I run short on T0 stuff.
---
nice meme friendo
---
Probably. But this is a pretty late change.
---
Hope it happens.  Need to get the JF moving.
---
lol and do you think you find in space better ships now? some space is completely empty and in some areas are just tons cheapest aplha myrmidons.    
---
but if it is ok for you, enjoy your game
---
It's ok to care about things, even if they are just pixels m8.
---
Yep, Eve Online... Dying since 2003.
---
Believe it or not, I agree with you, but I think CCP shouldn't make a shooter game unless they're willing to put in the effort to make it stand out from the crowd.
---
Just my opinion.
---
I do some solo.
---
&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say is: To a newer player, older players are overpowered, not just powerful. 
---
If the game allows for progression, it must be that way to some extent. I think there is a difference between powerful and overpowered even if in a particular situation the result is the same.
---
Some of the things that used to be overpowered: Svipul, links, Othrus/Garmur (arguably still so), and some of the Triglavian ships.
---
can anyone tell us what rewards is in null sec right now? (for non bots charakters)
---
what rewards?
---
Plex shouldn't exist.  My argument stems from this belief.  CCP should have left people to pay for their subs directly. 
---
But here is my counterpoint:  farmers cause inflation.  Inflation means people buy fewer plex, which means ccp makes less money.  So with less demand prices would drop and people will but more plex to generate the same level of isk.
---
Simple economics
---
People who are making billions exist because risk adverse trading is a thing. Can’t trade or sell good that have high risk on them. 
---
JF remove import content that eve once had. It lowers the value of certain ore, good, etc due to the fact their risk is low and rewards is game breaking. Just like nullsec where rewards were brokenly high and risk were damn near non existent. Blackout finally pushes eve in the right direction. The cyno changes is helping clear a path to a brighter future. Removing JF/cynos completely would get eve out the shitter. Thats what needs to happen! Gate your good like the good ole day and stop implementing risk adverse features.
---
#HardcoreMMO
---
&gt; Plex shouldn't exist.
---
That is a stance I can respect, even if I disagree with it.
---
Your next argument doesn't hold water though. Inflation also increases how much plex sells for. Plus you're making a separate argument from your original one, that "Older players are often not paying any money any more" which is false, and what I originally argued against.
---
It is not like we are complaining right now. It is years of complains but usually CCP ask for feedback that they rarely care at the end.
---
So yes, they are shaking things up, but they are doing it wrong.
---
The Blackout has been wrongly done because the intel is still MASSIVE &gt; FOR &lt; the hunters. Number of NPC killed, Average players in the last 30 mn, immediate lossmails/killmails, etc. always accurate and immediatly accessible. CCP really want to HTFU the players ? Right, then they should REMOVE/DELAY this intel and after that, we will be talking. But as usual, they always do the lazy move without any preliminary thinking of all possible consequences. A few like the Industrial Cyno... **I am pretty sure that if they did remove/delay said intel at the same time, maybe the Blackout would have been more accepted.** But it is too late now, the lost players won't return even if they will correct the issue in the future months (if they do...) because the trust is lost and they won't probably get the news anyway.
---
Nerf cynos will solve nothing as any future opponent know that even if capital ships of the targetted coalition will move more difficultly than before, they are still there waiting for a good occasion to help the defence. The only thing it will do is making harder to ATTACK with them... That will NOT help new alliances to get some territories. And again, it is CCP fault since 2011 because they decided to fed the noobs, as you said.
---
The market taxes has only make the Perimeter Citadel mandatory, making the coalitions who share the profit able to keep a decent income despite a probable loss of players.
---
And at the same time, many new characters has been created just to scout gates. Great, more PLEXes to sell to the players... I don't think that it was what we asked.
---
Again, they are doing it wrong. First, CCP should realize that they are the problem of the game. After that, stop acting before thinking, and let's discuss of any proposition they will do.
---
Of course, it will never happen. The nordic pride is still here, and they usually refuse to admit when a nerf was wrong so why would it change now.
---
It seemed that behind CCP Seagull, we were going to get these frequent updates, but with her no longer being in the picture, I'm afraid we're stuck with the bi-yearly release cycle.
---
I'm not too sure about the 24-hr cycle though. Surely there isn't enough data to make an informed decision based off of a single day.
---
Old Dust and planetary bombardment from eve was amazing combination, but we now waiting 3years and they still have developed shit :-(
---
because you can inject to 20 mil sp anyway?
---
Easy isk/hr, valuable moon minerals, rapid escalations. The amount of effort to get things out of null is so wildly less than lowsec it's hard to fathom.
---
Like seriously - belt ratting for 10-18m ticks used to be the go-to for making isk in low/null. Now you go out in an ishtar and make at least 3x that whereas lowsec you can maybe get lucky with a clone soldier.
---
Exploration, gas huffing, etc are also more profitable in null than low.
---
i too read /r/eve and just because someone types a long thing doesn't mean they capture the real issues. please stop replying to me as I don't care
---
yes game principles of old Dust514 was so good
---
That is a new change. I suspect a bug
---
You beat me to this and i can’t upvote it enough
---
Except the data on eveoffline, dotlan, MER, and zkb, are neutral and objective. They aren't shaped by opinion. Don't reply if you dont care but ignoring objective data is pass ignorance it's just plain stupidity.
---
The trick is to make isk basically worthless by killing the game for real players.  Then botters will move on to another game.
---
looking at zkill, he either tried to leave the corp with all his stuff, or ( more likely) it was a heist and he stole all that stuff and got caught by lucky 3rd party ;) 
---
TLDR: karma
---
wait are you for real here our subject is on risk adverse pvpers and in my opening statement i also talked about cloaked ships and being able to find them so yes it is part of this subject nice try.
---
also i could fit up a pvp bomber for less them most pve ships so don't give me that bullshit about cost
---
nice try with the risk shouldn't count for pvp rewards. you i'm sure you are one of the risk adverse pvp players wants everything for their way of playing.
---
You're an absolute fucking treasure, Squishy.
---
Apparently the notion that there might be circumstances that a ship without any defenses could arrive in a system without an easy way to notice it is too much for pvp players to handle. 
---
Also since nearly all JF loss happen in low/high... you've got local to notice they arrived. 
---
Naturally since there's even LESS people in null, less people playing and far less PVE people that post here; it seemed only natural that the PVPer outrage won over the PVE logistics man
---
I'm just glad I've resolved to no longer pay for the game since months ago.
---
&gt; Please understand - I live in Delve.
---
I understand that you then will not be able to jump your cap directly in a fight on a gate and I think this is a good solution.
---
Welcome to EVE!! This is just the beginning. You will lose thousands of ships over the life time of the game. Just make sure you are having fun doing it and try to morn less about the losses.
---
Might have been your view that triggered a popularity flag on the video making it show on others front page.
---
It is easy to say to the prey to HTFU and do this and that who requires hours of work, when you aren't the one doing it. Would you accept to gatecamp shockpoints for hours so that you can protect the fun of the others, like it was in 2008 and earlier ?Yes, absolute fun indeed.
---
Bait them ? Well, why not... The industrial cyno will permit it.
---
Still, while the defenders have lost a great amount of intel, the hunters kept it. Just open the map or Dotlan, and select some filters to find out a potential juicy location. To make things better, CCP should equilibrate the situation by removing/delaying this kind of intel, but they should have done it at the same time than the Blackout. It would have avoided some departures. But as I don't expect it to happen anyway, I understand the players who left as they are criticized by assho\*\*\*/CCP and asked to HTFU while life was made easier for the hunters... They won't come back.
---
Whenever I start wondering why CCP isn't changing something, I always figured it was due to their personal Gordian Knot: the legacy code. I believe there was an incident where changing something *entirely unrelated* to the POS code somehow ended up breaking POS' anyway, so they're being extra-careful about every change they make until u/CCP_Masterplan can finally [sail it out into the harbor and purge it with fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7bg2r8/correct_me_if_im_wrong/dpi1dec/).
---
easy isk/hr? 60m per hour with ishtar is easy and good ISK? really? good ISK are only supers or titan ratting. with any subcap incursion/abyss/L4 blitzing in hi sec is much more profitable...  
---
moon minerals? they are heavily taxed by aliances and chunks spawn only in certain time...  
---
escalation - well maybe, but you need many hours of usual ratting to get any escalation.... again not worth with subcaps with actual null risks...  
---
I lived in lowsec many years, there are much more things to do to get more ISK than so fu boring belt ratting...  
---
gas? there are just few gas systems and only few drugs are worth and used now...  
---
explo is one of most boring things in game...
---
I agree with that. EvE is a complex game, and any simplistic little shooter released beside it is going to look like a gimmick
---
Ship balance is a bit of a different beast though, that's just adjusting figures in a database for the most part.
---
I think it's more not liking teleporting.
---
Yeah, that's pretty shit fit.
---
Yes, but blackout brought on that economic pressure. It is no longer 100% safe to rat with a bot. If you bot with 10 chars, and lose 1 ship per day per char, you have to resupply your bots with 1 jf load each 2 days. The fuel + time + dedication is too great for passive income. The opportunity cost to bot for anothet game is now too high.
---
So what? You can't warp at all when your NSA is running?
---
After the initial ree I was kinda looking forward to using bombers as my jf chain just wasn't looking forward to the cost of making it happen.
---
Hilmar, stop making duplicate accounts
---
Can warp or jump when nsa is active. At the moment it just says 100 point scram strength on the mod. The mod itself I believe doesnt say you cant warp or jump with it active so they're probably adding that as a tool tip.
---
Yea and with damps/paints carriers are still a good support ship
---
Also if CCP removes a skill for whatever reason, shillings are refunded.
---
i dont know if its your voice, face, top, or cadence, but this is the first PI video i could actually sit through. i now feel *way* less intimidated in creating a PI setup. thanks man
---
Logistics in cyno jammed regions would be so easy then. Maybe too easy?
---
Spider tanked Domi fleets were emergent gameplay
---
They advertised the last weekend plenty. Did you read the article that was linked in the launcher? It clearly listed which weekends would have claimable SP.
---
Orthrus still does many things wrong. Same with garmur. Kitey bastards.
---
Yeah I thought it might have been a SOTA haha was a while ago now couldn't remember but we got obliterated like a sledgehammer for a mouse. Really appreciated the mail though for sure
---
The insane part is doing tweaks to hulls or even fucking tiericide is a goddamn joke as far as roughing out some numbers.
---
This is shit that other games rapidly iterate on, often times on a scale of weeks.
---
CCP lets shit like this rot for years.
---
&gt; shit fit, really scumbag? https://zkillboard.com/kill/76730744/
---
lol yeah that´s pretty garbage lmao
---
Huh? Explain how me not caring about the war between krabs and hunters is grr gons
---
Funny 2 years ago everyone was crying that the Proteus was to strong. CCP allegedly does nothing though to address ship balance...I wonder what happened between now and then.
---
The kiki and drek are pretty oppressive. The leshak is really good too but it suffers from the same problems that all BS do.
---
Yeah hmm almost like they nerfed it into uselessness and left it there for two years
---
Sort of like that's my entire point
---
Yup! That's how I ended up with a FAX with large rigs.
---
I'm looking to set up some P3 production and could use some advice (since you seem to know what you're talking about). 
---
My plan was to have 5 planets, 1 making each P1 required for the process then I'd move the P1 to a factory planet which makes P2 and then P3. I live in a wh with 0% tax.
---
I'm trying to figure out if making P2 on the same planet would be more efficient but I think I'm gimping my max production capacity if I do.
---
Almost like its because they have 10K nerds all bitching about different things being imbalanced.  
---
Fun fact there is no such thing as balance. Something will ALWAYS be the best option and something will ALWAYS be the worst option.
---
Unless you just want everything to be the same shit in a different skin and different name.
---
He's not wrong though, is he
---
Big whoop. It was the best T3C for like half a decade. 
---
Something will always be the best.
---
Something will always be the worst.
---
Balance is nonexistant in a situation where there are dozens of dynamically different options across a multitude of varying roles to fill. Thats just reality.
---
You know what also used to suck donkey nuts...the ferox. Now it doesnt.
---
The best CCP can do is break the mold every couple years make some ships better and make some worse...the the game go on then repeat.
---
If you want perfect balance...then you should stop playing video games or really any game for that matter because perfect balance does not exist.
---
Nah, they just collect null in goons and test.
---
By "all", you mean also the T1/Meta items ?
---
There are certainly some corps who has a buyback program like that, but it clearly requires IT competencies to be efficient. Parsing the copy/paste of the user, define the price...
---
My corp has a buyback program, but limited to the classics. Ore/Ice/Goo/Salvage/Planetary. Through a Google Spreadsheet that the users can access to get the price that the corporation will pay and make the contract. The price will be checked by the officers in charge of this program. Low tech, but easier to create and maintain.
---
Kikimora
---
so its basically not worth the power of running an eve client all day?
---
You're like the sixteenth idiot today that I've had to explain to that I don't want or expect "perfect balance", I'm asking for them to "break the mold" (as you put it) with more frequency.
---
Holy fuck you guys are dense.
---
Yeah, tech 2 ships being worse tha pirate
---
No shit. They could balance like WoW so every class that fills a role is basically a carbon copy of each other with a different name.
---
I've given them plenty of money. If you actually read what I said, the problem isn't Alpha vs Omega - it's that old, maxed Alphas get more benefit than new ones.
---
Is that Templeman?
---
Let's put it this way. You can have over 5mil SP when you use Alpha Injectors when you already have 5mil SP. But if you use the injectors prior to reaching 5mil, they actually don't take you past 5mil. So you get more benefit by using them at 5mil than prior to that.
---
I read the original articles when the "Season of Skills" started. The launcher article wasn't there for me prior to downtime on the Friday when the weekend started. Also on their FB they mentioned the weekend only after it had been going for a while already.
---
Dude. I loved your Lif in that fight! There was a point, I think the 3rd time we went for you, that the ONLY reason I wanted you to go down was so that I could steal your fit. Gf mate!
---
Fuck that.
---
It takes months for the META to settle after changes. It takes months after that to stockpile into that META. It takes months for a group as a whole to get comfortable flying in that META.
---
Id say CCP should slow down on mass iteration to balance tbh. Thankfully they have for a while there they were making change for change sake every few months and what happened?
---
Nothing thats right because the players couldnt get comfortable in the META before it changed.
---
Its funny you mention other games...when shit like WoW or FF14 and other MMOs of the like only shake up shit with new expansions which are every 2 to 3 years.
---
2009/2010 was when I started.
---
Ship balance is in a MUCH better place than it used to be, even with power creep (Trig garbage).
---
Caps are what really need attention right now.
---
&gt;it's not something other games seem to suffer much from.
---
You don't play other MMOs much huh
---
&gt;You're the first person in 150+ comments to suggest the Proteus is anything but complete garbage, so I think you might just be a moron.
---
&gt;2009/2010 was when I started.
---
I started summer 2007, we measuring dicks now?
---
Why are you capitalizing "meta", do you think it's an acronym or something?
---
&gt;Spoiled asshole
---
I don't see how he's spoiled, even if I disagree with his points. 
---
&gt;while they provide you a service for free right?
---
The "service for free" is literally only enabled to generate more profit? They're doing it to make money, not as a favour to us, however they dress it up.
---
If you want to learn the trade secrets you should join a corp that does that.
---
Astero&gt;Stratios&gt;Legion. Alt can be a bunch of things, covops, buzzard, t3, just depends on what you want to do
---
&gt; easy isk/hr? 60m per hour with ishtar is easy and good ISK? really?
---
for an always available source of income that basically takes zero investment and doesn´t even require actively playing? yeah, its pretty good.
---
Lmao I so want CCP to nerf cloaked cowardice, the salt here will be glorious.
---
Explo kinda? Pi if you have a shit ton of alts.
---
&gt; \&gt;Era of the Dramiel 
---
Ah those days. When you could go around with 3 Dramiels duo prop fit and no one could do shit to you unless you *wanted* to fight and *if* you wanted to fight, they couldn't do shit without 90% webs, neuts and 10 dps ships.
---
T3C's are pretty good for hunting an provide the key ability to pick and choose which fights you want to take. Your best bet for your alt is to scout in a sabre or ceptor so you can  hold down any targets you can find.
---
Okay so what you're telling me is that you're a little idiot who doesn't remember how horribly unbalanced ships used to be back in the olden days?
---
aNyOnE WhO MuLtIbOxEs pVe iS A BoT
---
Most of what you've posted here is flat-out wrong. Very little thought put into this post. 2/10
---
Same, the only thing that keeps me logging on was my friends, If it werent for the friendships i've made over the years i would be long gone. Eve has been very "meh" for me since Fozzy sov. Chaos was just what got me to let all my accounts but my main go alpha.
---
Where are my testicles, Summer?
---
They were removed, where had they gone?
---
Nothing wrong with teaching the other kiddies important life lessons in a space with no real-world consequences.
---
Funny, but untrue.  I don't mine in any ship, nor do I rat.
---
Rookie ships are slower than shuttles or just going in your pod though...
---
Preloading is ganking on grid so that concord is already spawned if another gank occurs.  Pulling concord is the opposite, allowing a gank to take place.
---
You seem angered.
---
show me you pve losses or shut up ;-)
---
So just to sum up in case I was being unclear:  
---
\- if you gain unallocated SP by any means, whether event rewards on injectors, prior to having the character at 5mil SP, that unallocated SP can't take you beyond 5mil because your training stops at  
---
\- if you gain unallocated SP by any means, whether event rewards on injectors, when you already have 5mil SP, you can use it go past 5mil SP, giving you an advantage over the above situation
---
something "always being the best option" doesnt mean the correct answer is "eh, fuck it, make this wildly overpowered and leave it alone for 2 years, that's fine".
---
like, to borrow from another MMO - right now in FFXIV, black mages are so blatantly overpowered that despite the game explicitly rewarding you for having one of each role, bringing 2 black mages is still better by 1 or 2%. the devs are aware of this, and everyone knows it'll be brought back in line with the next patch that's releasing at the start of october. if you want to play a dancer, the current worst class, that's fine, your group's only missing 1 or 2% damage compared to the average. no big deal, no one but speedrun groups care. they're also probably getting buffed in that same patch.
---
that's fine. you can't get balance perfect, and it's getting fixed soon.
---
with CCP balance, we see some ships get launched to 500% better than every other option, and some choices that are so blatantly bad they might as well just self destruct once you click undock, *and it stays that way for over a year*. when's the last time the widow was viable? the arbitrator? the deimos? the *eris*, jesus christ? inversely, when's the last time the sabre was bad? the guardian? the sleipnir?
---
that is not ok. due to how impossibly bad the balancing in this game is, there's really only 10 or so viable ships. it's Not Good At All.
---
Always make P2, for your own sanity, it cuts down the volume you have to move by 4x. Say you spend 30 minutes shuffling stuff around whenever your storage gets full, you might have to do that once every 3-4 days rather than once every two weeks.
---
Furthermore, each ECU can only have 10 nodes max, which means that on a level 4 CC, you need 2 ECU's to fill up your powergrid anyways, might as well do 2 different materials and make P2's.
---
Depending on your scale, you might not need dedicated factory planets at all. It takes 4-6 advanced factories producing P2's to feed 1 factory producing P3. Which in my case is 2 planets with 4 basic 2 advanced industry each, feeding into 1 advanced factory producing P3. So all you need to make P3 is to squeeze a couple advanced factories on a planet that is rich in P0's so you can drop a couple extractors and still produce 12000 per hour from each extractor to sustain 2 advanced factories producing P2's.
---
Dominion Sov was fun to me.....if you said in 2013 that Sov warfare would be replaced by the system for faction warfare you would have been laughed at. IMO CCP came up with the laziest "fix" to a problem only a couple people were bitching about, Same thing in the Chaos era...laziest fix to a problem that only a couple people complained about.
---
gila fit and abyss in hi sec is much  less skill intensive and much more ISK/hr
---
&gt;Quegyboe
---
Then why does it say it has scram strength when it doesn't stop you? What's the point? I'm confused.
---
I just realized auto correct changed can't to can so that's my bad.
---
I missed replying earlier... but basically give nothing but player based intel. Spies, scouts, cloaky campers, intel channels for hunters (is there such a thing? I imagine if there were it would be very private) 
---
Then make adjustments where needed. If you see a massive decline in ships killed in regions where PVE activities are still high then turn something back on - or maybe turn it on with a delay. If you see a massive spike in ships killed, and PVE activities cease or greatly decline in those same regions... do something the other way, but don't stop tuning the game. 
---
What i'm getting at eve is a player-driven sandbox, yet some of the best hunting tools in the game are no more fair/unfair than intel apps like NEAR2. They're just pulling data from behind the scenes, compiling it, and spoon feeding it to us.
---
I do have a prediction as to what would happen if they did that, and that would be more consolidation of null sec into the hyper-coalitions. "The more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers" - Leia
---
The bots will never go away, they'll just adapt, just like the rest of the human players, only they have a real world monetary incentive to adapt where players are only playing for fun. 
---
I am the last person to make suggestions about how to fix the game, as I don't do the small gang PVP stuff that's got the biggest problem with finding content. I'm in Horde, and I just enjoy the hell out of massive brawls against Goons, Test, Snuff, whomever... doesn't matter. All that matters is in the end we all had fun. I have no animosity towards anyone, any alliance, nothing. &lt;3 for everyone in Eve that brings the good fight to our doorstep, or that responds when we roam to yours.
---
Well I'm glad PL is getting back up on it's feet.
---
No? Just because things were worse doesn't mean they can't be better
---
"Oh, players are a little too dominant with the dual-prop Taranis? Well check out this round of updates we did to the pirate faction frigates"
---
Conglaturations
---
That’s some big talk... calling people krabs, noobs and HTFU... everyone needs isk ... I think credit card warriors need to seek counseling or have life priorities ... they are rl losers that need to buy isk to buy a T3C to stroke their loser ego killing a myrmidon... LOL PA target audience now... anyways unless your some PL/VOLTA leet FC... just STFU

playing eve echoes at work has made me want to get back into eve again but just be a shitty highsec pve/industry nerd should i do it c/d
---
And where did I say that, little idiot?
---
\&gt;  Bait them ? Well, why not... The industrial cyno will permit it.   
---
A cyno is not the only way to bait people. With blackout you could have 100 recons cloaked next to your precious, boring activity, and the hunter would be toast. Buddy, you're just not thinking about how to play this game in new ways.
---
Guide videos don't need a face on them. Remove it. What purpose does seeing you provide to the person looking for the guide?
---
However unless you know where they all warp to and can sufficiently bubble it, they will all warp off once you tackle one of them. 
---
It ends up being a lot of effort to kill a single Myrmidon
---
Think I was in this fight, was great scrap and great bombs
---
this, but unironically
---
Nobody cares about your kill stats ever
---
I wish that ISK faucets in null-sec were more like occasional geysers than what they are now. Maybe anoms don't instantly spawn and are more rare, but they give many many many times most ISK than the present rate. 
---
Kinda the same way the DED sites are with loot, we need something similar with ISK, and also maybe something similar with ore.
---
Shh, dont you words with two syllables, youll confuse him.
---
Increasing isk/hour and decreasing total isk/región would solve a lot of problems tbh
---
Feroxes get annihilated by bombers. They get applied to really well by torps and can't track bombers for shit. That's without bombs.
---
How not to fly a jackdaw fleet
---
Ill sit down and look at my plan, will see what i can come up with
---
&gt;little idiot
---
PL? Is that FRTs toasting corp? I think I've seen them around.
---
By all items, I meant ALL items. I'm mainly looking for implants though. I've seen a buyback system where anything that can't be hauled properly (battleships and such) are reprocessed at the buyback station. It gives you the isk of the materials after a cut has been taken off.
---
There's no doubt that bots are dying more than before and have had to step down to lower isk/hr activities.
---
Alliance of ex-cons
---
There was a lot of nuance in the opinions offered. Many were sayign that it would deal a blow to bots, not eradicate them.
---
Reasonable evidence providing probable cause.
---
That many ships, exactly the same, behaving with such a specific swarm mentality and adhering so closely to it is reasonable to conclude they may be bots. Which is worth investigating, as there is probable cause.
---
The risk with jump freighters is their cost + having to move through high sec, you can’t cyno jump once you hit high so you’re stuck gating the rest of the way, which means ganks, and considering the price of a jump freighter even the killmail alone might be enough to motivate gankers. There’s your risk, sorry it’s not trying to carrier rat in enemy space risky for ya.
---
I'm one of the few that thinks a carrier group, once at enough mass that you don't lose half of your fighters on the way to the destination, is a good answer to these. Will they stay on grid to dps carriers when they are losing a bomber per carrier every 10s? Probably not.
---
You would be gimping your production. While setup above is valid as very lazy one, it's far from efficient. As long as you don't mind hauling stuff every 3 days, dedicated P1 planets plus factory world work great. Right now I'm running 2 fully laden factory worlds making all the components for nanite paste in right proportions in WH, perfect for WH logistics.
---
That's exactly the point of bombers. There needs to be distinction in ships.
---
Indeed it is reasonable to conclude they "may" be bot. What's more, if there are bots, it seems more likely those are than another random player. So yes this is worth investigating.
---
But there is a gap between noting something is worth investigating, and providing conclusion to that investigation before it ever happened.
---
correct, fuck rorquals
---
It is possible to run T3s with 2 retributions, and T4s with 3 if you are good using 500m isk fits.
---
Great video though!
---
ErA oF cHaOs

Incentive to sprawl and high enough rewards that the bears are happy to get out from under the umbrella.

That is a very fabulous dramiel there
---
Also you can build ships the same way.  You need planetary goods to build any ships.
---
I don't think comparing a video game to real combat based auditory and sensory based exclusion is really comparable... at all.
---
Press F8 to ~~activate cyno~~ pay respect
---
&gt; fixing broken things doesnt sell expansions, new content does so nope.
---
Which is funny because they lose players because of shit like this. I left because they never iterate and their balancing has been half-assed or straight-up terrible since forever. Finally got sick of it and sold all my characters.
---
i have a small penis too can i get a snickers pls
---
Can i have some of the stuff you're smoking?
---
Fortunately for me, I'd rather play *nothing* than give them money for their utter lack of effort.
---
A lot of work went into this, very well done Sir. o7
---
I don’t recall reading anyone saying that. People said it would have an affect and it did. 
---
I do recall a lot of the serial posters here saying they were quitting but alas that doesn’t seem to have materialised
---
yeah i cant see any way around it.
---
I don't mind moving shit every few days.
---
&gt; they’ll prob rebalance as no pressure to do the next big thing
---
Dude. They've had 16 years to figure out how to do effective balance passes and iteration. They still haven't. I wouldn't hold my breath no matter how little pressure there is.
---
i dont think pearl abyss paid out 425mil for a game that has offline servers

HILMAR ACCEPTS YOUR CHALLENGE
---
gz dude!
---
Just simulatee it, 30 more dps with 3 faction heavies compared to 5 faction mediums. Then add in using 2 heavy, 2 medium, and a light, and its even better. With imperfect skills and 3 DDA using faction amarr drones, I'm looking at 390 dps. Not terrible really.
---
Yeah, probably only worth it if you finish playing for the day in that system by chance.
---
yis
---
Even if older players are plexing, their demand for plexes are what keeps newer players buying them.

AAR: Legacy forms a Muninn fleet for an i-hub timer in Detorid. Early on, it was clear that FRT would not form a formal fleet to contest. After placing a new i-hub, Legacy heads back to our staging to reship into goku.
---
Our friends have eyes on a Goon Wyvern ratting at a site. Shortly after engaging the super, an initial wave of capitals and supers land on grid. After taking down a few sieged capitals, we boosh off to focus on fighters.
---
Capitals are still streaming in and a couple bounce. None of those that bounced were tackled so as we tried to focus them, they simply warped off. One Hel, warped to a POCO and is followed by tackle. We warp off to this Hel who opens a cyno to bring in FAX support. This is also when a harpy fleet of roughly 60 shows up. The harpy fleet engages a disengages a several times, we are either forcing them off with bombs are simply "brawling" with them.
---
Meanwhile, the caps on the Wyvern grid are attempting to extract however, a few of them are still tackled. We head back to that grid where more FAX are landing on grid. At this point, there is not much hostile DPS left on the grid so we are able to focus on FAX. On this grid, we had one excellent bombing run on the sub-cap fleet. They reship fairly rapidly and once they arrive again, we extract.
---
Thank you Goons for playing with us! Big props to the guys that got eyes on the initial target and that Lif that was tanking 130+ bombers like a champ.
---
We spent over 50 mins on the field, sorry I decided to speed it up a lot more than I would like.
---
Wow! this is very nice!
---
I'm not sure if this is a shit post or somehow a really good shitpost, im leaning to the former but not sure
---
Oh so the little idiot can't point out where I said it? I didn't think so.
---
So?
---
I never claimed you did? I just said that just because something used to be bad doesn't mean it can't improve, so it's pretty stupid to point out that it was worse in the past.
---
Again,
---
lmao
---
You mean no medium risk high reward isn't enough?
---
Who would win, 21 capital-sized logi or some bomby bois
---
Active fit gila with no missiles? And willing to talk mad shit about it? Good lord.
---
Wow and here I was thinking they were a division of the red cross....
---
So dont use your injectors until you hit the wall. What your post reads as is you bitching your one set of free shit takes planning and effort to maximize with your other free shit
---
Since he streams, this is his exact setup for recording.  Why should he bother changing it to suit a very small subset of people who focus on irrelevant details rather than the message he communicated.
---
But then in many cases, it would just be better to take out the mediums as they have better tracking and speed. But yeah, you still do get a bit more dps with the heavies
---
And a lot less afk
---
Good on ya for making the vid my dude.  Keep up the good work and the gfs in abyssal.  o7
---
Why thank you :D glad to hear it helped!!
---
Hey bud, I've been flying a lot of manticore lately. It depends what you're after and where you're after it. If you're hunting explorers multiple scrams MSE and an MWD with rockets for damage is a good start. If you're going after ratters in nullsec it can be helpful to have a bomb launcher for the initial alpha damage before you point them and finish them with torps. You really have to know what you're after when you fit the ship.
---
We had 3 years of high reward low risk now we've got high risk medium-low reward let's not have 3 years of that. CCP tends to not see these problems and fix them before we get umbrellas and people quiting
---
Which is exactly what's going to happen with the new cyno changes
---
FuN aNd EnGaGiNg gAmEpLaY
---
Got it, thank you! Yeah, there are a TON of modules that you'd only use if you happened to have it in the hangar.
---
Well edited video. Nice work.
---
I agree, which is why i offered the mixed size layout which also is better dps than just 3 heavies. And given the 50% bonus to drone tracking speed, heavies still track fairly well on the VNI. A single scripted omni and I'd say they could track most stuff pretty easy.
---
hahahahaha  i will hahah
---
Having alpha accounts puts my omega accounts at unequal positions. I have to pay. CCPlease fix
---
IIRC, the easiest work around atm is to just have a DST on field.  It will receive PANIC from rorqual and can light a cyno that can be bridged to, bringing the recon that will bring the hammer.
---
People are blowing this way out of proportion.
---
depends i enjoy my time playing eve with my friends
---
You could only jump blopses to indu cyno afaik, so you would have to indu cyno -&gt; bridge in blops -&gt; light blops cyno -&gt; bring in other shit.
---
For me it’s a low-stress way of enjoying the game. I am making a collection of pve ships I like. Some people just don’t find pvp fun tbh.
---
The blackout and the whole chaos era is NOTHING like what CCP has ever done. It's a welcomed change of pace in my opinion. As for intel just favoring the hunter, perhaps but it's very delayed... 30 mins to an hour for dotlan as I don't use the in-game map. And well... you have access to the same intel. So it benefits both parties. Hunters also have to deal with regional intel channels and from where I sit they are almost always seen and reported well in advance. Wormholes are really the only element of surprise and it should be that way. 
---
It's all not perfect but I'm okay with it. I'm well aware this isn't nearly the end product. It never will be. But I'm enjoying it... so there's that.
---
LOL

easter-egg, celebrating 20 000 kill

https://zkillboard.com/ship/17932/topalltime/
---
It’s expensive but a rattlesnake works well for level 4 stuff. I use a Barghest and micro jump to 150 km and snipe ships. Pirate battleships work really well. T1 battleships can work. Missiles definitely work best.
---
It can bridge t3c to respond
---
Black ops battleship bridges in the recon.
---
so you mean a blockade runner with covert cyno not dst?
---
If you have enjoued your time playing, it s not waste time it was a good used of your time ;)
---
If you didnt or dont like it; why are you still here and playing?
---
Simple ;)
---
This is the correct response. The cyno changes only really affect smaller fleets, large nullsec alliances can very easily bring heavily reinforcements to a grid though it may mean a warp or two of sacrificing an SRPd recon.
---
Far too many people are losing their shit over this change.
---
Blops can jump/bridge to indy cynos as well unless they changed since earlier?
---
they can jump, didnt know they could bridge. Would be retarded tho lol, just get like a 500k ehp dst then gg
---
I will test it when it is live with my corp
---
Bombers can definitely still be used for solo PVP, but they've largely been replaced by Asteros which can handle more situations well, and is all around more versatile
---
&gt; Increasing isk/hour and decreasing total isk/región
---
this is a real good way of putting it that my slow brain couldn't articulate
---
any chance you could share a good Scy-Fi fit?
---
Jesus, those Harpies could not stay on grid with bombs going at them every time they landed
---
That was v cool to watch
---
Gonna be interesting to see stats on how these numbers go up:
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/28/losses/lowsec/
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/28/losses/nullsec/
---
Problem with this is, then the bots will be hogging all the sites from the actual people.
---
&gt; I don’t recall reading anyone saying that. 
---
You must have an uncannily selective memory. I spent more time than I care to admit to arguing with people who absolutely believed removing local would make botting impossible. I did everything short of coding a "proof of concept" bot to show them how wrong they were, and they still stubbornly kept beliebing.
---
&gt; I do recall a lot of the serial posters here saying they were quitting but alas that doesn’t seem to have materialised 
---
Selective memory indeed. What most of us actually said is that we were going to *unsub* accounts. - A lot of people seem to have a very difficult time understanding the differences between those things.
---
Just to clarify, I'll (once again) explain how subscriptions work. We are *subscribing* to automated payments for game time when our time runs out. So we don't have to manually add it. - Two things to note there:
---
1. Unsubbing doesn't mean you are out of the game immediately. It just means that when your game time is up, you will go alpha automatically.
---
2. People who subscribe in that manner tend to do it in long periods, as that offers discounts. So the period between unsubbing and actually going alpha can be months, up to a year.
---
3. (For extra points) The only people who can really tell how many accounts were unsubbed is CCP. As you should be able to infer from the above, unsubs won't necessarily show up in things like the number of players online, as *they haven't necessarily run out of play time yet.*
---
Personally, when the blackout hit, I unsubbed 4 of my alt accounts. Not because I thought CCP would care, I just didn't have any use for ratting and mining alts anymore. - Most of them have run out of game time since then, but my main was on a 6 month sub and still had like 4 months left. We are only 2 months into this shitstorm, so plenty of time left.
---
I'm sure as hell not going to stop playing until then, at least. Already paid for it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Good - hopefully the real people eliminate the bots when they get starved for isk
---
obviously in OPs case they werent actually being chased, but 
---
&gt;who cares about 3 frigates
---
isnt the reason why , because people will absolutly drop caps on single t1 frigates
---
Forever? No.
---
Still takes them an Eternaty and a Half to fix stuff? Yes.
---
I'm just annoyed because now I have to make a fucking journey in a T3 cloaky to seed my cyno route.  Rather than being able to preseed them with the hulls that I've already preseeded.
---
"Chaos is fair" ;)
---
there really shouldn't be much of a shortage... Every character has at least one industry slot, BPO's will be seeded (probably at the same or similar prices, 31m/bpo) and unless they vastly amp up the skills for this specific cyno, it'll take just industry I like the regular/covert cyno.
---
If you need these ASAP on release day,there's zero reason not to just   put a tiny bit of minerals (covert cyno is 273m³, regular cyno 214m³) in a few places with build capability so that you can interceptor in the bpo and build what you need on day 1.
---
I love pushx you guys are amazing
---
Thanks, some great food for thought, I will go for a T1 battleship at present, then build my skills towards pirate/faction or T2, in the future
---
&gt; Far too many people are losing their shit over this change.
---
It means people who get left behind on deployment quit the game for good, or if your alliance lost a war and moved.
---
Supposed you work a profession where you might get called up on relatively short notice and can't play the game for a while, or work just gets really busy. Being in the military is a common example. You come back and your alliance has moved or the deployment is finished and you miss the move op. It's going to cost a couple billion in just cyno ships for you to rejoin your alliance. You also need to source those cyno ships, since a packed recon is 10,000 m3.
---
I wouldn't have resubbed if the only way I could get value out of my stuff was trying to firesale in deserted lowsec and starting over with whatever liquid isk I had.
---
Or you could just have a cloaked recon sitting above your rorq waiting for hostiles to show up.
---
There is a different between the AFK you mean and the AFK we highsec miners like.
---
I have 3 monitors and like to mine when i read something on the internet or watch a show. Thus i can make some ISK and still mostly concentrate on whatever else i do.
---
Could be a good option, I am a wee bit off T2 sentries, but rest of my drone skills are pretty good, so could certainly give it a try. Not the biggest fan of the Dominix's look though. I remember it got a reskin when I was playing last, and some of the new colours look cool
---
Ok thanks for the info. I can probably make my own knowing this.
---
It serves it's purposes for coping with the dysfunction that surrounds us. Maybe one day we'll have the means to escape it, but until then there's eve.
---
Yes, but that being true would mean that the prevailing attitude of /r/eve is wrong and bad for the game, so it clearly can't be that. 
---
Something something grr goons (because that's what it really boils down to).

I use a wen when I fly it solo, although in a gang I usually switch it for a capacitor booster. It's pretty basic and nothing too special, but it is fun to fly. The ScyFi has amazing base stats for speed and agility, and I like how you aren't penalized for damage variation like the OsNI (don't get me wrong, the Osprey Navy is still an amazing ship and I also love flying it).
---
Hey man that’s awesome! I’ve been playing the game for a long time and I’m going to be doing just this cause I feel like my manual piloting needs work. If you need some isk for more ships I’ll gladly donate!
---
This is good stuff.
---
People over look stuff like this but it teaches you so much.
---
LMFAO, risk with moving thru HS!?  You can get over 1mil ehp along with being insta warp (3 webs or 1 90%web) the next gate. The only real risk is in lowsec going to high sec gate as you have a chance of being bumped before you jump. Other than that, its risk adverse gameplay that shouldn’t be in the game. 
---
It’s funny how people try to justify risk in a JF. Yet I survived super ganking, code ganks, even f’ed up an accidently jumped from hs to a lowsec gatecamp. Thing is still alive, in the hands of a knowledgeable player or worst a risk adverse player. Its broken and needs to be removed.
---
You mean less accounts are logged in both from botting and multiboxing which might as well be the same shit or actually less of actual people playing ?
---
Cause from what I saw a lot of actual players came back, more then multibox farm owners dropped.

EVE Online: The Butterfly Effect
---
You literally said 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; So you think it's good for the game that a rookie ship could defang a supercarrier?
---
You are being **intentially naive** to bait people into a stupid arguments. Why would you do this? /u/sedimechra and I have given you logical arguments for why capital ships should not be the answer for every engagement. Now it is up to you to decide how to take this information.
---
Very nicely done!
---
I’m so excited for the new meta. I told our dudes in fleet today, this will be the last moon we mine with cynos on every Rorqual. I’ve got 14 new Recon hulls. This is gonna be great.
---
Good work man. It's a steep curve at first but once you get the hang of it, it's great! Don't have to rely on others to make your content!
---
U mommy sucker.i dont wanna speaking shits.我屌你老母
---
I don't give CCP money anymore. If enough people do that. They'll hear you loud and clear.
---
&gt; The cyno changes only really affect smaller fleets
---
Nice! We've been talking for years about how we love the blue donut. This will fix it. Right /r/eve? Right?
---
The shot at 4:45 with the comms is too good, it's practically like a trailer
---
Lol you havent played FF14 have you?
---
Nice video. With a little bit more editing this could be a masterpiece.
---
It is an acronym dipshit.
---
MOST EFFECTIVE TACTIC AVAILABLE.
---
Currently peak time player counts are down 10k from where they were in may/june, if you honestly think that 30% of the player base was bots being chased away by blackout, you might want to have a psych eval scheduled.
---
That is definitely a backronym dude. "Meta" is shorthand for "metagame", from the [Greek prefix "meta"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta) meaning "beyond".
---
what if tons of people make false reports  about ccp frauds?
---
Lol. No.
---
META
---
And meta-
---
Are not the same thing.
---
Its why I capitalized it. You literal fucking retard.
---
Were going to start seeing sensor boosted dreads that are on grid for the solo purpose of alphang any cyno ships that even think about lighting
---
Its like you've never been in actual nullsec combat where people bridge their subcap fleets into system...
---
Yea LR dreads will volley a cyno before anything worthwhile jumps in
---
Whatever dude, enjoy your stupid unnecessary backronyms.
---
I suspect the reason you enjoy a "comfortable" meta because you're too idiotic to come up with your own fits or adapt to a changing meta, so you have to wait for other people to figure it out for you. Does that sound about right?
---
With bots, you increase your hours, not your isk.
---
Did someone kill you with station guns when you tried to gank a cyno on a citadel?
---
Guess what, you can still do that!!!
---
You're assuming he enjoyed the time he spent.
---
or worse it will jump but wind up somewhere random and the defender get an easy feed that ends a fight because :chaos:
---
Ship aesthetic design in this looks better.
---
Bots cant safe up if you blow up all their stations.
---
Yea odds are a few guys would get in but they’d get deleted by the defender’s super fleet
---
Im pretty sure the random table flipping that Himler has been doing, just solidified the blue donut harder than ever :(
---
[&lt;3](https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/snickers.jpg?quality=90&amp;w=600)
---
Does that matter when the recon is still the weak link?  Whats the effective difference between a recon decloaking vs a DST lighting an industry cyno for a recon to bridge in?  If the recon dies another one can be bridged in, sure, but you’re down a recon either way.  Roaming gang calls op success and takes off, they got a 300m kill.
---
*Proceeds to ignore chaos and do what he wants anyway*
---
I am sure CCP is loving these lower player base numbers.  Until they do something about bombers  combined with Chloe camping giving 24/7 eyes expect to see further declines in the null player base particularly multi-account setups
---
Allow me to elaborate so your pea brain understands.
---
META in the context of the game is forming the most efficient and effective strategy that provides you the greatest opportunity for success. A.K.A Most Effective Tactic Available.
---
I.e. Ferox Fleets are META because the can hold a grid at many ranges while boasting an efficient survivability against a wide array of opposition and have the ability to bug out if needed.
---
Metagaming is stuff that happens outside the game its self. The Propaganda. The news site spin. The narratives. The call outs. The Yacht Parties. 
---
I.e. The Mittani climbed on his spinmaster again with a post to INN decrying the MBC as nothing more than Casino Money summer children.
---
Meta means beyond. Metagaming means beyond gaming.
---
META is not the same thing.
---
A ship can be META. A INN news store can be Meta(gaming).
---
Get it, moron?
---
It was "Stagnant" because they couldn't drop gangs of bombers on unsuspecting targets and moonwalk out before help arrived.
---
you're like that little furry rat thing in star wars that jabba keeps around, you aren't good for anything but making little obnoxious noises that add nothing to the story.
---
Then start playing something else. Lots of games on market right now that can pique your interests.
---
Oh I get it, also "metagame" is also used to refer to which ships are in popular use and how they're used. As in:
---
[&gt;Strong, effectively flown frigates are the backbone of any PvP’ing small gang. This is a look at what I think the EVE small gang PvP metagame is in different areas of space.](https://crossingzebras.com/small-gang-tier-list-part-1-frigates/)
---
i literally wrote that entire post while in queue for trials roulette
---
I just fly whatever the fuck I want. Could care less about being FOTM and certainly dont need to waste dev time tweaking a ship I like to be better than others so I can feel good about myself.
---
Oof
---
Hey just FYI it's "**couldn't** care less"
---
Also FYI means "for your information"
---
Also:

Hahaha what the fuck is wrong with you

That would be pretty bad engineering tho. If they would just implement a save game feature, we could live forever!
