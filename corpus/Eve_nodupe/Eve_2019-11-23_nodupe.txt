Do you lose standings for attacking players of the opposite faction while enlisted? I know you do for NPCs
---
---
---
This is an example of buying into the system, you're told when there's war time and peace time. 
---

---
I'll give you an example: I don't have peace mode and war mode, I'm just always looking for a fight, I guess I'm a pirate or raider or whatever you want to call it. Yeah I krab to make some isk, but its to buy some ships and get out there with my buddies and do some damage. It's not always about leading a huge 1000 vs 1000 battle, it could be you and 5 buddies roaming around hunting, or locking systems down with gatecamps, or whatever. 
---
My point is that too many people look at the political narrative of things, and thats boring, you litterally end up paying a subscription to impress others, that sounds not fun at all. Warlording can be done at any size/scale, and if you get kicked from your garbage tier alliance, that's good, as now you have nothing to hold you back from warlording.

remove triglodyte

Trig ships are the strongest sub caps in the game. Two Leshaks is incredibly strong against that fleet, especially spider tanking as they are.
---
How cute and quirky you are.
---
Grrrrrr
---
yeah, I imagine a vindi would do that. Thx for the tip. I may unbox my tengu, hoping the new event will allow them
---
o7 MC, miss you nerds ❤️
---
Is the counter to just not give them a fight unless you have same ship type or more?

Awesome, thank you for the timely delivery.
---
Hmmm I like it.
---
YOU MUST COMPLETE THE GOONS WARM FEDERATION CONTENT REQUEST FORM.
---
  In it you must write a report outlining why you wish to PvP, where you plan to fly. And outline the steps planned to ensure there are no losses.
---
  Any deviation from the requested route will be rigorously investigated.
---
  Failure to comply with mandatory fits and hull types will result in a safari pass. 
---
  Mining quotas not reached due to excessive PvP content will be reimbursed from member wallets.
---
Ooooh, that would be amazing.
---
As a rev pilot, I approve.
---
Yea 3rd web is for the next target, it is pointless on the primary target.
---
I mean.. how it was made still is a bit relevant imo especially for this kind of things. I think that something that requires effort deserves more recognition even if it looks as good or slightly worse than something made easily and quickly
---
Should have tried with a smart bomb. Also fun fact you can bookmark a probe and then warp to the bookmark to get to the probe location.
---
O7 Tall FC.
---
Smartbombs don't work and you definitely can't warp to arbitray places using probes like that
---
Not anymore
---
well wtf they were doing at ansiblex if not gating
---
I wish there was a more active way to gain skills. I like the Skilling spree. I try eve every few years and I always end up giving up because I get to a point where I really want to try a cool turret or ship but itll take a month or so to train 1 of the skills I need for it. 
---
I'm not looking for instant gratification. But it would be nice to be able to do stuff in game to gain skill points
---
These events are the sign of the end times. 
---
Log in and get a reward! Kill some NPCs and get a reward! Free SP for everybody! Just please don't quit! 
---
Heck, even I had to sub just to drain the brain-goo from my characters below 14,000,000. It all goes on the the balance sheet to make the game look more successful than it is.
---
It only took a few years for them to slap the same generic bonus on the fleet issue versions as they did the regular versions during their buff.  Goddamn CCP, you guys are fucking geniuses!  Nobody in history works this fast!
---
But every game subreddit ever is filled with toxic players complaining and it doesn't scare new players (or at least players who are not also new to reddit) because they know it's the norm. Plus EVE forum or youtube videos come up higher in google search for new player advice than reddit. Eve subreddit is quite the niche for the EVE player base because they already have a good forum, contrary to other games.
---
:feelskekman:  
---
And if Sparton is feeding rattles then I'm feeding more Minos
---
Afaik, you cant even target the probes.
---
You could compare your genius idea never thought of before to what steam did with artifact, they trolled (as like on a fishing boat) in many top streamers, Lifecoach, Swim, purge and who not and it was one of the top streamed games for 2 months. It was really deep and complex and niche like eve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvyCqxciozE

Can an alpha account with 20.5 million skillpoints(I heard that this was the cap) train every single possible alpha skill? I know the softcap is 5 mil but if I buy omega, would it be possible for me to max out every alpha skill with the 20.5 million sp, or is it not enough? Would I be able to fly all faction ships on a single character albeit up to tier 1 or whatever the cap is, or would I only have enough for one faction?
---
unpopular indeed
---
As far as i can tell the same thing you do right now: you don't get them.
---
Especially as a small group with a low recruitment rate i can't really see anything else to do about it. During AUTZ prime time in spoopy it's just me and sometimes one other dude. If we recruit someone after a few weeks of just me and the other dude and that third dude what is the third dude probably gonna do? Leave and then were back to square one again.
---
We don't have a lot of AUTZ dudes, so why would or should AUTZ people join us is a better question for you to ask than how to recruit outside your timezone.
---
He's trying to be the very best
---
Wasn't there a plan to rebalance cap and passive shield regen modules to be more interesting than "fit 5+ modules or don't bother"...? I assume they want to do that first.
---
Trying? We did!
---
And ut'll stay that way for now.
---
They engaged on of the handful of groups that aren't blue so they're safe.
---
Well then It's no wonder that the blue donut has only rats to shoot...
---
It was such a fantastic brawl. Both parties not looking at expenses to get the upper hand. 
---
In the end, fighting in front of the fortizar and logistics (capability of putting ships on field) made the fight turning to Test side
---
We were killing Abaddons very fast but Test kept reshipping. 
---
After the fight someone from Test said in local they had 400 prefited abaddons to deploy.
---
Good fight :)
---
Australians do it in the au.

Culture, really. How well you fit in, if you get along with people, so on and so forth. Ask if you can sit in general comms for a little while, just listen to the banter and the chats and see how much you like the people that are there. If you find yourself wanting to join in the conversation and chat then it's probably a good fit. If you feel irritated by the tone of the conversation then it's probably not a good fit. Wait until the leadership is AFK and ask the line members about what they really think, where they think the corp is headed, etc. Leadership and recruiters are going to put a positive spin on everything, line members will give you the straight answer.
---
Don't be afraid to leave a corp after a week or so if it's just not a good fit or if you're just not having a good time. Nobody is going to care about your corp history unless it's longer than a CVS receipt, and anybody that gets on your case for looking around for the best place for you to be probably doesn't have your best interests at heart.
---
In terms of how to filter your search before you get to the recruitment/interview stage, look for mid-size corps in the 10-200 range is my main advice. Smaller corps are generally either struggling to get anywhere or just a tight-knit group of friends that are going to be harder to integrate into, and larger corps often make you feel like you're just another line member. Somewhere in the middle gives you the best bang for your buck IME.
---
As stated elsewhere here, watch out for corps that say they do it all, or corps that don't restrict their activities to two or three to focus on. A corp that says it does everything in reality does nothing, so stay away from those type of corps.
---
If you're going for a null corp, ask who they rent from and look up their rental agreement. Stay away from any corp that rents and has an overly restrictive rental agreement that prohibits them from PvPing without a lot of diplo work. Chances are if you try to do anything fun you'll get kicked, and these corps tend to be pretty un-fun places to be unless you're friends with someone who's already in.
---
Check a prospective corp's Zkill, but don't focus solely on the K/D ratio. What you're looking for is a good and consistent amount of activity and a generally favourable amount of green. It's better to join a corp with a 60% dangerous rating and a dozen mails a day than a corp with a 90% dangerous rating and two mails a day. The former indicates a corp with a laid-back approach to PvP that takes fights and learns from mistakes, the latter likely indicates anal pencil-pushers that focus on KB stats to the exclusion of all other metrics. Remember that PvP is about having fun, not winning. At the same time, don't join a corp with 100+ members if only five of those members actually show up on the list of kills. Reading Zkill stats is an art in and of itself, but you're looking for good, solid activity.
---
And, if you still haven't found what you're looking for, join mcav-public and come fly with us. We're good chaps, generally.
---
yes they would

you do its called goon

yes lets disincentive pvp even more, genius idea!
---
Yeah the widow nerf was super sad, easily one of my favourite ships. Ty!
---
Did you know the rock from moon mining doesn't travel at a linear speed to the athanor/ tatara? You set the time of cycle and the rock moves at a velocity but during down time they "jump" to get back on schedule.
---
Fun fact brought to you by autism.
---
This exact point I don't understand either. The groups that chose inferior supers as their alliance doctrine have been reeing for these implants for years, yet there's no way they come out without big nerfs to current tank. So many people don't even consider this.
---
a few days ago I was running from 130 muninns in Fountain, 1j from Delve after I kept annoying one of their rorquals
---
they never managed to scan my nightmare down
---
bless warpspeed changes
---
superb scanning skills spotted
---
I've gotta ask, what was the reasoning behind the final swell of dreads you brought in? We thought for a hot minute that you planned on bringing in a fresh set of rattles.
---
The main loot they're after are the excavators. Bling is nice ofc but you can't loot excavators with a ceptor
---
yes there are non-optimal solutions to this clearly unbalanced aspect of the game, so therefore my point is invalid   
---
:thinking:  
---
most PVP groups dont have a botting empire to SRP stuff with remember
---
It was a really underestimated blops 
---
Can jam everything needed (if fitted accordingly)
---
The RHML was capable of hitting really hard , even on big target 
---
Drones + utility high for neut
---
REALLY tanky in shield (almost no hole in resist)
---
Lots of mids 
---
Was capable of filling lot of role (torps for supreme dps , cruise for sniping and spanking safely , armor fit for ECMing everything it sees...)
---
Etc etc 
---
It was my favorite blops in almost every gang 
---
(And now I’m crying T_T)
---
gotta whore with somethin!
---
What I like about the Scimitar and Oneiros: you can have both! Also, if you whore with more than one dps drone at a time then you're doing it wrong.
---
Perhaps alliance/corp gate pings should just be a function of having sovereignty and be separate. But that's just another one of my common sense dumb ideas.
---
My favourite was the torp widow with a couple launchers replaced by neuts. At least nowadays you can make it a pretty tanky-dps blops, and the burst jammer still works as it used to. Getting 30 points on a burst jammer was really funny, let you escape multiple tacklers by just jamming and moonwalking out. Still, gone are the days of good targeted jamming :(
---
Dran's not my real dad.
---
We regularly play how low can we go...
---
This is why as Logibro I ALWAYS carry hull drones + drones that rep whatever I don't rep. I also always keep an eye on where the enemy is shooting so half the time I've already fired off my first rep cycle when someone calls for reps. And of course keep all high risk and high priority targets watchlisted: FCs, Anchors, tackle, etc.
---
Solid catches! How do drone regions look these days? Is there enough game or is it scarce?
---
Rise said they'd have to rebalance all shield caps, shield supercaps, and possibly a number of high end shield subcaps.
---
Damnations currently fly with mid grade amulets pretty often, no reason why Vultures and Claymores would not fly with mid grade slaves.
---
In csgo people get banned within a reasonable timeframe before they disrupt the ladder significantly. In eve bots do significant damage to the economy before they are banned. Real players are already at a disadvantage competing with bots. I don't see adding another disadvantage on top of that before solving the problem of the damage that bots cause as a good thing.
---
By all means once the damage bots do is minimal remove it for sure. But also definitely get a handle on that first.
---
I personally think this change is dumb. It further entrenches big blocs into single regions to keep up ADMs (i.e., delve). If it was combined with resource scarcity, it would be fantastic (forcing people to expand but punishing them for not keeping up ADMs). Unfortunately, thats not the case. Idk what CCP is thinking.
---
Yea I agree, I think that planning ahead and setting up a dst to grab the loot would be the smart move here. I don’t think looting while fighting is retarded. It always seems like players will blame anyone but themselves for things that go wrong.
---
You mainly don't know what CCP is thinking because you have no idea what you are talking about, but thank god CCP knows.
---
Resource scarcity in an MMO sandbox is IMPOSSIBLE. This type of shit works in single player games, in RPGs, not in MMORPGs. You can not implement it in the way EVE Online is built, this would just flat out lead to the game's death, for real.
---
By passive I mean passive hardeners, but you still need the adaptive invulnerability fields which are actives. The exact ehp with boosts and phenom is 214m with passive hardeners.
---
As much as I love the big dakka, shit like this always makes me wish I played logi. But I'm slow af so I'd probably let people die.
---
That's definitely it then! Things always look super weird when looking at them from far away :D
---
Yea and I missed it by a day and lost billions so I'm a bit bitter about no timers or warning when there's no asset saftey of any kind in wormholes.. It's punishing I quit for a good while just because I thought I had more fuel than I actually did and had to deal with real life. Yes player error but a crippling error for a minor oversight. Oh its a benine tumor till 3 days later and your dead... That's what your proposing. some people have there entire life's work in theses stations they should get some warning and considering we get one in game warning for 24h or less fuel its a tad fucked IMHO. Should go to the new app also but that's another discussion 
---
You clearly don't operate your own structures I run 4 mediums between wh and hs. If there's no timers ill simply take them down and lose billions in rigs. Because it's cheaper than losing the stuff Inside because I forgot fuel for a day and some loser with a stealth bomber afk killed them.. 
---
I'm not saying low power should do everything it does I actually think no tether no repair and giving the ability to entosis the fitting service would be good. And fuck insurance.. But a single timer IMHO is the only fair way to give the little guy a chance. And not punish them for having a real life.
---
The problem here IMHO is there's no limit on structures in NULLSEC if you don't own the sov and don't fuel the structure it should decay and die on its own over time. Considering panfam used raits as gate pins.. It's a tad fucked.. None of this has anything to do with timers tho.
---
The reason alot of people say no timers is because of spam not because it's actually good for players.
---
Are you familiar with the Higgs Anchor rig? It is a must for mining IMO. It reduces the max velocity of your ship by a huge amount. So what that means is that you can align towards a warpout point, and because of the Higgs Anchor, your ship can sit there aligning for a very long time without moving much. So you can sit in a constant state of alignment, and as soon as Trigs or PVP pilots show up, you warp out instantly. If you have the Higgs Anchor, are paying attention and not afk, it is quite literally impossible for any PvE or PvP ship to gank you, regardless of fit. 
---
The drawback of the Higgs Anchor is that it permanently slows your ship, so you can only really travel via warp. Trying to go anywhere with regular propulsion is not an option. However, for mining, this doesn't matter too much.
---
The Higgs is indispensable to nullsec miners, and you should consider it even for highsec if you are having problems with Trigs or other rats.
---
Okay as long as they continue to iterate. 
---
More than likely this is their citadel patch for the next 12 months.
---
They will still be anonymous until they are found out. They will not be forced to keep it a secret. If the dev doesn't wish to release their character name, that is still their prerogative.
---
can't make a logi omelette without breaking a few dps eggs
---
nah you're just of the mindset that "reddit is the enemy" and believe that different people in the "opposing camp" can't have differing ideas. you genuinely believe that it's the same people who argue for/against different opinions, just for the sake of "grr goons".
---
&gt; Yea and I missed it by a day and lost billions so I'm a bit bitter about no timers or warning when there's no asset saftey of any kind in wormholes..
---
No offense but it appears you are letting your view on what is best for the game be driven by very personal experiences from a very personal standpoint.
---
Citadels have unlimited storage, and their fuel bay is large. There's no reason why you can't keep a citadel fueled as long as you want one.
---
why whore on one killmail when you can whore on five
---
Many are already in Null Blocs, just now their corp members are allowed to know line member #8675309 is CCP Jenny.
---
It will never be viable in a DPS role. Its weapon system is inherently bad, so readjusting to compensate for any reason toward that end, is a waste.
---
Regardless, the jag needs further tuning.
---
T20
---
Yea I am because I'm a small player that would be beyond punished for having a real life and I don't think that's fair. I shouldn't have to log in every single day just to make sure my structures are still alive.
---
This is a change simply for the larger alliances to easily clear they're space nothing more
---
You can still open up the fuel bay and drop off fuel like Flex structures.
---
They are already there
---
You know, I will try it. I never heard about this rig. gonna report back...
---
5/10 Not enough Derptrons.
---
There are Goons at CCP already
---
It's far easier for Imperium to expand North up to Fade/Pure Blind than it is for them to fight TEST for their space. Similarily, it's easier for TEST to take all of the Deteroid cluster than to try and take Delve.
---
You werent punished in that instance for having a RL or not being able to log in every single day. You may a clear player-side error. Dont mix things up.
---
That still wouldn't allow you to online any services and thus remove the low power state, as that requires taking control of the structure.
---
My body is ready for all the new e-drama that this change will probably bring in our game.
---
That new Hecate fit going around with double cap booster and dual reps might stand a chance.  I actually took one out the other day and ran into a bunch of Ishtars.  Sadly they all warped away before I could catch them.
---
So how long before a region is reuseable by goons is my question?
---
Trying to gather LP from SOE by doing distribution missions, soon i'll get to level 3 which i understood is the cap for alpha then gonna sell items for isk to get omega . What cargo space do i need on my nereus for the l3's? The infos are quite outdated , some say 1-2k others say 8k. Need to know not to slow down with the alignment and warp speed. Also i found only 2 soe l3 agents for my corp standing, how do i choose one? Do i just go with the safer one or with the more l2's in the system for extra missions?
---
The way they're talking says this isn't true.
---
I think it’s a great move.  
---
Sure it has some downsides and opportunity for abuse, but those can be taken care of if they happen.  More importantly I think being able to more freely play and interact with people, it increases the depth of understanding of the game that these individuals are actually developing.  I think this is both acwin for the community as a whole and the devs.
---
Looks like fun
---
You are aware we're talking about hypothetical scenarios that CCP is highly unlikely to ever even seriously consider, right? And if the answer to that is 'yes' then I'd say months, to ensure that they can't settle and fortify in a region, their income would need to come entirely from outside of the safe haven of fortress Delve and measures would need to be taken to ensure their space is vulnerable when they're gone.
---
splitgunsssss
---
You should still stick with the spirit of this and don't intentionally out yourselves.  Deny, deny, deny as long as you can get away with it.
---
You should be able to FC like any other line member can step up though. You need the ability to experience the game even if it risks outing you.
---
Your idea is one of the worst i have heard of. What exactly do you think the null players would do if this would happen?
---
A hecate with dual rep will not be able to keep its mwd on for long under neut pressure, even with 2 cap boosters. And once your mwd turns off, and you have no webs, the myrm will just fly right out of scram range
---
Sounds like a good way to kill the game
---
Is volta flair the new WHer flair?
---
i can totally see ccp deadlift getting into logistics wing and deadlifting ihubs and shit with his buff arms
---
The smart ones that are interested in playing Eve would split into smaller groups. The lazy fuckers, farmers, botters, RMTers, F1 monkeys would quit (in time).
---
That's the one!
---
Yes I agree this is a hypothetical. I am just saying that if its 3 months, goons can just rotate from regions they already have fortified. Peroid Basis to Delve to Querious to Fountain and then back to Period Basis. If they need more space they push north through outer ring and test pushes east into detorid.
---
You can't kill what's already dead.
---
exactly. people are going to have strong feelings about this, one way or the other... and im sure it will stir a bunch of shit up and start a bunch of wars. there's a reason this rule has existed, but maybe in hindsight they were holding back a major conflict driver over looking it as an untapped resource
---
Precisely. Or more to the point, they just go to the fleets to ensure their farming priviledges aren't revoked.
---
Can wait to hunt all of you out in the open.
---
Who gives a fuck about supers, I want them for my passive Gila and rattlesnake shenanigans.
---
Auto translating chat logs in real time - thinking of writing a python script.
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strongest trait is it?
---
Wouldnt say its a nitpick? Theres a Rorqual undocking in high sec, does it mean they plan to do something with that? Pretty valid question isnt it?
---
possibly the new market thingy
---
dunno what is more relevant, supers versus gila / rattlensnake shenanigans..
---
The return of Kil2?!
---
we w8 these shield implants from 2015 and can w8 till 2025.
---
and you will die like this again, among other ways and times. skill urself or bio &amp; send me your shit.
---
That's not a reason, that's mental illness.
---
Depending on system size should take "x" seconds to complete. 100au like 10 secs d scan scan time
---
I wouldnt store supercaps in any citadel for a prolonged period of time. Supers and titans are best deeplogged in space.
---
"You people?" Must be don cherry eve reddit account
---
exelente
---
Wut he says^^
---
We arent just talking about super coalitions problems. Citadel spam is a real thing. Making fighting over structures aids is a real thing.
---
Your problem is very much just a citadel management issue that can easily be mitigated by your own measures. .
---
I’m still relatively new to the game. What I don’t understand is when someone uses the word solo which means one such as Uno and yet it’s either do a boxing or otherwise has an alt. I just don’t understand the complete misuse of language.
---
I think I was? Can you elaborate? :)
---
And you are surprised? Why? They just tried no local in NS and we lost a ton of players. Now we should get rid of asset safety? The players of today won’t stand for it.
---
Asset safety is never going away and I can see why even hardcore players don’t want to see it removed. If had all of my stuff and I went on a two week to a month vacation and came back to years of stuff being gone I would be pissed. If I had to move ALL of my stuff before every vacation I would also be pissed.
---
That software would have to be injected in the client and therefore be against the ToS though
---
No, without log files in the client you couldn't do that easily or without violationg the ToS. Not having a audio notification pop up would be a huge improvement. It wouldn't be perfect but a lot more kills would be possible.
---
Ye, in a 200km titan DD contest, neuts wont really matter for the tank.
---
Every mmo I've played that a gm talked to me I loved playing. Deva should be super active in the game.
---
About fucking time.
---
Win10 is better in every way, and will probably run smoother.
---
If you HATE the idea of the “assistant” and store things, look up Win10 long term servicing channel, it is a version of Win10 stripped down, what Win10 Pro should be.
---
The log off/on seems to work ok, at least if its done every few hours. Will poke you if we build up a stack of missed kills.
---
Never understood why we have to have chat log files in the client. Other than enabling intel tools it is useless in most cases. There have been very few cases over the years where I found the name of a player via logs when I forgot to save it somewhere but that's about all I can think of.
---
