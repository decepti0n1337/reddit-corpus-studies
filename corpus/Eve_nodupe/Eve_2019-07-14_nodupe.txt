About what part, because I’m really not! 
---

---
I’ve had two normal sized laptops that have been destroyed due to traveling for work. I saw a chromebook at the store and it sparked the idea that maybe I should try one of those because they’re more portable and if it gets messed up it’s not a $500+ loss.
---
Join one of the big nullblocks. Horde, test, frat or goons. Drop carrier on stuff.

1. Drones can be recalled. Don’t remember if there’s a default shortcut for it. You can manually recall them by dragging the drones from the “drones in space” menu into the drone bay menu. 
---
2. Best way to save money is to not get caught. In hostile areas, make sure to use DSCAN (even if local is available (LS/NS). Dscan gives you a way to see activity in your immediate area.  If you see probes on DSCAN it means someone else is poking around. They probably aren’t friendly. 
---
3. Day tripping into wormholes is very lucrative. You’ll die eventually, but completing a single relic site will get you 15-20 mil on a bad day, and up to 75-100 on on good one. Don’t use holes close to trade hubs. Everyone else will be doing that. Go 6-8 jumps out and start scanning. You’re after C1-3 holes. They can have relic and data sites (relics are worth more) they will be named after NS factions (Blood raider temple, etc). Any relic/data sites with “unsecured” or “forgotten” in the name will be sleeper sites, which have hostile. 
---
The plunge into wormhole space can seem intimidating, but it is some of the best income available to alphas.
---
People have been wanting this since release, so it's been a long time. Hope it never comes back.
---
I can see all my fellow testies just fine! No idea  what your problem is.
---
Eve will not run on a Chromebook.
---
I'm not 100% sure but I think Chromebooks won't run Eve: Online.  I use a very old laptop (AMD A10 from like 2011) but use a remote desktop utility to connect to my PC at home to run Eve.  It works fine for updating market orders and doing some industry stuff but I would not undock anything expensive.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Eve doesn't require much to run in potato mode but laptops are scaled down PCs so even newer ones might chug a bit.
---
My desktop PC is an old i7 2700k OC'd to 4.5GHz, 16GB DDR3 RAM, and a decent SSD, and recently upgraded to a 1660ti GPU, made a big difference from my old HD6950.  I run 4-6 clients with decent settings for day-to-day stuff with no problems.
---
Not sure how that translates to laptop hardware but hopefully it gives you an idea.
---
I really appreciate your info thank you.
---
Imagine being this spoiled by local. It will make zero difference for the big bloc. They will get dropped. A cyno will be lit and the massive blob of F1 monkey supers will land on grid just like how it has been currently. 
---
There will be high fives a around from the spod brain super pilots for forcing off those evil hunters and life will go on.
---
as a sub-capital nullsec market seeder I'ld strongly recommend to learn the game mechanics involved in transport logistics. Let me pitch you some absolute basic ideas you have to known about. If u don't have a clue about every single point mentioned below don't do it. You're not ready yet. Everyone could accept a contract, but not anyone can deliver it! That means to stay alive and to not losing cargo and ship doing so. In hauling there is no "die trying" if you wanna do profit. 
---
This list is not complete but at least you have a grasp of hard work hauling stuff...
---
 
---
\- docking / undocking at main trading hubs without losing your ship to a ganker, insta-warpins / insta-warpouts and usage of "people and places tab"
---
\- common understanding of warp mechanics (3 basic requirements to be able to go in warp: align angle, minimal neccessary speed, minimal warp distance )
---
\- mwd-cloak trick, covert ops cloaking, cloaking ability requirements ( distance to objects and being locked on )
---
\- webbing into the warp, bumping
---
\- docking rights at players structure
---
\- distinguishing good, bad / fake contracts.
---
fly safe and good luck out there capsuleer!
---
Damn! I was really hoping it’d work and I’m damn glad I got that answer before buying one blindly. How come it won’t work?
---
oh if it counts as a win for unspoken when goons, lazerhawks, and therabois show up and do all the work then that's a different story
---
but i guess i wasn't counting those as wins for unspoken
---
Yeah thats true. I think this was the first time i was ever hyped for an eve update.
---
Unsupported operating system and hardware, a Chromebook is little more than a android tablet with a keyboard and touchpad.
---
I am trying to load my Character Skills and other things like transactions, wallet and the like.
---
Yeah I’ve got about the same PC as you do! It runs Eve like a champ, so I wasn’t sure how crappy I could go with hardware and be able to squeeze at least one potato mode client out, because really that’s all I’d need while traveling. 
---
So if you use your old laptop to remotely control your desktop back home - that means that the laptop is merely sending the commands and streaming the video output back to you?
---
Correct. My brothers have returned, or even just subbed without even playing to try show support for this change.
---
For some people eve is about more then just crab mode and counting isk.
---
Abyssal space has opened up a whole new avenue, market trading was always a thing. Lowsec has higher isk payout as well. You are right when you say "same category" but there are other ways. Abyssal 5s have higher rewards than superratting. Even in lower levels where the risk is substantially lower you will still make more than even Rorq mining. With practially no risk.
---
Thats true. But its also meh. We are trading one thing for another and there will absolutely come a player designed solution to handle intel. But local wasnt a big enough issue. People are hailing this as the solution to the problems in Eve but those arent even affected by no local. This is a purely onesided change to appease a minority playstyle of hunting at the expense of majority or krabbers. And this after several major nerfs to NS the last couple of months.
---
Its just going too far.
---
And honestly, this wont affect me all that much. But I know it will affect tons of others, especially smaller groups. And we dont need more blobbing.
---
You had me at blackout.
---
no local is the best change thus far in TYOOL 2019
---
The only fights ive had so far have been against pvp gangs.... so im assuming someone killed your pve ship and u butthurts?
---
Lets rob the liquor store
---
Ooooooh wow really? I didn’t know about the OS. I thought maybe there was a chance for the hardware, they’ve got anywhere from 4-8 GB of RAM and up to 2.5gz processors.
---
We used to shell out when plex was 300mil
---
And everything was more expensive back then too.
---
Abyssal space is also much higher risk than regular ratting and can’t be done effectively afk. It can also be done anywhere, including null so that avenue for isk exists for anyone who chooses it. It’s not just beneficial to hunters. It’s beneficial to roaming gangs, particularly smaller ones, because it allows for an element of surprise for what you’re fighting. On either side, this is more chaotic and exciting, but as somebody who flies with a smaller group, it allows us to punch up because the guys we’re shooting don’t know what else is coming.
---
assuming that "burn in" means making a 90 degree turn towards the target says more about you than it could always say about the pilot burning in
---
Only thing I don’t like about old map is that you can’t window it. Otherwise it’s better in like every way
---
I have seen this in low sec plenty. People arent using 2b pods in pimped out ships because they want a good fight, they do it so they always win fights.
---
But its not like that everywhere true. However I have really never seen anyone roam into NS (except for other NS groups) looking for a good fight, they just wanna kill as much as possible with as little as possible losses then moonwalk out of there. And if u put up a fight they start crying about caps and umbrellas and what not.
---
Its like a rapist crying that the person he was trying to rape shot them.

More frequent smaller updates or larger, bigger slower updates. Game devs, pick one and only one. 
---
Also, remember this webpage: https://updates.eveonline.com/ 
---
CCP doesn't
---
Thank you for demonstrating my point. I appreciate you.
---
Pretty fun fight, Nightmares are still one of my fav comps to be part of :D
---
&gt; pvp super that you use for ratting in Theta
---
keep telling yourself that lmao
---
That is not a apples to apples comparison to PC hardware, they are ultra low power systems on a chip.
---
I think everyone else has pointed out the issues.
---
If you are not a part of a null, low or wh corp stay away from carrier ratting, network sensor array is a suicide button for reason you could use the old sebo's type fit however you won't have either good tank depending on hull you choose or and the downside of sebo's u still won't get the same sensor strenght in comparison network sensor array for cheap.
---
And last one: you probably won't be able to chain the anomalies in the system if they are not upgraded, in case they are local residents might not like you and your presence. Plus you having no intel means you get tackled sooner than you think.
---
These were the reasons why you shouldn't do it, so u go out there and show New Eden that you are different!
---
rephrase, Isbrabata Murder
---
Sorry for off topic but were you running in a wolf rayate C2 or something? (Just interested in doing it myself if the isk/h is good enough)
---
how is seeing less on the first sight and absolutely no difference between 1 and 30 active pilots in space ''better in like every way''?
---
can someone tell me how is this not botting ?
---
Most of the complaints I have seen has come from imperium members. They have the most resources to overcome this. People need to stop bitching and adapt.

---
Warp to zero simply ended the trading of region BM's that would warp you to zero gate to gate.  Which also helped to end the mass copying of BM's in stations to create lag bombs.
---
Its higher risk, not much. Lower ones can be run with cheaper fits and practically no risk. Sure, cant be done afk but neither can carrier/super ratting. There are no real risk of ganks whilst doing them in HS. In LS/NS there is. Plus why would you stay in NS if not for the isk. Its far from fun in general.
---
Its still a minority. I like small gang, most fun thing in Eve. But, you can fly out to LS and get fights there. Or just pick a random WH chain and ask around for a fight. There were avenues people werent taking yet complaining. And honestly, you could have fought Horde, Brave, Provi, Querious and prob a bunch of other NS places before as well. 
---
People act like it used to be impossible, I know thats not the case. But you had to put effort into what you wanted. And now they can just go into closest NS space, kill ratters who basically have no means of defending themselves anymore cause d-scan doesnt cover enough space to align out and everything. And thats what we basically have now. That isnt better mate. It will force the subs to upship to caps because those have cynos, are cheaper and make more isk. At worst you face newer players getting stuck and not being able to buy injectors to catch up and simply lose interest in the game. Thats not improvement.
---
its probably input broadcasting, which isn't the same thing as botting, but is equally disallowed by the eula/ccp.
---
Balt still has it \^.\^
---
FRT was also given the order not to undock krabbing caps. Could be a cause as well
---
I make the same mistake everytime ...
---
Chromebooks are basically a tablet with a keyboard. They aren't meant to install programs on, they're meant to be always connected to the internet so you can run apps online. If you want to write a letter, you do it through Google Docs, not by installing Word or something. If you want to watch movies, you stream Netflix, not download and watch offline.
---
It's not a computer, let alone a gaming computer.
---
Multiboxing is not botting. And you don't even need input broadcasting for drone assist.
---
now that's a good meme
---
For drone assist yes, but it's not the only thing that hit OP
---
All the ship's lights flicker, in fact
---
apparently the pilot with command bursts wasn't aware that rapid repair charges don't work with cap sized module
---
May as well do  it in Klingon, at least it takes less explaining when people lol at you for bad choices down the road
---
Wow reddit posts. Such proof. Much reliable. I’m convinced. Thanks for wasting your time though.
---
You seem like the type of guy to complain about your tornado not applying to interceptors
---
Cool thanks, good to know! I didn’t know if some of the “higher” end ones ($200-$300) had a chance at running at least one client
---
&gt; The trick is everyone has to make money somehow.
---
and everyone does.
---
&gt; Krabs refers to people who exclusively rat or mine, and don’t PVP,
---
no it doesn't, if you do more of the former than the latter you're a krab. Sorry but linemember #452 isn't gonna get out of the label cause he fills his paps and maybe goes out to a few fleets extra, why he'd care about it anyway is a mystery but people do seem to be touchy about being called krabs so v0v
---
TIL you didnt feed
---
He might have been input broadcasting, I have no idea. But don't throw out accusations of 'botting' without evidence. I can run this many ships myself without a problem.
---
Me, why?
---
36% Structure baby
---
That’s what the blackout does. We don’t know how many people are there, so why would we want to bring less than necessary just in case there is more hidden there?
---
I literally predicted this when blackout was announced. Just causes alliances to be more risk averse and drop the hammer more. Causes more consolidation.
---
Also if you want to krab safely during the blackout join horde! All you need is a cyno :)
---
There are more paragraphs in this self fellating train wreck of a tumblr post then there are members in your Corp.

It looks pretty incredible on titans. After x47 there was some bugged out titans that had already died, and yet remained on grid with 0% hull many hours after the fight. The flashing lights made it super ominous, almost like ghost titans remaining on the field
---
With eve-o preview hotkey switcher it is so easy to multibox. Just spam “1 2 3 4” etc and click the same module each time. Regroup to keep them close, ez pz.
---
Most people here are just meming man. Also pls stop with the holier than thou attitude as its kinda like a weird passive aggressive form of being toxic.
---
No real pvp fights.  The real fun of the blackout is talking about how fun it is.
---
Of all the groups it went to theran, pfft.

One of those clips was just you burning towards the gate whilst armor repping, I wouldn't consider that a PvP highlight, maybe show more of the fights and how you earned the kill, how you set it up, that sort of thing
---
Kills are coming in like crazy. Standing fleets keep posting in game kill reports left and right. And I'm talking juicy ones too!

Who the fuck plexes 10 accounts to have them fly interceptors...

He isn't botting. Each ship staggered the start of the modules so it clearly wasn't input broadcasting and he used fleet warp. There was plenty for signs this was not an input broadcaster.

Why not come back in and play Alpha? You can get in on the fun for free!!
---
They were all deleted.
---
Yeah sorry looking back I realize it looks like that doesn't it. But no I don't have the time nor money to spend on Eve sadly.
---
It would be nice if caps and supers blew up slowly over the course of a few minutes rather than just instantly going up. Would make big battles that much more awesome to behold.
---
Now if only they bring back the golden era for wormholes, too.  I've been waiting since the day they ruined w-space for them to make wormholes great again.  I long for the days of dropping site fleets and blapping capitals.
---
Fun fact, hunters and krabs are the same, but multiboxing.
---
By default it is turnt off.

So nothing will change then?

*heavy breathing*

Enyos aren't ceptors.

Those were mostly bombers bar fleets tbh

no killboard, no fun

Please extend to low sec at your earliest convenience

WOW!
---
Okay, lol. Now with context this post makes total sense.
---
Thanks for taking the time to explain it!
---
Indeed they are not, but I don't think that makes it less pathetic
---
idk... someones mad probably^^ i mean, it should speak for itself when even ccp members like kil2 are using the old map...
---
Sucks to suck.
---
They just barely made it to the 6 month period most people were expecting it to get to before they just simply forget it happened.
---
More then one type of explosion would be nice to.
---
Shift-R is the default recall drones keybinding.
---
Dang what a zinger, you sure told him
---
its LS who cares not like they making any isk or getting any good minerals.
---
The camps we are talking about were when NCdot was actually a real coalition called Northern Coalition. Was before most peoples time.
---
Do you need medical assistance?  Looks like you had a stroke or something.
---
Wormholes and nullification killed it way harder than JFs.
---
Skill training is a thing. I too sub 3 accounts for like 4-5 years i didn't "play". Passive skills are best skills.
---
There were plenty of camps happening in 2008 when WHs' came out and after that for many years. Nullification no doubt killed it, and these mega industrial coalitions with JB's killed it. Likely was before your time, but there used to be gangs running around in a pipe, and alliances would dispatch squads to go take care of them. As a person who ran groups running through those pipes it was immensely fun fighting and out maneuvering the camps. That whole game style is pretty gone now thanks to JB's.
---
It's revenge for what [Poison Kevin](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/56kkdo/poison_kevin_gets_pissed_at_horde_fc_doomsdays/) did a few years ago.
---
Im not actually looking for that TBH. If they make nullsec black out then lowsec with a 2 minute delay sounds good to me. Honestly though, im happy with it the way it is, except that theres no real draw to lowsec. 
---
If there were some mechanism thst brought traffic and dwellers in then its good again.
---
I havent subbed in any consistent manner,  since lowsec died.
---
Don't complicate things, it's still not going to run Eve.
---
Because the in game value is inaccurate as fuck. I killed a Nergal the other day worth about 900m, but in game showed as half that. I want to know the exact value of what I kill so I can make a decision on if it's worth keeping or selling the loot, and so I can figure out how much value I've gotten out of a given ship in it's life time. 
---
I literally do not care about my killboard stats. Look me up when Squizz unfucks zkill, I have plenty of red and plenty of expensive losses to dumb shit. On my alt I have a niddy loss with a high-grade slave pod loss- if I gave a shit I would've pulled implants. 
---
An out of game killboard is nice to have because sometimes I want to be able to share a fun or cool kill or loss with friends.
---
Dang, time to buy a combat recon. I hadn’t even realized the significance of them now that local is gone
---
They didn't know that Chromebooks run a different OS, the chances of them getting that setup and it working well are near zero.
---
Ok moron, there is literally video evidence of it.
---
You not gonna last here son. Go back to whatever kiddie pool you crawled out of.
---
Ok but I want to be able to cyno from a wh space too, into null
---
If every update was super exciting, none of them would be.
---
It's actually not quite instant, IIRC it slowly blows up over the course of around 5 seconds one hull hits 0
---
maybe it's one of the dozens of other nations that declared their independence from the British empire?
---
Just going have to use local.
---
I don't know anything about Chromebooks, but I have a Dell Inspirion 11 3180 that I bought to tote to my extremely boring job in a scale house to watch shows and surf the net on through a Verizon data tether on my phone.
---
 I have my trade alt for market shit running in the background most of the time and it works just fine for that. Undocking- not so much. 
---
Cost me like $140 on a sale, it's light and small, and if I lost it or it got broken, I wouldn't feel too bad. I did by a $50 dollar external I keep anything (including the eve client and shared cache) on it that I can't put on the sd card memory it has.
---
The point is, if someone with no time can make isk without ratting so can others. Never said that I was trying to convince you. People can dislike what I'm saying, but the reality is that people will just be lazy to make isk while learning new things. All the krabs will probably down vote this, don't be a slave to krabbing. Do something more with your time and get better isk.
---
Even if the super is only 10-15b depending on type and region, the fighters, pod, refits etc are often worth that again. Never not fit anything less than an a-type tank + high grade slaves on an Armor super, if that’s too much isk for you then you shouldn’t be flying one.
---
Always take the bait
---
Ditto on the lack of sub due to death of lowsec. But at this point I don't know what you could do for it. Maybe add pirate factions to FW. I dunno. Its dead Jim.
---
This is the real message here. A few exciting big updates a year, and a larger number of less exciting QOL and balance updates a year would be amazing. Maybe one BIG DRAMA update or so. But yeah the boring stuff needs doing and is important :D
---
Why wouldn't it work both ways?
---
Accounts paid for using plex net CCP more money than people paying for their accounts using subscription money.
---
Well it's hard to watch skilled folks go.... Enjoy winning eve sir o7
---
use nullsec ore only
---
Yes but the shame of that shitfit being on my kB is greater than the Isk lost had it been properly fit.
---
Yeah, and I’m saying the cool thing about EVE is that it is 100% viable to make isk without ratting if you want to. You have options, which is fantastic.
---
Literally tab-&gt;f1 as fast as your pc can handle.
---
I can do 3 or 4 clients a tick before my pc sometimes lags. With no laf, you could easily get 5, maybe 6.
---
Its pretty fun roaming around without actually knowing whats there, and no zkill/dotlan makes it even more interesting. All Ive managed to do so far is feed a Stratios to a fleet because I thought their scouts were a small gang lol.
---
You are using the new map. 100% this is bait but you have triggered me more than I thought possible.
---
Why wouldn't you use krab accounts to do other fun stuff, anyways?
---
I liked putting 20 entosis alts in fleet or having 20 cloaky campers when I ran a mining fleet.
---
It does feel a bit like w-space with increased odds of finding people, but also increased odds of getting baited and dunked to counterbalance. Its pretty damn enjoyable.

Warp to zero was needed. What shrank the universe was jump freighters.

Excel, unfortunately, is a pain in the ass to use with this kind of API. It's the multi step process which makes it tricky.

ESI is OAUTH based for authentication. You'd auth it out separately with something like postman, to get a refresh token.

You then get an access token with it, and then get the data you actually want with that.
---
Market data is simple to get, if it's the eve central style (take a look at https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/api/ )
---
no you can't because the inhib would have to be on grid with them to work if you're still talking about rorqs, and only the mentally challenged have not added inhibs to their overview at this point.
---
I'm going to assume your extremely angry reaction is due to losing more than a few assets to Drifters considering there was no reason to be this angry otherwise.
---
In my case, with killboard, no fun.
---
Like statistics in any FPS and stuff, it forces you to do well, not to play and get fun. Best moments for me in multiplayer games are mostly in servers without scores, because the others players aren't acting as douches for the sake of their stats. In EVE, I sometimes feel better in Singularity than in Tranquility.
---
And more importantly, if you don't take care of your stats, someone else will take care for you. It is especialy true in EVE : a bad score in killboards can be bad to enter some corporations. A bad loss and you are first page in Zkillboard, etc. You cannot play as you wish, you have to play as defined by a vanished elite from BoB times.
---
No one is using excavs, not sure if you just not gone looking or are not currently playing but every rorq I have found for the last 2 days was using Miner II's
---
These dudes wanted to use fucking abaddons and only abaddons, so I showed them the proper fleet abaddon.
---
The only pro that mattered was nobody bitching about needing cap.
---
and it involves less risk since the only option for killing them in highsec is ganking them. At least in null there were the few deteremined souls who would hunt them and kill them, in highsec its not even worth the effort and they get to farm without interruption.
---
But the effect on the economy is not as pronounced no?

And when they exempt the slashers, we fly slashers. So on and so fort, until every ship in New Eden is exempt, and the botting menace can be wiped out once and for all!
---
Well, considering Chromebooks cants run windows or Mac applications....
---
You're shit out of luck.
---
You do realise there have been several nerfs towards NS the last couple of months? And the issue isnt the isk making, its the lack of of isk destruction. Besides, only 1 alliance that wont go bankrupt doesnt mean that no alliance will.
---
This will 100% force people to group up more as a supercap umbrella is the safest place to be under. Thats the opposite of where we want to go.
---
You should just take better care of your hardware.

My surface pro 3 has been with me through some 30+ countries and even horseback riding in Kyrgyzstan.
---
See - this is good information to know! LOL
---
It's optimized for volume. And only volume. 
---
You'll probably be pulling in an ore which contains a bunch of other expensive minerals, because they're optimal.
---
What you'll want to do is put limits on the more expensive minerals, rather than leaving them at -1 (which is unlimited)
---
(Optimization for more than one variable is complex. And everyone is going to have different preferences. With two variables, it's a curve, with three, it's a 3d shape with dips and peaks.)
---
Provide the data then.

Got to have it turned off to join fleets or FCs get angry
---
You can say that nuclear weapons aren't a problem as it is the case in technology in general, still it did change the ways people are doing politics since then, the Cold War was a decent exemple of that.
---
Technology can change people, in good or bad, so it is not only a people problem.
---
Killboards was a manual thing at the beginning and so it was more or less possible to opt-out depending if the other part forget to post the killmail. I had few losses in 2006 who was never reported... but syndication and later API made it impossible to escape. Apart doing HS activity only, of course.
---
As it is a multiplayer game, if you don't take care of your stats, someone else will take care of you. If you did bad, it will have consequences (first page on Zkillboard, or door closed of some corps, etc.).
---
But technology can be modified easily, fastly and efficiently. So it is possible to mitigate bad effects.
---
Adding an option to hide your name in your loss, in counter-part to not getting any of your kill, can motivate many to play as they want to, and attract new players who will know that they won't be humiliated by anyone.
---
And of course, if you enter in a corporation whose policy is to publish it, you can disable it and enter if you really want to do in this one.
---
Okay. So does that have relevance to our conversation? Or just generally making a tangential point?
---
The military likes to make travel and destinations more difficult than you would think. Of course it’s my fault for bringing it, however I’d like to continue doing so without risking $500+!
---
You all crazy to think that I’m just going to give you my Nyx , I,l sell it and go  c3 c4 hunting in wh in worst case scenario at least there you cant Cyno blob me ,  blackout in nullsec is more risky then wh k space , 
---
And Incase you wonder I pve to pvp , I never needed a blackout excuse to get pvp kills , matter of fact this blackout is messing with my prey .
---
believe me.. I had to take many long walks away from the keyboard.
---
No, for reals this is the most toxic gaming subreddit I've ever been in. Go back and read all the shit posts regarding Brisc and The Initiative. Everyone was wrong about Init. And Brisc and this subreddit was rolling in the mud.
---
The game is old man. If you had made 1m/day you would be a multibillionare after 17 years. Just up that 1m to 5m as in your example and start calculating. 
---
And you are yourself presenting the issue, we produce more than we blow up. So give us a reason to blow eachother up. Which NS has been clamoring for. Atm, there are no real reasons to fight. Therefore not enough destruction. This needs to get fixed, no local will do zero in this aspect. 
---
Even if all of Eve decided to go to war against NS the destruction would be marginal in comparison to what would happen if NS groups start fighting eachother. But there has to be a real reason.
---
That's a lot of bluefucking I see.
---
Fucking Karen haha! I already had this conversation, I didn't go the triglavian route, I went with "cool alien symbol language shit that fits well with my other designs n stuff n things"
---
Double digits, not even close
---
Yep - I’m glad I asked! Usually I buy shit on impulse, and I was going to get one of the sub $200 chrome books to test it out. I’m damn glad I asked on here to find out that the OS isn’t even supported rather than after purchasing it XD
---
I made it for Spear years back. I used Photoshop.
---
Ya, one way or the other, its got to be more lucrative. Money = risk = content.
---
They will hopefully figure it out.
---
YOU would regret it. I happen to like the way it looks. I wanted my daughters name but something different. I like the design of the triglavian letters and it fits with my other designs. Its 1000x better than any Chinese character tramp stamp IMO :)
---
The guy who commissioned this wanted something to convey high sec players daytripping and I think he had suggested a Talos so I went with it. Given the recent blackout fun I decided to post it.
---
That is the worst possible outcome. The huge empires dont need more players, they need less. And you are mistaken about the fun part, supers and titan pilots arent using their stuff as much as you might think. Its pretty much only Delve that does it and thats because you cant win a fight on that scale against them. No one will even try.
---
We need more smaller groups that steal players from these mega alliances, that will create more conflict.

---
Ridiculous that it should be down totally.  A simple 24 - 48 hour delay would serve the purpose just fine.
---
#1 thing I recommend is that you find a corp with around 10-30 players in it. That way you have a group of people you can hang out with and they can help guide you through the learning curve.
---
Lock target, orbit 500m, turn on guns and tank. Repeat.
---
  Wait until target dies as frigates pop

Our FC actively avoided shooting blues until your fleet warped to us at 0 and tried to snag our logi &amp; recons. After that, all bets were off. If you can't take the heat, get outta the kitchen.
---
I think it's funny.
---
F
---
I dont think you realize how much extra botting work you just described.  And how many more accounts would be needed to bot less safely than before.
---
With local it was easy, binary.  Rat because local is empty.  Or not rat because local isnt empty.  Even if a bot farm does like you say, sets up a scout on each gate, how will it know the pilot has left the system?
---
If safe logging shuts down a bot operation, then no bot will ever make any money.  And if it doesnt stop it, then there will be free kills.  Local removed any chance for counter play because a bot had perfect knowledge of whether or not there was a hostile in system.
---
There will be ways around bot sentries.  Safe logging, cross jumping gates, or even getting to scan before a bot detects a decloak.
---
10% who wont be missed.

Was at EVE Invasion Toronto. Fozzie said something about getting rid of Lowsec Cynos to much applause.
---
Forcing NS logistics to pass through lowsec would be a big boon.
---
Dunno if CCP has the nuts for that though.
---
This, I finally managed to sort RL and log in today, went roaming into Init. space, got a couple of kills, crossed paths with everything from small gangs to Titans and ended up going home with the always trusty Pod Express when I crashed into an improvised gatecamp on the way back.
---
Nullsec hasn't been so much fun to roam in years.
---
Anywhere to find f2p only ship layouts?
---
Can f2p accounts multibox? Legit or not so legit ways of doing it?
---
I'm sure you'll find one listed in the MOTD of the Abyssal Lurkers channel in-game. If not in the main channel, just follow the link in there to the 2nd channel for the other sample fits.
---
jesus forgives
---
&gt; but bear with me on this, cynos should be nerfed.
---
The jump drive has always been the one true real problem.  No local (on the long term) likely means as many fights get missed as get created.
---
Nothing to do with the no local, fucking retards. Supers died all the time with local too.
---
No. Only when you cloak is off.
---
Hahaha. Awesome man.
---
Given fight denial is already the core model of all the major groups not really. 
---
Like sure you have some groups that assign a bunch of systems as don't drop here but that's by choice not by mechanical need.
---
They also have the most krabs to complain.
---
Youd probably hear more from frat but....bots be bots.
---
i think you are overestimating the demand for toy spaceships.  sure, you and 10 of your friends might want some, but is it really enough to warrant ccp hiring some 3rd party to make these things and sell them?  say they order 5k.  how many avatars do you think eve players will actually buy?  how many does ccp need to sell to recoup it's investment?
---
They only look at the screen when TACO yells at them and you know it lol.
---
Alas, that 20 character corp regularly fields 8-10. Pant's 500 character alliance struggle to field 15.  
---
What's that ratio?
---
Only 12? Rookie numbers. Let me introduce you to my good friend Joe Painter.
---
1. Not really, eve University wiki has a little icon for their fits, but you pretty much have to look for an alpha specific fit, or change stuff around to make it work. 
---
2. Alphas can use all t1 sub cap ships, which means t1 and faction frigates, destroyers, cruisers battle cruisers, and battleships.
---
3. Not legally, I’d assume separate PCs (real or virtual) could work, but by the time you do all that and risk a permanent ban you may as well just pay the sub.
---
You are 100% right
---
CCPls!
---
"Can we get something more sensible? Like having all the Projectile ammo together, all the Hybrid ammo together, etc."  
---
Seconded. Probably one of the most annoying things in the game to every player with OCD.
---
I really think EVE would a lot better game if multiboxing was banned tbh.
---
i never found out how you did that, how do you switch between previews using a hotkey?
---
Let's look at your example.  Theres still ways around it.  The counter bot can be got around in multiple ways.  1. leave a character in there for a long time logged off.  Eventually that bot has to purge its count.  Or logging off an alt will permanently stop bots there.  2. Go in, light a covert cyno at a deep safe and bring in another hunter.  Leave system with original scout.  3.  Use a wormhole.
---
&gt;It's optimized for volume. And only volume.
---
This makes a ton of sense, thank you. The values it was giving me made no sense what-so-ever. 
---
Thanks for the tips. I'll give it a shot to see if I can get it optimized for what I am looking for!
---
I use a program called TeamViewer, it is free for personal use and has worked well for me.  Performance does depend on your connection at both ends but for simple stuff like updating market orders and starting industry jobs I have been working with a ~1Mbps connection and it is workable with patience.  
---
I am sure there are ways to streamline it etc but this has worked for me.
---
Resubmit now, fire up your laptop real quick, set up your skill queue, then don't think about it much until you can play.
---
If you have like 250m skill points maybe that's not as useful a plan, but thought I'd through that out there
---
God damnit, I just got in the game... Someone helped me with millions and millions of money for skillboosters and fully fitted Tempest. He told me I could earn it easily back by doing incursions or lvl4 missions with the Tempest. 
---
I was just doing a level 3 mission to get my standing up with Sisters of Eve and suddenly 3 people warp in, warp disrupt me and slowly just finish me off :(
---
How do earn money without being in constant player danger now? :/
---
im at work rn, can google “eve-o preview hotkey” and it should direct you to the eve-o github help page where theres a guide on it
---
If daddy Sappo was head diplo, I would shoot goon structures all day!

Each ship has a random but equal chance to get 1 of  4? (I THINK) 1 of which is always blue.
---
STFD
---
I did buy one after I skilled into it right before I went on hiatus maybe 5 years ago. I was in a barely active corp, maybe 5 guys on at once. Did I ever use the damned thing? Nope. Is it still lying dormant in a hanger somewhere in low sec? Yup. Undocked it back then maybe a couple times just to stare at it for a few minutes and that was it.
---
You consent to PvP when you undock. Or so that is what I've always believed.
---
people were more hyped for the blackout than the entire fucking abyss patch shit, if that's not a sign i don't know what is
---
We master baited a 1.1 billion isk Wormholers Proteus with a VNI. He did not like 3 racks of nuets and all those heavy drones.
---
We later master baited Odins call and killed an Otherus, Zealot and Stiletto. Was actually a pretty fun fight, for me anyway. Thanks Wormholers!
---
I wouldn't mind the points, danger rating, and gang/solo% to be removed, but I'd at least like to see my own killboard, quickly, when I'm logged in at least. And then everybody else's can be on a 1-hour delay or similar to other accounts/logged-out viewers.
---
Haha yea. A way for us young kids to get an advantage over the old farts than have been playing since I was in elementary school lol
---
If I was the type to give Reddit awards... I'd do it just for the word play there on Content.
---
&gt; (haven't played since drifters 'cept checking skill que)
---
Good for you. A lot of players haven't played except to check their queue since ccp smothered small gang PvP over the course of the last few years.
---
And continued to function. One module going offline per 30s or so.
---
If a wormholer can't fit big things through a small hole, what was even the point in becoming a wormholer?
---
&lt;3
---
Sounds like addition by subtraction for EVE.
---
As of an hour ago the player count was 19,500 which is down from the same hour last week when it was at 21000. At 19:30 eve time on saturday the player count was at \~28000 this week, last week it was at just over 30,000. So about 2000 players from week to week are no longer logged in at peak weekend times. You are wrong.
---
Do it. Would love a delay I have had a few times popping out in null from our wormhole and learnt later that the only reason they have known we where killing bat ratters not reporting intel is because of the km's popping up.
---
Customary not a WH corp.
---
How? They are still printing money, they are losing less and skill wise highsec botting is even easier to skill into then nullsec botting.
---
There is tons to do as a new player. 2 newbies will tend to beat one experienced player on DPS alone. But there's way more to do than just PvP, and you can do it all.
---
Remember when they started calling Lag TIDI?

If the random number is smaller than 0.01 then the hit will always be a wrecking shot, 300% damage. There is still no guarantee it will hit.
---
However, if your chance to hit is also very very low, then the only shots that have a chance of hitting will also have to below 0.01, perhaps far far below 0.01. Any of the numbers required to hit a very difficult-to-hit target, are guaranteed to be wrecking shots, because they not only have to be below 0.01 for a wrecking shot, but they must also be below 0.001, or maybe even 0.00000000001 for a hit.
---
All hits (on a hard-to-hit target) will be guaranteed wrecking shots, but not all wrecking shots on that target will be guaranteed hits. Most of the wrecking shots will still miss. ALL of the non-wrecking shots will miss. It is impossible to hit with a non-wrecking shot. The full miss chance still applies, wrecking shots do not change the difficulty of hitting the target. It is still very unlikely to hit, even with a wrecking shot -- but still possible with a perfect wrecking shot. It is NOT even a little bit possible with a shot that is less than wrecking.
---
Make sense?
---
How does that compare to this week last year?
---
How does that compare to one week from now?
---
One month from now?
---
You have incomplete data.
---
I spent large parts of the last year mining and ratting since my return to fund my big toys. I have never used taco or near it felt like cheating even if CCP didn't say it was.
---
Take a look here:
---
[https://www.thealphasguide.com/reference/wormholes/](https://www.thealphasguide.com/reference/wormholes/)
---
The rest of the guide in that link is pretty good as well. I was away from the game for about 15 years and a lot had changed in the meantime. The guide brought me up to speed with the basics in no time. Take your time to understand the core mechanics and you'll gradually discover more and more of the game and get to more complicated playstyles.
---
As an example, i rolled a new alpha alt when i came back to eve to try out exploration and decided not to transfer isk from my old characters to the new one, just to see how i could do. Wormhole diving is great because the return of investment from a single run can cover your initial ship and fit cost many times over. Worst case scenario, you could lose a tech 1 frig + fit which costs barely a million isk, but you could easily come back with 5-10 mil isk per run at the minimum.
---
After a few wormhole runs (2-3 afternoons of playing for a few hours) i had enough for a vexor navy issue. After doing some event sites for a few days with 3-4 newbros in the starting corp i had enough for a Gila. I also had quite a bit of PvP experience from back in the day so it all started coming back to me, ended up taking newbros into wormholes a couple of times to show them how to find and kill other newbros, started going on a couple of public fleets/roams flying frigates for fast tackle and so on.
---
Then i stopped playing for almost a year, played again on my old hauler/trader alt for a few months (with the occasional public roam on my old PvP focused main) and made close to 15 billion isk in a few months, stopped again, and so on. I don't play very often since real life gets in the way (i can't justify a constant time commitment, so it's not worth it to get omega for now), but i'll periodically fire up the client and mess about to keep in touch with the game.
---
Still, i've never had so much isk when i properly played the game back in 2004-2006 as i do now (i think i never got above 500 mil, which is a bit tight when you regularly flew heavy assault cruisers that cost 250+ in PvP) . Part of this is due to the current inflated economy of EvE, part of it is due to having a lot more ways to generate isk than what we had back then, and another part of it is that back then my single character only had combat skills trained and was 100% PvP specialized (i got my trading/hauling alt only a few months before i stopped playing). I was experiencing a lot of the fun aspects of the game, but i always struggled to make enough isk to keep myself in the ships i wanted to fly.
---
Combining my previous and recent experiences, i'd say exploration is a great stepping stone for a new player. Not only because it pays well at the start and can net you some starting capital to try out other aspects of the game (getting a good PvE ship, or playing the market later on), but also because it conditions you to lurk in dangerous areas and get used to taking risks and losing the occasional ship.
---
It teaches you the two fundamentals of how to have a good time in the game:
---
1. how to make money
---
2. how to make explosions

Enjoy!

" How does that compare to this week last year? "

The changes being measured where not in effect a year ago, that data set is irrelevant to the current question.

"How does that compare to one week from now?
---
One month from now?"   
---
Give me a time machine and I'll tell you  
---
" You have incomplete data. "  
---
You are cherry picking irrelevant data points to stitch together an argument because you are too lazy to google the available data yourself.
---
I would like to at least see my own killboard with no delay when I'm logged into zKill. Removing the somewhat arbitrary points system and danger rating might also be cool.
---
Ouch. Why you gotta do him dirty like that with evidence?
---
The gilas you shot before that were my fleet so no, you shot us first.
---
You don't even have to go that far back. In 2013 n3 camped the C3 pocket. When horde had hed-gp, they camped the gate
---
C'mon they are at least using 'augmented' ones.
---
So is FW considered pvp or pve?
---
That twatwaffle is still around? Holy shit.
---
I was in low sec gate camping, always had to have 3 accounts. Definitely becomes taxing and difficult to justify financially speaking.
---
It was a different time...back before there was warp to zero, some battleships could go &gt;6 km/sec with MWD.

Crabs is a requirement to join now, I guess?

After intentionally trying to get into sub cap fights all day, I'm starting to feel gaslighted about this event. Nothing fun is happening at all. 'Pvpers' are just killing the remaining krabbers and my populated home pipe is quieter than ever.

Everything is down...black out is upon us.
---
I can see some anchor structure in the future that gives comms to a system. Hopefully it's an ez to destroy thing if it happens
---
krabs have teeth and cloaks too!
---
Yea, but they’re not making nearly the same amount of isk/hour
---
Thanks for the quick response!
---
I'll check out Eve U and some new player stuff. It's been so long I mind as well start from the beginning as far as guides go til things click again.
---
I thought so about multiboxing too, I couldn't remember the specifics on it, so it's still allowed as long as you sub? What if I sub one account, can I use a free account to compliment it or do they all have to be subs? I figured at most, maybe one other account on a separate PC as if I had two players in house playing but wasn't sure if I had to play non multiboxy-like..i.e not having them logged in at the same time every time I play etc.
---
But I guess I'll just stay away from it and see if 1 f2p account sucks my 5 subs back in.
---
Especially when they explode!
---
Tbh researcher does this better, he flies entire fleet comps just by himself, logi, anchor, dps, tackle. That shit is impressive ans terrifying
---
I regret my previous statement and would like to retract it
---
I was watching live, there was some great fights!
---
lol. Yea this blackout is very good for content. I hope CCP makes it permanent. CCPlz
---
Feel like a t3c would be literally a 10x better, better at scanning, nullified, can have pvp refits, cloaks while warping... etc etc
---
When isnt tripwire having issues.
---
I hope it's just a total blackout forever.
---
Been in pH space all day. Many frags to go around.
---
I never understood why ships had lights and stuff when your dude is the only dude on board, why would you need all that extra space for crew if you don’t have any?  Wouldn’t it much more useful converting it something useful like storage space, or backup machinery?  Maybe dead space to minimize module damage in a battle?  Looks cool though
---
&gt; The changes being measured were not in effect a year ago, that data set is irrelevant to the current question.
---
No it's not.
---
Because one of the changes between last week and this week you are measuring is that it's mid July instead of early July.
---
The game follows yearly cycles of activity as well.
---
&gt; You are cherry picking irrelevant data points
---
Except they are relevant.
---
You can't cherry pick 1 data point and claim to know the future. That's nonsensical. You have demonstrated you don't even know about basic yearly cycles, yet somehow you can judge the future of a change that people haven't even adapted to?
---
AT is useless to the majority of eve.
---
I saw that guy in lowsec once. I slid in a Hookbill on a Merlin. About 15 Griffins uncloaked at range and jammed me simultaneously while the Merlin killed me. I wasn’t even mad. It was hilarious.

Do you not enjoy being at a the world cup public viewing in your local city .. just having a a beer and even when you have zero interest in the actual mechanics of soccer, you would still support your team in the semi finals?

The future hasn't happened yet, you can hold it up as a what if all you want but it doesn't mean a damn thing till it happens. you wanted proof, hard numbers were delivered and you immediately started ignoring them because you prefer the fantasy land you live in.

and they are not facing the losses and highsec miners/ mission runners are much easy to scale up.
---
That's 4 releases a year, vs CCPs 12. You're proving u/Wicker_Khagan's point.
---
I can vouch for horde they dont put the game first. Plus people are really nice and helpful. But you should join a corp just find one that works for you. Thats what I did I dont really have alot of time to play so I log in when I can do what I want, fleet, rat and other things, no one compkains when I dont log innfor a day or that I dont stay on all night in a fleet.
---
Back to where you came from, please.
---
&gt; The alliance tournament isn't going away
---
because its already gone
---
Based on the deep "Eve lore" I believe the ships have entire crews on board, the capsuleer is just directly connected with the ship or something like that. But the capsuleer wouldn't need the lights since they're floating in a ball of goo in their pod.
---
Naw

Yet we still had so much fun and frags today.

You also command the ship, which is why you pick a warp point then wait while the crew does it.

There is running plexes which is pretty much pvp you get paid for if no one kicks you out and there is mission running which is pve. Plexes have a single rat you need to kill to capture them that re-spawns every once in a while but it's pretty much a piece of paper you shoot to pass the time.
---
Mines, and DDing through cynos, both fucking broken, both fucking funny.
---
Pretty common for people who run burner missions.
---
Perhaps consider going after something that can fight back, scary I know.
---
[For the uninitiated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S06nIz4scvI).

Thank you CCP!
---
Fake news
---
Hey is that you Gevlom Goblin?
---
This is the real truth
---
You showed a number.
---
Of a small subset of data.
---
That can be explained in a million ways.
---
Paging /u/elowenn
---
No...it's just not happening this year because the venue for fanfest is closed.
---
You forgot to mention your jump bridge networks that allowed you to avoid those same gates..
---
Umm they are the people we farm.
---
EDIT\*\* finally found someone to shoot... He was warp stabbed.
---
This. The community only has so much hype to throw at things, so if big changes are the norm there will be less hype.
---
Nuh uh!

Horde Vanguard does it again.
---
Yes OP, please try it in Delve. 
---
See if [/u/Olmeca_Gold](https://www.reddit.com/user/Olmeca_Gold) will point you in the right direction.
---
T3 will always out preform a t2, but for this while your hacking. A T3 is visible to D-Scan while Lachesis is not. meaning with local down they wont even know your there without combat probes. True Ninja Hacking
---
\&gt; wouldn't you still support your team in the semi finals?
---
If you're a member of the few groups that consistently get there, sure. The AT gets really stale toward the end when its basically the same 3-4 groups rotating in and out.
---
Few people get excited to hear that \~\~the Patriots\~\~ PL are in the \~\~Superbowl\~\~ finals this year
---
Now imagine that, but every nullsec entry. Torrinos - EC-P8R used to be insane fun. Also living in Nalvula as pirates, just to bust gatecamps ^^
---
AT is my favorite E-Sport to watch since I understand EVE and the mechanics (probably awful for outsiders to watch.)
---
I really wish they would bring it back, I always looked forward to watching it even though I've never flown in it before.
---
Wait really? I was under the impression it was gone for good? If not that is great news!
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
---
It is called delayed local because that is what the local system used for wormholes has been called since they were introduced.
---
A blackout would also prohibit anyone who does show up because of talking. Local is “delayed” because you must wait until someone talks in it.
---
I don't like playing multiple accounts, ruins the "rush" by breaking the immersion.
---
When everybody else is having fun and getting random small gang fights all around the game, and you're making a thread on reddit, the problem isn't the game or its changes bud.
---
Its you.
---
The art reminded me of [Pyrion Flux's vid](https://youtu.be/Bkzv-3vJn4w)
---
You're clearly not doing it right. We've been on a rampage.
---
They still camp ec-p8r and m-o.  
---
There are certain people built for it, and there's some that are simply not built for it.
---
we caught a revelation gating through fade last night it was really fun does that help your dilemma at all
---
Doesn't make it any more correct
---
....and the relation between the AT and fanfest is what, again?
---
That would be 'opt in' local not delayed
---
not a combat Lachesis, a hacking Lachesis... and i already said i t2 fit everything for cheapness in case i loose it. Also I made about 900 mil isk yesterday so the whole ship Payed for its self already. Every thing now is profit. the cloak is just if i see combat probes on D-scan most the time i cloak before they get the first scan and i never show up on any scans at all so no one looks for me. also have probes to jump into a wormhole if need be.
---
Because bot farms arent getting set up...
---
So, you avoided every area that had activity so you could run on r/eve and post about how you didn't find anything to shoot? 
---
I passed several fleets out roaming around.
---
Oh man, im not sure I like that idea though. The vast majority of people clapping for that were likely null dwellers who felt that it was the right thing to do.
---
My guess is that when most think of lowsec pvp,  they picture 5 man gangs but my favourites times were in That Escalated Quickly, fighting uphill battles against DT, SC or groups of russians. We're not talking about HUGE fights... lets say 70 to 200 though, so not small.
---
So often we'd use a titan to bridge, or other times blops. Having to go gate to gate would make null change it up sure but it kills possible content for low too.
---
The blackout really gives me hope but this hammers it right down again.
---
I mean, if this goes through,  it just means I'll finally move to null , the next time I come back.
---
I mean, maybe its the next logical step now that null is gonna be less safe.
---
It's delayed local. CCP has referred to it as delayed since they introduced it with wormholes.
---
Tbh there not gonna and this is how it is now
---
The blue one is also the most rare.
---
Is it confirmed that it’s going to be permanent
---
Again,  just because they called it that doesn't make it right.. They could call it unicorn local for all I give a shit, its not accurate
---
You're right, it is pathetically pedantic. CCP has referred to it as delayed since they introduced it with wormholes.
---
There are modules in the database now, that would allow a Keepstar to turn Local back on. So it looks like the Blackout is here to stay, unless the residents turn it on one system at a time.
---
go ahead and link the dev blog announcement
---
Don't custom made channels also have the Delayed Mode / Immediate Mode dichotomy?
---
So I found this definition online:
---
&gt; To cause to be later or slower than expected or desired.
---
It doesn't expressly stated the delay is of a fixed length. There's room in the definition for a delay to conditionally indefinite. To last forever, unless some specific event happens.
---
And that condition, in the case of Eve's chat, is talking.
---
It’s null, it should never have felt like a safe space in the first place. That’s not what it’s for.
---
The days of mindlessly chewing your gums on the way to the next super capital are over.
---
Oh my bad, I had no idea that as a solo roamer it was my job to feed to a small gang.
---
I’m guessing it’s not going to be available in wormholes
---
That's because of how you want to perceive it. There is a delay in displaying players in local until they send a message. You're just being pathetically pedantic like the OP said.
---
No, you were being deliberately misleading in your statement about the lack of activity.
---
Wanting people to recognise definitions and understand the English language is pedantic?  No. Op is absolutely right its not accurate its confusing to new players, its bad, and you should feel bad for supporting it
---
You guys remember the hype over premium graphics?  Pepperidge farm remembers
---
IKR, the pvp is alive and well (and it's 2019 lmao)
---
You're right they should totally revert this change.
---
Really though I'm not surprised you're not finding much aimlessly roaming through renter/bot space. I'm doubting the sincerity of your post but dotlan can give you decent idea for places to go.
---
It's whatever the fuck they say it is, regardless of what you think. It's not inaccurate though
---
It can be opt-In and delayed. You have to wait until someone chooses to talk. It’s the waiting for others part that makes it delayed. Sure it ain’t the most encompassing description, but blackout isn’t even that accurate since potentially everyone could still opt-in and nullify that.
---
Thats not how English language works im afraid but I guess like usual the American education system has failed another one.
---
For 2 and 3, take a look at the filters you can apply to inventory windows.  You access them on the bottom-right of the window, and can make your own.
---
I hope CCP takes this positive feedback to heart if/when they consider adding upwell structures that provide non-delayed local.
---
Yea that’d be very cool but also it would basically bring local back to all the nullblocs, getting rid of the intel blackout that makes so much content available. I feel like if this was added it should be done such that its not worth it to install them except in the more important systems like their hubs or whatever.
---
soli doesnt input broadcast. he has done this for years, and is just ~~autistic~~ good enough for it
---
When people want to pvp they generally go to areas with activity.
---
It is pedantic because you are trying to say only your narrow definition should be correct. It absolutely can be referred to as being delayed. Local is still there, but it delays in displaying players in system until they send a message.
---
Idk where this upwell thing came from, afaik CCP haven't said anything about adding local structures, just whining krabs
---
Wrong.  Nothing is delayed the message appears as soon as the person sending it opts in and decides to type in local, there is no delay. Again English language is there for a reason.
---
That's exactly how the English language works. There's nothing inaccurate at all about describing it as being delayed. You're the mouth-breathing retard that wants to try to dispute anything that doesn't fit your narrow-minded viewpoint.
---
I believe you perfectly described yourself especially looking at your post history.
---
The chinese combat fleets are as effective as the EU/US ones - there's a couple hours each day both are active and it's hilarious seeing the odd enemy fleet get sandwiched on a gate without either side knowing both Frat fleets were in the area.a
---
WinterCo's pretty much an open alliance. So long as you'll turn up for the fleet calls when the ping goes out and don't bring more than the usual internal drama - welcome aboard, they'll find you somewhere to setup and operate from. Politically it's democratic - a goddamn mess pulling in all directions, for the most part only CEOs care anyway, line members tend to just sign up to fleets and pew in the appropriate direction like anywhere else.
---
That's way riskier than local though
---
All this is showing is that you haven’t figured out how to have fun with this.
---
## Definition of delay
---
 **(Entry 1 of 3)**
---
**1a:** the act of postponing, hindering, or causing something to occur more slowly than normal **:** the state of being [delayed](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/delay#h2) 
---
Gonna live this here for you smart guy.  I thin it fits well within the "act of postponing" portion of the definition. 
---
Go argue with fucking Merriam-Webster about their lack of comprehension of the English language
---
Nothing is postponed when you opt in to type in local there is zero delay
---
Talking to stupid people agitates me somewhat
---
so what you're saying is the entire north and west of the map is not populated at all
---
I actually like the idea of total blackout with all info not just local ,it was difficult when i first started to move to null even with countless empty systems between us and others that it was fairly easy for gankers and people looking to harass someone to just click on a site and they knew right away which system was being heavily used.
---
It was almost impossible without a long list of blues to grow and get into cooler ships without being shit on right away.
---
You are postponed from appearing in local until you type. Do I need the construction paper and crayons for this one?
---
So much this my dood.  Take my updoot.
---
&gt;but dotlan can give you decent idea for places to go.
---
I guess you missed how it joined the black out too??
---

---
You can't fix stupid
---
I didn't say there was a lack of roamers. But i'm a solo roamer and a small gang isn't a target for me, I'm a target for it. Maybe we have different ideas of what activity is. I don't consider dying to a small gang "content". But if you do more power to you.
---
No bots.
---
So no, you are wrong once again I'm afraid hold on to those crayons you'll still need them
---
I agree completely.  I'm deff not advocating for the return of safety to null.  I had a goon comment on one of my previous posts a few weeks ago (before blackout announcement) that nullsec was most dangerous space in eve.  The blackout has made his statement _less_ false.  I'd like to see it stay that way.  Nullsec has innumerable benefits when it comes to empire building.  It's about time it had some actual drawbacks, too.
---
Postpone does not have to be time based, it can be time or event based. My confusion is how you can read the definition from a dictionary and still not comprehend it.
---
Saturday night during the summer? Maybe a lot of people slithered out of their caves for a day.
---
&gt; No, they're going to shut it down 
---
Dude, EA still runs *Ultima Online* servers. Eve isn't going anywhere. At worst, development would stop.
---
So maybe a more accurate statement would be "I saw activity, but nothing I could or would engage"
---
This makes 42 alive last I counted.
---
That's a interesting statement. Would be very risk vs reward, which is why I started playing anyways.
---
A day of data doesn't support your conclusion.  Arguably that's a totally normal curve with maybe a significantly higher peak.
---
\#ExcusemeBartender
---
Yea. Tbh I think everyone overestimated the chaos that would unfold. Sure, for the first few hours almost all of nullsec was on lockdown but now its a ripe ground for content, and I think many people want it to stay that way.
---
Are you just argueing because he proved you wrong here?  Or do you honestly believe the nonsense you're crapping out im curious 
---
Like all your posts are usually pretty special but you've gone full retard today lol
---
Ultima has a special place in MMO history and a huge development studio owns it. It also costs them very little to maintain it. I'm not sure Eve has that kind of clout or financial backing.
---
It's day 3 by now.
---
Weekends are normally busier than work days.
---
compare this time today, with this time last week.
---
what does that show?
---
Good fuck the bots
---
lol  
---
Come back after at least a month of data then we will start talking.
---
I have been enjoying being part of this so far
---
I'll wait until people that have some semblance of intelligence wake up to continue this conversation. You should really avoid posting with all your alts in one thread. It's kind of obvious
---
I had that idea and this toxic community belittled me greatly. Guess I'm the smart one and you all look stupid now.
---
you are still alive? I miss your youtube videos
---
Fair point, but I think my comment stands regardless.
---
It shows what I said, numbers going down.
---
They've actually started declining when the Drifter event started.
---
This is interesting, because with all the accounts to be resubbed, how many more people must have stopped playing?
---
No alts needed here lol you'll make a fool of yourself without my assistance on the matter,
---
If its bots then idc, let it drop
---
&gt; There are modules in the database now, that would allow a ~Keepstar~ to turn Local back on.
---
guess delve is fine, the rest of you are fucked, though.
---
I'm gathering from your replies that you either don't know how pvp works or are being intentionally misleading.
---
we're all in delve sat on the titan in 1dq1.
---
We will happily risk 60-100m ships if there's a particular reason to rat in a camped system. No carrier should attempt to rat in a camped system unless the cap fleet is on standby to bail them out if needed. Plenty of uncamped systems around!
---
I hear rumblings to the effect of things like 'Local System Communications' and 'Cloak Field Pinpoint Arrays'. I suspect sov thats been held for some time will be harder to camp in than ever before, although it'll probably be insanely expensive to maintain the upkeep for nullspace with local comms and the ability to find enemy cloakies.
---
&gt; It shows what I said, numbers going down.
---
by how much?
---
This blackout is a blast, even for ratting
---
An Opt-in Local would mean you can't see Local unless you opted-in.
---
Ew gtfo
---
TFW you realize that all those ships you welped had hundreds or thousands of crew members with families and children they'll never be coming home to-- ahh who am I kidding, we're all immortal psychopaths, right?
---
Or a local that you would not appear in unless you have opt in to do so, which is exactly what we have you do not appear unless you choose to appear
---
it went up by about 3k, then declined to the old level.
---
in other words, all that talk of old vets resubbing was either just that, empty talk, or there are equal numbers of players who suddenly stopped playing.
---
the truth is somewhere in between imo.
---
Even by that logic 'optional' local would be more accurate than delayed
---
yeah, i was looking at friday/saturday numbers yesterday and noticed the player count was down by about 10% on last week's numbers.
---
All the people preparing to unsub if it is permanent might need to be considered. Numbers logged on are down and while a few autists use reddit to sperg their preferred content it seems a  majority have remained silent. Any easy kills that might be achieved early on will likely continue to wilt as people cannot/will not plex accounts.
---
Yet another change that is benefiting large null sec groups, seems that the only people that can now rat in null are super ratters protected by umbrella's just have to check the data for that.
---
Here you go Wibla
---
 https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:150135
---
If you have an Alpha (free) account logged in, no other accounts can be logged in at the same time, Omega or Alpha. So you would need two Omega (paid) accounts to multibox.
---
&gt; Yet another change that is benefiting large null sec groups, seems that the only people that can now rat in null are super ratters protected by umbrella's just have to check the data for that.
---
i mean like, we fuckin' told you that was gonna happen.
---
\&gt; How can he be trusted to not make private killboards for Bombers Bar, or Pandemic Legion, or Snuffed Out 
---
PL has had its own independent killboard for years because the code to make a killboard is available to everyone. So really, just go make your own killboard.
---
you're wrong, majority of crabs in my corp are frustrated and not playing, waiting for some ray of hope that we can return to Rorq mining with excavators once again.  Leadership is trying to put a positive spin on the situation, get folks motivated to run PVP fleets, etc...but Eve has changed and not sure miners/ratters will ever return en mass under current conditions.
---
You seem awfully hung up on the idea that a 'delay' must be a fixed length of time, and can't be dependent on any extra conditions. 
---
Can you shed some light on *why* a delay can't depend on external requirements, and can *only* depend on time?
---
like they're saying, the capsule only replaces all or part of the bridge of a ship, but not the rest of the crew requirements
---
hi friends
---
i believe all that hype was unfounded. all in all, the numbers didn't go up or down suddenly, in any drastic measure. they show a slight downward trend, typical for the season.
---
maybe some people resubbed, and some stopped logging in (or left their alts offline), but all in all, lots of hot air.
---
You could say this about other game mechanics as well. Why do we need active shield/armor tank, why isn't it just passive, since you're just going to turn it on anyway? Why don't drones return automatically, why do I need to hit a button?
---
Sometimes you keep nuisance mechanics because they raise the skillcap, as you need to juggle these functions to do well in the game.
---
Because delay implys regardless of the length of time, that there is a time now in a game where the servers are on for under 23.75 hours of the day this length of time must be limited to within that constraint. Otherwise it's no longer a delay, 
---
The very word itself implys that an event will happen at a undetermined or determined length of time however someone appearing in local will simply not happen until they choose to or opt in to do so, there are words that literally mean exactly what this is, and I would argue back to you why are you so hung up on using the incorrect terminology for any other reason than 'thats what ccp called it before '
---
https://i.imgur.com/5GaJHAh.png
---
is this safe to press? because i'm pretty sketched out
---
Oh thanks dog. Yea tackled two rorqs today in two different fleets. 1 dead. Gonna make a better smug post in a couple days.
---
I'm sorry but I think this an ignorant attitude. Every player lost (player, not bots) is a small loss to the game and the community either that you like/approve of their way of playing the game or not.
---
Who the fuck is gobbins and why do we not like him
---
POE has the safety of new releases not affecting the core game. If something comes out shitty or less fun than usual like Bestiary, Talisman, or Harbinger, it is just in the game now. They get to take a lot more risks with their setup.
---
Imagine for a second your employer told you 'sorry, your pay is delayed ' and then proceeded to never actually pay you, it can no longer be considered delayed if the event never happens
---
According to the lore, Capsuleer ships have smaller crews but still have some crew.
---
Although some capsuleer frigates may not have any extra crew, particularly Gallente ones because they also use a lot of drones which means they can operate with smaller crews than the other factions anyway.
---
Larger capsuleer ships have crews though. They just don't need bridge and command crew.
---
I'm gathering from your replies, you don't live in nullsec and never looked at the map before it was blacked out yesterday.
---
that's what most people think - but bots can be run in hisec or fw too. And for those, who run 20 or 30 bots in anomalies there may be a higher risk to get caught, but they still will make enough isk to continue.
---
 I know many real people that were industrials and miners - they simply play other games now.
---
Well it is a chinese rip off so
---
no
---
Hi gathering from your replies, you don't live in nullsec and never looked at the map before it was blacked out yesterday., I'm dad.
---
bad bot
---
As stated above, this is exactly what the large null blocks said from the start but people just assumed it was goon reee
---
I wouldn't. The Chinese have a terrible track record with people's data.
---
Unsurprising.
---
common sense says it is permanent...this isn't a lore thing...it was a "silver bullet" that solved a myriad of issues for CCP...including increased revenue (no more botters - gotta buy from CCP)...things won't change unless...it blows up in their faces and the unexpected happens, then they might backtrack.
---
I feel like we'd have to see at least 2 weeks of data to.get a clear picture right now it would be a combination of excitement on the Hunters side, and downright fear on the ratting side, so until that settles and we see what is left, we won't really know
---
Player count doesn't matter. What matters is how many of those players are mains/active instead of alts/bots. The game is already looking healthier
---
They left themselves  gaping loop hole to back out of this with their little "We will monitory the situation" statement.
---
What the actuall gay fuck is this shit?
---
I remember someone saying how many people live aboard keepstars
---
There's several things wrong here. First of all, the general demand for a functioning merch store has been around forever. And second of all, CCP doesn't have to keep large supplies in stock and manage things themselves. There's plenty of companies that provide quick, made-to-order products that CCP can work with.
---
Sorry Blackout is no reason. If you do it for this reasen you just should filter the 0-Sec kills. Wormhole never had Local and you posted the killmails.
---
&gt;Or a local that you would not appear in unless you have opt in to do so, which is exactly what we have you do not appear unless you choose to appear
---
Are you claiming that my informal definition of 'Opt-in Local' is categorically wrong, and entirely without merit?
---
Or are you claiming that multiple definitions of 'Opt-in Local' can exist independently of each other (and independently of how Eve's chat works at any given time)? In other words, that both our definitions are independently valid, but mutually incompatible?
---
If your answer to the second question is 'yes', then I'll gladly accept your claim. If you answer 'yes' to my first question, I'd love to have a debate on that.
---
Obviously you've never seen Serenity server's blob bot that can actually bot entire fleet to participate a fleet fight and land alpha damage all within the same server tick.
---
You should wait for the subscription numbers to arrive.
---
It takes you to a legit SSO page, if that's what you mean. As for the scopes, [it's the same stuff you give to zkill when you login, just with a different site](https://i.imgur.com/DL364a1.png). I didn't bother clicking the Auth button, but if you do it's probably not a huge deal.
---
When did EVE became CoD?
---
Immediate and early conclusions = undeniable proofs
---
You mean the type ids from 2014 that have not been iterated on once?
---
It flickers at full hp, too
---
That's someone's hard work they stole and copied.
---
Whining on reddit won't get local back, sorry bud.
---
Truthfully I think multiple definitions can technically fit the model of what we got,  i dont dispute that 'delayed' has some resemblance to what it could be. 
---
However I feel out of all the options that could be chosen delayed is one of the more abstract terms to describe it, like truthfully 'optional' local would in my eyes be more accurate that delayed. Mainly because delayed is also the term that I feel can mean something completely different to the chat system we have right now,
---
Say if they released a chat system today that did not display a character in it until say 2 minutes from the moment they entered system,  would that also be called delayed chat, and would the Wh version of it seem less accurate to you if compared next to each other?
---
Naw fam, that's just concern trolling and whatever other stupid shit people like suitonia said.
---
Dude, the bots aren't logging in. That's all.
---
He probably doesn't even fucking play eve anymore like half the people on /r/eve.
---
Just wow...
---
Sounds like what the small gangs said before the local change, funny that.

Although I bought it for other reasons, this is by far the best use I’ve had for it so far 🤓
---
You compare day of the week to day of the week.  This friday and staturday were both -2000+ players from last week, and last week was already following a record low end of june week.
---
Considering max hype day 1 and day 2 is -2000 players, what is 'the hype has faded day 15' going to look like?
---
True, I’ve had some problems with details in certain spots, so I’m considering splitting the 3D model in two and do another print 😱
---
Thanks. I’ll definitely check it out :)
---
-10% of all players from last week.
---
pretty sure every major FC has had a hac fleet bosoned it isnt hard to do on a gate as the fleet is warping, even Elo's had it happen to him, I don't think anyone thinks he's a shit FC
---
Just ask tapi.
---
LOL. People provide their API and offer their own intel for free, that's what zkill is.
---
Looking at all my character's shitty zkill  status missing 70% of the kills is satisfying.
---
It's what they get listening to people opinion like olmeca. Benefits him more than anyone with his booshing.
---
It took me from Friday until right this instant. Good find.
---
only goons unsubbing, nothing to see
---
Until they realized it's not fresh hole and got a 50 bil carrier trapped in middle of nowhere.
---
I do think we need to add some way to uncloak cloaky campers.  At least the AFK ones
---
I agree with the poster above you, plus your an idiot. Delayed local means there should be a defined period until people start showing up. In it's current form, it's opt-in, not delayed. It doesn't matter what the fuck ccp call it.
---
Unless of course they typed in local... with trolly things or GFs to the guys they just merked...

It’s been happening. You just can’t see it because of no zkill
---
&gt;Truthfully I think multiple definitions can technically fit the model of what we got,  i dont dispute that 'delayed' has some resemblance to what it could be.
---
Excellent. 
---
I think you'll find that most here accept that 'Delayed' is not the *best* label for how chat currently works. But I also think that most here accept that it's *good enough in practice*. The resistance you're getting in this thread basically comes from that. 
---
&gt;However I feel out of all the options that could be chosen delayed is one of the more abstract terms to describe it, like truthfully 'optional' local would in my eyes be more accurate that delayed. Mainly because delayed is also the term that I feel can mean something completely different to the chat system we have right now,
---
Personally, 'optional' means that I choose to have access to the chat channel. In equal parts, I do not believe I am able to; 1) view the contents of a channel, 2) or comment in it, unless I am a member of it. 
---
I understand the discontent with 'Delayed', but I strongly feel that 'Opt-in' or 'Optional' is a *worse* label to use. 
---
&gt;Say if they released a chat system today that did not display a character in it until say 2 minutes from the moment they entered system,  would that also be called delayed chat, and would the Wh version of it seem less accurate to you if compared next to each other?
---
Comparing the status quo, and your hypothetical, I would indeed agree that the label 'Delayed' is more appropriate for the hypothetical. However, Eve does not use the hypothetical example. So, yes I agree, but it's entirely a moot point.

Wow, coming from you means...exactly dick

Interesting. That actually wasn't there yesterday, Squizz must have updated the page today
---
You have more patience than I do with dumbasses
---
even then not so much, everyone is using t2 mining drones now - which are cheap as piss and nobody cares if you boosh, bomb, or play patty cake with them.
---
also subcap ratting is pretty much dead so there's nothing for the hunters to find if they make it more than 3 gates without having 30 titans dropped on their face.
---
I think capital proliferation also has a lot to do with many players being quite old (in game and out) and tend to acquire shit over the years. I haven’t krabbed outside of the odd abyssal site for as long as I can remember yet even I managed to acquire a couple of supers and assorted capitals, even a battle rorqual that I’ve never actually used.

The last one for me was Apocrypha, which, surprise, has a lot of the same elements involved

Ah gg CCP then lol.

You don't get increased revenue from people who quit. Some people when quit just because their preferred play style just got fricked. Question is whether more people will quit than are gained.

Haha, touche!

I noticed this earlier when I inspected it. I was really hoping it was just a black overlay and i could access zkill with a tedious un-blacking lmao

Barley (Hordeum vulgare), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally.
---
It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 10,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.
---
In 2016, barley was ranked fourth among grains in quantity produced (141 million tonnes) behind maize, rice and wheat.
---
&gt;“higher” end ones ($200-$300)
---
That tells you everything you need to know about that. Computers are expected to cost nothing and deliver super computing performance levels. That is not going to work. That $300 Dollar price point includes shipping and handling, taxes and profit. What kind of components do you expect a device like that to have?
---
Here’s an oblique approach: you get yourself a decent laptop and you ‘age’ it, Adam Savage style. You make it look like it's old and beat up so that it doesn’t present itself as a likely target for theft. Put some stickers on it. Old stickers, to indicate the thing’s been around for a bit. 
---
I used to have a Nokia phone in the early iPhone age. I could leave it on the table, nobody was going to look at it twice. Sturdy, reliable as all get out, nobody wanted so much as touch that thing.
---
I’d recommend not making the mistake of investing in a computer that is not going to be able to deliver the performance you need of it. Now you’re out of that money and you can’t do what you want with the device. 
---
/just a suggestion.

Wow, never heard that one before. Please stop posting, my sodium levels are already high enough. Enjoy your Delayed Local

I had the opposite. I use a plugin that changes all pages to a dark theme so I didn't know that was supposed to be hidden until I turned it off.

It will matter to CCP and their investors.

Right, because Frat aren't obviously botting hard, when their alliance exec openly says he condones it lmao.

no local =)

More data required. Maybe bots aren't logging in
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

The lore pretty much always references capsuleers in a negative light because of this, regular humans hate "eggers" because capsuleers have no regard for them at all, destroying planets for P.I, getting crews slaughtered and never talking to any of them.

I just took this bait

That's besides the point. Player or bot, a pve creature stays docked.

That's great, thanks

thanks, will go lurk

I think at this point people are taking what was said 4-5 years ago and under different leadership and applying it to their headcanon now.

I would like to say,

I´m not a part of this, i just joined the roam \^\^
---
It is better than nothing tbh
---
Tho I would prefer the ingame map
---
You've got nothing to back that up.
---
And you're wrong.
---
lets look at atleast a full week (preferably around a month) before we judge it, so many people decided not to crab away the first cuple of days because people have been screaming "WE ARE GONNA KILL EVERYTHING" for days now and they know there will be a lot more hunters the first cuple of days
---
CCP has mentioned "propaganda structures" in recent months (Eve North for example) but hasn't said what they'll do. People are throwing the theory that these or structures like them might be used to give local back.
---
Personally I hope not because that will just turn the entry into every pocket into a local checkpoint. But hey, I'm willing to wait and see.
---
Day 1 was a lot of fun with excellent fights.
---
I can't wait for Day 2. Thanks, DTM &amp; team.
---
I wouldn't bother, they won't listen to what they want to hear. 
---
The narrative is that no local is a massive success, and if you don't believe it is, you're a bot who's part of the problem. This game could bleed players for weeks in a row, and we'd still have daily "look at me I'm going hunting" threads, even though they've caught nothing but super drops that sent them home via pod express since day 1.
---
While no local is an interesting change, it hasn't changed much, apart from make small alliances and groups unable to carry out mining or ratting in case force recons or cloaky campers are nearby. They'll either be forced to join a big alliance or they just won't play. 
---
I'm sure there have been a few bot losses too, but they'll adapt. Also an effective anti cheat method would be a much more powerful tool in the war on bots.
---
What if it shows the same thing in a month? 
---
Will you be emotionally ready to start talking then?
---
How do you set this ? :o
---
skill farms
---
This is another thing I don't understand. Why would goons of all people unsub? 
---
Largest number of capitals in game, but somehow half of Reddit thinks they'll be unsubbing, rather than small corps who can't defend against 50 man fleets of recons that come to kill their T1 mining barges.

A spoonful of cement will fix it
---
Instead they spend all of their resources on mobile games, shooters on decade old engines, dueling in a box, and impotent Tardlavians.  \\o/
---
If you go around botting regions, they’ve probably already got A.I. eyes on gates, and auto dscan, CCP gave them plenty of time to fix their software.

My favourite ship in the game, wish it had a bit better range though.

    &lt;&lt;Can you see any local from here? What has local given us? We're going to start over from scratch. That's what V2 is for.&gt;&gt;
---
Shitty Lore excuse
---
Hopefully gone.           
---
Having a insta pointing NPC fleet on gate or the same fleet able to spawn on top of you without any reasonable counter play was utterly bad mechanic.              
---
We have 'diamonds' rats CCP could utilize those - they are OP but most of the time respect ingame mechanics.
---

It doesn’t get easier than VNI ratting while watching tv or just going afk

Well local is gone....
---
a poster above you claimed that unspoken was winning fights before NC deployed their super fleet, and you said they were misinformed. on some of those structure timers, the entirety of panfam showed up, including a notable additional appearance by Skill Urself. Goons and the rest wasn’t a carry, it was a necessity.
---
Not every character is of equal value. Remember the login count is characters not players. Were shedding afk VNIs and other assorted bot/krab characters. When zkill comes back up Monday we will be able to see info about activity, which is what matters

your point being?
---
Welcome to one week ago. Nothing new added to the conversation.

You need to be killed by Wingspan then.

Back when I was new I got killed by them, got the mail shortly after. 
---
The pleasure I got from digging up that message, editing it to fit and mailing back to them the first time I killed one of them... Like a fine wine.
---
Characters online does not match revenue. We have the lowest numbers of concurrent character ever but CCP revenue is higher than ever before. Like just read their ck.pany reports
---
The only bit of data that matters is kills/deaths on zkill. If there is more pvp activity than before then its a success. PCU doesnt matter
---
do i look like a spokesperson for goons?
---
yet again people using ad hominem rather than talking about my points
---
PvP in a "small gang setting" isn't Goon's forte' 
---
  You'll park a jackdaw fleet in a nice spot, say you're ready- then light the cyno and drop 50 titans.
---
  Says the Dino- Goons are never known for "small gang PvP"
---
tell me more about how being in a alliance automatically determines what I am doing, how much I know about the game or how I actually play the game.

In case you're interested in doing your own, ore compression is an implementation of the Stigler diet problem. Which makes linear programming very applicable.

The blackout didn't just stop the bots I know lots of pilots that rat in VNI's to pay for their PVP and pay their accounts. They are waiting out the blackout and using what ISK they have to keep going but some of them will not be able to resub when it falls due.

I don't know if Providence (the region) is still doing it but they used to have a NRDS (Not Red Don't Shoot) policy whereas everywhere else has gone with the more standard policy of shooting everything that isn't blue or purple. 
---
It's part of the reason people hate on poor provi... They have a website that lets you check your status with them you'd have to ask someone there for it.

They where set red, don't bring -10s with a few blues and expect us not to shoot the reds the "blues" didnt get shot till you dun fucked up and warp on us at zero :)

fyi your not meant to downvote based on opinion, only if it dosent add something to the discussion (like something off topic)

You were replying to me and arguing against my point (of small gangers will kill shitters 1 by 1 or hunt ratters and call it small gang pvp, without actually engaging other decent pvp'ers

Where did I say goons were better that wasnt just memeing on some random idiot and an actual serious argument?

I agree on this at 100%, before when you were roaming you could know where to aim "ok there is 1 system with some pve activity 16jump from here who's in ?" and even with all the tool it was hard to find content..
---
I was wondering what happened.. fuck CCP seriously
---
Fair point, after that one idiot earlier posted about how he loves the changes and its a great direction for the game before mentioning he doesn't currently play and has no plans to do so in the future I should probably start expecting that.
---
People angry and refusing to log in, bots offline, weekend etc.. there is a lot to take into account, 2 days is nothing.. also the second highest player count for the week, for the month it's above average, not sure where you're seeing this downward trend?
---
Characters online is a direct measure of income forecast for a gaming company. So if there is a drastic drop, that will translate to revenue. Even more so in this case, since most characters in null are omega, *especially* bots.
---
actually had to chuckle, take my upvote
---
Wasn't there on the first day - checked with Dev tools and the header was pretty empty and body just had a div with style background:black.

&gt;In hindsight, this was (in my opinion) one of the worst changes in Eve history,

It was one of the best

It is breaking local.

ELI5: If you like the Blackout and want to let CCP know you think its a positive/negative change. Let CCP know. The "Did you enjoy EVE Online today?" buttons in the settings menu are a quick 5 second way to give feedback without going to forums.
---
We seriously didnt think this was the .which bullet did we?
---
Firstly bots take up a lot of online players
---
Secondly lots are alts of mains not mining and ratting passively  so they wont log in
---
Thirdly did people really think we would suddenly have drive of players subbing because of this?
---
Tbh most chars that log in are mains from vets and alts from vets.  I would guess 10% are actually newer players.
---
I do think no local will have a dramatic effect on the economy.
---
the problem retention of new players and eventually the leaving of old players.  
---
eve for me needs a new another instance and a massive shake up in many many ways for its survival .  I actually dont think no local solves the issue as nothings ever stopped players fight each other only the players themselves

Blaming the players themselves is lazy. You design the game around human behavior, not the other way around. There are perfectly logical *game design* reasons for everything that players are doing.

If you want gudfites with Horde without getting bosoned,  you go to LXQ2-T
---
My point is you shouldn't be able to safely mine, you should have to have some infrastructure (Intel etc.) to mitigate the risk. If it's really that bad, less people will mine and prices will go up, making it more worthwhile for time spent. If there's money to be made people will do it, they just need to be more organized and won't be able to do practically afk. It will be more engaging for both parties, there will be less of a mineral glut. Sounds like a net gain to me

Probably no-one in that station is currently buying the item. So you have two options:
---
1.) Find another station where someone actually has a buy order for the item
---
2.) List the item as a sell order, meaning it won't sell immediately - someone has to come along looking to buy your item and choose your sell order. The advantage is that you get to set the price for your item. 
---
I recommend just moving it to Jita or Amarr and selling it there.
---
About as long as it took me to accept my newvet bro is just gonna keep losing dem Tristans outside Dodixie if I try doing the epic arc right now, so porn it is.

I think that there should be some sort of player owned structure that enables local communication in a constellation or region but the price of that structure is that it also broadcasts information to everyone. Build one and your shit shows up on the map ingame, on dotlan, zkill, etc, or choose to go completely dark

The problem with the blackout is, that it  disproportionally hits new eve players that join a Null-Sec corp while it is nearly unaffecting the "old elite".
---
The "elite" will just as before sit in their big ships and light a cyno/call for help if they get tackled, busieness as usual. But newer players that only have smaller ships will lose them more often, will make less isk (if anything at all) and probably quit the game (as an extreme). If mining in Null gets more dangerous prices for ships/components will go up SIGNIFICANTLY which means PvP will get more expensive and less accessible for new players, which also means less content for all people in the long run.
---
And THIS is the problem with this patch, because the biggest thread to EvE is the lack of new player coming into this game. Yes you could maybe get more content with this "event" now in a short term but in my opinion EvE will lose content in the long run because it will turn off more new players.

Seen the latest proposed modules for Keepstars turns local back on again so big alliances will be back grinding for the next super capital before you know it.
---
Yup i aint touching ratting or mining till its over. I guess we will see even cheaper trig ships lol
---
I think that's his point.  The player base is mature and some groups have "brains trusts" able to scrape this data and do things with it that give themselves a big advantage over smaller, up-coming groups.  It's a basic unfairness baked into Eve.  CCP should close out the API, make these tools in game and available to everybody.
---
Wtf it's not lazy at all its fact. You all keep going on about the sandbox.  It's absolutely the players fault.  Its jot down to CCP for players form roaming gangs and fight each other like we used to.. stop blaming CCP.  Yes admittedly theres plenty that CCP could have done in terms of design but actually getting a group to fight another group is not it
---
I'm not a fan of it. I lovethe original though.
---
Would it be possible to have nullified ships be able to ignore bubbles at the end of warp part only. Meaning a ship would ignore drag bubbles and bubbles on Gates for example, but would not be able to warp Off from within bubbles.
---
No More 99% safe travel semi afk.
---
You are right, risk-reward, lp shops, rats item drops need to be balanced in low sec, too.
---
So much systems, smaller alliances could grew up inbbetter than in highsec or as renters in 0.0 are wasted.
---
Why moonmining is profitable in hs, what are meaning hs incursions for the game, why cynos allowed in low since caps are allowed to gate and known how much content easy JF logistivs drove out of the game.
---
CCPls: Balance lowsec finally for a healthier game!
---
I've played all weekend, but on only one account, not two. No point feeding my afk miner to the unwashed masses prowling through null. I bet there is a lot like me. No local is the best thing that's happened in this game since release.

This is the change that I've been truly excited for in my 9 years of Eve. I look forward to how it affects the general landscape.

I bet lots of the guys posting on here about how great the blackout is either don't fly in Null or are unsubbed with no intention to return. With the killboard off line I am sure more than a few "we slaughtered them all" posts are more down to creative writing than actual content.

Disable spodbrain tbqfh
---
The weapon of the master hackers
---
I hope you will lobby for this balance change in the csm, it seems very important.
---
On a serious note: how about a module for the combat interceptors that works similar to the adc in that it gives 10 second in which mwd can work while scrammed. Would actually allow them to intercept in large combat situations.
---
yeah its new im pretty sure, when it first blacked out i inspected it to try and see if the content was still there, and there was literally nothing other than "background color black"
---
Logging in 50 of my accounts to let CCP know this blackout is stupid and I shouldn't have to worry about who is and isn't system because **I SHOULD** be able to see who's in the system **I OWN** even though there's 20 faxes/supers willing to jump to me the moment I cyno this little event is bullshit forcing me to use T2 DRONES instead of excavators lol good job retarded CCP go eat a bag of dicks. . . . .
---
And you don't think the fact that CCP has laid off *massive* amounts of people since then has anything to do with that? I wouldn't play the retarded card so fast if I were you.
---
Cant disagree more, not having local chat gets more people on comms and talking to each other. Wormhole corps are well known for having really active tightnit voice comms because of the lack of UI based communication
---
I did it ages ago, been around for ages. Just never do missions.
---
Free loot
---
Ah heh, figured maybe it was a bug
---
Sure, but that's your corp. I was talking about the people not in your corp but that you still interact and live with. Comms... like I said, sure, there are channels. But that's not the same. And not everyone can or wants to be on comms all the time.
---
Nope, it's had the complete opposite effect.
---
An x86 chromebook will totally run eve
---
I mean it's not an unreasonable expectation for a blue alliance to not shoot at your fleet mates when your fc knew they were being led by me regardless of standings.  Had I known you were going to do that i would have just killed you before losing half my fleet.
---
because a d-scan softly creeping
---
left its cyno while I was sleeping
---
and the Super, that was cyno'd in by thee
---
has left me
---
within the sound of silence
---
typical low IQ goon player ... system he OWN ? , you don't own shit . What you trying to say here that blackout is colliding with your RMT operation ?
---
Last weeks saturday was during summer, too.
---
Its unreasonable to bring -10 super campers to a brawl thinking we would take the opportunity to shoot them lel, wolfs wasnt FC btw we went out of our way not to shoot you and your alliance mates everyone else was fair game, then you warp at zero and went for logi and support you signed your own death warrant bro.
---
'right, now if I press F3 and search for 'jpg/mp4' I can download this porn no one wants me to have, for free...'
---
Fresh quote from a one handed master hacker at approximately 3am today.
---
I'm betting that this is sarcasm. I mean goons of all null blocs have the least to worry with their umbrella up, they can't be that dumb... right?
---
Right?
---
Imo dotlan and zkill should refresh information only once a day. There would still be much use for them as third party tool but it would also greatly improve the dangerousness of eve again. Personally, I do not expect my kill board to be live (it is shitty anyway	 :D) 
---
I mean currently it is like that people check dotlan or zkill first before deciding what to do and where to go hunting. Another example is that the first thing you do when you enter a new wormhole is checking zkill. So not only null could be improved but also other parts of space.
---
x doubt
---
I want this as an option in client settings !
---
We had a lot more roaming going on 4 years ago. Human behavior didn't change in that time, but the game did. Specifically capitals got a massive buff to application, FAX were introduced, mining moved from barges into mega tanked rorqs and stations were scrapped in favor of citadels. When a roaming gang shows up now you don't form a gang of your own, you drop super alts on them until they leave. CCP designed supers to be the easiest, safest and most effective way to fight *anything*, so that's what people do.
---
Same at the sov warfare level. The way it's designed titan count is all that matters, so if you know you haven't got the titans to beat the other guys your only option is to avoid the fight altogether. So that's what people do. Maybe if titans were vulnerable to ewar at least, people would have ways to level the playing field and take more fights. But again, it's a game design problem. 
---
And once the hype from the local change wears off we'll be in the same boat again. Maybe a few less botters in space, but besides that all this is going to do is drive even more people into capitals living under a super umbrella.
---
If they are available in external esi or some public database you can easily make/use tools that will give you all the information what you want , while you move.              
---
You will not check 20 jumps ahead ingame easily, but you will get popup from some tools that will tell you if there is gatecamp 2jumps around your route.           
---
Zkill will also tell you if this guy that you want to engage is a hunter that is just baiting you or not.
---
The social aspect of null? What you mean the salt and shit-talking? :bigthink:
---
Say hello with lasers and artillery fire.
---
With 4,000 DPS on grid you probably don't have to do steps 2 and 4.
---
that's just silly ;p
---
oops, did I touch a nerve?

They ran out to get skillbooks for dic’s and cov ops cloaks.
---
If you install Linux, configure wine and all that, sure you might manage to make it run, at that point they would be better off getting a referb windows laptop and saving themselves the trouble.
---
The whole point was they wanted a cheap second laptop that can run Eve, they didn’t know the difference between a Chromebook and a normal laptop, so I doubt they want to dive into Linux at this time.
---
true that- blasters *are* the best weapon afterall
---
Null was never a space for new players until it became safer than HiSec, good to see things returning in the right direction.  Part of the reason for LowSec dying has been new people jumping straight into Null rather than testing the waters in Low first.
---
No this can be only limited by CCP.      
---
Without it you can script excel to pull this data from esi like every 30minutes.
---
?? Multi-boxing is perfectly fine. I presume you were supposed to say broadcasting.
---
le hidden gem!
---
Why not go to lowsec?
---
&gt;A large part of the social aspect of null is gone.
---
As a test pilot, i can guarantee you that the local sperg is alive and healthy
---
That's true, I don't think OP will go anywhere near linux in the near future, but you can still definitely run eve on a x86 chromebook
---
That is becoming an option more and more, yes. But is that the result that everyone wants out of this? Driving people out of null?
---
High Noon for leet hackers.
---
Not all of us and you know that.
---
Volta blue to 70% of nullsec lol
---
#WE SEE HERE YET ANOTHER GOON MAD AT THE BLACKOUT. SPEAKS VOLUMES THAT THE KRAB ALLIANCE HATES IT.
---
“Polo”
---
Something unrelated but will probably peak your interest but this blackout shows that CCP really need to rework anoms and howlong they take to respawn it starts to get really silly when people can just stay bunched in afew systems and not worry about over crowding
---
Krabbing has stagnated the game because space is entirely too uniform in value and ISK is entirely too easy to generate. Fat cats don't fight. 
---
I'm far less certain that supercapital umbrellas will be able to protect ISK. These systems rely on a certain amount of pilot awareness. If pilots are being tackled every minute there is jack shit jump-based responses can do about it. If pilots will krab as hard as they have been, there will be groups which tackle them every minute. 
---
Ultimately, beyond all speculation, the cheese has moved. This is good, the game changed, people are talking about it. If it works, if it doesn't work, both are fine and then change the game again. As long as the map and the rule set remain stagnate, the game will eventually find a position of stagnation.
---
WTB: A Mumble/TS plugin that polls ESI for your location, and moves you to a channel with everyone in that system that's also on comms.
---
MFW some people on /r/eve *want bots to exist in the game*
---
Or maybe more fucking krabs and bots didn't login compared to pvp players- Sounds like progress to me
---
I am sorry but is this Wow you want to play or fucking Eve Online ?
---
I agree with your premise, that people typically create a situation that cause stagnation, however, the suggestion behind it, that local will somehow make isk less easy to generate is a false one. The idea that there will be groups attacking people under the same umbrella every minute is also a false one. It just doesnt and wont happen outside of a concerted attack by another large block. 
---
I would like your view on eve, it would be great to see it like you do. However, I've played far too long to think like that anymore. The only way for players to be forced into risking everything is for CCP to make a system that causes it, because players will not do it otherwise, and no local will not change that one bit.
---
type inject.VNI[botCheckLocal.py](https://RMTbotChecklocal.py) into local to really get the full local list.
---
MFW you still didnt learn that bots are not affected
---
who has blues anyways ?
---
Tell that to the empty regions in renting/frat space
---
Okay let me rephrase
---
It doesnt affect any bots whose coders are worth more then a pile of shit
---
We got them turned off. You're welcome!
---
As it stands nullsec became as safe, if not safer than, hi-sec. People honestly think that everyone should have and be using a super or a titan in nullsec. This no local puts a lot more risk out for this things. We are seeing the early days but the longer term element of this is that nullsec could be a lot more dangerous and dynamic. There's space to live in the cracks between massive alliances and there's a lot possibility about actual occupation of space. The wilderness between empires not alliance borders being the end of one territory and the next.
---
i'm gonna make this very simple so that even someone as thick as you can hopefully understand:
---
a) picking on renters and having the slumlords show up does not count as a batphone, and you're utterly fucking retarded for not putting 2 and 2 together on this matter  
---
b) it doesn't count as a win (at least not one you should be proud of, but that doesn't seem to matter to you) if the majority of the forces on your side belong to people who aren't primary belligerents, instead just random parties who you invited along
---
&gt; whose coders are worth more then a pile of shit
---
  Which is how many? 
---
  You can't Dscan cloaked ships mate.
---
Noone flies into null and says hello to a new player. Or decides to go mine with strangers.
---
Local is used for pasting memes. Nothing else.
---
okay cool so literally all 8-10 of you are out on reddit morale posting? great participation numbers
---
Man the fuck up, and put your excavs out
---
That part of the change has been discussed in countless posts already. That't not what this post is about.
---
If that's your experience, than I'm glad we don't live in the same part of space obviously.
---
80 mill so, still plenty to train
---
This sounds like a you problem. Afk and not on coms can be done in hs, not in the dangerous nullsec
---
Actually I own your tears so ur paying up krablet
---
They own your salt for sure
---
Join in game chat channels.
---
Local or not, average goons krab just use standing fleet and cyno as intel
---
Bots are far more prevalent in nullsec because it's easier and more profitable to do so in null.
---
Some bears are playing other games, some are also fighting and having fun, some are also ninja ratting. Many I have talked to think this is a "weekend only" and are waiting it out. Give it time and the reward vs the risk starts to tempt them again.
---
Sure you can't super rat or rorq mine completely safely anymore but hey risk vs reward :)
---
bad bot :P

You are allowed to start chat channels, used to be I had about 40 open in a few lines.
---
Add those randoms to pub chats etc, no reason you cant wave there.
---
Wow 😂 someone watched the meta show and resplurged it onto here
---
great work dude
---
They own your very little brain
---
We always baited so this doesn’t change our behavior. It has reduced kills in null because lack of targets and scope of information being reduced to put bait in front of a roaming gang. I have logged on less hunters.
---
I haven't, to be honest. Got a link?
---
Fair point, but then we'd have to be on the same grid together first to be able to see eachother
---
They’re definitely American
---
I see you haven't met StainGuy before.
---
I wish he would start going back to talking about gates.
---
I bet some idiot did it tho... just waiting for a screen shot :)
---
Well, then it's easy to fix the game. Remove permanent loss. Fixed.
---
This was done on purpose in an attempt to keep mega corps from spreading out.
---
How do you figure?
---
Getting boson'd in Delve is PVP activity. An uptick in this due to low IQ hunters isn't really an improvement of any sort.
---
Might leave it for another year.
---
Would affect specific ships roles and literally make them worthless, bombers, scanners, recons etc. Think before you post.
---
Maybe we shouldn't send new players to null?
---
shouldve changed a script or two to tracking speed when trying to shoot nightmares
---
People spreading out adds risk seems pretty asinine to add a mechanic that lessens it in a game like eve
---
Man so many replies to this idiot who are too stupid to realize this is a grrr gon troll account or are playing along with his farce in bad faith.
---
Honestly, I could have an entire fleet in system waiting for a trap and just accept everyone having to respond polo.
---
Were space pirates, not heathens.
---
Sure, sounds like a good way to make some stories.
---
Like yesterday I was roaming around Providence and trying my best to hunt down a phoon, I find him and oh look it's a player I used to fly against a few years ago, his gang comes in and we have to disengage. We chat a bit of smack in a pub channel we both lurk in. Had I known it was him from the start I prolly would have just waved and left system knowing that he baits hard most of the time.
---
Did a crate drop? Could just snag some bad citadel mods.
---
I know why it was hard to find content. Everyone within 10 gates of your current location would dock up in any of the dozen or more citadels in each system.
---
It's a double ruse so good it would meme Kojima blush.
---
Dotlans deltas are just the 30 minute number over the 24 hour number aren't they? That's of course available in game.
---
You've never lived in Provi, then.
---
Every wormholes, lowseccer, elite pvp/small gang pvp shitler will now downvote your post to the bottom because diverging opinions on Reddit are to be censored. If you want CCP to see your feedback, post on the official forums. 
---
Reddit is only for brigading opinions you agree with.
---
What would be the point of diplomacy if one guy gets to decide on an ad-hoc basis who shoots whom?
---
So crabbing isn’t a play style which is the current target?
---
99% of people are not going to do even that simple computation using the in game map.
---
hahahaha #nolocal still not good ? demand more, bois: supers nerf, titan nerf, constellation wide cyno inhibitors, wormholes that can open only to Delve and on demand, if possible, via a special filament, come on, there are lots of ideas...
---
Expensive to build and fuel means all of delve and other megabloc regions have them up everywhere almost instantly, leaving everyone else behind. I'm against such a structure unless the balance was from something other than cost.
---
And some just isn't skilled enough and feel they have to leave salt behind in comments.
---
In a game where you can do almost anything why would you do missions that lock you into hardwired role-playing steps?
---
True that.
---
Fuck it. I am resubbing.

---
the problem with your logic is that the kind of "content" encouraged by these changes is gate camping and excavator bombing
---
i don't think those are healthy for the game tbh
---
i think your opinions on the game are retarded and I question your stage of evolution but this is correct and does not get talked about enough.
---
Reddit is a terrible place for useful discussion. People seem to forget that your not meant to downvote based on opinion.
---
roamed into horde space last night with 25 fed navy comets and 2 ceptors. we camped their jump gate in 1SU and killed a bunch of stuff, went down the pipe, empty AF. This, after we traveled all the way from Fade (empty) to KQK and then Tribute(empty), Geminate(empty), Kalevala... 
---
We said, lets go back to their staging and get killed, we didn't want to reach home with the ships. One gate camp in LEM, Nagflar on the gate (horde), a bunch of frigates from different corps screaming on local: "kill the nag, shoot only the nag".  I got blapped by the nag in my hull tanked comet. I would loved to have died to a bunch of smaller ships tho.  So, all in all, was fun as hell when we actually found someone to shoot. 90% we traveled.
---
I don’t enjoy PvP. I enjoy PvE more. I help on fleets and do PvE. I’m staying logged off until the situation changes. Without a compensating change to allow me to defend myself I’m too vulnerable to being instantly deleted without the prewarning to initiate warp. The rewards in a sub cap mining or ratting vessel are not worth it.
---
Sure, but the guy I replied to said it was no available in-game, so I was responding that it is available.
---
an actual blackout
---
Lol how is that a compromise?  You’re acting like the existence of wormholes is the reason local was taken away XD.  Or is it you think no local is the only difference between wormholes and null?
---
Also there’s nothing stopping you light a cyno in one, just jump in and try it, I’ve heard it has to be a pretty bling ship though or the cyno just doesnt activate
---
The information needed to calculate it is. The deltas themselves are not. There is a big difference between available and calculable.
---
it's not for you to decide, it's how CCP looks at bank account numbers and most importantly, how the new owner looks at them.
---
you forgot about gate camping and baiting.
---
Properly piloted, frig v battleships are actually fairly matched. If the frig and battleships are cap stable, there might actually be a stalemate where the battleships just can't hit the frig and the frig can't do enough damage to break the battleship. This wasn't the case here, that Imp can do a pretty good amount of damage.
---
A mwd battleship with heavy neut can start pulling range by neuting out the AB frig, it wasn't the case here either, no neuts on a Rattlesnake.
---
The only option left is that the frig should've killed the battleship because it can do enough damage to break the tank and the battleship can't really apply on the frig, unless it's a completely, very rare, RNG wrecking shot.
---
It's effectively the same thing. If you can get the information all in the game client without polling the API, I would consider that "available in-game".
---
i believe it is about the bots, not about making null great again. come on guys, be realistic !
---
I bet it works flawlessly in TEST space.
---
I'm proud of you.  I can go isk positive huffing gas with a Machariel in wormholes.  Doesn't mean I should.  Link killmail when it dies please.
---
hi , nightmare fc here
---
maybe you know i shoot everything on grid unless i explicitly asked for temp blue beforehand.  #fuckbluesbtw  
---
BUT nevertheless my alliance has set your bois blue , so i didnt shoot them, on the other hand , you had purple helmeted chromosome warriors in your fleet who are set -10 to us which basically tells me to clap them extra hard . when u then warped at 0 to us to force us of your batphones caps ... i saw that as an act of aggression from an otherwise exalted ally and saw my self forced to shoot you bois. it also didnt help that you fly the ONLY huginn in your fleet as the fc ... that just screams pls headshot me btw.  
---
also... we both know in the endless magnitude of the multiverse , theres not 1 single timeline in which i would have not clapped you bois back to derelik . so stop bousting about killing our fleet..... move to an area where u can get constant combat and hone your skills.   
---
in other words , move out of that shithole and come to the warzone , and fight , all day err day.

---
I understand your point. I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm saying it won't be done. Your comment replied to the guy who said it wasn't available. I expanded on that. I'm not disagreeing with you just clarifying.
---
No, I think this person is Scottish.
---
I think its funny that the old wreck icon is still more iconic than the new one.
---
Thats probably what the KKK wanted to do back in the day
---
Well, I haven't ever dealt with them in null, but in low security systems this alliance fleet up with a bunch of people seemingly unrelated to each other - V a l I n o r, CalMil, neutral folks and corporations. After a closer look at all these people it turned out that they just unites based on their ethic origin - they all are Chinese.
---
&gt;In a game where you can do almost anything
---
got lucky since AFAIK if you decline those missions you can never do them again
---
It's "you're", you idiot.
---
I'm sorry, not true.
---
You cannot sell ANYTHING outside the game for ingame ISK.
---
Just pay squizzi for premium and get your own zkill bot for discord. It's not hard or expensive

I just switch back to 32 bit - restart resolved it

I feel like a winner now seeing the losses on both sides.

---
I found myself at eveuni website looking at standard fits again. I kept hearing people being asked to link kms repeatedly as there was no central reference. If anything it reminded me how important zkill is to my eve experience and without the website, the same loses luster. I don't want to play eve without zkill.
---
Hi I'm the multiboxer. Quit eve about 4 months ago when they cancelled the AT and general shittiness of the game. Came back for Blackout.

This is one of my 10-box doctrines. I have many kinds, much more deadly than this (which thx to no zkill no one can seeeee). I've been using this doctrine to gank VNI/other ratters. Just before seeing you I found a Rorq team guarded by an Avatar. You were the better target ROFL.

I knew how the downvoting would go even before I posted it. It's all good. I know some will downvote even when they agree with me, just because they see others have downvoted. I'm not here for the karma points. If even a couple of nerds consider what I say and try to look at it from that perspective, I consider that op success.
---
They told me Blackout would only remove local, not brain cells, but here we are...
---
downvoted
---
Ahh.. remember the times when you could see the hostiles in local? Good times.
---
I agree on the fuelling front, I'm not sure that it should ALWAYS stay away either.  
---
I saw an interesting thought on another thread, if you activate it for a system, the system data (NPC kills, jumps, etc) then becomes available on the in game map (and available to out of game tools).  
---
Maybe take it another step and make it delayed information for everyone but if you activate the local chat then it's instant or something.
---
maybe you just dont have enough to grasp the depth of the above text, want some of my brain cells I clearly have way too many for myself.
---
what a dumb idea

Could have fooled me with the spamming v key every gcd

How do you identify hole size?

I resubbed, what have i done :D
---
I have :D
---
"a lot more like wormhole space".. no, no it's not.
---
I resubbed,  hopefully they keep the changes and encourages them to take more risks
---
upvoted &lt;3
---
Wow!!! Goons are that large?Who knew. 
---
I did notice in Oasa that Code has or had Sov. In one system.  Most odd.
---
so the differences I can think of are.
---
* lack of npc gate connections
---
* some have special effects
---
that's it right ?, you might argue the anomalies and rats are different but yeah they are different across all the null and low sec regions as well so I honestly don't live in a wormhole clearly so if there is other big differences explain them.
---
don't ever attempt to use your brain again
---
tbh i hope you are kidding
---
Any third party service that intentionally degrades service on the application side will eventually just be supplanted by a new one that doesn't.  CCP could certainly change it on their end, but this is not the app developers' job.
---
Clearly
---
Gatecamping is the lowest form of pvp.
---
gatecamper btw
---
This is 100% on point.
---
Totally agree, great post.
---
But are you actually sure you want to board your corvette?
---
Yup did the same except went a step further and unsubbed the mining accounts.  Just have one active sub and largely haven’t logged on except to shuffle Indy jobs.
---
If you have 50 accounts, why are you worried about no local?  
---
You don't own the system,  
---
It's called dscan,  
---
And it's apparently you who is eating a bag of dicks.
---
Yikes...
---
Well let’s be honest they’re already well documented game haters and quitters.  
---
Won’t take much frankly
---
You spelt macro wrong
---
To be fair, reddit was hyped for the blackouts.  Looking at the online player counts, you'd think people didn't like it or something.
---
The problem with playing solo in a sandbox game is that everyone is looking for two things.
---
1: a challenge where there is a chance to win
---
2: easy kills since those are fun  too
---
By going around solo you really limit the number of either of the two things above that you will find.
---
No one knowssss
---
You’re a fucking idiot.  Keep digging
---
I completely agree with OP. nothing more to add.
---
nice kill
---
Got a list of specifications? 
---
I doubt many people commit the specs. of every laptop ever.
---
Well or he has to show up at something that was previously not understood to be a condition of getting paid.  
---
Like they only hand out paychecks for a weeks worth of work at a church on Sunday for example.  After the sermon.  Because the boss thinks people need Jesus so it’s imposed on everyone.
---
Squizz knows, but he's keeping the secrets to himself for the time being.
---
\&gt;Inspect &gt; Current populace &gt; just turns down black number from something like 20% to 0%
---
Obviously I didn't to the mission.
---
Im not sure about specs, I do know eve isn’t very demanding on a whole. I can run two or three clients just fine on my pretty much bricked dell when I’m on the road but check out r/laptopdeals when you are ready to make a purchase. You might be able to get a little more bang for your buck.
---
Yes
---
It does on /r/eve.
---
I dunno, was pretty exciting to have 3 accounts in the middle of X47 fights, especially since one was my newly acquired first titan.
---
It was wrong then too.
---
It has a 2gb dedicated GPU (mx 150)and a i5 8250u 8gb of ram as well.
---
And it was wrong then too
---
* IHubs.
---
* Sov Upgrades. 
---
* Cynosural Fields and Jump Drives.
---
Fix things that are broke in one update, then break them again in the next, so you can repeat the cycle with minimal effort?
---
SOUNDS LIKE CCP AMIRITE BOIS

I'm trying to remember who it was who used to fc from a old mac book with jabber on his phone (or maybe a super ghetto second mini monitor).

You aren't going to get any use out of a chromebook. I honestly think you might be better off just buying a slipfigure (and or ruggedized) real laptop with normal specs, it will be a lot more expensive than a chromebook, but you'll get the kind of mileage you need. I don't mean to sound like a salesman, I'm just talking purely from my experience as a shitty laptop owner lmao
---
If everyone moves to lowsec, I might start playing again. \\o/
---
It was that so more alliances could fit into fewer systems. Thus taking away the need for massive sprawl.
---
Fam you can look at any part of the map that's not directly owned by FRT or Pamfam  
---
and say they are supported by goons to indicate a bias  
---
What a sad state of eve
---
I have this same issue, I think the character maker is kinda performance fucky for everyone, and we all just accept that it runs at 2 frames and walk away with a cool looking portrait never to change it.
---
Too little time has passed base these sorts of decisions upon.

So apart from lack of NPC gates, NPCs and NPC site types, special effects, system upgrades, ihubs, cynos, covert cynos, jump clone accessibility and asset safety, wormholes are exactly the same?

That resolution! You poor thing! :o

Don't play it above 1080p and you should be fine.
---
a) I don't disagree with you that it is fair for the rental owners to show up to defend their renters. It is the batphone that entity makes, or NC calling the rest of panfam, that I'm talking about. But that's beyond the point -- unspoken was picking a fight, with a small group of allies, and to continue to pick that fight they needed groups that could help them contest with phorde and others showing up to timers. That seems pretty obvious.
---
b) I also don't disagree that it was not done by unspoken alone. Nobody is really claiming that. The simple fact of the matter is that if NC alone showed up to timers, along with BOT of course, the small coalition formed between Unspoken, Lazerhawks, JAG and a few others were generally willing to take that fight — and saw some success. But when those numbers start to become totally ridiculous, like panfam showing up with 500 dudes, it is not even close to feasible to expect success while requiring the majority to be primary belligerents.

I'm old and tired of trying to live on the bleeding edge and having to constantly troubleshoot my PC, so when it went black I said fuck it. I can run 3 Eve clients on it while having Chrome open and casting to my Chromecast. To be fair, I got it on sale for $999 but it does the trick for me and I've been happy with it. The one thing I didn't like is that it only has 1 USB 3 port but it also has a USB C port so I just bought a 4 Port hub and it works fine. Hope this helps!
---
Is this what triglavian bods look like? i assumed they looked more human and they wore the full shirt like the capsuleers do.
---
either way i still look like this dude but much more pale jesus
---
Just try it out before going on your travels, perhaps? I know basically every APU laptop can run eve just fine (the first series of AMD APUs could run dirt rally). 
---
If you want max graphics that's another story, but potato mode goes great as long as you have enough video card memory and system memory to load the game up and not crash constantly.
---
That goes both ways.... People use zKillboard to find fights as well. The solution isn't delaying kill feed etc. Its in the amount of information that is posted via the killmail itself to zkill.   
---
People want to see when that stupid goon super dies. People want to see that epic fight developing half way across eve almost in real time as if they were there themselves. That is half the excitement of the game.   
---
If you really want a positive change nerf the system and the location of a kill. Leave it to region based information that forces people to use the in game tools (aka map) to find players in space.
---
Better nate than lever
---
It's weird that people are asking for killmails to be delayed when thousands of people signed up to zkill to ensure that their killmails get posted instantly.
---
Maybe CCP could make kill mail information "opt in". 
---
By default , only the victim will receive a full kill mail, the aggressor will just get an abbreviated mail showing where the kill happened, who was involved, and what DROPPED. Items that were destroyed will not be listed.
---
If you choose to opt in, then your full fitting will be included in the killmail to the aggressor.
---
How can you dislike that??
---
Argumentative
---
Mass limits, maximum jump mass, anoms taking hours to respawn and getting podded means you're back in high sec possibly with no way home. 
---
But aside from all that I guess it's basically the same.
---
Please show where these fights (that previously weren’t happening) are taking place.
---
Damn he is right, null = wormholes now
---
The cloacky campaign that caused SMA a lot of trouble is what I would call a succsessfull example of guerilla warfare.
---
Local doesn't help the small groups against titans either.
---
To be fair I only have experience living in NPC Null and WHs. But I imagine that being in Null right now is very exciting and which is probably very good for player numbers of small and big groups alike. How it pans out in the long run remains to be seen.
---
Its also zkb, and ultimately CCP making killmails public. There is just way too much free intel in the game.
---
But free intel is back soon, so we go back to "boring" again. Great!
---
As amazing and Awsome as zkill is it is super cool to not have it for a short amount of time same for dotlan . These guys and girls really get eve.
---
No. Im not even going to read it. Just no.

Unpopular opinion: I love this change   
---
It opens a lot more doors compared to what it closes.  
---
Allowing new players to enter null, without fears of death blobs or automatically docking players when you get 5 jumps within their range. All this is good for Pvp and pve alike. From pirates to miners.  
---
Also a big F U to all those doing botting!
---
***CRACKS FORMING?***
---
I'm liking the fact we don't know, you don't know what is going on 1, 2 or 40  jumps away even in low sec
---
Tell it brother.
---
Unfortunately this is what happens when diplomacy becomes the new meta. Big blocks gain even more power, and everyone has some sort of established relationships, be it hostile, friendly, or neutral with some sort of agreements, with one another.

Nah, there are plenty of good tattoo artists that specialize in cover-up designs.

I see what you're saying, but I don't think it is really hurting the social aspect MORE THAN IT IS HELPING IT. It certainly does reduce the random convos that used to happen between a newbie explorer or a small gang trying to set up a honorabru fight or silly conversations as two ships pass in the night or whatever. But it is helping the social aspect by bringing corps together more to get out there roaming (or defending).
---
I think what this is doing is reducing how "alive" null feels when you simply are hanging out or passing through. I've always said that highsec is cool in some ways, mainly that it feels alive: lots of folks who don't know each other are in local, on undocks, landing on gates, etc. It's only ever been like that in the busiest lowsec and nullsec constellations, with most of the space being totally dead. It's of course never been like that in jspace except maybe in thera. The local change for null will make space feel more dead unless you're actively doing something with your pals, but I'm not sure that is a very high price to pay if the activity and excitement over the blackout stays even half as strong as it is now.

more things than I was aware of thats kinda cool, are you saying you cant build supers and titans inside a wormhole ?
---
The Blackout doesn't bother me but when they release a Police SKIN for the Catalyst imma smash that up thumb so hard...
---
This is a poor representation of this mechanic. This mechanic is devastating to smaller ships staying in lock range of big ships with big guns, but doesn't even tickle the big ship. It'll essentially be Luke flying in the trench, but is instantly vaporized by a turret on the other side of the death star (ignoring the fact that the shot is out of the turret's firing arc or that the turret has to shoot through the whole death star to get him, but because the RNG says so).
---
Yeah he’s the one struggling I’m sure... 
---
Wow
---
Who's the idiot, some one who had a "Random thought" and shared it, or the idiot who treated a random thought like it was meant to be eureka divine inspirational moment.
---
being able to drop on everything creates less pvp content than it suppresses
---
Delayed means late or slow, yes. But there's nothing that says a delay can't be of indefinite duration. And that's exactly what delayed local is. The delay in your name showing up in local lasts until you talk in local. It makes perfect sense.
---
Of the larger things. 1 titan. 6 S-carriers. 1AT ship.
---
There could be more
---
Suspect baiting in starter systems.
---
I think it would be hysterical if that was the ONE ship in all of new eden to not have a police skin.
---
Do it one at a time
---
I think the reason it is so strong is that the shots ignore tracking and range restrictions. Would't be too bad if wrecking shots multiply the damage you already do.
---
That's the joke.
---
Okay bud, I'm sure you're going to consistently write down all the npc kills for every system in even 1 region periodically and compare the values. You know god damn well that that information isn't going to be maintained by any source that isn't fully automated.
---
Think of the children!!!
---
They should delay API information directly in game, when a Ihub/TCU is entosis, a structure is attacked, players killmail...  
---
let's be honnest you can't sneaky bash a ennemy structure when their entire discord receive a message " X is attacked!"
---
first day was great with everyone trying it out. second day was meh. 
---
probably just another way of selling more plex by making mining and ratting even less fun.
---
Yeah. Totally this.
---
I mean, it's not exactly a secret that everyone has fond memories of their early days in any given game, or in the genre of MMOs, etc. Why is that? The mystery, man. When players are noobs, third-party resources are limited, the game/genre isn't yet fully understood... you just play the game and live in the moment and learn the old-fashioned way.
---
Now there's nothing wrong with players "solving" things and unraveling the formulae governing turret to-hit mechanics and whatever. But it also seems like there's no good reason for CCP to push players further from the glorious ignorance they had when they and/or the game were new and 'round every corner was something awe-inspiring. Nobody can see their first titan a second time, or lose their first ship again, etc. You can't unring a bell. But CCP could at least leave players in a bit more of a fog of war so that when they see their second titan and lose their second ship, they at least didn't know it was coming an hour before it happened.
---
Make Eve Mysterious Again?
---
As a lowsec-only player who has no interest in going to null... I'm happy you're happy.
---
It might not affect me in the slightest, but I'm glad to see people talking so positively about the game again. Maybe some of that positivity will rub off onto me.
---
Oh, I get that. I used to use a Rorqual on my own personal moon, and have also done VNI ratting and Super ratting. It bored me to death so I stopped, but never did it AFK. I am for any measure CCP comes up with to remove passive or AFK methods of income.
---
Fewer virus, more PH.

Trust me.

Sorry  shitty european writing eglish

Yep now try this entire week without the hype — pvpers can’t find anything and the ratters docked.
---
Good for pve?
---
You never played in a public pool as a kid, did you?

It is doubtful that anyone outside of those participating will ever have this level of enthusiasm again. Gambling makes this more exciting.

So it helped because you got to shoot instead of never engaged. See OP? System works.

Seeing as how the hosts are both FOR the change I'm not sure what your point is here.

Yeah. There's more profit potential from posting a sell order and competing with everyone else selling it, but then you have to babysit the order and modify it every time someone undercuts you. Much easier to just hit the sell button somewhere that there are buy orders.

TL:DR Click the wormhole, -&gt; show info. The last line will say if the hole is medium, large, or very large. 
---
Going to go more in depth because it may be helpful. 
---
For the size of the hole, select a wormhole and hit show info. This page shows you four main details, listed below. The first is “this wormhole leads to unknown/dangerous unknown/deadly space. 
---
Unknown = C1-3. 
---
Dangerous Unknown = C4-5
---
Deadly= C6. 
---
The second is if the hole is “end of life,” meaning less than four hours until it collapses due to time. It will say something along the lines of “wormhole is reaching the end of its natural life”. 
---
Third is approximately how much mass has been put on the hole. Wormholes have a maximum mass of ships they can take until they collapse. If it says “stability reduced” it has taken at least half of its total mass. “Critically disrupted” means it has less than 10% mass remaining, and is dangerous to travel through unprepared. 
---
Lastly is the size. A C1 will say “up to medium sized ships may enter” (Up to Battlecruisers and down, no battleships or capitals). C2-4 will say “larger ships may enter” (Up to battleships, no capitals). C5-6 hole’s they don’t connect to a c1-4 will say “very large ship may enter,” (Up to Capitals)
---
and hopefully some more after the bears come out to rat when they get hungry again :)
---
Anywhere but this subreddit, 😁
---
Your humour detection switched off?
---
Then don't. Kenshi is a pretty cool game, there is mining. There is also Minecraft if you don't mind shitty graphics. Obviously the shitty gameplay doesn't turn you off, you play Eve after all.
---
If it's pay to use local then it's only a matter of time before nullblocs abuse the mechanic in order to further entrench themselves in the no-risk-nullsec gameplay they've become so dependent on. 
---
That defeats the entire purpose.
---
Paying to use local is something I'm not surprised to see people wanting, since so many people live under the no-risk-nullsec umbrella. 
---
I just hope you don't get your wish.
---
I love the two-voice harmonies of the original. Also I feel in Disturbed's version his voice grates in my ear.
---
It depends what you want from the game. Most bigger corps will provide you with some kind of mentoring to help you get in. For example Dreddit has mentoring / hands outs to get new players started. You should swing by dredditisrecruiting.com and check out our discord, its extremely active and are always willing to help out new players.
---
Only highlights and clips unfortunately from what I can see =[
---
Where do you get that it is a two week thing from?
---
Definitely that too
---
no but not like it was before, but in the new way as it's done on event sites - no matter where your bm is, the warp in on the gate grid is at 15 km :))))
---
matter of fact - do that with wormholes to, why stop the harassment at null 
---
crazy reddit people :))
---
Agree wit this. It's been really enjoyable "flying blind" without the aid of zkill/dotlan
---
Yeah I know mass etc restrictions wasn't just sure how to classify them, will be more useful for filling tripwire.
---
V vor vlash of light
---
That last bit is why no local is beautiful. Now you have no idea what is waiting when you engage. Is it a ratting VNI bot? Or is there a 50 man HAC/logi gang waiting outside dscan range? 
---
Now, you can punch a fleet in the face with arties, warp off to a safe and refit cloaks, and escape. Or surprise a gate camp with several combat recons and wreck them. 
---
The uncertainty and the scenarios it creates are beautiful.
---
Every dead super makes eve a better game
---
It's probably increasing the risk by not being able to know where is empty but also you're a bit safer because people won't know you're in system without scanning you down.
---
I'd say on the whole more people will get caught by gankers and killed. But this will increase the prices of salvaged items, blueprints and ores from null so might make the whole thing more worthwhile.
---
These are indeed dark times when Stainguy is making sense....
---
Their INCOME is higher. How many employees you have has zero bearing on income.
---
Just move to NPC 0.0 or wh space if you want this content
---
I just checked it with a bad pun and it works fine.
---
Local had a social aspect in null?    If so, it was akin to the social aspect of graffiti on a toilet stall wall.
---
I'm not missing that.
---
Focus on one specific thing that you want to do to not get overwhelmed. 
---
Eve-Uni website and lectures is one of the best sources of information for newbros. You can listen to the lectures while you set up your stuff or just follow along.
---
I recomend Faction Warfare for the start:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzD5lZJO0q0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzD5lZJO0q0) 
---
And yeah join a corp that is doing what you are doing. The ingame corpfinder should work just fine.
---
Nah at least you have to actually interact with stuff.
---
Gatecamping you literally just sit and get drunk as fuck and hope something jumps into you.
---
baited
---
The other option is to do a mix of both, Which is available with the Data CCP gives right now.
---
You could do normal killmails like now, But delayed by a few hours, But then use the :number of kills/system: data in a more vague way to build :Number of kills/region: and make a generalised heatmap that shows what regions have big fights happening, But not exact details
---
And then they killed these changes by adding citadels. So.
---
God damn it, I knew i recognized that link....
---
No.  If you want to stop someone warping to zero, use a bubble, either anchor it or take a dictor with you.  If you want to stop everything, argue to remove interdiction nullification.
---
You need to make at least some effort I think.
---
That was a perfect pun, no accounting for why the negativity
---
If you are spinning a vni, you arent maximizing anything.
---
I don't really think most of the drop are bot.
---
It's not mostly bot. Bot don't care of no local they just need to change area or be recode to adapt.
---
Plenty of real people out n about everywhere iv been so far. Actual fights... delayed ratters... real scouts. I love it
---
The EVE University wiki https://wiki.eveuniversity.org is one of the most used EVE websites in the game. I've never been a member of their in-game corp, but I've talked to several who have and it's a good learning experience. 
---
There are a lot of corporations that accept completely new dudes. If you're looking for a large null bloc experience, Dreddit only has a 15mil sp OR relatively active Reddit account. If you can't match that, Brand Newbros has more lax requirements. Brave, Goons and Pandemic Horde also have very-new player friendly corporations.
---
A lot of real player have stop , or just conenct 1 account. 
---
At end of the day you hit more real player than bot.  So you do'nt fuck really fuck bot who could be recode or go bot other part of space.
---
It's not weird at all. People enjoy the "mystery" of no zkill and local and stuff, but not enough that they're willing to forego using those things when they're opponents don't have to.
---
It is... amazing! Love the change.
---
Squizz said the backend is still working so dont worry, your precious killboard will be just as red as everyone elses
---
But what happens to those gate camps is the important part. I guess the bombers too but those are harder to catch. 
---
The gate camps are people. Undocked. In space. And they get counter stacked. It’s amazing.
---
Shh
---
TLDR; If you're risk averse and too scared to undock solo because you might lose a ship, then the blackout is annoying.
---
The game never catered to only one type of player, it catered to casual players through HS and LS. Those always were stepping stones to bigger things (NS and wormholes, when they were released).
---
Speaking of catering to one group of people (nullsec empire builders), that's all CCP's been doing for the past few years. And what happened is exactly like you described it, people left and the game is fucked (for that type of gameplay). People leaving because their favourite gameplay got nerfed or ignored by CCP is definitely a thing. Do you know how vibrant LS used to be? Roaming in lowsec and nullsec was a thing, you could roam in battleships without getting caps dropped on you. Locals showed up to fight in similar subcaps because that was the meta. There were powerful groups in NPC nullsec who fought with sov nullseccers daily. HAW, no more regional ressources and fozzie sov combined with citadels basically made sov nullsec so strong that it was the only real viable way to play in nullsec.
---
All that is basically gone because CCP kept focusing on one area of the game: Sov nullsec.
---
And that's fucking sad and it's what lead to whaling + supercap blobs being the dominant form of pvp in nullsec. Can we both agree that whaling really sucks? For both players. Most whalers would rather fight a subcap roaming fleet vs a defenseless ratter, but it's now basically the only way to get pvp when you're not in sov nullsec yourself.
---
That's how it is supposed to be. It's definitely not the current state of null.
---
The blackout is one of the coolest and best change to ever drop upon us. I really hope CCP does this right going forward and Eve will feel a lot better imo.
---
You can not build supers or titans in wormhole space, they require super capital construction which needs an ihub. Can build carriers but you need to bring in all the parts/resources or mine everything yourself and hopefully have the blueprints. Need a structure to build it, need a structure to dock it. It will never leave wormhole space unless you reprocess it or someone manages to catch and blow you up
---
This is bait, but since you didn't realise that, I'll break it down for you. 
---
Why would a goon care about the blackout? He can cyno in the biggest capital/super/titan fleet in the game and you honestly think he would care at all about your "hunting" fleet the gatecamp killed 15 jumps out? Supposing you dodged the gatecamp you'll be boson'd 13 jumps out instead. 
---
The people who actually care are the small corps and alliances who have no possible way to fight the roaming recons. They can't mine or rat cause they'll just die to a squad of ships that won't show up on d-scan. They can't fight back cause they'll likely be outnumbered or outgunned, and they don't have money to fight t3c, bombers and recons with similar ships, so they'll feed kills in t1 ships or log off.
---
Or likely be forced to join a massive alliance, like Goons. And then once they've moved to goon space, they'll krab in peace. And you might even make it to 10 jumps out before they kill you.
---
Very cool info, thank you. 
---
I had actually started playing around with building my own, but then you told me how to use your's and that's good enough for what I need it for. I live in a WH and as long as I can build for cost I'm fine. Fitting ships in a DST is the problem. I can fit a fleet with compressed ore and BPs instead of bringing them in one at a time. 
---
But, it is an interesting problem and I might tackle it for fun. I hadn't heard of this optimization technique and I might give it a shot to factor in cost and use the 5/10/15% ores.
---
I think Killmails out of game provide more then only "i killed that guy" or so ...
---
It provides good opportunity to check what could have been better in fittings, also good work in tanking abilities of pilots. It gives insight of what people fly, important for directors and recruitment teams.
---
I could never see a kill, where i wasn't the final hit, when whoring on something.
---
So all that are important parts. And sometimes just scrolling through funny or interesting killmails of others.
---
All I did as a new player (still am really) was roam wh and null in a probe. It's not inaccessible, and shouldn't be. But it shouldn't be a place you can go day one and do more or less whatever you want because you joined a nullbear alliance.
---
\&gt; SergalJerk
---
See, with that context it all suddenly makes sense.
---
The owner made a post on here, thinks about implementing a delay. 1 Hour for null, 30 minutes for lowsec and no delay for hisec. I think it would be a great change
---
...you didn't know this?
---
Eve runs in potato on my surface pro. Enough to check contracts and respond to chat.im sure I could mine rocks, but haven't tried yet with the blackout. Wouldn't want to do combat on a small screen.
---
hey I recognize those voices
---
commit stop post
---
I was actually joking with friends on ts "My god. EVE is becoming like youtube."
---
"Remember to like, share and subscribe. And leave a comment about what you think!"
---
To be quite fucking honest?
---
Call it: Forward Observer
---
The local blackout has been great, but as a solo/small gang nullsec pvper, delaying zkill and dotlan really hurts in the effort to fight the blobs. I live in a null static WH, being able to look at where NPC/player kills are happening saves hours of roaming through empty space. Zkill is invaluable to tell if someone is actually going to put up a good fight or if they're just going to drop 4 recons and a bhaalgorn on a solo cruiser (which happened to me yesterday).
---
Nope no clue, wormholes for me are just shortcuts from deep null to highsec.
---
Ih vee jay = u r gay
---
Yes, but not in the way it looks on the surface. Making anything more difficult makes the reward for its efforts more valuable. 
---
So, activities that require more risk, pay more. Those that innovate, get more money, those that don't, die. 
---
End result, if you have a good head on your shoulders and can adjust to the pressure, smart pve'ers will net gain.
---
I'm keeping a close eye on all the discussion on potentially delaying killmails, and I'd like to step in at this point and say this is not correct.
---
To get the details of a killmail you need to have it's hash. You can get that either by someone giving you a killmail and calculating it yourself, or by them giving you an authorization token so you can hit up the /killmails/recent endpoints to get their hashes delivered to you by ESI. This provides the hashes for all killmails they are the final blow on, and all killmails they are the loss on, same as the two tabs in game. Once you have the hashes, you can request the full details through the killmails endpoint.
---
Short version: killmails are not public in ESI.

Squizz is in a position to execute this blackout only because almost all of eve has given him their tokens, either at a personal or corporation level. Because so many people have given zkillboard authorization to scrape their kills automatically, Squizz has a near-total overview of kills in the game **but only because you all voluntarily gave it to him**.
---
So he *could* limit it himself, and no you can't pull the same data he can pull every 30 minutes. Only he has the tokens to pull so much data.
---
*However*, I agree it's not his job to make that decision, nor is it reasonable to ask him to take the pressure of doing so. If killmails should be limited, it should be done upstream so it's fair for everyone. 
---
Information dump over, please return to robust discussion :)
---
Brave killed a titan, think that's the biggest so far
---
Gotcha! Did you ever play Rift? I played that for the large scale "random" pve. Before it went to shit.
---
They're gone, but by focusing on other areas of space, you can bring them back. It's really lame that whaling and supercap blobs are the dominant forms of pvp in null.
---
CCP thought by focusing on what makes the news (big fights in-between sov nullsec groups), they would have more players but the exact opposite has happened because so many other players that were in the background  of these big wars were completely ignored. 
---
The highsec wardec changes were years too late, because most hs people either left for null, or left the game. Solo and small-gang pvp was basically ignored. NPC nullsec was basically ignored. Wormholes were basically ignored. 
---
Really, CCP focused way too much on sov nullsec and all of the small groups that used to live in the other areas left for nullsec or left the game. Together these groups were as important as all other groups in nullsec, but they've basically been ignored and left. Focus on those areas and a lot of people will come back.
---
I've got lots of bad fittings for you haha. Phantasm is the most fun ship to shitfit and whelp.
---
Wow 2011.08.15, is that video still relevant?
---
The botters are just moving to lvl 5 missions.  Set scan to 1 au, warp out if someone shows up on scan.
---
It's ok if you don't resub.
---
Battleships, they are great for both PVE and many alliances use at least one battleship doctrine for PVP
---
Faction Warfare didn't change much. But you can check the website if you want to make sure.
---
Squizz can't delay zkillboard.com without harming his own product, because the large nullblocs are just going to make their own killboards, because the data is extremely valuable and important to them. Y'all at CCP will need to take the burden of limiting information.
---
Depends on what you fly and you can generally get a few T1 frigate fights in the mix. Even if you do get blown up, you've just lost a few mils at most and you get the chance to kill a pirate frig worth multiple times your own ship.
---
I agree that CCP should delay the killmails API I think they are fine as long as say there is say at least 1 hour before a kill shows up on the API.  Dotlan however is just in game information presented in a much more readable format which I think is perfectly fine and is what the API is intended is for (or in otherwords please don't make me at a glance determine the difference between light-orange and light-orange-brown once the old map goes away).
---
&gt;Flying blind
---
What if I don't want to go through 30 systems without seeing anyone.
---
Muck about in hisec for a bit, get your footing  try all the different things, then decide.
---
I think a lot of people missed the smart ass-ism in this, on both.
---
At least i hope is was just making a point, and not serious.
---
Why?
---
I just gotta ask, what were you expecting?
---
It hurts when he is correct. Upboated.

That explains a lot.

This guy Killboards
---
There's no kill like overkill.
---
All good mate
---
Arcane blast...
---
Just give me my killboard!
---
An imp died.
---
&gt; It also costs them very little to maintain it.
---
Exactly.  MMO's are not expensive to just keep maintaining, and they give a constant money trickle.  That is the sole reason EA is still running Ultima - if it was a money sink, it would not be run.
---
Games live EVE and WoW have reached a critical mass now.  All of Imperium could up and leave tomorrow and there would still be people playing, just like Ultima.
---
Hey wait this is the change everyone wanted!  No local guys come on get behind it!
---
*laughs in Combat Recon*
---
/r/WoW is that way.  Would be more productive frankly
---
At the very least certain recons won’t show up on dscan I guess
---
But it’s “delayed” already...
---
Case in point:
---
https://killboard.winterco.org/
---
That you own or the alliance you’re in?
---
That's how long it takes for the site to pull the new kills which varies massively but normally a few minutes at most. With a delay such as hour or longer, it can't be used as intel which seems to be the main issue people are bringing up.
---
Really, why don’t you just cry more for supers and titans to not be able to attack you while you’re killing them!  This whole blackout is more for whiny WHrs bitching for easier kills!
---
I burnt out on EVE last year but I'm watching closely to see if this stays permanent. If it does I'll be resubbing for sure.
---
Pretty sure he said that
---
I am OK I fly in a big null alliance I think on the whole we will survive just fine. The smaller corps/alliances may not either they wait it out or they join one of the big alliances which will be a bit of a shame and a loss to the sandbox.
---
did you read the post you replied to?
---
i don't, all i did was feed to gate camps i couldn't avoid cause zkill is down
---
They should just make it so if you jump through a gate you blow up. Then no one would ever travel again
---
They’ll most likely add an upwell structure you can anchor in your sov to regain something of what local used to be
---
Yes, I'm sure your incessant whining was what convinced CCP to deactivate them fro the time being  /s
---
I just started playing again after a few years where I played for a solid month and had to quit for one reason or another. I have a rigged up venture/imicus/vexor/nereus. It seems I was home basing in the Couster II system. 
---
My question is: How to I choose a home system to base operations in? Also what is my best form of money making using these ships for now? I am kinda at the "what exactly should I do" phase of relearning the game.
---
Go to areas that are populated? Lol
---
your a legend bro glad u came back .....
---
No  idea, number keeps popping up.
---
Yes and no. If you have director key from group like PH you will quickly see that someone is hunting this group members - when and in what ship(s).    
---
This information is not only visible for PH members but for every one in game.                  
---
You can easily track this when you have list of all the killmails.        
---
If the killmails are available out of game only after like 24 hours (or 48h, better - aka weekend)            
---
The same person can do the hunting without third party (and let be honest most of the PH ) being aware of this to happen.            
---
Important part is that this is possible only if CCP will delay the information as without it - people will just create their own killboards (like in the old way).              
---
Now looking at the same case from a different perspective.          
---
If this group was hunting PH for 4h and then moved 2 regions away, people still can see who and what they have to deal with just by looking on the PH kills, even before a single ship die in the area.
---
This is great to see, I support delayed killmails and having it done at the source is the better option by far.
---
Also, Happy Cake Day!
---
This is not good for new players. Not even a little
---
i heard syphilis
---
That's highly disappointing. Will only herd players into smaller umbrellas even more.
---
That makes sense, and I do use the CA set as I noticed it widens the margin for error far more than even a high-grade Halo set. I'm tempted to try rolling some abyssal extenders and upgrading to deadspace invuln but might just wait for the shield slave implants to come out as that'll probably make this Gila completely broken.
---
I pay my sub, I log in and play, thats more than enough to show that I like it. They can ask for thumbs up on youtube and facebook if they really need that.
---
50 accounts and yet so casual. your weakness disgusts me.
---
There should a balance, if it does turn out to be a structure in keepstar system then fine but then they need to limit keepstars to one per constellation. So only that system can get local back. 
---
I would prefer it to be a structure that can be attacked at any time, that takes 10mins with a damage amount of 3k dps, this would turn off local for 3 hours, it would also create a random vulnerability window between 12-24 hrs, which would last for 1hr, if attacked during this time it could be destroyed. Also the cost of the observatory should be expensive, 4b plus, and their should be a running cost that scales up for each one active in alliance.
---
and hope they have that titan bpo in there hold
---
I’m hearing two things:
---
1.) Capsuleers believe it’s their right to have all the data. When it’s taken away, someone has to become the scapegoat. 
---
2.) Everything I’ve been hearing is, “I wanna see my killboard!” Is really, “I want to see what other KB’s are like so that I can one up them.”
---
We’ve all been in the dark for the weekend now; some have started using other kb’s, some have just kept going.
---
I think it’s time to get less efficient and start playing the guessing game with what fits people are using. Also, why do you care what kills are happening on the opposite side of New Eden?
---
Ikr! I personally never really bothered with lowsec because lowsec is full of joke gatecamps (you can very easily escape almost all of them if youre in any fast ship, not even a sub 2s) and boring faction warfare pvp that now that I do some nullsec pvp, I see is very very different from nullsec pvp. In faction warfare only ships of a certain size or lower can jump in which can be good for simulating 1v1s sometimes but in nullsec youll have to find ways to deal with it if you get ganged on especially by a bigger ship that can easily wreck you in pvp. imo nullsec being more dangerous and thus lowsec becoming a bit more popular would be better long term.
---
That seems to be counter to what you would want. Do you have a reference for when they said that? I'm genuinely curious to see what the rationale is
---
downvoted cus casino war criminals
---
Nah, pvpers fight other pvpers, I dont think any of my targets were ratters. The wolf was definitely pvp fit given its significant bling.
---
*shrug*
---
take it up with CCP, that's how the game is designed.
---
Idk if it needs to be that rough but than again I’m new to eve politics and have no clue the amount of wealth that null sec alliances have
---
you mean bring back the mines?
---
No I mean these changes are just silly and make people not want to play
---
From a newbie view of PVP Players in EVE, it comes across like the Antifa terrorists beating an elderly man bloody with a crowbar, afterward patting themselves on the back while they put "GF" (good fight) in local or another form of communication.  Yes, there are players like Blights Wretch who appears to mainly seek other PVP players to fight against -- and those are truly "good fights" (because both parties are PVP, and true skill is being shown/proven).  But it seems, for the most part, there are a lot of players who think a "good fight" is finding a PVE player to target (as if they stand any chance most of the time) to take out.
---
To me, if Eve wants more new subscriptions, then both sides -- PVP and PvE should have content such that those who want PVP can have it against others who want PVP, and those who want PVE can have it without having people who think they are good at PVP (and maybe they are against other PVP players) take out PVE players (thinking that is a "good fight" when it is far from it).
---
how does it feel being better than 80% of monkeys us you heated ur resist?
---
I agree with this post far to much information is handed to players.
---
I still wait kill reports to become more of a score card and no fitting information on it 
---
[https://imgur.com/l0ONWVo](https://imgur.com/l0ONWVo)
---
We were also belt ratting in ravens for 10 million ticks. There was no infinite anom ism printing via super and smartbomb and afk vni, no c5 blue loot, etc.
---
Relatively speaking the isk you got from selling a plex was higher back then than it is now.
---
Imagine thinking any actual small alliance competent enough to have alittle bit of sov wouldn't know how to adapt to make better income or defend their miners/ratters
---
Looked like a honorable 1v1 to me.
---
everyone already has bazilions of bookmarks on everything thats relevant to them
---
There isn’t much of a secret to it, although avoiding gate camps is a skill to master if you want to do solo or small-gang pvp in nullsec a lot. Depending on where I am I tend to do one of two things
---
1: Jump around a ton of systems hoping to find someone I can engage either on a gate or on d-scan and then something I can warp to
---
2: Camp on a gate and kill whatever comes that I can engage
---
It’s important to know your ship’s strengths, weaknesses, and generally what it can and cant win a fight against. For my nosprey I consider what I can kill to be: All frigates, all destroyers except T3D, some cruisers. I dont have good enough missile skills yet to be able to deal with interceptors quickly. (theyre very fast ships) 
---
Put simply the key to solo pvp is understanding your capabilities and weaknesses, so you can accurately assess if a given ship you find is something you can or can’t kill.
---
hahahaha masked cowards beating someone up and making his head bleed is such a great joke
---
Then go to WH space ffs.
---
I keep the chat box in the corner tiny as hell.
---
&gt;However, I agree it's not his job to make that decision, nor is it reasonable to ask him to take the pressure of doing so. If killmails should be limited, it should be done upstream so it's fair for everyone.
---
+1 for doing it at the CCP/API level.
---
Drawing conclusions out of thin air the third day after an event that we don't actually have any data about... well done man, well done!
---
Using such a politically-charged RL example to back up your claim is just going to invite massive flaming comments from all sides of the issue at hand and everyone's going to ignore your actual point in a mountain of shit-flinging.
---
My advice is to maybe rework this argument using ingame examples rather than contentious RL politics. A lot of people play EVE to escape that shit, after all.
---
Another post about wormhole space from someone that knows shit-all about wormhole space...
---
So the retards finally get that free intel causes fewer fights. Good. Because the solution is now known, CCP will obviously not fix anything.
---
&gt;Maybe it is time to remove availability of all kill mail information outside of the game - or delay the availability by like 1 to 2 days
---
Needs to kept in game only. Maybe it can be traded or something.
---
2nd favorite cover of this song. :D
---
Why should they exist at all? Why should you have free intel like that? Its not available in-game.
---
Every goddamn time...
---
it looks like all crabs are leaving and all elite pvp hunters are coming back
---
...so how is this good for miners again?  Whales are gone forever, CCP finally killed the Frankenstein Rorqual monster they created...no one is gonna multibox or even solo Rorq mine with excavators in this new null...null is essentially a cloaky cyno pvp dead zone for mining/ratting...pvp'ers have fun, roam until your heart's content...
---
Correct. You'd never know something is bait because you can't see a near-realtime activity  log on a killboard.
---
Imagine chatting nonsense without having anything to back it up.
---
How will they "adapt to make better income" then? 
---
If there were easier, more effective ways accessible to all levels of player, they'd do it. There's a reason ratting and mining are primary sources of income for many players and corps. 
---
&gt;defend their miners/ratters
---
Try defending from someone who will drop caps on you, when you have fewer caps. Tell me how it goes
---
Eve is a game about danger, real loss, real victories, and the threat of pvp at any time you are undocked. If you want something other than this, you should gravitate to a different game.
---
I was reiterating and confirming what he said.
---
I don't see any reason you can't add a longer cache on `/killmails/recent`, whether it's 1hr or 1day.
---
Based on Reddit?
---
Mods, Plz nuke this thread.
---
LOL
---
The damage done between his alts are nearly all the same.
---
You know what that means? Input as fuck. I can multibox gank or multibox hunt in low/null sec. Do you know when i had that damage distribution? NEVER.
---
It take a lot of time to target + send drones + cause damage from the first alt to the n-th alt. Their damages WILL NEVER be like that.
---
wow that is
---
an AMAZINGLY direct copy
---
Is this blackout because you crybabies can't handle Eve change? Adapt or Die..... :)
---
It didn't stop the bots. Just fly to delve, their bots are still running very actively.   They just modify and use the overview while aligned mining and insta warp if a new ship arrives that's a baddy.
---
I could "use a keyboard" to jettison stuff from a barge every 15 mins, what kind of advantage that would give me? THATS A FUCKIN BOT.
---
You clearly have an advantage by doing that. You just dont want to see it.
---
&gt;Short version: killmails are not public in ESI. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;but only because you all voluntarily gave it to him.
---
A distinction without relevance. When everybody provides their "token", it results in killmails being made public.
---
&gt;So he could limit it himself, and no you can't pull the same data he can pull every 30 minutes. Only he has the tokens to pull so much data.
---
But if he didnt do it, some other site would do it instead, and at least until now, players believed free intel was good for the game. They now know better, but we cannot rely on that. CCP must act.
---
OP, agreed.  Correct language usage matters.
---
It's going to be fun though to watch them all do a 180 when they realize they are going to need to krab for new ships at some point.
---
&gt;Squizz can't delay zkillboard.com without harming his own product
---
Given how much it hurts the game, it is a quite immoral "product".
---
i had to check a couple times to see if reddit was glitched and putting my recommendations instead of the actual video
---
it is tho.  zkill gets its killmails from characters.
---
I'm on an old laptop. Not sure why the ss looks blurry like that tho.
---
also you might be able to get away with "they are they firing... just slowly"
---

Too bad you got downvoted. Here's an UP.
---
This isn’t RL, this is a game, chill the fuck out you sore looser.
---
Reported for not being Eve related.
---
&gt;People want to see when that stupid goon super dies
---
Allow killmails for supers then.
---
I never needed a CCP blackout excuse to get my pvp kills this is actually messing with my preys , also I pve so I can pay for pvp . 
---
Permanent blackout will ruin nullsec might as well move back in to c4 wh space at least there you can’t get Cyno blobbed.
---
I am totally against it  , weak excuse for so called pvpers.
---
if all of what you say is true then ore prices will rise. that is great for miners.
---
It sounds like maybe the game has multiple problems!
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
There is data to back up the statement that weekends are normally busier than weekdays.  I dont know why he got downvoted for saying that, saturday and sunday are always the high points of logged in players in almost any given week.
---
The fact is, EA doesn't make much, if any money off the game at all, but they aren't really expecting to. EA keeps the game up for it's historical significance because it was the first MMO that went mainstream. Some people incorrectly regard it as being the first MMO, which it's not, but it still has a place in MMO history. 
---
CCP is not EA though and can't afford to run projects that don't make or lose money. How many other great MMOs were out there where once the ride was over the servers just shut down? A lot more than are still running. 
---
Is it possible Eve could still stay running with a greatly diminished population? I suppose. I'm not sure how likely it is though. I wouldn't count on it is all I'm saying.
---
I already got my market data in but am looking to import skills/standings to better evaluate profits. 
---
Also looking to get the Wallet Transactions/Journal to make a ledger of trades instead of doing it manually. Adding in Inventories as well eventually or Corp data. Seems like itll be a hassle and require skills I dont currently possess
---
Only with voice activation, so if you don't want to draw attention you have to shut it up.
---
I think the biggest problem is being able to look up someones ZKILL history to determine if they are a threat or not.  
---
Scanning around null for relics and see someone else in local?  Lets look at their history and see what ships they fly and their fit.  "oh this guy likes to kill astero's, I will keep moving on".
---
Jumping Titans through lowsec and see a neutral in local?  Lets take a look at zkill.  "Oh hey, he once cynod in Snuffed  Out 2 years ago, this is obviously a trap".  or "oh this guy just runs with a militia and flys fed navy comets, we are good"
---
Don't forget to resub
---
I feel like another part of this, is that less people are mindlessly multi-boxing because it’s not as safe anymore.
---
now this is a good hangover cure
---
That's is pretty cool man, congrats again!

combat scanners launched

Basically everything I’m reading is “We need to delete the things that make EVE unique.” There are a lot of reasons people come to this game but one of them is the freedom to create 3rd party shit and gain experience in a non-consequential setting. Another is the wealth of resources that are available to learn the game. Take the experience most ‘hunters’ already have from these tools, Combine the amount of knowledge that newer players can gain from killboards, and it seems like most people in support of things like this are effectively Self-Harming teenagers waiting for their parents to take the Knife away. I hope Pearl Abyss catches on before masses of people Unsub their alts and the “l33t PvP dudes” don’t come up with a few million Dollars to compensate. 
---
TLDR: Local Blackout is amazing, dont take it too far or it might bite back.
---
But it is not available in aggregate form, and you cannot search for a name and get a ton of info.
---
wish i saw this before i left null lol
---
fuck off you degenerate.
---
I find storage worthless. 
---
The launchpad holds 10k m3, that is plenty.
---
You can always use the POCO as storage as well.
---
All of Frat's ratters is really only like a half dozen dudes.
---
As long as they shout "gf" afterwards, I'm sure everyone understands
---
&gt;You will not check 20 jumps ahead ingame easily, but you will get popup from some tools that will tell you if there is gatecamp 2jumps around your route. 
---
I didnt know about that. Is that like pirates-little-cheater on roids?
---
LEAVE THE THRASHERS!
---
It's a lot easier to camp a lvl 5 mission hub than entire regions of nullsec. Also even having just a dozen or two hardcore lvl 5 mission runners will tank LP and create diminishing returns, something that anoms don't have.
---
Funny nobody thought that up until recently
---
Someone did.
---
The rational was that large blocks owned all of nullsec, because they needed the space. There was no room for smaller groups. Plus it disencentisied small groups from taking space, since it wasn't that valuable to own just a small amount. 
---
The changes largely worked. Null isn't held by only two entities anymore.
---
You can look at our recent activity in Tribute to see it works. We cleared the area out, but we made no attempt to hold it. We also didn't attempt to hold Pure Blind. There is no reason for us to hold those regions. Those are now perfect areas for a smaller group to attempt some diplomacy and set themselves up. That is exactly inline with the goal.
---
No blackout, no hip-hop and rap.
---
Show me how to search for a name in-game and view all his kills/losses.
---
wow who would have thought
---
I'm also going to go on the record and say websites like  [https://timerboard.net/](https://timerboard.net/) shouldn't be possible. 
---
It provides so much free alliance level intel.
---
Its almost as if CCP has been neglecting certain issues for a while.
---
Is yours?
---
Please explain how no local in null is bad for new players.
---
So a normal weekend, in other words
---
thanks ^_^
---
You know you can still talk in Local right...
---
there are ingame tools for that since forever. hope this helps fam
---
My setup actually does neither of those.  
---
I run extraction on 6 planets, no factories.  
---
Once every day reset the extractors.
---
Once every 3-4 days store the P1 in the POCO (once the launchpad fills up basically, NO storage sites, they are useless)
---
Once every two weeks empty the filled up POCO and the launchpad, haul everything into station/cita/whatever. 
---
Once you deem you extracted enough (couple of months worth maybe?), convert your planets into factories and process all the P1 into whatever you want it to be.
---
Once processed retool planets into extraction again.
---
The daily maintenance consist of basically restarting the extractors, which takes around 30seconds per char.
---
Is it the most efficient way?
---
No clue, but it sure beats having to haul stuff from each planet every day.
---
This way I only need to haul every two weeks, while retaining the efficiency of extracting from 6 planets at a time at 24 hour cycles.
---
The retooling part is the click-intensive part, but I only do it once every couple of months, so no biggie. 
---
If you are in null you might be able to source P1 far below Jita price, so that might be worth looking into as well.
---
&gt;Dotlans deltas are just the 30 minute number over the 24 hour number aren't they.
---
I always assumed that it was the current 30 min value minus the previous 30 min value. For example, the 12:30-1:00 value minus the 12:00-12:30 value.
---
Sorry, haven’t dealt with jumping or jump bridges, please explain?
---
It’s more than pedantic because the word “delayed” would be the correct word to describe a form of local that many people have been advocating for as a more permanent solution: pilots showing up in local after having been in the system for a certain period of time.
---
“In a game where you can do almost anything why would you do something I wouldn’t want to do?”
---
Get fucked
---
This a dark time, stainguy is right....
---
CCP does not do 12 releases a year...
---
soory, he speeks the truth.
---
i honestly doubt the most outspoken supporters of this change give a flying fuck or two about ratting without local or a local that´s full with neuts.
---
THB CCP should have removed this free intel when they did the black out 
---
No free intel
---
Lol this guys an idiot if he thinks anyone is jumping around with a 50BIL carrier.
---
Yeah - as a PMP/CSM I'm always super excited to hear how people do their forecasting, sprints and releases. GGG model is fucking nutty, its like the worst elements of predictive and iterative development I've ever heard of.
---
Would anyone notice....not sure theyre aware theres a blackout.
---
Make me feel playing a singleplayer when I travel around our home regions.
---
Feels lonely man :/
---
If you fly with people that make fun of you because of your killboard it might be time to change corps.
---
To me zkill is like a journal of my activity in EVE and I love seeing it like that; to be honest I barely use it as an intel tool.
---
So I think your best course of action would be to stop giving a fuck about it and just have fun doing what you want to do.
---
you can enable drawing of lines between stars on the background according to the route you have plotted.
---
I like this solution the most. Delaying system information instead of the whole killmail.
---
Wow that is weird.  I just checked my recent death against this site and it almost has the right fit (pod is way off though).  My time of death is correct.  It then has me getting killed and getting a few kills on July 16 (2 days in the future from now).
---
so many fuckups it was unreal. still was fun
---
Which local m8
---
Low sec local where 80% of supers and titans die.
---
I think they should ban any 3rd party program that’s making input commands at the same time in the game.
---
gatecamps are shit gameplay
---
Can you smell burning toast?
---
muckhly deathies
---
[Zkill Github](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard) Squizz has it opensourced, as CCP Bartender said its having the tokens which provides the real value.
---
spectre discord has a lot of the npsi stuff
---
https://discord.gg/Udrzrns
---
gate camping is dogshit gameplay 100%
---
Think of the hunters, actually - don't. 
---
DPS output and surprise are already in the hunters favor, as is all other game mechanics that allow you to easily escape any engagement. What do PVE players get? Nerfs, constantly.
---
Your director/CEO can do do for your Corp/alliance via the Corp information in game.  Difference here is someone director level decided to share that information.  All zkillboard does is put it all in the same place, and remove the tedium of copying it by hand like we used to have to.
---
People can choose not to make their information public, but most groups do because it gives easy activity metrics and bragging rights.
---
If you don't want your stuff public, take it up with your group.
---
Even before zkillboard groups used to host their own and a quick Google search would give you that Intel anyway.
---
Pretty much that and bots
---
You'd be surprised!
---
Problem is then someone else makes a non-delayed kb. CCP needs to be the agent of change, not the players.
---
Could always provide a little danger to being cloaked, or make it so you couldn't cloak forever.
---
But who am I kidding, go ahead and downvote ya tards.
---
somene start new killboard! This bad monopolist with zkill are ruining our green countering :-X
---
Downvotes don't make something false, except in your head. 
---
The more you know, eve reddit 2019
---
cool PvP parts, nice tunes but the motivational speech parts made me cringe
---
I'm seeing a pattern here.
---
Any thread/post indicating the blackout isn't being universally loved is being downvoted. Must be bots.
---
Citadel holograms also do this during their hull timers.
---
Ah Iron crown, more bot cancer, good job killing them.
---
Ta dude
---
Great idea, if you completely ignore the way someone would just spin off an archive approximately 5 minutes later.
---
Me too, but hey, no killboard.
---
They have no idea what they are getting into.
---
i've just been using the cached version for going through past data xd
---
So you want to pretty much completely break battlereports and otherwise completely defeat the point of zkill?
---
Going through the examples:
---
1. You would still be able to see if people are generally pvpers or not. Also if blues got killed by that guy, you would see anyways. So your change wouldn't do much other than annoy people.
---
2. Local doesn't exist anymore -&gt; Your point is invalid for now.
---
If local exists again -&gt; You can still estimate if they are a danger even with your change.
---
So your change wouldn't do much other than annoy people.
---
3. No alliance has one doctrine anymore and most of the fits don't really differ from alliance to another. And most stagings have eyes on them or the alliances have ping relays. So you can still plan a counter anyways.
---
Great shitpost 10/10
---
They will when it's their turn to be the kills.  Really interested to see how this experiment plays out over a longer term.
---
No one is stopping you crabbing. No cloaking means blops groups just don't work.
---
StainGuy approves of gate camping, wants straightforward plan to increase gate camping...
---
happy cake day
---
brainlet down
---
The content they crave for delivered right to their doorsteps? Yeah, they´ll totally hate that!
---
Yes, you can get a premium feed.
---
well its china, what do you expect
---
&gt;everyone has their own killboard now?
---
What’s old is new again.
---
I don't need your ESI to get your zKill history. ZKill is not affiliated with CCP. It is a third party service.
---
Ty, ill check it out o7
---
Yup zkill is out winterco kb is in
---
Delay the arrive of kill mail is pretty interesting
---
Inb4 CCP Guard's bathwater
---
At some point they need to make money, not just has good fights. Right now it seems like everyone is having fun as sort of a pvp holiday, but I wonder how sustainable it is in the long term. 
---
If the goal is to nail botters and reduce the amount of isk and resources generated while increasing risk for PvE, that's going to start affecting pvpers too. How it will do so is yet to be seen, but you can't really just assume business as usual. Eventually everyone needs to take a turn at or rely on PvE to fund PvP. If PvE becomes PvP often, even though if more fun there might be sustainability issues.
---
Kind of wondering how it looks two weeks in or so. The fights are fun now, but when your pve people in the corp can't mine as easily or get fatigued over the heightened risk, what will happen? Still an interesting experiment.
---
Most people on other parts of space rutinely smash that DScan hotkey, almost all the time while undocked. The fact that krabs didn't speaks a lot about how ridiculously safe NS was before local. 
---
And no, only people afk will have to stop doing their stuff, which is awesome. The rest will just learn to smash that key like the rest of us.
---
Break ties with anyone who told you it was a good idea to put 10 minutes of muninn combat in a pvp video.
---
Join a supportive player group, a solo carrier is a dead one. much like carriers of in the real world they are powerful but require support.
---
Filthy HS casual here... I really like the blackout. I haven't popped my head into null since ~ 2009. Now that I know I'm not showing up in local I've been having a great time just poking around. I haven't gotten quite brave enough to leave jet cans labelled "Kilroy was here" in Russian space but I may yet. I mostly use zKill for fitting ideas so I'm neither here nor there on delays. Just my 2 cents.
---
Delay would be fine but not being able to look at past fights/kills out of game would be absolutely cancer. Not being to share battle reports or look at the big picture of fights without a lot of pen and paper work is a pain in the ass lol
---
because what you are saying - you are still getting discord alerts 
---
even if rest of people are in blackout mode.
---
So if I pick a random player in-game, I can right-click and "view kills/losses" or similar?
---
Zkb goes far beyond your corp/alliance. Might as well argue that because every player can view their own kills/losses in-game, the info already exists and zkb does nothing wrong.
---
&gt;All zkillboard does is put it all in the same place, and remove the tedium of copying it by hand like we used to have to.
---
Maybe thats all it takes?
---
The "aggregation" and auto-profiling of every player "seen" certainly provides a ton of intel that is not available in-game.
---
[beeing](https://i.imgur.com/qMGhPxb.jpg)
---
Fish out of water!
---
ah i see we're just making up statistics now, 83% of statistics are just made up on the spot
---
&gt; from a game design perspective, automating it increases safety for no cost.
---
So, maybe make it a module you need to construct (can't be bought/sold for... reasons. Maybe it needs to be custom for each ship?) and will be destroyed if un-fit from your ship. Only can be used on T1 ships. It pops up an alert and sound when detecting a ship entering d-scan range. The exact number of seconds warning depends on the speed of the incoming ship, of course.
---
Nothing is more annoying them trying to hack a can, and having another ship show up with no warning. This would provide newbies a few seconds to try to escape. And it wouldn't be over-powered, as it would be limited to T1 ships.
---
Crime: Not in check.
---
Same thing with market information. You can make, near botlike spreadsheets that can show everything you need to know at a glance.
---
Ok lets approach your statement about 'players giving giving the esi by themself'.                 
---
What is the goal of the killmails.       
---
Provide the "achievement" for players or letting all other people know that there is a gang on specific gate or fight is happening in some system?               
---
Because, let be honest at the moment all external tools that are pulling this ESI data are not focusing on player achievements but on the intel gathering aspect of a killmail.            
---
This is bad and need to be revisited.         
---
It need to be from CCP side as simply to say - i want this to be fair for all players and not to people that will gather the most ESI links from various groups.
---
It was for the story friend :) These battles aren't scripted.
---
Love it, hope it stays
---
Thanks for the support :)
---
Its all about that lowsec gate to Stain.
---
As a victor of World War Bee, I show you mercy and give you your only upvote.
---
Well market is market. Lets be hones market gameplay also focuses on this kind of information.       
---
But yes 4h delay could be nice for the "order information".
---
Feels really good, thank you for asking. I contribute my success to only being dropped once as a child.
---
If you aren't flair baiting, ask around in your alliance for tips and maybe even a SIG. I've find quite a lot GSF pilots having fun in LS, just there for the quick fights in small ships.
---
F.
---
So, with no local, you don't know who to look up
---
Now it's time for your video :)
---
The original to be made there?
---
[:thinking:](https://i.imgur.com/KODT0O0.jpg)
---
Well my point is that you can have the killmail ingame.      
---
Yo can share it by linking to some chat, you can view it corporate stats .... but you cannot pull it from ESI before 48h have passed.        
---
Even better - maybe simpler for CCP, downtime after 48h have passed.             
---
(instead of constant monitoring what kill make visible now -&gt; a single script that is run after each DT).
---
Twas all done in good fun to make many months of footage sync together ;)
---
Zkill is fine as it is. It gives away free intel because people are giving them out, not because it extract everything from game database. As easy as not giving out your own API conceal yourself really well.
---

92% of goon players are afraid to leave their umbrella.
---
nothing wrong with a good pvp pov video
---
:wasntthinking:
---
You sir are correct.  Not a techie kind of guy so didn't think of this.
---
Nothing would stop alliances from archiving data and having the information anyways.  I digress.
---
Somehow i would love to see a recurring event where concord is fully disabled. Just to have some carnage :) maybe just 1 or 2 days a year at a random date :)
---
That actually aint a bad idea....I keep forgetting about the sigs and usually just go with pings when they come.
---
Oh man, this takes me back. I lived in couster when I was a total newbie, back then I did belt ratting and salvageing in a Tristan, but it sounds like you’re already past that point. I’d recommend moving one system over to agogile (idk how to spell it) and use the imicus to scan wormholes to hack data and relic sites. agogile Has a bunch of connecting systems so you can hop around looking for a wormhole. Exploring you need class 1-3 holes, which say “unknown space” on them, also only hack sites that have a pirate name In Them (serpentis, Guristas, blood etc.). You can also try gas huffing, which needs a 25 mil skillbook and a couple mil ship. For that the higher the wormhole class the better (dangerous or deadly unknown). Scan in the imicus, then swap to venture and mine the gas til sleepers spawn (15-20 mins from first warpin). Avoid ordinary perimeter reservoirs, they have sleepers always. The nereus will work for hauling the loot to a trade hub (dodixie for convenience, or jita for a little more money). Once you can afford it though a miasmos can haul way more gas than a nereus, though the nereus gets a very nice tank which I like when hauling lots of crap.
---
It's seriously been happening, and I laugh every time.
---
Also be sure to check the store for our latest merch!
---
From an external point of view, SIGs are one of the best things Goons have.
---
It's also been working in Frat space. My favorite so far was "X up if you're loving this blackout"
---
No.
---
Lol come on man. "Allowing new players to enter null", if anything this is riskier now since people are actually defending gates. And the other aspect of it, new players just got it tons harder to join NS groups since the risk of subcap ratting just went up.
---
And players docking, I mean. Why the fuck shouldnt they? Why do some people have it in their heads that krabs are here to make your life better? That they should just stfu and take it up the ass. Its so fking lol that you dont even see how you want them to just be your entertainment. And you complain if they, all legally, talk to eachother to lessen the risk of being just that, your entertainment.
---
Na, you are extremely wrong. Because you havent even considered the other side. When they get tired of being your entertainment they will make a choice, maybe they leave NS which makes it shittons more barren or they just join the bigger groups and fly big ships which can be helped in case of ganks.
---
And guess what people have been complaining about for 3 years or so? Barren NS, blobs and capitals. 
---
So enjoy this, but if this lasts.. Same people saluting it today will beg for things to return. And then the krabbers will tell you to suck it.
---
You 'could' set something like this up with permissions. Though I wouldn't suggest this, if only because I doubt the dude makes enough money from it to justify the time/expense.
---
How is messing with your prey? What about when these killboards didnt exist or they were owned by corps and alliances? This kinda of salty tears is what I am totally loving about this black out. Everyone is being impacted and are adapting to game play. Its actually kind of like there being no actual intel channels, so you had to pay attention to your environment and what was happening around you.
---
If it were up to me, I'd like to see some differentiation between the information available to people who were involved in a given killmail, and those that aren't.  If you were in on it, you get to see it instantly.  If you weren't, insert a delay.  I'm not tech savvy enough to know if that would be viable with the way the mechanism works though.
---
Personally, I've always thought it a bit too far in the "free intel" department you can see what a given ship had fitted and what they had in cargo.  Maybe hang onto the ISK value of the loss for bragging rights and whatnot, but whatever goes up in a fiery ball goes up in a fiery ball.  Plus, it seems a bit silly that you can use real time killmails as a cargo scanner.  Wanna know if the other guy dropped something good?  Fly over there and take a look.
---
Surface go might run it in potato mode.
---
I sure about that? Ngsa working fine and get more kills then befor blackout
---
Actually it's more like this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb6tz6ohprw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb6tz6ohprw)
---
I literally dont think ive ever had this much fun playing eve!
---
Learn to use the ingame map. It has all of the information zKill does, you just need to use the actual filters. Or, unless your Alpha, use an inty that is immune to interdiction bubbles?
---
I have been waiting for this since Apocrypha when the wormholes came and introduced the delayed local mechanic. I subbed again after 3 years of winning for this shit.
---
Ya, I guess the people in here aren't old enough to have experienced real hype for expansions. I used to be hyped for almost every expansion before like 2012.
---
It's actually been super nice. Players are becoming way more cautious about going into enemy sovereignty to get kills. It is creating new content, and honestly I don't entirely see a problem with it. Over 10 years ago we didn't have all of these tools, just the ingame map. In fact, the blackout is making players incredibly selective and they are only going for specific systems.
---
The Blackout thing is the best change I've seen in years.
---
And what is ngsa
---
gsf camping group even with blackout we camping regions and tackle shit :)

On gates, traveling through peoples space

[removed]
---
This. It was always possible. Without local, the isk/risk ratio is far better in whs and if you want to PvP you can do the best kind there, small gang, instead of having to endure multiple hour 256-man fleets. I.e., there are a lot of disadvantages to NS that people dont understand. Its almost as if all if these hunters are non NS people. Hmm..
---
 they are disabled skill not to know and stop the race to kill, or because to avoid finding that there is a lot of kill than expected .
---
I was roaming Syndicate in a mad/cloak Iteron V within a month of starting, buying loads of cheap minerals and trolling bubble camps. You give new players too little credit, but it probably fits your narrative.
---
If you wanna push for a 12-24 hour delay or somesuch, okay fine I'll play ball on that. But if you're talking complete removal of the KM and dotlan systems, then no, I'm gonna have to speak against that. Half of Eve's history is written because x killed y and someone shitposted a KM in local.
---
Yup, exactly. I  miss chatting with people who live in the null systems I frequent. Have been invited to a few spontaneous fleets that way. Or randomly running into a familiar face and waving. You guys are right that this Reddit is dominated by elite / small-gang pvp people who don't understand this social aspect and will downvote us to oblivion.
---
Wait no, you see the killmail instantly, you can share it ingame. But on the ESI it will be visible after 48h
---
For you
---
disable local + disable cloaking &lt;3  bot cant farm and hunter cant camp ! nice one
---
IIRC this activity is actually against the EULA at this point but it's been a bit since I looked so I could be wrong.
---
Its not the hull mate, its the excavators. You can wipe out an entire grids excavators with a handful of bombers and they never see it coming.
---
Delay listings for everyone but contributors :P  ... troll me.
---
jafeel
---
Naw you are not the typical new player. Neither am I. Just being on Reddit trying to learn more about the game is our style. For lots of new players this game is very challenging and they are not like us.
---
no way!
---
In Amarr militia, we figured out how Minmatar militia always had stupid amounts of isk to throw around.
---
There used to be an L4 mission agent in Amarr/Minmatar fw space that would only send you to a single system instead of a random one, so we would repeatedly mass-deathclone 500k SP pullers back and forth while running the missions with an Oracle fleet.
---
Most of us made between 15-20b per puller in about three hours. The Minmatar guys that were originally doing it got upset that we had discovered their LP faucet and reported us, and CCP shut it down. They never took the isk, though.
---
Squizz and Daimian are New-eden national treasures...
---
I wish it actually played the song when you went to the website
---
So even with the evidence available, retards still deny.
---
&gt; Also, why do you care what kills are happening on the opposite side of New Eden? 
---
I don't know... to see potential places to roam around or deploy to instead of sitting on the same gate for years?   
---
Or to find out if the player X that I used to fly with is stil playing.   
---
Evaluate the potential groups to join so I wouldn't end up with a shitty group for months untill I give up on them and can start looking again. This kind of things that come in handy and which I personally going to miss more than looking at my kb stats that became irrelevant somewhere after 10k kills, or finding the opponent's fit that I rarely have time for anyway.

---
&gt;Limit ~~Public Zkill History~~ shitposts in r/Eve  
---
&gt;One of the top things that contributes to ~~safety in Eve~~ eve is kill is ~~public Zkill history~~ invalid ideas in r/Eve.  
---
&gt;Proposal: Limit ~~Zkill history~~ shitposting ~~&gt; 3 months to yourself or people/groups that have your ESI.~~  
---
&gt;~~Examples:~~  
---
&gt;~~If a player is running around low/null while doing relic sites or solo PVP and sees another player in local, the first thing they will do is look up their zkill history. Based on that they can make a reasonable assumption on if the player is a threat or not.~~  
---
&gt;~~If an alliance is doing a super/titan move Op they will check the zkill history of all players in local to determine if they are a threat. If a character was a bait cyno at anytime in the past 15 years, they will know, and they will choose not to jump. Many groups were willing to risk heavy assets during the great Goon migration for a chance at a titan or faction titan kill and nothing ever came from it because Goons had perfect intel. I believe 1 Erebus died out of the hundreds of titans that moved.~~  
---
&gt;~~If an alliance is coming to a fight in a certain doctrine, the enemy can plan a counter prior to the fight even starting, based on zkill history.~~
---
Fixed
---
No-one is proposing taking anything away. Keep all the third-party tools, but delay the info feed so they're reporting tools, not action tools.
---
I remember my 2001 PC blue-screening every time I enabled the premium graphics. I had to play classic.
---
I may have worded it awkwardly, but what I was trying to say with  "involved in a given killmail" was "on a killmail".  Right now, it's just the guy who gets the last blow, and the guy who dies.  I think that everyone who appears on it (i.e. the guy who had the victim scrammed but didn't cause much damage, etc.) should see it at the same time as the guy who got the killmark on their ship.
---
I love the Blackout i can close my local and intel window now and it gives me the room i needed to fully use the Agency Window.
---
Null: The deeper you go, the better it is.
---
I agree. Maybe any day ending in a 'y'?
---
Multiple people are confirming significantly increased relic payouts especially in NOC space. 200mil per hour is “normal” since blackout started. 
---
It appears CCP is rewarding additional risk.
---
You forgot to mention how you can get surprising amount of juicy info just by using the in-game New Eden map and browse through the various filters. Even without the 3rd party tools, there's a wealth of interesting info out there.
---
didn't realize habit was a zoomer guild
---
would totally be enough if there were randomly timed interferences which disable cloak for a random time frame between 1 and 10 minutes ...
---
Its a prediction, not a conclusion.
---
Im not saying that one should. But its a reality you know. And you honestly dont need more than 30-50 campers to entirely shut down an entire region. Umbrellas arent magical, they have limitations. So at times, when you have been camped enough then there is no longer a choice.
---
But, my point here was in response to OPs hilarious title, "because to no local". People were killing supers to the left and right long before this, its got nothing to do with local. The only thing this change does is make the defender a sitting target. A second must expensive hull type sitting target. Plus I think these were bots honestly which makes this thread all the more hilarious.
---
I hope so. Because cloaky campers were another shitty thing. People complaining about afk miners yet same people say its okey to put a char in system and not touch it for one whole day. Without any sort of risk. The fking hypocrisy.
---
People can still receive in-game killmails, share those killmails, and screenshot and repost said killmails for sweet internet points.
---
Removing zkill and third party killboards doesn’t remove parts you like interacting with
---
We as players create tools and systems outside of the sandbox to help us with our interactions within it. This is no different than any other clever use of intel, or any other outside program we've made.
---
I support the temporary blackout of services, but permanently turning them off is not a smart move. Tons of people rely on them for their enjoyment of the game, with many an FC playing with a copy of dotlan open on the other screen looking for ratting pockets. zKill is even more essential, from providing more realistic kill value estimations to aggregating stats over time that the "activity tracker" can't do. 
---
Perhaps I'm wrong but in my eyes the real effect of Blackout was that it convinced people to undock. Look at everyone who's enjoying the event, they're enjoying it because the circumstances have convinced other people to be more active over the weekend too. I don't believe dotlan and zKill being shut down have had a major impact on that, not to the extent of the in-game effect of local being in delayed mode.
---
The extra screenage has been useful.
---
Best thing to happen to eve in years.
---
New players don't use local
---
You will see. But you wont accept it no matter. Since the Rorq meta started this has been happening with higher frequency. And that mostly affected miners, now you are doing the same thing with ratters. 
---
No one in their right mind, with a bit of information regarding how the stagnation occured, will say what youre saying.
---
The problem is only scrubs live in nullsec to pve, all the elite PvP pilots I know have highsec incursion alts or c5 naglifar farms
---
Did I say that you could do it for every player?  Just your corp alliance members in your corp kill log.
---
On the aggregation, this is an issue that goes far far longer then zkillboard has been around.  They've been a thing well before the API has been a thing, or the killmail system we have now.   
---
Back when the big aggregate killboards started, all you had is the person with the loss and the person that got the final blow got an in game mail with the kill details )  It was up to those individuals to cut and paste that eve-mail to a killboard and it went from there.   Then people made services to aggregate individual corp killboards to a global one, and there you go.  
---
The information / auto-profiling that's always been voluntary (on some level) and still is.  Someone (or their group)  has to choose to make their kill and/or loss information publicly available.  I see no problem with zkill in the fact that it's still a voluntary exposure of information.   
---
I'd like to see the automation of it be delayed, but that's a CCP thing to decide, not a zkillboard thing.
---
Nemesis Navy Issue is lit

Apocrypha was THE SHIT, like my God was that expansion magical

braindead joker checks out
---
More like the Benny Hill theme song. :-)
---
no such thing as true pve in eve, and this is by design, and why the game has existed for over 15 years
---
So what does that say about nullsec that all of the hunters are extraneous?
---
The lossmail should be immediate showing what was killed, when, and where. The information on the killers should be delayed.

You just sign up from someone's referral link. Doesn't matter who's as far as I can tell. Unfortunately, learned the lesson the hard way on my main character, but got the 750k on all my alts.
---
I can shoot you over my link if you want or just use a friend of yours.
---
Additionally steam last time I checked has the starter pack for $1.20 which gives you 1M skill points. (not entirely sure if you can get both though on same character.)
---
Ccp does not make killmails public. Zkill only has kills submitted to it, no different than griefwatch.
---
OK.
---
I'm not a virgin, you dweeb.
---
I like that CCP took local being broken and made it a feature. On a more serious note, I believe that delaying zkill or dotlan would be beneficial but are a bit overboard for now. Local provided instant and easy to see intel that a threat was in system. By removing local you now need to have player communication among larger corps which achieves both the "multiplayer game" and "null is scary" aspects that CCP is going for. Limiting player tools outside of game may be too difficult for CCP to achieve (I'm not a programmer so I'm not sure) and if you take down one tool then players will create another.

That's a Virtuoso

Even if the login count is down 2000 characters, nullsec feels so much more active than it did pre-blackout.

"DSCAN CAN'T SAVE YOU NOW BOI!"
---
This.
---
Oh, hey.  Look at what you added to the thread.
---
I live in null to do fleet ops and go to lowsec for solo content.  You don't need to leave null all together.
---
This isn't actually a bug. Its long been the case the wormholers are required to reply "Polo" to anyone posting "Marco" in j-space local. We always thought it was a wormhole only thing, but recently we discovered its the nature of delayed local.
---
Maybe with poorly rolled modules but an Imp is so expensive gimping the guns to cheap out on abyssal mods makes zero sense.
---
Cheerzah
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted, you are absolutely correct.
---
And yes, the word "delayed" has also been annoying me.
---
Once best friends, now enemies.. this is Eve :)
---
Redemption road will be flying a new player oriented roam today at 20:00. Join the channel "Redemption road"  if your intrested.
---
Why can’t you bears just play eve? It’s not like you can’t just light a cyno and have 50 supers land to help you...
---
Nice to see all the carebears losing their toys
---
Turns out losing local is worse for risk adverse pvp, who knew?
---
I was also vaporized in a HG snaked garmur from 75% shields to dead instantly by a Rattle drone 30km away from me, and my only response was confusion.
---
It really is a rather questionable mechanic.
---
Expansions used to be huge and shake things up, now it feels like a bunch of small changes pissed out half heartedly.  No hype, no changes that fix the problems.
---
“Win Eve” a long time ago.  Are these new skins with holographic effects then?  Any other details?  Seems like a tasteful way to allow more ship customization than just paint.
---
Love it, ty
---
Still having an issue where my previews reset position everytime  I load eve-o preview
---
Yep, you too can join their fleets and go on alliance entosis ops while only fighting certain not purples, but ignoring others!
---
This is the kind of players that Eve is meant to reward though. People who go out of their way to learn how to adapt to the challenges rather than those who go, "wtf I died this game is too hard"-- these are the ones who this game really shines for. 
---
Also null sec has never been advertised as a place that is easy or friendly to new players. In fact, it's kind of supposed to be the opposite. You want safety and security? Go bear in high sec. You want danger and exploration? Head to null or WH space. In my opinion this is actually a huge bonus for new players as it allows for that sense of danger and confusion to be amplified which ultimately attracts more of the people like you and olliurps up there.
---
Ty now it’s readable hahahaha
---
Haha yeah seriously.  Just about every game is busier on the weekends.  
---
Hint for people who don't get it: people don't have work or school.
---
sisi...

You're a moron. This is Sisi trolling, those people are butt-buddies and sit inside novices in Okkamon all the time.
---
is fake

/r/whoosh/
---
The publishing of killmails using CCPs API results in those killmails being made available publicly.
---
A majority of killmails are not submitted to zkb, they are fetched by zkb using CCPs API.
---
A cloaky campaign of what sorts. I dont know what happened. And if its cloaky then it doesnt matter with no local.
---
No one said it would. But it does help against shit hunters who just want an easier time killing stuff.
---
Its one sided fun. And its not. Eve primetime is saturdays between 17 ish to 20 ish. You have a 4k drop, which is what about 15% ish, in comparison with the last months saturdays. You had a 2k ish drop on friday, same comparison. 
---
Thats 2 days which means that nothing definite can be said but its too big of a drop to be random. A change gets implemented and 2 days later 15% of the playerbase says "fkit, Im not logging on". There is a connection, and it just confirms what NS dwellers have been saying. The risk is way to high for us to do this. If it goes on we well do other, safer things like HS alts and such. Why risk a Rorq with 3b excavs that can get bombed without a second of notice. Or a super that now can easier be caught in traps and killed by things costing a fifth of its price. Without recourse. Fk that man.
---
If the player count had gone up, sure, more are enjoying it than less. This is not the case.
---
Looks like I must construct additional pylons.
---
Boy you got him good.
---
Went down like a champ. Took out a Caedes in a AT ship throw down. Must've been exhilarating.
---
"Perfect security" would imply that it's *impossible* to hunt.  That's a different thing from whether or not the mechanism is broken and unbalanced.  If you genuinely think that it's impossible to hunt with local, maybe you're just not that good of a hunter...
---
do those tools show u kills that happen on gates specifically? what are they?
---
Some people might rage quit for a while, until they figure out that they can just be more careful and rejoin, or find fun in other areas of space.
---
On the other hand, the number of people rejoining won't even come close to the ammount of VNI afk armies and bots of different kinds that aren't logging in (and hopefully won't do ever again, but I doubt it).
---
What would you rather have? A population of 30k with half of them being bots or afk ratters, or a population of 18k actual characters doing at least semi-active things?
---
Both of these things at least involve ships being in space. Not optimal, but an improvement.
---
never logged into SIsi before. And secondly, can’t go into a novice with AT frigs
---
where does the in game map show u kills that happened on gates specifically?
---
Zkillboard is down so it's hard to tell. Quite a few shiny expensive toys have gone down, at least a titan kill and a Imp have died, not a lot of really big fights though.   
---

---
You can see number of kills in each region in the last 24 hours. As well as kills in the last hour, I don't normally use eveeye or have a good grasp whether the number of kills has gone up or down.
---
appreciate the at ship on at ship action even if it's not 1v1
---
also isnt sheltark the fuck snuff guy or sth what happened
---
its already disabled
---
As long as our in game killmails have the information it'll get posted somehow.   We used to do this by hand from the eve mails generating showing what the skip killed was fit with and manually have the guy with the killblow post it to a public killboard.    
---
As long as the information exists, it will probably be made public either by ESI or cut and paste.
---
Are you kidding? I ganked like 3 logistics trucks in NYC today, was great. Normally you only get those type of KMs from Jersey.
---
I think you need to learn how to read a killmail.
---
I appreciate the change, its a big one.
---
Imo im happy that null sec gets to enjoy a little wormhole life in their diet.
---
Blackout &gt; Stagnation.
---
That's what this is plain and simple. As for thise complaining about it.
---
You knew drifters have been steadily hiking up their presence, you knew way before the big npc invasion and suffice it to say. You should appreciate this healthy remodeling of null.
---
Suck it up grass eaters, start growing some horns...
---
Nah that's not enough. I propose every business day + sat- and sunday, + holidays
---
Did he Uninstalled eve shortly after that loss? Did you email him after to send your condolences for the loss been.
---
Good, delete all AT ships.
---
The uncertainty is exactly why it will ensure it happens less and less. And also, WHs were like that. Anyone interested in that kind of living had the chance before.
---
But, as I said, it wont happen often. Because you are going to find less and less content over time. Its gonna be capitals online in a whole another way.
---
[Yes.](https://i.redd.it/brmhqq5y2s931.jpg)
---
Yes that would be a bot, you are combining multiple keystrokes/actions into one action. I.E. violating the EULA/TOS.
---
Do you not understand the difference? Is it that hard?  
---
Me making a single key "press its self" gives me no advantage over actually pressing it myself.  
---
You making a multiple step process into one key, does give an advantage, because you can not normally do that yourself.   
---
Do you get it...you retard?
---
Same, lmao
---
CHEERZAH
---
COC discharge cuz it sounds funny though.
---
Pretty sure this is just coincidence. Raising any rewards during this blackout would tamper with the results of this experiment. And the impact on the "vanilla experience" of nullsec is what this all is about.
---
I hope not. The only use for local is "gf" after blobs engage. It should not be an avenue for intel. End of story.
---
&gt;Did I say that you could do it for every player? Just your corp alliance members in your corp kill log.
---
&gt;Show me how to search for a name in-game and view all his kills/losses.
---
Did I specify a corporation and/or alliance? No.
---
&gt;On the aggregation, this is an issue that goes far far longer then zkillboard has been around. They've been a thing well before the API has been a thing, or the killmail system we have now. 
---
We have now reached the point where at the very least should CCP stop providing this info in an automated fashion. Perhaps they should also remove key info from a KM so profiles cannot be created so easily.
---
&gt;The information / auto-profiling that's always been voluntary (on some level) and still is.
---
Definitely is not. There are many profiles on zkb that have no API key added. The intention is only to provide free intel on players who dont even want to be there for the purpose of messing with their gameplay.
---
Same here.
---
Who is talking about VNIs? Those are for newbros. And they will upship when they can.
---
The Chinese special
---
Hit the bell icon and never miss another blackout!
---
in dotlan's case the ingame map shows more up to date stats, its just aids to look at. you can watch ADMs going up in real time, this sounds like something to make the game more aids for people who actually do stuff by themselves and dont just get spoon fed by FCs (who will end up having to use the ingame map to find content)
---
It doesn't. You need to use your brain.
---
Cheeer the fuck ZAAHH
---
Some people can’t differentiate income vs net profit and we’ve got to teach them
---
They really are, the problem is there are so many of them, makes it hard to pick and choose! Pretty sure we have a group for about anything under the sun which is nice but also can make it hard to chose depending on the requirements of each one. My problem is I like doing A LOT of different things in EVE so focusing on just one thing is difficult for me.
---
My guess is you've spent too long afk rating and just haven't a clue how to PvP? 
---
Even before the blackout is never roam for even 20% of the time you say you did and see that little.
---
Are you using the in game map to about recent fights or something?
---
Actually it works. I have done it multiple times, and the entire fleet appears.
---
Some group which namens don‘t recall where dropping blops on SMA constantly. It was a smaller well funded and organized group. They caused a lot of chaos in SMA which ultimately let to them dropping out of the imperium and disbanding.
---
1337 420 bounty , nice touch
---
Two at ships down inside a day.
---
Is it just a coincidence, or is nullsec blackout giving AT pilots the extra encouragement to get put there with their magnificent ships.
---
Just a thought.
---
Would you watch a 10 minute video zoomed in on your hammerhead ii? There is no meaningful difference.
---
Spot the player who doesn't know what lowsec is?
---
I’m not just the Fuck snuff guy brav. It’s one of my many talents
---
They are only available in this manner if people authorize zkill. Are they submitted faster than manual submission? Often. But even back doing griefwatch days, the majority of killmails got posted. People would still do it by hand. You'd lose a few % of kills and that's it.
---
This might be true, but I was exploring both before and after the announcement recently, before the blackout, and got about 200 mil an hour. Might be a more consistent event now though
---
I had to admit that at first I saw no big deal in those forms of external intel provided by zKill or Dotlan; but to evidence I bow, the lack of that instant information are actually making the game dangerous and mysterious again.
---
CCP should totally delay that info for 24 hs.
---
It will still be there for general and strategic data gathering, but not as instant intel.
---
First off I don’t use zkill boards have plenty of kills without it , ps I have never used zkill for intel gathering. Dint even know that was a thing until this local blackout.
---
And you can’t argue to me that more people aren’t docked up , no need to act ignorant about that.
---
All I’m saying is why would I risk my nyx super ratting when I can take  less risk and just dive in a c3 c4 wh and make the same isk.
---
Yup. I got myself a carrier, which was tons of fun but even more work.
---
Tbh, i dont think there are many people who believes you would shoot at dark magni.
---
Wow, two whole days!
---
But the alliance pings told me to not login on the weekend?
---
NS is all that but 1/3 of the reward if no less.
---
but mah zkillboard
---
When they were released. Things change. You cant live in the past saying just because there once was a thought we cant ever do anything else.
---
Who do you think has been complaining the most about NS? Its fking NS dude. Check the CSM transcripts, its mostly NS people who are presenting issues and nerfs. CCP didnt give a shit. You know, we are human beings as well, we feel things too. Like boredom. And NS right now is saying, "dont do this CCP, instead give us a real reason to fight eachother. Make it easier to do so and so on".
---
And dude, you can get fights in LS whenever you want. You can get fights in Whs when you want. You can get fights in Horde and Brave space whenever you want. In Querious. That kind of living never went away, it just got smaller which is a damn shame, but it wasnt NS that pushed for all of that. It was CCP who wanted massive titan fights that generate headlines. Which never happened.
---
And whalers wouldnt rather fight a subcap fleet, they just want to kill as much as they can. If you wanna fight a NS alliance, ask them to ping for a fleet or mess with their sov and u will get a proper fight. But this isnt about proper fights, no local is only about a minority being able to easier get bigger kills on the majority.
---
Eh shouldn't be that hard. They just delay the ESI push by X and poof, delayed out of game information.
---
Local will most likely be fueled with an obtainable resource. Kinda like jump bridges or cyno Indians etc. Not permanently. But if a little difficulty makes you leave game. Good riddance eve has been too soft on people for years.
---
Oh man, I feel out of date not knowing what a zoomer guild is. HELP!
---
&gt; People want to see that epic fight developing half way across eve almost in real time as if they were there themselves
---
Another argument for delaying killmails. People would actually log in and haul ass to that system and that's a win for everyone.
---
then it doesn't have all the info zkill has does it
---
&gt;"But you can still chat in local!" Yeah, but no one in their right mind is going to now, are they.
---
So you're blaming your own issues on people that like this new change?
---
Theres nothing thats stopping you from being a socially outgoing person and shouting hello into every system you enter, people WILL answer, despite your mental problems that are telling you otherwise.
---
Stop putting your shit on other people and own it.
---
thats um, not how killmails work....loss mails show the exact same information as kill mails....because they are in fact the same mail. You get a copy when you lose a ship, and the guy who fragged you gets a copy when he kills you.
---
lal guise i'm drank!!!
---
If you really want that info you're welcome to program your own tool to query the Eve API and aggregate kills and location data.
---
I used to do factory setup P2 -&gt; P4. I used 3 storages and even with that was sometimes tight on space.
---
So they might be useless for your setup, but doesn't mean useless overall
---
You're in Bringing Solo Back right now, go ahead and post the mail ingame! I am sure you can have LordJason mail it to you.
---
Yeah you're pretty wrong. LS can absolutely lucrative with the right knowledge and while some parts are slow it is by no means dead. Fw could use tweaks tho.
---
this. I welped the shit out of a maelstrom doing something retarded, cost me only like 20 mil lol
---
If CCP shut down the API, zkb would probably lose 90% of posted KMs. 
---
It must be seen as established that free intel hurts the game, so even if people were to post a ton of KMs manually, there are other things CCP could do like removing some key info from KMs.
---
Getting rid of the automation must be a priority.
---
&gt;But even back doing griefwatch days, the majority of killmails got posted.
---
So whats that? 51%? Ultimately, you wouldnt really know what wasnt posted.
---
I'm starting to see that. I've even downvoted my post at this point for being so damn ignorant lol
---
it **is** a trash tier cruiser.
---
but it makes one hell of a heavy frigate
---
I am with you. But my man, supercap blobs arent even close to being dominant anymore. The nerf hit them superhard. You have real issues tracking smaller stuff. Same goes for titans. Those days are gone. And honestly, I dunno if they ever were the dominant form. Fighting in subcaps happens on a daily basis whilst supers seldom get used offensively.
---
This, right what you are saying are the issues in the game. Not local. Local was never the issue for the majority of players, only for the extremely niche group that likes to hunt VNIs n shit. The things you are saying is the same as we have been saying. I would love for the game to be vibrant with twice the amount of players, with tons of smaller groups instead of megaalliances, with wars and fights all over.
---
And this is exactly why Im saying no local is a shit change. It only makes things worse because smaller groups will get hit harder and move under umbrellas. NS will become more barren and concentrated. Its a step in the wrong direction.
---
You would get that hype if patches made a real difference.
---

Goons are part of Odin's Call. Although goons dont pay their krab rent so we end up having to farm them. Mittens is terrible at paying his rent on time.
---
I love it
---
This could be do to market forces
---
But you don't need those to populate in real time to get the information or the lulz. Thats the point Stainguy is making. The tools are good, they are useful, and its fun to laugh at stupid. But at the same time it is pretty evident after blackout weekend, than they do provide way to much realtime information.
---
If it was delayed by a day, heck even just a few hours, you wouldn't have that real time information, thus that roaming group who just fragged a bunch of folks in your pipe, may not be there when you arrive...contrast to "normal" and as soon as that roaming group starts racking up kills, you know where they are, what they are flying how many of them are there, and you know that they just killed within the last couple minutes so are probably still there, or around there, and you can hardcounter or blob them....all by looking at Zkill for near 100% accurate information and not having to interact with your corp/alliance/coalition.
---
Delaying that means you actually have to talk to people, people getting ganked need to report whats on field, how many, where, and how long ago, you have to take the chance on going after them because that intel may or may not be 100% accurate due to circumstance....especially with lack of local its a bit difficult to count and observe numbers when your ship is getting assblasted into dust and all you have is the ongrid overview to go by.
---
It is very nice
---
More important what does it say about the risk reward structure? Should we be buffing nullsec rewards to compensate or should we be nerfing WH to compensate. It seems crazy to me that everyone is ok with NS being more dangerous that WH.
---
Once some data has been public, it can be kept so, you can't enforce a retroactive/sunset visibility on kills.
---
What year is it?
---
What do you think the cloaky Proteus is doing on-grid before it tackles you? ;-)
---
I'm a wormhole resident (very infrequently in nullsec), and I LOVE this change. Nullsec is more dangerous, covops scouts have greater purpose, wormhole corps can operate in nullsec without tipping off any of the powers (maybe they're out killing Drifters, too.), and it's a buff to stealth in general (Combat recon ships that don't appear on D-Scan are essentially invisible in an environment with no local until they show up *on grid*, and ships that use covert ops cloaks are amazing when there's no local, as they can choose when they want to make themselves known, giving element of surprise.).
---
To survive without local, just remember to keep your eyes on your directional scanner, maybe grab a friend in a cloaky ship to scout for you, and make sure you've got some good safe spot bookmarks.
---
I may be the minority here but I want local back or at least give us the ability to bring it back with a structure null just seems so quiet
---
It called team play. Scouting and not being in null. Also holding cloak before moving. Situational and regional awareness, appropriate fitting, Intel channels, defence fleets. An also last but not least htfu and not assuming you  have the right to perfect Intel in an area that is allegedly dangerous. Hope it helps!
---
Confirmed, null bears are a hive mind controlled by idiot alliance "leaders"
---
Ore prices will rise, it will take forever to mine and be a much more risky venture. Total isk/hour probably remains about the same unless you're in umbrella space. All the blackout has done is reduce the amount of play time dedicated miners and ratters get if they aren't under a super umbrella, it doesn't improve their experience.
---
it's the same software, what did you expect?
---
That would be a fair compromise, although it depends on how long it takes to implement. I don't want to have to give up mining for a year while they piss around before implementation
---
How abyss pvp now with the trig hac? Probably pretty dead?
---
I dont get your point. NS has always been the target for hunters, its not new. And NS hunters do def exist and they are saying this is a shit change since its far less content out there. I mean outside of people killing bots and fighting with other day time safari hunters nothing is being killed in that sense. Not what I see and hear atleast, its far less that it used to and Im certain zkill will back me up when its up again.
---
in map settings they show kills, pods, and jumps. hope this helps fam
---
&gt;to see potential places to roam around or deploy to instead of sitting on the same gate for years?
---
In-game map shows recent killl counts, poddings, etc.
---
&gt;Or to find out if the player X that I used to fly with is stil playing.
---
Evemail/try convo them?
---
Kinda, but if it's permanent then I think a few things need to be changed for balance.  For one, even if you do everything perfect, it's way too easy to kill excavators.  Either make them faster and/or more durable; or give d-scan a range increase to cover the entire system so you can see bombers during that split second.
---
i don't get why ur so angry. the op is asking if you enjoyed the blackout. i said i didn't and i said why. also 80% of what u said doesn't make any sense lol
---
 so I'm currently looking at returning from what is effectively a 4 year break and logged in last night for the first time in over 2 years(thank you ccp for the alpha status, I probably wouldn't have ever come back if I had to pay to check it out again):
---
I have no alliance resources
---
I have to figure out skill training again (all the ques I had were omega ques, and I actually kind of like the 24 hour limit. way better than just plugging a skill plan in from eve Mon- which I know is dead) 
---
I dont even know where any of my assets are, or in many cases even which accounts have shit on them (ie a pi alt I was using and then forgot about that has probably half a billion worth of shit) 
---
most of the third party tools I know of are apparently outdated now (evemon, does osmium even work anymore?)
---
I don't have any overview settings saved that work anymore (does sarashawa still do the most popular settings?)
---
wtf happened to all the mechanics I was just figuring out, such as moon mining? apparently the shit actually has to be mined now? that's quite interesting...... unfortunately no more siphon though 😟
---
new race of ships? all sorts of new structures in the overview? 
---
all of this has forced me to actually think about shit again. before it was like "the only reason I need money is to have more variety of doctrine ships, no need to worry about replacement with srp" and "hmm, I want to expand my hangar, better log into the good ole incursion alt or run some escalations to print some money". or just throwing together some meta fit when I needed a ship, with maybe a couple of personal tweaks here and there.
---
now if I want to fit a ship, I have to worry about what modules I can actually use. "what, i can't put a cloak on? how am I supposed to cloak+mwd?" and skill que management is a thing again, rather than just throwing gallente battleship 5 in the que and not worrying about getting all the short little skills in there before the big long one. 
---
tldr: it just feels like I can experience the game almost anew now that I have been absent for 25% of its life.
---
Ah. Thanks for the info. Have heard of the group but never really got the story.
---
I just love how you use this post to conclude that I'm not a socially outgoing person when the post is literally about how I miss a social aspect that was there before. Well done.
---
ngl I really want to hear more of the Saga of Targ
---
No, I did not enjoy playing EVE today, cause work.
---
I have always hated nothing more than taking a fleet out to look for gfs and finding not a single gate camp to clear.
---
Oh haha. Gotcha. Guessing it's new then? But was a very welcomed bonus.
---

---
Nice video bro
---
And that is fun for the first week or so, after that it gets tedious and down right exhausting to try and be an Indy player and constantly having to look over your shoulder to that degree. The problem is that without local CCP has given us no other way to gather Intel short of parking alts on every single gate and just physically watching them, which is hardly content or enjoyable. It skews the game so far into the opposite direction that it is unenjoyable and down right unplayable for a large portion of the population.
---
apocalypse incoming....

This thread...

A big Yikes from me dog.

i always use standard crash booster. i roll it on cotadel. NEVER click approach to any BS. you can click orbit only when you web BS and rats with web killed. and i always start moving at 45 degrees to BS.
---
I rapidly blinked a few times when I read this. I could see the recalibrating message and it annoyed me.
---
Not really, people just get stuck in a mindset. I do agree that the game is not in a state where it's easy to spoon-feed people content. But it's quite rewarding for people with the balls to go out and hunt, and set up traps, etc. 
---
Undock, learn who is where, what is where and when is that what/who happening. Trust me the game gets exponentially more fun when you get out there and cause some chaos. (Take this as a challenge/invitation :p)
---
I'm ok with the delay, but I feel like not having the fitting info would be a bad move.
---
There's so many more people in space, actually doing things though. Roaming space hasn't felt this 'alive' in years!
---
And there it is again: the awesome propaganda :-)
---
How about no?
---
The only sub numbers I care about is my friends returning to the game. If botters, serial crabs and doomsayers want to unsub then I'll happily show them the door.
---
yeah your videos are so much better tbh
---
Leave the corp and find somewhere new. Try something you havent done before. Or reach out to old friends who left the corp and join up with them
---
Except Squizz just a couple weeks ago stopped corp API verification from being "public" on zkillboard, because a large group decided it didn't want that intel to be public. 
---
This is why the delay should be done by CCP across the board, so that it's not up to the makers of the tool.
---
I cant talk in local so now I have no friends... Nice logic...
---
oh is that from the time you got a fleet of lokis pds'd?
---
me? i was just a cutie flying a dread
---
KB’s are a passive way to learn that info. You could message that player (dunno if people do that anymore).

The meta game is a good thing; and sometimes it can be too much of a good thing.  Im not upset or anything fyi, I guess this weekend + all the negativity Im hearing about it was too much for me. You do you. :)
---
OBJECTION
---
Don't forget that it can be external. You can sponsor a lossmail in Zkillboard, and sometimes I see some losses with no real reason as they look like normal ones, but maybe it is a local celebrity or any other reasons that I ignore.
---
The mock factor exists in this game unlike his competitors, and it is a high decensitive to take risks. And while I want to play spaceships, I don't want to play the shame game and I doubt that I am alone on this part.
---
I also like to do and try stuff by myself instead of relying on guides, as discovery is a part of any game... but if I do that, my "journal" will suffer and consequences will happen.
---
Killboards has a specificity who make them worst than anything : it is not a creation of CCP who only provided an external API, they are created by players. So that means that SOME players decided that &gt; I &lt; must play the game by THEIR rules and made sure that I can't avoid them. Praise be to BoB, or else...
---
An option to hide the player name with counter-parts as stated in my first post, won't forbid you to use it as a journal nor as an intel tool to get battle-reports and check war progression. You would just not see my name -only my corp/alliance- and I will be able to lose armored ravens without shame (Hum no, I won't pilot that =) ). It will just offer to not play the shame game for the ones who activate it.
---
All tokens should be removed from the game so alliances cant spy on their members as a requirement. These are way too powerful spy detecting etc tools.

The lake duck holds the Guinness World Record for having the largest avian reproductive organ, from a specimen in Córdoba, Argentina that had a penis measuring 42.5 centimetres (16.7 in).
---
Until now local chat has been a free source of intel which has made no sense from a lore perspective. Finally there is something that makes space scary again and you already want to "even" the playing field. Fly cloaky yourself and catch unawares your bogey man attackers...
---
I enjoyed the story :)
---
Lol. Is that real?
---
Dude, just stop giving a fuck about it, you are the one making a big deal out of it. Who cares what others think?
---
Been my experience too.
---
Normal weekend is usually 3 times as bad as that and thats just Monkey attack squad
---
No more local?! I must have to watch all my bot alts at once!!!! Hnnnnng!!!!!
---
I was thinking about that the other day... If say, goons wanted to reestablish their rental program in lowsec, they might actually be able to do it this time, I don't know if there are enough people in lowsec to resist.
---
Permanent isn't needed IMHO. Make delayed mode in nullsec 15 minutes, lowerable to 10, 5, and 1 via disableable structures.
---
Not really, we just go after the weak ones because we know they call in for reinforcements, and it's the other PVPers that we want to fight.
---
I hope you do realize that it is a MMO game. You can't avoid social interactions... and maybe you didn't play enough video games to realize how statistics can ruin the fun, even if you try to forget their existence.
---
Damn, I just realize that I am old...

I am here to protect them by hoarding as many as I can

[On my way](https://i.imgur.com/YofnGES.jpg)...
---
You honestly never know man
---
Straight after dt on friday people started posting in bsb chat many killmails out of tenal, branch, fade... So the kills are out there to be had.
---
Then again its a bit luck of the draw. Off timezone for those regions i also roamed and did not have much luck, but i did not rush to say that its blackout's fault...
---
This is what null roaming is like. Then again i went down south earlier today and got plenty of content over the course of two hours... More than i could shake a stick at. I killed, i died, i did not get super blobbed and there were plenty of randomers out and about in small groups.
---
Delve is our home.
---
Feel free to stop by, but expect a response though.
---
No local is fine I think, but perma cloaked campers should go, or give a counter to them at least
---
Switch to another group, plain and simple. You either invest IRL money or time to accumulate in game wealth to plex your account, you should go after what makes the game fun for you, it's not worth being bored.
---
I want a structure that provides 1 minute local in it's system, 5 1 jump away, and 10 2 jumps away.
---
Can't overlap so plan carefully. Also doesn't affect systems you lack sov in. Nor cross region jumps.
---
It's just like real life mate, you can choose how you form relations with, and who you don't give a single fuck about.

Not that complicated.

And I've been playing video games since they were created.

Prefer if they just disabled the servers, be the first good decision they've made in a long time.

You should be able to see in your wallet journal where the money came from.

As somebody from the original Jersey, I'd like to mandate that you yanks always include "New" whenever you talk about it.

Well done man! Keep it going!

Okay :(

Try to pm people directly, who you want to talk to.

&gt;Chremoas killed by a Virtuoso
---
Nothing fishy here, moving on
---
&gt; **but real change was easily noticed when the zkill went dark and then dotlan**. 
---
Please provide a causal link for this assertion. All you have is some correlation, not a causation. Gate camps can easily be explained by blackout and the hype surrounding it alone. No shit people are out in space doing pvp. Blackout is only the most eagerly embraced change since probably the capital rework!
---
Not that I would particularly mind, but especially dotlan has uses for pvp content creators as well. No argument against delaying zkillboard, except that people probably like to brag about their awesome kill on discord right away, not a day or two later.
---
Frat was doing that on TQ about a year ago. You remember when they ran 2-3 tempest fleets at once. Ya. The hole in the client they used was thankfully closed.
---
The problem I'm seeing is that a lot of large and small veteran corps have evolved their "content" and enjoyment to be entirely dependent on third-party tools that they figure may as well be first-party. Forget  any other nullshit you hear about this, the whole thing comes down to being so dependent on a couple tools that aren't even part of CCP that they are gonna throw some feces at the walls and be forced to re-evolve or go extinct  (actually quit, not just threaten).
---
The bat is the only mammal that can fly.
---
I thought we just discovered hits can’t be evaded daggers. Doeboy Yolowhirl anyone??? Too bad they’re only ilvl 55. 2.7K hp ez maps tho.
---
The more you know
---
It is an interesting concept and we need to let it run its course.
---
However what about enabling the characters or fleets in local chat once they engage in aggression?
---
Sure, but it hurts CCP. We live in a real world and as a company, they have to care about their bottom line. It would be naive to expect them not to.
---
Thanks for the tip guys, I appreciate it greatly.
---
Make stainguy posting invisible out of game imo
---
This would make lowsec good again !
---
Join one of the majot facwar corps in your tz... Sounds like it will suit your tastes well
---
Actually, there are other ways of obtaining intel. Intel channels have not always existed, and keep in mind that zKill is blacked out as it is, and being in a fleet for mining should happen regardless. If anything, be in a standing fleet. I thought standing fleets and being on comms was required by most alliances. Most of the losses I have seen were because people did not have d-scan open, they did not have any sort of support, they were not aligned out. You can still get intel from the intel channel, but keep in mind that players are being incredibly picky with their targets right now. They don't have zKill or dotlan, so they are relying on the map to show them players in space and shit. The game is not unplayable. there used to be a life before these damn intel channels, and you had to rely on d-scan anyway. If you are being cautious and not afk mining, you shouldn't have a problem.
---
As the saying goes: do not use ships or modules you can't afford to lose or replace. It's common sense. If you feel unsafe when mining, then you should probably join and standing fleet and be on comms.
---
Oh and yeah, I just re-installed after four years off and just watching the meme spittle dry in this sub. Spent, I guess, $50 total on couple packs and PLEX since this is a brand new account. You got me, CCP.
---
Our server has been okay yesterday and today
---
Your own internal inability to come to grips with your own cowardice isn't my problem, its yours, by your own admission nothing is stopping you from being the same socially outgoing person you used to be but, well, you.
---
I didn't choose to be in Zkillboard, I wasn't asked about that. 
---
And exactly, I want to not give a single fuck about mostly everyone in this game, and the best way would be to permit me to disappear from any external records =)
---
More seriously, I think that our positions and ways are too opposed. I played to some video games where statistics attracted bad ambiance and/or cheaters and others morons (classic FPS, MMO RTS, etc.) and so I think bad about them.
---
In EVE, it has bad influence too. And since the blackout, I had the opportunity to do some fights that we would have avoided because they would be too risky. It was fun. No local and no Zkillboard is a decent mix, I like it. But I also know that many use them for valid reasons, that is why I purposed said option. Would it change something for your game ?
---
I wasn't aware that the ingame map showed kills on gates specifically. I don't think that the map has ever been that detailed. But, you could probably figure it out if you do some math (destroyed ships/pods as well as jump gates used.
---
Must of been a good day...
---
Meh. That's locustfleet it happens with or without local. Casual mining is definitely down. We'll see in the MER.
---
The issue is, maybe it should be this way anyway.
---
I'd be in favor of all of the available intel on activity, skills, and everything else being removed other than name and hull type. I dont think fits should be shown, or that activity patterns should be available.
---
&gt; EA keeps the game up for it's historical significance
---
I cannot imagine this to be true, at all.  Do you have any reason for thinking this?
---
Trying to explain "Old" Jersey to yanks is always hilarious though, so there's that.
---
&gt;Small island off the coast of France
---
&gt;so you're French?
---
&gt;no, we're part of Britain but not the UK
---
&gt;??????
---
Alliances always used to have their own killboard, and there were a couple that everyone used.
---
Yet the economic health of more returning vets and paying for sub directly vs inflating the price of plex further.
---
Sure they care about bottom line, of course, but it will be interesting to see the real numbers of paid for accounts subbing/unsubbing compared to the bots who have logged off.
---
Lol. Git that rent!
---
Sweet, ill addy the channel, cant make it tonight, but ill try and come out with you guys.
---
again
---
there's no reason to do any of that.
---
a lot, a bunch, tons, a shitton, Fuckloads,
---
I knew there just of been a Jersey, didnt know where it was tho xd
---
I wish everything in this game still gave me that sense of wonderment and tingling feeling. I envy you new guy. I hope you stay long enough to become a bittervet
---
Yup. In an ideal world, enough older players come back and resub to compensate for all the krabs and bots unsubbing. I just think everyone who is super-hyped about the blackout is ignoring some pretty massive (potential) downsides.
---
good job
---
This website has some fittings and you can search for alpha-only fits. I can't guarantee that they're all good, but it's the best search tool I found so far.
---
https://www.eveworkbench.com/fitting
---
But that is good for you. You mine for ten minutes to make what used to take hours. That lowers your risk.
---
Lol. Go break up the Tama gate camp if u want a fight.
---
You cannot rely on d-scan, far too much stuff can either warp ontop of you before you can jump even when you are aligned or just simply does not show up on d-scan. Cloaked ships, recon ships, they will hit the grid and tackle you long before you actually jump. Standing fleet and coms are all well and good in larger alliances but for those small to mid size ones they are only so helpful. You cannot even pretend this update doesn't screw those corps and alliances the hardest, it basically forces you to join umbrella space or just give up on Indy.
---
It doesn't lower your risk, and contrary to popular belief, there are some of us who ENJOY mining. Battleships and capitals also still take the same amount of minerals, so you're taking twice or three times as long to mine out the ores for them, it's miserable.
---
Lol, I know the feeling. I've taken a few multi-year breams from Eve over the years! It's a lot easier to get back into the swing when you kick any semblance of a multiboxing addiction (or never had one to begin with) though :)
---
You have to try track position.
---
Your memory is not wrong, it originally was 250k and gave you plex when the other person subscribed. Now, they nerfed the rewards that you get but give 750k to new players instead.
---
I’ve been living out of my dreadnought throughout wormhole and K-space for a while. It’s pretty great. I hear PVP carriers are pretty chill too. If I were you I’d totally get one. I think minmatar capitals are the best in the game though.
---
Mmm lesser players means lesser targets. It should go the other way. 
---
We need different changes, some of which you have presented yourself.
---
i don't understand why ur trying to buff and encourage the lowest, most braindead form of pvp (gate camping) and make solo even more of a hassle than it already is but ok
---
Why is it CCPs fail?
---
Ahh the wormhole version of a white picket fence.
---
Get a scout to check if any ships are on grid? Or an alt to help fight off hunters?
---
Because you can’t move the command centers, meaning you you would need to launch a new one  each time you move the build.
---
Instead you just leave the command center wherever and rebuild the rest where the rich spot is.
---
Gotcha now. Thanks, what I was confused on was that the same RNG number applied to both your hit chance _and_ your damage.
---
I have two accounts with long pending sub.  I have second training license for one account that has lapsed.  When I get out of the hospital I will work on a quicker complete disconnect from eve if blackouts are going to keep on being a thing.  
---
If the goal is higher logon rates, this is moronic.  It benefits poor quality "pirates", at the effective cost of imposing a cloaky camper in every system in null.  We know for absolute fact what cloaky campers do - alliances are so sure of the results that they will hire mercs to do it.
---
Sothe dumbassess hoping for easy kills will be disapointed, You'll get far fewer targets.
---
The relative effect on really big groups is less.  If you can afford to keep a cyno in a set of systems and even a modest response fleet and Titan on standby, you going to stay ahead in both the isk war and raw ships lost count.  Ergo, the goons get even more control of mineral markets.  Ultimately the blue donut becomes even more so.  Quit or join a really big alliance.  Mittens is right about this being a good thing....from a goonish point of view.
---
Ccp should be alarmed because some internal ideologe got his way - there will probably be more quits than moves.  But they've taken a huge step to oppress small alliances and the evidence that Ccp actual wants a big blue donut is now more compelling than any motion that they want a meaningful shift in the status quo.
---
Any argument that "you don't deserve the space if you can't hold it" well, your really arguing for a min size for null alliances (unless you really believe that goons are quality over quantity).  You're arguing for restricting null to alliances of some min size or more.  Raising that bar will not make eve a more attractive proposition.  It will make NRDS easier on a per say basis- fewer other groups to keep track of.
---
No big fights since everyone is busy gatecamping their own homes.
---
I've seen and felt the first downsides, hisec trade is really sucky right now. Lots of shit is getting hilariously expensive.
---
Yes there will be more long-term downsides but goddamn this game needed a shakeup and I, for one, am having so much fun I don't really care what is over the horizon.
---
And I'm saying change it. so the loss (aka the ship that died) shows up immediately and the killers (aka what they're in) show up later
---
Casual mining may or may not be down, will defo need to wait for the MER, but the effects will be felt more by the  small guys rather than the big Alliances.
---
Here here. I’ve always thought the idea of third party tools being an integral part of gameplay is completely nuts. 
---
I suggested on reddit that zKill type functionality might as well be built into the game, such is the reliance and use of it from the regular player base. Was shot down in flames at the time and told ‘the ability to draw on third party tools is the hallmark of a higher level player’. It’s completely perverse. Level the playing field, give people what they need - and only what they need - from within the game and let people prove themselves under a fairly balanced environment.
---
To that note, where does the use of third party tools start to become cheating? Yeah, there’s the EULA and it’s fairly clear, but I feel like there’s probably a tempting and not huge progression from someone using zKill &gt; Pirates Little Helper &gt; Some kind of intel system &gt; Local alerts &gt; Full on botting.
---
Anyhow, I know that this post is focused on limiting or delaying timing of intel and I back it. What I WOULD say, is that it might be a more enjoyable experience if CCP introduced better mechanics for gaining bits of information in game during combat — for example, WAY sexier and more informative weapon effect graphics, so you can work out what weapons they are using (inspecting and checking turrets is ok, but a bit unengaging and takes you out of piloting). Also much improved combat logs, so you can get quicker visual feedback about what is going on during a fight — I just feel like these things would start to make fights feel exciting and dynamic. Reacting to the situational circumstances and feeling in the moment.
---
Your video card is probably on strike trying to draw the nebulae, maybe that's what caused it?
---
why should people get free intel ccp should just do the scorecard and no more info
---
Yeah I don't disagree with that. You'll see heavy reduction in Delve mining though. I don't need to wait for MER to tell that, because I already have eyes in all systems hunting Excavs.
---
If you don't like it, don't watch it. Otherwise your critic is not constructive or make a better one.
---
Thankfully CCP stopped that nonsense for now. 
---
Also if you are looking for a game with good PvE EVE is not it.
---
I thought Odins Call was our renters that Goons farmed. Have you not seen the killmail?
---
&gt;  42,827  Kills remaining to be fetched.  
---
That's since Friday at 1100 UTC atm.
---
I really hope CCP can find a way to just slightly delay the killboard info, even 45 minutes would be significant enough to change the real-time nature of it!
---
Pretty sure we ran into that Kiki gang after you. If it's any consolation we managed to kill a couple before having to withdraw due to half our logi getting blapped after being slow off the gate we ran into them at. Those things are beastly after they ramp up and would've eaten the entire fleet if we let them.
---
Well your alliance showed everyone on this sub reddit in the past months that your alliance is the alpha-race and you are just better then everyone.
---
Funny to see how triggered your are by one video against the hundreds of goonposts ranting about panfam and how bad they are.
---
Thanks for the good vid mate! :)
---
That's locust fleet which happens a couple times a month. Nobody is using excavators in mining anoms right now because there is no counter to bomber fleets. The ones that are trying it are learning quickly that it's not worth the risk.
---
Delayed/no local is fine, but some counter play mechanic is required required to balance it.
---
It is not efficient at all, it’s never running continuously, and you have to rebuild everything periodically.
---
A regular extraction planet/factory planet set up you only have to rebuild the extractors when they run dry.
---
But my PI is a 30min every other day thing, would be cool to figure out the best hands off/once a week set up.
---
Even Olmeca is saying the numbers are down.
---
I never said it didn’t. I was simply pointing out that many years ago we still went mining in the middle of a war with no fucking intel. Instead, I believe that they had alts spread out in cloak ships to get the intel. I understand how small alliances are not okay with it, and as far as we know this is simply a test. If it isn’t, then just like every other feature they have introduced, CCP will run a patch introducing changes similar to those posted by Eve players and then asks for even more feedback.
---
D-scan can always be fixed.  It hasn’t been touched too drastically since they patched the server to prevent recons from appearing. And the entire point of a cloaky ship is to do what they are doing now. If D-Scan was improved to go with the patch, I am sure it would be just fine. A really idea that I just thought of is bubbling all gates with anchored warp disruptor modules. Then, have gate camps on the gates. Have alliance members camp the gate and sit on those bubbles and kill everything that came through.
---
Do level 4 missions send you to lowsec sometimes? Does it depend on your proximity to low-sec regions?
---
cause his posting is bad and he should feel bad
---
Net loss due to OCD insisting that D-Scan has to be at least the same size as my overview. I need another monitor.
---
Thank you, for API im actually using them for my own page , not a kill board just collecting intel and make some visualizations. Hope you put the page back online soon so i can continue with my page.
---
Yeah lots of reddit PVP going on. If you're not unconditionally loving the blackout, you get blobbed out of existence.
---
polo
---
It was a 4k drop during primetime, saturday afternoon.
---
You will see a reduction in mining in those systems outside the Umbrella, and larger fleets inside it.  Getting so you cant swing a cat in some systems, without hitting a Rorq
---
playing marco/polo is good one too
---
But but, easier VNI kills. Fking amazed that they dont realise even if its easier to kill a VNI now, it will be massively harder to actually find one in space. Its gonna be capitals online for sure now.
---
Probably is. You can bet the speculators have been heavily snapping up exploration loot with the expectation that'll it's going to get much more expensive as exploration will be more dangerous at the travel phase. Once they get onto a site they're only vulnerable between cloaks and will probably be safe enough.
---
i chuckled
---
I know that EVE is generally about PvP, tho I think some more PvE would do the game some good.
---
I know that it's an outsider view tho.
---
I've heard about the game from a friend who playes it and it got me curious, but so far, I haven't been into it enough to actually give it a try.
---
school during the summer?
---
Dude, they will leave no matter. You think NS dwellers are just gonna keep on doing what they did pre-no local? Numbers are down all over, less players logged on, less ratters, especially subs, less miners. So they will have fun for a couple of days then realise, shit, literally nothing to hunt and decide to leave. But by then CCP might have fked over enough of the actual subscribers that the dip is permanent.
---
And that is why you never go full retard.
---
phorde has been trying this desperately. I think they get confused that we haven't been replying :/
---
I totally agree on the limited killmails, zkill is such a powerful tool to see what gangs or groups are out in space and what they are flying, without me having to even undock.
---
Yet another wormholer who shits on the opinion of a nullseccer when it comes to NS. Its refreshing. WHs are not the same as NS, start understanding that there are differences which cannot be replicated.
---
I think he means launchpad as in spaceport. Not command center. 
---
Spaceport holds 10k m3, command center only 500m3.
---
CCP has been very good recently about giving players more and more control of things. Perhaps as part of the ESI authorization, we could choose a delay (let's say immediate, 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day). That way those who don't have intel concerns and want to be able to share their killmails out of game right away can still do so while those who want to control information more have that option as well.
---
Too much information takes away the fun.
---
It's funny how players could not have done  this anyway regardless of blackout
---
I use it all the time, I wish I could add other games to it tho so I can hot switch between eve and something else
---
rent free in your head
---
I totally agree. Most of the people saying otherwise dont understand that their circumstances might differ from what you are describing. Ive had more conversations in local than pretty much any other place Eve related and Ive gotten to know tons of people that way. But hey, we can go fk ourselves since its not us living there right? NS is for everyone who doesnt live their obviously.
---
It is delayed... you will automatically appear in local after 27 continuous hours.
---
The only problem is the server reset every 23.75 hours...
---
/s
---
On subject of resolution, is there a way to get this game spanning across multie screens? Doesn't seem to work in fixed mode with a 2x resolution. Using a 2080 rtx
---
I just finished the SOE epic arc. I stopped in chapter two... back in May, 2009
---
You'll have to do some reading on it. 
---
The last I checked it had been passed on to another branch studio that maintains a lot of the older MMOs. It's a small studio with only a handful of Devs. 
---
Max concurrent player count on the largest shards is only 500-600 players from the info I gathered, and there's 27 shards. I believe a subscription costs $12.99 and there's an item shop. You can do some napkin math to figure that revenue isn't going to be stellar. Maybe barely enough to cover costs once you consider salaries, taxes, overhead, etc.
---
The PvE isn't as bad as he claims. There are many different types of PvE in the game, with all levels of risk and reward. There is PvE that requires teams and plenty of solo PvE. If theory crafting to get quicker PvE runs is your thing, this is the game for that. The theory crafting is endless.
---
Right away or only when they plex?
---
Looking at the fits etc, this looks is a little bot suspicious...
---
Red robin
---
Uhhh...that was part of the joke. Since zKill has been down all of the naysayers have been claiming that nothing has been happening and nobody has been losing ships, especially Goons.
---
Maybe not as bad as you eh?
---
Dude, I have no idea where you are but NS isnt as active as youre saying it is. And also, right now its an event type thing. Everyone from all over is in NS but remove them, which will happen very soon since people tire extremely fast, and you are left with a lot less than before.
---
And it would be extremely funny if you are out in the places where activity used to be high before and using it as a reference, which I highly suspect that you are.
---
I miss my BRs. I know that some people scour Zkillboard to find (and avoid) fights, but really, I use it to see the stuff that is happening elsewhere as you said, like I was there, or when I'm on the bus to/from work and need to see how my fellow Corp peeps are doing at defending our stuff. I don't want to have to wait 24 hours to laugh at us feeding a fleet, or to gloat on comms about how good we did, that is an awesome part of the game, I feel.
---
Make it slightly delayed, not real time (30 minutes? 1 hour?): Zkillboard should be a learning tool to see fits, to understand how a certain Region of space is, and
---
Another option is that if you do like the alliance then you could try switching corps within the alliance. Moving to another corp to find a better group, but within the same alliance isn't uncommon.
---
Not when bots/krabs who have local in the corner while watching netflix instantly align out when a neutral comes into local...
---
How is that a joke? You're a moron. Not related to CCP at all
---
Lol, people have gone full retard man. Its fast reaching the point where arguments no longer matter.
---
Havn't been this excited for Eve since Apocrypha.
---
Pretty sure your username should be “jackbedocked”. How many years did it take to record this footage?
---
Why do I have to explain everything? 
---
If you've been following any of the narrative spin about the whole Blackout event, a lot of players, mostly Goons, have been trying to say it's a complete failure by CCP, there's no killing happening, the farmers are staying docked, it doesn't matter for Goons because they have super umbrella, etc. 
---
It was sarcasm about the narrative being spun that it's another failed move by CCP. 
---
Jesus fucking Christ I have to spell everything word for word for you retards
---
Yeah, everyone else is the fucking retard. Right, yeah.
---
What it proved is that temporary changes shake things up.
---
If it came from another player... He's a tight bastard
---
For a game that proclaims to have such an intelligent userbase, yeah, you're a bunch of fucking dongs. How hard is sarcasm to get?
---
Thanks for this! Exactly the type of info I was looking for. I guess my nereus is fitted for group combat of some kind as a support salvager. What do you think I was using it for?
---
Imo botting level 5 missions would be quite a bit more difficult to automate and (I think, I don't run them) require caps to do in an afk manner.
---
Also if you roam through the botter regions you'll notice that the majority are 2019 accounts, vni alts only need a few months of training to run anoms effectively so the number of bots can be scaled up quite easily.
---
Anyway obviously there's other ways for rmt sellers to make money but they're much less efficient. I don't think there's any denying this will hurt rmt sellers significantly.
---
When you factor in the low isk/sp investment, high safety, high scalability and ease of automation, I don't think anything will compare to vni botting in renter space with active local.
---
Imagine being this big of a cunt over a shitty failed joke :))))
---
Mittens needs to make his rent and car payment.
---
So, when I commit capitals to krab in wormhole space, I’m committing 8b worth of dreads. They’re sieged while doing any manner of DPS. When I get tackled, there is no one to come save me. There are a dozen groups rolling to find ratters just like me.
---
Your notion that, because null no longer has a form of intel... that this somehow makes it more risky than wormhole space...?
---
If you join a bigger group in null, you can light a cyno and summon help.
---
If I join a bigger group in wormhole space, I have to go take my own farmhole, because a single wormhole system won’t sustain an entire wormhole corp.
---
At least he can't get blue balled.
---
Imagine being this big of a cunt because you're too fucking dull-witted to get a simple joke
---
r/woooosh
---
You are making huge assumptions across the board. There is nothing that ensures that all of the ones who stopped playing will ever rejoin. And the people rejoining right now is marginal and they will leave as soon as the content dries up.
---
So net will be a huge loss.
---
Besides, the bot argument is poor. They can move to HS and still make tons of isk. I have also seen a large uptick in NS exploration bots since the drifter invasion so bots wont stop, they will never stop because they dont care. Real players stop.
---
I would think a fragile and fuel hungry structure that needs very (every 4-7 days) frequent tending and RFs / dies to a half dozen bombers in 10-15 minutes would be balanced...
---
You do if youre not a fucking idiot lmao imagine being so dim witted you don't get the joke lmao
---
Maybe you should apply that to this whole fucking thread. My fucking brain hurts trying to imagine how fucking dimwitted some people are. I'm literally hoping they're just trolling me
---
My man, there are other ways to bot than VNI ratting. I bet you that many of the botter started switching as soon as the drifters became active. Check the explo bots, I have seen tons more of them in the last month than ever before.
---
You don't need to have some crazy action filled cinematic event to have a good story. If you need some crazy over the top editing to enjoy a film, the story is probably shit. If you can't be happy with the simple things in life, nothing probably will.
---
This post is actually just a cover up for six million isk worth of RMT
---
If hunting for bots and accidentally running into other gangs is causing fights then that's worrying.  What happens when the bots all die and stop logging in? Why do you have to use bots for a reason to have Good fights? 
---
You dont, just form fleets and go have some fun with others that form fleets.. you shouldnt need any other reason
---
Yep. "Told you so." Years ago.
---
But mainly I'm glad they're finally doing it.
---
It's the reason I'm going to try Eve again and poke around if that's worth anything.
---
I think you've demonstrated in the other thread how fucking ignorant you are. I like that I'm worth your time to try to follow me around to cross post in other threads. 
---
If anything I think you reinforced my statement
---
I think the blackout is causing people to try things they wouldn't have before. If they find they like it they'll try to find a way to do it even if local comes back.
---
Eve isn't for you.  Go back to WOW.
---
&gt;sees someone in a thread positions right next to theirs

&gt;surely he can't be sorting by new, he's following me!
---
The mind of a peasant
---
I presume bots will become easy targets now. Is there any way to tell if someone has entered the system without sitting at the gate? Has anyone tried image processing to detect gate flashes?
---
Cloakies and force recons will become massively powerful as they should IMO.
---
Marco
---
Yep. An agent can send you ~ 3 or 4 jumps out.
---
To echo a comment I posted in another thread yesterday; this is by a long shot the most extreme change that has been made to Eve since the Citadel Update. I highly caution against pushing CCP to 'over-balance' in their usual manner and risk causing a tipping point for the major null entities.   
---
As u/CCP_Bartender has already said, the only reason we have zKillboard is because literally every active corporation in the game has given Squizz access to their ESI tokens. I think this proves that the average player wants this kind of resource available to them.   
---
As for DOTLAN, something that many people may not be aware of is that it doesn't actually update at the same rate as the in-game map. All calls related to the map are bound by a one hour caching timer, including the one used for the Coveted "Ratting Deltas" stat. This already makes this a less than useful source of information, and I can say from personal experience of trying to weaponize that part of the API that the other stats (system jumps/kills) are also near useless due to that delay.
---
It's interesting that I was the only one worth responding to though.
---
Or maybe you refuse to use the counter play because its not a super / titan.
---
The problem is this is CCP we are talking about, they will be years in addressing the actual problems with their big change, instead they are just going to throw it out there. Cloaked ships were a problem before the blackout, this just makes the problem even worse. I'm all for the blackout if they actually give us some way to interact with it outside of parking a cloaked ship on the gate. I know it was done in years past but it was BS then and it's BS now lol.
---
Notifying a neutral that they're about to get hunted down and podded is a very real-man wormholer thing to do, I feel. Going to try this next time I wander into one and see how many come for me.
---
We will spread the glory of bob to the heretics!
---
Actually it took 3 months, right after your [Lack of Initiative.](https://youtu.be/SlV-Grsy_fM)
---
Blackout hides hunters and hunted alike. Hunters need to scan down more territory before moving on. Ratters otho need to learn how to use their d-scan more often - and/or place sentries cloaked up on gates. 
---
I have full confidence this change will work for both parties (and against) and as usuall force players to adapt
---
I've been saying this for years. That guy is actually talking about ganking, not pvp.
---
Oh man, I used to love trolling bubbled gate camps back in the day in an exploration Heron. The survival rate was crazy. Only a fraction of camps with interceptors could get me.
---
As long as I get to look at my elite f1 and f2 plays. I wouldn't mind a delayed Zkill.
---
Although its far from definite due to lack of data, yes the numbers are down. This is without taking into account that many probably resubbed and still the numbers are down. People keep saying the number of bots are down without any sort of evidence to back it up. Bots can do other activities in other places and Im certain they have by no means stopped making isk since thats irl income for some. Bots earn isk to be sold for money and believing the bot handlers will just stop working because of an event is naive at best.
---
But nothing we say or do will matter because people will see what they want to see. They keep using the argument that NS is more alive than ever before without any long term data to support it but wont accept the player count drop since its too little data.
---
The Drifter attacks stopped once the Blackout 48 Hour Early Warning went up.
---
The Triglavian Invasions from what i've seen on streams is a massive step up in PvE mechanics and gameplay. A lot more goes into dealing with them than any other form of EVE PvE and they are no push overs either.
---

You have to be smart to have fun in this game.

Which places? Im fairly certain you are going to places where fights used to occur before.
---
As the FC of this bomber fleet please un-taint our frags from your shit tier posting.
---
Eh, seeing what they lost in their fit and how good or bad it was is part of that scorecard imo.
---
In Nullsec a significantly larger fleet can come kill me. You don't need as big a response fleet in wormholes because wormhole mass size limits how big of a fleet can come kill you. In null I can't even begin to scout what is coming because of both types of cynos.
---
Why you haven't expressing thoughts about supercap umbrella counter play? or this simply bother your interests?
---

So your d-scan spam bot isn't working against hunter bombers and t3c? Too bad.
---
Ahahhahahhahah
---
This was pure gold ! This russian FC still around ?
---
Tbh removing all Intel in game should be done it's stupid
---
How many pilots in system
---
How many NPCs killed
---
How many jumps being made

Where cynos are lit
---
For instance
---
If you like talking in local so much then just stay at jita.
---
Ye dscan down bomber fleets for me please. 2 things that you rarely find in the 2 other places where dscan is regularly used.
---
Just because your under a super umbrella doesn’t mean your ship is saved lol , all I’m saying it is riskier getting caught now especially in a super class ship which if your ratting efficiently your doing 100 mil per tick avg , it’s possible to do that in wh space with less isk invested in it while having probably less risk because you can’t light a Cyno up in k space.
---
If the mechanics of null space is the same as wh plus you get Cyno drops risk added , you tell me what makes sense here. 
---
Super umbrella doesn’t make you immune lol
---
Against ALL Authorities is still existing, although dead.
---
You know the gangs are there for the content right? And they just happen to stumble into eachother atm. But if there is no content then the gangs wont roam there.
---
Nothing stopped these gangs from fighting eachother pre-no local, they are just fking lazy.
---
Words must be hard to read I guess. 
---
&gt; **they are in fact the same mail.** 
---
So you want CCP to rework their Kill tagging system entirely, so the guys who kill don't show up until after the loss.  
---
Thats legit fucking retarded.  
---
Here is a simple solution. Delay the ability to pull from ESI/API for X amount of time.   
---
If you want to share your loss mail....drag it into Corp/Alliance chat, Screenshot and post to Imgur.  
---
What a dumb conversation.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT5D7nd58g4
---
Considering I went from throwing up to losing a marshal in 10 minutes not so hot.
---
I figure it must be so , since they no longer have sov and it was 0.0 alliance.
---
Atlas Alliance was a group headed by Bobby Atlas, and the alliance did well until Mr Atlas decided to quit EVE and then it died.
---
Yet another hiseccer who shits on the opinion of a nullseccer when it comes to NS. Its refreshing. HS is not the same as NS, start understanding that there are differences which cannot be replicated.
---
Think of it this way. Semi afk Excav mining isn't possible anymore. Your response time must be minus 6 seconds now. Even when everyone still mines in their ships, that alone would be a reduction in mining including areas under the umbrella.
---
Resubbed for the first time in over a year, the game is fun again.
---
Gr8 b8 m8 8/88
---
Ugh another wormholer with opinions. Is it a prerequisite for a wormholer to be ignorant or does it occur naturally in that setting?
---
WHs are not NS. You cannot d-scan an entire fleet of bombers, you cant even d-scan one. You have cynos in NS, you do not have that in WHs. You cant just jump in a full fleet of bombers ontop of someone with no delay or warning in WHs. So why are you forgetting these things? Or is it that you dont really know how NS works yet have opinions on the matter?
---
yeah, they could all honor brawl at the sun with supers too, or just not put down so many keepstars.
---
people in all aspects of life make their decisions based on the information they have (or think they have). more uncertainty leads to more risk being taken, simply because the risk isn't clear. delayed information leads to faster, hastier decision making, because there is less time to react.
---
it's stupid to say "oh people could have just done this before", because by virtue of being people, their behaviour is changed by their environment. change the environment and you change the behaviour.
---
Because you get something to do while you're waiting to find another fleet to engage. If ratters didn't exist, then the "default content" would likely be camping a gate instead of roaming.
---
Personally I'd rather roam around than sit in the same spot.
---
agreed but ccp needs to remove all but one avenue for intel and that is to fly there in game and look.
---
It's almost as if bombers where made to be hard to detect...
---
Right, but in wormhole space there is *zero* response fleet. *I* am the response fleet. Whatever alts I can throw together to give me a shot of getting my dreads out.
---
Also, the fleet that comes to kill your dreads is pretty much the same size as the fleet that comes to kill your super.
---
Right away. When they go Omega, you get 350 Plex, when they spend money in the Eve store, you get 2 24hr cerebral accels, and when they buy Plex you get an extractor.
---
Yup because that’s how you want to spend your time playing eve floating on top of a gate on top of a bubble and reporting any neut or red that comes trough all day and night long 🤔 yay fun 😑
---
cOdE weebs will get nothing, ever.
---
I remember doing it with windowed mode. There is a ship off-set. You can have your ship in the middle of one screen and all your chat windows and such on the other.
---
I often see Nestor/Leshak gangs for structure bashes.
---
Can't do it boss. Someone has to shit up the board.
---
Just explain this.  What is stopping anyone forming a little roaming gang finding another little roaming gang and just having good fights.  Because hey that's what used to happen... absolutely nothing... delayed information or blackouts or no local never ever stopped anyone from pvp.  The only people stopped that are the players themselves because we've moved from a pure pvp centric eve to a pve  centric eve for some reason.  Well because people are obsessed with having a zillion supers and titans.
---
If your cyno is less useful than the cyno from the baddies that tackled you, then your alliance is the problem. At which point, all anyone can say is: lul get gud.
---
It's is nice when you are able to get them to come at you piecemeal. Often times in my experience small gangs tend to back off once their prey masses up and approaches in a united front.  Kinda like how lions and wolves don't tend to take on a masses herd preferring to pick off the stragglers or the separated animals.
---
I thought he had 20
---
Dude, theres honestly no point. A lot of these people dont live in NS and they just dont get it. Its going right over their heads that content, that this event is supposed to encourage, is gonna go down. Its truly amazing to see how they are literally fking over themselves by promoting this.
---
why did you cover local
---
its not like we know its in HIX4 in period basis
---
or that the moons were in 1-N, GR-, OY0, or TPAR, etc.
---
I've been watching this sub, having last played in early 2017.  
---
seems like a change that was much needed.
---
if this change sticks i might come back
---
Exploration loot has been generally going up in value for a while. I guess maybe some people have got scared so there's more sites for those still taking them.
---
So because you are playing solo, that makes wormhole space more dangerous than a alliance in NS? Why don't we compare equal things, a solo farming in a super in nullsec is in more danger than your solo dread in wspace.
---
No. Randomness is a bullshit mechanic.
---
How about as you stay cloaked you build up interference that after a while (say, an hour) causes you to show up for combat probes with progressively easier and easier scan time as you stay cloaked longer and longer. The only way to dissipate this interference is to decloak, which dissipates the interference faster than it builds. Say, 15 mins of decloak time is sufficient to dissipate an hour's worth of interference. That way cloaky campers have to remain at their keyboards and are forced to be vulnerable after a while.
---
The hour's delay on the buildup of interference means that most ordinary cloak usage shouldn't be negatively affected, only the one specific strat of staying cloaked for 12-24 hours at a time.
---
He was so smug when he did this. I member.
---
&gt;In-game map shows recent killl counts, poddings, etc.
---
Well in that case I would live in Jita. I might be taking the example too extreme, but you get my point.
---
&gt; Evemail/try convo them? 
---
Would you want to be convoed/mailspammed by every rando that used to fly with you? I'm not talking about close friends as normally it should be easy to get in touch with them, but just about any other player you respected or have been fond of.
---
I think it's good that that information is available. But it should be more delayed than it has been.
---
No, that's a ratio not a delta. They're the 1 hour number now minus the 1 hour number from an hour ago, and that isn't available in game.
---
Lol? Are you having a stroke or something? Should I call a doctor?
---
ok, I recant everything.
---
Nope, evil thug is gone for good :(
---
That's exactly what I am thinking about this change to local. All it does is, it makes null the part of space with the worst risk/reward ratio. It offers nothing that LS or j-sapce doesn't have, but makes it significantly more dangerous that WH space, which is a travesty even CCP should realise.
---
It's not solving the real issues EVE in general and null sec in particular has, which was and is the terrible decision to turn the Rorqual into an active and in the end the ultimate solo mining ship. That accompanied by the introduction of skill extracting/ injecting is the reason for the capital/ supercatial proliferation we see today. And it's not that this is some breaking news. Everybody knows that.
---
No, my friends, I'm afraid null inhabitants will be adapting by clustering even more into a few constellations but heavily defended constellations turning even more parts of null into dead space. And it will "encourage" (if not to say force) people to get into even more Rorqs that can't be touched under super umbrellas.
---
You have a warning. It's called Dscan.
---
So why the fuck are you then talking about d-scan as a method of being safe in NS? And using the argument that low and whs use it so it shouldnt be a problem for NS. When low and whs dont have bombers in the same sense.
---
Love it!  Seriously, this is fun.
---
Well, you thought wrong.
---
Go away.
---
At Finals happen at Fanfest, right?
---
I aint givin you no content you Loch Ness Monster!
---
I just remember seeing the Merlin pilot say something to the effect of, “GET HIM BOYS” after he scrammed me and I was like, “Wait what?” *JAMMED*
---
Because as soon as a small gang entered nullsec they'd be reported in intel channels, a response fleet would form and go out with the intention of wiping them out, and the gang wouldn't be able to hunt anything. Now that it's harder to do that, there's more reason for gang to go into null, and they stay alive longer to find other gangs.
---
It's true, nobody has found a way to kill a bomber. It's literally impossible
---
Standing fleets/scouts/gatecamps 
---
Found your counter to stop them from getting in to kill them.
---
It is the combination of local and almost perfect intel from zkill which really stops stuff from happening. Just today I have seen multiple threeways that would not have happened if better intel had been available.
---
Dude if you lived in null sec back in 2006 or 2007, you would know carriers, supers, and Titans didn’t exist. There were now tier 3 ships nor tech 3 ships. We did what we had to do, and al people did was shit up comms. It was already known that people would go afk on the gate. There were no intel channels. We didn’t know what was coming into system unless we had someone on the other side in a cloaked ship waiting for potential hostile to land on the gate. There weren’t even super nice customized overviews.
---
You can scout / dscan gates and close holes, not like they spawn out of nowhere.
---
Whats the going rate for 6M isk right now?
---
\- Asking for a friend
---
Well tbh that's always been an issue the gank aspect.  But when it was 50-100 man roaming fleets that's different and a whole lotta fun when others do the same.  Sadly its let's drop fax and supers.  It's really a mindset thing..
---
There is book and kickstarter for volume II with a lot of history. Should be very interesting for you. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sciencegroen/empires-of-eve-volume-ii?lang=de
---
Yes! Let’s!
---
If you are solo in a ratting super in nullsec, you’re off your rocker for not using all available tools.
---
The average dread ratter has their mains in a PvP Corp. But that Corp cannot come save them.
---
Can you imagine what life would be like if all supers in GSF had to be in 1DQ in order to be safe? Goons like chaos, but I think that would be a little much for them, even. Plus even with old and respawn rates, there would still be incursion-like queues.
---
So they spread out, and make sure that their ratter defense can cover the places where their ratters are.
---
Wormholers choose to forgo this luxury, and instead, engage in a more ISK-dense form of krabbing, which more or less sufficiently rewards the risk involved.
---
If your alliance is not able to support your super habit, then perhaps you should use another ship to clear the sites? That’s what the rest of Eve does...
---
Who's staging did we camp and farm for hours in a 10 man fleet.. Oh yeah, imperiums. Im pretty sure jack was in a kronos while init was docked or feeding.
---
Is that higher/lower/typical compared to the average?
---
Context or random?
---
&gt;A distinction without relevance. When everybody provides their "token", it results in killmails being made public.
---
Perhaps that should also signal to you that "everyone" wants to see killmails, and so all the pointifications on 'no killmails' are driven by a minority who are trying to compensate for other shortcomings at their end.
---
What's the mining rate of non excavators on Rorquals compared to a Hulk mining?  If its similar then it seems fair that it should be the new norm, with excavators only used when effort has been put into active defence/scouting.
---
I generally prefer PvE in games.
---
Annd in addition, I'm not really into how PvP works in that game. THat you can be attacked by anyone anywhere out of the blue, even in highsec.
---
THe notion of whenever you build something, there is someone who wants to kick your sandcastle doesn't really have much appeal to me. I just want to go after my personal business in peace. It also doesn't want me to get some of the bigger and more expensive ships.
---
Well, not that I currently plan on jumping into the game tho.
---
Looks interesting . Thank you !
---
The drifters shooting structures was never good pve content, and thankfully it has been turned off now
---
It’s the “that previously wasn’t occurring” that I’m really looking for here
---
It's not a game where you can do almost anything. Eve is actually pretty limited. It's big, but limited. You can shoot rats, explore, mine, build things, or kill people and take their stuff. That's only 5 things.
---
🦀
---
Pipe entrances seem to universally have a camp on them right now, for most systems that have activity in the regions.  
---
These didn't used to be there as people simply relied on local to tell them when to run, now they're putting up groups trying to actively catch cynos/black ops cyno groups.
---
Not great big massive fleets mind you, 10-15 guys in most instances, but often less than 5 or 6 meaning small gangs and solo pilots are finding more fights with better engagement circumstances than they had previously.
---
The best part is its all shitting on the "you want easy kills", these are people looking to fight people in both instances.
---
3 nyx and a hel as well  I have seen the mails for
---
lots of little  fleets,  been told by a few guys actively hunting its about as dangerous for the hunters as you dont know if its carebear or bait.  They have been baited a few times
---
I do this in wormholes if I'm feeling frisky.
---
My brain hurts trying to imagine how fucking dense you need to be that this is considered a joke. We all thought you were trolling but it looks like you're just thick as shit. I'm surprised you remember to breath
---
Listen man, from what I gather you are a lowsec player that mostly does solo stuff in low. When you present your ideas on how to fix low I read your comments because I understand that you are in a better position to understand the issues there.
---
Now, unless you want to be that ignorant guy that sits in low doing mostly solo stuff yet commenting on how null works, you should really stop it. Because you have no clue what youre talking about. You dont understand the methods being used and therefore the counters to certain things. And how no local has utterly destroyed the one safe counter you had to bombers/dreadbombs. No amount of awareness/skill will stop you from being tackled now, and you are promoting this.
---
this is why i am proposing 48h so stuff can be 'anonyms' for a weekend
---
Turns out it indeed was other player that sent me those money, thanks a lot! 
---
Gregori Cherkov and Abrahim Natalli!
---
Less perfect information always incentiveses more risk taking. Simple as that really.
---
I don't care either way but my opinion is as follows; Killing ratters in null sec isn't any more a PVP activity than miner ganking in high sec. If you need no-local to catch ratters you're awful because it was never difficult to begin with. All the "I just re-subbed after x-amount of time" is all horseshit. If you were bored with eve last week you'll be just as bored with it this week. The idea of people excited about easier Navy Vexor hunting is funny.
---
I dish out money in the newbie chat channels from time to time, enough to replace a frigate lost in a mission or a wormhole or some money to get them on their feet. I am not going to bankroll their whole career!

Context is likely the local blackout happening in null right now. Local only shows you if you speak up, much like j-space. So, shhhhh. Keep those lips closed and your fleet might survive.
---
how does one calculate faction standings from storyline missions? I tried L2 distribution 16 times and got 0.34 (from -0.87) from apparently a l1 distribution storyline that is more like a security mission then I did L1 distribution 16 times and got something like 0.0084 but then storyline was the war preparation meeting one that requires 1,000 scordite.

AY papi

I was in KIA Alliance, was actually the first time I got into PvP. We were part of the Tortuga event, albeit a minor group in it. KIA was lead by KIA Eddz who had quite a personality, but was a good FC. We were a mercenary alliance and would go around EVE taking contracts from larger alliances who needed extra man power.
---
I was with them when they lived in Period Basis. Eventually they filled up with carebears and became more of a sov holding alliance until they ultimately died (not sure why as I had left long before this time). 
---
TLDR: Former merc alliance and was in the Tortuga campaign which was talked about in Empires of EVE.
---
Mmm I might need more screens
---
When I was new, I always wanted to be a scout. The trouble is that much of what a scout does is accomplished better by API calls. Not all of it of course, but more than I wish.
---
no suka bliati, is fake
---
I wish I could PvP like that, my experiences have all been for naught at the first gatecamp
---
Okey sure, that seems logical. But Im still fairly certain that its still regions where fights could always have been found. And since you really havent given me a location I cant know for certain.
---
So you feel that removing local all over was the cure so that people could gatecamp one system? You wanted these gatecamps? Then friend, you should visit Tama. I hear they have a gatecamp. 
---
And it really doesnt shit on any argument since if the gatecamp wasnt there you would just rampage through a region and get easy kills. And you seem to miss the other aspect of this, the other side you know. Gatecamps are fking boring. Its fun for a while, maybe a day or 2 when everybody is hyped for content and you actually see action, but it will wear off.
---
So what will be left after a while? Well, people will either stop camping or they will stick around and not go out and fight real fights because well, they have to fking gatecamp. And its always on your schedule, since you can decide not to go there. But for the people living there, its not a choice. 
---
In summary, what you are saying is, lets change things so Mr Grath can find a nice gatecamp whenever he feels like it (even tho there already are options) but fk the people who have to keep the gatecamp up and in doing so prevent them from actually fighting things unless Mr Grath feels like granting them a fight.

I noticed at a time they were holding a lot of systems in different regions. What do you think could have been the cause of it's demise ?

No intending to go back as he said.

I like it.  If they continue this way it looks like they intend to push back the ability of corps tenfold huge swaths of space easily.  There needs to be somewhere someone doesnt own everything.

I'm having enough fun with you guys on reddit already.

I agree but at the same time I want to be able to look at my kb as a reminder to how shit I am.
---
they weren't happening there, because one side or the other would simply avoid the camps, it was easier to rely on local and positional HD fleets that can bridge/jump, but if you want to be proactive now to avoid getting nuked by 90 bombers then you have these camps up.
---
You can keep trying to pretend its not happening but there sure are a lot of smaller fights happening to i guess NOT you.

&gt; Okey sure, that seems logical. But Im still fairly certain that its still regions where fights could always have been found. And since you really havent given me a location I cant know for certain.
---
Not my job to help you play EVE
---
&gt;So you feel that removing local all over was the cure so that people could gatecamp one system? You wanted these gatecamps? Then friend, you should visit Tama. I hear they have a gatecamp. 
---
Of an often absurd size thats unengagable or that fucks off long before anything that can engage it gets close, due to, and this is important, local.
---
&gt;And it really doesnt shit on any argument since if the gatecamp wasnt there you would just rampage through a region and get easy kills.
---
Actually the ratters are already adapting, and they're not any easier to catch now, sporting multiple stabs and ratting in PVP fits means they're engaging tacklers and forcing them off or just cackling as they warp away.
---
&gt;nd you seem to miss the other aspect of this, the other side you know. Gatecamps are fking boring. Its fun for a while, maybe a day or 2 when everybody is hyped for content and you actually see action, but it will wear off.
---
This is your *opinion*, there are aspects of the game that I find boring that you might enjoy, like anything PVE related, like 3 hour grind fest fleet ops, like fucking with a market, or PI, all that, its all your opinion, and honestly nobody fucking cares because for the first time in a long time in **our**  *opinion* the game is fun.
---
&gt;So what will be left after a while? Well, people will either stop camping or they will stick around and not go out and fight real fights because well, they have to fking gatecamp. And its always on your schedule, since you can decide not to go there. But for the people living there, its not a choice.

Im sorry are you trying to make people feel bad that theres a significant cost to owning an isk printing factory?

Thanks for being this fucking dumb.

fascinating, thanks. probably won't build one, but i always wondered about this

I know :) but afaik everyone wants more chances to attack crabs correct? Why not give the crabs a chance to survive?
---
Is only game, why you have to be mad?
---
Mostly Harmless was mostly formed from ex D2 with some new corps after their downfall and they lived in the north parts of drone regions at first.  I can only assume that they finally succumbed to boredom and died off. Well, that's the reason I left them at least, it was like paint drying but not as exciting :) In reality I do think they got involved in the early drone region wars and they were pushed out.   
---
Some of the ex corps are still out there and kicking, some of them seem to be doing extremely well like Fusion Enterprises  Ltd, Svea Rike, Eternity Inc etc.

Nulli Secunda had a reasonable obituary posted on EN24 [here](http://evenews24.com/2015/09/03/nulli-secunda-space-obituary) when it disbanded.
---
A few highlights include the growth of /u/CSMprogodlegend to the heady heights of "a gud fc", being part of the Delve Thunderdome of 2011, a forming member of the N3 coalition which went on to create possibly the largest rental empire seen to date (at its height it covered from Delve and Period Basis right around to the Drone Regions), and perhaps most famously being the sov-holding alliance whose unexpected loss of sov due to a missed bill triggering the battle of B-R5RB - although the system had been transfered away from the normal holding corp as part of the Halloween War defence.
---
Early to mid-life Nulli was a great time, but there was a definite decline leading up to the decision to disband in 2015.
---
Most of the things you write here are meh.
---
But if its only my opinion, then why dont everyone already gatecamp? When was the last time you did it? Why the fk should we care about YOUR opinion? You are in minority. What are you, in preschool? And here you highlight the issue, you want the majority to bend to your will. To adapt to your wants and wishes. When in reality, its the other side that pays the bills and you guys get a tantrum every couple of months and stop subscribing.
---
Fk that dude.
---
So, what are the criteria for a killmail to be considered "meaningful"?
---
How is your reply any more meaningful than the OP?
---
except people are still mining and ratting in supers and carriers.....
---
Any mission will state what that prize is for completing the mission. It may well have put you over the 6 million ISK mark \[I so wish that still was money that awed and inspire me :-)\].
---
You could have been gifted money from someone. I would hope any player donation would be more than that but, when I came in, I got 180.000 ISK for helping someone mine :-) \[11 years+ ago now\].

You can try it for free, you know that?

Bang on..And that's the fucking problem.. not local not Intel just as you said

---
I was there. Not even a F was dropped in local
---
I recall them in Period Basis, and Geminate. When I was out of alliance I used to roam their space and kill them in Geminate. I reckon they recruited too many PvE players and lost many of their hardcore PvPers. Also I vaguely remember KIAEddz the FC/leader going AFK from game, so that most likely was the primary issue.
---
Sorry, hardcore player lol, I'd have that much hp in act8

It’s amazing. I’ve been watching supers log in for 15min and just log out. Krabs hate this.
---
&gt; anywhere out of the blue, even in highsec
---
This form of pvp is different than the others. These are called highsex gankers and they represent a very small portion of the pvp in the game. Like 90% of their kills are super blingy ships on the major highways. Avoid flying super bling on highway and you'll likely never get ganked. If you have to for some reason, then scout it out and haul the super bling and a very tanky ship. These are the guidelines I follow and I've never been ganked in highsec in my 10+ years of eve.
---
Most Pve "lifers" don't have a sandcastle to kick down, so these guys do exactly what you are after.
---
How do you gatecamp or scout a covert cyno?
---
Ur mom
---
" When I was out of alliance I used to roam their space and kill them in Geminate.  " LOL
---
Seems like a lot of the major groups just collapse once their leader / main FC quits . In a way it's kinda ... stupid.
---
Polio!
---
The idea is simple. Keep ur isk liquid and move about knowing that anything u undock is going to die eventually so joke and mess around and try to kill as much with it b4 it dies and don’t anchor larger than u r willing to lose. Most ppl don’t care about stuff smaller than forts or azbels.

\+1 ...best thing you could ever do for the game..... followed by keeping null dark.

---
I piss 6m
---
But it definitely shouldn't be limited. Don't listen to these dorks that don't even provide content -- they just want the bigger groups to kill each other more often.
---
Delaying killmail information would be \*\*ridiculous\*\*. That's part of the game, and it should be.
---
You make it seem like everyone says "Oh look a Stiletto died in that system...guess I won't go", when in reality it's more like "hey there's a roaming gang over in Oij...we should suit up and kill them". Zkill provides just as much, or more, content as it prevents.

Love it

KIA are a group that played in beta and added their elite gamer tag Killed In Action to their names - some of the best early PvPers.  They were part of Curse Alliance (alliance mechanics didn't exist in game at the time) who were widely regarded as The Best.  They became the military wing of an industrial group (and had a short-lived merger where they became RONA-KIA) known as The Phoenix Alliance which went on to become the Northern Coalition.  They kinda dropped a bit after this, but had a brief resurgence and joined MC to create Tortuga (a freeport led by mercenary alliances)
---
Mostly Harmless - Part of the Northern Coalition (not the alliance with the same name that exists now, but a group of alliances that dominated the early part of EVEs history).  Their POS passwords, and trademark local call, was o0k.  The alliance basically died when the DRF invaded the Northern forces, and the rest of the North kinda merged into the CFC (or moved to Delve to quietly die).  One of their main FCs is still semi-active and the leader of Sniggwaffe.
---
Solar Feet - led by MACTEP, arguably one of the best FCs the game has ever seen (easily top 3), SOLAR were the military wing of the DRF and before that just Baddass Russians Who You Were Scared Of Because They Were Badass™.  They had great success while allied with Legion of xDeathx, who were more industrial focused.  Together they toppled the the Northern Coalition, a group deemed too dominant and too big to fall.  They have hilarious interactions with other Russian groups, always good for drama.
---
Against ALL Authority, otherwise known as -A-, were widely regarded to be the best PvP force in EVE and lived in the South.  Whenever people invaded them, they'd retreat to Stain (shoutout to LGK), wait for the invaders to leave, and come back stronger than ever.  They played a major role politically in the game during Delve I &amp; II, and were so dominant that the remained #1 on the killboards long after their alliance folded.  Hilariously, they tied to an unlikely pairing of allies TEST Alliance and Pandemic Legion (and others, of course, forming the HBC - Honey Badger Coalition).
---
Tribal Band - Uhhh...they lived in Period Basis and were part of the aforementioned HBC.  Didn't really do anything noteworthy, at least in comparison to the other alliances.
---
Raiden - After BoB/Kenzoku finally died, a few member corps went on to form Raiden.  Along with White Noise, SOLAR, XIX they formed the military backbone of the DRF and had (at the time) the largest supercap fleet the game had ever seen.  After conquering the North, they took space and kinda fell apart.  Killing the Northern Coalition was what a lot of those dudes lived for.  Finfleet is probably the most notable one that's still around, they're in NC.
---
Atlas Alliance - another Old Guarde group run by one of EVE's most notorious early names: Bobby Atlas.  Allied with BoB, they lived on the South/West of the map and were super dominant in their day.  Kinda died out when Bobby Atlas eventually left the game.  Their legacy kinda lives on in Elo Knight, who was in Atlas for a bit.
---
Nulli  Secunda - Lived in the South, allies with -A- and the Southern Coalition and then after that died, became part of N3 and allied with Northern Coalition. and Pandemic Legion(ish).  Some pretty huge names were in Nulli, including Killah Bee and Progodlegend.  They kinda sorta died, but most of their members live on in other groups.  Some are in NCdot, some in lowsec, and another big group are (hilariously) in the alliance that killed them - TEST.
---
Bro, it was a shit joke. Just take the loss and move on. No reason to cry about it.
---
lol yeah I basically learned some the basic of PvP from them, then outgrew the alliance and had better things to do with my time than listen to some dictator FC/leader tell me how to play.
---
&gt; Seems like a lot of the major groups just collapse once their leader / main FC quits . In a way it's kinda ... stupid.
---
It seems stupid, but EVE has always been that way. Personalities that kind of are the soul of a group and without that person the group goes their own separate ways. In unfortunately know that from experience with my own group :P
---
lol, no I'm AGREEING with you 😋
---
I think there should be some form of payment/balance and looked that idea above that I mentioned
---
Yeah but fuck whs

Well, I'm happy to know that some of them are still playing the game and doing good :)

It seems most folks like Blackout. The ones that hate it all seem to be goonies.

No that is rly not what is going to happen. The Drifters were an annoyance not a threat (Unless you are a Spodbrain taking gates in an untanked Hel). Although they were good at annoying gotta give them that. 
---
Blackout is fun and good but those Drifter attacks were a faliure.
---
Were you one of the bombers that failed big time?
---
Still Fofalus point of risk/reward ratio remains. The 8 bill dread example you choose to outline is making significantly mor ISK/ hour than a 20 bill super carrier in null.
---
But we could ofc take a more common example. A moderately blinged T3 cruiser generates more ISK/ hour farming a C3 than a carrier or subcap in null. And that while being more safe.

I thought everyone had spies in goons?

There is a difference between a reduction in mining and a reduction in mined ore.  Sure we are using Miner IIs now and as a result the amount of ore mined is reduced, people will adapt and life in Eve will go on, just a little slower.

You won't make anywhere *near* the same ISK super ratting Vs hitting c3-4 sites.

Not to mention super ratting comes with infinite anomalies versus constantly rolling new chains, and if you're super ratting, you have a supercap safety umbrella ready to save you at any moment.
---
Wh ratting, your safety net is your fit.
---
how the fuck do you get down voted so badly for asking simple shit??!?!?
---
POSes are now useless, everything they did is moved to citadels. The new jump bridges do not give fatigue, so moving around in subcaps is a lot easier. Combat interceptors are no longer interdiction nullified. Non capital ships can receive reps while entosising (making fozzie sov a lot less cancer). Rorquals are nerfed. Super and carrier application is nerfed, along with Titan HAW dps. The hisec plex market is now controlled by a cartel of goons, Panfam, and test. The Mangos moved from the Chinese server to tranquility, blued Test, and haven’t done too much big stuff yet. Goons are still the most powerful alliance, and test is their pet again.

I’m sure there’s a lot more, but that is some of the big stuff

Us fucking with PLEX is deliberately and specifically declaring war on CCP itself. We aren't going that far.
---
I've considered canceling my sub and moving to a different game where I can do industrial stuff and not be considered the bad guy
---
I think TEST swept the last of their sov when we moved south. I remember skirmishing with them when we fought Stainwagon and Red Alliance, but by then they were a shadow of their former selves.
---
This is exactly what I tried to get across when they decided to come out with ESI. The amount of info needs to be dialed back a bit.

/u/CCP_Falcon yet another one of these threads, still nothing beyond "We're looking into it". Come. On. I want a Onyx model for my desk.
---
So 10% of 100% is now a majority?
---
Also you're talking ON this sub reddit, and when you say "We" and use the term "Majority" you're usually talking about the people around you when you do it, aka, the subreddit you're posting on.
---
So what on earth would make you think you're somehow in the majority?  Majority of people are still playing, and are posting about how much fun they're having, then theres you.

"I feel like there is"

Yes.

you should have seen the bitching about having to use projectile abbadons when the ping was for ....projectile abaddons

You kill the ship withi t before it gets into your space. Or you see it come through a gate with a scout.

Ok industry war fc querns
---
This issue though, when related to Intel systems like NEAR. 
---
Let's just say every goon was required to give ESI for every character to their auth. That auth required access to killmails, and output to NEAR. 
---
Doesnt this defeat the point of delaying local since ESI is live now?

AHAHAHAHHAHAHHA being puerto rican i feel this so much, its in the blood we cant help it!

great, then use that in-game map skill for reading context, it's useful.

The OP is a serial karma whore who was literally responsible for the subreddit rule of "killmails must have context". So now he just guesses. Meaningful would be a killmail with an actual AAR.

You didnt see anything !

Let them try.

You must be surely joking if you imply j-space is more dangerous than current null sec? Tell me you do pls. If you are semicompetent and familiar with wh mechanics, general risk assessment etc. j-space is a relatively safe place with high rewards. I mean, seriously what the hell are we talking about?
---
Yes no one has supers in WH, but they also have no cynos and no static gates, things that make it extremely easy for a hostile group to come attack you.
---
Buddy you can move your obvious trollposts down by that one goon's comment about having to use T2 mining drones now.

Yeaaahno. That's not how that works. And even if by some upside down land rule it was, you still have those three dozen titans to jump to your rescue before half the guys attacking even get a lock.

I love Eve.  It's a beautiful game. It's an interesting game. I love the idea that everything in-game is created by the players- modules, weapons, ammo, ships and structures. But it's a *very* frustrating game, especially for the casual player. Not everyone has multiple huge monitors, and can spread everything out.  Not everyone is an expert at playing the game. Sometimes some people like to look at the scenery for a few seconds without getting attacked. Or sometimes we have real-life events to deal with, and can't hit Dcan for a minute or two.
---
Go ahead, call me a carebear or whatever the latest term is.  But I think having at least a *little* warning (without having to span Dscan *literally* every 5 seconds) would solve about 80% of the issue I have with the game.  And cracking down on Bots would take care of most of the rest. (In a FPS, people decry aim-bots, because they take the risk and skill completely out of the game. And Bots that auto-mine all the asteroids in a system are similar, in my opinion.)
---
Grr Goons
---
Lol, you talking about trolling. Now that is rich. How about some, you know, actual points points about risk/reward of HS vs LS vs NS vs WH?
---
If you want the change to be permanent resub now, stop the, "if they make it permanent ill resub" thats cheap and easy to say, you vote with your wallet, if you dont pay only the carebears will stay and complain making CCP remove the change. VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET
---
Lol Tara is back. Whelp, it was fun while it lasted
---
thats horde
---
Riiiiight
---
Yeh and vanilla wow was awesome too
---
Not when you’re new, dbag
---
overblown . all the fuss is less that it was before.
---
This sounds almost like code
---
Thank Bob I bought futures in Bombers before this patch
---
Not in test
---
i heard he is actually only a an assistant industry war fc
---
Fuck I love this game
---
At the very least it will bring back actual mining defense fleets
---
A lot of people know me as multiboxing the "BBTBs" -  this is what I use, and highly suggest it!
---
Which is demonstrably not true lmao.
---
So after we had established that lack of free intel makes for a better game, we are unsure if it makes for a better game? That is the logic of a crab! You just want safety.
---
Uhm they nerfed the havens , so in most system 2 or 3 supers and you run dry on havens also just because there is a super umbrella doesn’t guarantee safety lol a good efficient blob fleet will get a goon or test or nc or pn alliance super even before the blackout, all major alliances where loosing supers and rorq s , a get gud blob fleet has a good chance of getting a kill even before blackout!
---
Again, I don't know about your first hand null and WH experience, but is not my exclusive point of view that you make more ISK in WH space than in null. Which is totally fine. It just becomes a bit unbalanced if CCP decides to massively nerf null, while leaving the rest of New Eden untouched in terms of risk &amp; reward. Don't you think?
---
But CODE. always wins.
---
Always.
---
I mean for starters, looking at WH you get:
---
No asset safety. Ever.
---
No local. Ever.
---
No sov. Ever. 
---
No infinite/upgraded anoms. Ever. 
---
No fixed gates to watch. Ever.
---
No cynos. Ever. 
---
No supers. Ever.
---
No free isk instantly dropped into your wallet. Ever. 
---
Dread escalations make less ISK than super ratting without any backup should your ship get attacked.
---
You can't just stick to the same system to mine, rat, or do really anything. Ever.
---
No T2 moon goo for some reason.
---
No medical clones for *when*, not *if*, you get podded. Ever. 
---
No fatigue-free jump bridges. Or any jump bridges. Ever. 
---
No fixed map. Ever.
---
Destroying your citadel and stealing everything in it can be done in as little as 3 days. 
---
WH space has maintained itself in the public eye as *the* place to hunt for shiny kills and is responsible for a *massively* disproportionate amount of ISK destroyed by population alone, before you even consider the fact that it has very few caps and zero supers (ever). Check Exookiz' Game of Holes presentation from Eve North for more on that. 
---
You died trying to defend a citadel? Hope you have a scanning alt in system you can find a new route in with before getting killed or rolled out, locking you out of your home system. 
---
No freighters full of equipment to resupply with for everything below C5 space. 
---
Did I mention no cynos? Gonna mention that again. Ever. 
---
No ESS, ever. 
---
No automated intel channels and pings, ever. 
---
Dotlan gatecamp and NPC death info? Yeah, nope. 
---
Seriously, buddy. Null even *with* the blackout is practically hisec for people with a superiority complex.
---
Imagine how good fleet fights in eve would be without 8 days of preparation!
---
remember eve skunk?
---
you can also edit where their positions are located on screen in the jfile
---
plus one tech
---
yet.
---
How do you enable that?
---
KIA is still very much alive and is recruiting players and corps. Contact Ironwolf, redrainofdeath, Miscondukt, and Login Issue for the details.
---
nobody knows because \*somebody\* fucking turned off the killboard everyone uses
---
I think it's going to be promising
---
Is it? I'm not going to quote any numbers, but my corp mates who only do combat explo didn't log in at all today. Whether you like it or not, some players are 1 step away from bots in the way they play the game. I insta-warped my bling vindi to a POS as soon as a red popped into the system, back in 2012.
---
But please, do demonstrate how this is not true, since you think it is demonstrable.
---
damn the intro was dope
---
relevant ~~xkcd~~ [vgcats](https://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=2)
---
Assistant to the regional manager
---
So the only people that exist in nullsec live under the super umbrellas? 
---
I said compare apples to apples and if its a solo player ratting then compare it to a solo player pveing in nullsec.
---
Otherwise we are just encouraging everyone to live under the super umbrellas which is also bad.
---
Nah none sense a good efficient blob killed supers and rorq s from all major alliances even before blackout, don’t know where people get the idea of a super umbrella guaranties your safety .
---
What none sense crap your spouting.
---
There is always a chance to loose your ship.
---
All I’m saying is now the chances are of loosing your super or rorq s is higher then loosing your t3 in k space. Because of the blackout in null + Cyno possibilities.
---
You get gud bud 😝 lol
---
Fact
---
I used to play two monitors with one client. I'm much happier with one.
---
Am not developer I just love this app and am using it since they first release it.
---
You dont know what the majority of those 90% are doing tho.... All you can see is that there is a large player drop.
---
But are you seriously suggesting that "krabs" as u like to call them arent the majority? Come on dude. Those who like this change is mainly pure PvP players, and theres not enough of you around to be anything but a minority.
---
Imagine being this stupid.
---
On paper? Perhaps. But the desparity between nullsec and everywhere else is so great that even removing local like they are for this month (and we all know they'll be adding it right back in with observatories anyway) doesn't even come *close* to levelling the field, let alone putting NS below the rest. 
---
It's like if you have some dude working an OK and fairly stable but really not very lucrative job for the local government representing hisec, some freelance contractor who can make a good bit of cash but isn't always secure in his employment as lowsec, professional gamblers as WH, and Qatari oil barons as Null. 
---
Can all of them live comfortably? Yeah, it's possible. Can the professional gamblers make a killing? Totally. But they also risk *waaaaaay* more, and no matter what they do, they'll *never* beat those oil barons. 
---
This null blackout is the equivilant of fining Abdul Al-Bishar or whoever a few million dollars. Literally pocket change and not a hassle even worth mentioning. 
---
The field is so insanely stacked in their favour that it would take years of strikes with the nerfbat to even approach balance.
---
It will probably be up from weekend before due to drifters. I think you need to look at the average kills across weekends to compare.
---
&gt;Tribal Band - Uhhh...they lived in Period Basis and were part of the aforementioned HBC. Didn't really do anything noteworthy, at least in comparison to the other alliances.
---
They were the catalyst for TEST getting kicked out of Fountain and nearly dying themselves. Does that not count?
---
Solo ratting in WH will *never* even pay close to what null can accomplish for a while host of reasons. You can't bubble gates to get you extra time when a new entrance might appear at any moment, and in years of doing both, I can tell you that while it's much more *fun* (read: difficult and dangerous) to do WH Pve, you get *way* more money for *way* less investment in null. 
---
Null is just too damn easy and too damn safe for something that literally means "zero security space". For literally the first time, it's seeing some reflection of that status, and I just can't shed any tears for the folks who now think that they have it harder than anyone else.
---
and that has nothing to do with a certain breed of T2 ships having gone through the roof recently?
---
Lol, so whats the risk vs reward for being on that bombing fleet my dude?
---
I'm sure Montolio and TEST being TEST were more of a catalyst, but sure
---
Most retarded shit CCP has ever come out with.
---
No problem! EVE's history is super entertaining
---
&gt;2 or 3 supers and you run dry
---
How you can still think this is somehow more difficult than anywhere else is beyond me. The fact that it can support *one* is nuts.
---
My advice is to go to a system named Jita and invest it in someone that advertises in doubling your isk. These few people are market geniuses. I have no idea how they do it but it only takes a few minutes to complete. 
---
Think of it as an investment in a community credit union. Invest a little bit at first. Recoup your investment and then only reinvest your profits.
---
Smartbombs on a gate, hit by a boson, picked off on your way there, losing your blops bridge or in cyno, the fact that bombers have all the tank of a wet napkin, and that you have to still get a good few people together and pull off the run properly to do it. 
---
And that's *with* the blackout.
---
Before? Fat chance even getting close to a rorqual when the second anyone breathes in the direction of their region the whole local intel network lights up.
---
You say that yet all the usual "less than 2 weeks old rorq bot" spam us still very real. Every collosal anom is exactly same, 4-8 rorqs, a vni and a skiff.
---
You must not be flying in a 20 bn well fitted super lol the best a super can do is 120 mil per tick but since haven nerfs and nsa nerfs most are lucky to hit 100mil per tick anymore , so it takes 200 hours of straight none stop ratting havens that supposedly spawn quick enough for you to break even.
---
 You can tell right away who is full of crap and has no idea about null living.
---
Looooooooooool. Dude, just stop right there. I fking knew you were gonna give bs answer.
---
The goons really just don't die, do they?
---
nah, i was only gonna come back the last week(s) before they shut it down to blow up all my stuff.
---
if it's just temporary i see no reason to reinstall the game and set up everything again just to return back to business as usual
---
"Oh no I can only freely print 100m an hour in my supercarrier that's immune to anything short of a blob and has my instant backup button to handle those. Also I never even have to leave this system."
---
might I introduce you to WH space?
---
Hey, whatever helps your victim complex sleep at night.
---
L O V E!!!
---
I've been dumping the system kills ESI endpoint periodically and just eyeballing it (I regret not writing a little something into this to stuff each pull into a table, rip) on a sum-by-region basis (null only).  No baseline to compare against, though.  
---
Here's what it looks like right now:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS7st-0nmk1KO_pjtKwIVihZz8RzLuoLF2WQlx8oxAjv-xw8RjntW627PBpH9DQQ6iNPI8QPAI5VmY3/pubhtml
---
Omist is missing from this particular hour, presumably because absolutely nothing has been killed there in the last period?
---
&gt;led by MACTEP, arguably one of the best FCs the game has ever seen (easily top 3
---
wow I am very ashamed of not knowing more about this dude, when hes this well spoken about. Out of curiosity who would be your top 5 right off the top of your head?
---
A lot of people have been asking for active and passive intelligence structures and modules for some time.  They of course need to be usable in “denied” territory as well as being potentially unreliable (maybe through ewar). Making intelligence harder to acquire is probably the #1 thing to improving the game, but it shouldn’t be super tedious. #2 is more/continued focus on asymmetric warfare tools.
---
Been there, done that.
---
WHs + no local in null, now that's interesting
---
You are looking at this from the wrong perspective.
---
The problem with cloaky campers was that you knew you could get dropped on in spite of the high probability you would actually be ok.
---
Now, you know the very same thing, whether you can see any one in local or not.
---
Ergo curent state of null is identical to the pre-Blackout-cloaky-camper state.  Either way, there's a risk of getting ganked that can only be reasonable mitigated with fleet on standby.  Minus a standby fleet, the only reasonable behavior is to dock up. I have to believe that all the bitter vets promising to resub will make undocking even less popular and consequently drive the prey to hunter ratio so low that the bitter vets will unsubscribe too.  So Ccp lose pve players and "elite" hunters that needed this boost.  But I expect it will help Waffles in Provi, so it has that going for it.  At least you won't have to pay cloaky campers - that's a dead profession now.
---
It's just moronic as a business choice.  But I don't have Pearl Abyss stock, and I have other hobbies.
---
What in the fuck even is this fit?
---
Thank you for the all fun.
---
Im not the victim here so it doesnt matter. But someone being this glaringly ignorant actually hurts my brain.
---
It takes a while to correctly sync all that data, and the server this is running on is smaller than the original so it'll likely struggle to keep up I assume
---
The tools are available out of game to everybody.
---
Hi there! Send me a mail in game and I can help you out
---
on the matter of NC v DRF, the russian civil war and the delve thingy in 2011 this is by far the best writeup on it, at least that I could find, and its pretty weird I never see people linking it: https://www.gamertribute.com/eve-online-war-stories/
---
note that the page I linked is only a summary, at the start of every section click on the name of the section and you'll get a far more detailed writeup on it, for example click on "Northern Coalition vs Drone Russian Federation War (2010-2011)"  to get to to the meat of it.
---
My opinion would be then that you should not be doing activities that require you to be D-Scanning 24/7, not that we need to change the D-scan mechanics. Casuals have a ton to do in the game that doesn't require them to smash D-scan.
---
Welp, this is frustrating as hell since so many fitting links are to zkb  :|
---
old
---
If I did not have real life to screw up my weekend, i would have been logged in all weekend....
---
good riddance, zkillboard was getting too needy. First it was Ad blockers are ok. Then it was, please disable ad blockers. Screw that crap, don't need it.
---
I wish there was a way to play on a 1440p monitor AND a 1080p monitor.  Proper full dual monitor support.  I want a Dscan, F9/local space, and sig scan window on my monitor.
---
All that without having to stretch the client.
---
No they aren't.
---
Exactly:
---
asset safety - you got a point
---
no local true but also no gates - so people have to actively probe their way to you -&gt; that will be noticed if you're not afk
---
no sov - irrelevant, you can be evicted from NS and j-space
---
no infinite anoms - just role the farming hole and farm the next one or the one after that etc.
---
no gates - exactly, no one can slip unnoticed when you happen to be ouside of the gates dscan range
---
no supers ever - true, so what's the point?
---
No free isk instantly dropped into your wallet. Ever. - true , you have to MTU the blue loot and travel ceptor it to the closest HS station with buy orders - seriously?
---
Dread escalations make less ISK than super ratting without any backup should your ship get attacked. - A dread farming in high end WH space does less than 300 mill/ hour?
---
You can't just stick to the same system to mine, rat, or do really anything. Ever. - true, everything requires more preparation, I agree with that (btw the reason I left WH space)
---
No T2 moon goo for some reason. - OK
---
No medical clones for when, not if, you get podded. Ever. - OK, I agree
---
No fatigue-free jump bridges. Or any jump bridges. Ever. - Well, if you're in j-space you don't need that
---
No fixed map. Ever. - Yeah, that's the nature of unknown space, neither a pro nor a con
---
Destroying your citadel and stealing everything in it can be done in as little as 3 days. - True, citadel mechanics are one of the issues in EVE, I agree with that.
---
WH space has maintained itself in the public eye as the place to hunt for shiny kills and is responsible for a massively disproportionate amount of ISK destroyed by population alone, before you even consider the fact that it has very few caps and zero supers (ever). Check Exookiz' Game of Holes presentation from Eve North for more on that. - OK
---
You died trying to defend a citadel? Hope you have a scanning alt in system you can find a new route in with before getting killed or rolled out, locking you out of your home system. - I know, learned the logged off alt issue myself the hard way.
---
No freighters full of equipment to resupply with for everything below C5 space. - I know logistics are limited, I agree, but since you don't have to support super capital shit, your need for resources is not comparable to null.
---
Did I mention no cynos? Gonna mention that again. Ever. - Exactly, no 100 man bomber fleet insta shredding anything that's not a Rorq/ Titan/ maybe super
---
No ESS, ever. - Who does that anyways - no need for that.
---
No automated intel channels and pings, ever. - What's the need for that in j-space. You have scouts in the chain?
---
Dotlan gatecamp and NPC death info? Yeah, nope. - No gates = no gate camps, that's obvious
---
Seriously, buddy. Null even with the blackout is practically hisec for people with a superiority complex. - I don't know, for whatever reason people mistake the super duper umbrella Goons may provide with NULL SEC. I mean there's a reason why people already cluster up their PVE activities into certain pockets. Null is very heterogenous. There are so many soloists and small gangs killing stuff in null left and right even before changes to local. No idea how this was possible with the flawless intel everyone had and the insta response super drops.
---
Would be cool though, yes?
---
te salió wena culiao
---
Marco!
---
Bad idea posting this. Way too much info. Derp...
---
No it shouldn't have a delay lol, markets are only fair if everyone has the same info.
---
All you'd do with a delay on orders is force people to create more alts to sit on different stations of they want to ship things around. And thats ignoring how unfeasible to implement it would be anyways
---
Cheers ! &lt;3
---
give him some flowers and a box of chocolates
---
Ganks will be down. Small gang pvp will be up.
---
They're not going to grow horns. Most are just going to stop playing. Forcing people into a play style has never worked, especially when you have to pay a subscription to play.  I'm not saying this is a bad change but all this chest beating about krabs being forced to PVP is kinda funny because they're not going to do that.
---
This o'clock

IT alliance ----&gt; BoB 2.0
---
Skill urself, rip
---
This is false as I'm part of the standing fleet and he didn't call for help.
---
I don’t understand what some of you want from people with supers just buy a 20 bn well fitted super just to feed it to your hunting desires ? Lol why would I just give you isk ?
---
I mean if you don’t want me to use it then why implement it in a game the same goes for rorq s .
---
Good video. 
---
But from what I recall we only had more subcaps and caps (in the form of a cache, total wise on field was probably the same). 
---
Supers wise pl tri china had more, so meh I guess
---
My spirit animal
---
You can print 100mil a hour in a regular carrier lol 😂
---
Peak Nulli was the "See you in 319 station! Wooo hooo!" recruiting video back during the summer of Delve in 2012.  A pity the video has gone missing.  I was a bit of EVE Online history.
---
I checked. Definitely not. All blue FCs are laughing at the fit.
---
Sneak an alt into a major coalition, play that actively for a month. You will find out if the grass is greener, if it is not; you got a spy toon to play around with!
---
Well when you see 50 dudes who aren't you in local....why take a fight?
---
Ah, for once you're right. My brain refused to acknowledge just how stupidly, fuckoff broken super ratting is. 
---
I am so, *so* terribly sorry that printing *400*m an hour in absolute safety is just not good enough for you. 
---
Do you come pre-buttered or does the seafood restaurants have to do that themselves?
---
Good post.
---
You understand that "null" means "zero" right?
---
As an idiot krab that never looked at local anyway (until after I got tackled that is) this makes literally no difference to me.
---
Lol no one makes 400 mil in a super per hour 😂
---
~90m Venezuelan bolivares
---
The megalliances will just take over the nullsec systems in jump range of highsec.
---
When CCP eventually ruins this by adding observatories, I might have to leave NJED to start my own WH corp, dedicated to destroying every last observatory in the game. 
---
You want my card?
---
Sigh you just keep proving my point people that has no idea of null living wants to dictate what’s right for null 😝
---
But nullsec megaalliances will just move to doing even more shit locally in nullsec. It'll just be the death of jita rather than encouraging lowsec.
---
Are you just making shit up here or what?
---
&gt; No asset safety. Ever.
---
Fair that is something that makes it harder in wormholes
---
&gt;No local. Ever.
---
You are literally in a thread talking about no local in null so this doesn't count
---
&gt;No sov. Ever.
---
And how is that something that makes nullsec safer? Sov provides no tactical advantage
---
&gt;No infinite/upgraded anoms. Ever.
---
This is about safety not isk making.
---
&gt;No fixed gates to watch. Ever.
---
Correct and no fixed gates makes wormhole space safer, so we are 1-1 NSvsWspace
---
&gt;No cynos. Ever.
---
Correct no cynos, especially no covert cynos, things that make nullsec more dangerous
---
&gt;No supers. Ever.
---
Same as the above, these things make nullsec more dangerous
---
&gt;No free isk instantly dropped into your wallet. Ever.
---
What do you even mean by this?
---
&gt;Dread escalations make less ISK than super ratting without any backup should your ship get attacked.
---
&gt;You can't just stick to the same system to mine, rat, or do really anything. Ever.
---
Not about nullsec safety which is what we are discussing.
---
&gt;No T2 moon goo for some reason.
---
&gt;No medical clones for when, not if, you get podded. Ever.
---
This is a fair point.
---
&gt;No fatigue-free jump bridges. Or any jump bridges. Ever.
---
Only if you own the space, and for normal bridges you are trading the ability of space you own for hostile titan bridges and hostile covert bridges, so again theres a trade off
---
&gt;No fixed map. Ever.
---
That can be both safety and detriment.
---
&gt;Destroying your citadel and stealing everything in it can be done in as little as 3 days.
---
&gt;WH space has maintained itself in the public eye as the place to hunt for shiny kills and is responsible for a massively disproportionate amount of ISK destroyed by population alone, before you even consider the fact that it has very few caps and zero supers (ever). Check Exookiz' Game of Holes presentation from Eve North for more on that.
---
Haha are you kidding me? Do you know how many supers and titans have died in nullsec?
---
You died trying to defend a citadel? Hope you have a scanning alt in system you can find a new route in with before getting killed or rolled out, locking you out of your home system.
---
&gt;No freighters full of equipment to resupply with for everything below C5 space.
---
Again this is something hostiles can use as well in nullsec.
---
&gt;Did I mention no cynos? Gonna mention that again. Ever.
---
Yes you mentioned cynos thinking those are only used for safety instead of attacking so you still don't understand
---
&gt;No ESS, ever.
---
And? An ESS is a risk.
---
&gt;No automated intel channels and pings, ever.
---
Nullsec has the same automated that wormhole space has of citadel attack notifications. And since this is about no local there is no intel channels there.
---
&gt;Dotlan gatecamp and NPC death info? Yeah, nope.
---
Ya and thats a bonus feature for WH
---
&gt;Seriously, buddy. Null even with the blackout is practically hisec for people with a superiority complex.
---
Not even close but you can believe what you want.
---
It's 3-4 jumps out in any directions?
---
Yea but its more fun this way.
---
We will see I bet they revert this soon
---
I, for one, have been enjoying the new local mechanics. It's made a lot of content a lot more interesting and has added some much needed excitement to even the most mundane activities (i.e. ratting). I'm also on board with the idea that corps/alliances having a way to counter the disturbance but share the concern of many as to how it could be balanced. I'm in a pretty large alliance that wouldn't have any issues with building observatories or whatever was invented to counter it. While that works out great for me personally, I think it would defeat the idea of the blackout and what I perceive as the intent to shake things up and level the playing field just a bit more. ISK/Fuel is easy to come by for these large alliances. I suppose it could be tied to the ADM of the system sort of like jump bridges and other amenities of that nature but then it's just down to a grind that could be easily overcome. Either way I'm interested to see how this develops.
---
No change
---
One of the best examples of the devastating propaganda war mentioned above: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4VtiSdpAqI
---
When I first heard about the black out as a long term player I was thrilled (2006). I felt that down of the wonder, fear, exhilaration that I experienced as a newer player was returning to Eve online.
---
Having read some people’s posts regarding mining and industry, I was somewhat swayed to feel their pain. As a WH player I know that fatigue that comes from constantly mashing my d-scan, I couldn’t imagine doing it for a 2 hour long mining op or whatever.
---
So now I’m undecided but leaning toward loving the blackout. That being said, regardless of if you love it or hate it, you must admit that the fact that it is in effect has re-energized the player base. Everyone is talking. Making plans. Reacting. 
---
Love it! Thank you CCP for being brave enough to implement the black out! A big salute to the players that are HTFU and finding ways around the problem, adapting instead of wimping out.
---
When I was living in WH space I was farming C3s in a Tengu that cost less than 1 bill. Iirc I made about 4 sites per hour which was 160 million in blue loot. You can't do that in a carrier or any subcap of that matter in null. Yes, I agree, you have to factor in ofc all the preparations you have in WH space (rolling, scouting, probing, rerolling etc.). But in null you have the problem of competition with fellow ratters in usually overcrowded PVE pockets. So, you have to factor that in as well. And again, if you have some average level of WH experience and a average competency for risk taking, j-space is relatively safe - even if you're doing stuff on your own. If you're in a group it get's really safe.
---
Just to add, null needs changes (EVE in general does), that is for sure - it was a bit too safe, yes. I don't have a balanced solution myself.
---
Zkill is open source....
---
Zkill link or it never happened
---
Wormholes can appear in nullsec just like wspace so I don't know how you can only count that against null? Cynos, static gates, supers, these are all things wormholes don't have to deal with and make null more dangerous than wspace, not safer.
---
Haha so slyce ran out of people to blue in the north and decided to look east.
---
KIA - Nobodies.
---
Mostly Harmless = Name says it all
---
Solar Fleet- Spin off of old Russian group Red Alliance who fractured apart following the Great War.
---
AAA- Used to be scary Russians, also a splinter of Red Alliance, but they became less and less relevant over time.
---
Tribal Band- Cum sluts for whomever would let them hang off their dick.
---
Raiden - NC., one of Post BOB BOB groups.
---
Atlas- Semi solid group who took advantage of the gulf left in the East when RedSwarm Federation (Red Alliance, Goons, Tau Ceti) evicted BoB from Delve, moved in, and Red Alliance fractured.
---
Nulli. - Nobodies who got some space in Delve in the DFR War, later a FW group, later later, latched on to NC. dick in the DotBros War (Tech War) between CFC, NC./BL. . Then were the ones respoinsible for not paying bills giving us all B-R Titan Slaughter.
---
If you go to high sec you do not have to pvp at all, ever. No Cita + war dec changes made it possible to pve in peace. 
---
Now, if you wanna make big bucks out in dangerous space well, yeah you are now at a little bit more risk. There will still be people mining in rorqs etc and making enough isk to replace if necessary. There is safe pve, its just not gonna be everywhere like it has been.
---
Agree with this. I've had some good small gang stuff, and very few krab ganks.
---
except you would just have all of WH space quit the game rather than return to null big bloc garbage game play. The very opposite of what you want.
---
Good job.
---
I think you missed a news cycle bud. We aren't blue to [any AI residents up north](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmncxn/slyce_kicked_from_gotg_to_protect_chinese_renting/).
---
These numbers look like extremely low kill count..  is this for a 24h period?
---
`ha ha ha` he is totally not a bot, this is absolutely, 100% normal `human` behavior to `INSERT ACTIVITY HERE | constantly warp to the same site in your pod over and over`, it is an activity that `humans` enjoy
---
nothing to see here, fellow `human` `ha ha ha`
---
See Pitt, when you say sane things you get upvotes:p:)
---
I've personally killed more than the listed 1 ship in Branch. So this isn't all encompassing for sure. I've seen lots of other hunter groups up there in addition to my little gang.
---
It does lower your risk. The less time you spend in space min is ng the less chance someone catches you.
---
Jesus christ. Please leave eve. You have no idea what the game is about.
---
A structure that requires a high infrastructure and upkeep would be a good option
---
I agree that it hurts the game, but less due to free intel and more due to "kb green" issues.
---
However, I really don't think that removing the official interface helps. I think a delay would be good, but removing it entirely actually makes things worse in some ways -- if nothing else, we don't want to go back to the fake killmail age.
---
Congratulations on the kill, Russian Thunder Squad.
---
Cant be a bot. People on the internet have been saying that the blackout has stopped all botting.
---
11101101110100101110010100110
---
You mean recons? That's a drop in the bucket for overall t2 demand, and temporary. It's easily countered by the fact that no one is losing 400 eagles/muninns at a time unlike a month or two ago.
---
I wish it weren't true. Been nice getting fights in the blackout since no one knows how many are really there and willing to give it a go. I almost unsubbed after a war full of blue balls on both sides. Miss the old FA days when people fought :(
---
Look at it this way.
---
If there are ten rorq miners with one rorq each, 5 of them quit the game because of blackout. Assuming the others keep on mining, your ore is more valuable, as is whatever you build with it. Also with the blackout, lots of ships have been dying, so I can see a demand for your completed product rising. This blackout will increase your risk, but it also increases your reward by stifling competition and increasing demand. If you keep mining, your efforts will be more valued than in the past. 
---
Also, ignore the idiots who unironically think miners are bad people for mining. You have every right to play the game how you want to, because it is a game.
---
It is pronounced hee-lah, not gee-lah you numbnuts.
---
No, the endpoint is a 1 hour period.
---
Regardless of how sandbox Eve is, the players aren't here to do all the work themselves. It's just not what 99% of players log in for. Very few people want to spend their RL free to brainstorming how they can work around the mechanics in the game and the attitudes of other players that cause there to be fewer fights.
---
It's CCP's job to create an environment that creates PVP. Too much intel, too many mechanics rewarding (or not penalizing) blobs, too few reasons to seek out PVP. These are things CCP has brought about IN ADDITION to the whole "risk averse" playerbase. It's on them to spice things up with changes like the blackout.
---
If I bew you up in wspace and you were new, I would have sent you isk.
---
Just to split hairs, it would be better as a 24hr delay, not a once-per-day update. If it was done once per day, (let just say downtime) then it would be fine for EU/USTZ players, but AUTZ would get a big intel dump halfway through their playtime. Which would make the blackout less effective for those that just happen to play in AUTZ. Which would suck.
---
Overall a big boost to combat recon.
---
Why hide ur name and corp. As soon as zkill is up anyone can see who you are by finding the the bot's (xi andedare) losses...
---
I used to played on a 40" tv on my desk 1080p with a 24" monitor 1080p off to the side. The tv had the main space with the ship centered and the monitor had all the info windows. Ended up hating it and now have a single 25" 1440p
---
They could still allow verification of legitimacy.
---
It seems there is much that could be done to cut back on the free intel while keeping some of the stuff people may want. But as usual, such discussion will probably never happen because CCP.
---
Find me one nullsec system with static wormholes.
---
I don't know what that is. 
---
Is it a lot? Is it a little?
---
Warp core stabilisers. Low slot item. One will deal with a disruptor, two for a scram, etc.
---
There's no counter to bombers? WTF
---
AYAYAYA
---
:doubt:
---
They're going to fucking ruin it with observatories, which was the plan for the past six years, sure. But they're not flat out reverting it.
---
It's the only good thing to happen to this game in over a decade.
---
:thonkers:
---
there are a couple of ways to do that but depending on the situation you might lose your ship anyway.
---
the "direct" way of doing it is using "warp core stabilisers". these are low slot modules that counter disruptors.
---
the other way of doing it using an ecm burst though that's a bit hard to do cause usually the person disrupting you would be out of range.
---
tbh, the best way of not losing expensive ships to gatecamps and such is using a scout.
---
I would suggest avoiding mining like a plague as a new player. 
---
The moment you find out that it's literally a passive activity, with a really high skill point requirements, that scales all too well with multiboxing - you may literally quit the game in response.
---
Also: your ill-fitted barge can be killed by a couple of 1-mil ships, so those annoying people are actually annoying coz they can benefit off you.
---
Honestly, its fking zkill man. Everyone counts everything in isk nowadays and not fun. Except for Brave perhaps:) Its sad, win lose just fking fight and be glad someone is willing. Same could be said about having sex now that I think about it.
---
This feels trolly.
---
It would defeat the fucking purpose. What good is making local something you could *theoretically* disrupt only to give the structure a week of invulnerability timers and an instant titan safety net?
---
Yea I'm glad I finally am at a spot with isk where I can provide ships for handout on Corp roams. Long as guys are having fun who cares about the losses
---
Test and Frat are still fighting so eagles and muninns still die a lot. I don't really see how that changed much.
---
Nah, there are waivers for almost everything. It’s still possible
---
Ooooh you so sneaky
---
Delaying of killmails I’m all for. The blackout of local is amazing and imo should become standard not temporary. Nullsec has become so much more exciting. The in game map should still show the same data it does now (pilots in space last 30 minutes) to avoid hunting in empty regions but its not up to the minute data so it’s not guaranteed you’ll find something. Dotlan could disappear without me losing sleep but I do use it to check ratting deltas etc. Either way thanks for making nullsec fun again. So many times these last few days I’ve been surprised by incoming gangs or come across gate camps.
---
You can't balance anything in this game with cost.
---
It just means the umbrellas get worse and everyone else leaves.
---
The system kills endpoint only provides the last hour's worth of kills.
---
Depends on the day, some days it's worth the paper its printed on, other days is not worth to pick them up from the street.
---
The Venezuelan Jita traders use them to make jewlery and clothes.
---
Sounds like it’s time for you to find a new game
---
All signs point to no
---
Thank you for being the literally only source of NS content prior to this.
---
he doesn't need to...we just keep raising the tax on the keepstar in perimeter(said with an irony in the voice)...well, at least this time he isn't the only one bad guy to blame. The main question is: did the Mittani pushed Northern Panfam for this step or vise versa?

&gt; we had established that lack of free intel makes for a better game
---
It is helpful to be able to consider the point of view of the other side even when you disagree with them. Prevents one get entangled in logical pretzels that don't exist, such as now.
---
Half
---
its bad, cant wait for subs to drop as 20 man mining fleets dont want to sub, and they revert it back. If you want no local go to wormholes. It's cool that this got rid of sub cap ratting and now you have to have a carrier+ to rat. Good job shitting on the new players CCP :) . it's what you do best.
---
You got what you wanted Joe, enjoy it cuck.
---
Can confirm, test was in our place earlier. It was like looking at local before blackout!
---
Lol without the purge
---
Marco.
---
This, we don’t need to remove kill mails full stop. We just need to do some kind of opsec scrubbing on the location and the problem is solved.
---
Personally i doubt you sell that well, as i also sell fw amarr lp and i keep track of what sells, volumes, etc ...
