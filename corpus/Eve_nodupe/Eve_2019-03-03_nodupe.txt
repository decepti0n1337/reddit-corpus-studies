GF !

care to elaborate a bit? :-)

if we dedicated a sig to fucking with him I'm pretty sure he'd chug an entire keg of his anti-goon kool-aid and then completely lose his shit on reddit.... on second thought that sounds like a great idea.
---
(bear in mind that a highsec structure takes a minimum of 6.5 days to kill. At best. With perfect timing. You can always let the war lapse, and redo it.)
---

---
(5.5 days minimum for the structure reinforce. it can be substantially longer.)
---
Nope. Remember that every time you hop in a suicide ship, or kill an enemy, you‚Äôre sending at least a few people to their deaths
---
Show me on the doll where the capital blob dropped on you.

GF! not a shitty lag fest. Proper combat.

Ummm... I give a fuck. MJD and pop their asses while still pulling away with MWD, they can't even come closer then 60km to me before they die, though unfortunately, they chose to GTFO themselves instead and I have no way to tackle. In the event of a 2nd or 3rd ship coming in I have far more then plenty of time to GTFO myself, though that has never happened to me. Thats when I would say fuck the MTU.

Do you feel it now Mr krabbs

&gt;new overview settings went in a few months ago.
---
Are you sure about that? [This](https://i.imgur.com/d2IaXdN.png) is the default overview as of this post when I made a new profile. 
---
It still doesn't include velocity which is a pretty basic bit of information someone needs. 
---
I heard a rumour that SASH is trash, can anyone confirm?

This is why I play Eve

---
Yeah, fair enough. I worded that part badly.
---
&gt;him RMTing and botting (no proof of either)
---
clearly there was no proof of botting, but he very clearly did offer you the choice to buy "raider points" with donations and subs, which you could then spend to buy in-game items including PLEX, so yes he was in fact offering RMT services.
---
I just started playing, but I remember hearing that in eve you can essentially invent things. What are the limits to this? Can you create a brand new type of weapon or ship if you are creative enough?  Or is it more like WoW crafting, but with customizable modifiers?
---
He still has the store page up and still give you points to use in the store in exchange for donations and subs, that's cash for in-game items which is the exact definition of RMT.
---
You would think that wouldn't you. history has shown otherwise
---
&lt;3
---
Wow how is the weather all the way up there on the top of his dick?
---
Nope there's just a vocal and borderline insane minority
---
It's more of your run of the mill MMO crafting, or probably less so. 
---
The invention mechanic is simply a way of making Tech 2 modules and ships out of Tech 1 modules and ships. The end result is static and you can't modify it. The fun in invention is finding a way to optimize your production chain, but there's no way to make the end result stronger or better, the only thing you can do is to make production more efficient. 
---
There are also Mutagens that can modify the stats on certain modules, but the way they can modify stats is also limited in adjusting the stats +/- a few percentage points. They're more like Divine Orbs in Path of Exile. 
---
Most of the inventive building in Eve comes at the fitting stage, when you choose what modules to fit to your ship. You can end up creating a ship with a innovative fit that allows it to function in a novel manner, but it's not going to be a unique ship that only you can have.

There are! Search for them, on the internet I saw some guys who had their collection, Google for it mate :)
---
The story goes that your crew members know they are on an almost guaranteed suicide mission, but the payout to their family when they die is like 1000isk and that's enough to support a non capsuleer family for the rest of their lives. Capsuleers are considered near godlike with infinite wealth compared to the non augmented plebs that die when you decide to try and fly a ship in space and get blapped.

Took me over 10min of rereading the definition of unrealized/realized profit to think of a possible way he could spin it in some other direction, and you are indeed right CCP get their $$$ when you buy the plex there is no unrealized profit there for them at any point at all.
---
Sash is indeed trash. I can confirm.

I never see any good looking stuff. Too busy looking at D-scan, chat, the overview and such. Inside of citadels and stations not too attractive.

Wow, that is quite the date range you had to use in order to achieve those results.

at this point I feel like people posting grr Olmeca and grr Mar5hy threads are posting alts of Olmeca and Mar5hy b/c they don't see enough of themselves on reddit. 
---
:(
---
Ah, got it, thanks! I literally just finished that first tutorial chain of quests, the one where you learn about basic combat. I figured I should start thinking about how I want to play and what I want to do. Though I don't even really understand what my options are yet. 
---
you assume these are goon posters and not more Olmeca / Mar5hy alts attempting reverse spin
---
you seem upset... here, have a seat
---
For the record I new to goonswarm and we make fun of ourselves as much as you think we make fun of everyone else.

I played the 'GRRR GOONS' game before.

Dont carry animosity for your fellow player even if you end up fighting them

In the end of the day we are all still just players of  internet spaceships like everyone else

We just want to have fun like everyone else

I hated them for years. I really did. Then a old buddy of mine convinced me to give them a chance
---
I can say I love it out here. There's a lot of good people in Goons. And because there are so many of us you aren't nearly as pressured to be in game so you can have a social life in real life too

I can believe the imperium triggered 2 autists so hard that 100% of the posts they make are about them

Someone seems upset with Mar5hy. A 40k alliance rattled by what, 2/3 guys? Much respect for them. They are showing you up big time. You post about the guy daily. He must be on your mind.

I made this pretty tongue-in-cheek, since I HAVE gotten a lot of good fights in lowsec in the last 10 days or so. But I was grumpy today after my last 2 hours of roaming black rise leading to nothing but triple boxed tristans and garmurs, comets as far as the eye can see, a bunch of botters/farmers who x their client as soon as I land on grid... And one punisher who fought me with a 25k ehp meme fit.

This is good to know.

yeesh you sound like olmeca

srsly tho
---
The capsuleer replaces most or all of the bridge of a ship, but not the rest of it. There's quite a bit of automation in other systems of the ships as well, for capsuleer or not, but people still do quite a lot of the work.

Please friend your NBA posts are on point why so much hate?

‚ÄòThey are bots. I have 100% evidence of it from recording my ops with Olmeca and Mar5hy. Going to release a video of it soon.
---
Mar5hy was literally declokaed next to the nyx ship scanning him. He also anchored a bubble 10km in his align path and he just kept on ratting.
---
The VNI's undocked every 60 seconds when we left system so he just bubble trapped them.‚Äô Posting on behalf of Mar5hy. Tell him he owes 1 billion in unpaid visa fees for every Don Trolleone resident in Goon space. He also has a tax liability for any earnings on fees paid for his camping services, and Olmeca owes export duties for all the Excavators. Please report to a duty Goonwaffe revenue officer at 1DQ who‚Äôll be happy to settle their outstanding account.

Yeah, anyone who pays for plex has seen a 33% boost in isk/hr over the last few weeks

Trig Dred pls. Also, give some BSes ability to fit XL weapons, same as BCs can fit XL.

Keep at it. There are a lot of things to do in Eve. 
---
CCP accounting puts the plex money into a separate account until it gets used in game.

can't remember why they do it though but that is how they were doing it last time we could see their report back in 2014 or 2015 i think

Au contrare, Mar5hy voicepiece stooge, Goons didn‚Äôt just change their name to the Don Trolleone Pest Control, so it appears BBTB has made Mar5hy much more vexed than he has made goons who are mostly delighted to have a replacement Gevlon. We simply require your puppet master to pay his proper taxes to the Imperium whilst operating a commercial pest control business on sovereign territory.

How about violently euthanizing yourself in an incredibly painful way?
---
AFAIK you can't actually use those tags in-game, as the game will "escape" the special characters and render them as text. - You have to edit them in config files outside the client.
---
Simplest way seems to be to just export your overview settings, then open the resulting YAML file in a text editor and make the amends you want. Then you can import the resulting file back into the game.
---
That was an attempt at being edgy or something? What are you? 12?

No, the points aren't for any cash services, that _was_ corrected: points are gained by viewing at regular intervals, following (free), and via raffles and such in chat. I've managed to rack up a fair number of points and redeemed a few things, and not paid a penny to him or Twitch. Actually, only time I've even paid money to/through Twitch at all was for the Eveathon sub, which I forgot about and left running for a couple months. Never done bits or donations, or paid for a sub to anyone other than that.
---
Eve Corporations are the equivalent of guilds or clans in other MMOs, though there are a fair bit of additional complexities involved. They're typically the core of your social group, or at least a group with some shared goals and activities as Corps are the basis of organization in Eve. You not only have a shared corp chat channel, but it's also a lot easier to communicate and organize within a corp. For example, when you open up a fleet and make an advert, you can set the fleet to automatically allow everyone from your own corp to join rather easily without having to fiddle around with inviting each person. 
---
NPC Corps are fine to stay in if you're the solitary type, but I'd highly recommend you join a PC corp. PC Corps have social nets that can provide support and assistance, as well as trust which are all important things in a social game. A beginner corp like Pandemic Horde will give easy access to resources like free ships, experienced players to talk to, and exclusive access to information on their forums and what not.

It was viewable to the public for several days that he was offering to do give raider points in exchange for subs and donatons. It doesn't matter if he stopped doing it after people brought attention to it, if he ever did it at all he still RMT'd.

UALX: It went so bad for TAPI, they choose to be Goon's pets
---
It already feels empty, Eve is mostly sit and wait for pings while ether rorqin some roids or playing other games. 
---
hmmm, I think such a change wouldn't effect many of those who already have some more rewarding things to do. I mean, those who are already in a active corp and have some regular pvp content wouldn't just no longer go undock and stay in the station play the simulator right?
---
I think this feature would mostly give those who are not  PvPing right now some more convenience to find fight, and thus be able to give more people a chance to get their toes wet. Probably this will give them more incentive and more importantly more courage to go undock and find "real fight". 
---
Right now if you look at any places in eve, par from some low sec area, most of the players are not trying to PvP. It won't make this game somehow more empty. I mean, for example, if I'm in a system looking for some action, do I really care if that other guy in local is doing mission or exploration or mining or ratting or docked up playing my suggested simulation? If he don't fight me, I can't find the action.  The only alternative would be just high sec ganking, get myself some content by interrupting other people's content. 
---

For a reasonable fee I‚Äôm prepared to carry out an audit of your accounts and if satisfied will issue you with a tax compliance certificate good for 30 days. Mar5hy however has clearly violated the tax code by advertising his services via his numerous agents and therefore remains liable to Imperium income tax on any income received whilst temporarily resident in Imperium territory, and capital gains tax on any property he has obtained in the course of his activities.

You have problems.

Quite simple: EVE is a social game and anybody who attempts to play it solo is going to miss out on most of the charm. Corporations are groups of players whose interests and in-game politics align. Corp mates work together to accomplish shared goals.

Which end of an insurance contract is the "uncommon" one?
---
Key part I was correcting:

&gt; [...] and *still gives* you points to use in the store in exchange for donations and subs [...]
---
Not going to defend past actions or claim to know his intentions (or whether that matters or not). Fact is, currently, points are not available for 'purchase', so saying they still are is incorrect.

EVE's 'invention' system is a complete misnomer. You can be forgiven for expecting that you would use *invention* to create something new and perhaps unexpected. In EVE, *invention* is entirely predictable. You know what you're going to get before you start and everything that you can *invent* already has already existed in the game for years. Even worse, after you *invent* something the first time, if you want to keep building more of them you have to *invent* it again each time. A more descriptive name for the process would be "blueprint enhancement".

He gets revenue based on his viewers (ad revenue). Therefore, he is still giving items in exchange for money. That is RMT. Also, it does not matter if he is still doing it. He has participated in RMT and deserves a perma.

&gt;Every vessel that has been designed or retrofitted to be flown by a capsuleer only needs one capsuleer to pilot it, not thousands.
---
&gt;**However, it does require a standard complement of crew to be able to function**, these are the numbers that you see on the EVElopedia.
---
&gt;The argument "why isn't everything drone serviced and automated" is pretty simple - meat is cheaper to replace than electronics, and high tech automation doesn't respond well when the ship it happens to be on board is being battered by a storm of vicious EMP, ECM and a million other kinds of interference.
---
The nice thing about wormholes is that they let you go from the safest area of space (hi-sec) to one of the most dangerous (j-space).  And in EVE, danger means money.  PM me if you want some alpha explo help.  I've done wormholes for a couple of years now and I love bringing fresh blood into them.

No, and here is why. EVE has always been about spontaneous, unscripted events happening in a way nobody is able to fully predict. The fact that when you undock and have to think about where to hunt, who to hunt, what to hunt, and more importantly what not to fight and how to position yourself or your fleet in the most advantageous position is what makes PVP in EVE truly unique to every other game out there right now.
---
Non-Consenual fighting is an afterthought. After all EVE at its core is a PVP game and anyone who doesnt understand that doesnt really understand EVE. EVE's history is full of bloodshed, treachery, and conquest all the way from the massive power bloc struggles right down to solo pilots harassing people in small gangs over a grudge. With the way the game has evolved the Hunt has already gotten alot more challenging for a myriad of reasons I am not going to elaborate on because it's simply too complicated for one post.
---
People who want to try PVP need to get out into the void and die. Alot. And eventually they will become better as a result. Part of that learning curve is associated with the Risk Factor and the knowledge gained by knowing which fights to take and which to not. Smashing into each other in some kind of random instanced pvp simulator is contrary to the very nature of PVP in EVE itself. 
---
A final thought, we are currently seeing the attempt of this being made with Abyssal proving grounds. And while interesting it is very limited in scope by design, and even so has many problems associated with it. It would be a disaster to implement game wide without every needing to undock.
---
Its all the same mate.

Idk if you've talked about it yet.
---
I could say the same thing to you. 
---
Can't believe I sold everything :(
---
Maybe it's not that uncommon, but the dread surviving. Must be risky for a random guy to serve on a capsuleer dread, but if they're getting even a small cut of the insurance, it's got to pay off big for them
---
The meta skewed really hard like 3 years ago to faction BS then BALANCE happened and they more or less became forgotten after that.

Jokes on you the NDA lasts 5 years

Why did baller t3s die to t1 bc's?
---
:flex:
---
But then you're paying 2x plex + and making eve your life
---
I see what you did there
---
I got called irrelevant by BBTB who's been trying to station camp us for 2 weeks now
---
Apparently a lot of people have no idea how hands off rorqs/vnis/domis are. You can literally go play another game with them. I leave domis out ratting and take the dog for a walk. Also, with skill extractors, once your alt accounts are trained to where u want them, you can sell enough injectors to get to about 0-2 hours of ratting to pay for the account. It's one of those things where you don't really have to do anything to keep accounts subbed, and once you're there, you can make huge piles of isk quickly.
---
You are two months and 11 days early. My NDA expires on May 13.
---
Except in your case when it lasts about nine. Or eleven. Or 14. ;-) The NDA specifically states that if you keep accepting "Proprietary Information", you keep pushing the deadline back.
---
Not that bad, considering you also want to have money for ships for pvp or whatever. Suddenly you need a lot more than 65m a day if you wanna fly big boy ships or t3c
---
How it's start?
---
At first, OOS bait Banderlogs with Raven.
---
We tried to kill him with subcap, but he burn a cyno and jump Hel.
---
He already did it in the past, so we were ready.
---
We drop him with dreads.
---
In half of his shield to system jumped second OOS Hel and FAX.
---
In this moment Tri scout in system saw a fight.
---
And to system jumped \~30 Tri dreads to shot us (and then Hel)
---
After this Siberian Squad jumped with supers too (wtf they are doing here?) and start to kill us/Tri. 
---
Then Snuffs drop dread-bomb to Sibsquad supers. And Banderlogs mostly dead gone to reship sabre's :)
---
On after party were Inits, NC, etc but fight already finished :)
---
"He gets revenue based on his viewers (ad revenue)." If that was grounds for RMT then all the eve streamers with ads who also give things away would be banned by now.
---
But this?  
---
"  it does not matter if he is still doing it. He has participated in RMT and deserves a perma. " Absolutely, ban him he was blatantly promoting RMT of both direct purchase AND raffle varieties, if they are going to go after people doing it under the table they need to ban everyone who does it right out in public.

Lol the eve community is actually one of the more welcoming in gaming. Eve players love teaching new players about the game lol

That fit wont survive level 5s without strong logi support - even if your capacitor would survive the capital neuts (it will not, with those fittings) the tank that fit offers is abysmal for level 5s which typically put out 1.5-3k dps. You will get volleyed off the field more or less.
---
I wouldnt recommend level 5s unless you really know what you're doing since it requires a lot of game sense - level 5s reward LP, not ISK (market knowledge) and very bespoke fits.
---
90% of the level 5 mission guides are outdated and wrong, too.
---
Ill check the xml tomorrow, or remind me, i have color tags on my junk
---
More like
---
"Undock in a dirt cheap ship and a naked pod.  Don't bother renaming ship because people are too retarded to use that information wisely.  Don't say GF; they aren't even in local because they can't get a pod away from anything with more than 300 scan res."
---
I don't rename my ships, have lived in the same area for years, I sit at novices in destroyers; and people STILL warp to me at 0 in their rifters.
---
And in reality?  A 2m rifter isn't supposed to make 20 mil in a few minutes for sitting on a button, not in the heart of outlaw space.  The same shit happens to me, you think I don't see devoters when I am in a carrier?  I do; I see them on Dscan and I see known interdictors in local and I play accordingly; it isn't hard to know what the hell is going on in a system at any given time.
---
I assume there‚Äôs beginner or newb friendly corps(like guilds?) around?
---
There‚Äôs many of those. Join the r/Eve discord server and ask around. https://discord.gg/zXJsvAJ

Just pay 20 dollars, why grind when you can just drive for Uber for a few hours
---
Reddit isn't the place for that, he should join Legacy.
---
Why does more expensive plex give ccp more money?
---
because you can't learn fly a fighter jet by learning to drive a car
---
Why do levels exist in other MMOs?
---
So I've been thinking of coming back, when I played last I only did pirate site explo in null/WH but this time I'd like to expand on that, is there a single ship (other than a t3c) that can run C1-3 combat sites and then refit for hacking or will I need basically 2 ships?
---
Who had the most fun?
---
Eve is a game about giant spaceships blowing each other to pieces. Why does realism suddenly matter
---
hey moskold
---
Can I suggest you modify the fountain losses so they arnt courted twice in the imperium losses.. seems like the only screw up there
---
Drive for Uber
---
gotem
---
Carrier is more expensive than dread because there are no super dreads and titan has their own skillbook
---
I eagerly await the day 
---
Wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to show this. There are Fountain losses that aren‚Äôt INIT, and there are INIT losses that aren‚Äôt in Fountain. I believe the total from both is the Fountain losses, plus a Nyx and 1-2 Rorquals in Querious that INIT lost. 
---
All the zkill links are in the data link if you want to add it up yourself

This is not an issue anymore. You could have injected the skills if you were in a hurry.

Interceptor is a tech 2 ship they all take longer to train. If everything was immediately usable on day one (not counting credit cards) what achievement would you get out of the game? Day1 end game content dosnt exactly enthral people for the long haul.
---
/me sends a memo to the CCP hitsquads....
---
Have you gone berserk?!  Can't you see that that man is a ni?
---
To think, Init are some of the Imperiums' more talented pvp'ers.
---
Because a new account should not be able to fly a titan. Also you need to work as a team, you should be taking note of what your alliance flys and train that. Ships for the most part are cheap, It is the skills that cost.
---
Because more people will be willing to buy plex for real money.

---
i remember reading similar threads about reavers and black ops in pure blind for months.  They mattered till they didn't, I think we came out on top in the end what do you think.  
---
I'm not your friend, guy.
---
It's an AT price ship from a very long time ago. Don't know which AT it was, but it must have been in the first six ATs, since the numbering starts with the Geri and Freki which both have the "VII" Tag. Other ships in that line are the Raven State Issue, Megathron Federate Issue, Armageddon and Apocalypse Imperial Issue.
---
Other rare or even unique ships are;
---
Guardian Vexor - limited issue, reward for some event, don't know if they were AT prizes too. They're the only ships that can actually field 6 drones.
---
Gold and Silver Magnate - reward for a community event. Only one of each existed, both were owned by the same pilot who took both of them to battle and lost them.
---
Emergency Response Stratios - A blue Stratios. I don't know much about if it's actually exists in someone's hangar. According to my information these were supposed to be given out by a capsuleer run lottery in cooperation with CCP. However the distribution didn't take place, because the lottery imploded beforehand.
---
Ishukone Watch Scorpion - I think these were planned as Aurum (that was before PLEX was the premium currency) shop Scorpions. If I remember correctly it was only only a regular scorpion, but Ishukone skinned.
---
Chinese Special Editions - If you dig through the Blueprints of some ships, you will find some ships are required for the manufacture in some weird chinese recipe. The ship that comes out basically just says something like "Ishtar Special Edition". I don't know how these recipes are acquired, since they seem to be China exclusive. Those special editions don't provide any special bonuses however and are equal to their regular counterpart.
---
You tell me
---
Question: Is the guy with the drake on his gun a friend,m enemy, or spy?
---
It would be more fun if isk was the limiting factor.
---
Shut up, retard
---
Fair point.
---
Why should the limiting factor be the time I have owned an account instead of, say, my ability to earn isk.
---
I‚Äôm not making any statement about how successful INIT has been or will be, that‚Äôs open to interpretation. 
---
Reavers put up some some big wins, but also some solid feeds.I‚Äôd actually be happy to see bigger plays from INIT, instead of these attempts with bombers. At the very least, Reavers put up more of a challenge. 
---
Historically though, the Imperium has had little success from Hakonen. Remains to be seen whether this will be any different. 
---
ez clap 4 horde and co
---
imagine being init and getting fukked by HORDE supers and bombers
---
Hopefully everything is accurate, let me know if it‚Äôs not or I‚Äôm missing anything 
---
I am wondering, since you can buy plex and convert it to isk, does that ruin the game for anyone, just knowing that isnt a possibility to get far ahead from just paying real money? 
---
If I‚Äôm a new account and I manage to accumulate many billions of isk. Why shouldn‚Äôt I be allowed to spend it?
---
Considering that you are including ships killed in other alliances by other groups, you should consider adding in the Ragnarok lost by BOT and associated caps (We all know they why). It would be only fair!
---
O
---
Must have trained past 5 to do that .looks like you've Won EVE.
---
Thanks fam! Although I do not believer there was only one of each magnates, since they both have died once, and yet there are new kills with them on zkill. A corpmate had a plan to kill a particular Gold magnate, theorycrafted fits for a while, so we sat there waiting for a while waiting for the magnate, he never showed. A few days later dude that owns the magnate quits Eve and kills it himself. https://zkillboard.com/kill/63024687/
---
Just buy skill Injectors
---
Here you go dude. [http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Escalation](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Escalation) Bookmark it, read what it says on the top in detail, follow the links, come back to the bookmark for specific escalations description ( AKA Expeditions ). Gives you all the info you need.
---
Isk is the limiting factor, just buy injectors if you have spare isk.
---
Posting in a "not winning fast enough" thread
---
I bought a half fitted and rigged one for 12 bill.
---
What if you could just spawn straight into it and all the abyssal instances were connected with a system of gates so you could travel between them?
---
Attempting to burn people for asking questions is punishable by being hanged drawn and quartered 
---
I mean, it wasn't the Reavers that killed 10 keepstars and 40 or so titans - it was the entirety of TEST Snuff and Imperium. 
---
To be fair you should list the member count of Horde, PL, and NC. against that of INIT. and IM to calculate the efficiency of each. Numbers don't mean anything without perspective.
---
https://youtu.be/7NiYVoqBt-8
---
thanks for frags fc
---
No not really. It let me play the game for free for years. Injectors changed things a bit but for years isk didn‚Äôt really mean you could get further ahead the game. 
---
Also in EVE isk doesn‚Äôt mean further ahead. It just means bigger kill mails. Knowledge is everything. All the isk in the world isn‚Äôt going to make you do production better, or know how to get in a frigate fight properly or how to recognize bait when jumping a capital in. 
---
Plex also allows people who don‚Äôt have the time or don‚Äôt enjoy isk making to jump in the game for PvP only and fund that somehow. That increases active player count by a dramatic amount so that‚Äôs good for the game. 
---
If you have any battle reports of Panfam sub losses, I‚Äôd be happy to include them 
---
wew never thought dropping a bubble on a nyx would end in that. Great fight all. :)
---
This made me realize it‚Äôs not about the isk efficiency. It‚Äôs about the friends we made along the way :‚Äô)

---
big OOF
---
The time a battle takes doesn't really have anything to do with giving the defenders time to form though, generally groups form before a timer so that they're in place once a structure becomes vulnerable, rather than forming after hostiles have started shooting it.
---
I would also dispute that the cap has any effect on the length of time a battle takes, since the min time created by a cap isn't the minimum amount of time that a battle is occurring, but rather that a structure is being bashed, aka pve is occurring, and to make matters worse it doesn't effect the max amount of time a battle can take, since once pvp assets are committed to a fight the time a battle will take is determined by the ships on grid rather than the time it takes to bash a strucutre. Ualx for instance continued long after there were any structures left to shoot.
---
Structures that can be repped, have no dps cap, and are immune to doomsdays would make for more interesting nullsec wars than what we currently have (provided that faxes were nerfed so that they didn't rep for like 3 supers worth of dps or weren't as cheap to suicide)

The china superfleet is starting to get abit scary.

LMAO!!!!!! dang.....I was there...saw something different....TEST ate shit and TEST titan fleet retreating?? Poor Komodo left to die!!

Dam that's lit.

Thank you.

He had no implants at all, that might have helped us a bit
---
Waffles is listed on the wrong side just a heads up!
---
he stole my video for karma!
---
My most painful upvote
---
this is more about kicking SUAD for ruining our kb
---
How embarrassing
---
Ping goes out for titans. Komodo is a titan. Makes sense to me.
---
Kind of like an AAR from WAFFLES side.
---
We took a Kikimora roam out through a WH, shotgunned some anoms two of our sabres managed to get tackle on Nyx. 
---
We held the Nyx for a while spotted a TEST FC in local asked them if they wanted to come and help, TAPI brought their Goku fleet and bunch of dictors to help secure tackle, shortly after FRT jumped in their supers to save the tackled Nyx. A few moments later a solo Ragnarok was tackled 1 system away so we began to burn our remaining sabres/fleet over to the Ragnarok to help tackle and whore, GOKU fleet came as well and killed it, FRT jumped in apostles to try and save it, but they where a few moments too late FRT began to jump more caps/subs in to clear tackle. 
---
At this point we were contemplating heading home but TAPI began to gate supers over to try and clean up what was left of the grid we stuck around whored on the Erebus and a few more apostles, after the Bus died we started to head home then it escalated from there.
---
Good fights all around, thanks for making eve worth playing still :pray:
---
and your friends will run away while you die
---
Eating what? who? xD
---
Probably pulled them.
---
The biggest issue I see is that missiles are a ton better for PvE then turrets. A lot of new players wanna go do PvE when they start to get somewhat of a feeling for the game etc. so naturally they go missiles.
---
If CCP wants them to go more turrets, then they need to buff turret boats with regards to PvE, then these new players will spread out more as they come into the game.
---
I don't quite know how to do that, because if they do buff them for PvE, then they will become OP for PvP, but if all turrets become equally OP for PvP then they would be balanced with faster fights ? I don't know.
---
Some things are super easy to adjust though, for example weather effects in AByss, could just give turrets some buffs without affecting anything outside of Abyss, would be nice to have some more optimal options other then Gila or Sac ( if dark filaments ). 
---
that makes it worse
---
Hey now, what the fuck. Rude.
---
We bragged about it while killing them not after. get your facts straight.
---
That it died in battle instead of docked?
---
yah i was surprised when i saw that post
---
Frat feeding komodo shit
---
https://imgur.com/a/tkpY25C
---
You're right, we should have just called all global titans to deaggress, we wouldn't want them to get an easy win on the battle report.
---
That's what happens when you make deals to let them bot unmolested for 6 months
---
Even the US doesn't let some people have guns.
---
Its really not for a free game
---
This is on a brand new account because I do not want my horde alt getting banned. Thank you Komodo Pilot!!!!

TEST will never stop shitposting, We have to many members who care about who we are and what we stand for to let anyone Hit the Delete key on us!
---
I see people bringing up "Ohh PGL is posting shit again in r/eve again" and "oh u fucked up and came...errm posted too fast" literally not knowing wtf they are saying only spewing out roomers they here without the full story..... TEST will not stop shitposting even now as we are fighting chinese botters we are still doing what we need to do.
---
I like to look at things from a surprising perspective, A Goonswarm perspective.... If Omelca can shit post goons to death, outnumberd by austism and worse then us then seriously, TEST has fuck all to worry about.
---
Now get back to your mining you cheeky shit's
---
AWKWARD
---
Since skills cap at level five it works as a catch-up mechanic. Depending on what ship / skills and stuff you don't you to train for 10 full years to pilot, let's say, a Rifter if you're against another character that has been active for that long.
---
If you're that into being able to progress via the in-game money only just buy injectors, like everybody else has told you.
---
Rip, it‚Äôs fitting that it dies as the first as well. 
---
Can we get a fourth random comment from you in the same post?
---
Glad I didn‚Äôt have my pimp fit bud, you‚Äôd have a Komodo sitting in cargo.
---
I told y'all what would happen when PGL's TESTicles finally dropped their supers
---
[I've been using this ragnarok since my main accts were banned](https://zkillboard.com/character/94623465/).   Really it got a nice life a titan could ever dream of.

To be fair with legacy fax numbers they'd never save him.

New waffles recruitment add material right here.
---
Nah. You know what's even more lame than losing a ship? Keeping it docked because you're scared you're going to lose it. Laugh all you want, no one in TEST is going to be bothered by this, our favorite currency is not ISK it's explosions. All must die eventually, some will die sooner than others.
---
And that kids, is why you dock your faction titans. :P
---
Closer to 400b rather than 240b on "value".

thanks for roaming around. your sabers were very on point

Thought you meant that you killed a rat for it, then it kicked in.
---
Just so you know? If you were in a fleet (you probably were to be on-grid during whatever battle this was) there's a looting log.

So, if they care: They know.

Ok, then don't. I obviously don't speak for everybody, but in my opinion, if you're not losing ships sometimes you're not really playing the right game. There are better spreadsheets out there if that's your thing.
---
What the absolute fuck is that Komodo poorfit.

At least man fit it like this [https://zkillboard.com/kill/71605015/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/71605015/)

Yeah I'd be worried about getting lost in there.

True Olmeca would Put this in an 1000 Word long autistic post
---
Okay I am just getting into this game and I have some questions.
---
Firstly I am looking for a method to have a passive income supply and was thinking Planetary Interaction, is that feasible and if it is would anyone have a link to a decent guide about it? Everything I have found is absolutely awful and unclear.
---
Secondly using this passive income I would love to get into PVP but from my understanding you have to essentially have a corp for that, issue is that I am a complete newbie so I will probably be quite useless to a corp having little to no experience so whats the best way to get into a fairly decent corp that doesn‚Äôt rely on just knowing people beforehand and is there any corps that don‚Äôt require people being mega experienced just willing to learn

Not gonna say we don't have egg on our face but it was a freak bump that happened to him when he was almost at 0 on the gate.  Coulda been any number of titans that had that happen to them and it ended up being the Komodo of all things.  Welp.
---
There are no Horde Newbies. Just Goon Alts
---
but TEST is bad...
---
no no i believe explosions are fun.
---
i just don't believe that they are your alliance's favorite currency
---
also jumping into east detorid with no faxes on a saturday
---
Needs more purple.
---
i heard he bumped like 40km away from the gate and just couldnt get back. 
---
at least that is what i was told. 
---
when your enemy brings more titans than you brought faxes, you goofed
---
ITT: dinos who are NOT salty hahs xdd
---
came too fast
---
Maybe you should cut back on the input broadcasting, botting, or whatever it was that got you banned.
---
Hahaha
---
Shhh better keep it a secret 
---
5 cruiser kills and a HG crystal pod kill in exchange for 37 INIT kills.
---
Yeah, I *really* detested there were two 'gold' currencies. Made things real confusing.
---
Not quite up to snuff, zkill is off a bit on the Komodo's value (pretty typical for any ship that has few dying and low market sales for the zkill value to be off).  add about 150b onto test losses
---
If you read the br it clearly is more than 5 cruised kills, (also more then 37 init ones). Also thanks for standard issue nc shittalk
---
Why would you join FW if you get horrible restrictions like that? In my opinion being in FW should make it easier to live in lowsec, not harder! Already the ban that restricts docking in NPC stations made pirate groups gain huge advantage against FW.
---
my bad bro yall got some interceptors and an MTU too. Very cool.
---
I cant wait to see what test does to retaliate.  Pretty sure its gonna be hilarious,  start a huge war again and draw old players and new back into eve. Seems that large wars break out every time around this year.
---
Hi Mom
---
Yeah, we got some ceptors, t3ds, sabres, also there isn‚Äôt a hg pod in the br 
---
Pretty much this. Everyone will blame the bump and de-sync. Which absolutely happened but he should not have been there in the first place.
---
That shit is worth 40b at least. Don't go by in game value
---
Honestly I just assumed you were in WECU. because of your bad posting. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75488388/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75488388/)
---
Well yeah, it just wasn‚Äôt in the br I didn‚Äôt say it never happened
---
To be fair, this was like 12 NPE iterations ago now. 
---
Why do FW players want this? Why would you want to restrict your access to structures that anyone not in FW can use freely?
---
can't wait for ccp to reimburse it
---
Account sharing whoo what a crime 
---
maybe you should try mining.
---
Isn‚Äôt the BPC alone worth like 350?
---
Wow gottem, you couldn‚Äôt have just said gf could ya? Had to add the salty little shittalk lol. Nc so not a shocker tbh
---
bro it isn't even close even without the actual value of the komodo
---
Empty pod.....hmmmmmmm surely they didn't rip our their implants? Or do you really fly Komodos with empty pods? Use fancy toys but then pull out implants to take less loss on kb, I think I smell bullshit
---
Why would you care about a HIC in lowsec?
---
spoken like a true risk averse coward
---
In any game you play there will always be some sort of wait time before you acquire the ability to use the skill. Whether you are having to grind the XP or wait a period of time in eve's case. You are lucky that in eve you have the ability to buy skill injectors to use for learning skills.
---
 
---
They probably won‚Äôt care, they‚Äôll just be glad it didn‚Äôt go to one of our enemies 
---
This guy just makes cringy false flag posts for all kinds of alliances.

i am proud i made alliance click on 'needs more purple'.....its now numba wun... please click needs more purple...please. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75489664/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75489664/)
---
ya you are right.  for some reason i did not factor in build cost.  
---
I was about to say, what‚Äôs the point of having it if you aren‚Äôt going to use it? And in using it, you‚Äôre eventually going to lose it. Just fucking send it dude.
---
If you have a corp/alliance that has capitals you wouldn't join FW. Or if you have a corp that wants to grow then you have no reason to grow towards bigger ships. Do you really think that's a good idea? You want to fly frigates forever? 
---
FW used to be a place for groups to grow stronger &amp; practice pvp daily. Lately it's just been a place to fly small ships and there hasn't been any reason to grow.
---
Tapi claims victory
---
Tapi loses, looks like dipshits _again_

Better claim victory the only way tapi knows how

Hey, NC would have told him not to undock at all.
---
they forgot to mention that komodo pilot is flying empty pod or they ripped out implants
---
That‚Äôs close to $3000 real monies... I‚Äôd cry 
---
what even is this comment
---
There would be a griffin alt in every plex after that. PVP would get really annoying.

Wow, I am super jelly.

Little bit of both.

TEST will do what TEST does best, feed more.

Still an achievement! First to get and first to lose get to remain in history.

Lol, that's hilarious.

Not really. They are unable to work alone. This deployment will be a bust unless they convince GSF to go save them.
---
And same for you...
---
You can, on injecting skills.
---
Use it to buy a rorqual alt, it's an investment in your future.

Really nice pictures

You are pretty bad at this, can‚Äôt seem to hold a point

I mean, we're not GSF....
---
Cripes, ain't that the truth.
---
Bumping on a gate is pretty noob tbh
---
Wait seriously? 30 billion for that?
---
Why does he have a 10k pod &amp; i seriously doubt he pulled implants...

All this video shows me is a dude using his titan to kill friendly caps on keepstars and one of the first times it get used in real combat it gets fucking hubris dunked.

I know it isnt obvious to to the casual observer, but I encourage you to look at who showed up and aborted so many of our forts, or fought against us on behalf of local idiots we are fighting in PB over the last few months. Hint, it‚Äôs all goons/init/snuff/imperium pets. No panfam, just us VS 4x our numbers in imperium + pets. If panfam have showed up in late month 2/early month 3 of our campaign and helped us even the numbers, I would point you on to imperium pet‚Äôs initial activity attracting their attention as the primary cause of that.
---
Lucky. As. Hecc
---
You just stupid or not reading the brs? 
---
I love the noise, but it also tells me that you do realize the fact that INIT faring poorly against the most "elite" alliance in the game (NC.), the former most "elite" alliance in the game (PL) and their 17k members meat shield (PH) which in the past year proved to be quite a reasonable group, all under their considerable supercap umbrella, only shows that the decision to deploy was as correct as possible. INIT needs to remember(re-learn?) how to punch way above our weight and nothing but crabbing in F or Q is not going to achieve that.
---
its worth more. a lot more
---
Last one went for around 275 or so and they are 75b in ore to build so around 350~ to replace 
---
Another lie. Gimenate,It is a where those bots don't even want to stay.It was a nightmare for newbies.

30 bil for the DCU. Maybe .5 to 1 bil for the RCU. And maybe 2 bil for the smartbomb. You‚Äôre going to be set for a while now, unless you blow it all on injectors or something, which would be a bad idea with prices as high as they are right now

why? thats retarded lmao

This should be a copy pasta
---
Because if I get complacent and one gets on top of me; they have infinite points I can't escape from by dropping a mobile depot and refitting to core stabs.  I also have to assume they have a bit more of an idea on how to catch, hold, and kill a capital without large numbers.
---
because it totally wasn't the 1st and 3rd largest nullsec alliance joining together with largest lowsec, and the coalition members of both into one  
---
instead it was 20 blackops bois that did it

Fair nuff

Ah! Look! He accepted proprietary information on the NPE iteration process from Brisc! Clever fuck, we'll never get him at this rate.
---
I had this happen too. I mailed the delivery agent and got no response. I messaged them on reddit and got nothing.
---
Only later on did I get one after talking about it in a thread. Kudos to them making it right, but I did get a little sad when I didn't get a personalizes mail receipt in the first place.
---
I hope someday I can join them, and provide receipts to all my wonderful customers. 
---
I was in a hurry to refit a tengu for explo so i have just slammed in new subsystems and moduls. Before refit there was an x-large ASB in the slot. Honestly... I have no clue. The strange part is, I remember unfiting the ASB and the slot being empty. It seems the modul was gone but the charges stayed.
---
That's a lot of titans. FRT built up some real strength since their last war.

Love the plot twist.

Interesting way of saying didn‚Äôt want it anyways

I stopped playing about 2 years ago now, at the time Fraternity seemed to be just getting going. Are they massive now, did they soak up all the refugees from the chinese server?
---
First win of the year.... nvm

What surprises me is that he did not lose it earlier... Some people are... special. 
---
&gt; which would be a bad idea with prices as high as they are right now
---
you expect them to come crashing back down?
---
Imagine not using your wormhole to descend upon 0.0 space and cut the throat of every nullsec krab you come across (ingame)
---
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about Hedliner. u wouldnt say this shit to him at fanfest, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest nex store clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes in yita. yall cuckmodos are pathetic lol

It's very simple.

but we're shield fit???

How did the komodo get caught

Seriously, one purple, I'm disappointed.  Put all the purple on your toy.

Real answer, been taking a break from eve while i sort some stuff out, dont worry though I'll lose it eventually :)

this is a cool vid, nice to see you guys back and going again

Ok legit

I can respect that

Just LOL!!

What's wrong with ganking?

be a man and trash it

Then logically they're voting for people who did get elected

Raise the rent.
---
Aye , lane was solid until it wasnt. At least we had a komodo to lose you poors.
---
At least that Komodo died in glorious combat guns blazing.
---
Didnt Shrike die at almost the exact same spot?
---
Considering the numbers of dread bombs we've welped lately, I believe that is definitely our currency.
---
7 mil fits, what, do you think we're made of money? Fly something affordable. Great vid though.
---
Very epic short vid! Nice!

Dock up all faction titans.... oh wait

right?? lol

Think the problem is solving itself, pretty garbage amount of karma.

Frat isnt anymore a Chinese only ally

To be able to brag about it, without putting it on the line, obviously.

Still waiting on that out of NDA podcast matterall promised.

Don't fly around with it. Whichever citadel it's in, leave it there.

ends 22nd of march

Thanks for the heads up

The dude killed CCP Larrikn's first Komodo on SISI probably deserve more credits than him.
---
Sadly the footage was lost, but at least that was a fun fight
---
verrry nice
---
cannot wait for 64bit so hopefully we can see these high def video more often
---
Sounds like you have a problem with furries, not C4 corps in general.
---
Someone set up us the bomb
---
The fact it took this long for one to be lost says volumes of the risk adverse nature of some groups in EVE.
---
We should count our blessings that it wasn't lost to AFK ratting or something like that.
---
F man, bad luck
---
In horde, can confirm: we don't care. Loot is a free for all typically, aside from whaling fleets where it's a 50/50 split for FC and scanner. Also some exceptions but they're typically anounced beforehand.
---
The amount of drama and bullshit leadership would have to deal with if loot is supposed to go somewhere would be insane. Of course horde's #1 rule "don't be a dick" applies so when people ask for their own loot back it's pretty much always returned. Dropping MTU's on a battlefield is a no-no though, and FC's will often primary them if seen. Bringing an indie ship instead of a combat ship to loot mid-fight is a no-no as well, also not too uncommon to get primaried.
---
But hostile loot goes to whoever loots it quickest, so congratz you're rich.
---
the very first one was "goon supers eating shit" and they didn't get counterdropped, goons just dropped the shield on the pos all their supers were in and turbo roasted all the dreads
---
Two fitted (Power Diag, Damage Control) and one in cargo (Smart bomb)
---
I was there as well, popped my first big fleet fight cherry in that brawl, happened to be a historical one, GF

Global, tell everyone to dock their faction titans. I dont want them to have an easy win on the killboard
---
Wait a minute, are you actually chest beating that a combined alliance size of INIT. &amp; IM (both keep ratting toons within corps) are not doing that great Vs alliance combined size of NC., PL. &amp; Horde (two of these keep ratting toons out with alliance).
---
Now I'm no sage on these matters but really, INIT on your doorstep fighting the odds and you are complaining that they are not bringing a fight when they bring what, 250 man at most and you guys are bringing triple their numbers and a cap fleet umbrella!? Yeah good chest beating. From all account they are their to give some low fc's combat experience and don't care about the losses....so who is winning then?
---
That's why you *usually* not smugpost before shit is over, but I guess that's a thing nowadays. 
---
Man if there was *ever* a time to use Estamel's Adaptives, a Komodo is probably the place to do it.
---
Pithum A-Types are poorfitting on Komodos.
---
jumping into detorid on a saturday is the more egregious thing
---
jumping into detorid is like jumping into querious or vale, it's close enough to a large supercap fleet that there's really no reason for them not to come. frat are still primarily chinese but on saturdays they, like everyone else, are much more loosely confined to their tz
---
the only reason tapi killed the 2 titans they did is because they got on field first, and the only reason they didn't lose more is because they ran away and left the komodo to die
---
And the entire video is of the thing in tether or DDing friendlies on the undock, did it ever actually do anything notable before it died or did it get dunked during its first actual fight?
---
And so the Reddit wars began it is
---
The problem there is the capital, not the battleship
---
GLOBAL TELL ALL YOUR FACTION TITANS TO DOCK  
---
  
---
Fraternity's been hiding a *LOT* of titans. Holy shit.

Welcome the new big bois on the bloc.

Thankyou for keeping our dumb krabs on their toes.

When I was about 14 I was taking our dogs out for a walk with a friend and we threw their frisbee on top of a building by accident. I climbed up to get it and there were four or five black bin sacks up there so I kicked one off on to my mates head for a laugh, turned out it was full of stolen sports equipment instead of rubbish.
---
Being 14 we imagined we were going to get rich as fuck out of this and took all the loot back to my house but when my mum found out she made us take it to the police station and ruined our early retirement which was bullshit. The next day I went back and scoured the whole area for more treasure and in a small copse next to the field I found 30 bottles of wine and spirits neatly laid out on the ground under some bushes. I ran home and called my friend and he got his dad to drive him over so we could load it all up into his car, his dad let us keep two bottles each, sold the rest to his mates and gave us fifty quid each.
---
That was the 2nd best summer holiday I ever had.
---
Dear diary...
---
How?
---
and shouldn‚Äòt you use atleast some implants while flying something like that? noob question here...
---
low effort facebook garbage post

where the fuck are the mods

Congrats on your haul, hope you get to keep it.

Unblue goons and see how long you last vOv
---
illl buy that tuvan of you mate
---
Guess someone really did get an easy win on the battle report because of fucking faction titans
---
Were you there? Who is talking shit? Maybe chew on some Spodumain and take a few deep breaths.
---
Lol i have seen people bring salvage ships to fleets before. There is a loot log if someone to reprimand you they would. Rules for hoard are loot everything, if it blue deliver back to the pilot(your a bit of a dick if don't especially if its a new pilot). A lot of bashes and fleet dread rat you are asked not to loot but they will tell you this.
---
For a flash ping, not preplanned.... that's kind of insane.
---
Hey friend,no I want there and I dont mine. Thanks for your input.
---
Btw, were you there?

FTFY
---
can u explain [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75482852/)
---
It must be your own shit exploding. 
---
Likely ripped out his implants after the Komodo died.
---
Just wait until the next galaxy pack sale
---
You want ALL the purple on a faction titan though. For the Komodo it would be Estamel adaptive invuls, Estamel BCUs or W-634 DDAs, etc.
---
That really hits hard. I've had so many great moments in FW space fighting over plexes man. I feel like my willingness to continue paying for subs is dying more and more with FW being in the state that its in.
---
I wish INIT would use caps against us but I'm not retarded in that fact of understanding why. We are supposed to be be better than this chest beating shit of what they are doing...or so says leadership :thinking:
---
pretty much same argument for any of us in the north :thinking:
---
Poopandpee #1 AAA 
---
Well, we only started the hole... WAFFLES, you know?
---
It seems a totally different game
---
The only notable things relating to it are the fact it was the first and the fact it got turbodunked the first time it was used in anger. 
---
Are people running skill farms really that dumb? they know the market will bear 900mil+ so why would they let it drop?
---
Can we make this the official way Waffles does AARs?
---
Wait are really that many furries on LH? OwO
---
What? Started a hole? How does that work? I have no idea who you are so how would I know you were in Waffles?
---
Another epic AAR by edible, thank you fam - visual aids always help. I hope y'all are enjoying yourselves.
---
Very cool 
---
That's a fucking callback.
---
Because that's how economics work, skill injectors are directly tied to plex price. And when there is more supply prices tend to go down
---
by losing a sotiyo with a komodo in build - [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9sr9hh/so_about_that_horde_sotiyo_that_died_the_other_day/e8qtmow/?st=jssshtk6&amp;sh=be30574c)
---
a masterpiece
---
It was Shutupandshave with a Black Omega Sec dreadbomb iirc. Not sure who posted the smug tho
---
So what was THE best then?
---
The hole thing.
---
He most likely ripped out his implants as his ship went down, but since there's only one implant that increases Shield HP - compared to the entire Slave set for armor - there's not much point in fitting implants to a Komodo anyway.
---
Thx for the link :)
---
Oh, you mean the WHOLE thing. I thought you meant hole, as in wormhole lol. Please tell me how the whole thing started then (I dont mean this sarcastically, I want to hear your part in it).
---
Nothing is wrong with ganking except they aren't miners...
---
Why not attack shit talkers, it's way better than just talking shit back or blocking them. 
---
ok thx for your help :)
---
I'm too lazy to calculate or zkill it, any ships died?
---
So funny cos it's true
---
Fraternity‚Äôs been botting a lot. Holy shit.
---
Fixed your post.
---
Content is content. It shouldn't matter so much how ISK efficient you are, that only matters if the fight drags on into a real war and ISK supplies actually start to become a factor.
---
He got it for free from his OP so it's 13bil profit.
---
Why would someone running hundreds of skill farms suddenly take huge gargantuan losses because the plex price goes down? 
---
and that's there you're wrong
---
I'm not much of a cynic until given reason to be, so I'd like to think - at least for now - that most of those titans were built or earned legitimately.
---
Its looks like TEST eating shit, not frat xd
---
He almost certainly did have implants and pulled them for zkill stat reasons when he realised it was a lost cause.
---
Not the one i was referring to. 
---
I wouldn't say Winter bots anymore than any other coalition.
---
 Afaik they're actually pretty anti-bot (unlike certain other groups) because they left Serenity over the fact that botting was so rampant, but I could be wrong.
---
They wouldn't. Running said skill farms also gets cheaper with cheaper plex and mptc.
---
Cheaper plex=cheaper injectors. We've seen it many times before
---
Lol.  They overextend.  It is what they do.

We were on a kikimora roam through a wormhole and bubbled a frat nyx. We convod a test dude who had hit us up in local on the way there to see if they wanted to come kill it then frat dropped tons of Titans on it. As our dictor alts who had died keeping the nyx bubbled were burning back in New sabres we found a rag that was gating to the nyx (we assume) and we bubbled it and test came there and dropped on it. Things escalated from there quite heavily.
---
[Meme](https://puu.sh/CUqte/453bba4c28.png)
---
As I said, Waffles took a small Kikimora roam though a wormhole into FRT space. There we tackled a ratting Nyx in 46D- who lit a cyno after we went through his shield to bring in an Apostle. We held tackle while Test &amp; Brave  (having heard about the Nyx from us) formed bombers. This was countered by  FRT Jackdaws / Corms and 20ish FRT Titans, which got bubbled promptly to wait for Test supers to arrive. At this point, we thought our little destroyers had not much further to contribute so we made our way back into 77S- where one of our dictors found a lone gating Rag on a gate and bubbled it ([https://zkillboard.com/kill/75488561/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75488561/)). The super fight shifted quickly from the 46- Nyx (who appears to have survived!) to the Rag in 77S- with Test committing a bunch of Titans, including the unfortunate Komodo.
---
I am sure I missed a few steps along the way but that's a rough overview. So I think it is fair to say, WAFFLES started the party.
---
You just don't get it, *the bots BUILT the titans*. /s
---
fucken lmao
---
To give a long term progression (like levelling up in traditional MMOs).
---
uh what lol
---

There have been no graphics downgrades, are you sure your graphics is set to Quality preset, and all the checkboxes are on?
---
dang....when TEST renters (FEDUP) talk shit about their landlord on reddit!! :0
---
Waffles &lt;3
---
Never heard of him.
---
I gotcha, tha th is an amazing story and I am sorry I didn't add your name to my original post. My post was more geared to shittalking panfam people on this subreddit who are talking trash to Test who had nothing to do with the kill and dock their faction titans. I will edit my post to include waffles with frat.
---
Yeah, all those risk averse cocksuchers who don't self destruct all their ships on the undock!
---
Am I late to the party? I don't see how getting the first Komodo kill means anything other than wiping the floor with fossils.

Imagine being this easily triggered

Says who? Lmao

OOF, you would not say that in Paragon Soul on a Saturday in USTZ Prime good sir

that's the one where they got counterdropped

this is the first time since then that someone has posted it unironically and then also coincidentally eaten shit afterward

Nope. They were guarded by a Gnosis and a Hurrican so  I dropped th bomb and left.

It was a DC kill, don't break your arm jerking yourself off.
---
too much narrative building but you are right. frat co ate 80% of the shit with an isk war comeback at the end.

I don't think it will get cheaper, but it is as well possible. It totally depends on what point of orientation CCP chooses to take. So right now it doesnt make sense to speculate. Just wait for it to be on Sisi

pulling implants after losing a shiny toy is a mark of shame, just like the lack of purple on that komodo, estimals I understand shits hard to get but come on not even officer BCUs.

Talk about getting taken behind the shed...

They have a sizeable EU time zone wing now , attracted a lot of former GOTG corps last year.
---
Is the ship size your only consideration when you select targets? It should be neuts -&gt; remote reppers -&gt; other ewar (like painters, which will allow BSs to hurt you more) -&gt; whatever else. Pure dps should be last unless you're struggling to tank, and if that's the case, you need more dps, more tank, or both.
---
That's a corp name I have not heard of in a long long time
---
The quality preset basically maxes the settings. It goes from this on the Performance setting https://i.imgur.com/AniZR3U.png  
---
to this in Quality https://i.imgur.com/H9WaUkE.png
---
**part 1:** CO2 and TEST had a falling out over diplomatic relations with the DRF, resulting in Legacy ejecting CO2 from the coalition over CO2's desire to seize DRF territory. Meanwhile, Triumvirate had a falling out with the DRF, who were their former overlords, over mistreatment and a desire to attack the Phoenix Federation. It boils down to Legacy, DRF, PFED vs CO2+Tri. Imperium helps the DRF side, PanFam helps the Tri side.
---
In a pivotal turn of events, former DRF mercs Skill Urself turn on the DRF over not being payed, join with Triumvirate and some wormhole bois (Namely Volta) and despite all odds, hold off Legacy, dismantle Pfed and then dismantle the DRF. In the process, CO2 suffers a betrayal from The Judge, their 2iC, who flipped to Goons and got GigX, the alliance leader, banned for threatening to cut off his hands (lmbo). In the end, CO2 dies, Fidelas Constans dies, a large number of DRF alliances die (The DRF remnants went to crash on Legacy's couch tho), with Test and Tri expanding their borders, and Skill Urself becoming the new lords of the East.
---
**Part 2:** Things seemed like they were going to slow down, what with such a large conflict JUST having happened, but sov null basically became a WW1-esque mess, with GOTG, PanFam, Triumvirate, Winter Coalition, and the Holy League (Skill urself, Volta, Some others) on one side and the Imperium and Legacy on the other.
---
I forgot exactly how it happened but the two megablocs ended up going to war due to alliance chains being batphoned in. In the south/Eastern theatre, the various groups peaced out one by one, first Tri, then Skill Urself and finally Winter, putting an end to the 'Eastern Allies', with winter having to deal with a pretty humiliating peace treaty.
---
In the Northern theatre, CO2 somehow resurrected themselves, got shit on, and then Imperium+Legacy ended up steamrolling across the rest of the North until GOTG payed them to stop. Though GOTG bought 6 months of safety for themselves, and only 1 for PanFam, which caused tensions to boil between the two. In the end, the only alliance that actually died iirc was CO2, again.
---
**Currently:** Tri had a lot of brain drain and talent+corps depart for other alliances, Skill Urself went and ate their former partners. Snuff officially "left" the Imperium to go terrorize low sec again, but still have Goons holding their hand. INIT blew up Hard Knock's unassailable WH citadel and then got laughed at for chest beating about it. Also they're hitting the North again. CO2 died a third time, I think. NC and PL aren't scary anymore and have been hemorrhaging power pretty bad. The Russians put aside their differences to make another ethno-nationalist coalition and are assaulting the primarily Chinese Winter Coalition with the help (see: entirely reliant on) of Legacy. 
---
Also there's no more alliance tournament, thanks Obama 
---
I think that sums up the last 2 years, I'm skimming hard though. Good time to come back though, lots of chaos.
---
Wtf game are you playing? Everyone should be talking shit as much as possible or this isn‚Äôt eve. 
---
HAHA EPIC ITS A SHIT MS PAINT PICTURE DRAWN BY A 27 YEAR OLD
---
I got to note, thank god atleast we TEST and Frat dared to drop our faction toys, win or loose and not have those players keep em docked
---
Lets just give the newby a  civilian cloak at this point, and start them off in instanced wormhole space, triglavian tech shows it's possible. Give them a scanner and a drone and he can do the mini quest there. Make it fleet barely holding off a drifter and your ibis is the tipping point. 
---
And if he wants a cyno then he'll have to subscribe.
---
Anoikis btw. 
---
You Need a better bait post
---
What I learned when I played is that country based alliances are usually among the most powerful and motivated. It looks like that hasn't changed. It's also hard to spy on a corp that only speaks a foreign language

So your idea to fix Abyssal Pvp is to remove anything that makes it interesting and make it into wh space..

---
/r/gatekeeping
---
There are mutiplasmids which are items that let you modify the stats on modules, they drop from abyssal sites (very tough PvE). That may be something you want to consider doing.
---
Well they DID deploy against one of the biggest/strongest coalitions in the game so it shouldn't surprise anyone.
---
Through a wormhole. C5 and C6 connections are large enough to fit capitals but not supercaps. 
---
Is it? If you're going to lose them anyway, you might as well put some effort to not make it nice for whoever gets the kill. Just attitude.
---
I haven't ever really seen many TBH. Just the DRF being primarily Russian, and Stainwagon at various times has been Eastern European predominantly.
---
You're right in that they're very motivated though, because if you only speak a certain language and someone comes after your shit, it's about more than just content, but your very right to play in a group.
---
That being said, many alliances have foreign language corps these days, and a lot more people are learning/speaking English, which might account for the relative weakness of the DRF and Winter. I'd rate them as the two weakest blocs right now, actually.
---
I guess you created your account after they blobbed out hard knocks. 
---
It depends on how good your hacking skills are. If you‚Äôre quite good then you can refits your ship for hacking really. If not then the gnosis can run a lot of sites depending on fit and the praxis as well and they are bonuses to hacking. They definitely aren‚Äôt the most efficient ships in my opinion (I would probably use a gila for the lower end sites).
---
Of course they did, return fire. What's this safe-space crap?

Why are potential buyers entitled to backyard sale prices?

It will be interesting to find out if he succeeds in getting it out of deep in hostile null.
---
....awaits killmail.
---
My understanding (I don't play FW, so this is from friends) is that before Citadels owning systems had more importance since you didn't have neutral stations in enemy systems allowing you to reship from losses almost immediately.
---
I mean considering everything else wrong with FW it's low on the list of things to look at.

---
Seeing as i never was in a shield super alliance, what implants are there to help shield Titans against doomsdays?
---
EvE is beautiful on Quality settings, but Just remember, if you get into a situation where there is heavy TiDi, then change your graphics settings back to Performance mode instead of Quality mode.

We simply don't know how highsec votes. We do know for sure however that CSM's voting system is a complete joke when it comes to player representation.
---
May the power of botting be with you.
---
I have a feeling it wouldn't work, as the war deccer will still be activating aggressive modules on the victim the logi corp isn't wardecced to, so if the logi gives the war deccer remote assistance they will still be concorded. Although the logi corp can still agress the war deccers, just not give assistance.
---
Correct me though

It's probably a reflex. No joke, a lot of big groups strongly suggest members do this.
---
Oink Oink
---
Can someone explain the mechanic? How did he get bumped off the gate at 0?
---
Yeah, let me return fire against your blinged up, well tanked, targeted PVP ship, with implants, with my T1 highsec PVE ship. Probably against neutral logi too if there is any chance you might actually lose something. Even if not, the ships you target won't have tackle fitted so if you are in any kind of trouble you can just warp off.
---
Stopping you wardeccing newbie highsec corps doesn't make high sec a safe space - you can still suicide gank them. What it does do though is prevent targeted griefing, and that's a good thing, because players starting out in Eve will expect some of the standard practices of other games, and we don't want to bully them out of the game before they learn what Eve is.
---
Go back to your rorqs, little bee.
---
Didn't spam jump
---
Hopefully CCP's logic is 'have an active wardec *against the target with whom your remote rep target is fighting*' because otherwise that's retarded.
---
Best comment 2019 so far
---
dont make fun of the dead its rude
---
Wasnt there a shield set? Crystal's or smth like that?
---
Obviously there were some FAXes, but TEST brought so few they might as well have brought none 
---
Only in USTZ 
---
And what do you add to the sub or EVE? I mean, apart from your salty buttmad comments in bait threads.
---
At least it's longer than Tapi deployment.
---
what delve? Cheapest I saw was 13.9b on contract. 
---
I asked about it and got told not to do anything to the client or i could get banned.
---
Is the SB really only 2ish?
---
This looks accurate. Bob Ross would be proud
---
May it burn eternally

***Ok thanks for helping me!***

Or those that should never be using them in the first place..
---
Evicting each other just puts you at a weaker position when The South comes knocking at your door.
---
But fair enough in the other points lol.
---
You can only buy extractors with plex man. Get it? Cheaper extractors means injectors can go lower. Why will they go lower? Because people don't care and will undercut by millions so that their goods move faster
---
Anoikis needs to be organized to do that. Lets get a csm
---
By now legacy would have disbanded after test fed it's whole super fleet to 5 battle badgers at that rate of decay,
---
Show me
---
Hey, 
---
there is no such thing as all-purpose-fit. Especially with lvl5s, you will need to swap modules/ships around.
---
In general tho, mixing Extenders with boosters is not a good idea. Extenders are for buffer / passive tank, boosters are for active tank. With combining them you will be doing both, but not well. You want to get rid of those rigs, get capacitor safeguard rigs / anti-em rigs. Also calefaction rig is not a good idea either, you will mostly run into a problem of cruise missiles not applying well to small -fast flying targets, therefore rigors will always be better (or just go full safeguard). Mid extender swap for mission-specific resist. 
---
If you want to go lvl5 with ravens, you want to snipe from distance, and for that you need mid sebos &amp; nav computers (and micro jump drives) 
---
The best advice is: Go to Sisi (Singularity - Test server) die a lot and play around with various builds that will actually work with your SP.
---
TIL I'm triggered
---
Nice one on actually doing the venture vid, and some nice kills there!
---
Why did the sabre pilot stop shooting you? It didn't look like he was shooting the drones, and with AC he might well have won that one. Trying to de-aggress and jump out I guess.
---
Hard to define though
---
&gt;y horde alt getting banne
---
to be fair if your a new bro and they demand it off you i would find a new group.... but thats just me,  you went and took the initiative,  you should be rewarded.... i know my group would demand that off me if i looted it alhough i would try and negotiate but a new bro thats like winning the lottery...
---
real talk Edible is our 3lit3 AAR writer thanks for showing up to help test ‚ô•obv kikis can only do soo much hope we held grid long enough for you to be happy :/

Too bad not enough undocked tho eh? Outformed by China lmao.

Tbh they needed some sort of emotional release after spending a decade seeding rage waiting for the day they would the strength to bring down the countless hordes of wormhole space.

Auto-sticky all those posts tbh :)

Apparently he disconnected

At least theyre allowed to bring out the toys! Big shout out to the dude who had who had the balls to do this! Fuck the ISK war! Let everything burn!
---
I lost my very first capital in this fight. I am honoured to be laid to rest next to the majestic Komodo beast. 
---
by that logic, Test shouldnt be talking about anything where they required Goons to carry them to victory.  which is about everything. they pets.
---
guess that means reddit is quiet.
---
Not so much sad as the new reality.
---
Oh, so just get a little more armor despite being shield tanked?
---
while it is overly complex,  that is a good potential loophole to alert them to.
---
hopefulyl they see this
---
Wie bot oars. Wie mahke titan. Wie damaj test. China numba wun.

Boo
---
It's been a while since I played Eve, dropped in on a whim. Faction titans? Bloody hell. I remember when faction Drakes were new(and that's roughly when I stopped playing). I have a lot of catching up to do...
---
Now that I think about it there were a lot of spanish speakers who played in the corp I was a part of but they also spoke English
---
Oh they use it. But it's just to check if the docking mechanic doesn't break.
---
Sitting at home dreaming of the AT
---
Beautiful screenshot.
---
While I do like and respect Tri way more than the vast majority of alliances in the game - I do agree that trash-talking in local has always been the signature feature of every Tri fleet, gang or corp I had ever met in the game. It's only natural the famed tradition passes onto the new means of trashy communication and e-peen measurements, aka eve-reddit. 
---
It is true, we do mine veldspar in home with gilas....

Yeah. Cause you don't overblob when your krabs are being bamboozled right ?

Banned for what? Using the customization feature that the developer provides you?

Remember when we (test Bros) got told to stop saying kick SUAD... Kick SUAD
---
'ey Arsia does an EU TZ fleet once a month. Check in game channel (CNIOP) for details. 
---
If you join one of the larger null empires they'll have fleets going at ALL hours. Highly recommend you check it out!
---
soon it¬¥ll be about three fiddy
---
The only thing that'll get you skill points is time and the amount of that required isn't going down. 
---
If you want to go for the game time &gt; SP thing it comes right back to my argument about people running hundreds of farms shotgunning themselves in the foot profit wise because once you have spent the plex on game time to farm SP it's value was set at that level and if you now sell the injectors for much less you lose huge amounts of money.
---
It's about 1.8 now
---
How hard is it to make 1.8 these days?
---
&gt;so without paying for monthly fees how can I get my stuff out of null ?
---
Asset safety. It‚Äôll go to the nearest lowsec if that works for you.
---
If you don't mind selling off any skillpoints you train, you could play for, idk 400ish mil a month.
---
It is already safe in Jita.
---
war is a way of deception
---
You guys are the shield fleet.
---
So the only risk averse people who would‚Äôve dropped a Komodo is you guys.
---
You know that right?
---
Awesome. Who do I contract it to and how much?
---
Prices are always run by traders, not farmers. Be it loot or injectors.
---
Not hard but you‚Äôll ruin the game if that is all you try to do. Just pay for the sub with irl money. 
---
Whoa! AMAZING screenie man! 
---
Wow.
---
To fight Chinese botters you could stay home and awox the hundreds of them there.
---
Quite difficult for alphas.
---
Well, we are either in the scenario where he‚Äôs dumb enough to not have implants or try hard enough to strip implants.
---
Very nice!
---
Can you please explain?
---
oof? 
---
Not sure what you ‚Äújust did‚Äù
---
:smart:
---
I played EVE for many years with plex. 
---
Would spend the first week earning isk for my accounts and the remainder of the month was doing other things.
---
But when it started to take more time to plex is when I quit. Would like to get back into the game . I'm downloading the client right now.
---
too poor fitting 07
---
I‚Äôd recommend expiration then. Get an astero and go to Null. You can make a bill or so in a good day 
---
Might work have to see where it puts me. All my stuff is in branch lol.
---
test komodo was best komodo 
---
Downloading client now , taking plex donations 
---
I managed to loot, in my t1 frigate, some expensive loot apparently that I had originally thought was worth an awesome 1.5 billion. I am being told now 30 billion :omg:
---
Not that hard depending on what you do, usually I plex just with loot from PvP. Sometimes exploration too, made ~700m in 4 hours yesterday, but I'll be making some t2 rigs and selling in null for a nice markup, so that'll probably turn into 1b+. Ratting is nice too, afk some sites for a few hours in a VNI or 2, then do the escalations, also usually I get a bil or 2. Where is your nullsec stuff located?
---
Yah I probably need a solid week or more to get back into the swing of things.
---
But how are you supposed to show off that you have a Komodo if you don‚Äôt jump to every cyno that gets lit.
---
You could still Plex an account with a week or so of solid mission running or whatever, bit it's be a grind. Although if you've got all the fancy ships and skills - and the rep - it could be done in an evening by playing it smart (look up HateLess Gaming on Twitch: he's currently running L4 SOE missions, mostly burners, on three accounts, and making billions in hours with it by being choosey about what ones he accepts or declines, so might pick up some "play smarter not harder" tactics there). Although it's still trending up, so without using fancy tactics, it's slowly moving out of the reach of non-null players unless you play like it's your job.
---
You won't be able to move your Omega-locked ships unless you're Omega. Exception being if you were in a citadel that supposed, and you're currently sitting in a Proteus or whatever, you'll log in in that in space, and can fly it but without using any modules/bonuses. Might be better to suck it up and pay the tenner to get first month sorted, then look at isk-for-plex to get the second month onwards sorted. If you're in an NPC station, you'll be fine, and can leave the ships there until you decide whether you're going to go Omega and use them. Although also be aware of who owns that space now, and if they're friendly, as you may find the first gate is bubbled tf and you're not getting anything out anyway. 
---
Use the frost line analyzer 
---
Kick SUAD
---
From somewhere in the forum thread it said that you'll only be able to rep people in your own corp/alliance/factionwar when you have a war against you. Anybody else repping you get erased.
---
You can‚Äôt do this now, repping a war target gives you a suspect timer. I doubt that will change 
---
Hello. 
---
I'd like to point out that the "...." structure you had used is not exactly correct. Ellipsis usually consists of only three consecutive dots, such as "..." to indicate an omission of a word or a sentence within a text. 
---
I would also like to point out the missing dot, aka period at the end of your phrase. I can only assume that that dot somehow migrated to the other three dots, hence the 4 dots structure above. That is indeed the correct number of dots in entire message, but rather oddly placed. 
---
Sincirely yours, 
---
a random stranger that felt like commenting on your punctuation. 
---
Branch I think.  And how about excursions are those dead?
---
There are now skill extractors and injectors now, in you have over 5.5 mil SP, you can extract and sell your skills.
---
Right click &gt; Open Cargo &gt; Drag n Drop &gt; Golf clap
---
Ah, bit too far for me. You can use https://evepraisal.com/ to appraise your stuff and list it on pub contracts for 80-90% jita buy to sell it quicker. No idea about incursions, never done them, I heard you can get ear cancer from the coms.
---
Crystals give bo us to active shield boosters not shield amount. Also they don't work for capital mods.
---
Remember kids, this is what happens after long term exposure to spodumain
---
Just because it happened in an area close to Panfam? Why do goons get to talk shit sbout it then, you‚Äôre allies. Everyone talk shit about something like this, especially since it‚Äôs the forst Komodo kill in the game.
---
Lol, you're the kid who tried to correct one of our guys on rolling and got spanked. ü§£üòÇü§£
---
&gt; Btw, IMO Frat and WAFFLES are the only entities that can imo since they actually put the true assets to kill it.
---
Who are you to tell me whom I can shit talk and whom not
---
well that was a short lived dream. I got two accounts I always play at the same time but can not run two accounts on free  I guess?   Well Not going to pay for subs to try to get back into the game lol. Oh well thanks for the info gents.
---
Unlike some dont report blue groups around
---
what a shitty post
---
Aye, please keep feeding us in the name of having fun
---
no u
---
this is your average goon post.
---
Evacuating from Null:
---
There's Asset Safety, so that's always a (not cheap) option, to get your stuff to the nearest lowsec station. Which may, or may not, already have been triggered for you, if someone unanchored the station your stuff is in.
---
Noraus No.1!!!!!!!!
---
you're a sick son of a gun wally.
---
Nope. Can't expect them to hand everything out for free.
---
And yes. Your being very obvious.
---
And no. It won't change anything. 
---
So, your 'neutral' logi is repping someone who:
---
1. is involved in a war (including normal wars or FW)
---
2. does not share a corp/alliance (or FW side if the war in question is the FW war) with the assistor
---
3. is engaged in PVP (has a capsuleer logoff timer)
---
Take a wild guess what will happen.

"F1 &amp; F2"

**Release 1.0.8**
---
With this release we added the next major part of EVE Workbench, its now possible to share your EVE Online fittings through our Fittings system.
---
You can check it out on our website or by visiting the [page directly](https://www.eveworkbench.com/fitting) 
---
Please let us know what you think of this new feature!
---
keybind them to what though?
---
That would lead to teaming. Gang goes in with load of cheap ships and maybe one flagship to loot, kills every hostile amd suicides cheap shit.
---
Just remove the pve part and it's fine.
---
Awesome tool for organizing and managing your corp in almost every aspect!
---
F11 and F12
---
Wow how unhelpful. 
---
Keep that killboard healthy.
---
good fights all around!
---
To fair I have been on a lot of these fights over the last couple of months and have seen NC. and PL in once and that was for a fort kill, I might have missed them because of all the Goons, Snuff and others coming to help the other side but!!!
---
You can plex an account in about 30-40 minutes on WH space
---
Space Bar for d-scan
---
Not neutral ones, but you can still just change corp the second you need to rep somebody if you want to bait on jita undock or sth
---
Yes, Steve is right, this is 100% confirmed to be the case. You WILL get concorded. 
---
Broadcast for armor &amp; shield. I got it on Ins and Del keys.
---
That was a waffles Komodo in a PL Sotiyo in Horde space. For those that didn't know.
---
ShiFt fOr DScaN so tHat I can DsCan wHile I typE
---
You are forgetting that there are two different people that do skill farming:
---
1. The people that have 100 accounts doing 3 characters per account and that being their income.
---
2. The people that use skill farming to subsidize alts.
---
The second group is the one that will crash the market if plex goes down because they don't care about margins that small.
---
Yeah I've done wh in the past but in so rusty, I'd need a solid month to get the hang of it.
---
Same, lol
---
Not sure who stated whom was "mad" but if your statement is true, you're telling me people feed komodos on purpose so that they can rip  implants from their clone to make people like myself "butthurt" on r/eve? Wow kudos to you m8, let me know when you lose a komodo and rip implants from your clone. I will be sure to give you the same treatment.

Yeah I‚Äôd have to check but basically all those regions go to one system. I have some stuff from there tooo I haven‚Äôt picked up yet. You might be able to black frog it to highsec if needed too.
---
All slots with 1 click overheat + activate 
---
I bind Launch Drones to R since it's unused and Shift+R is the default bind for Recall to Drone Bay.
---
That seems like claiming you have knowledge that we don't have. That's why i'm not comfortable saying that it will for sure crash if there is a large sale.
---
Downloading client now , taking plex donations  Cazador 64 in game
---
A key for drones to engage current target is handy 
---
My most commonly used keyboard are as follows:
---
Lock target - ctrl
---
Broadcast target - ‚ÄúX‚Äù
---
D-scan - ‚ÄúD‚Äù
---
Probe scan - ‚ÄúA‚Äù
---
Increase probe scan range - ‚ÄúW‚Äù
---
Decrease probe scan range - ‚ÄúS‚Äù
---
Radial menu (big favorite of mine) - middle mouse button
---
Fleet radial menu - ‚ÄúZ‚Äù
---
Launch drones - ‚ÄúE‚Äù
---
Drones attack target - ‚ÄúF‚Äù
---
Drones return to bay - ‚ÄúR‚Äù
---
yeah eve university is seeming like the best shout honestly 
---
Thanks :) 
---
That defaults to F
---
Thanks for all the answers. I don't know what most of what is being said means but I'll find out. 
---
Oh yeah, haven‚Äôt done my keybinds in a while forgot it has a already had a good default :P
---
Yeah I really only add the R to launch myself cause the rest of the drone keybinds already use either F or R with either shift or ctrl.
---
Launch drones. Return drones. I use my back and forward mouse buttons. Life saver. 
---
I don't understand how this was an interesting fight...it was a clean sweep win with no chance of something interesting happening. The numbers looked completely nuts in favor of the one side, and destroying one Titan in a battle of so many isn't a meaningful accomplishment. It just shows that one guy was actually committed to fighting, unlike the aura of Eve where noone/no big corp is willing to sacrifice anything meaningful.
---
But that's an outsider/newbie perspective.
---
it asks for a lot of stuff thats not mining like:
---
 Allows updating the character's mail labels and unread status. Also allows deleting of the character's mail. 
---
no, it's not. we have several.
---
agreed
---
i have been saying this for years, delete wormholes and half the issues will be solved
---
same tbh
---
I wouldn't want to spoil Episode 2 of The Debriefing, but good thought process ;)
---
Whos been charged for losing something in horde renter space? I don't remember doing that

People also generally need to ask for help too right? Like that's a thing people do when they need help?

People under appreciate PI these days. I fund a lot just from 5-10 mins a day using this. It won't get you PLEX, unless you're running multiple accounts, but it'll give you some fun cash.

Only if their at war with someone

So... This is a thread about nothing?

I pull implants in every ship that‚Äôs a sure loss because of the exact reason you‚Äôre posting lmao

I love this set up, I‚Äôm stealing that..

Because you force them to deagress and dock right?
---
Dumb question but is there an in-game insurance payout for titans? Also would his alliance reimburse him at all?

 I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
Hacking and Arch are both at 5 scanning skills are mostly 4 with the exception of Astrometrics which is 5
---
CJ is not komodo please ignore, is it the star fraction guy?
---
Skills exist as a progression for you and a way to customize your pilot. You can fine tune exactly what you want to fly and how. You don't need to listen to what others tell you. Skill up your pilot however your want. That's the point. I have yet to be kick out of a fleet because of what I was flying I may have had to adapt with the fleet but if I wanted to be in the fleet I took the risks.

Its free! Come join us!
---
I have Launch Drones on Shift+F because it's quick to go Shift+F -&gt; F to launch drones and send them to attack.
---
If you have never put your titan on grid then yes, you dont understand. You get a rush even if its a  dunk like this, or your first dd cherry, anything. And not to mention the rush when youre not sure if youre gonna make it out..
---
did the neutral logi have their safety turned on?
---
the funny part is one estamels adaptive likely costs as much as a whole komodo these days (komodos certainly drop more) 
---
Why the frostline? Getting into explo myself and I just use an MD to refit. Though thinking of losing that too since all I ever really go for are relic sites anyways. 
---
Spodbrains
---
All I can say is... I was there. 
---
For the fall of Bob
---
For atlas taking c-j from red alliance.
---
For ITs vengeance and reclamation of delve
---
The fall of the northern coalition (the real one)
---
AAA taking on and crushing the DRF (the original)
---
There are *subsidies*!!
---
There is an in game insurance. It‚Äôs crap and no one insures Titans. For the second part it depends on the alliance but I doubt any alliance is going to SRP faction titans at 100%.
---
It does both data and relic. Has stronger power and everything. Makes life easy 
---
Nice catch Bro.
---
they can sell their current month of SP for less profit and keep farming, or they can shut down for a month until the price rebounds
---
which one do you think makes more money?
---
And what if you added some way to produce the ships and items out of natural resources that you had to extract, and those stations could be used to not only store but produce stuff? 
---
I can't stand you. Splitting off one of your guns to whore. Not anchoring because you want to catch some cinematic footage. This operation was important. This must've been what Steadyo was yelling about in comms.
---
This indeed, and i think it's relatively cheap; got at least 50 of them as drops while running the event with 1 char
---
If test is shit and frat is eating them, are they still eating shit?
---
What's that?
---
It‚Äôs a new relic/data anazlyser 
---
You keep spamming this across threads. Why. It‚Äôs super cringey especially in this situation. 
---
Big. Think. 
---
That thing melted so much faster than I thought.
---
r/combinedgifs
---
So did we win the Isk war?!?
---
Is there any work around to this one box limit? Is it IP restricted or what? Could I use my laptop for the 2nd account?  Any programs that could work?
---
Yeah, any ship would likely be good enough then since you can run t2 analyzers so I would suggest doing some research on what people use and find a ship you like.
---
please be sure to send me kill mails and vids, I'm sure people will love to see your implant ripping content! &lt;3
---
Looks like a good time to invest in some Titan BPOs lol

every time you post every single goon on reddit posts on your thread

There is a general rule of "Don't loot during a fight". BUT, this particular situation is a little different than most. 
---
The 20+ billion that the damage control is worth is practically a strategic asset. It's worth a super-carrier, and it might have been grabbed by someone hostile to Horde.
---
More proof that super proliferation has ruined the game
---
Not if the logi is at war with the person it‚Äôs repping
---
It's against the terms of service and you could get banned
---
no
---
REEEEEEE
---
Let the fun begin OwO
---
We do not hate on poorly drawn but simultaneously great ms paints in Goons.  We celebrate them.
---
why would your horde alt get banned
---
they only have 40k imperium allies and 25k legacy allies, they need to be on their toes to fight against the 25k panfam megablob
---
You still get SP if you aren't selling the injectors. And if plex prices are dropping then keeping it going without selling them gets a lot cheaper so you could stand to make a lot more once they come back up if you have the capital to keep it running for that time.
---
makes you wonder how many were botted 
---
Actually...it almost seems like TEST may have shifted.
---
USTZ seems less active and less populated nowadays.
---
I don't know when/why it happened but it feels like US isn't the prime TZ anymore.
---
got a btr?
---
&gt; how to punch way above our weight
---
Unfortunately there are only two groups that are above our weight...
---
When I die in my super I am definitely leaving my implants in, at least people will be able to see I was flying a proper clone when I get caught and eat shit.
---
Did you test with a new account?
---
Last time I started a new Char on an old account, the new (then) didn't show. Made a new account and it was different
---
These are becoming super rare to find, nice job!
---
The only goons who list supers for sale on in-game contracts not directly to the seller are idiots who don‚Äôt understand how we sell supers. GSF has a super selling sub-forum that only goons can see which is where all the sales are advertised and agreed upon before they get contracted to the buyer in-game. You cannot look at public contracts in Delve and assume what you see is the going price. 
---
Sell your Hel for what you can get ...11-12b and come to Delve and rebuy it for basically the same price. 
---
So you have been to hawks sov and found hawks bots? Provide proof and I'll not only kick the people but give you a reward.

Nope, I would have assumed new default settings would be present in a new profile rather than a new account. 
---
CCP logic strikes again, I guess. 
---
Make it so

The very first thing he did was shoot at pods, something they were explicitly told not to do. 10/10 horde line member.
---
i felt the burn through the interwebs all the way here
---
I sold 3 titans and 1 super today. What's your point?
---
One of the main reasons for the small ships is exactly and precisely because people that were flying better ships withdrew due to cap bullshit. The times I did FW was with one of those groups. And this was not the only group, as you yourself pointed out, the rest of them almost all either quit FW or the game entirely, again, exactly and precisely due to getting sick and tired of cap bullshit.
---
Where is country roads?
---
You can play for free as an omega if you sell your sp. If you already have all the skills you want or would use this is an effective way to enjoy eve and keep all the money you make and not spend any. Just remap, get +5s and keep training a 30 day skill, uninjecting it and trading the injectors for plex at the end of every month.
---
[Fuck that Rev](https://youtu.be/0c5vkbwU8cI?t=153)
---
Stating that "Highsec doesn't vote" is just plain ignorant, especially if you take into account that the majority of Eve plays there.
---
And I really don't need to have to explain to you that CSM does an extremely poor job of player representation. And yes, this is bad because no one is taking it seriously.

oof, I didnt anticipate this. Here is a copy that should work or download it:

Grats man!
---
What is this radial menu you speak of??
---
Bought my hull for 11.4 bil. Look at the the build corps for better pricing. Don't use market or contracts. Direct order that shit.
---
are you guys recruiting?
---
Probably quite a bit.
---
We are open to the right people haha
---
Why dont you like furrys?
---
The combined data/relic analysers get strength bonuses from both data and relic skills. I get a strength of 36 from it, and only 30 from a Data Analyser I.
---
They're about 70 mil.
---
Was it all profit as you mined it yourself?
---
bloody hell, word salad
---
A little add concerning PI : if I remember well, wormholes have the same planets as highsec, and it‚Äôs not depending of the class. A bit like moons.
---
that's not for a lack of trying however
---
I think that "Don't be a dick" should be a rule in general.  Ganks are a part of the game, and as long as you're a good sport about it and remember that *this is all a game* then good jol's will be had.
---
I recomend you join signal cartel if you like exploration
---
"How to lose 1 mil bomb on 100k drones"
---
check your komodo test's!
---
Actually, wormhole planets are about the same quality as nullsec but with less people using them usually. The downside is that you are limited to those in your system
---
Dont fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Try everything at least once, dont just focus on one thing if you havent tried the others. 
---
Theres loads of content out there, but you just have to look theres little handholding. Some players find parts of the game they didn't know existed or hadn't tried  after years.
---
Join  newbro chat channels, they'll help you out. 
---
Try and join a decent corp if you can. 
---
Eve Uni is fantastic, its at least worth joining their chat channel to ask any questions. 
---
Other than that, just go out and have fun. Try not to be afraid of losing stuff. It'll happen and the threat of losing stuff is a part of what makes the game great. 
---
1. Find a corp that is a community and you can stand being around all the time. 
---
2. Find an isk income that‚Äôs fun. 
---
3. Blow up ships and be blown up. 
---
You described skill injectors. If you have billions of isk you can literally, directly trade it for skillpoints.
---
Have you tried faction warfare space? It's focused around acceleration gates that only allow certain ship sizes into the arena, and it's really easy to dscan and see what you'll be up against before jumping in
---
This is my personal opinion but don‚Äôt join one of the biggest corporation/alliances. Medium sized one might be perfect for you too, it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt feel you‚Äôre in an alliance it feels more like a NPC faction and sometimes even your messages/questions get buried under the spam..
---
Thank you for the time you took to write the above. Since engrish is not an actual language, I didn't afford it the capitalisation. Secondly the 4 dots I used was for dramatic pause, rather than suggesting a missing word or sentence. And lastly you are quite correct that I missed my full stop. My bad.
---
Kind regards,
---
Mr Pod. 
---
I always read people spend 15 min a day on this, but is it worth it if you can only spend 30 min every week? 
---
what, I do not think you get strength bonuses from skills, you have +10 because you probably have it fit on an exploration frigate.
---
Flying spaceships isn't the focal point of this game, it's about the people you fly with.
---
Treat High Security space like you would treat a trade hub in other videogames. It's great to buy stuff and acquire things, but the meat of the sandwich is in Low Security space, Null Security space and Wormhole Space.
---
I put my drones on F keys
---
F9 engage
---
F10 return orbit
---
F11 return bay 
---
F13 launch
---
No, with only one char you would loose about 100m worth of skillpoints each month, with 3 (a full account) Your total skill point pool would still go down a bit each month.
---
Flying around all the time in +5s isn't viable
---
This
---
i dont know why you got so much downvotes it the truth....
---
Sounds like it would work.
---
Wardec the DPS corp with the Logi Corp. No concordokken.
---
Wardec the target with the DPS Corp. Target corp cant shoot the Logi corp and Logi wouldn't be breaking any wardec rules. Just looks like 2 corps at war with the wardec corp.
---
Unless they're is some rule implemented where you cant give reps to war targets... RIP troll logi and F spider tank accidentally repping reds
---
That would be both combined unless someone jumps more that 5 such carriers.
---
They have been alerted to this.      
---
It depends how CCP codes the logic and until I can physically check it I have no idea if this works or not.   I am hoping that does not actually work, but if it does then the war deckers will not be the only ones using it.
---
Isn‚Äôt it kind of inevitable? I totally agree with you but people will always be accumulating more stuff, and eve is like 18 years old
---
Yeah, I guess the SSO access (or just some type of manual export, if possible?) to private citadel data would be awesome!
---
even before tri came to pb snuff were coming to help oldschool, at that time nc. was being a pain in the ass third partying. Can't speak of the tri nc.pl relations however, but the appearance of snuff was hardly a reaction to it.
---
And If 'neutral logi' is at war with the DPS corp? It's no longer neutral logi. But red logi.
---
So if they still get concordokkened, what happens to someone who in the heat of the moment accidentally puts rep drones, or reps on an enemy in a real war?
---
What happens if someone sets the fleet up wrong or puts the link in local instead of Corp and a booster joins? 
---
RIP misclicks
---

There‚Äôs a brief look at some of it. Very handy to use if you can get the hang of it. Can be much easier to use than the right-click menu for some functions
---
Oh yeah I'm thinking of the total coherence, not the strength. But I think it gets the +10 from the ship twice or something.
---
Show me where the bad thread touched you inappropriately. 
---
You can just analyze wallet logs since corp gets taxes. 69 ticks a day - clearly a very dedicated ratter.
---
I mean it's either that or 2bil. Pirate implants give +4 and you'll lose a bit more isk, but also again 100-200mil a month is like one hour of noob tier Pve. 
---
imposter
---
If you have an extraction setup that can run for 7 days then sure. P2-P4 Factory setups can be attended quite rarely if you have the storage facilities.

Would have been a refreshing and welcoming change to see INIT post this themselves.
---
r/4PanelCringe
---
Links wont work (assuming HS) and logi will be trolled relentlessly for having incorrect safety settings?
---
I don't think this will work, so I will give an example.    
---
1.   A and B are at war. Player A shoots  Player B. Player C reps player A and gets concorded because they are not involved in a war with corp B.  
---
2.   A and B are at war, this time player C is at war with player A, now C can shoot A but are not at war with B, which means if they give remote assistance to A, it still falls under the same situation as example 1 and they get concorded. Because corp C is not involved with corp B.
---
Yeah I know thats a horrific explanation but I think it holds true.
---
‚ÄúWe won the isk war‚Äù
---
Let the bidding commence.
---
Local idiots mighty TRItards can't defeat for the last few months... Pathetic at least

Just sounds like a good way to make legitimate wars more trollable

When I was new I came to this reddit looking for info as well. I saved these two threads, and looked back on them often:

---
You‚Äôll also want to familiarize yourself with the EVE-University site, as most of the info you‚Äôll ever need is in there. If you want to be able to ask questions in-game, E-Uni has a channel that is way more useful than the default Rookies one. 
---
Joining an active corporation, once you‚Äôre on your feet, is one of the best ways to get better. Having real people to talk to about the game makes it easy to absorb information and use it. Also, for 95% of players, EVE is only fun with friends. 
---
I hope this helps! 
---
This might have been worth posting if you could figure out how to navigate a keyboard, friend.

Today I re-learned there is often more to item comparisons in the compare tool than just looking at stats. PyFa also has a (somewhat less accurate) display of the modules when I fitted them there as well. Now all I need to decide is if I can live with 1 or 2 utility slots. I think I can easily go down to 2. But 1? Hmm \*ponders\*

Hey there, so I'm a new player, and I was looking for a corporation for new players and joined one today. I join their discord, and then they ask me to authenticate myself. A bot sends me a message, linking me to a login page for eveonline, and it asks me to login to my account to authenticate myself. Is this safe? I don't understand why I would have to login to my account just to authenticate myself for a corporation. What does this actually do?

---
Ask around for a new overview. Jita is the place to buy stuff. Don't get caught up in watching your wallet flash. Make friends and have fun, it's really all about relationships and enjoying your time in game. Faction Warfare is a great place to practice mostly consenual PVP. Delve is a great place to mine, idk how safe the T-Rex space is.

Don't spread your skills while training. You can make multiple free Alpha accounts, use them, each for different purpose. Make 1 for PvE, 1 for PvP, seperate them, decide to fully train into a single ship and stick with it, avoid that being battleship for start. make sure you are training at least 2 accounts, each with different weapon and tank types for whatever is their respective main starter faction.
---
So it's completely safe?
---
I used to plex accounts in wh space using 3 accounts but plex was around 900 mil then and I've sold one of the accounts.

This is called an API check and is standard practice for every good corporation to require one. It allows them with read access to your character history and is used as a basis for establishing trust. They will have be able to query your wallet journal, transaction history, EVEMail history. Only in-game data is available with no personally identifying account information.
---
I realize that. But doesnt stop people from doing it.

Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted. I hunt through Detorid regularly and the amount of VNI bots is absurd. There are systems where you‚Äôll find 8 or 9 characters with very similar but gibberish names that all pull drones at exactly the same time. I‚Äôve caught a few by figuring out their timers but a lot of them will just warp to a different site every time you leave system so you‚Äôll never catch them either way.

that's a lot of capital you're talking about. and if you're going to do all that work of market analysis &amp; timing, plus have all that capital, why aren't you just being a trader instead? screw the farming part.

There are plenty of ships that can handle L4s. L5s are a different story. Below you will find 2 fits. The Gila is best overall L4 runner. It slows down a bit on the big missions **if** you do full clears but excels at blitzing and small and medium missions, and the vast majority of missions you get from your agents, will be medium, not the large ones. So it is most efficient overall time wise. It can also handle otehr content very well such as Abyss, DED sites etc. It has omni tank and all damage types available, meaning it does not require rat specific refits for hardeners, ammo / weapons etc. 1 ship that can handle a hell of a lot of content. The Gila will not be ableto solo epic arcs, or do L5s. Note that this is with mostly level 5 skills and omega, no alpha, only some level 4s such as specializations.

Second ship is a Scorpion Navy Issue. This handles L4s very well, including the missions that are above L4 in difficulty such as epic arcs. You can solo all epic arcs in it but it does require advanced game and mechanics knowledge to do so as there are a few missions within each arc that get tough and if you make too many mistakes, you will lose your ship. The Navy Scorp is a battleship, thus it can access less content then the Gila which is a cruiser. It is also omni tank and does not require mission specific refits other then switching ammo. Note it even carries some auto missiles, this is for the times when there are a lot of EWAR rats present, it can thin them out with relative ease until the EWAR becomes managable for normal ammo types. It can take out elite frigates very easily even at point blank using precision ammo, or go high DPS up to 134km. In this ship, it is critical to know when to use which ammo type. Note that all this is mostly with level 5 skills, and omega only some level 4s such as specializations. No alpha. You can switch out the damage control for a 2nd DCU or Missile Enhancer or whatever else, but then you will not be able to handle epic arcs, which is the main focus of this fit. This ship/fit is not made for most time efficient, isk generation, although it does the big full clears very well and very fast, but rather to be able to solo some really tough content while still retaining decent DPS and omni tank thus avoiding refits between missions.

For L5s you will need very specific set up. It is fairly complicated and requires investment into everything. Ships, training time, multiple omega accounts recommended, etc. Go check the official forums PvE section for details, there is a lot of info posted there.
---
Also, be aware, CCP is removing L4s and L5s from alphas relatively soon within the next game update or 2. So if this is what you want to do, you will need an omega account.
---
enjoy the fact that ur royal overlords are a frail old woman and a tiny baby

No it's not. INIT is just another trash null alliance bitching about the exact same thing they are doing themselves.

Thanks man, i appreciate that.

Its everyone's job if you care about the health of the game. Its a shame some alliances have only started policing this more internally once CCP started neg walleting the tax/rent isk earned by botters.

In high class space, 10 minutes a site using two characters. You're limited by site respawn unlike in Null, but if you get somewhat decent respawns then it's a lot of ISK.

I can't speak for low class space income or only using 1 toon though

Not really sure why it matters, CCP has utterly failed the last 5 NPE interations, the last few have been even worse than the previous ones somehow, and that's a feat.

Its been massively sped up by Rorquals and skill injectors. Training into a titan used to take a year or two, now it just takes a pile of isk that's fairly trivial to earn with multiple Rorquals. 
---
Spanked? Wut?
---
I was and remain correct. I'm sorry that you didn't realize a change years ago affected things. Ask any pvp corp who lives in a 5-5 and they'll give you the same answer.
---
Maybe the distinction is pvp corp, could explain why you're flying on information that's been put of date since the fax update 
---
You can see what happens in a C4 wr. The ridges are removed 
---
ok i got in :) Im trying to use this tool as a person and not as a corp, can i see my bounties / mining somewhere?
---
no jelly pls
---
&gt; I think the people who do farms are mostly looking for easy steady income to keep themselves subbed,
---
Maybe, i don't know this that's why i'm skeptical the price will drop out.
---
its a faction titan pilot, if he wanted to be useful he would instead spend that money boxing multiple regular titans. This is probably just some turbokrab who got his komodo to be feel special
---
fc what do praxis is growing 
---
Pod explodes -&gt; Re ship to rorqual 
---
Someone fill me in... why should we care about this loss?
---
False, this isnt the case now with suspect logi either. RvB are at war with each other and cant RR outside of corp
---
There‚Äôs a lot of different methods, but pretty much all of them are grinding in one way or another. My recommendation for a new player who likes more of a sense of adventure is exploration, as it can be very lucrative even with very few skills.  If all you want to do is make a lot of money then the go to money making activities are mining, ratting, and hauling in null sec, with the less common market tycoons and Jita isk scammers. The key is finding something you can do to make money that doesn‚Äôt make you want to claw your eyes out from boredom. 
---
A Komodo BPC just sold on the eve-o forums for 350b like two weeks ago.
---
Reactions in null sec 7 day cycles 10-20 pilots, bobs your uncle fannys your aunt your loaded in a few months. 
---
Fill me in why a 1v7 with a kill counts as dying to "hisec rats" (which afaik aren't rats but a weaker version of concord)
---
I think someone has a boner for tikk tokk
---
Yes and we whored on every single one of those kills + felt great about it!   UALX propaganda memes, poping 1337 pvp players on log in, while munching popcorn and sperging in Local - best times in EVE ever !!!   Will do it again anytime :)
---
Play market pvp, the grind in that is not so bad as long as you find the right item/region to sell at.
---
titans are so large that landing from warp in jump range of a gate also puts you in bump range of the gate and tends to launch you away from the gate at several thousand m/s
---
so what you do is select the gate and spam click jump while exiting warp, and hopefully your jump command goes through before the server decides you've exited warp and should bump
---
Cause dropping a weitu requires zero effort 
---
Stop spamming this shit
---
Well I believe she fits the first category!!
---
Just re-invest your isk in more isk-making ventures and you'll easily be rich in no time.
---
Get a vexor, start ratting-&gt; get a vni keep ratting-&gt; get a rattlesnake-&gt;keep going-&gt; buy a t1 barge and take a week to train into barge skills and mine any corp moons that are public.
---
Then you can make a new alt account and start the same progression but stop at vnis and just scale from there, eventually you can train into a carrier/super or a rorq on your alts.
---
&gt;hey reddit we're totally not salty because a couple dudes in tapi said at least we get to use our faction titans unlike ncdot hahaha we're not embarrassed or upset or anything about farmstink being farmstink and feeding world first komodo
---
Okay.
---
Well you've raged at me for suggesting both. *I* think that, speaking generally and painting with a very broad brush because there are always plenty of exceptions to any rule in a large population, that on the whole, hi-sec players don't give a fuck; they just play the game as it is and they're not really invested in yellling about changing this or reworking that.
---
And that's OK. It's just a damb game, there's no rule or moral imperative to give a fuck - plenty of nullseccers don't either. But complaining that people who don't express an opinion don't get heard is practically a tautology. If there *were* things that engaged, active and organised hiseccers cared about, then we'd hear about them. I'm aware that absence of evidence isn't proof of absence, but they do correlate pretty well as a rule.

If I had that much RL money I would just sell plex at these prices üòä
---
Didn't include my rage, reeee.
---
Extracted 2 characters that were at 50ish million sp to get my first 30 or so billion isk. Since then I have spent my time buying cheap supers and reselling them at higher prices to people in my alliance.

Steal other people's isk

It's a legit fit ok. Just very niche and gay. Pm me if you'd like to know more

---
Sorry, newb question but, I don't see any tanking modules on the screen. Does he not have any?
---
Do you get super tanky mining drones?
---
This is awesome :)
---
Perfrctly smooth brains
---
Might be buffer tanked and not showing passive modules.
---
And what's your point exactly ?
---
Wow worth a Reddit post ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Would it make sense to set the destination system as waypoint and turn on your auto pilot after entering warp? That way the system would initiate the jump the moment one lands.
---
(psst link the website)
---
Eve Survival is a website that details pretty much every mission, including how much of what asteroids are present. That will help you decide if it's worth mining.
---
The asteroids will remain in place until you hand in the mission. So you may lose out on time bonuses if you delay handing in. 
---
that doesn't matter, the Logi will be repping a person who IS a war with someone the logi is NOT at war with, and under the new conditions that should trigger concord.
---
(whoops :D added it, thanks a lot!) 
---
Thanks for the reply, perhaps its one of the best structured posts but forgot the URL ;). 
---
Too risk averse to drop a shield titan in an armor fleet smh.
---
if by legitimate you mean trying to use nuet logi then yes it will make hat hard.
---
I think you meant a lot of "elite" groups suggest this.
---
How dare you assume we drop faxes to save renters
---
Frig size booster on a cruiser sounds like a strong tank addition.
---
He has no tank.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Do i see a potential way to counter new wardec changes correctly ?  
---
&gt;Step 1 put your logistics and boosters to one corporation (or many to block someone from countering this)  
---
Step 2 declare wardec to this corporation from main higsec wardec corporation  
---
Step 3 make wardec(s) mutual  
---
&gt;You have active wardec so you can rep or boost mains in the wardec corp - but as no one have else this corp (or corporations) wardeced no one else can touch your logistics and boosters.
---
It ought not to let you do that, but ...
---
Test it once its on an available test server to make sure. If you make a post here what and when you want to test I'm sure you'll get some people interested and join you, can make a 2nd post on Eve boards too for it. Although I do not know about test server PvP rules and wardec mechanics testing .... Hmmm ...
---
Good one
---
that page is worse than battleclinic
---
If you're running an instablap Nado, odds are you have it fit out fully for damage and *maybe* some passive tank but that's it.
---
NDAs for volunteer work are a complete joke anyway. At worst if you breach it you will only ever be liable for the extent of the advantages you‚Äôve got from contracting it (so like one trip to Island lol)
---
Its the most cap efficient booster in the game. It gives most HP/s per cap use. And it works great. You get about 90 HP/s of off it while remaining perfectly cap stable, never run out. Then add what little HP/s you get off of passive. For Abyss T4s you only need the 90 to fully farm. T5s 140-150 which you get with eitehr implants and standard blue pill, or whatever implant booster combo you wanna use. This is basically a downgraded (for price) T5 Abyss fit. Which is proven again and again and again.
---
Incidentally, you only need around 70 HP/s for L4s at max, due to speed / sig.
---
So thanks for the post, your input on a proven and extremely effective fit.
---
Yeah i'm sure he's super happy to have been abandoned by the other titans because they would have kept feeding because they didnt have enough faxes
---
I was guessing cap booster since he has that inventory window open called "Medium Standard...." which wouldn't be an Ancillary anything.
---
I get mad when I start a new mmo and I can't get an instant max level toon.
---
SO IMPORTANT
---
jesus christ that site sucks ass on mobile
---
how can you have a website in 2019 and not have a mobile friendly version or whatever
---
I'm guessing running a build like that is extremely susceptible to ganks, and that's why he was so afraid of the Jaguar?
---
No
---
I will told it to owner, maybe he will fix that.
---
I agree. For me, skill farming is just something I do on my specifically trained alts, like my haulers and such, to pay for the sub cost. If it makes a profit over that, great, if not, it's still doing what I want it to.

Oh yes that's a glass cannon. No scram, no web, no tank. Basically you take your shot and bail. Tracking is awful too, I've killed fits like that twice in a propless Thrasher.
---
Are you bragging about killing renters? lmao
---
Awww ye good stuff.
---
I like the time line feature.
---
Was a really fun fight, struggled to keep up with target caller
---
Yup. For the mids you'll have prop mods and sebos and that's it.
---
Question I have..... how many doomsdays did she tank?

Shit happens. Today I forgot that combat ceptors are no longer nullified and warped right into a bubble. 1.3b deleted.

I'll never understand why they didn't follow us to Delve.

a while since I used medium drones, confused vespas with hornets

Lol horde alt getting banned
---
"hard work"

uh huh
---
This isn‚Äôt what that sub is...
---
Do combat Heron next
---
I don't think that's true, the change is to prevent neutral logi. It doesn't say anything about preventing red logi.
---
:ok_hand::skin-tone-6: 
---
our deployment was for 3 months...
---
Can you explain more? Like farm boy accounts or what?
---
Passive mods are shown on screen. Looks like oversized MWD and little tank

I didn't really design it for that, but its an interesting thought.

When I played regularly, I loved watching Bjorn's vids and streams. The guy does a great job of keeping things light hearted and fun for the most part. I wish I had as much as he did PvPing.
---
Unless you are trading at the D-P keepstar where there‚Äôs a really autistic guy that updates his orders every 10 min ;-;
---
Trading dude if you are reading this mad props for the dedication
---
ok so group A wardecs group B. Group B has also wardeced group C. In this picture as group C is concerned group A is neutral. And the changes specifically state if you rep a target, that is wardecd against a group that you the repper are not then you get the concord. So if group A logi reps group B fighter while  group B fighter shoots group C fighter and group A has not wardeced group C then A should get concorded.
---
This is space orgams
---
nice dscan on the second picture
---
Med cont has nothing to do with cap booster or ancil shield booster. But yes he has a capbooster. 
---
And what are you bragging about other than shit ? When you pretend that we only kill krabs and I like you the BR of a fight with multiple Dreads, Carriers and Titans, you tell me "you bragging about killing renters ? lmao". 
---
What do you think ? That these ships were all PvE fit and came out of an anom to feed one after the other ? No spodbrain, they were PvP fit, not like your pseudo alliance (I guess you are from INIT since you are bitching about that) who pretends deploying but only drops VNIs and brags about an unfair response, cause everybody knows then you tackle an Imperium crab you don't get straight dropped to hell by 30 Titans right ? 
---
Oh wow the timeline feature, I‚Äôm gonna use this site from now on ty mate
---
yeah but i still wake up tho so its cool right
---
It depends.  If you're volunteering to be on the CSM you are likely quite invested in the game, and NDA breach means all your accounts go bye bye.
---
Yeah that happened to me too
---
You're in a Gila why are you using light drones and not mediums?
---
That's what you did wrong. A ship with 500% bonus to Medium Combat Drone damage and hitpoints should be using medium drones.
---
Fair point
---
Right, but that's not what you wrote.  
---
Glad you cleared this up in the end.
---
There is only 1 shield HP implant. Easy to pull. 
---
Holy powergrid needs, Batman!
---
Start a Matrix style skillgoo farm.
---
Interesting use of "we're".
---
It was 5 years for CSM8
---
Not a trillionaire, but my story is probably similar to a lot of the wealthy.
---
I was building integrated and augmented mining drones as my main form of isk, as well as trading and building all faction things. I had some suppliers for bpcs, that would deliver 2-10 billion worth of augmented drone bpcs to me regularly. For this reason, i always had a big stock of the parts for these drones, 1-3 bil worth.
---
I decided to stop playing for a few months, had about 20-30 billion cash. I then saw how the price of plex had increased so much, and kept hitting myself for not investing in plex before i left, i could have gotten like 50% return on that. So i put off going back to the game until one day a friend needed some isk, so i said i'd plex my account to log in and plex his.........
---
Excavator drones had been released.....
---
Suddenly, pretty much overnight, my 2-3 bil worth of parts was worth 100+ billion isk, along with the fact i already had all the skills and parts to build excavator drones for massive profit, since they had just been released and everyone wanted them. (i still build them, and sell the bpcs in bulk these days :D )
---
So basically, i was grinding with my trading, and doing quite well at it, but pure luck on an investment i happened to have, got me from 50ish bil total assets to 250+ within a few months of playtime. 
---
I know of many similar stories talking to other "rich" people, either though thought out investments, or pure luck, that a CCP patch or new item etc meant unbelievable profits for them, pretty much overnight. 
---

Use medium drones with a Gila. Also use the correct drones for the damage type. Use an mtu to gather the loot to save time running around. Also I‚Äôd drop one extender and add a second invul. Finally learn on t1 and t2 before progressing on to harder sites.
---
Nope he ain‚Äôt HR and Diplos we both checked him.
---
He is just really really dedicated
---
Hi Toni 
---
Oooh this is great...
---
Some additional wishlists ü§™üòõ
---
- enable also the fitting items to be priced not just hull.
---
- enable cargo aswell. EFT has a habit of omitting  items etc so ability to add more into the cargo post eft paste
---
- bonus. Enable fit variations .. a titan for example has multiple fit configurations based on battle types but for those who are buying fits often will want to buy their entire shopping list as a check list ...although they are individual ‚Äúfits‚Äù they do belong to the one hull.
---
10/10 aar plz keep posting
---
Yes because clearly he's only talking about the komodo and not vanqs or moloks. 
---
Finally a service that will connect neckbeards with vagbeards
---
Hey i can see myself!
---
autopilot still waits for you to resolve as landed and exited warp before attempting to jump
---
because enough people tend to want to sell faster rather than slower, so prices slowly creep down to a minimum that they can take and then it just stays forever 0.01 isk'd
---
What?
---
This is the first Komodo death.
---
That‚Äôs what this conversation is about. So yes, he‚Äôs fucking talking about just Komodos.
---
If you want to change the subject to Moloks, there‚Äôs already been one of those lost.
---
There‚Äôs three dead Vamquishers.
---
So no, he‚Äôs not talking about anything besides Komodos. Please spin again and see if you land on something that makes you look less obviously like a dumb shill.
---
Eveseat covers this mostly however to get down to timings per day isn‚Äôt a clear line of sight. 
---
Mining ledgers aren‚Äôt time stamped, they are date stamped and ratting would come under bounties paid .. so to figure out if somebody is legit afk ratting vs VNI botting isn‚Äôt straight forward.
---
Botters do a isk Hand off generally, they will farm the bounties then hand off to a wallet who then does whatever comes next. Tracing the hand off is the best indicator as at an alliance / coalition level usually characters not in the ESI catchment is frowned upon (anti spy controls etc).
---
I‚Äôve written some reports to isolate markers for botting based on theory‚Äôs.. the most common pattern is always where does the isk go once the bot has made it.. usually that‚Äôs the strongest indicator .. normal afk line members pool their isk to buy ship fits, plex their account or skill injectors.. suspect members will always be lean on isk and have a major dump out to an unknown.. the frequency of that rate is what you can hand over to ccp for final review..
---
I do agree that as IT people for coalition / alliance we are more than happy to coordinate with security teams at ccp to build a better signal / noise reporting system with detailed evidence dumps ..
---
He is so pure &lt;3 that joy &lt;3 
---
I remember looking forward to your next illustration and asking for more. Thank you for doing so i love this cute style. :)
---
You have bad opinions, you should probably avoid subjecting others to them. 
---
Never said it was specifically interesting it is just a freaking epic video :D I love watching a good counter drop like that, and seeing a titan fleet cyno in is always a bit awe inspiring. 
---
It's why we need super titans to start balancing things back out.
---
was nearly impressed, but then the fax jumped in
---
I mean, I wouldn't think NWFLT's priority was ISK over content...

Upvote for that! :)

Look around you. You're the only person here who seems to have interpreted what I wrote 100% literally. If you need it spelled out this clearly, perhaps you should consider some basic reading comprehension classes at the learning annex or local community college. 
---
Or you could just take the time to go collect (or delete) the stuff. Probably a far more pragmatic approach.
---
This has PvPiqued my interest.
---
no I'm faking being in gsf lol
---
Can only speak for myself but:
---
Don't grind. Get unconventional. Leave the beaten path. Find what you're good at and what you enjoy, and then find a way to make money doing it. This might be scamming, spying -&gt; thefts, it might be highsec ganking, running extortion rackets, killing indy structures for loot, ninja looting titan brawls, ninja looting pirate sotiyos, etc. 
---
Now, you may want to do primitive accumulation by grinding anyway. Either find something with really good isk/hr, like topend whs or l5s, or grind *unconventionally* - for example, scamming up jita local can be 'grind' but isn't as awful as ishtar ratting. Basically, you play this game for fun, minimize the amount of unfun dumb stuff you have to do in it, and if possible find a fun, unconventional way to make cash. 
---
Aim high and don't accept a bad+unfun way to make isk; but don't worry about getting 13+-digit wealth any time soon, either. Not because you can't, it's just not helpful, so if it's also not fun, why bother? 
---
didn't mention public contracts. Those are the most expensive.
---
I just can't, can't read this. 
---
F1 lemmings or people who exclusively kill PvE ships
---
not sure who is most elit
---
mira chieve already did a better job than anyone else ever will
---
More asset safety is exactly what this game needs.
---
Real and substantial loss is getting rare in eve, lets make losing control of space even more insignificant.
---
Where did you pull  **Oursulaert** from? :)
---
The benefit of large null blobs is that there's always SIGs - special interest groups - that go out and do things together, and are alliance wide rather than bring corp dependent. For example, in TEST there's Predditors for those that enjoy blops and hot dropping, or DKS that enjoy sub-100 man fleet combat, or demolition squad for those that hate themselves and love grinding structures. There's also PvE based sigs and squads for things like Incursions and in-game channels for DED site bookmarks.
---
The downside is having to participate in mandatory strat-op and Call to Arms fleets that are for alliance or coalition goals. You also have a larger list of blues (allies) which can be restricting when finding targets to shoot in your area.
---
I don‚Äôt know about the other alliances but both a subsection of Dreddit and our alliance sig Predditors are focused on cloakly hotdropping on plump isk pinyattas in order to fill our tear wallets.  
---
So at the very least we‚Äôll be able to fufill that itch. 
---
Apart from that larger alliance are inherently more likely to have people that are doing the activity you want in the time zone you want. 
---
There are many more fleets that go out than the more popular f1 monkey fleets. 
---
Yeah, just sell those to the buy orders in Jita. I'll take those off your hands.
---
Init is fighting alone against Pandemic Legion, Northern Coalition and sometimes Horde (who is now basically deploying a sig).  
---
I think we're doing alright all things considered. Could be better, could be worse.  
---
That said, reddit's narrative about goon pets is pretty funny considering we've not brought goons in yet PanFam dropped their whole coalition including Horde on a single alliance (2 if you want to count Init mercs I guess)  
---
Horde will come, they must come.
---
It's called a pvp deployment. It's what keeps the game interesting. Only a handful of groups even do this still and if it weren't for them (and the beloved ankle-biting blob-fighters using NPC stations) this game would literally be rorqs online
---
Who are you?
---
haha wow... learned something.
---
Ok, let's apply that logic evenly.  
---
PL should unblue NC and Horde and see how long they last.  
---
Horde should unblue PL and NC and see how long they last  
---
NC should unblue PL and Horde and see how long they last  
---
Any legacy co alliance should unblue test and see how long they last.  
---
This is how coalitions work. This is nothing new.
---
TEST and Goons aren't deployed to Tribute/Vale. Panfam has deployed everything, including Horde Parmesans, to basically be right on top of Init's deployment.  
---
So yes, we are fighting outnumbered in a strategic sense. We had an 80 man bomber fleet yesterday, NC and co formed like 500 dudes lol
---
Kinda mothballs any kind of small scale hauling. Perhaps just make courier contracts easier to make.
---
Using the database as a reason is a decent excuse but not really relevant.
---
One little thing I noticed was that the little pop up bar at the top for the cookie policy still has what I assume is the default text from the template in it. It says "Use this space to summarize your privacy and cookie use policy. Learn More."
---
Otherwise, good stuff.
---
https://i.imgur.com/A90ayJn.jpg
---
Don't worry about being useless in a fleet fight with a corp. You will get enough action flying cheap ewar or tackle frigates easily! Just go join a corp and have fun pew-pewing stuff
---
Well, lots of that happened up north with a little civil war.
---
Never mind the fact wed rather shoot each other than be forced into the blue meta because the imperium wants to glaze a donut.
---
Because the same type of implants would increase sheild super tank to stupid leavels because of invreased passive regen 
---
Once a day I restart the extractions. Usually when I'm in a lull from missions or whatever I'm doing. Once I week I haul the goods. That takes a little longer. 
---
Of course you want to see big plays, where you have supercap superiority.  
---
Really all of this is tiring. Not specifically saying you are smugposting, rather some of the commenters, but if you had deployed to Fountain, where we have supercap superiority, much the same thing would be happening and reddit would basically be calling on you guys to feed.  
---
Seems like the current reddit meta just seems to favor people turtling rather than taking risks, and then yelling at people for turtling.
---
What garbage... To think all those extra resources and it wasn't even worth it.
---
So you are trying to find a good corp. It's hard. Really hard. I got super lucky early on on my Eve career to stumble in to a good corp. That made all the difference 8+ years later. There is nothing that will replace getting to know the groups and pilots over the course of a few years and may fights. I think that is where many newer players have trouble.
---
First, answer the question of **what** do you want to do? As much as we complain, Eve is a game unrivaled in content and different activities you can take part in.
---
Second, answer the question of **where** do you want to live? Highsec, Lowsec, FW lowsec, NPC nullsec, SOV nullsec, WH space, etc.
---
Third, answer the question of **how** do you want to play Eve? Do you want to be solo, NPSI, small gang, Large SOV fleets, etc.
---
Fourth, identify your typical play time and figure out what that is in Eve time.
---
I will give you an example of myself looking for a new corp. I want to PvP, I want live in WH space, I want to do small gang, and I am mainly on Eve from 19:00-0200.
---
Alright, I want to find a WH PvP corporation. Where do I find those... Why not google? Add "Reddit" to your search and you can see what people are saying about corps and alliances. [Oh hey. look at that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5shefp/question_which_is_the_best_wormhole_corp/) It's a top corps post. It's not much, but it's a starting point. A goof 50+ comment thread will give you some idea of the pros and cons of the groups.
---
Next stop: [zkill](https://zkillboard.com/). You can search corps and alliances here. Since I am an old school 2011-1013 Syndicate Bro I like the small gang kitey stuff. That sounds like MCAV. Why not search them on [zKill](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006690/)?

The big question is what do you look for? You want 1. lots of kills. 2. lots of different characters doing the killing. 3. A consistent number of kills across the top killers. Why? Move on if they don't have lots of kills. Lots of charters killing means it's not a dead alliance. A fairly even spread of kills across the top killers shows that it's not just a few pilots doing the killing. MCAV is doing well.
---
Don't forget to check the times that the kills happen. You want to be playing when the killing is happening.
---
Look at the [stats page](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006690/stats/). Take the number of kills in the month and divide by 30. Would you be happy with that average number of kills a day? Are the last 12 months consistent enough in kills for you? MCAV has 3 slow months. September (133), June (221), and May (196). The last 6 months are showing a good solid trend. I think it's worth the risk. 
---
Pro tip: You can also look at individual months through "TOP" -&gt; ["Monthly Top"](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006690/top/) to see the characters and ships used for the kills. Do you fly these ships? How far away are you from flying these ships?
---
Next, pull up their info in-game. Do you see any odd rules? Any restrictions you don't like?
---
Then find their public chat and talk with them. Most members in the group will be there. Chat them up. Ask them questions.
---
Finally, put in an app. Yeah, it may not work out. But if you get immersed in a corp doing the things you want to do you will naturally run in to other corps doing the same thing. Ask yourself, what makes them different? Would I like it better there? Turns out I really like MCAV. So I probably won't be leaving soon. But if I did I would know lots of other corps and alliance I could go to.
---
Love this work, so useful and clean to use.. Love it... Thanks for your hard work...
---
don't fall for the "pvp sig" meme, they're all mediocre, that's all
---
Which time?
---
Spend the time collecting it all. Travel with a mineral hauler and reprocess it all. 
---
I agree, I don't like coalitions because I prefer target rich environments (but I'd also like to not get curbstomped). I don't crab in null space, I run an incursion alt for isk, so I'm biased tho. I understand why coalitions are formed.
---
It depends what YOU are good at. Find your niche and start making money. Most find exploration the easiest effort/isk ratio for newer players.
---
Once you've made enough to expand, many then move to carrier ratting, rorq mining, industry or station/region trading.
---
After that it's all about scalability. How many carriers can you ~~bot~~ rat with, how many rorquals can you ~~bot~~ mine with. How many big toys you can build. How much capital you have to invest in the market. 
---
Then you get to the stupid rich where you have to consider the actual potential isk available. At what point are there no anoms left in safe space? At what point are there no asteroids left. Can the market handle me dumping 20,000 Warp Scrambler II's. Is there enough trade happening in this area to support handle the amount of isk I want to move.
---
Side note: Investigate how many things you can do to make passive isk. PI, light indy and research/copying blueprints all provide small amounts of nearly effort free isk.
---
I have zero issues with a pvp deployment.  I myself participate in them.  I see this deployment ending in one of two ways.  Either they retreat back to Fountain, or they have to call upon the rest of the Imperium.  They are flat out losing, no other way to spin it.  Even Mittens' Spinmaster 9000 can't keep up.
---
pvp tournaments 
---
You haven't brought Goons in because you know that you will be hard pressed to convince GSF to commit.  I mean, you are wanting to fight everyone at once.  You cannot do that.  Here in a couple of weeks you will see INIT also (probably, based upon how upset folks were over the deal) invading GOTG again.  INIT. is getting too big for its' britches when it comes to picking fights with everyone.  They will then act if they are the premier group all the while being members of the Fountain Feeders Federation.
---
If they kick you, just join goons
---
Getting in a super should not be anyone's goal. I'd rather spend my time in a HAC or any advanced cruiser. To be those are the meat of this game. Most bang for your buck. Most fun. 
---
10 years then.
---
EVE's shitty state is mostly down to risk adversity and wealth accumulation, prove me wrong. The players deserve the shitheap of a game they've created.
---
Can confirm my leshak died right after the "shitfit?" Bhal. Wally, please grow some brain cells. You need help. Please seek medical attention
---
TOM YOUR REDDIT FIGHT GAME IS SO WEAK STOP
---
GF ez kiki antiblob
---
Happends I guess? At least something happened
---
Don't the genolution set also help? 
---
what button he push?
---
You don't have to be an F1 monkey, the larger alliances have roles for everything you want to do. And they have the space to allow you to find what that even is. As others mentioned, the bigger alliances also have SIGs - groups dedicated to specific goals, or just acting as small gangs.
---
And while yes, larger alliances also give you access to more players, this doesn't always directly translate to blobs, it can also mean more players in your time zone, interested in doing what you want to do; be it a roam, gate camp, ratting, or whatever. Alongside giving you access to resources, the biggest of which is players to talk to and consult, but also including SRP, free ships, etc.
---
Personally, I *am* a fan of the huge fleet fights. As a logi pilot they are incredibly engaging and enjoyable.
---
Brave Newbies Inc. is recruiting players of all skill levels ;)
---
I bet you are a blast at parties....
---
F1 would be my guess... 
---
He pressed D.
---
The "now i die" button, clearly.
---
Why is it when people are confronted with facts and logic they have to make an emotional response.
---
What's wrong with attacking someone in a pvp game for shit talking you? Why are you trying to create a safe space for them, it's a game. 
---
Is it tho?
---
Alpha!
---
you know how you could fix it before. You zoomed all the way out
---
What's wrong with setting up a gank squad? Why do you need to war dec a whole alliance when one person smack talks a bit? Why do you have to resort to violence when someone hurts your feelings? Yes it's a PvP game, no I'm not saying high sec should be safe. But you need to find other ways to deal with you emotions than hurting others.
---
Why is it when you are confronted with facts and logic do you have to make an emotional response?
---
A few things.
---
I used to massively stockpile meta modules that sold in the 10k isk range. Generally any module that was better than t1, but sold for super cheap.
---
Talking in the 20-30 thousand range. I really liked the idea of being able to bankroll a war in faction warfare for cheap.
---
When the balance pass came updating some of the modules, some items which turned into regolith medium shield extenders, went from a 10k item, to a 4 mil item. About a 400 return on investment.
---
I also made 100+ bil on that isk blink site. When they had 24 hours to shut down, they did this ridiculous promotion where you could cash out. I think I was getting bils there for $4. It was a cash investment, but it was wayyyy cheaper than you could buy plex for from CCP
---
Link?

Fuck off StainGuy.

Can someone tell me how these whopping howitzers are hitting frigates so well?
---
I can't even hit frigates reliably with other frigates.
---
wtf hacks

*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **6th Cakeday** eagle33322! ^(hug)

I look on grid in every fleet I go on (several per day unless I'm really busy) and see no goons or other assorted rabble. Gatecamps, sure I'll see some goons. Organized fleets? No. What you're seeing is some bored people. If you have some kill reports of organized goon fleets in Tribute and Vale, working with Init for the same objective,  I'd like to see them.
---
Holy shit 46 minutes... wow!
---
Pretty damn good voice acting too... this shit is awesome!

[http://prntscr.com/mss21v](http://prntscr.com/mss21v) goon so dumb lmfao 
---
this post is actually garbage, much like evefeed
---
Same rules apply for everyone. 
---
So yes, if you accidentally try to rep an enemy, you go boom. Of course, safety on yellow prevents this, while not stopping you doing anything you can normally do, without being concordokkened.
---
*blip*
---
Did I stutter?
---
Same rules apply.
---
you make marshy and olmeca look like well balanced individuals.

Eventually we are going back to Fountain, because that's our permanent staging area. This is a deployment, after the deployment ends, you go back to your staging area. Whether or not its a retreat isn't based on where you go when you're done, it's judged by the general level of panic, feeding pre-'retreat', and haste, as well as maybe the time passed since deployment.  
---
If we call up the Imperium, we're just doing what Panfam already did.  
---
If we don't call up the Imperium, we get taunted with "goons will come, they must come" and assorted comments about feeding.  
---
If we do, it's blobbing. Reddit has decided it hates us and will not look upon us positively no matter what we do.  
---
It's a good thing Reddit doesn't decide who is relevant and who isn't, lol.
---
Read those three rules.
---
_if_ the freighter is in a wardecced corp: yes, concord would (or rather, their safety would stop them, as there's no good reason for a logi to be safety red.)
---
If not, nope.
---
You sound mad bro.
---
Have a quick think about who you're arguing with here ;)
---
We may have had explicit clarification that we're right about this.
---
When you gonna play again fam, I miss Horde cheering when I get blapped \^\^
---
An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.
---
Haha idiot, your brain is fucking rotten from spod. Better go mining you pathetic crab, or your goon overlord gives you the spanking!!
---
Lame ass post but upvoted bc grrr gons
---
It's not possible.
---
They aren't moving.
---
I can confirm that, if a target is wardecced (by anyone), and has a pvp combat timer, they cannot be repped by anyone but their own corp/alliance, without that repper triggering concord on themselves.
---
Regardless of any other wars.
---
Are you talking about the post or yourself?
---
Doesn't the tiny signature radius mean you do a lot less damage anyway?
---
As an added bonus, think of the activity tracker points you'll round up.
---
lol
---
this would do nothing to fix it
---
I recommended it strongly but Im no one important so yeh... 
---
Fun fact, your dread was my first DD target... and second kill mark. 
---
Things get blown up in Eve.
---
Just because this thing is valuable because of scarcity doesn't really make any difference,   the fight was still actually won by TEST - this coming from a guy who actually thinks Test, Frat, Goons and such are just cancer to the game.
---
Don't use it? Don't wanna trash it? Then contract it to that Alpha account you never use. When nothing is happening but you are really bored you may end up logging the alpha in and sorting/hauling some of it, and with it only 'owning' trash you contracted it, every asset location is one that needs sorting/hauling instead of 1st checking what is there so it is easier to plan the route.
---
You fix bountys by removing them since they are complete useless anyways

Well fuck it then! Naked it is! Dont bother with the ZMX1100 or SM-706 either. Shit might as well forget that Geno set...

Yes, I too sit in a 200b titan with no implants. Because you know, slaves.
---
There aren't enough Picards in all of the Star Trek continuum for that amount of facepalm 
---
A bit of mild criticism, I would personally swap the order of how do you want to play with where do you want to live. 
---
As often the place you live puts pressure on what the dominant playstyle is. 
---
Otherwise, it's not a bad approach to take to filter out corps and making a final selection. 
---
Horac you are the big gay &lt;3

Can I quote this comment in the future when HR and Diplo's tell me they can't check for bots?

Its an old calssic :)

Not going to fix it,  but good suggestions either way.

Jumped gate on main instead of scout

I dunno, is it?
---
join gs_isk, and just do whatever aryth suggests. 
---
I mean... that's a tinker fitting for high class wormhole PVE. I'm sure it was more than one button press that ended it up in some lowsec system. Probably bad judgment of not using a Blockade Runner or travelceptor to move blingy mods separately from the hull.
---
Just because I love having downvotes in r/Eve.  
---
TEST - Brags about outplaying Fratenity and inflicting heavy losses,  doesn't really care about the Komodo because LOL-Bot ratting and mining operations in carebear nullsec means they get their money back
---
FRAT - Manages to get a Komodo that gives their ISK efficiency a healthy boost, but unfortunately doesn't understand they still got their ass kicked,  doesn't really care because LOL-Bot ratting and mining operations in carebear nullsec means they get their money back
---
GOON - somehow think that not being involved in a battle that wasn't capitals and super caps being dropped on Frigs gives them reason to comment,  didn't lose any money and wouldn't care if they did because LOL-Bot ratting and mining operations in carebear nullsec means they get their money back
---
INIT - because LOL-Bot ratting and mining operations in carebear nullsec means they get their money back
---
Rest of Eve?  Finds this shit cancerous. 
---
Rattlesnake pilot here.  
---
I literally just left my corp (wormholer btw) so I was hauling my stuff out into KSpace. It seems that was not a good idea.
---
I realized a few minutes later that my comments in local could be taken the wrong way so I sent a followup email
---
"To be clear about my comments in local
---
Worst wrong button ever, did not want to jump that gate

I hate you all and I think you are all terrible people

But I'm still going to salute you all for the successful high-value kill. Shame the Loot Fairy Said No on everything.

you mean the past 10 years were just pretend?
