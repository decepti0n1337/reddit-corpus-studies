Flying logi in caracal fleets. Initially I was also in a caracal but my missile skills were so bad none of the targets were in range. So I grabbed an Osprey, figured out how to capchain, and started joining all the caracal fleets I could. There’s still no feeling like saving someone out of low structure.

It add massive ehp to your super/tit basically. It make sense to have super/titan to have mandatory fax alt than asking other people to rep your ass without yourself providing one on your own.

 In a true Digital Single Market, European consumers should have the right to buy and play video games of their choice regardless of where they live in the EU. Consumers should not be prevented from shopping around between Member States to find the best available deal. Valve and the five PC video game publishers now have the chance to respond to our concerns,” Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.

i dont think anythin will come with this, steam has its excuse and they're pretty right with that. you can see me as an example, without their regional prices, i would never played eve i guess....

A few mil, [Evermarketer.com](https://Evermarketer.com) and know where the Price History tab is in the market. You're not going to sell anything if the product isn't moving in a volume you can move. So, buying a few thousand mods is a really bad investment if a few thousand of that mod aren't moved on the market in a given period of time. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you need an ISK injection, I recommend moving Spirits, Soil, and Garbage to start with. Those trade goods are NPC controlled, so they always make a profit if you move them between stations. Garbage literally doubles in value, but is rather Large, making moving volume harder. It will get you your first few million isk quickly, though. 
---
With that injection, you can begin trading in player commodities. I recommend starting with Meta Mods (IE the ones that are used most in PVP. They're generally the more expensive, but also can be determined by their Powergrid and CPU needs, with the better PVP gear taking the least of each. The smaller mods move faster. Generally things that are smaller pop faster, hence their speed on the market. 
---
Haul Ammo to Arnon. People doing the Epic Arc always need it. Look at the Star Map with the filters set for Ships Destroyed in the last Hour and haul ammo, mods, ships, implants, drones and nanite paste to these hotspots. Be ready to get Scrambled, so fit your hauler with Warp Stabilizers. Most of these hotspots are in Low or Null, meaning you won't have the benefit of surviving till concord arrives. Fit a buffer tank and enough speed to survive a turn and burn back to the gate. Anybody who shoots you can't follow. 
---
And when you plan your hauling trips, check the route for hotspots. Odds are a hotspot in Low means a Gate Camp. 
---
Station Trading only requires you buy low and sell high. But you need to know when prices are going to change to be really effective, so talking to alliances to see when battles will occur will give you an edge. And it requires lots of patience. This is often a passive revenue stream, supplementing Hauling, Ratting or pvp.
---
Except the EU isn't forcing steam to do anything about Turkey or Russia.
---
Its just CCP and Steam being lazy. 
---
That is amazingly helpful, mate! I appreciate it! 
---
Oh yeah it really sucks for a lot of gamers because regional pricing is the only way for them to be able to afford to play like yourself. But the EU doesn't really care and all they see is another country getting the same good/service for a cheaper price. 
---
I'm just saying that it wasn't just CCP coming out of the blue with this change cause I'm guessing the EU is going around to alot of Game publishers with these demands. Things that happen with the EA effect the industry as a whole even if they are not part of it case in point Steam refunds only really happened because the EU came after them for it and it was easier to change all markets then just the EU markets.

EVE players tend to throw big tantrums. Sometimes, like with the Monocle incident, it's good, but usually they're just screaming to  make the game more fun for Veterans and harder to learn and less accessible to everybody else.
---
This isn't just a thing Pandemic Horde is known for, it's all the major alliances. They want the game to stay safe and fun for them, but they don't consider how it affects anybody else. And all they can see is everybody playing the game currently agreeing with them, ignoring that EVE's player base has been on a steady decline since release and their chats are echo chambers.  
---
The only reason the game still exists is sheer Love. I don't want to see it die, but I can't help but liken it's progression to that of Dementia. It hurts to watch, especially because most people hate on me for daring suggest anything could possibly be wrong with their baby.

its why i play eve. i love the pvp, but i hardly do it. i love making fits, but you can only make so many

next step is to get a purple (or abyssaled) dcu. it already has a purple Adaptive nano plate.
---
its silly, its dumb, its been lovingly called my "poor mans AT frigate" by some. it just makes me happy to own.
---
You are going to need to define what you think per capita means, because we are roughly double their size, yet we out rat, mine, and produce them 5 or more to 1 every single month.
---
I think we can safely say all of eve would enjoy them airing out the dirty laundry that would result from a wallet audit.
---
Sorry, left Test a long time ago. And all my friends currently in Test are not active. But I’m sure someone will be able to help you plenty.

I had a similar thought, and found Ohrmazd and Zartosht (another term for Zoroaster).  Zar(tosht) + (Ohr)mazd = Zarmazd?  Interestingly in Persian Zar can mean gold and Mazd wisdom, which might make sense for the Amarr.  Not aware of another example where names are mashed together like that though.  There's also Aramazd, the Armenian form of Ohrmazd.
---
A ton of PVE stuff was released completely undocumented on CCP's side, and that's entirely on purpose. It encourages people to experiment, and it also empowers those who do so, as they can choose whether to release the data or keep it all for themselves. 
---
WHs are a prime example: almost all the data out there has been gathered by players. My group was among the first to figure out how to farm C6s after drifters were introduced, and we made mad isk out of it.
---
Hey, I just want you to play EVE, have fun and make more fun for EVE. This game is hurting and every pilot out in the black getting shit done helps.

I wanted to test my pvp fit and he offered to dual and we would stop at half armor. Well he didnt.

I then dwelled and knew I couldn't get back at him by myself so I did the next best thing, hired a merc to gank him in high, and payment would be on delivery of his body.

---
Not at all. My arguments are consistent with the theory that EVE is a PvP game where shooting spaceships is desirable. Risk-aversion is bad, entitlement is bad, carebearism is a curse, and bot-aspirancy is shameful. Enjoyment is found in learning new things, taking risks, fighting enemies, teamwork, self-reliance, delayed gratification, shooting anybody who plays the game wrong. PvP must never be qualified, every fight is a good fight, and sportsmanship is crucial.

If you were crazy enough to farm 7b a month for plex, you are crazy enough to run 2-3 accounts at higher plex prices.

---
Even when loki was bad, it had solo c3 fits that only the tengu could be better then. And of course the cloaked web bonused fits that were better then the Min Assault cruisers
---
Same way as Omega: Watch local, don't jump directly to gates, use Dscan to check your landing sites, check Star Map for hotspots and fly what you can afford to lose. 
---
You can make a nice haul with a Navy Frigate and have the mobility to escape anybody landing on you. Only thing you can't really account for are covert ops ganks, save by moving around a lot. Try kiting the rats you're farming away from the warp in point as you fight, to give yourself more time to clear and run.

&gt; But EVE is a big place and in order for it to survive, these massive groups of players need to stop oppressing everybody who isn't with them.

Pandemic, specifically, with it's numbers should be Curating New Eden, making sure it's the best it possibly could be for everybody else. That's what I would be attemption with that power, anyways, in addition to whatever needs be doing.

Eve is a niche game. People play it because it offers something that other games do not. Eve represents war, murder, theft, terror, intrigue, innovation, and conquest. That's why proper Eve players play Eve. People who like carebear stuff will play other games, because other games do carebear stuff better.

Once you’ve been in EVE, other MMOs feel like kindergarten. In EVE you can pull stunts on a daily basis where other MMOs would ban you and your family until the heat death of the universe + 15 years for. That’s what makes it so compelling as an experience [and the sound scape, and the great visuals, and the shiny new ships, etc... etc... etc...]

I can believe less people doing the abyss. Filament prices are being artificially manipulated, driving the cost of everything stemming from them through the roof.

Outside of L4 missions, the main use for battleships in HS PvE is incursions and event sites. Incursions require a lot of bling, but are also some of the best ISK/hr in HS. Event sites aare hit or miss, but are only avaliable during events and aren't always available. The raven isn't great for incursions, usually you will be flying a pirate battleships.

Hmmmm.

T2 heavies can have better tracking then navy drones, but less EHP and worse tracking, so there are reasons to use both. The tracking is much less of an issue for medium drones, and they are definitely worth training.

Just for you, I'll put my editing hat on:
---
POS sov encouraged players to engage in conflict on equal terms.
---
No sov system since then does this.
---
CCP should create a new sov system that does.
---
They should do this everywhere else in the game.
---
And if that's the essence of your argument, you're not saying anything that we didn't know already, or any real ways to fix it. (I'm not even sure that POS sov encourages such conflicts, but details.)

Wonder if that's at all linked the total players in Imperium? ....could be a correlation....not sure.

This is blatantly untrue. I was just an ordinary line member and I have been in PGL's fleets. I remember that he cared very much about the fact that I thought it was okay to warp to 0 on the titan. I still think it's okay. And I'm pretty sure he still cares, whether he admits it or not.
---
Sorry not sorry. Warpin to 0 erryday. Ain't nobody got time for approach.

Don't fall into a noob trap like thinking all you can do is one particular thing - commonly mining or highsec missions. Try new things, don't be afraid to jump head first into something and get into a player corp - you can simply leave and find a different one if you don't like it.

Yes, and no. Thing is where he/she is from (Turkey) $15 US buys SO MUCH MORE as their local currency is worth fuck all due to financial issues with the country. What is $15 for you may be 1-2 hours work, for people in Turkey it's a days pay or more equivalent due to the buying power (or in this case, lack there of) of their local currency.
---
    
---
  
---
In short, $15 US is NOT the same as the equivalent of $15 US in local currencies nor does it have the same buying power nor the roughly same time to earn it. Different economies currency is valued different, it's why we have a currency exchange and exchange rates and why a load of people go to countries with worse economies than their homes for holidays because their $1,000 buying power in their holiday country would be worth the equivalent of $2,000-$4,000 in the local currency.

---
You would be ab le to boot people from BOT, but they own structures and may just flip to the other side allowing docking rights...same goes for other NC rental regions. 
---
   
---
 NC. and Lady Scarlett has proven that they are utterly incompitent in holding that space. Totally unable to ensure safety of your assets in these regions. Totally tone deaf on their Renters hardships, losses and inability to use what they are renting. Then they have the GALL to pretty much say 'fuck you pay my money!'
---
Fact of the matter is they are unable to defend renters space, thus they will be unable to evict you from said rental space. Stick to your guns, don't pay rent, tell them to go fuck themselves until they prove that they are worthy of their rent. Until then reach out to other groups...Goons and Init are good starts, to see if they can offer good prices etc and possibly assist with relocation.
---
After all...who IS steam rolling your rented space right now? Who is to say they wont do it again should you go elsewhere?
---
We do get bored you know....
---
Yeah, whoa. I never go below 0.8.

I mean one of my alts created the alliance they were hardly spies

We have couple of dual-prop t3c fits which support our "heavy" leshak comp, and proteus is not that bad there. While legion has better damage type and projection against ECM ships, proteus gets away w/o injector and has these long scram and point, thanks to his sub which reduces MWD cap use.

I'm happy being a random Alliance Member #45641 casually shitposting on the side. 
---
Me too :) Not returning soon enough tbh
---
Cynos don’t work in wormhole space btw. And hunting explorers is easier in wh space because there is no local.
---
Start with an Astero. You can move to a Stratios later.
---
Also, 4-5 points gimps your fit in other ways. Use a faction scram with three points and you will catch most explorers. Every once in a while you will encounter a Magnate with a bunch of stabs but that’s not that common.
---

Well rip my income.. time to spam grind and buy a wh dread

honestly I'm not interested in selling, it's one of those things that he was a fun guy to play with and I look over his corpses every once in a while to remember how sad I am he left us.
---
We're all in eso? *Glances at deployment staging*
---
Start with exploration to make isk and work on scanning. Then move to pvp.
---
Whut

I mean Hedliner has high expectations, piggles will just shreak in your ear endlessly over stupid shit.

Look what he said you retard. Go work someone else shaft.
---
But you did set a goal post
---
As a fellow Aussie, you might want to appreciate our economic situation a bit more - an hours work at our *minimum fucking wage* pays for a sub.
---
Do yourself a favour, do some research or better yet, make use of those good Aussie dollars and travel a bit, I guarantee you'll come home realising just how good we have it here.
---
I'm thinking about making an alpha alt to salvage/MTU while I run level four security missions. Anyone else do this? Is it worth the hassle?
---
Catch, Curse, Stain
---
where
---
your reading comprehension isn't very good. context clues, friend. they are here to help.
---
it's pretty simple. TEST rorqs and supers get to stay and krab in esoteria. Other legacy members are required to move to immensea. Gotta keep those ADMs high, right?
---
Or are we just gonna pretend that's not what's happening?
---
&gt;shreak in your ear endlessly over stupid shit
---
please refer it with the correct term of "Aggressively encourage"
---
A decline in geolocking of prices and fast rising prices in countries with lower per capita GDP - stands to reason it will spur the development of the gaming industry in poorer countries to some extent.
---
So far it's been fun, the petes sucked but now that we swapped up from harpies they seem to have vanished. It's too bad goons showed up to "help" us, they really increased the tidi and for some reason killed a bunch of legacy nagas.
---
That's not true. While on average other t3cs might be better, proteus has at least few uses:
---
- rail combat cruiser with fast warp, with cloak or without it. Pretty cool if you need to bring some dps to 9 jumps away (corpmate of mine liked it alot, but he's inactive now)
---
- any direct combat fit with rails which benefits from long-range scram/point (i posted example in another comment) 
---
- fast-warping cloaky smartbomb ship for nuking ceptors burning into some direction (this one I've never used myself, but Nika Noiser explained how he lost ceptor to such proteus once)
---
Any other t3c will not outdo proteus because all of these fits rely on unique subs: mwd cap use reduction, point range boost, warp speed boost (w/o agi or slot amount penalty like on nullifier). 
---
I always make this mistake lol, thanks
---
Or you can just extract at the end of the month and keep the accounts plexed for free.

Pay attention to politics and you will agree, ppl

/r/evejobs
---
Yep, pretty much.
---
Conflict in Eve feels so synthetic and the harder they try to force it into existence by way of arbitrary mechanics the less it feels like the organic conflicts matter.
---
Eve hardly needs a sov system to begin with, if e.g. anomalies just spawned with no regard for a structure, then we would fight over the anomalies.
---
If there were no anomalies, we would fight over belts.
---
This type of conflict is continuous and self-balancing with regard to times of peak activity and even provides opportunities for "the little guy".
---
Timezone-obsessed citadel and sovereignty mechanics do not add anything, they only take away what was already there.
---
The POS sov system got so many things right -- it uses a structure which is not a synthetic objective with no other purpose, it allowed for initiation at any time of day, it provided incentives for both sides of a conflict to "meet in the middle", and at least when POS were the only practical place to park your shit it was a direct proxy for occupancy of space.
---
It really doesn't feel like anything they've done since has improved on that in any way even as they further differentiate the mechanics from core game play and encumber them with arbitrary restrictions.
---
not voting a deal 4 times = hard brexit. maybe i was misunderstood. Effect is the same for not voting a soft brexit, as for voting for hard brexit 4 times.
---
anyway, i just received an email from Google saying that they will move payments to Ireland... Probably these guys have more inside info than we do.
---
i find its usually best to ignore F1 monkeys on a general basis.
---
F1 monkey here.  FCs sometimes worth ignoring, but usually its useful to listen to a few things they say so you can get on max kill mails while losing as few ships as possible.  Sometimes they say things like "align".  Sure most of us don't listen, but I find your ship has a lower chance of getting tackled if you hear that part and decide to align.

See long time ago, me and my brother Kyle was warping around near Taisy when all of a sudden, there shined a shiny beacon...
---
Isn't that from their own alliance leaders because they are feeding capital ships if not in range of test support?
---
You're reading too far too into this in order to make an irrelevant point to fit your narrative. My post showed the irony of how hard you all trying.
---
I feel bad for those guys forced to do this cyno jamm watch then get into the CTA cuz if you dont you will get yelled at and probably get kicked out and get your shit stuck in Eso.....damn... F for those guys....
---
uh that is only because they can't guarantee a save 95% of the time using their standing fleets.
---
yes I understand that's the narrative. how you square people having assigned mining/ratting systems with that is a different thing. 
---
Carebearism is a curse and bot aspirancy is shameful.... Kind of self-hating your own Corp considering its ties to goons (in which both of those behaviors are rampant)
---
News tomorrow: unspoken widots into goons. 
---
/shrug
---
Its not uncommon for many alliances to place restrictions on ratting and mining during times of war to avoid excessive feeding.  Conditions in Impass and Catch were not conducive I guess for continued capital ship usage, so they condensed into a tighter region for that sort of activity.
---
Oh come on lol
---
Right there with you
---
You didn't deny it.
---
You can't log an alpha in if you're already running another client. You'd need both accounts to be omega.
---
Only one has ever been lost, I believe. 
---
Yes, I disapprove of the excessive krabbing done by Goons. It is excusable since it is happens in nullsec where anybody may shoot anybody at any time without penalty, and because any perceived safety is the result of the hard work, organization, and vigilance of fellow players.
---
Why isn't this the top comment
---
So ... Outer Ring, the darkroom of Eve? 
---
Holy shit. FRT even morale posted about this meme.

Viva la Piggles!

I'm unbelievably proud of you.

Good job, capsuleer!

Why not go to eso then hmmm

To enforce this pricing scheme to EU citizens only, they will need a way to distinguish between EU citizen and non-EU citizen, I guess people will be mad if steam will force them to login via verified ID. Given there's no such way to verify IDs due to lack of integration with government registries (like in china), equal pricing for everyone is indeed the easiest way to go. 
---
Ocmon. You dont need to pretend. We all know you drew it by yourself!

Yeah, heading to IAS- at that time was a mistake on your mates part.

Between IAS-, SAI- and other surround systems around at that time 500+ pilots were in a Heavy Tidi battle. Probably more. Went on for about 3-4 hours I think.

All I remember hearing is "FC Orca on the gate wanna kill..nevermind its dead."

So, Its been about a week and I've checked the kill board every day . Is the eviction of Holesale over? who lost? I see a fort kill and a couple other  smaller kills on Holesale Operation kill board, But I also see the same for Sound, HK, Didn't see a citadel loss for Hawks but might have missed it.  Its total chaos.. so Please drop some info so we can live threw you .

We were wondering what an Orca was doing in the middle of our war against the Pandas, especially since they aren't allowed to mine.
---
Good fight man!   
---
Malaysian here, we got shafted too. 
---
RIP 8USD sub dream. Was thinking trying to sub an industry alt.
---
Still say the cheapest way to get Omega is to check your national currency exchange rate first. If its higher than the US Dollar go to somewhere like Markee Dragon where they charge in Dollars no matter where you are world wide.
---
That cuts out Steam and any bullshit CCP does like the $15 = €15 parity crap. ($15 dollars currently €13 Euro's, hasnt been close for over a year. Hell even when they did the mark down on Omega and Plex during Fanfest it was still cheaper to buy through Markee Dragon even though he wasnt matching the discount CCP was offering.)
---
\&gt; its like training into a carrier but not knowing fighters exist.

Or training into a Moros.

No missing module though. The mistake was the Moros.

I didn't realize Abyssals were in highsec. That sounds cool, will look into it, thanks!

Sparton said "hey, why are you there with an orca, people are confused, youre about to get blapped" blath kust wanted to welp like a true man. 11/10 should gone with him

Last time the Proteus was good Sir Molle still played.

Cleary as I'm a super ignorant f1 monkey, can you explain what you mean?
---
 Pilot Error basicly. They were very much outside the super umbrella, in shit fit supers.  The attackers had more then enough time to kill them before help arrived.
---
I guarantee the person running that operation smashed the panic button and then alt-tabbed to the super pilot no he could focus on getting a killmark without worrying about anything. Unluckily for him, OP was ready to GTFO.

So does a marauder.

This is gold and your editing style makes me want to go watch Rhiload.  Down the rabbit hole I go.

What is this Anthonypit1 knock off shit?

and what old and new price is now for turkeys?
---
Why can't they use the country detection they use now? 
---
well battleships are the main  bulk but if you can realy not get one, a (depending waht tank your fleet use of cause) heavy tanked battlecuiser or cuiser might also help  granted there are allready some good Battleships in fleet allready.
---
I just recently got into the game, focused on building out a Vexor Navy Issue to do some null sec anomaly ratting, and now they are getting nerf. Can someone explain the nerf to me? How bad is it? Will I not be able to do this anymore?
---
Unfortunately for most hi-sec incursion groups the only real options are battleships or T2 logi.
---
Guardian.
---
(I am not recommending this) I multibox incursions in my free time and the only real answers are T2 logi (or Nestor) and Battleships. If you have friends it would be more enjoyable to try run with them for the experience.
---
It’s like you can live without your hands somehow but you will want kys if you suddenly lost your hands.
---
I’d just quit spaceship game in my case If I have to play alpha.
---
I started to fix shit but then decided I'd put in about as much effort as you did and said fuck the whole thing.  Half the people on both sides need to be swapped goons were with us that fight, starchaser and the therapists aren't on Legacy's side they're with Frat, its all kinds of fucked up.
---
Literally no one is forced to do this op if you've already done your single op of the month you're good to go.
---
There is a difference between:
---
Legacy leadership does not care about you.
---
As compared to 
---
Who cares what line members THINK
---
I found that he did care about people in fleets checked up on me once during a fight.
---
PGL’s picture is a 5’4 racist with a superiority complex why didn’t I see this coming
---
I think botters and hackers will just play with PLEX tbh
---
In null, I suppose it's Geminate, since that's the only null I've lived in. But while deployed Branch, I thought that was a nice area.
---
In high sec, it's Sinq Laison. That's where I lived for years.

Mhhh quality post here. Love it.

Good riddance.

They are usually announced through the launcher, so watch for news items there. I wouldn't call them a reliable source of income, but it is an option that meets your criteria of being doable in a battleship as an alpha. They usually run for 2 weeks, and happen every 2-3 months. Honestly, you are probably better off downsizing to a pirate cruiser and hunting DED if you want to hunt rats in HS as an alpha and can't get into incursions.
---
Do drugs.

Ya I was going to say Cobalt;  Even though it is a logistical nightmare when you're there you really feel like you're on the edge of the cluster.

Cache, because of the lore 
---
"The history of Cache is shrouded in mystery, even among the highest levels of the four Empires. No record remains of its original explorers, or what they were after. The region stretches out into the eastern darkness like a mangled claw, stringing far-flung stars into a twisted necklace of frozen tears. What did the nameless voyagers hope to find out in the cold tomb of trackless space? And given the abrupt end to which the region comes, did they find it, or did some darker fate befall them?"
---
Wanna see DPS on over heating 
---
yeah its great having a part of your space that regularly gets roams through it. so that you can form defence fleets and have fun hunting the hunters. especially if you can crab somewhere else.
---
HAWs have better native range than large weapons though.

How to tank your security status 101
---
Alliance chat is solely used for announcements. Corp chat can't be regulated unfortunately (CCPlease) and you get a KF/TEST/whatever troll now and then. But since you can simply ignore corp mails and delete them unread every now and then it's not that bad.
---
They don't have to do it by citizenship, just by country. All that was required is that codes purchased in the EU work anywhere in the EU.
---
&gt; European consumers should have the right to buy and play video games of their choice regardless of where they live in the EU. Consumers should not be prevented from shopping around between Member States to find the best available deal.
---
It doesn't say a code purchased in Turkey by an EU citizen has to work outside Turkey. If the EU citizen buys a code from outside the EU valve would be allowed to block it's use even by that new rule.
---
It also says nothing about pricing: Valve et cetera *could* continue to give discounts to Estonia as long as they allowed those codes to with in Germany. Obviously they don't want to do that. Or they can treat the whole EU as one region, with the same prices and codes.
---
Speaking of Germany, depiction of Nazis is illegal there. Does Valve now have to make codes for games where you kill Nazis work if a Gernam bought it from elsewhere?
---
&gt; Its just CCP and Steam being lazy. 
---
Possibly valve wanting to make a big ruckus so that the EU climbs down from this extremely stupid policy.
---
That wont be able to alpha a pod
---
When players were being interviewed to join our corp the ceo would talk to them via text chat and at some point the player would be asked their country of residence and native language. The convo would be referred to me and i would select spelling/ grammatical errors or strange uses of synonyms that would imply the persons mother tongue (some languages put the verb after the adverb or vice versa etc., a "pretty good" speaker might still make some of these mistakes when forming more complex sentences). If they seem to by lying I would refer the user to other people that would go more in depth into the user behind the character to figure out if they were a spy. apparently i was fairly accurate. 
---
my most proud moment was when our french and english speaking ceo sent me a convo of someone who claimed to be from america. She thought they were american and their native tongue was english. I expected them to be a french or spanish speaker and was correct. the person was a french spy with really good english skill but still preferred english-french homographs over more common english synonyms.

Where are you going to be using it?

Inclusion of Tyler1 got me. Well done dude.
---
&gt; You can not have AND regional pricing 
---
I think you are missing a word?
---
Get it out of the way. Afterwards you still have options to ignore, apologize to or growl loudly at anyone who complains. 
---
But why would they increase the prices globally, if EU just wants a single price for countries within the EU?
---
It means you've finally made it.
---
But why would that affect other countries?
---
are you saying you deleted your whole account, SP, isk, and assets just so that you could remake the same characters using a different email and account login username?
---
no one should ever even see your username, you can change your email.
---
BURN JITA
---
I like doctrine ships on contract because 
---
a: i sell on contract  
---
b: i am an idiot and often have to buy ships minutes before undocking. 
---
C2 and c3 mean less isk than C4 and C5 no?
---
At this point, it's probably a good idea to optimize costs and farm brain goo from the accouts that the player doesn't need to actively train, because that's exactly what every Delve mining drone is doing. 
---
I didn't understand anything 
---
But thanks for your pov

in Australia a sub is about 1 cinema ticket. seems like you were due for a price rise.

Noob question but why is the Loki so good? I've used it and it's funny to fly it but I don't see any highlights, I even worry about the low amount of tank most of the Lokis have

Last time I looked (may have changed since), the Jita / Perimeter combo was hands down the most dangerous place in New Eden, be it measured in number of ships killed or in ISK value destroyed.

Well, it's all about the people I guess ^^

I wonder how many cynos start burning the second something BC+ in size is announced in intel.
---
Woooo what a peculiar activity :o 
---
I always have been reading about spies in this game but never knew that is was going that far.
---
Well, not entirely true since I've read about 1 spy that made an entire alliance fall apart and that played a big part in a war.
---
Hel.
---
 more demand and losses the higher the price

You want to go from A to B. Someone bubbles you with high strength, therefore you use the Microwarpdrive to get out of the bubble, then you go invisible and hide. 
---
Its a space penis.
---
Just use larges on a maller.

another injected noob
---
I haven't looked at price history, but depending on how abrupt the change has been it could easily be market manipulation. That, or somebody is building a stockpile for fleet doctrines.

Thanks for the beautiful comment about me ;)

jesus, i mean yeah if you submit an application to be built in india, it will be built, but you'll get what you said you wanted no more, but mostly less. it might be buggy as f, have horrible memory and cpu usage but it will run.

goon buddies are the best. they let me rat in peace and sell me cheap titans to export.

It was said we could expect a rebalance of shield stats along with the implants, though.

Don't be poor and get a Legion + 6x warhammer.

You will be able to do it just fine. Just not along side dozens of your kin and at the same time.
---
BC plus? They burn cynos when roaming in a kikimora. The amount of hics you come across are insane. They can't catch you though. 
---
I'd say that with so many alliances jumping the winter co. Ship (according to your BR) their morale is indeed slipping. I welcome all our new found allies in Blades and Starchaser.

Samm, it's not too late my love. I know norous has you under his spell, but you can break it. I know you can. 
---
you have to fit hypers to whatever you're using, or some other motherfucker will beat you there and drop a hel on them.
---
The only ppl at risk of getting kicked is FRT pilots. 
---
But you see, Super ratting is far away from being worthless... 
---
It got hit, yes, but it's still one of the best vertically scaling income sources after the patch.
---
What you did isn't "basic fact observing", it's complaining.
---
Sappo's multi-isk r64 moon empire. 
---
The reason why Winter Coalition became so strong in so short time is that we care about line members. We are always trying to make contact line member - high command as easy as posible. Of course it is not easy when you have so many line members.
---
I know that some people will say that Winterco is botting and that's the reason why we are so strong, but in fact we fight with rmt and any kind of EULA breaking. We actively kick players breaking game rules. So this is definitely not factor which made us so strong.
---
TAPI is ignoring their line members. For them new member is just some extra ISK and one ship more in a fleet. They don't care about community and player experience.

 Don't ruin thier narrative bro..

Is it really a bad thing though?

The alternative is round the clock trolling and an all out advantage to the attacker, not the defender.
---
ITT: Reddit retards not understanding sarcasm. 
---
how to alpha troll:
---
- find null incursions
---
- save bookmarks that's way out of dscan range
---
- put an alpha on bookmark when null incursion is over
---
- feed on local salt as they assume you're cloaky camping
---
If you want to do incusions you have to get into an incursion group because you most likely need 40-60 people to run it depending on highsec, lowsec or nullsec. For highsec incursions ships run will cost about 3-6 billion isk. gonnswarm has a nullsec incursion fleet that also allows low skill ships since they can run with capitals, but  there you will only run incursions when they are in or near delve. I would suggest you trying something smaller easier for the beginning. Like try scanning with a cheap frigate or run plexes in faction warfare (this nets you way more money then mining and is as boring as mining).   
---
Just so you know incursions are ment to be the high skill intensive late game pve contend and nothing you can just run with a rather new character with low skillpoints and/or low amounts of money. Also incursionsfleets need you to be online for sometimes multiple hours because of waitlists and you dont wanna just get into a fleet run 1-2 sites and go off again because then those incursion groups may be less likely to take you again.
---
The sides always get jumbled when theres still kills coming in, and theres always at least one guy that calls the poster retarded for getting the sides wrong, today that guy is you.
---
The fact Noraus was neg wallet'd for RMT says otherwise, you can execute a botter a month but it isn't saying much.
---
that's because we are nice and there is already too much shooting on the rest of the subreddit
---
Oh look, it’s the content you pushed my &lt;15 guys off.
---
&gt;As a TAPI line member, I can vouch for this, we are all numbskulls, we are all just bad at this game. but what Idd like to know then is, what does that make you guys?
---
who the fuck cares if pgl cares for linemembers (like me)? do linemembers care about pgl? maybe.. maybe not.. it doesnt matter if you dont like it in test(or another alliance) anymore u can simply leave oO 
---
\#efficencyInAllThingsEvenDeath
---
i think he added one too many ANDs here. the sentence makes sense if you cut the first AND
---
Seems like either A:people were mining, or people were on op. I dont hold anything on anyone, prolly thought we were bait tbh
---
In this care, you are. Try googling sarcasm to prevent this from happening again. 
---
Especially the ones that lose battles versus TEST. Oh dear. 
---
Come join horde, we take in everyone and you'll get tons of content in geminate (plus we give you free ships to go pew pew). Eve seems too tough and boring till you get your first solo kill. When you get the shakes fighting outnumbered or outmatched and manage to win the fight or make a successful getaway, you'll get hooked and there's no going back from that point.

too bad to hear, but just an advice from a country where the same people are disgusted about politics, and they let stupid political party to have a big majority in the parliament without opposition by NOT voting, and now we are facing activation of art 7 from EU because rule of law changes and other corruption stuff, you guessed right, Romania. The advice is: GO AND VOTE, don't let one party to gain full power even if you don't like the others. Forces in parliament should be balanced. Avoid dictatorship at all costs.
---
Sounds like you need a better corp
---
They have FCs? Holy shit, I thought those fleets with no logi or support ships were random response fleets. They are actually lead and formed by a person?

`we fight rmt`
---
Your coalition leadership has bought tons of isk...
---
this is somehow good and not good at the same time. I mean, i come from a poorer EU country, where the medium wage is 500 euros. I have to pay 15 euros for one account. (luckily i have more) Some other guy in Germany or France has 4 times this salary as medium and he pays the same, we are not talking here about doctors, IT guys or top domains of activity. 
---
&gt;I mean Hedliner has high expectations

He should try meeting some low ones before he expects high from other people.

Oh hello Gobbins!

I did get my character back, but they ignored me when I mentioned corpses. 
---
What if I have a social life and a job, but I can still find disposable income to fund five accounts in real cash?  
---
I'm still in a better financial position than the guy that made this thread funding one because purchasing parity makes him only able to afford one if it's enforced he pays £15 a month.
---
EU cannot accept a country with one guy that blackmails 28 countries to release the immigrants on the mediterranean (and using people's drama to get benefits) if his demands are not fulfilled (unacceptable demands). That's one of the problems, then there is the friendship with Russia. Get Ataturk system back in place like it was before, sort out your friends as a country and then you will see. sorry for the offtopic.
---
What narrative do you follow ? WWB was all about grr goons and hate is the reason why 54 alliance join together or Casino War happen because some Casino paid 54 alliance to beat Goons and their "hated" end the very same day that very same casino get banned for rmt 
---
Providence.. never a dull day, few places match Provi for its solo/small-gang/hot-drop/fleet pvp. It does not have the riches, but there is never a dull day.
---
or

Fountain... you can make enough isk to last a live-time (if you dont pvp), and you can go to Fountain core for pvp.. 
---
dota 2 has some amazing ones. 
---
I do care about you, we were just memeing on discord
---
It is actually not. Price to performance, it's the Cerberus.
---
In fleet fights it's the best ship to fly because it got good range, speed and decent damage. Last balance patch have tried to make it slowly into less of "the only option" and buffed other options too.
---
By no life grinding pixels or by real life grinding $ and converting it to ISK via PLEX.
---
Only if you're retarded and fly capitals/supers with your main. Subcap main is required for most alliances, even TEST. Supers require you to have a mandatory fax alt. That's 3 accounts, not 2. I doubt any semi-competent FC would prefer you to just jerk off with your main in your super waiting for action instead of being in the subcap fleet making things happen. So the bare minimum for a standard nullsec line member would be:
---
1) Subcap pilot
---
2) Dread/Carrier alt
---
and for the big bois (or most people who've been around for more than a year of Rorquals Online)
---
3) Supercapital
---
4) Fax
---
+ Additional Fax/Supers as required or the wallet allows
---
Yes, polarize all the things
---
Sorry dude, but you have to get over her. She is just not into you ;). 
---
I highly recommend either Abyssal site or running plex in FW. Those can be run within 20min solo. Incursion is bad idea if you have limited time, isk, or skills. FW is probably the easiest for you and better isk than mining. All you need is a frigate (any will do) and fitting is optional. 
---
just link to the image hosted on your myspace page.
---
Gotta admit it makes for great youtube videos.
---
No, super + fax is mandatory for TEST rest is preferable but enforced.
---
And also fc’s prefer you in super&gt;sub in this case
---
Yeah, I too remember all those fleets where they only called for capitals. No subcaps required at all. 
---
You're an uncultured retard who doesn't get the joke, please come back later when you stop living like patrick star thanks

---
I understand that, but as for a company that runs it's operations from iceland and uk primaraly, the cost for them is the same, if you live in turkey or in japan.
---
That is what I was getting at
---
So you should give them less money than I should?  To play the same game?  How about no.
---
If the other corp is inactive, don't hire mercs to kill their structure. Calculate what you need to bash it and then get some friends and do it yourself. You only need mercs if you expect them to fight back and can't match their forces. 
---
i guess thats why i said that they are fighting WITH rmt and not against it :p. 
---
A caracal is neither a religious name, nor a mythological creature.  Neither is most of the other Caldari names.  
---
Also, people could be hoarding mats to research/build t-2 Triglavian cruisers.
---
Well, I usually fly my Nyx (Nullsec incursions are the best \^\^)  
---
When I was back in highsec I started with a Megathron and worked myself up to the awesome Vindicator. Sadly most of the interesting incursion groups started to require implants and stuff and I stopped flying with them.  
---
Im pretty satisfied with doing the occasional nullsec incursions right now, especially because I see how new-bro friendly the goon-incursion squad is. We always have a bunch of newbie cruisers with us that can even be flewn as an alpha. I really like that attitude - dunno if any highsec groups are left that have a similar approach.  
---
I have used the same email account for all of my accounts dating back to 2010, with zero issues, ever.  Buy a better bot.
---
Your bot probably broke.  12 years of web development should have helped you program it better.
---
Totally with finschii. especially because then they know that someone is interested in this spot. They will get a mail that it has been attacked and such and may start communications from their side. Also why do you guys want to get it done by someone else? just get a few oracles or so and shoot that thing yourself. That would be a great learning experience for your corpmates and you too. 
---
I believe Turkey has some kind of customs union though with the EU. Which is possibly why you're being screwed over. 
---
I only know this because I'm a hardcore Brexiteer (fuck the EU) and every kind of deal with the EU is getting scrutinized to fuck atm in the UK. I could be completely wrong though mate there's a lot of propaganda going around in the UK. So best look in to it yourself. 
---
Exactly that.
---
Hey, what is the music used after the initial clip?
---
Yeah, I work at a company that has a team in India. They certainly can write code, they aren't glibbering idiots, but we keep them off the main product and working on a (non-trivial, to be sure) auxiliary product after poor past performance.
---
read alliance updates, confer with reality, decide for yourself.
---
also reminder that vily is still calling wwb the casino war lmao 
---
Should've been a tank bonus on high sec status and dps/optimal/offensive bonus with minus sec status. 
---
Your alliance updates, pings and narratives are the joke of all other alliances for how brazenly false they are.
---
It is in Inuit mythology. And even if, I agree, many Caldari names are not religious, all other races are, and even without a mythological meaning, their name still hold one
---
What is this loserville, dickswinging, spotty virgin playerbase of Eve I was previously unaware of?
---
Oh well that's ok, I enjoy doing it solo! Thank you!

This looks kinda interesting tbh..
---
To be fair, Bastion was only added fairly recently, he could have been on a break since then.
---
Hey man, before you spend money on that, there's a much cheaper 600M Cerberus that easy-clears T4 Darks and Exotics. If you upgrade to BCSes to faction, it'll clear T5s.

I have a fuckton of T1 ships in NPC Delve from when TEST was evicted in 2013.  Once in a blue moon I JC over and take a thrasher out roaming.  It makes me sad to think I'll probably get a titan dropped on me. I miss my EVE. 
---
rorqual nerf hits the casual miners like me, It will not affect 10+ boxers. I only mine with 1 full T2 Rorq, and my alt can fly T1 Rorq but doesn't have the 10 bil to buy one. I mine since february,casually, just to build my Super and i still have left 182 Capital Corporate Hangar Bay to build which require a shitload of Mexallon.
---
And he started calling it Casino War after he sucked Goon dick like 1 year ago?
---
Pretty sure it was not 'Casino War', when the casino guy was bankrolling TAPI.
---
Where I am from we use And before all examples.
---
idk, I miss old POS warfare a lot but that’s because I was at attacker side mostly and I didn’t had to stront the POS.
---
Sadly old POS stront mechanics gave too much burden to few POS managers, also I know It was pain in the ass and very cancerous system for them, so I’m ok with nowadays citadel timer itself.
---
Personally It would be better if citadel needed repair like old POS, so we can get rid of damage cap mechanics, but Idk how it work in today’s boosh fleet meta.
---
What do you think those windows are for, show?

It doesn’t play tho

no

This has nothing to do with the Turkey-EU customs union, a few days ago someone from South Africa said that their subscription had been raised too.

The music goes the Thomas the Tank engine parody, then Pirates of the Caribbean theme, then Megalovania from Undertale.
---
as long as their leadership seems willing to do the hard thing and crack down on it, i'm willing to extend the benefit of the doubt a bit further for chinese players on tq - botting was legal on serenity, and it's legal in a lot of chinese (and other asian country) mmos

it's a big cultural shift to make. as long as they're trying to learn, i'll forgive the occasional bot super tbh

you are totally right and bots are indeed everywhere, it is imo okay to keep an extra close eye on, and sometimes mock, a group we can consider high risk
---
Excluding W-space, probably Venal. It is has good routes everywhere, varied content and because of how isolated it is, you can make real dolla with a jump freighter.

You know what I can understand? Vast amount of the player base seems to be around 30-40 year olds.

I sometimes TRY to imagine, a 40 year old sitting in front of his computer and typing “Fucking cunt, get fucked. Undock your 5 people so we can blob you pussies” while his child pulling his leg and saying “Dada milk”, and I still can’t imagine it lol.

Comlain to to Erdogan. This is economical and political issue. Not to bw discussed here. CCP might have shitty discounts, but they never increased their prices. I don't know what the fuck do you mean by that x3 times increase?

Cheapest way to pay is 12 month sub. There never was and will be cheaper option. Grinding for plex is waste of time=money.

here we come to the end...ppl quitting cuz cant afford to compete with afk isk farmers from delve esotheria and other null sec areas...smart bombing machs,afk rorqual minning was bad thing for game...add to this safety of null sec trough different mechanics(tethering bulshit while u got a timer,with hundreds of structures in a single system) yadayadyada...

CCP maybe u done some profit in 1 or 2 years since introducing injectors and rorquals,but damaged in bad way the player base...

And you think this is all more likely than the stated goal and actually instructions given to legacy members, which is to raise adms in immensea so they don't lose that space?

any newbro friendly hi sec incursion group will have a low cost battleship. under 250 mill per.

Didn't abyssals like collapsed in terms if isk, because everyone is running them?

Given how simple the Mobile Tractor Unit's functionality is, and that it has to dismantle or fold or otherwise reduce in size in order to fit in many of the ships that can hold it, I feel like that's probably just an AI unit.

Don't struggle with ultra autistic nerd here. They will downvote you (me now too) to shit from their basements.
---
you don't need a battle axe to pop a pinata, so it's better to go with a stick that can pop most of the pinatas you encounter. with other asteros, it's more of a question of lows than mids, and asteros with cap boosters running sites is rarer than magnates with 4 stabs. figuring out what is bait is part of the process of course.
---
fair points about wh in general, i was mostly having fun with the last bit.
---
Generally speaking, I just watch 2 minutes of eve battle videos. But this one, I watched everything. Excellent video!

You guys appeared to have a lot of fun!

How dis 60+ iHubs died unnoticed? Were sold to Goons too?
---
Your videos are always quite cinematic and filled with fun music
---
I'm not a big fan of huge fights like that, but videos like these can still be a lot of fun to watch. [Views like this are special.](https://i.imgur.com/IHpUC2m.jpg) - not to mention when the titans dropped right on you. 
---
Nice work :)
---
Because we can.
---
I want to fight like that !
---
Nah just give them a point defence module.
---
Yeah sure, with about 1-3 spots per fleet so he probably is on a 4-5 hour waitlist then. But if thas worth it is another question.
---
Use Krabbing instead please. 
---
I hate where you are from already. (Not true love you, no homo)
---
That's true, and if you go by FBI statistics you can state facts like like "Black men steal more often", but assuming every black man is a thief is racist and disgusting. The same thing applies to Chinese players, not all of them are cheaters, botters or involved in RMT. 
---
If you see it on here, call it out. Stupid shit is usually kept to a minimum, but there are always exceptions. 
---
I've seen stupid shit called out and downvoted quite often lately, keep it that way.
---
Honest to god seeing all of our guys that came from a fucked up server with nothing and what they have made is pretty fucking crazy. That goes to any CH group not just FRT. They are pretty amazing and to see the efforts of alot of people get drowned out is kinda rough to hear.

Also, fuck the racism stuff I see other alliances that have Chinese throw just say some shit not even thinking about their china bros

a cheap starter battleship for warptome is like 180-200 mil. Train for a rokh (dps) or maelstrom (sniper) then as you get more money you'll be able to use that switch to a more efficient platform.

You can't transfer ihubs at all. The only way to "transfer" them is to self-destruct them and allow the new sov haver to erect their own.

Shattered class three? My man

What kind of implants/boosters do you need for that?

This shit right there is why I refuse to get into EVE seriously.

Because of bad game design from CCP

To bad Boson is so effective. It often ruins the game for subcaps warfare.

Lonetrek. Because it's mashed up against bustling forge and citadels but also creeps into black rise.

I'll have you know that texas law perfectly covers this as it is superior to any other laws

can't steal ihubs boyo

Stain because it doesn't have a lowsec gate

Well ratting in a carrier brings in about 120 - 150 mill/hr , incursions more or less the same in hqs . You can run vgs with a pair of nestors and 6 domis. For about 80 mill./hr still better than vni ratting. And if he saves up for a vindi. Alpha or not you hardly be in the wait list. 
---
It's not that it's $45 for them. It's that the price has gone up.
---
It's not the same equivalent price in every currency. 
---
Hunting in cloaky ships. It may not be the most efficient way to get kills, but the tension of checking d-scan, getting into place for the kill, uncloaking and unleashing hell is probably the biggest endorphin rush I've got from any game.
---
STOLE MY IDEA ISAAC

Quick question, has windpan ever fought a WH fleet before. Like against say an HK,LZHKS,NOVACC,TDSIN or anyone really?
---
Like lined up against an armor fleet with their fleet and had a brawl?
---
Enough people pointed out that it's due to exchange rates. If the regional prices vary too much people start to buy omega in other currencies. Euro and dollar are similar enough that people don't do that on a big scale. It's still cheaper to buy omega in $$.

&gt; actually i dont even voted for 5 years. i dont find any of the parties good for me

You lost your right to complain about the state of your country. In a democracy you just vote for the least bad group if that group is beyond acceptable start a party yourself.

&gt; also even in usa people who vote is like 60 million, us has 300m citizen if i remember correctly.

About 60 million votes for Trump and Clinton, EACH!  Turnout: 55.7%. significantly higher than the 20% you're suggesting. Please get your facts right. The fact that people in other countries don't use their right to vote doesn't give you any excuse anyways.

We live for emphasis!

What exactly is your problem with the EU? I've yet to hear anyone come up with a good reason for brexit. They all witter on about 'sovereignty', without defining what they mean (mostly because they can't, because it's a bullshit argument) or complain about bananas (which is a bullshit argument, which suggests they've paid too much attention to Boris)
---
Another trophy.
---
To add to this, turn on your tactical overlay and it will show you where your ship will orbit which also allows you to see if you'll bump in to any scenery, etc.

you could stay omega by extracting at the end of the month... just no sp gain anymore then

No.

Pirate battleship. Create another account and train it up as an alpha. It takes a good while (but not thaat long) but this way you keep your main free and that alt can then travel with the incursions.

I'm OK with the not warping thing but NSA might have been given a shorter cycle or less cap need to balance the loss of 20% of fighter damage and being stuck in place.
---
My best EvE memories come from living in Cobalt Edge with Intrepid Crossing years ago. There were always fleets up, opportunities to crab as needed, and strategic ops against the old Northern Coalition. 
---
We can argue about that if we did it or not. But I don't see point to do it.  This discussion is about relation high command - line members, not about rmt.
---
If only.

Catch. Nothing objectively special about it, but it just reminds me of the first time i played eve, i joined Brave Newbies and that was our home. It was the place where i learned EVE, combat, exploration, everything. I still do a peregrination to Barleguet every now and then, just to remember. I have some ships there still, that will forever be there. The pride of that particular collection is, of course, the Atron.

Ok I think we are living in different worlds, or perhaps you're just not reading your own alliance's pings.
---
When I say I didn't play for a while, I mean 5 years. I didn't know bastions or mjds were a thing. I really do appreciate people giving out the information; I've got a lot of catching up to do. :)
---
Noob - yes! Injected - no. Haven't played for 5 years, and even when I did play I only did large group PvP and never anything higher than rank 4 agents. 
---
Last I checked "The Chinese" is not a playable race in EVE. So stop making excuses for this kind of shit. No reason whatsoever to pull someone's real world descent, gender or sexual preference into a videogame. 
---
I honestly don't know anymore; when I use to play I never saw gankers above .5, but before I used the bastion for the first time I googled stuff and saw people posting about losing their marauder in high sec space. Since I haven't played in so long I am really nervous that I'm forgetting to check local consistently or just not being cautious enough in general. 
---
I honestly doubt it's because of that EU thing. All the other games on Steam are still regionally priced. If you recall a few years ago PLEX used to be regionally priced as well until CCP decided to have everyone pay the USD price. It's only recently that they decided to have Subs undergo the same treatment. If anything I'd blame CCP for this since they set the prices and the prior decision to standard PLEX prices probably came from them as well.
---
Dreddit is recruiting.
---
Something as simple and expendable as an MTU or Warp Disruptor has systems that'd easily be handled by AI and internal drone services if needed.
---
A deployable like a Mobile Depot is large enough that it might need to have a poor unfortunate soul or  two aboard though :)
---
Right now I've got Gallente Drone Specialization to rank 5, but I don't have any ranks in Amarr Drones; worth it to take the time to rank it up, or just keep using the Hob IIs?
---
Favorite reply so far :P
---
Lmao.
---
Not exactly difficult to see how things go but hey you live in the present and enjoy pretending that any of this going on in the spire is relevant because of you guys and not goons.
---
Or, you know, don’t.
---
Supers moved when the nip ended
---
Yes
---
\&gt;  idk what kind of logic behind that but simply its too expensive for this game now 
---
The new owners need to monetize and pay for their acquisition. Not really a surprise.
---
Actually, if the dude is 40, his kid might be in high school or college. Imagine a guy typing that out while responding to texts from his college daughter asking for more allowance money. 
---
Yeah let's all just ignore the big "armor supers stay in eso shield supers/faxes move op to 08" ping from last week. i've had a character in TEST for a long time now friend, you're not the only one getting your pings.
---
And I am saying you missed the Ping from a month ago
---
Might just. Hell I'll probably just do all the t3s. I can already do all the bombers, covert frigs and interceptors. And that was in the old days where it took time to do all that. Now if you have the money, in game earned or IRL cash, you can just buy and inject your way to "greatness".
---
Trash talking is part of eve, everyone gets it sometimes. The Chinese are prime targets right now since they just had a huge wave of migration from Serenity.
---
Trash talking is what fuels hatred for player groups, which in turn fuels wars.
---
And I am saying we've been farming Legacy rorquals in immensea with impunity, so if your logic is that they were told to move there for safety, you've been failing them. For fuck's sake PGL has had to tell people multiple times to stop rorqual mining in Immensea because they keep dying. Your notion that all the Legacy C-team alliances were crammed into Immensea while TEST stays in Esoteria doesn't make any sense in the context of what's actually happening.
---
They are a meat shield being used to keep ADMs high because the people actually living in Immensea don't use the space.
---
Was, I dont think it can do it any more. 
---
It used to be able to have a ~50% stable 400 dps tank with an x type deadspace xlsb (at the time ~300 mil) and ~300 dps with 425's. its been years so I dont have the fit or the numbers anymore. Enough for solo c3 even though it took a while. 
---
Its pvp fit was better then the rapier as it could bonus its own webs out to like 35 km, had more then double the tank and was similarly cloaky. Sure the rapier could hit 45 km or something, but if it was paper thin and driven off by unbonused light drones it was basically useless. 
---
Its third fit was as the fastest multicommand link fit, it sat at something like 2.4 km/s stable.
---
It was good because of its capless guns, and shield tank combined with the highest base speed. 
---
I dont know what it is like now.
---
When it hasn’t been your week, your month, or even your year
---
Successfully worked up a design that should have 80% of the dps of my Bestgu but costs about 60% more. 
---
On the plus side less module swapping between travel and combat will be needed and the subsystem bay leaves more cargo space.

It already exists. Use your downvote appropriately and the comment will be removed for anyone who flags bad posts below a threshold for removal.

Thank you pro god, just for being you.

why are goons fighting their own pets
---
Welcome back, friend. o7
---
Same thing happened to me. Sub was R$33 (brazilian reais) and Plex was at R$60. By February 28th the price increased 67%, going all the way up to R$55, matching it against PLEX price.
---
I have the same problem as the OP, I barely get R$50 per month and I have other stuff to spend it on.
---
Guess this is the result of BDO's company acquiring CCP. Feels bad and if there's another price increase I'm done with this game, because as it stands it's almost priced as an AAA game in Brazil.
---

&gt;I sometimes TRY to imagine, a 40 year old sitting in front of his computer and typing “Fucking cunt, get fucked. Undock your 5 people so we can blob you pussies” while his child pulling his leg and saying “Dada milk”, and I still can’t imagine it lol.
---
Change the Eve specifics to Magic the Gathering, and remove the kid, and you're describing a guy I used to draft MTG with. 
---
We drafted in a pub which completely open to the public (not a back room or anything). We drafted there from July 2011 to January 2016. When we started, basically none of us really knew each other, it was a disparate group who'd connected through other clubs, facebook, random meets at events, etc, but now we're all friends and mostly still in touch.
---
Then this one guy came along with two of the others. He was basically unhinged. We'd draft (open a booster, take a card, pass, left, take the pack coming from the right, take a card, pass left, repeat for 3 packs then build a deck) and if he didn't like the way his draft was going, or if he made a misplay, or had bad luck or anything, he would start slamming his fist down on the table (and I don't mean a light "seriously?" tap, I mean he would yell - and remember, this is in full public, not a mates house or anything - "you f\*\*\*\*\*g c\*\*t" and punch the table. One time he did it hard enough that part of the table made a horrible cracking noise and when we looked, part of the leg had a crack in it).
---
He was actually the reason we stopped drafting. Our group had shrunk over the years with people moving away and stuff, so we were down the minimum 8. Well one day, I wasn't feeling great (was literally going to the doctors for antidepressants in the morning). I got paired against him. He had a crappy draw and didn't do anything, but in magic, there's a lot of unknowns, so I played careful and slow, killing him over 4-5 turns instead of 2.
---
At the end, he threw a hand of nothing significant down and started absolutely flipping out at me about how I played too slow, how I was just taking the piss out of him, and called me literally every curse I know in the vilest terms possible. 
---
In the end, I was sick of it, flipped out straight back (though the worst curse I used was jackass... you know, because I'm an adult who gets that you don't scream "you f\*\*\*\*\*g w\*\*\*\*\*r, you mother c\*\*t\*\*g jew f\*\*k" (among other things) in public. Dumbest bit of that insult - I'm not Jewish, I'm vocally atheist), and basically told the others that from then on, I refused to play with someone who though a) it was OK to treat me like crap over a friendly game where the top prize was 3 booster packs and b) it was OK to say *that* to anyone (and lets be clear, he was completely unapologetic, didn't think he'd said or done anything wrong).
---
Which was a much stronger ultimatum than it sounds - to draft, you need a lot of product. A single draft can take almost an entire £70+ box of boosters. Guess who was the one putting down all the initial cash to supply everyone with boosters? And who was the one who was committing to doing it in bulk orders of nearly a grand at a time so that we could get boosters for cheaper than normal? (A booster at that point cost 3.50 for a single pack, I was buying them in enough volume to get them for 2.25, and selling them for 2.50, so they were saving £4 on the 4 boosters (3 draft, 1 prize) vs buying them themselves). That's right, me.
---
We took a few weeks off, but the it never really came back. The jackass was out, and the two guys who invited him never came back either. So we had 4 or 5 a week when you really need 8 for the best experience. So that jackass basically killed a 5 year old group because he didn't understand how to be an adult.

I'm happy to see this in action. Racism mega yup be called out as the bullshit it is.

---

---
Eh. This is one of those grey area things, where it falls between racism and legitimate comment about culture.
---
There's no question that Chinese players in general (and not just in Eve) are far happier to bot or cheat than western ones. The same somewhat applies to Russians. And it's particularly suspicious when an alliance migrates from a server known to have zero anti-botting enforcement onto TQ, and then amasses large amounts of wealth quickly by easily bottable activities.
---
Is every Chinese person a botter? No. Is it okay to call them 'arrogant, cunt-mouth Chinese'? No. But is it okay to call out Fraternity and other Serenity groups for rampant cheating and botting, and ascribe that to Chinese gaming culture? Yes, I reckon so.
---
Welcome to ships being balanced. 
---
I loved the T3s, my 200kehp Cloaky Proteus with 16km scram and like 500 dps was amazing.
---
But they were so overpowered, at least the Tengu didnt get as fucked as the Prot and Armour Loki, from 200kehp to 60k at best. 
---
yes, lets never give any group a shorthand again.
---
you know damn well when some one says "the chinese" in eve, they're talking about frt + allies.
---

---
The average Facebook comment section will show you that people are retarded no matter how old they are
---
it's honestly disappointing: the lance was perfectly aimed yet if you look at it he only killed battleships that were already damaged, likely pretty heavily. He did about 20k raw damage to plated bhaalgorns.
---
brb flexing my brightness setting
---
Both. The Bestgu was set up so that the only difference between Hamgu mode and Heavygu was launchers and implants if I felt like using a maximized implanted clone. 
---
Can you post or DM a or some  1100dps fit(s) please because that's about what my old Hamgu could do although I haven't been able to replicate that but you have.
---
The optimal ships usually are basilisk/scimitar for logi and nightmares, vidicators and machariels for dps/snipers.
---
I am starting to think goons load a blue only overview before calling primaries TBH. Last night they massacred the legacy fleet that would have been protecting them from the FRT Petes that had been out.
---
Yes, why not? As I said I played for a 8 years ... Sometimes you want changes something. 
---
Beautiful picture, the different colored bubbles really make it.
---
I assure you logi would not have liked it at all....
---

---
I bet they're fighting over who gets to leave the ship to man the depot, because it has a reinforcement timer.
---
Can't one of your illegal immigrant cousins sent you some cash from europe?
---
Even then, he killed 1 guardian and I think I saw an exeq. And the guardian had already been shot by a bunch of TFIs.
---
&gt;what they have made is pretty fucking crazy.
---
Hrm...
---
Chinese isn't a race.
---
Sorry i overestimated it a bit as it was a PvP fit so was using Pyro. 
---
But 1008 dps with HAM 705 and Rapid launch 1005. 
---
For a cruiser with 25km range thats still absurd. 
---
Stop being such a sensitive little flower.

I'm fully on board with "krabbing" after that.
---
You received a warm welcome though.
---
Yeah, that's the main point! "You were banned because we think you are lying..." - does it sounds funny?
---
To be fair with the way CCP has changed the game it's very achievable without botting.
---
I run t1 abyssal frigates in a worm, and its about the same as vni ratting in isk/h. More active isk making but atleast i still have something to watch on netflix.
---
Still a bit better...ah..probably because you're using 05s I never use anything higher than 03s because of cost vs benefit. And never have popped boosters.

---
That's another point! You always guilty, why? Because you playing EVE Online!
---
It's an interesting concept. What if the problem in Chinese culture were treated like an addicted family member? For example, having the empathy to understand why they are the way they are, and trying to make sure they can't get their heroin/botting program to work. On the other hand, peer pressure to "quit being a cheating fuck" works, but I'd guess most of them couldn't be influenced by English words
---
Welcome to Detorid!
---
What's a victory skip?
---
+5 and a remap, it's not "fir free" anymore since you're losing about 200m per account each month but it's still better than losing 2.2 b each month.

---
Idk exactly when it was added but when I first moved to lowsec I was flying a Marauder with Bastion and an MJD in 2013 sooooo it was definitely a thing when you last played if you were actually here 5 years ago
---
Are you taking into account filament price etc. Last time I ran lvl 4 raging something, the yields were barely surpassing the VNI ticks. That took into account the 600M price of the gila I used, that died on an average of every 20 sites.
---
It is basic maths to me and it no longer worth the time spent to me.
---
Is there a formula about how fast a ship changes its velocity vector / alignment?
---
I'm trying to figure out, if your ship is near its max speed and you want to warp to a point which you're not aligned to, is it faster to come to a full stop and accelerate to warp speed or just hit warp?
---
Threading the needle on the gate ez.

Unless you did it in the 8 years before the citadel patch where the Moros was the best dreadnought*
---
joke's on you, war starts next week.
---
&gt; There's no question that Chinese players in general (and not just in Eve) are far happier to bot or cheat than western ones. The same somewhat applies to Russians. 
---
OK, let's see you back that up with something besides stereotypes. This is almost as dumb as the original post. 
---
You telling this like "it's bad" but WHY? Really - does it matter? Can I create new accounts? Ues I can! It's not a problem at all. Everything were done from one hardware and ip. Nothing were changed for a years (hardware and ip)!

If you take a ride to less crowded regions, especially those crowded by Chinese and Russians you'll notice there are 2 weeks old VNI characters everywhere. Good luck competing for PLEX with those "players" who are able to rat 23h a day.
---
i used a variety of ships.  but yeah, they all battleships
---
WTM is pretty good at having alot of cheap ships and upgraded ships. https://wl.warptome.net/fits/
---
these range from rather cheap 214m Maelstroms,  or 280m rokh,    to the average fitting of 600-800m Vindis, Apoc Navy, bhaal, nightmare, macheriels.     or more expensive (in the Bill), Golem, bargh,leshak,rattle.
---
and on and on.    
---
i'd defenitly suggest trying the Mael first, as its the cheapest and easiest role. once u run some sites (~31m plus 7k LP per 15 minutes on average),  you can think of other ships.
---
Mael is also fairly easy to train into thanks to the alpha fitting. and its a good stepping stone to the Macheriel. 
---
or could try the Rokh/Hyperion. a good stepping stone to the Vindi.
---
Recreation gave me new account names. Im not talking about account linking in eve sites.
---
Does that Lance point towards PGL's next holiday destination? I'm sure he's due one soon.
---
You know what, it's not even worth it. It's the lived experience of pretty much everyone who does online gaming, and if you're going to deny it, you'll ignore or cherry pick any research I get for you anyway.

Just look at Serenity, or recent posts about blatant Frat bots, for the evidence for Eve.

Well i run calm electricals, which i need 3 of. Those together are like 900.000 isk. My worm is 88m which i haven't lost in like 400 sites. I average around 11m loot in a site, which take me about 7-8 min to complete.  
---
One of the main reasons i run the frigate sites is because i dont want to lose my blinged out gila every 20 sites like you. And i usually play eve 30 minutes here and there when i feel like it so i dont have to invest a whole 20 min doing the same site.

TEST one is accurate.....too accurate 
---
Same experience here.  Sub prices were about $8 in Vietnam, which is a day’s salary (8 hours of work).  It’s since nearly doubled to $15 which will lead a lot of Vietnamese players to cancel for the time being.  Unfortunate, but we’ll see what happens.
---
If you dont use implants you'll be paying like 400 mil per month to keep the accounts acrive instead of 2.2b. with +5's it's like 200 mil. 
---
It could have been but I didn't know about either of them. My Eve experience was PVPing in fleets, mining, rat hunting in 0.0 (when i was in a big pvp corp), and doing rank 4 agents. I think the only reason I ever trained into marauders was because I found a 3 bil module out in 0.0 and an rlbuddy sold it for me (we split the profit) and he recommended getting a paladin with it. I'm glad I asked here and learned about the bastion and mjd because they made L4 super easy. 
---
ma de fuck。 test. 骚你女马test

Where is it lazy stereotyping if the evidence seems to support the claim.
---
Yeah, rl friend was really into this game and I kinda just followed him around not paying too much attention. :P
---
4 man drafts are horrible. Sure, you still end up with the right number of drafted cards, but you've only seen half as many, so you just end up with a load of chaff.

fair enough dude well glad you know now they are critical components in pretty much any marauder fit :)

It really depends on what your long term plan is. But starting in eve uni or eve scouts then finding a pvp corp is probably a good idea. What gets you hooked is when you start to realize your plans.

Well our harpy fleet was pretty successful, got a couple of bill in kills, barely lost any people, and I had loads of fun.
---
Also the tidi was pretty chill, went to take a piss, got back to switch target then I went to make a coffee and for a smoke by then I was ready to switch to the next target.
---
But thank god I can’t fly eagles and other bigger ships yet haha.
---
Well if you read his message he stated hes doing around 15m isk per week mining. I assumed he has very low skillpoints. Especially when he asks if he needs to skill into a battleship and buy that thing too. That means carrier ratting is completely out of question and even for Nestor + Domis he will need a couple months of training to make it viable. Thats why I pointed out that he should look into activities with lower requirements.

How Chinese is Lori Laughlin or her airheaded daughters do you think?  I'm sure I could find lots of other evidence of cheating from the Americas to Russia to everywhere in between with some barely-middling Google effort but it'd be pointless.
---
If I had to pick a characteristic of Chinese culture, I'd grant ya that they're (..in a very general way) a step up from other cultures in terms of industrious; they run an assembly line in a way that would give Henry Ford a raging boner.  
---
I don't see it as cheating being exclusive to the Chinese so much as when they do, they're \*way\* better at it, so any whinging about it is just salt.

Actually, being nice to other people and arranging fights at a set time and date, so you can generate "content" for your "professional videogaming career" is what fuels wars, which then get streamed by some talking head. Apparently.

Don’t think that was us, goons had a harpy fleet too btw. But even if it was us I have no idea, wasn’t paying attention to local, I don’t even use local.
---
This could have been more accurate - We enjoy shooting goons just as much as shooting Horde and no mension of Hot pockets?
---
Course its less isk, but way less investment also, and even less work. C2 with statis c3 prints isk alsmot as mush as living in a c4. Just need a group to crash the hole and run the sites.

I would point you to the billion Chinese people that aren't botting in video games. The same as I would point you to millions of young American males playing games that arent toxic trolls online even though a very vocal minority is. Its pretty easy to not apply stereotypes unless you just choose to do so. 
---
kk
---
You are correct, apparently fozzie stated days ago they don't plan any supercap hitpoint rebalance.
---
Years ago, when capital buffer modules were introduced and shield slaves were announced, CCP said they would look at buffer values again.
---
Much has changed since then, including the new remote rep changes. 
---
But, to be honest, i still think they will re-evaluate at some point and adjust capital shield HP more long term.
---
Well, it must have been a little bit to the side or too dead centre. I was on the gate tried to get some range and didnt get hit by the lance when i was about 1.3km away from the gate. Looted some expensive wrecks there and jumped out.
---
Chinese isn't a race, you bigots.
---
I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to fall.
---
Another explaination I've read (Couldnt find the source even if I tried) is how asian culture is much more focused on work, leaving less time for games. People dont want to come home after a long day and then have to grind or farm or whatever before they can have fun in the game. Hence, it became acceptable to buy in-game goods with RL money (Before microtransactions were a thing, obv.).
---
Those who can’t pull out lmao.
---
I did a bad thing, I regret the thing I did.
---
I scream out loud whenever i see gobbins thank you very much.
---

---
With multiple characters! The 5m trainable SP cap means that it's good to specialize.
---
If you fly with an alliance that uses Feroxes a lot for example, focus an alpha on gunnery, shield, and Caldari spaceship command skills with targeting, navigation, and engineering peppered in as well. 
---
If you like to mine or do industry, dedicate different characters to those tracks. You might even have multiple PvP alts that specialize in different doctrines; you probably shouldn't use the same alt for Armor/Drone doctrines that you do for Shield/Hybrid doctrines, for example.

You are going to have to define "best" if you want an actual answer.  For example, SkillU owns almost twice as many systems as goons.

You understand that stereotypes exist about specific populations and context implies limitations of groups right?  
---
Chinese GAMERS are more likely to bot and rmt  
---
Chinese EXECUTIVES are more likely to buy property overseas  
---
Chinese FARMERS are more likely to be in poverty  
---
All of these are statistically accurate. If one is talking about an MMO, he's obviously not talking about 1.5b ethnic chinese people, but the sub-population of those who put in extensive time and effort on games. 
---
And more solo pilots, more small gang pilots, better AT pilots and on the other hand, goons have more rorqs, titans, line members, keepstars and ore mined monthly

Has China shot itself in the foot By batphoning NC and PL? Having them form a large part of the engagement, will the Goon Imperium take notice and involve themselves?

You don't really know how it's set up, so it may not be as easy as you think. Most changes are done without the need for a heavy rewrite unless it's warranted. Also, I could see how it may be easier to use already existing checks that are done than to have to add additional ones that would use up more server resources to perform.

CCP is greedy as fuck with sub costs anyways. If they cared about sub costs they'd have implemented reduced costs for subsequent accounts which are basically necessary (at least one). Think about WoW (which is notoriously expensive) $63 for an expansion per year plus $15 a month for a year = $243 whereas for eve 2 accounts is $360... if you want to use supers/titans then double that number.

お前はばかか？大丈夫か？この人誰がちょと早く助けて下さい
---
It does because race is a generic term so pinning down what you're referring to as "not a race" is important to understanding your point.
---
Japanese and French are both genetically identifiable groups... American less so, but then again when talking about American, Mexican, or European most people are referring to race as an intersection of dominant  genetics of a population and it's cultural expressions. This would be the nomenclature most commonly used and which is most useful for population comparison.   
---
It's a grouping mechanism, it's a useful one, so we continue to use it. If you're like to get into a "well technically", you're going to have to provide an equally or more useful substitute.

Consumers being able to shop around means the end of regional pricing, because only the lowest price matters.  Ergo, they have to consider the value of letting 10k more players from Turkey play for $5/mo, vs 100k European players getting their subs for $5 vs getting them for $15 (1m loss there, vs + 50,000 from the additional Turkish players).  Vary the numbers, but it's going to be extremely ugly for the company if they let the price in the dropping currency become the standard price.
---
If you can buy a Turkish subscription for less than an EU (or American, or Russian) subscription, everyone would do it.
---
Therefore, when a country's currency drops, their online subscription prices must rise, or the issuing company will take a bat at the speed of the fastest dropping currency.1

full stop and warp = (time to decelerate to 0+time to accelerate to warp speed from 0)  
---
turn around and warp = (time to decelerate to 100+time to accelerate to warp speed from 100)  
---
where 100 can be any other number higher than zero depending on the ship, location of the celestial etc.
---
so it's faster to just hit warp, but what's *smarter* is to find another celestial in the general direction you are flying and warping there instead, because this question strongly implies that there might be balanced legion ships on grid with you.  
---
*threateningly shakes orthrus model at op from 56 kilometers*
---
another concern is your new trajectory putting you dangerously closer to the tackle ships, in that case it's better to manually pilot your ship into a better position to warp.

You can make a lot of isk passively. As someone who doesn't have a lot of time to play, I focus on planets and industry for money. At first it was slower but now up at about 1b isk a week for about 1-2 hours of time to update and move stuff. This let's me buy pretty much anything I want to play with for fun.

Learn your stereotypes.
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and bomb to us before we even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
And all.of them fight "content fights"
---
It will handle level 3's with ease, and 4's if fit very well, just adjust your tank.
---
Absolutely manic. Loved the whole thing.
---
don't forget drUncle Sappo.
---
How dare you 😂😂😂
---
I'm surprised it could take 4s - I sometimes have to warp out on my paladin because the rats put out a beating (although I could just be playing like garbage)
---
Any regions with good views of Cloud Ring and Malpais nebulae.

45 Rorquals...those are rookie numbers...

You are not wrong man, take my upvote. :-)

Sure you did sweetie.

Hahaha, thx for this, I needed the laugh. o/
---
Everything has its time, even Rome was once the strongest force and it fell apart. 
---
Hii, thanks for sharing your fit. 
---
A mix of up close speed tank and kiting. I saw one cap stable dual rep fit that could handle 4's quite easily, it just took a while.

nice meme buddy. 
---
I gotta agree with you there.
---
Well, as a new member of TEST, I can read that BR and look on the bright side. At least the losses were to an enemy fleet, not to an AWOX bomb run like in Horde.
---
its the trash bits, there isn't really much in the way of EVE PVE that a paladin can't tank with great ease.
---
Who?
---
Dear Perfect Lance Pilot,
---
Please teach me your ways. Do goons move around less than their pets Tapi? Do you play eve commando? I would like a redo [on my last attempt](https://youtu.be/4Qnrql_Zni8?t=699). Please give advice so I can try again.

Sincerely,

PL has the BEST female gamers. Lets include them :)
---
A couple years ago they lost all of their system sovereignty in The Casino War because of one obscenely rich player paying alliances to destroy the goons. I'm pretty sure they were at 0 systems owned for at least a few months.
---
But they're still a community so they just set their sights on Delve and took that back. Now they're just back to making oodles of ISK and whatever else they feel like, I guess.

You should never have to warp out in a paladin.....
---
I saw a streamer use on on abyss sites early on. No idea what lvl he topped out at tho. Pretty sure it wasn't optimal, but doable.
---
u have thousands of f1 pressin retard monkeys to fill that
---
Those are the culprits, VPN to a poor country buying at their low prices to keep those SP farms going.
---
Don't blame CCP.
---
33, and when I'm doing my eve thing looking for fights, my son is usually playing fornite.
---
At times it's hard to know which of us trash talks more... and hes 8.
---
Not offensive just terribly open-ended.  What do people need in that area?  What’s hard for them to import on their own?  That’s what’s needed
---
We are working on it. But those 10 steps

Who will pay full price for PLEX now?

He's not a "Drunk Abusive Father", he's an "Aggressive Encourager".

I feel your pain, South Africa here, with a bad economic situation and very poor wages compared to the rest of the world I can't justify the cost anymore, will have to switch to SP farm (at least I have that luxury). The wording in the email though...
---
&gt;It is very important to CCP that players in the same   region pay the same price and therefore the Omega pricing is being adjusted   for a limited number of players.
---
He sounds more like an angsty teenager but yeah
---
You see those on every TEST Nightmare fleet. Just screams "I'm only here for the FAT link"
---
This is your brain on Test Alliance
---
WEW LAD that's pretty extreme anger for simply pointing out that anyone who flew a dread prior to 2016 is likely to have a moros capable toon
---
It was probably on lvl3. Deimos is suboptimal for abyssal sites, but in the arena, she's a beast. You can participate from lvl3.
---
once again government ruins everything
---
Because it's not a physical addiction, it's a cultural difference.
---
sure, and that time will be when everyone else starts playing the game as it is, not as they want it to be.
---
goons are only top of the hill because everyone else is sat at the bottom whining about how steep it is.
---
Almost like the tishu failscade
---
a lot of people are ready for kids at 22, sorry for your failings in life
---
oh dude perfect my soup was a little under salted but you delivered thank you
---
yeah that's kind of how I felt, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I keep my hardeners and rep running, but if I don't mjd away they really start to light me up.
---
Solitude. Just a unique place.
---
i am the best so ur safe
---
I started playing a last week through steam and got the email like a few days ago too lol. Rip cheaper subs prices. 
---
What is an abyss site?
---
Whats your fit?
---
Any vid?
---
Is there any sort of video series or 101 course someone’s created online for someone who’s looking to start, but think this game looks a bit massive and intimidating for a beginner?
---
They normally take less pg or cpu, and this compact doesn't. It appears to be identical in all ways.
---
I mean there will be conflicts within the ranks eventually, people will become power hungry, somebody could plan an overthrow, possibly and hopefully as a lot of fun and interesting things could happen.
---
I was with goons for about two weeks, and I felt just like a part of the Zerg, I was nobody, just another person to press F1 if  I could even get a chance to lock the target. Nobody cares if you’re left behind or if something happens to you, just another fish in the pond.
---
Also the super umbrella is nothing special unless you’ve got a ship that doesn’t die in about a minute or two as a regular player their space seems far more dangerous as there’s always enemies roaming, looking for a kill..
---
I don’t understand what the big deal is, apart from everyone wanting to be on the “winning” side..
---
Did they have no hics whatsoever? or just decided not to use?
---
I'm offended, It's 52 rorqs now. Bads are fireselling them because of the nerfs. 
---
well the ghost is out of the bottle  you cant get it back in. but  you could limit its usage with cooldowns. it wont fix it entirely but it would make it much more time consuming and a pain in the ass if you could  for exemple only extraxt every odd week.

Do you run out of Cap? Or cant take incoming damage.

You are remembering to turn bastion on yes?

---
Why not put a cooldown on all Extractors/Injectors? Daily alpha injectors already have a 24hr cooldown, add that to injectors in general and put a 7-14 day cooldown on extractors seems like it could help.
---
Ok, we will call it a draw.
---
Goons have been showing up for timers already lol
---
I'm not cap stable, so I eventually will run out. Right now I only use the bastion if I need to (am getting tracking disrupted or need to mjd). I'm in .6 space but still super nervous about literally being stuck in one spot for 60 seconds. 
---
No. Do you want every frigate that passes through lowsec to be smartbombed? Because with this change that is easily accomplishable with one ship.
---
Lowsec (especially FW) has a thriving frigate meta. I'd like to keep it that way.
---
Right now, you can only smartbombed the least tanky frigs.
---
This didn't need a post, you've been repeating the same thing the circlejerk has been saying for the last 2 years.

It's all fun and games until the MTU AI goes rogue and just starts thieving things all over the place. This wreck is mine... and this wreck is mine... and this wreck in mine... Upgrades itself. This rock is mine, and this rock is mine, your rocks are all mine...., and then just starts tractoring in mining frigates until the entire belt is just a ball of wreck and rock with some newbros trapped in it. Actually. Would pay to see. From a safe distance.

No i just want the UK to continue to exist.

&gt; They all witter on about 'sovereignty', without defining what they mean
---
The ability to determine who can, and can not, enter your country via immigration is a pretty big issue that the EU removes sovereign autonomy from the country on.  The EU's benefits are effectively free and open trade, that can be accomplished without giving into a continental hegemony of germans who found a new way to rule europe without the blitzkreig.

If a third of your commerce requires you to operate under one policy, it makes business sense to apply it to the entire global market than to do contingency based pricing.  Use common sense.

It’s a quiet region with a highsec island. It’s very close to hubs and nullsec. The pirates in the surrounding lowsec do a good job of keeping the riff raff out.

The aspect of the POS sov system which incentivized players in different timezones to meet in them middle was the timer kiting mechanic

It doesn't look "stable" unless you Nos something. But even without the Nos, it'll run for 35min before it caps out. And since you won't be shooting constantly, you're basically stable even if it doesn't look like it on paper.

Their leader Sgeine is a dilusional idiot who thought he could scam mining corps into joining him, force them to produce Apostles at insanely low costs and turn those for a profit to FRT.
---
Only one example of the endless lies he told his members.
---
It's not Skill extractors, its people with crazy numbers of accounts.

It's actually related to the value of the Ruble to the Euro/Dollar.

.. but we won't know if those changes are bugged or not if we don't have anything to compare them to.
---
If we test and it's 12 minutes, then we know 12 minutes to be the new time. But if CCP actually meant for 10 minutes to be the real time, how would we know to report they fucked up?

that explains the dirt cheap apostles on contracts.

You can't just treat the Chinese botters/chesters like they're broken; that's retarded. They know exactly what they're doing and why they do it when they cheat. They want to win and they don't care to get better when there are faster and easier avenues at their disposal, particularly since cheats such as bots and aimbots are endemic to Chinese gaming culture. A lot of these players are coming from an environment where cheating is just one more way to get an edge over the other player.

Can only burn a spy corp once, to bad it was on a play that failed completely. 
---
Yea, I don't get it either. They were only good to help people that had low faction standings to do some lore stuff they never done before like epic arcs etc. They are pointless to use to farm missions due to their expense and limited availability.
---
The only thing I can think of is if CCP has plans to make them available again in future events perhaps, then I could see them having an expiration date.

My gosh. Congrats on the direct hit :) I'm sure you'll have plenty more content to come too.

Please do. We really need more people doing 40 Rorqs and alike. This will bring plex up way faster which is good for the game as it is still way too low, fraction of what it needs to be.

I'm not sure how well that plan of his was actually pulled off though, I remember there being a lot of heated arguments over that particular scam, he kicked a Corp with no notice after they asked to leave peacefully with 24h notice for what I assume was refusing to abide the rules he forced on them AFTER they had moved to the region.
---
The one I loved most was his vision of controlling FRTs rental corps, he wanted to assign moons for them to mine, they would contract all the moon ore to him at 0, he would reprocess it for "free" and only contract all the Goo back, keeping the minerals for himself to make even more of a profit from the Apostle scam.
---
Tfw you drop [one dead corp](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/BSC) and [another drops 2/3rds of their members](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/legitimate_business) and results in you losing a full third or more of your alliance numbers.
---
Makes me wonder what the rest of the corps are made of.
---
Doesnt work for me now, its down?
---
I wanted too. But I thought it best just in general to keep all names out of a screenshot when posting it in public. You know who the responders were :D.
---
&gt; lets not deny chinese bot more often, they didn't have a completely botting ruined server by pure chance you know.
---
Yes I deny this.
---
Correlation is not a causation. Just because the botters you are aware of are chinese, does not mean the chinese are botters.
---
You are just using random stats from nowhere to insult people. You should learn to shut up when you have nothing to say.
---
Not elite.
---
Why are they different coloured? Red is HIC, but the two types of blue?
---
noone said that. It was a mistake, and it was a beautiful bombing run. Our predds did that too many times, it was just due that it happens to us too eventually.
---
Nevertheless, we were on the gate and in a perfect world without we would have easily jumped the gate. We didn't since the world is not perfect and tidi/lags are a thing. This should be anticipated, of course.
---
btw, PGL was really pissed about this mistake he did, and he knew exactly that it was his mistake. But cmon, this happens when you alarm clock sometimes. 
---
I'm just a bit dissappointed, this fight could have been huge, and like this, with the main fleet being eradicated, it fell a bit short. But hey, the war is not over. It was the first alarm clock fight and we lost. Many more to come.
---
That was awesome!
---
It's just an armor wound. 
---
this...
---
this is true

You can come up with any convoluted tripe you want. Chinese is not a race anymore than Japanese is. Race isn’t defined by borders. Is not exactly clear what race *is*, but where you were born or what citizenship status you hold is unequivocally *not it*.

all a cooldown on extractors does is cut ccp's revenue from skill farms in half as people unsub them while the cooldown ticks down assuming a 14 day cooldown.
---
a cooldown on injecting is just going to fuck over new players trying to catch up, who already get the short end of the stick as it is.
---
Fucking love Jebi. I miss that guy, he was 100% guaranteed content back in the FacWar days, even if it was just shittalking in local.

You should read the mails they send, particularly to lowsec PVP groups. it's not surprising people shoot their things.  At one point one of their diplos demanded rent from both TEST and PL in the same day for each having an astrahaus in a lowsec system he was in the process of getting evicted from.

yep

Good for those corps leaving. They should find a better environment to grow in.

---
We did that from time to time. Problem with sealed is that you need twice as many boosters, and considering we met weekly, going from £40-50 a month on draft to £80-100 a month isn't an insignificant jump.
---
God, this is accurate.
---
A good trader never shares what they trade. With that said, if you're in an alliance staging system try to monitor what undocks the most. Better yet, if you know what fleets are commonly called for, that should give you a good idea what to trade.
---
&gt; It's sad how many bots there are, but I suppose that's just the reality of EVE now.
---
if plex keeps rising, expect it to get worse.
---
high plex prices, in isk, means RMTers have to farm more isk to make the same amount of irl revenue - this means botting longer, harder, and on more accounts than before.
---
Thank you for literally proving his point, moron.
---
And all the t3s are Lokis
---
Also rip Falcon
---
I shut down zkill's facebook page for this reason. I got tired of moderating it.
---
Just go to the official forums PvE section, read up on it. A lot before you jump in otherwise you'll be losing a lot of ships and pods before you figure it all out.
---
probably due to overlap
---
A former Red Alliance corporation botting in Red Alliances former home? Why I never. It's almost like I've linked screenshots of the Red Alliance exec telling people not to bitch about bots because it's good income.
---
Those 2 corps weren't getting kicked or cleared of inactives until Jesse had a home for Theran, he needed to show the numbers since he was trying for CE, then TKE and now that, as he says "they are full gotg members", he has no need to keep the dead corp that became NUI. and the inactive alphas of LBUS.

with double reps, one active , bastion off, you have 200 hp/s with 35% damage passing on worst res, so 600 ehp/s - and you are cap stable with 100mn active.
---
in bastion if you OL the reps you can go +- 4k ehp/s with dual rep.
---
&lt;s&gt;
---
Goons are quite literally the epitomy of moral and ethical standards in EVE and they hold their members to the highest of standards.
---
&lt;/s&gt;
---
I mean you almost have to respect that sheer indifference to reality. In a way.
---
I submitted  EBR-174351 about this
---
From what I can tell as little more than an armchair dev, there are now TWO RoF bonuses that the siege module is supposed to apply to rapid torpedos.
---
The first, a -80% RoF bonus to all XL Launchers was already being applied. The 2nd is the new -50% RoF Bonus to Rapid Torpedo Launchers, which is NOT being applied.
---
If you pay attention to the RoF numbers for in and out of siege mode, you can do the math yourself and find that the in-siege mode RoF are 20% of the out-of-siege mode RoF. It should be 10%. 
---
One thing they \*could\* do if they can't get the bonuses to stack properly (which, considering I compared the same HAW Nag fit on TQ and SiSi and still managed to lose \~10-15% DPS, seems likely that the regular HAW weapon bonuses aren't stacking properly either) is add a specific damage/RoF bonus to HAW weapons, and then limit the currently-existing damage/RoF bonus to the other XL weapons.
---
Objectively true statement gets mass downvotes
---
Double prop MJD+MWD Rattlesnake or Navy Scorp are far more flexible then marauders with bastion and can do all L4 content including all epic arcs completely solo. Cruise missile set ups are super easy to get 1k+ DPS at 100+km, so you can just MJD and start shooting. 
---
The only things you will need to warp out on is maybe 2-3 fights on the last battles of epic arcs to regain cap or HP, even then its doable without warping out, just safer if you do. You can also omni tank them for 130-140k EHP with 78-88% resits across the board (cold, 90s and even more EHP if heated) and not have to do any refits whatsoever between missions of various types, only time you need to dock is to change ammo types if you loot cause of cargo space limitation, that's it. 
---
Really no need marauder, you are just slowing yourself down and wasting ISK on hulls that are more expensive then many fully fitted ratting carriers.
---
The dust has not yet settled into orbit around J220924’s K class star.
---
Shards of mangled fulleride enhanced metal litter the system, remnants of the fierce battles that took place now over a week ago. Pod goo and frozen corpses drift amidst the wrecks of Stranger Danger’s carriers. ~~Hundreds~~ ~~Thousands~~ Millions of torn sabre hulls litter the horizon, and all bandwidths echo with the desperate calls of stranded crew, surviving upon the last shreds of power in their life support systems.
---
Hundreds of thousands innocents have perished along with Stranger Danger’s fledgling space empire, and millions more are left stranded in deep space, out of reach of High Security space. The few remaining Stranger Danger capsuleers cower amongst the last remaining citadels, scrambling to salvage whatever remained of their possessions, and giving no thought to the plight of their subordinates. Why bother with rescue, when the manpower needed to rebuild can be cheaply bought in Amarr? ([https://evepraisal.com/a/lt81u](https://evepraisal.com/a/lt81u))
---
Amidst all this chaos, a single undeniable truth emerges:
---
**Inner Hell’s AARs are of questionable narrative value.**
---
This is why here at Stranger Danger, we have opted to provide you with an ARR whose medium transcends language, and whether you are English, Russian, or hell, even French, you may understand how this eviction unfolded in a single look.

Meme-ing aside, I kinda figured it was something like that.

Though, I mean, tfw you have to misrepresent yourself to get anyone to take you... :P

Where did grape inappropriately touch you for you to hate us so much? F.
---
I have taken this ship and fit too.
---
Thanks!
---
Lol I don’t hate you guys.
---
I just like making fun of people who have zero foresight.
---
Then again you guys moving to period basis this fall will probably be nice change of pace.

this is the true BR
---

:thonking:

period basis has been botting space since forever
---
Wew.

If you think me joking about you guys being bad at the game is me hating you, wait till you hear what I have to say about people I actually dislike.
---
Stop stealing the ihubs gon. pepega
---
Oh no, not bad words. Please, spare me.
---
Sgeines' (Theran Exec) disconnection from reality is nothing short of impressive, imagine the will power required to keep yourself *that* dilusional.
---
/u/Striker_Eriker I think your bot is broken.
---
I mean, I think you're broken. But hey-ho.
---
On an individual level, not much. The core difference is that cheating is a culturally reinforced behavior in Chinese gaming culture, meaning they're more likely to have tacit approval from their in-game support network even if said network is publicly against botting, assuming it's dominantly populated by Chinese nationals. 
---
It's pretty common occurrence that online games seeing a surge in activity from China also see a surge in the prevalence of hacks and cheating. PUBG had to deal with their own fiasco not too long ago about this very issue, other MMOs like WoW have been dealing with it for years.
---
I guess I should mention that this isn't strictly a Chinese thing. Venzuala has a pretty prominent botting/RWT culture as well. When the nation wide power outages occurred there you could tell when the power was on or off by checking prices/trade volumes of certain items on Old School Runsecape's player market. 
---
WTF Toxic
---
I got yelled at last night for not being aligned cause I was spamming local.
---
I guess I am because nothing you’ve said in the past few posts has been remotely coherent.
---
I’m pretty sure at least one of us is having a stroke.
---
This was organised by DCPI. We called VOLTA for initial tackle and neuting power. 
---
nice! thx. o7
---
rip them out before your explosion so your Zkill won't look that bad
---
Well, it's not my place to say but English can be difficult as a second language. But don't worry, you will get there.
---
No I’m pretty sure that one or both of us is having a stroke, because no amount of ESOL could explain the context of your comments.
---
Well I don't think that's very fair to stroke victims. They're definitely more coherent than this.
---
has nothing happened since the test super move op? gotta say, that's some considerable restraint.
---
there's been a lot of really painfully dumb move ops lately
---
We've been skirmishing with Provi with Rekking crew. Some pretty good medium gang fights. Bunch of small gang roaming. Whaling through wormholes.
---
You have to balance that with probably a significant amount of plex entering the game economy at discounted rates and thereby driving down the RMT value of plex/isk
---
Without that downward price pressure I suspect the incentive for RMT will actually increase
---
&gt; the solution to rising plex prices
---
Plex prices do not need a solution though.
---
Why did you type the same thing twice there?
---
I simultaneously want to upvote and downvote this. Take the upvote for being a new pilot.
---
They have a 10 minute timer, just log off on them and kill them all like we did a couple weeks ago.
---
Catalysts, Thrashers, Tornados and sometimes Taloses.
---
Nah, WTM will accept a full fleet of newbro bships afaik. Purely first come first serve.
---
&gt;they were stuck in the gate tunnel taking the gate, traffic control essentially killed them. awesome bombing run guys :D
---
Welcome to EVE, friend. o7
---
Fair enough. Not really the discussion point though
---
chicks don't dig crying, dog
---
You're giving TEST waaaaaayyyyy too much credit.

Lately I believe "skill farming" would have been at a monthly loss. 
---
Just wait till you find Jita for the first time! Its our super-store!

you werent friends
---
Damage Control II
---
I really like period basis.  The logisics are hellish, but its got readonable access to delve/fountain, and smugglers gate out towards the southeast.  The outer systems of EVE can be crossed pretty quick by gates.
---
Really, it just feels safe to me because of the remoteness and limited jumpsrive directions.
---
I made exactly the same post when I first started, the community IS amazing when you ignore the few toxic people.
---
It’s an amazing game, with amazing people and so much to do.
---
Home region is where you have multiple perch bookmarks on gates.
---
Home region is where you have also a lot of bookmarks from fights happened years ago.
---
Home region is where you don't set autopilot when you start moving systems.
---
Home region is where you also roughly know JDC V ranges.
---
Home region is where you probably still have a few forgotten alts docked or in space.
---
Home region is also where you have ships and loot scattered out in stations like nowhere else.
---
Home region is where you still buy a few overprices modules, instead of ferrying down from Jita.
---
Home region is where you can check local and see someone you forgot about 5 years ago and still know what he is most likely flying.
---
For me, it's Placid.
---
Have returned to Eve after about 1.5 years (this time) away. Apparently before I last logged-out my main... I bought a bunch of PLEX and sunk the rest of my wallet iskies into buy orders escrow.  
---
The PLEX I'm kind of pleased I bought!
---
Hundreds of millions of Plag varieties not so much. There's almost tens of billions of my isk just sitting in-station all over the place in the form of rocks. I have fully skilled Plag refining and a 4% implant. Now what? Just get in a shuttle and find a central-ish point to reprocess? Highsec tops out at 54% for T2 repros, right? How can I reliably link-up with reprocessing in low-sec, WH, or Null? I used to just reprocess at my own Astrahus. It's no longer with me :(  
---
What do I need to choose to do here so that I can squeeze out a bit of margin on selling the reprocessed mins (in a hub dump or bulk sell orders)? I recall that third-party tools weren't too accurate for me. Especially any auto-filling of regional pricing. I'm after Mexallon pricing, the only real value from the Plag.  
---
I've forgotten how I used to do this profitably! I need to get Moon/PI up and running again too.
---
I remember the bulk reprocessing margins being kinda thin for sure. 2-5% net isk profit usually was good, I think? It can be turned over (compounded) as often as your alt can set buys and make cleanup trips.
---
Am in a freighter in 10 days and plan to use that to clean this damn ore up a bit. That helps too.  
---
Is it worth scooping up all this rock and reprocessing it? Somehow? Or do I just fire sale the lot of it, eat the loss, and move on?
---
Not sure if the Disqus thing on zkill was a security issue or a moderation issue (or both) but I'm happy it too is gone. But I will request a Tryhardglavian upvote button to click after I click the trumpet.
---
A pair of nishoggar kills in the sv5 pipe on catch in the days before the proboblocs catch offensive.  Right before the dominion patch.  I had a ferox and it was majestic.  
---
As a Goon: If you have Proof someone is botting, you are allowed to shoot him.
---
It's strange that, with regards to immigration, the UK never implemented the restrictions that it was allowed to, under EU law. They just whined about it. But you wouldn't want to call them disingenuous, would you...
---
Literally carrying the EVE Online streaming community. Dude does good work.
---
&gt; Continued integration
---
Any particular examples? I wouldn't want to put words in your mouth, if I'm going to disagree with you.
---
Eve players will go to *incredible* lengths to destroy each other. Subterfuge, infiltration, character assassination, economic and grand-scale exhaustive traditional warfare. Years are devoted to the downfall of virtual enemies.
---
But they will bend over backwards for a fresh-faced newbie.
---
where do you see crying?
---
Short version of why they're in jita, rather than elsewhere:
---
Jita's the main trade system. These days, it's the main trade system, because it's been the main trade system for years. (There were reasons in the past, which have mostly gone away. But there's inertia which keeps it that way. People don't want to move :D ) It's not something CCP have decided.
---
thats crazy, nobody has ever bombed a fleet before congrats lol!
---
yes and the solution is not to remove them its to limit the number of accounts that people can have, and I'm not suggesting 1 account per person this isnt that kinda game, but people with north of say 5 accounts yeah that should be kirbbed.
---
Say hi to [Xi Jinpooh](https://www.cagle.com/taylor-jones/2018/08/xi-jinpooh) for us!
---
Essence. 3 pillars are so pretty.
---
Haul it to jita and play the market if you want to get the most out of it. Youll take a hit if you firesale it. He other thing to do might be to build stuff with it.
---
&gt; The core difference is that cheating is a culturally reinforced behavior in Chinese gaming culture, meaning they're more likely to have tacit approval from their in-game support network even if said network is publicly against botting, assuming it's dominantly populated by Chinese nationals. 
---
People have said much the same thing about Russians for years. While it feels like American botters differ insofar as they think it's immoral for everyone else but there's always some reason why it's OK for them.
---
The words and the speaker clearly don't match
---
“Real Men Hull Tank”^TM
---
Yes because reproducing is a sign of success.
---
I'm not sure your sample size of just your sister is enough for you to make that call.
---
That's a relatively expensive FAT link. Just fly ewar/dictor if that's what you need.
---
Also Amarr, it has mostly everything, although deadspace/faction prices might be weird.
---
Skill farming hasn't been particularly profitable for ages. +/- 100mil a month roughly. 
---
The people that hate them are 'trained the hard way' (lol) and are bitter that time no longer gives them an advantage.

---
[Accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee5UcAOSPqg)
---
... unless they are also a goon or are paying goons, in which case deny their existence.
---
It was slightly a moderation issue and mostly Disqus showing some really fucked up clickbait and inappropriate ads for a gaming website.  Plus, their price of $99/month for ad free wasn't worth it. 
---
Haha! A lot of people hate you suicide ganker dudes but fuck 'em! Shit's fun. Have fun, welcome to Eve.
---
facebook comments are nowadays way worse than youtube. really. so preposterous. mostly because ppl on youtube are jsut random while on FB act like they are some wise wizard from the top of the mountain.
---
it was data privacy issue.
---
PGL was really pissed about this mistake he did, 
---
I notice we hear this after every fight.
---
or maybe they did what every other alliance does and did some house cleaning of inactive players.... nah that's just crazy talk, must be a full-blown failscade and they won't exist in a week. Only time will tell. 
---
Goon we're always going to be there. It's the only reason test had the courage to form.
---
And evicted Hard Knocks, own half of Fountain,  masters of stukas, owners of many many titans and supers, winners of the largest battles last year and have CSM Brisc Rubal!!!    
---
I think they are doing alright mate. 
---
Their feelings don’t care about facts I guess.
---
I've never had anybody talk to me or go out of the way to try and start a conversation with me.  I honestly don't know where these people are in the game.  Just have people coming to kill me and then saying 'get rekt' like they didn't just blow up a new player.  Pretty funny in retrospect.
---
nahhh, but the only fights you here about PGL, are those where he is pissed. So, simply an information bias.
---
Also, usually he is pissed about mistakes of others, like this morning. where I totally understand him: 20% of players died useless to either warping too late, not aligning or simply bringing an AB to an MWD fleet.
---
But well, it's the start of the war, we are all a bit rusty. As is FRT and any other party involved, single fights don't matter, the long run does.
---
One of the best things in EVE is just how short the average players memory is. 
---
Absolutely.
---
And is lacking in a good number of the rarer skins. But it's not Jita so that's a big plus!
---
Nah we have others 
---
I personally am a fan of LSIs and Extractors. It's rather amusing killing someone who is flying a capital or shiny ship that they have no clue what they're doing with. It's always been fun to do this, but with the change it's much more common.  I've been playing since 2003 off and on over the years and for many of my characters they were "trained old school". Didn't mean much in the long run to me. One benefit of training the long game is that it provides time to learn what you're flying and how to fly it. 
---
I'v had that happen to me too. Super annoying. I always split coms and game audio, is pretty damn useful actually. But sometime OBS decides to not record one of the channels. 
---
Oh no! Somebody might be quilty of crimethink on the Interwebs! Call the thinkpol!
---
What are you on about? 
---
ah fair
---
This post left a "code is good for player retention" bullshit aftertaste, so i really doubt this is a new player. 
---
I'm in the Imperium. Please kill all bots, they ruin the game. 
---
EVE Online should be a safe space and people’s behavior should be policed.
---
I'll go to Amarr if it's significantly more convenient and I don't need anything shiny. Otherwise it's worth the extra jumps to hit Jita.
---
Jesus that p3 fight was so annoying... DD aims kept bugging out and disappearing. We got so lucky there but we found out how good Titans and supers we're in the current state.
---
I love how both side try to spin this shit "nah your side are hiding bots, no it's YOUR side who are doing it" let's be realistic, no one is hiding them because no one want to give a fuck about someone who do illegal stuff and will come back with a freshly injected character if you ban them/kick them from your alliance, best case CCP got their account and it will take few weeks until they re-apply worst case they dodge CCP ban hammer and just join another renting program, you want to get rid of bots ? Fine, ask CCP to add more mechanics to farm them, we can't get rid of them, let us at least have some fun. And by this line I mean the exact same nerf carrier going to receive : if you NSA you can't warp away (which can be counter by having 2 sensor booster fitted which almost do the exact same thing and mostly only nerf real player but hey). So please, for the love of god, stop fucking make Botting a political issue, if you are a director of any entity, you would know you don't have the tool to fight them (nor the whiling to do so, it's CCP job, not player job)
---
Refugees are welcome.... convo me
---
Excuse me, but what does this booster do and why the expiration date, so many months in the future?
---
Yep. But they were supposed to be replaced by good honest goon renters looking to "begin again in the off-world colonies."
---
Instead it's the same sad old Red Alliance bots,  now paying their taxes direct to goons. 
---
Ah well.
---
CODE is trash. Ganking has a place, but just ganking for the sake of ganking is trash content. 
---
in the middle you have stationary bubbles, at the bottom of the picture you have dictor bubbles mixed with some links, on the top you have purely links
---
We were on one of a million SF structure bashes about six months ago and had some test capitals in fleet along with with the mixed legacy caps. FC repeatedly told all caps to make sure they flagged warp exempt. When he warped the sub caps off, Brave, req, DW, and evictus caps all stayed put, aligned. Test caps? Not so much. At least now I know it was because they were dino spamming.

I found it really fun, you can join us if you'd like! They said pretty much anyone is allowed to come, no matter what group you're in.
---
I didn't even know the scale, all I know is these guys kill hundreds of dollars worth of stuff and it makes me feel like I'm contributing to something that has an effect on the game. The guys are super nice and told me they're the villains of the game despite being super nice.

what if mtu could tractor pods out of enemy fleet shiips?  nice weapon!  you have 100  machariels at ur citadel. u jump 00km away with orc,deploy  hacked mtu then watch fleet of abandoned ships and  your mtu  has tractored all pilots...all u need is now smartbomb and u won the war.

what about containers?  they have  lights  burning indicating they have power source,now we know that all containers are lighted up. ..

I respect your sentiment. However, the purchasing power parity Big Mac example does not apply to a service that's virtual. A big Mac in each country is sourced locally by the franchise and its ingredients have different costs worldwide. Where you're connecting from has little bearing on what it costs CCP to provide you with the service.
---
It sucks :(
---
look at what sells in the region compare to jita  : look at the items with the lowest trade rate (item/month) in that region compared to jita.
---
Of course a trade hub is supposed to sustain itself, so basic items (tritanium, fuel, etc) must flow with an adequate price.

I've killed more than 200 of this guy VNIs since December. Reported all of them. I guess CCP is playing 4D chess trying to get to the owners and shit. BTW he upgraded from 3 systems with 6 VNIs each to 6 systems with 8 VNIs and salvagers each. CCP if you are listening - good job!
---
Have you tried talking to people?  When you've benn blown up, did you give a GF* in local? Have you asked for people to help you fit your ships in Help or Rookie Help?  Or gone to Recruitment and looked for a corp?  Have you gone to a mission hub and asked if you could fleet up with someone?

I think the game has no idea of what is the policy you actually suscribed. It only knows your ship is insured to policy 10 until data X .  So when your ship dies, it just pays you the payout of the policy number 10, whithout knowing it was changed.
---
no.

🙄 go back to your safety bubble, snowflake

and then everybody clapped

that's shitty

ccp can't code it otherwise unfortunately 
---
  If monthly sub was 5 bil in PLEX I'd say maybe it's rough on people to farm that  but we're at about half that and we even have passive ways to farm isk.Also CCP makes more off selling PLEX so don't feel bad for using it.
---
Yeah that was me.
---
I didn't see the the any targeting on the overview, so I assumed I got smartbombed.

Also I know what I did was foolish but I was bored and lazy so I guess I deserved that.

 You should step away from mining and get some combat skills done.Mining pays very poorly in general you'll amass more wealth if you went for tiny DED combat sites in highsec.

How are you sure they were not just playing the long con.

 With everything needed to go boom boom
---
No.  read your insurance policy.  it is ESTIMATED payout value.  Not guaranteed. 
---
You're the one who suggested causality between recreating the accounts and getting banned.
---
&gt; And now when you think "I will simplify this! Recreate my accounts using one main mail" - you will be banned.
---
Sounds like you're just trying to justify being a dick.  If you can tell me how a dude bumping my Procurer for over a half hour, not letting me mine or even warp, just spamming about needing a license, is anything other than being a dick, I'll listen.  Maybe instead of making someone quit, you could join in engaging gameplay and invite them to join you instead of just shitting on their sand castles and pretending it's good for the game.
---
I log in once per 6 months, am I in right place ?
---
Yeah, we farm them many times. They'ra already reported
---
Yup. It's common for botters to try to cause as much damage as possible when they get banned, because they hate EVE and only want to exploit it. Looks like a sockpuppet to me.
---
 Malpais because I like Rogue Drones faction and it's their ''true home region'' also I still dream of the days the rats dropped alloys
---
&gt; Having them form a large part of the engagement, will the Goon Imperium take notice and involve themselves? 
---
You are trying to argue Fraternity shouldn't have batphoned for fear of triggering an Imperium response, yet [https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/QtrAh6DovR4hZetyW](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/QtrAh6DovR4hZetyW) shows 550 Imperium. Oh, right, they were neutral third parties who just happened to be in the area on a casual stroll and staged off a TEST Keepstar.   
---
Also, you seem to assume the TEST narrative cares about reality.
---
mittani unironically said don't report blue bots, and it's bluefucking
---
bro bastion is what makes the paladin good..
---
in this case the estimated value is significantly different
---
 You say you could buy a character sure but it wasn't perfectly made for what you wanted and had to search a bit or buy one and polish it yourself in a bit of time.
---
  There were no skill farms and people only made batches of say dread alts to sell when CCP had stuff like sub for 6 months get 2-3 months free which was very very rare.
---
 So to shift a large population of players into x y z ships took time  rather than isk overall.
---
*OwO, what's this?* It's your **6th Cakeday** ZipSlings! ^(hug)
---
Maybe its an inside joke I dont understand, but hallowed is the word you want for showing reverence. 
---
True. I could let the jobs run and go get blown up over and over again in sacred frig combat.
---
Actually sounds like a good time. Cheers!
---
Can confirm [https://imgur.com/a/6Tjd3aq](https://imgur.com/a/6Tjd3aq)  
---
Codespan delivery service content is just stale honestly
---
When was the last time you  actually logged on to the game?
---
I don't do it, but I don't have a problem with it. The most interesting that can happen to a HS miner is to get ganked; that's as engaging as their gameplay gets. They're gonna get bored out of the game with mining and if they don't some bullshit isn't gonna make them quit either.
---
This morning. RL bullshit has lessened recently and I have more time.
---
 I stood in highsec for quite some time did mining and missions back then no one wanted noobs In their elite 0.0 alliances after I built up a bit I started venturing into lowsec researching pvp fits and getting into solo fights learning to dscan by emulating what I saw in YouTube videos eventually I joined a rag tag pirate corp in lowsec .Note this whole progression lasted like 3 years I got 8 more years of stories and progression from f1 monkey and 0.0 care bear to AT winner ,elite pvper ,wormholer, RP enthusiast ,market guru and bitter vet.
---
I was on the receiving end of that lance. With all the tidi that was a superb shot. Well done. 
---
&gt; they told me they kill hundreds of dollars worth of stuff
---
That's nothing compared to things like the Bloodbath of B-R5RB:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB
---
&gt; Total forces involved 7,548 participants. Damages amounted to an approximate real-currency value of $300,000-330,000 USD.
---
This sounds like a breach of contract on the insurance provider's part according to Texas Law.
---
Racism has no place. Wheter here, New Eden, nor outside in the real wold.
---
Lets have some fun and shoot spaceships together.
---
 You can make multiple alpha accounts and specialize each for what you need like 1 is VNI another is your ferox pilot 
---
As honourable hajduk I must fight the turk everywhere he may be.  
---
Joking aside why don't you plex accounts?
---
I can't help but wonder why 20% of his total wealth was composed of CN light missiles...
---
Well yes. Like to call themselves an "elite PVP" alliance. Last few fights suggest otherwise.
---
Thx
---
 Bastion makes you immune to ewar and has other benefits also
---
L A N C E R B O I I S
---
Thank you for taking the time to do that.
---
If it looks like bait and smells like bait it's bait; even when it isn't.
---
Things needed killing. Us included ...
---
&gt;mittani unironically said don't report blue bots, and called it bluefucking, then he backpedaled into "cause CCP incompetent hurr durr"
---
Wow, you went further than the average who only saw the edited video, but your level of "grr-goons" but what you doesn't say is your quote was said in the same sentence as "don't report bot" this is call "being an active leader explaining why he said such thing". I know in Ph you don't really get this leadership working with their line member, or even "active leadership taking care of their member" but well, don't worry buddy you will get it one day.
---
HTFU
---
These are all niches within niches that very few people in game use and which can be done better if you just decide to swap a weapon system or tank type or cloak. Remember Proteus is competing not just against other T3Cs but other ships too.
---
For general gameplay its still crap and I stand by that. And this is its biggest problem. It needs to be competetive in some major roles not just the ultra niche.
---
I loved flying with my hull tanked Algos.
---
How many do you need to kill a pod? What about a large med combo?
---
If you want max DPS Tengu go polarized ham with scourge missles. with 5% ROF and DMG implants + boosters you'll hit 1400+ cold kinetic DPS, overheat to around 1550-1650 range, I can't fire up PYFA right now so dont have exact numbers. But I think its still the highest possible DPS you can get on a cruiser sized hull in the game, or pretty close to it.
---
How is killing the haul of some other guy’s hard work justified just curious 
---
Awww bless you.
---
Init still deludes themselves thinking blobbing HK 100 to 1 was some grand accomplishment?
---
&gt;Just a shame no one likes the drone legion.
---
Drone Legion sub system needs a bit of a buff. Its total DPS is just too low, same with Proteus. If they buffed them these 2 ships would see a ton more use. I think Proteus also needs a bit more cap, not much, or alternately a bit more PG which would allow more fitting freedom to offset the double armor rep cap issues on it. 
---
They are, but he seems upset about suck a Goon dick part.
---
You could probably run abyss sites/abyss pvp? 
---
this person might not be that much of a scrub, they did at least have the right mods in their cargo hold, probably move fit it, then never checked it again.
---
Some of us are also bad at the whole selling thing, think I have about 1200-1500 BPCs from my abyss running split between my loot cans and Jita stockpile that I’m too lazy to sell.
---
Same goes for ZPC and Isogen :)
---
This is a typical item that illustrates CCP should NOT add creative item in events before they really know what will be affected by it. But it is impossible, EVE is complex and CCP only has very limited time to design it as they need to have those events on time.
---
So let us see what happened to the Impetus Glamourex boosters.
---
What is supposed to use it for?
---
Casual players boost standing with less time.
---
What is now using it for?
---
RMT groups/insane players are using it to maximize the profits, forcing casual players stay away from the missions which used to be  profitable.
---
How does it work?
---
Missions have been adjusting for years to be balanced. For L5 and burner runners, they reject some type of missions and only do certain type of missions. Sometimes they will reject several missions in a row to avoid some missions which are low profitable/wasting time, as long as they have enough standing to request next mission.
---
And this booster only boosts increasing standing, does not apply on decreasing standing when rejecting missions, so runners can be more efficient in farming LP.
---
But why is it only good for RMT groups/insane players?
---
Because once you consume, it will last 2 days(max skills), you want to be max efficient? just non stop farming days and nights for 2 days.
---
I am pretty happy that CCP is working on it, but without much information disclosing, it seems that everyone hates this change on Reddit.
---
INIT USED to be about being a smaller, mobile, mostly unaffiliated PVP group. I don't care they joined goons for being goons (although historically it doesn't mesh well), it's about them joining the blob.
---
That is easy 1 of the best lances i have ever seen
---
Dunno if anyone posted this TEST post and how they will be fighting The Rest of Eve (TM).
---
This 1000 this.
---
Lol Sgeine and his empire still waiting for him to come shut my Corp down after booting his salty self from our Corp couple year back. Nice to see things going well for you Sgeine. 
---
My mother said words don’t hurt...but this meme’s words... THEY 😢 hurt 
---
Why is it a bad post?
---
but... what about the other ones?
---
Fucking flawless kamehameha
---
Sucks to live in the European union. Maybe one of these will work.

you're trying too hard
---
First drive by dd we have seen in how may years??? 
---
The real mistake back then would have been training a pheonix I mean stations could tank speed tank your torpedoes.
---
The estimation is based off the facts (value) when the contract was signed.  There is no guarantee that it would hold that value.    
---
You should put all drone specs to 3 it really helps being able to select damage type as needed
---
"wise wizard from the top of the mountain" 10/10 made me lol
---
It's smug worthy after years of HK: "only the death of eve will kill these keepstars!" *Unzips*
---
Imagine thinking that it wasn't, lawdy
---
++++ BEEP BOOP RECEIVED --- PRAISE THE OMNISIAH ++++
---
Right? Who *doesn't* brag about Command Destroyers V?
---
Was selling them for a 30% margin back in solitude.
---
That used to be like 200 mil worth of missiles.
---
Obviously when I stopped logging in I also stopped updating market orders. Hauling stuff in and out of solitude was quite easy back then because my corp did free shipments betweeen Jita and Solitude. I was making quite the profit with these.
---
Ill buy em for 100,000isk each contraxt arahabaki
---
Oasa, it looks nice
---
otherwise, The Citadel, looks nice and tama
---
It is, actually.
---
In primative societies and amongst animals, yes
---
I think we agree about everything except what empathy means. Empathy does not mean show your weakness or facilitate the bad behavior. 'Kicked to the curb' is ambiguous, but you can probably have empathy while 'kicking them to the curb'
---
that is how you aar
---
Humans are animals so thanks for supporting my argument.
---
lol nice one. I see Eve players are Eve players everywhere hahaha. Keep those contracts for Jita local hahaha.  I may have missed something in the store, ill double check when i fly by. 
---
Hahaha
---
The other guy should have been more cautious, use scouts and webbers, not gone through Niarja when CODE. is camping... He learned a valuable lesson, or not.    
---
It's a game about blowing up spaceships.
---
I see that valueless “edgy” comments are a pattern with you.
---
Get pinged about a bombing fleet.
---
Join expecting to go drone bombing in delve.
---
End up in the east ruining a nightmare fleet.
---
Cheers for the invite chori! 
---
To be competitive in this day of eve you need a lot of numbers and you need titans. Not our fault. We were late to the titan game honestly
---
https://youtu.be/96b7Jk5xCTQ
---
The thing is, they're not making it interesting.  Miner ganks are done in a way that can't be countered.  HS wardecs are about blobbing some poor newb corp with shiny fit T3s and pirate ships.  They field fleet comps that obliterate anything that their prey can field.  I'm not saying  that's not a legitimate tactic, but if you're trying to engage miners, that ain't how.  Most styles of HS ganking are bullying. 
---
 If CODE and the like dropped the act and said "We're assholes who are here to ruin your day purely because we can," then fine, not against game rules, but they shouldn't delude themselves that they're doing anything other than bullying people and hurting the game.
---
But polarized still kills all your resists right? 
---
When I left the only polarized weapon was torpedoes and since the bombers were so flimsy anyway, it wasn't that much of a trade off.
---
Yeah, when he said "don't report botting Goons," what he really meant was "make sure you report botting Goons."
---
If you believe that, you'll believe anything.
---
even F3 can be done with solo blinged frigate.
---
you're late
---
Oh shit, I totally did, my bad. I had just ~~woke~~up.
---
Lol plex is dropping now? What do you want 
---
Check sisters of eve LP store in apanake.
---
Your welcome
---
Hijacking top comment because I'm a Karma whore. 
---
Not gonna lie I was nervous when my Corp joined Snuff
---
/r/evejobs 
---
Praise James, a newbro has found the way. :D
---
If you're happy with the dudes you're with in your current corp, why move on?
---
turty tree tanotoses
---
People complain about dinobrains and init posting but Black Legion's posting is on a cringe level that inverts genitals.
---
You have to include them.
---
 Jita with out its scammers is NOT jita, Nirja with out CODE will made hauling boring as hell and I don't play a game to be bored. (maybe... a little bit... sPaCe tRuCkInG :P )
---
the alliance they are apart of is depressing, there intel channel is absolute garbage. there are many other reasons 
---
Nice should have killed them all. 
---
First thing, he never said "don't report botting goons" either you quote someone or you make false quote that enforce your narrative, if you do the second thing your argument is wrong and bias, come back when you will finish your home work buddy 
---
I'm not talking about wardeccing. I also don't disagree with you that it's bullying; I disagree with your assertion that it hurts the game.
---
x"D
---
So on top of getting less insurance *which is good* we dont get the difference on what we already paid back. I was hoping if they did that they would at least keep the old pay out if you already and it insured. Fucking lame. Knew I should have waited to insur my carrier.
---
Internet larping is fun
---
Simple and easy! Thank you!
---
It results in more people quitting than staying, especially newbro ganking.  If after a month of mining I had my first retriever ganked, I probably would have quit.  HS miners become industrialists and PvPers with a guiding hand, not with a fist.
---
I like how they keep glossing over what to do if you aren't allowed to rat/explo/otherwise krab in esoteria with these things.
