You didn't, but good try.

Or just press the stop button...

Jackdaw is immune to TD and missiles dont need cap.  But the major amarr mimintar alliances have agreed to curb fw mission running by flipping each others systems and not contest until January.  So you cant dock at stations to get the missions in fw space.

Quality video my dude.

I can only speak from my experience. I pvp. I live in a wormhole now. And I go to amamake sometime to fly solo cruisers. I am not particularly good. But I am here cause of brave. I wouldn't be without them.
---
I can count on one hand the number of times we've gone into somebody's hole to fight them, Rage aside. The main reason for that is there's such a huge home field advantage against roaming fleets in WH space that it's hard to win, or even extract without 2/3rds of the fleet getting wiped.  
---

---
Now, the fact that I still remember those fights at least a year+ later means it was special enough that it stuck out mind, so I guess that's saying something, but it's exceedingly rare, you're right.
---
yup. The game (and the lore) advertises it as if you're one with the ship; you literally have a mind-machine connection (through the hydrostatic capsule)...
---
yet in game, it feels more as if you're the commander of the ship issuing orders from the bridge

It's wonderfully dark don't you think? Quite fitting in the EVE universe where I assure you much worse things happen.

oh ok.

Very true.

What's important is not what they're saying, but the fact that they can't stop talking about us. Our relevance bar is maxed out.
---
CCP will never touch local ever again.
---
Great PvPers of eve, please assist me.
---
My goal was to take one fit, one ship, with one engagement range to understand it we'll, but I feel like there's been no improvement on my part.  If you look at my killboard (Elleroth Kendoresh), you'll see I've been flying an executioner mostly and losing.  It's stupid hard trying to find a somewhat balanced fight in FW with a T1 frigate, and when I do take a fight, I typically get trashed.
---
So what can I do better?  
---
Some of these fights are absolutely ill-advised and shouldn't have been taken, but others I feel like I should have won?  Maybe?  Is scram kiting just terrible in FW?  Should I try a brawler instead?  Are people looking at my killboard before engaging me every time, so they know I'm usually flying scram-kite and specifically flying counter to that?
---
Yes you should start as a veteran, or you'll be unable to use your mouse and keyboard.

I  realize it isn’t what it was. It may not be for long, but it’s a game I always wanted to try and why not at least get a small taste before it ends, if it does. 
---
I spent most of the last several years doing the right thing, taking care of family, putting myself last. Even if I’m coming in at the worst possible time, at least I can be a small part of it
---
So I thoroughly enjoyed all the salt from several of the replies, it's good to see r/eve still does not disappoint, but I think some of them merit some response.
---
1. I haven't been killed by Volta, or any of the WH gangs, which mind you I don't particularly have anything against any of them individually, I rather like the WHers coming out of J-Space for the content they offer just as much as I'm sure they do that I am possible content outside the WH.  I just simply by watching what they do see a very clear example of something that isn't balanced, as I said the risks are extremely low for the rewards of being able to take down capital ships of 5-20bil in short succession.
---
2.  The comments about the Mass of the WH limiting the # of ships they can bring and thus no force multiplication:
---
   1. Fair point, however, if this were even a question, I think it would be safe to say at this point, their killboard would sport more than a few fleet whipes (or even more than one or two losses).  Judging by the fact that there is not even 1 Null Sec Alliance or frankly any Alliance outside of J-Space that can boast a similar efficiency, Pandemic Legion being the only one which has a founding since 2007 vs a founding in 2015 I think it's safe to assume that it isn't necessarily the capital class force multiplication that is necessary to bring 30 people through to a target in seconds and get back safely with little to no chance of any significant losses. (you're welcome to correct me if I'm wrong)
---
   2. With the cyno changes to do the same, #1 you're almost guaranteed to lose your cyno ship outside of an empty system, you have to account for jump fatigue, you're limited with the range you can enter in (hence why most systems surrounded by NPC null are the most dangerous), and you have to bring in the cyno ship which either must be logged off in system to avoid the intel bots, or move it through giving advanced notice.
---
   3. It takes 50 minute to roll a hole with no guarantee you'll get the hole of your choosing.  It can take 50 minutes of travel time to get any large fleet into position.  Especially when considering moving across several regions all of which is reportable from intel bots. You can in that 50 minutes of time while you're rolling the hole continue to appear and disappear in other regions moving from target to target avoiding transit times that again outside of J-Space delay any fleet.
---
   4. they don't lose ships to super/titan fleets anywhere near as much as people like to pretend they do. In fact in the last week, I would say it's a decent estimate to say they've only lost 3 in total to supers/caps so the whole "super umbrella" really doesn't play a part, when again, you're out of your hole and destroying 5-20bil ships before said ships can even muster.  Which mind you losing 1-2 out of 30 is about a 3-6% risk of loss, especially considering if you take one look you can notice they've killed at least 6 supers and lost 4 t3c's/triglavian ships....
---
3. Is VOLTA good, very much so, and I'm sure they have very competent FC's and utilize many avenues to be successful like spies, zkill, locator agents, ect to stay on top of their game.  But as I said it's hard to say it's "fair play" when you consider that your risk of failure is 3-6% at maybe 3-6bil tops, and the reward exceeds 20-100bil on average in a given week....  If any other group was as successful at utilizing the in game mechanics I think it would be fair to assume several players would raise questions.  Is it something that absolutely should be changed, I think obviously that's up for debate, but with the statistics its safe to say the ball is definitely in their court when it comes to risk vs reward, or as we in Eve like to call it "risk adverse"
---
How about you understand what is being written and shown?
---
Koreans started piling up on the server only recently.
---
Dude you don’t need to know more because we’re part of it
---

---
Welcome to the game, don’t be afraid to experiment and get blown up. Join a corp and do stuff with people, very few of us likes to play Eve completely solo.
---
Reason to try different things before settling into anything is mainly that we all have different preferences on what we like, and doing these things with other people makes it more fun and engaging.
---
My guess is, the diffrence matches up with their prime time.
---
DAMN IT I HAVE POSTED THIS TWICE BUT IT IS STILL UPSIDE DOWN
---
More bots, great
---
This image is wrong. If it was right, you wouldn't be able to lock pods trying to warp off from undock invulnerability from 0 m/s (which is really doable even now, after all the scanres nerfs). Sometimes it's even possible to catch pods of just-killed ships which spam warp - I did it with like 4/20 success rate on sisi with 14k scanres claw ~7 years ago. Sure it's been some time since then, but I doubt it was changed, and the image is not exactly new too.
---
Personally, i think mechanics is different, According to my understanding, after gate cloak (or maybe any cloak) you have extra 1 second until server sends info about you in other pilots in the grid. Then instalockers' clients receive it and can start locking you. If an instalocker managed to lock you in sub-1s (including double or quadruple the network delay - one way to notify client about new ship on grid, second way to start locking, and then depending on how client-server protocol works to receive notification of locking, as well as sending point application command after client knows that lock is complete), you have a chance to catch sub-2s warper.
---
Chance because even with good ping and fast hands it's still not reliable. As far as I heard, pro campers leave the system and reenter until they can catch sub-2s ceptors more or less successfully. I think it's due to some "event queue" of players on grid/node on CCP side which affects how soon you see objects in space / how soon your commands are processed. For example, if it is related to input, the earlier in the order you are - the faster async communication for your character starts - the faster you receive the result. If it is related to order of processing and if EVE processes point application/warp commands in the same queue - you have no chance of catching something until your position is higher in said queue.

I am one of the RR, it is a fun fight.  But boring and nothing elite at all.
---
Bro, it’s good news but we have to see how well these numbers will retain in korea. I am not pessimistic given players’ attitudes in korea but it makes sense not all will be retained. Let’s hope a fair chunk does!
---
First im pretty sure it takes less than a year to sit in a rorq with decent enough skills for the fit and drones - so not maxed out. You know, i did it. 
---
Second not everyone who trains a rorq will automatically use that one to inject more. I didnt. Do you know what kind of no lifing it takes to do that? There might be some who can and will do it, but thats a rare exception. Mining in a rorq is a mind numbing and soul crushing experience. Its that boring and annoying. If youre using more than 1 rorq its constant moving to the next rock. Its not fun. 
---
Third in order to inject you need isk. Youre making it sound like everyone and their dog is spamming them, they arent. 9/10 people cant afford to spam plex for $, and 9/10 people who slow train to a rorq will not exponentially train 15 more by mining and buying injectors, because they will get burned out. I have only met one dude who did that and i was in goons for over a year...
---
or remove the 'warp at 0'.
---
When I read the title of this thread I thought it was going to be a bunch of newbies in T1 frigates dying to a citadel bomb because they forgot to turn their MWD's off.
---
I'm pleased to see I wasn't disappointed.
---
yeh, sry dude but i won't go through the effort of looking up your KB and searching for any PvE losses.

Chaos Era with a Vengeance
---
Back to Chaos Era
---
I had a quick look at your killboard. It looks like you died to T2 or pirate frigates most of the time. The are significantly more expensive and powerful than your T1 frigate. If you lose a fight you can also talk to the person who fought you and ask for advice. The majority of players are helpful there.
---
Check out https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view for enagement profiles of frigates. Your executioner doesn't do well in the statistic :( So if you are the average pilot you'll lose more than you kill. As a new player you have to expect to even lose more often than the average. The plus side of this is that most people will gladly engage you. If you fly around with a hull that should always win people just run away from you ;)
---
Looks like the normal weekend spike to me. Maybe a tad higher but not much.
---
Bold of you to assume Eve players do more than click approach. I bet most of them wouldn't even notice they were gone
---
Again, do not look at the spike, but at the flat line through the day
---
lol you're right, that would need to be gone too ofc
---
I did as well as post here in case someone had a workaround.
---
I seriously doubt this would have the effect you are hoping for. I've been in enough large-scale subcap fleets to know what effect this would have on those, and while smaller fleets can be perfectly OK with everybody manually piloting themselves larger fleets would become and absolute shit show. And not because the pilots are just *&lt;insert insults aimed at F1 monkeys here&gt;* but rather because it would make the already dicey task of FCing such fleets a fucking nightmare. 
---
This isn't a small 5 man WH gang kiting around a kitchen sink response fleet we are talking about. Everybody doing their own thing isn't really a workable plan when hundreds of pilots are fighting each other in large groups. Fleets need to stay together so that target selection works, so that logis can keep on top of things, so half the fleet isn't being caught out of position every time the FC has to re-orientate things in response to the enemy.
---
It would make large-scale subcap fleets highly inefficient, and an absolute horror to organize and lead, which would probably end up massively degrading their place in what is already a hugely cap heavy meta. - The game already seems to be bleeding FCs at an alarming rate. This most definitely wouldn't help that situation either.
---
Also worth pointing out that failed hacks trigger the explosion as well.
---
There's no regional servers anywhere.
---
The question is what do you want to get out of the game.
---
I played with an alpha account recently and have been having a blast with it.
---
Scanning got me off the ground financially as mission running is a slow grind. I stuck to lowsec though since, despite what **a lot**  of people say, you **cannot**  fit a cloak in alpha.
---
Once i secured a solid funding base I  looked on zkill to see some good frig and destroyer fits and am now having a blast, getting kills and earning good isk through the LP.
---
Production is a hugely competitive industry. Despite what Eve tells you, Blueprints do not print ISK. Find a good lowsec corp to bed you in. Nullsec may seem like the glory path but it can be very boring for low skilled players.
---
I really think it is more about focus.
---
Your eyes can only see so much of the screen at one point, and having keyboard shortcuts helps having your eyes on the field/overview rather than where you are pointing with your mouse.
---
More than modules, I feel a lot of other things should be bound to the keyboard (launch drones, recall drones, etc etc).
---
Probably the most retarded recommendation in this sub and that's saying something.
---
Because Rorquals can do 1.2k DPS with heavy drones, and Orthrus rapid light DPS with light drones, rep more than 1 Scimitar for each Remote shield booster that it fits with 4x the optimal range on shield reps over a Scimitar, tank 30k DPS, Several highs for Neuts/Smartbombs or Links, and it can give 3 command ship links and specifically the shield links are at Claymore/Vulture strength.
---
The sov and jump changes maybe? Then they bought out alphas later in the year
---
Mining while essential to eve economy can be boring, and risky with PvP.
---
To be fair that's arguably more balanced than their mining lol.
---
I just want my battle rorq that could tank a fortizar back.
---
To be safe go 1.99. Having run many gate camps those are not caught, see other comments here as to why.
---
2.00 might be 2.001 which would not be sufficient (i.e. you get caught) or 1.999 which would be sufficient, but really there is no to know for sure unless your in game fitting shows the align to be &lt;2 secs. Those are not caught, even by our 7000 scan res Keres fast lockers.
---
We do have other ways to get them though :D
---
It's like this. One hole will be 20 gas sites, the next will have 15 data and relic sites. Just need to get fast at scanning and moving.
---
Oh look, another 3d print. How exciting.
---
&gt; We do have other ways to get them though :D 
---
Like what?

This is brilliant. Probably a stupid question, but can I dock in an NPC pirate station? Or in something I find in wormhole space? Guessing not.
---
AB where is chessur?
---
Ps. Glad you're back- loved the vid!
---
Most goons aren't triggered in that direction, the common man is pissed pitts got booted. i have half a mind to think this is either one of the not-in-touch-with-our-membership higher up's reddit profile or one of the people that are actually cultishly supportive of mittani(of which there is a core of people who play this pixel game and literally worship the man).
---
Then if he wasn't pulled aside the first time he dropped through HY-, then that's a issue with leadership, since my the sound of it he has done it multiple times without people complaining
---
At this point buff rewards in high sec so krabs move out of null. Then make null what it was supposed to be - lawless/dangerous space
---
&gt; The typhoon is ok 
---
Typhoon is great and probably one of the strongest T1 battleships for general use. Its a swiss army knife. Its good with any weapon system.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; The Tempest is bad 
---
Tempest is equally as good as the phoon, but you need to be a competent pilot with a decent fit. Armor fit, nano, 5 mids for MJD/MWD/cap booster and then using the dual heavy neuts means you have a ton of mobility and utility. You can neut out up to 2 frigs at a time, which makes it much harder for things to tackle you. Its also a good, cheap brawler as well. Pumps out decent dps with autocannons as well. 
---
Who even uses maelstroms? 
---
Used to be nullsec doctrines were built around arty maelstroms and just buffer fit. The meta has changed though, so they are rarer these days. They aren't great for solo, both because of the blob meta and also because they struggle to fit decent tackle+tank. Grapple+scram isn't really enough for your guns to apply, and with no utility, you can't really defend against faster targets, or put cap pressure on tankier targets.
---
&gt; The cyclone terrible. Too little tank for how slow it is. 
---
? How did you get both things the cyclone is good at and miss the thing its worst at. Cyclone tank is good and its the fastest T1 BC. Look at it more like a cruiser than a BC, then its actually ok as a ship. Its DPS is anemic though, and i don't like how most of its dps is stuck into 5 medium drones that its not bonused for. Here is as video where i fought against a very tanky cyclone, this cyclone was tanking both my Torpedo RNI (1k+ dps) and a rattlesnake: [https://youtu.be/2K05lTNIBmc?t=257](https://youtu.be/2K05lTNIBmc?t=257)
---
&gt; The tornado looks cool I guess. But that's about it. 
---
Cheap alpha and mobile. Can also make for a really fun brawler to meme frigs and kite cruisers with as they expect you to be arty fit. Video on how to do brawl Nado:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz\_2Q8EcJzk&amp;t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz_2Q8EcJzk&amp;t=8s) 
---
&gt; The bellicose is ok I guess. Caracal is still better. 
---
By itself yes. Bellicose can still pump out 350-400 dps **and** gives a big application buff to anyone your gang. Its a fun add-on in small gangs and can still help with dps while giving your bigger ships a tracking buff.
---
&gt; Every fleet issue ship is way worse 
---
HFI, DNI, HNI and BNI are all great BC's. ScyFI is decent and the stabber fleet is pretty poop i'll admit. Navy cruiser and BC need a rework tbh
---
&gt; The rifter is garbage. 
---
Yes.
---
Can agree i was already thinking about leaving. The thing is that i love my current corp as well as the ease of gathering money so i dont have to do it for long each month.
---
If several more senior FCs weren't aware, can't expect him to be possibly aware.
---
I'd remove "ticks". Everything would be continuous, as other games are.
---
You won't either, not for Imperium News fanbois.
---
Missiles was such an OP ability
---
Zkillboard is not part of eve.
---
I agree with your second point, though.
---
Noir. is a old Merc Corperation. Think they just restarted.  
---
Also, i mean you just have to loose ships. Pick a ship you like and you can afford, like start with frigates. Buy 10 of the one you like, fit them out and don't return with it.   
---
Once you lost 10 of those, buy 10 more this time, pick a route and try to make it back alive but you have to find a fight before returning home.   
---
Its all about just doing it, fly everywhere low sec, null sec, WH space. I would recommend Plexes in FW but iffy results. There is never a fair fight in eve.   
---
So you learn by loosing ships. Tons of them. Try to perform better each time, did you heat? Did you try to keep up speed. What ships can you fight, what can you avoid.  
---
And what ships do you even like.
---
This is absolutely the reason.
---
In my opinion, CCP implemented NPC Mafia.
---
I'm all in favor of Player MAFIA, NPC MAFIA? Hell no!
---
Deja vu
---
I haven't played Eve in years but now I think I want to play again, finish my rorq training, and fly battle rorqual.
---
Glad I left. Screw Goonswarm.
---
Your post would be more believable from a 1 day old 0 karma account.
---
I see that office space reference on the discord link.
---
Also Alt+0153 so you can Soon™ with style.
---
Other advice to consider, is not to scan anything. You have somewhere between 90-120 seconds before a fleet shows up if I'm not mistaken ... 90-120 seconds from when you uncloak. Personally I don't have time to scan a bunch of cans, target and approach, then hack that one can in that amount of time.
---
If you're with alpha skills you may also take longer to hack. Conservative, pick one to hack then get out. Less conservative pick two to hack and get out.
---
After my second hack finishes I pick a vector, hit my MWD, then cloak up. You've got to get distance from the cans as well before they blow up or they'll take you with them. 10km+ maybe? I don't remember.
---
Woah i am extremly grateful for the response :) a really kind and caring community
---
Then sit on your ass I guess.
---
Wait 3 months and then it should be cleared out of your transactions

The standard blue donut argument.  Ends it all right there.

Carry on dead alliance.
---
Thanks for posting this! I only hope that you and CCP team will just consider blocking sp extraction or a 7 day delay.  Ive already accepted my “fate”, and blame only myself. Thanks again for your time.
---
Goons and test became friends after WWB, there's no conspiracy there, its just that over time they both found common enemies and had to either blue up or risk actually losing another war. And of course, its not like goons or test would ever risk that
---
Right duh. I’m agreeing with you
---
Amen
---
wut
---
Be fiscally responsible. 
---
I have a theory that the reason why the game has people quitting often is because people of today are generally fiscally irresponsible in real life, and they cant transfer skills they dont have in real life to the game.

Most sov and sov related 'fights' have been prearranged for at least the last 8 years. It all mostly comes down to less than a dozen douchebags making all of the decisions. Unfortunately all of their F1 drones call them 'leaders'. 
---
The game is pretty sad and pathetic. Highsec has more drama of the Eve of old than null will ever have with the worthless assholes who run it. All you have to see is videos like from EveVegas to see what kind of clowns they really are. Worthless, reeeeetarded clowns.
---
&gt; So I ask, is basic established human biology offensive
---
I ask where this is established in game lore? Why do you feel the need to make your out of game issues statement in game?

Honestly; I would love to argue with you till we are both blue in the face about issues like this. I would. In any other context but within the context of a game world.

This isn't some little joke, its not some reference to anything, its not even some double entendre, its you forcing your out of game views on others. Not even referencing them, straight up daring people to get mad about it.

I don't understand how that is offensive. I mean, if you had named it "Trannies Are Men", I could understand. But a statement of undeniable fact? That's a bit ridiculous. I guess CCP has joined the cult of Political Correctness and Delusional Radical Leftism. 
---
Shame on CCP.
---
A word against giant null corps. They are often meat grinders, even the best of them. They don't care about you as a person they just want you to hit f1 on your keyboard. I would find a much smaller corp to start with, where you matter more. Or, give ths giant corp a try, but don't let it turn you off from the game if it sucks. Move on and find a group you click with. Giant nullcorps are far from the only thing in the game, they just have the best marketing.
---
How about a joining a corp that doesn't care about suspicious looking transactions, as long as you are having fun and players in your corp are having fun as well with you around?
---
TAPI admitted on interview they have a defense pact. Point #7. So you got Non-invasion pact and mutual defense pact.

I could tell you retards water was wet and some crytit wormholer would contradict me just on principle.
---
They've got Seoul!
---
Considering it's sounding more and more like Mittens bent the knee to Vily, I can't agree with that.
---
Yea combat anoms shouldn’t be able to to have even 30m in total rewards, and the recon will die before the DPS lands
---
Almost as controversial as asking what CisGender means and when told saying “ oh you mean normal? “
---
Under appreciated comment.
---
Quite open? Pittsburg talked for 70 minutes on TIS and gave like 8 different variations on why he got kicked.  That’s about as open as Trump’s tax returns.
---
Ah probably under Texas law too - iron clad there.
---
If you deny small alliances income sources, they'll continue to die out. But hey, why worry about game health when we can meme about who can defend what.
---
Good boy.
---
Can one nerd explain this damage control concept? What damage? What great blow is dealt with grr gon, gon is immoral and is goon like in behavior. 
---
Goons don't appear to want to be nice or parade around on some highhorse or appeal to your interests. Good for that, because if they did you'd join and EVE would just be improbably more blue somehow.
---
What point in time, what year do people want to pretend goons flipped and wanted to appeal to play nice where a relevant blow could be dealt? Seems senseless.
---
Can we place this under low effort memes
---
Anyone who reaffirms my suspicions, biases, conspiracy theories etc is an objective new source. My koolaid is water and I am woke.
---
When showing info for the character, in the top left corner there is a drop down menu where you can choose report bot.
---
wait you're mad that we dropped supers on sieged dreads? 
---
Sorry I guess?
---
I d argue the darwinistic part there. If you have just one individuum deciding "who lives and who doesnt" then over time this individuum will weed out every other specimen that might possibly pose a threat to his own position and therefore will weaken the whole species.
---
its probably going to take you a lot of time and money to figure out how much this game sucks, but you'll be thoroughly lost and distracted from bad feelings for much of that time so don't worry
---
Wait people have jobs and don't play this game 24/7?
---
We gamers truly are the most oppressed
---
Im confused by this comment.
---
There is likely guided tours through his basement for 2.50 including one free punch at the end of the tour. Buy a mug and have one free kick extra.  
---
Honestly, I d be tempted.
---
Oh look the dudes that closely camp delve are making shit up on reddit now. Neat.
---
"Most sov and sov related 'fights' have been prearranged for at least the last 8 years. It all mostly comes down to less than a dozen douchebags making all of the decisions. Unfortunately all of their F1 drones call them 'leaders'."   
---
So this is like real life then?
---
Yeah but I am not a masochist, a baby, a crab, or a moron.... So why would I move to delve?
---
CCP wanted us to do it. Players decided that doing it with trebuchets out of citadel weapon range is better content.
---
Until they come out with super-duper caps!
---
An EUTZ timer set to a weekday as a USTZ group is what makes it so a snuffed holding corp can defend a low power athanor that they don’t use anymore. Being able to at least force a weekend timer would make it a lot more manageable.
---
Risk vs Reward lol you want something easy that’s big isk for small groups when in fact they probably wouldn’t own it in the first place especially if it was passive oriented. 
---
Also with a porpoise and procs our guys make 350-700m an hour so even cheap shit makes stupid isk on 64s. Also because of TZ tanking right now big blocs are having trouble even taking out the smaller guys lol. 
---
If small groups want to make isk without mining then they shouldn’t own moons anyways.... that is a stupid argument as well they can run DED or rat/abyssal sites. Passive income is stupid because it creates no interaction between players and that is what this game is about.
---
Every day I think it’s impossible for r/eve to get more toxic and every day I’m proven wrong.
---
Lol Nestor, refit on the road haha
---
Somehow you need to give whoever feels they are losing something without breaking the game or developing it for that minority only. The loser is not changing their idea of what winning is and they sure as hell are not beating tapi or goons or w/e anytime soon.
---
So allow people the opportunity to "win" without breaking the game. Let there be an appropriate field for the smallgang, solos or people who want to fly specific ships or engagements. 
---
Would like to see more ship type restrictions in various areas with perhaps a few zones with absolutely no limits on what ships you can fly - instead of say like giants swaths and % of the game just allowing everything
---
I don't think I ever went 4 deep on my own comment chains so lets check that box now.
---
Oh i completely agree with you. Defenders shouldnt be able to pick the time AND the day. Its way too strong
---
I am in TEST and I am personally not too happy with our extensive network of (more or less) blues..
---
Anyone who has watched the relations and alignment of strategic assets between TEST and GSF over the last 3 years can easily see what this is really about. Have you ever looked at the TEST Keepstar map? It has a really heavy slant towards the eastern side of TEST's sov.
---
Remember that time during the "million dollar battle" stream when Aryth got super mad about the placement of a new TEST fort in Catch? Every wonder why GSF owns 4-07MU? There is clearly a buffer zone within TEST's own sov in which neither side is supposed position strategic levels of capitals and capital staging citadels
---
I wouldn't think it is fair to say Mittens is bending down for Vily here. This neutral zone exists within our own sov. But he was forced to make a serious concession due to GSF exerting strategic level capital usage within this zone enough times that someone had to take a dive for it. 
---
Someone was going down for this if GSF wanted TEST to remain bluetral. Whether this FC dude deserved it, fucked if I know. What is really interesting is how strong this shows GSF is committed to keeping TEST as an ally.
---
if they implement a simple "passive mining module" to athanor like OP said, yes that would be a disaster athanor are just too strong and easy to defend like before imperium/legacy/pandafam gonna make an agreement between them and the little guy wont be able to suck their rock  
---
BUT  
---
if you implement a new passive moon structure without any weapon and a potato tank you can kill the same day (like ansiblex) big bloc wont be able to do that
---
I just brought that up since my corp was in that situation 3.5 hours ago. Like it would be one thing if weekends could be forced or if ccp required there to be multiple options for hull timer days/times. However, I’m stuck since I can’t get on due to work Monday between 8am and 12 pm pst, which are the possible timers.
---
Are you guys recruiting?
---
Nah not epic at all for a commander who just ran away his Tengu by giving his fleet members to the components and let them die :) 
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30001277/201911160600/
---
The Battle reports revealed the same result. It’s just a boring roaming and really had nothing to be proud of...though we do welcome you guys coming back to Venal because we really need some components for practicing.
---
I haven’t pilot my Phoenix for a long time since last time my FC told me jump into contact while in the siege module lol
---
&gt;Also doing exploration in any friendly heavily occupied space (like delve) is less rewarding than finding a relatively low traffic area and farming those regions.
---
&gt;Less competition =more profit.
---
If only CCP realized ratting and mining should also be like this
---
Rote was in Imperium? For how long?
---
Triglavian content?
---
&gt; you're generally required to give the ESI of all characters you have, not just your main
---
Yeah but there's no way to actually verify that someone's done that, particularly now that you can't see which account a character is on through ESI.
---
But I do agree, if you say you sent it to an alt and offer ESI for both characters then it should be fine.
---
Tldr mittens is a massive cunt even in 2019.
---
With a BR alt filled with ammo, you could stay out there forever in a tengu. Store loot in the BR or just cargo deposit and asset safety everything
---
It had three hardpoints, then BattleVentures were a thing and unironically kicked the shit out of most things in the Frigate class.
---
Tbf they are. The diminishing return is just way too far from the start point.
---
If you have 1 person mining an anomaly vs 15 people, you will overall make less money in the 15 group. But it's so insignificantly less until like 60 people that it doesnt matter.
---
They should probably do a weekly aggregated report to stop this.
---
Quality.
---
You have to be at least 8 years old bittervet to post on r/eve.
---
You must have access to a number of secret drama channels I am missing. I don't see all of these pings and comments in any of our channels. Care to share?
---
Nullsec data sites are typically worth around 10m these days, which may not be worth it to you but to a T1 exploration player it probably is. I tend to run them apart from the level 1 ones tbh, once you've scanned it enough to know it's a data site it's only one more pass to fully scan it and then you can run it while scanning everything else.
---
 \- Pitts: Was also told to stfu and not speak. Forti was locked out with  billions in line members assets, **Mittens** told Pitts to shut up with the  whole passive agressive bs and that he's measuring spikes with whose  heads to put up on em. 
---
No wonder this cock sucker wonders around Eve vegas with fucking minders. My god the ego and the short arse little prick.
---
I'll entosis it 😬
---
Which has nothing to do with the game.
---
You're just a failed edgelord.
---
He's actually the smart one and not shooting himself in the foot.
---
The White Genocide can not come soon enough if it will save us from posts like this.
---
Cargo scan faster. Or maybe someone had already tripped the site and you're super unlucky. (Or you did a 100 AU warp to the site?) You should have time to land, scan the cans, pick the best and hack it 99% of the time. (Usually you can hack two but that is definitely rolling the dice.)
---
2 weeks
---
Lol, ok boomer.
---
You must be new to Reddit, that is pretty much all INIT does.
---
Oh shit. Your right.
---
Disregard what i said.
---
1. Do you like to afk rat in a super with blingy mods?
---
2. Can you fly a nice rorq with those excavator drones?
---
If you said yes/or you can with a nice loan from GSM. Then its the best place for you
---
You beat me to it.
---
Corp name was garbage. That's a given. 
---
I agree that people shouldn't be offended over nothing. Now, why would you freely attacks someone else beliefs then claim they should just deal with it?
---
It wasn't even a fair try at good humour.. I sometime find a good dark dead baby joke funny.. I'm a bad person. I would never dream of telling that joke to a woman who's baby died then ask why she's offended?
---
True true lol
---
If you don't try it now when do you think would be a good time to start.... do it!
---
Yeah I guess I should have mentioned that, it is diminishing just *barely*, not enough to make the risk of moving outside of the umbrella worthwhile.
---
If you want to see them and hang out with people who fly them, karmafleet is always recruiting.
---
NPC stations: yes
---
Player structures: generally not (though there are occasional freeports in J space for some reason)
---
Hmm, I was under the assumption that it occurred simultaneously if possible.
---
Only when pre-loaded.
---
I wonder how hard this would be to test.
---
So, that's a no then?
---
This is a general caution: mining can be seen as boring and can cause new players to burn out. If you enjoy it, by all means mine away. Some people find enough enjoyment by sitting in the belts chatting with friends to get by. I find the activity repulsive but that’s just me. Like I said in my other post, do what you enjoy. When you stop enjoying an activity, find a new one.
---
That shit was funny as fuck
---
People leaving is going to be the only sign of change.
---
Long enough to make INIT jealous
---
Body dysmorphia, a known mental illness, is a serious issue.
---
It showed with them backing DRF and while I applaud them for sticking by a paper tiger I think it was a mistake.
---
I dont understand how that relates to my statement
---
Pittsburgh drama???? 
---
Best decision ever boys  fuck goons 
---
Fuck their weird ass wannabe freemason new eden order leader  if eve economy is getting fucked it a big part because of goons
---
shit posting requires no effort
---
Not good at what?
---
Thank you for the new system that notifies us when our reports help. It's really nice see the emails.
---
I think that body dysmorphia should be better represented in Eve online.
---
Same people who advocate for supper ratting because it means "more supers in space" are the ones who want passive moons to be back, talk about hypocrisy
---
uh thanks?
---
I have a male and female characters and I roleplayed that they were married. I am married to myself. Am I better to worse than the person who married a pizza? Don't answer please.
---
10% margin if you are omega and have skills, honestly as an alpha you are probably looking closer to 20% margins minimum.   
---
Alphas cannot train any skills that make market taxes cheaper. If you want to get into the market game Omega is pretty much a must, otherwise you will work twice as hard to make half as much if you are lucky.
---
mediocre attept at storry spinning, nothing of value really
---
I think you're forgetting why passive moon mining was bad and why it was changed. All it does is allows the big groups to spread their holdings further, beyond what they actually have the manpower to mine, because they can drop the hammer on any attempt to take away their ISK printers.
---
Give it two weeks, they'll be smoking 90% of the people in the game like a fine Cuban.
---
You'd make more money in Fountain, so try Initiative.
---
Well ccp already has prosthetic arms in game which you can use to identify with yourself. While amputees and gender are extremely 2 different things and should not be compared.
---
I'll be shocked if Rote does anything relevant, all they know how to do is camp M-0 in AT frigs.
---
How would one know or what are the indicators of a bot?
---
