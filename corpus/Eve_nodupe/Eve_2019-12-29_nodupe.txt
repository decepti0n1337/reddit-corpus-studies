You cared enough to complain about how someone is still having fun even though you quit because you weren't having fun. Maybe you should have tried MCAV instead and actually had some fun.
---
---
---
What?
---
you may take a few minutes, scroll up through this chain, and maybe hopefully come to the understanding that you're the one who started the condescension
---

---
i also hope somewhere deep within that thick head of yours, there's an inkling of understanding that *you're in provi* and literally nothing you can put into a comment on reddit will make me give a shit about your opinion lmao

i've biomassed the same day raffle was out. apparently if you email a seccurity team to del your personal info - they will delete all KB activity as well lel

easiest way to make isk is from offers in jita local. people are always offering good deals and stuff there, you have to be quick though since they get taken fast!

what the fuck

D'oh lol

Guy decided to quit. Jumped into lxq and started awoxing on the paala gate. Warped his nyx off to adjacent system and we tackled and killed it there.

Then you want 3 Kikimoras

If you do go Factional Warfare, get out of the default FW corp for your faction and into a player corp. You will have a much better time.
---
Small world man. Contact me in game and catch up some time.

Is this a famous actor that I can't recognize?
---
im fully aware of that. but waiting out a single session timer because youre able to install multiple clones on one citadel is still better than like the minimum 6 we currently have if you want to switch to a specific clone before jumping in your ship.
---
Everyone and their mother were flying Ferox fleets back in the time he's talking about. Before Muninns became the hot shit. It was either Feroxes or T3Cs.
---
If a group had the isk and sp to run Vultures, you ran roughshot over every single other sizable group only running Feroxes.
---
&gt; Yep that's pretty much the effort caused by scaling.
---
I already told you multiple times by now that the non-scaled camping isn't even worth discussing. Nobody cares about or is complaining about single characters camping. There is a very easy counter to that. You farm in another system. Null is full of systems and each system can support tons of people. 1-character camping can be low-effort. It's also pointless, resultless, inconsequential, and not what anyone is discussing about any of these threads. 
---
You keep ignoring this point that by now I made for the 5th time.
---
Mmm video game  bureaucracy
---
And may you be rebirthed like the phoenix.
---
Beats being in Red Alliance. Since you don't have a flair I can only guess.
---
I used to be in Novac with Daredevil, very sad to hear that he is quitting, but I’m happy that he went out with a bang. God speed capsuleer o7
---
That's the plan.
---
&gt; Same question: Why do super and roqual kills have to be a thing in people's spaces? 
---
Nonconsensual PvP have always existed in Eve and more people pay CCP to enjoy that playstyle than 15 man corps that have 5 systems. 
---
&gt; Why do we as a small alliance have to join a null bloc?
---
They don't. There is tons of space to be carved everywhere, lots of activities to do for ISK besides anomaly ratting in your 5 systems.
---
&gt; you promote it to join them
---
I don't. I traditionally promoted midsize alliances over mega empires. That doesn't mean everything has to be balanced around the PvE needs of a 10 man corp.
---
&gt; your easy play style
---
You are defending that you are entitled to undisturbed anomaly PvE. Eve doesn't get easier than anomaly PvE.
---
Don't expect to be paid for your work, especially in the larger alliances.
---
Speaking of terrible UIs, wtf is this monstrosity of a photo collage you've made?
---
The problem isn't adapting, the problem that it just isn't worth it.  Without local you may as well go back to krabbing in high sec/assbyssmals for no risk and better reward, or wormholes for less risk and way more reward.  CCP would have to change a lot for Blackout to work, but they're too fucking incompetent/lazy to do that and everyone knows it.
---
i just want a proper jacket :(
---
Hey null nerds and wormholers. Just a friendly reminder Innerhell has a keepstar in their wormhole. Be a shame if something happened to it.
---
Yeah i submitted a ticket now ill wait what they might say.
---
Yeah i have seen that account from the eve launcher.It is the account i play with right now but still i havent got my starter pack.so i submitted a ticket to eve support.
---
Submit a ticket to ingame support.I hope it will solve the problem.
---
I just wish r/evememes was more active. It’s got all the jokes and less of the whining
---
If they're not AFK , how can you know ?  
---
don't act stupid please , since you never know if a camper is AFK , you have to consider he's not, which makes the afk thing completely imbalance.
---
I wonder who is getting kicked over this.
---
Sadly as a new player you're not likely to be super viable in these scenarios as most groups have a cap/supercap fleet on standby for that purpose. I'd aim for a smaller group that puts a few miner alts out and then runs PvP roams in their area. Many wormhole groups work in this manner.
---
What you might consider instead is just joining a group that polices their region heavily and rather than being on standby for the miners/mining fleet, goes out and hunts targets that show up in the area. Again, this is not necessarily something that the bigger groups are going to be doing much of, but it's something you can find in smaller null groups.
---
Dropped anti-cap Phoenices. Realised too late it was a subcap fight. Got haws to the Phoenices but no ammo. /shrug
---
Yeah, but doing what you're supposed to do is fucking shit.
---
Battlereport pls?
---
Lets be honest, do you think in a few years EVE will still exist?  I don't mean some Korean P2W trash using the name, I mean the EVE we used to love.
---
what can i say :P
---
Too bad  CCRee would rather just do zero effort dailies instead of actual event sites.

As long as your losses aren't absolutely huge, evicting a corp (especially one this large) is extremely profitable in wormholes

Here are some 4k transparencies to help get rid of the aliasing:

---
Ooooh I needed that six weeks ago :D
---
With good behavior you get 6 months off
---
ffs I am a man; I have a kilt; I even wear it in public sometimes. 
---
Hell, I see other men walking around in them....and I don't live anywhere near a place where they are considered traditional.
---
1) It requires a lot more DPS to reach damage cap or alternatively a lot more time shooting it if you can't reach the cap. 
---
2) A Fort has way stronger defenses than an Astra, if your only experience of citadel warfare is fighting over Forts in 100 man fleets (I'm assuming your ticker is not bait) then you may believe Fort defenses are irrelevant, but that's only because your fleet has 15 logi and a full set of boosts. When fit for anti-cap a Fort will break and kill any Dreads dropped on it in range. The exception is the specialist "B52" setup consisting of Phoenixes, a Chimera and a Rorq which drops at 290km in neut falloff. Even then you have to be careful, if the Fort has a certain set of neuts and rigs it can also kill B52s. When fit for anti-subcap it will make using many common setups used by 1-3 players unworkable. Things like a few tinker Leshaks, Rattles, Nestors, etc. It also makes using Attack BC completely impossible, a Fort will vaporise Oracles for example.
---
3) The Fort provides excellent grid control for deployment of defensive capitals. You will have your 2-3 site running Dreads, potentially a Rorq, maybe a Carrier. You can synergize these with your Fort. For example you could fit the fort for anti-cap to make it unviable to drop capitals on you and then deploy your own caps with HAWs, sentry drones, light fighters and chew through any subcaps that come for you.
---
I knew, but have to say, I have never seen them all spelled out like this. This is a nice little reference I might need to paste into my in game notebook.
---
Then again, I can usually fit a T2 module at this point, so if I am going meta it the go-to is compact for fitting purposes.
---
In a 1v1 situation yeah, it's a really tough ship to beat. In a small gang situation though... Keres my dude!
---
Woot?? Reall?? I just bought a sacri plus imps ( around 8-9bil) but no clue how profit they are? Bit with supers you do say 200mio per tick meaning 600mio/h
---
I just realized they're FRICKING EXPENSIVE
---
They're min 66mil ISK
---
Edit: More expensive than the LITERAL DRAM AND DAREDEVIL
---
Are you the one throwing a party?
---
yeah I'll be honest I'm a little disappointed to see caps on those killmails.
---
bReH
---
That's a great idea! I just need to make sure the corp is in TEST ;-)
---
Edit: I also plan on joining Eve uni and then when they get online to leave uni and join a good corp
---
Nobody is safe !
---
You know, you could shoot the citadel which would stop the unanchoring of the citadel.
---
Damn, that looks awesome! 
---
In rust we trust!
---
whow thats alot of work, hold on did a bot do that
---
I still miss the bugged mess that was crew quarters. At least i could use my character for something.

Would be nice if CCP did more tiercide. Cut down on junk items and give a nice healthy boost to balance.

You’re touching on a problem CCP has been working on for a very long time now. The point being that the new player in EVE has a tough time getting to know the environment before being dragged into the mechanics of it.
---
I have commented on this exact problem for many years. Pirates have this attitude of ‘low sec is dead’, and the reason low sec is dead is that they summarily execute everybody who comes through the gate. And I’m saying that from the perspective of the small entrepreneur trying to make it into low sec so that I could maybe harvest something better than Veldspar. I lasted 25 seconds in an Iteron Mark V. If they don’t allow -anyone- who is not a pirate doing pirate things to live there in a kinda/sorta equilibrium where you’re never perfectly safe but you could hang on if you were smart about it, there’d be many more people attempting to make a living in low sec, just so they could get access to better resources. You don’t need to convince me of that, I’ve been there. That’s been my experience. You hear complaints: low sec is empty. Oh yeah, why would that be you think?
---
There’s a commonality in the experience you describe. It is this: some people will see the challenge and engage, many people will not see the potential and leave. Most people leave. That’s the problem with EVE: very many people try it, most of them don’t have the stomach for the kind of punishment they get for even trying. It’s not a place for everyone. It never was.
---
If you can’t join a team that wants you for the things you eventually want to end up doing there, it’s going to be an abysmal experience. If you do find those people you can have a great deal of fun.
---
You decide what your attitude towards EVE will be. Nobody can do that for you.
---
They came in at the end so it’s ok. We were fighting some haw dreads for a while and killing and small tackle that came close
---
do not challenge a macharial to a bumping match.

Usually its people that have gotten stomped on by competent kiters than complain how real men brawl. Like our 5 dudes should brawl your 30 man blob yet somehow cant work up the courage to jump into our WH to fight. :P
---
This battle is like a Goon’s gift for the fun roaming that the TEST fleet did before Xmas. I think they had fun as they fought Mach Fleet and killed a carrier.

Yes most weapons have not been tiericeded yet.
---
Worst PvP ship in the game is definitely the Griffin Navy Issue. It's about as strong as a Merlin for about 40 times the price.
---
0/10. Pathetic use of an Adam Sandler movie quote. Please tell me more about how much of a coward wormholer you are.

Q-ships work really well against 60 bombers that come out of a covert cyno.
---
So your Corp can Provide T1 Frigades for free to practice PvP?
---
Salty much ?
---
Make the NSA's duration 5 minutes just like indy core.
---
Then nerf the base scan res of /supers to utter shit so you can't rat without NSA on.
---
&gt; Lowsec still dead?
---
At least that meme is still alive.
---
In addition to your (correct) post, in most cases a gank is so fast that you can't meaningfully defend a miner, and your 'defence' ship is likely to get killed too. Defending on a tactical level just isn't viable.
---
Defending on a strategic level (response and interception fleets) is but that is an entirely different kettle of fish.
---
Nice b8
---
5 minutes rat timer my guess
---
Sansha is TEST's best friend.
---
Another tip is to check out the Agency and find somewhere with multiple lvl4 combat agents. Mission runners will need a constant supply of munitions and you could be the one to sell to them! Drones are also viable. You could even start to place buy orders on the loot that drops, place buy orders for cheaper than orders at Jita (or other trade hubs) and you'll have a trade route!
---
Just remember, NEVER AUTO PILOT WITH A FULL SHIPMENT! some out there, even in high sec, will take you out at the cost of their ship and have a friend swoop in and grab the loot.
---
We don't really know the internal workings of the ships. For all we know they could be using massive stripper-clips to load ammunition.

If you can target ships coming out of warp, then they can target you too.

You don't want that, there's consequences you're not anticipating.

Player’s Haven. We are small, and user friendly. Both newbies and vets play together and no required bullshit.

I probably shouldn't drunk post. What i ment to say is that the DNI is the apex shield brawler for its class, nothing else comes remotly close. If you want to shield brawl, (usually in WH space) you either bring a dni or you ship up. Pretty boring and stagnant for someone who likes to theorycraft.
---
DNI NERF WHEN.
---
Probably the best general advice. Xpost to Buildapc will sort op out
---
This is wonderful
---
Fuck it have my upvote
---
yeah, t2 mwd is basically never worth it. t2 afterburner is good though if you have fitting room
---
&gt; I can't think of a larger alliance that *won't* SRP someone in a doctrine fit ship that was participating in a genuine pinged home-save operation.
---
Brother, I take it you haven't ever been in Horde.

It brought me back for a moment. Was fun.
