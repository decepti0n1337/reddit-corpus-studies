I did and this [happens..](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78273019/) Wonder why you guys are so bored down there :hmm:
---
No timer and no tether.
---
&gt;I’ve seen a lot of things that just so happens to be pretty similar to EVE
---

---
That's because a lot of eve is just copies shit from other games that predate it. That's how the industry works.

I'm implying goons won't shoot your structures and provoke fights that actually matter, or park supers in range of your staging to keep you from using supers, etc.

---
While in “low power” mode, an Upwell structure will have:
---
One  less reinforcement cycle (jumping straight to the final  reinforcement  as soon as the structure shield are destroyed and skipping  armor  entirely)
---
An initial attack that can occur at any date and any time chosen by the attackers
---
A final battle that occurs in the timezone and day chosen by the defenders to allow them a last stand
---
\----
---
If you know the day of the vulnerability window.
---
A citadel in low power can be destroyed in 2 days.
---
I have analyzed citadels.
---
With a data analyzer.
---
Can't expect anything less from them.
---
It’s funny you listed all the systems not worth fighting in as a smaller gang as the alliances stage there. In time more people will venture out from their keepstars when they realise content is all around them. Have no fear! 
---
I have loved blackout and still continue to do so, I’m finding content everywhere except perhaps outer ring.
---
My opinion of HiSec is your fat 50 yo virgin wearing a kimono with Jesus Sandle’s drinking a cosmopolitan listening to Barry Manilow while doing the Carlton dance.
---
I joined PH on a spy (nothing special I know). But holy fuck are their comms unbearable. And here I thought test was autistic.
---
Surely goons will move a sizeable capital force to reinforce random roams and sig action.
---
Everything is more fun when you don't take anything seriously.
---
Know one is gonna tell you what to buy/sell, thats down to you to find out. One tip though, use two characters, one to buy goods, put that toon in a citadel and one to sell, put that one in Jita.
---
By trying to ruin the game for everyone else, they ruined the game for themselves. :c
---
Only a fat 50 yo virgin wearing a kimono with Jesus Sandle’s drinking a cosmopolitan listening to Barry Manilow while doing the Carlton dance would know what those words mean.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
My disintegrator has never been more erect.
---
Gave me a giggle
---
He's V0LTA, he's not supposed to make any sense.
---
I do exactly the same. And then criticize my self on how pointless it is and still keep doing it... It is probably some hoarding impulse.
---
How are you  guys going outside the gate camp? I know activity has decreased in catch except for swarms of relic hunters.
---
No, it should be NO timers
---
Note that ccp would have to rework the engine for things like physically landing on planets
---
Triple rep myrm just became double ancil+normal.
---
Go fight TEST if you're bored.... the only one that stands a tiny chance if the play it right
---
I really dont see an argument for the 24h timer. There should be no timer.
---
Nice writeup
---
And hacking a pvp thing. Have multiple nodes on a structure that require a few hackers to do it in 5ish minutes or so in x amount of time from completing the first one (so one guy cant so it all)
---
This is how you summon chthulu....
---
our great leader decided stop playing because sick, when he sick all member one by one left him (from corp) not in our community. was having fun with them and never forget about great moment when do all shiet thing.
---
How to find fights in blackout when you are trash tier content finder.
---
- Get 3-5 friends.
---
- Scan a hole into thera.
---
- Open Thera Scout and find an exit close to hostile staging space.
---
- Anchor a bubble at a pipe next to staging or inside.
---
- Start killing plebs till they get pissed and come to break your bubble.
---
- Fight the response and die like piece of shit you are cause you have no real pvp experience.
---
- Get podded, spin your titan at station and cry in reddit to feel good about being terribad.
---
Requirements
---
- Not having half the eve blue.
---
- Having the balls to fight outnumbered. and outgunned.
---
Personal experiences.
---
- Same flow of content as before.
---
- Less uncatchable bots that were wasting my time,  more real players ratting.
---
- Less girls DDing, gate camping me, hotdropping their titan/super on my frig when their ability to track my movements through local disapeared.
---
- More easy to seperate blobbing girls since half of em are not in comms.
---
-Un expected events like killing or getting killed by other gangs while contesting local residents kills.
---
Personal opinion.
---
- You are just low tier pilots plain and simple and dont belong to what nullsec should have always been. But most importantly man you guys have no balls at all in game and in real life for sure.
---
Get the fak out of my sight with your cry posts about black out.
---
&gt; Could use more people like this.
---
Actually no. There is nothing interesting about unskilled play. It’s just decadent use of spaceship pixels, nothing of an admirable performance, any retard can do it
---
I think tranquility very much can be saved but not with gimmick changes like blackout or drifter invasions. I think one of the very few ideas that has been put out by CCP that was even half way decent was Falcon's post from a few weeks ago:
---
\-Get rid of faxes and put the cap repairing job back on carriers and don't give them the crazy rep bonuses they gave to FAXes
---
\-Go back to single target DD's only 
---
\-Remove the ability for titans to track anything smaller than a dread or carrier
---
\-HAW guns shouldn't be a thing
---
\-Put carrier tracking back where it was so they can function as the sub cap counter for cap fleets they were intended to be  
---
And Hilmar has had exactly one good idea this decade but it doesn't go far enough:
---
\-If hilmar thinks warp core stabs should go then nulification should be nuked as well.
---
/r/rareinsults
---
Praise Bob from whom all blessings flow.
---
You say unskilled. Maybe true? I dont know the pilot. But someone willing to use their assets, their isk, that's what the game needs. Not turtling up and waiting for help. They lose it they, they had fun. Else they leave and the game sure as hell can't afford people leaving
---
1 hp - full hp - 1hp - full hp - ...
---
- Less uncatchable bots that were wasting
---
 my time,  more real players ratting.
---
- Un expected events like killing or getting killed by other gangs while contesting local residents kills.
---
not to our space they wont
---
Find an open mining community and scrounge the boost and mine there with 3 Skiff.

That thing is not dying for a long time.

---
Because if so that argument tactic was tired 10 years ago.
---
great moment will never be forgotten T.T
---
That would comprimise my integrity a bit too much, if I was that good CCP would have responded to my messages to their legal department and made an arrangement.
---
I feel commision work is one way, as a tattoo artist can be commissioned to tattoo Eve related items onto a person or, to gain permission/licence to do so, even if thats under very specific conditions.
---
If the voice is loud enough, and the message solid, it will be heard.
---
No you don't get it, people shouldn't have fun playing Eve.
---
Titans are for spinning, not fighting.
---
I disagree. Passion is important.
---
What, no duct tape?
---
Pretty sure TEST and Goons roam and kill each other 23x7.
---
you can print this at any scale you'd like but may suffer some degredation after 12 x 9 inches though most probably people will only start to really notice at triple that size
---
Null has always had a ton of empty systems. Used space is now defined by supercap umbrella jump range centered on a staging system.
---
Since you appear to not understand how wormhole structure reinforcement mechanics work, the minimum time between armor and structure on a low power timer in J-space is 12 hours. Thus, if you bash it at least 14 hours before the reinforcement timer, you're guaranteed to get it.
---
So yes, I was implying that.
---
To remain vague. Used to collect "historical" items as a hobby, removing these items from certain countries was sometimes illegal, even moreso if it was purchased and then shipped to the buyer. So I purchased random stuff that came along with these items. I didn't realize this at first, just thought it was a weird tax dodge until some stuff came in that was obscured from x-ray by metal meant to make it look like something else.
---
Orca mating dance.
---
No kidding we went 2 jumps in with 6 harpies. They escalated with supers and FAX.
---
As one of "the little guys" in eh space, we're doing just fine thank you.
---
No offense, I've not played long. Wtf is a highsec carebear? Doesn't that describe the lot of us here where it's safer*? I'm confused by either the perspective or the pajoritive.
---
yeah exactly, before blackout you had all the regions that are now empty appearing to have activity when in reality it was just bots
---
It's quite sad. I only got up to carriers but me and my corp mates would gate that damn thing around out of our staging for the lols. It was a Thanny so upper leadership didn't care
---
The true answer to keeping your space a fluffy pillow is to blow everything that closely resembles humanity sky high
---
carebears are solely pve players in a pvp focused game. It is fine to do pve but it is in general frowned upon to only do pve.
---
as long as they don't hit structures or sov or cloaky camp or interfere with moon mining ops or shoot stuff in delve with friends from other alliances. Villy banned Brandnewbros from shooting shit in delve with friends from panfam after goons told him too, it was pretty pathetic.
---
Just because they discourage it doesn't mean they stop it
---
Mm. forgot about the AB bonus, but 2 webs still slows it enough even with overheat.

Gorgeous! Great work. How long did it take?
---
As long as i keep it in game i figure i am fine. The part that scares me is when she suggested i use or sell them... i thought just for a moment. This chicks gots to go.
---
we aren't talking about empty system, we are talking about space where people live who aren't utilizing it like they did before because they have no chance at avoiding covert gangs moving through their space due to their size.  
---
" Used space is now defined by supercap umbrella jump range centered on a staging system. " which is a direct result of the blackout. Anyone without an umbrella has no chance to counter moving gangs because they have no idea they are coming till people start getting ganked.
---
This one only took a few hours tbh, maybe 4? I don't realy time myself when im painting as I dont feel i have the consistancy to get the desired result 100% of the time plus, you kind of lose where you are lol
---
Honestly if you're having fun where you are, don't listen to anyone telling you to stop having fun!
---
RIP me
---
It's what elite PvP players call other players that mostly PvE so they can feel more badass while sitting in their mom's basement playing an internet spaceship roleplaying game.
---
Why have I not heard of this...
---
Miner, calm down... is the correct spelling
---
It did seem like a pretty fast lock, maybe I was lagging not really sure.
---
Probably won't get alphad in a frigate. If you're on grid long enough for a ship big enough to alpha you, you're just rarted
---
Looks like you’re ruining you’re own game. Good job.
---
They're both autistic... you've discovered the Spectrum
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
On the other hand, a flight of T2 drones is worth more than most of the other loot, and it's not tracked by the loot tracker sooooo...
---
This hits hard my dude. Avid hoarder.
---
Sure drakes will work. You've got multiple pilots flying together though, might as well use some dedicated logi. It'll make the combined fleet cheaper.
---
Psst. What if I told you... You can sell loot?!
---
Cringe
---
I think I'm in love with this Neckbeard.
---
Ahh wooowoooo
---
That's fantastic. All your practice really paid off if you can paint this well so quickly!
---
This is pretty much it. +1
---
About 49 billion in hoarded assets on my main. 500 million liquid. Lmao
---
Except I move all of my stuff and leave them all in one hi sec system.
---
Fascinating! I was mostly asking because you said not to, but your answer is incredible. Enjoy your Ark of The Covenant "replica"!
---
It was better then butt plugs
---
That's not true! I am only 32.
---
Spreeeaaaaaadddd ssssshhhheeeeeeeeeeeettttttt (zombie voice)
---
/r/woooooosh
---
Because people don’t end up bored... there’s fleets going on pretty much all day if you want to blow up shit... if there’s not, do your own thing until there is. Take a wormhole out of delve if you want. It’s not really as bas as people say it is.
---
LOL. Also just sell it as your Eve rainy day fund.
---
Retarded logic
---
I didn´t actually talk to you but well. And no your playstyle won´t work if you are allready crying about empty space and noone to shoot at...except for high sec and dropping on low sec guys.
---
Do you guys not see what´s wrong with your arguments?
---
You guys join (or form) the biggest alliance in order to have allmost perfect safety and then complain that blackout encourages other players to do the same? And you wouldn´t call that ironic?
---
"Oh no blackout is a failure, it makes even more people join our coalition (or the other big ones), now we have to drop on low sec guys and shoot high sec players."
---
 You recruit half of eve and set 1/3 blue and then complain about no targets. 
---
So basically you guys do not want to provide content but ask others to provide it for you, and then blame blackout and call it a failure because it makes other players turtle up in other coalitions or yours (or unsub). 
---
"Why can´t the little guys still be easy targets for us, why do you guys try to be like us now" 
---
"grr blackout..."
---
Do not complain about the fact that players do not come to you to provide content (only to get supered), work for content and provide it to others by leaving your area and looking for worthwile fights. 
---
Go ahead and reset your neighbours and go kill stuff if you really want content, but that would mean taking risks. After that tell me how blackout is still a failure. Blackout only made people realize that your playstyle is the least risk with highest reward one. And that is what is fucking over null. Not the blackout per se.
---
Frigates and destroyers would destroy a VNI.... ?
---
In syndicate
---
Mother Kinakka weeps for LS
---
YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH. .... i mean..... ummmm no thank you.
---
That’s why Hong Kong Taiwan and Tibet don’t want to stay with Chinese mainlanders
---
you live in querious right ? or nearby anyway ? wasnt there some alliances scuffing over there that resulted in one alliance dying ? was that even before the black out ?
---
Dont get me wrong, he can use it as he sees fit, and if he enjoys that it’s fine, I am just pointing out that this all just isnt that impressive
---
Nazi shit right?
---
So basically, if your assets weren't in EvE and instead, the real world... you'd be an average rich guy.
---
Clearly hoarding isn't the only problem. And they say capsuleers don't degrade clone to clone....
---
Yes, we learned that many times from Goons.
---
Okay,  
---
So i've been mining for a few days and have built up a small pool (very small, but enough to afford a couple ship replacements etc)
---
I have an Alt that i intend to use for PvE Combat stuff such as the security missions etc but im not sure where to invest my million SP.   I'm Gallente and im looking into flying the Algos to work up my security level.  What skills would be best to shoot for for a Drone fighter?
---
Is there any sort of skill template that i could compare things through on the web? i downloaded EveMon but thats damn near more confusing than Path of Building.
---
So as a alpha model from the game. At one time it was true.
---
They should be no timer just the structure.
---
&gt;Blackout only made people realize that your playstyle is the least risk with highest reward one. And that is what is fucking over null. Not the blackout per se.
---
So the mechanic causing people to turtle up is not the issue, its the cowards who are turtling up because of the mechanic...
---
That is hands off, the last thing they want.
---
I'm not the only one that's insane. Yay.
---
A group of them would, but not alone
---
“i do not like care bears”
---
Yes damn those horrible people who don’t impact anything unless you choose to do stuff to them
---
I have one of those in real life too.
---
&gt;High risk low reward
---
That's a problem with how ratting rewards player isn't it? All other eve activities balance themselves out. And if cap have a lower risk and higher award doing mining and ratting maybe that should get looked at?
---
Explorers, ratters in wormholes, hunters, pvp players dscan all the time..
---
I have a box of blue and green and a box of skins.
---
I relate to thid post so much I saved it.
---
That just summons Australians.
---
Usually I'm sad when Ever leave, but you're an exception.
---
First, you insult China in the game, which shows that you are easily influenced by one-sided media and lack of education.
---
Second,although you can drive Titan, your game level is poor and you are not good at darw the lesson
---
Thirdly, you are weak in willpower and choose to retreat after being hit.
---
VVV is one of my most hated alliances in Serenity server, but this time you are done a good job. 
---
Goodbye, the weak.
---
Personally I'm not opposed to most of those, but I do think there is a lot of discussion to be had about each one.
---
\-Faxes were introduced to stop slowcats, right? I think mixing capital logistics and DPS would still be OP even with half the rep strength of current Faxes and the reffiting nerf from a few years back. They do each have cool models and they do have a unique role as a "sieging carrier" class hull. Maybe they could become all around capital support ships with the ability to use an expanded suite of support fighters (removed from (super)carriers) and significantly nerfed repair abilities (1/2 of current). Balance wise I think it would work as a compromise, but since the roles are mutually exclusive though, this is probably a really shit idea (it'd still be pretty funny though... imagine the new Grath rage). 
---
\-single target DDs I agree and I don't think gun caps ever should have been able to apply to subcaps.
---
\-Improved Carrier tracking is fine, but I thought they were nerfed to slow the ISK faucet too. Maybe mixed damage on each fighter could fix that without impacting PVP ability much. But supers remain the elephant in the room... would heavy fighters be nerfed to strictly anticapital duties?
---
\-Warp core stabs and nullification are tied together, I agree. But bubblefucked gates do exist and would be alot more annoying in terms of catching ratters and initiating fights if nullification as a whole was removed. Travel would be harder too, but that's kinda the point I guess. If a nullified travel option were needed, shuttles should be given nullification down the line. I wouldn't be opposed to trying it though. The real issue that I've seen though is just nullification on T3Cs.
---
sorry for having an opinion
---
Quick question. If they jump their super into one system, how much time does it take for them to be able to jump their supers in another?
---
&gt; of course you would sell them for less than their worth, which I think is pretty similar to the assets safety tax
---
Except that firesales were an added benefit to the people who stole the station, as they now got a bunch of cheap shit
---
Are the drifter hive systems the ones that the wormholes that spawn as beacons you don't need to scan connect to?
---
Is this type of things grounds for a IP/trademark/likeness lawsuit?

---
doesnt include other skills that may be required for tank, fitting or stuff like weapon upgrades iv (t2 drone damage amplifier)
---
Yeah but see, the Rorqual at least sees the outside of a station tether more than once a year now. It used to basically get the same amount of action as your average titan pilot.
---

Although you will uncomfortable with these, but..... it... works.

when a new person who doesn't know anything and is hovering in high sec.he will try to find them.
---
To solve this problem, the most important thing is to make these things easy to clean up. It's not China's mistake ok?.
---
Or CCP ban those people riveted boxes.i will Support.
---
None, they just take a different set tbh
---
But then they won’t leave their aug mining drones in space when DT hits.
---
Don’t barges and exhumers out m3/min them?
---
I agree, thats why we have fun in horde
---
thanks for bringing content, you guys have been aggressive and it's been so fun. This fight was the most fun I've had in a year, I know I wasn't the only one in Darkness feeling this way. Hopefully there's more to come!
---
Before the blackout one could take a combat probing Viator and make easy isk off all the abandoned drones by bot VNIs.
---
Yeah right they never throw that many supers and if anything escalate, they can definitely out escalate anyone.
---
This isn't a great situation
---
I know how they work. and if you read the OP post that you referred me to, you'll see the words "One 24 hour timer".
---
I was referring to the problem with bashing structures being more about timezones than days. It's great if in a wormhole the timer is only 16 hours, but that doesn't help anything if 16 hours laters is 6am in the morning on a weekday for me and the boys. That structure, for us, is functionally unassailable.

No. No woooosh. You're just being dumb.

And nerds say they like super tits bouncing in their face

Just have low power structures not regen at all, and make drifters spawn and prioritize them.

That was peak /r/eve

Sell DCUs?  Maybe if you are only planning on losing 300 ships ever.

---
Reducing the cap ratting reward won't make sub-cap ratting meaningfully more rewarding.  As long as subcap pve risk/reward is negative (you will, on average, lose money because of zero intel) then *no one* will do it in null, regardless of cap risk/reward.  You'll just have all the players that don't have caps continuing to not log on or moving to hisec, and therefore fewer targets for hunters.  But, my how elite you'll be when you do find a proc to gank.  You survived elite levels of boredom!  You are a NULLSEC WARRIOR!!  You really should be praised by all far and near for your bravery.

I don’t roam in delve anymore. Not even running interceptors. About the umpteenth time upon getting a good fight and having 127 titans or 291 supers jumped on your head gets old.

Yep. Got it. You’ve got the assets why not use them.

Another thread for "I want less work for my free kills CCP" 
---
You guys are a sorry bunch
---
Correct, having fun is not impressive.
---
Sounds like you're having trouble ganking orcas. Can I suggest adapting?
---
Zarvox confirmed streaming again.
---
Still waiting for mobile siphons to be repurposed as mobile fuel siphons.
---
you seem upset
---
While not entirely false, basically it's the "supposedly" awesome at pvp (you'd know it by looking at all the industrial ship kills on their killboard) trying to demonize the player that chooses to not enter into an area that others can easily shoot them, for whatever reason.
---
not a post based in reality
---
jimmies fully rustled.
---
We had those long long ago.
---
Well I'm not sure how, but you consistently improve each time. I have yet to see one on the level of the previous one.
---
Yup. ... Well, there *is* a legitimate reason for me having most of it actually.
---
I learned it was a heck of a lot easier to replace a ship with a spare I already owned with a fit that I already owned than to grind up the isk *without* said ship.
---
This led to my hangars being filled with dupes of everything I can fly...
---
Once in a while I go through and sell old things I'm not using anymore, but I have quite the collection of weird ships and fits saved.
---
A solution and problem of my own creation.
---
&gt; That structure, for us, is functionally unassailable.
---
Yes, timezone tanking is an issue. it is a completely separate issue from timer durations. The OP's picture was one with an 8 day+ timer. *Fairly* certain the intent was to highlight timer durations, not timezone tanking.
---
No seriously powers goons and pets test and pets and gotg is about 70% of the people in null
---
http://coalitionsin.space/
---
don’t get me started on beam algoses
---
&gt; Yeah wild because its shit. Supers and titans can not be killed under fax reps 
---
 I see people type shit like this about carrier ratting, rorquals or faxes and its like; all that shit got completely dumpstered earlier in the year. 
---
&gt; https://www.eveonline.com/article/pphodr/patch-notes-for-april-2019-release
---
This has got to be a bug.
---
yeah ok lemme just subscribe 20 more alts
---
Nope. Chuck Testa.
---
Superhighways across the Galaxy? Why yes thank you. Keep on the drinks hilmar.
---
&gt;  then no one will do it in null, regardless of cap risk/reward.
---
Then make something valuable come out of subcap ratting? So that if nobody does it, it gets pretty valuable?
---
ah yes.  That thing that they literally build with their playstyle 
---
If people want a free for all with no industrial macro style players there’s pubg and fortnight and the big scary carebears won’t touch you there
---
How is it a community? It's just a bunch of random people who dont know each other and botters.
---
Wish I could upvote more than once.
---
Your replying to a psyop btw
---
Anybody who is in a corp of more than 5 and has more than 1 account is a  worm ridden skunk, which only knows to spray its  'totally-not-carebear' vapors towards others whilst ignoring the 'v' key because everything is covered in system
---
Nothing has changed in catch
---
The guy your responding to is the CEO of warped intentions (legacy pet alliance)
---
What small group is making their isk in nullsec? Of all the small pvp groups in null I know/flew with they all make isk somewhere else.
---
I don't know how this hurt them it's the same as it was before which you even stated. "So unless you're under cap umbrella, you going to be dead."
---
The BR:  [https://br.inyour.space/?s=3826&amp;b=8733660&amp;e=90&amp;t=urbab](https://br.inyour.space/?s=3826&amp;b=8733660&amp;e=90&amp;t=urbab)
---
Wait wait wait BBTB and Querns aren’t the same person? This changes a great many things.
---
They actually already made a very advanced ship skinning tool that was built to be put in game.
---
They decided against it because that wouldn't be as good for microtransactions.
---
&gt;Fixed various punctuation, spelling and grammar issues.
---
Not well enough, in my opinion, given the lack of an Oxford comma.
---
Now that's an exciting idea^
---
Was the goal of your deployment to feed to Snuff nonstop?
---
IF more battles like this happen I'd for sure resub, love some good in your face brawls.
---
So same as before, but now with less chasing uncatchable bots?
---
If it means less people afk rorq mining, I don' think you'll find much sympathy.
---
Our goal is to have fun because its a video game.
---
They weren't that argent of pvpers then.
---
Iceland?
---
A long, long time ago
---
I can still remember how
---
those bookmarks made me smile
---
And I knew if I had my change
---
That I could make those bookmarks rearrange
---
And maybe I’d be happy for a while
---
bots not gone, blops fleets going strong, lots of players skilling themselves
---
game is becoming more serious, people don't give a fuck about finding fights (especially not 'fair' ones)
---
massive behind enemy lines deployments underway
---
if you're a lowsec guy who stumbles into null once in a while yea no one wants your fights plz go
---
With no extra hull bonuses to launchers?
---
Fuckit! Why not? Throw it on sisi and see what people do with it
---
Rorquals are just beefy at holding caps/super caps with heavy scrams in the mids.
---
amen brother
---
GF. I wasn't a HAW Rev though, I was just there to keep the structure paused.
---
No one is arguing about that dude. The issue is that the blackout changed a core tenet of the game without changing anything else. Which means that the balance is fked atm. Most people dont have an issue with the blackout in itself, its the lack of balance people are complaining about.
---
Atm, ratting in a sub is rather wtf. Could things change in order to improve this, sure. But its not just one change that is needed to balance the blackout, its a shitton. Which is why its a bad change, you fix one thing and break 12 others.
---
Shh, OP is one of this idiots that thinks Blackout is the reason smaller alliances struggle and half of space is dead.
---
ya'll have no imagination or creativity lol  
---
You know response fleets can break, just like any fleet?
---
crybabies in space
---
Detorid is a lot more quiet than before. Its not just a TZ thing.
---
Ye it totally changed that. Not like people can afk more with t2 drones atm.
---
giving up trying because CCP seem intent on batshit crazy ideas trying to appease to a very vocal minority of small gangers is a valid reason to not want to play anymore.  
---
before CCP decided "fuck everyone but the niche" these are people that would be solo roaming, doing small gang, or taking part or leading fleets of all sizes daily before the blackout.
---
It's probly dying already.
---
I'm sitting here mining in HS because I don't feel up for PVP tonight due to real-life stuff, happy that my corp has a good community for both activities.
---
There definitely should be other changes. But to me it seems like a lot of the anger has to do with people that absolutely do not want to adapt to anything.
---
All in all I'm against afkable stuff. I mean it's like when they break some big wormhole stuff, and almost the whole player base don't give a damn. Now they broke some nullsec habits.
---
I get it that need to be more change, but one issue here is capital&gt;subcaps even for isks
---
swap hardener for second pds, downgrade propulsion modules to enduring, swap both rigs to polycarbs or joints, swap as many i-stabs as you can for w-stabs is my train of thought looking at this fit
---
idk tho
---
Lol, which you literally could have done anytime.
---
Then why did your carebear friends disappear?
---
Then why did they stop?
---
The target situation has only gotten easier.
---
&gt; e, having all nine of them intact, isn't that an extremely low chance of happening?
---
if there were all on separate stack, that would be a 0.2% chance of a happening so that would be lucky indeed. Otherwise it would be 50%.
---
Honestly, people are morons. They wouldnt see reality if it bit them in the face. Content is way down and the MER will show it. Even zkillboard says it but people keep chanting that they are getting more fights.
---
there should be a module that increase mwd cycle but I forgot the name
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Honestly man, I dont know if these changes will actually work. These work properly for big fights (maybe some nerfs needed sure) but trying to adapt NS to roamers isnt gonna work. Instead they should focus on giving small gang content vs small gang, which is what people are saying is happening. But that should be done without NS involvement.
---
if test and GSF are blue then how are they \[killing each other right now\](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004696/201908100200/)? :thonk:
---
TIL Non-invasion pacts = blue
---
The hordes of the underworld just started pouring into Delve...
---
the main problem is. no one wants to get out off there super's  and titan's.  they wont even drop down to dreads and carrier's.  
---
In most cases it only supers that will jump because that is the only thing any one wants to use.   
---
hard to get a smaller response when no one  is on the bridge titan or no one wants to switch to a dread /  carrier.
---
You do get that VNIs bots are not linked to PLEX right? They never needed it to operate so why would they use it? PLEX is however linked to players and that drop means you have less real players in the game atm.
---
So narrative aside, this is our current reality.
---
They stopped because their only goal in eve isnt just easy ganks. It ranged across different sizes of engagement and bits of pve but no thanks to you and yours screaming louder than everyone else hilmar and co have got it into their heads that there should only be small gangs and nothing else.
---
wow. good. fcking. job. o7 just wow.. i can't even comprehend how you got water colors to do this..
---
A year\*
---
Tactics and bravery? Thats why most are flying cloaky ships now?
---
Funny you'd have completely different rhetoric if things went the other way
---
Same mechanic should apply in nullsec
---
Because the blackout is shit and people dont wanna live in a place that is about to get fked for 18 months straight?
---
You guys should neut Initiative for a month or two for fights. Seriously, they have to travel halfway across the galaxy to come fight us everyday, lol.
---
You still haven't said anything about how it has gotten harder for them at all.
---
Just lots of whining.
---
God forbid CCP try to shake things up and see what works.
---
some sigs(s?) deployed to lowsec.
---
it isn't going well for them.
---
To give you some context,
---
Garuda Union is (or was) the largest Indonesian corp in Eve Online. 
---
We had like 10-20 active people in game and yes; that number is quite small compared to any big corp.
---
We've been striving to get new players from Indonesia to play Eve Online. However, Eve Online is a complicated game. and natural selection can be pretty harsh to Indonesian players. We don't have any community support in the game and language barrier is one of the main issue too. It's like finding a needle in a haystack; but then you still have the chance to lose the needle once you've found it.
---
Basically we're trying to survive on our own in this game. 
---
We've lived in wormhole for almost 4 years. But with the reduced number of players that we had (due to RL, etc)   we couldn't stand it any longer. We tried to merge with Malaysian community (known as .HAX) to make a small alliance, but it failed. Then we tried to move to null and join one of the big alliance, but alas, it didn't work out for us. 
---
As a small community, it is pretty hard to survive in Eve Online. 
---
And that video is made by our former CEO as our farewell; it's a compilation of our fleet ops within the years of -GUN golden era.
---
o7.
---
Maybe make it one per pilot per system
---
You should be able to hack it and go through the timers in reverse. However it shouldn't show anything as happening until someone else lands on grid and tries to hack it. Turning the citadel on would of course re-enabled the security systems and break any hacking attempts.
---
Oh no, null sec is hard!
---
Why don't they make a place that is more secure?!?! they could call it...High sec!!! Yeah, that makes sense!!
---
You guys are really good at camping the Jita undock. You should stick to that.
---
might be ask to be added to https://github.com/devfleet/awesome-eve
---
I dont know if you noticed but I still uploaded the video. I didn't hide the battle report or trick you into thinking we won the fight. We had a brawl, we had fun. If we lost the objective and the isk war so be it.
---
My man, thats a narrative. Do you know how many nerfs NS has seen in the last 6 months? Prob not because people didnt bitch much about them. Thats adapting to things.
---
Changing something that has been around for a long time and is used as counters for things without giving new counters is a shitchange. Imagine if you one day say, no more Concord in HS. How do you think that would play out? Or lets remove mass restrictions on WHs so they can get blobbed to shit.
---
Its not a habit thing, trust me. Its just shit. You want to break habits then change those mechanics, dont change a core tenet for it. And the thing is, you think people are less afk now? Rorqs can just use t2 drones and not even give a shit anymore cause NPCs killing excavs was a large risk.
---
Ye and youre risking more. Thing is, cap ratting isk/investment is really really bad in comparison to subcaps. VNIs had a breakeven of like 2-3 hours or so whilst a super including skill injectors is prob far above 100. Even without the injectors its like 60h. But right now since ratting in subs has become russian roulette people are using them lots less. And why fix this plus everything else when all you need to do is remove the blackout?
---
I mean, whats the point of fixing tons of stuff, of which some are directly related to cloaky ships being massively OP in no local, instead of just removing the blackout and implementing changes that fix certain issues?
---
So, we are dealing with a war, and I just found out that the attacker can declare a DIFFERENT HQ for each war, that’s crap, that stops defenders in different wars from cooperating against the attacking alliance.
---
well realistically speaking you don't look for fights in busy systems, unless you're a blob, you let them come from said busy systems after you to try and dictate the engagement at least a little. But since his examples were all blob systems its weird to not mention some of the most active blob systems there are lately, while mentioning stuff like d-p
---
I mean, are you an idiot? Or you are really trying to play that part?
---
GF mad props to goons to actually bringing it. I always heard goons wouldnt take a more or less even fight but glad to be proved wrong!
---
Cainun, I see you stopped using HG slaves after the last few feeds.
---
Look at the goddamn armor broadcasts. My fucking sides.
---
Present a reasoned argument and then I'd have to be more than an idiot to find the problems with it.
---
The problem starts at the moment they decide to search content... so you better deliver some ships  to welp in delve XD
---
I mean hands have 5 fingers and the pentagram has 5 points..., could be on to something
---
Why do we care what you think?
---
 (°ロ°) !
---
mittens will tell them somehow they won in some way he invents... and some of the braindeads will believe
---
To drunk.
---
If mass restrictions were changed on WHs and you could get blobbed any time. Would you have an issue with it? Or if local was implemented? Or if cynos were allowed?
---
I dunno why this, I dunno what to call them? Reply chains? Got so much negativity. While I think Ganking is a terrible mechanic because of how easy it is to do, it always existed. CCP made it worse and didn't adapt the game around it.
---
But calling the Orca the end game high sec mining ship is totally accurate. Sure exhumers can out mine it, but only if you wanna offload every 2 minutes. Mining has always sucked and CCP never figured out how to make it interactive other than clicking buttons. Orca are shit in the same way Rorq are shit.
---
Yes, but they are easy to gank and you have to babysit them to offload ore every &gt;5 minutes. Orca can sit on rocks and mine in safety totally ignored.
---
You can get blobbed at any time in WH.
---
The big issue with enabling cynos is that it would actually allow so much easier travel that you could get somewhere you literally have no idea how to get to by normal flying, all while specifically bypassing a core mechanic of wormhole space.
---
And adding local to make wormholes safer doesn't benefit anyone except krabs.
---
Is there a point here? Some kind of argument? or just more nullbear drivel?
---
That's China for ya ... a clone of everything
---
It's not that you have one, it's why should we care? Everyone has an opinion. What makes yours worthy of reading  post?
---
I just don't like PVP in general
---
So you want 20-30 subs to kill a titan. And you dont see an issue in this? That people simply wont fly titans anymore for one?
---
Its called dreads.
---
This is how they could change up Maurauders to justify their cost.
---
Lol, removing cynos means all caps are dead.
---
Can you imagine what a full fleet of these would do? Like erase trillions in matter of seconds. Not broken at all.
---
At the very least it would be cool to pick like a color and everyone would get that color skin automatically.
---
it's called they're not good enough for it.
---
Seriously. Isn't this the blob that used the mass stealth bomber approach to structure grinding with the whole "No fun for our enemies" thing?
---
Dude, can you get blobbed by 1000 man? Why are you pretending to be daft?
---
You know what. You wont ever admit anything other than your narrative so this is me wasting my time. Your just an idiot, but you are in good company. Lots of you guys around.
---
You'd do well in Vegas. I hear all the games there are random.
---
....what
---
Lol, they fking shred supers but okey dude. Yet another hivemind comment without understanding of how shit works.
---
Go to highsec if you cant handle 0.0 any more
---
They do. Guys an idiot.
---
They really dont fking shred supers.  That's just incorrect.  
---
&gt;Yet another hivemind comment without understanding of how shit works.
---
Look in a mirror much?
---
I mean, it's a Chinese game AFAIK. The entirety of the Chinese economy is built upon stolen intellectual property.
---
You moron, 5 dreads rape a super. Just fking check killmails. Why are you talking shit.
---
Dude, stfu. Dont tell people what to do in a game you cunt.
---
yeah, you're the moron here.
---
5 dreads do not rape a super (particularly with a single fax with it), I have and do check killmails.  Yall really need to learn cap mechanics.
---
"Servant"
---
My big regret that fight was not switching off rep broadcasts beforehand.
---
Yea I heard this as well. Never turn on your mwd or you would get instalocked .
---
Now you bring in FAXs into the discussion? 
---
Youre a moron dude. Nobody was talking about FAX. You have an issue with those then talk about them. Dont conflate to win an argument.
---
Ye I need to learn caps. Teach me please.
---
&gt; Youre a moron dude
---
no you.
---
and im not conflating, they are only a piece of the problem, supers just have too much ehp to deal with most of the time often coupled with faxes.  They either need a nerf or getting a bomber specific to anti supers would be interesting.  Stop being naive.
---
&gt;While I think Ganking is a terrible mechanic because of how easy it is to do
---
as easy as it is to do, it's far easier to avoid and ignore
---
Exclusive to Mandarin-speakers\*
---
There. It's not racist now.
---
Man, i still solely blasterlin. I can't let go of some things from the old days
---
Man, you are just *full* of bad ideas.
---
'Victory'
---
Reminds me of the geminate 'victories'
---
I think Titans should fly alphas. Since I was born I've always wanted a nice Avatar strapped to my back. I've always wanted to be flown by a Leviathan. Is that too much to ask?
---
Or you could just take the normal bombs, buff the damage, and give them normal missile damage mechanics (ie. take into account target speed and sig. radius). Make bombs dedicated anti-capital and anti-line weapons with low damage against smaller ships.
---
Post the Rorq loss that inspired this.
---
I didn't realize PanFam had any A-tier FC's tbh
---
You are. Because plenty of supers get killed on a daily basis by handful of dreads. You just gotta use them properly.
---
Without FAXs, a super will get raped by multiple dreads every fking time. Thats a fact not an opinion. If you are talking about titans then ye, more are needed. But to completely disregard their use, which everyone knows, is a joke dude.
---
Hi this post sucks.
---
https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/5u3jCQcpdrdrMdjeQ
---
I bat phoned northern friends for the ARG Ihub timer.  Legacy placed their fleet in a pipe in the constellation in question, allowing for FRT/HORDE/NC. to trap them in and force them into an out of position engagement in EIN.
---
After a series of engagements in that system,  FRT was able to successfully win the entosis event, and drop a new ihub in ARG.  Once the hub was won, the FRT fleet disengaged and burned to protect our new structure, which successfully onlined, flipping the system back to our control.  We managed to catch the test fleet extracting in QTPP and kiled  another dozen or so hacs before heading home.
---
Props to seedow for fighting and recovering from his 'ddos'
---
ty to nc/horde for helping us out
---
see you next timer :D
---
Spin so hard its starting to deform from the forces.
---
This is a tuff one.  
---
Ratting and mining in Null is needed for TII production.  
---
Shooting krabs in null is going to make TII mods/gear more expensive. Supply / demand.  
---
But we have been shooting krabs in Null for ages, whats different from now?
---
  
---
TII gear price is still the same.  
---
Yes for now, there is still plenty of salvage in reserve from null to supply TII gear for a couple of months.  
---
Now the risk / reward is not there for Krabs, they move on to something else or de-sub so the supply is going to drop.
---
I heard CCP dev blogs have pointed to a structure based mod that shows local for the alliance that holds sov for that system.  
---
This is good for the big blocks like Goons (like this was an issue to start with) but for the smaller alliances the cost maybe prohibitive (unless the owners can share the scan intel with a coalition, (I thought this games was to encourage co-operation between players ) . So as it currently stands, this will in the end, end up to encourage a big blue Doughnut.  
---
So for the new guy who joins EvE? Welcome to Goons or stay in high sec.  
---
I do apologies, that statement is too simple, low on detail but I'm trying to make a general statement.
---
What is EvE?  
---
EvE used to be a mix of PVE ( mines and ratts to supply gear/ships) and PVP (blows other peoples stuff up).  
---
Now it seems to be heading towards like fortnight (gear and ships are magically supplied by McDonald's).  
---
My understanding is, EvE is a game on consequence, you spend days/weeks ratting/ mining to afford a BS or a Cap. Work/reward.  
---
Now it's hand over your credit card.
---
Literally had the same thought a few days back. I think the background needs a graphics update, and since its a static image, it shouldn't require better hardware.
---
good, you guys are scrubs anyways, look at your country, look at how you treat each other, look at your market places, i was there, i know how fucked up you are to each other (chinese to indonesians, and vice versa) i mean the chinese in medan were living in fucking cages because you guys raped them and rioted and stole so much shit from them. go back to your 3rd world country
---
Oh im sure i'll disapoint you soon lol
---
it's more like how many people in your fleet were spamming for reps. Imagine the PTSD of a guardian in that fleet.
---
Wow u mad? Lol.
---
\&gt;  You are. Because plenty of supers get killed on a daily basis by handful of dreads. You just gotta use them properly. 
---
Again, no you.  
---
THis is objectively incorrect just by looking at zkill.
---
\&gt; Without FAXs, a super will get raped by multiple dreads every fking  time. Thats a fact not an opinion. If you are talking about titans then  ye, more are needed. But to completely disregard their use, which  everyone knows, is a joke dude. 
---
no that is definitely an opinion...and a very incorrect one.  Dreads can kill supers but they definitely dont do it easily and it takes more than you are saying.
---
I've been told, though I don't necessarily agree, that demanding immigrants to America speak English is racist. So, that would still be racist under that mode of thinking.
---
There is in Eve though, it’s a submarine simulator
---
Or keep it as a collectable.
---
Sell it to some rube that doesn't know about expiration dates
---
These changes are a lot of what is wrong with nullsec. Lowsec and WH space are more compatible with the small gang playstyle because there are already mechanics in place (wh size limits, no bubbles, DD's don't work, bombs don't work etc.) to limit how much stuff the big guys can bring there. If small gangs want to roam through nullsec they can, but tailoring the game to that playstyle to the detriment of others is ruining the original appeal of nullsec.
---
if you could burn continuously at 10,000m/s it would take 10 days to go 1 AU.
---
Im a quarter of the way to perimeter from jita i started in 2003
---
ignore these sad clowns need more goons like you!
---
Well it doesnt have to be that far. I could have sworn ive seen stations a couple million or thousand km from planets or moons
---
Remember when the blackout was going to be the worst for goons, and everyone was going to go to their space?

that's right, your country is 80% moslem, that's why you thought it was okay to do whatever you wanted to the non moslem population, forgot, sorry. my bad.
---
I'm sure someone has, should be, it'll take forever though.
---
I don't think the Chinese corps are demanding that their members speak Mandarin; they are just making the ability to speak the language a prerequisite (which is justified, imo) for membership. Now, if a prospective member has demonstrated capacity of integrating (linguistic or otherwise) and gets rejected solely on the basis of non-Chinese ethnicity, then that would be 100% racist. I doubt that's the case though.
---
&gt; Dude, can you get blobbed by 1000 man? Why are you pretending to be daft?
---
So...you saying words that weren't what you meant are me being daft? Wtf?

I think CCP takes them off the market now when expired. Or at least the category they are in.
---
Its all in perfect sync. Something something input broadcasters re
---
It's doable in some circumstances. There are stargates that are a few thousand kilometers away from each other, you can burn between those in an interceptor in an hour or so. IIRC you can sometimes find moons that are similarly close to their parent planet that can be burned to relatively easily.
---
Beyond travelling a few thousand kilometers, though, you're really not getting anywhere fast. The absolute fastest you can go is probably chain-booshing, getting a bunch of command destroyers together and hitting a boosh every tick. You'd need at least 160 of them to keep it up, but it's theoretically feasible. That'd get you up to 100km/s, \~1/3*c*. With this speed you could go 1 AU in 17.3 days.
---
Of course, if you're *really* strict about "sub-light" and include ruling out boosh plays, at least for the ship that's doing the travelling, things get more complicated and more interesting to calculate. A Dramiel fully-fit for speed (full Overdrive systems in the lows, Auxilary Thrusters II x1 plus Auxiliary Thrusters I x2 in the rigs, and a pair of 5MN A-Type MWDs (because AFAIK you can't use 50MNs) with max-level Sleipnir pilots providing support with links can get up to \~22,250m/s. You'll want to fit dual MWDs and heat one, then shut it off right before it overheats and rep it while the other one burns. With this Dramiel and your Sleipnir alt(s) regularly microjumping to keep up, you can cross 1 AU in about 77 days.
---
So the answer to your question is technically yes, if the celestial objects are relatively close together. If they're more than 100,000km away from each other the answer is pretty safely no.
---
Did you work your way up from a Thorax?
---
No that's a rorqual, also a giant space penis
---
I am just talking in general. Idc about high sec specifically, citadels shouldn't have active defenses w/o fuel.
---
The server shutdown would put a dent in things...whats booshing?
---
Except the no one was saying it was going to be bad for goons, yall just put words into their/mouths. Olmeca, suitonia, etc. all talked about how it doesnt affect the biggest super blob in the game much and has a stronger affect on bots and alliances that only have 1 super staging
---
Using a Micro-Jump Field Generator. They're fit to Command Destroyers and when they've finished spooling up they jump everyone that isn't scrammed 100km "forward", preserving their velocity.
---
Ive been away from this game too long
---
wow little bit racist in here, you think all of us doing that ? no you scrub. you can talk in here just see in 1 city not all of them. come to borneo and see how we leaving each other. you nerd only playing game and no life can talk like that ? ppffff
---
These are all secondary changes.
---
What needs to be nerfed is the risk free ability.of bigger empires to make isk. Don't tell me it's blackout koz it's not.
---
It's region wise resource depletion that needs to happen, it's multiboxing ability of rorqs that need to go.
---
Growing big should have diminishing returns and should make your life as an administrator really fucking horrible, like how it was with any big empire.
---
Forming pentastar in front of a thetastar
---
Yeah, diet wormhole space.
---
You can easily fly between the two Jita 4-4 stations, they're only a few thousand km away from each other.
---
Yeah, they can pump out like cruiser dps, the problem usually is getting into range and web the enemy.
---
No, Concord won't fuck you over for the skin of your ship.

Jesus Christ people it's obviously a shitpost, I don't think alphas should fly Titans. Note when I said Titans should fly alphas. Also I'm a minmatar lol
---
Back to the belt spodbrain.
---
But I was talking about space dildos tho...
---
I adapted. I haven't used my 10/10 lokis or subcap ratting ships at all. Unsubbed most of my accounts. Extracting every month for 2 of the 3 left and super or boson rat just enough to keep the main plexed.
---
Faxes are just flat out better than triage carriers, especially with Capital cap injectors being a thing so they can easily tank 3-4 times the damage that Triage did. since they don't need 3 cap rigs and 6+ cap mods to not cap out during triage cycle.
---
Just don't let caps into ratting sites.
---
I need an adult.
---
I guess you watch too many fake news media, keep doing that, sir!
---
Ye exactly.
---
People would make an alt, pay the fee, steal 500 propels assets
---
These ones were never on the market, you had to sell via contracts afaik
---
Topes burned costs more than your ships, isk war won.
---
WoW classic soon. ;D
---
The comments are a nice salt mine of people crying about blackout xD
---
Honest answer, I haven't paid for a game in so long I actually had to do a double take when I was putting in my card details for this. Been plexing my toons since we won the Utu's years back :)
---
maybe have a hit chance indicator (big maybe) but we don't need the game wiping players' asses for themselves
---
if a new player doesn't want to learn how turret mechanics work, they shouldn't stick around to bloat your numbers (hey r/gatekeeping)
---
Mate, Delve is the best region in the game for pvp. There's a ton of retards to farm and less than a handful of competent people that will actively fight back or bait you. Every populated region has an umbrella for protection, but delve has both a high concentration of morons and NPC stations to stage out of.
---
GF thanks for the fight &lt;3 Elo
---
the **trees** were a mistake. we never should have left the oceans!
---
go out from ur house kiddo, dont sitting in room to long only comment shiet like this.
---
I like my Guritas with extra meat please
---
No the blackout shows that the mechanic(s) that allows huge blocs to turtle up to be basically untouchable is the real problem. 
---
And I didn´t call anyone coward for turtling up. 
---
Do you agree on the fact that having more supers than you could ever waste  is not the main problem that kills any wars/fights. Why do you think your last war didn´t give you any fights? They ran because they didn´t stand a chance against you at all. That is what kills any kind of good fights. It is not any different now after blackout, people rather move away from you, than stupidly feeding stuff to you.
---
Blackout only accelerates what would have happened anyway.
---
The fact that you don´t find fights does not mean it is fact for the whole of eve.
---
Oh and I don´t blame you for having members who excel at organizing stuff and extremly clever IT guys who come up with great tools and such. I blame CCP for introducing mechanics that enabled you guys to become untouchable from the outside and that is not the blackout. It is the fact that you can store countless numbers of supers/capitals in citadels without having to have a dedicated char for every single one, and allowing skill injectors to work on capital skills.
---
People will adapt over time to the blackout. The initial reaction is to stop playing, moving to high/low sec or join mega blocs, we will have to wait to see how they adapt after some time has gone by. But how will people adapt to endless amounts of supers? Probably by trying to get endless amounts themselves or moving to space where there are no supers.
---
I have no doubt that null would be in a healthier state if the meta shifted back to subcaps even with blackout! It would be back to high risk and high reward for everyone, and not practically no risk and high rewards for the big blocs. People can afford to replace subcaps and would be willing to take a lot of fights if they had the chance of winning fights. You guys were too clever and "exploited" the game mechanics to build your untouchable empire. Now deal with the consequences that people rather fight other players, who can´t just roflstomp them if they want to. Do you think you would get more fights if blackout ended tomorrow? And I mean actual fights and not picking on small alliances who stand no chance.
---
I'm not quite sure on the merits of taking Abaddons to fight Machariels and Napocs. When you look at the two Snuff Machs that died, both were heavily EM/Therm tanked, as they should be with a Nestor in fleet.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78321512/
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78321519/
---
Those are easily half a million EHP machs against Conflag, suprised they died at all with multiple FAX on field.
---
How is that different from any nullsec alliance
---
Past state of the game (2003-2019):  EVE is dying!
---
Current state: EVE is dying!
---
StarCitizen launch day (2034): EVE will still be dying!
---
False. No one gets into small tackle without no less than 3 pings begging for them.
---
&gt; Concord is here to assure the empires that we will behave ourselves when we enter their space.
---
If that were true you wouldn't be allowed to have wars, etc. in highsec.
---
Thought that was fear? Or is that yellow?

&gt;we're fucking bored

As an ex-director of Garuda Union, it was very hard to keep things together. It's not because of our cultural difference even for religion. It's because of most of our member have their own life and also they want to be free to do things what they like, and we respect it. As for me, I just graduated from University last month and still looking for a job. So it's very hard for me to play these days. I'll return back as soon as I have a stable life and fly with them again. To me, Garuda Union was like a family, we shared things together, we had fun together, even sometimes we fight with each other. It was quite bumped of a ride. But Thank you so much Garuda Union, the memories of our glory days will not be forgotten. I want to apologize if I acted like an ass and hurt your feelings directly or indirectly. Even though we're only a small Indonesian community. Wherever we go, we still bond together under one flag. The red and white flag of Indonesia.

Alright dude. The guy is talking about 20-30 bombers, if you drop 20-30 dreads on a super/titans it will die fast. Lets pretend that isnt the case.
---
Lets overall just pretend dreadbombs arent supers biggest concerns. Lets go with your narrative instead. And just cause people drop more isnt because its needed, its because more wanna kill them.
---
Here you go, nice km without dreads even  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77936900/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77936900/). "Hard to kill with dreads" lul.

Using EVEMon is one of those basic between-keyboard-and-chair skills that you almost have to have. 
---
1. File-&gt;Add Character. A dialog box appears, prompting for EVE login. Click the button.
---
2. A web page opens onto a page at login.eveonline.com. This is *not* EVEMon asking for your credentials, it's CCP's 3rd-party authentication server. Provide your credentials and click the LOG IN button
---
3. (If you have not used this computer to get ESI data for this account before) A page appears prompting for an authentication code. Check your email, paste the code into the field on the page, and click the CONTINUE button.
---
4. A prompt appears to select a character. Click a character portrait, and then the AUTHORIZE button.
---
5. A page appears with a long list of scopes. Scroll to the bottom and click AUTHORIZE.
---
6. A black page appears with the text "AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL The browser window can now be closed." Close the browser tab.
---
7. The EVEMon login dialog is replaced with one titled "ESI Key Import." Click the "Import" button. Your character's portrait now appears on the EVEMon main screen.
---
Now your character is imported into EVEMon, which can read skill data, skill queue, wallet balances, etc. etc. etc. Explore the UI. In particular, click Plans-&gt;Create Plan From Skill Queue... (if you don't have anything queued this will be disabled, click New Plan instead). A dialog appears prompting for a plan name. Type something and click OK.
---
A new top-level window appears. Use the Skill Browser tab to... browse skills! Various useful information appears when you select a skill, and you can "Plan To..." and be prompted for a level. If you choose a skill that has unmet prerequisites, they will be added to the plan. For example, navigate to Drones-&gt;Gallente Drone Specialization, and Plan To III. Then click over to the Plan Editor tab, and note that the Drones skill has been added to V, along with Gallente Drone Specialization I, II, and III.
---
At this point you really have to just start dicking around with the UI to see the stuff that it does. In the Plan window, there are Ship and Item browsers where you can navigate to a thing and see what skills it requires, and add them to the plan by clicking the Add All To Plan button in the lower right corner of the form.
---
Have fun.

Too soon!

Is an AU not 149.6 million km?

i'm so upset that John Hallur(CCP Realx) left.

this sound sounds like someone spent 30 mins in a DAW with their face on the keyboard while recording with some weak AF synth presets trying to sound gritty / edgy.

also the overly mixed hi hat to the right side.
---
i wonder who produced this....
---
your password generator include capital I and lowercase l which is bad from a usability standpoint.
---
Also, why can I not highlight more than 4 characters anywhere on your website?
---
&gt;no one wants to get out off there super's and titan's. they wont even drop down to dreads and carrier's.
---
Obviously. Because the people with supers and titans have them on an alt. Then they have a dread or carrier alt. And a subcap main to fight the real fight. Why reship your titan when it might be needed 20 minutes into the fight? It's dumb.
---
I needed a bit to comprehend. Now, I think it's not such a bad shitpost.
---
no people wont even log in there dread or carrier alts if they have them.
---
That's what you get with all the Jita spam for BPC sets
---
Or, maybe like,  Chinese culture is entirely different (really?) and copying is considered the first step towards mastership?

I don't see what the problem is.

Why wouldn't you want anything in your corp to be able to accept them?
---
Whats it with EVE players and Albion?
---
Ain’t gonna do that. I Was checking the merch store last Christmas and noticed this and made a post. Ccp still hasn’t done shit to fix it
---
Or skill plans? I'd love a way to share skill plans for new toons. Eve is Easy would have a lot of them to share I bet.
---
Well thats just fucking stupid. I guess those kinda people are all gonna go to goons though, so seems like a unique problem lol
---
Been there done that. Doable but pointless. Systems in eve have coordinates, thing is no one uses most of the systems’ places. It is S P A C E  after all.
---
Yes. And a day has 86400 seconds. If you travel 10km/s it takes you just over 173 days to travel an AU.
---
Jump bridges, mate. So easy to travel half the galaxy now.
---
yeah goons have the number's but thats it, half the people are to lazy to down ship or get in dictor's and tackle.  we could have  sub cap response's if people where to lazy do so.  
---
the stability off goon's is great but every day i have to say "i'm surrounded by idiot's".
---
Isn't an au 93M km? Have I had it wrong this whole time
---
What if Titan do some mining in belts? 🤔
---
Things are going great for me. Thanks though.
---
&gt;goon's is great but every day i have to say "i'm surrounded by idiot's".
---
Honestly every corp I've been in that doesn't strictly enforce doctrines winds up like this, the bigger the worse, so I guess it's not surprising
---
 Chribba used to do that stuff in his ex
---
yup its worse when there are corp that are well know for being as holes and dumb ass's.   
---
the amount off time's i heard for fc's in the defense fleet's saying "STOP FUCKING JUMPING." or "why is there a titan here i said super's jump." or the best being when you jump shield carriers in and  then the fc say "why did you jump a aeon in ? "
---
Nice, thanks.  I just set it as my Windows background :)
---
93M miles not km.
---
But what about the small casual guy who only logs in two times a week?
---
There are many different ways to recruit someone. This way is detrimental to others in that it causes massive lag in an already busy system. Why not use one mobile depot with your text as opposed to hundreds? I would like CCP to make them easier to clean up because some people use them like this. If they were used as intended the time they stay alive wouldn’t bother me.
---
I remember when you could apply any skin to any ship. Police Catalysts even had proper blinking lights. That was great.
---
Because goons don’t have the ability to rotate their rorquals between Delve, Period Basis, Fountain, and Querious. 
---
/s, if that wasn’t obvious 
---
Meanwhile, smaller groups that can’t project supercapital supremacy across several regions will suffer. Panfam, Test, Frat, and even gotg can control enough space that resource depletion won’t significantly harm them. Meanwhile, groups like Conifers or Provibloc only have one region. If they deplete all it’s resources, then they will just have to deal with the decreased rewards, because unlike goons they can’t jump to the region next door and start mining there.
---
They don't care about capsuleer wars. If we tried to attack empires- then they would react.
---
That's a veneer slapped on top of reality so thin it might as well be non-existent. Let's face facts, intellectual property theft isn't "the first step towards mastership", as the endless interminable tidal wave of low-quality knockoff products spewing out of a country barely better than third-world like the result of a sewage dam collapse can attest. It's a cheap way to quickly bolster an industrialised economy that was practically nonexistent barely 75 years ago, one more than acceptable to a nation more than familiar with straight-up ignoring pretty much every single other concept in international law as well.
---
And the thing about the Western "master/apprentice thing" you so snidely deride is that the underlying point is to *exceed* the master in every respect, to come away from your apprenticeship producing fine works of greater quality than what came before and to forge your own style and craftsmanship on the shoulders of giants. Not to steal wholesale the achievements of better men and slap some half-assed skin on top of it you crafted in an afternoon and then sell it for 50p.
---
I am disgusted but also upvoting.
---
Best part of the blackout is that it lets you catch up on all the great games youve missed the last couple of years.
---
in the lore concord was created to keep a grip on capsuleers seeing as we are all immortal demi gods and most of the people running the corporations for the major factions aren't. Capsuleers even look down on the normal humans as inferior and are usually feared. even monetarily the poorest capsuleer is likely to be richer than the richest normal human seeing as how 1isk is enough an entire family to be set for life.
---
When there are wars in high sec, it's capsuleer vs capsuleer, private corp/alliance vs private corp/alliance. 
---
concord doesn't give a shit because you're not attacking empire affiliated players/structures/etc.
---
Looks great actually, now with a proper aar it would be perfect.
---

---
Well if you check zkill there are people ganking hisec miners. https://zkillboard.com/kill/78325363/
---
This group ganked 3 Orcas just today. They're also blowing up barges.
---
But in general I think you're not wrong. It's just a drop in the bucket. The only guys getting killed in barges are probably the newbies who can't afford/fly an Orca yet.
---
Have you been to providence recently? 
---
Before blackout HTP/TRC always had bubbles up in Y-M, and you could shoot them and content would come out, as long as you were in EUTZ. 
---
If you got chased off by them, or they were busy with something else, then you could screw around in 9UY or head up towards Dital and usually get a fight. 
---
Now, you can do all of that for a couple hours and not see anyone but a travelceptor, or people sitting in tether.

Really brings back the nostalgia of all those Gurita missions I did when I started my Calari pilot.

The umbrella wouldn't be expanded, it would move with the rorqs. All this would do is make it required for us to take more sov and stomp out anyone who tries to touch it so we can cycle our fleet through the space as the resources expire.

I'm *super bad*, I've been playing since I was young, so no alts. Only recently did I get a single alt! But due to the age of my character and long ago reaching peak subcap, my main can fly a super, and has one.
---
But my firetails get more use at the moment, and is arguably more fun. We exist!

Sounds like you would benefit from a vacation away from the major coalitions? Perhaps take like-minded friends and form a new, well-drilled group, start preying on the former burdens to your mental-state by knowing response times and hard-to-save areas?

Do GOTB do anything other than eat shit when they undock.

that was pretty beautiful to watch

The Lorax would like to object, they where okay, but when they decided that chopsticks are a good way to eat rice that whole deal turned sour.

The exchange rate isn't quite that ridiculous, from memory it's something like a "middle class Caldari" could expect to earn around 10,000isk in a year. Capsuleers are still absurdly rich compared to "normal" people, but a lot of it is the *ease* of making money for a capsuleer. When you're getting your 20-million-in-20-minutes VNI ticks, that's 2,000 times more than a non-capsuleer earns in a *year*.
---
great work ;) only one Problem. you can´t Change subsystems  cause it wouldn´t look the same
---
In response to Lai Dai's interference in Intaki, some player Intaki capsuleers have been shipping huge amounts of the item Toxic Waste to Lai Dai stations and putting it on the market at higher prices than the NPC sell orders, placing the item into "Lai Dai possession" while also making it very unlikely anyone will buy it.
---
They have shipped a *huge* amount of Toxic Waste, and now Lai Dai have to work out to dispose of it. 
---
This line in the news article is Lai Dai threatening to dispose of this waste by shipping it onto the Intaki homeworld itself.

You need an align time of less than (or very close to) the MWD cycle time in order to MWD-cloak trick.
---
So you can increase agility to reduce align time... or you can increase MWD cycle time.
---
Fit some Engine Thermal Shielding and you should be good to go.
---
Really? Is that why everyone else uses it then? Who would have thought...
---
Done that, still blurry when playing at high resolutions.

It feels kinda like a pirated/knock-off shirt of a pirate t-shirt?

nah, just get together a group and bash all the war HQs

Except in EVE... In EVE it does.

I know you're probably trolling but, that is something I do think about a lot. Taking a step away from them. Maybe setting up a c1 or something with a couple friends.

Instead of taking 8 days to kill a citadel you can first wait 6 days and then kill it in 2. Resulting in a citadel dying in 8 days. Oh wait....

if they'd implement corp/alliance skins, a lot of people would stop buying other skins... so I don't think that this will ever happen. Alliance/corp logos/holograms might become a thing if we're lucky.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd absolutely love it and I think it would be great for the community aspect of eve... but skins create quite a bit of money,... so don't hold your breath.

I had a small group a few years ago that were Ninja gaz huffers in NS. That was fun.

i'm making fun of your vocabulary, not your ability to put word a over word b
---
once again, retarded globby posting
---
Yeah there was. It's a good change tbh, it was basically CCP pulling a Charon/Carbon scam on new players before, given that there's nothing in the description to say they're expired.
---
You used to be able to leave expired ones on the market too.
---
Idk my boys went out into null once last night and once tonight and found Content within about 15 minutes of flying around and not even venturing 5 jumps out from the wormhole we came in from. Fed a Sabre then dunked an X.I.X Rattlesnake (who was trying to follow us, no less) last night; then got dunked on by a TEST bomber wing tonight.
---
You may want to try yelling **WITNESS ME** at them harder
---
&gt; That'd get you up to 100km/s
---
A 50mn magus can get up to 13km/s, so you'd be up to 113km/s with booshes.
---
Not that it changes much...
---
&gt;what's better? 
---
[:thinking:](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78201466/)
---
As a solo player, I had fun in a shattered wormhole. I had one alt doing combat sites, another alt mining gas, and a third alt flew an industrial ship to store loot and gas. All three were under one account. Shattered wormholes are more abundant in sites, and respawn sites quicker, so they're great for solo. Since no-one can put down structures in a shattered wormhole system, no-one moves into them either.  At least that was my experience.

Well that's half the fun. Avoiding the umbrella and making them feel useless as they can't use it against you.

I get what youre saying. But its not really tactics in that sense and its certainly not bravery. Sitting cloaked and picking off easy targets is cowardice in my book, not bravery.

I have heard someone moving from system to next one without jumping. And it sounded that they have managed to reach the system but as switching systems is not possible without session change and it needs jumping through gates they still haven‘t entered target system.
---
Might be myth.
---
Mission flipping still works (combat scanning highsec mission runners, trying to get them upset by looting their wrecks, salvaging them, shooting their MTU, etc., to make them shoot you with their pve boat, then killing their raven in your ishkur or so). It is hilarious, would recommend it.

What about adding the color green to corp logos.

They could do Corp as an overlay on other skins. So you could have a CODE police catalyst skin for example

Yeah I would say that’s a myth, system are effectively independent areas

No I don't.

God don’t put D-P on the list for fights that like putting 1DQ on it

that's what I was trying to say with logo/hologram or alike. Yes, I think that would be an option, but not "complete" skins

&gt; in the lore
---
Ha ha ha!
---
Elite PVP
---
Spodatar best tar
---
Another idea would be to allow the alliance to designate a certain number of doctrine ship skins for some monthly cost.
---
I think if you remove time as a factor it's still not technically possible because the systems are on different physical hardware and without the software transfer from one node to another activated via a gate you will probably just travel off in what ever direction your going for an infinite amount of time, or you'll have an invisible wall.
---
Theory obv its not something I can test but its probably accurate.
---
OPSEC!
---
Test drops even more than goons
---
Ah yess because everyone isn’t happy until they have large scale conflicts with each other. Perhaps they play the game for themselves instead of for you?

Test has always has Non-invasion pacts since montolio.

All i see is the same retards on here coming up with the same bullshit ideas all the time.
---
All you fuckers want is a barrel full of fish and a stick of dynamite to kill them with. That's not eve, shit takes time to do things . If you want that kind of gameplay go fuck off and play an FPS instead of acting like the massive little spoilt bitches that you are..
---
Too much? I live in null. There's a difference pal. Wormholes vary far more. I never said I lived in wormspace. That lifestyle is more for twibs and nubs. There only difference in seeing  the information instead of having to hunt it down in 3rd party sites is ... ummm simplicity. And you got panties in a bunch. Over simplicity.  
---
My post is about players NOT living in wormspace. Those who create daily logs and Pathfinder charts. It's a chore and can easily be fixed. 
---
God you're dumb.
---
I bet hes selling them out of a Brave Keepstar.
---
That's a neat corp, but i do agree with the overall sentiment of the people here, it's causing server stress and it should be removed.
---
By the way, ive seen the depots stationed there and they seem to form a symbol in Chinese lettering. What exactly does it say?
---
Nah it's a high sec system so there's just one Gallente Station hub.
---
Are you claiming if I have a webpage open it's far better than having it seen in-game? If your are... I feel for you pal. You've gone muppet.
---
Exactly. Ive seen people advertise in Polish, Russian, German, French, etc. How would advertising in Mandarin be any different?
---
because it adds in unnecessary complexity for no effective reason
---
Or bring a damping ship as a counter? Or your own ECM? Or use drones to kill it? Or primary it and alpha it off the field? Or bring something fast to chase them off grid (Garmur, Stiletto, Malediction)... etc. etc. etc.
---
or just a way to hide the actual horns inside a wizard hat that somewhat resembles their shape...
---
yeah, not if the're using lookup tables for the celestial's positions, all the complex math is done once for a year's worth of positional data, and that calculation can be done independent of the game servers, then each downtime all their doing is asking what day it is, and looking up the new position for each celestial from this pre calculated table.
---
Or are you talking about for the players?
---
can't upvote this enough...
---
i said several things there, do you wanna point out what you're referencing?
---
well what gameplay mechanic does it break how about we start with that.
---
If you care about keeping those two you better remove this post.
---
You're fucking bored, and NO ONE gives a fuck... sit in your fucking swamp all day...
---
i didn't say it did, i'm saying it could
---
how do you pair bookmarks with celestials? what's the cutoff point?
---
Buy my fedos y'all!
---
I mean... access list bookmarks were announced just recently so it should be coming soon... 
---
So maybe within the next two years even :P
---
Wait until "pros" show up telling you not to mine and not to do missions, just generate ISK out of thin air like some fucking windmill...
---
Closest celestial, I guess if there isnt one within a reasonable distance like less than 1au or something then use the star.
---
Worst case scenario as I a player makes a deep safe, in 6 months it might be right on top of a planet or station, like is that really a massive issue tho ?, they could easily deal with that by having two types of bookmarks, the ones on grid with things that can easily get this parent child relationship and be fixed in a relative position to their parent object, and then a second type that's not on grid with something that's parent becomes the sun and it's relative position is saved by the sun.
---
The later type would or could result in your bookmark moving over say 6 months and going from being a deep deep safe to being next to a player station or on top of a planet, I don't really see this as an issue tho if the players are using the bookmarks regularly they can just update them themselves, or they might actually like the new location it could be even better than where they initially put it as the planets and celestials all move around.
---
As Benzh suggested, do them all. Might take some time to train your skills up, but its worth it. I chose a high sec system with close null and low pockets as a staging point and set up a hecate, stratios, brutix, megathron, orca and a gila. I rotate between exploration, combat sites, abyssal deadspace, mining and ive got the tools and opportunities to do pvp if  I wanted to. You dont have to focus on 1 thing but rather choose a starting point and expand skillwise from therd.
---
Good today I learned globby is a good poster
---
I'm sure it's doable.  It's just also pointless because it adds 0 gameplay.
---
Did you know you can import skill queues in Eve?
---
It's in the hamburger menu. 'replace skill queue with skills listed in clipboard'
---
Distribution is, of course, an issue.
---
Yea it’s good to see. Everyone shits on goons for being sold brains and not lining pvp.
---
They come and pvp have fun with no SPACE SERIOUS objective  everyone shits on goons for pvp ing :Thonk:
---
Its inaccurate.  It rarely pulls all the kills in a fight anymore, hell it rarely pulls most of the kills in a fight anymore.  Its nearly useless to get a picture of what happened.
---
bruh, look at this dude
---
Yeah i'm not sure about that really, I think explorers would enjoy that the space around them is changing every day even if just by a few km, over time over 6 months these changes could be prety big, or even tactical for a war.
---
Hypothetically , you could have a bunch of stations all in close orbits and once per year align and are all super close to enough other, could be the perfect time for a hostile fleet to attack and take advantage of this change in proximity.. I dunno Im sure like everything else players would find a way to use this to their advantage, ways we cant even imagine right now.
---
So I'm not sure that saying it would add zero game play is actually accurate, id say it adds no immediately recognisable game play, but would have the potential to be really really cool.
---
They absolutely do. LoL has one of the most toxic communities out of any game you can play, 100%, 2nd is CSGO... and you can't give away your stuff so that wouldn't make sense. In WoW, asking people for their gold/things that are not bound happens all the time.
---
Can I have your stuff? Lol seriously it's Internet and people are really toxic in everywhere and every time
---
## bruh 💯💯🙌👏👏
---
Wrong, you can't spin Supercaps in Stations! =(
---
New station, new timer.
---
Ah, I figured as much. Thanks!
---
\&gt;That'd get you up to 100km/s, \~1/3*c*. 
---
Off by a factor 1000 there mate
---
That is fucking glorious.
---
We did that with AVOXU and joined snuff
---
I wonder how the fight might have played out if the Harb fleet had a boosher or two (i.e. able to dump them right on top of the Feroxes).
---
Also, I'm amazed how easily the ProviBloc logi fed in that fight. They weren't being alpha'd off and I think I only saw one case where reps landed on an active target - who was already in strucutre. Given the armour reps weren't cycling in time to land before enough DPS was applied to kill them, a competent logi-commander would have changed tactics right after the second loss - e.g. ordering each Guardian pilot to drop two reps down the cap-chain and keep the other two free for the current DPS target. This should buy enough time to ensure the squad has the ability to de-cycle and recycle their 6-10 spare reppers across the wing as needed until damage changes to the DPS.
---
Man if it’s one thing the the blackout had done.. its highlighting the amount of bleeding vaginas we have playing Eve today.
---
Imagine coming onto reddit, like this brave man, and publicly declaring that you obviously don't even fucking log in. Completely unaware of what his alliance is up to... And he's gonna go to war for them on an internet forum anyway. Lol.
---
fuck of globby
---
Can spin Supercaps tho.
---
&gt;Content is way down and the MER will show it.
---
So you're making the claim based not on data but on your personal experience, since you about the mer data isn't out yet.
---
Hey watch this awesome country to your argument:
---
Content is way up and the MER will show it.
---
Tadaaaaa
---
Deep safe one month inside a moon the next
---
To all the fools claiming null is dead and you can't find anything to kill to anywhere except a few systems- 
---
Have you heard of baiting? 
---
You'll instantly get content in null with it. But you gotta have the mindset to risk losing your ships. Stop being so risk averse ya fokin' null beers! :P
---
I used to get about 1400 close to 1500 dps with Cruise, shouldn't RHML deal more damage?
---
So you want to break things for... 0 gains?
---
“ I burld ur shipz!!”
---
Yeah all good I'm familiar, thank you mate.
---
We already have corps that put up skill plans for doctrines, but having a public repo would be so, so sweet.
---
I’d like to upgrade my Honda Civic to a Ferrari plz.
---
Because in wow, you can't give the good stuff anyway.
---
Lol doesn't even have stuff to give.
---
The career missions are templates or show cases for what the game has to offer activity wise. Do t take them as actual real strict pathways. This isn’t a theme park MMO. You literally can do anything you want if you have the means, the interest and the method.
---
Tbf, a lot of newbies don’t realize that the tiny amount of isk they make doing those missions and mining in HS is a pittance compared to what they could be making. They don’t know what they don’t know.
---
One year for the farthest? Are ye daft son? That would put them only as far out as the third rock from the sun. Go realistic or not at all.
---
You have replied thrice to yourself.
---
Its a game dude not reality they can map the furthest in each system to a year no problem lol.
---
If you think the MER is up then youre an idiot. Tadaaaa

Aww dont like the truth? If you cant handle 0.0 now and instead stopped playing then highsec is where you belong.

eh ? I replied to this guy.

FWIK the FC running Provi's fleet was a little rusty, so it's all just a good learning experience. Still, having a good Logi FC is the difference between life or death, and an aspect of the game that doesn't get quite the attention put onto it that it probably should. One of these days I'll have to LFC and make a video on that!
---
Amazing as it may seem all the big entities batphone for fights that are important to them FRT’s done it all through the war. Legacy has done it all through the war. Can we stop pretending it’s dishonourable and frowned upon by more than reddit armchair FCs? The nice thing about this fight is that there was an actual fight and no one got blue balls. Congrats all around.
---
I see the issue. 
---
You came to reddit to get a thoughtful reply to a serious question.
---
I will not say mistake #1 because it was the ultimate mistake. Have a great day!
---
Now that’s what I’m talking about! :D
---
Truth? Dude, you wouldnt know what that is even if it crawled up your ass. So back under your rock you teenager.
---
&gt; Jesus Christ people it's obviously a shitpost
---
nono, this is a post that is shit
---
I'm waiting for someone to do a typical PvP video with dubstep and annoying graphics but for market PvP. Would be instant gold
---
ah okay. thought there was some trick i was missing. very nice timing!
---
I'm after your blood pressure.
---
CCPlz!
---
Oh please don't go. Stay. We can work things out, I'll change, I promise. I didn't mean to hurt you, it was just the spod talking
---
Well, when all the PvE/miners are gone, you may feel differently.
---
I would also like to add that sharing a common, non-predominant language can also foster a stronger sense of camaraderie. English is such a global language nowadays that finding out that you share a non-English language with someone else on the internet can be a delight, especially in an environment like EVE (I mean Tranquility, duh; obviously not Serenity), where English is seen as more-or-less the "default language". So IMO it's a good thing to have corps built on common languages.
---
I do have to agree that it is annoying though. I speak (Mandarin) Chinese, and that makes those ads that much harder to be filtered out, as I can't NOT understand what the ads are saying. I wish I could toggle my language abilities on and off. Just turn off the English part when I am in China, and toggle off the Chinese part when I am playing WoW or EVE; that'll make my life much simpler.
---
Why are you guys downvoting him?  Seems like a reasonable question.
---
You kidding? I saw like 200 t1 small -large drones left by a gate while on my way to a 10/10 in my typhoon and i spent like 20 mins scooping shit. For like a few mil in drones. They are still at that system in that citadel. 
---
I still have no clue why I did that
---
Whats that, gameplay with tradeoffs? Whatever shall we do!
---
I mean, people are pretty toxic on this sub and CCP does condone such behaviour to an extent quite frankly. But other gaming communities are also highly toxic so its not just Eve.
---
Have fun on your break.

You sound like my uncle after a long night, I'm turned on but I don't know why. :(

Seriously though, I didn't want it to come across as one of those posts, I actually wanted different perspectives.
---
What if this game isn’t about making isk?
---
If it were a psyop thread, it would be much darker.  I don't go there.  I'm not even going to mention how much time you could have been spending with your family.  
---
I'm not.
---
But if a game mechanic leads to less fear, than it's doing good right?
---
Yeah fighting agaibst bots is so good
---
Why are you still playing then?

When you have to lash out at other players, perhaps you're not happy.

Stating claims about data you have not seen is also pretty far up on the list of idiotic actions. Let me guess - you never studied any sort of science or engineering?
---
It isn’t for a lot of people but a lot of the fun things people may want to do does cost isk much like real life.
---
Bitch please.

And bitch please.

You, sir, cannot imagine what my butthole can handle! :p
---
Incest is only degenerate if you get caught?
---
I kinda assume that the sort of folks who could make a video about their market are the ones stocking mission hubs and shipping between regions and doing stuff in lowsec for dank risk:reward. I think there's not a lot of .01 botting in those places.
---
Didn’t they already have an episode of EVE hoarders? 🤔🥴
---
But do they have the red cross suitcase damage control icon? That's the important question.

Salvagation?
---
Legacy and CFC.
---
Getting told to quit is common in literally every mainline MMO and has been since the days of Everquest. Source: This was common on the EQ forums in 2000. FFXI in 2003. EQOA in 2003. WoW in 2005 and so on. Posting threads like those is nothing but attention whoring and people call you on it.
---
Look at the reaction you expected. You post a thread fishing for positive attention. People aren't blind. They know what you are doing and thus they tell you to quit. Also, it's a video game dude. Quitting or not is not a serious decision.
---
Stop being salty panini
---
Those are the same tho
---
Upgrade would be cool.
---
this is being worked on. they have an actual design and are working on it.
---
Actually hs missions or ice mining is only like 25/100 less payout than null.
---
OP is lying through his teeth. This is the thread he posted:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cnlqac/should_i_take_a_break/
---
use interceptor :)
---
Can I have the rest of your stuff?
---
You unlock it once you lose your first titan
---
Market salt best salt.
---
I kinda like it if you dont include 0.9 plus systems.
---
Sure, np.
---
The MWD-cloak trick works by getting to at least 70% of base speed in one cycle of MWD (under cloak) so when it ends and you decloak you are fully aligned. By increasing the cycle time of the MWD you have more time to ramp up speed.
---
Make sure to simulate in pyfa!
---
Yeah head cannon if you ignore test/goons/gotg tag teaming pan fam and test and goons doing the same thing to frat right now lol.
---
What's rng about it?
---
All it really does is stop scrubs from running near2 and makes people have to pay attention. 
---
You are still perfectly capable of defending your space so I really don’t see what all the tears are for.
---
That's really awesome.
---
I mean, I literally said the mer isn't out yet that's why your claim is not based on any evidence but your personal experience. 
---
Reading comprehension is difficult for you. Try harder.
---
Ok, found the issue here. There was one last system that was using a different capitalization for EVE than the rest of the code, and that trickled down to the item action form. This has been fixed.
---
What kind of bizarre language are they using that doesn't have traceback tooling for this kind of task?
---
Either way I doubt this is the primary reason. They can remove them from the UX without gutting the internal POS code.
---
Don't be a killjoy... all dying is good in Eve - if feeds the circle of life.
---
This may or not be good flying but it's damn good dying!
---
I like the explo bonuses I get from the Astero...is it a viable strategy to just use the interceptor to run booty from NPC null to the market and just leave my Astero in Null at an NPC station?
---
I will definitely consider that. Though at this stage, I am realizing that my app is probably still in beta.
---
You should know you've been replying to the parent thread rather than directly to the people who have been helping you.
---
Scan a wormhole down that leads to high sec and avoid the Null sec entrance gate camps?
---
show all on overview, usually there are cans scattered around the warpin points at the edge of the bubble.
---
don't wait for thera, use any lowsec or highsec wh.
---
check zkill for possible treats, use another exit from nullsec.
---
start gatecamping yourself and get your relic loot from the wrecks of other explorers.
---
I'd set up a couple of secure containers in safes to cache your loot. Once you get a good hole back to hs then pick it back up. This let's you mitigate your risk, but requires some patience.
---
Have you tried warping to the exit via an unexpected direction? 
---
Do *not* warp gate-to-gate. That's the scrub way to fly in null. Look at the solar-system map. Find something way off to the side. Warp there. *Then* warp to the exit.
---
That’s a viable option or you could also asset safety the loot to lowsec if you don’t want to deal with the gatecamp. It’s also worth taking an interceptor and making 250km+ bookmarks in directions off gates that are not in line where you warp from. That way you won’t get dragged in the bubble and can warp in cloaked to scout the gate and then gtfo if it’s camped etc.
---
I'm a strong advocate for both sides. I just think it's funny how there's players that try to flex, like claiming to be an elite PvPer makes them some hardcore badass. I've seen some of these weight watcher rejects and they're the farthest thing from it.  How tough are you really sitting in front of a computer screen, playing a sci-fi spaceship MMO, and eating Hot Pockets?
---
i cant im trying mapache but i just cant!!!! 🤬🤬🤬 😂
---
Yes I understand how the trick works... that gimp fit I posted would have 9.something s align time with my hauler pilot.
---
Not sure if pyfa can show the MWD cycle time... maybe in the module stats window?
---

---
Bud they don't do any merch. This had nothing to do with your talent. You are in fact, incredibly talented, and I would buy a print of this instantly.
---
Awesome.
---
If this works like this older site that was never updated, then I'm going to love it!!
---
This is golden
---
naw I am pretty good at avoiding bubbles behind or between gates. Its the ones on gates I struggle with.
---
Find your own wormhole that doesn't use Thera.
---
You might find a direct highsec from null without even having to go to jspace.
---
Thats what I was wondering, I will double check my overview
---
10% tidie for 3 and a half hours.lost a scimi but reshiped, got a full green kill board from caps and fighters alone.
---
Gf legacy, see you in 7 days I guess.
---
Bastards.. :D
---
I think I understand how secure containers work. To be clear though, they would need to be combat scanned and then attacked, setting off a timer before they can be looted right?
---
Wow a full green killboard and you only had to sit in 10% tidi for 3 hours!!
---
You can't just decide to copy existing work, then call them some sort of mentor that was never agreed upon...
---
Ahh, ok lol. I uhh, may have blocked that moron. Sorry.
---
Ba dum tssss
---
How you're getting decloaked if you do that is beyond me. If the campers have put *that much* junk on the gate, then go find a different route home. 
---
You *do* have an overview tab to see stuff littered on the gate, yes?
---
Depends on the fit
---
XiX isn't legacy.
---
not when they are losing anyway :joycat:
---
I am double checking to make sure I don't have containers and other junk filtered. Its very likely something was getting within my 2000m and I am suspecting its on the edge of the bubbles because the decloak happens almost immediately.
---
I will try to learn more about navigating WH. I use Eve-scout to get to Thera but I know there are other mappers.
---
TEST Narrative: An EVEN battle guys!

Actual Event: 140bil lost vs 40

This market pvp needs a blackout, so Elitists can gank that Salvager Market.

Could at least try not to be a dumpster tier poster for once?

*before anything else can we talk about cruise missile on bomber ?*
---
Extorting people in eve is somewhat annoying these days. So many people have taken the "we dont negotiate with terrorists" mindset that they will rather hurt themselves for no reason than make a deal with a pirate. I dont ask for money when i extort people these days, there's really no point since people will not pay or they will offer amounts that are more insults than offers. 
---
I extort peoples ships from them, "eject or your pod dies with your ship". Sadly even that doesnt help with people. My favorite case about that is dude flying 1 billion isk tengu in 3 billion isk pod. he would rather let his pod die than give me his tengu, because of honor or some other shit like that.
---
Hop on Sisi and find out. =)
---
You can buy just about anything for 100 isk, and play around with whatever you're testing. Then when you figure out what works, come back to TQ and implement it.
---
Fixed what?
---
lol
---
What is Sisi?
---
C1-3's will have Kspace exits just keep looking in WH space until you find a HS that suits you. and more sites to do in said WH's anything with a pirate name is good, except covert sites stay away from those in an astero
---
if you have another account you can scout ahead also
---
Good fight TEST.
---
Bah, I don't need a counter to spin my ships - dang whippersnappers.
---
Warp from a celestial that's not roughly at a similar direction from another gate. Slow burn toward the gate but make sure there is no interdiction probe or mobile bubble on your path. To make sure, have a "decloakers" overview tab. When slow burning to take the gate, spam your mwd key in case you get decloaked. When you are below 10km distance, one cycle MWD should be enough even if you get decloaked in most situations.
---
Wasn't there for the main first, but came in with the reinforcement fleet to help clean up.
---
Full green killboard + #3 Vigil pilot. :^)
---
Good fest TEST! o7
---
For some reason I thought this was on their road map at one point.. but maybe I'm misremembering.
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
Lol yes obviously that’s pleb status.
---
They can’t be scanned
---
I did notice how many more Snuff Machs caught reps compared to Villore Machs. Pretty much every target that spec-tanked lived, and every target that stayed EANM + Kin/Therm/EXPL died until the Abaddons lost critical mass.
---
All those tapi carriers and faxes sure were.
---
You know the fight is awesome when your in tidi tunnel and called targets are already dying. GF
---
But your fit doesnt have a 9 second align time *with prop on* which is the important part.
---
Yes, if you show module stats it shows base stats as well as current stats on the fit.
---
I agree with Razza's answer. I think that is the way to go. Use something like Pathfinder or Tripwire and you can instantly find out the statics when you jump in the hole. If it's a c1-3 then look at the statics for a high / low sec exit. Scan it down and leave that way. If it's a c4, look for a c1-3 and use the statics in the c1-3.
---
yet another BR site... great
---
The Spod is strong with you,  young padwan!
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78331941/
---
He self destructed in 86% armour because legacy and co decided to stand down while their whole cap fleet was still tackled.
---
Must really want that shitty raitaru dead. Here's to hoping they bring just as much for the final timer.
---
Also maybe structures aren't designed for solo use
---
im kind of a newer pilot but i highly recommend using wormholes to travel in and out if nullsec. there are comparatively few lanes from no sec to sec and those areas are usually contested for their ease of access to “content” and are few enough in number that most will have regular gatecamps full of savvy pilots that know all the best tricks to catch stealth ships.
---
learning to organize bookmarks and learning what the description text for the wormholes are the only two things you need to really get started reliably navigating W-space you can practice in just about any ship as well since wormhole signatures are fairly easily scannable in something like a venture even
---
i'll take that bet
---
my little isk per hour, let us maximize and push f1 let me ve be elite with those ticks!
---
Test server. Click on this thing on your launcher, https://i.imgur.com/s8Ct3OX.png and select Singularity.
---
I'm sure there are body kits for that on ebay.
---
in hisec you pay taxes to npc.
---
Or, you know, dualrep fits.
---
Is it a missed joke if its a bad one?
---
Yeah I know that feeling, in elite dangerous was the same way, most of the times I end Up disabling and hatching their cargo or desteoying their ship... In my opinion its better to lose some money than losing all of it... 
---
But people that are behind their screens have +1000 ego...

Ahoy!

AAR: Legacy for the past few weeks has been taking Winter Co I-hubs in Detorid, Wicked Creek and Scalding Pass including ARG-3R. The timer came out at approximately 0100 and a fairly deadlock entosis battle went on while the sub-capital fleets waited on either side of the EIN-QG &amp; JMH-PT gate.
---
Initially, Legacy faced a Winter Co fleet and a PanFam fleet (approximately 220 Muninns in total) with 180 Muninns. Shortly after the battle starts, Legacy brought in 15 capitals and PanFam brought in a small fleet of assorted frigates and cruisers.
---
Legacy did eventually lose the I-hub however, was able to control the grid of the battle. Not in the video, Winter Co. did some work to keep our capitals on grid to possibly dread bomb however, all but one were able to extract. I do not have first hand info about the entosis-related battles that were going on throughout the constellation.
---
I had a blast with this battle and I imagine everyone involved did as well, gf all around!
---
he had fun and isnt bitter
---
Okay
---
I've been in longer tidi fights for less. I've also spent longer on grid in a fight with no tidi.
---
Oh ok, thanks!
---
I'll be interested in a event that allows us to attack empire space. Just to show how powerful the empires are.
---
Holy shit at the amount of the koolaid you must have consumed to actually believe this.
---
see you o7 thx for the fight &lt;3
---
3hrs in tidi is soul crushing
---
How do you determine the up and down of our solar system then?
---
Whose Raitaru was it?
---
What do you mean? They can spawn NPCs until the servers melt, then what?
---
There isn't. 
---
EVE has orientation in space though, the devs even put time in for orientation details for the sensor overlay.
---
Frat
---
Origin.
---
FRAT Raitaru
---
&gt; I had a blast with this battle and I imagine everyone involved did as well, gf all around!

I came in with the reinforcement fleet. Had a lot of fun helping clean up. GF o7
---
Lmao you poor guy, show me where the tidi touched you
---
Don't assume my gender, Nazi!
---
Well that's if they do it badly. 
---
It would be untill the drop the hammer And just out right kick any thing aside with there iapetan titan fleet's. Probly be in low sec.
---
My brain
---
well man i ve been a goon for 2 years... there s nothing to explain you ll realize eventually
---
Neat? No fuck them!
---
Not unless you really bling the fit. We're also talking about PvP here, so RHMLs are firing Navy ammo, not Fury. 
---
Cruise may be better DPS on paper, but won't apply at all, so it's a moot point.
---
1070 would work pretty well.
---
It get rf’d?
---
Seems to be the way to go. I'll give that a shot.
---
Oh ok good to know
---
I look forward to the next timer!
---
Panfam shows up = everyone has more fun!
---
Nice stuff
---
yeah
---
Did you know, you can have up to 8 overview tabs.
---
What i mean is, that there is no restraint. They can make them as strong as they want. It could be a pushover or impossible.
---
Well I suspect at Frist it would be small response fleets not orginced or rushed to form. Then slowly work up to them just saying fuck you eat shit.
---
Mine :)
---
My experience with tools like pyfa and (the late lamented) EFT is that they will *never* show a &lt;10s align time with MWD on for a fit that works with the cloak trick. The trick only works when you're starting from a dead stop (or at least that's the application I'm interested in) so the ship doesn't actually have to "align" in the sense of changing direction, it just has to accelerate into warp in 1 MWD cycle.
---
In any case I'm looking forward to messing with this rig. I'm wondering it it gets an Orca close to using the trick...
---
...hey wait, its upside down [de'ja vous]
---
Asset safety but only for stuff people already paid an asset safety fee for.  Removing asset safety at the final timer would be the same as removing it altogether (because inventory enters asset safety when a structure is destroyed unless it is put into asset safety beforehand) and I doubt that will ever happen.
---
People still fight over sov ? You poor slobs
---
Wait someone pinged for a lowly Raitaru and you all actual formed to save it? Sheesh y'all starved for content 😆
---
But your ship can so do your thing and go. Be sure to bookmark
---
this is a remarkably russian video, beautiful
---
&gt;1024 vs 396
---
Umm... so what happened with the "Frat is so outnumbered" narrative?
---
You don't need a mapper for this, by the way. Just bookmark consistently, and you'll be fine. The key is to have some symbol to indicate "back the way I came".
---
I'm not actually, since all moves are done without an observer ie during down time the player wont ever see the thing move, they will just see it all in its new position for the next 24 hours.
---
You would be right tho if the orbits were real time and moving while players were flying around but that's not what I am suggesting.
---
&gt;this is a remarkably russian video, beautiful
---
thanks bro
---
Goons and PIBC didn't arrive in time
---
I want to fight Chinese players. Scorched Earth with the intent to drive them from the server. What is the best Corp or way to go about this?
---
Do we know how long it takes to get a new ship to maximum rust/dirt?
---
let it go bisu
---
Go to any citadel in NS, open the cargo and drop off your loot in there, then asset safety it back to LS, and from there it will be much easier to bring it to HS.
---
Which resulted in way more objectives completed for as long as it lasted, until TEST's deployment forced them to go back home and take care of it. Seemingly they did.
---
I understand, I just went through all my asset safety shit, jf'd all the ships n mods to staging just so I could look at them in my hangar n containers. I look forward to the day I have to make 10 extra trips just to move the shit out when staging moves.
---
368 people on Test Side vs 560 on winter co side. One of the most fun fights I've ever done. o7 winter co.

Ooooooh I love that
---
NPE overhaul incoming.
---
This ship is terrible, I'm sorry to say.  You are trying to make it do too much.  Get a Heron or other covops type frig for exploration.  
---
Do this instead:  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration)
---
With a clone bay, it has the ability to undock ships without gating into system and then cov op cyno and drop over a significant part over Tenerefis. 46DP is too far away from Immensea to cov op cyno/jump anything in, even though it's "next door"
---
Anything anchored in 46DP is a significant foothold for WinterCo &amp; Friends (primarily frat)
---
NOH. Were still here &lt;/3
---
You just described every eve player, not just the PvPers.  It's just that some of us are also good at PvP.
---
remove all structures except giant secure container
---
No matter how much better the Loki or tengu may be, the proteus will hold a special place of fear in my heart
---
I sense you’re a strong advocate for both sides! 
---
Play the game you enjoy and try not to get irate with others that’s my advice
---
always having been a shit game for the entirety of existence is always a bad idea see: wOw
---
I give it 1-5 years, based on whether or not Hilmtard dies to it or not.
---
People that said Abyssmal mods would break the game are objectively right now!
---
you are really desperate for relevancy
---
Okay but only if you remove rorquals access to mining drones and excavators as well. Tbh I would be really happy if orcas lost mining drones for the ability to compress ore.
---
That br report generator on mobile 💥
---
You don't need a citadel to covert drop anyone. Used to hunt out of giant secured cans all over the south with just cloaking and covert cyno alts and a fuel truck
---
Tapirium*
---
That is correct. 
---
However, it's easier for frat to undock with a cloaky ship via clone bay instead of gating through the 77S8 gate that is already heavily watched.
---
46DP is too far away from 77S8 to cyno/jump in, so having a clone bay and ships stocked in the raitaru makes staging and dropping over tene much easier.
---
it will sit cloaked behind you, keeping at range 5km
---
Just probe signatures as you go and scan down wormholes. Once inside a wormhole keep probing until you get to k-space. All wormholes (excluding shattered) have a static and should eventually lead to k-space.
---
Someone lost a super over a Raitaru. They are like 45 cents. Just drop another one. 😒
---
For fast loot and salvage, salvage drones + mobile tractor unit is quick and less input intensive. Make sure to drop the tractor unit early
---
Your ship looks fine for doing low level sites and missions
---
A post worthy of upvotes that isn't a shitty meme or some one sided AAR, how rare.
---
Frat seems to be doing just that. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon, obviously.
---
I've always managed to escape.
---
I'd use JS over PHP any day.
---
With Civilian Miners, of course?
---
How is albion now days ? I left it 1 year ago for eve.
---
put blasters on it and put an expanded probe launcher on it. scan down MTUs and shoot them
---
DT is like around China prime right?
---
Horde comms is always a good time.
---
True but you're the minority of the minority
---
no its my vni and not being able to launch 5 heavy drones is just wrong.
---
Not bad.  I still can't get used to the fact that someone 20 levels higher doesn't come in and stab me in the back 87 times while I'm chopping trees and then say "gf".
---
You say that like it's a bad thing.  What I see as an issue is dropping supers and titans on any subcap fleet or fleets with impunity.  Having super and titan pilots hesitate is a good thing.
---
Never ever use this garbage BR tool ...
---
Haha yah ive had that happen alot, is game dead or ? No openworld pvp anymore ?
---
Would rather see increased salvage/fitting drops on LP structures than a capture feature. Not sure how they'd implement but anything to reduce the actual number of structures instead of just flipping them back and forth.
---
That cant be true! Everyone knows  Legacy blobs winterCo in every fight.
---
Yes as far as getting Haven's and sanctums to spawn.
---
in regions with NPC systems as well?
---
That's true, I didn't really think of that
---
yeah that's a good point, not really sure how to transfer that feature over then
---
Way to resort to insults instead of anything of substance kid.
---
it should be removed altogether in null.
---
No they use it because eve players hate change so much that they will rather continue to use a clearly broken tool because it used to work over just using one that works.
---
In lore, they're super powerful.
---
In game, they're kind of a joke. If you're their arch enemy, a KOS, you can just enter their space and they'll shout at you until you warp off, then do the same in the next system, and the next...
---
Even in situations where they're meant to "look powerful", like in set pieces in missions (see SoE arc), you see the "might" of eg the caldari empire in a fleet of 10 ravens.
---
IMO CCP could probably do something to start fixing this giant difference in lore vs game, but i don't think it's very high on their list.
---
Well we just left - they didn't pre-tackle before super escalation.
---
Ok
---
I think they more need to open source it and review the comunity improvement to the app and decide what to publish.
---
Tech 1 ships, especially destroyers, are not designed to be particularly flexible. Each ship is given bonuses that make it excel at a specific role. Attempting to make your corm salvage and scan in addition to fighting is asking too much of it, diluting its intended role and providing underwhelming utility. Use the corm for what it’s meant (railguns) and use a heron or similar to complete scanning/explo tasks. 
---
If you’re insistent on getting all the utility from your corm I suggest carrying complete refits along with a mobile depot. It’s probably a significant cost to you but its a fantastic tool when traveling. When you deploy it in space it allows you to refit and also acts as a temporary loot locker. Just don’t forget to bookmark it!
---
Looking to the future, tactical destroyers (t3d’s) offer greatly enhanced utility and flexibility over t1 variants. They’re a significant commitment in skill points and isk for a newbie, but that’s always the price for true flexibility in this game.
---
What network are you in? Chances are it is blocked by your router/gateway?
---
Is it a private network? Do you have evil friends that could have blacklisted that domain inside your admin interface on your router?
---
Well, just some wild guesses...
---
That's a myth. Both mechanically (solar systems aren't connected, you effectively have two separate maps, to compare it to other games) and just in in-game movement. 1 lightyear is 63241,1 AU. Travelling one AU ingame is technically possible but would typically take something like 60 days.
---
I think it's safe to say nobody has been travelling from one system to the next for over 10.000 years in this game.
---
Whose hand?
---
This is a nice idea.  
---
I really like the official app, it's not a buggy crashfest like most of the alternatives, but it makes up for this by lacking in features.
---
One edge being a gate you know where
---
Isk war double won.
---
I wore going to post about this idea, but IRL happends.
---
 \&gt; Alright dude. The guy is talking about 20-30 bombers, if you drop 20-30  dreads on a super/titans it will die fast. Lets pretend that isnt the  case. 
---
We dont have to pretend, that isnt the case.
---
\&gt; Lets overall just pretend dreadbombs arent supers biggest concerns. Lets  go with your narrative instead. And just cause people drop more isnt  because its needed, its because more wanna kill them. 
---
Currently they are their biggest concern sans enemy supers, but they arent enough of a concern.  
---
&gt; Here you go, nice km without dreads even  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77936900/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77936900/). "Hard to kill with dreads" lul. 
---
Oh look we dont know how long it took to kill them plus its a ratting Hel and thus proves nothing.  Congratz on your one outlier.  So yeah they are still hard to kill with dreads (although my main concern is titans not supercarriers, when I say supers I mean all supercapitals.)
---
assfrig or cruiser should be able to handle it.
---
needs to tank about 200dps, avoid sites with sentries
---
So are trig invasion corps a thing? I’ve looked and have either found the shittiest corps or just nothing at all
---
I'm starting to think you're actually a part of WinterCo, because I'm not sure where all this salt is coming from.
---
have an overview tab with everything showing. including corpses and stuff like that.
---
Sorry but while command bursts add some nice paper speed on top they´re not usable in reality. Warping to the dram would have to be done within one second (from entry to exit) to give the server the chance to process the activation of the bursts within the next tick.
---
And the time it takes to activate a MJD the dram travels (i have to guess as i am too lazy to chuck the fit into pyfa) is 180km or more with level 5 in the mjd skill on the sleip alt.
---
After looking more and more at those numbers i finally chucked it into pyfa and get completely different numbers than you, like getting to more than 31km/s. Care to break down your math? Maybe forgot boosters too?
---
And 50mn is possible though unrealistic as its not cap stable.
---
The correct answer
---

Short answer is a T2 cruiser or higher. If you're going T1, go in a battlecruiser.
---
Long answer that explains the short answer in more detail: 
---
But first, it's dangerous to go alone. [Take this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#) Rykki's PvE guide has all the info about what you're up against.
---
Next, some numbers. The sleepers have an omni damage profile, so you will need to fit your ship with even resists. Also, according to the aforementioned guide, the most DPS you'll be taking in one wave is 303 (Wave 1 of Phase Catalyst Node) and the most neuts you'll be taking in one wave is -30 GJ/s (in Wave 3 of The Line). You'll need to fit your ship to accommodate both of those. Looking at ballpark figures, these tank and cap numbers are basically impossible to hit in anything smaller than a cruiser. Even some cruisers have trouble hitting those numbers. Additionally, the farthest sleeper orbits at 45km, so you'll need to project out to at least that far. Again, most frigates and destroyers just can't do that. Keep in mind also that the sleepers spawn farther away and gradually move toward you. The range of the cruiser sized sleepers is 84km, so they will be able to hit you before you can hit them.
---
In conclusion, all these different conditions are very difficult for ships in general to match. The drake/gila/t3c are very exceptional in what they do, so that's why they are popular.

That's a fucking great website.

He was sitting on s gate, so a kiter would automatically draw since the VNI could just jump. And there’s nothing that could win in scram range.
---
Role assignment, titles and permission are a fucking nightmare to set, and non existant for alliances.
---
A complete overhaul would be a change welcomed by absolutely everyone.
---
It's just conflict drivers now are ONLY citadel shoots. It's pretty sad.
---
If you're competently exploring in NPC Null during the blackout you're well-prepared for wormholes explo as well. You'll gain the boon of "static" (ever-present) wormholes to K-Space. Don't go chasing sleeper sites; please stick to the relics and the sites that you're used to (which can spawn in C1-C3 space as well as shattered C4s).
---
Just punch the system name into e.g. [http://anoik.is/](http://anoik.is/) (or use a tracker which'll give you the info instantly) and it'll tell you what the system effects are (if any) and where the static wormholes go. The gist is that C1-C-3 systems always have K-Space statics whereas C4-C6 always have J-Space statics, excepting all but three (one each) of [the shattered C4-C6 systems](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=c4,c5,c6&amp;staticdest=&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_all). C2s are especially nice because you're guaranteed a static to both K- and J-Space, which means that if you entered via the system's static you're at least guaranteed another hole to J-Space, which could well be another C1-C3 with another K-Space static).
---
As to getting around bubble camps in null: as others have said, just warp to the gate from a celestial that's not in the same planet cluster as any other gate and you should be good unless there are literally hundreds of decloaking items littered around the bubble's edge.
---
If you're commonly getting caught at specific gates, you can make a tactical bookmark there (tac or perch or whatever) for future use. When the gate's clear, just warp there and look at the gate's orientation in space compared to the other gates. Manually pilot your ship in a straight line perpendicular to the lines connecting the gates. Once you're at a warpable distance (which is 150km, tho going out to 200-250 is good practice) save a bookmark in space. Then in future, instead of warping directly to that gate, warp instead to the perch bookmark and then to the gate. That way you don't get pulled to the edge of the bubble and you can, if you must, go back the way you came.
---
Some things to notice when making perches: 
---
* only constellation to constellation and region to to region gates float out in the middle of nowhere (i.e. not near a celestial). these are the ones that benefit most from perches.
---
* try to make your perches out in dead space relative to the gate, i.e. not forming a straight line between the gate and any other celestials (you can make moons show up on the overview with Shift+Alt+X). this way, a gatecamper with more than her share of neurons (e.g. four or five) won't notice you on the perch and bounce to the intersecting celestial and back to the gate, dropping a return bookmark on the way.
---
* following from the above: perches that are straight up and straight down from a gate, while often the most perpendicular perches possible, are also the most obvious, so avoid them if you can (i.e. go off diagonally instead).
---
* if you have a bit of capital you can stick a disposable alpha character in one of the big K-Space alliances and buy their bookmark packs, which include gate perches for every gate in a given region (and often other handy things, like NPC station dock/undock bookarks and observation perches, dscan safes near isolated gates, etc). they're usually quite affordable.

This crappy tool really does not work either and has abysmal mobile support

No it is not.

Epic 9 day timer 500m conflict drivers 😭
---
do you mean MS excel or is google spreadsheets ok? because there is a guide for google spreadsheets: https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/using-esi-with-google-sheets
---
There is also a guide for MS Excel but I never made it work (mostly due to lack of motivation though) https://wiki.zansha.space/index.php/SSO_Authentication_in_Microsoft_Power_Query
---
Pretty much everyone (besides empire Builder btw blue em all retards) frowns upon endlessly batphoning but with every timer being projected by over a week it's inevitable you're going to be able to get everyone in on it whether you like it or not.
---
Bring back &lt;48 hour initial bash to final timer content drivers and I'd imagine you'd get a lot less of this, although maybe with jump bridges networks it's too late for even that.
---
bLuE tO aLl Of eVe
---
Loved it, very well done.
---
Snuff are pretty bad in anything sub-cap
---
Only for anomalies but that's it.  CCP completely killed off the faction spawn/true sec thing years ago by stealth
---
MS Excel.  I can pull in type ID ect I just need to figure out how to get that produce the jita info
---
a T1 combat frigate can run a good chunk of the sites found in C1 (mostly limited due heavy neuting or webbing in some of the anomalies and signature sites). it wont work with Destroyers because they are paper thin, are slow and have signature radius close to cruisers. i dont recommend Attack frigates (the ones bonused for tackling) because they are too fragile and a single connecting hit from the NPCs can break the ship.
---
\-must have a minimum orbit of 5km or more OR know how to pilot manually in order to evade bumping with structures inside the site
---
\-needs to be cap stable and know how to manage capacitor when being neuted
---
\-needs to be able to mantain repair modules indefinetly 
---
\-100 DPS is the minimum for doing the sites in a decent time frame (half an hour or so)
---
\-need to manage cargohold so you can carry the essentials and have enough space for ammunition and carrying the loot/salvage
---
the whole package of one of these with mobile depot + salvager + probe launcher (and charges) + analyzing equipment is roughly over 10 million or so and pays of with a single anomaly once cashed in. but you have to be very cautious both with other players and with the NPCs.  frigate wormholing requires a much more active playstyle compared to those running cruisers and above. 
---
if you feel like investing extra you could go for a Faction frigate later on. but i think T1 is more than enough for a start. and you can do it with with pretty much any race you want, just need to ensure your guns have enough tracking to apply damage while orbiting.
---
Also if API is still available to use then that would most likely be better as I have heard its much easier
---
It’s a stretch, but I’m willing to entertain it.
---
You could take a series of pictures and then stitch them together with third-party software. This won't really work in scenes where you have things moving around or animating quickly, though.
---
It saves you a few hours.
---
Corrected, thanks.

If you're finding bots, just exploit their behaviour to profit.

---
What's a "goodfite" thou? A ratting Myrm? A dominix? An Ishtar? Is what you are flying even fight able for one of those?
---
Google spreadsheet versions have a tendency to stop working after a certain number of "pulls". I've had it happen just whilst trying to correct an error since the system treats the corrected page like a new pull. Still working on getting excel to work myself. Used to have one years ago that was perfect but the way the API/ESI works was altered so it would no longer work even if I still had it. Good luck to us both Mate!
---
&gt;After looking more and more at those numbers i finally chucked it into pyfa and get completely different numbers than you, like getting to more than 31km/s. Care to break down your math? Maybe forgot boosters too?
---
I can't get Pyfa to work reliably on Linux, so I just worked it out by hand. I excluded boosters and some implants for simplicity's sake and also because it doesn't make a significant difference on the time it takes to go anywhere.       
---
       
---
&gt;And 50mn is possible though unrealistic as its not cap stable.
---
Yes, and the focus here is on maximum sustainable speed.
---
&gt;And the time it takes to activate a MJD the dram travels (i have to guess as i am too lazy to chuck the fit into pyfa) is 180km or more with level 5 in the mjd skill on the sleip alt.
---
I suppose you could use a pair of Sleipnirs or some such arrangement. The focus of my post is on what might be possible theoretically. How it's done practically is left as an exercise for the reader.
---
yeah the lore in game is shown real bad, and even the story based missions a pretty  shit.   
---
they could draw so many more people in if there missions where actually  done well, you'd probably end up with a lot more people around for just the lore and maybe slowly move into pvp.  
---
i want to see the empires true power, have the amarr singing there dick about. im sure they'd love to have massive parades showing off there iapentan titan's  and there. "likely massive"  support fleet's
---
I don't know the answer to that.
---
This holds for inter-system travel but not in-system travel, which is what is being asked about.
---
When you think of it, since Titans are basically giant piles of minerals. Aren't they really concentrated veldspar?
---
IIRC they used some glitch to get up to a very high speed, something involving getting to the centre of a star and abusing old propmod mechanics. Possibly just done on the test server, since there's a video out there taken on the test server of someone getting up to close to the speed of light with a MWD and an AB.       
---
I don't know the specifics, but I do know someone did manage to get to where a Jove system should be, but they obviously weren't in the system as it was on a separate node.
---
You've got a learning disability if you think CCP even knows those exist. I still get triggered by them trying to say they couldn't verify you could use the API to alert you when you're getting the succ.
---
Thank you very much!
---
“Guritas” I think? Thought it was gurista
---
As far as I know, all 360degree videos out there have all been created in 3rd party tools; not the EVE client itself.
---
There are some 360 video's floating on youtube already, some by CCP and Scott Manley for example.
---
Look for wormholes and don't go through the NS-LS gate system. Most wormhole chains will have an exit to empire space within a jump or two.
---
Imagine implementing all these stupid ass timers and giving a 5m structure(mobile depot) a longer reinforcement period than a 600m-1b unfueled structure.
---
Yeah that's another thing I have heard is that google sheets suck.  So id rather use excel.
---
I noticed this and I just dont get why CCP let's this happen...its pretty annoying as fuck tbh..
---
Most guides are written for stationary ships, played the least interactive way possible, performable under AFK conditions, and at utterly 100% success rate (IE not retreating).
---
If you're willing to actually play you need to worry about tanking 2 or 3 wrecking hits (there is a chance to hit for full damage),  keep your transversals up, avoid sites that have ewar/scrams on the trigger, and just respond to what the site does.
---
Also worth mentioning that you can test stuff on the test servers as well.  Should be able to be fine with most T1 cruisers, especially ones with missiles or drones since those systems give you the most freedom for choosing your transversal.
---
It takes a lot of wrecks to theorycraft new Minmatar hulls.
---
I would say yes, it is out of the question. I don't think the Caracal can get 250-300 ehp/s of tank. Also it's got that nasty EM resist hole, which would need to be filled.
---
And do you not see an issue with capital fleets dropping everywhere because there's no counter to them other than bringing even more capitals?
---
Making a specialized anti-cap ship would create a threat to them. Who knows, maybe you'll even need to start using subcap fleets again for support.
---
Oooh right. Didn't even notice. I guess my brain corrected it on its own
---
This should be at the bottom of any priority list tbh
---
It’s great for them to learn about loss.
---
Fuck that thing eats. Nice video.
---
What’s wrong with that?
---
Lore wise, the Empires only have dozens of Titans each. So unless their mega-Titans are able to tank a DD volley from a thousand different Titans, they wouldn’t stand a chance. 
---
Nullsec has experienced immense powercreep compared to the Empires, their strength was drawn up to be overpowering back when Titans were rare, at this point they have been left in the dust
---
I did it in a Confessor... But C1 isn't worth...
---
An interesting concept.
---
there iapetan's  have 8 dd's and after 150 km's long so they could probably tank hole fleet's off titans and they have been getting upgraded more and more since then.  
---
if the empires are weak then all the better reason for such a event off us attacking them, basically kicking the  sleeping giants and showing them they need to pull there fingers out.
---
It could work with a different ship - something even more specialized than a bomber to kill caps.
---
Right now, it's impossible to match capital fleets simply because caps are better at pretty much everything. Rorq tackled in belt? Drop a super. Small gang roaming your space? Drop a super. Larger gang roaming your space? Let's drop 2 supers, just in case. It becomes worse with bigger fleets.
---
The ability to threaten capitals properly would make people think of they should blindly drop supers like they're doing now. Hell, you might even need subcap support.
---
No need for rigs when you have an A-Type.
---
Great music, really added something to the experience! Especially that first song!

Don't use slavager. Salvage isn't worth it without MTU and rarely worth even with MTU.  
---
Just kill the commander, grab the items from its wreck and move on.
---
Cormorant could probably do the easier unrated complexes and 1-2/10 DED rated complexes.
---
* It is a bit slow so MWD may be a good idea if you have room for it.  
---
* Use the range you have. Stay far away from the rats and they won't hit you at all.  
---
* Don't use adaptive invuln. Fit kinetic resist (In Caldari space you fight Guristas who use kinetic). Or use tracking computer for better application if tank is enough even without extra resists.
---
Info on sites: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#Cosmic_signatures

Equally interesting is that three carriers were used to kill a corax. Like I mean the fact that somehow all 3 got on the killmail.
---
that A-Type was really helping him tank!
---
Check his other deaths, I'm pretty sure it's RMT.
---
Everyone always thinks of the relic/data sites when exploration is brought up. Unrated and DED rated combat sites are also exploration.

Can't help you with Excel, sheets can handle this no problem. Just make your pull request and then copy and paste the data so it doesn't keep pulling. You can get a ton of data in one day. I got all historicals for 30 items in one day without hitting the limit.
---
I use =markets_region_history(10000002, 40520) with GESI plugin in a google sheet. The first number is the region and the second number is the ID# of the item. I'm sure there's a hook for current price but I'm not sure what it is.
---
Agree with everything above. The income gained helps keep a lot of systems and groups active. Losing docking control due to citadels (in FW when a system flips faction control, the other side can't dock at npc stations), and after losing passive moon mining income, FW and low sec died in many ways. Even now only a few low sec groups have transitioned successfully into active mining. 
---
      Losing FW income would be absolutely crippling to FW and much of low sec. Even if it is being abused by people who have no interest in FW and/or low sec, there is no good alternative for income for the groups who are using FW income to finance their FW and low sec pvp activities.
---
         Some solutions might be to increase clone soldiers value (bigger bounties on them), only the clones in .2 and .1 systems are valuable (because of the tags they drop). There are many areas of low sec with few or no systems that have the .1 or .2 status. Maybe lowering the sec status of a bunch of low sec systems down to .1 or .2 would help in that regard (they could use the Triglavian lore as a reason for the pull back by empire factions). The mordus special agent spawns are great but VERY rare, thus not a viable source for reliable income. They could use an spawn rate increase. Both of these things would make belt ratting in low sec worth doing, thus creating a lot of content. 
---
Perhaps an increase for non FW missioning in low sec would be good. A new skill for low sec missioning that doesn't apply to FW or burner missions. Right now the extra risk to mission in low sec is unjustified. You might as well mission in high sec (super safe) or in null sec (much better income).    
---
        The belt ratting for clones/mordus requires at least a faction cruiser (which cant even do the mordus barghest spawns which are very rare anyway) and missioning is generally the job of at least a T1 battleships. Getting more of these in space would be good content. It would also help smaller groups find a solid starting point outside of hi-sec. 
---
       The issue for many small groups with aspirations in low is that in FW you can lose docking rights if you lose a system, a citadel can get around this, but if you can't deal with the massive cap fleets some groups can drop or call on to destroy a citadel, you will get evicted. For smaller and/or newer groups, eviction or moving too much can be death. The same issue exists for low sec mining, if you can't deal with cap drops, you can't really make it worth doing. 
---
So you end up with the same situation as Null sec, bend the knee or don't bother. Understandably, many newer groups have no interest in being pets, or being farmed for frags with no recourse. If the income justified the losses, that could change. 
---
   The root of all these problems is the same, lack of iteration. The effects of citadels on FW, the effects of no passive moon income, the unreliability of Mordus and clone income at low sec belts, the unjustified risk vs reward of non-FW missions have all been left untouched for a very long time. Only after these things are adjusted or some new sources of income added would disrupting FW mission income and FW farming be a good idea. 
---
TLDR: Low sec needs iteration in the form of better and more reliable income from existing avenues to justify the risk, or new sources of income, before FW income is disrupted.
---
First off, C1s have pretty garbage payout, i would highly recommend looking at C3s if you want to make money.
---
If you really want to do C1 sites then I'd say go with an AB fit T3D, it shouldn't need to have a super strong tank and a single cap battery should make neuts a non issue.
---
Yeah... but how did a single carrier not just volly him? That's what I'm getting at, he has no buffer at all. 
---
Awsome kill though, funny as shit.

ESI is an API just another than the API before ESI.

The problem is they take very long to run and you need to pilot manually (at least somewhat)

You'll be visible for several seconds between decloaking after jumping and recloaking.

Caracal will do just fine, you don't need 300 ehp/s tank because that's only one site you can skip, plus signature sites are very few and you don't have to do those either. I've done C1 with 130 ehp tank without problems.

That being said, I don't think C1-C2 are worth doing isk/h.

You should consider building an exploration interceptor. You lose your exploration specific bonuses but you are faster and completely bubble immune. The crow and stiletto get enough mid slots to do it.

I personally haven't dropped a titan or super in probably half a year. The others I know have probably only dropped their supers or titans for 50 man loki gangs or dreads. Outside of that it's subcaps.
---
Horde, TEST and Goons all defend the Perimeter Keepstar. So them getting rid of Azbels doesn't have anything to do with FRT. Even if they outnumber the defenders with FRT being there to shoot TEST / Goons they're directly interfering with Horde's strategic objective.
---
K stop showing off your own car
---
no u
---
And killed by three carriers
---
Yeah...
---
How long has he been afk for now?
---
Sorry not sorry
---
and you can argue that Horde being part of this deal is funding test and letting them SRP fleets like the one lost  [today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/coivr0/legacy_smoked_at_tenerifisdetorid_border/)
---
But that Azbel being destroyed helps TAPI ALLIANCE fund their war to evict CHINAMAN ALLIANCE so Horde being there is assisting TAPI ALLIANCE (enemy of CHINAMAN ALLIANCE) to evict CHINAMAN ALLIANCE therefore GOBBLINS is assisting the enemy of CHINAMAN ALLIANCE as TAPI ALLIANCE helps him pay for his house.
---
Well they had Horde with them on that, so it's not like they're not helping. And it's not like these fights totally drain the SRP wallets.
---
&gt;poco brawl
---
Is this 2012?
---
you mean just like test did for years?
---
I vote the top one
---
The second one isn’t actually wearing them...so the top one is my vote.
---
Fuck i guess lol
---
Didn't know Frat supported XIX or KWG or RR or WERMT or GLD4U or RA or PIBC.
---
If so he has to check https://esi.evetech.net/ui/#/Market/get_markets_region_id_orders
---
For example https://esi.evetech.net/latest/markets/10000002/orders/?datasource=tranquility&amp;order_type=sell&amp;page=1&amp;type_id=585
---
gives the first page of slasher sell orders in the region "The Forge". He then has to filter which of those are in Jita.
---
Yes they decay but when you still find one, you cannot kill it within a day. 
---
Which in a wormhole usually means your connection there has changed.
---
&gt;say something about pocos
---
&gt;shadow cartel appears
---
Why I'm not surprised ))
---
Shooting defenceless ratters and bombing excavs is content exclusive to the most elite players it seems. In case these people still haven't figured it out. People don't care about their their elite gate camping shit we want our null sec wars back. Everything is so dull there isn't even any political drama to read up on.
---
As long as you make sure to update on an unmetered connection, it should be fine. Eve sips data.
---
I'd be careful about doing anything major or risky though. Latency and packet loss on mobile data can be a killer.
---
(as a tip, make sure you don't have steam running. It ignore the metered connection setting)
---
https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/api/ may be of some interest.
---
"ankward choice" from gobbins lel
---
Absolutely fine. I was forced to play EVE via mobile connection for 1,5 months and surprisingly little data is exchanged during playing. Updates are going to be the issue and eat up your mobile connection. If you can cover the updates over random wifi connections you should be fine with 5 GB.
---
If you plan to do it with windows I highly recommend you to dig into every setting for internet possible and disable it's internet use. Windows and it's services ate a lot of the plan per month, better spend some time fine-tuning these setting.
---
Yes like I said they are helping frt's enemys.
---
Thanks for the answer. I can update at home, I just have a fairly long public commuting time so I thought I could play Eve there.
---
Most people don't care about that type of content though. They want null bloc on null bloc activity back. Even the political landscape is dead. Take a couple of cruisers out and even Brave and Horde will drop caps as well as a 100 man HAC fleet on you. It's a roll of the die. You can't reasonably expect that everybody must switch to small gang or leave the game. I've been out roaming. We get kills. That doesn't make it any less boring.
---
Thanks for the answer. Yeah, I can update at home. This would just be for my commuting. I'll look into those windows settings, thanks for pointing that out!
---
nice to see provibloc win ISK war and looting field :-) next time pls kill their super too ;-)
---
except for KWG and WW and XIX and Red
---
Pretty smart attempt from FRT, here, actually. If I were them, I'd want very much to destroy the TTT. It's directly funding their enemies, after all. Can they do it? Doubtful. Still, points for trying, and points for a good strategic goal.
---
Catching bots was fun in the first place? Is it actually fun or do you just orgasm over killmails.
---
they... take your ore without paying for it?
---
"When I scan a relic or data site, will it also become visible for other players ?"
---
No.
---
Check out w4rped intentions we are industrialists with a violent streak currently hanging out with TEST. You can keep what you mine and we have defence fleets to watch over you!
---
botting 2010 - 2017, nightmares, gilas, carriers, banned maybe every 6 months at most . . . usually running &lt;10, not usually for too long at once
---
botting 2019, ~50 alpha VNIs, banned every few months because they don't even try to hide
---
doesn't take an expert to see that we currently see a lot more botters get banned because alphas allow people to just not care
---
They do what with your ores now?
---
no
---
\&gt;loli in username
---
have fun getting raped in prison pedo
---
Fuck Panfam, Fuck Goons, Fuck Legacy. Seems like the only non cancer bloc is FRT at this point
---
Should have let his/her tyres down and left a note under the windscreen wiper with a stasis web icon drawn on it.
---
These are the questions we need answers to.
---
A fucking well fit Corvette could run a c1
---
What are the requirements to join?
---
Reprocess it into ships for the entire Corp to use
---
But they make ships for the entire Corp to use. I mined 15 mil worth and they paid me 10 mil
---
&gt; Losing FW income would be absolutely crippling to FW and much of low sec.
---
removing missions don't remove fw income, fw income is based on lp conversion, all it would do is make the lp coming from plexing(the thing that actually affects the wz) way more valuable
---
Imagine providing jumper cable boost or such to a car like that. ALL the logi jokes!
---
So you are newer, and delusional.
---
We've all been out roaming. Can easily kill 10bil+ in a few hours. If you take just a couple of bombers out it's one of the safest things you could did. Didn't people say something about making null sec more risky? Right, for thee but not for me. I'll tell you this I'd much rather get dunked in a fleet fight than kill more miners and morons. But killmails seems to be interchangeable with fun regardless of how you get them. And the only 'real content' that is allowed to exist is the kind that you can stroke your cock over and brag about how elite you over the internet. Because if you like fleets you're still just a krab and you aren't allowed to like doing that, right?
---
enemy finally gives a fight in EU TZ &gt; Provi reee's so hard they split their diapers
---
is the 10 mil you were paid the ship that you used for mining?
---
big balls, props
---
It included the venture I got
---
Its zkill, the ad software hes running seems to have changed... For the worse
---
i do clones in a polarized dramiel but agree that .3 and .4 tags could provide some more value
---
also would definitely love to see burner runners in lowsec
---
AOM even formed 170 guys. But on TEST side.
---
reset everyone
---
[https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1078555371](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1078555371/page/5/) the corp Walter is in  
---
get out of this corp ASAP! doesn't look like that have anything to teach you and sounds like they are ripping you off
---
I have one similar on my pickup.  I search for these on the highway but I've yet to see one.
---
Don't believe the down-boats fuck tidi fuck-fests.
---
didn't know dran assumed leadership of those alliances..guess he is the new mittani
---
AAR is literally in the video. "Fuck it, let's engage. Load Conflag."
---
Thanks for the advice, I will wait and try to get to the bottom of this, they are genuinely nice people to play with so I don’t want to leave with bad intentions. Thanks for your concern I will look into leaving.
---
Yeah I too like to fight over a cheap ass crappy citadel. 🙄
---
If people want a compromise then why not just remove Blackout then give cloaks the capacity to remove you from local on use. Oh right. We aren't allowed to do that. Switch to gate camping and kill krabs for fun or get out of the game right?
---
Careful, the winner of this is probably going to become the next Leviathan skin
---
Even better is it was mostly guardians broadcasting. Snuff primaries our logi in every fight we've been in in the last few weeks
---
Well, CCP now has it's next skin idea..
---
bro it's an ALLIANCE COALITION BLOC LEVEL ASSET it of course needs a 9 day timer
---
vOv blocs gonna bloc

Grr Snuf Hat Snuf

I'll always have that!   
---
Right?
---
How great is the dead blue mod market. Stocks have completely dried out on some and half are beyond being financially practical. It's almost as if turning the lights off had far reaching consequences beyond krab tears.
---
Yea no shit
---
lowsec is where it is at tbh
---
Is that Dana Rohrabacher?
---
Nah
---
I shall be more of an Amarr next time then
---
Minmatar don't wear pants
---
My head is going to explode. What a complicated relationship here!
---
Yeah and they folded into other test rental alliances.
---
All this talk of increasing the risk and all it's done is make it dangerous for those with sov holding responsibilities yet extremely safe for any krab farmer with a cloak. These people don't want increased risk for all. Just you. So they can be hand fed free killmails.
---
Garbage corps like this are killing the game.
---
and you can report a bot with proof and they will get kicked
---
Depends on where [CCP Peligro puts the dong.](https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1159466629484425217)
---
Ship type?
---
And please don’t war dec them. All of the members are nice people but I wasn’t informed that the moon I mined the ores would go to the Corp
---
VERTICAL SUPREMECY
---
Elo is Vily's dad's dog's food bowl
---
Cool mental gymnastics.    
---
How much does your gym membership costs?
---
Nail. Head. Risk for thee and not for me. As long as I keep getting free krab, no risk killmails then content must be booming.
---
sure sure i was probably a bit harsh. i mean if they have done things like help you skill plan, teach you game mechanics like how to Dscan, basic how-to on piloting engagement profile's for different ships/fits or just how to fly in a fleet etc etc then stay while you feel its beneficial and your having fun.   
---
but from what i can see (last real green steak on KB is from 2011) and what you have said sounds like your getting the short end of the stick.   
---
keep us updated
---
My name is based on an injoke with some mates because I abused BroodLords in Starcraft 2 and I'm also a weeb, so uh, swing and a miss champ.
---
ohh yeah sure I believe you there are no bots what so ever in feyth omist fake estoria or ps.
---
Yeah, all you have to do is add your permissions to GESI and then drop that into a cell and it will autofill.
---
This is why you always use adblock.
---
a good jackdaw is a dead jackdaw
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
Lol I taught myself all those things. Hell, I took the new guys interested in pvp in a nullsec roam where I taught them fleet mechanics. I am using skillplans from forum posts. Wow. I mean I should either try to be a higher up in the Corp or just leave. I will keep you updated o7
---
That they will.
---
It takes a very big IQ to understand Eve Politics.
---
This guy fucks (hi Geary)
---
&gt;you can report
---
I didn't deny it
---
If they are in test space just report it to dran or diplos, with proof. we don't support botting under our umbrella. We also don't repond to other entities.
---
Something something get good casual. Like me of course. Only kills defenceless ratters. Tries to fight them solo. Refuses. Comes back with ten more cloaky boys and calls you a krab for not fighting them. Yeah it's a bit of a one way street it seems. Everybody wants to act like they're elite but really it's all just a circle jerk of cyclical approval.
---
You have joined one of the many, many hisec corps founded to rip newbros like you off. Offering "free" ships is the line they use to keep you around until you wisen up and realize those ships are worth a fraction of what you give them.
---
&gt; They are very friendly people and they understand you can’t be on 24/7.
---
That describes like 99% of corps. 
---
&gt; They even have a Corp hangar where you can take mining and combat ships out
---
That also describes like 98% of corps. 
---
&gt; They take all of my ores away for reprocessing
---
You have found yourself in COMMUNIST SECURITY, COMRADE
---
REPORT TO COMMISSAR FOR IMMEDIATE COMMISARING FOR RELEASING THIS INFORMATION
---
Like seriously. Imagine *paying* to mine in HS!
---
so yes, everyone is telling you that C1 is not worth it, BUT it's a good training for when you move to higher class. If you die, you only lose a drake, so my advice is to stick with that until you are more confident / learn triggers / know how to handle those neuts (they neuts pretty hard).
---
I personnaly tried a bit of them in a gnosis, dont forget a MTU and salvage drones (or have a salvager nearby)
---
Yeah, communist scum!
---
Is too late, Comrade! Your reckless release of information has brought the fury of warmongering capitalists upon your friends! You've doomed them all!
---
Idk but when I think about it, the few omega members are at the top. Is this a Ponzi Scheme?
---
Top one looks like a condom
---
Chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature here dude.
---
Oh shit. Please don’t war dec me to hell I have assets that I’m trying to move out
---
Lost to 3 thannys no less
---
"dont worry we got defenders"  
---
surprisepikachu.jpg
---
As he said. To confirm the game uses jack all in data, just don't afk with jita local pouring in.
---
Well, you do have to pay for a mining permit. :P
---
I work in the north sea and my boats wifi is limited.
---
So i meter my connection.
---
The launcher uses about 150mb of data a day on average of 4 hours a day.
---
The client game used about 10mb of data a day during a 4 hour session.
---
Hope this helps.
---
11m36s if you're not getting the time tag for some reason
---
Well, you can just ROCK me to sleep tonight, mister!
---
With that 15m,  you could have easily fit 50 Ventures.
---
Too many ventures
---
Just like in real politics, all leaders are friends behind the curtains.
---
Swap 2 for any other T1 frig :P
---
Every single ship there costa more than a fuck*** raitaru. By bother? I'm missing something?
---
Assuming you're on a newer Excel version: power query. Also known as "get and transform" sometimes if you Google the terms. Works great but very resource hungry, freezes up my computer when I requery data
---
What you don't understand is the understanding of fun to these people is completely interchangeable with the number of killmails they can farm. Doesn't matter who. Doesn't matter how. Self proclamation and and cock stroking IS their idea of fun. So long as they can more easily self justify and strut around like you are an inferior person to they are because you don't see fleet fights to be exactly the same as shooting rats then they're just not interested in a conversation. If you mine you're a krab. If you rat you're a krab. If you're a krab flying with krabs and you shoot other krabs then you're just a blob of krabs. Krab = bad. Unless you're 'totally not blue to PL' and friends. Then you just get a free pass from criticism for doing exactly the same shit as everybody else.
---
We didn't need it, old fits and such
---
Oh cool
---
Yeah but then why would you pay CCP for a slightly less green Deimos.
---
It's all Chinese bots bruv
---
Damn, that is very helpful! When you say client, do you mean from updates and all of that? So the actual game, like, when you're in-game playing only used about 10mb of data a day? That's very low indeed.
---
Must be an interesting job working in the north sea in a boat!
---
Camp it!
---
That's why when the banner pops up asking to enable ads I go... nope.
---
Would rather throw a bit of ISK his way than deal with allowing a site to inject random third party shit it has no control over.
---
GJ provibloc, I guess seige was a little butt hurt after you batphoned them and then DD them all in one evening.
---
According to the windows usage statistics EVE clients needed 3.2 GB of data in the last 90 days (with plenty of multiboxing), launcher with TQ on and updates neeed 1.2 GB. All the communication tools I have for EVE (Discord and TS3) used 2.5 Gb.  
---
That being said I don't know how accurate these windows statistics are but in the time I relied on mobile connection I found them to be somewhat accurate comparing it to the data use statistics of my carrier.
---
Alright. Thank you so much for the insight, for real! :)
---
Pirat would say this.
---
He truly wants to be an Salvation Angel.
---
Always nice to find your car when you forget where you parked.
---
Its an oil production vessel.
---
Yeah the launcher downloads the updates to the resource file, the client uses next to nothing in terms of data it seems.
---
I had the same question last week, this is the first time ive tried running it at work, and its transformed my game experience with eve.
---
I do run it in potato mode and only one toon at a time just so i dont use all the bandwitdth and piss the lads off.
---
If you look at the ship info they have hull bonuses based on your racial ship skill level. So each level might add 10% dmg for example.                
---
                 
---
Lvl 5 is max and also allows access to the t2 ships
---
Alright, thank you so much for the information!
---
Set your laptop or pc up for metered connection and give yourself a limit each day. There is a big update next week so make sure you downlod it in an unlimited connection
---
imagine siding with FRT
---
Interceptors can actually do exploration pretty well. They are great for ghost sites, since you can warp off without dying if you fail.
---
Yeah I should do that. Thanks. All of you are being very helpful!
---
Apply to brand newbros in test, see you on grid

Why would it wear it on its head in the first picture?
---
I started out in wh but had trouble finding any doable sites. Almost all of them were sleepers so I moved to null.   
---
Thanks for the insight into perches. I've set quite a few up and have helped with drag or catch bubbles. Sounds like avoiding spammed bubbles on the gate or waiting at a perch until they despawn or go after someone else is a good way to go.
---
It's an Origin Raitaru.
---
These guys are pretty shell shocked by Elo, they literally pinged Immensea yesterday because Elo and 5 of us in muninns were sitting on a titan in Detorid standing fleet just in case anything got dropped. https://i.imgur.com/hbjPz7N.png
---
They are so desperate to stick it to big bad Elo, that they thought it would be a good idea to helicopterdick carriers right next door after DT. 
---
They did form titans as back up, probably thinking the only possible way we would kill the carriers is with a dread bomb. Clearly that plan didn't go so goodly for them.
---
I too am surprised we even killed him.
---
Indeed, some of us Titan pilots are absolutely pants on head retarded.
---
Join karamfleet no joke
---
It was super scary. Followed him for hours until we finally got our courage to drop him.
---
All hail corax man
---
The man syndicate deserves.
---
I'm skilling towards this... Losing a few cans for to missing the bonus is worth not losing the whole haul. Can a crow or stilleto be fit to get the same align time and warp stability I have on my astero?
---
Can confirm, he was disturbing our krabbing vibe
---
It has a very similar warping animation too...
---
Welcome to Eve
---
Getting it to 5 is basically your first major milestone as a new player, it gives you access to t2 frigs, but as the other guys says it also boosts whatever bonuses the ship has for every level
---
I refuse to play the .01 ISK game with dock jockeys. I'll drop off a load of whatever, in a system where it's likely to be needed (never Jita,) and price it low enough that if I predicted the market right it'll sell out before any of them realize they just missed a bunch of sales. If I predicted wrong, the item will sit there at the original price until I get around to swinging by to relocate the goods to a better system. I'd rather build a battlecruiser in a Venture than battle over market prices.
---
Scram and web his ship
---
1 ISK is actually nothing even for normal people. I'm pretty sure that 200k ISK is a decent amount of money saved for non - capsuleers.

So TEST is/was allied with the former DRF alliances/successor alliances/Red Alliance for the most part. Probably some overlap with a couple of others on there since TEST consumed the **Soviet-Union** alliance into a the [S0viet Uni0n](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/S0viet_Uni0n) corp after taking their territory with Soviet-Union basically being later replacements of  [RED.OverLord](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/RED.OverLord/corporations) who themselves had Inver Brass 2% and ROL Citizens 3% as renters and probably shared Stainless. 2% with various Stain alliances. This doesn't count  [The Army of Mango Alliance](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/The_Army_of_Mango_Alliance) in Omist as we don't have any statistics on their botting yet. 
---
So for Legacy that is 48% disregarding any of the former AAA botting alliances like AAA Citizens that have stayed in Catch/elsewhere and disregarding Mango.
---
Including the former **Soviet-Union** and their ex-renters again disregarding any former AAA renters and Mango Legacy can claim to have have been party to 55% of historical users banned for botting. It is probably a little more if you include some ex-AAA and Mango etc.
---
May Gob be with you.

Protecting their share of [15-30b/day](https://www.adam4eve.eu/station_income_history.php?stationID=1028858195912) makes allegiances somewhat meaningless.

---
None I'm pretty sure. Join the in game recruitment channel called w4rp recruit.
---
Sorry about that.  But basically, currently I have a typeID list that I can pull so I could put the name of something and it will pull up the type id number.  I was under the impression that I then use that number and plug it in somehow to something(part I am confused about) and it will pull the data for buy/sell etc from a website to keep it updated real-time.
---
I will do once I move out my assets. :) I will be focusing on mining there to get my wealth up
---
We have jump freighter service set up that run weekly. I know that in my Corp we have mining barges set up for people to borrow (again you keep what you mine) and we have Corp buy back so you don't even have to take it to market.

That sounds amazing

Canadian tuxedo skins when, CCP?
---
Every ship has specific bonuses;
---
t1 frigs get a specific bonus depending on the type of frig.
---
\&gt; A Bantam gets remote shield repairer bonuses, as it is supposed to be a logistics frigate, while the Griffin gets ECM bonuses, and the Merlin gets hybrid, more specifically, railgun turret bonuses (it could be flown with blaster too, though).
---
t2 frigs have a double bonus, since you'll need frig 5 to e.g. fly an assault frig, you can count the basic frigate skill as a natural bonus. On top of that they get bonuses for the Assault Frigates skill.
---
\&gt; When you train for one Assault Frig, it's usually a few small leaps towards the others, since the fundamental skill requirements of t2 frigs are all the same depending on their field of application, a Caldari Assault Frigate has the same skill requirements as a Gallente Assault Frigate. So basically all you need to do, once you have your first Assault Frigate, is train frig 5 of a specific faction to gain access to the t2 frigs you want.
---
faction frigs usually require a combination of two \[faction\] skills and get bonuses for both skills, so it's possible to have "uneven" bonuses. Exception in this regard is the Pacifier frigate which basically is a t2 faction frig, which not only requires Covert Ops, but also the other frig skills at least at 1.
---
\&gt; The widest variety of faction access is given by the Gallente frigate skill, as it is a necessary skill for 5 out of all 7 faction frigs.
---
1. Gallente / Minmatar : Dramiel, Daredevil
---
2. Gallente / Caldari : Worm, Garmur
---
3. Gallente / Amarr : Astero
---
4. Minmatar / Amarr : Cruor
---
5. Caldari / Amarr: Succubus
---

Brand new bros pretty solid entry to null if you're looking for test. Karmafleet really solid if looking to join goons. Anyone in brave I think works. Pandemic horde isnt a bad option as well. Think they're over in kalv expanse now these days

I was one of the guys who were lucky enough to dock up my dread after that bloody fight, and I must give a hearty "gf" to everyone involved.  Nice to have a big brawl that coincides with baby nap time.  Appreciate the timing and the pew pew.

That's what I'm asking for, is there a website with good fits

Tell me which Corp to join with no requirements and I will apply as soon as I get back from my fishing trip :)

Where does one get these?
---
Actually you can get power query on old versions too. It existed way before Microsoft included it bundled with Excel on current versions.
---
well the website [google.com](https://google.com) gave me useful results. But sisi is your friend. Learn to use it to experiment with every mechanic you're interested in.
---
Check out the Abyssal Lurkers in-game channel. There are a bunch of fits in the MotD.
---
The MotD will also point you to [EvE Workbench](https://www.eveworkbench.com/u/fonsui), where there a whole bunch of fits by Fonsui, who is apparently pretty-okay at Abyssals.

I got a bunch on eBay but never used them. Threw them out a few weeks ago with my Eve books that I had collected.
---
How so exactly?
