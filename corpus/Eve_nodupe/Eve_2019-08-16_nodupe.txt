How to not get re-elected, in one reddit post. Remind me next CSM cycle.
---
Nope i would like what ever ccp has been smoking of late
---
great video .... but eve has actually seen deflation, not inflation.  Check the CPI of the MER.  
---
bots have increased the money supply, but bots (and other mechanisms) have also greatly increased the raw materials.
---
You should be more in favor or removing voting rights form skill farms so we don't have to read this load of crap ever few days . Do something useful CSM ...
---
Yes, but I'm under the impression he thinks it's because people don't care about politics when buying and selling goods when it's really because they neither have control of who the buyer is and because people use Neutral alts for market purposes so you wouldn't even know if a Goon is buying your stuff.
---
The actual mechanics are simple. Part of what makes it so great is that you get such a complex set of interactions out of two rules.
---
* If the tower is above 50% shields, the strontium in the bay can be added or removed. Below that it cannot.
---
* When the tower takes armor damage, it goes into reinforced mode and becomes invulnerable for a duration determined by the amount of strontium in it.
---
Same

If null suffers, hi sec suffers is gonna become a mentality soon I swear
---
&gt; Really, I feel like at the absolute minimum, CCP should fix bumping before the nerf cynos this hard
---
If they made it so when you jumped to a cyno you ended up randomly X km off it, where X is based on your ship mass, they'd fix that *and* remove the ability to drop a brawling blob at 0. Win-win.
---
You can add the invaded systems to your avoidance list temporarily, and simply fly around them.

O that sucks

And yet you did not recognise the satyre in my post...

Even if people could control who they are selling to, they will be people that still sell to anyone since they just want money

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

You underestimate how much the orca bots generate in high sec
---
The general consensus on those changes its pretty clear. Killing frigates with capitals/supercaps/titans is generally frowned upon unless skillful smartbomb plays are made.
---
Fighters, fbs, haws are generally overpowered. I watch them get abused daily to my benefit.
---
&gt; light cyno, wait for help
---
Yep, because having dozens of people with caps on standby isn't a huge cost, literally hundreds of years of training time, and people playing a game together.
---
We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.
---
Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.
---
Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just make little strokes like that.
---
Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Those great big fluffy clouds. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. You need the dark in order to show the light.
---
A fan brush can be your best friend. And right there you got an almighty cloud. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.
---
I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. You can do it. Working it up and down, back and forth. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.

&gt; **Gallente Industrial bonuses (per skill level):**

---
When you're sitting in the ship, your skills apply and the capacity increases.
---
When you aren't sitting in the ship, it goes back to defaults.
---
 ***"It will be a new meta where people will need to bring recons for capital movement, and will have small windows to jump on cynoes. It's nothing big alliances can't adapt though."***
---
It's hard enough to get a cyno up on a HIC or max tanked T3 in a big fight, how do you think it's going to go on a 40-45k EHP recon? How many recons are you going to need to bring to every fleet as dedicated cyno ships instead of DPS/logi/Support etc? Even if you lock it up and start repping it before it lights it will probably still get alpha-ed.
---
As for moving capitals, its fine if you are only moving capitals as a big group. What if you are moving capitals around as a small group or by yourself through LS or NPC null? You're going to loose a t2 cruiser to a bunch of tornadoes at 100k off, every time you want to move that new carrier you just bought in LS to your staging system two jumps away.
---
***" There are still very viable options. Pay 30b/70b to grow your cyno network to jita, or just get one alt and gate it. You might lose 1/4 of every covert cyno ship you light, which is an additional 25% fuel cost per jump. Again, no big deal. It even gives lowsec bros things to kill, and adds up to the overall content available in the game. Free cynoes weren't a good thing."***
---
Why aren't free cynos a good thing? Who wants to bet the new sport will be camping stations in Olletiers/Crie/Ignoiton etc waiting for a free kill. 
---
I'm not against making it more expensive or dangerous to use capitals but this particular change is going to kill off a lot of content for anyone who's main play-style isn't just hunting ratters in null sec.
---
Cynos were a way of taking people by surprise and jump-starting a fight rather than having two subcap fleets (or just two subcaps), get within two jumps of each other before the weaker side decides to retreat without a fight because they know how to add and subtract. Lighting a sneaky cyno might not be the only way to get a fight in that scenario, but it's one method that's not available anymore. As soon as anyone sees a Recon in system you can guarantee what it's there for.  
---
The days of seeing a big brawl going down and quickly moving a frigate cyno over to get your group involved are pretty much gone as well. Recons don't go so fast and not everyone has an alt that can quickly get into one.
---
If this change is all about nerfing the capital umbrellas of large null-sec groups, IMO goons/test/panfam etc, are going to be the least affected population in the game. It makes content generation and capital warfare much harder for the smaller groups in low-sec and NPC null.
---
looks like shit!   
---
excellent!
---
Even through I have a full fit to max out capacity?
---
Era of choas, fuck the meta buddy
---
CCP Should probably Ban olmeca He bought some recons before this change was announced so he definitely  had those CSM leaks.
---
Be the change you want to see.  Just about the only advantage eve has over any other game is the ability to make long term plans.  So start working towards that goal and with a few years of effort you might be in a position to challenge the people who've spent a decade building their empire.
---
your skills don't apply to a ship unless you are sitting in it, so the mods you attach will have an effect, but your skills won't.
---
he even ninja edited that disclaimer in there to hide the fact he ALREADY BROKE NDA
---
thanks mate

Less then the tousands or rorquals in delve a 10% drop in mineral supply will still have massive effects on prices
---
Hes in BB, he doesn't know how to PvP
---
Oh good, more BBTB2 salt. Top quality.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m trying to point out. It’s dropping from the full fit capacity to the stock capacity with no fit.
---
If you have been posting about so called "stupid" decisions, why keep enduring them. Just admit that you are a miserable hobo and move on to your next game. EZ.  
---
Clearly you are triggered enough to tidy up your every comment. It is so fun to see you try so hard and fail. Amazing effort though.  
---
Keep the salt coming. Enjoying it very much :D REEEEEEEEEE more pls.
---
Why should the game cater to your playstyle? You having to invest more time to get the properly skilled toon was something you could have done long ago, but no you went for the bare-bones option and are now paying the price. The cyno has to be omega anyway so what is 3 months of train on it before going back to training something else on another toon. In short: you are not paying any more plex/money to maintain your setup, it will just require more skilled toons which you could have trained already but neglected to.
---
I've ratted in my Orca before starting a mining op
---
Maybe, maybe not. Depends on reps available to the brick tanked cyno ship. It only needs to last long enough.
---
Regardless it's a cyno tax. Minus srp and insurance
---
Banned in Domain
---
Bought at 200-300m each 4m after change was announced
---
Sold a couple hours later same night when they were at 500-550m
---
Very happy with my choice right now
---
They changed this awhile back. Modules so not apply unless you are sitting in it.
---
It's that simple. Stock until you board the ship no matter what.
---
don't waste our time with posts like these.
---
There's a reason why c2/n/5s are the most popular wh type. :)
---
This is way beyond stupid, if there wasn't a video I wouldn't even believe it.
---
That’s the answer I was looking for. Thank you. I already figured that skills wouldn’t apply I was just trying to figure out if modules applied or not.
---
&gt;If you have been posting about so called "stupid" decisions, why keep enduring them. Just admit that you are a miserable hobo and move on to your next game. EZ.
---
Cause the whole game isn't a few stupid decisions? I enjoy many parts of it. I'll still complain about bad ideas. And the second part of your comment makes no sense. 
---
&gt;Clearly you are triggered enough to tidy up your every comment. It is so fun to see you try so hard and fail. Amazing effort though.

Try and fail at what exactly? You're amusing me. That's why I'm responding.

Educating the uneducated is literally why I go on Reddit. You are providing me with content. Nice try though. Also this really isn't reeeing.
---
This got tested extensively with plated nestors and supers on SiSi showing the same effect when ejected into space.  
---
Brick tank that refit ship, not so much.
---
Disputing your claim that groups see easily removed, citadels + fozzie sov make that no longer possible, test who bring twice the numbers of frat (they even outnumber frat in China TZ) have barely made a dent
---
something to gain? well if you already have everything just fight cause its fun to pew with internet spaceships, weird to think that we need to be told when to fight
---
We don't make mistakes, we have happy accidents.
---
Because money
---
Terrifying
---
I have all my toons omega, however I don't multi-character train all characters on each account. That is where my cyno alts are on. So you're telling me I should have covert cyno and recons for 10 characters when it was never needed?
---
Bro 90% of your posts consist of complaints about highsec ganking implying you live in highsec, why are you even here?
---
&gt;Your whole argument hinges on that bit, "buddy".
---
&gt;"Boohoohoo I can't possibly kill bomber fleets unless I can freely jump my bosons"
---
Imagine being this retarded.
---
I'd say that perhaps you should go back and read it again, as the discussion was specifically **bridging** and you cut out the part that also specifically details that I was referencing the the **movements** of bomber fleets, but I'm afraid that wouldn't do any good.
---
Frankly, it might just be better if you conserved your limited resources to ensure that your autonomic processes continue unhindered.
---
I wish you the best of luck, and *please* let me know if I need to type slower for you next time.

Reminder: Anything good for PVE downvote and discredit, anything good for PVP upvote and promote. Earn you reddit cred today.
---
Lol, I don't even live in high sec. That was a post about a top rated Steam review highlighting the concerns about how suicide ganking is repelling new players, but the salt I obtained from post was good. Still, it is nothing compared to these posts. It is like Christmas morning. I am flattered that you are triggered enough to check my entire post history though.
---
It looks like Mar5hy told Bombers Bar to deploy to r/eve.
---
People don't seem to remember that fighting krab defence fleet isn't the only occasion you get to see them.
---
What about the argument for "dont fucking use caps for small ops"?
---
The game is shit right now and lossing alot  of players, dont waste your time in this game, beter stay on wow or warframe
---
all your posts are you crying about highsec ganking, your baseless opinion has been exposed - time for you to sit the bench now
---
Yes, please. Allow me to have enough jump range that I can cover even more system. Allow us to power project even further.
---
Fuck they dont?! So ive been puckered hard every time i jump for the past 13 years for NOFUCKINGREASON? Fml.

It’s the “nullsec has all the manpower, isk, and planning blah blah blah” narrative I don’t like. I mean look, I’m not even complaining about being blobbed. I’d MUCH rather get blobbed by 150 man cormorant fleet or more frequently some random kitchen sink shenanigans with 200 brave dudes chasing our 15-20 man T1 brawl fleet around. It’s the fact that inevitably you guys will drop about 5-15 supers I’d say, regardless of the situation. There are no numbers, there is no manpower, there is no actual planning. To get those massive blob fleets we’d have to go into a staging system and shit up their local until the line members were allowed to undock and chase us. 
---
You just can’t get out-dropped, so the supers are never at risk to begin with. Yes I know there are dread bombs, and I’m no cap intel guru but I’m fairly sure your FCs roughly know the deployment range of all the threatening dread bombs per timezone. 
---
I honestly just want fights. We’ve gone on multiple roams before and asked locals across multiple regions to undock something cheap and come fight our 5 man assault frig gang. We’d have No ewar, no logi. We were repeatedly accused of flying (T2 fit) bling ships and blobbing them with it, I’m not kidding. It’s pathetic. We would frequently be outnumbered in local system alone 2 or 3 to 1, forget the rest of the constellation. And they’d still insist we had too strong of a fleet. It’s just risk averse attitude to the extreme and it boggles my mind.
---
And he does it again! I don't know how but he keeps producing more salt. He is breaking laws of physics here and creating matter from sad thoughts. Unbelievable!

I never claimed that at all, I was proving that space wasn't safe b/c x and y reasons
---
JFs dying are so rare I actually know a guy who specializes in killing them by his character name PornMaker
---
Of course they are as i explained the reason. If you think this ever affects your bitching in anyway then i am sorry but i will keep obtaining your top quality salt as long as you keep producing them.
---
Defender aren't used as often as they should for a reason. They are shit in tidi, they are often shit in bigger fights that doesn't even cause tidi. They are very buggy in most situation. Unless CCP fixes them to the point where they can be used reliably, they are going to be shit.
---
That corp fed a shitload of supers earlier too
---
Ok bye.
---
Am I the only person that loves these cynical changes?
---
You've very clearly only read about wormholes.
---
Next patch: HICs get jump drives.
---
ok highsecboi
---
I just started at the beginning of this year, after wanting to play this game for a decade. 
---
Now eve is pretty much the only game I touch anymore.
---
I really love the learning experience as a whole. There is always something to learn and do, so if you get bored of one particular grind you can take up other activities.
---
I have also found the people I meet in-game to be extremely friendly and helpful.
---
I would suggest joining a hisec corp with an active chat channel or discord and learn the ropes. And then eventually branch out and find your adventures.
---
Try to avoid some of the larger corps at first. Many of them shove newbros into mining, which can eventually get kind of boring for a new player.
---
Garth, you always had an over-inflated sense of self-importance. We call it being pretentious.
---
CCP loves to break stuff/ make dumb changes/propose band aid solution to complex problems. Then after they've done that, they are going let it be for few years. Maybe less if EVE dies first.
---
Activate your windows.
---
Ehhh ohh
---
&gt;And he does it again! I don't know how but he keeps producing more salt. He is breaking laws of physics here and creating matter from sad thoughts. Unbelievable!
---
If you think this is salt I'll add you in game and double all your ISK for **free**. I'm also quitting eve and I'll sell you the 9bil contents of my hangar for *just* 900mil. 
---
&gt;I feel sorry for you. Have to play a game you think stupid but can't move on. 
---
What part of my comment did you not understand. I said a couple of stupid choices, not the game is stupid. I play plenty of other things. Apex is fun, but I think the shit respawn tried to pull with the iron crown event is stupid. I've posted about that too.
---
You can like something, while disagreeing with a developer decision. 
---
&gt;You have no friends don't you? Oh god, eve is probably the only important thing in your life. Sad.
---
Please stop projecting, you're embarrassing yourself.
---
It's as simple as this:
---
CCP are trying to move everyone over to the f2p/microtransaction model so they can get rid of the legacy/sub model.
---
It's what Pearl Abyss wants.
---
What you are suggesting goes against this, it won't happen. Sorry. Injectors are the big money maker in the microtransaction model.
---
In a shocking twist of events, Reddit learns that a shortlived spike in demand is gonna get filled &amp; overcompensated by people jumping in to produce the ships.

AFTER 16 Years EVE - CCP I STILL LOVE YOU ♥

Before you go, can I have your stuff?

Just a little touch?
---
12 year old arm chair dev el0 knows all lol.
---
&gt;Part of the problem is huge ISK/mineral faucets in null. Increased risk will inevitably send some people elsewhere and cause reduced farm. But that might already be intended. 
---
Genuine question, what are your thoughts on players who are reliant on nullsec ratting to fund their PvP activites?
---
CSMeme
---
It is more fun, I'm wary of the mining barges. I've been sticking to knocking down cruisers and destroyers.
---
You should definitely move into a WH!
---
Think of how easy it is.
---
You are literally the worst CSM member,  you were voted in to represent the Eve population, not your own personal agenda.
---
Oh look, the goon found a thesaurus.
---
BOMBERS BAR FOREVER!!!!
---
They can:
---
- Be more creative for moneymaking (exploration, abyss, 
---
- Be more cautious (active alts watching gates, recon alts to light cyno for help, rat in a dead end system with bubbled gates, etc)
---
- Admit a bit more risk for their anomaly farming activities (be fine with losing something like 15% of your income instead of much lower, or use cheap ships for ratting).
---
- Maintain a moneymaking alt somewhere else than null.
---
I'm salty enough all on my own
---
Having stuff on standby doesn't automatically entitle you to a space safer than hisec.
---
I campaigned with my agenda, and turned out it is strongly supported, so it's not personal.
---
This is beautiful
---
Having a hard time with the invasion stuff. I've gotten wrecked by them more than a few times, and I fly solo. Lots of isk lost and I'm not making it back mining. 😕
---
Try Windowed mode.
---
obligatory character bazaar post.  Yeah yeah, I get its different, but the people buying injectors will literally just buy chars off bazaar for isk.
---
why would new players have any feedback regarding the cyno changes?
---
Agreed and if people dont buy injectors people won't buy extractors and if people dont buy extractors people wont buy nearly as much plex for extractors. So ccp will take a bit of profit loss.
---
And whenever a small group pops up, if it doesn't submit to the nap (like when French Connexion were living near legacy and frat) they get chewed up and spat out, which is sad because French Connexion gave fantastic fights
---
It would work but I despise windowed mode, I’d rather have fixed window not be bugged or shit. Failing that though, I guess...
---
Saves forever - that folder has every convo or log you've ever been in, including local, corp &amp; alliance chats. (If you leave alts idling in 4-4 all day this might be where your spare gigabyte of space is going.) 
---
Also link the tristan km, this sounds good
---
You seem to not understand goons. Lots of goons just hang out because we like to be together, we like big fleets and a plethora of people to hang out with. We wont break up because of resources, we will just take more space if we need it. We control 4+regions already, I don't know if we would ever need more.
---
Gotta get in and out before all the plebs hop aboard.
---
Are you dumb enough to believe that is actually true?
---
&gt; How many recons are you going to need to bring to every fleet as dedicated cyno ships instead of DPS/logi/Support etc?
---
People always argued that a more diverse selection of ships should be needed for null fights, rather than all capitals. Now CCP is partially making that happen. I'm pretty sure large capital forces can afford a couple of recons for each time they want to escalate a fight.
---
&gt; What if you are moving capitals around as a small group or by yourself through LS or NPC null? 
---
I personally lose something like 50 Naglfars in some months. Shuffle them quite often from NPC null system to another. I am OK with losing a couple of recons every time I move stuff. 
---
&gt; Who wants to bet the new sport will be camping stations in Olletiers/Crie/Ignoiton etc waiting for a free kill.
---
Its a good thing if it keeps some people subbed/doing it/playing Eve. At the mere cost of 25% more cost for JF movements of goods.
---
&gt; The days of seeing a big brawl going down and quickly moving a frigate cyno over to get your group involved are pretty much gone as well
---
Good. Capitals were ruining those brawls.
---
&gt;  Lighting a sneaky cyno might not be the only way to get a fight in that scenario, but it's one method that's not available anymore. 
---
You can light cynoes mate. You just have a smaller window to jump. Easily adaptable.
---
&gt; IMO goons/test and panfam etc, are going to be the least affected population in the game. 
---
I as a person specializing on making umbrella space riskier, disagree.
---
adapt or die

Slyce vs Dead Orbit
---
I wasn't sure at the time the Proc was around, Slyce brought in remote reps but it doesn't seem that was enough.
---
Text is in the wrong places
---
Train one into a super, and another into a Titan, super on grid, Titan on standby
---
Titan gatecamps, obvio.
---
Not everyone stays poor forever. :P I got a cap within my first year.
---
Not totally.
---
My gameplay isn't affected by the change at all, but I still think it might be TOO much.
---
Not so much so that I'm going to freak out, just presenting possible adjustments.
---
That's the fun of Reddit, where we can discuss these things.
---
I know for a 100% fact there are shit tons of players that love PVE; so eat shit downvoters! :p
---
So 120m isn't enough of a cost but 300m is?
---
I'm curious what cost would be enough, and couldn't we just increase the material costs of the cyno module to solve that as opposed to changing the ships they attach to?
---
At least hes not a goon so he got that going for him
---
Genuine question: do you think before umbrellas became a thing (which wasn't that long ago tbh) noone was ratting in null?
---
These two replies just made my day. It has been a shitty day, so it didn’t take much. This can explain this sub nearly 100%.

Lmao imagine being this big of a salty pussy over eve
---
Amusingly. my longass response is already on jin-taan's video. bastard makes me wanna write an essay everytime :) must be that winning smile.
---
I agree it's a massive blow to JFers. Cyno was too easy but they have gone too far. It wasnt enough removing cyno from supers, carriers, and other ships, they had to change it so dramatically.  3 months to train every cyno alt to use covert cynos.  No compromise, nothing. Oh and you have to burn at least 30-40 mill per jump for your suicide cyno prospect or whatever. 
---
There should be an option where the change can be adopted to in a timely manner. Nope! Only option is to spam injectors because theres like 3 characters per account to train 3 months each on 2-3 accounts and only 1 month to do it in.
---
I agree completely it's a cash grab. 
---
I'm also curious who knew about this ahead of time because take a look at the 60day prices of force recon ships. Been increasing sharply the past 2 weeks. Interesting.
---
imagine white knighting Olmeca
---
Better than some ww2 propaganda with copy pasted eve faces
---
Too bad cyno V is the long train, frig is a week tops
---
no one makes isk fast "station trading", I'm calling your bullshit bro sorry
---
Do you actually use a JF? Have you gone to zkillboard to have a look at how many are lost? https://zkillboard.com/group/902/
---
On average 1/2 a day. These things cost 9/10B. Don't forget the cost of collateral. A JF pilot usually will take low m3 contracts with higher collateral. It more cost effective. We already run a huge risk. 
---
Furthermore, the cyno update has already changed it so now our cynos are worth something. Those cyno alts. Cost time or isk to prepare. (That now been increased too because of the patch and significantly)  Looking at 3-7 cyno alts.
---
Then fuel. With the blackout, mining has taken a decline. With cyno changes this will have a further  decline. It costs upwards of 200M per run depending on fitting.
---
A good fitting by the way costs another few billion with jump econimisers and ore cargo expanders.
---
Then the training time for the JF pilot. Another few months.
---
Finally, "uncatchable" when a JF jumps onto a structure it can't tether and if it scrammed it can't dock or jump out. So it a dead JF. 
---
So covert cyno. You can't see the cyno being lit. Well sir be rest assured whale hunters know where to look (on the astrahaus). But what about deep safes, with good scanning skills you'll get the location result instantly, that is a dead JF. As you can see the reality is the JF pilot life is one that runs it risks for actually not that great payout of a payout. Usually enough to cover fuel costs. 
---
Also goons are such an industrial power house, that if they cut ties with the rest of eve we'd feel the burn a lot worse. Have a look at the prices of compressed ore while tribute was being glassed over.

That's CSM Olmeca Gold to you, boy

25 cloaked titans u poor or something?
---
Hardly, because you don't have to pay any cash to inject these skills.
---
TIL having a dozen guys playing another game alt-tab back into EVE to crush some roamers is a “huge cost”.
---
the text colors match too closely with background elements, but I like the colors. also idk anything about anything. maybe like a double-outline, outlining the text once with white and then a black outline around that? Idk
---
it looks really cool though! good job son
---
Don't need to suicide your cyno ship since it's a covert cyno and people would.have to prob you down, which if you cyno into a safe many people just won't do.
---
Oh lots of people love them, but the ones that don’t like them are being super vocal.
---
Make scrap metal the nanite repair paste for minmatarr ships!
---
I had to do a bunch of missions in there, so i spent a couple stressful hours avoiding ayys. At one point i got caught and webbed right outside the station and barely made it in with half structure left
---
New players are very limited in the way they can do their logistics if they're wanting to be self sufficient.
---
I care more about the thousands that quit since I started back in 2004. Let's get them back playing
---
I'm not talking about proliferation. I'm talking about escalation. Once a fax with a cyno hits the grid, content ends unless you're dread-bombing. It's content-denial gameplay.
---
CCP is only "cash grabbing" if you need injectors , Plex and 83 alts to play this game. For me ? They getting the same 14.95 they have been getting since forever
---
I started all bright eyed and bushy tailed. I was told to get to carrier to make isk for pvp. I spent all my training time to do so for the last year including a couple of minor detours for doctrine subcaps. All that time and effort is not worth much.
---
Now it seems a recon ship alt is required and the carrier I do have (properly tanked) is a prime blops target. The money I do make goes to increasingly expensive doctrine subcaps and soon the aforementioned 500m a pop cyno ships.
---
No whining or crying involved, just the reality of my particular sitation, as a casual player. I fight through a disability to achieve what most look down on as a F1 monkey and that's fine. I feel that triumph none the less. I enjoy the game none the less. If CCP thinks null is too much for me, and want to keep putting up barriers to say "go to highsec cripple", well fuck em.
---
can you honestly tell me what is pretentious about it being public knowledge that I've played the game for 13 years and that in the face of that the statement of "if you actually knew anything about eve" being laughable?
---
i dont care what you do, if anybody comes up and says "if you only knew anything about X", and you had been doing X for 13 years, that person who said that to you is a fucking idiot.
---
I agree. Don't do that. Leave it to the few of ours.
---
This just proves that people had inside information. Should be bannable just as its illegal in real life.
---
Not new / started playing after a year, but if I remember correctly CCP claimed that it's supposed to bring a challenge to more veteran players. I wonder who they see as veterans in this game. Personally I have a single cap alt, working on the 2nd one very slowly right now. I have far from a lot of ISK in comparison to more senior players that have been around for longer. Honestly I feel a little lost, not quite sure what to do about it all as the changes are added. I've just recently started adjusting to blackout being a thing in terms of how I get my income.
---
But as time goes on (I hope) I'll get used to it all, etc. and find a good way of actually making money so that I can afford stuff ingame.
---
Add corvettes and frigates to the list too
---
Nullsec is dangerous place, or it should be. To be frank I trained capitals after many years playing. Starting from zero and getting directly to endgame skipping start and mid...ain't a good choice. There are way more lucrative ways to play without a carrier undocked.
---
With the ammount of isk and injectors in game most JF pilots won't spend a dime.
---
And all cloaky ships went up in price since the blackout, which in turn pissed goons and other null blocks that drove up T2 prices in general.
---
Ehh? Every bot that is allowed to actively run in the game has an immediate and direct reduction in the value of all human-player activities in terms of real purchasing power. The only area that this does not occur is in assets that cannot be purchased with "value" created from bots, which would include things like limited tournament ships and the like.
---
I'm not sure I understand the bazar prices. How much isk can I get for a random 5M SP Character? Who pays the transfer price, so how much isk do I actually get?
---
Goons are nazi's. More news at 11
---
Mine.
---
Lol someone paid for the plex one way or another.
---
That would be skill extractor moneys in hopes they will hit the sales goal for the bonus part of the PA deal, so they can smoke that too.
---
This is a very good idea. Cheers mate.
---
Us old players had to wait years, the new players should too.
---
Thank you for supporting me. I've been completely destroyed by downvotes on my comment lol.
---
I would like to ask you for an estimate of how long a recon will live when next to a hostile fleet
---
I am new, nothing changed, I am still flying in high sec and scanning for shit
---
Can alphas fly either they are saying can light the cyno after the change?  
---
Simply put :  $$$ 
---
I am not fan of changes either, but never did think a frigate or noob ship should be able do it either.
---
No it's not a troll post. This is actually how I play the game. At least until the Triglavians were extended to all systems.
---
oof
---
Idk if the people stuck in Anger, or Bargaining phase are sadder.
---
Loving the changes. I have moved to null for pvp and havent found any besides the super boring alliance pings. Every1 in null seem to be either ratting or mining and it felt wrong. I have moved to wh and loving it so far. Blackout had a negative effect in our small corp tho. Some null pve dudes joined us after blackput and they only do rating, sometimes I want to gank them. I mean they have brought multiple pve fits at day one and they still dont have any pvp fits for roaming or home defence :S
---
This is my eighth day in New Eden. I joined a Corp in the Delve Region and have had a great amount of help learning the game. So far I've had an absolute blast playing. I think blackout is a very great idea because I envision null sec as a place where isk is plentiful but so is the risk. 
---
I think when krabs are forced to organize or die the game's community will be a lot closer and make the game experience much better on the personal level. When I learned about the 'Umbrella' this week I thought it was awesome. After thinking about it i agree that it is a bit ridiculous having the ability to drop an entire fleet from anywhere. Restricting the use of Cyno's to certain ships forces more strategized gameplay imo.
---
I don't think the changes can truly be judged quite yet as we haven't seen them play out.
---
I love my Corp and alliance as they've helped me a ton. I look forward to still playing the game for awhile to come.
---
Alphas can't light cynos at all.
---
I invested towards something, now I feel like I wasted my time because of CCP. My corp/alliance mentors did a wonderful job helping me immerse myself in the game, but now they are quitting. So, I feel weary and disappointed.
---
Yes, of course someone did, but it is already there; and if more people decide to buy more plex because of this it will drive the price down, which it isn't a bad thing.
---
What I'm saying is that there are more than enough resources out there for JF pilots to quickly adapt using in game items to do so.
---
It happened with triglavian invasions coming out.
---
Sounds like this dude is just a moron? idk...
---
***" I as a person specializing on making umbrella space riskier, disagree. "***
---
That's not an argument....
---
***" People always argued that a more diverse selection of ships should be needed for null fights, rather than all capitals. Now CCP is partially making that happen. I'm pretty sure large capital forces can afford a couple of recons for each time they want to escalate a fight. "***
---
That's just a bizzare feat of logic. How is the FC saying *"right i need 5 people to switch out of DPS into a recon- , your job in this fleet is to light a cyno and then quickly die,"*, good for fleet combat? It's not like you would bring a  recon to a big mach brawl for any other reason, it doesn't have the tank.
---
 ***"Good. Capitals were ruining those brawls."*** 
---
First of all, why do you assume i'm talking about capitals? You've just seen a fight going down 9 jumps from your staging, there's already caps and sub-cap fleets on grid and you want to get your corp/alliance into the fight.
---
So as you rage-ping you move a fast cheap cyno to bridge in your fleet. That's how some of the best LS fights get started.
---
If i'm in a fight and i see a cyno go up i get excited. Some of the best brawls I've ever been in haven't been set piece fights, they've been gradual escalations from two or three, similar sized groups all living within range of each other. 
---
I lost a carrier the other day in LS. I was roaming with friends in a frigate gang about 9 jumps from our staging. A group of guys who lived 2 jumps out brought some battleships that we were never going to be able to kill with our fleet, so we dropped some carriers. Another group in the region escalated on us with a bigger fleet and a titan. We tried to catch the titan so we could escalate on that but we missed. If we had caught it i'm sure the fight would have been even bigger. Fights like that happen everyday in LS.
---
Without my disposable, fast cyno alt to bring in the carriers all that would have happened is we would have ignored the 2 battleships and continued on our way. So tell me how cynos and capitals ruined that brawl?
---
You've been spending too long worrying about titan blobs dropping to protect the rorqual you have tackled, to realise that capitals are balanced when everyone has a bunch of them in range.
---
***" Its a good thing if it keeps some people subbed/doing it/playing Eve. At the mere cost of 25% more cost for JF movements of goods."*** 
---
The mere cost of 25%? Really?
---
***"I personally lose something like 50 Naglfars in some months. Shuffle them quite often from NPC null system to another. I am OK with losing a couple of recons every time I move stuff. "***
---
Lets assume for a second that the average eve player doesn't spend as much time playing the game as you do. I'm personally not ok loosing a 300mil ship every time i want to move my 2bil carrier around.
---
God forbid someone provides constructive feedback, instead of rolling in absolute glee or tears, am I right?
---
Finally a use for those :-D
---
I wish the Lord and Savior would forbid it. Are you listening Hilmar?
---
I guess it is kinda the cold war. Everybody will be stocking up on nukes (supers) and nobody uses them unless they are all used simultaneously.
---
While perhaps reducing the times they are used to drop on single ships you dont lose them and therefore have no isk/ressource loss when they are baited or caught.
---
Imho we eant less supers and titans, not a stock just rising :)
---
Purely anecdotal, but most of my friends who quit due to the Phoebe changes never returned. Changes that make Eve more dangerous are good. Changes that make Eve more tedious are bad.
---
Marauders, a heavy cyno risking a lot of isk and cannot receive remote reps during bastion, possibly drop their ability to use cloaks or slow warp speed to help balance
---
You need to create a second load out in the launcher for the alts.  Screen orientation is tied to the default launch settings.
---
I had the same problem with my second screen until I made a second setup in the launcher then changed the default screen on that one.
---
You have no concept of supply and demand. If I use isk to buy plex, plex prices go up and it's more enticing for others to buy plex with real money and sell it on the market for isk. That's how this game economy works. Every injector is paid plex at some point. That's why they put them in the game. Money.
---
recon ships were intended to suicide into a hostile fleet?
---
Why would something change this is normal
---
You could be onto something here...
---
It's not a risk man, it's a guaranteed loss.
---
There is a need to have some data added to the selected item window at the very least.  A little bit more can also be conveyed by the lock icon.
---
Visual representation of data is often the most efficient for humans.  For example, the tactical view which shows vector arrows is pretty useful.  Color ranges can also be useful for showing other data, or data trends.
---
For example, if you could select a data "column," you could easily discern speed, or transversal, or signature or change in distance, or whatever is useful.  All that's needed is a little bit of an aura around each icon that shifts in color and/or intensity according to the available matched range.  A little bit of fiddling may be required to select the appropriate power law for the interpolation.
---
What you wouldn't see are names, only categorical data.  All that really means is that there would increased reliance upon squad tools for cooperation.
---
This ranks right up there with building the d-scan directly into the HUD.  It works for sites, and it could work for just about everything.
---
Before surrendering?
---
He said he made isk fast and got into station trading, not the other way around.
---
Hey! I'm one of those. I came back for blackout and love cyno changes.
---
Too much effort on their side. CCP likes to introduce only small changes, that don't require much work, but they still sometimes manage to screw them up. 
---
Chat servers tend to malfunction at least once a week, and you want them to add another service to that.  You are simply asking for too much.
---
&gt;I was told to get to carrier to make isk for pvp. I spent all my training time to do so for the last year including a couple of minor detours for doctrine subcaps.
---
Sounds like you fell into a big trap right there. None of that is anything that should be pushed onto a new player...
---
Now you've gotta eat the hot wings
---
Did you join karmafleet by any chance? Just curious.
---
I agree. Mainly with the m of make, the stuff behind it makes it hard to read. This should be avoided if possible, for example by adding a border or in this case you could also move the text down a bit.
---
Sounds like you have the beginnings of a skill farm though, just extract the SP, sell injectors, profit?
---
Yes, I literally bought a 90 day subscription, got into incursions with TVP. Made 200 mill an hour, then got into station-trading and industry. Never spent money on this game afterwards.
---
If that’s the type of game you want to play then play WoW. EvE is kinda like a decades long pick up game that never ends until you quit and then come back and then quit, etc, etc...
---
I'm with you on T3Cs, but I think bombers defeat a big part of what they're explicitly trying to nerf, namely disposable cyno ships.
---
deleted THIS account
---
This is what I find so sad about the current suggestions of nullsec blocs. It was just "skill into a few doctrines, then go straight to a carrier". You miss out on a large portion of the game. Subcaps are honestly where its at for me. I'm living in a wormhole corp with former null-seccers who are some of the most famous people in the game (you can probably guess at this point but I won't say). They were alliance directors and head FC's and they all chose subcap wormhole life over caps. The combat is just so much more fun. And personally, I've dropped titans. i've dropped supers. The experience still wasn't close to what I get in my nano jackdaw going 40-0 with a group of 5 friends versus 25 Brave members in null.
---
Take my upvote! I like it ;) a new background for my smartphone
---
If you're having trouble with ISK, might I suggest incursions or level 4 missions if you're interested in highsec.
---
Exploration needs some major work before it can accept a flood of players that large. It was already crowded before these changes.
---
LMAO this honestly made me laugh. I'm in a small wormhole corp too although we're pretty strict on PVP-focus.
---
Skill farms aren't really profitable are they? I don't have that many but most haven't been omega at all so can't really extract. I guess I could use them to generate isk from $ later  on..
---
It's great to see old blood back as well! People keep claiming that these changes are ruining the game even more than ever before but personally I think they're bringing the game *BACK* in the right direction!
---
I understand that, and fully and entirely hope you take the time to step back as I have and look at both sides of the coin... and realize theyre on the same coin.
---
Demonizing and turning blind eyes to your favorite by cherry picking happenstance is the road to tyranny.  
---
Good luck on your own political adventure figuring out what is real :)
---
Im crying as i type this.
---
It's like EVEOpalDragon except what your mom called you.
---
I know many guys are not happy about the change XD but do you really think the umbrellas will fall because of ship restrictions? Lol XD
---
He openly brought up discussion points of the "real" cancer in eve.
---
Refute him, and get off your ignorant high horse.
---
No, spent too much time talking to you.
---
Dont feel bad.
---
Without shit posts giving god awful game ideas.
---
CCP Falcon wouldnt have a job
---
Way ahead of you. Hope one day you end up not being complete trash but I won’t hold my breath 🗑
---
Friendship ended with  CURSE. Now FALCON is my best friend.
---
No wizard hat ?
---
We don’t need another expensive but higher EHP option - we have that with Black Ops Battleships. And making Marauders warp even more slowly is just not a good suggestion.
---
30-50 people won't come where you live if it is really rural with any frequency to break your playstyle.
---
You know we're about the only ones who are rich and organized enough to put active cyno recons in every system, right?
---
No regrets, who knew this change was coming, who knows how it will work out. Blackout was a big yawn, this may end up being as well.
---
If my path has been a poor one it is ultimately on me. I made those choices and I own them. If something is to be done I will adapt and help other to do so as well.
---
Lol and that logic keeps the player count down. I had to suffer so should you!
---
It should be.
---
Can't seem to find a good ship for for either. Just attempted a level 4 in a tempest and while I didn't die, I couldn't seem to track the drones and kill them and they ate through 5 of my vespa 2 drones
---
You can inject into any ship you want. It doesnt make you win. You don't get any other advantage over any other player. Look at zkill some some blingy shit fit ratter a few months old tend to die
---
I probably should have split the discussion into separate posts. 
---
By the way, I am referring to Covert Ops Frigates (Cheetah, Anathema, Helios, and Buzzard), not Stealth Bombers. I think the Stealth Bombers should be limited to Covert Cynosural Field Generators.
---
Literally, they should just take the 1x, 2x, 4x attributes on skills and apply them to injectors. X16 skills get 1/16th, x8 1/8th, and so on. It’s a crazy easy fix for ccp and doesn’t fuck new players.
---
I'm looking for the Ushra'Khan emblem but don't see it.
---
But the truth is, Grath, hat you don't know *everything* about Eve. Yes, your level of knowledge is up there, and personally I'd say you probably have a healthily broad array of basis that you know about. But UT is the gaps in your knowledge that lead to your personal biasim. You're right in that the person in question is wrong to declare that you know nothing, but you are also wrong to dismiss him with no further justification that your own ego. Hit him with some knowledge, brain him a bit. Tear his argument apart, and if you can't completely do so the acknowledge where he has merit. But you've honestly never been one for rational debate on this subreddit. You're not quite so bad as to simply slap down the 1v1 gauntlet at first slur, and clearly more in a right state of mind than the average knuckledragger on this subreddit, but I think it would do a lot of people a lot of good for you to display your prowess with more that bravado and satire. You don't have to do it every time, but every once in a while wouldn't hurt. Past accomplishments are great, but we must continually prove ourselves or we risk falling to complacency.
---
They also said they deliberatly made the loki OP so people would use it and they'd nerf it back to reasonableness..  
---
Been a year now... still waiting :(
---
Almost every suggestion I see includes 'have an alt'. Meaning an alt who is in omega status, which costs money making EvE a hefty investment at thirty dollars a month for some of us. What I fail to understand, and maybe you can enlighten me on this as I am still new to all of this: Why does it matter that null corps are isk fountains? Wasn't null space DESIGNED to be conquered, protected and exploited just as TEST and GSF do? Aren't most of these empires successful due to an immense network of players and player built and maintained infrastructure? If so, isn't that kinda the point? If so, it seems like this is a company punishing its players for...playing their game....
---
I for one, have no interest in flying a capital after hearing this, as it feels like an extortion racket to have reliable access to endgame content. If that's the case, then I will take my money else where, and I suggest others do the same. EvE was already an unfriendly game for us newbros, but I stuck around looking towards the future. Now, I'll just stay Alpha, and one of the few things I looked forward to is now gated behind alt requirements.
---
I completely support EVE being more dangerous, but this change is just dumb.
---
Top meme, nicely done
---
Black ops high ehp since when? 
---
Why would slowing their warp be a bad idea? 
---
By removing the cloak and reducing the speed would give  the attackers a picture of the battle field. It makes u chose to light the cyno out of position or try and warp and they may be able to get the inhib down in time. If u want it faster u can sacrifice tank for hypers making it easier to kill
---
&gt;*you need to pay for multiple accounts even though you are already struggling to generate Omega overhead isk on the single account you currently have*
---
I summarized it for you.
---
Bait and trash. The brutix wasn't fit with anything.
---
I started building a shit ton of Curses. Now I can't even sell them at cost. I hate industry.
---
People want to kill shit.
---
Nullsecurity space has no big bad concord to let people kill shit without consequence.
---
Null blocs built up null space to make it livable and defensible for... years. 10s of trillions and thousands of players banding together to make this happen.
---
People want to kill shit, but finding targets is effort.  And effort is hard.  So they go to bloc space for the kills.
---
They die or do next to no damage to organized groups that outnumber their roams thousands to one.
---
This makes getting kills there hard.  But they REALLY want to get kills.  See if they play eve without killing someone else ^(that cant fight back) then eve is broken and unfun for them.
---
So... How do you fix this?  You could try forming your own group... but that takes time, and effort, and as shown above... thats no bueno because its hard.  They could join those big groups, but then they wouldnt be as cool killing something that has spent so much time effort and manpower preparing for them.
---
 They wouldnt be the *chaos*  bringing *danger* to eve, getting the kills of other players ^(that cant fight back) that they simply must have for this game to be balanced and fun.  
---
So. again.  How do you fix this?  If joining them is lame because you aren't a cool hunter showing the game you dont need no hand to hold *^(if they cant fight back)* *... but*... losing to them is also unfun.
---
You rally the cry, and convince yourself and EVERYONE you can that... "nullblocs" and "null sec" is evil and op and "killing the game".  Of course, naturally everyone knows that isnt the case. But if things DONT change... how can your 5 minute preparation roam get the kills of evil dirty krabs and botters and all the other evil null labels youll put on it to show how righteous and actually a superhero type of player you are.
---
You know CCP Falcon frequents a public place called reddit, and as with most vocal minorities all you have to do is scream as loudly as possible. Not because you're lazy and entitled to your kills ^(of things that cant fight back)... nonono.  You scream for JUSTICE and... BALANCE.  People spending years and millions of man hours shouldnt compare to your righteous playstyle, people shouldnt be able to survive your short formed gangs of small and fast ships. You are the HERO like luke skywalker vs the EMPIRE!!!  
---
And you pray.  Pray and pray, that with enough deomizing, and justice-blathering screeching the universe and devs will change the entire game to nullify ALL of their preparations and time to ensure you dont have to match them.  You will be able to fight them without even putting in 1/10000th the time they did, and you DESERVE that. They dont deserve anything, theyre LUCKY and boring and abuse the economy by playing the game without following the "true" way to play eve that only non null bloc players understand. YOU DESERVE KILLS, and they... those filthy krabs... they deserve to have no fun, and be griefed and explode defenseless and helpless.  They are too SAFE! Not because they made nullsec what it is with unbelievable effort...no... but its the GAME'S fault for not being built in a way that would counter this OBVIOUS exploit of macro economic warfare, industry, and other "krabbing" that ISNT FAIR to the rest of eve for not having the same. Fuck null, and fuck everyone who stops you from your righteous kills, your easy roams, and your salt mining, and you will scream and ragepost and cloaky camp, grief, steal, do whatever you can ^(that totally isnt salt) while rallying the bannerman of reddit, the ones with tags you know they wear as your brethren.  The ones who share your justice and hatred for the "evil" people who dared to build their empires above you.  
---
Null... is too safe. You DESERVE to be "the danger".  and YOU DESERVE to be the "chaos" that this game needs.  So go!  Undock your cheap frigates you skilled into last week, cloak and shoot those filthy krabs and post, oh post about all the salt you mine!  YOU are the HERO of new eden! 
---
..........

Doesnt that sound so much better than "They're winning and I dont wanna try to do anything so fuck them i dont like it &gt;: ("?
---
Lolmemeca Bronze, CSM
---
I'm not autistic, you arrrr.
---
Just stop thinking about caps. I mean if you think about 'how to make money' and already got a carrier it was for sure too early to get a carrier. Start with some c3 WHs for easy money or try incursions.
---
What kind of fit are you using? Level 4's are pretty solvable and I'm sure many people will be willing to help you out (myself included)
---
&gt; weird to think that we need to be told when to fight
---
you don't need to be told when to fight - you just need a reason to do it. "for the sake of it" isn't a reason.
---
You're an idiot.
---
a shitposted is chaine by no gender, only the keys of his art brush
---
Yeah black bordered font should be readable on virtually any background and will make the text pop a bit more, too.
---
simple question.
---
how does this change get more people in null sec undocked and doing things?
---
Who are you to defy the Bob?! It's your duty to murder your foe by words, preferably after you murdered him by conventional weapon. You couldn't even talk in local if Bob didn't want this. You are completely at his mercy.
---
Wormholer btw.
---
The cake is a lie!
---
Max of ~400k EHP is twice as much as you can get from a Force Recon. I don’t want super tanked Cyno ships to be a thing anymore.
---
Everything in EVE is a mess and panties are twisted on a massive scale.
---
Now is a *wonderful* time to get into EVE. The shakeups are always the best times.
---
You came back for the Blackout......and didn't join in the Blackout?
---
I'd welcome a regional local for null sec.
---
Logical discussion escapes him, you gotta put this in MS Paint for him to remotely understand
---
I'll message you when I get home and can look I don't remember off hand. I bought some plex to stay apart in game until I get the hang of it.
---
This is a pretty good compromise solution that satisfies the requirements of both sides of the argument. It makes it easier for hunters to disrupt krabbing and adds an element of danger to it while also giving krabbers a fair way to detect threats before they arrive and make appropriate risk/reward decisions.       
---
Naturally, this means that if this is ever implemented everyone will spray salt everywhere, sperg out, and threaten to unsub, because we just can't have good things in our game.      
---
This community deserves so much worse than CCP, I swear.
---
But is the force recon going to get there before the inhib is up? Because if you are telling me to make ANOTHER account just to have a force recon standing by......then this is just a CCP cash grab and you guys are buying into it.
---
most intelligent claims do seem idiotic to the uneducated, so I take that as a compliment
---
It was supposed to be tied to sov ownership, though this many years later, who the fuck knows anymore.
---
Also, after doing some reading; this does seem a bit targeted. Force recon ships are great in small gang stuff, to be sure but their tank is pretty bad universally. This seems like a way to simply harm groups of people who have tamed the dangerous space they live in as an attempt to get login numbers and sales up....That really could be seen as a slap in the face.
---
Good job building your sand castle- now pay me to come kick it down, and thank me for the privilege.
---
Link lossmail
---
You bridge force recons to covert cyno with a blops lmao
---
I'll be fucking damned, a non-terrible idea suggestion on r/eve
---
Eve needs more NPC stations in carefully selected constellations. These become staging areas for raids and invasions. These become temporary refuges for smaller groups when larger groups come through to glass a region.

I like PvE in Eve. Sure, I want them to update the system to be more dynamic and interesting, even have a few ideas. But I actually enjoy ratting. I like the high apms of running two super carriers simultaneously. I like the pretty explosions and the cinematic effect of the camera. And I really like treasure hunting, getting that rare drop or cap spawn, or running escalations. I liked the PvE well enough. So you're wrong, friend.

Why is amarr going t3 soon? Reee
---
Black Ops Battleships are notoriously squishy. 200k is about the most you're gonna pull out of a t2 fit. Nothing to sneeze at, but that's a very attractive target, especially when there is no way someone is going to be around to protect every single one of them at all hours.
---
  
---
At the very least we will see a reduction in the number of cynos permanently up, perhaps only being in the most used positions.
---
F
---
Sounds like something an autist would say.
---
The same argument could be made for t3cs with their possible tank, with them having an added advantage of smaller sig and nullification so it would be harder to control the grid for an offensive stand point.
---
I mean I would love to see both classes get the cyno ability, but I don’t think we will be seeing any changes to this for a least a month post deployment
---
Good bot
---
It was a high sec duel where i got the guy to agree to no guns and 1 drone, he thought a faction hobgoblin could kill a corvette, hence the armor damage
---
It's funny how it all works out. I am one of those new players who stayed, got really into the game,  bought some injectors, got into a carrier in 8 months, max skill orca + exhumer, living happily in null with my big blob alliance that flies a lot of fleets.
---
Then the drifters came. No more mining and carrier ratting until this is over. It's just temporary right?
---
Then the blackout came. Oh well, no more mining until this is over. Because it's just temporary right?
---
And now the cynos are gone, and with that, no more carrier ratting. All my isk making activities gone in the course of weeks. I wont be able to buy new doctrine ships, thus my pvp gameplay is brought to a halt.
---
I was happy with my setup. I didn't swim in isk, basically crabbed when I needed and lived paycheck to paycheck, but I had fun in fleets. Well, now what. I'm leaving. Unsubbed my 3 accounts. The game has literally become unplayable and I don't wish to wait months (more money to CCP, that was the plan right?) to train new skills for other activities.
---
Thank you CCP. You don't deserve any new players. Good thing wow classic launches soon.
---
You could just exclude ships larger than bs and smaller than cruiser.  It achieves the goal without forcing a 400m loss every time a loud cyno is lit for combat purposes.
---
It’s called alliance chat.
---
Sounds ironic coming from the race where everyone worships tatoos (and some weird bunch of Vherokior mystics guards their secrets)  and depending on it one\`s life can be worse than terror...
---
Started EVE about a month ago.. I am hooked. Had a very similar experience to you. Beginning EVE is daunting, but after a few sessions things start to make sense. One people figure out that they'd love to fly a Gila you start taking more risks. :D
---
warp in a fragile Recon ship to light the cyno which will definitely get blapped regardless if anything can jump.
---
Ftfy :)
---
Says the mockingdouchebird
---
Injectors turned out not great. But a lot if not all the chaos "fixes" being introduced are to fix things CCP put in game and a lot of players saw coming way off. Inflation. The proliferation of Rorq's. The proliferation of cap umbrellas. That didn't just spring up overnight out of someones dream. It's a direct response to things CCP did to the game.
---
you apparently didnt spend the 3seconds to check the post/link below you...
---
I like CCPs change. Cyno ships were literally a throw away ship used to execute one of the most powerful abilities in the game. Like everything else in this game, we'll all get used to it. Cynos should be expensive and risky. I say give it a chance.
---
my waist disagrees :(
---
Lighting a loud cyno on a blops is even more retarded than using a recon.
---
Death to slavers
---
They have sped up the response needed since things change rapidly on the player end now. Too bad CCP moves at a glacial pace.
---
Me too. I want playing at all. But danger is why we log in. So here I am. 😄
---
I still think the HIC should be allowed to keep cyno.  
---
Even with the increased price of Cyno ships, many titan/super owners will still attempt to move around through lowsec. Since there are no bubbles the easiest way to catch one is with a Cyno HIC. Tackle and open cyno.  
---
If the goal is to make supercap life harder than why are they making it easier/safer to solo move supers?
---
Try and Cerberus or Gila.
---
Slavers? Yep, we can agree on that.
---
How bout you put your money where your mouth is, otherwise keep being a trash tier thera wanna be scrub that cant even successfully lead t1 fleets
---
That's actually a separate ship listed in the game's files, and it's rather fitting since the Comet started out as a police ship in the lore. Maybe CCP are planning to release it?
---
Burger&gt;reposts
---
Pay to win, that's a bit of a joke. Just because you've got a fancy ship doesn't mean you're actually going to be any good, in fact you should be thankful for the skill injectors because it gives subpar players an easy time getting loot of newbies haha
---
Enjoyed this fleet we came with the test goku fleet , was fun to team up with everyone for 1 goal regardless of standings
---
" 1 carrier to go through a covert cyno "  
---
No. goodbye.
---
In 8 years of wormhole space I wasn’t evicted. No one even came close except for the giant ass blob that came and shot my fortizar.
---
Putting my money where my mouth is? What do you call running both the Corp in fw space, the c5 Corp, and my c2 Corp which all 3 were LEAGUES better then the trash tier scrublord Corp you have run consistently and have never gotten any better.
---
Can’t successfully run t1 fleets? Hahahaha
---
I agree. I tried to form a fleet yesterday at oiniken and in fairness two other people joined in and we met at a nearby station. I was guess the invasion was glorified ratting but I was mistaken. We were set upon en mass outside the station and two ships were lost, with one player saying along the lines of "Well thats 50 million isk wasted". 
---
I just managed to retreat in time, having first thought we'd handle it ok, to "OH NO MY GOD DAMN HULL IS HALF HEALTH" warp warp warp, in a matter of seconds. 
---
Co-ordinating a response to the invasion is pretty hard. I wish there was a prompted fleet staging mechanic to get newish players in on the fight.
---
They keep closer to the Caldari hisec span.
---
just light a cyno
---
Been playing almost a year. I was affected by the VNI changes as I did a lot of ratting in one but had moved away from it when it got boring. The trig invasion is interesting but I haven't played with it much. Null sec stuff doesn't bother me at all. I might be a bit upset about the new recon ships blapping miners as that's what I mostly did in HS until moved to J space recently. No skilled enough to care about the cyno changes. 
---
Just sitting in my WH waiting for sleepers to start showing up randomly. :)
---
Overall I welcome the changes and am willing to adapt to them. There are some salty newbros out there however.
---
I dunno. Everyone calls my Uncle John an "ol' hound dog" but Gramps said he was useless on the farm.
---
Then light a quiet one, they might not notice
---
It was my understanding that not all stations have guns?
---
Are you criminal by any chance?

Only if the modules provide multiplicative bonuses and they affect the same stat. [Here's the e-uni article on it](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Stacking_penalties) First module is 100%, Second module is ~87%, Third module is ~55%, Fourth Module is ~28%, Fifth module is ~11%.
---
Modules are typically good up until about the fourth one of the same type, then it's debateable depending on the effect you get out of it.
---
I'll be the first to say that wormholes are more isk dense than NS. But there is Way more NS than there is whs. Whs will cap out long before NS ever will. And I'm just counting bounties not drops.. 
---
Oh and NVM that whs take days to spawn the necessary content for the numbers your talking about. There is way more super ratters in ns than wh space has population..
---
 
---
Rorq income is only a problem because cynos make them near invulnerable.
---
Came back after an 8 year hiatus. Lots of stuff changed but damn I got blooped first week checking out an anomaly (also new) in my old lowsec stomping grounds. That, and T3 all over
---
I’m not really opposed to letting HIC’s fit Cynos, but I don’t think it will get easier to solo move Supercapitals. The solo Supercapital pilot will be burning 300m ISK per jump IOT move safely via suicide Cyno. On the hunter side, the Supercapital is just as hard to tackle as it is currently, but the HIC pilot needs a Force Recon alt to bring in the fleet to kill the Supercapital. Rather than make the hunter have to bring more characters, I would make Supercapitals easier to tackle. I’d remove the warp core strength from Supercapitals and let anything with a point tackle them.

---
That bomb drop looked real satisfying.
---
The changes have not really affected me. I have focussed on sub-cap skills the last 8 months since I started and have decided to take it slow and not time travel into caps with skill injectors. This has led me to explore many other dimensions of the game such as wormhole daytrips which has taught me to use dscan effectively. I do understand the impact on older players since they are now forced to re-strategise, but I think its healthy and makes the sandbox a bit more unpredictable and interesting.
---
Calling people retards in a discussion is a sure way to be ignored. Insults don't help your (or any) side of the argument.

I refuse to take part in any discussion with people that insult others for no reason. Don't waste my time.

And my horse is clean.
---
&gt; You don't have to do it every time
---
i quite literally used to do it all the time, but its been over a decade of doing it that wears that thin.
---
The intent of the change is to limit cynos, and reddit is literally the worst place to post to get developer attention and interaction.  I just dont feel the need to pamper people that post thigns like he did in the face of that very obvious information.
---
I like the idea very much. The text is not punchy enough. Also, these are not two sentences, it’s one sentence split across the image. That... not the most effective message.
---
True.  And irrelevant.
---
Well considering it's likely going to be bridged in by a bomber/t3c lighting a covert cyno... yea, it is being teleported, lighting a cyno for 5m warpong off grid if it lives and waiting for a  bridge home.
---
You spouted a bunch of trash, that you cant back up, go on, delete your account now. At least one subreddit will be bettered.

Hahaha I don’t see how I can’t back up having a good history of running and founding good corporations and you can’t even run one after trying for a decade.

Fuck your self you trash tier low class wormhole scrub

Don't pretend to be so familiar with Bob... YOU CALL HIM MISTER ROBERT, YOUNG LADY!
---
As a supercap hunter, I have tackled many supers and titans in lowsec with HIC. There are tricks and its a bit of an art to catching them.  
---
The issue is timing. I consider the HICs I use to be suicide HICs due to the ability of supercarriers to kill them quite quickly. If you cannot get more HICs or tackle Rorqs on field fast enough the supercarriers will just kill the HIC and warp off. Then bounce around system. Especially around downtime when I have killed supers with just seconds left before sever shutdown.

Then again I guess you're one of the few who actually witnessed me doing \~*elite pvp*\~ shit, these guys don't get you can play both krab defense and krab killaz iN tHa NeWzZz. Hell you played both sides of the ball yourself.
---
Random question - did you find that defending your krabs took more skill and effort than hunting and dropping krabs? I have. It seems much more challenging to be on the defender's side imho.
---
I'm gonna post a screenshot of how many times you have copy pasted this post from EVE-O forums and reddit :P

Don't AFK: solved 😀

Any word on when this will be implemented?

holy fuck you have not idea how supply &amp; demand works under the influence of environmental negatives

Good points. I hope CCP listens.
---
Get hecates, go to nullsec, enjoy.
---
Just started this month, I read the reddit posts but have no idea what people are talking about half the time because of the crazy space pirate lingo. So far what I've learned is that people are pissed about cyno s and game play changes, meanwhile I've only been to Nullsec once besides wormholes and I got hate camped in 2 seconds, still enjoying the game though.
---
Grath... cmon man... you know that's quite a stretch for argument reasons. You and I both know there is fuck all in that space but sov-wanded sov structures we left behind as an FFA.
---
Highly doubting a 100 vs 100 man AF fight will make pcgamer
---
So far, I'm loving the game. I joined a nullsec mining corp a few weeks in before eventually moving to EVE University. I've made some expeditions into low and null before taking my gains back to highsec. Lost a few ships to gankers and was rather surprised to get paid for it a couple times, though there was one asshole a week ago who said he attacked anyone he saw doing PVE because "I don't like carebears."
---
Don't get me wrong, I knew EVE was going to give me lumps and I was prepared to take them, but I was expecting to get blown up because I was hauling something valuable, had something shiny fitted, or just because the attacker felt like it, not because someone got their shorts in a twist because I play the game differently from them.
---
As for the blackout and cyno changes, I haven't been playing long enough to really form an opinion about them. I hope they're good for the health of the game, because I want to keep playing for as long as I possibly can. EVE has captivated me in a way that no other game I've played ever managed.
---
Hell, I'm so excited about it that I've even started writing down a bunch of ideas that my ignorant newbro hide thinks might be good or interesting. All I have to do now is finish the document and then work up the nerve to post it with the hope I'll get constructive criticism instead of being flamed into oblivion. :p
---
Simply put, I think I'm in love.
---
Can you try the probe, magnate and imicus as well please you sexy Slovakian beast
---
They are actually trying to fix the problem that has plagued eve for last 3 years. You guys had no issue with the problem because you benefited from it. But you have a problem with a fix obviously.
---
Also, Your politics of bluing up most of null will likely kill null before CCP does.
---
Hire this guy
---
Adapt or die. Btw you don't have to be in a cloaky ship while in a wormhole. I guess it really comes down to PvP elite cloaky hunters don't want to have the new eve chaos affect them.
---
Please add giant injector
---
Injectors are here to stay, nothing can be done about them now
---
Add combat recons, hics, dics, and eaf.
---
Join us, nullsec refugees.  What really is there to lose?
---
It's implemented in development branch for a couple of weeks already. I've been fixing various bugs for a week and adding new graph types for a week, now only 2 graph types and 0 bugs remaining out of those i wanted to fix.
---
It means that most likely I will make a release this sunday.
---
he did some probe and magnate shit earlier on his channel, not sure if imicus was done though.
---
Pretty much this.
---
good idea on surface, but not so good if you think through it. 
---
Region wise chat will simply give more Intel away than local chat! Everyone not 100% AFK will dock up as soon as red/nuets spike up.
---
Using a carrier to rat was fine but I decided to stop with that after the local changes and started doing the same in a dread instead, which perform better than a carrier. It’s just that once I’ve settled they introduce even more changes that might force me to scrap that investment and start all over.
---
Blackout is fun.  It's like wormhole space, which I adore, because it's deadly and exciting.  Are more things cloaky today because of that?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I explore with cov ops cloak, but I don't load up in a manticore to hunt, and I still go in wh space with a little PvP fit frig and probes.  So blackout isn't different from what I'm used to.
---
My brief time in null was boring, because it was either rat, mine, or smash together giant blobs.  Give me small gangs and fair fights, not this asymmetric projection of power by capitals and money making bot armies.  I am good with anything that reduces the negative impact of such gameplay.  If that's this new change to cynos, then yes, please; more of that.
---
I long for a game so unlikt WoW and its clones, where players actually need one another and make friends in-game.  **It boggles my mind that people do this 40 alt account bullshit.  That you need 40 alt accounts is a goddamn sign you should be engaging with other living souls to accomplish goals rather than subbing a ton of proxies to play alone.**  Jfc, play a game with friends and stop trying to optimize your gameplay into a lucrative isk-making machine with null "safe spaces" everywhere.
---
Anything else - to me - feels like people are whining about their precious isk and safe havens of alliance space.  Ymmv.
---
yes
---
Guess I'll just all it and start robbing people for isk lol
---
Yea sadly instead of useful things that would legitimately improve quality of life... we get excavators, panic modules, and citadels with the times that can be tz tanked
---
The recon will die if it lights a hard cyno on grid with enemy forces.  Pretty much every time.  It isn't about patience.  You are stuck for 5 min.  Who do you think they will shoot first if not the recon?
---
Isn't botting one of the reasons James315 started CODE, or am I not remembering correctly?
---
Started a month ago. 
---
Was honestly surprised that blackout wasn't everywhere always.
---
Have no understanding or clue about the other changes. Most of it is still jargon to me.
---
I guess imicus can be hard because it only has 1 turret slot
---
F for my ears having to listen to the garbage you threw on in the background.
---
So you're saying the nullblocs need to make use of that other definition of SALT?
---
You been completely ignorant of how anyone else plays the game shows you are just a bad csm.

---
This time i figured I'd try a unified "Biomass Yourself" approach.
---
I started just over a year ago, I'm loving the changes, blackout has made null a lot more interesting from both a pve and pvp perspective, very hard to know who is around and who might come if you engage a fight,
---
New Cyno changes, fantastic, I guess it's a bit sucky for the solo carrier dropper, since he now needs a dedicated force recon alt, and even a dedicated covert Cyno and blops bridge for the recon if he doesn't want to gate the recon, but I think guys at that level have the ISK balance to accomplish this and will adapt, will make cap fights interesting, if you're slow to jump you may miss out on getting in on the fight, and bridging a fleet onto grid would be highly risky, with a high chance the subcap fleet lands on the sun, but for the lower SP subcap focused new players, I think this is a fantastic change, low sec roams you generally know what to expect and fairly easy to look up those in local to see if any of them have recon losses and who they are aligned with, meaning less hotdrops when taking a fight, meaning more people will take fights they normally wouldn't take, I think it will be great!
---
Haha Hahahahaha
---
Hmm... shit... I think I might have accidentally filled in your void from the first part. 
---
...omg I have become a bitter vet haven’t I?

Actually that's the explanation PIBC offered. The term "Man-Gou" initially was coined by their opponents, because in Chinese it literally means "Blind Dog", ie. blind dogs (akin to a spodbrain nullbear in our Tranquility) following their maser. Being called a "Blind Dog" obviously didn't sit well with many PIBC members so they instead used a more literal English translation instead. Quite funny when I was on Serenity and someone called me a "Blind Dog"
---
Assault *style* machariels. Probably fitted with 1500-ARtillery.

Imagine if Jita chat was everywhere in Eve, all the time, in every language.
---
Buy a t1 frig (I.e. heron) and go do explo, go and run abyssals, rat with a buddy, buy an Ishtar and ded’s (I know, you have to use d-scan, so inconvenient I know /s)
---
People who say that they have no way to make isk are either lazy or dumb, or probably both.
---
Hell, you still can carrier rat, you just can’t be brainless about it anymore.
---
It's a troll post mate i deal with real newbro on a daily basis. Real newbro don't have a fucking clue what most the stuff is he mentions.
---
Think about it. If no one has any reason to take over all of space, we’ll get the pandafam donut and the Imperial Legacy donut. So at a minimum that’s two major mega coalitions always in conflict. 
---
The only way tranquillity becomes serenity is if goons and test have a reason and the ability to completely evict the north. By making moving dangerous, deployments more expensive (since all ratting and mining will stop, not just all capital/supercap ratting and mining), and dropping caps harder, it makes a serious offensive by Goonswarm much less likely and much less likely to succeed.
---
Injectors make them money so why on earth would they want to nerf them lol
---
&gt; **players Inject Recon alts** 
---
See? To CCP, no problem here. More extractors get bought to make injectors. More money.
---
I started a few weeks ago (again) and am still not done with the agent missions.  
---
Mining is nice though. Hope to do that more in the future.
---
Who took all your stuff?
---
Always go for a passive regeneration ship like a rattlesnake. As a newer player I did level 4s for ages with a T1 rattle and never died. Switched to T2 modules and got even better and faster. Ticks are of course never to be compared with high end crabbing like Rorqual or supercarrier ratting but it gives decent isk for high sec. Once you have enough standing to access all level 4 agents good missions come in regularly.
---
&gt;I was told to get to carrier to make isk for pvp.
---
Same with me but eh.
---
Switch to subcaps for ratting. Less isk at risk and frankly at this point, its probably for the best.
---
Buy the CSM leaks, sell the news
---
Thanks
---
Made a looking for corp post 10 days ago. No posts on an eve-related subreddit before that.
---
Nice
---
Name of the game unfortunately, since blackout spiked the risk side of the equation when it comes to subcap ratting. Carriers can be saved on occasion, any subcap that gets pointed dies unless bait fit, but you aren't making money while bait fit.
---
Brilliant. Activate Windows!
---
There was a time when we had active fleets to protect our ratters. They couldn't just rat solo in a system.
---
They become more meaningful when ship costs go up, that's the point.
---
Injectors make CCP a lot of money, not to mention it evens the plane field for younger characters like some of my friends. I think you're just upset that some people can afford more injectors than you can afford.
---
Just....damn XD
---
Create a new profile, run fullscreen on primary screen, change resolution to 1920x1080, move it to the other screen (adapter), then change to fixed.

That feeling when you realize that your days of botting safely in goon space and selling ISK for cash are finished. You apply for an IT position and dont understand why everyone is laughing at you for writing down 'auto-hotkey' as your coding experience. You eventually end up on the streets hooked on smack and dating some druggy chick named Carla... You and Carla raise a few kids in a van down by the river. None of the kids are actually yours.  You are having spam and peas for dinner again. Carla and the kids roll their eyes as you reminisce for the millionth time about Eve and botting and 'The good ol days".
---
There won’t be a next change, this cyno change will further reduce the krab populace down to the last remaining skilled krabs that you won’t be able to kill. These changes are going to murderzone hunting reserves and not a single one of these dipshits can wrap their heads around that fact.
---
Honestly, just give it a go and see how it feels to you. A lot of people call popular ships trash, and you never know what will feel good to fly from your point of view
---
Not for everyone. Some people find it more comfortable to play solo, but that's a rarity.
---
Source: me.
---
an esi endpoint is busted. it'll be fixed monday.
---
You can make pretty isk with data/relic sites. One Site is about 10min without combat (except in SOME sites in wh space), with a cheap t1 frig / astero / t2 covert ops.
---
1. Search a WH 
---
2. Scan the WH - search for Data and Relic Sites. You could skip data sites, because a Data Site makes only 5-10mio, a Relic Site makes 30-60 mio.
---
3. Always check when the WH will be closed
---
4. You can use WH exits to null sec to and run some sites there, and then get back home with the wormholes.
---
Easy money without really investing anything.
---
Remember while wetdreaming and pretending it will grant you free capital kills
---
the people you are “hotdropping” will have alts with the same ships and strategies to return the favor...
---
Hey so there's kind of a lot to explain here but let me try and hit your main questions.
---
* Cynos are a module that lets you summon friendly capital ships to you. The biggest ships in the game. 
---
* Previously you could fit them on any ship, now they're restricted to a few fairly expensive subcaps, so no more cheap cyno ships.
---
* When used, the ship very often dies because it's locked in place for 10 minutes. This wasn't a problem on caps which could tank or on subcaps which were cheap but now neither of those are options so using a cyno becomes a major decision.
---
* Are they making it tougher? I suppose so, they're making the currently normal way of moving caps around suddenly very risky / expensive for those players who want to do so. Caps will certainly move around less, use gates more and the capital ships of larger alliances will make more use of ansiblex cyno beacons their alliances provide.
---
* Is eve easier than it used to be? Not really, if anything added features have added even more to the game and now there's even more meta knowledge involved than there was in the past perhaps. That said, large nullsec alliances have carved out some fairly safe space in nullsec (in large part due to gameplay changes which allowed them to do so) and so people do complain that that particular area of gameplay has become too safe.
---
So whats changed?
---
15 days on an alpha skill plan is all it takes to get into action. Brave newbros have been doing it for new players to great success.
---
Um, you cant profit from afk bot cloaking.....
---
Null isk faucets are bad but the investment requirement is fine
---
Wormhole blue loot is ignored because it doesn’t fit the “grrr null” mentality again...
---
making strategic maneuvers requiring more effort means “it will help the little guy” yeah ok.... I’ll take my 5 cloaked alts with a vastly experienced super unbrella over a hot drop attempt any day
---
Just because you type more doesn’t mean any part of it is right...
---
Which is nice
---
Right the 60 year olds that hang out in high sec or just enjoy hauling cause they have nothing better to live for.
---
That’s fine. It’s all in the game.
---
to your first sentence
---
RIGHT back at all the people these changes are supposedly benefitting
---
- fuel for cloaks
---
- remove skill injectors
---
- "accidentally" delete goonswarm
---
is this a troll post?
---
I kind of hope so.
---
selling skill was a thing befor selling skills you could train a toon to do a one trick pony thing like a titan and sell it so your logic is flawed but i was against pay to win befor pay to win was a thing but its here so i use it
---
..... not yet, technically
---
I started in late october, and as I do lots of blopsy hunting stuff I think the recent changes benefit me. I can't fly capital ships which means that the cyno changes pretty much only effect me positively. 
---
One downside with the recent changes is a lack of an obvious way to make isk. When I started it was basically:
---
Step 1: train into a VNI
---
Step: 2: spin havens
---
Step 3: profit
---
I am happy to see that this has changed since it was the most mind numbing thing Ive done in eve. Since then Ive trained into combat ships and a tengu for crabbing.
---

upvoted because that was funny with all the ww2 attempts at logic
---
Lmao
---
You do realize there are what at least 4 other csm players to represent "your" style of play and have been for years. So you sound like a bitch.
---
Nah, you just never played the game without auto hotkey. Bombers can be solo'd by a fucking atron, kid.
---
BS is not alwys the best for level 4s a drake is a good choice so is a vexor you may have to do some skill to mke it work but use https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReports to pick ships
---
Remove citadels)))
---
Tbfh they for ONCE are splitting risk to not just fall to defenders with this change
---
I’m hoping they don’t realize that because then they’ll buff them to hell and back to rectify it so they can freely kill pve ships on their alt-  
---
Sorry i meant “make eve dangerous”
---
Yas beebee! Is this kilted?
---
Depleting resources. If you over-farm a region, it depletes. You cannot just sit still under an umbrella, you have to move it sprawl. Big groups will sprawl, making supercap umbrella less effective.
---
The way he talks is just too inviting to engage in a highly intelligent conversation. I was thinking of writing this as a comment at first, but it got way too long : D
---
Just mine with fleets. Orcas have remote shield boosters.
---
Like every other change recently
---
It won’t affect the large sov blocs
---
It won’t shift the power dynamic
---
It literally only makes it easier for wormhole dwellers and npc null dwellers to get some kills.
---
That’s literally all these changes accomplish
---
For low skill point pilots i would recommend getting a ligature integrated analyzer, it does data and relic sites. Hit me up ingame if you need a good fit for it.

Wow what?  In a sandbox the person who makes the biggest sand castle is harder to bring down?
---
I thought in sandboxes the most powerful way to win was to do nothing and farm as little as possible...
---
If the null groups only took the space they needed and could populate  - the blackout, cyno changes etc wouldnt be a big deal.
---
It is curious how with the 1000's of members these groups have - not one of them has managed to work this out.
---
The downside of the cyno change is the same as when fatigue came in - The low sec small groups who just wanna jump a few frigates/cruisers in their carrier to a new staging system get fucked over by changes required to save the nullbears from themselves. 
---
A more practical solution would be to allow cynos on anything but only one ship can jump per cyno.
---
'But then every ship in a fleet will have a cyno on it' - you all say .  Well thats easy fixed.
---
Cyno cpu/pg usage worked out as a % fixes lots of problems. So say 30% of the ships total - that way you need to sacrifice your fit on any ship you wish to fit a cyno too.
---
I am not "negotiating a better deal" I am simply making an argument that the changes in their current form are to an extent needless restrictive and also inquiring if there is some justification for them that I have not considered. If there is some great reason that you have to share that explains why only force recons and BLOPS please share rather than just simply asserting that it exists. As of yet, nobody has really been able to explain why it is better for it to just be those two ship classes.
---
I didn't get the info firsthand, so I don't know if it's accurate, but I've been told extractors only work if you have more than 5.5m SP. If that is the case, then SP farming isn't really viable for an Alpha clone, since you would no longer be able to passively skill up once you hit 5m SP. But for an Omega who already skilled into their chosen specialty fully, it could be useful for shaving off unneeded skills elsewhere or just making use of a resource that would otherwise be doing nothing of value.
---
If they’re on defense?  
---
Cry on the forums until it gets nerfed
---
If not he hunting side?

---
Just sub with real money then. Buying plex is the most time efficient source of income anyways
---
The economy will be amazing and people will be able to make an impact. Scarcity is GOOD for economy. Get off your ass and go get the modules if you want them! Something not on the market. Get off your ass and make it! Or fly a different fit. The choice is yours.
---
Definitely new, just have been doing research and asking questions.
---
I have no friends.
---
Join a corp and talk to people. It makes a world of difference
---
A miner for 4 years with a single rorq who is happy that he can’t mine passively any more
---
And you think he’s honest?
---
What is your opinion about removing cyno beacons from the overview when not on grid?
---
This would help moving stuff, since players would have to use dscan to be aware of it and probes to hunt down the 500m ship lighting it. You can keep them on the map.
---
Except when they uncloak using tactical placement
---
Which... is kind of important in any 3d strategy game literally ever.
---
And real life for that matter
---
Hey mate, Did you know Dreddit is recruiting? We are a larger corp part of Test alliance. We almost strictly operate in null security space and have some of the best infrastructure for industry pilots.

PVE and PVP experiences are not mutually exclusive. This game might be PVP focused, but PVE is the bread and butter of wealth creation, and it's a disgrace that the content was largely the same for the last decade without adapting to capitals. It's like when player gear got exponentially better but the content stayed the same in traditional MMOs. No way it's engaging in any way.
---
That said, the original commenter's point stands. The OP was arguing that we need to shut up about the changes even if we don't like it, because we would "lose" fighting it. Like hell I will. It's a game --- if I don't like the changes, I will quit and get nostalgic about how good it was before the changes. I don't care if I lose or if OP "wins", because I won't let a bunch of faceless nerds on the internet dictate my game choice. There are other good games, and yes other good MMOs out there.
---
I fully support this call. Anyone who can afford to pay for titans can afford the loss and should be wary of the risk when deploying them.
---
Yes. But I noted it there without heat and against EMP and not uniform. We're talking about the same fit here except that you use T2 rigs and heat. The point above was that you need a good bunch of machariels to volley such a Falcon so I low balled without heat and with the worst projectile ammo.
---
every time someone brings this up they forget the obvious counter and we do it all the time already, the umbrella will simply moving with krabs as they follow the resources.
---
you got downvoted for telling the truth
---
that’s sad
---
I know, but my guess is Human’s are lazy. They won’t want to move constantly. So instead of locust, you’ll get sprawl. Tho probably both, some will stay in safety, some will just be lazy.
---
Massive capital nerfs (incl not allowing capitals to animals), lower PVE payout, delet rorq, and just complain about null blocs in general. There might be elements of truth to any of those solutions but the proposer is likely to have it overboard, desperate to somehow "shake things up".
---
Your idea implemented will result in income decrease for CCP.  
---
Thus, it will never be implemented.
---
Worked like a charm. Thanks.
---
Did that, worked wonderfully.
---
Yeah I remember it was a pain in the butt when I changed up my setup. haha
---
if they actually implement resource depletion what will there be to sprawl for? The locust will strip systems FORCING the other krabs to move with them. Your desired change will force the krabs to move with the umbrella.
---
TVP?
---
Eve doesn't have an 'end game' and that mentality is why injectors are such a problem.
---
Fite me.
---
Wonder how he feels about these cyno changes.
---
Yikes, that's quite a clonegrade-esq penalty you have going there. Is the neurotoxic detox bay an Upwell service module or a rested state bonus for docking overnight in player structures? It might generate some juicy killmails if what you're going for is pushing the skill farmers out of NPC stations and into player dedicated operations for the detox 'sleep' process to take full effect.
---
A few days. I don't know for sure, but the Trigs should be gone before too long. If you absolutely have to go through before they leave, there are some precautions you can take.
---
First is tanking the hell out of your ship. A T1 Scythe or Moa with decent shield modules can handle the incoming fire from a basic Trig gate camp fleet in the time it takes to align and accelerate to warp, so that's a decent benchmark if you need to fly through gate to gate.
---
Another option is cloaking if you're Omega. Drop a cloak into one of your high slots and throw the regular module in your hold. Use the Align command instead of Jump and activate your cloak on the next server tick (one second) after the Align command. That way you can afford to stay cloaked until they warp off-grid or get distracted by another traveler. Or of course if your acceleration is decent it just lets you align in peace, so they won't be able to target you between uncloaking and hitting warp. (Even better is covert ops cloak. You can use the Jump command as normal and don't have to worry about playing with other commands or waiting for a clear window.)
---
As far as going to stations goes, there's not much I can help with in that regard. However, it may be worth your time to setup an "instant undock" bookmark outside of a station that you need to frequent. To do that, simply maintain the course set as default when you undock from the station and go 100km (I think) or more from the station. Set up a bookmark there and have your People &amp; Places window open whenever you undock from that station so that you can warp directly to that point without waiting for an align time (since you're already aligned from undock) and then you can warp along your route as normal.
---
How do you know when a WH will be closed?
---
The more space you take, the more spread out your forces are and the longer the whole coalitions response time will be. Which means more chances for smaller entities to aggress on you.
---
If you instead choose to just move the umbrella, that means more move ops, more costs and more stragglers to hunt. Move ops can also be vulnerable outside of the main blob.
---
The only downside I see is that there would be vast swathes of space unused for a while. Maybe rotating different resources instead of straight up deplete? Rotate from rats-&gt;minerals-&gt;exploration-&gt;incursion etc to encourage more playstyles than just one. Means pilots who want to stay put need to do more activities than just one, so they're more vulnerable/also learn more about the games mechanics. And the pilots who want to do only one thing are forced to move and thus increase vulnerability.
---
This isn't really a rework, it's basically a complete destruction of injectors.
---
i joined a corp and got lucky with the locals of kourmonen and joined  Did he say jump, its been a blast these last 30 days in eve and with the corp.
---
cant say the changes affect me much  though
---
Drones are cheating?
---
You say this, but people still rat in provi.
---
Fuel for ships would be worse
---
I can easily get over 100K ehp tank on 3 out of 4 racial force recon ships.
---
Cold. No links. No implants.
---
If you need more EHP than that on a cruiser to light a cyno, and survive long enough for your fellow nerds to show up, then you are clearly doing something wrong.
---
I am all in favor of your first three bullet points, but the last one is just bad. Do you really think Eve was better when the meta encouraged unlimited AFK ice mining in highsec? Or level IV/V missions in highsec? Or Incursion alts? Or Crabhole alts? So many changes over the years were designed to get players to populate the less populated parts of the game. To draw them away from the “dead end starting area.” To get them engaged in player groups (because it’s bonds between players that retains players). Now that the players finally did that, you want to herd them back to places where it is harder to interact with them? 
---
I love Blackout because it shakes up the meta, but we shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bath water. We still want vibrant groups in 0.0 after these changes. We don’t want people to move to highsec, get bored, and quit.
---
And another thing, when friends quit, that’s one less tie to the game. Each old friend who leaves my corporation is one less reason for me to play this game. I still miss friends who quit over Phoebe. It takes a while to build trust and and find new friends. There are a handful of people in my corporation and 2-3 players in my alliance who constitute 80% of the reason I still play Eve. The other 20% is sunk cost fallacy. 
---
Too often over the years CCP has made changes that discourage playing Eve and increase tedium (e.g. jump fatigue timers, stupidly long reinforcement timers, asset safety with its long timers, etc). It’s good to make Eve more dangerous across the board. But CCP frequently responds to complaints about tedium with HTFU!
---
CCP needs to remove as many time barriers to content as possible. Get completely rid of jump fatigue. Shorten citadel timers significantly (24-48 hours max from initial attack to explosion, depending on power level and structure size). Give people reasons to want to play all the time. Not everyone can, but people not playing should know they are missing out on something fun. The best choice should never be “ping for max dudes then go play another game for seven days while we wait for more content.”
---
But then you'll cry again when the drifters return.
---
The issue with those ships lies in the slot layout.  
---
For the Probe/Imicus you could either strap the TD fit on it, but since it has -1 mid you would have to drop a TD, and the extra low slot does not offer nearly sufficient compensation for the loss of the TD. All out brawling is also sort of questionable with them, and you would simply want to use the double or triple MASB Heron for brawling any way.  
---
The Magnate can be turned into a rather downgraded version of a dualrep Incursus that deals 120 dps and tanks 100 in return.  That is simply insufficient against anything that isn´t a ramboi ceptor or a ramjag.
---
okay, now you asking too much
---
It's not hard to plex multiple accounts.
---
What are you even talking about. What utter nonsense
---
What is about real counter play? Like giving us a highslot modul #anticyno that is "jamming" the cyno? (when active all cynos in range will get jammed, noone can jump to em! (maybe using fuel too) , but than it is not like now when botting umbrella empires don´t even know where to throw their iskies and don´t mind to use recons? 
---
BTW my idea doesn´t need an extra account that might be the issue!
---
You make some awesome points. But to play devil's advocate,
---
&gt;  but also don't ever fly what you can't be willing to lose.
---
Breaking this rule is a great way to add excitement to every encounter. My number one temptation right now is to liquidate all of my assets and fly one really expensive blinged-out ship for as long as I can, doing as much crazy shit as I can, until it explodes or I earn enough ISK back to trade it in for something even more expensive.
---
But I probably won't do that. Instead, I've been building the ships I want to fly by mining for all the needed resources myself, or at least procuring the minerals for cheaper than buying the hull would be. By building my ships instead of buying them, I've been able to add a bit of that excitement and thrill at the prospect of loss without actually putting my entire net worth on the line every time I undock. But that's just one lunatic opinion. I've already gone spacemad from years of exploring in Elite, so my idea of fun is way different than everyone else's.
---
some times you just want to watch the world burn
---
Blackout + Cyno Restrictions is going to be too much.  Blackout was chaos, trig invasions were chaos, cyno restrictions aren't chaos its just cutting the legs out from under capital pilots.
---
I'm calling it now CCP knows that this won't revitalize their game just looking at the tranquility stats shows as much peak numbers on Sunday have dipped every week for the last month.  This is a move to give them ammunition for taking the game in a more forgiving direction they ramp up the chaos people leave because they don't want the chaos and CCP comes out does some hand wringing announces reversion of the changes makes the game more forgiving and Pearl Abyss goes away happy.
---
Only Titans.
---
I've heard that joining FW causes you to leave your current corporation, but I haven't looked yet personally. Could a CEO sign up his corporation for FW if all members are onboard with it?
---
...What is your point?
---
Do you think they did it without Local too?
---
&gt; every suggestion I see includes 'have an alt'.
---
If you were moving capitals before, how did you do it without an alt?
---
To post this here is like showing us your shitty pants.... i don´t like shitty pants the same way i don´t like ppl shittalking others for being honorable!
---
Consider a full (255 people) fleet of nerds in capitals/supers.
---
The cyno changes affect what percentage of ships in the fleet? 
---
0.4%
---
Sweet fuckall. 99.6% of the fleet remains the same. 
---
If this change doesn't work, you can guess what will change next. It'll be a stupid economic change that hurts small groups but allows large groups to pay the costs in advance with preparation.
---
&gt; Even if you lock it up and start repping it before it lights it will probably still get alpha-ed.
---
You could try lighting the cyno off grid.
---
Maybe even doing multiple off grid so the sabres don't know who to bubble
---
You'll need a 24/7 network of stealth ships near all stargates. Make your new kids run guard duty and pay them for reporting intruders in realtime.
---
&gt; I would like to ask you for an estimate of how long a recon will live when next to a hostile fleet
---
Maybe you shouldn't be lighting cynos right next to a hostile fleet then?
---
It certainly feels bizarre to see years and years of bad design completely "wiped clean" by removing local.
---
I'm sure there is an important lesson about human psychology and sociology here. It doesn't matter how much you abuse someone, if you're being really nice to them *once*, then everything is forgiven.
---
&gt; That's just a bizzare feat of logic. How is the FC saying "right i need 5 people to switch out of DPS into a recon- , your job in this fleet is to light a cyno and then quickly die,", good for fleet combat? It's not like you would bring a recon to a big mach brawl for any other reason, it doesn't have the tank.
---
This doesn't already happen for dics and hics?
---
I'm not a bitter vet or even a vet (2012 start). Was thinking about eve lately and after seeing some of the changes I decided to download it again after a two plus year hiatus. They sound interesting and all the tears of nullbears is always a pro in my book.
---
&gt; Wasn't null space DESIGNED to be conquered, protected and exploited just as TEST and GSF do? Aren't most of these empires successful due to an immense network of players and player built and maintained infrastructure? If so, isn't that kinda the point?
---
Yeah, but you're missing the part about where despite all of that, those null players should line up to donate their gains to the killboard of every lowsec idiot that spent a month training into a bomber.
---
Long story short, you don’t, there are indicators (right click, show info gives you the stage it’s in, “probably won’t last another day” is a normal hole, “reaching the end of its lifespan means it’s eol and has 4 hours or less (ish, it can be buggy), additionally, as a Hole gets closer and closer to dying it gets more “wobbly” and visually unstable) but in the end unless you spawned it there’s no 100% sure way to know.
---
Hell, it's clear that in some of these, what jumps to the cyno is just other ratting supers first and foremost.
---
Drake is slow as shit for L4s
---
As much as I don't like aggressive super-powered NPCs in highsec, if you want ISK you shouldn't be mining.
---
&gt; he ALREADY BROKE NDA
---
Citation needed.
---
He represents me.
---
This is not how representative democracies work.
---
Each individual representative is not in place to represent ALL of the people. They are there to represent those people that voted for them.
---
Vespas are mediums, you should be using drones as big or smaller than the enemy you're fighting.
---
Started right at the beginning of blackout and joined horde in null. I still forget to check local because I'm used to not seeing anyone in local. Accidentally kicked myself when I joined FW. Didn't realize I'd be ejected from my corp. Got ganked by pirates and asked to join them which has been a blessing. Small gang pvp is more my style.
---
I don't intend on flying caps anytime soon so idc about cyno changes. I like that null has no local. 
---
One point I would like to bring up is skill injectors. I would have quick within the first week without them. Putting around in a t1 frig just ain't as fun as being able to skill into all types. I've gotten to fly logis, gas huffers, porpoises, and Gilas. Having to wait the 3-6 months to do any of that would have me going to another game. So far I'm having a blast!
---
I'm not great at market stuff, but why has the volume spiked very recently? I assume that's due to the cyno change announcement but I cant imagine that many idiots bought the wrong recons. Is there something else I'm missing?
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
This is pretty good.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism
---
&gt;  I'm not making it back mining. 
---
That's because mining isn't profitable except in 10 rorquals.
---
&gt; Well thats 50 million isk wasted".
---
It's more late gate than 50m ships
---
Interesting thought. Im all for generating juicy killmails.
---
Noob question, what do you mean by late gate?
---
Wasted too much money and time. Too new to get into a big alliance.
---
The blackout,  combat recon don't show on dscan
---
yea it happens to the best of us
---
&gt; other pilots for your ships to bring to new staging is one of the worst experiences in the game.
---
You could just buy ships in the new staging.
---
Please elaborate - my sleep deprived mind does not follow you :)
---
Ideally i would like fewer capitals and that they are lost more often with then still holding a military importance. In my mind though - they should not be able to apply to frigates - or at least only being able to do so while limitong the engagement profile. I think current fleet doctrines are boring.
---
3-4 roles tip (what i've seen).
---
For me a beautiful battle would include ships of roughly all classes and sizes
---
Because wormhole trash has such relevance on how null sec should work right ? When was the last time you wanted to have a cap fight' with more than 15 people?
---
My feelings exactly.
---
I do see and understand your point, but the genie is out of the bottle. CCP says consistently "We are going to keep a watchful eye on the effects these changes have on the game" and we rarely see balance passes made. I think limiting the amount of injectors used in a calendar year is a good start.
---
Excavators shouldn't exist and anomaly spawns need another dozen nerfs. Capitals should never have been permitted into anomalies.
---
Just stop being poor.
---
\*sadface\*
---
Idea isn\`t half bad but as someone said this is an ALLIANCE chat in a nutshell.  "To make them feel less lonely" - Bullshit, get in your discord/mumble/TS and jump to whatever room with people (standing fleet for example) and you already not lonely (sounds of conversation or/and any other abuse of 2$ mic are typical indicators of you not being lonely already).  
---
Nobody was safe with local chat and not going to be safe without it:  
---
\- Random wormholes and a bunch of people appearing in your K-space looking to kill something.  
---
\- Logged off ships (we had Vendetta and two aeons logged out, they successfully killed solo-afk rattlesnakes, carriers and bunch of other stuff in between to no end)...  
---
\- Random error that caused your ship to go boom at the ratting site thanks to game code being too perfect (nerf this!) and now you need to petition CCP for replacement.  
---
\- Claw gangs in numbers 40 and more that can ambush you pretty quickly and you won\`t stop them in time.  
---
\- Typical responce time of standing fleet is not instant and if you are 4 or more jumps away chances are that you going to visit zkill are rising exponentially.  
---
\--- and few other ways that are a wee bit more complicated but doable.
---
Entire blackout thing is more of cherry on top of numerous ways your ship can get killed within the comfy blanket of your alliance\`s region. This makes it exciting to hunt randoms in their blingy fits (also their belief in standing fleet) and becomes interesting quest for epic loot.
---
Eve is a virtual wallet simulator and spaceship collector game
---
with 100 you might be better off mid-alphabet
---
Best time to start.  CCP is blowing up the meta, and everyone is learning new shit.
---
Just read the info message. See here: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes#Life
---
In a frig you will be very safe and get into every wormhole easily. There are plenty of sites in empty wormhole (class 5,6) and if you warp into a data/relic site and there are npcs, then warp out. Usually they are empty.
---
If you access Wormholes from high sec, there is usually more traffic - so be careful. Just entry the wormhole, scan down the nexts wormholes and check them for sites to do. Do it in an t1 frig to learn the hacking and scanning, and it doesnt matter if you die than. Its pretty easy, but you have to get used to it.
---
Been playing for about 7 months, came to try Eve when WOW got old. I fell in love with the game and got addicted HARDCORE, prob played four hours a day at least six days a week. Started in HS doing Incursions/exploring and now I live in nullsec. I love the roleplay aspect of carving out a piece of wild space and having to protect it/be your own Concord. I love HAVING to cooperate with other real players to succeed, it's what WOW has lacked for so so long. The blackout was a difficult adjustment but had plenty of good to make up for the constant ganking of my mining barges and small ratting ships. I don't have a high skill alt so having a recon for cyno isn't an option and I do feel like I'm drowning a bit. I have REALLY enjoyed flying my carrier between roams and fleet fights, for whatever reason it really tickled my space ship fantasy, fighters are so fun! I'm pretty sad I won't be able to call for help in it now and it's kinda broken my addiction in a sad way. I worry the super increased risk will outweigh the 3 weeks or so of hard ratting/mining it would take to replace. Sorry for lengthy post I guess.
---
"accidentally" ~~delete~~ permaban goonswarm leadership for imperium monetisation efforts

---
Because CCP are really promoting conflict drivers with these changes right ?
---
Sorry, the second to last blue bar on the far right, within the last few days.
---
I’ve been enjoying the dank excavator kills. I also realize that This isn’t going to last. once people begin risk evaluation, they’ll  put away their big toys and log in their Incursion alts. Null will begin to resemble wormhole space.
---
Not according to Reddit.
---
I was thinking of getting into this since I like exploration. Do you need a covert ops frigate? I've always assumed if you went in there with a T1 exploration frigate you would become a free kill for the first person you ran into.
---
you are unbelievably salty lately for a person that "doesnt get affected by the changes that much". Calm your tits, hunting reserves are fine, people will still rat mine and eat shit to the hunters. Perhaps more people will shift their attention to the most dense regions like delve or esoteria
---
Open the launcher, launch your account and while immediately when it creates the game window, disconnect your wifi so that you don't land on the Alt-selection window, but the blue space 'lost connection window'. Re-connect wi-fi and click on the connect button. This worked for me when experiencing your issue. Which I have had going on a week now.
---
Why do you think instant teleport that essentially doesn't have a counter is a good mechanic?

&gt;If response fleets continue to blap those that hunt the capital krabs what is the next call for change?
---
Nothing? They got outplayed or outgunned. Eve is a sandbox and when you're in a sandbox, two kids with giant shovels will be able to build and destroy faster than the one kid with a trowel.
---
The single kid will never be able to compete without getting a partner and a bigger shovel. Beyond that, their only other option is to get their parents to chaperone and create new rules so everything is "fairer" despite having an obvious disadvantage in how he plays in the sandbox with the other kids.
---
Eve was a sandbox lmao
---
Pearl Abyss expects their investment back.
---
The problem isn't how to fix injectors. The problem is CCP doesn't seem to want to.
---
Buy friends by tipping your Orca booster.
---
High SP count makes the toon more flexible, not necessarily better at a given task. And if you don't need level V's everywhere, you only need 20% of the training time for IV's. Back when injectors were not in game, it took maybe couple months to train a new fleet doctrine if you already had the core/support skills, which you usually did since you had been flying the earlier doctrines.
---
I started in 2007 and after the first maybe 6 months I never felt like I had to wait long to train skills for anything.
---
Tell us some more about the time you had the challenge of learning what timezones are
---
Care to share example fits?
---
Yes it fucking well does.   We built it, you want to tear it down with dumfuck ideas and bombers.  Risk Aversity is your mantra, embrace it.  You want to kill supers with frigates.
---
Why would CCP want to do this?
---
yes, that's the point.
---
and no, you can still do it.
---
Faction warfare. Amarr has went from constantly going t5 to sitting at low t4 about to hit t3 soon.
---
mistype. Late Game*
---
As in, when you only are flying 50m ships at best, the invasion content is not meant to be accessible to you.
---
Every day.
---
Nullsec affects everyone, especially people that fly out there.
---
That's something I like to do.
---
So how are my views not relevant?
---
yikes, Mr. Strawman over here.
---
1. I don't think it is.
---
2. Why do you think I think it is?
---
Subcaps die to roamers quite frequently. You're better off doing missions in high sec. Getting into a carrier really wasn't bad advice it just didn't age well. CCP have no idea what they're doing. We're sharing a portion of the profit when we moon mine as a corp to some of the new guys because it sucks dick to not be in a Rorqual right now.
---
I hate capitals too. But that's what CCP wanted and now they're desperately trying to undo their mistake. But people are too busy pointing fingers at Goons while CCP takes all the credit. Blame CCP for everything wrong with the game.
---
It was more of a loaded question if anything, but it was fair given the context.
---
What is the counter to a cyno? (cyno inhib takes time to anchor so it is not a counter).
---
Because you want to weaken the nerf. This gets us closer to the status quo.
---
Mandatory Flying License for each ship, with theory test and practice test after minimum of 10 hours lessons with a certified instructor.
---
Then mandatory skin 'A' for one year when flying the ship.
---
&gt; Riot Rick supporting my commentary  
---
LOL we may not have been on the same side, but our mining alliance tried our best to fight.  :)
---
&gt; Random question - did you find that defending your krabs took more skill and effort than hunting and dropping krabs? I have. It seems much more challenging to be on the defender's side imho.
---
I agree here -- when it's against skillful hunters or enemy CTA fleets that you weren't aware of. 
---
Small gang you can take care of easily, but real hunters that know how to utilize inhibs and other weaknesses, it's tough for home defense fleets. Even [good Imperium alliances with good FCs and response fleets get wrecked often by surprise blobs.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004583/201908160200/) How much more for the little guys, small to medium alliances that are not under coalition umbrellas.
---
On the hunting side, it's "easy" once you find the prey. But that's the struggle now with the blackout -- it's taking a long time to find the Rorqs by small to medium alliances because the intel isn't there for them. In the past, I'd ping for WH scans and get a bunch of targets within an hour or two and kill Rorqs with 20-30 Naga/Talos fleet. Now, null is just empty except in pockets where 20-30 battlecruisers will just get boson'd by titan defense fleets. 
---
Instead of a constant blackout, have temporary unannounced blackouts once per month and increase VL WH's null to null and null to low. I think that would be pretty amazing. More things to hunt, and more medium to large scale fleet fights.
---
hic's have a large tank if you can get the bubble or point down in time its very likly you can get court  by rep's .   
---
dic's bubble burn off cloak relying on not getting hit in the first place.  
---
recon with cyno's just will die
---
The problem with changing cynos in this way is whoever drops a dread first essentially controls the grid. Anything that tries to pop a cyno in range is going to die immediately. So basically whoever escalates first holds the grid. Whoever escalates in retaliation will have to drop the cyno somewhere. I'm all for cyno changes and there are a lot of good ideas out there given by the community but CCP have chosen to go for the one that fucks capital warfare even more.
---
With the Cyno changes, I see this happening much less now.
---
Yeah but we could see the danger incoming. If a sub gets tackled now there isn't even any point in forming.
---
What
---
Even without concord, isn't the passive shield repping of a Nestor enough to counter a frigate?
---
Doesn’t mean that CCP won’t do it
---
The best time you could wish for
---
Windowed or fullscreen?
---
in this shit case, CODE dudes are better than Damavs, they at least check if you are afk or have mining permit. \*face palm\*
---
dude
---
Ooo, I had forgotten about the fact that injectors reduce the cost of having an omega account by around 90% if you don't need to train anything on it. So you can have 10 times as many cloaky campers or whatever non-training alts as before for the same cost.
---
We are pretty self sufficient here in Delve, so your trade embargo idea wont really do much
---
Did you just make up a stat? 
---
.4 of 255 is kinda 1 right?
---
Which 1 ship in a fleet does this change affect?
---
P2W needs a legion of smoothbrain scrubs that make it work properly.
---
EvE has the smoothbrains but not the critical mass required to sustain their numbers, hence the repeated nerfing of money making activities
---
That’s a solution! Why care about something when you can simply let others take all the effort and simply use  the result?
---
Please don't live in hisec!
---
Good for you. Personally I could never make myself care about cheap ships be it killing it or losing. It’s just so insignificant...
---
Have you ever played Eve?
---
Seen people throw Rattlesnakes at it.
---
I'm not german and I think I get what you're saying. When I read something in my native language it's like text suddenly gains +50% to being taken seriously, and at that point you start realizing how sad the entire thing can be.
---
Loose Lips
---
Sink Ships
---
I started winning Eve around two-three years ago when my second kid was born. Getting back into it now, and these changes look like they'll stir things up (which helps prevent it from getting stale).
---
True. To be fair, it's not like they tell you this stuff in game. I had just finished the sisters of eve 52 mission arc.. so see a bunch of red enemies didn't appear too much of a threat until.. it definitely was. New players want to 'contribute' and fight things off too. 
---
I was flying a gila with a fairy good fitting for my level. 136m isk investment right there!
---
I started about a month before the blackout started. I really love the idea of the era of chaos. 
---
I was living solo in null doing exploration for a bit and have recently moved to wormholes with a PvP corp. 
---
I love the blackout, null should be dark, dangerous and anxiety inducing. The blackout forced me to stay on my toes and to actually navigate through space: Its not just a case of check local and then warp to gate anymore. I have to use the probe scanner map to go to a celestial within dscan range of the outgate and manually check that there's not people sitting there. When probing stuff down, I need to make sure I'm able to cover the in or out gate so I can see what jumps into the system. 
---
Basically it's made space feel much more dangerous and forces you to play in a more cautious manner and to make strategic and tactical choices about how to get around and not get popped. 
---
I think there is a lot of room to improve the mechanics of dscan etc to make them more engaging though.
---
The cyno changes I have no real opinion on other than it makes sense that something that is functionally so powerful (being able to move fleets instantly across big distances to any point in any system in range is the highest utility ability in the game by far..) that it shouldnt be easy, cheap or routine to deploy them. 
---
So, in summary, I'm very positive about it.
---
elo 牛逼！
---
WC 牛逼！
---
WC energy increased
---
I think current cloaky ships provide more chaos than any balance we are discussing here.
---
Having a sabre decloak next to you is a fright you never get anywhere else.
---
wow i really liked this video good fight
---
Maybe lowering the distance from Stain+Fountain to Delve so that Caps/Blops can jump would be good, Delve is too isolated. 
---
But please no Supergates that connect the north/south and east/west ends oft the map. Would only help the Superpowers even more to project their overwhelming force, and having parts of space "far out" and not much traveled is a much needed variation to "get everywhere" with 10 jumps. Also Wormholes exist to cross the map really fast ;)
---
My corp doesn't have a lot of capitals (and we're strongly encouraged not to talk about them), so the cyno change is pretty much nothing but beneficial. Makes it harder to overescalate on us.
---
Not in SovNull, didn't experience Drifters.
---
Triglavians are the most enjoyable High-Sec PVE I've done. Haven't done them alone. Haven't done incursions, can't compare.
---
Recon Damaviks seem like they'll disrupt AFK mining, one of my primary income streams.
---
Barely did any Null stuff before blackout, but I've been on some fun roams in and out of corp.
---
Everything is a free kill in a wormhole, just like in null sec. The scanning is easier in covops frigates, because they have bonuses and you can move around cloaked. But for the hacking you need to approach containers and lock them, which means you have to be decloaked. If someone happens to find you while you do that they can obviously see you and if in a combat ship attack you.
---
You have no idea how much CRPG crowd values "shiny stuff".
---
Untill you get evicted and loose everything :D
---
Remove asset safety from null then we talk
---
and you also immediatly would take from this 'useful complete data' that blackout and cyno changes are bad? 
---
sorry, but, if its confirmed numbers are down because of these changes, the game is loosing those players who
---
* cant be bothered for a challenge
---
* weak minded
---
* easy mode only
---
* probably players who joined in the last 2years or less im sure (now thats a stat id like to know lol)
---
* carebears/Krabbers (who just krab and do minimal required to stay in 
---
It is also not exactly fair stat unless its compared to the last year at this time, and the year before. you cant just compare it to last month and expect a good result, just saying.
---
Admittedly, there are some impactful things around these days that weren't there in '03.
---
Lovin' the Melbourne Bounce track in there.
---
&gt;I've always assumed if you went in there with a T1 exploration frigate you would become a free kill for the first person you ran into.
---
This is true, but there are few enough people that you're going to make vastly more than enough to make up for lost ships. Same thing if you go in a Venture looking for gas.
---
Just got me thinking, what if a cyno can be neuted out? Caps being moved can neut the recon cyno after landing in system so the expensive ship isn’t stuck there for the full duration. Obviously can be used in combat scenarios as well!
---
Are there tickets available for when you meet him at fanfest?
---
The one with that's lights the cyno...
---
yeah  pretty much this
---
cyno ceptors? you realize they cant light the cyno, or fit it after these changes hit?
---
I personally do not like this idea however I am sure it would be liked by many others and has some good intentions.
---
You only need to buy doctrine ships once....
---
Same for nullification and cloacks. Totally agree, but you cannot solve issues without fixing what caused them.
---
Shut up odell
---
yeah the whole shittalking and everything
---
&gt;They were PL alliance directors and NC head FC's
---
Probably WAFFLES.
---
and this saves a tackled super how?
---
'oh he can just jump away, well they could do that now, but get caught daily accross new eden.
---
That sounds much better than what we have now
---
11th region alltime? 11th, how many regions above that, 10. 10 fucking regions above that xD
---
i mean, theres been a couple of nice wars for provi, and provi get hunted less than they did before.
---
provi was a good place for solo pvpers once upon a time. it does not make CVA or ProviBloc specificly not cearbears. 
---
provibloc and goonswarm share quite a few traits and morals actually. in fighting both of them they act the same way, whereas other entitys choose to act a little more, ballsey? if thats the right word im loking for im unsure.
---
Oh man, I have seen the effects of having a T3C seeded in an indy hole.
---
You can roll as many holes as you like, just the problem is that the Proteus is in you hole. Waiting for that covetor to pop up on D-scan.
---
So?
---
yeah we should remove all the pve from the game, heh worthless krabs creating every single item i use every single day. /s
---
haha gret sutff mate!   
---
you'e also killed the only active tanked sabre in the wild i think
---
Would you say that your current home region is 100% devoid of neutrals at all times? Even you are out safely ratting?
---
There will always be neutrals in Region chat. Spikes might scare people, but by your logic this just makes cloaky camping more powerful.
---
ignore him, he clearly has no idea what he is talking about, like 100k ehp even matters if you are bringing in your super cap fleet to a fight or a carrier fleet to cover your subcaps.
---
Local chat made no sense to me from the start. Not just in null but everywhere. So blackout made perfect sense. 
---
Cyno changes I don't really have an opinion about. yet.
---
Ya but if I kill the recon before the titans kill me I feel better than if i killed a magnate before the titans blap me.
---
it doesn't.
---
I have already unsubbed my 3 accounts and busy moving all my stuff to low sec / high sec. I am going to play very casually from now on.
---
Any other game is more enjoyable at the moment.
---
Some of us do some just gank your balls off for fun
---
Is it really too much effort? Constellation chat already exists. It's just an optional channel like Help, or CEO, or whatever. It's been there for my entire eight year time here. 
---
It's probably nothing more than checking a box and hitting save.
---
Less players is always bad. You cant just decide whos good or bad based on your personal preference.
---
Really is that so? Im shocked that you have to compare with something comparable.
---
Your attitude is bad dude. And the changes being bad are because they are bad. It just requires some thought.
---
EVE is a social game. When you are alone, its exponentially more dangerous. PM me if you want a taste of lowsec no strings attached :)
---
ahh good, another useless suggestion from someone who doesn't have any idea how large scale capital warfare works, go on please, cyno in your caps, sub cap fleet or super into multiple locations around a system, warp them onto grid .... straight into drag or stop bubbles and then instantly die. Good job.
---
Has to include a manual piloting section where you have to click in space around a figure 8 track.
---
Not surprised given your posting habits
---
sorry, i watched just 2 fights at the beginning, my internet sux now so i am no longer able to watch the rest. Is your tactic to engage only gallente ships with the disruptors? (blasters)
---
T1 is good learn. You won't die often and when you won't loose much. You make much more money. If you feel comfortable with hacking, buy a astero.
---
What does this even mean
---
Losing the community team and stopping the o7 show was the biggest mistake. The platform bought the existing community together and added a public conduit to advertising not only for alliances and player corps but also if dealt with correctly, adding new players, giving them the "oh hey I featured in this ad for a great game". Has the reputation that CCP carries soured that by removing the platform? You can't rely on streamers to do it for you, otherwise you'll end up with people content to watch other people play, rather than getting in on the action themselves.
---
SALT refers in this case to the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.
---
Been playing off and on for many years now, only just got the skills for a carrier. No need to rush anything when there is so many options.
---
Certainly wouldn't feel lonely!
---
So it stopped at 25% shield because of bleed through?
---
The Internet is a series of tubes.
---
Because insta travel is bullshit, game breaking and creates power projection which in turn creates shitty large blue donuts. It needs to be reigned it and by the amount of whining people, and you, do it sounds like it's going to work fine... as a first step (I'm expecting way more restrictions in the future).
---
Again, don't try to somehow sound reasonable and all that. "needless restrictive" and "inquiring if there is some justification" is just empty words, you're trying to pose as being interested in an explanation, you're not. You just want it reverted.  It's a whine disguised as a reasonable post.
---
Hört, hört!
---
I never play with German-only groups. Everything sounds stupid.
---
Yeah. And our AAR generator tool is having similar issues when people paste the chat logs in.
---
It will probably be this.
---
Oh ok thanks didnt realize that I was clearing as many as I could.
---
Great bombs there :)   
---
what's the song tho ?
---
You misunderstand by what I mean when I say relevent, I dont see you shooting krabs as relevent to nullsec sorry.
---
It needs 5 month to cap your training as alpha.
---
Tho, its just need a couple weeks for you to know whether you like EVE or not.
---
Anyway, i saw people swimming in tens billions of isk as alpha trader. A veteran that on hiatus and un-sub for two years but still have isk trickling in. Some leader doesnt need to log in to manage their alliance.
---
This game has skill for the character, but your personal skill is the one that put on test here.
---
Exactly. 
---
The content will long term just vanish (honestly, it already has for huge swaths of space). What will remain will be closely guarded OPs for moon mining and such and we began all of this because of a lack of content.
---
Before faxes fleets were often cyno’d off grid or next door and then warped in to a waiting cloaked fleet member on grid.
---
no no no stop right there, you can't make feature parity for those dirty capital blobbers who spent the time and effort creating empires and capital fleets, i need to know where they all are at all times whilst they have no idea where i am otherwise its not fair. I'll have you know i spent 15- 20 mins moving some bombers into an NPC region and for that i should be rewarded by being able to kill whatever i want without any resistance.. /s
---
&gt; (cyno inhib takes time to anchor so it is not a counter).
---
Under this definition, there is no such thing as a counter.
---
So rethink that before we can have a fair discussion.
---
But mostly it sounds like you won't be satisfied until all cynos are gone. Is that fair?
---
Keep at it dude. Not everyone is angry at the new changes - a lot welcome them
---
How about, right, hear me out, this is fucking crazy, I know.
---
How about, you ready? We make caps not apply fuck all to subcaps?
---
I am going to go to ER now for this psychotic break from reality
---
Yes, but you still need them.
---
And they are a suicide role.
---
Just like interceptors as suicide tackle.
---
Why so? I know I would't go back there but high sec has its perks
---
I presume they would charge for that extra effort.
---
This complaint was about a personal amount of effort, not a collective one.
---
Rattlesnakes are much more than 50m.
---
drifters stopped the deployment to the north, you know actual content for all invovled (if one side would have actually fought instead of hiding) not the locust fleets.
---
&gt; initiate self destruct on the cyno ship, light on the final SD seconds and jump to it so the cyno is only warpable for a few seconds. 
---
I'm pretty damn sure that is not the way the cynos were intended to be lit tbh. That's just a gimmick that's currently being patched - I don't thinkyou were also ever meant to keep a bunch of "cyno alts" and the whole capital ships thing was meant to be a group effort.   
---
We  might either see a return to that or a drop in cap usage, whatever comes first i'll be super glad about it.
---
Except you don't need to wait years. RvB do great fleets in frigs, public fleets etc. The skill injectors serves those who have higher disposable income and are, who I suspect, the main or regular users of injectors. I think most new players don't spend a bunch on them. Injectors are a 2 sided coin. For CCP as a business they make perfect sense. For the game health, no.
---
Yes, this would be an issue.
---
I'm not sure how much the agency explains any of these things in regards to difficulty.
---
Welcome back. 
---
But you are stuck in narrative mode. The people complaining are actually the same ones trying to make it viable for you to have long term content. You are treating them as your enemy, as is much of the rest of this sub yet you guys fail to see that we are straight up telling you this cant work long term.
---
Which means you will have fun for a while then leave again because it will be much much worse than before.
---
You know, maybe we would be able to actually manage something if people started listening to each other instead of being edgy all the time? I know, its a strange notion, people actually hearing others.
---
I think most of the anger actually comes from players who started after the injectors were added. Most older players who fly capitals trained for years to get them and so understand the game and it’s options more
---
yes but a good dictor,  hic and cepter can survive  a long time a recon not realy
---
hmm, sounds like you want to be able to come late to the party and have the advantage....
---
its entitled casuals as far as the eye can see, but they all seem to cry the mantra HTFU when the game is just made easier and easier for them every day.
---
Then what IS relevant to nullsec?
---
Is activity in nullsec not relevant?
---
Is activity within EVE not relevant to EVEs ecosystem?
---
Or are you just a self appointed gate keeper?
---
It´s a PC I rarely use but you are right, I should do it :/
---
....french...
---
The big alliances will literally accept anyone.
---
That all depends on usage, planning, and strategy.
---
Most ships with turrets and relatively small drone bays are fair game.  Or the random Jag :P
---
Thats original, did you think of this yourself buddy?
---
and they did revisit fozziesov, so they did look at the system at least once more. and changes were made
---
i
---
the guy who has to  now fly a shitfit brick tanked BO Bs or recon instead of the super or fax that they spent time and money getting into.
---
How come it doesn't affect super ratters?
---
Sorry just so I understand you, as a new player, feel it’s safer to rat in a sieged dread then an aligned carrier?
---
is fortnite out of 100 now? i thought is was out of 60 or somthing.
---
and no one looses in fortnite, they all buy skins with thier mums creditcard and get points towards buying more each game.
---
well yeah but most uses  a recons gonna die even if done well, once that thing hits its cyno its gonna get hit hard and volleyed
---
yes because super capital fights should only happen when both side cyno in at the same time ... go back to camping a highsec exit hole and running from anything that could actually fight back.
---
Works for me.
---
looks good
---
I have thousands of every module so that doesn't mean anything. Again you show your ignorance by making assumptions about things you know nothing about. I've used them to move a load of hulls from where they were moved to after the station they were in died after I came back from a hiatus. Unlike you, the people running the gatecamp that I was running adapted and started catching them. They know how to play EVE whereas you're just a crybaby who wants the devs to change things so you don't have to adapt.
---
As far as you calling me a carebear is concerned.... boo hoo. It says more about you than it does about me. 
---
Mind you, I love the fact that you're crying your heart out on Reddit about people who can get away from you because they fit their ships specifically for that and you can't figure out how to outsmart them even though the game gives you the tools to do just that. Feel free to keep on balling your eyes out rather than adapting. Your tears taste oh so very sweet ;)
---
"it gives lowsec ppl more kills"  
---
Because killing a Cyno is PVP you need to increase.... Thats the  dumbest answere i have ever read.  
---
So we have 4 things to play with. HiSec, LowSec, NulLSec, WH\_Space.  
---
WH-Space should be the dangerous thing in the game and its getting the safest.  
---
Its not a big deal for large alliances. You will see a Rorqual Blop with 2 FAX alts and a Super sitting there to protect the Rorquals and the cloaked Cynos.  
---
Hope you LowSec ppl enjoy the new PVP Style (killing Cynos) that was given by your new CSM Member :D
---
great content though, you've been an inspiration for my bait t1 explo frigs :)
---
Except they're not on "combat" ships, are they. They're fit specifically to be moved through a gate camp, not for combat thus not combat ships. Duh.
---
keep these ideas to your self
---
:o wording!
---
Think just about everyone has a story like that. For me it was with a few green friends along with my irl friend who'd played for years on a roam, died to the very first thing we found and then ended getting lost in a wh I didn't have bookmarked. Had a nice chat with the guy whose wh it was who was trying to catch my pod. Was strange yet great fun.
---
Hope eve continues to be enjoyable for you
---
And again......not combat ships. They're fit for moving not combat.
---
And once again, there are counters to it even if you don't want to use them.
---
But yeah, keep on crying dude. Boo hoo for you.
---
Imperium News Network was supposed to be a multi-dollar media enterprise. The rebranding from CFC to Imperium was supposedly to make the name more friendly for the mainstream and potential sponsors. 
---
Imperium leadership already tried to monetize their playerbase through official sponsored deals, like that H1Z1 "The Mittani Welcome Pack" thing.
---
It's just not a place to live full time, 8ts.finenfor a month, two or 3 but most people living there long time would probably quit the game before experiencing anything more fun.
---
The fix to cloaky camping isn't local, its timer on the cloak.
---
Yes, in theory. But in reality the numbers are telling us the highest isk faucet/capita atm is WH space. Im not saying there should be some added isk, Im simply stating that if you want to reduce faucets, you begin where its the most. You know this.
---
Its not the cynos man. Its the fact that they scale well. There needs to be a cutoff. And the fact that they have infinite spawning clusters if done right. Its just too much.
---
But at the same time, 1 rorq is shitty income. You have 6b on grid locked down for 5 minutes, its already selftackled and you can easily pop it with a bomber fleet. They died in tons with cynos and now without them? The people who are just running 1-2 rorqs will vanish. The big rorq handlers will just put recons on grid.
---
But the main point is that all those 1-2 rorq runners (which are in majority) will no longer have a reason to stay in NS. The isk is like 160m/hour in 12b on grid whilst being selftackled for 5 minutes at a time in an environment where you excavs can get bombed and youre out 5-6b which is like 30-40 hours of work and no far intel to be able to cycle down the core in time to get off if need be.
---
So in reality a 2 rorq runner with miner 2s that is only making 80m/h wont stay any longer. Why so many are fireselling rorqs in sov null atm.
---
I've been looking all over New Eden and I still can't find Mankrik's wife.
---
Did someone say [Quad Giga Pulse Laser II]?
---
Anal [Nightmare]
---
"Time" and "Money".
---
Anyone else remember when 'mindmapping' was simply called 'thinking about'?
---
You shooting krabs, believe it or not has no impact on the landscape of nullsec, the people that live in null sec do. So keep your pussy footing  wormhole pvp life style to yourself thanks.
---
Hey, speaking from experience. Once the lights went out I put the rorqual away as well as the supers and logged in my incursion alts. If this is to be permanent, probably move my PI to a wormhole. Like the author of this thread stated; people will adapt and already are.
---
Trig content feels cheaply balanced. I personally have zero intention of engaging with it ever.
---
Fuck, incursions are a better use of your time because there you actually make decent isk/hr and you don't have your profit bled dry by risk-free ninja salvaging.
---
a low-sec gate to stain
---
love it. I have like 100 kms with nereus. Be the bait noone excepts!
---
Literally they're making me consider quitting. I played for a bit about a year ago when it first went free to play but burned out simply because of real life responsibilities.
---
I come back, try to start a new game, get way further than I did the first time by going through all the career agents...and can't even break even with any investment before it gets killed in three shots by these damn aliens.
---
Hell, I tried to go ratting for the first time ever...Nope! Instead, I lose my ship instantly.
---
I literally cannot go anywhere without dying to them and if CCP think that sitting and staring at a screen waiting for them to pop up while I'm mining is fun or engaging then they're sick in the head.
---
Osmon -&gt; Every single ice asteroid had an orca on it.
---
Every day I move closer to CODE.
---
lmfao @ europeans
---
Well they tested this idea against init during briscgate. I
---
I have gotten great BPCs from them, Zegumas, polarized weapons etc, datacores.
---
You can't mine more than 1tn in ratting and mining per Region.
---
Watch the chaos then.
---
No injectors are NOT the cause of the problem. It just sped up the time until we reached the problematic state.
---
I'd put them on command ships and maybe the monitor. Cover ups cyno ships seem fucking silly to me.
---
Yes, of course they want to make money. But if more people buy plex to sell, there will be more offer than demand (all those people quitting with their 50 rorqs and less people using isk to buy plex) and the price will lower.
---
It just needs to get the ships in and then it has done its job.
---
It doesn't need to survive.
---
How is any of that in any way deserving a perma? Also I'm sorry I skipped h1z1 now as I'd love to offer Mittens' regards to things I was shooting.
---
&gt; yes because super capital fights should only happen when both side cyno in at the same time 
---
All the best ones do. B-R5RB only really happened because both sides cyno'd in at the same time.
---
But oh no, complain more about your opponents ability to counter your win-button.
---
fucking obliterated. 
---
This was awesome!
---
So I'm not allowed to create a Sansha's Nation corp and hang around incursion sites trying to get trigger-happy morons with their safeties off to CONCORD their blingy battleship's?
---
so its basically forced on a alt because no person whats to be the guy that hits a button and die's
---
&gt; You shooting krabs, believe it or not has no impact on the landscape of nullsec, the people that live in null sec do. 
---
Then none of these changes making nullsec more dangerous matter to the landscape of nullsec.
---
So what are you here complaining about?
---
Was it ever something done by anyone other than an alt?
---
So your argument is that cynos should be indestructible because that's more fun?
---
No counterplay?
---
You can jump your caps with only one account: you ask a friend to light the cyno for you.
---
Not that you've stated it, but your post is a complaint about needing two accounts to jump without help from others. 
---
A jump as an individual person behind the keyboard. You feel entitled to be able to navigate without involving other people.
---
You also think everyone does, or at least should, feel the same way you do.
---
You are **not** entitled to that. The entire point is to have friends. Why should the luxury of being able to circumvent the geography of space be something you get with only one account?
---
-You have an option to directly use skill injector on ur alt.
---
-You have an option to use this mechanics. 
---
While skill injectors don't have any drawbacks or conditions except current sp level of user, this thing have. 
---
Therefore this is more reliable to use skill injector on your alt. 
---
When this is said go to main part:
---
-you can give 6 skip injectors to a rookie who promised to participate in some CTA or smth.
---
-you can sign a contract with him on same amount of sp as 6 injectors
---
In 2nd option you can have something back if rookie decides he don't like your corp or something else.
---
YeH you are right effort shouldn't be rewarded in video games, we should all fly the exact same shit fit rifter, that's the only way that everyone can have fun, go play fortnite.
---
With that I can agree mostly. So more a if the day to day seems too dull come give LS/NS/Wh space a try over don't live in HS. 
---
That said I knew a few miners and missioners who'd been only in HS for ages and were quite content there
---
Uh, I am 99% sure that the permaban comment is a joke. 
---
And before you go "it's hard to tell because you can't convey tone over text", it really isn't. The way that it's written makes it pretty clear.
---
If you're stupid enough to believe that shit you've just written then more fool you.
---
To be fair English is one of the absolute worst languages for all its damn exceptions to rules of grammar and spelling. Not to mention blending of French and Germanic root syntax and vocabulary.
---
You're an idiot ok.
---
It's never too late to join the fun my friend.
---
Just make sure to find a corp, go to the in game recruitement channel and ask for something.
---
You dont just drop 5-15 supers man. Any alliance has a system in place that has been worked out in advance, the umbrella. You see 5-15 but in order to ensure those dont get dreadbombed to shit you need much more things working in the background. It is very much planning things. 
---
I get that, which is why small gang shouldnt need to go to NS to find content. Its not good for you, its not good for us. Its simply a mismatch. 
---
You can certainly get outdropped. Thats what dreadbombs are for and its happened more times than I can count. Yes and NPC space allows for range into a lot of systems. Which is why its actually null that wants NPC space to exist in all sov space, yet another thing CCP hasnt done. 
---
I cant speak for the rest of the game. I dunno where youve been and so on. But I can say this, you will never get what you want in NS. Thats built for scale and no matter what you do youre still seldomly gonna feel fulfilled after a NS roam. Nothing is gonna change this fact.
---
The people at fault arent the small gang but neither NS even though we are currently the villains in this saga. Its CCP. Why would you have to go to NS to fight underpowered, underleveled and undermanned in order to get content? Its like PvP in any other game, it wont be fun if you have to face off against people with higher levels and gear that just stomp you every time.
---
But thats because there is no bracket mechanic in Eve. Small gang should stick to LS and WHs in my opinion. There should be mechanics in place so that LS isnt broken and actually have people living in it so theres content. Its just a question of scale, the wants and needs of a 10 man fleet isnt the same as the 256 man fleet. 
---
Look at it like this, its like youre walking down the street and seeing a normal sized person trying to fight a giant. Would you tell the normal sized guy that he should continue or just tell him to fight someone his own size? Or would you try to cut of the legs of the giants so his size is more manageable?
---
These changes are the latter and in my mind its just crazy. The giant is still gonna be stronger and the fight is never going to be even no matter. But now the giant has to fight impeded against other impeded giants. Which means no one will be happy in the end. 
---
Thats why its bad game design, instead of actually taking the time to add things they just start cutting cause its cheaper and easier for them. But it wont fix anything in the long term, it will only ensure that the maximum number of people will be unhappy. In a game they play for fun.
---
all th best ones .... name one? in fact don't bother because not a single massive super fight every occurred with both sides coming in at the same time, b-r was staggered and with recons as the cyno ship it wouldnt have happened at all.
---
So you would make an awox alt, give him enough sp to fly a hictor or dictor, awox a super, then say he's been bad and retract that same sp without penalties to be used on a new alt, like that?
---
If you join as a pilot you fall into the Faction's NPC Militia Corp, but you can also join as a corporation and nothing changes.
---
While I don't completely disagree with you:    
---
&gt;  it is a bit ridiculous having the ability to drop an entire fleet from anywhere.    
---
The coming change turns the odds heavily to the side of cheap bomber fleets. You will see fleets of 50 or more bombers decloaking and killing capitals before a response can be sent to help them. Anything below super capitals and titans can be killed at any time, without defense. Even some super capitals will die to these fleets.     
---
Dropping capitals anywhere, at any time, is ridiculous, but being defenseless, in your own space, against cloaky, cheap murder machines, is equally ridiculous.
---
(PS: We cannot really drop 'from anywhere', but Delve is covered from 1DQ1-A)
---
i know exactly what you mean. \*wink\*
---
This UI layout makes me uncomfortable
---
No but foreal though. I'm space poor so can I have your stuff if you quit?
---
Yes. You are correct,but then.   You need a year to train into rorqal. So you will have 5 of them in 3 years. Assuming you train them as you make isk.    On top of that each this alt account cost you monthly sub. In plex or cash. So there is a cost on top and extractors dont pay for most of the sub.    Using this 5 rorquals you build a titan and train a pilot for it. Assuming you cross train ... it is at least 4 years.         
---
How many players venture into 4 year commitment?           
---
Few, but you have 6month players running 5 rorquals now
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Real wormholers trash talk in local 
---
2-5 space doesnt even count
---
Wouldnt be surprised If they did
---
&gt;It literally only makes it easier for wormhole dwellers and npc null dwellers to get some kills.
---
Which is excellent
---
I’m more curious about how this will effect pvp when everyone is in the dark with nothing to measure their epeen with.
---
You took some terrible advice and your post also shines light on the random nullbloc who made you do this.
---
Ironically to that last sentence I would say going to hi sec and spending a couple weeks to learn the game on your own would be really good for you as a player. While the isk per hour isnt great you will learn to fit your ships and soon enough the game will open for you. At which point you can start creating your own plans and in a game about making your plans instead of only doing what you were "generously advised to".
---
Very much yes. And now they decided to mess with the blocs in a massive and dumb way and those were the main recruiters of new players. Which means that people will leave and we will have fewer newer players staying than before.
---
The game just took a huge dump on itself. I honestly dont get how any gaming company can be this stupid.
---
It's funny how people still parrot that narrative when even Mittani admitted FC's were burned out and he was literally the only person in leadership who wanted to continue in the north (which propably came from the fact he rarely logs in and didn't do much different things from what he usually does)
---
The mct prices are still depressed compared to the value of 485 plex, though.
---
I love seeing how greedy companies dig themself a grave, then lay in it and just with for their death. 
---
Yeah and it is exactly what i am seeing CCP do since the start of this year. 
---
Now i am just waiting if they go with a bang or a whimper. And i am betting on the latter to be honest.
---
&gt;“Adapt or Die"
---
Or ,you know, just find any other game to play, or anything else to do with your time for that matter. :D
---
Way to pick up on the wrong sentiment from my comment
---
Hmm yes I think this one goes in the "mistakes" folder
---
Wow, glad i stopped playing before this. 
---
As i liked doing those missions, it would definitely angered me (even though i played as omega most of the time).
---
Ironically to that last sentence I would say going to hi sec and spending a couple weeks to learn the game on your own would be really good for you as a player. While the isk per hour isnt as much if you know what you are doing it is comparable to ratring. You will learn to fit your ships and soon enough the game will open for you. At which point you can start creating your own plans instead of only doing what you were "generously advised to".
---
4 ways to say 'get fucked'. Lovely.
---
Fuck knows
---
Most of the people making fun of others not speaking 100% correct english don't even know the basics of a second language. Change my mind.
---
If you need the lesson that bad, you're more than welcome to join the Marine Corps and get it yourself. You just have to last long enough to wind up in a unit with too much free time on its hands.
---
Doing it the exact same day they announce the change would be way to obvious, give them a week or so.
---
And all that in the safety of high sec. Where is the risk vs reward there?
---
Imagine trying this hard to disguise a mad nullbear post
---
What if I told you there is no "end game" in EVE?
---
Idk, it reads like "Drifters killed muh content" when in fact they were just used as excuse. If theres anything else in there i'd love to hear it.
---
Exactly. Its just not the adaption they want. But they have somehow gotten it in their heads that we should adapt by giving away kills, otherwise we are weak. Like what? Why should we take the hit for CCP failing to actually fix real issues.
---
Just because you dont like the changes doesn't make them bad!!!! listen to your own advice but in reverse!
---
Im not choosing whos good or bad, The game is famous, fun and successful for a few reasons. some of which have been lost in the last year or so. older players have been quitting, i think as more and more of these changes hit, more older players will return to try it out and enjoy it.
---
I am however, stating, if changes happen, and people cannot adapt, or move, and they only choose quit and cry. thats thier fault. eve is not a freidnly MMO to its playerbase, its meant to be hard, its meant to have the struggles.
---
Instead of CCP thinking of money, and oh we are scared to adjust things incase our rorqual army quits, theyre making thier game GOOD. For once a Dev is not thinking money first, and in the long run will be way better for the game and its playerbase.
---
Sure, just hold your breath watching your wallet, promise, isk is coming:)
---
wts this nuts on you chin
---
You might wanna pick up some repair paste mate.
---
That being said, awesome screenshot!
---
I mean, it just needs a meme man somewhere in the corner and boom... Surreal meme
---
All the 5+ years old players in this thread pretending to be newbros and crying. ROFL.
---
"But you don't know how many players are coming back, how many began to log in to kill stuff etc" - Yes we do,there is online counter on eve launcher,it shows same as year ago,so noone comes,or very few replacing those who stopped...
---
&gt; experiencing PvP in a PvP game keeps people engaged
---
HS ganking isn't really "experiencing PvP" is it you complete idiot.
---
pussy. grow up. injectors help older players get into the other ships that would otherwise not be available to them without more training time. the problem is that capitals are expensive, and most super pilots carry around nestors as fucking mobile depots, so.... what's a force recon for cyno's? jesus bro, grow the fuck up.
---
While this is a fair point and definetly valid i was more intending to point out that people used to take risks and in all honesty i think that it will happen again is far more likely than that noone is ever gonna rat again like some people want to pretend.
---
But muuuuh entitlement!! Reeeee!
---
Morel Nova would be proud
---
What's even better is that that's the first message you got jumping into Jita local.

Mad place, I love it

Oh right, chaos isn't fun when it happens to highsec.

Sorry to rain on your parade but it's very difficult convincing businesses to choose a path to make less money.

Armor rattlesnakes
---
&gt;:C Your account is locked because your, uh, alt alt is not subbed
---
Ok let's everyone join f1 blobs and just go ping warrior
---
Thank you, it needed to be said.
---
EvE is dying fast because of changes -posts are plenty these days.
---
The only thing dying is the old playstyle of afk ISK without much risk.
---
Member when we skilled for months into things we needed or paid billions on the char bazaar (on chars that also have been skiiled for months)? I 'member.  
---
But Evil CCP took these possibilities away. Grr CCP, hat CCP.
---
Sperging wormholer btw.
---
makes perfect sense to me. English isn't perfect, but he can communicate his point clearly enough in a language that is clearly not native, which is better than I can do.
---
Super umbrellas exist because of people shooting at krabs in null. :thonking:
---
wait, the A thing on young drivers is only here ? I though it was at least a european thing.
---
Anyway I actually like the idea of "practical training" for the particular of the ship
---
If people claim to be "capital pilots" primarily, there already is something wrong with this game.
---
All my chars can fly capitals, but they are just one tool in the box, mate.
---
BOSON
---
So basically, get a second (scout) account, ideally a third (recon) or GTFO? I guess CCP needs to reach these investors goals really badly.
---
Well, we still have clones with a full Improved set in-em'! 
---
Much cheaper to Plex alts than to buy injectors also.
---
WHAT! no i just not a death wish,   
---
counter play but not something you need make alt's purely for. i just hate stuff  that is forced on alt's  because there no other way to do that or it would just be shit to be the only thing you do,
---
I dont have a personal preference dude. Im looking at the data, at what Im seeing in space, at what others are saying. And Im telling you, this is bad for the game. You disagree and thats quite fine, I can only see that you will see what Im saying in time. Just be objective about it and you will in time see higher prices, lower amount of players, less content in space and so on. 
---
And what happens if these older players wont return? What happens if they actually stopped playing the game for other reasons and nothing will bring them back in large enough numbers? 
---
People are adapting. Quitting is adapting. If the game isnt fun for them why should they stay? So people right now are crying and quitting but the older PvP players didnt cry and quit? Thats hypocrisy.
---
Its also meant to have counters, which right now is lacking in the blackout.
---
Thats the thing here dude, this is to push up metrics. This isnt good for the game and you will see it in time. Instead of constantly thinking its nullbears crying you should take the time to hear what we are actually saying. We are on your side, belive it or not. Because that side is also ours. I do lots of things in Eve, including PvP. If I fk your over I fk myself over, you understand this right? 
---
And Im telling you that this will long term kill content. Right now they are making NS unlivable and its already showing. Check ADMs on dotlan if you dont belive me. Activity is already down by alot. People are just quitting the game or moving to HS, no matter what they do they wont be out in NS space meaning it will be less content overall. 
---
And I dont give a shit about who likes PvE or PvP the most, I just know that in empty space there will simply be less people to shoot. You understand that this used to be Eve right? CCP made changes so that people would start living in NS instead of HS so there would be more content in space. But what they are doing right now is reverting that and it will become like it used 2, most living in HS. 
---
Who are you gonna shoot if theres nobody there to shoot?
---
All right, Ill take the bait.
---
Am I wrong?
---
If the answer to people complaining about terrible changes to Eve is "then don't sub" this game will be even more empty then it already is.
---
There's an elevated risk, of course, but they have enough eHP that you have time to form a response. Carriers just die too quickly without instant cyno, so carrier ratting is dead.
---
The blackout and the VNI changes more or less killed subcap ratting (outside of disposable myrmidons), so anom ratting is basically thrown entirely to supercarriers and titans.
---
So it can be alpha'd by a fleet that does  like 500 damage... which is almost every fleet.
---
There might be now. Back in 2009 there were quite a lot fewer of those.
---
I remember I wanted to join Goons but then I needed to be part of something awful forums and if my memory serves me right you couldn't just join it. You needed either an invite from someone inside or wait for them to open registration. But sure I was a different person back then. I didn't spend as much time reading and researching things as I do now.
---
Even then however. I would not be playing this game if skill injectors weren't a thing because by the time I had skilled enough to be of use  and I mean even the most basic stuff (you didn't get as good of a start back then as you do now) I would've grown bored.
---
&gt;They don't hardlock me out of my Account, therefore they don't push me towards using more than one Account.
---
&gt;If I don't like something in a game I do like, I immediately have to trigger the nuclear option and not play the game anymore.
---
Now who's behaving like a child?
---
No,
---
I said Ccp isn't forcing you to sub
---
Whose quotes are you referring to here? Please copy paste what you're trying to translate
---
You might be right but I wouldn't have stayed long enough to join Karma if I hadn't been able to entertain myself (somewhat) in FW and not stood a chance against anyone I met. Other people are ultimately what makes MMOs fun.
---
Well, i started in february and i won already in May. 
---
Such a time / money commitment for such a low entertainment value was really not worth it overal.
---
I live in wormhole space and starting to see a lot more forays into null systems after the blackout.
---
Injectors and all the opportunities to get SP did help make the game more fun for me. Being able to fly most of the subcaps and fly doctrine ships. For a couple of months after I started, all I did was log-on to train and fly a couple of missions.
---
It was a thing way before he started to play
---
EVE has been "dying" since less than a month after the beta endad, everyone that thinks that the game will die because his "50 accounts" is seriously delusional or plain stupid.
---
But that's what you get when you spoonfed people and cover them in safety nets, a bunch of entitled little fucks. It's only fair that CCP has to deal with the sperging of their own creation.
---
Well, aren't you supposed to rat in super/carrier while aligned to a citadel? The cyno cannot save you in time if you get tackled by a blops fleet while ratting in a carrier. Cyno can only save supers and rorqs.
---
The "required" amount of accounts for flying a capital went up to 3 (from 2). You now need a fax and a force recon on standby to survive. I guess you could do without those, if you plan on using capitals like throwaway toys. If you want to keep your super carrier or titan you will need those.    
---
Playing without these alts and relying on other players to save your ass is unreasonable (and not even possible in the short amount of time when getting dread bombed or dropped by bombers).
---
3 accounts is not much for most EVE players, but as someone who always tries to keep the number of alts low, it just went up for me.
---
Nah, skilling without injectors was completely removed from the game. (I wonder where the SP in the injectors come from though)
---
&gt;GM not contacting me with "Hi Rigknot, we see your cyno alt has dropped subscription, we have decided to lock your account
---
&gt;If you resort to buying skill Injectors and plexing alts due to changes, that means you're fully in support of the changes.
---
If you don't enjoy these changes then I strongly recommend you DON'T support it financially by buying plex, subbing, etc
---
There you go.

[Idea] Dial down your posting. Preferably to 0.

I think it's just France, but it might be Belgium too, we use a P in the UK, all knowledge only comes from multiple trips through the country on my way to the in laws in Holland.

Fun..... In nullblobs....

M'kay.
---
Some people tend to pick up terminology quicker than others. I could probably pass as a massive CS:GO fan, despite having less than 15 hours in that game, just from listening to my buddies talk about it.
---
I would recommend Astero only if you are Omega and with good skills (LVL4 or 5 for relevant skills), but only if you are willing to PVP.  
---
If you only want to explorate and fly away when someone warp to your site, go for a T2 exploration frigate. It's cheaper and works better.  
---
But if you want to be able to kill other explorers around you while you are looking for relic or data sites, Astero is the best. Moreover, it makes the exploration process less boring and more challenging, that's why I really recommend this way.  
---
If you go for this way of doing, feel free to check this vid ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkorJuDfaZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkorJuDfaZc)) where I give few tips and fit about the Astero.
---
Well not my content, we have a pretty nice war with frat and Co for the last half a year or so.
---
You cannot use Sansha in the name. I bribed some CONCORD officials to prevent this.
---
Ccp should be trying to make their game good enough that we want to sub but they don't know how to do that.
---
I believe a ratting carrier doesn't have enough eHP to survive a blops fleet long enough to cyno in support. It melts in seconds. Carriers and supers are supposed to rat while aligned anyways.
---
"Terrible" is completely subjective is this context, and that has happened since forever. So what's new?
---
Microtransactions is the reason Eve is still around. MMOs cost a lot of money and very few can survive with just a subscription. Before "Free-to-Play" with microtransactions became a thing MMOs in Eves size were shut down.
---
Higsec bots

Now is always the best time to start
---
OT but I was scrolling Reddit on my phone and didn’t realise there was fluff on the left side of the screen. Scrolled past this and it looked like the stars were moving on the space background, just freaked the fuck out
---
I ignore HS so much that I often forget there are lots of those, good point.
---
It is a CODE guy that own most of those orcas .....
---
Or the basics of their first language.
---
The fking blackout does this exactly.
---
Sp comes from irl cash. If you need to train new skills to continue to do what you were already doing prior to a change.
---
That's a cash grab.
---
Right. Guess I didn't read properly.
---
Hi Chicka!
---
There was a time when polio was a thing as well. I.e., shit changes and you cant just change one factor if you want regression, you have to change a lot of them.
---
I read 'fingers' at first .....
---
There is no endgame in Eve. Nor is there a mid. You fly what you want, whenever you want.
---
Thanks, 
---
I should then clarify the statement because what I am focusing on really is the argument of people buying skill Injectors + subbing even more alts to counter a change.
---
&gt;Its also meant to have counters, which right now is lacking in the blackout.
---
What doesnt have a counter? everything has a counter, everything.
---
The thing is, people are quitting eve before these changes, maybe the numbers didnt show as well because more and more single humans were getting mroe and more accounts to farm and mess around with. what happens if one of these humans quit, huge number drop each one alone.
---
&gt;Right now they are making NS unlivable and its already showing. Check ADMs on dotlan if you dont believe me. Activity is already down by alot. People are just quitting the game or moving to HS, no matter what they do they wont be out in NS space meaning it will be less content overall 
---
Oh dont be so dramatic, and where there is space, it will be filled by another, the guys in lowsec (most of them actually have balls btw) will fill the gap. thats a natural economy.
---
Whats strange is yesterday i Went out and Rat in my Aeon (i dont usually rat it was quite fun for a change tbh), in the same system my friends rorqual mined, and we all were pretty safe doing so through planning and teamwork.
---
Look, we both love the game, i understand the changes are bad for some people and the way theyre used to playing eve, eve has changed so many times, but it has not really changed alot in the last year at least. people have got 'used' to how safe they are and how they do things, most people naturally are scared of change.
---
Your saying your unhappy because things are harder, ok understood, eves done this before to people once or twice :D. your looking at some numbers and log in numbers are down? or just content, well. its a big change, people arnt sure yet, they havent worked it out yet, its great isnt it. 
---
One of the issues in the game is how many people there are actually. clearly CCP need money, but the mechanics in the game with a 2010 player base are actually quite fun. 
---
All im doing is telling you, that no, not everyone hates these changes, not everyone hates eve because of these changes. and its way too early to officially state if these types of changes are good for eve. all i know is im not alone when i say im pretty excited to see the next and the next and the next huge gamechanger. the new eve meta might be who can adapt the quickest, not the best.
---
I still consider myself a new'ish player (getting close to two years) and am personally super-bummed by all these latest changes. I used to triple-box VNI's in asteroid belts for a long time for the carrier/hauler/officer spawns. Was making good money, but guess what happens.. they nerf my VNI's.
---
Around the same time I decided to inject the last bit to get my main into a Nyx. Guess what happens.. they remove local and to top it off they remove the ability for me to cyno and get help. At the time I was also training my alts into a carrier because I wanted to try triple-boxing them. So that's €150+ wasted on injectors and a lot of time wasted on training skills on my alts.
---
So yeah, I am super disappointed in the changes that have been happening recently. Should have injected into a rorqual instead.
---
Why yes I have my dear, and it's only ever hurt me in good ways
---
It sounds like this change has been word smithed by a terrible csm that's now trying to make their terrible change sound better, a lot like when Manfred helped make wand sov and defended it as if it was a good change for everyone.
---
A good counter argument. I have not seen this message anywhere before. Everyone is just jumping on injectors and shit.
---
In one post someone just proved how pointless the CSM is.
---
I mean, you can make fun of someone without actually being mean, just for lolz. That's the case here. Just memeing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Fight on a station, dock up when you need to.
---
Take your salt elsewhere
---
Zeugmas and Polarized come from Sleeper sites, I am pretty sure he refers to pirate data sites instead.  
---
Also, Zeugma BPCs are worthless.  
---
Datacores are also worthless.  
---
The only decent loot from a pirate data site is one of the 3 sleeper manufacturing components that actually fetch some price on the market. But that is like 1 in a 100 sites.
---
I don´t think exploration needs buffs, it is already a very lucrative low-sp low-risk source of income.
---
Literally logged in to that message in local. Best community
---
So you were just kidding about it being hard to tell because you can't convey tone over text
---
Got it. I'll do better next time. Promise.
---
Let me introduce you to a cloacky recon and his 3 friends ... so those 4 people can still super rat and mine in a system.
---
*deez
---
often where theres a problem, theres a fit to fix it. infact, thats pretty much eve in a nutshell
---
Because when they are rolling out changes in such a rapid cadence, you probably won't have the option of slow training cyno V and the prereqs for your chosen recon. Therefore you will need injectors I order to retain current functionality.
---
I mean you notice when people have a certain Eve attitude and Im seeing this in a lot of these "newer" players responses. Its sad that they have to resort to this.
---
Sub or capital.
---
Explain why it's nonsense. I'm willing to have my opinion changed with a coherent argument.
---
See! Go boy go!
---
I know it's hard for you hole bois to grasp I'm not even talking about home defense.
---
This answer needs more upvotes.
---
already have tactics to solve this, and the change isn't eve here yet.
---
people gotta calm down and let the smart ones think for them xD
---
Or rely on other people? I don't understand why you HAVE to have those alts. It's not like your 32.000 character alliance lacks people..
---
im mean, you do make money tank fit..... your absolutly wrong to say you dont.
---
infact thats a choice in life, high risk high reward, go gank fit and make more but die easier, or go tank fit make less but die less.
---
people gotta adapt. and re adapt. move with the game, not against it.
---
EVE should be a difficult game.
---
The purpose of the cyno change is.
---
Making battle escalations have a grater chance of mistakes being made.
---
This is better game play.
---
Dunno about the US but here in the UK it's mandatory to be taught the basics in at least one language, it's usually another European language (typically French, German or Spanish) but I think Mandarin is becoming more popular in schools also.
---
Time is money.
---
You bring up a good point. It's just sad that good critique like this gets lost in the whitewash.
---
I would fully support editing skill requirements to make the adaptation a little less traumatic time-wise
---
You looking to get the Captain fking Obvious award of the year or what? 
---
And this entire "mommy look Im mature" is meh. The adult thing is generally to actually hear what people are saying and discuss, not act like a fking child with an OP telling people to stfu just because your sensitive eyes dont wanna read critisicm.
---
Well yes an no. Capital ship allows you to survive small gang until  help arrives. Subcap will die at the same time.  
---
  Super is giving you time to react to much bigger gang.  Even 200 bombers need like 5-6 minutes to kill a tanked super. More if you bomb them with your fighters forcing them to rewarp.          
---
This give you time to react , bring cyno alt or warp in, jump in a fax that will buy more time.
---
CCP should maybe do some in game events prior to these changes so let people get some free SP...
---
Oh wait.
---
Yea, it's kinda the argument I am drifting to but he has an interesting point about reaction times there. Waking up the cyno and fax guys might waste precious seconds you need to save a ship
---
T1 hulls bad support skills in early game. T2 hulls, getting better at pvp knowledge and learning things like hunting, mid game.
---
owning capitals should be endgame, yolo'ing marauders etc etc.
---
yes you CAN fly anything anytime, just plex, but hes saying you shouldnt, its not healthy for your game experience, or whatll happen is when they drastically change the one shiptype youve rushed into as a new dude your gonna cry, oh, erm. shit thats already happening.
---
It's like milk, it comes from the supermarket!
---
The fix to cloaky camping is to accept that it didn't need fixing.
---
I addressed your point already, but I'll repeat it, because you are dumb:     
---
You cannot rely on other people to burn a force recon to your capital that is under dread or bomber dps. By the time it arrives, or is stopped by bubbles, you capital is dead. You can also not push the responsibility of having fax alts on other people, because if everyone does that, nobody has them.
---
You shouldn't have to be babysat by multiple people to do basic things like moving a ship.
---
[deleted]
---
This will not work this way, as you need recon on site for escalation to happen. Even more, more than one recon, as the moment last recon die  ... there is no more escalation possible
---
I'm not saying it is mean, I'm saying it is stupid... like laughing at someone's haircut while you have a pile of dogshit on top of your head.
---
Spot on!
---
Dev time are too busy working on CCPs next failed project so they are currently just taking reddit advice. No way this could backfire in any manner....
---
the real shame is 80% of players even at 100mil SP and over, dont actually know how to fit a ship. no clue on why certain modules are used etc.
---
fitting ship in this game is generally quite basic. but people follow others advice. i wonder what eve would be if they removed fit sharing, and killmails (i know no killmails would suck) but just to see how everyone would end up fitting thier shit xD
---
So you are doing what CCP want you to do. Move to higsec
---
I know this 99% is a meme, but just so you're aware
---
In classic, the skillfloor is pretty high and the skillcap pretty low. Your time spent and gear is WAY more important than how good or knowledgeable you are. Everything is piss easy mechanics wise - also pvp. Get ready for a grindfest where you're judged by how much time you have to grind
---
Yes... so? Your point mate?
---
Yes, we have to light cynos within a two minute timeframe, when a cyno inhibitor is dropped.
---
Oi, I get off on people calling me an idiot &gt;:c
---
YOU ARE ASKING FOR SAFE SPACE YET YOU ARE CALLING OTHERS RISK AVERSE.
---
And you didn´t build jack. You blue up half of EvE and then you punch yourself in the chest because you think you "built something and put a lot of effort into it" while all you do is sit in your little safe corner where no one should be able to touch you.  Yet it is the other guy who is risk averse.
---
And once someone bigger than you comes you just run away like a little pussycat. You pack it all up and flee faster than sonic the hedgehog, just like some hairy unwashed steppe nomad. Yet it is the other guy who is risk averse.
---
All you do is avoid PvP and drool at your mouth while shooting red crosses or zapping stationary rocks, and when someone by some miracle manages to catch you with your pants on the ground you just press your IWIN button and insta delete them, thinking to yourself how great of a PvPer you must be. Yet it is the other guy who is risk averse.
---
Your post literally gave me cancer, Ebola, 80HD and hemorrhoids at the same time!
---
Na, we dont need balance. I say lets take more advice from this sub and just let the burning of NS continue. Then after its done we can all sit in our HS Keepstars and watch as the "elite" begs us to come back.
---
It should offer a degree of safety, not complete immunity.
---
It's just wierd that they call it a cashgrab when there are WAY easier, less controversial cashgrabs they can do, like sexy new skills, and new DLC packs.
---
Real Dynamic Tru Sec were Trusec values are based on how much destruction took place within that week with the top 10% of systems been given a 1.0 trusec value and the dead systems given a 0.1 value
---
It's a cashgrab if its done with that intent.
---
That doesn't make sense because it will likely provide less cash than other easier things like another sp dlc.
---
some of the missions are endless, just saying :D its good to do them youll need the cash buffer when you start getting into bigger hulls and dying learning testing.
---
I like it
---
When was the last time nullseccers had a decent cap fight?
---
NEVER, BECAUSE EVERYONE WITHIN 10 CAP JUMPS IS BLUE TO THEM.
---
It doesn't offer immunity.
---
If you're too retarded to fit a cyno and light it, while being in comms then you are going to have a bad time.
---
Ok slick.
---
I'm the idiot because you can't form an actual argument?
---
If people killing people in nullsec has no effect on nullsec, then risk has no effect on nullsec.
---
Is that you're point?
---
I tried saving money but those new Vitalshift skins...
---
FUCK
---
akf hisec mineing, if CCP needs to up sub prices to account for the loss of all the AFK miners and players in this game, im cool with that.
---
no one should be AFK mining or playing in this era. im thinking thats generally the idea
---
I get your point. All I’m saying is that if the Alliance want to they would be able to. Saying they won’t be able to get then into position is too absolute. It will be harder (which is the point of the chaos era) but not impossible.
---
Hear hear.
---

---
Here are both sides dropping their first supers at the same time.
---
&gt;You blue up half of EvE and then you punch yourself in the chest because you think you "built something and put a lot of effort into it" 
---
He did build something.
---
A network of like-minded players working together for a common goal. A, community, if you will.
---
eve is for sure not for everyone. thats alwasy been said.
---
the player need to have drive to learn, want a challenge and often quit if they dont find a group of friends to learn play and have fun together. the game REALLY starts after 6months -10months of omega skilling
---
Not really a terrible experience to be honest. Theres something attractive about the risk of the unknown. Just felt bad about the guys losing their ships.
---
Cyno's are about alts.
---
That isn't changing.
---
Maybe your buddy in a carrier can bring an extra ship he poops out for you.
---
They make me want to fly manticores...
---
I just started 2 weeks ago. So far I'm having a blast. The community is... weird. Generally great, especially in-game, I noticed people are nicer than most other MMO's I played. But they are also completely ruthless. Here on the fora there seems to be a lot of butthurt people but from what I've seen no more or less than other communities out there.
---
Why I went for EVE as opposed to others is that, I like complex games and dislike grinding for the next skill, the next level. The whole idea of "I need to bash the skulls in of 1000 more goblins and then I can upgrade to &lt;blah&gt;"
---
Now, I'm not saying there is no grinding in Eve. You want money you gotta work for it (or pay for it with real life money, I guess)
---
Skills are earned over time. Whether you're logged in or not. So you can set up the skills you want (which are requirements for certain ships / items and also make them better) and if you don't feel like playing for a day you don't have to worry about falling behind or something.
---
If you're one of those people who actually likes grinding, killing mob after mob for loot and profit, you can. NPC pirates can be found all over the place and you have missions to go after them, you earn bounty from killing them + money from completing the missions. If you're tired of doing that you can set up youtube / netflix / whatever and go mine a bit and earn extra money that way. AFK mining is a bad idea, semi-AFK mining is fine depending on location.
---
Personally I go around doing different types of missions to earn money and learn the different weapons better, then when I get bored of that I go mine and try to get enough stuff to build my next ship and help building stuff for others in the corp I joined (corp is eve-guild)
---
Finally, everything is a PvP zone. In sectors with high security, if you attack a player the police will kill you but if you can kill your victim before you get killed yourself then your buddy can come and collect the loot. The whole "nowhere is truly safe" idea makes things a lot more interesting. If I got a nice load of valuable stuff... do I go to the crowded sector that will give me the best price with the risk of getting ganked? Or do I sell it somewhere else, make a bit less money but be more safe?
---
Everybody around you is a potential threat... and a potential target at the same time. As a beginner you're pretty safe in highsec mainly because it'll take a while before you'll be carrying stuff that's worth enough for others to lose a ship for. But safety is always relative.
---
Both of those have a place as tackle in a fleet. A recon might sometimes but they are too squishy for a lot of fleets.
---
I don't know if the outer skirts of new eden are meant to be buzzing rather than feeling lonely tbh.
---
Who hurt you? I speak two languages and am trying to get into the third one nowadays, what's with the attitude
---
But you'll bring it if you need to.
---
Dics and interceptors are very squishy but do a great job as suicide tackle.
---
You tell him! This is the serious zone.
---
Give us an example please.
---
Changing cynos was totally an accidental bug. Definitely wasn't a planned feature.
---
How so? The blackout makes it so you should be flying things that are cheap and easily replaced as you can't have perfect intel and enemies may be around. Something like a carrier, especially for someone getting started and barely getting their first one, is the polar opposite of cheap and easily replaced.
---
Unable To warp. Fuel bay empty.
---
Ehn. You can get more granular than that.. As there are certain tells that give you a good timeframe when it's time critical.
---
Unfortunately, I think eve's running costs require more than just you to be subscribed.
---
This gets my upvote o7
---
&gt; the game REALLY starts after 6months -10months of omega skilling
---
Exactly. That is not a commitment (neither timewise nor moneywise) i am willing to make just to perhaps..... maybe..... start liking the game after i have sunk so much resources into it.
---
BS's can have trouble hitting the smaller stuff, that's why you should have small drones (warrior, acolyte, hobgoblin, hornet) to kill those. Your preferred play style depends on your gun choice:
---
* If you have autocannons, you should fit a web (stasis webifier) and afterburner. Then get into web range, web and shoot.
---
* If you have artillery, you should keep rats close to your optimal range (which is of the order of tens of kilometers). At this range you can usually just blap (one-shot) the smaller rats too as they are flying straight towards you (zero transversal velocity, meaning easier to track even with big guns) but keep the small drones because if you can blap all the rats, drones are not helping, but if you don't then you need small drones to kill the (most likely) small rats that got to you. Fitting a micro jump drive (MJD) can also help since it lets you get distance easily if rats are getting too close. Just mind the aiming, MJD jumps your ship a fixed distance to the direction its facing, so jumping directly away from the next gate means you'll have to jump back or slowboat a long time to it. Instead pick an angle where you land a good distance away from the rats and not too far from the next gate.
---
I already have a real job and I'm not into raiding other countries for oil and killing people or whatever, sorry. Also knowing already what timezones are I'm probably overqualified.
---
Well. I like the first two.
---
I would remove tether from all current upwell structures entirely and have something something similar (or even closer to pos shields) in small structures.
---
Don't tell a new bro to look for sites in c5/6. You want c1-3 and then you can scan faction sata/relic sites and run them for good isk.
---
thats fine, like i said, its not for everyone.
---
and its thoughts like that why they made alpha free to play available.
---
people then get stuck into thinking eve is free and its unfair to ask for a sub, subscriptions have kept this game going.
---
New Eden is a dystopia.
---
I like the changes.
---
mad lol
---
Honestly I think one issue with nullsec ratting could be that it is completely independent from the game´s economy. Most other activities´ revenues tend to scale somewhat according to the amount of people running said activity - too many people doing it will obliterate the margins, while too few doing it will make prices rise due to insufficient supply. Ratting now has completely static rewards, which is kinda bad. It also generates ISK out of thin air which is also bad, but that is a different can of worms.
---
If ratting behaved the same then people stopping ratting due to space being dangerous would drive the prices up and make it more profitable for people who do actually take the risk and rat anyway. The same way DED sites behave currently. Fewer people ratting -&gt; fewer escalations -&gt; reduced deadspace loot supply -&gt; increased loot value -&gt; increased income for people who take the risk and do sites anyway. Most activities in EvE work this way and I think it is a healthy way for them to behave.
---
The thing I absolutely do not like about the past changes is that they exponentially increased the RISK but did not increase the REWARD, which is a concept EvE should be known for.
---
Nerf cynos, massively nerf capital ships´ HP, deplete resources, yadda yadda but DO INCREASE THE REWARD proportionally.
---
If I were a null line member and had to rat in a T1 praxis nowadays I think I would rather put a bullet in my forehead.
---
Thinking about the defensive advantages of Citidel/Time-zone tanking, Sov, Jump Gate and Tenebrex Cyno Jammer mechanics as I read this. Id say that getting a foothold into someone else's space is tricky enough. But lets get real, the reason these changes are being proposed is to ensure pve'ers in Carriers, Super Carriers, and Rorquals die alot more often in this blackout/chaos era. In terms of actual war, the strongest combatant benifited the most from cynos, now its going to shift to the defenders favor. These are ships, this is Naval warfare and ya can't call the coast guard to establish a foothold in heavily defended hostile waters, instead you match your opponent in strength(fleetSizes/CAPS), skill(FC's) and the big one Positioning(Cynos) as a attacker. With the defensive perks ive listed already I wouldn't endorse this change for the sake of large scale combat as its already in a unhealthy balance.
---
Like talking to a brick wall heh.
---
If 1month of mega krabbing would reduce delve resources to 10% of the original and it would take 1y to return to 100% with only Light grazing. Then there would be a massively more conflict all around.
---
Truth be told, putting the effort into grinding the SP and minerals shouldn't result in easily jumping to content for nothing more than fuel costs and right-clicking on a name in Fleet chat.
---
The SP basically pays dividends _forever_. And the mineral/ISK invested pays until you become a lossmail. 
---
There ought to be more effort put in to capital navigation.
---
You're part of the 4% retention. You seem like you've got a good head on you.
---
One tip from a 10 year vet... Keep pushing boundaries on what you know and do.. This game is huge.
---
lmbo
---
Then maybe tell people about the change before the event is almost over?
---
There are two players involved.  One attacks the other.  That's PvP.  CCP says so.  Is CCP wrong?  How badly do I have to prove you wrong, with facts and information directly from the developers, before you'll admit it? You're still downvoting and namecalling like a crazy person, and I'm the only one who came armed with actual facts from the developers, but I'm the "complete idiot?"  
---
Still waiting on the apology my friend.
---
Agreed. I hear this from friends. Especially bad for me as I speak Texan.
---
never said anyone cares, just a funny reaction.
---
Maybe they should just inject the skills for you also, so no one can potentially make the wrong decision.
---
I don’t know what people want. Apparently the stale status quo was great?
---
This isn't even "chaos", either OP made the silly mistake of hitting roaming trigs first or they went and mined in a system that very clearly has a triglavian invasion going on. There's the font change, icons that show up (like incursions, FW and nullsov), you get a notification and are force-joined into a public channel... kind of hard to miss you're in an invasion. :P
---
It's never fun if you deliberately choose to be at the other end of the railgun
---
....what?
---
They also need more than you.
---
What is your point?
---
Please, try to use smaller words so my brick headed ass can understand.
---
"effort"
---
the game will be fun
---
All of this relies on 1 single thing. Can you guess it? That you actually are in space. These changes are slowly but surely making NS unlivable and making content more scarce. If you idea of fixing stagnation is by completely deleting the reason why people even were in space then maaaaaaaaan.
---
And the game got stagnant because CCP never introduced a mechanic that would make it worth to prosecute wars. Dont fking blame players for that, just like CCP are doing, blame the lazy company that owns the IP that hasnt released a decent expansion in forever. Imagine if WoW never got any expansions, what do you think would happen with the playerbase?
---
TL:DR, any game needs progression. But progression requires actual fking effort. CCPs idea of progression is regression, its by making one side even more tedious and allowing the other to have more advantages in order to soft reboot things. Literally by telling one side to not have fun so that the other side has fun. Thats not good gaming development. All sides need to have fun otherwise they fking wont play. End of story.
---
Had two Omega acounts. Both are now unsubscribed til Iceland police arrest CCP's PCP dealer.
---
Destroy all stargates make wh the only way to travel without cynos and bridges. All Empires colapse and can only hold single systems. Many new Empires rise to that you have about 50-100 Npc System everything else will be 0.0 Space and they delete the map because we wouldnt need it without stargates. Oh and later on the Triglavians and Drifter stick together to erase mankind from the Universe.
---
u/CCPFalcon stole my wallet to buy plex.  Reeeeeee!
---
might be that people would have to group up and do pve content, keep logi on grid, use some pvp fits or ships and so on.   
---
Might be that it is forced to become a cooperative mmo instead of a game of multiboxed alts. Might be people will need to finally start playing together. Imagine the horror :)))
---
The people responsible for the current state of the game are the smart ones? You mean CCP aren't responsible for skill injectors and Rorquals? Who's the dumb one here.
---
Kung fu pandas, we need Kung fu pandas!
---
The real universe is expandin, why can't New Eden also expand? In these times of chaos, new gates to undiscovered regions should appear. That would be great fun for explorers and all others
---
Yeah I've played EVE for over 6 years now. I got a super 18 months because someone quitting helped me out and I got a titan about a year later yet I can on my fingers the number of real "Im glad I was there" supercapital experiences I've had.
---
Subcaps and high risk borderline yolo capital usage is where it's at.
---
It was sarcasm
---
Of course it was an intended thing.
---
No its not. Its the now higher reqs on alts that people are bitching about. Its the killing of safe cyno fleets, its the fact that moving them around now is gonna be a bitch. Its the tedious factor.
---
They need to meet us somewhere in the middle.
---
Or just follow the rule they used to have when changing skill requirements. 
---
&gt;if you could fly it before, you can fly it after.
---
Null sec does revolve around your micro gang pvp do you understand ?
---
What was?
---
The cyno change?
---
Or getting people to spend money?
---
Because clearly I was talking about it only being a cashgrab if the goal is to get people to spend more money to train.
---
Or shut down.
---
Yeah, maybe with cynos limited to select hulls.
---
No, he joined the community, unless he is one of the founding members. 
---
Joining a thing is virtually 10 minutes of effort.
---
And the systems you leave behind are worthless for a while. Sounds like scorched earth doctrine. Bad idea!
---
But if the max amount of resources per system couldn´t support the amount of players like it does now, that would mean you have to spread out. How about that idea?
---
Yes.
---
you take back imperialist pig
---
wat u mean?
---
New Edens Best \[BEST.\]  
---
Early days pre move to null it was amazing.
---
It offers pretty much complete immunity unless said person is a complete bird-brain. There will be fewer bird-brains out there after this changes.
---
What can you not fly after these changes? Are you proposing all currently fitted cyno ceptors and corvettes should remain until they no are all dead? or Anyone subbed to the game before Sept XX can light cynos on any ship, and everyone after cannot?
---
Not really seeing where you are going here. They are simply changing which ships can fit cyno's, and expanding the type of cynos JF's can jump to.
---
CCP have made MANY questionable choices. most of the changes and i mean most ive whitnessed have been awesome, and EVERYONE has hated every new changed at each patch, eve is dead, theyve ruined eve now. theyre money grabbing.
---
Injectors and Rorquals are shit, although they said they would change rorquals for a more active mining role for like 2 years before they actually implemented the change the ship did want a new life. which is VERY much has.
---
the damage done by injectors is irreversable. its a real shame. but eve players, (not MMO players specificly eve players) adapt. and move with the trainwreck that is eve.
---
If i told you, if they didnt bring out injectors, or somthing along those lines to generate income the company would fall and eve online would stop completly. what would you say then?
---
* Thats fine, let it die, 'nothing of value was lost' didnt want that game anyway.
---
or
---
* well. eves fun, its got a bit shit because of these, but at least the game i and thousands of others have put so much time and money into can keep playing, even if it is with a pinch of salt. Love for eve is 'already replaced'
---
&gt;  How badly do I have to prove you wrong
---
You haven't proved anything.  You're literally arguing against a backdrop of declining player numbers and basic "most popular" reviews on platforms like steam bemoaning the problems of which I speak.  Do you think CCP knows what it's doing?  When did that begin?
---
Very much. They keep forgetting that the game going more casual actually bought Eve several years. No they are going back on that.
---
So it's not immunity...
---
Check the eve steam forums. Not moderated. Filled with dead threats and trolls. Its glorious
---
I thought he was making a Mad Max reference
---
A community only exists if it's members buy in to it and participate.
---
Good idea +1
---
maybe you guys should have tought your army of meatshield drones the basics of the game or something.
---
this always amuses me greatly
---
Many characters that could light cynos, now can't.
---
Depends
---
Either something tanky enough that survives the alpha, or something with a higher range
---
A cheap high range counter would be a Naga frog fleet (I can send you some fittings when I get home if you want).
---
They are around 100mil and hit with 1700 alpha out to +-300km
---
You need 4-5 CMDs though.
---
You can either fuck them up, or just annoy them out of the system because very few things can hit that far
---
A much more expensive option is a Chemo fleet, I have no experience with them, except on the receiving end in a somewhat squishy frog fleet
---
Maybe so but to turn it into such an art I think that's all olmeca
---
How do we know the triglav are not actually...... wait for it......... PANDA ???
---
Literally still selling over twice as much as before the change.....
---
With experience, sure, you can look at a hole and give a pretty good estimate on lifespan, but when it’s his first WH? He’s not gonna be able to differentiate too well.
---
but they #can still light cynos.   
---
just maybe cannot fly the ships that are required to do so.  
---
so...you think these toons should be grandfathered into being able to light cynos on whatever ship they want? thus making this a pointless balance pass.
---
Not relevant, but still:  
---
\+ Dark age is a creation of the Age of Enlightenment. Basically Enlightenment's guys created this word and a bunch of false stories about this period so they would look like to be the good guys in comparaison to the "dark age". It's just a way to control crowd when you don't give them enough rights.  
---
\+ Dark age was really nothing like chaos. Chaos is no rules, no patterns. Dark age were age of the kings, the lords, the knights, etc.. I was very very organised. In a way it's the perfect opposite of chaos.  
---
\+ Big group of players being annoyed by NPCs or game mechanic changes is not Chaos neither, it's just big groups being annoyed.
---
Also last thing, if you think about EVE before sleeping and it brings scary thoughts to your mind, you should take a break man.
---
Cloaks and d-scan immune ships literally have no counter right now. And dont give me the shit about people on gates and so on. Telling people to get more accounts to handle the one account of the attacker is just shit.
---
You seem to not know that there was a time when NS people made all their isk in HS.
---
So what, I mean nobody said you cant rat. Its just more tedious now than before.
---
You are dismissing everything Im saying by calling me a bitch that is scared of change. I never ever fking said Im unhappy because of things getting harder. 
---
You know what, some people will never realise until its too late. So go ahead, have it your way.
---
&gt; some pvp fits or ships and so on.
---
BuT muH tIckS!
---
They're just jealous because Texas is the best country in the world.
---
Never, fuck bittervets.
---
Anyone ever saying any specific thing in Eve is endgame is talking shit. The entire game is an endgame outside of the starting issues like bad support skills and such. Which is why I didnt mention early game but instead said mid.
---
There are tons of people that have played forever and still dont fly caps. It was never endgame to them. Endgame in Eve is exactly what you make of it, nothing less, nothing more.
---
You can start with WH class 1. You will need a cruiser of your race (do not forget to fit probe launcher or put it in the cargohold and take a mobile depot for refit it, because the entrance may close) there is not much dps there and you should even cope with a cheap fit.
---
Ah and now he lost it. Where are all the high effort comments man. Now you don't even make sense anymore. I am disappointed with you. You were producing excellent quality salt. You were saying original things before, and now you are just trying to go with a tidier 'no u'. Pathetic. Even triggered enough to check my comment history and can't even think that this account is solely created to obtain peak salt from losers like you. You really need to get some friends mate.
---
Ye cause youre so mature with your big boi pants on.
---
I'm saying characters shouldn't have functionality removed from them.
---
&gt;how do people "live" in wormholes?
---
With friends.
---
&gt;do they make everything themselves?
---
The mining in J-Space generally sucks compared to Null. A few DST's bring in what you need. Stuff gets made in the hole with resources brought in from K-Space mining. If it can't be made in the hole, it can probably fit into a DST and be brought in that way.
---
Do the combat sites with friends until you get enough to afford a Rattlesnake or whatever. A C3 site gets you around 40m. You can split it with corpmates and fly an Oracle or something.
---
Eve is always "in a time of drama". If people are not mad at CCP then they are mad at the goons (grr goons), PanFam or something else.
---
With that being said, welcome to Eve! I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
---
And the winner for idiots that dont read threads goes tooooooooo....... ^this guy.
---
After gates are buildable, configurable, and destroyable.
---
The space might 'feel' empty, but you know it's not. That's part of the appeal imo.
---
endgame is generally referred to the largest, most expensive, hardest to get into or buy things that cannot get got until LATER on in the game. hence lategame/endgame.
---
people can stay in the midgame, and enjoy that for what it is. thats fine. i partially agree with you. capitals arnt the most fun, but owning a titan is and has to be referred to endgame.
---
i think its a bit shit tbh
---
I wish they’d stop with this false “riskvsreward” narrative they keep pushing. The risk does not match the reward in wormhole space. The risk does not match the reward in incursions or nullsec mining. What they should be focusing on is getting people to engage with one another but making those engagements fair. Rorquals should have never become a single mining platform. Yes, they should have placed the Rorquals in the belts. But instead of turning the rorqual into a massive mining platform; perhaps they should have made it a logi/buffer platform and carrier for miners to reship into pvp ships on the field.
---
Or a regular frigate with a spare mid for a bump mod.
---
I think you are confusing the term inflation.
---
A mining bot, salvaging bot, relic bot, etc. do not increase "income" or the supply of isk in the game.  Boosts to productivity also do not cause inflation (see buffs to rorqs).  Typically this is balanced out by population growth and innovation.  But we don't have this in Eve, so we get deflation.  
---
A good example is a typical Battleship would have cost you 400M back in the day, but now costs you 200M.  Your purchasing power has doubled (not been reduced).  Again, check the CPI in the MER which basically covers inflation.
---
No it wouldn't.
---
Look how much conflict there was last time goons left delve.
---
Sure, CCP have their fair share of blame to take. But it´s not like people haven´t been warning against the onedimensional playstyle and dogmas the null blocs and their newbie corps have been promoting for years. Now look at all these players, many of them years in the making, who can´t even deal with the most basic shit on their own.
---
&gt;How about that idea? 
---
People had that, they whined like fuck about it, so now we have the current system.
---
Nullbear tears best tears, keep it up.
---
No it doesnt. It tells you to get into capitals because you can be saved. Subcap ratting is basically russian roulette and no matter how cheap you go there is still a cost. And if you lose more than you make you are still going minus. Thats why it was counterproductive, it removed options.
---
Carriers can cyno in stuff which means you are safer. The cyno change is now changing it upwards to supers and multiboxing rorqs with recon alts, making NS even harder for new players. Which is yet again why its counterproductive. 
---
These changes will mainly drive out new players out of null and considering retention numbers were being held up by blocs this will hurt the game. People who have been around for a long time wont be affected as much.
---
He comes off as way more mature than you do right now
---
Why would I be mad?
---
And your opinion matters why?
---
Who said it did?
---
Look up Pandemic Horde. There's no requirement for joining and very newbro friendly.
---
You ain’t never dreamed about eve? I’ve woke up thinking one of my supers was tackled and raced to the computer. 
---
No I don’t know why I thought it was tackled since it was logged off....(pre keepstar era)
---
Leave me alone.
---
Ok, just so we're clear:
---
1. You have no analysis backed by data.
---
2. CCP has that data and did that analysis.
---
3. CCP says the data and analysis does NOT support your theory.
---
4. CCP doesn't know what it's talking about
---
5. You know more than CCP
---
Did I summarize your position correctly?
---
That's about what I thought:
---
* Make your ISK elsewhere
---
* Throw more € at CCP (and then wonder why you didn't just spend it on PLEX to sell for ISK) or bubble up in a dead end if you can
---
* Accept making less ISK/hr due to increased ship loss and/or less effective but cheaper fits
---
If CCP wanted to fix the snowballing power of big blocs it would be a two-step process:
---
* Change Rorqual so that there's a reason to field one, but no reason to field 10 per belt.
---
* Remove skill injectors.
---
As long as the top mining method scales linearly to tens of accounts and you can use the revenue to get more toons with no skill training delay, the snowballing will continue. The big will get bigger at increasing rate, full stop.
---
You didnt have a mining permit
---
I would say the same thing to you, yet you felt compelled to share it anyway.
---
Endgame refers to what you do when youve reached a certain age in the game. In other games that coincides with things you are saying but in eve, a titans isnt better than anything else, its just different. 
---
No it isnt. So everyone not having a titan is stuck in midgame mode? And they are trying to get a titan? Ships arent gear. Every ship has its use and different situations calls for different ships.
---
This is such a holesome thread, a little salt sparkled in but many epic posts overall. /u/ccp_falcon
---
Im allowed to respond to OP. Its kinda the point matey. You felt the need to respond to someone who responded to OP.
---
So thank you for the words. Now run along.
---
I'm just expressing my opinion in a perfectly respectful way, nothing more and nothing less. Not sure what you mean with that question to be honest... are you getting mad noone upvoted this or something?
---
BUY 👏 MORE 👏 SKINS
---
you are arguing semantics. you are fully aware what he´s on about. if you put all your bets on one horse you might find yourself in a sticky situation. especially when that one thing falls on the top of the sprectrum when it comes to time and effort invested.
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
Next change is citadel balance. These unfueled citadels spammed all over need fixing. Shouldn't be tethering to a non fueled structure. That's broken. Also Sov needs an entire overhaul . This system now doesn't work.
---
GENERAL
---
The game is still hard for new players to start if they dont have friends who already play and getting that help can be difficult. I found that what was best was to join a small corp that do things that you like doing and make friends their. Then if you want to go the big corps.
---
NULL CHANGES 
---
The null sec changes are great, makes my life much easier but also make you learn more faster. For example if see people people on dscan 1AU off when you in a 6/10 DED. Warp off and dont come back because there will most defiantly be a recon ship chilling to get you. RIP 2.1 Bil. 
---
CYNO
---
Again this change is great (also doesnt affect me) 
---
INVASION
---
Didnt bother with it, ISK returns are not worth unless you are doing the high level stuff but you need to good fits which newbros wont have.
---
I don't think CCP gives a crap about what you can and cannot live with.  This is CHAOS.  Not controlled chaos.
---
Very much this man. They are completely missing human behaviour and are stuck in equation mode. 
---
And ye, Rorqs should have been boosters. Not premier mining ships.
---
if you liked pking with a few dudes in osrs youd like a wh corp
---
Yep, unsubed my accounts yesterday.
---
But....don’t you have the be subbed to light a cyno????
---
So. The account in question....IS subbed....all you(the player) must do is stop selling the sp...or train that cyno character for a month or two.
---
It’s not the greatest news ever but.....is it a cash grab if you were already  subbed? And paying...and? 
---
Nope fuck it I’m gonna go throw vases around and smash my coffee cup too!
---
i like how this idiot (i can tag him as such as he seems to be fond of namecalling) thinks everything has to somehow be changed but only if it still doesnt change his playstyle. well boo fucking hoo pal - you either get your trio going (which is also retarded but you ll figure out why eventually) or just stop ratting like you already do you glue sniffing, drooling monkey. 
---
this is how the change is adapted to. or move out to hisec and triple box marauders in l4s.
---
Because shit tier nerds will still light them on anything they can undock. It gets old when every single ship you try to tackle has a cyno.
---
All WH gates are opened with no need to scan them down they just appear on scan like anomalies in and out of WH space.  That would be chaos..
---
I prefer to go by actual player experience and the server numbers rather than the clearly self-interested exclamations of CCP employees, yes.   If you don't that's simply because you're an idiot.
---
What did you invest towards?
---
Congrats on chosing "easy" as difficulty setting! :)
---
And if you envision null as high risk = high reward place, you will soon find out that there is no high risk inside a mega coalition.
---
I don´t blame you though, you informed yourself what the "best"/most efficient way to play the game is and you found it. :)
---
Daily reminder that minmatars run concentration camps. Unironically.
---
Yeah for sure, any you would recommend?
---
And Im saying hes wrong. There is no endgame in Eve, thats a fact. You choose what you want to fly. And honestly, Im starting to understand why people are bitching about caps so much. Its because people dont understand how they work if they think they are endgame ships. They really arent.
---
And ye thats fairly obvious. Nerfs and boosts are always a thing. But changing core mechanics is quite different.
---
Downvoted, suggestion needs more REEEE
---
Problem is since they allowed the multi omega accounts running. Taking it away now would piss off alot of people. That would be truely chaotic for the games "playerbase". We would finnaly see some real player counts lol.
---
Too hard for them, look how long it took to not allowed the venture into FW complexes.
---
Osrs is also always in drama! We even have a calendar. Keeps things interesting.
---
 But eve is drama with spaceships and it is just next level
---
Jesus it's like watching a chimp  lick it's own bum...
---
I am also allowed to respond to you, funny how that works isnt it?
---
god forbid - if everyone's ticks go down but yours are still bigger there's no change to the relative length of your e-peepee.   
---
I swear this change has brought all the stupid in the subreddit out of the woodworks (not you mate, I get the scarcasm - but i've seen your point being brought up in earnest :))) )
---
move - out - of - null
---
the risk of losing your sanity by submitting yourself to incursion coms sound like pretty high stakes to me.
---
&gt;Like maybe change it so cyno level 4 can use covert and let Astero's do covert cynos.
---
Someone has paid for those SP you are going to inject.
---
&gt;Says the only thing important in my life is eve
---
&gt;Has made an account **just for Eve**.
---
You're a low effort hypocrite who doesn't understand the meaning of salt. You're embarrassing yourself here. I'm not salty at all. You are deluded.
---
Imagine creating an account just for one sub, that's fucking tragic.
---
if it weeds out all the people who play basically a space version of candy crush and brings back even 1/3 of those 30 000 extra people that logged in in 2012 the game will become a much better place.
---
how about you reach out in your alliance/corp and get some more people with the same issue as you and group up with some pvp fits and some logi and run the damn sites - sure you will still get dropped from time to time but not ganked by a couple of solo lokis moving around like you would if you're alone.   
---
Try and play the fucking game, huh?
---
&gt; people then get stuck into thinking eve is free and its unfair to ask for a sub, subscriptions have kept this game going.
---
I know and subscription alone is not my problem. My problem is that you basically need to have account subscribed for a year and just train (probably best to just train and not play during that time) needed skills BEFORE you actually can start properly playing the game is what put me off. 
---
That and injectors which i see as a completely redundant p2w mechanic. Not to mention about a zillion of bots and people farming 12 rorqs making everything so much more expensive for the new guys.
---
All in all, i seem to lack the exact levels of autism needed in order to play long term (my levels might actually be too high).
---
&gt; I swear this change has brought all the stupid in the subreddit out of the woodworks      
---
True.    
---
You realize that, if we would share our ratting income, it would make isk generation in null even more useless? Why risk a 20B or 50B ship, when you can make more money in WH, Abyssals, Incursions, Market or wherever?
---
Thrashers
---
That'd be hilarious. The concurrent players metric would be 1/3 of what it is now
---
core mechanics get changed all the time. AoE DDs, Scanning, Moms, OGBs, Cits, ECM, Sov. You name it.
---
ye until it gets neuted or alpha'ed through ehp
---
I went to a British secondary school and unless if something has changed and you're not in Wales you don't have to take a second language at GCSE level. The majority of people I know can say bonjour and je voudrais un croissant and that's about it.
---
sell, extract, inject, drop, apply, game on
---
Realize what exactly? that its harder to make isk in nullsec. THATS EXACTLY THE FUCKING POINT DUMBASS lol ( i kind of apologize about this but i feel it might be necessary :S)
---
nullsec risk to reward was not 'balanced' it was far too heavy on the isk making side. i play the game too and live in nullsec. 
---
if its one attacker thats killing your rorquals youve got a serious issue, if one attacker can light a cyno and kill you all. mine inside a cyno inhib deployment area.
---
everyone in eve has to work together, you can use one alt each krabber to scout, defend etc, or collectively a group could share income with a dedicated human to do such jobs. you know, teamwork.
---
cloaks and dscan immune ships. both of which struggle for tank  unless built specificly for only that. and both of which show when jumping through a gate that is easily seen by a scout. also die to a group or caracals VERY easily.
---
we have already started having a few alts on grid in high alpha ships to defend from rats, bubblers, recons, hunters to reduce issues. 
---
and im not calling you a bitch, i bet, your one of them thats unhappy, voiceing your opinion which is great, but will keep playing, im saying the ones that leave, are bitches, and we didnt need them anyway :D the games growth and evolution needs changes like this. in 1-2 years youll say 'in the old day it was too easy' and but its so simple now you just have to:....
---
While they would almost definitely never do this (prove me wrong CCP, please), this could actually be super interesting. Let's say you're in a pocket system with only one gate. You destroy it, so the only way in and out is via cynos. Does the gate on the other side get destroyed too, or just unpowered until there's one it connects to? Would this be nullsec only, or for absolute maximum chaos, extend to low/highsec as well? (Almost certainly not Highsec since Concord exists, but it's a fun thing to think about.) What happens if, hypothetically, a single player destroys the gate in an unpopulated pocket nullsec system, then cyno's out with no one else in system and no cyno generator?
---
Let the cap traverse through a a abyssal room before coming out the cyno
---
I know this might sound really crazy... but have you tried being at the keyboard while you play the game?
---
More chaos, hopefully. Changing the meta forces new theorycrafting and keeps things fresh. It would be good if they also rebalanced ships every monthly patch as well, just to keep us on our toes (VNI was a great example). My real hope is that they will introduce reduced reinforcements on citadels (1 timer after RF), ability to kill low power citadels without an RF timer, and depleting resources.
---
If the account is subbed you're definitely paying money...
---
Climbing up the ladder slowly from subcap merc mining to rorqual, logi subcap to fax, and subcap dps to dread. 
---
And I did pve in between like ratting to salvaging and incursions to finance my ships. Null under player owned  alliances provided me with a better place to learn than Hi-Sec. But alas...
---
I'm totally down for this, if the sleepers came in and take out all the gates, leaving unstable wormholes for say a month or two it would then give the players time to build their own gate network.
---
Tech II Gates that once built cannot be destroyed, only put offline, and can be used by everyone, these would replace the current concord gates, the cool thing is players would decide where they go so the very face of eve would change as alliances create their own ideal pathways between the stars.
---
You can tag me anything you like, babe.     
---
I usually don't call other people dumb, but when they come here without a clue how nullsec works, and spout jUsT w0rK tOgEt8r dUh, I have to say it as it is.    
---
At least I'm not on your level of name calling.
---
you realize you're digging yourself deeper now.   
---
I will break it down for you, if you feel getting left behind just whistle and i'll come right back for you. It might be a complex argument but just take your time to assimilate it as you read.   
---
"how about you go do the thing that gives you max returns then, if making isk is your priority? Leave the spaceship flying to the people who also enjoy it. "   
---
let me know if you need it explained further, ta
---
People invested time and money to skill into hulks and then rorquals happened.
---
People invested a lot of time and money honing their subcap skills and then citadel happened.
---
Now it's time for capitals. vOv
---
Been playing Eve one and off for almost a decade. For the love of God, don't lose that love. If you start feeling burned out, take a step back &amp; figure out what made you feel like that. Perhaps try another way of making isk (null sec ratting / mining, incursions, missions, hauling, trading, etc). 
---
Don't lose that love, eve is an amazing game &amp; there is nothing else like it.
---
Shut down Concord response to attacks anywhere in high-sec. Unleash the hounds!
---
You should always give it a shot.
---
You want to be aware of a few things.
---
\- you will lose your ship. Not if, when. It will happen. Ships are like ammo. You lose one, you get another. Often inconvenient, frequently annoying, a fact of life in New Eden
---
\- Being able to fly the ship and being able to fit the ship properly for its role are two entirely different things. If you can’t fit the ship properly for what you want to do with it, you don’t want to fly the ship. It’s like eating Chicago-style pizza: what’s the point?
---
\- NEVER, under any circumstance, will you give money to an entity named CODE or its representatives so that you can put a ‘license’ in your bio. Nobody tells you what to do in EVE.
---
So rip going balls deep with a drop.
---
I like where your head is at
---
The intend of the joke was good though
---
Pretty much. If you get a big enough farm and buy PLEX/extractors at their low point, you can even make a profit for owning multiple alts.
---
in eve endgame doesnt have to be the 'best' as your correct in saying there is no 'best'
---
but ill repeat what i have said before,  ''endgame is generally referred to the largest, most expensive, hardest to get into or buy things that cannot get got until LATER on in the game. hence lategame/endgame.''
---
do you disagree with this statement
---
Cute. You believe anything of what you are typing here? Who in EVE makes isk in the least effective way, because they like it?
---
As it happens, I enjoy flying supers. I also enjoy making my isk while flying supers - sometimes.  How about you leave me to the things I enjoy, instead of telling me to go to fucking high sec?
---
This is the point I've been making, though of course I was downvoted for suggesting I'd unsubbed.
---
Eve won't survive the same player numbers it had a month after beta ended (2,500 or thereabouts - I was one of them).  So jog on.
---
Starting drama is a right of passage in eve
---
lol yea it's gonna go like -   
---
hunters come in, enemy pilgrim lights cyno and anchors inhib -  you wait for response fleet to be ready, your own pilgrim decloaks lights cyno, random dread locks and oneshots it. You now have a fax and a couple of caps (that managed to click on time) on field and the other side has the whole fleet. Good going my man, go for the holy trinity of fax, super and recon :))   
---
Imagine the level of precision required for your rescue fleet to jump all in during all the 5-10 ticks your cyno ship will be alive, we will laugh for ages at the results.
---
I mean, long term they would benefit from a healthy game, no?
---
You are wrong. There is a new type of Triglav called Recon Damavik that spawn randomly in a highsec system and roams through nearby systems killing anything in belts or moons.
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/52645/
---
Rather just not pay the sub thanks.
---
Remove damage caps
---
&gt;The fastest and easiest way (especially since blackout began) has always been exploration. It's entirely possible to pay for your subscription in a single day if you get lucky enough.
---
They can't cloak though, so they'll die a lot to people who just hunt herons for fun in tengus/Lokis/stratios' and likely have that loot stolen. 
---
&gt;Beyond that, incursions pay well enough (although this has become harder since incursions were nerfed) to PLEX fairly quickly.
---
Yup.
---
&gt;Alphas used to be able to do L4 missions, which paid enough to make it possible to plex consistently with enough effort, but are now limited to L3 missions. Still possible, but really not worth the time investment and effort compared to other options.
---
Same, T3 abyss is an option too, but it's fuck all reward. 
---
&gt;Finally, gas huffing. Huffing is profitable enough that alphas are able to plex using them with a pretty fair amount of effort and time investment.
---
Yeah this is a solid option.
---
&gt;Edit: An additional activity I totally forgot was a thing despite doing it a lot a few months ago: hunting DED sites. Even in highsec, DED sites are pretty profitable and alphas can run 4/10s in T1 cruisers no problem.
---
Not done high sec DED sites, so I'll take your word on that. 
---
They can't trade as profitably as an omega either, so while 0.01 isking vs bots is an option, it'll take longer to see significant profit
---
But yeah it's a significant task to earn enough ISK to Plex for alpha's now. It likely will be a massive grind, especially for a casual player.
---
Ofcourse not. 
---
We have 2 restrictions here:
---
1. It should be viable tool for skill provider to invest into people
---
2. It shouldnt be better for alt making
---
It means that penalties for taking sp back must b worse than buying skill extractors and dealing with skill injector penalties (decreasing amount of sp given for certain levels of skill points)
---
I couldn't agree with this more.  Also add from old vet perspective, don't be afraid to go back to things you've enjoyed in the past.
---
well it seems you don't really enjoy flying supers otherwise you wouldn't be against flying them in a lEsS tHaN OpTimaL ratting setup just to get to fly them (and make some isk in the process).   
---
What you seem to be concerned with is that your supers are no longer the best way of making isk in game, which is a pretty weak argument.
---
I agree with you its really shitty. 
---
I know there is a crusade against AFK activity right now but lets be real here afk mining in highsec isn't making anyone filthy rich. The mineral volume is completely negligible compared to nullsec and its a chance to interact with the game while also working on other things.
---
I get it CCP doesn't want me to go afk and mine. Well that pretty much just means that at times when you need to go afk or focus on other tasks you'll just stay docked or logged off instead of being out in space.
---
You probably already put some numbers in my suggestion, when all I was suggestion is a formula
---
I did 3 years of Spanish at school in the UK. 
---
Can't remember a word of it and couldn't tell you anything about the language structure. 
---
So I'm not totally convinced the UK system works.
---
Youve just reiterated the same thing as before about faucet's. Honestly untill ccp actually gets proper analytics we won't know. The MER doesn't care where the isk was generated only how. So everything that is sold to npc falls under this category. Even overseer effects from NS.
---
So from my perspective ccp can't even give us a solid answer to how much is is actually being generated because they don't have clear enough analytics. I know how much isk a c5 is worth but I'm telling you a solo super inside two days can beat that income. Whs anoms don't spawn like NS ones your lucky if you get a bill or two in sites a week maybe a bit more. The trick is rolling your status to raid other holes and this isn't usually done for c5 content unless we're talking hard knocks or Lazer Hawks. Or the odd solo guy. Look at April's mer. Faucet's,  commodity vs bounty.. it's half at best. Less if you exclude overseers and trade items like abyss filliments. The isk faucet is anoms in NS. Honestly incursions probably bring more raw isk into the game than whs do..  
---
The rorqs do have a scale ability problem they are to easy to afk and set another one up vs barges micro. They need to be limited somehow per belt but that's a really agressive approach
---
I see your point about the small guys will move out and find something else. Fuck I already did just before blackout hit. But I don't like NS and now that locals gone I'll move back to my wh.
---
Hm, sounds like good gameplay for one side. I guess we should all delete our caps right now and be done with it. Everybody just flies bombers and drops on things without repercussions.
---
If you use that cyno , you have to Jump back trough it within 10 minutes, otherwhise your ship explodes :D
---
Adapt or die.
---
I did German for 4 year, and the only phrase i can remember is Ich scheissen auf den kasekuchen.
---
Which is amussing, but not very helpful day to day
---
But why? XD the blackout is one thing bit the cyno changes just force you to use more isk for a cyno ship and check your intel/dont cyno solo. At least use cyno beacons. If you play solo you are never safe, with or without changes
---
Can get a widow much higher. Especially when shield slaves come
---
I think the only thing that needs to change is pEoPle nEEd tO pLaY tOgeTHer - you know, like the people dropping bombers on you are
---
What like trying to insult people using a language you can't use well?
---
To me this is the same as when people say "your stupid".
---
Do the recons scram? Because some of those Orca losses are hard to comprehend, unless you land on a rock and go off to work for the whole day and never look at your screen.
---
And the fits...
---
Probably just check out the eve jobs sub and hop in discords of interesting groups

Maybe you should consider that the Dark ages might just be dark relatively. Knowledge was forgotten, ideas were suppressed and depopulation. While the term might've been invented by people who thought they were better, the fact still remains that western europe was in a lot more turmoil than it was during Roman reign.
---
Oh shit you're gona get so many good boy points!!!
---
That now needs Cyno 5 and a Frigate to 5 or a force recon skill to use it. I can't speak for everyone but my alt account is my titan (insert carrier, dread, fax, jf alt here) since the skills kept rolling in (years before you could use SP) so my accounts have 1 "main" and two cyno alts. So I have to stop training on my mains to train these cyno alts to move up, which wouldn't be awful, except based on the times given, I will have to either buy SP to get them to that level, or just wait out doing anything until they catch up.
---
What happens is wormholes. The tools already exist to never lose full access to a system.
---
English is easy, every language has bizarre grammar exceptions to its own rules, but most languages have *more* rules (which means more exceptions) than English. Portuguese, for instance, has about twice as many tenses, is a gendered language (so twice the articles, twice the adjectives and more), has two different forms of "to be" (é = something that permanently "is" and "está" = something that currently/temporarily is "is" and all of the tense variations for these two), three classes of verbs based on how their endings in the infinitive tense (probably the rule with the most exceptions), "-ar", "-er" and "-ir", and hell, I'm pretty sure I have barely scratched the surface of how complex the language is. 
---
I learned English as a second language just by playing video games and watching movies in English with English subtitles on. This didn't work for any other language I tried.
---
Holy shit, your "discussion" style is just so pathetic.      
---
    
---
Anyway, since you know nothing about our fittings: Non suicidal pilots fly in fully tanked supers since the blackout. So we already took a hit to our tIcKs. Don't let anything stop you narrative. You're elite.
---
Text and logo are low contrast and half on the ships, makes it very hard to read.
---
Whatever set of effects/filters you used on that capture are doing a very harsh thing on most the ship, it’s confusing to look at.
---
Love the message, y’all deserve all the vengeance  you feel necessary.
---
I could go about my "life" in Eve normally without even looking at those. This one is going to be somewhat difficult to do that with.
---
and this is a big issue with new eve players, they feel skillpoints 'win' eve, they do not.
---
infact if you do just that ''do not play and leave skills training'' this will negatively affect your in game ability MASSIVELY. you need to practice, die, test to know not only what to train for, but what to do, what not to do. skill points give you nothing but new ships and modules. eve is not like other MMO's that Strictly better gear means you win, its infact almost the oppastie, yes th better gear is better, but skill can overcome every situation above modules. and max skilled toons (if you can call them that) still use t1, meta, hulls and modules because they in some cases are just fine for what they need.
---
i will agree, you maybe could AFK train 2months? but after that, playtime is required.
---
you find this with skill injectors, me, ive used it to finish caldari cruiser 5, yet i already had all the other cruisers to 5, does this give me a huge advantage over you? no, im just in another ship.
---
there is players who start fresh, and inject into ships theyve never flown seen or have any idea how to fit, and the majority of the playerbase who have LEARNT the game not bought the game laugh and those paying to skill players usually fizzle out in frustration becuase money is not like a World of Tanks tank, where only available with IRL money and has thicker armour, better weapons, faster,
---
no, all ships are balanced (fuck you triglavians), and counterable. 
---
for the majority of my playtime 'Mordu Legion' ships were considered overpowered, and known as 'Balanced Legion' funny right, did everyone fly these, no. were they strong and OP. yes, at least before thier recent nerf they were. theyre still strong in all the same ways, but a powergrid reduction meant IF they get caught they would die easier. (they are a kitey fast ship with long tackle range)
---
If you skill injected into max skills in a Mordu Legion ship would you get kills, no id be shocked if you killed anything more than 1 cheap frigate before death, even that tbh, that is because you have no IRL skill. no practice. kills in eve are earnt (well most of them) and killmails is an eve players PVPers dream each time, how many to kill. who did the most damage, who tackled. who did somthing that got the kill best. which is skill. not skillpoints
---
Please stop projecting your insecurities on a public forum
---
Thanks!!!
---
Often they are mad at anime, for some reason
---
why didnt they have defender missiles?
---
haha oh my god mUh TiCKs !   
---
this is delicious my good dude. Don't be upset, it's just a game, I'm snorting out loud here   
---
they took a hit to their ticks, the delve time unit has gone down, oh god what do :)))))
---
New to jump drives.  Presumably if I’m tackled I can’t jump to a cyno. 
---
When can I not do it? Bubbled? Webbed? Or just pointed?
---
Yes, I used tIcKs ironically. Sorry it flew over your smooth brain.
---
Is that a hypothetical IF CCP was bankrupt? Because hypotheticals don't make for a strong argument unless they aren't... hypothetical. Because that's what it is. Not true.
---
I can't really judge you there when I dreamed my Marshal was in armor and woke up in a panic. I don't even own a Marshal.
---
Очень сложно до свидания
---
me and you cannot be sure it is true or not. so it is hypothetical, however highly likely and possable.
---
is that an answer completely ignoring the question? because if thats what it is, i think were done here
---
Don't worry about CCP having a long term master plan, CCP can't plan shit.
---
I think it was mid 14 into 15 where we lost I'm the neighborhood of 20,000 players. That time frame sounds about right.
---
Ever since then eve has never recovered to what it was like pre early 2013 and before, and I doubt it ever will be that good again.
---
Well yeah they are using "chaos era" to test out all the dramatic changes they've always wanted to try. Personally, I think blackout in null should stay. Other changes could be reverted completely or dialed back depending on how they play out. But its 100% excuse to make massive changes.
---
How DARE you throw a coffee cup?! Those sacred objects are known to contain the elixir of the Gods!
---
Im sorry i didnt understand a word you fucking said and english is my first language, well, aussie but close enough.
---
Nothing wrong with that IMO. Letting T1 BS light would at least give them a rile. If anything I don't think force recons should be able to light regular cynos besides Blops, since it circumvents a lot of the difficulties in moving a cyno by just allowing covops cyno moved by bomber &gt; cynonin force recon &gt; regular cynos.
---
So much fun in Delve
---
the fuck are you talking about? I was universally considered to be the worst fucking student in my class ( am not native to an english speaking country so i was doing lessons in cram school ) still I managed to pass my exams with flying colors just by listening to music and playing video games. english is retarded easy and thats why most of us can more or less communicate in it
---
Eh, ran majors and a world ark with a gnosis in fleet before. All a matter of being organized really.
---
So then tell me exactly how to train 10 cyno alts to use covert ops ships and cyno in 1 month when it's a 3 month training queue and also needing 7 MCTCs without buying them or injectors which all use plex in some form and mean more cash for CCP?
---
Or, get this, go to highsec and run missions, because a Myrm makes like 13 million ticks before alliances taxes.
---
world changing event where people cant make isk, they can only fight for it.
---
Its not like we hadnt been asking people to try since wwb
---
i typed the same thing as a response to the guy, stupidly ez language. i am at the process of learning french now and i really have to sit down and pay attention otherwise i drown in the grammar and the spelling
---
you sir are a failure if your mining in hisec in goons.
---
yea well, we integrated it into the cloud using block-chain and now its called "think tanking"
---
Three years of GSM, game goes completely to shit. Two months of Olmeca, game isn't so shit anymore.
---
For the love of god shut up.
---
You are the first that actually answers to this complaint without autistic screeching;) Thanks for that.
---
I would say quite alot would venture into that direction. Since you can use quite some skills for other stuff. But yes, the problem would be quite less obvious and disastreos (the fuck i give up with this word). Nevertheless, eventually we would get to the same problem.
---
On the other hand, it gives new players a chance to catch up. 
---
I'm in brand newbros, and I've seen people come, and work hard and get their first capital within a year, and a titan within 2. It is a part of the problem, but these players would not have been able to play the endgame for another 5 years, and be dominated by the few bittervets around
---
Dumb idea. Limiting injector use IS limiting CCP revenue. Next
---
This TBH. with extractors it's very easy to retool your character and find a new pack to roam with.
---
he means people are leaving the game to go back to irl
---
No its a sandbox with mechanics that are subject to change. Maybe we can have Eve classic your types :D
---
preposterous!
---
Have you tried learning russian? Fucking nightmare. Ive learned both german and english! But when i tried russian... Well... I know how to cuss in russian, but thats about it
---
R/EVE Eve online 2006 to 2018 #Eveisdying
---
CCP: 2019 Hold my beer. watch this
---
Good
---
Yea the problem with this is it makes space unusable for a period of time (as you've said) Fallow farms work because you take a section of farm and leave it for a season, it's planned that way. No one stays there. So you either have a system of locusts moving to a fresh feeding ground (and with at least 3-4 mega blocks, those will run out quickly) or sov entities will engage in their own fallow fields, turning off constellations to let them regen or some such. The only one that leads to massive conflict is going to be when the locusts hit each other over the last few "good" areas. But it would likely be a small skirmish because the first ones are coming around again to "good".
---
How much do you think Myrm ratters make per hour?
---
There's a reason we are giving out Myrms for free to reduce the isk strain on players before they can upship into a carrier. If players without caps have to JC back to highsec for money they aren't joining fleets.
---
Use Caldari navy Vespas, way better tank and better application than t2. 
---
Also always take light drones, my first ship loss to a l4 was because the frigs stopped me from warping, I burned out my target painter overheating and my drones couldn't hit them. 
---
Check eve survival for a guide for every l4 mission. Feel free to ask for help on any in particular. 
---
Can post your fit and people here will help too.
---
Fuck off mate, Aussies don't speak English. That's for those pommy cunts.
---
Dumbest idea? Take out local and make all space 0.0, remove asset saftey and concord. Make npc stations destruct-able, Jita 4-4 included.
---
that my friend, is an issue goonswarm will have to endure, along with EVERYONE ELSE fairly.
---
sorry, i dont see an argument. ''i cant make isk easy and risk free' just doesn't make the cut
---
I actually had some mistakes and I ended up ranting a bit, so it's a huge sentence. I edited the minor mistakes out, but I can't be bothered to split the sentence right now.
---
Thank you. That was a lot of great information.
---
I really don’t understand all the kvetching over paying a subscription. Here’s a challenge: take the money you pay for a month of EVE and go out drinking with the boys. How long does your money last? Did you make it into the second hour?
---
nothing else i ment :P
---
If you think there is a plan you might be missing the point.
---
The null blocs aren't promoting the playstyle. CCP did. CCP are solely responsible for the state that the game mechanics are in. Not so hands on at first. But it was their oversight. But then quite literally PROMOTING it. Advertising it. Here. Rorquals. Mine away. Start today fly super capitals tomorrow. Everybody look come here come all we have massive spaceship battles and we're going to make more of them. But of course that never happened because for too long they obviously had no understanding of what they turned the game into. That's one problem but they won't even admit they have no clue. They aren't going to fix anything or listen to anybody when they can't even come to that realisation. They didn't know what to do then and they just as likely don't know what they're doing now. People have perfectly good reason to be concerned about their motives. There are so many good ideas within this community that actually begin to address the core problems but CCP aren't interested in solving problems they just want to kick over sandcastles and see what happens. It's desperation. You've got Falcon literally calling a guy a salty krab for just asking an honest question. You don't need to be on my side of the fence to be concerned with how CCP are choosing to address things. They got greedy and they fucked it all up.
---
You forgot to add heating to your ship. You froze to death
---
You sir, have just listed pretty much everything ive been trying to say to others but fail. mostly due to my writing skills, my aggressive personality etc.
---
this is exactly how i feel, and i know others do.  Eve is eve, and i love it for that, eve has always had these changes, and its been SSOOOO stagnant for too long people have become stationary.
---
&lt;3 this post!!!
---
No high reward either for the most part.
---
You show the dumbest attitude. You are mixing up specific rights you have under the EULA as a customre and free speech. I am a paying customer and there's free speech. If am dissatisfied about something I am free to express that, regardless of my hard rights that lack any enforcements abilities vis a vis CCP to change the game. Whether CCP takes any suggestions or complaints into consideration is a different matter, but I am free to express them. 
---
So fuck you.
---
% chance that your cyno brings in Drifters
---
Oh god, you are still here. You know who also plays together? Goonswarm. Especially the guys who drop on things, that dropped on things. Believe it or not, we are in a fleet and on comms together.
---
But as you just pointed out, it will be pretty hard to defend ratting supers in the future. So, ironically, CCP is nerfing our cooperative gameplay.
---
&gt; Some ideas on this:
---
So in conclusion then, you want Goons to be able to even more easily project their power around the map.
---
Great idea.
---
To mine in high sec? Why would anyone want to do that?
---
When their performance bonus is assessed and paid in Mid October as part of the Pearl Abyss acquisition deal.
---
At least in my opinion these changes have had nothing to do with improving the overall health of the game, and everything to do with driving up whatever metric said performance bonus is dependent on.
---
They had this 3month mtc for 1€ some weeks ago... why didnt I buy it to my cyno account oh why???
---
And if you're paying, you're training things. That will now take longer this costing you more money
---
The good guys win again
---
You better be watching the ashes right now or shut your pie hole.
---
Nah man. I've already started dropping my caps with a recon on roaming gangs. What they have planned is literally perfect as is. The recon is indestructible with fax on it. Best part is the cyno is only 5 mins. Triage and siege cycle happens to match up too
---
I'm still waiting on hello kitty ears for my character to wear in game as well as matching skins
---
You sound like you'd love wormhole space
---
Injectors are the biggest problem in the game and they have been the biggest problem since they where released and now they bring the cyno changes/nerf. I dont blame CCP for it I BLAME PEARL ABYSS being GREEDY FUCKS
---
Removal of all structures including citadels and pos in wormholes.
---
*"Ist Ihre Tochter achtzehn, bitte?"*
---
LMAO CCP really has their bits out here farming hisex miner tears?
---
Cyno should spawn asteroids
---
&gt; what's with the attitude
---
*?
---
If brute force doesn't solve your problem you're not using enough of it.
---
Or you could’ve got the 3 month sub + free 3 month MT (no cert, applied directly) when they offered it about a month ago as part of the invasion ... retrospect I suppose.
---
This is the main issue that I see as well, it is going to be prohibitively difficult to bring in secondary tackle. This raises the bar as to which groups are able to hunt in lowsec and seems like it would encourage hunters to group up rather than stay small and dispersed.
---
Additionally, striking behind enemy lines becomes nigh impossible as the time it would take to bring in even a light dictor that was not with the initial cyno is now longer than the time to warp for mwd supers.
---
The two levels of hunter escalation necessary to start a play is prohibitive to gameplay. Bring back cyno tackle.
---
Cynos should spawn Concussion Bombs
---
Cyno should spawn lances doomsdays and boson
---
&gt;Carriers can cyno in stuff which means you are safer.   
---
As someone who kills carrierpilots who think their ship is a safe tanky cyno because they're  caps on a daily basis - they arent. Even under the delve umbrella killing regular carriers isn't a hard thing to do. All you do is painting a target on yourself because you fly a 2-4b ship (depending on fit) that is still easily killable by your average bomber/stuka fleet.
---
LOL I can't imagine you're actually in frat, but this is just the botting guys and AFK cap ratting guys still bitching. I've moved on.
---
in the end when you really love subcaps you can fly all stuf anyway and you see the doctrines as come and go.
---
It's a company. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there's a great pride individuals at ccp have in the artistry or operation of the game, but CCP as an entity itself has the goal of making money. Subscriptions and skins and any of their money making ventures keep the lights on, their employees fed and reasonably happy. Everyone points fingers away from themselves with these things, as though they're not part of a problem. Some people probably buy injectors because they want to "be good" fast, the lazy way. Others probably do it in direct response to the habits and actions of other players ("It's Friday, I've had a long week, just got paid, and if I spend twenty bucks I can have a covert ops explorer tonight instead of ten days from now and I can explore in much greater peace and enjoy myself). 
---
The ecosystem and culture of the game is obviously one that supports using cash to make the in game milestones a little easier. If you don't like those things don't participate in them, be the change you want to see. The attitude of this games players is starting to remind me of all the 20 something's out there who bitch about the real world system endlessly but don't vote because "one vote doesn't matter".
---
Nice strawman...  No paying is voluntary, not like anyone said it wasn't.
---
You keep tilting at those windmills.  it may sway some of the slower readers.
---
Spinning in station doesn’t count! Haha
---
Nah i'm not in frat  i just always try to use the most triggering flair
---
1 mintue
---
by the way, nullblocs pushing newbees from t1 myrms into carriers straight away is kinda what has ruined the game for thousands of players (including the actual newbees themselves)
---
and this meta has to stop. how do you suppose they can enforce that?
---
lol just realized you're also on this thread, good going my dude :)))  
---
I find it hilarious, yet painful from a rational standpoint, how far you will go to defend what is simply "a" playstyle which is even something pretty recent, compared to the history of the game. There's some very high-risk mental gymnastics going on within your series of arguments, but I'm bored at work and you're very cheap entertainment so I'll stick around to see what other convoluted mental furballs you're going to spew around :)))   
---
you will not be able to super rat - it is kinda how it is. You can take that "multiple cynos", "several recons on grid" etc and just throw it in the trash. I think you will have to reconsider at least a part of your playstyle - painful (maybe, if you're stubborn, lazy, afraid of new, slave to comfort) yet not something out of ordinary for eve (and actually for most live titles).
---
you are paid by Stainguy?
---
pretty sure that site was having trouble pulling all the kills for a long time now.
---
There are plenty of places to make isk easy and risk free, such as wormholes, FW button circling, and highsec missions.
---
According to Zkill, all of C5 space combined has around the same value killed/month as delve, while shtting out a lot more isk compared to the MER.
---
What do the experts say?
---
Another man of culture, I see. o7
---
Disconnects and broadcasting late can mean you lose your ship. 
---
Rolling a wormhole and farming sites makes exponentially more. Where is the risk there?
---
and new player's who can'T do their soa missions without finding trigs hunting or camping them no joke xD
---
wormholes dont have local, or cynos AT ALL. so what exactly is your point? they do it, why cant you
---
But muh scanning skills!!!
---
SP comes from veterans extracting their skills and selling it for plex or isk, only alpha clones can buy SP for cash.
---
I'm completely ok with throwing money at CCP, as I have done so a number of times, but plexing 15+ accounts each month is more money than I want to give to CCP at this time. It's like have a crystal meth tweaking cousin - sure at first you gave him $60 for his broken car or food or something, but after a while you cut that to barely $5 (if at all) b/c you know he's just gonna hit the pipe again.
---
&gt;CCP Falcon wouldnt have a job trying to implement them for you
---
You couldn't pick a bigger miss.
---
You tell me. I guess we'll all live in WHs soon.
---
Was everyone then flying the same kind of things before injectors? Did you have Armageddons, Bhaalgorns, T3Ds, etc everywhere and then they drop caps in LS? Maybe that's why I feel that I needed to rush T2 Battlecrusier fit, but also maybe I'm just overestimating what I need to be in to help. I've been a quality bait cyno with a tanky gnosis (seems like that's about gone though) and I can do good fast tackle on gate with double sebo 2.
---
Correct, although interesting corollary was that if you had enough ships using missiles you could, in theory, skip the armour timer.
---
For example, take a ton of phoenixes with XL cruises and sit them as far away as possible and fire salvos at the tower. Even though you can no longer lock the tower after it bleeds armour, the missiles still in flight do in fact still damage it.
---
I think it's an impracticality, but you could certainly kill an unhardened small tower this way. As far as I know, it was not a commonly used tactic though.
---
Look at you, hating highsec and such. It is so great that you are triggered from part of the game you are actually trying to play. I bet you are getting triggered whenever you have to travel through high sec or go to Jita. Keep the salt flowing boi.
---
yeah ushra'khan the good old rp days are over but anyway take my isk and kill cva/amarrs wherever you find them!
---
Bonus points to you, sir, for using 'its' correctly - something not many English people do.
---
also when you are in wh's dont forget to praise bob and love the isk you make!
---
Actually could be cool if CONCORD ONLY existed in Uedama, Niarja etc. Call it a response to drifters/triglavs, a display of strength against pirates or whatever lore bullshit you want. But they're so laser focused on those couple of high sec chokes there is no CONCORD anywhere else in highsec. Imagine hauling through highsec and those systems being the places you feel safest along the journey.
---
Witnessed
---
please tell me, a 15+ account tech 2 industrial complex veteran, about plexing multiple accounts
---
&gt; I'm bored at work and you're very cheap entertainment so I'll stick around to see what other convoluted mental furballs you're going to spew around
---
Tough luck. I got work to do, your discussion style is still shit and this whole thing has run its course anyway. See you in Delve.
---
Wrong, anybody can buy the DLC pack with 1m SP. It's actually pretty cheap too.
---
Of course wormholes can do it, but they "do it" at around 3-5x the isk/hour for similar scale stuff.
---
I think it is great that you can judge a persons social life based on their reddit account. Now THAT is pathetic. Says a lot about you actually. You really think joining more subs makes you more social? I have a life outside of reddit bro. Can't say the same about you. Keep the salt flowing boi. I am LOVING it.
---
So like wormholes? The more anoms you complete in your system the less the spawn?
---
Best of luck with that, you can only fit industrial ships in Rorquals SMB.
---
After a massive disruptive event in the matrix of the universe, special dimensional wormholes begin to open in lowsec making links between Tranquility and Serenity.
---
when volta meets graduate poor eve uni :/
---
remove the undock button, make NC. great again.
---
they also do it only being able to move around using buttholes. and this area only supports such a small population. if its so good, move goonswarm into a wormhole. see how that goes xD
---
Maybe the idea is that you shouldn't be yolo'ing around in a cap solo.  Capital ships should be supported by a group, even the act of moving them
---
I'd like to thank [Strong Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc2udEpyPpU) for that one.
---
When I first heard about Eve, about 10 years orso ago, I heard several things "Eve is dying" and "Impossible to get into".
---
In that regard, nothing has changed, I still hear those same things. I don't agree with either of them, though
---
Yeah, the Triglavian invasions are especially brutal for newbies. They can pop up very close to starter career agent systems and will blow up unsuspecting newbies very quick. Frigates/destroyers are pretty much helpless against them. A lot of times the only thing you can do is sign off.
---
Then dont play with 15 accounts. Also you can extract and pay for a large chunk of the sub. Like say you need 10b for pvp a month, thats like 100 bucks. Depending on your job thats like 1 day of work at most. If you were to rat that money in a hel it would take you like 30 hours.
---
Cue sudden wh usefulness
---
What if any k-space system without a gate connection gained a c1 static? Would let folks probe for a way to cyno in.
---
This will of course literally never happen but I enjoy the thought experiment.
---
lol
---
I used it last night on my falcon ( that now has a purpose !!!!) To boson a wormholer gang
---
It was awesome and I love the 5 minute cyno
---
&gt;No. I would have roughly 1/3rd of the available SP I currently have
---
So after 2 years, you have more than 90mil SP? At an unoptimized 2000 SP/hr, as long as you're constantly training, you get 17.5m sp per year, so you should have 35m sp after 2 years. So, you bought 60m's worth of SP? You spent (at minimum, but much more since you don't get 500m sp per skill injector) 120B on skill injector in 2 years?
---
35m sp is plenty enough to get good skills in all T2 cruisers and some T2 frigates, with mostly T2 modules (probably some weapons systems still at T1, which means maybe 10% less DPs on those weapons? Nothing that would cripple you).
---
&gt;I would not have a T2-capable dread alt, I would not have a carrier pilot
---
Before injectors, you simply would've bought those at the character bazaar and they would have cost a similar cost to what you spent injecting them. You just wouldn't have an experienced player buying 100s of dread pilots and seeding every single system in Delve with them (like what Olmeca Gold and Mar5hy did).
---
&gt;At the end of the day, what matters is the number of accounts you can PvP with
---
Agreed and now you have people like Olmeca Gold with 100s of dread pilots, most experienced players in wormhole having 5-10 alts (as long as you don't have a potato computer, it's actually pretty easy using that many alts during structure bashes)
---
&gt;All I hear is someone grouchy that other people can have capital ships and T3Cs
---
Just shows how you haven't read a word of what I said. I'm all for newbros getting more SP early on. If you get into a T3C quicker it means that, as a fleet mate I get a capable pilot sooner and as your enemy, I get more frequent content. The problem is that skill injectors that you can use for whatever you want aren't and shouldn't have been the solution. Every single complaint that you see in the forums about capital balance, citadel balance, the whole reason that the chaos era is necessary has as a root cause, skill injectors. 
---
Why are there too many caps? Skill injectors that let you inject hundreds of pilots if you want. You also get to keep them subbed for free if that's all you're going to use the char for.
---
Why is super ratting or Rorq mining under a content denying super umbrella the current best strategy? Skill injectors let's you accumulate that many supers and Rorqs, with the alts needed to support them. Super ratting happened before injectors, but it was risky because you couldn't just cyno in a fleet to save you as easily as you can today.
---
Why is the dominant strategy in wormholes having 5-10 alts to both seed so many systems and why is the most effective C6 farming FOF Ravens? Skill farming let's you keep as many alts as you want subbed for essentially free. Why risk a dread and logis when you can risk a bil's worth of assets using 5 FOF Raven pilots. Before skill injectors, it just wasn't worth it to sub 5 alts for 75$/month, on top of your regular chars.
---
cool man good joob keep up the good work!

I mean, if this afk-crusade comes with a reduction of tritanium needed for T1 Ships and Modules production, I cheer. But right now tritanium is really annoying to get enough of. Mining Veld in Null really feels like wasted Time and constantly freighting in loads of compressed Veld is also pretty annoying.
---
&gt; I assume that's due to the cyno change announcement but I cant imagine that many idiots bought the wrong recons.
---
Could be *one* idiot bought a **lot** of the wrong recon. :D

''English... the worst... all the damn exceptions....''

No one is going to fight goons. It's a krabbing alliance purely.

Now goon sigs that's another story. Those are fun to wreck.

which channel? *asking for a friend for research porpoises*

yeah 1m sp doesnt mean squat
---
So, sell people skins and shit.
---
Don't try and grab more money so they can do what they were already doing?
---
People will pay if they are getting something for their money. They've already paid to train their original cyno alts. Essentially demanding more money for them is a cash grab.

Have this updoot for bad puns. Please leave now.
---
If despite the grammar mistakes you understand the insult directed at you it still works, people don't need a perfect use of a language to insult others that use it effectively... in real life often a gesture is enough.
---
Even if people don't write "you are stupid" properly it doesn't change the fact that they called you stupid. In your particular case I'm guessing they'd also be right.
---
Why would they ever put a limit on how much money they make? No company would ever do this unless it's ran by a completely incompetent moron. So this should be implemented with haste.
---
You light the cyno and then triglavians flood out to kill everything. The number of triglavians depends on whats on the grid when you light the cyno.
---
How do we know that's not the case in this screenshot though?
---
Remove caps
---
would be hilarious if these recons would blap the polarized cats before they blap the mining barge
---
Bless your soul for not posting about cyno changes. Instead, you post this nice video showing an easy and cost efficient way to get into pvp.
---
What's that old line? Something about how when an EVE player quits to play WoW the IQ of both communities goes up

To avoid getting ganked by NPCs on steroids maybe?

What's the movie called?

Vanilla and TBC were the best incarnations but.... I've done it all before.

CCP falcon read this and is posing the question to Hilmar right now. The answer is "I have no clue lmao"

You're no longer supposed to train 10 throwaway cyno alts. 
---
At least that's the vibe I'm getting from CCP.
---
login numbers atm are like 2006 and declining.
---
i was considering playing WoW classic but these changes are trying their best to keep me hooked in EEV
---
Except when its a dino, then only the eve online one goes up ;)

A walk sir

Pressed downvote button instead. Seemed more appropriate.

has that corp ever been in tishu by chance?
---
dammit!

No, they don't. I think they do neut, though...
---
11 days, boys !
---
That's a pretty good idea, actually. Better than CCP's idea.
---
&gt;I think it is great that you can judge a persons social life based on their reddit account. Now THAT is pathetic. Says a lot about you actually.
---
...You literally claimed eve was the only thing important in my life?? 
---
And then said I have no friends and a bunch of other immature bullshit.
---
If you can somehow garner that from my posting, the fact you have an account for a single sub says exponentially more about you. 
---
I'm using your own methods of judging people, and you can't take it. 
---
&gt;Keep the salt flowing boi. I am LOVING it.
---
Calling someone who's exposed you salty doesn't make it true. Where is this salt? Feel free to quote it. 
---
If you truly made this account to try and get salt, I'd recommend deleting it and starting fresh, cause you're really not good at it. Hell just flair yourself as a goon and you'll get more salt than you've managed here.
---
nah thats a ragnarok
---
No not really, this isn't a thing as long as citadels are as strong defensively as the are. Even if the main blob moved away. If you have keepstars in your own space, a capital move-op is very very safe.
---
What you'll see is alliances living in a region, then claiming 2-3 more regions as "theirs" and just holding on to the space with some citadels.
---
Sure smaller groups can hit the sov, but that sov isn't in use and since those smaller groups don't plan to hold the space, can be retaken before when the blob plans to move. Since everyone and their mother has a capital, move ops can bring along a lot more stuff than they used to.
---
But then my dream of a titan fleet volleying a citadel with doomsdays would never happen :(
---
nope he didnt i did cause you didnt pay for a wallet permit!
---
Can confirm...we literally fought a war for the right to ban it on our discord/forums....actually it never really ended. #team20
---
I have one Omega and ~5 Alpha alts, all purpose-skilled. While my gaming experience is more limited than others, I don't feel entirely limited *and* I'm able to jump into a character and have a different gameplay experience (e.g. FW, hauling, spai, ratting).
---
Honestly, this game isn't that bad when it comes to encouraging whales to spend money.
---
i, for one, appreciate cynochanges (◕‿◕✿)
---
Cynos should spawn a fleet of drifters and triglavians. The number would depend on what is on grid at the time you light the cyno. The 2 NPC fleets would try to murder everything on grid and each other in a few minutes. The servers would melt in minutes during a big tidi battle.
---
we know, and people who care already made their characters
---
They do not. If you are aware they are easy to deal with assuming you are not flying paper.

Lazy meme, should go on the meme page.

The red points are not their target, those are bulletpoints they stand for.
---
Yes it does but it’s not a net increase in money.
---
If you were going to be subbed for x months they were going to gain those dollars anyway. 
---
You just have to spend y months doing something you didn’t expect/want to.
---
It’s not an increase in income for ccp is my point

I definitely agree with you about bombers being a problem. I just got picked off by a Loki yesterday. As a noob I'm not quite sure what all of our options are, but surely there is a way to counter bomber fleets?
---
I used to be able to fly multiple mwd battleships and double bubble sabres. 
---
There were changes and now I can't. 
---
I'm not hugely on one side or the other in this, but I figured I should point out there's very old precedent for changing what can be fit where.
---
nice

Seems like Provi activity did drop off a cliff far more so than other dense regions. April MER has provi at 435B mined and 781B bounties. I would think when the July one releases it will be considerably lower. They are in the category that ate the most shit from Blackout, dense enough to attract hunters, more subcaps that can't be saved if tackled, and not enough caps to out-escalate hunters.
---
&gt; I'm just expressing my opinion in a perfectly respectful way  
---
&gt; I'm saying it is stupid  
---
&gt; ...you have a pile of dogshit on top of your head

Perhaps you can see here how you may be misunderstood, especially after you began with a condescending generalization worded in 100% matching form with a very popular meme.

And also wormholers cannoy close wh to farm because wh will autonatically open K162 when it is spawned

I'm assuming it's to fight bots or fakers in high sec. Which I'll admit I afk with orcas just so easy to land on a roid put out miners then watch Netflix or hulu.

The fact that I have a account for eve only shows that I don't actually waste my life on reddit bro. Seriously, you need to use that small thing inside your head called the brain. But trying to make yourself believe that you are not actually a salty boi who is sad about the game is actually makes me so much happy. I could do all these things but then I wouldn't be able to collect salts from the likes of you, who takes things so seriously that can't even comprehend the trolling coming his way. Seriously, I can't take enough of these salt. NEVER.STOP.BEING.YOU.

---
Multiple cyno recons.
---
Heavy buffer blops battleships.
---
Cyno beacons
---
Not much will change. Cap battles will still happen. Roamers will still get blobbed in various regions etc. 
---
Main Difference will be a lot of dead recons on zkill from people moving their capitals around. Low sec campers will have nice expensive free kills racking up
---
More people will leave the game etc. Basically nothing is different at the end of the day except cynos are expensive.
---
Oh, I'm sorry. Guess Tishu was marxist, revolutionary, anti-capitalist, trump-hating, pro-lgbt and black lives activists.
---
I think you'd have more success equating the sub to Hotpockets with this group, but your analysis is otherwise spot on.
---
The focus should have been for you to salvage behind someone already in a carrier and you focus your time on  subcaps and T2 subs and you finding out what it is you want to do in Eve. Null isn't ideal for a newbro still figuring out the game.
---
this week i would like to say that even though none of the "chaos era" changes benefit me personally, i am glad to see that devs are trying out new things. i certainly hope they will be brave enough to accept the truth in case some of the changes do not work out!
---
have a great weekend people (✿◠‿◠)

Unless you’re mining with a Venture, you should be able to warp away ezpz.
---
I'm oddly aroused by your crime.
---
Shiny, cap.
---
Doubt. English is not even my native language and I find it dumb easy. French on the other hand ...
---
Might have a slight reduction on bounces since caps might not jump the entire fleet to one cyno.
---
"Used alt" On first reading I thought it meant that the person's mom was a cyno alt getting sold because she can't fly recon.
---
You will need isk for injectors.
---
Source of the problem was with introduction of rorqs, that became too damn easy. Still feel gotta nerf the multiboxing aspect of a rorq.

---
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of the word salt. Lying and shifting goalposts isn't "trolling" or "generating salt". It's called being disingenuous and having a low IQ. Try harder.
---
Trolls elicit an emotional response, you're just embarrassing yourself. Once more: simply calling someone salty doesn't make it true. I feel like I'll need to teach you to be a better troll. 
---
Tell you what, look through some of my posts on the boxing sub, I troll GGG/Pacquiao fans pretty often. There you'll get an idea how it's done. Class is in session, and you're a D- grade student.

Mining in hisec is a simple and reliable isk faucet Regardless of speed, it is free money.  The more dangerous null becomes, the more people will try to AFK mine in hisec.  And just because it isn't making you filthy rich doesnt mean it isn't making anyone filthy rich.   20 orcas safely chugging around the clock in hisec will mine far more isk than a rorq in null mining whenever its umbrella is online.
---
Rats ganking belts is a logical response to the absurd increase in 'safe' mining following the blackout.

---
Does the relative squishiness of recons compared to lighting a backup/support cyno on a carrier or titan change the dynamic of the fight? Would you have ships dedicated to killing cynos or would recons light cynos off grid and move people in, making bubbles more important?
---
Casually jumps Titan
---
I think texans are the only americans to admit they dont speak english. And i appreciate that
---
You are wrong it's not an isk faucet at all other than the minuscule amount of isk from NPC bounties.
---
Minerals do not inject isk into the game.
---
Currently, it is often enough to send a few fax to repair the target and maybe some supers to scare them off. If they can no longer kill anything, they will move on. If you want to kill them, you have to send a proper subcap fleet. Small stuff that can tackle and kill them. This takes time to organize, of course.      
---
Bombers scale very well. With a high enough number of pilots, they will still kill their target and maybe kill even a few other guys that came to save him. Then they extract with minimal losses. They are easily replaced and stealthy.
---
This post is a jocular arrow directed at Mittens' face.
---
Compare the mineral volume in highsec regions to any occupied 0.0 region in the MER. Highsec doesn't get anyway close to the amount of minerals mined in 0.0. 
---
Even if all highsec mining stopped today it won't have a significant impact on mineral value.
---
It's more unless your in a time crunch or going for max efficiency orca mining isnt much worse then hulk mining but with less risk. Not a full test but me boosting in and orca while.mining and 2 salts in hulks filled the orca in about 54 mins. Orca mining on it's own with miner2s takes about 3 and a half hours. Hulks are better right? Not my much as I can also sit the 2 alts in orcas and have 3 orcas mining taking barely longer to fill then 3 loads with the hulks would take. Which you can do next to afk with the orcas the hulks require way more attention for rats or gankers. Plus a boosted hull can only hold 2 cycles before it needs dumped to the orcas fleet hanger. For me that's about 70ish second per cycle so again way more attention needed. The orca and rorqs problems are about the same on their own the mine way to good making it silly to use hulks or coves when you can just put your alts into orcas or rorqs anyways. I dont think they should be nerfed if anything the barges need buffers to make them preferable to extra orcas or rorqs.
---
**Citation &amp; break down:**
---
&gt; *I get that your individual friends matter to you. But you don't know how many players are coming back, how many began to log in to kill stuff etc. You don't know the relative value of a null PvE player who PLEXes his accounts to a PvP player who purchases that PLEX for $. You'll have to trust CCP on this one; that if their profitability is really damaged, they'd reverse it. It might even be the case that they are prepared to take a short term hit, to bring long term organic sustainability between alternative playstyles.* 
---
This paragraph is littered with vocabulary that is obviously pulled straight from some sort of short-term goal or agenda outline / summary CCP shared.
---
&gt;*"But you don't know how many players are coming back"*
---
Implication that we, the players, don't know but he, CSM member, does.
---
&gt;*"how many began to log in to kill stuff etc."*
---
I guaran-fucking-tee you this is the same turd CCP throws at PA. This is a direct reference to the latest patch stuff where you get skill points for logging in and killing ships - of course people are going to do that. I also guaran-fucking-tee you they don't specify what it is exactly being killed b/c the real statistics are all just NPCs.
---
&gt;*"You don't know the relative value of a null PvE player who PLEXes his accounts to a PvP player who purchases that PLEX for $"*
---
This is Olmeca's only words in this paragraph.
---
&gt;*"profitability, prepared to take a short term hit, organic sustainability"*
---
These phrases are straight out of the text book on "How To Bullshit A Quarterly Forecast &amp; Status Summary". No one says that shit unless they are scripting a business call or giving an earnings report. It sounds like CCP regurgitated the same buzzwords from a PA conference call to the CSM.
---
yob tvoyu mat
---
Still can scan cosmics and ships and everything else
---
You are correct, I used the wrong terminology.  But my point stands-- it is still free money.  It isn't a direct-to-wallet payout but it still directly affects the economy as a whole.
---
Oh wow 1m SP, yay I can train one skill from 4 to 5 if I am lucky.
---
The only issue is that they cant Tell how much the other changes affected the game since it All came to quick
---
The fact that everyone uses the same "salty" meme just shows you inbreds are all fucking each other in some r/eve brigading circle jerk somewhere.
---
&gt;*"hunting reserves are fine"*
---
Like fuck they are dude - I love when shitters like you come post on here to claim something that is easily dismissed by the reality of the situation in EVE right now and shows that the people supporting these changes have absolutely no fucking idea what they are talking about.
---
Free speech is not free to insult people.
---
Free speech is free to express your taste, or lack of, as long as it does not aim at agressing people.
---
For example you can say that you love sexual intercourse, does not mean that you can say "fuck you".
---
This isn't how wormholes work as far as anyone knows. The spawn rate seems to be completely independent of clear frequency.
---
Welcome to eve! Remember if you are farming relic sites you can always just start from a highsec wormhole. The only lowsec systems that will regularly be camped are ones that connect to highsec and are close to trade hubs. You'll be fine once you can warp cloaked though. (Careful PH dudes are seriously  good at decloaking haha)
---
P.S. TBF I have played since 2009 on and off.. the only time I have ever needed to do spreadsheets online was a year ago when I started building T2. I don't know where this spreadsheets online thing comes from because you really don't need it that much.
---
Thanks. This!   
---
I constantly knock heads with a few of my fellow pilots when they're on the back of people for not having cyno alts, eyes alts, cloaky alts, dictor alts, capital alts, bridge alts ... etc. Accounts cost money (To those that have rl time commitments and can't plex our accounts 24/7) and there should never be a real-world monetary limit on being a good pilot, *sure it would help in some cases.* But you always have to have the backbone to oppose certain things you disagree with.   
---
It's a game! play it the way you have fun, avoid areas of the sandbox you find, not fun!
---
I think cost is part of it, but not the whole picture.  Making the module more expensive sort of works if cost is our only concern, but we'd have to chew through what's on the market now and what's in storage.  Maybe CCP looked at those numbers and thought the changes would take too long to play out.
---
I think they're also trying to force people to be smarter with how they light cynos by limiting how "hard" a cyno beacon can be.  You could make the module more expensive, have heavy fitting requirements, and introduce harsh fitting penalties to accomplish all these things.  Maybe they just weren't creative enough for that or they wanted training cyno alts to take longer/be more expensive by forcing higher skill requirements for some reason.

---
I like the large alliances that conquer territory.
---
Bought one for my bustard and that baby is beautiful!
---
Right so how does any null corp get seeded then? Large or small it takes a JF to get things in and out safely.
---
The MER by mining volume seems to contradict that highsec has a significant impact on mineral value. The vast majority of ore is mined in 0.0 and even if you eliminate highsec mining entirely it won't have a significant impact on mineral value.
---
it s not meant to
---
If it was my fleet I would have cyno buffer widow(s) that would jump to a covert cyno then 3 dedicated minnows to stagger reps on it while the rest of the fleet comes in.
---
I haven't come up with a better idea so far. My widow fit reaches 600k ehp with links and initial overheat bulbs expensive ( thanks srp) 
---
Sadly the recons would become the expendable cyno unless the subs could stay near it to keep it repped for the duration of its cyno
---
I don't enjoy large scale battles so I don't have any plan for those. 
---
For blobbing onto roamers/wormholers the recons seemed to work great last two nights. They are harder to kill than I imagined once reps are on it.
---
For mining ops, the cloaked widow looks to be the best solution with shield reppers on the rorqs in place of the cyno.
---
&gt;  but most languages have more rules (which means more exceptions) than English
---
ó as idéia, rules give a baseline for exceptions not to happen in the first place. They're not always sucessful but if anything more rules allow for less exceptions in the end, given the same subject matter. English has a lot of exceptions, that doesn't necessarily make it harder to learn because its (normally) easy to correct the misuse of those exceptions by context, but they're there nonetheless
---
"Uhh yeah jiggle peaking while bunnyhopping is definetly causing velocity to turn down 4 watt in the settings since your xhair is related to the smoke on catwalk."
---
I like this meme very much.
---
Things will continue almost as normal for Capital pilots. Capital pilots will move their Cyno alts into Recon alts and have them cloaked around their ship whilst ratting/mining. When engaged they'll decloak, light the cyno, get help and probably get SRP'd for the Recon. However, I doubt sub-cap pilots will do this, so no more capitals jumping to save them. This is a good thing. It will also create a lot more work for the attacker to escalate, trying to get the Recon in the right places etc.
---
"Ich scheiße auf den Käsekuchen." I shit on the cheesecake. Why did you remember that exactly?
---
Was there, done that, - before it became cool for the kids!
---
Poor WoW-classic-reddit, tons and tons of salt is coming your way!
---
It's starting to sound like that's the point.
---
On one hand, complaints of stagnation and nothing happening.
---
On the other, it's too safe, too many people live there and are doing things.
---
Even as an omega I actually prefer to not use a cloak when exploring in a wormhole. It almost feels like cheating.
---
except the reward was too high for the risk. it's being brought into balance.
---
The weak will got there(wow classic) the other will adept and have fun.
---
&gt; Meaning an alt who is in omega status 
---
You left off a bit of the important context, don't you think?
---
That has always been Hilmar's answer for everything to be honest.
---
That's why it never stopped quite at exactly 25%, only near there. It was the first bleed through that would trigger reinforcement.
---
Remove subcaps
---
More power to those that want to play it. It will be a nice time waster for some. I'm curious how many people will start and stop once they see how slow everything was "back then".
---
Adept or dye!
---
and indeed Bombers will nuke everything!
---
They aren't balancing anything though.
---
Dont forget how Eve was dying in 2005, 2004, or 2003
---
Oh god, imagine believing the CSM can actually do something useful.
---
But we're not in conflict. That's the problem. On fact, this whole chaos bs is pushing null empires towards blueing up. Why would we shoot each other when CCP is making it that much harder to deploy offensively, meanwhile we're having to guard the Homeland.
---
The area of NID-8RQ will probably become a lot more popular for mining and ratting as people will hopefully begin grouping better for protection. NID is a good choke point and is farther into Delve.
---
I dig it
---
EVE Gate re opens
---
Exactly what I am saying. It's the massive cap brawls that get publicity
---
THE STARS MOVE
---
Enshrining Power blocks? In the slightest. Coaltions are a big thing, but the aim seems to be to supress capital projection. Which in a big case, is a good thing and a bad thing.  
---
Does this hurt smaller corps/alliances, yes. But at the same time, to claim it doesn't hurt powerblocks is an understatement. Being in one of those powerblocks, most of the time, Cap fights are lit from a ship in fleet or an alt in a cyno ceptor anyways. Rarely ever from a combat recon.  
---
And yes, you can exclaim they will be added to the "SRP Scheme" But if it's a doctrine ship, it's a doctrine ship. SRP accounts for it regardless.   
---
Also to say is will hurt 75% of eve... I feel 75% of eve are the power blocks. Have you seen the sov map recently or kept up on blue standings?  
---
But one of the things I can say that this does hurt is indeed carrier/super ratters. But what it REALLY effects are JF services. Deep null players importing Moon Goo to make T2 ships, new alliances taking new space trying to seed their markets, 9 mids to high sec this means 9 toons that can fly a combat recon and cyno + the risk of losing it every time you light. OOOOF. This is the big issue.
---
The cyno changes are interesting, but I don't have a ton to say about it, we will see how they shake out. Appreciate the kind words, hopefully this video helps some people who want to get in space and shoot stuff.
---
Lowsec Gate to Stain
---
Maybe this is in conjunction with some other changes they're planning to make that we haven't seen yet. I am sure ccp would rather have twice the player base than twice the alts.
---
Effort was put into. Many people don't want to put  the effort into and rather just have ccp nerf someone else's gameplay.
---
The biggest changes re:capfights are going to be roaming gangs that don't kill rorqs are basically guaranteed a recon kill now, and ratting supers are going to eat shit to bombers instead of lighting cynos and getting saved by fax.
---
I think one of the next big changes will be to upwell structures and timers. Not sure how but I'm thinking that is coming.
---
I had a panic attack one morning because I was dreaming that my citadel was being blown up in J-Space. I had the citadel for a week when this happened. EVE is stressful on your brain.
---
Or the Night Elf walk of shame to be able to play with all there friends in SW.
---
ah thx for clearing that up, but maybe do both in futur?
---
Has the best laws in the world
---
Dead end systems are the choice for many people, but bombers can still sneak in through a wormhole, dreads can still jump in via cyno. We'll figure it out.
---
Isn't it that they're region based? Meaning the more krabbing in a wormhole region the more will respawn?
---
Like inactive holes will have a fuck ton of everything.
---
I am excited for the upcoming changes. Good post.
---
bless you!

there's already an api that exposes all his raw data for free :P

People were buying up Recon ships from the Blackout change. Curses completely sold out in Jita a month ago. Take off the tinfoil, it's killing what few brain cells you have left.

I hope after this war those guys end up somewhere that keeps giving us gudfites. Small gang with the nerds in SLVP is a riot.
---
Adapt or die pussy.
---
The new meta is to get together a group of 20 people to do all the mundane busy work we used to do alone. Because CCP apparently wasn't happy with the distribution of the mind-numbing logistics of managing a nullsec group, and have decided everybody needs to be a part of it.

How often does it happen though? Is it better to just eat the loss of a random attack?
---
I mean he's right.
---
It's not a grey area in the slightest.
---
You can't lockdown functionality and then charge to access it. If anything in a rather stupid way (something you're likely familiar with) removing ad's is paying to remove functionality.
---
:thinking:
---
I dont think the skill point loss is whats stopping people from using them in more situations. Most T3Cs arent even good anymore.
---
Not even remotely true. English is in fact one of the most consistent and easy ones to learn. Most nordic languages and stuff like Chinese is a lot worse to learn. Honestly German time prepositions are waaaaaaay harder to get used to than any part of English. A good bunch of people in this sub speaks 2 or more languages, its funny how everyone is speaking the "hardest" one then.
---

---
Gentlemen, you can’t shitpost in here! This is the war room!
---
Rain delay right now. Neither Aussies nor Poms commonly use the phrase 'pie hole'. I would accept 'dick holster'.
---
Triglavian Kung fu space pandas! Genius! How can I buy a lifetime sub to eve! I’ll never leave!
---
That would be less useful to bots than local though still somewhat useful. Personally I like the feeling that there are people but that you can't be sure so blackout as current suits me fine
---
A reason to fight each other. The problem that Eve has currently is that most players in null sec reside under one of the big umbrellas (4 I think). There's no more reason to go to war. Everyone just wants to sit around a mine or rat all day.
---
The reason everyone wants to rat and mine all day is because there is a big push in null mega blocks to get as many supers and titans as you can. It's a cold war that occasionally has some fights. For every one Titan that dies, another 10 are built at the very least. This push to have the biggest ships in your hangars is what leads everyone to krabbing. 
---
The biggest ships in the hangar is also the best for home defense and the reason why there is a big push for the . There is no reason to use sub caps to defend your space anymore. It's about who can bring the most big ships. To have the most big ships you need the industrialist to build them and the ratters to buy them. To protect these people you use your ever growing umbrella to defend them.  
---
The next chaos era change should give people a reason to fight and not just get the biggest ships anymore. There's a lot of mechanics wrapped up in this vicious cycle that could potentially be changed. 
---
The worst change would be the one that directly affects the miners and industrialist. The best change would be one that gives people a reason to not use supers and titans all the time for everything you can think of. If there is less reasons to use the biggest ships, there will be more people in smaller ships. 
---
Some potential changes. 
---
1) remove the Boson doomsday. The ability for a Titan to track and kill an entire fleet instantly was overpowered and the reason certain mechanics were changed quite a few years ago. The reasoning behind them undoing this is beyond me. 
---
2) change long range fighters to have worse tracking than heavy bombers. Still keep the long range aspect, just don't let them track anything smaller than a citadel.  This also keeps in line with normal subcap weapons. Long range is worse tracking and short range is better tracking. 
---
3) not a chaos era change, but buff battleship lock speeds. There's no reason a non NSA carrier should lock faster than a dominix. 
---
4) remove haw weapons. They have no place and could easily be replaced by Marauder's. Simultaneously buff Marauder tracking and damage while in bastion (mini siege) 
---
5) remove the auto aggro from drones. Make them be assisted for auto aggro or the user has to engage them every time. More of a balance pass really. 
---
6) change the anomaly spawn system to work like wormholes. Once you run a sig, it despawns but appears somewhere else in the constellation. You can continuously farm, sure, but make the system change. This will encourage non super ratting as it takes forever to warp a super around. Either that or they will have to jump around continuously. This mixed with the tracking debuff on heavy fighters should kill super ratting. 
---
7) remove the panic button on rorqs or reduce it to 3 minutes at Max skill. This will mean that either they have no safety button or they have to be at least 40% through their cycle to come out and immediately have a fax rep them. The panic button is pretty much an I win button, even with the cyno change. People have pointed out that with a well established bloc, moving recons will be no problem. 
---
8) cloakies use fuel. Once the fuel runs out, you decloak. This prevents bombers from cloaky camping, you would still have to worry about cloaky haulers like the visitor who can fit  a whole lotta fuel.
---
Yeah this is a game. Not an occupation. Supposed to be fun
---
Yeah gotta be on the list
---
It’s not that important anyway. When I started exploration, I used to be really paranoid about not losing my way out. Now, I just keep going until I find a new hisec exit. Looking up static connections is really helpful in that regard.
---
What I try to do is be real careful of where I step into: once I get into a new wormhole, I use the 2min cloak to check zkillboard for recent activity (mainly if someone lives in that wh), see what static wh’s that system has, check dscan for anything sketchy, mark my exit, etc. A system that has consistent kills by a single player or corp over several days is a big no-no.
---
It's difficult to follow the logic patters of your common pvp npc player, but I imagine they will go after asset safety next. 
---
All the while complaining privately about how finding content is harder and becoming more so.
---
I agree with the above except for Nestor.
---
When Titans were introduced they were made "prohibitively expensive", and CCP estimated that there would only be "a handful" at any given time. Therefore, the amount of firepower they brought to bear in an engagement was not considered an issue.
---
How many monitors what resolutions
---
Just because you are mad about a change dont short change it. Alot changes friend. My biggest change i can say off the top of my head(not even playing atm).
---
- Ratters/Rorquals  now need a cyno alt with them if they want to brainlessly afk rat/mine and call for carrier help. 
---
This change with the recent blackout is wonderful really, im loving the blue doughnut tears. Always have, always will. This might actually bring me back for a bit.
---
Last weekend's dog sitting was a blast!

This weekend is a bit more low key. Just dinner at a friend of a friends. I won't really know anyone though...

Still, big gym session tonight. I want to spend a chunk of time on my bottom half game.
---
I like this comment because it does show that the recon is tanky enough to still do its job, but if that roaming gang turned into a serious bait fleet, your recon is fuckin dead and there are caps on grid to melt.

---
Exploration is very lucrative especially in nullsec for like 10m investment for a t1 or about 40-50m for a t2 cov ops
---
I disagree. Sources of isk in the game are not zero-sum - ie. if I added 100 bots to the game, I have effectively added 100 bots worth of resources to the game (roid belts are not 100% saturated in any way - bots are equivalent to converting these unused belts/npcs into isk). More isk in the system = more inflation.
---
You can look at specific assets in the game, like ships, costing less ISK, but this is only due to much of the bot activity in the game flooding it with resources to build those ships, and would point to a large majority of bot behavior being majority-driven by mining.
---
If you look at assets that can only be attained via *human* time or skill, or that are at 100% saturation (resources that are driven by null-sec ownership? not really sure), you will see dramatic inflation across the board. One of the easiest ways to see this is Plex, which directly ties to USD, which is generally tied to human effort and skill much better than ISK.
---
https://eve-marketdata.com/price_check.php?type_id=44992&amp;region_id=&amp;solarsystem_id=&amp;type=history
---
You will see that even though demand for plex has dropped by almost half, the price in isk has continued to inflate. If deflation was actually happening, the price of Plex would also need to dramatically drop.

Sentry mjd snipers domis with wardens and passive targeters cloaked 120k off your rorq. Can annihilate recons and bombers with very little investment.

No Recon = No Cyno
---
I always wondered why the reinforce threshold was at 25% shield. That seemed to random.     
---
By the time i started to get a grasp on game mechanics, i was already so used to the 25%, i never questioned it again.       
---
Thanks fam.
---
Nice one lol, love it
---
Not sure to be honest, I don't go into HS, that place is fucking scary.
---
I love the changes. I just bought 3 titans as half price because CCP is doing this all wrong.
---
THIS IS LIFE OR DEATH GODAMMIT! THIS SHIT MATTERS
---
I knew already about shield bleed, when i got introduced to POS bashing, but i never connected the dots. Thanks.
---
That’s a beaut.
---
NCPL TEST and Goons I should have said
---
Excellent edit mate!
---
&gt;You just have to spend y months doing something you didn’t expect/want to

Which isn't free. That extra time still costs money.
---
I thought they didn't teach evolution in Texas.
---
This. C4+ Data and Relic sites are all sleeper sites (except really rare exceptions) which spawn sleeper npc that can one shot most frigates.
---
C1-3 can have sleeper sites as well, but also can have pirate data and relic sites, which have no npc whatsoever. If you see a pirate faction name in the site, it’s safe. If it’s Unsecured or Forgotten (and Abandoned? Don’t remember), it’s a sleeper site, so stay away.
---
Sounds fun. Do you have a link?
---
Already played it, even if I could bring myself to give it another go it'll just be too easy for anything to hold my attention for long.
---
I just started a few days ago and had just a few minutes to do 4 agent missions. I hope i get as captivated as you. i am scared of the game tho. It seems to be a lot to learn and the progress will very slow.
---
because the game as it is played, pvp or industry etc.
---
its all reading range, velocity, angular's damage outputs, min maxing, efficiently hauling, building, researching, its the actual game that is 'online spreadsheets' not because you use spreadsheets with eve, although mostly everyone exists in eve beneath a man somewhere working on spreadsheets
---
I think its ment to be more risk they being able to send a effectively worthless ship to cyno. Ie is it going to be worth it to use a recon to light on a solo cruiser or bs when said ship may have a good chance of killing you as well before they die.
---
Aggression timers on wormholes would be funny.
---
That is fucking brilliant!
---
When you use bad grammar and spelling, it pretty much makes the insult useless. Getting called stupid by someone who can't tell the difference between you're and your isn't gonna hurt as much as someone with intelligence saying it.
---
Trust in Rise!!
---
This is a benefit to CCP’s bottom line. Plain and simple, pull your credit card out to move your caps, recons are expensive!
---
Bs can light them as well if I read that right cant they?
---
I don't get it.
---
It's not like they can't tie their shoes or have some sort of mental disability. They just don't speak a certain language out hundreds of existing languages.
---
It does it's job just fine. And the best part is I did this right on a wormhole the other day, what a rush not knowing if there was an ikitsura fleet coming on the other side. Nothing eventually materialized but it sure was fun either way.
---
Pinged discord and guys were logging in for a fight, burning to my system, supers at the ready. Just gotta make the best of it.
---
I don't really bother that much with eve pve, I like incursions and wormhole fuckery but the rest is kinda boring and the "events" have been pretty shit, so the changes don't really affect me. I've made enough isk to do what I like to do which is fuck about in sub-cap fleets.
---
light cyno with blops at 100km off with his wing of support (3dudes alts 5 alts in total).
---
all align to blob, 1st jump dessie spool, 2nd dessie spool, as 1st dessie MJD goes off Blops light cyno, 3rd dessie spool, 2nd dessie jump goes off, the the 3rd.
---
you now have a cyno beacon at 0 on the enemy, and the hull providing the cyno is 200km away from the bubble caps. further if you really wanted. 
---
Quetion, what happens if i light a cyno and jump my hull off grid.
---
My point is that the account would get subbed anyway. 
---
Never mind what it does to YOU.
---
Ccp gains no more money than it would have ANYWAY 
---
Because the account would have been subbed ANYWAY 
---
I run 6 account by credit card
---
I must train covert cyno on 6 different Alts 
---
My account count will not change nor will my subs ccp neither gains or loses dollars
---
confirming it is to kill bots, and is working
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78448758/
---
Blops will. They are not worth it as 1b+ losses, unless you have spare widows sitting around, which are basically useless ships.
---
Yeah, the game really does not look any deader than ever.
---
Terrible idea. Come back to crafting a combat rorqual doctrine
---
[The man, the myth, the wise: CCP Rise!](https://imgur.com/SyK80ME)
---
It will end when CCP starts shedding subs, which I am sure has already started. I expect CCP thinks the trend will plateau and people will come back; however, my personal feeling is that at some point over the next 6 months they will realize that the trend is not self correcting and enter panic mode. At that point, I expect a significant rollback of 'chaos' era changes.
---
And give Activision-Blizzard money a single penny ever again? I'll pass thanks.
---
&gt; Climbing up the ladder slowly from subcap merc mining to rorqual, logi subcap to fax, and subcap dps to dread.
---
May I ask how long you've been playing?  A new player really shouldn't have access to all 3 and feel like they know what they're doing and that they're safe to be doing it.
---
If you injected your way towards all of that I can understand why you're feeling dejected.  You're part of the population being targeted by CCP, but don't have the experience or SP to have a fall-back like the Vets.  Which sucks.  But honestly, it's healthier for the game long-term.  Probably.  Or it means null-sec is a wasteland and the Vets who remain have all retreated to WH-space, which can be quite hostile to newbies.  
---
Who knows!
---
I know salty is overused but you appear to be geniunely salty all the time.    
---
You want proof? Highest kill july for 0.0 in years. Further proof? Jumping acitivity, roaming gangs everywhere.    More? Pcu didnt plummet it actually took a rise in july compared to june.    
---
More? Botting activity got DESTROYED with regions like branch and drones being empty right now.   
---
Stfu bbtb honestly all you do is propaganda for major blocs, if i ask you 10 questions for eve mechanics you wont be able to answer 1. Now go stroke some higher up goon dick and discuss how eve is gonna die and ccp is smoking pot from the sewers.
---
You consider someone that speaks at least the basics of a second language less intelligent than someone that only speaks english, that is one of the most simple languages on the planet? Are you really that much of a douchebag?

2 Questions:
---
\- Can one cloak in time to prevent being tackled at a gate?  
---
\- Can a Capital Ship category Freighter enter high-sec?
---
 When a player quits EVE and goes to WoW, the average IQ in both games increases.
---
Why do you think this will hurt the blue donut instead of making it... bigger? bluer? whatever due to what you just said as the need to have more friends? People are either going to have to group together more for common defense or the solo miners/ratters will leave for safer pastures.
---
Why would larger groups break up over this instead of combine forces?
---
A "counter" must actually counter. The cyno must have a longer delay than the inhib. What is the point of using an inhib when the cancer has already arrived?
---
Enter the Dutch.
---
Yes you can cloak before being targeted, however if you do not have a covops cloak it is possible someone can decloak you
---
And yes freighters can go into highsec
---
If ratting in a super is so dangerous, wouldn't people eventually stop doing that?
---
Fantastic movie, if anyone hasn’t seen it
---
If you can't warp, you can not jump.
---
That's peachy. All he's saying is, that you would have paid the same without changes as long as you need the account for cynos.     
---
That you now need the SP instead of selling them means you buy less extractors.      
---
If you look that simple minded at things you could argue CCP was making less money.
---
Probably going to be more like everyone keeps cyno recons in ship maint Bay for ghost riding
---
reduced tank on supers rorquals
---
reducued income
---
more spread out resources or more concentrated ones?
---
 or all the above?  :D

---
one would think
---
Don't Trigs only show up in invasion systems? In other words, why not just move a couple of systems over to somewhere safe?
---
Or am I missing something here?
---
Erm, what fleets are you in that save recons for last?
---
They’re not tho
---
it wasn't a very good cheesecake, i'd assume
---
Except when you're fielding 100b+ that cyno is nbd and will catch reps
---
Not trolling, but are you required to fly a capital alone?  There’s other ships in EVE.
---
If you can squeeze it into a Novice plex it will do great. On a more serious note, these are frigate fits, for use in lowsec PVP (In Novice Plex)
---
Assuming someone is American pretty much makes you as ignorant as me buddy.
---
I don't think a ship can be mjd'd while lighting a cyno
---
Like most of Stanley Kubricks films. He also made [Full Metal Chessur](https://i.imgur.com/DpxHLro.gifv) Jacket.
---
Right? "I've been playing for 1 year and I skilled into carriers and rorquals and titans and now that's useless because of CCP reeeeeeeee"
---
You can't reasonably (or maybe even unreasonably) mjd any ship off grid.
---
he wants to feel dangerous and important by saying there are tears
---
spearfishing the cyno onto the grid though! :D multiple ecm bursts working with
---
But you wouldn't, they are alts. They are likely spare character slots that aren't training.
---
They are nice to look at.
---
100% agreed. That's exactly what im saying to myself. I fucking hate to farm and i want all my game time to be enjoyable. So at the end of the week, i spend 20 buck IRL because my job is well enough paid to be enjoy my lifestyle and buy ships with it. 20$ IRL would take me a fkin whole week to farm in exploration. No time to waste, there is stuff to pew ! :)
---
im not 100% tbh, but i thought if a ship lights on a station for instance, you can MJd it away unless it is scrammed
---
You stole this burn from someone on here yesterday
---
I think I may be the one to answer this, I have played wow, everquest, guild wars, swtor online, list goes on man.
---
The only thing that even comes close to eve online is everquest zek.
---
This game will suck out your life man, run away unless
---
you like brutal.
---
We do null hunts all the time now! I just wanted permanent blackout ;)
---
Try fitting a blops to break 250k ehp.
---
They will get alphaed hilariously
---
Also can drag bubble recons into a cyno inhib that should be on top of the rorq... it’s gonna be very very difficult to get reinforcements now cus the recon will have to cyno sometime in that minute before the jammer goes online, which does not give groups time to prepare
---
So you drive minmatar, then.
---
I'm pretty sure we agree with the underlying issues.  I'm not arguing that bots aren't the issue.  And i agree completely with the statement "You can look at specific assets in the game, like ships, costing less ISK, but this is only due to much of the bot activity in the game flooding it with resources to build those ships, and would point to a large majority of bot behavior being majority-driven by mining."
---
I'm just saying that that actually shows deflation, not inflation.  
---
However, this is probably just a disagreement on how we are measuring inflation.  I'm using the CPI as determined by CCP.  you are using Plex.  both are valid measurements, but i believe the CPI is more aligned with what you would consider inflation in the real world as CPI is generally what is used when calculating real world inflation.
---
also i'm not sure what you are putting in the bucket of "assets that can only be attained with human time/skill input"?
---
Simple. I see lasker video I watch and upvote
---
Correct. This is why I canceled 3 of my 4 accounts. I refuse to give CCP *even more money* to retrain all of my cyno alts into recons. Instead, my capitals will stay docked until needed by the alliance (including dropping on your bomber gangs, which will still happen), and providing you zero new content--which is real easy for me since I make a 'living' trading. 
---
Additionally, Mr. Wormholer, I cannot help but wonder how much salt would pour from you if CCP announced people could now cyno into w-space. I bet it would be 3x as bad as what you are seeing from null sec capital pilots at the moment.
---
you can not boosh a cyno ship, you can not jump when having a cyno open
---
We need more newbros like you. Spot on homie

Usually only ignorant people from the USA (which of course doesn't mean all or the majority of them by any means) are so entitled about their language to reach the extreme levels of ignorance displayed by your previous comments; sorry if I made a wrong assumption, I need to remember that xenophobia and stupidity know no borders.

---
Whatcha talking about Willis.  People literally went to war this year. CCP took the decision away  from one side to continue it by introducing drifters. Some people enjoy ratting and Mining. I don't understand it but I ain't gonna hate on them for it. Tldr past the first paragraph.
---
Nope, you just have to have your own recon cloaked off of you at 100km to get the first group of people in to take inhib down. Then warp another recon to the super to light another cyno for faxes. Supers and titans are tanky enough to live through this timeframe
---
All you gotta do is try... and most of the ppl here have friends and can coordinate shit. Even the guys I was hunting last night finally worked some stuff out and fought back. It was rly cool. After they lost the second Dominix they started adapting and having a form of response fleet so they could keep ratting. It’s important to remember that when u don’t have huge numbers, that logi is a very important force multiplier
---
I don’t know if it depends on the type of rats. But you should be readdy to refit to tank subs, which gives you more time for help to come. All this also happens under an umbrella.
---
You are for thinking that someone with basic knowledge or learning english is by default less intelligent that a native speaker.

Oh, I almost forgot.  Eve jukebox returns, but it only plays Rick Astley.  It also is built into the agency, which now pops up randomly even when you are not logged in and closing it out increases the volume.

What you're feeling is the anxiety that comes from uncertainty. Traditionally, chaos hasn't been CCP's plan; it was a natural result of their failure to do any contingency planning. The only thing has changed now is that they're embracing their cluelessness and trying to make it look like a feature. 
---
I wish CCP would just come out and say, "We have no idea what effects these changes will have, but we going to try them out and see how they go. We are going to keep a close eye on them and tweak or reverse them if they don't go the way we hope." Normally, that would be a given; but they've made SO many bad changes and left them in place indefinitely that blindly trusting in their judgment has become a sucker bet; never mind how popular it is on reddit.
---
Super fights seem borderline impossible now. A blackops trying to get a cyno will be deleted by the hostile super cap instantly you hoping for a few seconds and then your fleet can't continue streaming in.
---
I understand there are more than what you get, but if you were at all concerned about over committing something you could chuck one dread and one carrier per 10 man gang and have a good fight. (Your two cap pilots might actually gain some solid pvp experience doing this too) If they’re threatening those then you could send reinforcements. It’d be far far simpler and less risk (dreadbombs) than committing 1:1 numbers with supers. This all illustrates how simple your “planning” and logistics must actually be with how much you ARE willing to regularly commit to very small T1 gangs. 
---
We have, in that 5% of the time circumstance left null satisfied. Usually we left via pod express, but we got a really solid fight regardless of being outnumbered 5:1. 
---
One situation we took on a bait Paladin next to a staging system. We had 7 pilots: 2 exequrors, Mega, ashimmu, stabber, Oracle, Atron.

We killed 4 bil in apocalypse now. Ships against a 40 man fleet. There were no caps involved. 
---
That fight remains in my memory today as having been one of the single most amazing fights I’ve ever been in.

In addition to defenseless rattlers solo roaming players will now get a crack at 300-500mil cyno ship. Content!
---
It was sarcasm.
---
Was it yesterday? Oops, I had intended to be more subtle. I had thought it was a few weeks ago.
---
Well, laws and opinions about that differ around the world tbh.
---
In Germany your rights end where ever you overstep those of others.
---
From what I gather in the US they take pride in being able to express whatever crosses their minds. The only restrictions being things like yelling "fire" in crowded places and direct calling for violence.
---
Is it amorale to call someone names for no reason? Imo it is, but good luck on the internet with that.
---
really? are you f serious?  
---
11th region alltime do you even f know what regions are above providence?

---
count how many null sec regions are in top10 and how many of them are above providence!  then say something about carebear region or similar shit about... providence is good statistic about stats of null sec...
---
I only mock others who speak shitty English when it's the only language they know.

The kind of mistakes that come from shitty English speakers who only speak one language are different from the kind made by those learning it as a second(or more) language.

Why a Widow over other BLOPS?
---
I fly many different ships on my main and I like to fly supers on my super alt. Apparently flying capitals is no longer desired in EVE, though.
---
I had this experience while dropping a command center. Untanked T1 Industrials have no chance, they simply wont enter warp fast enough

For reference, EVE launched May 6, 2003.

Love a dual rep incursus, also sometimes run a max spank incursus.  Triple tank Tristan is another good candidate.

[NJED is recruiting](https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/cbbvl1/new_jovian_exploration_department_is_recruiting/)
---
Correct, but the current system was a mistake when combined with massive supercap proliferation and the ability for supercaps to shit all over subs. The supercap problem is too far gone, so at this point they reintroduce scarcity to discourage megablobs of krabs.
---
Nobody was crying but don't misconstrue a minor oversight in to a lack of knowledge. Happens all the time to even the best writers. Someone caught it, brought it up, and I corrected it.
---
Say 30m EHP on a Hel with 2 mids used for non-tank. 500DPS*100 bombers is 50,000 DPS (on average, there will be people using arbalests, not using polarized, etc). That's still 600 seconds (10 minutes) to burn through 30m EHP, which should be plenty of time for reinforcement caps to arrive. A 45m EHP Wyvern has even more reaction time.
---
Carriers are completely boned.
---
Question: since the cyno changes represents a fundamental change to the core mechanics of ships I paid CCP at least two years of subscription fees to train into, can we also expect either a refunding of our capital ship related skill points, or cash refunds for the money invested in time to train said ships. Particularly for eve players who purchased game time associated with said ships while living in the European Union?
---
Discourage?
---
If you make resources scarce it stops players amassing the resources to contest them. So the only option is to further coalesce in to even bigger blobs.
---
Hopefully it means less of the damnable things.
---
if you have a super and dont have a alt in a cloaked recon then you deserve to loose this ship
---
Shields for *years*
---
indeed but those tasty carriers doing sanctums are an other thing all together...
---
You can gtfo a cyno ship, the cyno does not move even with the ship off grid.
---
Fucking hopefully.
---
Supers should never have been permitted into anomalies.
---
I mean, this *is* eve after all.
---
The funny part is that was a goon titan...  
---
But it was the judge, so that's ok
---
It's really too soon to tell the impact of Chaos changes.  
---
CCP says they have more activity.  Ok lets take them at their word regardless of the data showing fewer players logged in.  Both can be right if you assume a certain volume of the lost players are bots logged in for extended periods.  
---
Perhaps you can say the volume of people leaving is lower than the people returning.  How long will the returners stay.  Certainly you wouldn't expect 100% retention of players who left (at least) once before.  Certainly you also recognize that some of the people who haven't left are on a longer subscription or might be watching to see how this plays out over a few months before making a long term decision on their subscription.  
---
Because the changes are coming one right after another (and ignoring that there are log in/daily kill bonuses ongoing) without time to evaluate what changes are impacting activity &amp; retention, it's difficult to generate an analysis of what impact Chaos is having. Once the ground stops shifting and several months pass, will space be empty or full?  CCP clearly believed that the existing dynamic in null had potential to follow the same path of Serenity.  I'm not sure I agree, but they could be right.  They could also hasten the degeneration to Serenity's fate with these changes.  It's all too soon to tell.
---
would you send me your stuffs?
---
I don’t think that’s realistic, personally.  It’s not a resource problem, at least not rats and rocks, that is over.  It’s a human incentive problem.  The incentives today favor mega blob for safety, with very low penalty. That penalty needs to get ramped way up so there becomes meaningful trade off - if you want safety of umbrella you will earn lower reward.
---
Bro.  For those of you who don’t understand basic game mechanics.
---
For those like you who rush to post ego inflating posts insulting others then get all indignant “ItS a MiNoR OvErSiGhT”. same with everyone you are talking down to
---
Oh, yeah. If I want to move a capital I now have three options:
---
1. Gate (lol);
---
2. Risk a 300m+ ship (a lot more now that the speculators have bought up all the recon hulls) for *5 minutes* (sooo much better...);
---
3. Risk a 2b+ blops for 10 minutes;
---
Seems totally reasonable.
---
&gt;defenseless ratters
---
Show us on the doll where the retribution gang touched you.
---
I'm sad. I can't find the original scene
---
&gt; will catch reps
---
Muninn fleet says no.
---
Eve is a sandbox, except they keep buffing towards one direction. They got out played before and ccp didn't like it so we can't assume that they won't continue that trend.
---
next will be nerf citadel spam, index and service drop mechanics by entosis, removing blackout and set 1min delay to local.
---
I think the cyno changes are going to be much worse than the blackout in terms of removing content.
---
 Played almost entirely solo for 10 years now. Love it!
---
Going to highsec in those circumstances would avail me nothing. Karmafleet has made years of knowledge available and thus tought me things very well and is a great Corp.
---
When I say "accessable" I mean for folks like me who need special equipment to use a computer. That to say the issues I have are CCP making the game less accessable, where it was more so in the past. Again this is not a complaint, it is simply what it is. One might say it is the point of the changes. We will get through them even if I will not do what CCP wants and throw Plex at the problem.
---
I've been playing for just under a year total, and let me say, you never stop learning shit and it's what makes the game great. Eventually you do start to just "get" the fundamentals of the game. But there's always something new to try out, this game is amazing.
---
tl,dr hahahahahaha keep salt flowing you sad person who lives on the reddit :D
---
Tldr but it seems salty
---
Those wars never count for people. Goosn going north or test going east doesn't matter to them.
---
Lol, the patch notes are not confusing at all. I already theorycrafted my new ship to hunt afk VNIs that don't warp as soon as I pop up on local.

I don't have the rest of the data but I can look at eveoffline and see pcu is down compared to June so not sure how valid the rest is. Please source it.
---
any time anyone praises the mission system of this game, i just assume they must be half retarded and blind
---
Here it is with out of sync audio :/  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-KIAsuoMAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-KIAsuoMAQ)
---
HAW guns though.
---
Well that hyperbole but the bit of truth is there.
---
quite frankly I don't give a shit, I'm just pointing out the fact you are commenting and offering feedback on something you don't know anything about
---
Dude. Chill the fuck out.
---
It greatly increases the chances of ratters getting caught, and not being helped intime by their cap blanket? I thought it would be pretty straight forward. But since you are having issues ill outline it for ya.
---
 There is no local now, less intel for intel channels and less auto warning programs for afk miners. 
---
Not every ratting ship will have a cyno on it, and it now takes twice the toons to be as safe ratting as before. So either risk it or make less money then before.
---
These are both pretty big factors in why i say fuck the blue doughnut, and these changes help people poke at them and actually have fun.
---
And this is how we have an empty null sec because it's not worth living in.
---
Also punishing people for their efforts is fucking retarded.
---
I like when those things show up. They keep me engaged. Their salvage is valuable. Keep them coming.
---
Why are hunting reserves fine? Why are pve players obligated to be fodder for pvp players? If this was a sandbox people would do things to mitigate that risk but ccp keeps removing players ability to mitigate the risk.
---
probably around October this year or next, not sure when their sale contract with Pearl Abyss closes though
---
It has the most slots available for one type of tank, and it's completely useless for anything else 😂
---
Or its because a ton of people were complaining on the announcement. But ya know w/e ya say there internet boy.
---
Honestly I wish they also made it so you couldn't lite a cyno within  1000km of any structure.
---
Interestingly moving JF's through 0.0 with deep safes will be almost 100% safe.

Forgive me for not spending more time to proofread and edit my post for complete correctness the first time around. I'm so sorry it doesn't hold up to your editorial standards. Does this mean I don't get the job at Vogue? Even professional journalists get to print corrections.  
---
At this point you're just being a douchebag.
---
When the rage is real
---
&gt;ply moving with krabs as they follow the resources. And we will wind up taking even more space for our krabs to cycle throug
---
Not entirely true. Again, the umbrella moves with the krabs. We already do this for certain things (like popping moons). So we deplete Delve, it will take a month to 'respawn,' we (the krabs + umbrella) just move to the next region together. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Again, what you are asking for--weakening the projection of power--is a game that is fundamentally not eve at all. Its an arena PVP game. You cannot have it both ways... either EVE is a game with meaningful PVP, which to accomplish requires allowing players to build their own institutions and organizations for protection within a sandbox, a consequence of which is said institutions and organizations actually getting good at providing said protection; OR you have a game where player organizations have less impact, which necessitates confining PVP to set spaces (arenas), which hard cap the number of participants on both sides, which in turn necessitates people being able to opt out of pvp altogether.
---
Someone with intelligence would double check that their insult is correct. Maybe you shouldn't insult people at all, no mind insulting people in a language you don't grasp firmly? Expect people to rip the shit out of you for any reason if you're acting like a dickhead.
---
Adapt or die
---
Orcas can have 1mil overheated without trying hard.  They can also active tank for basically forever.  However, if you are potatoing fits like I've been seeing lately, it doesn't surprise me that stupid people are dying to stupid things.
---
you can also
---
- use wormholes
---
- use cyno beacons
---
- use asset safety
---
&gt;Why would larger groups break up over this instead of combine forces?
---
That's only your assumption; op never said that.
---
You're beyond help.
---
Go back to crying about being ganked in high sec. You somehow have managed to make yourself look more stupid with these posts than those ones. 
---
Stay mad xo
---
That’s the tricky part, yes. Risk-reward balance. If risk is too high, yes people will leave as a whole.  Right now, when blackout on, risk is way too high outside of an umbrella and maybe too high under an umbrella. So there will be some counterplay to blackout, like surveillance structures, but that still leaves imbalance toward mega blob. Resource depletion is about megablob disincentive.
---
ah so it is this year, wasnt sure if it was a 1 or 2 year deal.... but yea, im not sure how anyone can frame what is happening to eve right now in any other way.  it's almost like hilmar and his goons want everyone to forget they are leaving the payroll soon, very little mention at all who his successor will be ... seems like kind of a big deal
---
You give shit enough to come here and keep commenting lol. And now you are just assuming that i live in highsec to try to feel right about yourself. A nice double failure there. Only thing you are achieving is giving me a even bigger erection. You are so good at it tbh lmao
---
Very much this. These changes are pushing us towards this route. Risk is nothing, increased risk only mean you potentially pay a higher cost when doing something. Emphasis on potentially because if you are faster than the other guy the bear will eat him.
---
The blackout changed this and introduced much more tedium plus certain things that are without counters. It needs balancing. On top of that the cyno change is introduced which only brings about more tedium and more things to do. At some point its just easier to not do it and I think its already passed that for many.
---
Combine this with the rest of the tedium from fozzie sov and citadels and so on and it just becomes too much. 
---
TL:DR, People are stuck in risk/reward thought and are refusing to hear any criticism regarding that it was simply unfun in NS before these changes and its even worse now. Keep doing it and it will fast become too boring to do.
---
hi friend, what are you doing in eve now that cyno changes don't benefit you? before i quit and came back recently I remember you being a fellow bloppyboi. whatever it is, i hope it's fun! (✿◠‿◠)
---
Everyone knows the changes said BLOPs can fit a cyno, I was in a bit of a hurry and happened to leave it out.
---
I was aware about how usless that poor ship has become since the ECM nerf, but toally missed the slots distribution compared to the other blops; thanks for the answer.
---
Ok but REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

this is actually the only redeeming action ccp can take at this point. sure, maybe you dont know what youre doing over there, any more, but at least prove to us that you had to read stainguy's posts all these years like the rest of us with a little nod ingame...

Oh no dont go. Where will i obtain my highest quality salt yet now. It is so fun that you keep assuming that i was victim of a suicide gank to feel better about yourself lmao. You are sad little fuck :d Theres some progress though, you did not try to tidy up your comment this time. Looks like i hit a jackpot there. Stay salty xoxo
---
I’m okay with being a douchebag to the douchebag poster.  
---
Fully willing to call it even, but if you want to get into a semantics debate about professional journalism to justify you calling others wrong but allowing yourself to be so
---
Shush

Ahh. Yeah, that would be a bit rough then. Thanks!
---
"want to sell your mom... used a lot" Seems pretty clear to me. OP you sure you aren't the dumdum?
---
I never want peace and stability again. LONG LIVE THE CHAOS!
---
You're moving a 2b+ capital ship with a 300m ship.
---
 Sounds imminently reasonable- this isn't even a huge risk of your isk, it's just a fairly substantial one... For a huge reward; moving a giant small gang wrecking machine across new Eden.
---
Not salty at all.  Not cancelling my accounts.  Not headed to HS.  Just have a longer term view than a few weeks particularly since some Chaos changes are announced not implemented yet.
---
Long live the Derptron!
---
The little panic attack when you see some notifications....
---
Nobody:
---
Op: Mittaniiiiiiiiiii
---
:/
---
Problem is...   just before the summer started and CCP had that last discount sale I re-upped all my accounts for a year.   So if subs are any indication the fallout won’t hit them until next year...
---
That said I don’t mind the blackout.    Tho I think some balance vs bombers is needed.   This cyno thing...   hmm.  I reserve judgment as a wait in see how it really plays out.  That said CCP is making big changes very fast and I honestly cannot see how they are going to glean any meaningful data from it.
---
Very much. They want the cake and eat it.
---
I was thinking this, this would be EvE 2.0, but both would be connected so not a 100% fresh restart. Maybe the current empires band together to fight what's on the other side. So many years have passed that we have no idea if there are even other people, or maybe they have advanced to much that they are a huge threat.
---
You just call them names then run to senpai Falcon and daddy Hilmar to nerf you even harder. Oh wait, thats not gonna work is it?
---
&gt; It is so fun that you keep assuming that i was victim of a suicide gank to feel better about yourself lmao. You are sad little fuck :d 
---
I mean it's pretty fucking obvious. Wouldn't have written those essays if it wasn't heartfelt. How can you see your screen through the tears to call others salty lmao
---
&gt;Theres some progress though, you did not try to tidy up your comment this time. 
---
Seriously what do you mean by "tidy up your comment"? Not heard anyone else use that phrase. 
---
&gt;Looks like i hit a jackpot there. Stay salty xoxo
---
The only jackpot was the one whoever ganked you hit. Was it a Plex tanked shuttle or something? By the looks of it they took a little piece of your soul as well as your ISK. Cry more.
---
they could just have any highsec/lowsec connections visible by default and just have nullsec ones require to be scanned down, I guess you could say concord scanned them .
---
Your argument works for any game. Should every game cost the same?
---
Also comparing real life things and a game is complicated. Best is buying cheap alcohol and doing a eve lan party with the club money.
---
so do i
---
would need to be at least rookie ships, how we meant to mine or kill stuff in a pod?
---
It doesn’t really work for every game. I just meant to say that EVE is great value for money.
---
Jesus christ.  Paragraphs and taking breaths are your friend.  
---
Orcas are force multipliers.  They increase time on target and multiplicatively impact barges/exhumers.  The more hulls you have mining, the better your results will be.  
---
I can fill an orca in with ice in 45 minutes or less with 4 covetors and boosts.  Hulks would do it in 30 or so.    
---
Also, cycle times will vary, on an ice harvester, the best I've seen was 36 seconds, and covetors can hold 3 cycles before turning off.  If you are using expensive mining drones, you can reliably beat anything short of a hulk.  What you aren't accounting for is travel time.
---
Yes mining in a barge/exhumer costs APM, but it rewards stacking immensely.  Otherwise you would see fleets of 20 orcas on grid instead of 19 skiffs and an orca.
---
I was actually just memeing; I dont want a LowSec gate to Stain
---
Just a quick question for the OP: Do you understand the difference between explicit and implicit?
---
Just a simple yes or no.
---
&gt; Why are pve players obligated to be fodder for pvp players?
---
Because hunters are the risk you take when you try to capitalize on nullsec rewards.  Don't want hunters, go krab for less in high sec.  It's the fundamental risk-reward balance of nullsec, and it's been imbalanced in favor of the reward for far too long.
---
If Earth survived (they went through the EVE Gate due to overpopulation), many people estimate that Terrans would be about Tech 9. In comparison, Joves are estimated Tech 5; and the empire being at absolute best Tech 3.
---
I keep writing those because it is so fun to trigger people like you. And you still can't comprehend this which makes it even more delicious. And we are back to making cute little comments again, individually quoting my writings and trying to come up with something for each of them. So cute. And also obligatory imaginative suicide gank post. Keep it up mate, your salt is top notch.
---
I'm not sure I want to invest 6.6 billion into a tanky cyno ship... but yeah, I suppose it is indeed possible to get 600k+ EHP on a Widow.

Good. Instant unstoppable infinite reinforcements through a cyno on a fucking mining ship should never have been possible anyway.

The only impressive thing about this post is the effort used to capitalize every word. Quality 1/10 Effort 3/10.

I couldnt agree more with you . 10/10. Amen

It is almost like capitals are designed to be support ships instead of stand-alone vessels.

Hmmmm...

Hmmmmmmmmm....

Maybe spelling (questionable, never had any particular problems), but I can tell you that when it comes to grammar English is like 1000 times easier than Italian, French, German, pretty much any other language has more complex rules. It's very easy to pick up for anyone coming from a more complex language I feel like.

I think spearfishing with the cyno is a really cool idea, don't get me wrong. But the current grid sizes are something like 20,000km and I believe can stretch beyond that.

The way things have been for years, if an organized entity was willing to throw enough resources at you there was a near 100% chance of losing you shit with no counterplay.

---
CHAOS ERA CONTINUES!!
---
Not sure if bait or real, but go fuck yourself, your formatting gave me a headache.
---
I think a lot of people are going to scoff at it because using disposable cynos essentially allowed you to use caps for cheap logistics.  Ie, I need some more ratting ships in this pocket, I'll load them in to my carrier at staging and then jump it over.  If I get attacked, oh well, I lost a rookie ship.
---
Of course, that's the point of this; it makes it more expensive, difficult, and risky to move caps around.  It can change the geography somewhat.
---
Though with that said, losing a cyno ship was pretty rare for me, and despite frequently lighting covert cynos on a station when using a Blops for logistics (Could use it to portal a covops ship to a jump beacon, then have that ship move to a station, light a covert cyno, and jump in a blockade runner full of expensive stuff in complete safety), I never lost a ship running a covert cyno.  It'll be interesting to see how this changes casually moving a capital around your space outside of combat situations.
---
It's always funny to hear them speak in another language because they usually are absolutely terrible and have the thickest accent. Not like they really need to know anything else, but they are making fun of guys that speak probably 2-3 languages while they barely speak the easiest one
---
I cant even imagine what Tech 9 ships/items would be like.
---
I disagree. You are moving a 2+bil ship got 300 mil a jump. If you are a small entity you'd better build your own caps, buying and moving them will likely cost more than the cap itself.
---
The only high isk activity in nullsec is super ratting or rorqual multiboxing. This means in your world all sub cap ratters should move back to highsec because risk vs reward is completely out of balance for those players in the direction of risk, and ccp continues to increase their risk.
---
Lol, this post is so fkin funny.   
---
''bouhou, i cant farm my perfectly safe spot printing isk, to be able to throw titan at ppl with my 30 account''
---
You think you're the only one spending time and effort here ? 
---
\-Adapt or Die.
---
­
---
Solo pvp is a thing.  Inject into a supercarrier or titan and buy them from any of the free market keepstars
---
Then fly to the nearest nullsec sov space and start blaming the defenders with your infinite winboat
---
If they kill you it’s ok just buy more plex to reship and try a different region
---
Yet being able to jump a capital to a cyno that cost less than 5mil seems totally reasonable to you?
---
It seems reasonable to you because it's easier, requires less investment, and because you've never had to work harder than that to move your capitals.
---
And unless you're flairbaiting us here; why the fuck do you care with all the cyno beacons your alliance already has?
---
Why make them indestructable. Just give them 1 reinforce and if there is no more connection well bad luck trying to get a wh there
---
You can also use a Blops' ability to create jump portals to easily get a covops frigate to a jump beacon, and then have that light a covops cyno on a local citadel or something to jump through, so that can make jump freighter logistics in friendly space easier since you don't have to spend as much time moving cynos around.
---
I'm looking for a hidden messages with the capital letters but I gave up

If the recon pilot has a brain, he'll save a ping on warp-in, slowboat out of the bubble, and warp back to it.

Of course, that's little more thinking than a lot of pilots can do.

Sure, but do you have any remotely reasonable evidence that it was done for the purpose of getting people to spend more money on training?
---
I need to show this to my Brazilian wife... I am struggling with learning Portuguese...  she has no sympathy since she knows Portuguese, Spanish, English, and German...
---
thank you very much for the fit, i guess the fit i had was missing the power relays ...and the second shield extender 😓
---
This only affects no risk cucks who use rookie ships to cyno their capital fleets between stations.
---
Anyone with a cyno cloaky T3 hunter alt doing Black ops fleets are going to have the skills dude. I have 4/10 sympathy.
---
Yeehaw motherfucker
---
and also the recon is very vulnerable
---
Where?
---
Sure, someone has, in the past.
---
So how would that be a cash grab?
---
Yeah now you just need three highly skilled pilots on three separate accounts to do what you could do with one highly skilled JF and a one day old character.
---
Not the first 5mil
---
i just started this game and im having a great time. it's been so fun just mining, hauling and manipulating the market for profit in small ways. it's been fun learning the way of new eden through the corp i joined and i can't wait to get some fun stories out of this incredible game. thank you all for having an awesome and fun community ^_^
---
Yeah but if we nerf income creation then it’s gonna be a credit card game.
---
But are you compelled to spend cash money? Not really.
---
Okay....
---
It's not very hard to Plex accounts.
---
Maybe you know this one already, but one that I found not too long ago that has become second nature to me is CTRL + W. It will close the active window.   
---
Bonus, it works in Windows too (explorer windows and other stuff)!
---
I think they rotate who gets to do events and game updates every other week or something
---
That's the consensus. CCP's super tight-lipped about it though. 
---
The actual thing that people think happens (but I don't want to be too adamant about this): when you clear an anom in one system, it pops up in another system in the same region. I don't know if anyone has any idea whether it's the same type of anom or not.
---
Now, what if in nullsec they respawned in a \_different\_ region... ))))
---
caldari/amarr/minmatar lowsec are all pretty active depending on your timezone.  dual web thrasher/coercer is a pretty standard buy in to get you started.

I do not have access to all three. It is/was my plan - I simply answered the question presented to me. I never skill injected, slowly learning mechs depending on situations.
---
I will wait and see for now...
---
Followed by the hardcore Flemish who add even more atchaic rules and exceptions (had*t* gij?)
---
you act like you are doing this solo, and if you are you deserve to get something blown up. most people who would be moving such a ship would have help from corp or alliance members, thus lowering the chance of something getting destroyed.
---
You’re high sir. You can just covert cyno now it’s pretty easy to do in a stealth bomber.
---
It’s not gonna be risky at all. Just have the cyno + a few legions fitted for cap transfer. Cyno &amp; transfer in the cap &amp; lite the next cyno.
---
Goods could do it with 3-4 people with 3-4 alts.
---
this is the kind of chaos I can get behind
---
EVE 'Themed'?
---
So..what, make a lasagna and call it minmatar slave rations?
---
almost like most of the rest of the world has sensible gun ownership policies, huh, weird
---
More that PVE should be seen as a means to an end rather than as the end itself. At least in null sec, high sec is another thing.
---
I know a lot of hardcore industry people who are very actively involved in running or participating in fleets, and I consider them to be some of the best players in the game for their ability to master so many aspects of it. But I'm fed up with people who only mine and refuse to defend their space and actively push to make Eve safer. This isn't Farmville.
---
Triglavians are meant to be endgame pve, so try to avoid the systems they're in. If they're in your home system go on an adventure somehwere else for a bit.
---
That being said I am not super experienced and I've had sime limited success ninja salvaging in invasion systems.

---
Put on 2 large nos and 2 large smart bombs cloak and cyno
---
Is it worth it to save a some rorqs? Maybe yes maybe no.
---
This makes escalation massively more difficult, and I suspect that we will see far fewer mid-large size capital brawls because of the insane logistical difficulty of trying to be the second person to get on grid.
---
Cyno recons will die instantly to any large subcap fleet, but the far bigger problem is that none of the available cyno ship options can survive the alpha of even a few Cap gun dreads. When that cyno goes up, the ship stops moving. Once it stops moving, those capital guns apply perfectly, and suddenly you're getting volleyed for huge chunks of EHP. No matter how much you wanna brick tank that Widow or Redeemer, it's going to eat ship well before even 50% of your big ass capital fleet gets through that cyno. And if you can't get your caps on field in a reasonable manner for a big fight, you're liable not to take it at all.
---
Any other options such as jumping to an off grid cyno have their own large host of challenges.
---
Ccp not being a charity, for a start
---
Eve is dying. CCP is doing it's best to chase players away..  I wouldn't put any money in this shitty game. Log in play for free. Dont get too invested . The game will be dead in 6 months
---
I'm not talking about combat usage, I'm talking about just moving caps around.
---
why?  this is the eve all play now in forums
---
Go AFK.  
---
Die.  
---
Tearz.
---
This right here
---
But there's not really a reason to go to war. Every region has the resources it needs to do whatever the fuck you want. It leads to turtling. If there was some reason to go to another region then you would have more conflict drivers. 
---
Real human drama only gives so much conflict. 
---
And yeah some people just like to rat and mine, but in null sec you shouldn't be 95% safe doing it. The changes in the last part of the post is more of a way to give the sub cap roaming gangs the ability to not be dropped by every super and Titan it comes by. Im not saying that a small gang roam should be able to kill the Titan, but I am saying that the Titan should not be able to kill that small gang pretty much instantly or without help like vindis and target painters. 
---
You would still get blapped by a larger group, sure, but at least it takes a little bit more than a bookmark on a gate and timing. 
---
I do think the huge super cap and Titan meta right now leads to more risk adverse wars as well. The goon war from earlier this year was literally just grinding down structures. Just ratting with no ticks. 
---
And sure, test and friends is fighting frat and friends, and titans are dying and rstting supers are still getting killed, but if you want to encourage more players to go and PvP, and have more interesting fights, make capitals be supported again. 
---
And yeah, the alt army is real, but can you ever truly stop that.0
---
r/evejobs
---
Too bad all those players unsubbed in protest.  They could have killed a GM instead.  Guess they'll never know what they missed.
---
Any orca that gets killed by the recons is afk. Even the worst fit have time to warp out.
---
Hopefully this year they at least attempt to cover multiple time zones. Last time this was the start of a series of events that completely skipped USTZ (other than the weekend iirc). :(
---
Saving over 3 billion and only losing 100k doesn't seem nearly as bad, and might actually be worth having around in case someone needs to be a hero for a super, titan, or a rorq gang. I like it.

If you're looking for nullsec solo dunks, use a T3C probably a Loki but anything but the Proteus could work
---
If LowSec semi-consensual PvP, I mean yeah just take out frigates or destroyers or whatever ship class you want to fit into gates of
---
Ok, let's break it down for you:
---
&gt;There is no local now, less intel for intel channels and less auto warning programs for afk miners.
---
Which means said miners benefit from being within a larger group.  First, more fish in the sea means each one is less likely to die.  Second, the extra resources of the large group means those hunters are more likely to get caught than in a smaller group.
---
&gt;Not every ratting ship will have a cyno on it, and it now takes twice the toons to be as safe ratting as before. So either risk it or make less money then before.
---
Or be part of a larger group where someone else provides one or more cyno ships.
---
Your hatred of those who play differently has blinded you to the effects of these changes.
---
Now that would be too science fiction!
---
Making it harder is literally the entire point. Logistics at this point in EVE are clearly nowhere near as difficult as CCP wants them to be. And frankly, the ability to move assets around so cheaply and efficiently jn today's EVE is part of the issue that creates sprawling 0.0 empires with little incentive to fight each other.
---
Agreed, Orcas can tank all day. Some losses I've seen recently are just baffling. Who puts cargo expanders on an Orca for example, yet it happens.
---
As an industrial, I have zero sympathy for such losses. Bring on interesting npc interactions to break up mining.
---
World reset
---
Don't discount the Derpcursus.
---
Oh no, using the most powerful ships in the game requires risk and ISK investment!
---
This is what you're looking at, right?
---
Yes? 
---
If you listen to reddit then who're the people roaming null killing everything? Wormholers. 
---
If we weren't out there then null would just be null with no local, not null with no local and cloaked ships everywhere
---
But but but Erberus in Jita?
---
Ah, I don't follow streams much so I missed it. I'll take your word for it, but it doesn't change the fact that their judgement is often bad and they have a tendency to leave their obviously bad design choices in place for years.
---
Omg need a cake with an exotic dancer in the recipe
---
You might want to work as a corp. Have everyone's cyno alt work together to move ships?

Which is sad, bc the events actually looked pretty fun
---
I nearly spat out my drink reading this
---
Yea CCP kind of doesnt want you just flying a super capital around with impunity anymore
---
Your titan is their frigate and they're gonna Super Boson you
---
Because they’re not made of paper. Because you have big balls. Because it’s a game and would be fun.
---
Next move is going to be giving direct connections to all the major regions in the game. Dekline, Delve, Paragon soul, Malpais, Fountain, Tribute. Everything connected by a gate only subs can take. CHAOS!!!!!!
---
Yeah that's what I got. So the idea is the krabs will have this sitting with them cloaked in their mining field, when it decloaks the rorqs will have each 2 100km capital reps each to put on it since cyno module gives it a second rep now. Its a serious tank with only a few rorqs, the links will already be on grid.
---
I'm sure some turbo delve krabs will come up with a much better idea than this though.
---
Ccp falcon??? Or the ship

I love when goons cry
---
I have been saying this since the cyno nerf news broke. Take one of your 4, 5, 6, 20 rorq alts and train them into a recon. Problem solved.
---
None of those are statements of fact that would be in violation of an NDA though.
---
So...citation needed.
---
According to the original post from Rise affecting logistics was a side effect and the focus is mostly on combat.
---
&gt;While most of the impact from this change is on combat, we are &gt;sensitive to the effect on Jump Freighters and logistics overall. &gt;Jump Freighters will be allowed to use Covert Cynos which can be &gt;activated by cheaper hulls like Covert Ops Frigates. This may &gt;need further attention and we will be watching this area very &gt;closely.
---
I don't think that affecting logistics was their target because the didn't touch Jump Beacons which will still allow easy logistics within the sprawling 0.0 empires you mentioned.
---
You're welcome to join my Corp. Just bought my Orca last night for High Sec mining.
---
Great shitpost m8
---
&gt;I bet it would be 3x as bad
---
Well yea it would be because our space is already more dangerous than null.
---
How insane would null be if it lost asset safety like J space?
---
You're bitching because they're making changes to the game that are affected by SP that you have.  Your argument is that because it affects your training queue they're not allowed to touch it because it's a cash grab.  By following your argument, they're not allowed to rebalance anything because anything that ever changes will affect someone's training queue.
---
They're trying to stop capital projection as an impediment to smaller scale engagements, get over yourself and let CCP try and make fighting a little more fun.
---
Driving me nuts. Absolutely infuriating.
---
It's really sad how this game is represented. I heard it was spreadsheets in space and was not at all interested. You absolutely don't have to use spreadsheets to be good at this game. I hadn't even bothered to try it because of all the negative things I heard about it but after trying it for a couple hours I've been hooked for years.
---
“If the recon pilot has a brain”
---
You remember we’re playing eve and talking about miners right
---
Great movie this one
---
All of these changes are punitive, there isnt much thought behind them quite frankly. And they keep using the word faucet and the likes yet nobody has even explained why that is a bad thing. I can guess the reason, prices go up but in reality prices have gone down and not up so people are simply mad that some are making more isk than them by doing isk making activities. Which is really really strange. 
---
And they havent even mentioned that WH isk faucet/capita is far higher than NS, but it remains untouched. I believe the same guy making this post actually made his isk this exact way so you can smell the bias from far away.
---
When you remove all logical reasons, especially the one that this could have been done in a much better way, only thing that remains is punishment. Its literally punishment for doing what CCP told us to do, to build empires. They just thought we were gonna be as bad as they would be at it and underestimated the outcome.
---
Oh thank god, hopefully the GM fleet will drop more of the Combat Medic skins for T1 logi.
---
Just include half the ingredients for a good product, with a promise to iterate on the recipe later.
---
&gt; ~~Krabs~~ Content leaving EVE to play Wow. F

Have hisec empires slowly collapse, creating larger and larger null gaps between them. Concord consolidates into itself to survive and becomes its own Empire, leaving only faction navys for hisec protection, even that dwindling in scale.
---
10/10 clickbait
---
He's PR lol.
---
Yes, he gave his personal opinion recently, but that still doesn't make him in charge of any changes.
---
Flying in a Heron you are kind of a free kill, if someone finds you. However there are two things to say about that
---
1. You're flying in a Heron. Your ship costs about a million ISK. If you die, you lose basically nothing, and you get a new one and go out again. Especially given that on a good day you can warp in to a Guristas or Sansha Crystal Quarry and warp out with 200mil in salvage. (*"Okay, so, I'm carrying a hundred times more than my ship is worth...*")
---
2. \-*If* someone finds you. There are things you can do, and learn to do, that make that happen less
---
* Safe spots. Warp to somewhere, save a bookmark while you're in flight, then warp back to that bookmark and start flying in a random direction (ideally, Aligned to some other safe spot you had saved). You'll be "visible", but you can't be found and attacked unless you get Combat Probed
---
* Prototype Cloaking Device. The more advanced version of the previous point (although you can't do it as an Alpha). As long as you're cloaked in the middle of nowhere, you're completely safe.
---
* Directional Scan (DScan). Manually triggered, commonly spammed, early warning system against anyone else in the area. See Core Probes, get concerned and maybe consider hiding. See Combat Probes, immediately warp somewhere that isn't where you are. Anywhere. And keep warping around until either you can cloak, or the combat probes go away, or you get to a wormhole and escape the system.
---
Immunity just as in local being perfect intel, i.e., not even close to that.
---
Is this basically a funny way of saying you torpedo people to death lol. Also do you just target random people or do players place hits and you go out and kill them?
---
Hi douchebag
---
Big capital battles are nearly impossible after the change.
---
In a large capital battle, you bubble your own fleet.  Crashes are so likely in that you need to prevent your caps from e-warping, because if they e-warp they will be scanned down and easily killed (the game treats them as unpiloted, with all modules offline.  So they die incredibly quickly with base resists and no extenders/plates/reps).
---
Since you bubblefuck your own fleet, no one can warp to your fleet at any distance other than 0.  So there's no way to position your cyno at any location other than 0.  And positioning is a big part of large cap battles, because nobody can move thanks to Siege/Triage, TiDi, bubbles and crashes.
---
You can't overcome this with a cloak, because the density of the cap ball is so high you will always be within 2000m of something and be decloaked.
---
But let's ignore that for the moment, and pretend you managed to get a warp-in for your cyno from magically indestructible interceptors.
---
You can get a BLOPS up to something like 400k EHP with a relatively sane fit, or maybe 600k EHP if you want to bling the fuck out of it and use heat and links.  400k-600k EHP gets alphaed by a mass of supers.  All the people pontificating about dedicating faxes to the cyno ship have no idea what they're talking about, because the cyno ship will be dead long before anyone exits the warp tunnel...assuming any cap can even hit "jump" fast enough.
---
"Have it warp in 100km away so the fighters can't get to it instantly!!"  Well, then the titans and any LR dreads kill it.  Tracking isn't an issue at that distance, and the ship is stopped anyway in order to light the cyno.
---
TL:DR - This change means the first side to get it's supers on grid wins, and the other side will not show up because they can't.
---
Could you please point out these mythical krabbers for me? Like give me 1 name.
---
I unsubbed two paid accounts because of this change.
---
This was a great idea. I mean its a fking joke that we now have to risk 500m everytime we want to move a ship.
---
\#AlreadyAdaptedDumbass
---
so were battleships and dreadnaughts and literally every other ship they introduced when scaling up
---
Starting a post here with "I was AFK ratting/mining..." is a surefire way to get 0 sympathy. Add failing to read patch notes and I'm surprised you haven't been burned at the stake yet.
---
Its always been about killing stuff that cant fight back. Now that they are getting less kills in NS they are gonna force us to feed them in another way.
---
So you agree with me, great!
---
Following up to that, with the collapse of empires, displaced and angry citizens may question the value of Capsuleers and their vaulted status in the universe, resulting in loss of clone services in some areas and etc.
---
Of course, there is a lot of factors.
---
Alphas can light cynos?! That seems like an oversight.
---
Lowsec solo PVP is very much alive and kicking, with plenty oportunities for both solo and small gang stuff going (besides the swarms of FW mission runers and defensive plexing bots that you could also try to catch if you are feeling bored).
---
Rookie carriers.
---
But they're still nullified and can warp around to board Recons.
---
But I guess All those FAX alts will just train into Cloaky Recons and stay on grid with the main accounts Supercarrier.
---
The new changes make cyno inhibitors obsolete since the cyno is way outside and far away from the Super, I guess thats more effective tbh. Just have your alt cloaked on grid 100km away. Bombers need to travel to shoot at it and can't inhibit but Titans and Super can jump in and Avatars still hit up to 150km+ with lenses in haws.
---
Adapted to being one of the most prolific crybabies r/eve has ever seen, gz
---
All of the Goon streamers: "Oh, it'll be fine, we'll all just have our FR alts on grid with us.. DEERRRRRRRRP!!!"
---
lol, good luck with that. Enjoy it. Ironically it will become an actual Clusterfuck.. so maybe now's the time to do some retro-re-branding, Alex.
---
Blapp Blapp.. herrrrrrrrrrrppp.. toot toot... deeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp.
---
Try r/evejobs for recruitment stuff
---
I agree, also the Minmatar logo is hard to see, being black and overlapping with the shadowed side of the ship. Also not sure what is going on in the bottom right.
---
The image coloring and shading style is on point though!
---
How much of that support was your own chars again?:)
---
every cyno is gonna have like ~3 secs of life assuming perfect play from the attackers due to server ticks and locking time, you can light multiple(in a super fight might as well not use blops btw, cause sig) if that's not enough for people to click jump well...
---
The most powerful ship in the game is friendship
---
the big groups kind of need to feed their fight beast more then the small groups and more or less wear them out.
---
Ah, so the Stork might be better?
---
You aren't accounting for how hard the game shits itself in a large tidi situation. You are also talking about 200 people responding on 3 seconds.
---
I move caps solo all the time without getting blown up.
---
Inhibs counter slow and unprepared cynos.
---
They are used on many whaling fleets because they work.
---
If you want to continue operating as you were they kinda are.
---
Probably another one of the great ideas Falcon "floated" to Helmar.
---
So you play smart
---
That's not actually decent evidence.
---
The reason behind the change could be "it'll make the game better, which will translate into more money" but that doesn't make it a cashgrab.
---
Being for profit doesn't mean that every single change is purely motivates by its ability to get people to spend money.
---
But also, if your point is people will play the game more, then the cash grab would be a good thing.
---
But really, there is no reason to think it's a cash grab.
---
My question is how many people should it take to use carriers/rorqs to rat/mine in Null Sec? Should it just be one person out in space while their corp mates are offline in relative safety? Making absurd amounts of isk per hour? I'm actually curious about the mindset surrounding capitals. Should they be able to operate solo without the need for sub-capital support? Why or why not?
---
Couldn't the super fit a remote rep or 2 to keep on the cyno, or the reps aren't just good enough?
---
Stork definitely better. But it's a much higher SP and ISK investment, and I've really only used it in fw lowsec
---
Ty based lasker
---
Lmao who the fuck wants to fly a ship that can get swatted like a fly if they can just pay and jump in a super? They will always prefer to fly something actually fun over useless blinged our garbage like ratting battle ship when pennies on the dollar will get them in a ratting carrier instead. Holy fuck dude it’s basic Econ
---
Wow wow chill dude.
---
If we are willing to build safety in a sandbox then thats our right. End of story. Its not up to you or CCP to suddenly change the rules because you dont like what we did with the sandbox. Instead you could add other content to satisfy the other party.
---
And small gangs are amongst the most risk averse group I have ever seen. We get SRP plus we have isk so we really dont give a shit if we die. And before you respond, its not without reason nanofits and cloaky ships are the meta amongst small gang.
---
&gt; they're not allowed to rebalance anything because anything that ever changes will affect someone's training queue.
---
except as we've seen from all previous rebalances - that isn't true as they've held the mantra of "if you could fly it before, you can fly it now" and no rebalance has ended in people being unable to fly ships etc that they were previously able to.
---
Make a friend instead of an alt.
---
&gt; but that doesn't make it a cashgrab.
---
no, the fact that it's a cash grab makes it a cash grab.
---
making people pay out more to continue doing what they're alreay doing is nothing but a blaitent cash grab.
---
Everyone says I don't sound like it but I only joined the game (almost exactly) one year ago. I joined with a group of 8 friends. We were hisec miners for about a week or two, then one of our guys said "Hey guys, I heard there's a lot of money you can make from exploration in wormholes, wanna try that?" So we got some ships together, and found a wormhole, and jumped in, and got instakilled by some guys from Against Probes who were camping the hole and we were like "WELP let's try that again but maybe not 3 jumps out of Jita" And then somehow or another our leaders got contacted by someone from another wormhole group and we did a quick interview and all joined immediately and so with a grand total of 3 weeks of play time under our belts we were now Wormholers^(btw). ... And then all but 2 of us quit within the next two weeks, but the two of us who stuck around went through several months of learning, improvements, dramatically (and incorrectly) being declared traitors and thrown out, joining a different group who were much more aggressive, having a bunch of fun with them, then watching that group dissolve and reform itself into another even *more* aggressive group, and This is around the time when the Blackout hit. And our response was Much Rejoicing, because basically of the interactions I'd had with nullsec groups either involved flying around and seeing everyone dock up because "oh no somebody in local", or suddenly capitals in my face and dodging bosons in destroyers. (Except for this one time with some Russians where we all got so confused that first they shot me, then they gave *me* drones, then I went away... Really don't know what happened that day.)
---
Completely apropos of nothing, Loki is best ship. I currently own one Loki hull (which was given to me as a gift), and 13 sets of modules to refit it with to fill different roles and fleets. Best skill train ever, and CCThanks for the mega SP event a few months back that let me get it.
---
So yeah. Blackout has given me a lot more random spice on the null roams I've been on more recently, and strategically I'm looking forward to the cyno change because on the one hand, it doesn't damage my play at all because I'm not reliant on caps or jump bridges (Jump Bridge? You mean The Hard Knocks Wormhole Generator?) but it takes people who do want to deploy caps, and makes them ask more questions about whether or not it's worth it to deploy them, and what other logistics and planning they need to do to give themselves that option. (Although personally I had been proposing the 'Cyno Spool Up' idea; I never imagined CCP would go for restricting what ships could light cynos.)
---
(And really, I've seen a lot of people complaining about burning 50mil on a bomber or 300mil on a Recon to either move a JF or bring in some caps, and my internal thought is "Dude, if you have the financial backing and resources to own a group of carriers, you have the finances and resources to own a force recon ship. And if you can't own a recon, you probably shouldn't own a Thanatos." Sort of a logical extension of the "only fly what you can replace" philosophy.)
---
Well imagine if you fked up real bad and introduced something that people didnt like (drifters, blackout) and its starting to show. Ofc you have to conjure up more numbers somehow. Before this is over all of will have to be multiboxers, even in HS.
---
It doesn't matter if you have a recon alt cloaked up. Think about the process that's going to go down now.
---
Ratting super gets tackled. Tacklers drop and inhib that takes 1 min to anchor. You as the super pilot now have 1 min to light your cloaked up recon cyno. This means you have 1 minute to form a response fleet that can cyno in immediately as your recon is gonna get insta blapped. 
---
Ok so you don't cyno in immediately. Whats the next plan? Move your recon to 200km? Ok so now you get no fax reps cause they're gonna just have catch bubbles up. Titans? Nope HAW won't hit anything. Your only response is Supers/Carriers. Which are just gonna get fighters absolutely murdered out that far.
---
People don't understand that having a forced recon alt is not the solution and will not help people.
---
i appreciate anchorsteamale. he's made me feel welcome as a new member in the corp.
---
I know gahhhhh
---
I agree with 1. - Make the deployable structures in space better. Instant cyno inhibs with better EHP.
---
damn...........

Sort of like how other play styles have been punished or under served in the changes before blackout? You have to decide for yourself if the activities that are impacted by these changes hurt everyone's gameplay, or just your specific style of it.
---
It's definitely better than that Bergmann garbage.
---
Wormholes are fun. Lots of empty space surrounded in supreme dangerousness at times. Makes it interesting :-D
---
There's an important thing to consider here that I think you're missing.   
---
Capital ships, rorquals especially, were never intended to be a solo revenue stream. The game worked out that way and for people who have come on board in the past 3 - 5 years, this probably seems normal and like ccp are taking something away from you. For others of us who have been here 10-15 years, it looks more like something very broken that is finally maybe getting fixed.   
---
Capital ships in their design and vision from CCP were always intended to be an alliance asset, that the entire group would have to work towards and support. If you use a capital ship, it should be the centerpiece of the fleet and it should require substantial support from other ship classes.  
---
Rorquals are no different. Originally they could not mine at all, and the runaway economic growth in nullsec is in a large part due to CCP adding enormous mining capabilities to rorquals and turning them into a solo industrial powerhouse that does not need any other ship in a belt with it in order to be effective and safe.   
---
This shouldn't really be possible. The recent nerfs to rorquals have seen them return to a support vessel in many regions where a cheap rorqual will be used to provide links, compression and panic for a fleet of barges. This is great, that's always how they were intended to be used.   
---
Cyno changes shouldn't mean that you have to change your income stream, it means that your support network will have to adapt and become proactive rather than reactive. All of us in eve have evolved into a very lazy way of playing. We sit in our citadel and wait for somebody to find us content, somebody to get tackled who needs saving. Small gang guys are no different to the big blocks, we also have ping warriors and content creators, even in corps with just a dozen active people.   
---
As a 12 year vet this I believe the biggest difference between the "golden years" of last decade and today. In the past everyone was out doing something most of the time, we didn't have out of game tools to ping when something was happening, you had to be in game and paying attention, and you had to very proactively defend the assets your corp/alliance put in space, and roam and scout your own space.  
---
Mining rorquals after September patch will need to be proactively supported and defended by the alliance. Personally I really don't think that this is an unreasonable thing.
---
not good enough, and even if they were any cynoship will just get alpha'd by a sufficiently large gang.  Best case cyno scenario would be a widow full brick tanked with rorq reps in a belt, and even then with links, it pushes about 200k ehp.  A goon or bb bomber gang will practically alpha that.
---
Oh shit--
---
Then Just train an alt into a Cloaky Recon and have him 100km outside of Inhibitor Range on Grid with ya Ships.
---
If you get dropped and someone anchors an Inhibitor just decloak and light Cyno.
---
Armor Titans and Dreads have about 150km+ Optimal with Lenses on Haws, Fighters Travel at 25km/s on some Nyxes.
---
Getting into Range is no Problem.
---
Also the Recon is safe since Bombers need to burn to him and the fire, Wolfpack bombers have like 50km range and their Torpedos are fucking slow so that gives you like 20sec or more of active Cyno time.
---
Fly anything outside of frigs day 1. Gl.
---
On the first point, do you mind throwing an asterisk on all the limited/special edition ships? Which I believe are just 5-9 right?
---
This won't help anything. Lighting a cyno 200km off does nothing for your response fleet. The only useful thing you can bring in is a subcap fleet. Fax and titans are to far to do anything, Supers will just get all their fighters murder zoned flying them that far. 
---
You can't warp down cause they will have catch bubbles.
---
I've heard of them, not seen them myself. I have seen reports of people mining and spotting them, but... not being bothered. Thus i've just gona with the assumption that (like most things in HS, see npc miners and the autothysian) these roaming NPC's don't fire first.
---
For a T1 it’s a beefy little powerhouse. A bit too slow, though, such that double-web armor-tanking fits are more common than they ought to be.
---
Fine, but then you have to deal with polarization on gates.... Deal?
---
THE PROPHET WAS REAL! REPENT, HEATHENS!
---
yea the merlin is a great Armor brawler with double webs
---
-pro tip
---
Ratting super gets tackled. Tacklers drop and inhib that takes 1 min to anchor. You as the super pilot now have 1 min to light your cloaked up recon cyno. This means you have 1 minute to form a response fleet that can cyno in immediately as your recon is gonna get insta blapped.
---
Keep in mind that once someone is close to you, you can't cloak. The range is 2000m (or 2500m?...), and expect fast ships on gate to head toward where you cloaked with drones out to try and uncloak you. This applies even with covops cloaks, although much harder to catch.
---
You can also sometimes jump into a system, and wrecks/drones/bodies/ships/cans can be within cloak range, preventing cloak. This is rare as well but does happen.
---
Good players know which ships can fit covert ops cloaks, so if they see you in one of those ships they know you have to uncloak to warp eventually.
---
nothing should be balanced around the game pretty much not working anymore, also most super fights aren't such absurd tidi as sub 10(and I sure won't cry for the death of those, even though they won't die)
---
&gt;You are also talking about 200 people responding on 3 seconds.
---
my comment specifically said with near perfect play, that delay is roughly based on server ticks
---
&gt;WH-Space should be the dangerous thing in the game and its getting the safest.
---
Wh space doesn't have cynos, so people get to fight with subcaps vs subcaps, giving everyone an equal fitting instead of a cap blob. Wh space is definitely more spookier than null but it's not really that dangerous overall if you know what you're doing.
---
&gt;Its not a big deal for large alliances.
---
The number of large alliance members complaining here indicates otherwise. But hey, they can have those faxes ever present for each rorq for as long as they get tired of it. :P and that'll be soon because it is super expensive to have all these alts in capital should around to save you, but they don't actually increase your ratting or mining income.
---
So this is a positive development from the previous system where people had complete ratting safety by having a cyno in their cap.
---
Anything that makes nullbears farm less, or makes it more expensive to rat/mine is a huge positive for the game- it reduces Plex prices and strangles the over production of capitals.
---
This is the great balancing at last!
---
you are missing the point, yes you should go to hisec then lowsec and figure shit out, no you wont get to be afk, yes you will have fun.
---
Before the blackout, sure it was.
---
Now... I don't know.
---
I started playing 2 months ago and I joined karmafleet 3 weeks ago. I'm very exited for the cyno changes because it seems like anything that moves get dropped on. It's annoying when I'm in a 30 man jackdaw fleet and they drop a Titan and 400 carriers on you, and it's also ridiculous when I light my myrmidons cyno because of a hound and 3 carriers warp to me. Overall the game seems very fun and in depth, however skillpoints are a huge barrier for just about anything, and most ships take months to train into.
---
I mean, I have suspicions.
---
- the ships chosen are both Tech 2 ships that require a spaceship command V and a support skill V
---
- the change is announced with relatively short notice, just a month, which is shorter than Cruiser V + EGU V training time if you are not on a per/will remap. The only way to get cyno capability back on time is to inject.
---
- Low SP ships are explicitly included, thing like T1 bc or T1 BS.
---
You can argue that getting people to inject by having high SP requirements is not the primary design consideration, but it certainly is a happy coincidence.
---
Ah you cant compare them. You cant create overpowered things and then nerfing them and calling that changing core mechanics of the game.
---
&gt; making people pay out more to continue doing what they're alreay doing is nothing but a blaitent cash grab.
---
Except it isn't intentionally making people pay more to continue what they already doing.
---
So, that would make it not a cashgrab.
---
It would require that being the primary intent of the decision, which you have no evidence it is.
---
You can think it's a bad idea without blatantly misrepresenting it.
---
See you in two months.
---
Ye you are third partying. If you like to insert yourself into other peoples discussion feel free.
---
Oh this again.
---
\*twitches in Finnish\* Although at least Finnish has consistent pronunciation of letters, none of that random English shit where words written completely differently can be pronounced the same.
---
Yeah you're right, i should have just reposted someone elses content like your last post
---
&gt; You can argue that getting people to inject by having high SP requirements is not the primary design consideration, but it certainly is a happy coincidence.
---
That's all it needs to not have it be a cash grab.
---
You clearly don't understand what triggering mean. It is what is happening to you atm. And I keep laughing at you lmao. Now you are just being sad. If you expect me to quote every comment of yours, I won't do that, it is just too much of work. Rather gonna keep writing to you and observe the salt. Keep dreaming salty boi and keep being salty. We are reaching salt levels that shouldn't even be possible. LMAO
---
Oh, and when you think it's a bright idea to set the structure alarm as an alarm for getting up in the morning. But at the same time, nothing gets me up in the morning quite so quickly.
---
Have a funny story where it went off, I basically shouted FUCK and ran to the computer and tried to see the situation, then realized it was my phone waking me up. My girl was NOT amused at 5 in the morning.
---
Im done with this discussion.
---
Yeah I played a few months here and there in the last 2 years. Is there anything else than repeating the same 3 missions per level over and over?
---
Well that just isn't as common of an occurance as you are making it out to be, too much drinking in of the /r/eve coolaid
---
That already happens.
---
80 out of 4500 votes
---
Near perfect play is easy in tidi because you have time to react. You will be able to watch the ship warp in and be ready to lock it the moment warp ends.
---
&gt; Except it isn't intentionally making people pay more to continue what they already doing
---
yes it is.
---
this isn't going to be a bug, it's a planned and announced change.
---
Excellent. I don't suppose there's one about apostrophe abuse in plurals is there?
---
This doesn't change the fact that - when you're moving just a handful of ships - cost is quickly ramping up, especially if you're trying to sneak through hostile space. Losing incyno is guaranteed if you don't want everyone passing through the system to know who is moving through (unless you inject new cyno alt every time it's possible to make a connection from it to your group - which will be even more absurdly expensive after changes since you can't cynoceptor/cynoastero anymore). Even when you don't care about staying under the radar, if you're not moving through relatively safe friendly space, you can't really stop someone from killing your cyno without taking into consideration risk of being baited by &lt;insert-any-capital-heavy-group&gt; and feeding whatever your cyno defending fleet is.
---
Wow, you are a broken record.
---
WHERE THE HELL DOES ANYTHING REMOTELY INDICATE THAT THIS IS A CHANGE BEING MADE PURELY FOR OR PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING MORE MONEY?
---
Can I be any clearer with this question?
---
Hell, even in your cartoon world, nobody has to spend any cash to inject up new cyno pilots.
---
Big win tbh
---
The harder and more tedious it is
---
The more groups will lock to their blue alliances to prevent losses
---
Regardless of the changes. Goons are still gay.
---
train 5m SP of PI/reactions/etc and turn the accounts in to skill farms.
---
congrats you've got all the industry you could ever want and your accounts won't cost you anything.
---
"I will have to either buy SP to get them to that level, or just wait out doing anything until they catch up."
---
If you got a titan  before SP could be bought then the above two choices are not remarkably new to you.  Also, the couple of billion ISK to buy the SP (if that is your choice) is also not a particular obstacle.
---
And brought back poses
---
WITH DAMAGE CAPS
---
&gt;Almost every suggestion I see includes 'have an alt'. Meaning an alt who is in omega status, which costs money making EvE a hefty investment at thirty dollars a month for some of us. 
---
Then play the game with other people instead of making your own alts.
---
Go ahead and take the risk of trusting your corp mate to light a cyno.
---
It's worth the risk because you're moving a gigantic ship that can take on entire small gangs all by itself. No one should have that kind of power with so little risk.
---
&gt;Why does it matter that null corps are isk fountains?
---
Because that increases the cost of Plex, makes null space dead boring because of capital ship proliferation. Even lowsec is suffering from the same problem. Too many capital ships everywhere.
---
Eve has become a "capital ships online" type of game and it's killing the gameplay for everyone, including null itself.
---
In sum, there has been to much reward in null without enough risk. That is changing permanently and it is already bringing the old players back.
---
im not quite sure how you don't understand that wanting more money to continue to be able to do what you can currently do isn't a cash grab.
---
Please someone deliver on a blue donut recipe
---
I am sorry, I am missing the point. What am I missing or have not learned other than a new income source. It seems to me if I am missing that it's my fault for not using readily available information to learn how to do it. It's certainly not null sec's fault. It very much is not my corp's fault as they provide information in droves.
---
&gt; rng the ship we can fit the cyno on. 
---
could actually be kind of interesting
---
What is a spreadsheet? You mean zkillboard?
---
Neither works for moving supers to hostile space, and using wormholes to move regular capitals (remember, there are no wspace to kspace statics that allow caps, your best bet is getting lucky with direct kspace-kspace connection) is like trying to win a lottery most of the time while still being limited to 3-4 at a time (so, have fun moving moderate size dreadbomb).
---

You seem very credible.
---
his stats are wrong you can check dotlan, and when you check august stats you see he even tried to cherrypick without success.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats/2019-08
---
you will see that 25000 more kills where in july this year than in 2018 but below 2017 stats etc. Also he totally ignores the stats for august (which you can double). You see clearly the PVE activity halfed in July from previous years (faction kills). Ship kills itself is a very strange metric which can be spinned in every direction depending on the will of the writer while faction kills show direct PVE Krabbing.
---
based and redpilled
---
Omfg endgame means exactly that. Best. You grind the best gear, not the worst. And thats why there is no endgame in Eve, nothing is better than anything else. Different situations just require different tools, end of story.
---
 A fking 1m SP players can ruin a battleship pilot with 100m SP in a fight with TDs. That never happens in games that have an endgame.
---
Imperium, Legacy, PanFam, Winter Co., GoTG can afford it ... smaller alliances, not so much. What people have failed to realize is these cyno changes *benefit* large blocs because we'll just have cyno gens in every system in our regions and adapt just fine. In fact, I'll go further and say this cyno change benefits large blocs and will cause more turtling up.
---
To be clear, it isn’t single frigates, it is groups of 3-5, however ZKill and the in game took just read them as a single one due to how it all reads NPC kills and lumps them under the same NPC group
---
If you look at Trig ship kills in invasions they are the same
---
Just use a Falcon or Widow.  If anything tries to shoot you, you can jam it.
---
Was this supposed to be posted on Eve Onion?
---
You could say the "chaos era" forces people to work together to patrol space, gather intel, respond to threats, protect miners, rely on allies to help you move your capitals, pay corp mates to protect you, or give them a cut of your materials from mining, build ships for them. There's a million different ways you could imagine these changes as encouraging cooperation. Which is in my opinion the true spirit of a sandbox. You have to cooperate with allies and work together to dispatch threats to your assets from other players.
---
They are all just repeating what they've been told to say, so it's not surprising they all say the same thing
---
You missed the sarcasm.  This is the kind of salt we have been hearing with regards to the changes:  "Is CCP going to reimburse me all the skill points I have in my rorqual alts now that there is a blackout?" etc.
---
Those skills on the rorqual alts include jump drives for all caps, mining leadership skills (I don't know all of these) and mining and reprocessing skills that are all still useful even if you don't fly the Rorq.
---
As to nerfing the gameplay of a particular ship....   welcome not just to Eve but to practically every videogame meta in existence.
---
We called the lurch HICs hatefuckers :(   it was a sad day when they fixed that shit.
---
hehe spreadsheets...
---
There's a Flex structure
---
not really.
---
Join a corp with a name shared by a Nazi military branch? No thanks, big yikes.
---
It’s actually the opposite. Hard logistics over long distances encourages creating blue supply lines and consolidation. Making logistics more difficult will not make it possible for smaller groups to thrive. It will simply encourage people to band together more and cooperate more in order to work together to overcome the difficulties.
---
&gt; isn't a cash grab
---
Because a cash grab requires money to be the PRIMARY GOAL.
---
Where are you getting the idea that that is the case?
---
Also, where are you getting the idea that this will even translate into more cash in CCPs pocket? No cash has to go CCPs way for this to change.
---
Those are 2 things you aren't addressing that would be required for it to be a cash grab.
---
So, ABC style.
---
Is this change being made PRIMARILY for the purpose of more money going to CCP?
---
If so, how is this making more money go to CCP?
---
And, how do you know this is being changed PRIMARILY for this cashflow?
---
Space Texas sounds like a good place
---
true... changing the game to be like it was when it was more popular is PROBABLY a bad idea
---
Yes 1 thing. That in no way can cause those numbers. I mean, honestly, belive it or not. 
---
What they show us isnt the same as what they know. You are still missing the per capita thing. There is no math created by man that can explain why 5% are making 50% of what 40% are making. There simply isnt. And you can spin around that as much as you want.
---
No its not. Removing local was an aggressive approach.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Light fighters can cover 200km very comfortably. If there's a cyno inhib already up, you're just facing the same difficulties you would face pre-cyno-change. An interceptor being able to warp @ 100 just results in the same problem for in-coming capitals.
---
Ill pretend Ill belive that.
---
If you're too busy IRL to format your post for readability then you can expect people will be too busy IRL to actually read your way of text
---
Oh waffles here again. I guess Ill just let myself be dazzled with logic again. Please continue.
---
Then you dont need to train tons of cyno alts
---
Hardcore eve player with nearly 2 years long career. Injectors were a mistake.
---
Just make it a sub-capital only module... done. The whole idea is to keep ratting carriers/dreads/supers and rorqs from having a bullshit dbag lifeline for an insta-save. 
---
Nobody's gonna risk a capital by jumping to a cyno to save a ratting Domi or Ishtar.
---

---
CCP after a year: Eve echoes...
---
for me, no, for others - yes
---
“It’s like eating Chicago-style pizza: what’s the point?”
---
Some of us like our pepperoni covered lasagna bread, thank you very much.
---
Actually if It wasnt for the injectors I would stop playing the game a long time ago, because fuck waiting a year to be able to enjoy the game.
---
No shit sherlock. But outside of a larger fleet its harder isnt it? The random asshole will have it harder to kill you, no?
---
I mean come on, full bomber/stuka fleet kills most things.
---
you know why the big wars happened? cause space had value, now the inhabitants in that space have a higher value than the space itself. 
---
You need the inhabitants to utilize this space, moongoo is now active not passive. Nearly all ships you fly are produced from the nullsec organization when you cut their supply or they cut it you pay much higher isk for the same ship you get now for cheap. 
---
All ressources where actually spread out evenly with the moonchanges and since nearly all wars on this planet where for ressources directly or indirectly you dont have a clue why people go to war. 
---
Land itself is useless unless you utilize it for your profit, same goes for space. What did Test and Goons check? What did gobbins learned from them and PL Nc. neglected the changes to- and the reason for holding space. And now Pandemic Horde is a Major Power i would say they are alone stronger than PL and NC. combined in Manpower and maybe already in Super/Titans/Dreads fielded. Wintercoalition knew the drills from serenity server so they have also a umbrella. 
---
Nullsec don't cry cause of danger, nullsec hates assymetric changes all over over again, while player's leave the game from Hisec to nullsec cause this game is driven by the community's. The Big Blocks can weather the changes it will cut their profit, they have to adjust maybe doctrines or SRP but in the end you won't get more kills than before it will always stay the same with or without local.
---
But the people you lost the small alliances which couldnt utilize their space anyway fully cause of the fear the big ones eat their caps/supers relied on ratting/minor industry. So now those alliances face the angry f1 monkey from the big blocks who send their Fc's in their space to train them and from hunters who seek easy prey. You ever went through the space of those small alliances? you can consider it dead.
---
Pretty funny too
---
&gt;You could say the "chaos era" **forces** people 
---
keyword **Forces**
---
I was saying i don't care about highsec.
---
I assumed you lived in highsec based on your bad posting about reeeee code killed me and is killing new players.
---
It's weird you get boners from text on the internet.
---
Yes I know I'm good at this.
---
It's the german word for air force (or air weapons), and still used for the german airforce if I'm not mistaken. Yikes indeed
---
A horrible idea. What they need to do is add entosis to killing citadels and it would be a lot more engaging
---
ignorance is bliss isn't it
---
how is it any different than now? you still have to light a cyno either way... and if you are distracted or there is no counter drop ready then it plays out the same way.
---
protip maybe stop ratting in suppers. go down to carriers and use the supers for sov stuff
---
Not everyone can get their logistics done by just rolling a highsec hole.
---
For people living outside US/old EU? For cost of subbing two accounts for 30 days, I could start drinking on Friday and sober up maybe around Tuesday. Yet I still consider EVE over last 2-3 years money well spent.
---
I think that's literally his point
---
and?
---
moreso pointing out your failure to understand natural exponential growth over time
---
No civilian should have that kind of firepower
---
Would definitely make cyno vigils spicier
---
not exactly different to open wallet &gt; buy plex &gt; sell plex &gt; head to character bazzaar.
---
lets discount plex, offer mct insentives for subs THEN change the whole fucking game! big boss will love the money we got and we can try to unfuck the whole skilljaculation problem by shitting on all the hard work these dumb fucks did developing all those systems! A combination of arbitrary mechanic changes, shady marketing and straight up chaos should fix everything.
---
&gt; I think a lot of people are going to scoff at it because using disposable cynos essentially allowed you to use caps for cheap logistics
---
This.  I own a ratting carrier that's never actually shot a rat, but it's sure suitcased a lot of shit.
---
I can live with most of these changes, but my one real gripe is the lack of a disposable cyno option for jump freighters - I think this change is going to significantly increase freight costs in the short-medium term as all the logistics groups have to start skilling all their alts to cyno V.
---
Personally, I think I'd like to have seen cynos remain fittable on everything, with the restriction that you must be tethered unless you're in a recon/blops/covert. This keeps the PVP changes intact while not fucking the logistics end.
---
Nope, just understanding the basocs of what words mean.
---
The argument for NDA breach is literally "he said words that don't really tell us any fact that sound professional...therefore NDA breach"...
---
Seriously? That's a worse argument than those that say the Earth is flat.
---
Couldn't agree more. The blackout and cyno restrictions are both excellent ideas, but poorly executed.
---
&gt;Also, where are you getting the idea that this will even translate into more cash in CCPs pocket?
---
sp aren't free.
---
a super will tank for a few minutes with no support
---
a recon will tank for about 3 seconds
---
if you're not sure how these are different you're beyond help
---
what if they added a damage cap to all ships.. 150 dps cap on frigates!! PORGchamp!
---
I was only pointing out that you were far from just sharing your opinion as respectfully as possible. You stopped in this thread to put someone down. Plain and simple.
---
Yeah that's what CCP are trying to stop, the need to have supers and titans to enjoy the game
---
low sec is great,  fix the bot problem with stabbed .. mining frigates(forgot their name) and its a great place to be, ppl fly shiny stuff alk the time in low sec and killing those guys makes my wallet happy, which makes me happy, which makes my ceo happy . k maybe not cause pred is always hangry but you get the point! 
---
low sec is great already, the smalll gang and solo thrives here.
---
just fix the FW plexes and let t3destroyers back into smalls because assault frigates are broken as fuck.
---
newplayerbtw 30~ days
---
&gt; VNI piloting was critical for me moving up on the income scale. Exploration is good for early isk and pocket change, but not a viable way to pay for the subscriptions of alt accounts or injectors 
---
Basically, since you can't play for free anymore there's a problem? CCP doesn't earn money off of you directly either way, someone else will buy that plex if you wont.
---
yeah but it's like "i was happier as a kid when i didn't have a job - i better just quit my job"
---
well as a kid you didn't have bills, now you do.
---
just because it worked when you were 12, doesn't mean it'll work when you're 22.
---
Moneymaking in lowsec is far better than moneymaking in nullsec. Just don't expect to make your money in anoms
---
I was really confused by your reply at first, and then I realized you're dumb and don't understand what's going on ITC. Carry on. :)

Do you have any more talking points you'd like to repeat orn dd you have something to add to the discussion?

Sure. While people inside your echo chambers openly admitted to buying votes and your side has more alts than me, suddenly it is much harder to believe ideas outside your echo chambers can be popular.

Dude your missing the point. Yes maybe whs are again more isk dense than NS but BOUNTIES are the single largest isk faucet on the game anything else pales in n comparison. Whs per character generate more income over a SHORT period of time but in the long haul the ability to undock and have infinitly reswawning sites beats every other isk faucet simple as that.
---
Now we could argue if incursions or whs generate more but again the single largest isk faucet in the whole game is ns's anomalies.
---
Until the mer is broken down past "commodities" and "bounties" we can't know the exact numbers so arguing about it further is pointless.
---
Making one rorq  per like 1000km isn't aggressive? Cuz that's what we need is one per belt not single best/most used mining ship in the game.
---
Removing local is an interesting experiment. I think they will reenable it either with changes to how up-to-date it can be. Like a delayed normal mode. Or move it to observatories that will "eventually come out"
---
Its okey. I "trust" you.
---
Youre implication was that the attackers would have time because it would take near perfect play, I replied that near perfect play is extremely easy because tidi gives you extra time to consider your next move.
---
New elite pvp to stop hostile empires from growing. Locust strip their systems. PvP while pveing.
---
That depends entirely on how long the use-and-restore cycle is and how exactly it is balanced. If overfarming can be done in - say - 4 hours of using everything there's in system at near-max capacity, but restore takes around a week, I can't imagine any multi-timezone group to be able to continue moving through space in order to cycle resources. The system could be tweaked in a way that requires you to both spread and actively police your own members to not overfarm (especially if it's treshold based system with fast depletion and low regeneration), but with how hard CCP is pushing over last few years towards people actually spending time in space undocked, I don't see that happening, ever.
---
that is a terrible analogy, being a wage slave has diminished your mental capacity
---
You could slowtrain a titan within 2 years
---
Awesome little ship, it's slow because you can't have it all going in your favour, but it's very versatile and you can try a lot of different fits that work really well.
---
Ingredients:
---
Fertilizer 3 cups
---
Protein Delicacies 1 teaspoon
---
Spiced wine 1 cup
---
Preparation:
---
Mix, then serve to CCP.
---
It would be a great chaos suggestion for sure
---
Please no, battleships are so slow and horrible to fly
---
&gt;i WaNt My 'EnD gAmE cOnTeNt' On DaY oNe
---
Venture.
---
The mining frigate with the warp core bonus is called the Venture.
---
It's going to take a lot more than this to bring back battleships.
---
The cyno will still die, because of the ECM changes that turned ECM into more of a 'taunt' ability.
---
No im not. Because money gets spread out more in NS making it less harmful and supporting tons more people. But heres the thing I dont understand, people keep talking about faucets, I dont get the issue with it. Why is it a big deal if people make isk?
---
Yet again, doesnt matter much since its spread out. 
---
If you ask me this should have been done right away. The rorq should have been an ongrid booster, nothing else. Pre blackout tho. Right now subs are dying like flies.
---
Its an experiment that has made one group lose trillions of their personal isk and made tons of people quit. If it had been released with some form of delay it would have maybe worked but this version has pissed of so many people. And that wasnt needed. That experiment instead went punitive.
---
&gt; Your only response is Supers/Carriers. Which are just gonna get fighters absolutely murdered out that far.
---
​Cuz there are no other ships in the game besides capitals amirite?
---
It's the name still used today... that's the name of the German Airforce ... You suck at history :))
---
I love battleships, but maybe I'm weird. Honestly imo battleships are a good answer to this problem. Recon doesn't have to be on grid to bring in the ships, they can just have the battleships warp down from wherever. A lot of battleships are quite mobile now days, especially ships like mach's and phoons. Who DOESNT wanna scoot around at 1300 m/s shitting DPS out on to nerds in a huge shiny battleship?
---
Start a new account and then imagine being a new player and seeing 30+ day queues to fly the ships you've been seeing on youtube. That's the issue lol, it's not just about people injecting into caps
---
depends on what kind of gank really... Like is it a crap load of bombers or are they dropping capitals too?
---
will be interesting if they take some people advise and allow Marauders to have cyno's but then again... I want less super caps not more... heck if all the supers/titans in game all died the game would be better for it.
---
So to hell with us new guys, we only care about bringing back the old players who pay to fly and want to stroke it to a killboard?
---
potato tomato...
---
Also is getting fixed. Venture wont be able to enter plexs
---
&gt;I started playing this game 1 year and 11 months ago
---
&gt;I have caps/titans/supers
---
Literally cancer.
---
&gt;Blackout has killed every ratting activity outside of super umbrellas, subcap ratting is dead even with cynos equipped, you just cannot save a subcap in time in 90% of the cases.
---
Good. Now they have to kill ratting *inside* the supercap umbrellas (hello cyno changes).
---
&gt;From a newer player perspective, you cannot subcap ratting without dying to cloaky hunters, so your only way to make isk is abyssals or protected mining fleets, that’s a really hostile environment if you want to have new players coming to this game.
---
You think new players should be flying Titans within 2 years of playing the game, and going straight out to NullSec and getting into an solo AFK ISK printers in order to buy injectors for their supers.
---
People like you are *literally* a cancer on EVE that is destroying the economy. You're worse than bots, because at least there's only a very small number of bots. Please uninstall. I don't know what game you're playing but it's not EVE Online. You're playing some weird Blizzard game with a level 110 Titan boost for $300.
---
&gt;Bait ships with cynos, the fishing of EVE, just look at Vonhole, this will require another account and get exponentially very expensive.
---
Shouldn't be a problem for some fuckboi using mom's credit card to PLEX 9 supercapital pilots.
---
I for one am tired of hearing people who bought their way "to the top" whining about any change that might mildly inconvenience them. This is EVE ONLINE. Harden the **FUCK** up kid, or GTFO and spread your cancer to some other game.
---
Chameleon are all dead i think
---
I know but it's still could be a nice step in that direction with a few more changes.
---
salt salt salt
---
The main problem with this and many of the recent changes, is that at the surface, these changes certainly make things "more difficult" for the null blocs. However, these are also the same people who have the most resources and organisation to overcome these difficulties.
---
Smaller entities or people trying to strike out on their own? Not so much.
---
The problems that these will cause to JF networks is a good ilustration for this. The major blocs will have little issue either SRPing logistics cynos or having enough people with the appropriately skilled alts to restore their networks. Sure, it will cost, and it will be annoying in the interim, but we have the manpower and the resources.
---
The new alliance or corp trying to take space or strike out on their own?
---
I do policy-making for a living, and one thing we do not do when there are massive, powerful incumbents in a market is to make the barriers to entry even higher. It literally cements the status quo. Even if we are reluctant to tear down the incumbents for whatever reason, we can LOWER the barriers, FACILITATE new entries and ENCOURAGE competition.
---
Can we perhaps look at the EVE equivalents of these instead?
---
That deffo requires risk
---
At least you could have tryed to present a different argument if you were going to make a new post on the subject, otherwise why bother repeating the exact same arguments used in the other dozen of so threads posted just today?
---
If you want to see different opinions on the matter or arguments both for and against those changes just go read those other threads.
---
boring
---
conversely
---
&gt;i don't want to spend months grinding through shitty tedious content that's boring as fuck just to get to the bits worth playing
---
Crying? No, not really. I am saddened to see EVE jump off a cliff so quickly b/c of a few hundred mouth breathers being loud on reddit. 
---
You guys are completely ignoring all the casual dudes
---
And that's where I stopped as well.
---
Fair point - but we're still talking a massively tanky ship with a huge drone bay.
---
Haven't played in a while. Is vni ratting not a thing anymore?
---
dominix, myrm.
---
same shit, slightly different ship model.
---
Its more like "I want my any kind of fun content day one"
---
&gt; If I want to move a capital
---
thz for clarifying!
---
I've been really enjoying the Retribution lately and would highly recommend. It's your classic kitey bullshit but it's fun to fly and can take on most frigates or destroyers and some cruisers or battleships. 
---
It's relatively evenly matched against Garmur/Dramiel/Daredevil (assuming those pilots know what they're doing), but avoid fighting against ram Jaguars or Triglavian ships. The ram Jag is faster (and tankier and deals more DPS) so once they get a web/scram on you you're dead, and Trig ships can track you and will really fuck up your day once they ramp up.
---
Fits are pretty standard, there's just a stylistic debate about whether you want an ADC or extra heat sink/nano, or ancillary reps vs. standard. Some really good pilots eschew the armor repper to add extra speed or damage mods, but I wouldn't suggest that until you've spent a fair amount of time flying them.
---
But at this moment, no cash flow in CCPs direction is required for someone to get the SP to fly a recon.
---
But also, nice job skipping all the questions.
---
Maybe elect some people to CSM if you want to make your playstyle heard :)))))
---
myrmidon are pretty good replacement for the vni cheaper and about the same dps and tank
---
Thanks for the correction. I didn't wanna write 1 minute without confirming it first. The websites I checked told me it's 2 minutes. Guess they are outdated.
---
deep fried bee larvae
---
im a fan of using 1 overdrive to make up for its low speed.
---
Cynos can only be lit when the grid masslevel is below a certain threshold.
---
Yeah they changed the vni so it's a less viable ratting ship (I think it's less drone bandwidth but I'm not 100%)
---
I just ended up uninstalling. I hate that I don't know enough to help bring a tool that is as nice and helpful as NeocomII to android. 
---
Hopefully someday.
---
Don't give them any chaotic ideas
---
It’s a tomato soup bread bowl with cheese on the bottom.
---
Jamyl Sarum one-shotted an entire Minmatar fleet, including a Ragnarok, with an EVE Gate-era Terran weapon. Allowed to progress further? Yeaaah, you'll have frigs blowing up planets without breaking a sweat.
---
Character bazaar was a mistake as well, why repeat it?
---
lowsec seems to be thriving still so you can always try the area surrounding, and in, amamake. just take t1 frigs and dessies and keep fighting the gud fight
---
for nullsec, its better to fly cloaky stuff, to fit in with the blackout.
---
There's a coupon code RIGHT ON THE PAGE.
---
Dont
---
pogcamp
---
Fair enough
---
Why should nullsec, often described as the endgame of eve, be a welcoming place for new players. 
---
Your experience of the game isn't what defines a good entry but nor is it necessarily a bad thing. 
---
When your discussing what's good for the game try and detach yourself from your own experiences and point of view and you might get closer to a balanced argument.
---
praytell, where do you get your free sp from?
---
Yeah i'm pretty sure that killing every kind of ratting will be great to keep people playing this game, specially newer players that will just make isk from the nothingness.
---
If you thing this cyno change is going to affect supercap umbrellas you don't have any idea at all.
---
Sir you just upped the bittervet meaning to new levels, I may be a cancer to you but I'm just another player creating/being the content of someone else :)
---
because this repetition makes them so much money it's sad that they're going to waste it on another shitty game that'll be dead on arrival.
---
Do you know how much you usually make per hour?
---
Only thing I see happening is recon and blops ships becoming the price of fucking supers. 
---
Blops for sale 14,999,999,999
---
What is gif source please it looks entertaining
---
I mean if you want to rat, domi, neuts, mjd, grappler, point, etc...
---
Sweet post
---
Corvette carrier that launches velator squadrons
---
Calm down mate. Way I look at it, OP himself/herself shows how bad CCP is. 
---
Less than 2 years of playing EVE you already achieve endgame ships.  It used to be more like “I wish one day I can fly a titan before EVE dies.”   
---
Injectors are the root cause of current problems with Eve among other stuff.  And injectors hastened the progress of the badness x 100. 
---
Even before injectors CCP was bad and slow at fixing the problems. Now with injectors nowadays, CCP just can’t keep up.
---
I like the changes, I almost feel as if newbros have the most potential with these changes because there was little to no room for innovation, growth or fresh ideas.
---
When I first joined the game at the start of the year, I was confused by the notion that nullsec is actually safer than high sec. Like wtf, how..?!
---
The skeptics and naysayers shoot down any new ideas, then not surprisingly but hypocritically suggest you join them or some mega Corp and be a line member. 
---
You join a mega Corp, you're guilty of being a spy until proven innocent. Intel was watching local and looking up bios. Looking for a good time, let's all 20 of us camp these gates and compete for a kill mail on the unfortunate solo venture or exploration frigate that passes through. 
---
Small groups and alliances die off due to lack of purpose  and innovation. 
---
As a new bro, the alternative means being limited to high sec care bear activities and even then players and coalitions accuse you of being a spy alt.
---
Lowsec is just.... 
---
The safest or most sane place I've found in all this noise was wh space. At least it's clear what you're getting into there. 
---
 I for one am glad that some things are being shaken up. 
---
Just my 15 cents, going back to hacking shit and people watching in wormholes.
---
yea well dogs rarely ever know when they need a bath either
---
Why do I get downvoted every time I ask about a ship?
---
Though in most other games you don't have to wait (train for) even for months to fly some particular ship. Still, expecting SP reimbursements is silly especially in a case like that. Blackout should've been in the game from the start, but since it wasn't now so many are crying about it.
---
&gt; Literally cancer.
---
Let's go back to people getting scammed on the bazaar or using RMT to trade accounts. That was so much better. And the reports of 
---
&gt; Good. Now they have to kill ratting inside the supercap umbrellas (hello cyno changes).
---
Ah yes we want more big corps and people grouped up so we have more empty space to fly through
---
And honestly not even going to bother replying to the rest. If you want to have a normal discussion how about you reply to them in a way that doesn't make you look like a fucking 11 year old. 
---
I hope you realize just how pathetic it makes you look when you start sperging this kinda stuff `some fuckboi using mom's credit card to PLEX 9 supercapital pilots.`
---
Removing asset recovery from nullsec. It’s coming bois.
---
Let the downvotes commence.
---
IT WAS ALL DYATLOVs FAULT
---
The end result is the same but the pace is completely different. Characters on the bazzaar had to train those skils so there was still a waiting period of sorts. Skill injectors are basically crowd funded. I could make a skill farm of x amount of characters then after a single month I would have x amount of skill injectors to consolidate into a single character. The pace and scability is what makes skill injectors bad, not the end result.
---
On second thought the eve gate can stay closed.
---
Mitani willing, we will prevail in peace and freedom from fear and in true health through the purity and essence of our natural fluids.
---
There's plenty of content to enjoy along the way to T2 ships, capitals, supers, Rorquals.
---
You can have just as much fun in a 10m ISK ship, as you can have in a 200m ISK ship, as you can have in a 1bn ISK ship, as you can have in a 10bn ISK ship.
---
I mean ... this guy is PLEXing 9 accounts.  How much grinding through shitty tedious content is he doing to keep that up?
---
That really WOULD kill the game though. You'd need a fleet to do basically anything trading/industry-wise. Certainly all "carebears" would quit and then the game would be financially unsustainable.
---
just submit a plate of spaghetti and ketchup
---
Because people will use RMT to get their accounts otherwise. It's similar to the IRL argument of legalizing drugs with the difference being that this is a game and it increases player retention
---
Injectors aren't a problem concerning ship balances and game mechanics. All they did was allow imbalances and problems to be exposed on a larger scale in a shorter time. CCP was unprepared.
---
No, injectors are a problem for other reasons, the type of player OP is being the perfect example. EVE used to weed those kids out, now they just need mommy's credit card and they're free to have their fun to the detriment of the health of the game.
---
I have not yet complained about manpower. I have only said that caps are way too easy to move, way too available. They ruin those David vs Goliath fights. There are no response fleets because caps ARE the response fleet.
---
&gt; You can
---
or you can find that stuff completely boring and uninteresting.
---
i personally only fly subcaps, doesn't mean the OP gets the same enjoyment though.
---
My submission will be a picture and the recipe will be:
---
&gt; Our logs show nothing
---
... Nothing about this change is changing which ships you can fly.  Unless you mean ships that had a cyno fit to them can't undock but then you're wrong, they've changed slot layouts on almost all ships resulting in legacy fits that have mods in non-existent slots.
---
I have a T3C with 5 subs, machariels with extra low slots, etc.  So no, you're just flat out wrong.
---
Take my upvote for the effort. 
---
Although I understand your frustration I still believe the worst culprit of the problems we have now is injectors.  It’s ironic how OP is pointing out problems with EVE and its bad changes while OP himself/herself shouldn’t even exist if it wasn’t for the injectors.
---
you're talking pace in a 16 year old game. at this point there's going to be enough characters with a wide enough array of skills that the difference would be minimal.
---
You're a salty one aren't ya?
---
This whole idea of 'fixing lowsec' is pointless. Lowsec must first be defined as to it's purpose... is it just a way to one-up in pvp by letting the idiot fire first and acquire the gate-guns? Because, that and standing-loss seems to be the only purpose other than the use of bombs.
---
Instead of gate-guns enforcing 'security', make lowsec the place where PLAYERS enforce the law. Lowsec is clearly the harbor for pirates. This is a content gap that is waiting to be filled. Like FW, players can join CONCORD and become the law-enforcers... it's cops &amp; robbers. 
---
Give those who join CONCORD unique items in the LP store, or just the same that are already there. Unique benchmarks with rewards ranging from ISK to SP to faction items.
---
Naaaah.. CCP will just keep pouring chemicals on top of chemicals on FW until they just make it all Nullsec. Making Eve 90% WH space.

it's not about flying ships, it's about functionality.

ccp have never removed functionality when rebalancing in the past.
---
&gt;Let's go back to people getting scammed on the bazaar
---
Scamming was never allowed on the Bazaar and carried stiff penalties, and guess what? The Bazaar is still as active as ever.
---
Don't care about the rest of the whiny tone policing.
---
Oh of course, Not saying its not retarded deaths, Just explaining that there is a little more to it than first glance
---
jesus christ, this shouldn't be this hard. If you can't press jump within ~3 seconds the problem isn't the cyno, so even if there is perfect play the tick limitations are enough to bring people in
---
&gt;If the recon pilot has a brain, he'll save a ping on warp-in, slowboat out of the bubble
---
and die before he gets out of that bubble.
---
your analogy is garbage, much like your diet and choice in sexual partners (exclusively yourself)
---
&gt;Yeah i'm pretty sure that killing every kind of ratting will be great to keep people playing this game, specially newer players that will just make isk from the nothingness.
---
"*lOoK aT mE i LeArNeD sArCaSm ToDaY*"
---
Instead of AFK ratting in your super, did you know that you can... harvest resources... do invention... and....
---
....build things that you can sell to other players for ISK?
---
The game is a lot more rewarding when you put effort and time into building up to things. But I guess you just want to play Call of Duty: Titans Online.
---
it's never a bad idea, exactly.
---
the reason we don't suggest it for new players is because you simply don't have the ability to make a sufficient amount of in game money with such a limited potential to make said money.
---
it'll lead to you just burning out and quitting.
---
Lmao. Wtf is this argument? You think EVE would be healthy if people sign up, see that it would be physically impossible to catch up with people who have been playing for more than a decade, and log off? 
---
This is the literal definition of a bitter vet whining that the younger players are catching up to and passing him.
---
you shouldn't say such horrible things about your mother.

Still better than caps

One of the few people on my old mining corp who knew the difference between “your” and “you’re” turned out to be Swiss. 🙃
---
I am glad you are enjoying the game, but most of us bitter vets are only playing because of the fallacy of sunk costs. Given that, probably the best idea would be to stop playing the *very moment* you start thinking to yourself, "this just is not as much fun anymore."
---
&gt;physically impossible to catch up with people who have been playing for more than a decade, and log off?
---
This argument has been addressed and debunked so many times in the past decade that I'm not even going to bother. Google "ShahFluffers skill training". Pz.
---
as you can see in my post, i already defined that it was you in order to avoid confusing your small garbage fed brain.
---
your welcome :)
---
Many new players are already enjoying this change.
---
The ones who aren't, we're misled in to thinking eve is safe for people to rat or mine in. It's not and it wasn't ever supposed to be safe in null.
---
If you want safety, go to high sec.
---
If you want to have fun and she'd your risk aversion, then go PvP in null. It's a TON of fun. In fact, I'm sure the returning players will teach you how to kill capitals in null.
---
Caps are a bit more fun to fly than battleships IMO

Why kinm off ratting completely? Because you’re crying, let’s relove one way of making ISK.
---
If you decide to start multiboxing early there’s a good posibility you’re in a titan if you really want to achieve that smh. Is that still wrong? Or do you happen to know what CCP planned back then??
---
I personally think the extract/inject mechanic should've instead been limited to retraining your own character (so, moving SP from Minmatar to Gallente ships, for example), not for transferring to other chars.
---
The reason that people say to not try and get a sub with isk when you are starting out is because you should be trying to have fun playing, not trying to just get isk. Often people burn out very quickly if they chase isk. 
---
So find something that you enjoy doing, and then you will eventually find a way to make isk doing it, then you can sub with isk. It’s not a bad thing to sub with isk, just don’t let it be your reason for playing the game.

One major indication we could use is PLEX prices... since CCP seems to have stopped pumping sales with 15% off sales ever other mo... oh, hey started doing that again... Shit.   
---
It's entirely possible it's just to capitalize on returning players, who are in no way excited about PvE in Eve and who were conditioned to expect large discounts.

Oh I can buy the SP needed to get it done but the main point is that I have to pay to get back to where I was before.
---
Ah yes. Because that's clearly what a day one new player is going to do. Google "ShahFluffers skill training". Maybe CCP should put that in the tutorial.
---
CCP wants to force people into buying skill injectors again.

&gt; Yeah i'm pretty sure that killing every kind of ratting will be great to keep people playing this game, specially newer players that will just make isk from the nothingness.
---
There are plenty of ways for new plauers to make isk or get involved. Unfortunately, people like you scream so loud that null ratting is the only way that most dont bother exploring what eve has to offer. Perhaps you should start playing the game instead of being so narrow minded.
---
https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg
---
i dont understand why you are getting so pissed at people spending money in this game. let people have fun, its a game. you, on the other hand are one of the reasons people leave this game, because its community is incredibly toxic.
---
You skipped years of progression. News flash - the frigate grind to cruisers is designed to be fun. You've basically blasted cheat codes to the end of the game and are now complaining the mid point has been changed
---
Did you read the post?
---
Because I don't think you read the end of it.
---
&gt;Now, I have no issue with making Nullsec more dangerous. It has some of the best potential moneymaking in the game for an individual person in the shape of high-value moons, consistently respawning anomalies, and high-level DED sites. However, Sov null space no longer offers the opportunities that were once available to a low-SP, newer player that wants to be able to generate enough ISK to start catching up to the established playerbase and truly dive into EVE as a game.
---
&gt;Lowsec needs to be that space. I dislike lowsec- I avoid it because I don't like it, and at my stage in the game, I don't need to go there. But there are lots of people out there who both like it, and care a whole lot about it. A healthy lowsec is how you get new people into the game, and into PvP. If the moneymaking in highsec is better than the moneymaking available in lowsec, then people are going to stay in highsec, get bored, and quit the game because they're missing the best damn part. Dangle a golden carrot in front of people's noses and they'll follow it. Eve is unlike other MMOs insofar as there's no level-gated content, but that doesn't mean that CCP can't provide a balanced range of content that provides something that vaguely resembles a progression for people who want to follow it. People can choose the level of risk (aka intensity) with which they want to play, and the ISK / rewards they receive will reflect that.
---
I'm fine with Nullsec not being the starting place for new PvPers. But lowsec needs some serious improvements so that it can be that place.
---
When you argue injectors aren't P2W, you do realize that by that definition there aren't really any P2W games? It's all really "pay for advantage", no game I know of will give you 100% instant autowin if you pay some money.
---
It's not that English has a lot of exceptions. The problem is that it doesn't have any fucking rule, you have to learn as you go. Other languages are hard because the rules are complex and layer on top of each other, but english you can only learn trough practice.

From a resource perspective one creates additional titan pilots, and one just transfers existing titan pilots around

Tbh, BB have public fleets, if you know they're doing a fleet you can just not rat or do it much safer. Otherwise all that's left is a fring fleet once in a while that may never come close to you.
---
shut up hilmar
---
Eve isnt a traditional MMO, there aren't raids for you to 'catch up' too. Eve is a sandbox that used to require years of growth for a player to fully mature. Injectors upend the entire life cycle of a character and completely fuck the games ecosystem.
---
&gt;Imperium, Legacy, PanFam, Winter Co., GoTG can afford it ... smaller alliances, not so much.
---
/Facepalm

It is obvious that if you're rich enough to afford a capital then your rich enough to afford a 300m ship, or have friends who can cyno you in.

&gt;What people have failed to realize is these cyno changes *benefit* large blocs because we'll just have cyno gens in every system, recons on standby in our standing fleets in our regions and we'll adapt just fine.
---
"It's killing small gang PvP!" -says yet another large alliance member :P
---
In any case, if you have to do all that to save your ratting capital ships then that's great news because it will make ratting and mining a lot more cost prohibitive to do safely... Which will decrease the over supply of isk and ore... Hence cut down on the proliferation of capital ships.
---
And there will always be fools in capital ships ratting without all that setup. I'll take those over a capital blob dropping on even solo frigates as null bears have been doing for years.
---
You just don't understand how lopsided null had become in favor of nullbears. This is there great rebalancing that will show you the real face of eve- fucking dangerous murderer bath.
---
&gt;you, on the other hand are one of the reasons people leave this game, because its community is incredibly toxic.
---
You don't fucking know me. I've raised thousands of dollars worth of PLEX during "PLEX 4 Good" and I can't even count the number of newbies I've helped get their start in EVE Online.
---
You fragile snowflakes think everyone with anything critical to say is "toxic". How do you survive real life?
---
There is a common misconception in a lot of players that joined the game after nullsec powers started recruiting anything with a heartbeat (or even without it if you consider the ammounts of bots that exist out there), and that is that there is a linear progression that CCP fucked up and that should go HS &gt; LS &gt; NS (with WH being positioned somewhere between LS and NS or after this last one, but unclear mostly), and they were blessed by the powers that be and allowed to easily jump to the "endgame" where they aquired all the things EVE players dream off (several accounts, dozen of characters to fly anything from a Stiletto to a Titan and a fat wallet); and that couldn't be further away from reality.
---
The thing with EVE is that, even in the sorry state it is attempting to recover from at the time, it is a massive ecosystem that allows every kind of playstyle depending on the needs and expectations of each individual player. 
---
CCP spent a lot of years breaking that balance to catter nullsec players for one reason or the other, and in my opinion that's the reason they now need to take drastic measures to somewhat bring back some kind of balance (how successful they are is still left to be seen, despite all the apocaliptic "end of time" comments you see in this sub).
---
Truth is that HS players enjoy flying their spaceships and shooting NPCs, asteroids or building stuff without any other concern, and are not there because they "are afraid" or "don't know better"; LS players are there because they enjoy the lawless and dangerous non-sov enviorment that defines the  place, and not because "they can't take sov"; and so on with any stereotype of player you can think of.
---
In conclusion, doing every change thinking about NS players and building every expansion for the last several years around them and their specific gameplay is actually what brought the game to a point of stagnation and economic inestability we currently experience.
---
Yes, Lowsec needs a lot of love from CCP, but not for the reasons you think it does.
---
I pronounce it CCP.
---
Agreed. CCP was always slow to fix stuff. But due to the nature of the game people were limited on exploiting the game mechanics/jump into meta ships and such.  It took TIME to train.  It kinda served to balance things out and bought time for CCP to fix stuff.  
---
But not anymore.  Everybody jump into meta on day 1. 
---
CCP wasn’t ready and never will.
---
&gt;We are going to keep a close eye on them and tweak or reverse them if they don't go the way we hope.
---
Would anyone actually believe them?
---
&gt;Way I look at it, OP himself/herself shows how bad CCP is. Less than 2 years of playing EVE you already achieve endgame ships.
---
Please list any other currently-operating game where it takes 2 years to reach "end-game".  Not "I've got the best purples in every slot", just *reach* the end game.
---
There isn't.  Because people look at that sort of timeline for a video game and say "fuck that".
---
Nah, english is easy to learn trough practice. Problem is that most of us are used to languages with stablished rules with few exceptions, and we approach english learning as if it was German or Spanish, and that's a recipe for failure, the inconsistencies that plague this savage tongue make it so that the only way to dominate it trough trial and error.
---
&gt;fully automatic

Sadly there is no drone based assault frigate
---
Listen, I have more isk and assets than I care to have, and idgaf about cyno changes. I'm literally telling you that this change makes big blocks stronger.
---
According to the Ship Tree, a brand-new Alpha account is around 450 days from being able to fly a Titan. And that's only the hull. So if you think people taking 2 years to have Titans is short, I don't know what to say.
---
Source: also me.
---
I like gang PvP and Corp chat, but I tend to do activities by myself otherwise.
---
My titan provides almost no enjoyment to my eve experience. Flying in fleets is what I enjoy and there are many options in doctrines. It's not all about the biggest ships I can fly.
---
Meth-Am-Fetta-Means
---
You go look at that chart again and see how many are accessible to a new player.
---
For a brief period of time, maybe. But there's a lot of elasticity in production. 
---
And they're not \_that\_ skill intensive to make.
---
&gt;There are no wspace to kspace statics that allow caps
---
Congratulations on being wrong, here's your prize 🏆
---
Boson
---
&gt; Blackout has killed every ratting activity outside of super umbrellas, subcap ratting is dead even with cynos equipped, you just cannot save a subcap in time in 90% of the cases.
---
So yeah, this expectation of risk is massively at the core of a lot of people crying about how there's now overwhelming risk ratting/mining in null. Let me put it blunt and brief, your expectations of safety levels are absurd
---
Here's how it played out in 'the good old days' a lot of us vets like to sneer at this kind of rhetoric from, i.e. around/before 2010 (skipping details like isk/hr and purchasing power then): 
---
1. I'm belt ratting in my raven/domi/HAC/whatever
---
2. A roaming gang tackles me because I'm not paying attention to local/d-scan/am slow/can't warp out in time/etc
---
3. I die. Every time. Unless I'm baiting for my own gang (usually following someone genuinely ratting and getting whacked), then maybe I hold on long enough for my dudes to log on/jump in and get to me. 
---
Safety in numbers comes from my hollering on intel that there are hostiles about, and everyone else docks up/reships/continues at their own risk (or as bait for a response). It comes from the reality that if we're all out and about ratting, I've got reasonable odds that more often than not I'll be the guy who gets told to get safe/reship, instead of the guy doing the telling. It is the safety of the herd, not the safety of the avenging furies dropping out of the sky.
---
I make my money in other ways now- Like I said, scaled up and out. I pay for my main with cash, alts with plex, which is how a ton of people do it.
---
If you read the post, you would see that I have already passed the point of needing VNIs. However, without reliable low-SP subcap options to gain isk in nullsec, given that blackout makes running subcap anomaly ratters and mining ships quite a dangerous endeavor, new players need a new or different option to reach an income level where they can catch up to the established player base. 
---
Lowsec should be that area.
---
You're right, my bad.
---
As it stands (before the nerf) moving capitals (excluding supers) through lowsec is 100% safe, as you just jump from station to station, and most nullsec alliances have friendly space in jump range of lowsec NPC stations, so yes it's super easy to do it in 100% safety.
---
&gt;lets face it probably everyone here has played or plays
---
Nope, never have, never will.
---
That'd be a very EVE burn. 
---
"Yo mom so dumb she can't fly recon"
---
Coh-kayne
---
In your own example, so they've never done it except when they did do it.  Also, the Tech1 industrial overhaul absolutely changed functionality.  I'll pretend with you that this is a new precedent though: even if the cost is negatively perceived, the expected outcome is TREMENDOUSLY better because of how it can/will impact hot drops.
---
Is eve less of a sandbox because you have to work with other people? Why play an mmo if you don't want to play with other people?
---
&gt;Once a player is established is it possible to make a large enough income to be able to buy these subscriptions with in game currency kind of on the side or is it always a bad idea to purchase these subscriptions with isk?
---
It's always a bad idea because otherwise this is a second job to you where you're constantly grinding for isk and not enjoying the game.
---
And no, you really can't set aside time for non-grinding activities in order to "balance" your experience because you will either make enough isk to buy Plex or you won't. Period.
---
And the grinding life style also makes you very risk averse because you've invested sooooo much time in making isk that you can't afford to lose your ships.
---
So you end up not wanting to PvP in appropriate ships but are always looking to penny pinch your way in to a cheap fit for Pvp.
---
Then your tears will flow when you lose an expensive ratting or mining ship.
---
You will become the bottom feeder who people mine for salt because you chose to grind your way to a subscription.
---
Just pay for it and become a PvP predator. You'll have a lot more fun and losing ships will actually be a laugh.
---
Yeah I neglected that item on my way out here. If I live long enough I'll make a trek for supplies or reactivate an alt and have him bring stuff out to me.
---
I think the increase to risk in nullsec is good, and CCP hasn't yet gone far enough, but increases to risk should come with a commensurate increase to reward. For an average line member running anoms, the ISK/hr really isn't much better than blitzing NPC nullsec L4s. There's also the problem of sov null being almost infinitely farmable, so there's little incentive to krab anywhere except a handful of secure, convenient systems.
---
In my ideal world, null would be risky and difficult and extremely lucrative in terms of ISK/hr, but also easy to overfarm, so alliances would actually want to spread out and conquer as they grow, instead of just bluing everyone around them.
---
Kay-Oss
---
I guess if you're comparing supers to F1 machs, yeah
---
Hey man, when you're done looking through that paper towel roll can I use it? Feel like I want to see what it looks like to be that narrow minded
---
It all depends on how much you want to grind each month. If you have an way to make ~2bil each month without wanting to kill yourself, then it's fine.
---
When it becomes a bad idea is when you are basically playing the game as if it's a second job just so you can plex each month. It takes the fun out of the game.
---
That's fine, doesn't change my argument.
---
Without using mommy's credit card, how long is it going to take one of those instant-gratification gamers to get into a Titan?
---
Sure, 450 days for training the skills *to sit in the hull*. 365 days is 1 year. 450 &gt; 365 so we already have over a year just to sit in the hull. How many more days for jump skills? Tanking skills? Using the weapons and modules? Capacitor skills?
---
How is the player going to *afford* the skill books, which cost many billions of ISK?
---
Ironically most of the caps I gank are those being moved solo by dummies from this bigger group. I think we all know who's gonna feel this change the most. :)
---
Then they deserve to die. gl
---
The fact that people consider bigger ships the "end game" is a testament to why CCP is doing what they are.
---
Eve isnt designed to have an end game, it is designed to be a sandbox, not a theme park.
---
I do work with other people on a multitude of things, but the **choice** is a key thing to me, stripping away more and more as to what you can do, and forcing you to have alts unless you want someone whos one job is to sit still for 10 minutes at a time doing nothing is hardly something that strikes me as a good MMO Sandbox idea bud
---
Mainly because one of common reasons I've heard pre-2016 about why not to bother with coming back to EVE is the training model and over time power accumulation - without character bazaar you would have no chance in catching up to players who just happened to start playing the game years before you. Note that power/wealth ceiling in EVE is orders of magnitude higher than in any other MMO in terms of time needed to catch up, and without a way to grind/pay for high SP characters (be it bazaar or injectors) you'd have a lot less competetive people even trying to start. Because why bother if game makes it impossible to win?
---
Of course both bazaar and injectors have some negative sides, and - arguably - some problems of bazaar (being high inertia/high disruption way of accelerating progress) being solved by injectors actually caused other issues to emerge (injectors being so much easier to use and more granular made SP farms and SP buying very common thing).
---
Yes solo pvp is still super active. Idk much other than Low-sec but I still find stuff to fight daily around Minmatar-Amarr warzone. I would suggest staying in cruiser and down since you are more agile/fast and thus can avoid more blob/huge group like this. Personnaly I really like frigs and  dessy fight. Send me a PM if you want more information or need help for whatever. o7
---
Won't need luck, it's gonna be cap gank Christmas.
---
Lol have fun. XD This game has too many caps/supers and titans anyway.
---
&gt;But due to the nature of the game people were limited on exploiting the game mechanics/jump into meta ships and such. It took TIME to train.
---
Exactly. Things moved at a slower pace. Problems emerged more slowly - and were debated whether or not they were actually problems (for months and years) - and when it became clear it was a problem, CCP would clumsily start trying to fix it.
---
Now it's like. They introduce a new ship type (Triglavian) and everyone just buys injectors and are building and flying them in a few days. What the actual fuck happened to setting goals and working for things?
---
Everything in the game is becoming fucking meaningless and you got these whiner CoD kids running around acting so entitled like this is the way it's supposed to be, and threatening to quit if CCP takes their toys away.
---
Pathetic.
---
Hopefully this era of "Chaos" shakes things up and gets CCP working on real changes.
---
KA OS
---
That isn't new though. That is what the game was designed around and anyone who has played pre-injector is aware of this and was fine with it (or atleast played regardless of the time commitment).
---
wondering if any CCP devs wake up sweating and panicky because they where dreaming that EVE is dying
---
https://archive.org/details/DRStrangelove_20130616
---
I mean if you think it’s a scam can’t you just not buy it? Seems like a simple solution to me.
---
What is the argument for changing it? So you don’t have to read your contracts carefully?
---
“Fix lowest” a refrain I’ve only been hearing for, I don’t know, 10 years?
---
Should we tell him ? That's kinda cute, except that fucking formatting with capitals.
---
The only legit response is a subcap fleet. But forming up 30 dudes is a lot harder than getting 5 supers and 5 fax alts to drop.
---
I love it
---
You wont see the cloaky ships on dscan/local tho, until they are decloaked and tackling you, at that point as you said you need nerds to help you, which promotes even more people joining a big coalition to benefit of their standing fleet/umbrella.
---
You missed the ECM changes, didn't you?
---
I hope the newbies you helped out don't end up like you.
---
Wormholer here.
---
We make more isk than you guys and have worse intel than null... But we do it pretty regularly and easily.
---
It's easy to figure out- place cloaky campers on your gates. Now you have nearly perfect intel.
---
If you're afraid of logged off or cloaky campers, then have some of your own logged off or in cloakies.
---
Think about it- the attackers are already committing a force recon if they want to bring in capitals, right? So your alliance can do the same, or just get together with a few friends.
---
There are so many counters to this gameplay. You're just not used to them because this is all new to you.
---
And finally, you just need to accept that you will never be as safe as before again. You're living in null after all, the second most lucrative space in all of new Eden.
---
The more rewards there are, the more risk.
---
The beauty of it is that the fewer people who rat, the more those faction ships and modules are going to cost... So if ratting declines then so does the reward of taking the risk because those things will become more and more expensive.
---
It's all about the balance. And I think even you will agree that there are too many late game ships in the game at this point. A heavy nerf was therefore very very necessary.
---
None of us know how long we'll live, only that it's one less day than we had yesterday
---
I'm definitely biased on this, since I've started playing EVE around March, so I'm not well placed to imagine EVE without injectors.
---
The usual response I have when people hate on them is this: injecting into a ship doesn't mean you can fly it.
---
Imagine a newbie who makes an account, sets up his Titan skill queue, and doesn't play except to send injector after injector. Is he going to use his Titan to do anything useful? Is he going to have fun? Most likely, no to both.
---
I've started playing in March and have used injectors extensively. I'm now 4 months away from a fully fit Dread, but I chose not to inject for those capital skills. Why? Because I know if I do so, I'll whelp it like a moron.
---
I agree cap proliferation is a problem (who doesn't?) but that problem doesn't come from newbies who like instant gratification, imo. It comes from the giant null blocs who can spew out cap after cap, from already experienced players.
---
But that's just my take on it.
---
um what, vni is better than it was before.
---
Are you kidding? Half of r/eve would treat it as holy gospel and half of them would defend it like they invented it themselves.
---
Yea I'm not sure if you're involved in many of the super kills these days but I'd say 90% of all the supers tackled are sub cap fleets. No one dred bombs things these days cause it's pretty much a guaranteed trade for the super. This is absolutely not the same as what's currently going on.
---
The game existed that way for 15 years before hand.
---
Hell I would argue injectors have hurt the long term viability of the game more than it has helped attract new players.
---
HTFU
---
Hi
---
Ya but most of r/eve doesn't actually play eve or even have active accounts... I'm talking about actual people who like the game :P
---
Good god if thats PR... And that also means he lies about talking to devs to push things.
---
Both are bad
---
I love every letter you just sent to my computer screen.
---
I will concede that when I started in 2009 (and then again in 2011), the NPE was absolutely garbage and you were literally an amoeba in space.
---
I don't think injectors themselves are a problem *per se* (you could always buy a toon), the problem is that injectors have no hard cap and just use a diminishing returns model. Any kid who's mother has a high enough limit on her credit card can just brute force past the diminishing returns.
---
I think the SP should be capped, and diminishing returns as you reach the cap. A little bit of a "head start" isn't such a bad thing these days, but buying your way to a super is stupid.
---
Shattered C5? A pretty rare fish.
---
I’m just pointing out that all the people screeching cash grab......are already subbing tho accounts. And would/will/intend/probably would...be it plex or card. 
---
So from the subbed accounts. From the incoming dollars. This PROBABLY decreases CCPs net....
---
Go fuck off to WoW
---
Kiki/Draugur are the only ships smaller than a cruiser that have a realistic chance.
---
Yes, the 0.5% of eve that lives in wormholes that is screeching up a storm is very very loud.
---
What problem is solved by your suggestion?
---
It just sounds like you're upset CCP is trying to mitigate problems caused by capital proliferation.
---
&gt; if you don’t give tools to the krabs to be able to be saved
---
Since when was dropping caps the only tool to save krabs?  The only issues I've had while subcap ratting were created by my own bad decisions.  There are far bigger problems driving new players away than an inability to summon capital help.  If you assume anyone would even respond to someone they don't know lighting a cyno.
---
&gt; ### Logistics
---
&gt;
---
&gt; The cost to run logistics will be increased by a LOT, only the more wealthy people will be ready when the changes hits and newer players will just have a bigger wall to climb if they want to offer JF services, thus making the rich people just get richer and newer players just more frustrated.
---
Fair enough, but there's a high wall to offering JF services as it is, and from what I've heard established JF services are going to be hit pretty hard too.
---
&gt; ### Supers and caps deep into enemy territory
---
&gt; It's going to get very expensive in an already expensive and very time consuming ( including logistics) gameplay style, there aren't many players who do this and this will reduce them even more.
---
In other words, null blocs are going to have a harder time projecting force and the need to respond with capital ships to every invasion is lessened.
---
&gt; ### Bait ships
---
&gt; Bait ships with cynos, the fishing of EVE, just look at Vonhole, this will require another account and get exponentially very expensive.
---
Good?  I thought we all hated having caps dropped on our subcap fleet every time we try to kill a couple krabs.
---
&gt; ### Cap scalation on fights
---
&gt; A relatively low tank ship, with 0 velocity will die to any capital size guns very very fast, thus making escalation almost imposible or at the very best really tricky, this will just make groups be even more conservative on an already very risk averse player population, thus leading to more stagnation.
---
Sounds like a good reason to think before you light cynos instead of making it the go to response for every conflict.
---
I don't know if you meant to insinuate this but capital ships don't save the game from n+1 subcap blobs, they just turn it into a game of n+1 cap blobs.  If you want to talk about things that discourage newer players, how about needing to train 2 accounts for years just to begin being relevant.  I wouldn't be surprised if people become less risk averse with a better way to tell whether they'll have caps dropped on them while roaming in enemy territory.
---
The same options you had if you wanted to move an expensive battleship. Except you can also use cyno beacons.
---
I guess the question is - why should it be incredibly easy to move huge slow capital ships? At the moment you can move a capital faster and safer than you can burn an interceptor - that's ridiculous.
---
&gt;There are a lot of old movies available in the archive
---
Shhhhh...
---
&gt;Because people look at that sort of timeline for a video game and say "fuck that".
---
Really, cuz EVE had always been that way since it came out. In 2003.
---
I dont get how people dont understand that this changes things. This is absolutely not like pre changes. Before you could light cyno on your 60k rps rorq with invulnerability. Now you have to light it on your paper tank recon that will last about 3 seconds. I dont think you use carriers often. Flying your light fighters out 200km is just gonna get them webbed scrammed and killing. Pulling fighters away is the #1 thing tacklers jones over.
---
‘Ol Rise... lol
---
Well, it was.
---
Now we're demanding that part of the sandbox be roped off.
---
When I first started it was this very thing that initially attracted me to the game. The though of being able to play the game to pay for it sounded cool. A few days in I realized without any one telling me that it was not going to happen until I knew a lot more. I bought a 3 month sub then. I later bought a plex from Amazon to start my first alt account. Have not had to pay any cash since and I don't consider what I have done since then as a grind.
---
Play the game as an alpha for a while, learn all you can, find what you like to do and if that happens to make good isk then go for it. If you like to pvp all the time your best bet may b to pay for your sub with real money.
---
he cant avoid it anymore you missed the patch notes, trig now spawn outsite of invasion space. Also they camp SOA mission routes and camp system near new player systems. CCP again fucked the new player experience with this shit. Its like the old days when a world boss was in the newbie region of wow, but sadly the new player in eve lose everything he has.
---
Ram Jags are broken, just drop a super on it and go fight someone else.
---
The question I always as is how is this going to impact goons vs how’s it going to impact the little guy.
---
We have logistics organizations (plural).  Anything ccp throws at us, we can handle. If they need to drop a couple bil on midpoint alts, that’s nothing. These people have 5+ JF already. They’ve already sunk a lot into these setups, what’s a couple bil more?
---
Then what about the small organization trying to get ships in range to shoot us?  For them, that extra cyno 5 character is a big deal.
---
it does if youre accomplishing something whilst spinning!
---
Can we ban your ideas instead?
---
Haha nice.
---
How new are you talking?
---
Any c5/c6 to Low/sec

Eve online was released on year 2003. It is 16 year old game.  It has one server not counting now-closed Chinese server.  Eve is very unique in many different ways compared to other games and I doubt Eve would survive this many years if players can reach end-game under 2 years.  In fact eve was designed and played in a way you are supposed to progress very slow.  You can’t jump into meta overnight. Not everybody in your corp flys Supercarriers.  
---
Eve wasn’t designed and balanced in a way that everybody owns titan and super ratting under super umbrella. 
---
But now you can and hell broke loose. 
---
CCP wasn’t ready.  But they got greedy. 
---
Don’t get me wrong I am not saying you should not be able to reach games’  end content in 2 years.  I am only saying it isn’t Eve and it help Eve survive this many years.  Look what happened to Chinese server before it closed.  We are getting pretty close.
---
Give me a cyno that will drop NPC will drop Trylingians.

Ishtar is the same/ better but more expensive, Domi is pretty good esp if you have a cyno and standing fleet, Myrm is super cheap but only 4 heavies rather than V
---
And EVE has a giant player base, right?
---
Oh wait.....
---
Well, at least there isn't a new player retention problem.
---
With no money?
---
cha·os
---
/ˈkāˌäs/
---
okay
---
Or more because those who were not just closed the game....
---
I think you're ignoring something important. Null is incredibly safe unless someone is hyper retarded or the enemy is willing to throw away billions and billions of isk. 
---
Nobody deserves completely safe ratting and dozens of capitals to back you up in an instant. 
---
Making things more dangerous for null by necessity has to make it easier for the hunters. 
---
Also can you show me the lossmail that has you so worked up?
---
I'm gonna have to get on a new character and check that out, that sounds wildly stupid
---
Scamming is a legitimate way to make isk in this game though. Are you going to bitch about pirating and ganking? They’re the same concept of capitalizing on other people’s stupidity. Scamming is probably the easiest to counter though because everything is right in front of your face where as pirates and gankers can be literally any one you meet at any time and the only way to find out is to stick around long enough to see if they start attacking you. If they’re good, by that time, it’s already too late for you.
---
to be fair I recently got back into the game stopped playing in 2014... so the meta has changed lots since then...
---
but I still hold the sentiment that all supers must die...
---
did you watch the video. cussed me out, made excuses, and didn’t pay the 200 mil
---
&gt; Don't lose that love, eve is an amazing game &amp; there is nothing else like it.
---
I don’t intend to, and thanks for the advice!
---
&gt; Hell I would argue injectors have hurt the long term viability of the game more than it has helped attract new players.
---
New player retention has always been horrible.  And it's getting worse.  One of the main factors is the massive time required to get to the point where you feel like you're really able to play against the established players.
---
Injectors became necessary when the existing players got so far ahead of the new players.
---
I knOw HoW TO tYpE LIkE ThiS
---
You know many other MMO's that have been around for 15+ years?
---
*Oh wait.....*
---
It's not even supers/titans, just regular being able to participate in corp/alliance ops as actual member and not in newbie snowflake ship takes about 35-70mil SP (depending on group and doctrine set) without even considering capitals. Remember that before injectors there used to be separate new player friendly alliances and "endgame" alliances that wouldn't even look at you if you didn't have enough SP to fly everything they fly regardless of how great at the game you were otherwise (but then, why didn't you use character bazaar?) - only because your inability to fly their doctrines (that used high SP for better performance-per-pilot) would make you unable to participate in a lot of what's going on. Just look at traditional blopsing (actually using blops battleships, not bomber blob) - if you don't have neither blops skills with JDC5 nor cyno 5 (which alone is almost 30 days train) while everyone else has those, you are becoming a hindrance to the fleet.

In practice, it's not ships that dictate how you enjoy the game, but ability to be included and be able to participate together with people you play with. Ships and SP are just a tools that enable you to do so - and the more demanding tasks your group take on themselves, the more important this becomes. And trying to avoid it brings the risk of ghettoing new players into new player focused groups while "the adults" do their thing and farm those new players - this has already happened multiple times in different ways (from academy corps/alliances, to farming newbie groups 24/7) and I don't think anyone wants it to be a thing again.
---
Yes but the time to train a cyno to that account isn't enough time to catch up to Sept, or just barely depending on how you want to do it. Most cyno alts are a just a frigate, if that, and cyno 4. I'm going to need to shell out for SP, and for me that's going to mean buying plex with cash. 
---
Plus, if I now want to have a separate cyno account so I can rat in my cap or whatever, have my own cyno ready to go (either for me or for "the group") and a fax or something to bring in to save me, I now need 3 accounts. So yea, if I wanted to do this (I don't) I would need an extra account.
---
You can learn the basic easy enough, but the game as a whole is hard to master. If you need help then look up EVE University, they’re dedicated to teaching noobs to find their footing.
---
Biomass yourself, delete your Reddit account, go back to wow, and never return...
---
Explore deep warm hole.
---
A capital/super FC who doesnt believe their entire fleet will get in on a cyno will not jump in the first place. I agree with the sentiment that this makes the likelihood of large cap brawls even more remote than they already were.

Technically yes globular clusters usually exist surrounding normal galaxies and are packed with stars more in a spheroid than a disc like Eve is displayed as. The gravity of the stars would not exert as heavily on the other stars if the distances are more than 1 or so light year but tidal forces may exist for the more closely packed systems.
---
great
---
The reality is that Eve doesn’t have an endgame. CCP has always struggled to define how players should progress in the game. There really isn’t any “right path” in Eve.
---
Are the vast majority of players complaining about the changes \~2 years into the game or less who bought their way into power??
---
That's what it looks like from the outside.
---
Firesale, and rebuy where you need it
---
koos
---
Agree with you.
---
Loving this change.

Those with 50 year copyright terms that were already expired when copyrights were extended, are now free to distribute.
---
"English: The bastard offspring of Norman conquerors trying to make dates with Saxon barmaids."
---
That was Poul Anderson, I think.
---
But in tidi that 3 seconds is actually 20-30 seconds in the staging system. That's plenty of time for people to press the 'jump to cyno' button.
---
I lack the skill in writing to describe the amount of sheer, absolute *disgust* I feel that the hardcore, grimdark game I've loved for almost 10 consecutive years is now a host for these sorts of players.
---
Were injectors a mistake? I don't know. I don't think they are a mistake in regards to ship balance, since they don't affect the ships, just the proliferation of the ships (which is indicative of a problem with the ships themselves, not injectors).
---
My feeling is that they would have been okay if they had a hard cap, and diminishing returns as you reached that cap. Maybe a hard cap of 5 mil (make it 6 mil for people who got buddy invited).
---
The problem with injectors is the type of garbage player they allow to *artificially* exist in EVE. But there I go being "toxic" again.
---
You've got some serious issues bud
---
I hope this ends with another highsec botting supertit massacre.
---
I agree. They're just a cancer brought on to attract ADD-afflicted little shits to the game after CCP started alienating its core playerbase...
---
oh yay gm week where ccp employees make a big show with a lot of fanfare about "hey look we play eve online" while spawning themselves items and going on a themed roam to horde space where they unceremoniously die to a bjornbee fleet and/or snuff box, meanwhile none of them actually play the game on a regular basis
---
Occult ammo? Trig BS V? Spec V? Uh what else, rapid fire?
---
The post talks about wspace to kspace **statics**
---
First of all, friends usually help each other out. If you're friends aren't telling you then you may need to join another corp.
---
Second, I use pyfa to figure these sort of things out. You too can become independent about these sort of things if you want.
---
But briefly, get a t2 disintegrator, get precursor battleship to 5, rapid firing and surgical strike to 5. The latter two are usually over looked by people. Also train large disintegrator specialization to 5.
---
There may be other skills involved as well- these were the ones off the top of my head
---
&gt;The cost to run logistics will be increased by a LOT, only the more wealthy people will be ready when the changes hits and newer players will just have a bigger wall to climb if they want to offer JF services, thus making the rich people just get richer and newer players just more frustrated."
---
JF pilots only have to make a small investment on recons+skills. After that is done, JF'in is now safer than ever, because you can jump to covert cynos that don't show on everybody's overview. This is nothing but doomsaying. 
---
&gt;### Supers and caps deep into enemy territory
---
&gt;It's going to get very expensive in an already expensive and very time consuming ( including logistics) gameplay style, there aren't many players who do this and this will reduce them even more.
---
Good. Caps were a mistake, the least CCP can do is make them expensive to operate again. The fact that everyone and their mother is flying caps now is a bigger hurdle to "the small guy" than anything else. 
---
&gt;### Bait ships
---
For someone on your position, you are overinflating the cost of recon ships and alts. "exponentially more expensive"? if you want to drop a few bill of ships on something, and you thing a T2 cruiser is too expensive, you are doing something wrong. 
---
&gt;### Cap scalation on fights
---
&gt;A relatively low tank ship, with 0 velocity will die to any capital size guns very very fast, thus making escalation almost imposible or at the very best really tricky, this will just make groups be even more conservative on an already very risk averse player population, thus leading to more stagnation.
---
Good on the first half. Dropping the most powerful ships in the game should be tricky, not just "push button, get nerds". 
---
And the second half is just as likely to happen as the opposite. People will be more willing to fight now that there's a bit of a hurdle the other side has to jump before you get dreadbombed. 
---
&gt;* Help the fog of war, remove logging game events to a text file, inherently killing NEAR2 and similar programs.
---
&gt;* Delay killmail apis by 15-30 mins and make a pass on api endpoints, removing or delaying what’s needed to avoid automatized intel ( we like our insta gratification on zkill, 2 hours is too much)
---
&gt;* Citadels are the conflict drivers of this game and its major problem, I’m not going to say how to do it as there are many solutions, but those are the problems that need to be fixed.
---
&gt;* Citadels shouldn’t need 3 timers to be killed
---
&gt;* Citadels shouldn’t be able to be spammed non stop
---
&gt;* Citadels shouldn’t be timezone tanked
---
&gt;* Killing citadels should be more rewarding, an easy solution could be removing asset safety
---
&gt;* There should be only 1 cyno jammer per system allowed
---
Funny enough, after all of this, I agree wholeheartedly with all of this suggestions, except maybe the last one. Specially the removal of asset safety.
---
That guy is probably self-destructing his lifs to get at least some insurance money back
---
I appreciate the irony in this conversation.
---
Oh my. I'm chuckling a bit. 
---
I love your points OP but be still my heart, reading them makes me smile.
---
Is it really that hard to download pyfa and rub some braincells together?
---
Well if you have 200+ titans on field, you can manage to get 200 recons who can light cynos and continue to light cynos.
---
Tbf 1 and 2 they’re trying to fix with recent changes
---
&gt;displayed
---
I'm also thinking that some of the systems are actually Binary stars systems, which is very common.   
---
Another thing I was thinking if the stars come near each other, or large enough rouge planets, they can in theory start throwing asteroids around and increase the cases of a habitual planet being struck(Think of the Nemesis theory).  or altering the orbits of planets around a start and pulling planets out of the habitual zone.
---
Are they not a useful ship currently?
---
Cuz you need to git gud
---
I'm ok with Battleships and maybe Battlecruisers getting the ability.
---
Big and tanky enough to survive briefly in a fleet engagement, but slow enough to make hunting tricky (unless you want to flex that BWN aura in a recon)

He's mad about changes that will affect where he is because his way 'to the top', and then he calls people "bittervets" because they're mad about injector RMT after they *earned* their way 'to the top.

---
Ghay-ouch
---
You all fell for this post hook, line, and sinker. I am laughing my ass off at the butt hurt you all are showing. TROLL EVE REDDIT- CHECK LMAO
---
Aye sorry
---
&gt; and I doubt Eve would survive this many years if players can reach end-game under 2 years.
---
Uh....you could always reach "end game" in under 2 years, if you define end-game as something like "fly a titan".  It just took all of those 2 years.
---
Also, Eve has always had a huge new player retention problem, and it's been getting much, much worse.  Someone starting today simply can't compete with an established player, and it's really obvious to the new players.  Sure, the new player can help in a fleet, but it's immediately obvious they're nowhere near as valuable as us vets.
---
That gets worse and worse as time goes on, and we get more and more ahead.  My subcap main can already fly every subcap with all relevant skills at least at III.  Most at IV or V.  (Well, except for the Venture, Prospect and Endurance.  Never bothered to go back and pick those up).  The only injected SP has been the various SP rewards.
---
Some new player in a frigate is gonna look at what I can fly, and is not going to think "I wanna spend the next 10 years getting to this point".  They're going to think "That's gonna take too long, I'm out of here".
---
Whether or not you think that is a good thought pattern doesn't matter.  It's what the vast majority of people think.  It's why we get a "is it too late to start playing" post every other day on r/Eve.  And the only way to deal with it is to have some sort of catch-up mechanism.  Which you will decry as the source of all of the problems.
---
&gt; Eve wasn’t designed and balanced in a way that everybody owns titan and super ratting under super umbrella. But now you can
---
Take a look at your first two sentences.  Plenty of time has passed for massive titan and super umbrellas to be trained "naturally".
---
&gt; Look what happened to Chinese server before it closed. We are getting pretty 
---
close.
---
Making changes that drive people towards the massive blocs isn't going to stop that.  It's going to accelerate it.
---
It was OP af, until CCP took away it's cap booster bonus
---
My dude &lt;3
---
It would last longer. Playing eve i drink a lot. I dont have anyone to go out with.
---
&gt; This means you have 1 minute to form a response fleet that can cyno in immediately as your recon is gonna get insta blapped.
---
People have standing fleets for this. The moment you get dropped you light and people can start jumping in with like 10-15 seconds of response time.
---
So are there 50ish titans in the fleet of 200 recons? Super/Cap FCs are constantly working the numbers and if they dont think they can get the whole hog into the mix they arent going to do it at all. Im certainly not against the cyno change but I think this will be one potentially negative consequence of it.
---
But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the FCs in Anoikis, nor the CEOs, but only the Father Bob. 
---
Apollo 24:36
---
Did you actually want a list, or are you unaware of just how many that is?
---
Man, I bet all those top tier FCs learned everything they know by pvping frigates and destroyers in FW for 2 years.
---
battle heron works.
---
I want the list.
---
I'm waiting.
---
Capital response is just faster. Right click capacitor jump is faster than titan making a bridge then waiting for subcaps to take bridge.
---
I started playing 2 months ago, bought omega for with real money for the firat month and i was already able to pay for my second month with plex. And now my second month is about to end and i will once again purchase omega with plex. Super easy to do even for a complete noob on his first month.
---
Another garbage post to downvote.
---
Man the salt caused by the cyno change is unreal :D
---
This
---
That's because you didn't google "ShahFluffers skill training" mate.
---
The money in lowsec is already better than in highsec. The problem is, without an umbrella, and with lowsec being populated by slavering pirate dogs of war (with shiny ships and pods, often), the risk is huge. Security status is supposed to be the balancing mechanism for being a bad guy in LS, but it doesn't work, because if you don't go into highsec then a -10 doesn't matter\*, and in fact many groups take pride in it.
---
And it's still true that good moons are only available in LS, right? So LS is a hugely valuable part of space on a strategic and economic level.
---
Of course there are ISK fountains in highsec which are probably too good: incursions and high tier abyssals. Making it illegal to run T4/5 abyssals in HS might encourage some more use of LS.
---
\* yes I know it affects gate guns but they're so avoidable that it's irrelevant

If it was so "necessary" why not just start every character off with 50 million unallocated SP then?

You're trying so hard but you're failing at whatever you think you're doing. It's embarrassing. High sec gankers live in your head rent free and you call others salty. Cry more.

Its the eve sub friend you get downvoted for everything
---
of course you don't understand lmao
---
I love when newbros dosnt reply salty when killed on LS, i usually send them some SRP and help them whit their fit.
---
And if im not at war, offer them to join my corp.
---
I love people that want to learn to play and have fun on EVE
---
&gt;You think new players should be flying Titans within 2 years of playing the game, and going straight out to NullSec and getting into solo AFK ISK printers in order to buy injectors for their supers?
---
No, that'd be Fozzie and Larrakin, and that diversity hire tranny who was in charge the last 5 years.
---
Wouldn't have helped much.  My characters are older than him.
---
Salvaging as a new guy income stream in nullsec is basically dead now.
---
God, they fucking butchered our license plate.
---
It’s really funny when you show something in a slavic language to a native English speaker.
---
Why not just warp in your Fax, save the Super and keep yourself alive for a bit longer and evaluate the escalation. When you have more info on the escalation warp in your Recon and light a cyno to drop the cap umbrella. Why do you need to cyno in a Fax? Could you not just warp it in?
---
Dear diary, as I poured my 3 day expired whole milk into my  oversized bowl of Cocoa Puffs  I thought to myself, “ man I sure would love to be a funny memer on Reddit for upvotes!” So I got on my overpriced Alienware and typed out complete and utter nonsense. When I was complete I stood back, brushed the Ritz cracker crumbs off my limp biscuit shirt and proclaimed that I had surely created a masterpiece.
---
This. Static, as in something you can roll to get to somewhere close to where you want to go instead of waiting for weeks/months for lucky wh spawn.
---
It can kill anything it can catch. But it's too slow to catch anything. So its natural habitat is orbiting a novice plex beacon at 500m.
---
Great response. No trolling, factual and fair. If only all of r/eve was like this. I’m sorry OP feels the way he does but I do hope they adapt and their alliance helps them carry on playing the game they want to play - albeit in a different manner. Stay aligned stay safe and be on comms

&gt;Pops up once.

CCP removes cloak and we are even.
---
I know of a group who would be happy to deliver some ammo and drones for you to defend yourselves with while you are in wormholes. I believe the corporation is called wingspan.
---
It's worth pointing out that the KBP fight wasn't quite as uneven as the zkill report you referred to suggests. It seems to count a lot of reshipping as multiple pilots on field. - In reality, we were fairly even as far as pilot count was concerned. For the brief period SF was on grid, we (Provi) were even outnumbered slightly.

You are literally the cancer that is killing EVE, and part of the reason for these changes. I've been playing on and off for the better part of 5 years, and I have yet to even come close to owning a Titan.

Hilmar realizes that and said they are ready to rollback any and all changes chaos brings, they just need to get the data from it and see the effects. Like, he said precisely what you wanted him to say.

Sounds like you would enjoy Faction Warfare. Either join an existing FW Corp (NPC, or Player) and join the war. (Or create your own Corp, and pick a side for the Corp)

Ok this is epic, every like will help fund the slaughtering of all miners.
---
It's 5 o'clock somewhere.

I really wish we could figure out a way to kill a LOT of them instead of just rendering them unused instead.
---
Note to self: groups of people working together making it hard to kill them = unfun for the people trying to kill them, who gives a fuck about the 'fun' for the people we are trying to kill. Therefore, r/eve demands fundamental changes to a game built around emergent player organizations to nerf *some* of those organizations so its easier for r/eve to score big kills with no risk, so that r/eve will have more 'fun' than the organizations that are larger and more organized than they are, which makes eve unfun for r/eve and r/eve only. 
---
Got it.
---
Both works.
---
I appreciate this post
---
&gt; No, atron and slasher tackle is almost never useful in a fight, especially if piloted by someone still new to the game. Please don't put your new pilots in shitty tackle.
---
People really don't seem to understand that newbros can be much more useful in EWAR frigates.
---
&gt;Take a look at your first two sentences. Plenty of time has passed for massive titan and super umbrellas to be trained "naturally".
---
Have you been living under a rock for the past 5-6 years?
---
I have visions of ‘that’ scene in Under Siege
---
So I got curious and checked it in pyfa:
---
With the pyrolance IV drug and the F-906 implant and augmented ogres, you do a total of 3276 unheated, max spooled occult dps non officer fit. 
---
Fully officer fit, with 4 Zorya's Sinks, you can push yourself to 3668 dps. You'd need to start fitting a 5th Sink and DDAs to get over 4k dps unheated.

Fucking PREACH my dude. This speaks to me on such a spiritual level. These fucking kids crying about how they can't safely rat or that they need to wait years to fly Titans in order to have fun. I had fun week one in Eve. I flew a Tristan as a support ship in a wormhole. Then I had fun flying an Eris, then a Stratios, then a Guardian, then a Proteus. It's called fucking progression. These people just don't get it.
---
Trying to earn enough money to plex your account as a new player is basically the equivalent of working a job that pays dramatically less than minimum wage.
---
They're probably aware, it's been posted to this sub in one form or another every day for a week it seems
---
You can pay to transfer with plex, it's either 500 or 1000, you need to open a support ticket. You have to pay that, so you'd make a small amount of isk.
---
You obviously have a larger member than OP.
---
Bout 3 cheap beers with tip lol. 
---
Or one appetizer with no drinks.
---
Yeah man, you get it.
---
Pick a fucking goal, and have fun while you progress towards it.
---
It'll be hella meaningful, even if it's not always enjoyable.
---
That's what sold EVE to so many people. *Meaning*. Meaningful choices, meaningful consequences.
---
Now it's not as meaningful cuz any kiddie with a credit card can buy a Titan pilot day one. WTF is this garbage?
---
They actually have terrible customer service. One of their delivery agents showed up to a wormhole where some of my friends live. After failing to make a delivery until they contacted WINGSPAN's customer support channel, he sent a message calling one a "butthead" and did not make a complete delivery.
---
Oh, sorry.  I though you actually wanted to learn how to answer your own question.

An anti cheat will fix botting. Nerfing playstyles will not. They don't care about bots, they just act like they do, while pushing people to buy Plex.
---
Also CCP are nerfing things that are in no way related to botting eg. High sec incursions. (5% of all in game bounties are high sec. It wasn't a great isk faucet by any means).
---
Need at least two braincells to make a spark, if which I  short...

What end? Keep going
---
This myth of millions of cloaky ships in every null system insta-blapping every ratter and miner is hilarious.  I should know - I fly one of those cloaky ships.  I'd like someone to link the T3/Stratios fit that's alpha-ing Orcas, Rorqs, and ratting supers off grid - I want to buy me one of them!
---
Ishkur?
---
Anyone who downvoted this is a lazy, risk averse shitheap and should just reprocess every alt(bot) they gave.
---
Your points are all spot on and well thought out.  But they will be instantly countered by a brigade of nullbears who cannot understand why they should accept more risk in this game.  They've been coddled for too long and their brains are atrophied.  I appreciate your effort, but it's all for naught.
---
I'm not saying injectors haven't resulted in more titans and supers, resulting in massive overkill by the super umbrella.
---
I'm saying we would be at the same point of effective superumbrellas now, even via natural training.
---
Like balancing Titans around cost, balancing via training time only works for so long.
---
Oh, i´m not on your side. And neither am i on CCPs side. This sure as hell is some risky af shit they´re pulling right now. But in the end the proliferation of megacoalitions began in 2010. Not 2014 or 2017. Sure it was the most optimal way to play. And the most unengaging and effortless way at the same time. These are the end times. The cutthroat grimdark Eve people still jerk their epeens off to has died years ago and tbh it was the only redeeming quality this game had besides doing what Discord does better these days. So yeah, whatever. Have some good times with the game as long as it´s still a thing or don´t and bitch and moan because muh space pixels.

---
It's interesting that I do not see anyone here mentioning the fact that the current change is also likely the least amount of effort development wise.
---
I like your thoughts, and I myself just got a suitcase carrier for this very reason which will now be worthless.
---
As a Software Engineer, I can see that this change is designed to be low impact for development. By simply changing the requirements of the module, and changing freighters to be able to jump to covert cynos. Doing anything else would require more specialized development time. 
---
It's mostly just an observation I haven't seen anyone else make yet.
---
&gt;Like balancing Titans around cost, balancing via training time only works for so long.
---
This we can agree on.
---
Anything requiring actual development instead of database switches is gonna be a non starter
---
On one account? Train one alt to invent and manufacture stuff.  Train the second one to make lots and lots of copies and research up ME/TE.  On the third account, train up all the market/tax break skills.
---
Yeah look at runescape, anti cheat stuff works sooooooooo well

Oh I totally get that, this was just more of a brainstorming thing.

It's got split bonuses to drones and hybrids, was thinking more like 100% drone boat

Don’t really have ideas since I’m a new player but you caught my interest when you said “Chaos era.” What exactly are you referring to when you mention that if you don’t mind explaining?
---
It works better than if they didn't have any form of anti-cheat, wouldn't you say?

Random question since I don't know crap about the new player structures, is there a quick easy way to tell if I can dock in one without trying to do so?

&gt;Thousands of MUDS
---
lol excuse me, and you want to talk about new player retention and numbers? Hahaha kid please.
---
Now, take all those games - excluding the ones you included for the sake of padding - and compare them to EVE on the two metrics you presented earlier: Size of player base, and new player retention.
---
Watcha got?
---
I'm expecting that you'll be able to answer this question easily, since, y'know, you would never just talk out of your ass about something you're not actually knowledgeable in.
---
Scamming plex from CC warriors is how I paid my account when I was a rookie. I know there've been major nerfs to the p2w/whale playstyle lately, but I don't think this is the buff they need.
---
Cause no matter the changes people will keep ratting, esp when changes dont affect them (subcap ratters - cyno change)
---
Ah, i have faction disintegrator and t2 sinks, training those skills now
---
If OP is [this guy](https://evewho.com/pilot/Arqui%20Nurbs/), and I'm 90% sure he is, then the sum total of his experience of EVE is Pandemic Horde...
---
Brave newbies is an anime alliance. 7o

Can we start in jita?

Or ndq
---
Eve has been largely stagnant, and significant changes recently have been dubbed as the "Chaos Era" by CCP. This includes the drifters a couple months ago, the removal of instant local in Nullsec (Blackout), and the newly announced changes to cynos for the September patch. These changes have been more polarizing than the current White House administration.
---
Dear Reddit,
---
I bought my account on online on 3rd party markets and then bought alts which I boosted with injects. I hate any changes to my capital - why can't I solo a small fleet? I paid real money for the privileged to do so. Also my corporation/alliance guaranteed to me that I could krab in 0.0 to make lots of ISK and that it is safe. Are you calling my CEO/alliance leader a liar? What right do you have a developer to change your game that we thousands of random internet people have built dramatic community surrounding?
---
Definitely going to resub my accounts now. 
---
\#sarcasm
---
Oh, so you don't mind if cloaks are removed? That's not what you're supposed to say though. It's in the pvp hunter bin downvote any suggestion. 
---
I'd hazard a guess that the people who use cloaks the most do so because of how much protection it offers. Lets toss some chaos onto that, shall we? Unless you're scared.
---
i get downvoted for breathing, don’t let it get to ya
---
Both do work. But if you were a super pilot you probably would prefer the one that lets you do something with your ship besides spin it.
---
It was literally antiproductive
---
Caused legit players annoyances and botters just coded into it
---
&gt;Size of player base, and new player retention.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Watcha got?
---
The list *literally* includes WoW.  How on earth could you be so dumb as to argue Eve is doing better?
---
Aside from WoW, EQ, Lineage II, TSL, and Guild Wars have more subscribers than Eve, with better new player retention (admittedly, few are joining those games....or Eve for that matter)
---
No.
---
They nerfed the drone bandwith so you can no longer launch 5 heavies... now it is a seriously nasty PVP ship.
---
That makes me think he was talking overheated then, i’ll ask, non officer fit but 4 sinks and faction disin
---
Fucking literally where did I say that?
---
False. 
---
Botters exist as the boogyman excuse for any and all updates CCP wants to get away with. If CCP didn't want any bots period, they could implement that future.
---
I mean isn’t chaos what makes a game like Eve fun. Like why aren’t mas I’ve corporations in constant war and stuff?
---
Yes, as always.
---
I completely agree that eve online appears to turn into Darkorbit, a cash cow.
---
English? Worst? Exceptions? Try Polish, friend.
---
One bad example doesn't make anti-cheat software useless.

---
here is the last 3months graph, look at june the start of summer and look at july, pretty sure july is higher than june.
---
So you feel nothing needed to be changed in regards to the way capitals currently function in eve? What would you have changed?
---
&gt; fix Lowsec first 
---
Literally the first thought that popped into my head when I saw the cyno change announcement was "this is great for low-sec." I don't know if that is a primary *intended* effect, and we'll have to wait to see how it plays out, but if the result is that you can have a roam in ships bigger than cruisers and/or with more than about 8 guys without getting roflstomped by caps, I'll be thrilled with the effect on low-sec.
---
Oh I bet your ass of that is a reoccurring nightmare for them.
---
This is a really good point. As a cloaky dude myself I feel powerless 90% of the time unless I'm running with a massive bomber gang.
---
There's not really any modern ratting ships that I can solo.
---
Good troll ! 10/10!
---
Oh my god an eve replacement!!!!
---
Jags have an awesome tank but not really that much dps compares to other AFs in a 1v1; so most of them should at least reach a tie where noone can break the other or straight up fuck up the Jag if it fails to sustain range control and gtfo before dying.
---
Except the Enyo of course, that ship sucks.
---
I've been fighting the good fight here, problem is far to many PVE players get treated like we don't matter here and in eve proper... so I don't really have backup. Just one man with some alts trying to forge a better future.
---
Wewlad
---
PHOENIX!
---
They need to stop market scammers it's killing the game. They can stick their heads in the sand and laugh at people who lose their isk but more people quit because of this than botters.
---
Requiring alts is poor design imo
---
&gt;Making eve 90% WH space
---
This certainly seems to be the direction they are headed. It is almost as if the design team cannot come up with any ideas, and just runs to r/eve and adopts any old suggestion thrown out by w-space players.
---
I agree that cyno's will be the new cash grab and increase play retention, subscribing customers.
---
It doesn't, except it just makes spontaneous large capital fights ***a lot*** less likely.
---
You should probably provide a link, because googling that presents a thread about skill training completely unrelated with the only ShahFluffers related post was about skill loss on T3C death.
---
&gt;The list literally includes WoW. How on earth could you be so dumb as to argue Eve is doing better?
---
Yes, I would expect the most popular MMO to have more players than EVE Online. Let's not go after low hanging fruit, you're better than that.
---
&gt;Aside from WoW, EQ, Lineage II, TSL, and Guild Wars have reported more subscribers than Eve
---
Okay so ignoring the padding you included in your list... out of all the hundreds of MMOs that have come out since the 90's (probably thousands if you include Asia), only a very small list has "stood the test of time" and lasted as long as EVE Online, and of those, only like 5 have higher player counts than EVE - which is a very niche game.
---
So what was your argument again?
---
There's nothing to fight over besides boredom.
---
Coalition high level leaders, FCs, and line members hang out and talk with each other in multiple discord servers There's not much real animosity, the tiny amount there is is mostly artificial and stems from becoming a caricature of yourself like Mittens and Boat. Everyone can rat and mine in extreme safety under an umbrella so long as they're paying moderate attention. Said resources are infinite. The burden of content creation has largely been placed on a chosen class called "FC's" with no onus on the line member to try and do anything besides show up when told, and press the correct button when told. The meta is to turtle up in your space and spam citadels to create an environment where your enemy has to pull more numbers more often than you to join fleets no one even likes doing, over space no one really wants.
---
“Want to sell sell your mother... used alt”
---
Dream on. Never gonna happen. It's CCP, remember?
---
&gt; it is already a very lucrative low-sp low-risk source of income.
---
Before the "chaos era", sure. It remains to be seen if that's true going forward. The blackout definitely increased the risk, there are a lot more gankers now (which is fine imo). And I suspect that the VNI nerf might overload the current (nullsec) spawning limitations if a lot more people switch over. We'll see, it's early and the adaptation is still being sorted out.
---
But is it a *moist* deep warm hole?
---
Because exploring dry holes is painful and unrewarding, no matter how deep they be.
---
oh cherrypick, you are so right, cause last august was like this august, nothing really happened other than the last legit war on the server on the north and the best month in kills of goonswarm federation history, x47 and this fight  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30001967/201808082200/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001967/201808082200/) and so on. Oh and pve halfed that is so bad for the game right
---
Maybe intentional for chaos. Break more
---
Yes, the icon for the structure on your overview will have a "+" or a "/" sign, meaning you can / can 't dock there.

You can get decloaked with a covops cloak, the only difference is that you can warp off and don't have a velocity penalty.

https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/5510984/
---
&gt;Ok so you don't cyno in immediately. Whats the next plan? Move your recon to 200km? Ok so now you get no fax reps cause they're gonna just have catch bubbles up. Titans? Nope HAW won't hit anything. Your only response is Supers/Carriers. Which are just gonna get fighters absolutely murdered out that far.
---
Have you ever lived under a standing umbrella? And by the way, if necessary, any of my supers can live long enough to pop the inhib and light the cyno if its necessary. It usually isn't, though, because usually people say 'I am tackled, this is on overview' and then light the cyno and a shit load of supers and faxes jump.
---
No there wouldn't be, because we'd take the supers on parade and everyone would follow NC's example and just bend over and take it till we decided to leave again. We wouldn't even need to take out their stations this time, just drop our own and use THEIR infrastructure already in place and giving the systems bonuses.
---
They don't want to treat PLEX any differently than any other item.
---
If they did, the first thing should be to stop them from getting destroyed in wreckage. Since PLEX is pure cash, any lost to the Loot Fairy is wasted money by the players.
---
Based on the ticket, it is not.
---
Veles gun is better if you use t2 ammo on it. But yeah, get bs5, weapons spec 5 and all the support skills up

Ah, the Forever Newb, multiboxing 9 Titans but still a pleb.
---
Its a fun idea that I would love to try. You could also have it so systems have specific statics for C# class that can have a destructible stargate build on it to stabilize it. You destroy the stargate your static rolls and you have a chance to build a new connection.
---
Catching up is a lie and anyone who plays EVE for only a couple of weeks should see that. Stuff like this tries to capitalize on the new players not familiar enough with the game to see that "catching up" on skills will do nothing at all. This is only useful for vets who want to grow and additional toon.
---
Who even starts a RPG and then tries to short-cut everything or even buy a character. Those people have some serious issues.
---
Scams are fine.
---
Bots of any capacity are not.
---
I'm sorry, I couldn't understand that.
---
Ignore him, he drank too much koolaid and now is permanently brain damaged... sad, but not that much considering he did so willingly.
---
sadface
---
Because that end of the sandbox contains enough power to simply tip the entire sandbox over. That part of the game was balanced such that it would take a long time to get there so long in fact that the burnout rate almost matched the retention rate on it. The result was a slow increase in the number of pilots doing it. 
---
Now you can skip the time part that caused the burnout that kept it in check. Now it needs a new balance scale to be balanced against if you want to have any sand left in the rest of the sandbox.
---
Lowsec is the new nullsec🦀
---
And yet here is another downvote
---
I don't think Hilmar is actually leaving though? I think the investors in EVE just sold the company "CCP" to Pearl Abyss. As an employee of CCP Hilmar was still around.
---
Pilots that produce Recon ships will profit from the recent patch changes.
---
If they use the fits you see in promo videos not much to worry about.
---
The spod is strong with that one. Not as strong as the guy following me saying "Shut up Hilmar"
---
Not sure if troll or proper salt... upvoted regardless. 
---
Wormholer btw
---
&gt; the more spread out your forces are 
---
The forces wouldn't spread, they would stay condensed as they move through the new regions, you wouldn't have all these nice easy targets you are envisioning using, and when we leave the space would be unusable until everything regenerated. You would essentially be allowing us to use our rorq fleet as a weapon to scorch earth other people's space. The game already can't handle the imperium when it deploys with its current numbers, do you really want to weaponize the no lifer krabs in the imperium too?
---
Yeah OP’s Friends are straight full of shit. Not sharing a good fit with supposed friends means one of two things; the fit doesn’t exist or your friendship doesn’t exist. Pick one.
---
Are you a u/larnon alt?
---
You sound like him
---
There are several low-sp options for earning isk, but the issue is that many new people are told about: Ratting and Mining which are arguably the worst ways to earn isk.
---
Here is how I do it! 
---
* Scamming
---
* Abyssal Running
---
I get all the isk I ever need through those two options. Since you are in Brand Newbros, have you considered importing and selling for markup "Taxi-ceptors"? Those *always* sell fast and if someone is buying a travel-ceptor they sometimes need one immediately. 
---
Or what about DED site hunting? That is always fun!
---
There is also doing LP missions for, say the Syndicate LP Faction, to buy/sell faction mods. 
---
Wormhole day-tripping was a previous way I made isk.
---
&gt;There's not really any modern ratting ships that I can solo.
---
Gotta love that power creep huh?
---
I wonder what new alien invasion we'll have to provide an excuse to add more overpowered garbage to the game????
---
This is a pvp oriented game, this means that most enjoyment of the game is net neutral. One person's enjoyment comes at the expense of others. Think about that next time you advocate for players having disproportionate advantages in 'having fun.'
---
So basically those in power have no initiative to gain more territory because it serves no purpose. And furthermore no new corps rise to power because the major power players have full control of null sec.

*EVEOPALDRAGON WILBUR JAMES CODDINGTON JR.* YOU GET IN HERE AND CLEAN OUT THIS HANGAR RIGHT THIS INSTANT!
---
They want eve to play like wow. Log in, have a nice easy defenseless kill waiting for them, gank it with no chance of a counter, moon walk home and post the killmail on reddit.
---
In a very simplified way, yes. Small groups can sti take sov (Many doing so right now in the north) but at the end of the day, they're being allowed to. If a Bloc wanted to deny them it would be laughably easy, due to the mechanics of N+1 meta bring king.
---
I wonder is it possible to not understand the point more.
---
What I meant, was of course that the reward vs effort ratio is way too low this point of Eve. Capitals, and not even supers, are definitely not something you have to "put time and effort" to get. Even titans are starting to lose that status.
---
So ironically, your point about flying exact same ship stands true, but the ship is not rifter but rather the end-game capitals. And in Eve there should be no end-game, but different roles.
---
&gt; Though in most other games you don't have to wait (train for) even for months to fly some particular ship.
---
Unless someone has been playing Eve for only a few hours this is not new to them.
---
To anyone who is complaining they will now have to train 10 cyno alts....   Even the idea that the meta can change on them should not be new to them, let alone that skills might involve some sort of investment of time and/or money
---
I think this kinda cool. Sue me.
---
The fit was basically what i had and was shared, but i only got 1.3k dps while he claimed he got “over 4k dps” which based on the comments seems like overheated
---
Unlimited injector use is an issue. Being able to toss down enough cash to instant get your ass into a titan or rorq or whatever doesn't do much more than say "Get into a capital timmy!"
---
Would be nice if there was a cooldown on how fast you could use injectors, or how many you could use before your mind couldn't take it anymore until it rested.
---
You can do burner missions when you get to level 4. But honestly I have no clue how they really work. I avoid missions like the plague.
---
lol Meanwhile I mine the same exact Ores under the "CONCORD Umbrella" while you're getting ganked by lolfit Asteros.
---
I don't know. Secondhand knowledge. WINGSPAN Drake showed up at the E-Uni C2 a few days ago when it had its High-Sec static near Jita. I guess he didn't know that people lived there and just wanted to camp the hole for explorers. Naturally, a few assault frigates and things responded. He jumped the hole to safety after losing his drones. Someone went to their public chat channel and complained about a failed delivery. Along the lines of "that Confessor is a member of our family and will not keep it chained to the Fortizar like your agent demanded," among other things.
---
After returning, the Drake got blown up and sent a message to one of the people calling him a butthead. And apparently someone from WINGSPAN showed up in a Unit chat channel to say that the correspondence was hilarious.
---
Or youre just not using it on the right person.
---
Depends on what kind of corp you joined.
---
Hisec corp? Just be a name and number
---
Right?
---
Like: Can't inject more than X amount of time, can't inject if you're over Y amount of SP, etc.
---
Ask your CEO
---
Try to find some people to hang with. It really helps in Eve, especially early on. There is so much complexity to it that chatting about all of that while you mine or rat can be really rewarding and fun.
---
They are tho. This time last month the daily peak of players as 32k as the US signed on and EU was starting to sign off. Now, the daily peak is 24k most days. And the constant free skill points are the only reason many are still logging in.
---
Iirc a system must be binary to support star gates
---
There is so much room to change tactics a bit and still mine till your hearts content. Look at all the ships available. How many alts do you and your friends have? Look at all the room in the rorquals highslots for capital reps and links. See what's available in the line up of cyno capable ships and what you cam squeeze out for buffer tanks. 
---
I came up with a solution for getting the umbrella back to mining ops and offered it up to the Corp and alliance the first day. I love to help others.
---
 Im already using recons to light cynos on gangs that come visit and moving things around.
---
This shit ccp has done so far is meaningless at the end of the day if you approach it with an open mind and simply work around it. It changes nothing.
---
Why not just put up cyno jammers in systems caps and rorquals use while leaving keepstar systems in each constellation free to jump around?
---
I see the point about it "being spread out" but that's only to a point a ratting super is what 200+ m a tick? I Wana say more so 600 +/- an hour so 1.2b per two hours. A ratting nag in c5 space can get to maybe 3b an hour for an hour or two. Then your done till you find a new hole. That super can go forever as long as the pilot is able. The nag only has a few hours tops.
---
The problem with having more isk coming into the game than is leaving is inflation. Eve needs more stuff in line with how wh isk is generated. I'm not speaking volume. Just stuff like blue lewt and overseer effects. Half bounties and boost lewt. Or something like lol mainly because it can be disrupted and isn't liquid.
---
Idk I don't mind the rorq mining but it being so much better and afkable is a problem I honestly think they need to remove compression and give it to a t2 orca. I say this because that's half the reason it can stay out there forever. It mining isn't the issue it being so much better and easier to scale than barges is the issues.
---
Meh again I assume it's temporary till observatories are out. I doubt it will stay delayed forever. And honestly if half NS kids used d scan they wouldn't die.
---
It isn't that scary but I'm a wher so I'm use to it.
---
&gt;Any catch-up mechanism would probably accomplish the job.
---
Just by the expansion and a get free boost to max level!!
---
Oh boy here we go quoting PCU as an accurate representation of players again. 
---
I can do the same thing: all the bots unsubbed, so PCU dropped.
---
to be fair you can already roam in things bigger than cruisers in lowsec, as long as its the lowsec snuff isn't in
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/wiki/newplayers
---
Bots dont need to unsub or drop. You can use a Gila and navy drones to farm the same way a VNI could as an alpha. Most bots arent subbed anyway.
---
Holy Epic Shit posting.... This is legendary lmao
---
This experience sounds  inconsistent with our corporate standards. All WiNGSPAN Delivery Agents are required to have trained Customer Service V. Please send an EvE mail to my character - Omar Niskanen - in game detailing the matter. We will undertake a fact-finding inquiry and take disciplinary action if necessary. o7
---
Exactly what I got from this... This dude sounds like he's just been brainwashed into thinking EVE is an F1 monkey play experience.  They never learned how to gather their own content and operate independently.  And I'm not saying play the game solo, I just mean that you don't need other plays to take you by the hand to drag you to fights.  We expect people to find a place for themselves in eve on their own.
---
Lol you're delusional.
---
What kind of nullsec combat sites (the kind you have to scan down) can I do in a Tengu?
---
You sound like literally the most generic bandwagon player lmao. Ram jag -&gt; krab VNIs -&gt; whining on the subreddit. Thank god CCP is taking away your gameplay
---
What corp are you in, what kind of stuff does it do, in what type of space?
---
Pick something that they do, which you enjoy doing (even if only to hang out with friends in the corp) and do it.
---
Why don't you ask them?
---
We all cry together friend :(
---
\- make sure you choose things to do that make you WANT to play and learn. Choosing easy/safe/low effort play styles more often than not ends in the game becoming stale and making one quit.
---
\- realize that most players are fcking terrible, especially the ones who chose easy/safe/low effort play styles. So if you don't want to get dragged down to their level of terribleness join a corp that actually has requirements and has a play style that requires brain effort
---
\-  find your own niche, there's a zillion play styles and things to do, settling for the first obvious and easy thing you learn about instead of actively trying to do many different things might be detrimental to your gaming experience
---
It doesn't have a lot of DPS, so just tank up any given T3D and delete the little fucker.
---
Merlin’s were fine until CCP removed the ability to cyno on them, now they’re literally garbage. 
---
On a serious note the Merlin is fun as shit, you can fit it in a variety of ways from dual web to buffer to active, and shit out a ton of brawl DPS. Awesome ship for fac war
---
Just gonna say this much on this post, I agree with it wholeheartedly.
---
The quality of the comments on this post is what is wrong with this Reddit section. FFS, the man writes out a well-argued post and most of you call him out for his achievements instead of responding to his arguments. Yes injectors in mass are a problem, yes they're here to stay, yes cap proliferation is a major issue. 
---
Restricting cyno's to the proposed list solves none of these issues and simply forces people to spend more isk on useless things to cover their assets. I've been playing this game for a year and a half, in that time ive spent money on at most 10 injectors accross four accounts(along with event SP and the 5 buck booster pack). Why shouldn't a player have a capital class ship after 18 months if they can afford them? 
---
Stop responding to logic with bullshit.
---
Maybe they'll introduce new space and make what's left of New Eden a wasteland. Who knows?
---
What is that gonna do? When shit hits the fan, I jump it to safety in one trip myself. Ive been playing this game since 2003 and have never used asset safety.
---
I think this whole thing regarding asset safety is just salty people who have no source of isk looking for easy rewards.
---
Your spelling leads me to believe that you and yours lack the brain power to teach me much of anything. Since you aren't using that gray matter, why not do something productive with it? I suggest modern art, pistols are cheap these days, just pick a decent canvas.
---
It’s not a bad example it’s a good example lol, it’s fucking runescape very similar mindless farming for ingame money

---
Interesting read. I think that information like this needs to be better presented to new players tho. It's easy to fall into the 'i can't catch up rut' because the thing that won't improve as you collect SP, game knowledge, is the main thing holding most people back.
---
if you're ratting in a super and you get caught in the first place you deserve to lose your ship
---
Thinking there is a silver bulelt to botting... right do explain and share you infinite wisedom on how we fix botting.
---
Smartbombs
---
You misspelled Nullsec.
---
&gt;out of all the hundreds of MMOs that have come out since the 90's (probably thousands if you include Asia)
---
This would be the reason I started with a link.  Because the numbers of commercial MMOs released are far smaller than you think.  And if you bothered to inform yourself, you'd know this.
---
The number of "dead" commercial MMOs from the same timeframe is about the same size as that list of ones that are still alive.  Keeping an MMO online is really cheap.  It's only expensive when you're actively developing it.  50% success isn't exactly as stunning as you are trying to portray.
---
(Unless you're going to try to define "MMO" as "Any game with an online component")
---
&gt;So what was your argument again?
---
That you're woefully uninformed, and thus think Eve online's continued existence is a rarity.
---
As FW thrives, Lowsec thrives.
---
As FW Dies, Lowsec dies.
---
Bro, CCP is making "flip switch changes". If you want CCP to make a change you should consider if it can be done with 5 or less lines of code. If not it probably won't be done.
---
i mean, what did they expect when buying a super?
---
Please explain how ccp deleted the usage of supers in actual warfare.
---

Salty!!!!!
---
Its weird you see a lot of the blame related to game design or stagnant meta placed at the feet of the pilots or Alliances that are subject to them. I dont think when that person started skilling into a super they thought, "I hope this ship becomes oppressive and unbalanced to the point they cease use".
---
We had a guy that thought the damage value popping up on his combat log was his DPS. Maybe they're misreading the screen?

Wee correction: dockable structures are indicated with a 🡨 colourtag on the overview.

By that reasoning literally nothing will negatively affect you and anything that makes life easier on the smaller guy is exponentially easier for you. Therefore.... what’s the point of even making the argument? I’m honestly so sick of the “little guy argument”, especially when half the arguments are idiotic. “Oh no, the cyno change is gonna hurt me the one time a year I decide to bait as a little guy with caps” vs “damn, it’s nice I don’t have to worry about every cruiser being snuff/goon/etc bait supported by an entire super fleet”. 🙄 as a kitey boy you might actually see me brawling again. 😂

If you corp is PVP there are tons of ways to be useful, while learning vital skills you'll want to know as you get more experienced.
---
 - Learn how to scout and use D-scan well
---
 - Learn how to tackle and stay alive
---
 - Learn about the deadly hunters known as Gate Guns.
---
 - Learn how to use probes well
---
 - Train into the logistics branch of ships
---
 - Fly on as many fleets as you can and learn the basics of fleet interations
---
- Aligning
---
- Broadcasting
---
- Giving good and concise information
---
- Learning when to change ammo based on range
---
 - When on fleets and the FC asks for a volunteer for a task, if you have the skills and ship for that task, volunteer. A lot of players are shy or unwilling to step up. This is a big flag for your corpmates that you want to help get shit done. 
---
Aside from all that, what can really help will take time or money. Things like
---
 -  Training into interdictors and becoming good at piloting them (A good bubbler is an awesome thing to have for small gang work)
---
 - Training into Command Destroyers and learning how to use the Jump Field effectively. 
---
 - Training into command links to provide bonuses for your fleets
---
 -  Having a cyno alt (Now a bit more complicated than it used to be)
---
 - Having a cloaky alt that you can sit in on a gate to report intel to your FC
---
See what your corps needs, and look at which of those things looks like you would enjoy.
---
Ratting ships have no chance against pretty much any pvp fit ship. No need to be salty.
---
tl;dr someone?
---
The question is how can you and your corp be useful to each other. No point of doing something just to be useful
---
That's pretty neat.
---
Fly tackle, train sabre, if you’re in highsec don’t be
---
The colourtag indicates your standings to the owners, not your ability to dock there. Unless we are talking about different things.
---
That bomb run was sweet
---
Aw. I just realized this is gonna make cyno vigils a lot less cool to watch.
---
Wait I thought for sure there was no PvP in Provi as the blackout for sure killed such a small, independent group.
---
Have I been bamboozled?
---
i don't? supers are unbalanced and opressive by its mechanics, if people actually use it or not its irrelevant. An op ship that nobody uses doesn't stop being op just cause no one is taking advantage of it(or has access to it). 
---
This has nothing to do with who's to blame but with the mindset when training and buying one, when were supers used for anything but spinning and the occasional safe dunk/cancer tidi fest? Yes there are people that use theirs in more risky ways but those are by definition not in the group that are just ship spinning it.
---
unless i misunderstood your comment i guess
---
Yeah, but only for the handful of people that complete the events first.
---
Just ignore him, the dudes got spodbrain.
---
Considering the demographics, a bake-off would be more popular.

Hey there. Haven't heard anything yet. Hope everything's ok, but was wondering if you had any update. Thanks!

Ah,that's why battle reports show everything as 'unknown'

Get in an interceptor, fit a cloak and salvagers, go look around for citadel final timers. Bookmark them.  Right the final timers down. Before it comes out go back to it cloak up and wait for someone to come kill it. A lot of groups leave the wreck behind and it can yield 100+ mil of salvage depending what it is.
---
People like you are the reason I farm hordies for tears.
---
Oh cool I'll note that
---
Id have changed their application to subcaps even going as far as to make supercapitals unable to interact with subcaps
---
Very Very unlikely that you will be able to make enough to pay for a subscription. With the recent changes its near impossible.
---
It's also repeating the same 3 missions over and over.
---
They're a bit riskier to start with, but when you get the hang of them its the same stuff.
---
Or you could just multibox them.
---
4k DPS in a leshak probably isn't happening without being inside a Magnetar where it can DPS on par with a t1 anticap dread

He hasn't played the game long enough to have his own arguments, all he knows how to do is regurgitate what all the other credit card warriors are saying.
---
What did the Judge do to deserve just a rampant Awoxing? :(
---
This is exactly correct. New players feel like they don't stand a chance and won't even try.
---
People that want Eve to continue ignore this at peril of a dead game.
---
&gt;Because that end of the sandbox contains enough power to simply tip the entire sandbox over.
---
Every end of the sandbox contains enough power to tip the entire sandbox over.
---
That's why it's called "balance" not "give small gangs everything".
---
&gt;That part of the game was balanced such that it would take a long time to get there so long in fact that the burnout rate almost matched the retention rate on it.
---
The Character Bazaar has existed for a very long time.  Burnout rate had a much smaller effect than you think.
---
&gt;Now it needs a new balance scale to be balanced against if you want to have any sand left in the rest of the sandbox.
---
I actually like big capital fights.
---
Those will not be possible after these cyno changes - it will not be possible to get a cyno on a grid that contains an enemy super fleet, and game mechanics make cynoing off-grid and warping capitals a fantastically easy way to die.
---
So, now that my part of the sandbox is "empty", and I've already tried your part and found it lacking, I'm supposed to just shut up, right?
---
And when everyone on r/Eve isn't bothering to think about how people will adapt to this (hint: it won't make the blocs weaker), I'm supposed to just shut up, right?
---
Small gang wasn't dead.  I've seen the wrecks of its success.  Small gang gank-a-cap-and-escape-easily was dead.  Way too many can only pull off the latter, and blamed the game for it.  And here we are, with changes that are actually going to make super/titan proliferation *worse*, and drive players *towards* the blocs (or out of the game).
---
It's dumb.  It's knee-jerk.  And it's what software companies do when they panic.  I eagerly await Eve's "New Game Enhancement".
---
Yup, first found out about it due to our Auth system so those might be wonky as well.
---
Why C4?
---
Why not C3 or C2?
---
Or C5 for that matter?
---
And whats up withe the "we do this boring thing, that we think is fun"?
---
I dont get it, please explain
---
Mission Hubs are a common spot. Ask to trail them to salvage if you get a cut. Many do it themselves, but many more leave the wrecks to decompose.  
---
Lowsec has LOTS of wrecks in various areas, but the locals won't hesitate to shoot you too, so you have to be careful.  The wrecks aren't great unless they are T3 variants, but sometimes you'll find loot aboard that has some good value too.  
---
Nullsec has LOTS of extremely good loot and wrecks laying behind roaming fleets, but, once again, it's a tad difficult to get at them if the locals are cleaning up their own messes or trying to murder you.  
---
As for Ninja Salvaging: It can be lucrative. Not my favorite activity. Not a lot of experience with it though if I'm being honest.
---
That's a sticking point for me. There's no immediate way to know something is dangerous.
---
The only way is knowing what it is beforehand.
---
I like the CONCORD idea.  A number of times over the years I found myself thinking about how cool fleshing out the bounty hunter career would be.  Bounty hunters administering justice in lowsec would be great.  How about some ships or modules that can tractor up pods to be turned in to a CONCORD station for more ISK/LP!  T3Cs with new subsystems better optimized for the task.  Add some skill sinks into it as well.  You might not make it if their fleetmate catches up to you first...
---
As with all things EVE, the reward (ISK, loot, LP KMs, fun) needs to justify the risk (Loss of fits, Sec Status lol) and investment of time.
---
Hopefully CCP has been going through some **thorough** root cause analyses as to why people are doing what they are doing to balance the risk vs reward in all 4 areas of EVE (HS, LS, NS &amp; WH).  As you pointed out, each area needs to have a purpose in mind.  Maybe the Age of Chaos will get us there and eventually they can focus on new non-PvE content; like your CONCORD idea.
---
I want to PvP but without tons of time to dedicate I'm just not sure where to go these days.  For now I'll check out the new-to-me Abyssal deadspace and try not to lose a ship!
---
I think CCP has smoked all the crack in the room, but I have faith in CCP ◕‿◕✿
---
Mmmmmm salt
---
i just want to know who bought 1 million uncompressed omber for 65 million ISK from a station in  Minmatar space last week. i forgot the exact location.  I thought omber wasn't in demand.  looks like i am wrong. lol

Coming into my 5th month. I'm the CEO of a ~40 character (about 20 player) high sec static c1 wh industry corp for new players.
---
Idk, seems like the changes could be good for us in the long run, unclear. 
---
Power vacumes in null might be good if we decide to move out there in q1 or q2 2020, but dealing with rising prices on t2s and deflation in the meantime sucks. Really, im just hoping that TEST or something will lose enough people that we'll get cut a favorable deal to move out there/rent space eventually. 
---
Trigs seem good for us (fucking morphine in high sec dude), fuck the drifter nonsense.
---
Also if you come across a battle taking place somewhere in space, that's a good place to hang around cloaked until after its over. A bit risky because others will wait around for the same thing but there's usually t2 wrecks to harvest up. Any player wreck that says elite will give you T2 salvage which is generally good profit. Just be on the ball ready to warp away!

I pray everyday for the extermination of C4 space. Why? Because The common C4 linemember, due to weeks of genetic inbreeding via ts3 since their chains are fucking shit so they cant get any members, has been rendered retarded, autistic, and without senses of honor, armor brawls, or pvp mentality. The large C4 "communities" are actually cancerous growths caused by an inherited genetic mutation in what was once the frontal lobe of the brain due to high levels of liquid spud in the brain. This is also known as radiated C4 spudbrain. Look at WH tapi brave division. They live in a fucking C4 wolf rayet. Cancer on top of cancer.The daily routine of the common c4 corps consists of scanning, scanning, scanning, scanning and when you get something other than a C3 site runner passive rattlesnake ( that still kills like half your fleet and mjds out) you roll out content with yachts. Then you ping for a mining fleet and get dunked on by a couple frigs because you left the frig hole open like a classic c6 russian dread runner. When the C4 corps are getting camped and thus mining is unavailable, c4 directors have been known to release their pent up mining blueballs on their own members, looking for the most minuscule excuse to enforce C4 commissar tapi/bee like laws on newbros and executing them via koolaid injections ( with the poison, in game)C4 corps have an irrational fear of high class space. They imprint this tapi like mentality on all their members via mining links. They unironically think,no, believe that just mentioning the slight, very minuscule possibility of moving to C5 space is gonna spawn HK and lazerhawks in their C4 wh like some fucking voldemort hitler shit ICBM curse on their gay ass azbel and print 350 caps out of it to evict them. If they dare move to C5 space they wholeheartedly believe their new wh would be preseded by HK and hawks via 10,000 dread alts.But C4 corps are evolving, c4 corps killed hk, they helped init, everyone knows this but their biggest secret is that they know how to kill C5 corps without even undocking. Please take a look at lazerhawks discord server, specially the members avatars. Have you noticed something? Yes, you have. the lazerhawks discord members avatars makes you think you are in a furry convention discord server. I rather mine fucking veldspar in tdsin home hole in a gila than look at that unholy heretical discord server again. like fucking holy shit what the fuck michael, purge that thrash asap. C4 corps implanted their spudbrain furry shit on C5 space to kill corps from within. lazerhawks can still be saved from this heresy, once they are purged by fire from glorious, honorable, weeb/furry free C2&lt;NS/C5 masterrace corps. The rest of the non-infected wormhole pvp corps ( except wolf rayet corps/ duralexx/ holesale/ hole control/ pancake bs users) need to group up and evict and burn this thrash from wormhole space. If some furry c4 wormholer starts throwing buzzwords like “we are wormholers too” and “what have we done wrong”, feel free to ignore them and evict them at will. The general rule is if you normalize the extermination of c4, the wh bushido law will have no choice but to follow suit.
---
It's basically just ad hominem attacks and ignoring how new players see a game where other players have had 16 years to stack it against them. And people wonder why eve retention is so low, lol.
---
It's not my intention to do so my dude, I just hope some day sooner rather than later CCP will realize the injustice commited anf bring that little guy up to the side of its siblings where it belongs.
---
Some activities you might find interesting only after few months of playing by seeing them from the side and talking to people might have quite steep entry SP requirements - and by that I mean amount of skills/alts below which you're either completely incapable of participating, or you trying to participate makes you a hindrance to the group. While I fully agree in context of brand new players for their first few months of playing and learning what the game is about, after that they end up in same situation as vets, just without the backup of years worth of asset/SP accumulation. Given inherently competetive nature of EVE as a game in every single activity (even for the soloest solo activities at one point or another you end up either on market or in space) and open world the game benefits from some ways of circumventing the early start advantage by your own traits.
---
As context, when I asked back in 2008 when I first tried EVE what is the optimal way to start, I was given training plan to alarm clock to and stay subbed for about 3 months before starting to play the game. I managed to go through it, tried some pve and pvp (friends got me to join their corp somewhere in Stain) and... realized I'll have about a year of highly optimized training plan before I can fully participate in what that group was doing, which meant even more 4am and login-from-work-to-change-skill "fun". Game improved by a lot (skill queue and no more training skills) next time I gave it a try, but the gap was still there - back then production was unprofitable unless you had maxed out skills and your own POS (both being SP and ISK bar), most corps/alliances required certain skills trained to even consider you joining, and early days of faction warfare was actually quite fun for solo play. I guess I'd still play the game back then if only I realized character bazaar existed and I could get my goals without leaving sub on and playing other games for next half a year or so. Eventually I made another attempt in early 2016, found a group that took me in and gave me enough support to learn how to EVE with me abusing injectors to - as usual - minmax my way around having two 20mil SP accounts in age of "solo" pilots flying with falcon alts and T3 link alts.
---
Note I'm not really seeing EVE as RPG, for me it's more of competetive MMORTS with huge potential for minmaxing thanks to sheer complexity of the game (even if we see it as RPG, I tend to play most RPGs somewhere between a powergamer and munchkin tier of exploiting the rules for advantage). In that context, yes, ability to catch up matters a lot, it's debatable what ways of catching up/outperforming others should exist (and here's mandatory "injectors suck compared to character bazaar" and "ISK/hour should never be a valid metric"), but competetive nature of EVE requires some ways of getting around raw total time subscribed and total time online if we want proactive, competetive players (those often tend to generate content one way or another) to keep joining and playing EVE.
---
This is my own knowledge on the matter so if anyone else has anything to add or correct feel free.
---
Salvaging is one of those things (as far as I've seen)  that can be profitable but isn't always readily available like mining and pve. The best way to go about it is usually to ask others if you can salvage wrecks from their pve sites. Following incursion groups or a buddy in lowsec/nullsec or wormhole space is the best way to make a decent amount of isk. Of course if you have a pve alt you can follow your own alt around. 
---
Another profitable way would be salvaging wrecks of other players but this is really only profitable after decent sized battles. It requires knowledge of where battles are likely to happen (active warzones for example) and also requires that you travel there which isn't always easy. 
---
All in all salvaging isn't a very dependable source of income to log into. It requires plenty of destroyed ships to be profitable and for you to be active in pursuing specific salvaging opportunitys.
---
Pretty much.
---
to be fair they arnt a big thread if you play the game just if you are afk.

Legitimate question: what's the current model for survivable single cyno? Just hit it on a super/carrier? A lot of scenarios in this thread are talking about a single cyno pilot but I would think it would be more around bringing 5-10 cyno pilots to all light at once. I mean squishy cynos is a CURRENT barrier right? So it's about volume. Which means it's more expensive to have big fights but not impossible I would think.

C4 WH space is poison to children's minds and it creates a fake world for them to live in, they think they are safe from HK and LZHWK seeding 250 caps in their azbel, or from the inevitable 60 man TDSIN gila blob out for their rorqual but they are wrong and delusional, this will happen. C4 causes radiated autism which created anime and furries and this introduces pornographic material at a young age and has very graphic and violent scenes which rots your children from the inside. This carries over into adulthood and creates these lazy, nasty, hideous slobs that were once your children that now sleep with an anime/furfag body pillow at night and read mangas at least 10 times a day, this was caused because C4s take a long to time to scan to find content and this rots the brain, just like spodbrain. C4 scanning also consumes your soul and wastes time that could be used to go outside, get 60 minutes of fresh air, do homework and contribute something to society. The people who live in wolf rayets are not the problem, C4s are the problem, think about it, if C4s were deleted, the current C4 corps would move to the next cancer, Wolf rayets, and kill the current degenerates using stabbed cerberus (after their reload killed like 7 sabres of course) living there.C4 WH space is the root of all problems, cancer, war, Africa, anime, furries and Nazis. Since people have to scan sooo much for content on the monitor screen for hours, it uses electricity and is the reason why the oil reserves will run out soon. C4 space causes cancer because it has been proven monitor screens emit radiation and radiation causes uncurable spodbrain cancer. spodbrain has caused war by inspiring the Nazis to side with the Japanese through their cartoons and establishing the Pacific Front in World War 2. African leaders in Africa are corrupted by spodbrain addiction inflicted in C4 wolf rayets as well anime and furry influences caused by this and they cannot tend to their peoples needs and cannot feed them. Future generations of wormholers will be ruined and destroyed by the C4 influence. Everyone thinks the downfall of humanity will be ourselves, but in reality it is spodbrain C4 rorquals . After the atomic radiation, the Japanese wanted to get their revenge on the world and created their ultimate weapon C4 wormholes, which led to the creation of anime, furries, nazis and commies.

I bet they have some good ideas.  Even if they had all of the answers and a sweeping plan, they would be hesitant to implement them out of fear it would shake the New Eden economy (potentially generous ISK faucets) to a point where players/Corps/Alliances in all areas of EVE would be upset.
---
They're damned if they do and damned if they don't.  I would love to see the band-aid get ripped off as a player who is just coming back after a long break and am running solo right now.  I would feel differently if I was still part of a null alliance I'm sure.
---
Exactly.  I was on grid with a mining fleet earlier today.  First of all, it was a thrill to actually get on grid with one, since pre-blackout I'd never make it in time with instant intel.  But then I get there and it's an Orca and a bunch of Hulks.  I'm in a stratios. I sat there thinking whether I could nuke a Hulk before either the Orca's combat drones or a response fleet could get me. In the end, RL intruded before I could figure out the best approach, so I had to leave.  
---
But yes, my cloaked stratios is too oppressive.
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
And why do you think C4 wormholers would take the side of nullsecers (but, apparently, C2 ones wouldn't).
---
\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/jm78YiO.png](https://i.imgur.com/jm78YiO.png))
---
If you look at the various ways to get account time ("omega"), in order of increased costs they are:
---
* catch one of CCP's promotions for $8/month (if you prepay for a whole year) and prepay for a whole year.
---
* no promotion, regular price for pre-paying for a whole year, $132 ($11 per month).
---
* month to month, so you can cancel any time, $15 per month.
---
* PLEX, so you can either use it for subscription or convert it for cash in game, $20 for a month's worth.
---
So in order to grind enough ISKs in-game to get a PLEX, you're grinding for the $20/mo payment plan.  And it's possible to do it in a month, but you have to have some of the "medium" level ships, which:
---
* cannot be unlocked by Alpha (free player) characters due to restrictions
---
* take a few months of skilling up for
---
And, like the others are saying, it's a grind, (at least) 4 hours daily, to do it.  You'll burn out.
---
What we recommend is pay the subscription for 3 months (get a bit of a discount for that), and figure out if you like the game.  By then it'll also be the holidays season and maybe CCP will offer that $8 promotion, get that for the next year.  And during that year you can acquire the ships and "investment capital" to be able to grind for ISKs or play the markets or whatever.
---
God bless that scene
---
In my honest opinion, I would rather T1 indies to retain actual functioning Cynos. A cyno in a fleet would still be super easy to spot and attempt to blap, but it's also simple to train into and costs far less in time and money than Recon and Black Ops. Just penalize it. Make it so the Indy has that time duration penalty so if it lights, that ship is for sure dead.
---
i got eaten alive in my drake as well. got a good rattlesnake fit for lvl 4s?

---
This post will feed my kids for a week.
---
And now it's CCP's cook turn. He deserve his voice to be heard!
---
Mostly PVP happens around these kind of timers. It's the day-to-day random PVP around small/solo hunters that's suffering. The ADM map should explain why...
---
Active tank works better for L4's. XL shield booster, cap battery, cap flux coils in lows to allow you to autorun it.
---
So maybe have security on grid or people on overwatch in the system? I honestly hope people are completely unable to safely solo mine in null. I hope there are hundreds of force recon deaths in the first week as people attemp to cling to their lazy past. The concept of having zero reliance on active security is unnatural over the course of humanity. The diamond mines in Africa have security all over. Isis seized oil production in Iraq for a few years because of bad security or no security. Eve mining ops should be no different. 
---
On demand cynos were absurd. Security at the touch of a button. Good riddance.
---
I prefer chaos to serenity tbh
---
Yep. The difference between the oldest and newest players in 2005 looks so drastically different than how it looks now. 
---
As the game gets older, the average amount of sp is just going to go up and up. That already dismal new player retention rate is going to get worse and worse as “catching” up becomes more and more of a dominant thing. Especially as CCP tries to keep up new content and adding things for older players to grow into. 
---
I’m willing to bet a pretty penny that injectors have actually helped keep a decent amount of new players around for longer than they would have without them.
---
How do you counter the "fast" ones?
---
Every time you jump there is a 1% chance you end up in abyss space without an exit.

Yeah I wouldn't use a battlecruiser for L4's tbh.

Your idea of what lowsec and nullsec should be doesn't reflect what they have been in reality. Lowsec has been the most dangerous area of space for years. The only mechanic that makes nullsec more dangerous than lowsec is bubbles, and all that does is impede travel and logistics. But nowadays hauling large volumes to and from nullsec is done via jump freighter, so even logistics is fairly safe if you want it to be. So long as you stay within your group's space (which, if you're mainly interested in printing isk, is generally what you're doing anyway) nullsec has been and remains a very safe area relative to lowsec.
---
For years lowsec has been the most dangerous place for anyone looking to fill their wallets, and the benefits are generally smaller relative to nullsec. In lowsec there will not typically be a response fleet to save ratters. There is no way to avoid sharing space with hostiles, so ratting in slow ships in anoms is dangerous and less profitable than nullsec anyway. Scanned combat sigs are a little safer, but rarer than in null. As far as I can tell, mining ops in faction warfare space are rare. PI is lower quality and you can't ensure good customs office tax rates. Even the economic activities unique to lowsec are difficult to pull off. Besieged sites are more dangerous than any combat anomaly. Faction warfare missions are relatively safe and profitable, but require you to join FW, which is a whole can of worms in and of itself. Besides, FW missions are arguably one of the aspects of FW that most desperately need fixing. 
---
If anything, what needs to happen is that living in lowsec needs to be more economically viable, given the dangers involved. The current reality is that it is not lowsec that is the stepping stone to nullsec, but the other way around. The way most players enter dangerous space nowadays is by going straight to nullsec. And why wouldn't you? For a low-SP player that wants to be financially self-sufficient while learning the ropes of PvP, nullsec is the safest and easiest route. You will have the reliable protection of your group and generally empty space to rat/mine in safety for hours (especially if you go deeper into null), things that no group in lowsec can offer.
---
Lowsec is still waiting for its overhaul, but the recent changes should overall be good for it. Capital proliferation has damaged life in lowsec just as much, if not more, than it has in nullsec. At least in nullsec there is, in principle, the option of countering caps with caps. In lowsec any group that can drop caps is likely to overpower the vast majority of other neighboring lowsec groups. This limits the ability of lowsec groups to take advantage of what limited economic opportunities it has available to them; for instance, large-scale mining ops are basically not a thing at least in FW space. Softening capital dominance should be a good first step toward restoring a healthy lowsec environment.
---
What sov null players who are unhappy with the recent nerfs to their economic playstyles need to do is deal with it. You still sit in the part of EVE which is the most profitable relative to the risk. Just because the ratio of risk to reward has increased slightly in favor of risk doesn't change that fact. Changes to the game have benefited nullsec styles at the expense of lowsec for years; it's long past time that the balance shifted in the other direction.
---
No, good day
---
I dont think he has a permit
---
Man, what's your problem? 
---
1, Balance? EVE is nearly as complicated as RL. Is RL balanced? At least CCP try to do it with changes. 
---
2, CCP bans regularly bots (thousands of them), changes the environment less bot friendly. They have dedicated group against bots. What do you want more? 
---
3, EVE is never was P2W. You can buy a ship but you can't buy the knowledge to fly it. 
---
4, Yeah, this is right. EVE is a game for adults and not for "give me everything, five years kids." 
---
5, It is just point of view. Would you marketing yourself for a girl with your failures?
---
6, At least they do it. But right, the last events were shit.
---
"For the sake of it" is the only reason PvPers play eve. Otherwise you don't really want to pvp you just tolerate it in the 'meantime'. If all you want to just own a bunch of space, have 3 supers(min) then no shit everybody is bored. Even tho there is PLENTY more space to own. Sounds a lot like ppl need to be told when to fight to me.
---
try a zoryas gun, gives another 8% dps

I just wish scamming was better than just spamming jita with shit contracts. I'd like to steps taken so spamming them in local is bannable (just spam) but the act of scamming still totally allowed.

I was just thinking: what does china have to do with this lel i should go sleep

Also small alliances can afford it. thx.

Don’t bring the small guys for excuse when you want to just say “I hate this change.”

We are not enemies.  I want all of the newbros to have fun.  I want you to have fun and stay.
---
But all these years Eve was designed and balanced around the idea of slow progression.
---
CCP needs to make a change from the ground up in order to counterbalance injectors/citadels/cap proliferations and etc.  
---
CCP wasn't ready for this.  That is what I am trying to point out.  If this is the way CCP wants Eve to evolve, then they need to make the necessary changes first before dropping the bomb.  
---
CCP has 16 years track record of being bad and slow at fixing their stuff.  SO I am very concerned about their ambitious new changes.
---
He wants to be like those Japanese kids who just intensionally bail out of society.
---
Anyone who has it easier than them is cancerous and using their mom's credit card.

A director on one of the biggest alliances in the game, who has been extremely active for almost 2 years now and is one of the most knowledgeable people in Eve I know shouldn't have access to late game content apparently
---
Fucking lol
---
&gt; Who even starts a RPG and then tries to short-cut everything or even buy a character. 
---
That’s a hard question to answer broadly, but if they find the gameplay (or prospective gameplay) to be fun, who wouldn’t want to get into that fun as soon as possible. 
---
It’s the same reason many strategy games let you start a new session from a higher point on the tech tree than the standard start. It’s also why the sandbox mode of those games can be so much fun too.
---
CCP has never struggled to define, some players just have an existential crisis when confronted with there not being a "meaning" or "purpose" to the game.  I fear for them when the realize the same is true about life... It's a sandbox where you can make the game for yourself.
---
The only better day to start than tomorrow is today. Incidentally, the same is true for winning Eve. Someday you too will be able to say "I used to play Eve".
---
I could care less. Feel free to cyno in to Esoteria anytime. Bring friends.
---
This pvp was generated from nullsec bloc warfare, not \~elite pvp\~
---
I see what you did there hahaha
---
Align when the FC says to align, warp when he says warp, and don't jump until he says to. Do those things and you are a better player than 95% of the player base.
---
Unlike this battlereport
---
Until you have mechanics in place that encourage activity in space that isn't everyone in one area AND mechanics that get fights to happen and keep happening rather than one side instawarping away when they don't have an auto-win... It will just be more of the same. 
---
Hope you like bashing structures and CTAs
---
A lot of people from a variety of in-game backgrounds are complaining about the changes.  Yeah, some of them are the ones who "bought" their way into power.  Others are from small groups who have witnessed a series of balance changes that will supposedly enhance our playstyles fail spectacularly.
---
Valk.... give me any change that will not affect small groups in some ways more than large. Small groups also no longer need half of eve blue to jump hfs to deeper space now. And if you are smart you’ll never lose a covert cyno they are jumping to. Moving capitals through hostile space is definitely harder. But that seems to be part of the point. These changes give options to the small guys that we didn’t have before.
---
How do you scam (asking as a newbro)
---
Pretty much all of them.
---
The fact the Terrans haven't made a new evegate to conquer neweden imo means that they died out.
---
&gt;Make it so the Indy has that time duration penalty so if it lights, that ship is for sure dead.

that's actually a buff to how industrials are used for cynos in null, so probably not an option

The only thing I can think of in a 1 month old toon to make that kind of isk is gas huffing in wormholes.  
---
Lets call that a nice round 20 mil an hour, because you wont be able to clear sites before the rats show up and you wont be able to kill the sleepers so youre going to spend a lot of time scanning, and thats 100 hours a month just to pay for the privileged of being able to farm for 100 hours a month.  
---
Meanwhile, $15 is less than a bar tab that you'd spend in one night out.  Just spend it on a subscription and spend your time actually having fun and farm a fraction of the time you were before to support your new ship blowing up habit.
---
It used to be so OP, I loved it. Nowadays I always seem to lose fights in it though, not really sure if its because of power creep and changes in the meta or because I don't play enough EVE and my skills are rusty. Probably some of both.
---
But yeah, one of my favorite all time ships, I used to solo big game hunt battlecruisers and battleships in a Merlin with great success, a few years ago.
---
Imagine being this ignorant and salty about a fucking video-game. What is this his life? lol

Man CCP really fucked the vigil shit here. I literally cannot think of a better option than what I listed above if they are going to do that.
---
Make gay fury porn and send to them.  Worked well for me, was promoted to a director in the corp the next day.
---
i will put it simply, this july had more kills than last july, where 2 wars were going on and ualx happened. Also comparing summer months were activity is the lowest of the year compared to winter or spring is not a good comparison.
---
Thats really not true. He says he has alts and in the given time frame he could train up alts for the given ships listed with just omega time and remaps and possibly MTC so....
---
I *want* small groups to flourish. We need more smaller alliances to hold space that aren't renters. I think large blocs will be more prepared for this change. That's all. (also, fixing broken and OP cyno jammers would benefit smaller alliances). CSM has repeatedly brought this up, only to be ignored.
---
This isn't a battle report. This is false advertising.
---
the goal of these changes is tear extraction and removal
---
as you can see, it's working *wonderfully*
---
Thats what I'm doing!
---
im sure you can figure out another to pay your respects.
---
Except for the fact that covert cynos require Cyno V which is a ~25 day train from Cyno IV. 
---
Anyone with a decent JF network is going to have to train those for the next few weeks or months depending on the size unless they spend a ton on injectors/MCTs
---
looks like it's gonna take about 2 days to finish skilling into this ship.
---
have you never seen Jita local?
---
Petition to allow cynos on the Bellicose one day per year.
---
He literally says in the post you cant. Plz read. He is pointing out that SUBCAP ratting is DOWN while CAP/SUPCAP ratting is UP and THATS the problem, not unsafe ratting. Its the REWARD dropped with MORE risk. Thats the statement.
---
We agree on that. More smaller groups holding space is better. I honestly don’t think these changes will effectively hurt that tbh. For the small group it brings more benefits than disadvantages. Even if it makes them throwing caps around a bit harder.... if it’s that prohibitive.... it more likely saving them from whelping those caps. Making large alliances use cyno beacons leaves things vulnerable as they can just immediately dock. Every ship in space isn’t about to drop a nyx on small groups so they can actually engage more often. Etc. jf logistics may take more planning/higher skill but.... now it’s possible to take those jf places without citadels the whole route. Yeah.... definitely think it provides more benefits to the small guy than disadvantages even if it isn’t a total buff. 
---
Large blocks will always be more prepared for a change. That’s a function of organization and manpower. Game changes won’t really be able to change that.
---
Two. The blops and JF can be on the same pilot with the blops disassembled every time JF jumps.
---
&gt;Just hit it on a super/carrier?
---
Generally, some sort of capital.  If you want to bring in other caps at a different position, you'll generally throw a handful of cyno interceptors at it and get a cap or two through, and then that cap lights a cyno.
---
You use interceptors b/c of bubble immunity.  They die in seconds, but one will sometimes last long enough to get a cap through.
---
With the new system, getting a cap through just means a dead cap.
---
&gt;I mean squishy cynos is a CURRENT barrier right?
---
No, because the "real" cyno isn't squishy.
---
&gt;So it's about volume. Which means it's more expensive to have big fights but not impossible I would think.
---
You're forgetting about the bubbles.  None of the new cyno-capable ships are bubble-immune.  So you can't place the cyno anywhere but 0 on their blob, and you usually don't want to be there.
---
Asset safety, then pirate presence, then resource depletion.
---
And if that doesn't work, CCP will just accuse Goonswarm from exploiting and breaking the game, like they did with Zombie INC. and ban our leadership.
---
huh, I just noticed K-Y-R joined Horde
---
yeah but everyone is saying how great it's gonna be to cyno JFs into safe spots in null-sec via covert cyno, so how you gonna assemble your blops at a safe spot?
---
Most of them except some with very specific requirements like Angel's 10/10.
---
til that caps instalock cruisers
---
if you don't need to pvp to build an empire - why would you waste your time pvping?
---
people live in null to build empires, that's the entire purpose of the space.
---
So we are making sweeping changes to the game that break and harm many aspects of it so that you can feel better because you might get a better kill? Not really a recipe for good game design.
---
OP seems a bit fragile.
---
&gt; Also, the Tech1 industrial overhaul absolutely changed functionality
---
haulers went from being able to move lots of shit...  to being able to move lots of shit.
---
The "issue" with EWAR is that to a new bro it looks and feels useless. 
---
Sure you can tell them that they are turning the eagle/muninn they are targeting into a 300m brick but it doesn't look the same as shooting missiles at someone
---
EvE works in 1s ticks, but that doesnt mean everything happens in 1s intervals.
---
It means everything *updates and is processed* in 1s intervals.
---
Guns constantly are calculating their next time to fire, so a gun that shoots every .4 seconds for example will shoot every .4 seconds, but the server will process all shots taken in the last second, every second.

Hello, that's what A LOT of us are doing. I'm not spending a penny or logging in again till CCP grows the fuck up and acts like an adult company and treats the customers right.
---
not really - nothing is stopping more titan pilots being created in either situation. both are just moving titan pilots around, and doing it with injectors is significantly less effient due to the diminishing returns on injected SP. so if anything, the era of injectors is potentially producing less titan pilots than we could have othwerise had.
---
imagine all the SP lost from diminishing returns were turned in to titan pilots?

Nothing better than surprise lazzzzors

Ishtar. Just costs more.
---
Haha, right. So ridiculous that ppl are so upset when its now so apparent that it was overpowered.
---
The cyno change (as it is proposed) makes cap escalations harder, especially from smaller alliances. I see this just adding to the turtle up mentality by big blocks.

But MAHM CCP hasn't unfucked containers yet!

You know it's interesting to me how you folks never consider how *few* people from 2003-2005 there are left. Hell, even from when I started in 2009 and again in 2011, basically nobody that I knew is left.
---
I remember back in 2012 CCP released some data, I can't find it anymore, but the average player had something like 10 million SP, and a few years later that number had barely budged to 12 million SP. It's really not a big deal.

If this is what's preventing you from playing EVE, then it's not the game for you.

Very good frigate, useful all around.
---
Fleet &amp; small gang: One of the best T1 frigates for fighting in small to medium-sized groups. Typically you fit blasters, MWD, tackle, shield buffer. Having relatively slow base speed matters less in groups because 1) you're still faster than armor, and 2) in a group it matters less if one pilot can't control range, because the other pilots can provide the tackle. The shield resistances bonus makes it very good with T1 logi. For players looking to get into fleet command, Merlins + shield logi is a solid and easy to command fleet concept that I like to recommend.
---
Solo: The low base agility does matter a bit more. It can definitely struggle with range control at times. You can sometime use one of your low slots for a propulsion upgrade to mitigate this. Still, quite a good ship in the right hands and circumstances. The 3-4-3 slot layout is quite flexible and you can pull off a lot of interesting fits. Blaster fits with web+scram+shield tank, or dual web + MASB (no scram), or dual web + armor tank, or rails are all reasonable options. Quite good in FW if you're sitting inside the plex at 0. I sometimes think of it as an Incursus, with slightly less DPS but also slightly easier to fly (managing ancillary rep cycles is not entirely trivial at first).
---

---
You got the problems right and somehow completely missed the solutions.
---
*he climbed on his ego and jumped to this IQ
---
Guess we shall see. You are correct that cap escalations are harder. Which in and off itself is a boon to small groups while also being more difficult for them. Big blocks will continue to turtle regardless imho. The problem with having small groups is only partly mechanics. But more so people and their desire to gravitate towards the security of the big blocks. There’s a lot of opportunity now for small groups. But they have to make use of them. 🤷‍♂️
---
You probably coulda taken out a Hulk. Probably fit for max yield anyway, and probably no tackle, and if they had tackle, they're Hulks... just like, align out and pray. :)
---
5min cyno is still aids for such expensive hulls
---
Here's a situation I have no evidence for. You can pick from either the end of the world, or agreeing with me.
---
Covert cynos only lasts 60s or 30s if you use a recon. It's fairly simple to just cyno them on stations.
---
Now, even with two pilots you can still use the blops to jump to a cyno beacon and then light a covert cyno on safe/station. It's more risky because you are using your Blops to do it, but you shouldn't be in troubles unless that beacon got camped. And if you don't have friends telling you those beacons are safe maybe you shouldn't jump on them to begin with?
---
they provide you information just enough to pay 15% tax, not saying it s a fault.
---
Ninja salvaging can be many things:
---
 - Find a system on Dotlan that has a super ratting in it and bookmark his site to salvage later. 
---
 - Find a pirate sotiyo and hide a cloaky freighter nearby to try and loot the faction Titan BPCs when they drop.
---
 - Get a cruiser that is tanked and stabbed and follow random fleets around looking for a fight. Salvage the PVP wreckage after they leave (or during the fight if you've got the guts.)
---
 - Drop loot and salvage materials in any citadel (friendly or otherwise) and asset safety it back to yourself. Or just get a third party to haul it. Or put it up on contract.
---
&gt;Jump Freighters will now be allowed to jump to Covert Cyno beacons as well as regular Cyno beacons.
---
This kinda annoys me since JF can't equip covert systems in general. Like, why would they be able to detect a covert cyno in comparison to all the other more militarized ships in the game?
---
So your only explanation for why it should be limited to the two ship classes CCP chose is that people don't like the change and complain about it? You don't have any justification for why mechanically cynos should be limited to those two ships so you just dismiss my argument by calling it whining. Hate to break it to you but simply claiming that the other side of the argument is whining is not an argument. Also what further restrictions could there possibly be? Especially "way more restrictions"? Cynos, as it is now, are limited to 8 normal ships, a few AT ships and a few special ships such as the enforcer.
---
With the coming changes?
---
Make an alt. Train any race cruiser to 5. Train cyno to 5. Train cloaking to 5. Train recons. 
---
Now you have a cyno alt and they'll love you.
---
Ty, but I understood almost nothing, I just played 1 week... There are some concepts that I still dont control well...

24.6 trillion from NPC commodities, the vast majority of which is blue loot from WH. Same month Delve Bounties is 8 Trillion isk. I think it's conservative to say that at least 33% of WH blue loot comes from C5, so it's save to say C5's print more isk than Delve.

They were warned. If that's the optimal way to play. It was made to be by CCP. It can be fixed, by CCP. They choose not to. Forgive people if they seem frustrated with devs who seem to know nothing and take advice from no one. Stop complaining and enjoy it while it lasts is a solution to nothing.

Nobody cares

CCP never finishes what they start, let alone think about the next thing after which is tied in. They still haven't even finished tiericide.

Yes because it also requires a second account. That seems like a reasonably large cost to me.

Man the tears are great, suck it the fuck up.

You know there are many many people who tolerate subcap gameplay because they enjoy using their caps. You can't just force people away from that and expect them to want to keep playing. Or you get a other exodus like the last time they tried to limit use of caps.
---
It’s funny how years ago people used to say go play wow to eve players who were unhappy and now people are saying I’m going to go play wow!
---
Why would they need to restart the EVEGate themselves? They had no idea where New Eden was located at, only the connection that once existed via the EVE Gate. It's entirely possible they did expand, but to other nearby star systems, rather than trying to re open the EVE Gate.
---
What are supers meant to do in sov stuff?
---
&gt; So how do we move towards those goals more directly? As an individual, I don't have an answer for that.
---
I feel like you missed something too...
---
Effectively this
---
It's a lose-lose situation. Encourage activity outside of one area and give people incentive to expand? Dominion sov, boom, you get the CFC/N3 shitshow all over again.
---
I can kind of see why it *feels* like a worse form of scam, as PLEX is more tightly coupled with RL money. That is: people buy PLEX for RL money, and then get scammed out of the PLEX. So it probably feels as if they've just gotten scammed out of RL money. - Of course practically, within the game, there is little difference between PLEX and ISK, so ISK and PLEX scams are practically the same thing for experienced players.
---
My only concern would be that newbies are by far the most likely to fall for this, and effectively losing RL money to a shitty game mechanic is probably not going to encourage them to keep playing. And we can really do without driving new players away xD
---
No mechanic will fix it. It's human nature that's the problem. People have to put time and effort or real life money that's attainted with time effort sweat, to buy things in game. They naturally will be risk averse with their toys. 
---
Would you go buy a brand new car and then go drive it through a swamp or make a trail through the forest with it?
---
Adding to this, that means that if you have a thing or group of things you like doing, you should join a Corp doing those things. An explorer can join Signal Cartel and be useful by finding trapped pilots, while making a fortune in loot. A miner can join a null aliance and slowly expand their operation until they can fly a rorqual and use it to build op the alliance military. A person who like missions is probably going to do best in a high sec corp and if you like combat you should join a PVP corp and train up their skills and learn how to fly in a fleet or small gang.
---
Got ya. Thanks for the breakdown!
---
had that yesterday, its just a visual bug. The actual bonus was the same (at least for the 3 chars i had active with it)
---
you forgot the most important part. Make SOV count again aka the space must have some value. ATM the inhabitants which "use" the space are the value of space. Delve is so big and fat cause the inhabitants made it that way combined with the MOON changes from CCP. 
---
Back in history the huge wars where waged about ressources, grudges and big battles came from personal fails (asakai), ressources /fountain/ or personal grudges and ressources involved (casino/world war bee). 
---
As you see atm the big blocks only have hatred for each other left, but that hatred runned dry when CCP targeted nullsec as their "evil demon which is the reason we lose players and we dont get the goal perl abyss demands from us". Seems Icelandic mentality is totally ignoring the tools of self-reflection or just CCP does. Hilmar and Falcon went on a crusade Bandwagoned by reddit pvp'ers and the problem is, they already dropped the pcu by 3k players numbers will decline further.
---
You want more Players? INVENT AND INVEST IN YOUR MONEY PRINTING GAME. I feel its like 2014 - 16 again lol.
---
So first off citadels have damage cap, remove this shit.
---
Timers: 2 Timers should be enough allow remote repping on structures to make up for the structure timer.
---
Make Space worth it again, nope depleting ressources = crop rotation. Worth it means income for small and big ones on top of utilization by its members. Yes that will mean having more space is lucrative again, but also having small space should be lucrativ.
---
Wars where fought for the control of ressources, or ressources but when everybody can mine all ressources you dont need to invade irak for oil and other stuff right?
---
Bring local back, so fucking small guys have a chance to see the shit coming. Free intel was the argument? Wait why dotlan gives free intel which system's have people ratting cause it shows npc kills.

Ok great i don't. So what is there for me? Nothing that's what.
---
&gt;So, now that my part of the sandbox is "empty", and I've already tried your part and found it lacking, I'm supposed to just shut up, right?
---
What comes around goes around. Adapt or die. You had your time in the sun now it's time to wither and die.
---
&gt;And when everyone on r/Eve isn't bothering to think about how people will adapt to this (hint: it won't make the blocs weaker), I'm supposed to just shut up, right?
---
Which is why we need more direct action to break the backs of the major empires. This feels to me a lot like dancing around the issue rather than going for the jugular like they should be.
---
&gt; And here we are, with changes that are actually going to make super/titan proliferation worse, and drive players towards the blocs (or out of the game).

This is why i'm concerned. We need to be obliterating the null blocks not forcing people into them more tightly.

---
Jesus stop thinking null is the best thing this game has to offer. Just because you skipped the whole game and went turbo krabbing in null doesn't mean the game is bad because it is now harder to do.
---
When I started playing eve a friend of mine who played it for like 2 years at this point dragged me into it and for the first 6? months I was sitting with him in highsec mining and doing missions. As soon as I got the fundamental skills to fly ships with decent fittings he introduced me to 3 of his friends and together we started living in lowsec and annoying everyone who was around us. We often roamed null in the evening and on the weekends. At some point we joined a null pvp alliance and had large scale fight until we decided to live in npc null with alot of the people we knew from the alliance who wanted to do their own thing. 
---
So I started from highsec went through low into null and sometime later tried WH and I'm still happily living in lowsec now. And guess what, there was no need to directly go turokrabbing in null when you just want to play the game. I guess if I had just skipped the complete game I would have stopped playing pretty fast.

@Sonic i can appreciate your feelings, when i finaly got a carrier long ago it was excatly that, my suitcase my golden ticket to null an moving to my corps new home. The cynos were goldfish in a barrel i lost them alot dyring moves through space it was just the price of jumping so being disposable was the optimal choice. Your also right about the lazy change its cost efective for sure for ccp but the reality is none of it is new developement or content creation.

When we moved out of our C3 for the blackout we decided to stage near provi and fight with the bloc. We have been able to find small gang content nearly every night. It’s been a lot of fun.
---
Chaos era, no consultation needed
---
With links, and rorqs and gonna fit them now, you get up to 182k with super cheap fit and heat. You need what? 20 machs to volley that thing? lol, may I remind you that bses have slow lock time and rorquals have capital remote shield boosters on them? Enough time for response fleet, besides there's a thing called cyno beacon. Rorqs are the least affected of caps in nullblocks.
---
&gt; Which is why we need more direct action to break the backs of the major empires
---
There is absolutely no mechanic you can introduce into the game to do so.  The blocs have the money and manpower to adapt far more easily to anything you throw at them.
---
Make it hard/expensive to have a lot of players?  "Goonswarm Alliance 1" through 47 will be formed the next day.
---
Reduce anoms?  The blocs can take more space.  Meanwhile a small corp trying to live in a constellation now needs a region and can't take it.
---
Take away local and cynos?  15 rorqs in one anom with a handful of pre-positioned recons is a lot easier for the blocs.
---
You are asking CCP to somehow nerf players working together.  That's not possible.
---
&gt; We need to be obliterating the null blocks not forcing people into them more tightly.
---
Then you are cheering exactly the wrong things.
---
You need a higher-density NULL so that the blocs can leave space for others.  You need a way for small groups to protect themselves, ad no locals + no cynos is the opposite.  You need a way for one person to handle the logistics, and "lol just get 5 recon alts" isn't it.
---
Everything you are doing hurts everyone living in null, and the people *least* hurt by it are the blocs.

Breaking your game maybe. The eve I started with was way more hardcore than the eve we play now. So theres this little conflict between folk who started with the big scary eve and the folk who started with the easier less scary eve. In my vision, and I really believe many other folk like me think this way,  it should not be easy to bring capitals everywhere. It should take alot of work and alot of people to effectively use capital ships and thats simply not the case right now. Today you can put a cyno on a worthless piece of shit ship and the suddenly the most powerful ships in the game appear and shit on you and everything about that is wrong. Maybe this isnt the best change in the end but goddamn am I happy that they are making an effort to change thd literal most broken aspect of this game.
---
Whenever pearl abyss decides they want to pull the plug. That’s my bet.

If you dont care, then just don't comment?

maybe before the blackout... now how are you gonna know you have a cloaked dictor in system that has been there for 4 hours?

Why not have them add Memorial Candle charges that work with display launchers?

Or maybe people can just be annoying?

Then you're not looking.

Honestly try level 4 missions. They are somewhat comparable to NullSec anime provided you salvage and loot. Low risk too. 40-50 mil per hour IS a big income, and it seems inflation and easy access in null space has made people undervalue oak.

Played as a trader a good while back, kinda feeling the urge to make some isk. Is the game in a good state these days, and for traders at that?
---
People generally avoid cyno beacons outside of fleets.  They're death traps.
---
We needed blue supply lines before this.  At least an astra on each stop.
---
I feel you, though, they probably kinda do their local schedule, right?
---
I’ve read over many things on there. I think I get the game’s industry mechanics of resources and the stages of production etc. The thing that’s killing me right now is I feel like a good ol’ hardware store trying to sell my private label parts right next to a chain hardware store that has guns... 
---
Ultimately I want to be able to build my own pvp ships from my own resources because right now, I’m a terrible pilot. Watching my isk take a dip after an hour of attempting content is... defeating. So my solution is to build my own stuff so I don’t see the net loss on my wallet just my revenue. Selling one BS covers the cost of a fully equipped ship I’m capable of flying 3 times over.
---
Just using them and goons as an example most people instinctively can understand.  In reality there are a number of groups that don't run public fleets, that outside of TEST, Goons, and maybe NC, Alliances probably don't have enough spies around the universe to actually get notified of when they happen.
---
And has he heard about the rorqual changes?

Doing that changes the net loss from money to time. If you make ships just to feed them 5 minutes after getting them fitted, you lost time instead of money. If you're new, I highly recommend joining a newbie friendly org. I recommend EVE Uni, as they're the most unbiased, helpful, and reputable newbie friendly group around whose sole purpose is to help new players. They're good people.

So don't use an alt. Use your friends. Simple.

It is like you love being a little pussy. Loving it.
---
this is probably the single biggest new player issue that CCP has done nothing to address. 
---
pretty much every online game \*ever\* has obvious cues as to whether something is too difficult for you to fight. EVE has nothing. Since the ship size is utterly meaningless when it comes to things like sleeper, invasion, diamond rats, etc. Even normal rats, depending on your ship type/fit, the frigates may be the bigger threat because of scram/web/neuts than the battleships.
---
It's a hard problem, and one I've never seen CCP even attempt to tackle.
---
You know recons can warp cloaked right?
---
Because it's not 2005 maybe? 
---
Additionally a program that simply compares running processes to known cheats isn't spyware. That's literally what an anti cheat needs to do. Since Blizzard had the credit card details of their playebase anyway, (one of the main "concerns" in the article is moot. Finally they aren't looking through your waifu folder, or doing anything with the data once compared, so calling that spyware makes no sense.
---
Another point is that blizzard and RuneScape aren't the only implementations of anti-cheat software. You've gone for the two worst examples you can find. 
---
Just about every popular game Eve is losing players to, from fucking Fortnite to Star citizen (devs have said they're watching the alpha, and will implement an anti cheat when necessary) have or will have anti cheat software. Elite dangerous players have been complaining about a lack of anti cheat for a while too, and devs have started coming down hard on cheaters.
---
&gt;It didn't work in X game
---
&gt;This game had a controversial implementation
---
Is no excuse for CCP not either using an anti cheat, or seriously improving their current bot detection methods.

I think using something that makes either... Owning more territory beneficial but also harmful if the sov isn't used.

For example.

You own 10 systems all highly used will provide more then someone who has 50 with 10 used.
---
you dont have a choice if you want to keep the ability to have a cyno army. Basically you have to inject or become much much weaker. Not to mention cyno alts that are crusial for alliances and in no way can be removed without hurting a ton

Too bad they aren't a WH corp.

---
Its time to stop pretending there are two equal sides.
---
​
---
There is the intellectually and morally superior side, and then there are the C4 corps.
---
The C4 corps hate that we Reddit-browsing and NPR-listening coastal liberal "elites" are the winners in a service-based globalized multicultural society because of our open worldview, and they blame all their failures on minorities and undocumented immigrants. They are seeing how America is increasingly becoming vibrantly diverse, and how non-white people will soon be the majority and losing their privilege terrifies them.
---
I've come to realize that much of American history is made up of periods where C6 corps drag C4 corps kicking and screaming into the future, then we try to compromise for a while, then we go back to dragging.
---
"No, C4 corps, we're not going back to England."
---
"No,  C4 corps, we're not making George Washington a King."
---
"No,  C4 corps, you can't form your own country with blackjack and slaves."
---
"No,  C4 corps, you can't keep denying women the right to votes."
---
"No,  C4 corps, we're not going back to the way things were before the depression."
---
"No,  C4 corps, literacy tests aren't constitutional."
---
"No,  C4 corps, you can't deny homosexuals the right to marry."
---
The names of the parties change from era to era, but it's always been c6 corps dragging c4 corps against their will into a better future. I grew up in one of the in-between eras, where we all thought that compromise was a possibility, but I'm more and more realizing how mistaken I was about that. It's time once again for c6 corps to stop being nice and drag c4 corps into the 21st century.
---
The simple fact of the matter is that c4 corps just aren't offering any good ideas any more. What's the compromise between "We need to stop climate change" and "Lol, climate change isn't a real?" Or "Homosexuals should have the right to marry" and "Homosexuals cause hurricanes?" It's like being in a group project with someone who didn't read the book and expecting them to do their share of the work.

To my shame, I’m not new. I’ve had an account for a few years and I’ve stepped up to three with 9 toons total. Mostly they’re for the passive PI gathering and some Datacores. My mains are miners and one working on combat skills. Being a ship builder has been a long time goal for me and using that base to fund my attempts at learning to pilot is the path I’m on. I’ll take a look at Eve Uni though. My current Corp is helpful and friendly but I think they’ve got an established Indy person already. So I’m just dead weight
---
Loses* and also, being the old man yelling at clouds over things you have no concept of? Not a good look ya old fart.
---
Gotta love the r/eve peanut gallery shading the 2 year old player who got Pied Piper'd into farmville nullsec by incompetent and amateur CCP developers. Of courssssse it's his fault he thinks this is the way the game is played. It's only been....the way the game is played for the entire time he's played. Always someone else's fault isn't it? The players, the gaming market, players getting older, the moon rising in virgo. Anything but the idiot developers you can't wait to gild every time they come here. Oh yea, \*now\* you hate everything. Hey why don't you dumb faggots talk about "occupancy sov" anymore? You used to lovvvvvve talking about "occupancy sov". You couldn't open a thread here without seeing that stupid shit spammed everywhere. What happened? Oh yea, now it exists, you hate it. OK now you see the game's broken, wow, great insight, it would be very useful for anyone with a fucking time machine.
---
But your implication is the only cost is ship. The cost is the ship plus another subscription paid by someone. It's disingenuous to ignore that cost.
---
Bend over and take the koolaid.
---
&gt;Paid for 200 plex so I didnt have to worry about dying to a mechanic I was not familiar with.
---
What do you mean by this? Plex doesn't prevent death...
---
&gt;As someone not familiar with eve drama, it makes sense to me that in systems where there is no concord, there is no local?
---
It's a new change. Historically everywhere with NPC gates has had local. If CONCORD can maintain the gates in null they can maintain the local window (lore wise). The lore excuse is the Trig invasions.
---
&gt; I've almost trained up for covert ops for my heron, and currently my biggest fear is traversing some low sec system that is held by a corp I'm unaware of.
---
This game takes a lot of research. There are many things to keep track of. It's fun but it adds some investment into learning new things.
---
For example, and perhaps you already know this, but your Heron is not going to fit a covert ops cloak. It's a tech 1 explorer. If you want to use a covert ops cloak the Caldari explorer is the Buzzard, and it requires additional skills besides the cloak module to fly. If you don't want to wait for the cov ops frigate to finish training you can buy an Astero instead (it can fit a cov ops cloak).
---
Either of those options are going to be significantly more expensive than your Heron.
---
As for your fear of encountering some corp in low sec, that's not really what happens. Players don't just camp gates all day because they're in the area, and will often move their camp around so they don't show up on stats too long. Your Heron has a good chance of escaping moderately sized gate camps; unless they use a very specific method to improve locking speed you'll probably get away.
---
The income of doing lowsec or null sites will very quickly make up for the added risk in a Heron, in large part because they're so cheap.
---
&gt;This is the first game that I'm reliant on a third party site to navigate the map safely.
---
A lot of people do this but the in-game map is far more useful than most people give it credit for. You can adjust the "color by" tab of the map to get all sorts of information, from player ships destroyed in last hour, average number of pilots in space or stations over 30 min, jumps in last hour (traffic), pod kills (common for bubble camps in null), NPCs killed (gives an idea of where people are ratting), and more. There's nothing wrong with using dotlan or other tools, I use them as well, but for general travel there's not a lot of reason to dig into the weeds that much. Especially on weekdays when most people are in work or school (less gatecamps generally, will be even less once school starts back up).
---
&gt;Anyway, I love the salty memes, and although everyone says join a corp, I'm loving my time in wormhole space by myselfl, I feel like I'm making my own episode of star trek.
---
The best part of being in a corp is having access to players who already have knowledge you lack. I recommend joining a corp too...if you're interested in wormhole space, find a wormhole corp. Try it for a few weeks, learn everything you can. If you want to go back to soloing then quit; nobody can force you to stay in their corp. Living alone it a wormhole is one of the most difficult activities in the game, and a ton of tedious and consistent work, but if you do it you'll learn a huge number of useful skills (as a player, not character).
---
Try everything. Join a big block, then quit. Join a small corp, quit. Try faction warfare. Try wormholes. Don't limit yourself. Eventually you'll find something that appeals to you. For me personally I enjoy the big null block lifestyle, especially pvp mining fleets, abyssals, and the industry game. I spent a ton of time and effort into wormholes and exploration and realized I don't enjoy it.
---
You may have entirely different preferences. But you'll never know if you don't try.
---
I'd rather try have drifters come in and destroy the gates, put up cyno jammers, and anchor some kind of wormhole stabilization device that block some incoming wormholes. Let them basically take unused systems out of EVE and compact New Eden a little bit.
---
You did a highsec. You did a farming. You did a mining. You did a log off. You did a krabbing. You did no growth. This makes it abundantly clear you don't even understand the intersectional nature of the multiplicity of your offenses.
---
I disagree.
---
I hate flying subcaps in most scenarios. I'm not the most skilled, I'm not the greatest pilot but I feel at home in capitals. I don't need to maneuver too much, I have decent fighter control and I jumping in and out is very much my idea of a sci fi game. I hate taking gates. 
---
I can certainly fly almost all subcaps after 12?ish years of Eve. But I choose not to in most cases.
---
And I remember all the moves I've done post fatigue. Losing a 300m killmark leaves a bad taste. I can understand restricting maybe to just cruiser class. I can understand restricting to subcaps. But only 4 usable subcaps for capital movement is bad. I know edge cases may use blops but I sincerely doubt people will use a 2b 10 min 0 velocity cyno to move things unless stupid rich or just stupid.
---
There's no flexibility, and assuming all capital pilots are filthy rich is dumb. I've done the isk grind enough. I don't care to do it any more. I have 3.5b liquid to my name and that's probably the most I'll have. I could buy 12 cyno ships at 300m and get nothing back when they die. That's fine to get nothing back but I don't see why we can't have all cruisers or just T1. Leaves some question as to whether or not you're fighting a cyno when you face a cruiser. Leave at least a bit of mystery and danger to it...CCP please.
---
Because this sub is full of halfwits.
---
Merlin is excellent choice for FW piracy or plexing novices.
---
&gt; There is absolutely no mechanic you can introduce into the game to do so. The blocs have the money and manpower to adapt far more easily to anything you throw at them.
---
You can make it so that adding manpower to projects makes it less efficient.
---
&gt;Reduce anoms? The blocs can take more space. Meanwhile a small corp trying to live in a constellation now needs a region and can't take it.
---
The blocs are the shape that they are because they need huge buffer zones to protect their ratters from being dropped on immediately. They cannot simply "take more space" and make efficient use of it as a result of this. 
---
&gt;15 rorqs in one anom with a handful of pre-positioned recons is a lot easier for the blocs.
---
If the ore anom didn't respawn instantly and you could deplete it this would not happen.
---
&gt;You are asking CCP to somehow nerf players working together. That's not possible.
---
It needs to happen.
---
&gt;Then you are cheering exactly the wrong things.
---
&gt;You need a higher-density null so that the blocs can leave space for others. You need a way for small groups to protect themselves, and no local + no cynos is the opposite.
---
Higher density null snuffs out diversity. No we don't need higher density null because PVE is not the only thing null is for.
---
&gt;Everything you are doing hurts everyone living in null, and the people least hurt by it are the blocs.
---
I am doing nothing and have advocated for no changes myself. I think that CCP needs to make more measured changes in the future to directly remove the power of capitals and null empires. And that we have been lucky so far that the changes that they have made at random have been good.

Also do you have an intellectual disability, or is English not your first language? If either of these is the case, just say so and I'll leave you be. You genuinely have a fundamental misunderstanding of "trolling", "triggering", and "salt". Chatting shit and being called an idiot isn't trolling. It triggers nobody, and it doesn't generate salt.
---
Thought there were only 5 my bad
---
1) balance? YES! is not it now just sabre, munins, eagle and jackdaw online? status of hyped entosis things? it is so fu boring warping contest, wars over moons ended, small entities has no reason to attack any region, there is even NOT any option to raid enemy space. Siphons are dead, ESS are so secured in anomalies, expensive ratting gilas, rattlesnakes not anymore, reason for undock is umbrella or just r64 moon. FW is dead and market is flooded with their item which noone use anymore. How long ago did you see flying anyone in omen navy fleet, caracal navy or so... fleet fights are just kite &amp; voley and ADC contest.   low sec and FW players calling years for some changes and they got nothing...
---
2) they do not have  
---
3) skill trading is pure P2W because you have no limits, they got pretty good $ from it and now they need push ppl skill recon alts and so...
---
4) yes and as you can see they stop playing because bad changes  
---
5) no it is just try to ride a dead horse  
---
6) point is that when you have no ideas what to do with the game make event and killing one npc or so is not forcing ppl to undock or active play
---
Probably. Tho likely in a similar way parents *consult* their 2 year olds before making dinner plans.
---
caldari ships are boring also everyone in lowsec fits dual web to their 4 midslot ships which makes them even more boring
---
anyway suitonia has a max tank/dps fit which he frags dictors with, look up the all in merlin
---
why tf is this at +23 in less than 1 minute?
---
&gt; You can make it so that adding manpower to projects makes it less efficient.
---
....so they just do the same thing with fewer people?  Seriously, have you spent more thinking about this than "Grr blocs! Hate blocs!"
---
&gt; The blocs are the shape that they are because they need huge buffer zones to protect their ratters from being dropped on immediately. 
---
Hi, I'm from TEST.  We krab in jump range of Stain.
---
&gt; If the ore anom didn't respawn instantly and you could deplete it this would not happen.
---
If there was only one ore anom.

Guess what?  It's a bloc.  They own at least one region.

&gt; It needs to happen.

Since it's not possible, what's your plan for when it doesn't happen?

&gt; Higher density null snuffs out diversity. No we don't need higher density null because PVE is not the only thing null is for.
---
Higher density is the only reason there are parts of null not owned by a bloc.
---
Goons could easily super-umbrella three regions.  They're only doing it in one, leaving two other regions for someone else.  The other blocs could similarly cover a lot more space.
---
You make the blocs spread out, then they'll spread out.  And there will be even less space for anyone else.
---
&gt; And that we have been lucky so far that the changes that they have made at random have been good.
---
You sound like the people who cheered the introduction of SBUs and that iteration of sov mechanics.  "This will totally stop the big blocs from dominating sov warfare like they did with POSes!".  Didn't work out that way at all.  Because the blocs could best adapt and blob the hell out of the grid.
---
Then we got Fozziesov.  "this will totally stop the big blocs from dominating sov warfare like they did with SBUs!".  Didn't work out that way at all.  Because the blocs could best adapt and run a hell of a lot of toasters at the same time.
---
Now, you're saying "This will totally stop the big blocs from dominating sov".
---
Guess how this is going to work out?
---
I got no idea but i'm along for the ride
---
More like dreads, but yeah.
---
Exactly. People who only enjoy tiny ships and cloaky cancer seem to view the game with blinkers on.
---
&gt;Someone uses a cap for PvP and kills them and their cloaky buddies
---
Waaah it's so broken it killed my Loki they shouldn't be allowed to use it like that nerf it CCPls
---
&gt;Someone uses a cap to rat and minds their own damn business
---
Waaah it's so broken it gets better ticks than my Loki they're using it wrong nerf it CCPls
---
Nah. Pretty much outside of fw is either dead or the locals will drop supers to kill anything that remotely looks threatening.
---
#BECAUSE YOU TOUCH YOURSELF AT NIGHT
---
what a tdsin comment
---
Yes.  You can no longer light a reliable cyno near hostile dreads.
---
Jumping to that cyno means half your cap fleet is likely to end up in the sun.
---
Sorry man I was just testing my bot on newer posts ;)
---
Have you ever done said training and buying of a super?
---
You said most of what i was going to. Except the bit about crying that 2 year old character cant just afk 4 vni alts to suppprt pvp via isk...
---
What a load of horse shit. Get wreckt.
---
Wat
---
Nah, can't test every route reliably.  Shit will still break, just weirdly.
---
What in the south?
---
Y'all need Bob. Go make the offerings.
---
Lowsec won't be as populated as long as it is npc owned. Look at NPC null. The only way you can get a population is by making it profitable, but while NPC stations are open to anyone, anyone can stage in the system your group claims to reside in making it more "dangerous" than null.
---
The only thing I can think of is to close off 75% of the existing NPC stations to anyone outside of FW. This gives people using lowesec as it's intended some sort of "safety" from non FW groups reigning on their parade.
---
FW stations can be conquered be each faction of course, creating a sort of so war. Just like systems can be conquered currently.
---
The only thing remaining would be citadels, though I imagine FW groups would steadily begin to chew away at those.
---
In the end nothing will stop larger groups from dropping open citadels making all of those changes null and void and the smaller fw groups wouldnt be able to do much about it.
---
You could maaaayyybe expand from that and limit citadel anchoring I'm fw space to groups on faction warfare but as it's an NPC group nothing stops a major alliance from putting an alt Corp in and doing the same.
---
Mostly thinking out loud at this point, feel free to critique.
---
I prefer capital pvp myself, though primarily cap vs cap if i had to choose. 
---
But we've had years of cap dominance. I can live with more subcap focus going forward.
---
StainGuy finally posts a good and reasonable post...3 years after many people have said all this stuff.
---
U mAd Bro?
---
Nice.
---
That’s about all I could gather. Wtf is the point of this so called “post”.
---
Quitting
---
Lol what fleet stays perfectly still when they have a capital tackled in hostile territory? Also, how do you even know where the recon is coming in from? Maybe they have pings on grid? Maybe the capital tells them where to warp from?
---
also, on the off chance your post ain't bait 
---
yes, blackout still going
---
no, we dont know how long it will stay 
---
yes, you should resub
---
The point is, the recon will bounce off a celestial, it won’t warp straight from the beacon/gate to the rorq. So you won’t know where it will land. Then it’ll slowboat into position while Panic is up and light. 
---
And good luck breaking a brick tank recon that just had several FAXes land on top of it.
---
Best war I've ever fought, I hope it keeps going!
---
I'm so sick of the entire conversation being about ratting supers and kneejerk reactions.
---
I'm much more interested in how this affects large fights.  I'm trying to imagine a capital fleet *warping* into a hostile grid.
---
but here you are on the eve subreddit. answering to new posts 2mins after they went up...
---
Where is the copy and paste from this time. Coz that's all you seem to post.
---
That's it I'm quitting again.
---
fucking lol indeed
---
Exactly, fun
---
Nah it wasn't bait, thanks for the info I think I will. Just haven't been paying attention to EVE news recently and I saw that and it got me interested
---
A second account does indeed cost more. But to put it perspective. If you cant manage a second account with ease then getting a cap on that first account isn’t wise. But thats just the i see it.
---
&gt;Lol what fleet stays perfectly still when they have a capital tackled in hostile territory?
---
You don't need the entire fleet in the bubble.  Also, your biggest threat now is caps pouring out of a cyno.  So you move to help mitigate that.   After this change, your biggest threat is a cloaked recon lighting a cyno.  So you're going to act to prevent that.
---
&gt;Also, how do you even know where the recon is coming in from?
---
There's not a whole lot of vectors to come from.  Especially when you're talking about an anomaly that will be dead faster than you could have an alt make pings.
---
just ONE more time!
---
One of the best times in eve for me was when Brave started out and they decided to stage out of Sendaya :\] man o man was that fucking awesome everyone constantly came for action they didn't care about isk efficiency or dying they just wanted to blow shit up and that's the type of mentality that makes eve amazing. I think back then you had more fights in a day than we get in a week now.
---
Low sec was decent in a black rise a little while ago when it was very profitable for caldari just getting into T5 and they fought hard for that income they gave tons of fight's to us the gallentians but now, that the lp worth has dropped off hard they barely care about fighting they have nothing left to fight for so they just farm and avoid fight's when they are not out numbering their opponent's.
---
Space in general needs to be more dangerous but also more rewarding.  I agree with you, people need more reason to come out of high sec. The thought needs to cross their mind that O! I only need to farm for 2 hours to get my ship cost back so you know its worth the risk.
---
same tbh
---
MORE SUPERCAP BOTS TO SLAUGHTER !
---
Im actually enjoying all the whining and complaining. 
---
[SP](https://tenor.com/tVUo.gif)
---
But the arguement people have been putting forth is that moving a cap is to cheap because it could be done with any ship when in reality the cost was any ship and a second account. That seems like a large enough cost to move a cap to me.
---
He appears to no longer be constipated.
---
&gt; The point is, the recon will bounce off a celestial, it won’t warp straight from the beacon/gate to the rorq. 
---
Anomalies spawn close to the same plane as the celestials.  Warping from a planet will still land you in the bubble.
---
&gt; And good luck breaking a brick tank recon that just had several FAXes land on top of it.
---
A "brick tank recon" has maybe 100k EHP.  By the time the faxes leave the warp tunnel, it's long since dead.....assuming those faxes manage to hit "jump" fast enough.
---
We're not talking about 6 people in T3Cs.  Those aren't a threat.  We're talking about 100+ bombers or hostile caps.
---
Yo this man spitting str8 facts lmBao
---
so relatable, going in my instagram bio
---
I'm willing to bet CCP ran this by the CSM.
---
Snuff mine all the moons so even if you're blue to blues of snuff you can't mine them :\], the little guys in low without massive capital power don't get moons.
---
pls just stfu
---
*Daft punk playing in the distance*
---
I wouldn't have thought of Eve's primary demographic as the type who can cook for themselves, but hey.
---
Yea ADC's are pretty fucking broken atm.
---
It’s a game wide tradition
---
Cool idea...but not the same. Feels a little hollow
---
6 months into Eve and I love the blackout. Caused a great deal of uncertainty. Having local there as a tool to instantly know of someone in the vacinity is unnatural and sorta breaks immersion.  I was in null for 3 months prior and much prefer no local. Space should not be safe and this makes it much more dangerous. Plus it helped kill off the bots.
---
As for the cyno changes I can't wait. I've been of the opinion that cynos were an awful mechanic since the first time I saw 2 supers drop on a frig and cruiser gang in npc null that had just gotten into hull on a bait geddon. Shit is a win button if you're not in a megacorp. Half of our small gang pvp fights seem to end this way. My only wish is that they would have added a long spool up time or cyno interdiction bubbles as well. People without cap access literally had no counter. It felt gamebreaking and really had me wondering if it was even worth it for a new player.
---
try that in rupees
---
It's not permanent (probably) but it is indefinite and since they're still adding more 'chaos' features, I guess it will be like that for at least a few months. Which is great.
---
Indeed. But thats the case when you use your second account ONLY for cynos. Which is one of many reasons why ccp is making this change. Now if you want to use your second account as a cyno you will need to skill it up into the required ships. 
---
Also, if you use your second account just like your first account then you can have two means of income instead of just one supporting both accounts. Why not use the other account as a fax? Or dictor scout? Or covert cyno tackle? The possibilities for a secondary account are endless. 
---
And yes. The way it is now its too cheap and easy to move my personal football team of caps. Although i would prefer seeing more options in cyno ships instead of the limited force recons and BLOPS. But if thats the way its going to be I already have a few solutions in mind and all will require teamwork with other players (which is the point of this game i believe).
---
Went on a short rant there but hey.. :)
---
NC...fastest runners in the East.
---
NULLSEC ANIME
---
I'd rather have roaming NPC fleets that stop people from perma camping gate's and remove gate guns permanently they stop tons of fights between small groups of players that happen to be on the gate at the same time, and these T3C with insta align time need to disappear too.
---
No
---
Its not about the manufacturing, its about the materials, that's what makes t2 shit expensive.
---
Thanks man. I actually messed up and forget the BLOPS when I posted it.
---
&gt;Wars where fought for the control of ressources, or ressources but when everybody can mine all ressources you dont need to invade irak for oil and other stuff right?
---
It should be noted we already have this.  There's moongoo you can only mine in the North, and moongoo you can only mine in the South.  There's also ice that's region-locked.
---
The problem is everyone needs every goo and every ice.  You can't mine in hostile space using refineries.  You can't conquer some space on the other side of the map to anchor refineries if you want to hold them.  So we all just trade in Jita.
---
Makes you wonder where the dev time is going.
---
They shot up in price on the day of the announcement but thats normal. They have already stabilized in price ranging between 400-500 mio. I doubt they will go any higher seeing they are being produced and sold like hot cakes atm. Supply will meet the demand and so the prices wont be so ridiculous.
---
I don't think there's too may people complaining that Delve is too empty....
---
Is it though?  This change is better than the spool idea.
---
Imagine I park 50 caps off your keepstar and spool up a cyno.  Now what do you do?  I have a cyno for instant reinforcements and you don't.
---
So what's special about it?
---
how is "you forgot the blops" condescending ?
---
i remember you from a comment section somewhere.
---
wormholer btw.
---
Oh look the daily suck Hilmar's dick post..... so cool I'm gonna resub 47 omega accounts and pay for them years in advance  THANKS CCP!
---
Dude just had surgery and is on drugs. Keef is a good dude and probably went for a yolo kill
---
Because that would require them to do actual work
---
A firework that looks like a cyno.
---
for just 110 plex you can remember your lost friends
---
&gt; NC. undocks
---
Wait...what?
---
Ahahaha! Praise Bob!
---
&gt;giving more value to subcap fleets
---
Some of us like caps more than subcaps.
---
There's two problems:
---
1) In a sandbox is every faction thinks they're playing the only correct way, and CCP must nerf everything that doesn't support that play.
---
2) It's not possible to nerf cooperation and coordination.
---
If they want true chaos, there is one more switch to turn off. 
---
ESI.
---
You make very valid points and pray hard that CCP has plans for low.
---
I think you meant blinders but yeah generally this
---
It's not about free kills it's about not being able to literally teleport from Jita to your citadel. That's not Eve, it's Space Farming Simulator.
---
it is unfair to the mentally disabled and autistic to compare them to C4 dwellers. they can be kind and wonderful people whom are a joy to be around and bring happiness to all around them. 
---
unlike C4 dwellers...
---
&gt;Until you have mechanics in place that encourage activity in space that isn't everyone in one area
---
You make the blocs spread out, then they'll spread out.
---
We need more groups in null, not fewer.
---
How often have you seen supers flying around killing command destroyers enotosising?
---
Which is especially nice when you want to step away for three months.  When you come back, you're not going to find that all your gear is now outdated and worthless.
---
This is EXACTLY how I feel. 6 months in. The bolded section in particular really rings true.
---
I'm positive it was generated by Olmeca and bombers
---
Don't think npcs get loss mails.
---
The sad part that /u/luckytiger1990 pointed out is that making that journey to the carrier straight away means that you're bypassing 95% of what is out there. If you wanted to go that route, that's great, but the fact that this is what you were just told to do is just disappointing. When I was brand new I lost ships doing some of the dumbest but funnest things. Never sat in a capital until two to three years in and then I lost that lol. 
---
Find your favorite thing to do and enjoy eve. If being in a null bloc makes it easier that's good, but sometimes the big null bloc can hinder you.
---
Wait are those the only ships than can use the link? Sorry as said just got back into eve and apparently command destroyers are a thing now.
---
b/c a bunch of Volta dudes and MAr5hy bomber f1 pushers have channels dedicated to immediately vote brigading shit
---
\#docked4life
---
So you’re saying providence is so dead people are warping to your keepstar at 0 in order to try and get a fight?
---
They are also probably using damage drugs and implants as well as rate of fire implants.
---
How about you just vigil with small smartbombs?
---
Bait is obvious
---
Can confirm when the kiki gets going with baryon, it can shoot straight through those pesky shields.
---
Oh, most definitely not saying I like cap v sub as much as cap v cap.
---
Incentivizing those kinds of fights would cause me to want to play EvE again.
---
But this feels like it doesn't and it really screws escalation.
---
whoa whoa not everything died - had it been them everybody's ship would explode as they flawless cruised forward untouched from their extreme levels of godlike pvp skill
---
No, there have been changes that mostly help the little guy.  Picking a few examples:
---
Only being able to slave 50 drones to one pilot.  A small 10-20 man gang, they still get really solid dps, but you don't have the problem of 1250 drones slaved to one guy and alphaing him off the field.
---
Jump fatigue, is mostly evenly spread across play styles.
---
Citadels are the same.  They are cheap enough and hard enough to kill that they can be spammed pretty effectively.
---
You didn't go to ENE this year so idk dude
---
"Cynos are balanced because they require two separate characters" Really? Or is this just a "special case" because you gotta pay for both accounts? Ever thought of trying to operate a capital on a single account, and instead asking friends or corp mates to light the cyno for you?
---
What? Don't trust them? Don't trust your corp or your friends not to awox you? Then why the hell are you in it? Is it because they're not online and able to help you at every moment you'd like them to?
---
I understand the idea of having to sub two accounts to move a capital around may seem like a steep investment, but it's the price you pay to get the job done on your own. It's the price we all pay, not only to get that job done, but to also use those alts for various other things.
---
There's a reason cynos exist in the first place; if CCP wanted it to be a one person job, they'd just let you jump whenever, wherever. We adapted and made fucktons of cheap cyno alts for ones self, and as we are seeing, we grew rather complacent with that way of life.
---
Shhhhhhh
---
why are we comparing incomplete half months i dont understand, but lets play if you divide 133k with 16 days of august and get a per day quota and then multiply by 31 you get 259k in this august thats 10k less than last august where the whole north was getting raided by goons, not bad eh?   
---
faction kills being down means less rats die not less people rat, cause 1) bots are dead and the number isnt inflated anymore 2) people dont rat that much with supers unless under umbrella. win-win
---
this series of Q &amp; A is totally not scripted
---
There are only two forms  \*it's\* - meaning  it is, and \*its\* - meaning  of or belonging to it. The possessive form does not have an apostrophe.
---
I can confirm the scouts do not warp scram. However, they do steal power from your capacitor.
---
This is a new version of this meme
---
I almost forgot to switch my accounts between posts. Would have been pretty embarrassing!!!
---
For the love of all that is holy please dont give them anymore ideas like this
---
They've attacked me in several high sec systems within 15-20 minutes of me being there. They've even killed me once while I was at the keyboard.
---
Shut up hilmar
---
Scamming not reliable income, unless you like handing out your secret methods to newbros. And even then, scamming is not consistent isk in 90% of cases, even if in the long haul it’s pretty good.
---
Abyssal sites aren’t bad, although the value on those is likely to crash and T4/T5, where most of the income is, generally requires good or very good skills.
---
Importing requires a large pile of ISK to start with, or it isn’t good income. 
---
Wormhole day-tripping isn’t very reliable if you are looking for combat sites, and if you’re scanning then you run into the same problem listed in my original post
---
Ah yes. The supercap umbrella of delve which drops on any atron that moves is exactly like flying a 4B ship which requires 6 months of skills knowing that your incursion group gets ganked every week and you have to go through .5 sec systems every 4 days.
---
They could turn off the servers intermittedly
---
No, 40-50m/hour doing an activity that is active rather than passive is pretty bad. That’s why highsec is low risk, low reward in most* cases.
---
can confirm, Keef is good people
---
Honestly I haven't played for a very long time and am not up to date with how invasive bots have become, so creating a bucket that measures assets that are "protected" from them isn't something I would be able to do.
---
Anyways, I think it makes more sense to measure inflation/deflation via Plex, since it's one of the only things in the game that is hard-locked to a token that is relatively stable (USD). Measuring with a CPI made of in-game objects such as ships and the like doesn't seem to be a very stable or reliable indicator, considering changes in the meta and the game's economy balance can throw it very much out of wack.
---
Hi SerQwaez,
---
I disagree with all of your statements.
---
yo I just had a question no need to reee
---
It's a scene from the 'Chernobyl' HBO series where Boris Shcherbina looses his temper at his superiors for lying about the extent of the radiation leaking from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
---
What we need: More groups in null.
---
What you need to accomplish this:
---
* Big blocs must be able to live in a relatively compact space (eg. Delve).  Otherwise there's just no room for a small bloc.
---
* The small groups must be able to support themselves (can't nerf anoms based on what the blocs can do in them)
---
* The small groups must be able to defend themselves from roams (no local and no cynos kills this)
---
* The big alliances have to have a reason to not take vast swaths of space (rental programs as income streams need to shrink or die)
---
* Logistics (space trucking) for the small groups must be doable by one or a very small number of people (just get 5 recon alts to JF to Jita! isn't a solution)
---
TL:DR - you have to make it *easier* to live in null if you want more people, and thus more conflict, in null.  If you make it hard, then everyone who wants to live in null just joins a bloc because the blocs have the resources and manpower to handle it.
---
They'll light up a combat scan like a firework.
---
Even if that second account is a friend that still means the requirements of moving a cap via cyno is a second account.
---
Your entire second line is stupid because I never once said I don't have friends help but now CCP is making it harder for friends to help, because not everyone has recons or blackops trained. The people who routinely fly these ships received no nerf and shocker this are people who run around ganking (hint this isn't actually pvp they only want killmails not fights)
---
And yes the second account is the price we pay, that was literally my point. People in these threads act like the only cost of the cyno is a cheap throw away ship completely ignoring the second account cost.
---
If ccp doesn't want players to move themselves then ban multiboxing. They would never do that because that would cost them to much money. We adapted and paid them hundreds of dollars more every year for the right to move our capitals around on our own and now that CCP has collected that money and we are complacent they want to make it harder. At a bonus this is an attempt to manipulate injector prices because every cyno account now needs a full injector of extra training.
---
wormholer btw
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6pomaq30Gg
---
It's a UK/AU English vs US English thing.
---
On lots of Lorazepam and seemed like a good idea at the time... even though I've heard they are quick gunning that Keepstar before.  Also didn't think they could point me that far :D
---
Those kinds of players may be bad for the game overall, but they’re very good for CCP’s revenue :^)
---
Pretty much. I didn’t propose lowsec changes because I am in no way the subject expert, but FW folks have been highlighting the same things for years and years
---
If only more brave fed us tonight
---
Neither do I, and I *still* can't understand what he's getting at other than "MINERS GOOD! WORMIES BAD!"
---
And I probably misunderstood even that.
---
If you have a capital ship them you probably have an alt.
---
If you don't have an alt, then you aren't being forced to get one.
---
So what exactly are you whining about now? LMAO
---
I too am a bitterly cynical skeptic but it's a decent idea, imo.
---
110 plex is a bargain when you consider the billions in recon ships lost trying to get your caps to the service
---
Null has been dead since 2016. The corpse has just been twitching for the past three years.
---
Slagging off the English skills of players who are primarily non English. Mmmhmm.
---
With max skills, ~3mil less per tick for me
---
A buddy of mine, IrishSin, and myself took on two rattlesnakes, a thorax, and three other ships... one was a drake I think (lol) running missions in our two Ishkurs... we go suspect of course theyll win a 2v5, right?  Nope.  Dunked all of them and snatched 3 pods.  
---
I will never forget that fight.  Such good times.  Miss you bro...come back to Eve!
---
Well, for starters a "......" at the end of a statement is to indicate the statement is made as if looking at you in disbelief or as if they are dumbfounded. It's generally used to highlight what they feel is ignorance. 
---
The second statement  " Thanks in the name of less confusion ! " was a sarcastic jab at me for "correcting" misinformation when my post itself was not completely correct due to a mistaken omission on my part. 
---
The entire exchange was a passive aggressive attempt to attack me for making a mistake in my post .
---
It's not our fault, until 1066 everyone and their dog had a shot at us. They left some of their lingo behind.
---
Ah, so thats why my EVEmon keeps complaining.
---
How many VNI's did you lose?
---
How much isk did you make via those VNI's?
---
NS is high risk? lol
---
That's a lot of dead AFKers.       
---
And a lot of salt.
---
Been out of the loop for a bit, but i guess RIP to the cynoibis?
---
Can’t be bothered to read your wall of text but just to reply to your first point; he didn’t say it prevents death. He simply said he doesn’t have to *worry* about dying. I.e. He has plex and therefore isk to replace any losses.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I'm not exactly approaching this with the mentality that CCP is doing this simply to further it's bottom line. I'm looking at the problems with the game; and one of those glaring problems is the ease of use for capital ships.
---
And it's happening *again*, this time in BRAVE!
---
It’s not my gameplay anymore. I make my isk different ways now. The concept is that new players need an are of space where they can get an introduction to pvp and start making reasonable amounts of isk (100-120m/hr). Nullsec no longer has that ability, and I would like to see CCP step up to the plate and breathe some life into lowsec for these players.
---
Also, my jag fit was a solo fit. Very similar to tomalak’s, with a modification to avoid needing implants. Got any other dumb assumptions to make today?
---
All beacons are camped
---
Nullsec, with blackout and cyno changes in place, will be high risk. Which is fine.
---
These "golly gee wiz im a returning player but i heard these changes are happening so im gonna resub posts" that get brigaded up are very obvious.
---
Obvious bait is obvious
---
There was also a time we infiltrated a RL family-run Corp that took pride in flying max bling battleships, marauders etc. So we get comfy with them and stoke them into going all out and running missions... we drop a warded and let it sit quiet for ~5d... on day 6 we hype up the pack of attention and get them to undock their pride and joy fleet of super silly shiny shit.  Of course we had a fleet on their out gate... killed all of them, they stopped playing after that unfortunately but wow man... the tears were next level.  
---
Uncles crying, sons yelling, a silent dad and one laughing mom in the background.  Loot fairy was a whore but the memory lives on.
---
Your first example sure..... but that’s a very small/specific example really only applicable to like... 3 fleet comps. The other two qualify to my above statement. Jump fatigue.... yeah it’s nice that blob #3 can’t come from other end of eden to third party. But small groups also have limited cap pilots therefore easier for larger group to overcome limits. Citadels are easy for anyone to spam.... and large groups have deeper pockets so.... doesn’t necessarily help small groups. Not even crappy timers, easier for a large group to form out of prime time than a small group. 
---
The point was just that no matter the change, larger groups will almost always be able to mitigate any negatives easier than small. So making that argument every time you don’t like something doesn’t really hold too much water.
---
Thanks for the salt.
---
Lmao. Let's do it
---
My question: If you understand that EVE is all about PvP, why would you wish to stay around?
---
it should be noted that this means jump freighters can now jump into cyno jammed systems, which is actually going to be really helpful for attackers.
---
Or just dump their corpse, or any corpse, or spiced wine and strippers at Eve Gate and call it good
---
This is so beautiful I'm crying
---
Well empires can bet bigger than they are now. Otherwise just defend one region indefinitely or unsub. I guess thats all there is.
---
You are implying the balance is the cost of the ship and I am saying you are forgetting the much larger cost of a monthly subscription. Requiring an alt to move the capital is a huge cost and I don't see the need to make it cost more.
---
We have 32 core consumer cpus. It's doable
---

---
If CCP had come and said no cynos on capitals you would see significantly less people upset with this, but also would have stopped supers and rorquals from summoning save fleets instantly. I don't disagree there needed to be a change but I think CCP went way overboard on this.
---
And yes I do think CCP concluded that this will affect the injector market and to them that is a net benefit to this change. Every change they make is with their bottom line in mind.
---
You did brush over the part the only group that isn't inherenelty hurt by this is the group that already runs cloaked fleets to gank targets. They actually received a buff to this because now they get to invisibly choose their targets and that target has no recourse now. It wasn't general PVPers who wanted to brawl that received the biggest buff it was these individuals who are ironically more risk averse than your average ratted.
---
Can we get a TL;DR up in this bitch?
---
How many freighters does INIT. need for an average C4? =)
---
So how much $ did you sink into EVE just to be "competitive" whatever that means in a multiplayer sandbox?
---
I get what you are saying, but I find it highly problematic. You are obviously giving CCP a lot more money to play their simple game than say a regular player so I see how they might be inclined to tap that wallet and enable you to give them more money for the increase of a number in some database.
---
But I find this highly problematic. In my opinion the wealth and level of your character should always be acquired trough gameplay. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but sidetracking the normal gameplay and just purchasing game progress with whatever means, including $, is in my books cheating.
---
Just to be clear, I don't think that even works as the sandbox has some extremely mitigating effect on what you can do with those "cheated" resources. In my opinion, and that is how I would feel about it, you are destroying your own gameplay and even pay for it. You may look at it differently.
---
I would love a game where this is absolutely not possible and the ingame wealth and level would reflect the actual achievement of the player. I think offering the option to "cheat" in this way is harming and diluting the game at its very core.
---
yes?
---
Yes let's not do any testing whatsoever because some bugs will slip through.
---
I wonder how it feels to know some people claim to be elite at pvp, yet there's npcs with better boards.
---

Get out.
---
&gt; Well, empires can get bigger than they are now.
---
then players whined like fuck and we ended up with changes resulting in the situation we have now where...
---
&gt;Otherwise just defend one region indefinitely
---
this is what was asked for, this is what was delivered, now the same people are whining about it.
---
Oh right the free kills are just the bonus.

Most people on reddit are American, they claim to speak English but they're aren't English. So I'd agree with that.
---
Because someone saying "Blackout good" is like earning a sticker if you're a pvp player. They love stickers.
---
I don't think the Hecate can fit a covert cyno.
---
It doesn't but it's still dank
---
Yeah it was cool, I was hoping the rest of fleet would warp to you
---
Those SP come from farms that would not exist if there was no extractor. Where do you think they would come from otherwise? The "excess" SP from vets was probably burned withing the first months of going live with extractors.
---
No, it is not as easy to compare this with the Bazaar as you always try to. the extractor/injector is a completely different mechanic and had completely different effects on EVE.
---
To prove guys like you wrong. Please submit downvotes so my fuel stockpiles can get replenished.

Appreciate they said mandatory implying currently. They may be older, I left secondary in 95 and a second language was compulsory at GSCE at my school.
---
Don't kink shame.
---
Touche.
---
You know PL is a spent force when Provi has keeps.
---
Dude, cynos are getting nerfed tooooo!!!
---
What I have seen from this is normally you cyno in with something small first, bring in a fax carrier or super that then lights the hard cyno. Aeon tends to be the hardest of cyno options. Apostle and Archon are also popular options. That is then used for the actual bulk of the fleet to come through on, possibly multiple ones are used to avoid too much bumping with a large number.   
---
But yeah, i feel the fax changes already + this will likely mean no more large scale capital/supercapital battles since you can pretty much make sure your enemy can't get on grid where they want to be.
---
yes they would exist - people used to just 'grow' characters to sell on the bazzaar all the time.
---
&gt;No, it is not as easy to compare this with the Bazaar as you always try to. 
---
yes it is, it's literally the same thing but less obtuse.
---
leshaks cant do 4k dps
---
npc buy orders also include ded overseer effects and triglavian databases, both pretty high volume, probably more shit i don't know about but lets ignore that for now. While i don't disagree that it wouldn't be weird for an entire area of space to outprint one region in null, i dunno, and guess i never will given the breakdown isn't available i guess
---
DEUS VULT!
---
Most NPC do not generate loss mails.  
---
If they did, most of us would have very green killboards, filled with anomaly NPC, incursion NPC, missions NPC, etc.

Cynos cant hurt you bby, dont worry

so dumb
---
That's, actually not at all what I was suggesting, and you're now really starting to sound like an upset newbro who's been ganked one too many times in their past, trying to pin this change as a nefarious motive on behalf of CCP wanting more money. 
---
What I am a saying is this change made to cynos, is a good one because it forces the person operating their jump drive to actually commit a measurable sum of isk on field to activate said jump drive. If you don't have the isk to do it, then thats a personal problem. I truly am so sorry that you've come to embrace complacency with meeting bare minimum requirements.

Boson works in my experience. Get gud m8 I'm 2 3elite.

dodging lances is pretty easy in non battleship subcaps tbh

Lowsec isn't even broken.

It's awesome.
---
You repeat that line since CCP used it to convince everyone that this non-vanity item is just fine and will change nothing.
---
Are you blind? Injectors had a HUGE influence on the game and they where not a simple replacement of the Bazaar. How can you STILL not see that?
---
What's with all this salt against C4 space!?
---
I fucking love C4's even tho I don't live in them. Fuck anyone that says otherwise. Who wants to live in a wh with a single wh statics?
---
I bet you can figure out how to move without losing recons. If you can't, I'll teach you.
---
Yeah i wasn't worried about the hulk. Been away from the game a bit and I was trying to remember how nasty Orca drone damage was.

Wh loot is not completely farmable like null anoms are. Null anoms keep spawning pretty much as fast as you kill them.
---
Y-you're... You're not wrong.
---
Again with the "requiring an alt" lol
---
Imma write this s l o w l y so you can get it;
---
If you have a capital ship, then you already have an alt regardless of these changes. 
---
If you don't have an alt, then you use friends.
---
The cyno changes do not force you to sub any account. Therefore the only additional cost is a 300m ship.
---
*Shrug* I can only bring a horse to water...
---
Maximum good post
---
you're starting to get weird now, please stop sexually harrassing me on reddit tia
---
Go back to rorq mining dinobrain. No one cares about your once a year capital brawls that have such bad lag half your fleet members died to seizures.
---
You seem to also be missing it. The cost of a second account no matter who it is, needs to be factored into the cost of moving the capital. Implying that only cost anyone ever experienced was the cost of a cheap cyno ship is wrong. Someone is paying the cost of a second account. I am saying that cost alone was already a sufficient barrier and that increasing the cost more was not needed.
---
You are right I can only bring a horse to water but you refuse to acknowledge that the second account is still a cost.
---
&gt; ....so they just do the same thing with fewer people? Seriously, have you spent more thinking about this than "Grr blocs! Hate blocs!"
---
And then fewer people need to be in the bloc. And smaller entities can reach the threshold more easily. Yes i did think about this more than just "grr blocs" but you didn't because "grr non blocs."
---
&gt;Hi, I'm from TEST. We krab in jump range of Stain.
---
You put Brave in the broadest Stain facing part of Catch to act as a buffer. The littlest tail end of Eso being barely in drop range of a couple of systems in Stain is not the same thing.
---
&gt;Edit: Oh, and ore anoms already don't respawn instantly.
---
Oh boohoo you have to wait 5 minutes for the new one poor little guy.
---
&gt;Goons could easily super-umbrella three regions. They're only doing it in one, leaving two other regions for someone else. The other blocs could similarly cover a lot more space.
---
No they don't. Maybe you could remind me who owns the neighboring systems. And the entrances and exits to Delve. They are not going to suffer a goonswarm hostile entity moving into that buffer zone.
---
&gt;You make the blocs spread out, then they'll spread out. And there will be even less space for anyone else.
---
If they are spread out and can't project their full force across that distance their grasp on power weakens. People will be able to beat them back.
---
&gt;You sound like the people who cheered the introduction of SBUs and that iteration of sov mechanics. "This will totally stop the big blocs from dominating sov warfare like they did with POSes!". Didn't work out that way at all. Because the blocs could best adapt and blob the hell out of the grid.
---
Nothing that makes it harder to take sov is a good thing. It only serves to entrench the major groups.
---
&gt;Now, you're saying "This will totally stop the big blocs from dominating sov".
---
You know what makes it harder for the big blocks to dominate sov? Making it so that they can't just instantly teleport themselves to any engagement in their space. The only good change was the introduction of jump fatigue. 
---
And imo the only direction from here is the removal of supers.
---
I tried taking on 3 recons with two support, tangling and blinding, kicked my ass, I just was able to warp away.
---
us-what?
---
I've killed a dozen Recon Damaviks but they don't generate lossmails.
---
Not my feelings at all, and I resubbed 4 accounts for them. Be wary of the echo chamber in this subreddit.
---
&gt;Newbros making 100m an hour
---
Why even have isk? Let's just make Eve a true sandbox where you can create your own titan with console commands. Actually wtf why even play on tq where some form of progression exists we can play on the test server like real Chads.
---
I have been playing eve since 2004 so I can safely tell you have I have not been ganked one to many times so lets leave off the personal attacks.
---
The risk was already there, once you brought the capital in you were risking that. The cost already existed as well in the form of a second account. Its not complacency, I am saying this change way over shot being reasonable and only buffed one specific play style, which seems to be CCPs only regard recently. 
---
Drifters attack nullsec empires
---
Nerf local to make it easier to attack nullsec empries
---
Nerf cynos to make it harder for nullsec empires to defend.
---
Based on CCPs comments I can pretty clearly predict their next move would be to a nerf asset safety (despite their own comments on how this would basically kill any returning players).
---
These are all things that make living in nullsec harder and make griefing nullsec players easier. These people roam in covert ops arent looking for PVP, they want free kills and will never fight anything that can beat them. That is what this change has caused, more soft targets.
---
Yeah but it's best to find changes that aren't much easier for a large group to manage then a smaller one.
---
I don't like the blackout, but I'm not going to use the size-scaling on that.  That probably actually impacts large blobs more then small groups.  I don't use it as an excuse for everything, just bad changes like this one.
---
TBQH, it probably won't impact me too much.  I just participate in the blob.  I don't light the cynos, leadership does that.  I'm just a F1 monkey.  I don't rat nor mine often.
---
which bit of "but less obtuse" didn't you understand?
---
More groups in null lol. You exactly know what will happen. They will blue everyone around and with the others they have nips and naps and no shooty shooty.
---
As long as people don't want to lose the little online power they have they will never try to go to war as they could lose it.
---
Sure. But this isn’t a mystical land of wishful thinking. And you can totally think this change is bad. I think it’s awesome and can’t wait.
---
Some are, some aren't. I'm not.
---
Most aren't I'd wager.
---
Read your contracts, also, why isn’t PleX traded via contract to avoid taxes?

There are not a lot of non scam contracts up vs the amount on the market.

Introduce resource depletion and rotation of R64's
