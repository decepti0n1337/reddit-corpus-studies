OP flies a Cruror.

Technically the best they can do with the current system is waste ammo and abandon the fighters to scoop, but it's still potential to grief.
---
Sadly, I think you are right. Maybe there will be something specific mentioned elsewhere at a panel or whatever, but I doubt that too.
---
Ohh my bad, thought it's what you were looking for.
---
I dont see any issue with asking for ISK or money donations to help support someone who's application is invaluable to the greater community.
---
Listen to black metal while going through it :)
---
I'm ok with zkill shutdown tbqh
---
Specifically:
---

---
&gt;Publishes private communications from CCP their agents or &gt;representatives, including members of the EVE volunteer program, within &gt;the game world, official web site, or other venues without authorization.
---
Results in a ban
---
The big downside would be its DPS since its range is moderate and its damage type is locked.
---
Of course the drones do better, its a drone ship primarily. But using both, now theres the good shit. Ive never seen a gila fit with heavies or hams, ever, only rapids.
---
are you referring to async? async isn't really concurrency it's just better using a thread. python is still GIL limited.
---
HIV positive
---
at least its not from animu
---
So either you're selling them ore at or above market price, in which case they're better off buying on the market, or you're selling below market price in which case you're making shit ISK and nobody is going to want to join you.
---
Actually I pay my guys market price for the ores they bring in I'm not looking to make huge profits with this as yet as we are now getting started but I cover all my cost with trading to supplement
---
srs
---
So your business model is entirely unsustainable.
---
Even then you need to countercheck, inbefore some ships have kinky names, the damsel in distress is suddenly victim of an "unwanted sexual group-activity" in som elanguage and so on. And if you gotta get a translator to check everything anyways you can have those do the translations from teh start.
---
Just put a little tiny one and then when they lose a ship I think you get a notification so you can email them an annoying little "haha". 
---
Not really worth much though.
---
Nah.
---
No sir the corp itself still profits and we are not running negative. I have many ways of funding this corp and the ores are being bought at market price because I'm helping out new players get on their feet and get them closer to an orca.
---
Lots of males play female characters.
---
Take two famous examples: On one end of the spectrum, the head of Pandemic Legion is Elise Randolph. On the complete opposite end of the carebear spectrum, you have Katia Sae of Signal Cartel. He was the first person to visit every single system without losing a ship.
---
I mean having been in null blocs my biggest problem was honestly I hate making friends in big groups, so I moved on from that to smaller groups where I do make friends and get to know the voices on coms.
---
Eve does have this sorta problem where the smaller the fleet makes the game harder as your decisions matter a lot more, forget to place reps in a 200 man fleet because your busy fixing your overview or w/e nobody will notice do it in a smaller fleet with like 2/3 logi's and people will just die because you failed to rep them.
---
Nope, for me half-naked girl just visually better than half-naked guy.

Yet I don't get it, why it cringe af?

It didn't drop.   R.I.P.
---
All would definitely improve FW, I assume you’d be able to dock in the FOB?
---
My argument is that the *training* component of sp, which has always been grind free and disconnected from time spent doing menial tasks in the game, would now be affected by your ability to spend more hours clicking buttons and that this would be a bad thing.
---
Gotta be honest, it's been years since I really played. I attempted a comeback with all the salty Black Out drama making news, but my little gamer heart just doesn't have room for EVE anymore.
---
Eve players will be the death of eve, not CCP

No, you go criminal and get concorded.  Ask me how I know. :)

That's kind of the point of the alpha concept. Give them a taste for free, and dangle the good shit just behind the sub prize. If they gave it all away for free, they'd be screwing themselves.

If people are so risk averse they want to stage in areas away from the best truesec and in systems without ihub upgrades, then they can pay the price in reduced efficiency.
---
We shouldn't be designing the game around nullsec being a zero risk environment.
---
Yeah and make null safer.
---
Fun Fact: NPC stations in null is used as a staging by opposing alliances to drop on krabs and is incredibly useful in sov-warfare. Removing them will only give more krab space to mega-alliances.
---
Ok retard
---
If the skill for kills wasn't RNG then maybe... but when they have the RNG-based skills for kills and you have people bragging they are getting 25,000 every day when 99.999% of the time you 10,000 it gets old quick.
---
Ahhh you don’t get it. Eve is the only game that you can play with lots of other people while everyone playing a few accounts. It’s not like eq where you would 5 box then never have to play with others
---
C4 degenerates brag about afk bash eve 2019
---
its a good video for content, theres no reason to add in a half-naked anything. if i really wanted to i could just go to xvideos or pornhub for that.
---
guy
---
You don't krab in your staging system anyways. People will just move all of their assets to npc stations and continue krabbing in good systems as usual.
---
&gt; or is this a theme park now?
---
the game has been stale since about 2014 or earlier, there really is no risk any more, you can mitigate it all away
---
I'm doing my part.
---
With the moon drill being the cheapest module in the game
---
dayz was my eve with zombies until it got ruined by BI.
---
The biggest headache you’ll have is not being able to mine it all.  Start with the shortest chucks.  An orca and 2-3 barge alts will do well.

ShitStainGuy

All gates in stain removed
---
I agree, in eve even with multiple accounts you want to play with others, it's true.
---
It's also true that I really had fun doing everything the game has to offer with only one account, I was in a mining corp that wanted to start pvp, then I understood everybody in my corp has multiple accounts and a lot of free time... I did some research on the subjects and talked with guys in my corp, and it's a fact that you can't be efficient without multiboxing, no matter how you look at it.
---
So when I had to make this choice between staying on the best mmorpg I ever played or saving time and money I chose to leave eve, but it was a hard decision.
---
Now I'm looking for another sandbox mmo as deep as eve but without this problem.
---
Just if you don't know, Dofus (a french wealthy mmorpg) had the same "issue" and they chose to open a one account server, which became the most populated one and allowed the game to offer the choice to players to either be your own team on a classic server or to play a single character in a fair environment on the one account server.
---
Sometimes the solution is not to show the truth but to offer another one.
---
Ever played SCUM? If not, you should look at it and if you pick it up, hmu and come play it with a friendly stranger.
---
The major change that seem most necessary are to give pilots, or corps, *per station* trading slots.  
---
For an isk sink, rent could be charged per set of slots, per station, rather than some skillpoint based tomfoolery.  
---
It doesn't matter how many slots are given to players or corps, they are going to use them where they do the most good, which will be a main hub.  If you want players to naturally be active in different parts of space, and make them habitable, they have to be set free of perverse incentive.
---
Not to be a dick, but why pay for the cow when you get the milk for free?    
---
It's high sec, just go mine it when it pops.  No cost to you at all.
---
So the real assholes of EVE end up in NPC corps.  They either never left or got bounced out of every group they joined because that is the fate of assholes in a team based game.  Now there is a difference between being an asshole and being "our asshole."  "Our asshole" is a team player, "Our asshole" might be gruff but kicks back on comms and shoots the shit with you.  "Our asshole" is the first to grab his Drake for an armor fleet and be the goofy mascot that gets everyone else to show up, "our asshole" is the first to join fleet to save a tackled ship.  Everyone else in the EVE community may hate him but he "our asshole" is loved by his people because he gets stuck in with you when the going gets tough.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now the assholes in NPC corps are just that assholes.  They won't teach you anything, they won't want to help you.  They like feeling superior because their join date is older than yours, they have no personality and no humility.  These people you gank, scam, keep from taking SOV because they ruin the game for everyone else.
---
If you are new and reading this, or thinking of hanging up your space spurs because of toxicty in the NPC corps, please get out of Hi Sec ASAP.  There are tons of corps in Low and Null that will teach you everything CCP doesn't know about their own game.
---
Remember Hi Sec is Hi Suck and NPC Corps are the devil.  NPC corps also have a higher than average tax rate, and we all know the rent is too damn high.
---
if people get their accounts banned due to being accessed by a bad ip and that saves their account from being cleaned out and rmt'd i'm willing to accept people getting under the tracks and getting banned accidently.

If you want your account back you should contact support and wait.

no more Asset Safety for NS/LS and 0.5 HS NPC station can be destroyed 1x/month, but probably not gonna happen just like AS nerf, meh
---
some time ago Hilmar Falcon and Rise talked about a "weight limitation" for NPC station but it was difficult to do 'cause you can't code that without a rework of how station work, but even with that people just gonna use more station
---
As it stands, Eve is still pretty fun but it could definitely be better.  Eve Vegas is coming up later in the month.  Pay attention to news coming out of that, apparently some future changes will be announced.  Whether any of the things in those announcements actually happen is another issue...
---
Are u going to roam Ibrox after few pints?
---
Downvoted for telling me what my downvotes are for.
---
No problem. I had a friend in a similar situation a year or so back. Tethered onto his phone to login to Eve to manage some Indy jobs and every account he'd logged in got banned within minutes. This was on a Saturday. Just a bad luck roll and got an IP address from the naughty list. They had him unbanned pretty much first thing Monday morning and gave him a little game time as compensation.
---
I suspect the people who review bans may only be there on weekdays. Weekends is a skeleton crew in the GM dept
---
Why?
---
You really shouldn't be able to run high tier abyssals in HS, that's also a risk/reward imbalance.
---
But I do actually agree with you. Nullsec PVE should be high risk high reward. At the moment it's low risk moderate reward, so as well as significantly increasing the risk of running things there, the reward should be increased a bit too.
---
But it should be done in a way that encourages active play (e.g. more DED type sites or incursions) rather than brain-free anomaly ratting.
---
I am 100% a spy
---
Amen
---
It's bovril, what did you expect?
---
By your logic t2 ships should deteriorate, too
---
I definitely agree that the -50% Tier 1 penalty has always been too much. It tends to be a hugely demoralizing drag to new players especially, who don't understand the "swinging pendulum" phenomenon at all.  Vets are fine sitting at T1 and waiting for their LP prices to climb before they cash out, but in the meantime the low tier faction has completely stagnant recruiting of anyone who isn't already familiar with FW mechanics.
---

---
What security space?  With a Corp that has structures or using the npc facilities?
---
Eh no, please dont listen to that guy. Its just taken out of context. Wardecs were killing newbro corps and have probably been one of the biggest causes behind why the game has shitty retention. Its not risk in that sense, its just seal clubbing the game to death.
---
Highsec ganking basically got one nerf that can be worked around and people are crying. It was always a shitty mechanic since it was griefing more than anything else. This really hasnt changed and still one of the things that drive people away, no matter what BS they or CCP say.
---
Those changes were actually made to get people to live in NS so there would be more targets. And that did happen. Most are just salty cause people actually help eachother out against gankers.
---
Ye orcas cost about 30 times more which he conveniently forgets and can still be killed. 
---
Ye somewhat, but Im fairly certain he is talking about NS where the rewards arent that great.
---
Fun thing... was docking out from a station at a trig invaded system with my freshly bought anathema, only the covert ops cloak was equipped. Then the trigs jumped me just after undocking. Too close to station and already targeted, i nearly lost 80mil. Luckily i managed to jump at 8 dtructure hp and went to home system as fast as i could.
---
Because the US justice system can’t charge you for those crimes, but they CAN charge you with lying on that form.
---
Personally I can’t wait for zKill to shutdown. I’m not a fan of it. But I think it’s a consequence of the player count dropping almost in half from last year. Less people viewing the site.
---
Sounds like ccp. Awesome
---
that’s illogical.
---
ok, I get the point, will rerender video then, did not fully get that puritanism though, comparing dressed beauty girl with pornhub/xvideos, but looks like it for comparative purposes.
---
&gt;is the player suddenly off TZ due to work, school or living situations is one that I know all too well.
---
We're talking about someone who is in corps for a few days, and then boom another Corp, 2 weeks, boom another Corp, etc etc. 
---
There's no "suddenly" in a history like that
---
i wanna see you guys pwnzone nerds, not see half the screen blocked. doesnt matter if its a half nekkid chick or some dumb dabbing skeleton.

\- Probably around 0.5 as the lowest

Why would anybody apply to Bovril for any reason, any intel you get from spying on them being stupid with blingy stuff wouldn’t be worth putting up with them

What a ridiculous post. Let newbies play the same game the rest of us do, without the kid glove treatment.
---
I think for my next video, this Reddit post will a part of it. Thank you for the content!

Serious reply: If your corp history shows you jump a lot of corps after less than a week and you admit to being a spy, they will probably believe you.
---
Buy a cheap graphics card and play with your own IP.
---
You made a joke about the one thing you want to be careful making jokes about in EVE.
---
I was accused of being a spy for being in the wrong comms channel while not in a fleet. I needed the line above the fleet comms channel. Sheesh louise. Lighten the fuck up already.
---
Aye, I do need some better equipment to be fair and a camera is on that list - when i have a few months bills pit away and an income stream i'll look into it all again
---
haha I thought it was funny that you could take something so serious. You literally told me "you answered yes to the spy question twice, I'm afraid it won't work out" and kicked me. Could have easily asked me some questions if you had other concerns. It's alright though, you did me a favour by the sounds of it. Need to pull that stick out of your ass ASAP.

God, you're a savage! Begone!

&gt;hopefully this one persons attitude doesn't represent you all

I'm not a bad guy! Come see me in Vegas next weekend, I think you'll happily surprised 👍

Yeah they’re incredibly stupid assholes if they’re anything like they were in 2014. They were blue to us and moved into my alliance’s ratting space and ratted in carriers no matter what intel said and got dropped constantly. They didn’t care, they just bought another and did the same thing. They never participated in stratops or literally anything, just sat on their fat asses and got dropped all day, attracting all these roamers and neuts to our ratting space like ants to sugar water. We tried to talk to them and they were extremely hostile. Not even our diplos could figure it out. Fuck em.

Since day 1 I’ve always wanted to get into industry, and I started on that as my initial goal, after 2 weeks of mining veldspar in highsec I moved into my Procurer and after 2-3 months of mining plagioclase and making about 400M all told I gave up on it.
---
Well now I’m fired up and ready to be a pro miner, what are some realistic numbers for orca mining? With say T2 drones and is the upgrade to augmented worth it? I’ve got my eye on a moon or 2 for an athanor to get that juicy moon goo, but I gotta know what the numbers.

Any other advice would also be appreciated, thanks in advance.

Entire regions have looked empty for a while. That problem is because it's too advantageous to concentrate people in easily defended space. Give people incentive to spread out and they will start doing things further away from Keepstars.

No, your response is what makes you sound like an ass. Running to Reddit screeching like a man-child because you didn't get into a corp.

Or just make PANIC take a lot of cap. Like, 7k cap. So even if you're dual injected you still can't use it if you're neuted out. Force people to use them earlier and give an option for attackers to shut them down.
---
Alternatively/additionally, prevent Rorqs from adding to or removing from their fuel bays while in the field and then make the PANIC use 2k m3 of stront. Force the Rorqs to dock up every once in a while and reduce the time in field, even by a little.

I'm actually surprised the PANIC never took a significant amount of cap to use.  What kind of bullshit is that?
---
I do think it's a bad idea to discourage Rorquals from undocking, that reduces the opportunities to nab them!
---
&gt;downvotes are not for disagreeing.
---
Yes, they are.
---
Yes, compare those bonuses to the little brothers the orca and porpose. If there is an issue it's with the scalability of multiboxing them. A single person piloting a single rorqual is not a problem.

The T2 guns will give you the benefit of the weapon specialization skill; meta guns will not. If you're just simulating both fits based on your skills, and you don't have the weapon spec skill, you won't see as much difference. You can simulate the difference by adding the weapon spec skill to your current skillset in PYFA.

This is a pretty nice dang video, gonna show it to my lil brother who’s just getting into the game.... gonna buy him the starter pack too so he can do this :)

This is Rediah. I'm amazed I'm remembered on here....the Sith are truly infamous! 😈

This is the EXACT reason I made this video! I had the most fun playing this game back in 2009 when I had 5mil SP and went straight to NBSI Null sec in providence.

Yeah I’m a 2010 pilot myself, the game was much different back then, and I’ll admit I was a filthy casual and took a few breaks which hindered my net worth and sp, but I’m still pretty well off, but this video will definitely help newer players get interested in the game!
---
The first thing I recommend is finding a good corp in an alliance that has all the citadels anchored and setup for production and a low tax rate. Anything 5% and below is preferred. I work out of 2 citadels that offers 2.5% for reactions and 3.0% for all other production from capitals down if you're blue. Working out of Low Sec just 6 jumps from Jita. We also have Null Sec sov for Supers, etc, though I haven't been down there yet.
---
There's money to be made in Low and Null, you just have to get in with the FCs and find out what they fly and help supply them. The less time they have to worry about logistics means more ISK for you.
---
If you want to go it alone then I'd look at items that are easy to make and sell quickly, like drones, ammo and rigs. Just watch out for the twats that sell products at under market value because they "mine" their own minerals and think it's for free. It's only free if you think your time is free, and it's not.
---
Also get yourself a good hauler such as a deep space transport, don't worry about a freighter just yet, and do all the moving yourself. Make friends so you don't fall victim to gate camps (mostly, but you will. I lost a JF so it will happen).
---
And best of luck.
---
If you know the names of that dudes, put em on red corp-standing, so your newbros see in a glimpse when those are around and they can get themselves safe. If You re in HS, well. Could potentially try a wardecc on them, gather ypir folks and show em the pointy end of some blasters.  
---
If you re in LS or Null even... Make some training-roams with T1-frigs with your gang, have ships for them ready around your usual area of activity and when the guys come... PEW. You might lose a bunch of frigs, but, hey, who cares? :)
