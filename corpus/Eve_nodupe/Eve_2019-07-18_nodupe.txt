i don't want to wait X year to be competitive with other vet' i don't want to grind for skill injector when i can spend those ISK in ships and pew with them  
---

---
at this point skill point is just something stupid that keep new player (1day to 1year and more in Eve fucking cancer mechanic) away from this game, just like is boring gameplay/farm...  
---
soo if they offer free SP i'm happy, i would be really really happy if they make those event more frequent (maybe make them un-extracteable to prevent inflation? =Free SP = Free money for old players)
---
---
---
Because I have fuck all reason to just make some shit up......especially about something like that. 
---
I was just passing along information; I'm not here to score points. The only reason I responded is because you wanted to try to be insulting. I'm not going to waste my time trying to hunt down information I've already seen just to convince you of anything, and it's stupid when people act like somebody needs to. Especially when even when you do present people with facts they dismiss them just as easily.  
---
I'm just saying, I read the shit a while ago and it's been talked about several times since then and even had a CSM member bring up the Devs discussing it. If you want proof you can go find it.
---
They were plex skins. Although its possible that CCP could re-release them, I wouldn't exactly hold my breath as all of the early skins were simple palate swaps (except Valimor Legacy which I still believe is the most garbage skin set released) and I wouldn't expect any of them to particularly sell well.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Sure, well take the trade.
---
I mean, the arguments for no local have been 1, bots, 2, more risk, 3, more content. And pro no local seems to think bots are gone to never be seen again so number 1 will be checked. More risk, ofc number 2 down. And 3, more ships in space so more content, check.
---
I say, lets give these guys exactly what they want. And in every agreement lies a compromise so seems fair. Not accepting a compromise would be saying that perhaps they dont belive in their own arguments or that no local wont actually fix any real issues. Lets see who the hypocrites are.
---
That killmail though. What the fuck is even happening with that Ishtar, and even with that terrible fit, how did it die to five bombers while unwebbed?

Lol, yeah I suppose so...!

---
Nothing you can do to prevent a nullified cloaky tengu with a covert cloak from slipping by, logging off, then bridging in a 100 man bomber fleet. Before you could see via local that they bridged in, now there is no indication. Bit op tbh.
---
Hey thanks for reminding me to log in
---
And systems that can fit 2 supers will magically accommodate 10? Get real
---
Short version: Not everybody likes doing the market stuff.
---
Long version: Station trading is an inherently deflationary activity.  Stocking a null market is arguably (depending on how much of the hauling you do) getting paid for work, and there's only so much demand for that work.  You can't make an economy out of only selling people stuff that already exists.  Eventually, someone will need to produce some more stuff, if nothing else.
---
I am still trying to find these “tears” you guys keep pointing to... if anyone can point me towards these tears I would appreciate it tia
---
Some self-important douchebag that thinks because he's the leader of some spaceship guild that he's got some celebrity status. He used Eve and his Alliance to springboard his website business into a multi-dollar empire. Since Eve is niche and wasn't bringing in the bacon he started to branch out in to other games and used his alliance members for views and clicks. 
---
There's also a Twitch stream where they start off streaming Eve and all the little Goon pubies come in to circle jerk each other. Then they switch to another sponsored game they get paid for while nobody is looking. 
---
TLDR: Nobody important
---
OK.  Let me break down what I see because there are two different things happening: what HE does with the information and what viewers do.  Let's cover the first and be done with it.
---
Viewers can see the intel, not technically in real time, but near enough.  However, this happens every day on multiple streams that CCP have been aware of for years.  So, I think the debate on this is settled.
---
What he does with the overlay is obviously different, so let's look at the specific point that CCP made in their clarification post.
---
&gt; For example, having overviews from other EVE clients as overlays on one EVE client would allow a player to get real time intel from all those other game instances without having to switch to the other windows.
---
1: having overviews from other EVE clients as overlays on one EVE client - 
---
this is not happening.  The overlays are not on a client.  8 clients are fully open and nothing has been modified in the client in any way (as far as I am aware).  They are overlayed within OBS.
---
2: allow a player to get real time intel from all those other game instances without having to switch to the other windows -
---
Ok, yeah.  kinda.  but knowing something is pointless if you aren't able to act on it.  in order to act on it in any way, he MUST switch to the active Eve client in order to do anything (report in intel, dock his ships, trash talk in local, whatever).  The point that I am sure that CCP were making here is that they don't want you to use a third party program to overlay the information ON YOUR CLIENT in such a way that you never have to change windows.  If he didn't change windows, he has no advantage at all from this.  Knowing that a gang is coming is useless if you don't tell anyone or do anything.
---
Except they don't, not really, and bait them.
---
Not new. Horde was doing this months ago. Eye of gobbins, etc.
---
that's... standard null. most people rats and mine in a few non-pipe systems.  sometimes delve can be an exception, but not really
---
I think having to pay higher fees for NPC Station corp offices and rent based on stashed assets at said NPC stations would be a good way to remove in-game isk and offset the mission spam.
---
Is this guy even relevant to Eve online?
---
Puts on punglasses.
---
FTFY
---
I had a feeling this shit was happening. so many tethered noob ships in Delve sitting at a citadel on grid.
---
You can spend a lot more time lining it up when they can't see your in cyno and can't see you bridged them in 5 minutes ago, either, though.  (speaking as a person who's done that...)
---
Have you used near2? Have you lived in NS?
---
You are presenting it as a full proof, borderline illegal thing. In reality its nothing of the sorts. Near2 depends on player information. If there are no players to report, it wont ping. And outside of Delve, man, no place has enough players to actually report every system.
---
Which means theres a lot of empty space between and even if you see a neut 5 jumps out it doesnt mean they will come your way. You cant just dock up everytime someone is in the vicinity and you dont always have someone in the system over to report.
---
So ye, in theory you are correct. But in reality it doesnt really work they way you describe it. Anyone using near2 knows (or should) that you should only use it to get an better overview of your intel channel because its only as good as the reports, i.e., fairly crappy in most places.
---
Galaxy brain meta play right there
---
As long as no one can hot drop you or your in a super/rorq in coms under a super umbrella you can.
---
All I did was ask for a source and you got super defensive. And when it comes to something like this, you should have something to reference or source. Otherwise its just an anecdote and no one can really give it any serious merit. And telling someone to go look it up with no real search criteria is kind of BS. And FYI, I looked for "eve dscan server performance" and it came back with no relevant results on either google or reddit. So I am not just going to take some joe's word that it has a big impact on server performance when I cant find a single thing to back that up.
---
Nothing wrong with that. I do think the change is interesting but I think this swing has put subcap and excavatiors in a bad spot risk wise. This skill goo being a cover and all.
---
400i I.Q. Meta play right there
---
thats the point, I did VNI ratting before with 3 alt and main for defending space, doing ded or so. I hate scanning and wh so why should I risk my ships when risk is far more than reward in null anomaly...
---
r/evejobs is for recruitment
---
Umm, you have to keep the MCT up each month as well. It also only grants the MCT for 1 more character per activation.
---
That's a very sexy leshak kill. That dude probably didn't play for a week after that. :D
---
I guess it comes down to if you want to perma run the repper or pulse it. Without plates, my paladin has 11,000 base HP in armor without resists. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/dH102zO.png
---
With a large nanobot acclerator II and Large Aux nano pump II, the x-type large armor reps 7186 every 9 seconds with high grade asklepian set. Even with strong exile booster, that's only going to bring it up to like 9341 armor repaired every cycle. I have a lot of fits for my paladin depending on the situation. Sometimes I'll throw a faction 1600mm plate on it to go with x-type and faction large armor reps just so I have a bit more buffer. 
---
His fit is weird though. He paid for T2 trimarks, an x-type rep, then went with cheap ass T2 1600mm plates. It's really tanky with 219,000 ehp and 33,120 base armor. He has absolutely no fear of overrepping with a measly 5,687hp repped every 11.3 seconds (if he has high grade set.) That heavy fleeting compact warp disruptor takes up a lot of his powergrid keeping him from using a heavy capcitor booster, so he wastes a midslot with a medium capacitor booster which really does nothing for him, especially being limited to single cycles of navy cap booster 800s. I dunno, he might as well have dropped the repper and the medium cap booster and put a 3rd 1600mm plate and a grappler or something else in the midslot. His ehp jumps up to about 275,000, his cap lasts twice as long, and he can also hold whatever he tackles really well.
---
Also, he has navy ammo instead of rare pirate faction for some reason. If you spend a few billion on a ship, spend the extra few million for the best ammo. I'm sure there's more, but definitely some weird choices. Oh yeah, and I've said it like 3 times, but no boosters with a paladin, eesh, I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't have implants for it either.
---
So then more players will quit than have already shown they don't want to play in this system. Current numbers we have don't support that this is a massive success like reddit loves to think it is.
---
Wanna split 50-50?
---
Fine. But the game should punish people for over-populating. Infinite resources are a joke.

So is he the baddie? I tried googling it but it just came up with something about an old palace in a lake

Blackouts shite. Local wasnt the problem it doesnt change a thing for the good. Delete supers game goes in the right direction.
---
I guess we'll just have to disagree and leave it at that. Like I said, it's up to CCP. I'm not going to go around reporting him or screaming about him breaking the rules and that he should be banned or anything. I just view it as jaywalking - technically illegal, but rarely enforced.
---
Not really groups like Goons will maintain control over large areas as buffers, so they can use the space to hell dunk roaming gangs before they even get close to the crabs.

what point? all I said was that guy doesn't realize how many people bot?
---
oh I can hear the two brain cells rubbing together
---
That's pretty much my recollection of flying with Boat, but it's definitely never boring.
---
And you still havent figured it out? you are a lost cause. I said someone doesn't realize how many bots there are and you went off on how I'm suggesting or acting like something. Get help man
---
I know that feel. I used to rat brining in a consistent 45m/h in ticks. now i have about 2.1m skill points that i probably won't be using again.
---
Yeah you can fake activity but then you are botting, everyone knows you are botting, and you can get reported so the guy running 40 cloaky camper accounts gets banned.
---
Then I fail to see a problem. Players playing by the rules are not a "problem" by definition. The entire thread is child-like in its perception of reality. That's fine, there's no crime in being young and dumb, but I don't think I'm going to comment further about it.
---
Yeah, obviously I haven't thought that through to the end. So I indeed oversaw something there. Thank you.
---
You said acting like you have idea how many bots there are either.
---
I can only hope for your sake it happens eventually.
---
750, final offer.
---
So you get to act like you know the answer but when someone calls you out on that bullshit they are wrong.
---
&gt; So then more players will quit than have already shown they don't want to play in this system.
---
One nerf and players start quitting? Ok. Bye. Can I have your stuff?
---
I owe you _nothing_. This is something I and lots of others want. The past 4 years have been almost nothing but buffs to PvE playstyles. Now that there is one nerf even being *discussed* krabs are docking their toys and unsubbing? Ok. Bye. I honestly couldn't give a fuck less about people who are so wholly incapable of dealing with a single change.
---
&gt;  Players playing by the rules are not a "problem" by definition.
---
How is that remotely true?
---
Toxic behavior is still a problem even when the rules allow it.
---
Abuse of the existing rules are problems even when the rules allow them.
---
The point he's making is that the commonly cited issues with the state of the game in regards to nullsec is heavily wrapped up in player behaviors that can't really be managed by changing game mechanics.
---
None of that feeling is childlike.
---
I don't know what I'm looking at but I don't think rouge is in season this year. More earth tones.
---
Hi,
---
this is obviously a P2-P4 x5 setup (for the 3 easy P4s which need only 2 P3 and 1 P1).
---
For 24h you need 6x2400 units of P2 (or 6x 3600 m³) and 4800 units of P1 (or 1824m³). Your warehouse is 12000m³ and your two launchpads are 10000m³each.
---
3x 3600m³ are notgoint to fit into a launchpad but 2x3600m³ will fit easily. And 2x3600m³ plua 1824m³ are easily going to fit a storage unit.

I probably should have put /s after that last comment I guess...
---
There aren't areas of space with `other people looking to pvp`. The default for newer players the past few years has been to join a deep null krab coalition, then farm until you get a titan. 
---
If you roam lowsec with a small gang nowadays you'll just get a couple cheap ganks or some veteran tryhard group forming 2:1 HG snaked orthrus + recon spam.

salt isnt always about how much you lost, but the manner in which you lost it.  like getting kicked and awoxed by your corp - i understand salt.  i understand that PL guy's scam of their tournament team.
---
How has there been almost nothing but buffs to PVE, there have been mining and anom nerfs recently. And good for you to not care, but when all the people you want to hunt quit playing what are you going to do? And do you think its good to cut out how many subs?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
&gt;they would do it in rvb, tourneys, abyssal
---
RVB is dead and is dumb
---
The AT is dead and only occured once a year too, player run tournaments have terrible support and occur infrequently.
---
It's fairly hard to small gang in abyssal pvp and abyssal solo is boring as fuck since the game isn't 1v1 balanced.
---
Ah yes, you are the exception, your brain is so much bigger than the rest of us
---
I hauled something 5 jumps into enemy space and it was fun. EVE is fun again!
---
maybe think why people are downvoting you? re read everything again and try using comprehension. fuck your mental
---
When we were in Geminate, BWF-ZZ was the most violent system in nullsec 24/7 with sometimes up to 1k kills/3hrs.
---
This was with local enabled.
---
Haven't really had all that much action since local changes.
---
I miss when both GSF and Snuffed Out were constantly bringing fleets (sometimes 100+ ships) to us like every day or other day. Lots of good fights.
---
thanks mate
---
delete combat anomaly and mineral anomaly spawn the rocks and rats in the asteroid belts
---
Mining and anom nerfs? Wow gee I'm real sorry. Must be hard for you in the era of rorquals, ansiblexes, citadels, carriers + fighter reworks, and jump fatigue reduction. The farms and fields reworks of the past four years have been nothing but buffs to pve.
---
&gt; when all the people you want to hunt quit playing what are you going to do?
---
If _all_ the people I want to hunt quit, then I'll be sad. But they won't all quit after one nerf, just like _all_ the pvpers didn't quit after years of getting fucked.
---
thank you
---

Typhoon and Raven are both 8 effective, RoF is calculated by dividing by 0.75 (overall a 33.33333333333333333% increase) whereas damage is calculated by multiplying by 1.25 (flat 25% increase), you can see this by putting an unbonused turret on a hull (day, 8x Heavy Pulses on a Naga) then comparing the burst aerator and collision accelerator, for every 100 base DOS the burst aerator should do 1.1111111 extra damage per second.

If they read his r/Eve posts they’re probably grateful.
---
Muah, magnefique! Just the right amount of salt!
---
Because people downvote anyone who doesn't support the local change?
---
Precisely. My idea is by no means unique, but the last thing I need is another competitor.
---
Loki gets the worst bonuses possible for rlml, legion or even Tengu are better.
---
If Legacy attacked Imperium with help from Panfam and frat, the Imperium would fall. 
---
Of course, that isn’t going to happen because Legacy is just Test + pets and test is a goon pet, but if it somehow did happen then Imperium would be evicted
---
lol
---
Reactions and PI.
---
Yes we don't know how many bots there are and acting like someone in naive for saying we don't know how many there are and people shouldn't act like everything is a bot is stupid and condescending. You sit here and lecture me on how retarded you think I am but can't even read your own posts.
---
Threatening to PVP me in a PVP game? Oh no pls don't, anything but that! Not more of the thing I play the game for! Oh the humanity!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfLP2X16NJ0
---
They do but because of the geography of Deklein/Branch, they can’t use it effectively. Same reason Panfam didn’t really have an effective umbrella while PL was in tribute and PH was in Geminate
---
alright i'll let you farm your downvotes with your terrible posts on your own
---
Then why did everyone get so many fights this weekend and claim everyone was out PVPing. My constant question is why didn't these people go fight before the change, and the obvious answer is they didn't actually want to fight they wanted easy kills. Its like people going into delve and being mad that goons dropped titans on them, instead of fighting them in frigates. Goons don't want to fight you and roaming into their space doesn't make it your right to get a good fight.
---
the polo is coming from inside the house
---
Loki with Arties and 50mn is good for hunting VNIs and for popping small stuff at range, but if it gets caught it’s gonna have a bad time.
---
100mn RLML Legion is fantastic, but a good fit can get quite expensive, it does get dual neuts and defensive scram for control and it’s fine when th carriers bring on grid - they don’t really apply to it. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77765487/
---
The name checks out sir.
---
Nah it's just normal sized.
---
Yeah, they really though that they would reach insane EHP lol
---
Playing since the beta but salty about that shitty pod... Sounds like a Moron. Nice work killing him.
---
Its not a bug, its absolutely intended
---
Lets say D comes along and D is at war with A but not B.  Then A is being repped by a neutral 3rd party that D cant shiit
---
&gt; I'm wondering what could possibly be the right target if not defenseless miners.
---
think bigger than t1 subcaps.
---
&gt;Have any of the hardcore PVP people out there realized that the blackout actually favors PVE yet? Find that things aren't what you dreamed of? Roamed through countless empty systems only to die to a gate camp?
---
​No pretty much the opposite really
---
Yeah I did think lack of faction plates ect was weird.
---
Like I said before I would definitely tweak his fit to be less pepega :P
---
Do you have that dual leshak fit by any chance? ;)
---
Ever heard of providence? Geminate (now replaced with Etherium Reach)? Curse and stain were somewhat active. 
---
Lowsec isn’t nearly as bad as you claim, and there’s also wormhole space. 
---
Lots of places to go if you want a good fight. If you just want to kill krabs, fine, but don’t expect the krabs to fight any more honorably than you are planning to
---
Which class wormhole is the salt one that you came from?
---
Being able to kill krabs gives them a reason to be out in space. You can't go looking to pvp people who aren't out in space.
---
The lack of local also gives defenders a better path of escalation without simply dropping X supers and failing to tackle anything, so they're more likely to attempt to defend krabs with actual gangs.
---
SHIP CANNON!
---
Nice recording 2bh
---
That you act condescending when someone says we don't know how many bots there are. You don't know either. I keep saying you don't know and your response is who cares. If you didn't know and don't care maybe you need to stop talking. You should see how stupid you come off.
---
Right, but all the people who like the current changes being forced on to people, won't like being forced to PvP, it's gonna be hilarious.
---
Well r/eve doesnt consider that as good content only ganking krabs is acceptable here.
---
alts were a mistake
---
And that stops you? Right, no you want easier kills.
---
Why not be out in space to fight people who want to fight if that is what people are supposedly looking for? That could have happened before local was removed..
---
And why would no local encourage them to not use supers? They are just going to boson anything and if they get escalated on they will bring more titans.
---
And for a 15 year old game to maintain so many concurrent players is a testament to the base game. Unfortunately everything hits problems at different point and I would argue eve gets hit harder then most. It has a very creative player base who are constantly finding exploits or previously unknown tactics. 
---
The problem here is not the players. They naturally don't want to lose their shit. No one does. Some people just accept it. 
---
The problem is balance. At least in the sense of stagnation. That is a fixable problem. The classic risk/reward. Eve has never and will never get it right since everyone will never be simultaneously happy with a change. They all play the game for their own reason. The best CCP can do is create a sandbox, like you mentioned before, but they control the rules. Saying there is no way to change it would dictate highsec shouldn't exist. Make it a pure sand box. I could get crazier with example but I fear the conversation will be focused on it. In then end CCP has the ability to change the sandbox rules to push the players into engagement. Otherwise it's not a feasible business plan.
---
This could be considered similar to advertising. They can't force you to buy but they can convince you to. Ccps convincing is just more mechanics based since anything they say won't convince players to play differently.
---
I resubbed. I hate null sec (omg its so boring, and by it I specifically mean the people who live there) but want to reward CCP for doing something positive to improve the game. My theory is good game design if rewarded will lead to a trickle down effect to eventually make low sec great again. One day. Maybe.
---
&gt;Horde Ticker
---
&gt;Go to stain for small gang pvp
---
Y'know, it's a good thing i was my own decision maker and didn't leave vily on my vote card.
---
&gt;Null sec got lazy, especially the miners and ratters. This laziness was due to the relative safety of intel networks and super umbrellas. This laziness led to spreading too thin over vast amounts of space with disorganized defenses. The safety blanket made for easy kills. Now with the blackout, null sec will adapt and actually organize. They will follow the tried and true Delve model. This will only make it harder to get kills, not easier.
---
This is good for the game.
---
Everywhere is pretty dead, because ratting right now is suicide unless you’re in a super and under an umbrella
---
How to increase Plex sales in one change

More like CCP fucking themself

All this goon whining makes the blackout worrthwhile.

And at the end of the day... CCP's interpretation wjllt be what counts, not an individual player's. But then again... When does CCP listen to the players?

Thanks for the work on this, I have a hard time talking about morbid things, but I've lost way too many space friends in the last year or two. I've though about placing a can but it's just not the same as a proper tribute in my opinion, no offence to anyone. I know what I'll be doing once this comes out, but seriously, thanks for this. 
---
I can't really put it in words, but I feel a bit more happy. I can imagine one of my fellow space mates that passed on would probably tell me, "Who the fuck told you to put my corpse in a can!" if he could. In a way, this is to fuck around with that old timer's kindred spirit and to remind him, he's shit as well. May you rest in peace good buddy.
---
highsec, he got evicted
---
pay someone to scout or use an alt, if you watch your gates, and make sure to clear youe signature list youll be fine, if they want to camp all day to kill your excavators well don't undock if you're gonna cry.
---
Unless you have a transformer bomber, you're still locked to one when you undock.
---
Eve bitch best bitch
---
I thought the same, until I experienced unloading all 20 rounds within half a minute
---
If you are doing solo hunting, sustained dps doesn't matter cuz if you need to stay on grid for more than a minute something must went horridly wrong
---
Welcome to EVE, motherfucker
---
take away cloaking and they will just tether to a cit on gate grid.
---
if i was beter with paint, itd be a marshal, with cowboy hat, and a mega in cuffs(you know the 2 pylons in the front?)
---
Playing since beta != smart. In fact, youd have to be pretty dumb to play eve that long.
---
Beating up on QFC isn't an accomplishment.
---
A) If you know where you're hunting you choose the right bomber before you undock based on resist holes. Bombers are small so having 4 isn't too hard to do
---
B) if the other guy is omni tanked it doesn't matter what bomber you choose
---
C) it doesn't change the fact that a bomber has the equivalent of 5.25 launchers
---
what the actual fuck
---
For 1b per system / per month, I can provide this kind of intel in Delve/Querious for up to 45 systems.
---
*unknown abbreviations intensify*
---
I wasn’t prepared to see a sad Gary Busey today.
---
Dude, these suggestions are child level ones. If you knew anything about anything you wouldnt be using them as arguments.
---
lol so this is now about the local change? Haha your fun
---
that's now what you've been saying.. oh man you really aren't all there this is fun
---
You haven't been on the forums yet obviously
---
I don't see armor curse fitting?
---
What a bunch of nonsense
---
The 500MN is there to get into warp faster - you turn it on for a single cycle as you align, and when it turns off you're going fast enough to warp. You want to use a 500MN for this as, capital MWDs have a longer cycle time. In this case he's also got the 50000MN because the higher speed will get him out of bubbles faster.
---
As for the rest of the fit, it's a "driveby" titan, meaning the goal is to jump in, doomsday something, and get out. Everything on the fit aside from the doomsday itself is intended to make the titan hard to pin down. It's fit for max warp speed to give him higher chances of evading combat probers as he bounces around the system waiting for his doomsday timer to expire so he can cloak. Three large smartbombs allow him to kill any dictor bubble inside his smartbomb range in a single cycle (unfortunately for him, we knew this and dropped our bubbles at 10km until the hics landed).
---
He did cheap out on his tank, but without faxes, fitting "proper" tank (Pith-A invulns and CONCORD extenders) would have just delayed the inevitable, and given him a pricer lossmail. So even though I teased them for it in local I can't really blame him.
---
When you have finished working on that tech.. be sure to let Scorpius know. He’s been tailing John Crichton for a wormhole weapon near the Uncharted Territories. Thanks in advance!!
---
I completely agree.  When pvpers lose ships they shouldn’t be able to just replace them forever from hisec or other safe pockets
---
After losing so many ships concord should restrict their pilot license until they take training courses spread out across all 4 empires and have criminal status while doing so and it should show on the map when this happens.
---
If you like blanket ridiculously annoying mechanics for others, you’ll LOVE dealing with this so fight for ccp to push it alongside your bullshit ideas
---
you literally are retarded... someone even linked you evidence showing that there's bots hahahaha go get mental help
---
you're*
---
It is like listening to a broken clock.
---
Also my friends left me to die :P
---
For real. I played eve for about 10 minutes and realized that I am in no way interested in a game this in depth. I still follow the sub though and find myself laughing at memes I don’t even really understand. Good times.
---
hahaha so this is now about the local change? why are you dodging that? oh yah because you are fucking retarded and make shit up
---
first wave coming soon^tm
---
Was in the BL fleet that caused that. That sound cloud is literal gold.
---
Waaaa your not a BOT ?
---
is that what the two brain cells rubbing together make? the sound of a broken clock. Haha man try not to be too embarrassed about yourself. re read it all and dont feel too dumb
---
Only russian pvp videos my man. They really are the shit.
---
You are missing the point because you abused that koolaid bottle buddy... most PVPers aren't looking for easy boring afk ratter kills, the true objective is to get fights, and that's exactly what is happening.
---
And true, Super umbrellas exist and it sucks, but this is still a step in the right direction; sure, lots of people get a Boson to the face, but lots more are having really great fights!
---
Can a tengu only be used once?
---
hmm see how your getting downvoted still?
---
....Dude, fix your overview...type is more important than name.
---
And remove your fleet members.
---
You scooped the corpse, right?
---
Haha flat earther you have no clue what you are talking about.
---
There are actually quite a few on here though, and thats BEFORE going to a more PVE sperg centered place like the EVE-O forums.
---
I feel like I'm on r/VXjunkies but you guys are actually talking about something. Everything has a specific term or nickname and I feel like I need a dictionary but it's hilarious half understanding everything going on here.
---
Oh no you are downvoting me what a tragedy.
---
Is Razor still relevant?
---
That is literally how you have been acting the entire time, I figured that is what we are doing now.
---
Haha now your a parrot!
---
There's a word for this.  1.0 Hi Sec
---
and it's still retarded! your comprehension skills are equal to a crayon
---
this guy attentions to detail
---
because there is nothing to hunt with it that a carrier wouldn't be way cheaper, kill way faster and tank way more?
---
the things you're gonna hunt are vnis/myrms/domis, you ain't tanking a carrier (or anything higher) without outpricing it by a lot, and good luck hunting DED runners. Unless you live in thera what even is the point. I guess maybe an orca or some shit v0v
---
all the shit you said I've been saying or acting doesn't exist. you are literally in your own world. your fucking retarded and it's hilarious thanks for the entertainment
---
Parade his corpse all around Eve
---
you still have ewarp so you'll have to land before you jump, but yes. Make sure to fit a cloak and have spare fuel just in case.
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll fix that next time I'm online!
---
"the math" that includes arbitrary statements like "extremely hard to catch"?
---
  
---
You keep coming back to your selective information of "super ratting is riskier". All ratting is riskier. But the mechanics built into supers makes them inherently much harder to catch regardless of having local or not.
---
And if you really want to talk about the time to cost ratio, what about carriers? Easier to catch than supers, but they can still fit a cyno and enough tank to last until help is there. Those certainly don't take "50-60 hours" to replace.
---
I’m gonna bet he was a cyno in the wrong pod
---
Do you have any clue what you are saying?
---
i cant tell if its salt, or pride. Or a delicious mixture of both XD Probably just salt though........
---
hahahaha
---
Were they ever?
---
Prove us wrong and make a corp without any blues and move out to sov
---
It’s funny that most elitist aren’t elite at all lol 
---
Hence the key word here ACTING elitist.
---
The cheapest damage-dealing covert bridgeable ship, no level 5s ship skills needed.  
---
you can fit it like a cheap legion with a buffer tank, neuts in the high and good 400+ dps with ogres using a single damage mod for a pretty decent price or you can fit one as a remote rep if needed. both are light on tank though getting around 50k ehp.
---
I think it also might be alpha friendly
---
Incorrect.
---
yeah actually, it's been really goddamn good
---
Don’t know why you got downvoted, but thats nice.
---
you gotta shovel the shit before you grow a good garden my dude
---
They didn’t say that, they’re just saying that the fleet and alliance play style doesn’t work for them and that they don’t enjoy non-essential banter on comms.
---
I mean it hasn't been worth having a conversation yet because you just keep saying I am retarded so we can keep that up.
---
Yeah :( I love that ship but it's really hard to justify flying it from a purely numerical standpoint in most cases.
---
At least you're a good sport about it.
---
clearly
---
You started making shit up from the very start and proved you weren't worth conversing with!
---
Just stating, I assumed empty pod at first too, but some people rip out implants so no way to verify that part. Plenty of issues with the exact fit implementation for sure.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Nice work.
---
not fitting a cyno made that possible.
---
HKs tend to die
---
Being able to kick him from fleet also helped ☺️
---
TBH, the current changes and the new 64bit client seem like good excuses to start nerfing detailed results in d-scan.  
---
All players really need to see is a signal strength, ie 1mn, 10mn, etc, and maybe one of four types of signals or other data limited to the categorical.
---
Not in the least but its clear you can't understand that.
---
2b thanny with no rigs. Alright, then.
---
See, we're simple people. You do nice things you get nice gifts.
---
I'm rolling like this with everything abyssal ofc. So far so good and it's dirt cheap.

try reading everything from the start again and dont feel too embarrassed!! hahahaha your fun
---
Wtf? No carriers died before blackout? Just checking kb to check.....................oh look they did.
---
Provided by my corpmate and friend, Disstair (who somehow doesn’t have a reddit account like wtf?!)
---
please link them so I'm not crazy
---
Pretty easily.
---
Ok done, I still know what I am saying and see you have no idea. Your turn to try.
---
I like how you put "50-60 hours" in quotes as if most people super ratting aren't earning about 300m/hr, and most ratting supers aren't about 15b. But hey - whatever makes you feel superior. 
---
The space that most null groups have right now cannot support the number of people ratting in subcaps switching to caps. They would have to spread out, meaning they would be more vulnerable. So fine, use carriers and supers. Some of them will be 2j from their umbrella, or the umbrella will be smaller. _Regardless_ how krabs feel about it isn't my primary concern - if you think people are going to start using supers instead of gilas, and you think that the local blackout will become permanent, I suggest you start putting hels in build.
---
No rigs
---
Warp Core Stabs
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
There is always someone who will say that.
---
I’m guessing he ripped the rigs.
---
and its evident your fucking retarded and like to make shit up hahah. your fun
---
Trainer Clone?
---
Now do that without cloacky shit.
---
His handle is certainly appropriate.
---
im fairly certain blackout didnt make it possible to kill shitfit carriers bud
---
Against defenseless covetors?
---
Getting that mad over +5s? Also does he know that 1b isn't worth jack shit anymore? What a tool.
---
Not always.  For example, the market landscape is a product of logical behavior based on constraints imposed by design.  
---
If I have X amount of global market orders, I'm going to put them all where they will do me the most good.  That's why Jita has 6 times the investment (86T) of the nearest competing hub, and 175 thousand times the median station (0.5B) (out of no less than eight thousand redundantly useless markets).
---
If market orders existed on a per-station basis, you would see a wide range of manufacturable goods in almost every constellation.  There will probably always be a Jita for unmanufacturable goods, but the fact that there isn't ships or ammo for sale in your neck of the woods, much less competitively priced, is a decision made by CCP.
---
blackout stops people fitting cynos? since when?
---
holy fuck let it go dude
---
volta didn't want to drop a handful of covetors. there's a bunch of reasons why you wouldn't want to do that. jfc.
---
Late reply (was out of town, and off the Net for a few)
---
Thank you very much for your reply!  I didn't even know reprocessing was a thing, and I learned a ton going down the rabbit hole after your post -- Thank You!
---
The most informative part of this video was when Youtube started buffering at the 34s mark.
---
&lt;3
---
&gt; the true objective is to get fights, and that's exactly what is happening.
---
that's bullshit or they'd have just done it before blackout. considering pretty much all the "this is only possible thanks to blackout" posts are just killing ratters that were obviously never going to give them a "good fight" i think you're kinda talking out of your ass, a lot.
---
I actually *play* EVE and I have almost no idea what you just said LOL
---
this is just a renter from "Fraternity. Treasury" Fraternity doesn't responsible for it! not even think about it! Fraternity is the only alliance who treats this dying game seriously now. The only alliance that has the courage to play EVE in the downwind. +respect
---
&gt; This is good for the game.
---
it's good for the game that the rate of supercap proliferation, one of the most whined about things, is acellerated and that anyone that doesn't own a cap or bigger is basically told to go fuck themselves regard to PvE in nullsec unless they just want to throw away cheap disposable ships like myrms for a piss poor isk/hour that's now worse than it was previously?
---
Their corporation title is literally in the name, dude. Lay off the Kool Aid.
---
So wait, you're complaining that people are going to have more supercaps...while also complaining that ISK/hr is going down.       
---
Something's not right here.        
---
There's plenty of good ways to make ISK. Wormholers have no problem doing that, and we haven't ever had local and our anomalies don't respawn infinitely.
---
&gt;People dislike the change because for one, certain things lack counters. Its not a game about skill and knowledge anymore but rather luck. 
---
Can you explain this? How has the game become luck-based? My last experience with it was from 2010-2012.
---
Props to the Thanny pilot for taking a risk.
---
Uni taught a class on Logi, followed by taking an entire fleet of Logi into LowSec to gate camp for a little while. Got a couple of Capitals dropped on us, but managed to take out a Drekavac before we went down.
---
gf Fweddit!
---
Really? :( Caps aren't anything special anymore? That's a shame.
---
Hey, a lot of people are really sensitive about this issue.  Or, well, they could have been.
---
&gt;So wait, you're complaining that people are going to have more supercaps...
---
i'm saying people whine the game already has too many supercaps - this change just acelerates the rate at which people are acquiring them since that's now the way to deal with the black out.
---
&gt;while also complaining that ISK/hr is going down.
---
while ratting in a subcap, yes, a totally different class of ship. two completely unrelated things.
---
&gt;Something's not right here.
---
yes, you somehow think that subcap anom ratting isk/hour is tied to the number of supers in game - it isn't.
---
&gt;There's plenty of good ways to make ISK. Wormholers have no problem doing that, and we haven't ever had local and our anomalies don't respawn infinitely.
---
congratulations for them - but what people do outside of null is irrelevant. if you want people in null, undocked, and doing shit, then it has to be worth their while. subcap ratting is pretty much worth nobody's time now unless you're a new player that hasn't yet got the skills for caps or skills to make isk via a non-combat method.
---
I put it in quotes because I was quoting you, but hey- whatever makes you feel superior.
---
How krabs feel is exactly what this whole line of comments was concerned with... so... I guess you were talking about something else? Idk. I sure hope the blackout, or at least some version of it, becomes permanent.
---
Lol 1488. For fucking real?
---
this is probably true tbh
---
More like a dime a Titan.
---
also, how the mighty have fallen.
---
NSH used to be feard for baiting out supers to kill, now they're reduced to bragging about killing a shitfit carrier?
---
a shame.
---
Say hello to my little bomber fleet.
---
This was painful to read.
---
Ooooo boo!  Don't tell that to my stealth bomber.  She might get shy.
---
Man, that sucks... They used to be so cool.
---
as a funeral director, I am glad this is a thing. So many of us use so many ways to deal with grief and when we channel that grief in positive ways it makes it so much easier. If you need help, it's our there and even if eve is or isn't permanent...the way we deal with it in game is nothing but positive.
---
As someone in the Wingspan fleet, man you were a great sport about it. You’re the kind of guy that really sends this game over the top. As enjoyable as a salty response is to our deliveries, you were the most enjoyable delivery I have been apart of.. pretty sure you made everyone’s night.
---
Have fun with the rest of that POCO lol.
---
I look forward to running into you in wormhole space in the future, never know when a connecting WH might pop up ;) Wishing you the best my dude.
---
Lower level pvp like this shows that it's not that hard. And it can be fun for even less experienced players. Imagine if every highsec corp had dudes doing this in null? Game would be more fun for everyone :)
---
On the flip side, you came in to the game as it entered freefall into a totally different entity than it once was. Player numbers have plummeted overall, what masks the mounting failures is the proliferation of micro transactions that have lead to increased profit in spite of the dwindling player base.
---
And EVE is (or was) unique in many very special ways, one of them being that they've basically always been working with a fairly static core community, nobody ever really leaves EVE for good. New people come in, sure, but we all know retention rate is abysmal. There's a certain core audience to Eve, and they've been driven off for years now. They actually are quite relevant even without currently playing, because they represent not only the best potential to reclaim Eve's dangerous and dynamic legacy but also the biggest potential pool of subs to be (re) tapped, given that they've already proven that they "get" the game. 
---
I'm glad you've found a home in this game, and trust me when I say you'll probably continue to if the numbers of "bittervets" STILL playing despite having *their* play styles shat upon in favor of yours for years is anything to go by. Or maybe the new breed of null bear who joined this game at a certain point in its history doesn't have that tenacity, I don't know. 
---
There are more than enough of us long term eve players able to return if the game stops being space minecraft again, and given the aforementioned quasi micro transaction based income of CCP and pvp player's propensity to actually purchase the plex that bears buy with isk, we're more than capable of replacing you economically. As plex prices deflate less military grade optimized ratting operations are needed to plex, and overall in game time dedicated to actually playing increases. And also, believe it or not, there are tons of us who knew how to do every form of industry back when nul was dangerous and the economy was more diversified, shit still got done without super umbrellas etc.
---
You haven't seen the arc of this game over time, you joined during a particular phase and that's all that you think EVE is. That's why the voices of old players, yes even ones that haven't subbed in years, matter. The meta game that settled into place and attracted a certain kind of player over the last few years has served to choke and calcify the game, and catering to you guys has overall driven off more paying customers than it's attracted. CCP ACTUALLY knows its base, I think, and it's pretty clear that unless there's some correction EVE will become a game without a niche; too hardcore and complicated to sustain a purely carebear type of player base and too stagnant to retain the fairly consistent base community that has sustained EVE for 16 years. 
---
A short term shock to subs in exchange for potentially many more years of eve's existence as the dynamic game it's known as is worth it, probably even from a monetary perspective, but certainly from a certain cultural and emotional one. Maybe you don't care or get it but lots of us are invested in Eve to a level few players of few games ever get to, that's why you always hear from us (and will continue to, forever, whether you like it or not).
---
is this a script from that one eve promotional video?
---
To a degree for sure, but planting citadels on enemy systems at least require some additional work than just guy entering it and cloaking. And most importantly you can take the citadel away if you put in enough effort. There's nothing you can do to a cloaking streamer.
---
Well this is a bad idea.
---
You avoid getting wardecced that way. He has learned how trick those evil wardeccers during his 15+ years of playing.
---
The whole point of this entire post is that Krabs feel entitled and are hypocritical. How Krabs feel is immaterial because they've shown time and again to scream and whine and threaten to quit the second Eve stops becoming a fantasy wealth generation simulator for them
---
The important thing. I whored on the fort.
---
Legacy and DeadCo are Imperium sphere.
---
Thanks
---
I still think the cyno system works backwards.  
---
Caps shouldn't cyno to subcaps.  Subcaps should cyno to caps.  
---
What is a capital ship?  It's an element of force projection.  It's a focus of hostile entities and their logistics.  In a word, it's *bait*.
---
Wanna move caps around?  Weft them to something even bigger, like a citadel.  You hit the enemy's infrastructure, you directly impact their force projection capability.
---
You can use several multipliers to corral players into making appropriate use of fatigue.  For example, cynoing a high mass ship might carry a much larger fatigue multiplier for the pilot.  That limits force projection and content-dodging industrialists, but rewards small response forces.  It may even be possible to put in mass limits on the amount of response a cap pilot can summon.
---
The key to making a successful system is making sure that everyone using the system can remain somewhat active and occupied, instead of idled in order to participate in the nerfed umbrella.  To cast a wide umbrella, capital assets have to be dispersed, a potentially risky move.  
---
Personally, I really like the possibilities inherent in allowing for limited mass wormholes to be opened between citadels and capitals.  Imagine if all the stargates in non-npc controlled space just started blinking out because of the Triglavians..
---
We were expecting the almost the same batphones as last time so we planned accordingly.

I'm just disappointed there weren't rorqs on the km
---
It's amazing how many people come out of the woodwork when they are told snuff's gonna be around.
---
10 of your own titans weren't enough so you called goons and init. Lmao.
---
Great place to collect Orcas...
---
Wat? This is init's project not ours. GG though.
---
Funny you say that I’m the same way. I have played some but most of the memes go way over my head
---
Do all magic 14 to IV, then to V. It'll only take you a few months if you use cheap implants and bonus remap for intelligence and the other attribute which I forgot and you'll be able to play around with most fittings you'll find in the IoT.
---
Uhmmm goons are on the fort km AND on this list? You seem to be confused.  Orrrr are we doctoring images? On the internet??
---
я во сне
---
Common man, reread what was said. This is everyone they batphoned last time.
---
They're still around under the name 'Snuffed Out'. Project Wafflebox is no more, with Project Mayhem folding into snuffed out.
---
the list was the previous timer.
---
The only solution CCP could make would be pretty drastic.
---
Instead of having X number of global orders, we could instead have X number of per-station/citadel market orders.  
---
That gives everyone a significant incentive to populate more systems with manufacturable goods, and unthinkably, actually gets them undocked.  Non-manufacturable goods, and those of similar classification will still be clustered in the 2-3 main hubs of course.  The prices in the other eight thousand stations will become more competitive, but nothing like what the bots are fighting over right now.  
---
Also, don't try to fight the bots on pricing, it's a losing battle.  Just use isk to alter the supply of a vulnerable market category.  If we had more hubs, and more daylight between them, both pumping and dumping would be even more viable.
---

Sounds like the plan worked. GFs leading up to this, shame you guys passed on last weeks timer. Now we can get back to taking advantage of the blackout! \\o/

---
Bok Bok Bok

*You* replied to me. Why are *you* telling me to let it go? lmao
---
That image is accurate, it's from our discord and I just verified it. That was for Round 2, last week's hull timer.
---
No, not really.
---
Thx ^-^
---
Last week was a diplo issue as INIT was on offence and goons was part of the defence fleet.
---
&gt; To be fair, my twitter is just a mess of cat pictures, stupid fun and food... nothing special hahaha &lt;3

You guys are absolute legends.
---
He’s gotta live up to the name!
---
It's hard to turn down an invitation to shoot Snuffed Out.
---
Indeed, keeps us busy.
---
Wait until you find out what they did to rorquals...
---
Yes, you set it to 'Active Overview Filter' and then just swap your overview to whatever you want to dscan.
---
You really think someone would do that?  Just go on the internet and tell lies?
---
Hm, Yeah. The new guy doesn't have a place in null sec, and never has. I think that a few players working together (like a 3-5 man corps) with only a few months in the game can field the firepower to clear pirate bases and fortresses as well as 6/10, and even 7/10, DED sites using non-perfect skills so long as they have basic coordination. T1 battle cruisers and t1 battleships with logi support can go pretty far.   
---
You can live off that, pretty well in fact I think. 4-60 million isk in bounties to hit one of those sites plus the drops (which can be worth double that or more when you have some luck). You might be able to pull that off in someone elses sov with local, but it's a hell of a lot easier to pull off with local in delayed mode.   
---
You wanna do things without permission? Well, I also think you can pull those off solo with a t1 battleship so long as you have your head on straight and your fit is half decent, so a bit of scanning about, some jumps, and there's your 40 million isk payout for the hour. 
---
Don't know that I would recommend doing it, but that kind of thing is *more* of an option now for the people that wanna try to do it. It's also a lot less mindless than VNI ratting havens.   
---
Taking out a t1 battleship as a newer player makes you a pretty big target, but without local, you're (once again) harder to kill so long as you're trying not to be. You can mwd/cloak a t1 BS and you might even be able to just blow through some of the weaker gate camps (although, if you went out in a scanning ship to find the site then you should already know where the gate camps are).   
---
Just an idea man, it's what I would try now if I were them. CCP increased the spawn chance of DED sites recently I think, so it's more viable now than ever and you even get the chance to get some sweet blue loot and faction BPCs in the process. You only gotta scan down one DED site per hour to make it work.   
---
We apparently have hundreds (maybe thousands) of players either unsubbing or coming back to the game over how much a meta change "local chat" is, what I meant by meta defining.     
---
"Just rent" is the "join" side in "join or die". Always and option, but it's one that most people aren't interested in. Null alliances have shitty reputations, as a whole, that actually matters.   
---
My corp is a mining/indy one, and we've been asked if we wanna rent a couple of times in the past two months. Always turned em down, rather take my chances in wh space to get the bonuses I need from null sec rather than answer a cold-call from a null alliance. I actually view wh space, where there's no asset safety and the entrance moves every day, as the safer and more stable option than trusting a random dude from null sec.   
---
Would a null alliance fuck me over if I rented from them? Probably not, but they would charge me more than the "free" I pay for wh space and they have fucked people over before.  Maybe if I knew some of them, but I don't.   
---
They're the jaded elite who only mingle with their own kind to the rest of us. It's not because they all try to be that way, it's just that enough of them do act that way. Like I said, I have found them to all be really cool to people who go out there and at least *try* to play Eve in null sec, but the hate they get from high sec is important. You can't convince some newer players to even give null a try, dealing with this right now in regards to wh space. Some people, you need to lead them out there and let them realize that they themselves have become a null sec (or a wh) player before they won't fear it. How people work.   
---
Making day tripping safer, it'll help me take people out there for their first try. It'll help me give them the confidence to try it again, and again, and again, till before they realize it, it's why they play Eve.
---
I've heard about the botting epidemic that's apparently gotten a lot of worse.  Once upon a time, it seemed like it was a lot easier to spot/ban bots and/or exploit their behaviors for an easy kill.

I was fascinated early on by some of the culture of Eve players. One of my alliance members told me about the monument. Never thought I would anchor a can there, but I did. It made me feel better, to include an old friend in my passion of new Eden. I'm glad something like this would mean enough to the developers to make a fixture for their players. To show the lore of new Eden is touched by it's player base.
---
Yes, but if you only want a focused alt (eg. PI, market, research, etc.) then MCT for a few months is better than two accounts forever, though skill extraction may make that redundant now - if you can run the second account free after finishing training.

Playing it alone the learning curve is massive. But if you manage to find other players to play with its not as bad. And feeling totally lost in a huge universe can be fun if you have people guiding you.

I feel like that's where black ops/cloaky play shines the most, it's not so much a solo activity as it is a strategic one. Catch a ratter with a pilgrim, lock them down, jump your panther in, nuke and gtfo before anyone can respond.
---
I wanna use drones for pvp lol. Turns out it's time to skill into actual weapons lol
---
What's your fit?
---
This list forms about 200 sub caps.  Fair game tho, too bad it wasnt a fight we could take today.
---
Well that's depressing.
---
well exhumers /barges are still better in mining exept the orca is shitfit with papier thin tank. the real magic is in a fleet with at least one orca and many barges (if alpha frigates) around it . because no mining boost effect the orca / drones it only helps others.
---
If someone is good at combat scanning, you won't have a lot of time to react. You'll see the probes on scan for maybe 3-4 seconds tops  before they're on top of you if they do it right. 
---
Also you'd be surprised at the amount of idiots that gate capitals, or even undock nyx'es with no jump fuel from an asset safety system. Or engage to bash a structure using ratting fit nidhoggurs.
---
Trust me I'm still getting used to the idea that not everyone is good at the game myself, lmao.

Anything worth seeing in the New Eden system and it's constellation? Any good lore?

you'd think dread posting would die down with sash joining their ranks, but alas it persists. You were not expecting the same as that pic, because the majority of what could form from that list was your side's batphone.
---
You must be new here?
---
they introduced a ship that combined max tank, max yield, max utility, a compression array, and a jump drive in to one ship, and it can fit a cyno.
---
apparently nobody saw anything wrong with that.
---
lol the "market guy" that "manipulates at a high level" gave me a huge laugh on a bad day.
---
Okey, I took that too far. Not everything will be based on luck and I was specifically talking about the no local. When you no longer have local and d-scan doesnt cover everything Rorquals for instance can lose their excavators (which cost 3b/set) without any form of counter. Atm you are defenseless against that and you can only hope that they go for someone else or miss, i.e., its a chance factor rather than the results of your own skill/knowledge. This used to occur before aswell but you pulled in drones when you saw neuts in system (the attentive ones atleast).
---
So right now many have stopped using them all together which makes the ship more or less useless. 
---
And this goes for the other side as well, its perhaps not about luck for them but hunting doesnt longer require patience/skill/knowledge. Its just the wild west where anyone can do anything (within limits). Some would argue thats the point of null but conveniently forget that the risk has to go both ways, atm hunters have very low risk high reward whilst NS has high risk low reward.
---
Life in space is supposed to be hard. Didn't you see the space Pope's presentation? Everything in space is, will and should try to kill us. You're probably in an alliance for crying out loud! Why else would you be in nullsec prior to the blackout? Try playing solo in wormhole space or lowsec. That will give you some perspective. You're supposed to outsmart or outgun the enemy or a combination of both. You should mix it up if you find yourself lacking ambition. NOT telling you what to do, just my HO.

So they're pretty much the same then?
---
I would but for you to fight me I need to log in first😱
---
but does the primae?
---
double stab, no rigs, no cyno, that's not a risk its suicide by stupidity.
---
on a fit that shit why even bother? you're already going to look brain damaged just for undocking it.
---
I get your point. Im not knocking it and its an interesting take on it. And no doubt, no local has its benefits. Thing is, I actually like it you know. Its just that its not gonna be beneficial in the long run. Imo ofc, I dont see any way this is going to actually improve the game, I just see more of the old.
---
I see smaller groups dying out, I see empires becoming stronger and I see it becoming very hard to actually implement good changes. Because if this no local becomes permanent, you can imagine what would happen when the real nerfs are due. People will lose their shit on a massive scale and ragequit for sure.
---
Which is sad, that makes real change impossible. All because of a slight benefits today. So even tho I personally actually like it, since Im not really at the receving end of it, I know its gonna be a netloss for the game.
---
ALWAYS
---
Woosh woosh!

Then how can you comment if you have no idea how it actually works and what risks it involves?

Sorry.. how is this fighting carebears?  It rewards everyone
---
Its hyperbole the same as the original commenter. He implied that pvers wanted true risk free uninterruptible ratting, and since it was a stupid extreme I laid out the reverse for PVPers, risk free guaranteed super kills.
---
"Not what this game was about". Weird i thought eve has always been marketed as a sandbox mmorpg. Go on though tell me more about what eve was meant to be.  
---
Also, "new players are choking the game" lulwut get a clue dude. New players are the only thing keeping eve alive. Why do you think ccp works so hard attracting new players.

"spot some action in local"

I hate how so many of these arena multiplayer games are called "MMOs". As though Bog-Standard Korean P2W Arena Game #5215 was in anywhere the same league as EVE, WoW, or GW2.

so, you thought, what an easy kill...u should have looked at my history first. i have been in the game since the beta and have LOTS of friends.

---
Unsub? I've resubbed a few accounts, actually. And yes, I have quite a few years of salt of my own that dissolves a little bit more every time I see nullbears bitch about the recent changes. From posts here and on the forums, it seems to be the newer players rage quitting over a move that adds more realism and potentially livens up the sandbox. It's not us that are the ones complaining anymore, maybe you should unsub😂
---
Is your VNI magical or what? Its not carriers dude, chill a bit with the hyperbole.

&gt; the extra SP is honestly a good incentive with all the returning vets and newbros hitting the game

This is what I was thinking too. A treat for the returning peeps.

Interesting that you a quote words I never said. I never even said that empire building "wasn't what this game is about", I actually talked about other play styles and players who have been thrown by the wayside to pander more to newer carebears, something that they're thankfully trying to reverse. 
---
The game has absolutely stagnated, and a *certain* type of new players attracted by current mechanics and meta absolutely are choking the game, you'd have to be retarded not to see it. 
---
New players aren't and haven't been offsetting loss of old players, no matter how much ccp has tried to tweak the NPE. It's a 16 year old game with a firmly established history and community, it's not going to suddenly take off and be the next apex legends lmao. There just happens to be a lot more potential in getting players to return than only focusing on getting new players in by rounding the corners off of everything, and it seems that CCP might finally be realizing that since trying to up new player retention has been a failure. It's very clear that more people are alienated by the new meta than are attracted to it, so yea I can say that the types of new players who are transforming eve into something unsustainable and causing the total population to nosedive due to their stagnant playstyle are a net negative, not a positive. 
---
Interestingly, Goons followed that logic when they literally *declared war* on a playstyle (hisec mining), saying that low risk industrial corps were siphoning off all the new players and ultimately turning them off due to the staleness of that style of play proliferating to that extent. Now it's Goons and the couple other nullblocs clutching their pearls about how #allplaystylesmatter, just like the hisec bears of old. People got over it, shit changed, it'll change again. 
---
Growth is good, but this will never be fifa. Ccp needs to stop chasing casual space fans (given the inherent nature of this game even down to the UI, unless they want to release eve 2) especially with so many titles in that genre currently out, the richest vein for them to mine is the huge reserve of on and off or former players eyeing what they're currently doing with glee.
---
Honestly, my implants will probably look like that until the servers die or my meatspace body does. I never think about them until I happen to get one as a mission reward or see some spares from the latest career training run.
---
No. The keyword is "massively"
---
Dude, no local is not a good way to increase risk, it is an atombomb under your ass kinda change. Just a pure blanket core mechanic change that is as useful as using a screwdriver to hammer nails.
---
An overhaul, as you say is needed instead, and this has been said by lots of people without CCP giving a shit. If you lower the amount of people who can live in a system from the current maybe 100 in all TZs down to maybe 20 you will force people to spread out. That will make intel weaker, umbrellas weaker and even the aspect of being in a megaalliance weaker. Just strip the benefits of being in a big alliance and all there is left are disadvantages. People will start to leave and perhaps join smaller alliances and other places like WHs and LS.
---
This is how you increase risk and its honestly fairly easy to do. No local will do the exact opposite since it doesnt increase risk in that sense, it just straight up changes the rules.
---
Think the Bot is calling you a mug bud
---
Best bot
---
The % sure went down!
---
&gt;Honestly though, if it makes people login
---
Just making people "log in" achieves nothing - except, of course, keeping the PCU numbers high to show shareholders how "good" the game is doing.
---
I don't know how fucking stupid you'd have to be to think dailies are good for the game. They're the opposite, it's a sign the game is doing badly and the devs are trying every shitty dirty trick in the book to keep up apperances.

What is the reason for these battles? Just curious.

I didn't private it initially but I added a link to a channel on the r/eve discord labeled 'local' for the duration. You probably hit it in the ~10 minutes it didn't have the link.
---
Mine in low-sec if it worries you so much.
---
Dunno ask someone from init.
---
That nerd barely beat me out on karma. Mr. "I snipe CCP devblogs" smh.
---
Imagine thinking about posting this, then actually posting it.
---
Seems kinda silly tbh. I'm laughing because people in INIT/Goons are usually the first to say "go to lowsec if you want small gang or less caps." Then I see stupid shit like this and it makes me lose faith in this game.
---
Perhaps, but your first statement was utterly wrong.
---
This is truly awesome
---
Hah, I'm wearing the same shirt while reading this.
---
It was a content fort from the beginning.  We didn't stage out of it and seldom used it for cap ops if we needed the extra range that Korasen provided.
---
Get your facts straight before opening your mouth.
---
You are just repeating yourself and failing to understand. Eve players laugh at pre-arranged fights and faux wars. You want to fight other pvpers, but only with a, a good reason. That reason used to be POS warfare, now it is enemy pve activity and the occasional citadel.
---
There are blue seals, I thought they were all kinda greyish?
---
Huh, TIL. They kinda cute though, not scary really🤷
---
Come fite me
---
plenty did, took a lot of reeeee just to reduce the yield and then reduce the invulnerability time, and then the tank. and it still has max tank, max yield, max utility, a compression array, and a jump drive.
---
we need more reeeeee
---
&gt; Lol, you are pushing a narrative which suits your agenda 
---
You may know those words, but don't know when you should you them. Yes? Why wouldn't i push it? 
---
It is in my interests to see nullbears losing their security bubble.
---
The funny part however, that actual players who do for example complexes, relics and so on in null should love less security as well and only botters and almost\_botters have a reason to whine.
---
CCP saw what too much security is not a good way to go, now, if they will see a positive reaction (and there is plenty)and more returned players (i bet a lot came back), i hope they will stay on this path.

Low sec and high sec have local and you can mine and rat there all you want.

I guess because it's obvious to the rest of eve that those two blocks only fight alongside goons when it comes to ncplph...

In both cases joining an ongoing cold war on the goon side after being attacked by yours...

Basically fuck you krab, adapt or die fam. HTFU. Can i haz ur stuffz after u leave brav?
---
CCP making changes to the game is a good thing. Some changes have a positive affect on your playstyle, some have a negative affect.
---
When I started training a maxed ECM specialist I also had no idea that CCP would change it to a taunt mechanic (not that ECM ships weren't primary before).
---
Living in sov null has many advantages like being able to build supers/titans, neverending anomalies and belts, cyno beacons, jump bridges, etc.
---
Now CCP has decided that these advantages come at the cost of no local.
---
I had three toons skilling into Rorqs when the recent nerfs hit.  On this occasion, CCP is trying to combat bots and responding to the uprising of the customer base against bots from a little while back.  Although these changes aren't positive for everyone, and some people might feel 'punished', CCP does seem to be trying to respond to these issues in the best interests of the game/community.
---
Yes it is possible

[My P4 lane](https://i.imgur.com/riza9Fz.png) you need a launchpad and a storge unit.

Put enough stuff in the launchpad and make a "Extended Transfer" to the Storage unit an refill the launchpad with the rest stuff of a 24h production run.

Don´t forget to route correctly from the Launcpad and the Storage Unit to your Fabs

---
Highsec - lowest risk, concord to deal with people attacking each other without valid provocation. Lowest isk income.
---
Lowsec - Step up in risk, no concord to save you. 
---
Nullsec - No gate guns even to help you fight off attackers. Bubbles are allowed. The game makes no assurances of your safety here. You and your group have to provide all of it for yourself. Thus it has the highest payouts.
---
The problem with this paradigm rears its ugly head when there's no reason to spread out, to take space. And is compounded by how hard it is for attackers to actually take space with mechanics surrounding it very heavily favoring the defenders.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Lul i am no bot and stopped ratting too - dont wanna loose my ship.
---
bro we had a fucking live stream nearly 24/7 of every BL fleet and those dumb cunts still robbed the doughnut store during the local PD shift change
---
Well this subreddit keeps screeching about eve tanking so \o/
---
The problem is, that EVE doesn't provide a good ingame method to keep track of each miner.
---
So you either have to use out of game to tools to analyze the fleet log or the mining ledger or come up with other ways to split the value of the mined goods.
---
Most of the time, everyone running their own Orca/Rorqual is just the easiest thing to do things (if you have alts, you can of course bring them and use the fleet hangar of your Orca).
---
Yes, I would also prefer having a fleet with a dedicated booster and a dedicated hauler.
---
TAPI = Test Alliance Please Ignore.
---
sperg = rambling like drunk toddlers.
---
Wait, they blued Goons *and* PL?
---
We need to get rid of excavs and tone down the bonus yield from the Indy core.
---
There's no way it should be outmining a boosted exhumers, at all, ever.
---
just get it some new clothes
---
What happened to unguarded relic and data sites in wh c1 to c3? I cant find anu of them, only forgotten and unsecured.
---
 classic
---
OP, any comments on his ship fit?
---
Maybe not being a dick is a good place to start?
---
Maybe they could combat bots by banning them, instead of changing game mechanics that end up fucking legit players more than bots?
---
Like, a bot is already automating evening so they're going to be spamming dscan - for a player this is just a tedious and repetitive task that adds 0 value to your game session.
---
The best was one time in a roam me and some friends got wrecked in. We got a group that sent me one of those forms to fill out. I filled it out completely then proceeded to have a super formal discussion over where my corpse would be interred for all time. 
---
Good times.
---
No, they are not happy only with this. They started with no local, 1,2,3 checked. Now they want to nerf supers, titans, anomalies, cyno inhib one constellation at a time, and other bunch of bullshit mechanics ideas, like people don't have anything to do this summer. They just expect to form a 15 man nano fleet or go into bombers bar NPSI, and kill everything on grid regardless is FAX, Supers, Titans or 19 rorquals. Just hit and run, with no risk. Just like in any politics , extremes are bad news either if it's far right or far left, is just as bad. Same with the guys advocating agressively for nolocal, same with the other guys which are pissed off and threatning to quit. 
---
What i see nowadays and it's not new, only Snuffed Out and Pandemic Horde have the balls to drop a dreadbomb in hostile space (even in Delve) to kill stuff. Others are just whining because they can't kill shit except VNIs with their frigate fleets or "always that one stupid guy" which gates a shitfit vendetta. 
---
As i said before, this will benefit only the big alliances. We will still hotdrop on you if you tackle a super, we will still form 150 dudes to kill your shit, with local or nolocal. And we still do mining ops with 10 Rorquals backed by FAXes and Titans on standby.
---
 The only difference now is that standing fleet comms is full of people.
---
PS: not all people krab for RMT or inject into a Titan pilot. For example, i like to build stuff, as much as i like to PvP and get killed and kill stuff. Building stuff makes feel i am contributing to something to the Eve in-game community. I mined my own Nyx, it took forever (1 rorq + 1 hulk), i got bored to shit out if it and ended up paying 2 bil for the rest of the minerals i needed. Now i'm thinking to get into reactions area, i never did them, they seem challenging with all the bits and pieces formulas you need to do.
---
Hold my beer....
---
The kiddies down voting your response haven't a clue how great EVE ***was*** and how hollow it is now.
---
Imagine skipping the first step
---
You say that but Corebloodbrothers often funded shiny fleet SRP out of the earnings of his market alt.
---
Market trading if it has a cap, has the highest earning potential and there are people, who run armies of alts that then put out hauling contracts, to push the markets in their favour. (If you ever ran freighters between the trade hubs seeing the same names then you would have a glimpse at what I am talking about.)
---
Cyno condor, was afk burning in space 3.5k (because docking is for scrubs like nc you know), I managed to catch him.
---
because CCP decided the CSM wasn't where they needed to get their ideas and instead they came here to r/eve where theres a very loud minority who don't think past their own noses on how things effect the bigger picture and screech REE local and REE bots at everything.
---
punish me, daddy
---
What is you looking for are : Brave Newbie, Pandemic Horde or Karmafleet. 
---
These are new player friendly corps/alliance and have plenty of tools and people that will be happy to teach you the basis.
---
Oh yesssss
---
If only he got kills like the gif made it look
---
Never ever remove asset safety CCP
---
Ahaha nice, that's the roleplay I'd love to see. I have a conts in Jita named Corpusarium (Morrowind reference) where I just stash em all minus duplicates. I think I have 3k+ but those are obviously not all my kills..
---
&gt;"Highsec corp...with a spy in every alliance"
---
lol...no
---
I like the commentary and agree with the retreating into smaller, heavily defended enclaves.  Then, I thought on a but further forward (because nothing is forever) and could see the community wanting NullSec to spread out and ease up a bit again to make Null more accessible.
---
I don't know for certain but I believe that the blackout has vastly reduced the botting.  A lot of the bots use local and will need a bit of time to be reprogrammed to use D and for botters to patch and get out there again.  Our daily fleet roams to all parts of null initially had a huge drop in content which has slowly trickled back over the weekend and this week - maybe patching is already finishing.  Still some bots out but it feels like a lot less than pre-blackout.
---
Anyway, I like the change.  Blackout is like a new patch unto itself.  Not in the way Azeroth was permanently disfigured by the sundering (accepting downvotes for WoW reference) but a change in PvP and PvE gameplay to adapt to for however long it lasts.
---
As the bots adapt, I wonder if disruption of D will be the next change coming.  Even if game Dev was to be led by botters', these sorts of gameplay changes can be fun for anyone who is playing for new challenges.  I prefer them to new ships, extra SP or periodic mining/ratting events - I appreciate the extra SP but it is things like the change in local that actually changes my gamestyle and brings new light/life to the game.
---
Woah... I'm mad at your friend for botting but at the same time... That's just impressive on so many levels.
---
Go Eve University its a neutral Corp that does not hold nor fight for Null Sec sov this means when you move on to a Corp of your choice you will not be barred from joining as you are coming from the wrong side of a Null Sec Bloc alliance. They also have different campuses in all flavours of space so you can try them all before deciding to buy the one you prefer.
---
So many of the comments in this thread are utterly pathetic and uncouth.
---
Probably one of the best indicators of how far EVE is down the toilet; that it attracts players like these.
---
So your arguement is that all systems should have the same risk ratio, regardless of the reward?
---
Well you can never have too much tank in EVE.
---
RL? Are you playing it? Do you need a 3rd guy for 3s ? :-)
---
It really wasnt though.  Small gang hunters have only seen constant buffs since 2009, your lack of skill prevents seeing this via the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect.
---
This is the standard fit that dies to our bait vni's.
---
As a pilot, with the most "kills" done in a Scimitar: 
---
That must have taken *ages* to grind them down.
---
I see no difference.
---
is that what you have to do to finally get some content? I'd love to have people chase me all over New Eden
---
I'll have you know some of my best friends are cartoons.
---
It's true that most PvP people go for the second best option if they don't find a fight in a system, because attacking a PvE ship might get you a response you can fight.
---
If you don't get a response, you at least get a killmail and maybe a fight the next time because people don't want to lose their PvE ships again.
---
There are a couple groups that ruin this though:
---
* Groups that only care about their green killboards, which usually don't stay around for a fight, because they hunt in regions where no fights happen
---
* Groups that have no interest in fighting at all, which ironically results in them getting slapped around by the group mentioned above
---
* Groups that respond with overwhelming force every time, resulting in the first group avoiding them and the second group eventually joining them
---
I have a script that will iterate pages and auth sso in power query if you want a sample, let me know.  I feel like it would be hypocritical of me not to share it with you.
---
Shit man, please share the track name. Solo guitar was awesome
---
Extract all, sell half. Cost neutral.
---
Upgrade at any time and you can claim Omega rewards. I claimed alpha then upgraded and got Omega right away for day 1
---
Depositing an abyssal mod in the structure has a 0.001% chance to create a "\[Dead player name\]'s modified" version of it (stats somewhere between faction and deadspace). Only one per player, always gets destroyed on ship death.
---
Come to Mercomesier
---
I am not sure that’s true, my experience can only be likened to chasing squirrels. Hunters pop up, get spotted, half a dozen people chase them, then about a 20% chance of a fight but more likely , hunters bugger off - occasionally with a bit of smack in local. Chase hunters for a bit, go back to a decent location, tether, wait for the next lot to turn up, rinse repeat. 
---
Horde used to get far more “ good fight” content content just by having the decent attitude of not dropping caps on every roaming gang that came to visit us. 
---
Having said that I am quite enjoying the blackout. I worry that I will eventually burnout a bit on the squirrel hunting though.
---
Also much more of them died
---
'his'
---
Also, only mcav uses gimp solo dreads.
---
IMHO, people are telling newbies to join Corp not to force them into some sort of social gameplay, but to make their acclimatization period smoother cuz Eve even in its current state is extremely unfriendly to newbies.
---
I am somewhat impressed that all of Eve seems to have adopted to the CODE definition of "botting".   
---
Even though I do not condone it I think people on r/Eve seem to be quick to make a bot sometimes
---
Incredible that you can't see the cost you just described. Lol
---
I got 1. Bjornbee has many
---
Are you the same nikoli that says dumb shit on praise bob and gets mocked for a dead corp?
---
So how many times have his friends hunted you down so far?
---
Pospy optimising static krabbing? I'm shocked
---
2x extractors is 1 injector if I buy 10 extractors and sell 5, that covers the cost of all 10
---
Like being a toddler again. 
---
Dont ever grow up.
---
I get constantly attacked by gate rats ever since
---
“ I don’t play the game anymore but ...”. Your input is invalid and we don’t care.
---
Well then I'm gonna say, hahaa, joke's on you, I was merely pretending to be retarded.
---
CCP add killmarks Battle Porpoises need to be a thing. Null Sec roam would be outstanding and kinda cute imagine the killmails. Also can we get this as a skin for them.

---
True and wrong.. Yeah bots will adapt and use dscan.. But they cant tell if its a blue or red ship they see on dscan..
---
Its in his name
---
Well it is called “massiv” because there nearly as many player in a single server as in eve , just they have multiple
---
you forgot to mention a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
100% Independent  
---
We have got a lot of returning vets with big alliance experience behind them. This in turn means that they still have a alt toon in that alliance because why cull your Super inactive members right.
---
theres multiple options,  pandemic horde, karma fleet, brave and tests corp (whose name escapes me atm)
---
Throw and  alpha into each and find the corp that has the attitude and is right for you
---
Hello, 
---
LEFTCO Traffic Report Squad here. We agree with you.
---
Stealing my wife's CC and blaming it on the 7 year old 😜
---
LEFTCO Camera Man: "See down here, salt is a way of life."
---
As much as I wanna think that this guy is trolling, the saddest of truths is that he probably isn't... What's *wrong* with Eve players?
---
That is our aim. Its to bring the fun back into the game. We don't care about killboards and so losing 5 ships and only getting 1 kill is cool with me. As long as we learning and improving. Everyone knows that if you in a fleet, we going to die.
---
well you could bump them, but it would only lead to them just taking control of the citadel for future streams
---
Reminds me when our pair of drifting dreads got blobbed by nestors and bhaalgorns, they repped to hell and we died in a blaze of misery XD
---
LEFTCO Helicopter pilot: "We're getting reports. Yes. Yes it's true. Some idiot lost a 1.7billion isk pod due to the LEFTCO Traffic Report. Traffic is dying down, much like the pod did."
---
indeed.
---
Well they probably need those titans and fleet numbers to feel that they are good at pvp
---
LEFTCO anchorman: "I do know. I will keep doing it. I'm Ron Burgundy."
---
We going to get some training from a wingspan spy in our corp so we can get better at this. We will be back.
---
LEFTCO Hotter than you'll ever be anchorwoman: "He doesn't Frankenclient. He's all man. All 12 inches."
---
He was a Beta player, so that is Beta salt
---
:D
---
LEFTCO Van driver: "KWGibbs REX DIX"
---
I also happen to know a guy who can multiply it by 0, giving a very sweet profit. He also live just 4 jumps from jita.
---
because we where only 6 bombers we had to be very picky about where to setup. if we go to where it was super busy we would just get blobbed and die. I feel we had a good taster system where they feel safe and snug but we will be doing this a lot more.
---
LEFTCO Secretary: "Making us wait is rude, but getting the info to us quicker...won't stop us. Eat a big ole cold coney from Sonic and ask for lots of salt on top."
---
All they have to do is make a book mark well within docking range and set their ship to approach the spot and unless they are sitting there in a cap you aren't going to bump them anywhere near far enough to de-tether.
---
Back when I used vnis I always waited aligned for them to land on my site and warp out cause when I roamed, even if I didn't caught anything, beeing able to land on a anom while the vni was warping out was somehow better than 30 systems of nothing. When I died it was mostly because I was warping to a site and forgot to orbit or straight afk. Best thing is to go on a bio break and comeback to a slightly damaged still ratting vni, that just soloed killed a roamer.
---
LEFTCO Inspector: "It's like he watches the stream or knows the plight of a miner who streams."
---
Yeah me too I'm surprised that while largely outnumbered with supercap on grid they didn't come to feed to you
---
We have done 41 people in a structure bash before when we took over a C1 WH to see if we could. So numbers are not the issue but yeah we will do it again as it was fun.
---
"OK ... you can stay over there for the day, and you can sleep there ... hey hey hey hey ... don't touch that ... shoosh" :D
---
ISDs would load the game and stage from Jovian space. It is basically more boring and less maintained than regular EVE systems.
---
LEFTCO Dog, "RUFF" ::Translation:: SCOOBY DOOBY DOOOOOOOO
---
Null sec should always have been high risk - high reward scenario if you want to krab. Instead, people had turned it into giant farmlands with little or no risk which was wrong in the first place. I'm not saying that what we have now is the optimal solution but it's a step in the right direction.
---
There are multiple reasons for someone not to do anything on his client for 20-30m, like waiting for fatique to tick down when moving a cap
---
That wig really suits you. Keep it for cold winter days.
---
Official Goonswarm statement: "I honestly don't care"
---
i see 2 opposite things here:
---
 "Also, its tough to pvp anything when everyone within 10 jumps docks up because of shit like near2 "
---
So you were trying to gank miners immobilized in industrial mode or ratters. These guys were docking on NEAR2 signals, not PvPers. I was glad to see it on intel and grab a sabre and a cynabal on gate to have some fun.
---
And still you don't see it. Lol
---
there are "few things" to do in this game : https://english.eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg  
---
Some of them are omega only (subscription) but you can do a lots of thing while being F2P.  
---
IMO, as a new player, you have to try severals gameplays before to specialize
---
&gt;Free SP is free SP
---
it means absolutely nothing if you are quitting the game. 
---
ps can i have your stuff
---
Your argument is circular. You're saying that you have to do the status quo, because it's the status quo.
---
&gt; i have no way to play without being deleted
---
press v occasionally. ive escaped every single attempt against my ratting ship
---
Sure you can. Send me ISK and I’ll quadruple it for you at no charge.
---
But we've completely eliminated assistance benefits of allies in a war not being able to repair eachother.
---
Should probably make it so you can merge wars then instead.
---
Example:
---
Group A has declared war on B and C
---
Group B &amp; C decide to merge the war so they can be allies, as they are both "defenders".
---
same war
---
I was looking for this comment
---
oh right, i forgot you totally know who I am or what I do in game
---
maybe this will sound weird but i like getting chased. pvp is cool, fleet fights are cool, pve is relaxing, but what really gets me excited is when i catch a stiletto or sabre on dscan and and warp off just before they lock me.
---
So we gona lose intacts in stain or they modify materials needed for trimarks?
---
Yes. New Eden is the first system humans found they ventured forth through the EVE Gate. As such, the Gate is still visible from across the system. It's quite a sight.
---
KarmaFleet is recruiting.
---
We have loads of people that was in null and have come back to high sec to just enjoy the game. I think the constant spam of fleets going out and feeling you need to be in them otherwise your corp gets a bad name for not turning up is a factor to this.
---
Null Alliances = Lots of content but you a number  
---
Small Corps = more focused and personal.
---
I guess it just depends on your personality and also time. When you in your thirties and have family and kids, its not easy to get up at 3am to hit a timer.
---
you are full of shit, in WH you can have hole control. In a C5 you roll everything and don't warp to the new sig. Some free time for krabbing dank blue loot with dual dreads, right ? 
---
In nullsec you can't have gate control everywhere and you still have to manage wandering holes where you can have visitors like BB, Inner Hell, Krypton Gaming and other roamers and roll them out. I am not even counting Drifer Holes which are hard to roll because these guys are one shotting everything. 
---
The only option now is to krab in full PvP fit.
---
0.05
---
Oh wait, fuck!
---
When it changes over, please back-up the details of all the cans that are already there just in case something goes wrong...
---
Back to Osmon with me!
---
I mean if people want to bridge 100 dudes onto a vni that’s really up to them.
---
Dude there have been some great kills during the blackout. Killing a shit fit renter ratting carrier is I am sorry to say not one of them.
---
I'm too busy rolling my null static sorry + hs farming is boring af!
---
Are rote now an independent sov holding alliance?
---
Hoo boy i wish this can happen, i would definitely like to be a bounty hunter in eve 😕

Show us on the doll where the evil Goons touched you.
---
Then the measures introduced to have "danger" in the presence of local can be removed, no being stuck when activating industrial core or nsa?
---
Did you actually go and check that stats? Asking for a friend.
---
Hard to say what is the CCP plan for this.      
---
But shield race giving armor salvage ... and having armor modules in the "loot table" will look strange.          
---
CCP can do the lazy way and just change implants leaving the rest for "later" aka look at this again after 4 years.
---
I'll bite. What exactly is the bigger picture here that you're referring to. I'm more than happy to read a patronising/ELI5 essay in order to be convinced.
---
I can ping my Corp of 70 "little bees" and get 50 in fleet. If you could only get 20 from a 35k alliance I think the problem was probably you. Most peacetime welp fleets get 100ish.
---
Just goto read your post history bae
---
That’s like saying “you’re not allowed to come to my birthday party” to your childhood bully. It won’t make him change his mind about you

pretty good still. im at 10 mil lp and every time i undock to do one more mission i puke.

You look just like my cousin dave, he is a massive bogan.
---
Welcome to bogan club.
---
First rule of bogan club is you dont talk about bogan club.
---
You sound upset, tell us what happened.
---
Mate you understand that the less PLEX costs in ISK the more people will buy it therefore people will purchase PLEX which is 5$ more than monthly omega. Therefore the more the PLEX drop the more money CCP makes. Now comes inflation and PLEX will suddenly start going up as more people buy PLEX from the market therefore more people will buy PLEX just to make ISK since inflation made it worth a lot of ISK and people will just buy more and more until the PLEX hits a certain roof, around 1.8b to 2.1b and people will dump all their PLEX for cheap and then not buy more PLEX on the market. Buy orders will drop since there is a lot of PLEX but no one is buying and then in a year or so the market will stabilize and it will happen again.
---
Looks like my trip out there for someone will be during Berlin.
---
vily who?
---
This is impossible to answer for us, not knowing what you can fly and afford. 
---
T1s are dirt easy so you should be able to run them in pretty much anything (both solo frig and solo cruiser). Just ask your corp to loan you a hawk or retri, they're only like 50m holy fuck. If you can't fly those use a pirate frig or cruiser. With decent skills you should be able to solo the t1-3s and pay them back in no time.
---
I have this 30milion for like hmm ... no idea, stopped doing them when burners were introduced.       
---
Actually doing missions each time i need to get new Slave Set for one of my chars.           
---
Filling up the used LP and .... not even talking to agents.

But for all this time i am constantly saying to myself -&gt; i will grind some LP this week :D

Never happen.

wormholer btw?

I can fly a VNI and Light missile kestrel. How can i communicate this better hmmmm.
---
Elo should just form a mutiny within FRT and form his own thing, then take FRT space out from them.  Solve FRT bots in one swoop.  Take away FRT.
---
Post your main
---
Are you really trying to take the position that no local does not significantly hinder the safety of bots?
---
Sorry I should have specified that I produce the P3 on the planet and import the P1.
---
Indeed, hence the word mentality. Just because people think they are elitist doesn't make them worthy of being called elitist. Most simply say the words and dont back it up with action.
---
Yes, because every day when I and thousands others get online, we aren't "playing EVE"
---
Running a corp
---
(Whoever actually thinks this is passive isk: you are wrong and if you run a corp, I feel sorry for your members)
---
I mean 10+ jags is much scarier for nanogangs than 3 carriers or 1 super
---
What on earth are you even talking about ? Small gangs have been buffed considerably by CCP, it is still a very viable type of gameplay. What you are saying is that you cannot find many people who don't have a chance against you, but you have to fight other PvPers that actually fight back, meaning there is risk for you! Now that blackout has occurred, there is more chance of catching people who dont have a chance to fight back against you. It's not HTFU at all, you simply want easy kills rather than engaging other PvPers.
---
You can easly run T2 in solo frigate, any ASF can do it 200-300mill fit no implants.
---
Can confirm:
---
\-Wolf
---
\-Hawk
---
\-Retribution
---
Hawk has a weak spot if it spawns drone BS with anti-missiles turret its almost GG.
---
Dual prop mod retri is op for T2 abyssal.
---
&gt;calls out cloaking instead of multiboxing
---
If you mean usefulness of a pilot because it doesn't have the sp it once had or the time you spend extracting and selling half and then injecting at a net loss of sp those don't count. If the cost is whatever is spent on extractors and it's  recouped by selling half of them leaving the other half free to inject into the new pilot the cost is basically nothing.
---
Free. Free injectors.
---
Heh. I'm good. I just use excel for a final output and/or pivoting (if at all)
---
Though I am curious: Are you paying attention to the pages header, or just getting pages until they're empty? (I'm guessing the latter, because the former doesn't appear to be available)
---
The lawyer god himself mr hyde
---
pic from the future when shield slaves arrive
---
Yes no local makes ganking easier  
---
No local also makes looking for small scale fights harder or even impossible in some cases, especially when you want to respond to people being dropped with subcaps instead of super caps, in general best way to catch the gankers with subcaps was by chasing them system to system until you caught up with them, with no local you waste so much time dscanning the system that theyre already long gone by the time you figure out the systems empty. This leads to the only response being to drop supers on everything that comes through.  
---
The only ships that are worth PVEing in now are super capitals and rorquals, people don't want to use subcaps that get slaughtered easily, this leads to fewer and fewer newer people coming into null so theres less fish in the sea as it were to hunt for. on top of this many people who do PVP pay for their PVP ships with some relatively afk or easy subcap PVE, but again the no local makes it so theres no point in bothering and the option becomes buy PLEX or quit and most are choosing the second option, again leading to less people in space, less targets. Before someone replies to this with the stock "null sec is supposed to be dangerous" response, I know it's supposed to be dangerous, and it damn well is when you're not already in a null bloc, but if you cut out all access to newer players you're going to have issues, there is a lot of null space and not a lot of it is actually occupied in any real capacity and gatekeeping who does and does not get to live there only serves to make it that much more emptier.  
---
No local also penalises people who don't have a supercap umbrella, if they run anything larger than a subcap they will get rinsed by gankers easily with little to no recourse, and the subcaps much like subcaps under an umbrella will still get slaughtered, basically PvE of any kind in a small group is not going to be sustainable, again leading to less people in space, or alternatively they just join one of the established null blocs again increasing the hegemony of null blocs in null sec, those blocs too are already condensed into a handful of systems, which means that a couple months down the line the options for "hunters" will be travelling through hundreds of empty systems before they get to say Delve where they will just get boson'd on entry or they can go to esoteria where again they will get boson'd on entry or basically any of the blocs space. This means there is even less reason to try and strike it out on your own.

People are behind the no local change as its a placebo, the game was stagnant for sure, but no local doesnt positively change things in the grand scheme of things it only benefits the ganker, and to some extent the big null blocs.  
---
A more useful change that could go some ways to fixing some of the issues would be removing supercapitals/excavators from the game, this could help by reducing the amount of isk that is made in a very short time, getting rid of the excavs would make the rorq more use as just a boosting platform so there wouldnt be quite the flood of minerals in the market. Without the supers/titans home defense would be actual work rather than an I win button, It would also encourage people to actually commit in the large scale fights where a lot of the time they're stood down purely because one side brings more titans than the other. This would actually be a change where it closes the gap between the already massively succesful and the newer/smaller groups. Unlike the sudden no local change you CCP could probably even mitigate the amount of sadness that supercapital pilots feel by reimbursing the skillpoints and maybe even some isk compensation for the removal of  them which they can then put back into subcap skills, all that combined would make for more healthy pvp/pve experience, there would be more targets in space and more of a chance of actually getting to have some good honest fleet on fleet action.  They could also look into making resources somewhat finite, or only show up in certain places or migrates around the map, to maybe encourage people to spread out and possibly invade each other.

11h later:
---
Did OP dieded to one of his mercs yet?
---
Inconceivable!
---
AFAIK you bok bok's annoyed someone in Init. (Shines?)
---
Those cynos on literally every ship in lowsec...
---
A clone with +5 implants to maximize training speed. Usually you leave them in a station, something made even easier with citadel clone switching. That being said, some people either forget, don't care, or don't know any better, as seen here.
---
skill give away actually helps new players alot more, they're able to getnew stuff faster, for vets, its like 20 d train time reduced to 19d for one skill.
---
&gt;There's no way it should be outmining a boosted exhumers, at all, ever.
---
why should someone siege it in a belt/anom/etc then?
---
Easy: Why can I build 700 titans in one Sotiyo at the same time
---
So you feel 30 years younger     how where the 80's ?
---
&gt; It really wasnt though. Small gang hunters have only seen constant buffs since 2009
---
lmao, ok. Aside from blackout I have no idea what small gang buffs you are talking about. It has been constant nerfs for years now.
---
&gt; your lack of skill prevents seeing this via the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect.
---
You sound real smart!
---
It's funny seeing everyone get riled up.
---
maybe blobbing and dropping on everything that moves in your jump range choked off most content?
---
It's a pretty personal thing what makes you salty and what doesn't.
---
For me it's mostly how much I fucked up. If I feel like I couldn't have done anything to avoid losing the ship, I'm pretty ok. But if I can blame it entirely on fucking up, I often stay mad for the rest of the day, even if it's just a 10 mil breacher or whatever.
---
I have one in test.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
---
Ohh free skill points nice one, thanks.
---
This is so incredibly wrong. I have been running a corp who fights out numbered and out gunned for years fellow EVE player. I am happy to shoot a ratter to make ISK for my corp, I am happy to have a good fight for fun. What I am not happy is to roam and get [insert capital here] every time I am looking for a fight.
---
Everyone who moans that small gangs always puts us into two categories:
---
a. You don't want a fight you only want ganks!
---
b. You can't get small gang in nullsec, people will always use their caps, they just want to be left alone!
---
Well wtf is it? Because I'd love to get fights, but I consider getting blobbed to fuck more of a fight than getting 2+ FAX &amp; several carriers more unfightable than a blob.
---
So no, what you said is completely off the mark because I will gladly take a fun engagement over a defenseless ratter gank. Also while on the topic of that, most small gang people who do catch a ratter do it because historically it escalates to a fight! Yeah, there's a reason when we catch one we hold it. It isn't to KM whore, it's so the group brings some people to fight back because killing a ratter is only fun for the scout, the rest of the gang is bored.
---
Of course you do... why wouldn’t random highsec mission runners need to know what Nullblocs have planned for them?? 
---
Ur post is an obvious troll...
---
It's funny when people like you think a bot will somehow stop functioning completely because you removed local.
---
Any decision a human can make based on some simple information(i.e. dscan) a bot can make, just faster and with less errors.
---
&gt; This is so incredibly wrong. I have been running a corp who fights out numbered and out gunned for years now, my fellow EVE player. I am happy to shoot a ratter to make ISK for my corp, I am happy to have a good fight for fun. What I am not happy is to roam and get [insert capital here] every time I am looking for a fight.
---
Unfortunately, this is what the blackout will increase. More umbrellas due to the fact that people cant rat without major risk now, more people will simply join the super-alliances and you will get jumped on every time you attack a ratter. That is what the blackout will do.
---
Bot read me like a book.
---
No, I mean any transaction cost value is measured in the  difference in value (ergo not just hard cash) between what you start out with, and what you end up with. 
---
(Nb for this instance I'm ignoring the time used in the transaction as that would be splitting hairs and immaterial) but to say it's nil cost when you omit one major cost is just actually incorrect.
---
Because of the litany of other things the rorqual gets.
---
Yeah because 0laying the game for 11 years must mean i have 1 account with 1 person in high sec.
---
Bot confirmed!
---
Imagine using the phrase "You just want to avoid danger" as some kind of insult.
---
It doesn't even make logical sense.
---
The hardest words are always worth the wait.
---
Eyes forward definitely needs to be in there somewhere I think, perhaps even engraved on the actual structure.  I also think those that created and maintain this monument should be mentioned "in thanks from a grateful community".
---
One other thought - would it be possible to get a special can/deployable that can project a hologram of a chosen character?  A slightly more formal option than just an ordinary can.
---
Ah so now I'm not a mindless ratter ganker, cool, we can have a discussion!
---
I understand what you're saying, and I don't disagree. I believe that EVE has some major issues that need to be resolved and that blackout while creating an interesting moment in EVE history, is not a solution to the problem.
---
CCP needs to revamp cyno mechanics as it is absolutely absurd that any ship can put one on, let alone capitals. Not to mention cyno inhibs are completely useless since they take 60s to anchor, whereas a cyno is put down instantly and fleet has 10 minutes to figure out what they want to do.
---
As shit as POS's were, citadels are 10x more shit. I'd rather go back to Fozziesov w/ Outposts than the shit we have here. I used to get great fights from entosising an outposts medical/repair facilities. Can't do that anymore. I could go on, but I digress, CCP has boned my play style so many times that even though I know blackout isn't going to ultimately achieve  what I'd like it to do, I'm happy to see something for once that isn't a direct buff to building an empire in null and making it safer.
---
One of these things you do while you have 10 rourquals in the belt, or with blackout, in the Station
---
&gt; The answer to your argument is that over the entirety of this game's history, your "play" style was not what this game was about.
---
You do realize that by CCP's own data, 80% of EVE players solo mission in highsec right?
---
*Your* playstyle is now what this game is about.
---
You guys have never fought a serious fight against goons in years. You are pets following their lead.
---
We don't always agree on many changes EVE gets, but I am sure we all agree on this being an amazing addition to the game.
---
Maybe the cost is the skill injectors we made along the way.
---
Prospect of them fixing it is dark
---
I think they have the endurance
---
Undock? What's that? 🤔😂
---
Shouldn't be a big Venture
---
Lots of friends in... War State Academy?
---
This question makes no sense. No one claims skillpoint handouts fix anything. Actually they only make things worse.
---
The point is, EVE has a problem of sub counts dropping. And rather than address this problem at the source by making a better game that the players actually want to play, CCP resorts to PCU padding with daily login rewards.
---
Which does not fix the problem, only hides it and actually makes it slightly worse since there's plenty of people out there who are disgusted with such pathetic, cheap manipulation.
---
Which is why the next step should be the removal of the overview :)
---
Any botter with one functioning half of their brain will simply make several bots on several accounts nad just rotate them.
---
You know, since the game is free to play and even eats mailinator addresses...
---
I can relate, the capital proliferation is beyond a joke within eve right now. There is very little skill involved in dropping a cap-blob on people and just being F1 monkeys. Small gangs are great fun and should be the backbone of PvP in eve. 
---
I can see your point of view, that the blackout isn't directly against small gangs, in fact, many probably think its in support of small gang fights and so on, when in the long term, its quite the opposite. It will also mean less people in nullsec to kill, less players overall. 
---
I love the idea of this being an event, its great, but the vehemency within which people are pushing for it to become permanent, without looking at the long term implications, is crazy. I love to PvP, I love alliance vs alliance, I enjoy small gang-fights. I also krab, I do some production on the side too. I am, like most people in eve, a multi-faceted player. I do more than one single thing. The blackout has made me unsub my ratters and miners. There is no point in them right now when I can make the same money in empire with less risk. 
---
Cynos need to be changed, there needs to be an instant activation cyno-inhib, possibly with less health than the one we have now, which has a 70s timer on it (And a limit of only one per XKM of space), allowing for a second, increased health, greater range cyno inhib to be placed. This allows for plays and counter players. 
---
The blackout is great for a week event, permanent will kill the game.
---
The demo was supposed to crash while collecting data. They increased server load with bots until that happened, but would rather do it with players only.
---
Wtf is this, some procedurally generated bot shitpost?
---
&gt; CCP should remove drones from the game entirely,
---
yes
---
So the salt is not fully released?
---
SWA though an NPC corp, has a significant organizing force, and they regularly do fleets all over.
---
Glad we see eye to eye, I appreciate you having a civil discussion with me rather than spewing vitriol as many people on this sub do. Here's to hoping for a better EVE tomorrow o7
---
He seems "Moody" in a "Major" way.
---
haHaHa this is fucking awesome
---
Just as a tip, the CSM's been talking about local and perfect intel with CCP for years.
---
Caldari Militia: am I a joke to you?
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding.
---
How many skill points do you own before, and how many do you own after (assuming training stands still while you do the transfers)?
---
Oooh is this the thread where I get my excuses in for why my team is losing HARD?
---
In the last 2 month; i killed 2 times high grade clone for 2.7b . It was used in a noobship... lol
---
Pm me your name i'll gladly help you out. Caracals with rapid lights can run tier 2 filaments easily.
---
I don't understand the premise. Why would playing casually not see progress? Your skills train at all times, so there's progress there. When you're logged in for 2hrs/day you're presumably doing something useful, acquiring isk, looking for fights, market trading, or whatever you like doing.
---
Sure, playing more means more progress, but if anything the difference is mostly linear, no? Time in = progress out.
---
Corvettes warp nicely with high grade ascendancy set
---
Drones themselves are not the problem, the mechanics surrounding them are.
---
Little bit of an arrogant response but yes... I did and I am correct in thinking that you have something against deadco.  My point still stands.
---
If you actually had spies everywhere, you would know the answer to that.  You would also know why that's a dumb question.
---
"EVE is not a bad game, the gameplay is just bad"
---
How many minutes of video to say goons and pets (test and sort dragon), ncplhorde, and frat?
---
Can you please link or post Worm and Retri fit for T2? Had some trouble doing t2 duo with a friend
---
Pretty negative view you got there bud
---
All of those corps brainwash new players info f1 monkeys, so thats a poor decision.
---
Oh Noes. Nulls needs to extract farming ships and then roll the hole to get new spawns.
---
I was not expecting this but thank you anyway.
---
&gt; But you can still gate camp a dead end pocket and krab mindlessly to your hearts content.
---
Be careful what you ask for.
---
Note the depressingly low kill rates for ships that matter (rorqs and ratting supers) under the blackout.
---
In your first hours of play you will find the number of things you don’t know about this place is like blowing the frosting off of a cake.
---
This particular rabbit hole goes deep on levels you have no way of understanding yet.
---
The only thing I can recommend is: 
---
a) do the tutorial missions
---
b) when you lose ships \[note: *when* not *if*\] don’t make a fuss about it. Get a new ship and carry on. Yes, some ships are going to be expensive. Some ships are more expensive than you can afford to lose. So: don’t fly anything that you can’t replace. EVE Pro Tip: being able to fly a ship does not mean you should fly the ship if you don’t have the skills to properly fit the ship \[equip it with modules\]. This is not a detail, this is the difference between surviving a \[some\] fight\[s\] and losing the ship in 20 seconds.
---
Welcome to EVE.
---
oh right. i forgot only leftards can post their political bullshit on reddit. in the name of freedom of speech, inclusivity, and equality of course. XD clown. honk honk. (by the way everyone knows the left, aka socialists are the clown world.)
---
Theyve already nerfed supers, titans, FAX and anoms which people are very quick to forget. And no local, which I still cant believe they actually did. It was a meme for fks sakes, a bad joke at best. Yet being hailed as the silver bullet for all the shit thats wrong.
---
And in the end, as you say, it will only strengthen current blocs at the detriment of literally everyone else. I give it a week, maybe two tops for us to start getting new posts about how its unfair. Like you have to spoonfed some kills for them to be happy, literally self destruct in front of them so they can make a shitty post telling everybody they did good.
---
No no, you are not allowed to do that. Having thoughts or wishes of your own? You heathen, there is only 1 way to play eve, be poor, fly nanoshit and have a kb green with VNIs, otherwise go back to HS. Adapt or survive.
---
Its absurd really.
---
Oh and I forgot, the tope consumption doubling was also a thing, yet again messing with the smaller groups.
---
I mean if you’ve been playing for 11 years and are still in highsec, then yes that’s entirely believable...
---
Not so consistent imho, but the game needs a nerf to anomaly spawn rate to encourage spreading out, maybe coupled with a boost to rewards after the local changes (might not be needed if market takes care of it). Game needs a source of player friction within coalitions.
---
Who are these PVP players quiting because of no local?
---
Vni’s do t1 pretty easy if you choose the right drones
---
You know someone's a real tough guy when his "friends" are going to be the ones coming after you.
---
Well,  to be fair,  he IS called Major MOODIE! :-)
---
Thank you for being awesome,  the community appreciates it
---
Really glad I didn't go on this fleet after it was ping'd for all day, holy blueballs.
---
I can squat better than a ruski.
---
I don't recommend training the big/magic 14 to 5 right away. Level 3 is good at first. Go to level 4 as needed. Train level 5 to fly ships that require it, where needed for fits you fly alot or when you have nothing else to train.
---
Waiting weeks for a sub 5% increase in a trait when a different skill that trains in hours or a few days and gives a 5+% isn't time effective.
---
Especially as a beginner, fly different size ships (frigs, destroyers, cruisers....) and see which suit your style then min/max it.
---
You should apologize to r/eve for whatever this is
---
Literally all of eve is on that list
---
Just stop computering , it’s not for you
---
You can actually buy those for 7-8m each, and they only need 100m3 cargo space.

---
PI and some FW plexing (on acc that u don't use often)
---
So you are comparing a skillqueue of how many days? with changing a core mechanic like local? Thats a bit...

You dont mention the disadvantages. So it was all fine and dandy in NS, no issues whatsoever. Just fking unicorns everywhere.

Well... Firstly yes dotlan has that functionality and I know it exists... OP just chose not to include it in his evidence. OP just chose to throw that statement in there and simply link to the last 24 hours. Trying to make his point over an isolated case with a region they dislike. Secondly if OP were trying to post anything other than a post trying to critisize a coalition they would have included others in the past... Also there are other ways to get more accurate in depth information over a larger set of data. I. E. https://www.eveonline.com/article/ptatld/monthly-economic-report-may-2019...

I forgot  how little these SP boosters are on large skill queues...went from 75 days to 69 after using the 250k booster...
---
Dont get me wrong, every little helps. Imagine people are buying Skill Extractors now to use on 'house money SP' as well lol
---
Wow, I can't even tell the difference, it's perfect likeness!
---
And im the fucking pope.
---
I was trapped in that system by the camp after they rolled my wormhole not lon after I jumped in and decided to make an attempt to burn to the gate in my afterburner fit Deacon. I think I got about 20km off before the Vendetta killed me with his gate camp buddies. Wish I had waited another hour before making the attempt to witness this - though either way I'm sure my brave little Deacon wouldn't have made it.
---
People COULD, but given I've seen some botting accounts which are literally always online I know that they DON'T.
---
Thats like fixing your door by breaking your window. Like why. And this argument is being circulated without any proof or even concept of proof that it will work. Sure, lets say they manage to end NS bots, which they wont since there are exploration bots all over.
---
How about HS bots, no local wont do shit against them. 
---
So no, this isnt antibotting. Idk what it is tho.
---
He will fund a large Titan fleeet to attack TEST member in Esoteria.
---
I think the corp left the alliance a couple of years ago.

It is an open question whether they are in space thanks to your efforts or despite them.

Are we really going to have that kind of shitty meme about goons until they release MER and realize they are the only one not affected by blackout ?

They wont even last that long. They are already clamoring for more nerfs which means the hype is settling.
---
grr goons tho m8
---
How many people did those squirrels murdered before being chased away?
---
Eh yes and no? I used to spin VNIs in three accounts while I did my homework. 2-3 hours of minimal effort a day and I’d lose maybe one a week. That ~ 800 mil a week for very little effort and time I wouldn’t be PvPing anyway.
---
oh jesus lmfao i havent even noticed
---
I think if we compare posting histories only one of us looks upset.
---
Love or hate delayed local. But don't kid yourself. Big blue's crabbers havent changed much.
---
You bore me
---
Training all ECM related modules and ships takes a whole lot more time than joining a nullsec alliance.
---
I don't think local was ever intended as a "core mechanic" for intel, same as the buddy system.
---
I also never said everything was "fine and dandy", but most of the issues are not limited to NS.
---
Even CCP put some recommended T1 cruiser fits on their website, if you're looking for something cheap and tested:
---
 https://www.eveonline.com/now/surviving-the-abyss
---
You'll need a bigger investment to get the high level sites, but it's a start
---
They didn't call GOTG though
---
We need to procure a solution
---
Then get some glasses.
---
I'm not upset. I just have little reason to live in null after this change, that doesn't upset me, there are plenty of areas I enjoy playing in.
---
If you’re that unhappy with the account extract and reinject. You’ll lose some depending on how much you have but vOv if you really hate the character.
---
Why you think i asked. Sarcasm
---
Where I think you're worng is having krabs and not-krabs as different people.
---
What Goons got right is realising that the two playstyles can be combined ... that a krab would be willing to fleet up and jump in, if they were convinced they weren't the only backup.
---
Something to do.
---
When that large organised groups "weather mechanic changes", small rag tag bands are celebrating the best patch in history.
---
It's not *hard* for attackers to take space.
---
They just need a bigger super fleet.
---
EvE hasn't changed in this since 2005 or so.
---
Google "suitonia abyssal caracal". 30m.
---
o/
---
Join the in game channel “Abyssal Lurkers” 
---
There is a 30m ISK T2 fit caracal in that channel that can run T2 Darks, electrics, and exotics. I’ve never used it with all T1 stuff, but I imagine with all T1 modules it can handle T1s, but not sure about T2s. 
---
Also, that channel is a public open for everyone channel based around helping people learn the abyss and discuss fittings/strategy, so if you have any questions feel free to ask there! At any given time in the day there should be people around to answer.
---
Good for them
---
"I don't think local was ever intended as a "core mechanic" for intel,"
---
The same local that shows friendlies in blue, hostiles in red and unknowns in grey ? That local ?
---
Hulk smash!
---
Everytime i requested a delivery in Stain from wingspawn i ended up having a new killmark on ma ship...karma
---
If a bot is in a system rented from a landlord and the ship isn't whitelisted ... they are hostile, so dock up.
---
Bots are better at spamming scan than humans, by the way.
---
T1 Solo Logi ships (Scythe and Exequror) are actually surprisingly good if fit for battle instead of reps. They have a very low sig radius for a cruiser and have a very good amount of mids and lows (5 mids and 5 lows for Scythe, 4 mids and 6 lows for Exequror), so you can fit them however you want with 45 or 50 mb/s of drone bandwidth, so you can fit a full flight of medium drones, meaning they can hit around 200dps.
---
They're still a meme ship (like a Battle Procurer or Battle Nereus) if fit for battle, but like other meme ships, they pack a meaner punch and tank than you think.
---
No local is killing things in goon space?
---
You are missing the part of new small rag tag bands forming that perform better with the new game mechanics.
---
I don't think anyone expects goons to suddenly collapse with any change CCP makes, unless someone really high up decides that's a more fun way to play the game.
---
Apparently comprehension is not your thing
---
"Local" is simply a chat channel that shows everyone in your current system. It doesn't follow any special rules, so it shows the same standings you would see in your corp, alliance or any other public channel.
---
If you think corp or alliance is a public channel, then I'm not sure what can be done for you.
---
How about no.
---
That's sharp
---
So who are Major Moodys friends?
---
Why? It will only mess with the hisec players for no reason.
---
You could have the most supers in the game and it won't matter if you can't have them online reliably during the defenders chosen timezones.
---
You will know soon enough by looking at my kb lol
---
PI, market are the classics. They are OK I guess. Truth is, if you want to earn real isk, find a niche. I found mine by accidenot, but am pretty sure (from looking at the market) that less than 5-10 people in the entire game does EXACTLY this.
---
So go out of your way, see if you can stumble onto a niche.
---
I edited to make it more clear
---
If anything it might be safer because if you're not on dscan the first couple seconds, and you're in a quiet area, odds are they'll fly right past you
---
“Blackout is the best...” and “I’m not playing...”. Why it looks like the most popular combination lately?
---
So. Without being a member of your corp, how do I join your corp channel ?

Seems the blue stuff in his pics is teers already
---
fucking lmao
---
damn, i miss WH life
---
Try using space when your enemies have supercap dominance.
---
Just because your ticker is on the screen in EvE doesn't mean you control it.
---
The joy of 1 tick servers. Nothing like being half armor, getting the kill report, then blowing up.
---
Thanks, appreciated !
---
This.
---
Most pilots want to help their corp and alliance buddies, but if trying to help only results in you ending up in a bonus killmail for the attacker, response fleet numbers go down.
---
Heron reddit i can see whats wrong with eve ...
---
https://youtu.be/T_x1fYm-VBk
---
Yeah but using that logic,  you can't easily confine everyone into a little box to use as the reason for your argument.
---
It's called a 'supercap umbrella' for reasons.
---
It isn't called a 'random kitchen sink fleet umbrella'.
---
And make anoms have cynojam until the site is complete.
---
You mean all the obvious and predictable outcomes happened?
---
Shocker.
---
Lets see it from a general perspective ... it's a win win ... everyone seems to be happy with it :D
---
Ironic considering you whined about a few days ago
---
Visiting the Praise Bob discord and posting with an MCAV logo
---
I never said corp or alliance channel are public
---
For some reason dropping capitals on small roaming gangs is considered bad....
---
if the enemy FC fucks up his warp, yes absolutely.
---
more annoyingly, sweatlords set up gatecamps with titans where they just boson the gate whenever they see someone warping in on dscan. Since it retardedly does DOT instead of one "headshot" tick you pretty much always die
---
TLDR : If you want to buff Goons/PH/Legacy/Frat and cripple small groups, keep up the good work.
---
I still think even if its dumb that CCP should do a limit on structures and if your corp/alliance exceeds them in that system they get a refund of the minerals it took to build the structure and the fit and the structure gets removed by CCP.
---
&gt;  It doesn't follow any special rules, so it shows the same standings you would see in your corp, alliance or any other public channel.
---
Here's the problem with this proposal:
---
* Corp A attacks Corp B.
---
* B create two new alt corps (C &amp; D), fills D with Logi pilots
---
* Uses C to declare war on B
---
* B opens up C-&gt;B war for allies, joins as ally with D
---
* D can now rep B, A cannot shoot D, we're right back to neutral RR, except without suspect flags.
---
We gamed this out and it just adds more problems sadly. That being said, we know the current situation has its issues and we'll be monitoring and looking for more elegant solutions
---
Please stop posting
---
Bingo
---
You say this like CCP isn't purposely trying to turn off the isk faucets of AFK ratting. 
---
The reality is, you can make up the cost of a Domi after insurance pretty quick. And if you're not an idiot, you can have a perfectly good ratting null ratting fit that can also take gankers down with you. I've eaten shit to plenty of ratting Domis and VNIs.
---
Freed of speech? This is the internet, not America. Also where did I say I was "leftist"?
---
I think we can agree that  'random kitchen sink fleet umbrella'  sounds more fun for both sides though
---
Serious question... who are this "small NS PVE alliances" every goon and their mothers worries so much about? Is there anyone not-renting that still lives in NS and isn't part of a big group?
---
Goons are arrogant for some things, and when with all of their spies and CSM member's, they doesn't know, they rage (want to burn the HS and halted the sale of T2 in retaliation) like children's. EVE is hard, Goon doesn't like it and more less when they doesn't know.
---
Short term predictable outcomes. Longer term those ratters will get back to ratting. Fact is ratting is piss easy isk that anyone and everyone can do.
---
Wouldnt help - Had some good fun fighting Pinecones so would happily come shoot them :D
---
Transcended play.
---
The stupid, it burns.
---
Defending your backbone isn't about gudfites. It's about defending your backbone.
---
with 12AU/s warp speed you can spam dscan all you want, it's often going to be too late
---
1DQ1-A is perfect for PVP Kappa
---
You mean exactly like 9/10 people in every Volta gang?
---
Nah, you're right. At least they brainwashed you into believing you're not more of the same.
---
Yeah. Unpretentious dude just having fun. Not the kind of playstyle or demeanor you see here on r/eve . To newer players he can be quite informative.
---
Bad Luck?
---
Pirate sites should be all over the place, anyways its best to go into null to only find the paying ones and not waste your time scanning Bloodraider or Drifter sites in WHs...
---
Also your travelspeed in null is way higher!
---
rekt
---
There ya go. Now stop nitpicking :)
---
More seriously join a PVP corp and ask them to learn you PVP, and the best pvp ships are almost all eve ships (i don't count ORE ships in this lol)
---
Sure, but will they be doing it in null? 
---
Unless you want to upgrade to a cap, there are now lower hanging fruit outside of null.
---
Cloaki
---
Because local forced you to be quick about everything. You'd rarely spend more than a couple of minutes in a region, because everything will dock up as soon as you are in intel. Sometimes you'd start to roll and then stumble upon a fleet you'd really like to fight on your way back, but by then there would already be too much mass on the hole for you to bring a decent comp to a fight.
---
Simple answer:   
---
A mature mmo.  
---
People got into shiny things. at first Orca's were exceptionnal.   
---
About botting, it's the same thing: people had the time to develop bots that arent too suspicious (lol.), and safe.   
---
If you get into a new player corps (less than a year pilots), the orca pilot will be the king, even with shit skills.
---
Well people will move to bigger ships due to power creep.         
---
Before the umbrellas people roamed in stuff like cynabals.         
---
Now they do in much faster destroyers that **have more tank** than those old cynabals and much more DPS.         
---
Yet the ratting subcap EHP stayed similar.             
---
/u/ccp_falcon maybe someone could look at this, without some adjustments PVE people will have to move to capitals.         
---
Like you melt now in subcaps to those destroyers, while having no chance to do any harm to them due to speed and signature.            
---
Take this old Cynabal as reference please.
---
Most of us thought it was kind-of dumb.  I actually remember a fleeting sense of incredulity but then I thought well, CCP crunch the numbers before making changes like this, right?
---
My bad.
---
Low sec fw space, have ab fitted, use destroyers as you will love a bit longer in an enagagement giving you a chance to learn.
---
Use thrasher, coercer, algos, talwar, corax
---
Once you get comfortable with destroyers move to frigs.
---
Frig fights are hard because they end so quickly and its hard to learn from a fight that lasts all of 15-20 seconds sometimes
---
Killing the delivery agents? FOR SHAME! lol
---
I mean just happened to me but more see to Zkill notification and it is your ship.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77879388/
---
When you put 10B+ on the field (hull + bling fit + drones), that can't move and can't receive repairs during 5mins, it's pretty fair that the yield and the tank is good.  
---
not sure why people are mad at this. it's just common sense that it have to be balanced because of his value.
---
Me when someone kills me. XD
---
Lol. Put 10 B+ on a ship that cant even mine correctly, just boost your mining op.   
---
No one would do that. Better mine less with something less expensive but safer
---
&gt; upgrade to a cap
---
There's no upgrade anymore. You can skill into a ratting carrier with injectors (or even just a year of training) and claw the costs back easily.
---
Having said that, there will always be vni/rattlesnake/domi ratters that won't sink so much time or money into eve, or into injectors, etc.
---
Did you got this rainbow coloured herpes too?
---
Whined ... yes maybe a bit. I
---
 was expecting like 40% online drop.      
---
I don't PVE and i don't want to 'live' in WH space.            
---
I still don't know if i stay or quit eve due to this change.                 
---
It is fun now, because it is something new but i will not sit and dscan/probe constantly.          
---
It is no fun for me , tbh quite annoying and playing annoying game is ... meh.
---
Every single change aimed at hurting big groups will impact smaller groups harder. The same goes for buffs. Neither us or CCP should look at the changes from this perspective. What should be done is make large groups non-feasible. As long as building the biggest blob in game is the optimal solution, nothing will change.
---
Injectors aren't free.
---
prospect with covert cyno
---
What nerfs in particular? Could you provide few examples?
---
For me it looks like “small ships and small gangs” became real meta in this game recently with all new small ships most of which are pretty capable, with various nerfs to capitals and such.
---
People know this but they deny for some reason.     
---
Ok now is fun, but i think it will be bad change as it will kill small groups.
---
Are you not serious?
---
Yes, that's why it is 'supercap umbrella'. I only said the other option sounds more fun, not that it is the best way to reach your objective
---
A rorqual fit correctly with a cyno is the safest thing on any mining grid.
---
Surely we can't *use* opur CSM spies, instead of CSM honoring their NDA.
---
of course it's the inability, we're goons afterall.
---
Not to mention, the rage was about the shitshow of a drifter invasion, not local.
---
Procurer with non-covert cyno
---
Last time I checked I used more than F1.
---
Now if only CCP can give you a reason not to live on this sub. Because judging by your post history, you don't live anywhere in game, you're literally only here. Always here. Bitching.
---
It's not "easy" to claw the costs back is it.  It's a few hundred hours of utterly tedious carrier ratting.
---
Yep, fits perfectly
---
And a 6 minute invulnerability core and the ability to light a cyno and have infinite help come.
---
i m not even a miner. mostly i do exploration (high/low and wh/null)  and trading/hauling while doing it
---
After taking a look this morning... how do I remove fleet members from my overview?
---
Its such a multiporpoise ship! It shoulf get some killmarks!
---
Thanks I had not considered destroyers. The corax looks nice but is weird so I’ll try the algos.
---
Great to hear you started with magic 14 skills.
---
Dont do all of them to 5 now. It will take too long. Go to level 4 on all magic 14 then mix in some spaceship command skills like caldari frig 5 and rockets to level 5 or light missile to lv 5, then you will be able to use the Hawk assault frigate to run abyssal.
---
After you can come back to finish the level 5 on the magic 14.
---
I am not logging in whilst this blackout remains in effect. I don't give a shit what assholes here on reddit think, I'm sending a message to CCP that I do not support it by not logging in. And if the blackout becomes permanent, then I'm unsubbing, and will give my money to someone who deserves it. Personally at this stage I hope Eve dies a firey death.
---
&gt; Try using space when your enemies have supercap dominance.
---
Again that requires said supers to be online. They assert no dominance while offline. This forces groups into huge collections that span all timezones.
---
A decade ago, exactly the same people who murdered all the PvE people in losec complained about no action in losec.
---
Right now, the same people are on a sugar high of ganks of the weak and disorganised. In two weeks or so, everyone PvEing in null will be under a super umbrella.
---
And then the same people will complain, because it's what they do - kill off all the easy prey, and then complain there is no easy prey.
---
But yeah. The fuck-you button is, was and will be the cyno, and very soon null will see every bit of prey either absent, or tanked and with a cyno.
---
And there is no way "Rorqual, ratting super or GTFO" is good for the game.
---
What should I say about stealth bombers during black out then... Instawarp with the ability to drop huge fleet?
---
And this costs less than 100m
---
According to guides there should not be guarded sites in c1 to c3. Also when I check j space system in wh database it only shows guarded sites in this whs...
---
I never tell lies on the internet, Oh wait i did that right now !
---
Every group that have sov and don't live under big group defensive fleet range.                
---
aka if you cannot call for help - this gang will kill you.
---
Test = brave newbie alliance
---
Search on zkill for a pilot called "blights wretch"
---
Look through his losses for destroyer setups. Also get an idea of the systems. he operates in. He is in one of the busiest/best areas to learn fw pvp.
---
"just a year of training"
---
Now, go explain that to a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed newbie.
---
The most expensive as well. Legit isn't it? Same as super ratting right? End game toys
---
You must not have used the internet between 2006 and 2010. I've honestly never seen a bigger game marketing campaign.
---
i never said something about communication. simply call me a minimalist for most parts, wich includes communication to some degree. Theres a difference between talking and talking. If there is something that needs communication or the communication has any purpose, then 100% i ll go for it. But communication as "just be on coms and you know...talk about random nonsense noone really cares about just because of... because!" THATS ..and utterly waste of time to even spend my time on to move my mouth and say something. i dont get anything from it, you dont get anything from it...its just plain brainless zombie-talk for the sake of it.  i talk if talk is required
---
You can use that fit from the youtube video to easily run t1 or t2 sites. For t3 you will need good skills.
---
Looks more staged then the earth globe theory
---
Not just r/Eve:  I've been called a bot in local many times (for being too good one day or too bad the next) and when I laugh at them and reply that they really should check their paranoia they try to give me a fucking Turing test.  
---
Now I guess I'll just let them think they're correct - since there's no more friendly chat in local and we might as well keep it minimized for more screen space.
---
I would join a FW corporation and follow them in their andevors.
---
Using space is not taking space.
---
For example, NPC Delve is not owned by Goons.
---
How successful is anyone else in using it ?
---
People forget that this is just a game.      
---
It is not about if you are correct or not.       
---
This is just a product and your money - you have all the right to do whatever you want.
---
Jesus there are still people here who remember Pizza?
---
It's not like this is a new thing. Probably existed before titans/supers where introduced
---
Or maybe you stop sending everyone to the same old null bloc corps. There are other options
---
Battle Venture best venture
---
bye
---
Goons have superiority in all time zones. How firmly do you think they could hold it if they only had it for 1/3 of the day?
---
So what you want to say that "rich people got just richer" ?      
---
You know this is what you are saying.
---
Arty Loki - xlasb fit with Genos or domination guns it will fit without genos. 
---
Lasb works without implants and some people use it very effectively. 
---
Buffer fit also works. Worth blinging the invuln. Carry refits for interdiction nullification if travelling through camped parts
---
Excuse me, what does the term whored mean in eve context. Thanks for your time.
---
This is all well and good... The real excitement will be when july comes out as it has the blackout stats :)
---
R O G U E
---
yeah, eve has really hit Rokh bottom...
---
How did you miss his point *so* hard? It wasn't even a paragraph, dude.
---
The point he's making is that despite posts like this, the number of logins has only changed by about 2-3k, FAR less of an impact than people (even those in favor of the blackout) were expecting. You can unsub to "send a message" all you want but the fact is you are by far in the minority.
---
If you're looking to get out of Eve, I'd recommend Albion. Same type of sandboxy deal but fantasy setting with its own version of nullsec claimable territories and stuff. Think league of legends meets eve meets (mildly) osrs. I play it myself when nothing's happening in Eve :)
---
You know what they will complain then?(and do now)             
---
**Umbrellas to strong**             
---
I can only say to this -&gt; #those 100 people defending space, have all the right to deny killmails to your 5 man gang.
---
Unless you're a null corp that's perpetually wardec'd by PIRAT.
---
I just started playing again
---
Not quite. 
---
More that even though you can inject in to a carrier to rat with you're probably going to have to fund them somehow. Subcap ratting was generally a good method to do that. Not quite the case now, though.
---
At least this is the first MER in ages without Delve as #1 miner, since they were deployed.
---
Flying solo in hisec breaks the soul
---
Whe you fly bomber, you warp out when you are in danger. That all. Titan can't boson the whole area, just don't stay group warp off. people who are not in boson continue to shoot you warp back.
---
Just learn to use the ship.
---
Surely has nothing to do with the campaign in the north
---
o7 thank you for this, this is a great addition to the game, especially since recent changes weren't well received by the majority
---
let's see next month's
---
You just proven it. freedom of speech is not exclusive to murrica. And you proven to be a fascist when you claimed the internet has or should have no freedom of speech. And that is an exclusively leftist trait. So go back to your cave and silence someone else. Leftists like you are clowns. So the meme posted here depicts you just fine, therefore my claim is valid. thanks for proving it further.
---
You say that like people aren't already doing precisely that.
---
how dare you speak facts on this sub
---
Because his point was both stupid and irrelevant.
---
If you are a nullsec-holding alliance, you don't support your supercap production pipeline because it's fun, you support it because if you don't you stop being a nullsec-holding alliance.
---
If you don't want to do this, don't be a nullsec-holding alliance.
---
A rorqual isn't that expensive. It's the excavators that are what put a hole in your wallet.
---
Truth be told it is also to do with local. It’s instant intel and many alliances / people use near 2 which monitors local jumps out of their sectors. Bots also use local. 
---
The lack of local is making nullsec dangerous again and I am very much enjoying it
---
And then explain that the blackout just made it that bit harder for them to bypass that long wait by funding injectors.
---
I'm not sure why the bounty numbers aren't in the blog, they're in the downloadable file. https://imgur.com/a/cGvE8ob
---
Aren't you just as clueless? Do you have **any** data whatsoever? 
---
Of course not. 
---
There are only two things we aren't clueless about. 1. There are bots. 2. Not everyone IS a bot.
---
This is what upset looks like.
---
crab_rave.mp4
---
Wow a Highsec region between null sec regions in mining value... \*sniff\* its been 84 years...
---
They forgot them last time too, haha
---
/u/CCP_Falcon
---
yea he is right... most, not all ofc, are using faction frigates these days, which cant really easily be beaten in a normal t1 frigate, unless they make a mistake... i dislike that, but it is the way it is...
---
they missed it in the MER of may aswell and then fixed it a few hours later. probably the same happened in the june MER
---
tru dat
---
P I
---
And not afk or alt tabbed.
---
Nice meme bro.
---
Looks like this resulted in Delve being the #1 in imports as well
---
Actually. We ended Delve by deploying to the north.
---
Can I have ur stuff?
---
&gt;Honestly, that's a fair point.
---
The one you responded to highlighting as initial two regions didn't mention that 1) Goons went back home to Delve; hence, the uptick and 2) Kelavala is the new home for PH capitals and ratting paradise; hence, the uptick.
---
&gt; I'm concerned we're creating an environment where CODE slams them in high sec, and WH elitists slam them if they join newbie friendly corps in null sec 
---
It's pretty good for solo hunters. I appreciate the random roam and ganking X Y Z ratter because they can't see me in local. There is degradation in activity across null regions. Yes, more people are getting caught, but even more people are not logging on because as they said, "I didn't pay for this, I paid for local not wh's". And it's a fair point. The crowd that says "go back to high sec" really just doesn't understand that those that paid for local in null are saying, "you go back to whs". 
---
All perspectives matter, there's hybrid solutions as well (e.g. do it once a month), and it's up to CCP to decide which base they want to listen to, and which base pays more in terms of $$.
---
Albion sucks dude it's clunky as fuck
---
Boohoo, no local, boohoo, elite pvpers. LMAO
---
totally unrelated with the deployment to the north and razing tribute
---
*thinking*
---
Once upon a time the Goons gave a Archon to every member.
---
Given the general power creep, they could probably afford a Rorq each, and if you hate chewing rocks a shitfit rorq with a cyno is probably a better ratter than any subcap.
---
There are still small SOV alliances unaffiliated with either end of the blue croissant?
---
Yea just go until the page is emtpy more or less
---
From a totally unscientific guess.   Not as many as you would think, it’s more often spotted, looked for and left, Occasionally someone gets caught and the kitchen sink horde stampedes along, that occasionally results in “gud fight”, but more often it results in both sides feeding a couple of ships before the visitors decide to disengage and safe spot hop until they can get out and go elsewhere or home. 
---
Tbh, I am finding it quite boring and it’s not incentivising me to log in for my pvp fix.
---
The meme man. We bitch about the stupid ppl WHO WERE mining when we were on campaign and lost shit.
---
Is anyone really surprised about the graph ?
---
And it only cost you the infrastructure of an entire region.
---
spodbrain post about mining
---
Before my time, and archons are kinda trash for ratting.
---
Nidhoggur is ratting carrier du jour.
---
I would disagree. A lot of my corpmates fly around in small gangs, gate camps and other stuff when they like to. And even in "F1-Fleets" there are several roles that not only "pure PVPers" do.
---
There are F1-monkeys and there are people who avoid PVE at any cost. But those are usually the extremes. Most of the players I know are doing a little bit of everything...
---
Well you don't get isk from mining so...
---
AFAIK there are guarded sites in any C1-C3 as well, you just avoid them by name. There are also unguarded sites you can find there as well. In C4+ they are all guarded.
---
Lol, wormhole space would like to welcome you to 2009.
---
I know what you mean, I was asking for actual names.
---
Never!
---
Actually my alliance hasn't lost a region in a long time.
---
Tbh a small rag tag bunch that doesn't get income from  nullsec  will be giggling there fucking arse off right now not all the hunters need to make income in nullsec there are a heap of other income streams
---
*ur
---
Because that was the fleet moving home 
---
Imports and exports includes the value of ships moving as well as goods.
---
I would throw myself hundreds of times at his "friends" just for him having to pay them trillions of ISK.
---
And as we all know, "friendship" ends where business (money) begins. So one of the following 2 options is likely to happen.
---
1.) He refuses to pay after a certain amount turning half/some of his "friends" against him.
---
2.) He refuses to pay from the very beginning turning all of his "friends" against him.
---
This guy keeps loosing in different ways while i keep laughing all the same.
---
... and yeah, i would probably scam him with my alts a few times.
---
I dont think the Imperium wants people ratting in easily-melted carriers.
---
But rorqs are hard to melt.
---
Well actual numbers we will see after 30 and 90 days when base sub/plex/3 month sub runs out and people will decide what now.     
---
But so far it looks good from 'player side'.
---
A titan fleet absolutely can boson a wide area. Why does everyone think I'm talking about bombers being better able to kill ratting titans or something? I'm talking about making them into a hard(er) counter to titan fleets. People love to bitch about supercapital creep, but supercapital creep is always going to be a problem if a massed group of the biggest ship in the game is always going to be the counter to everything else. Since bombers already have weapons that do more damage to large shit than to small shit, I thought that would be a change that would allow them to - not just hit and run - but to lay into supercapitals in a more serious way. Other people had the idea of a new ship class for the role and that's fine too. I just want there to be a subcapital ship that basically exists to destroy supercapitals. There are other ideas to reduce supercreep; this was just mine.
---
ho no you mean a fleet could blap you're fleet ?
---
Work as intended.
---
Well I guess your single point (3) does stand. I’ll give you that. 
---
Should I post the dramatic drop in Fades numbers as well so the fine folks in darkness don’t feel so singled out?
---
cringe
---
1. Join big block. Mine some moon rocks       
---
2. Do some 6/10 escalations       
---
3. Do ^(broken as fuck) burner missions       
---
4. Incursions           
---
5. Relics with intacts               
---
Plenty of ways.
---
what happened with goons? only  \~300b mining in delve?!
---
balance changes are gonna "punish" some playstyles and reward others, thats the entire point. retard
---
wow why all out of sudden they stopped mining?
---
Jfc how have you lasted on the internet this long
---
Do some digging  look here : https://www.verite.space/maps/influence/influence.png       
---
and then on dotlan activity in the systems they own.
---
When did the deployment start? Because you should see a roughly equal spike in exports?
---
war
---
Honestly couldn't tell you. I imagine it'll be on last months MER. You should be able to see goons moving north and nc pulling out to somewhere. I forget where, I am bad at space geography.
---
glassed the north till ccp do shit
---
This game isn't meant to be played afk, if you wanna take a poop and want your ship to be safe ... DOCK UP!
---
It means I shot it once, doing inconsequential damage, just so that I would be on the killmail and pad my own stats.
---
Thank you.

Just nerf caps/supers and put a bullet into anom respawn time ggez

If day 1 is any indicator within 5 hours of downtime injectors were down 5% and extractors were up 10%.

How about you post something decent for a change...
---
but someone else did in june
---
Interesting results /StainGuy. what's your thought long term?
---
IMO people are burning through their isk reserves right now which won't go on forever. Eventually the small guys are going to go broke and now they can't make isk in null.. The big guys will move primarily to carrier ratting under the umbrellas as you say..
---
Prices are going to go up for salvage, minerals and ice products.. Moon too probably.. 
---
I feel sorry for the newbies, there's no way they can make it long term without injecting into caps :x

Well, bounty hounting in eve is a great idea which is impossible to realize simply because 90% of the time you are unreachable for pvp - docked or logged off.
---
because they went and evicted NC. from tribute
---
Just like its supposed to be
---
ALL of you can kindly show yourselves out.
---
What sort of pvp? If you just want to kill shit go for an insta locking thrasher cheap as fuck glass cannon go sit on a null ingate you will die but you will probably kill more before you get killed and come out isk positive
---
When they get an invulnerability core, are able to be multiboxed in the dozens effectively, and mine ore more than 2.5 boosted hulks, then you can say something.
---
The people who can stomach it are doing it.  Most players would stab themselves in the head with a fork long before costs were covered.
---
flair checks out
---
Carriers are fine, just fit a cyno.
---
A carrier will should long enough to cyno in the umbrella. If it's fit like it should be.
---
Just the fact that every time I visit my parents in France I feel like having to retrain typing from scratch.
---
you forgot the 1000dps by drones and virtually unlimited drone bay
---
Then you need to fix your title. You didn't do shit to end delve.

Looking at the 2 week graph, EU spikes seem to be constant, but the falloff after US time drops a lot lower. I guess on the one hand that's bots not running and also real players in regions without active defenses not logging in.
---
Isogen not see that happening
---
Well that’s a little arrogant but ok. 
---
https://youtu.be/u9Dg-g7t2l4
---
Fixed!
---
Nothing that would create a 19T spike, even if you go back until december
---
it should give outrageous boosts to subcap miners, instead of just really strong ones.
---
check the map - peak_concurrent_players_2017.png - those spikes across Tribute are goons
---
wow thats pretty cool
---
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY
---
There was some seeeerious rubberbanding when it went f2p a few months ago, I was playing then and got 7 days of free premium for the clusterfuck lol. It's much smoother now and the latest update added more shit to do solo. It's not exactly super gripping edge of your seat thrills, but I'm having fun just derping about while waiting for people to login and do shit in Eve.
---
I'm just impressed wingspan warped off the HS static lol
---
oh boy, you gonna get downvoted into oblivion
---
You just put the long term in below your question.
---
You really skiffed on this pun chain.
---
because the last war did that too
---
it wouldn't be 10b without excavators, would it? and with the right boosts of course they would. a t2 fit boosting rorq is not that expensive compared to an orca, considering how much stronger it is.

This and my last 20 c1 to c3 scans from yesterday confirms that. Then I came for few null secs and found 1 relic site.
---
Maybe nerf t3 destroyers, command destroyers, and t2 destroyers based on the old cynabal fit. So people will not melt in subcapital ratting ships so fast.        
---
Sorry but from what i see now is that the current T2/T3 destroyer have more EHP, DPS, speed and better aliment than any old roamer could dream of.
---
Guess getting pushed out by NCPL so Goons had to deploy to the north for war counts, but it's a stretch
---
It's alive.
---
This reads like a Trump tweet and it's beautiful.
---
The corax is pretty awkward, it could use a buff or two.  
---
The talwar is also slightly sub-optimal it feels.  
---
The algos.. idk it looks good on paper but once I took it out for a spin it usually flopped. Must be a combination of being unable to heat drone damage and lackluster drone AI. It gets outbrawled by brawlers and outkited by better kiters, but the 10mn version might be worth looking into.  
---
The thrasher is good if fit for dualweb + arti or longpoint + arti, but AC variants pretty much all suck except the 10mn one, which can give dramiels and succubi a run for their money.  
---
For brawling I would suggest you try a dualweb coercer, decent tank and face melting dps.  Either beam or pulse can work.  Approach F1, not much you can do wrong here.
---
For kiting you could try looking into a rail gun catalyst, it is pretty strong, fast and catches people often off guard.  
---
Or you could do the arti thrasher, those are always fun and are pretty strong as well, either kite or web kite.  
---
 
---
The advantage rockets have is that they can apply pretty well in situations where turrets could struggle. This is pretty apparent in match ups like Breacher vs Incursus or Kestrel vs Tormentor, where the turret ship will struggle to apply its dps due to high transversal speeds of the targets, since frigs are generally fast and agile, and with decent piloting can mitigate a lot of turret dps. Rockets dont have such an issue.
---
Destroyer are however slow and have bigger sigs, so a fight between two pretty much always revolves around who has higher dps and more tank. They simply can not mitigate turret dps the way frigates can. And I feel this is where the rockets´ overall lower dps output lets them down. Both rocket destroyers cant really mount a very impressive tank, which doesn´t help.  
---
Not a fan of them.
---
There internal metrics systems have no problem figuring this out at all.  It's why relational databases exist.
---
SELECT * FROM Players WHERE playtime &gt; 6 Months
---
Judging by how many times you put it, I'm guessing you play the game to relax? \*downs another shot\*
---
Everyone involved with this op has been fined. Myself included. Have to keep the SRP funded somehow right?
---
Nice try.. Also good song...
---
last war goons let their shield supers stay in delve and defend so ppl could still mine. this time everything went north so noone was there to protect any rorqs and after the first day when enough died ppl just stopped mining
---
It's a net figure, as we went in, other people went out.
---
Yes, can't wait to see :allears:
---
one of us !! one of us !!
---
I'm in a corp, that have a WH for some guys, and the HiSec base in border to Low SEC.
---
We have 2 guys, one from 2005 and another form 2006. They lived a Lot on Null back in their time and now they chill out in HS spending time with us and our new bros more than anything. The new Bros love them because they run L4 missions with them sharing the Bounty, rewards and get all the salvage and Loot. They teach the new Bros about D-Scan, mechanics, move in fleet, etc... 
---
There is more things in the game that just only mine spodmain or pewpew everything. You can have fun just chilling in coms with other people and making friends.
---
you get to keep using the skills.  whereas if you let an account go to alpha you don't.  
---
e.g. i can train cynos using an MCT and use it forever if i keep omega on my main.  if i train cynos on a new characters, i have to sub every month to be able to use it.
---
Time to call up some of your friends and start making some fast isk! Make sure to log in frequently.
---
&gt;9 day timers/active moon mining/near 2 all pushed us towards safer and more active play style. With bigger fights which is what we want
---
Who the hell says we want this?
---
Bruh i don't even play this stupid fucking game and I still know that it's because everyone fucking deployed out of delve
---
If his friends are as good at pvp as he is then you just got some free kills
---
beat me to the post... but i am omega....

I can't think of any other null sec entity that;s not apart of the CFC,GOTG,LEGACY side apart from the Russian FiRE which are with Legacy VS FRT
---
Good times )
---
I might be the biggest loser since afk excav mining is dead. I am legit considering turning my boosher alts into PI alts lol
---
Well if CCP made another patch with the underlying intention being "fuck this playstyle and the entity using it in particular" (like Phoebe) then goons would be hard pressed to adapt. As would anyone else. Problen is, there really isn't anything they are basically doing by themselves. Maybe you could reduce anomaly spawn rate and moon drill speed with number of alliance members and citadels?
---
PS: This isn't saying Phoebe wasn't a necessary nerf, it was just very obvious who it was directed at in particular.
---
this is impacting on my social game on eve online how can i o7 to my precious corpmates like this?
---
Good
---
&gt; As a pvper, I implore you to fit your VNI/Domi/Ishtar right and rat in systems where you have friends who are willing to come help
---
or, you know, just rat in a super under an umbrella?
---
subcap ratting is dead.  sure, there are some idiots who will continue to go out in a Domi / Ishtar, but they do it because they hate themselves not because it is a viable playstyle.
---
Blackout - the next level
---
Now *that's* what I call blackout!
---
&gt;perform better
---
Highly subjective, pick a bunch of criteria, someone else will pick a different set that proves the case the other way.
---
People play differently and see things as good / bad as suits their preferred style. There isn't ever going to be a case where everyone "wins". You get what is given, people just need to carry on as before, adapt or move on \*shrug\*.
---
Oh yea, grrr Goons. \*eyeroll\*
---
Nah it the new phase of Blackout.
---
I'll just be over hear, crying in a corner. That works, but it just feels bad man.
---
Can confirm can’t even speak to my own alts in local xo or any chat channel for that matter
---
Reply with that rage navyseal comment

You can go here, click Authorize at the top, check the relevant boxes, authorize your character, find your Character ID from Zkill url, and then enter it into the stats section here to get that info.
---
https://esi.evetech.net/ui#/Character/get_characters_character_id_stats
---
I like this Blackout.
---
yeh logging off and back in you then get stuck trying to login also
---
The truth about the Black Out appear.
---
It's not for game mechanic. Just CCP can't solve the problem.
---
That's no reason to not make another alt to sell corpses of himself to himself.
---
I developed a resistance for stupidity, censorship, fascism, leftism and the sort. Also makes me smile when i see a retard reeeeee.
---
&gt; Not sure why people keep parroting this BS. For one, with injector mechanics, raw SP HEAVILY favor old high SP players.
---
One day worth of training is nothing when all I have to train is level 5 skills that take months......  If you don't think this changes things for new players WAY more then for old players I recommend you to roll a new character and see for yourself.
---
&gt;Second, if it's being done for new players, why did their metrics show less than 1% player retention even after they've been handing out SP like candy? 
---
How do you have player metrics for an event that has not concluded yet?  Did someone invent a time machine when I wasn't looking?  If so grab me the stock numbers for a year from now.
---
&gt; Almost as if SP aren't the reason people don't stick around...but in pure CCP fashion, they just throw more SP at it and ignore the million other problems with the game.
---
Being limited in the game by the skill progression system is one of the reasons people quit playing.  A 3 week old character doesn't give a shit about local in nullsec or capship mechanics.  The first real issue that new players are going to run into is complexity of existing systems.  Second most likely issue is War Dec mechanics.  And CCP has finally gotten around to fixing WarDec mechanics.
---
I feel like these retarded grr gon post are made by goons for some pointless meta op
---
Nice now I can really krab all the day without my corp knowing I'm online and asking me to do paps 10/10 CCP
---
Who cares, ccp's game, ccp's rules, don't like it go play WOW with the other retards as no one gives a shit. 
---
Thanks and have a nice day
---
Still Remember my first roam in Null as a lived in HS. It was in a ship that a can't replace if i Lost it si i was so tense... Every jump waiting yo be bubble in the other side of the gate. I ended so tired that day, lol. It was super f***g epic for me and Super fun.
---
You should be happy for this guys trying new things, for Null sec having more content and for people having fun.
---
RNG is a real bitch. Sometimes it takes hours, then you get 4 sites in one C3.
---
sure.  used to.  when you were 3 of 3000 VNI's out there it was fine.  now you are 3 of 100 VNI's and your ratting (e.g. npc kills) will stick out like a sore thumb.  plus it is so much easier to kill you now without local.
---
Dude I watched ya'll perform a bombing run on a bunch of TDSIN pods after we aced a blob of them in a C6 nonetheless and then got cheeky asking where the HS was at - I laughed until my sides hurt and my opinion increased 1000% of wingspan. Do it more!
---
No gate jumping either :D
---
Don't get me fucking started again /u/Dave-Stark
---
wwbee 2.0 we could arrange that.
---
very true never a feature always a bug ///
---
Delve was removed from monthly stats
---
At least it's not my mom this time.
---
Have to agree, it could have been worse in terms of online numbers. 
---
Lets just hope Pearl Abyss won't get nervous and CCP acctually have further plans on balancing the shit out of this game
---
login-collect free sp-logout press :thumbdown:-gj ccp
---
I ratted in an archon for my first while of carrier ratting in goons, can confirm it was roughly the same ticks as a fuckin t2 fit rattlesnake. Nidhoggur is almost double that, even more with turbokrab rigs. On the plus side, maybe I can get the Dagon of my dreams someday!
---
i unsubbed just in time !
---
Phantra / James says you still owe the guy that streamed cos yous never actually paid him after the time you lost all those supers ;)
---
&gt;Oh please, please, someone tell me this isn't bait!
---
So you want me to lie?
---
No
---
Is that a picture of Sean Young from Bladerunner?
---
Carriers and rorqual dying less? Well its not many people using them after the blackout!
---
All of my chat windows are delayed. Is this intended?
---
jaaaa man
---
as someone that makes a significant amount of their money from relic scanning, take it from me when I say you're wasting your time doing it in wormholes. The unguarded spawn rate is trash. [Go here](https://www.eve-scout.com/thera/) and find yourself an in hole for thera, then pick an area of null where you want to go and scan yourself into it. Wormholes are for traveling, not for actually relic hunting in.
---
No, this is the result of persistent r/eve shitposting
---
people will recommend you join one of the big blocs and their newbie wings. Here's why this might not be what youre looking for:
---
People think that when they join these blocs, EVE will suddenly have meaning to them and they will learn a lot. but the issue with that is that you have to create your own path, and your own goals for you to keep logging in. the reasons why you are in the space you are in, and fighting the people you are fighting means nothing to you when you parachute into a big bloc - its not your story so you wont care.
---
that leaves the PVP aspect of it and here again its overrated: you need to learn PVP from the ground up. jumping straight into these big fleets in a tackle rifter will teach you very little about how engagements work, how to figure out what and how to engage different ship types etc. 
---
this means that you'll struggle to find reasons to invest in EVE and will ultimately give up.
---
I tried this approach a couple of times before and this is ultimately what happened every time. its hard to care or login for things that you dont "own".
---
This time I'm doing it differently: I've set up a corporation for new players that want to build their own EVE experience from the ground up, and not simply parachute into someone elses. We want to learn EVE as we go, by doing and experiencing. We want to build up our own assets to care and fight over. We want to learn to really PVP and not just be inconsequential DPS in a massive fleet or someone whos job it is to die but tackle someone for 5 seconds. 
---
What we offer is a place for like minded individuals with similar experience levels to learn and share together, to build our own path and place in the stars, and ultimately find purpose and content in EVE that is actually meaningful and rewarding. We want to build together, and find a shared reason to keep logging in and finding and experiencing content - in PVP, in Trade and in Industry.

---
Destroyers in FW LSec are good, if you want to fight in Novice Plexes then the Incursus and Tristant are super good, scram + web + AB mids, Damage control, small ancil rep and damage mod in lows (nano plating in spare incursus low), bulkhead rigs, heat weapons and ancil repper, keep at range 500, void/antimatter, bring null vs scram-kiters.
---
Other ships that are good for brawl/scramkiting are the Breacher (triple tank with rockets), Kestrel (Shield with rockets) and Tormentor (similar to the Incursus, beams track worse but can hurt kiters, pulses track better but range isn't  great).
---
This is because of the deployment to the north. Not because of anything us players or the drifters did. The drifters only ended the northern campaign early. 
---
The July mer will be how the blackout affects delve the most. And guess what, probably not much. Delve is still  fortress with a massive supercapital umbrella. The local blackout hurts those that are botting, not the people actively at their keyboard. The inperium has 10s of thousands of characters. They will still 12 box rorquals and super capital rap. All it means is that now they need a character on the gates to listen for gatefire. Same way wormhole have a character listening to a wormhole for activation. 
---
It may be a tad bit lower, but don't expect this to end delves grip on the mer. Multiple game mechanic changes will have to occur for that to happen.
---
Is this intended?
---
Why are goons unironically getting triggered by this post? You know it's a joke right?
---
That can’t be intentional.  Has to be the comms shitting up again right?
---
Jita scammers losing their shit right now.
---
Also my main couldn’t right click in space my alt was doing that just fine?  
---
Had to see a station in space and right click dock from there
---
&gt; All graphs in this report can be enlarged by clicking on them.
---
Nope.
---
What people dont understand is that no local isnt only what makes Wh space Wh space..its a factor sure but the other factora of wormhole space include constantly changing wormhole entrances and exits. In nullsec you have a solid idea of what is in your region and what to expect. 
---
In a wh you have no idea if you will be raided by lazerhawks today or not or if you will have a highsec wormhole today.
---
All of nullsecs jump routes and true sec status havent changed a bit.
---
This is even happening in Rooke chat
---
This makes me happy.
---
If you call botting actual playing.... Also it's cancerous botting that chases people away. And yeah ofcourse the alliance with the most bots will keep on playing. Just look what you boys did with Serenity. Chased everyone away. The only alliance that was left was that mango wango botting battalion. Until they were bored and now are here to ruin Tranquility too with your play style. Lets see how fast Mango will become a super power. I give it 2 years. Remind me then about this.
---
Just managed to log back in no probs guessing were all gonna get kicked off for some more downtime whilst this gets fixed
---
o7 brother
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
What about Moon Mining?
---
What about just outsourcing structure ownership to some placeholder alliance founded by the alts of Goonswarm leaders.
---
I've always wanted to hold the memorial to someone's dead grandma for ransom, it has been on my EVE bucket list for years. Maybe now's the time. 😉
---
So you were that lonely Ibis we saw yesterday. o/
---
ah fuck me, i meant southwest, compass calibration failed ...
---
I am saying that people overestimate what it does.
---
So buff  Excavator HP?
---
Nope, not ever. I mean, just look at my killboard.
---
The algos is good if you run it with an overprop (10mn compact AB) but I highly recommend the thrasher for what you're doing. you can accidentally kill people with that thing, it's prety stronk. Fit it with a full arty rack and laugh your ass off as you volley through the buffer of active reppers and put them in half hull.
---
&gt;I still had my auto-pilot queue on and decided it would be safe to follow it. 
---
This is where I stopped feeling bad for you
---
Citadel guest list is broke too. Undocking, the citadel was missing in space (cloaked perhaps?), ironically, it shows the correct number of people in the citadel when undocked, but when docked, guest list is empty. Also, saving sig's is buggy and takes like 4 tries to get the pop-up to actually save. Also, just got kicked from server, so it sounds like they're doing a quick fix (potentially), or something is on fire.
---
I love this
---
I mean is following auto-pilot in high-sec really supposed to be a death wish?
---
Not entirely true!  
---
We grab our Eagles and send EC300s on hostile logi :D
---
You walked off a cliff because you were blind but somehow that’s not your fault? If the server is shitting itself then stay safe.
---
&gt;I still had my auto-pilot queue on and decided it would be safe to follow it.
---
You lost your shit due to your own stupid decision. Deal with it.
---
Server Reboot now!!!!!!!!!!!
---
lmao they are doing a reset now i think, cluster in 5 min XD
---
Everyone in EvE is already trying to kill you, whats a few more..
---
In game, just got a notification for shutdown again.
---
yeh just kicked uis off :D
---
It's a serverside issue (not your internet; the game itself is borked) and it wasn't a PvP loss, so you can file a ticket with CCP and ask for reimbursement. They'll get back to you with a replacement ship fairly soon. 
---
That said, if you've only been playing a week your networth was probably like 5 million isk; link your km from zkillboard?
---
If you're hauling 60% of your net worth then yes
---
Help me to understand the ability to buy skills that the game has now.  
---
I have been gone for around 5 years and I see now that you can but skills. 
---
Does all injectors come from other players? So that all skills actually are pointes "earned" by other players that they trade away?
---
I was wondering this because I see that in the login-screen you can get free points just from logging in. Does that mean that CCP also just magic-wands up skillpoints from the thin air to create more?
---
How is this not disrupting the balance of the game and creating a huge influx of players being able to fly titans and the like?
---
&gt;or, you know, just rat in a super under an umbrella?
---
Yeah, that's fine too. Make room for people who play the game.
---
like the bug i had yesterday lmao :D
---
It's a feature.
---
Kinda, yeah.  Regardless, if the client was bugging out, file a report.  There's a good chance you'll get _something_ back, depending on what dropped.
---
mright click don't work too. now we need gamepad for game? 
---
cool cool cool
---
I'm actually in this scenario. I played an Alpha account for a while, but had to give up due to moving abroad and reasons. I've forgotten most of this limited things I learned, but the sub still fascinates me. And I like to read about big kills, hunting stories (even if I don't get the vocab and references), and drama.
---
It's confusing! I'll say that much.
---
Eve is kill time to find a new game.
---
Same for the pacifier, and that's a ship that can actually kill things now and then.
---
CCP fucked up.
---
I started the game as an alpha and I was upset that I could only use ships from a single race in the beginning. They updated it and allowed alphas to use ships from all races.
---
Now they announce this. It's funny, they say they're doing stuff to make new players join the game but at the same time they're restricting free players so much that they will feel obligated to subscribe or they won't be able to enjoy EVE.
---
How so? 
---
They say the majority of bots rely on local, they do. 
---
They say the alternative of relying on dscan makes it significantly harder to keep them safe, it does.
---
I can’t think of a situation that would be impossible to catch a bot that relies on dscan and overview, while I certainly can for those that rely on local. This would be even more impactful for high value ships such as supers botting.
---
Do you disagree?
---
When was the last time you played eve? Throughout 2018 the imperium deployed sigs and even fully for a war against Gotg. That war among other notable events saw the most people ever formed for a fight in gaming history.
---
I believe it changed? 2 years ago I was explo in c1 to c3?
---
Plot twist: ccp was breaking local on purpose to test involuntary blackout.
---
This, provi is strong in the EU and weak in the US time zones, this blackout isn't going to fix that.  Just the opposite.  Nerds can't login whenever and solo play, so nerds don't login, that has to be great for the long term health of the game.
---
the problems stem from natural human nature to seek safety and stability. CCP has to fight an extremely steep hill to get players to overcome natural instincts and murder each other without creating a method to cheese the game
---
remember, faction warfare was much better than it is now before goons figured out how to cheese it for like a trillion isk.
---
"I don't play this game anymore, but I will still write lengthy paragraphs about a game I'm not playing for ten years now."

Free sp
---
He posts great YouTube videos, too. If it’s the guy I’m thinking of.
---
No CCP hasn't nerfed that salt yet.
---
Anything Jin'taan and anything Ashterothi.
---
I followed them over from their days hot dropping on Crossing Zebras podcasts.
---
If they bricked chat trying to backpedal and put local back online in null it will be hilarious
---
Hehe man, don’t undock and fly around if you see the game is shitted up.  Server looks borked this morning.  Try petitioning CCP and they might replace your loss, they know there are issues.
---
&gt;I've only been playing this game for a week or so, but i've just logged in after the downtime and, after un-docking, no ships or objects were rendering, and there was nothing in my overview.
---
Same thing happened to me but I immediately logged off, not worth the risk when your client is bugged. 
---
In any case it looks like there's some serious server instability right now, so you'll quite likely get everything back if you file a ticket/petition/whatever it's called.
---
too many pilsners at the office
---
My account was marked Alpha and I couldn't play because of an error saying "pay omega bitch" lol
---
What are you lot raven on about?
---
First its black out local, then its black out chat channels.
---
Tomorrow its black out client.
---
You think they can detect someone doing random clicks or actions from time to time? That's pretty hilarious considering that people are multi boxing with pretty obvious bot accounts and not getting detected
---
Imagine suffering from SBS to this extent
---
sure it was a fucking good idea to touch the chat system after spending months of try,fix,patch and even consider to roll back the old system
---
I just lost some millions too (not combat related, was docked, really hard do explain), not worried about it though. Server is really fucked up, came up to reddit to see if anyone was talking about.
---
Runs a 400 man corp, 5 show up for the roam, manages to lose one to a trashy fit cyno Ishtar. Were your friend's spies called Dotlan by any chance?
---
&gt;You just proven it. freedom of speech is not exclusive to murrica. And you proven to be a fascist when you claimed the internet has or should have no freedom of speech. And that is an exclusively leftist trait. So go back to your cave and silence someone else. Leftists like you are clowns. So the meme posted here depicts you just fine, therefore my claim is valid. thanks for proving it further

  You're special. Enjoy T_D... Oh wait.
---
Take my upvote and FO.
---
Never go full retard. This isn't about the NS "blackout". Chat bugged after today long DT. And game was laggy as hell.
---
Damn right....
---
Reeeeee!!!!
---
Give it a rest guys.
---
I'm glad you recognize greatness.
---
Moody by name. Moody by nature
---
Just like Fweddit.
---
ok
---
bots don't work without local
---
Omega blackout as someone said in another post
---
Can you set the example and go first?
---
Wasn’t 2017 Tribute Co2 space?
---
Goons have to be quite proud of this accomplishment
---
I feel like CCP might be trolling all the people in null demanding local be removed everywhere.
---
It's almost like after the last time they bat phoned the universe we decided to bring sufficient force to remove the stain?
---
Hunter activity &lt;=&gt; PvE activity
---
It's a cycle, if there is less players to hunt, hunters will go somewhere else, which leads to PvE increase, which leads to hunters coming back, PvE decreases, etc.
---
Just right click and remove from overview. Make sure you're on the right tab as it will only remove them for that one. I have mine setup to show enemies in one, friendlies in another, seems to be the common setup
---
Sorry their bat phone got worn out from the last use?
---
Underrated comment of the thread. #worthit
---
you can do it, but it's slower and just worse in general.
---
If this is real it's the ultimate in salt.
---
donate to get this man non 3rd world internet
---
Preach! Don't mind the downvotes, its just the salty bears who populate this subreddit.
---
Normally agree, but with skill point bonanza in progress, would say go to 5 and get it over with.   Consider dropping extra $5 and get the million sp.
---
Yup!

Murderface, Murderface, Murderface.

how dare you to use "too much" and "pilsner" in the same context except quoting it!!!!! blasphemy
---
In null you can find fights in subcaps, in wormholes, you are basically limited to mostly subcaps.
---
When I lived in null, I spent most of my time in a standing fleet and chased roaming gangs around, not my idea of fun, so I moved out.
---
Since moving back into wormholes, I have found I enjoy the times I play more than I ever have, I keep the pings channel un-muted in discord, and my KB has more isk and activity on it than ever before (both red and green)
---
Give both options a try.
---
Yeh you could have warped to a Trig Incursion or could have been suicide ganked. 
---
Link us the Killmail and we'll be able to see what happened.
---
Volumes adjusted, will work on sound levels daily. Thank you for you input to the LEFTCO Traffic Report
---
Nerds don't have to play Eve though, they can just go play another game so on both sides of your cycle you lose subs and if you can't replace them w/ new players, where are you 6 months from now?
---
Very nice
---
Wait people unironically mine in orcas these days? Their yield is trashier than a medium skill procurer and they cost nearly a billion.
---
OMG this is so true.
---
CCP must have been waiting for a WWB II since the last one was so huge for the game.  Then it came and we got a fizzle.  And I think they realized nothing big would ever happen again unless they shook things up.  I personally don't think Blackout was enough, or even necessarily the right thing, but I think it took balls and I hope they show more of it.
---
CCP!  Now do the umbrella!
---
CCP REEEEEEE
---
Been playing for 3 weeks and I hit 1.2 bil networth in my 2nd week
---
you had the option to right click in space and select a station to dock in
---
everything ccp does is intended did you ever see them make mistakes /s
---
It all depends on the viewers upload/download rates, who is watching netflix on 10 tablets, downloading porn, mmos etc. Can confirm some people can see with 1 second delay and up to 16 seconds with Zimbabwe internets. Reporting in my intel channel, which I do, they see it instantly regardless if I have the stream on or not.
---
Yes, the chat isn't working.
---
Big alliances will teach you how to be an F1 monkey not how to PvP
---
Rorqs tend to be used by multiboxers rather than botters. They just vastly out-mine everything else
---
How'd that go for him? Banned? Success? Still doing it? I bet he didn't
---
Oh man, did you ever just make my day 2 days in a row
---
Nom nom nom
---
Flair checks out
---
So, only 10 %.
---
Couldn't agree more. Last two months we had two sets of cloaky campers non stop in every system. Cloaking is total bs but it's a game mechanic everyone can use. So I'll use it.
---
people are being shit cunts because eve is hard and most of the time it's your fault.
---
Just petition your loss, you'll get your shit back minus whatever dropped at a bare minimum. 
---
if CCP aren't huffing paint you'll get everything back because the server is shitting the bed hard right now. I've never seen downtime over 1 hour EVER.
---
XD
---
Except it turns out they were right and all the people saying CCP would nerf shield hulls were wrong. CCP's told us they have no plans to counter-tweak shield ships (other than adding stacking penalties to regen mods). Maybe more nerfs are incoming, we'll have to see, but until then, you're the dumbest fuck.
---
They posted a update on twitter saying they are working on fixing it.
---
Except I'm active 95-96% of the stream reporting intel instead of afk cloaky camping while i go to work or fap one off.
---
Ofc, an area/EVE changes player numbers all the time.
---
If you can't replace old subs with new subs, you end up with less subs in 6 months obviously.
---
I (and appearently CCP as well) believe that many EVE players can come up with solutions to the new environment though.
---
If you want to waste your time being wrong, again, have at it.
---
I agree. Fuck cloaky camping. It sure is fun though.
---
\^\^\^
---
&gt;  enough died
---
I wonder
---
o7
---
Good idea, if I can't back to my spot due to gate activity, I'll do this instead of feeding prototype cloaked corvettes to the enemies.
---
...aaaaaarr my leg is stuck, I’m toast under all this text.  Go on without me...just leave me some grenades.
---
i can't believe how buttmad people are over a simple chat box change lol
---
Damn, I thought lowsec had a black out and realized it was this instead xD haha
---
Unsubbing my my 20 Jita scam spammer alpha bots right niaow! oh, wait...
---
Not going to spread any salt.  But here are a few tips.
---
- never fly on autopilot.  There are people who will shoot you just because they are bored and haven't had a chance to shoot someone in a while.
---
- How much is "60%"?  Losing 60% is shit, but if it is 60% of what you can make as a one week old then it won't seem like much in a bit.  Your ability to generate isk grows substantially as you skill up and, most importantly, as you learn the ins and outs of the game.   When I was a week old 60% was probably a few million.  That is in a game where making 10-20mil/hr mining is considered seriously low income.
---
If you lost it due to a real bug, find your lossmail and send CCP a ticket with an explanation.
---
MOST IMPORTANT:  Get used to losses.  This isn't taught in the tutorial.  Your ship is just ammo.  You go out, you die, hopefully you had fun, you wake up in a station, you get another ship.  Rinse.  Repeat.
---
If they capped it, your Corp would just anchor the required number of Sotiyos to be able to do so and avoid the ihub upgrade in other systems.
---
(corp chat) marco
---
Yup and how far do you go to potentially break a game to where it’s just not fun in attempt to fight what comes naturally??
---
In fact it's quite the oposit, you run into allot of small gangs that are hyped by the blackout (alot more roaming gangs are out because of the blackout ) and it's actually quite fun
---
Maybe the blackout is just a buff for wormholes? 
---
Something else:
---
Before the announcement of the blackout I wanted to unsub some unused alts. Now, the blackout is here and I still don't need this alts.  
---
But if I unsub CCP will count it as blackout protest. What should I do?
---
&gt; How is this not disrupting the balance of the game and creating a huge influx of players being able to fly titans and the like? 
---
it does, but also it doesn't. It kinda just replaced the character bazaar in a way
---
I like the fact they still try and bot. CCP gave us the power to police them ourselves.
---
Skynet is that you ?
---
(corp chat) polo!
---
When do ships go from appearing in your dscan to appearing in your overview?
---
I’m not even sure we’re talking about the same thing man
---
Yet near2 is incredibly powerfully, and IMHO should be banned, if you want something similar, go on come with the players to get the informations from them mouth to ear
---
For the most part any fortizars within range of Imperium main space /capital systems that allow docking for groups like Panfam get removed by policy. Stops hostile sups/titans moving around
---
What? Again?
---
Imagine actually believing this.
---
ding ding ding.

I am embarrassed I didn't look first.
---
You should file a support ticket and outline what happened - where they can, the GM Team are more than happy to help :)
---
we need an official /r/eve executioner for puns like these
---
Agreed, the people bitching about this are absolute clowns. The entire reason I resubbed all of my accounts was the blackout. 
---
Haven't played in years and this blackout seems fun af.
---
I hope this is a troll as shield slaves will break the game making armor doctrine worthless.
---
Yeah I recall just about every, "Whaa, the rorqual should be able to mine and mine LOTS!" from back-in-the-day getting swiftly shit on by economy-minded folks who had pretty accurate notion of what just cranking up mining yield would do.  I think I even saw CCP acknowledge it a few times.
---
And then they went and did it anyway.
---
Not realy against the eula the problem most of the time was the combination of this with input broadcasting.
---
Ayyyyyyyyy TEST numma wan!
---
Personally every wormhole I've been in lately has been nothing but pirate data/relic sites to the point I don't wanna do them all. Irony is these wormholes/chains have all been close connected to jita.
---
LMAO Big Gay Al Returns! It's been a long time since I've seen that fit.
---
My corp had delayed local, is CCP telling me to awox?
---
I can enlarge them on my phone by clicking on them so maybe it’s you.
---
sabre/scoot(inty or cov ops) with B

jita trader with C

Strap a 50mn mwd on a Procurer and it'll go 1500 m/s cold, good enough to kite with drones at 65km with a good tank. They are stronger than they look.
---
Game looks so much healthier on this report...
---
Looks like a normal day for me.
---
Dunno 30 or 40 i think
---
damn you needy
---
Some of this is somewhat true.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Can recommend you suicide first. 25 PI characters is enough to cause insanity. Doing that with 70-100 would make you hate the game.
---
Have you never heard of suicide ganking, the exclusively high-sec phenomenon?
---
When they have warped onto the same grid as you.
---
Quite good. After my 2nd week I was still losing t1 fit executioners in fw and barely hit 20m.
---
sucking that ccp cock all day isn't healthy, maybe check what a thread is about before swallowing 12 inches
---
Or one lives in a wormhole and is unlocatable and unreachable even when logged in and undocked.
---
Btw I am a part time wormholer myself.
---
r/ccpdidnothingwrong
---
I agree with most of this but I don’t agree that 15% decline in active logins is insignificant.  Who knows what attrition over the next month will be explained how?  People who wanna simply ascribe that to botters and write it off - that’s fine and if you’re a fan of the changes this is a perfect way to justify these changes but to me, 15% less active accounts is 15% less overall activity.  Say what you want about the fact that botters are impossible to catch, that they’re not real targets anyway... If ccp would make their game unbottable in other ways while not creating all this collateral damage I think this would be seen more positively.  
---
And I think we’re not done seeing drop offs.  They’ve completely bribed another 30 days of subs... ok...  check back as this next 30 days unfolds.  My hunch is that people are still logging in to set up to be afk.  Finishing mfg jobs.  Putting shit up to sell.  Moving shit to NPC stations, etc.  an immediate 15% followed by... what??   
---
They ignore the real problems (citadels, jump bridges, resource allocations) and fuck this game up even more by doing these knee jerk shit.
---
Yo, Dawg I hear you like free SP. So we put free SP on your free SP so you can have free SP.
---
In those days I sat mine behind a POS shield giving system-wide fleet boosts.  There weren't that many of us out there with V skills in that area.
---
/r/eve isn't an airport, no need to announce your departure
---
Most of it is the standing fleet vs roamers, which is sometimes gatecamps but usually just trying to chase them down with fast tackle and then bring in backup before the fast tackle dies. 
---
We do some roams, not sure how many because I usually wouldn’t go on them, and I’m sure stuff is changing with the blackout and move.
---
He so anger do not provoke the anger bear.
---
It's always the same thing.
---
the single race thing was absolutely stupid though, this actually kind of makes sense. I honestly think if alpha clones (myself included for the time being) should either be restricted from faction ships/equipment as well as tech 2 or not be able to go above cruiser. right now I can get around not having tech 2 heavies simply by using the not much more expensive faction ones. warp to me even has an alpha bs fit for incursions! I can run incursions using an alpha account.....
---
something is definitely broken
---
An initial 10-15% is not good lol.  As you say, people’s subs are running out.  People are setting up to be afk.  The ADMs are falling because people aren’t mining and ratting they’re moving their shit to npc stations.  The initial 10% is the iceberg... we don’t know how much water we’re taking on here
---
Do what I did. Find the nearest abandoned looking c1/c2 hole and live in it for a couple months. You'll be a pro EvE player after that,
---
&gt; Does that mean that CCP also just magic-wands up skillpoints from the thin air to create more?
---
All skillpoints are magicwanded up out of thin air. Slowtraining and extracting still makes em come out of nothing.
---
&gt;How is this not disrupting the balance of the game and creating a huge influx of players being able to fly titans and the like?
---
It is, to a certain degree. One still has to invest tons of isk/money to just instantly inject titans and the like. Very rough napkin math says you have to buy $1000 worth of plex to get enough isk to buy skillbooks, hull, fits, pod, and injectors to get an instant titan pilot.
---
Bad analogy.
---
Eh I bet he’s got the autism to manage this.
---
&gt;I feel sorry for the newbies, there's no way they can make it long term without injecting into caps :x
---
What if I told you that, once upon a time, people trained into caps without using injectors? :O
---
Or that there are ways to make money that dont require you to sit in a nullsec anomaly?
---
yeah.... why does just about every ship have drones?
---
Your mom left you to join Rote Kapelle
---
heh that would be nice, ccp messing up twice in one week and giving us two lots of free xp :D
---
Free SP when?  These SP farms don't fuel themselves.
---
Using t2 drones, 2x t2 drone rigs, and t1 drone rig, they mine literally less than a venture boosted by a hulk. (~22m3/s vs 24 m3/s)
---
Bear holes get fucking evicted because they're loot pinatas and fuck bear holes.
---
Well... He's playing one week. I guess 60% of his net worth is about 100m. I'd auto-pilot it too.
---
CCP wins.........the end.
---
Ah, thought it was something I could actually find in the overview settings. Will have to wait for the next time we fleet up then. Thanks!
---
take that high sec
---
It’s Jintaan what do you expect?
---
Specify in your unsub reason?
---
blackout r/eve when?
---
Probably more like 10m
---
Would be kinda funny to have 1-hour "outages."
---
Would also be hilarious for Jita if they disable the ability to make links in local chat (not corp or other channels).  Even more if they put in a (hefty) ISK tax for making links in local chat (again, not corp or other channels, just local).
---
You talk like it's gone. People can still relay intel and use the same tools.     
---
The Scouts just have to Monitor a gate instead of local.        
---
But it is easier to miss a fast ship zipping by.
---
Well how are we supposed to know if you don't give us a link to the channel?
---
Don't know about you, but I play to have fun. I give no shits about backbones. I'll adapt and make-do with what I can. 
---
So, to me, defending my backbone *is* about gudiftes.
---
would need a revisit to the subcap ore hold sizes then. hulk can barely have 2 cycles before it is full
---
Server's under Most Massive Attack from what I can find. Someone space important is probably mega fuckin assmad about the blackout. Turns out if you have a ton of cloud VMs to run bots you can just chuck them at a server too. &gt;\_&gt;
---
BB has been fuckin lit lately. Thanks for the fun last night test :)
---
Okay, so your overview tab was probably wrong, or your overview settings in general. Google Eve Z-S Overview or open the 'Z-S Overview' ingame comm channel and unfuck your overview. It'll save your life later.
---
When you get in shit, first look at the icons above your capacitor. Are you warp disrupted or scrambled? No? Warp out to whatever you can align to quickly on your HUD. Don't hesitate, just bail first, and reassess after the first warpout. You will be followed, you will need to warp out again, but while you are in warp you get precious seconds to **think**.
---
"Do I have an aggression timer?" --&gt; no --&gt; station/citadel is safety
---
\--&gt; yes --&gt; safespot bookmarked in system or keep bouncing until aggression timer runs out.
---
Stuff like that.
---
If you can link the loss mail on zkillboard or something, I can give you more insight into what happened. :)
---
Imagine needing any sort of justification to want to shoot Fweddit.

The title is a meme you flaming autist.

hahaha

nice meme bro, original

It's the one thing that gets beaten into you 20 times a day in Rookie Chat.
---
Here you go - [https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96](https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96)
---
I'm surprisingly fine with this
---
no - massive stashes of assets are in low sec / nullsec NPC owned stations
---
You should contract his own corpse back to him for 1 bil.
---
rip
---
What, you chat in local, instead of corp/alliance-channels?
---
Admit it, you're one of *those* people, the fucks that want their local intel channel
---
&gt; I feel sorry for the newbies, there's no way they can make it long term without injecting into caps :x
---
I mean if they're trying to plex maybe, but even then I can pull 400mil easy in a few hours of exploring. I don't see why a cap is mandatory when I'm doing it in a frigate.
---
that would be a nightmare of a job, I bet.
---
nice, I can block them en masse.
---
don't forget asset safety and cynos
---
you can't reference mine, I flip flop back in forth depending on what responses I want from you retards
---
What you need is something called an "insta-undock".  Also never undock with 60% of your entire net worth.  10% tops.  Same in real life if you want to buy a boat, or anything really.  Never spend more than 10% of your wealth on it.
---
Your only social interaction with other players is seeing them in local?
---
\0/
---
 faction guns don't require advanced skills though, just a little more expensive than tech 2
---
Nah, the tartan army channel is always empty ;)
---
def need a EHP buff. The whole point of them is that they're supposed to be DPS machines with light tank.
---
Not unlike a gold medal in the special Olympics brother
---
If only there were corp / alliance / coalition in-game chat channels, Discord, Mumble, TS3, etc.
---
I think this deserves a clown meme.
---
They would so wish they could get 2000 people into a battle.
---
Of course they haven't experienced tidi yet either.  So....
---
Think thats a fairly good reference!
---
What to do when servers are down 101 please ...
---
I've posted the same before and was ridiculed and downvoted to hell and back. Apparently EVE really is a game of autistic sociopaths. ;-P
---
CTA ... CTA ... "well i didn't know anything about any ops going on ... hehe" :D
---
Have players log in everyday. Have server taken off line. It's a grand plan, I guess.
---
no
---
I am not saying it worth nothing for OP, I am saying that it's not worth of suiciding in HS, so I'd call it pretty safe to fly on Auto-Pilot.
---
Numbers can be deceptive
---
Local certainly ain't the primary chatting channel, but local definitely offers intel too if used properly. Yes, i'm one of those social people ;)
---
That's true. It's still possible to sit on a gate and watch things go by. It's just less reliable now.
---
Exactly, but when your competition is all retards then it's still a win
---
well the amount of idiots not being able to shit talk to newbies is a win ... the amount of good willing helpful people not being able to help is the loss on the other hand ...
---
And how do you deal with blues transiting the farmlands?
---
Tbh 80% of null systems were empty anyways
---
Right.
---
I said "less" social.
---
I’m sure if you asked test, they could blue you up and get you a better tax rate on the poco and buy your PI for the keepstar spam!!
---
Probably the same groups reddit has been romanticizing for the last 5+ years.
---
 I said "less" social. I'm repeating myself.
---
Whoever say is not doing isk right now must be a idiot...and the newbees can run abysals or lvl 3 in hisec...those crying about not making isk,same ppl that used to run bots or afk anoms
---
To keep it 100. We don't come\post here for originality.
---
TBF it is a very relative concept.  
---
If it is enough to impair your safe driving, it is too much.
---
A bit more than that might impair your ability to shitpost effetively, which then would be a "too much".
---
If, however, you wanted to go out on a drunk Drake roam, there really isn't a "too much".
---
Role playing server down.... end game eve right there.
---
 \&gt; collosal vessals
---
I can. Have you not seen how autistic &amp; obsessive Eve players can be?
---
Who would win? 185 ragin' chikkinz or a 4,958 man alliance that is part of the largest coalition that EVE null sec has ever seen.
---
Tune in at 11.
---
I would tbh if i was bored
---
&gt;no
---
Nah, you're right, CCP will just make them immune to AOE damage.
---
Take that High Sec cunts.
---
Have you considered mining until you get yourself situated with ISK and your shield/armor/ship/engineering worked on? I used to make 600m/day just mining with a hulk and porpoise.
---
Oh, 5000 people showed up this time? I thought it was 455,876
---
There is few of those too as in any (online) activity :P
---
A T1 should be easily doable in a caracal, T2 and T3 in slightly better fit caracals.
---
:narrator voice: there are no unaffiliated groups left
---
Ok.
---
 Your most important social interaction with other players is seeing them in local?
---
Obviously sarcasm dude
---
Now they all appear empty. So lonely in here :\]
---
I come from a small null sec alliance and honestly its been super fun catching hunters in our space then bagging them because they expect you to be retard crab. Its fairly easy for small alliances to live in null they just have to learn to fight back and not warp out.
---
how do i downvote a post more than once?
---
the games depth is only as far as you want to go
---
I might not be in your corp but do paps! lol
---
Ez kills are ez.  That’s the whole point right?  Make it ez?  No longer have to work for it?
---
This. Best place to learn Eve, and not be swallowed up into a stale part of the game.  Avoid going into Nullsec bloc alliances, and the supposed "new-bro friendly corps" that make you skill their plans, buy their contracts (at inflated costs), etc.  Go explore Eve on your own!  Do the Missions. Join Eve University for a bit.  Join the "Bombers Bar" channel in game, skill into a bomber in a week, and go blow shit up with some other dudes.  And have fun!
---
The automod bot is currently a little broken and not is not updating the OP to show the modified discord link.
---
The correct discord link is: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek or you can use the perma link: animeistrash.org/eve
---
I don't know.  I am seeing a lot of new pilots call their "route" the "'autopilot".  I think we can all agree that having a route is good.  Using autopilot is bad.  Just seems that some newbros don't know the difference.
---
Turns out that was an unrelated attack, new word on the street is ccp.oops() happened
---
bro.... if people want to fly a horde of 9k EHP destroyers into hostile space.. let them.
---
there was a lot more going for the cyna than just "fast"
---
One of the most underutilized tools in EVE is the test server. You can freely practice there without the fear of losing isk. Just move yourself to M-OEE8 and ask people there who want to practice doing PVP. Usually, from experience there are people who are willing to practice with you, albeit not regularly. You can then practice on slingshotting, manual piloting and other nuances of solo PVP. You can also ask your corpmates if they want to practice with you.
---
Unless you're unsubbing 100 accounts, it in the noise.
---
Nope, i comment in Reddit too.
---
No.
---
yea it was also briefly the best entosis ship in the game and was heading cap fleets for a while
---
Questions I still can't wrap my head around:  
---
1. Why does Snuff continue to suck at the teet of Goons, and act as their vassel.
---
2. Why does Init feel its necessary to drop so many titans and prevent a good fight
---
3. Can Goons learn to fly anything besides Eagles, please?
---
Actually, we're a submarine game.
---
Spaceships? what spaceships?
---
Nooo come on they’ll give them their own little mini PANIC that auto activates at 50% armor
---
It will only make other (actually more fun and engaging) sources of income viable again, not just hordes of hundreds of afk vnis in havens.
---
Congratulations the the kill.
---
The smart move for players that can't pilot a ratting carrier/rorqual yet, will be to stay in highsec and farm abyssals until they can. Which is why I'm more interested in the change regarding the number of abyssal runs instead of (P)CU.
---
What if... No?
---
I'm trying to under what a corp with less than 150 members is supposed to do when getting punch by 5k man alliances that are part of the Imperium and/or the largest supercapital heavy alliance low sec has ever had (you).
---
Show up and feed dreads?
---
Yfw “blackout” was an idea that CCP came up with so you nerds wouldn’t notice the chat servers shitting themselves as often
---
A Hel of a job, even.
---
This is really cringy. Please delete.
---
&gt;But life in the nullsecs is  transforming: you need to create your own economy, build the power grid,  plan mining, production and distribution of goods.  
---

Beep boooop wanq guang bot reporting:confirming blackout  ruined  player interaction
---
A cyno alt on a single account is worthless.  Next.
---
One thing that is interesting, that hasn't been complained about is :  the index decay.  At some point, lesser used systems that are not worked as much are going to decay, pushing miners and anom runners into few and fewer systems.  Those systems are going to jump out at smart people on dotlan, which might drive up content and kills.  I am surprised that enough decay hasn't hit yet for 'still playing, but where are my corpmates' players to notice their colossal is gone.

What secrets is your wife keeping from you since you two clearly have such awesome communication and awareness with each other.

I mean... good for you  I guess but this is all serious cringe here man.

Get some grip on your life

go take a shower, nerds
---
I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but [this](https://youtu.be/AG_9Itz7z7I) is probably in the cards for you.
---
my hero &lt;3
---
with your alts reddit accounts
---
what makes them atractive is you can drop 1 drone on 5 rocks, tab out for a while, and tab back in to free isk. The thing can easily do 400k ehp, 600k pretty casually, over 800k with bling. They can hit a mil heated with dual command bursts. An orca is just not going to die, it can be left for a long ass time and it's got a big ore hold.
---
I am well aware of that but there’s nothing interesting or meaningful about it and in any event not worth the excessive serverload
---
put the blunt down friend
---
You play eve and don’t know how to multibox?  
---
Come on man
---
&gt; I was expecting like 40% online drop.
---
I imagine we are seeing something like a 40% drop in the Null population.  people overestimate how many people are actually around in null and underestimate the hisec population.
---
So there's still hope for you :)
---
I once got hot dropped by a Titan while I was leading a small gang (5 pilots IIRC) in t1 cruisers.
---
It was all for the pun.
---
Thank you, Falcon... I can't express how much this means to me.
---
&gt; One consequence of null-sec local blackout is it had made EVE less social. 
---
I haven't seen any evidence of this.    Null is still every bit as anti-social as it always was.
---
I can tell you exactly what will happen and how it will happen without any risk of The Plan~ being jeopardized. Reddit has unwittingly flexed it's voting potential to put Olmeca Gold onto the CSM. There is a reason Olmeca Gold didn't appear on any Imperium ballots. We couldn't allow for any indication that we actually wanted him on the CSM. Not even to our line members, it had to be you; reddit that put him there...
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the [/r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve) crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
All of this will happen and there isn't a damn thing any of you can do about it. Even if a small percentage of you are self aware enough to accept what is happening, it's already too late. The election is over and no amount of information control will halt the downfall of reddit voter turnout.
---
The past 3 years I have canvased here knowing full well that you would never willingly accept The Key~ to your shackles even if presented to you. The ultimate argument inoculation, the ultimate dead agenting of an enemy group. It's too late, there is nothing you can do. I have already won.
---
Shower? o.0

It is in the overview settings, just quicker to right click and remove from overview. I can't remember what the overview settings is called but there is a tab where you can select/deselect everything you want to be shown to you. Might even worth be grabbing one of the public overviews and tweaking it as you go.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I originally started out using Z-S Overview (in game channel name), makes life a lot easier when everything is sorted correctly but just use what ever you're comfortable with, o7

nah it's all about the salt. Well, that and getting dropped on by caps literally every singe time we killed something, but still getting the kill and ust moonwalking out.
---
sorry sir mine jiaoben not support more than one reddit sorry

&gt;What actually happened:

"Hey honey, you were up late yesterday?"

"Yeah, found this new game. Pretty fun"

"Hmm, what's it called?"

"Eve"
---
*wive nods, trying to act interested* "Nice."

---
&gt; CCP's told us they haven't planned to 
---
There’s two elements of unreliability here:
---
- CCP’s word aint worth that much
---
- even if it would be, just because they haven’t planned anything _yet_ doesnt mean they wont in the future, especially if you consider the significant tank differences resulting from these changes, even when you take into account neuting vulnerability and certain case specific midslot utility versus lowslot damage considerations
---
Playing EVE in secret and everyone knowing you play EVE isn't that much of a difference from my experience
---
replace  **wife**  with ***waifu***
---
ftfy

 :thonking:
---
Lynyrd Skynyrd - Free Bird
---
He's busy staring at himself in the mirror with his new wig on.
---
Lets see what will be the CCP decision.      
---
Like for us the online numbers are "like wtf those people are actually still playing" while for CCP this can be "like wtf we lost so many subs".     
---
But now that you are a **CSM** member , a thing you can maybe think of.          
---
Don't know since when do you play but do you remember the old roaming days and used at this time Cynabal?     
---
Look at some fits before 2012.                
---
It was one of the best roaming ships at this point and since then eve changed a lot.            
---
We are currently using T2/T3 destroyers that have more EHP, speed and firepower than those old cruisers.            
---
They are smaller and faster - **a power creep that will lead to subcapital ratting dying out**            
---
Like EHP on the ratting ships didn't change much and with all this DPS ratting ships melt and don't have slight chance to do anything against attackers.              
---
**If CSM not address this issue we will end up with carriers as primary ratting ships - as only they will survive long enough (aka &gt;3min) for someone to come and try to save you from 5 man gang.
---
It's amusing to me, all the hate for 'krabs' and miners wince the blackout began.. You guys do know your ships don't appear out of thin air, right? Sooner or later, price increases will come back to bite you in the ass. While I've been enjoying the blackout, if it' becomes the long-term status quo, it really is an insult to a home who plays the game more for the PVE aspects. People acting like that's not a valid play style really need to pull their heads out of their ass. It's a game after all, people can enjoy it however they want.
---
Confirmed virgin. ;)
---
o\ ... oh boi
---
I don't understand why playing EVE or any game would be something you can't tell your significant other?
---
GOOD
---
New feature:
---
All modules are blacked out - will you triage? will you activate your cyno? will you accidentally aggress instead of MWDing?
---
Truly Eve on hard mode.
---
A fake salt
---
Ratting payouts aren't market regulated, they are fixed.
---
Clearly you have never played a game of good touch bad touch with your local spiritual community leader... some games are just too good to share with others.
---
What should I do when the blackout goes too blackout and blacks out corp/alliance chat?
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
I've been in almost all the big corps, EUTZ. I could count the amount of times people spoke in local socially on one hand. If it's not memes/gifs from the fleet passing through OR a gf, it was silent. Corp chat, alliance chat or teamspeak/discord/mumble have always been the places to go if you want to talk to someone.
---
I don't disagree that something needs to be done to the botters, but a to cast such a hard and intrusive net isn't right as well.  Imagine if CCP decided next week that the Drifter Invasion has overrun Concord and that in 48hrs all of high sec would have a sec status of .4 or less.  The community in high sec would be in a rage, not because it is a continuation of the evolution of the Drifter invasion but because the whole game for them changed overnight.  
---
There is no difference for me ratting or mining with a character or two in Null than a having 20-30 skill farmers in Jita that never leave the station.  Or finding ways to speed run in Assault Frigs these sites (can't recall the specific name) in high sec for billions of isk in perfect safety by using an alt in an NPC corp.
---
People forget that nullsec people have alts in all places.        
---
I can say that a lot of less stuff is moving in higsec.      
---
As a ganker you feel change of how the people are moving stuff.
---
Waiting for some one to yell adapt or die.
---
I've been saying about the big groups vs little groups since this started. Small groups now have a choice to make for pve activities
---
Get into one of the big alliance blobs with an umbrella
---
Stay out of any blob and be farmed regularly 
---
Close down shop, stop pve or head out of null.
---
Any of the choices are great because each one results I'm the big blocks consolidating their power further and becommimg stronger and safer. 
---
With any luck next years war might be 30 thousand in local at the same time with 6,000 titans blasting away at each other in a week long battle. It will be the mother of all battles
---
You are a newbie.
---
Sad thing is I'm a &lt;1 year newbie and even I can tell.
---
Pvpers don't need the ability to talk in game, they have their own elite circle jerk places to post and chat. One of them is here, which should be obvious due to how hard you're being downvoted. 
---
It's okay, let them rot. If they want content they can come to highsec and gank or fight the mega blob in null.
---
Can't say I have but it sounds like I'm missing out :(
---
whats with the salt, had to shut down your bot farm or something? Did I blow you up last night?
---
POTUS plays EVE??? Cool! Who knew?
---
Undocking in a training clone is dumb, posting the loss in this way on here is dumber. You're not going to ruin Eve for your killer, you've just potentially ruined it for yourself. From now on, when your name is seen in local, you will be hunted. They're going to farm your elite salt like its going out of fashion. You'll be swamped upon like you're an rare enormous Veldspar annon. I almost feel bad for you.
---
Good look, fly safe, avoid reddit. o7
---
Reminder: Your fun doesn't matter to them, just theirs. Deny them their fun and watch them lose their minds.
---
it' a solid one.  also, can't go wrong with a game of soggy waffles
---
Now that you decloaked prepare to be constantly tackled by the wife. Be sure to find ECM and warp corp stabilizers.
---
Yep, but again this is next incentive to join big block.          
---
The less space and more people you have - the better.
---
They state in the gas huffing section that huffing gas in a prospect is not any better than using a venture. Let me tell you that I get 80m3 in 28 seconds. as opposed to 40 in 25 so they should probably have another go at their maths on that one.
---
wake me up when they also randomize the module position after every click.
---
Join the Constellation channel.
---
400 TITANS just hotdropped off grid
---
Giving you all free stuff! But our servers have "crashed"
---
Yes but his point is that, while you may be correct in the most technical sense, that's really all you are, because the net delta in social engagement is inconsequentially small.
---
How much did you end up losing?
---
I'm from the future, this is what the pvpers truely want. Problem is they weren't happy with the results. 
---
Make a note of this as quickly as you can, I've got extremely bad men coming after me to downvote this and hide the truth.
---
I just returned after a long break. I own a corporation containing just my friends and I. This corp has a singular office for which rent was payed during my ~18 month absence. When I checked the corp wallet however it seems that far more money was missing than I had anticipated.
---
After checking the wallet logs it turns out that most months the rent was around 10M but during a few months the rent climbed up as high as 90M.
---
So my question is, what determines the amount of rent I pay and how high can this rent get?
---
Furthermore, what would have happened to all the stuff in the corp hanger if the corp wallet would have been empty during my absence?
---
I’m so excited for the day when INIT has to make a choice between being a pet and being your friend. Hope they unlatch from the nipple and join you guys, truly. Made me excited about that last fleets defender list, thought the day had come.
---
My point is not about chatting in local but seeing the pilots around you, which makes game so much more alive.
---
Dude. Of course victim will never post this shit, it's me the killer..
---
Isk is getting inflated by bots and afk ratting.
---
By the way, there is no point to rat if you are not a bot.
---
Which I hear there is a little NIP expiring soon...
---
Oh look, another thinly veiled attempt to get local intel back
---
Yes please.
---
Snuff brings all the boys to the yard
---
I am saying that CCP shouldn't just go in and change the environment.  Imagine if next CCP was to announce that the Drifter Invasion has overran Concord and every high sec system would fall below a .5 sec status in 24hrs until Concord could regather its strength.  High sec players would be in a rage.  There is no difference in me as a small guy mining or ratting in somewhat safety than me having 20 skill farm accounts that never leave station.  Or being in high sec speed running sites for billions a day.
---
Nah, they're going to make it where you don't even equip fittings anymore. Everytime you undick your fittings are randomized. Don't have the skills? Better buy more injectors
---
Woah a r/eve meme with a format that isn't from 2012 already a good post
---
HA!
---
Do you even spai bruh?
---
In high sec they are AFK miners
---
&gt;What should I do?        
---
Don't mix RL and game, if you don't need it don't buy it.        
---
Beside this, do you really want to say to CCP "i will pay you more".      
---
This never ends well.
---
I think Desitny Jaded is actually the content driver now that I think about it lol
---
Definitely not on porpoise
---
You can totally stalk a streamer for 3 years. You could also shut him down for two weeks for no reason except hating miners/industrialists. You could also stream snipe him easily with agents/leaked intel on stream. You can outnumber the streamer every time by seeing his info on stream. Me? I get to take it up the ass all the time. Fun to be on the other side for once. Point is, you can do a lot to a cloaking streamer if you're a good and not a bad.
---
That actually made me laugh mate. Cheers
---
“What do you... ‘do’?”
---
“Well... we shoot these little asteroids using these little laser beams on these ships and with these droid thingys which then gives you stuff to use to use to like build stuff... I mean not like really build things like I need to build that fence out back but like more little space ship things... then when you build enough little spaceships you and these other pilots, well not like real airplane pilots but like people playing the game too with you can go out and like blow each other’s ships up... “
---
“So... what do you do???”
---
“Well then if you like win that battle you come back to your little station here see it has these little tower thingys on it and I guess little people live in it maybe... so anyway yeah you come back and then you go in your other ship again and go back out to where you were before and get more of those rocks...”
---
“Ok... but... what is like the point?  Is there like a scoreboard or something?”
---
“Well I guess, I mean I think the point is to like keep increasing this little number here by my persons face... see I made her look just like you babe!  Anyway yeah I’m trying to like always grow this to be like billions and billions”
---
“Well I don’t have green eyes and that’s a bit flattering of a pose... ok well I still don’t really get it why do you have to increase that number what’s it mean?  Why do you need to blow up other people to make that number bigger?  Is it score?”
---
“Hmmm well I guess if you shoot them and they die, not like really die just like have their little ship blow up, then their number goes down so there’s that... then if my number goes up I’m like that much further ahead... like addition by subtraction sorta thing i think...” 
---
“Oh... ok that’s nice dear... well have fun there I’m going to go to bed and probably vibe myself to sleep again... have fun dear”
---
14 is age, 88 is iq
---
&gt;Is there anyone not-renting that still lives in NS and isn't part of a big group?
---
Provi.
---
I think no local adds to the space atmosphere. The deep dark unknown, wondering what lurks in the shadows and then you can return to a trade hub and back to civilisation. Just a matter of perspective I guess
---
Rip
---
It sounds like you're looking for a newbie friendly small gang corp that will teach you how to play the game for real. Good. You have many options.
---
What kind of pvp playstyle are you looking for? There are a few things different groups focus on.
---
* Derp brawling. Fleets that largely do drive-by beatdowns on large targets, and when they find a fleet that can actually give them a fight, everybody on both sides goes home in pods, they laugh it up and grab another ship (and another beer). This is the playstyle of most nullsec newbie groups, as well as the more fun facwar groups. We do this as a corp in Dreddit a lot too, when we're not feeling especially tryhard.
---
* Alpha Fleets. Big fleets, anchor on the leader, shoot the broadcast target, try to blow through reps. Logistics ships repair people who get shot and hope they don't die before they can lock. Fly a more interesting role once you understand how things work, and maybe at some point unlock the elusive Fun. This is where you end up in alliance fleets in the big null blocs. If you're in one of these alliances, you're expected to join at least the really important fleets. Depending on how toxic the alliance is, it's varying degrees of optional.
---
* Solo / Coordinated Solo. These guys like to roll by themselves, but often will hit the same region as other corp members, so when a bigger fight is found, they can quickly form up. Most of the time they will fly nano gang shit.
---
* Nano ganging. The idea of being able to kite brawlers, and possibly brawl dedicated kiters, in a multi-role small gang. The ultimate form of tryhard pvp, you'll see just about every kind of ship in a small gang with the right comp. Everyone has to fly their own ship in the role they're expected to fill, including dpsing large targets, anti-tackle, short tackle, long tackle, ewar, repairs, sky's the limit. This is the kind of combat in the Alliance Tournaments.
---
You absolutely don't need to join a big bloc to get this kind of experience, with the exception of really big alpha fleets. Even then, the bigger faction war corps and a lot of wormhole groups will field these kind of fleets.
---
I don't want to bash the big null blocs too much because I run small gang in Dreddit like 3-4 nights a week, it's fun as fuck and we have a core of USTZ people that are great to roll with. We're still trying to git gud and be able to run nano gangs reliably, but it's a fun challenge. :)
---
Wait wait wait, aren't you supposed to treat every ratter as bait?
---
Nah I was evicting a wh actually last night but thanks for playing
---
sounds a lot like soggy biscuits, I always end up losing :(
---
You're fucking weird dude
---
Unsubb all your Rorqual accounts!
---
...also biomass your main character.
---
Lives up to his character name at least.
---
*nothing on d-scan* hmm guess noone is here, I'll just dock in the keepstar
---
*55 people docked* whoa! where did you guys come from?
---
Well I definitely wrong that read...!! FFS swear this brain of mine wants to see me fail lol. Nice kill dude, o7
---
It's called "Westworld", and it' much better.
---
For me WH space is space that i need to put a lot of attention to.        
---
By attention i mean constant dscans, probing and looking on details.     
---
Like honestly i tried to live in WH space but simply didn't like those aspects.         
---
Changing connection is actually fun thing.          
---
Te lack of asset safety is next bad thing for me.      
---
Get a life, wife, kids, job - then try to say "i am fine with losing everything" because my kid got sick and i had other stuff on my mind than a game.
---
so you shot a structure? That sounds really fuckin boring but I guess as long as you're getting what you need...
---
[The rental cost is dynamic and will change daily depending on how many of the available offices on the station are rented out.](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203209652-Corporation-Offices)
---
In terms of what would happen if you ran out of money: your assets would be impounded by CONCORD and you would have to pay a fee to recover them.
---
&gt; If CSM not address this issue we will end up with carriers as primary ratting ships
---
This is already the case with injectors and proliferation. You didn't need blackout for this.
---
Meanwhile, CCP can address cyno/umbrella/anom respawn mechanics to make capital ratting as risky as subcapital ratting.
---
Thanks for the ideas, will be sure to implement them if they can find my corvettes.
---

If all people do abyssals price will drop, but yeah plenty of places you can make decent isk.
---
Literally nothing is ever ok with you people. I could have said running level 3 delivery missions in high sec and there’d be some snarky bullshit comment.  Whatever. Have fun in your little bombers acting like anyone gives a shit.  Come in blow shit up it’s all literally replaced in 10 mins.  Quit acting all superior.  It’s a game.  Good lord.

OmegaLUL
---
40% online drop Lmao wtf were you smoking. You honestly think 40% of the population only plays in null?
---
The members of the old corp are for the most part in the alliance
---
I wish you weren't so fuckin' awkward, bud.
---
Server is already back up ya goose
---
I really hope they do this or  they add some tool to allow people to punch up better (like a suicide bomber or something so that you lose things and they lose things...explosions everywhere.)

Here's some of the pilots I watch for PvP tips.
---
[Suitonia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-ySys2dORr8gKx1-t9QAA)
---
[Bjorn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoVIh3egdRSnpV_O_sxRTUA)
---
[Blights wretch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWF7tXZFt-iaXWO0qB64Tw) (Lowsec PvP mainly)
---
[Goat Allu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Tls_P_bs4pgqLgOoNV6HQ) (Nullsec PvP mainly)
---
Suitonia and Blights wretch are very newbro friendly tips on T1 stuff whereas Goat and Bjorn are just general solo PvP.
---
They are all really good pilots and definitely worth a watch as the content is outstanding.
---
Can log into character select. But then it hangs there.
---
It's slightly deceptive there has been a lot of power creep especially in the area of mining and production over the past couple of years.  The real concern is the active isk delta on the ISK Sinks &amp; Faucets slide being a negative number.  Considering that Faucets still outpace Sinks that means quite a few players have become inactive.  It represents a 5% decrease of the money supply in a single month.
---
Shut up your not going to unsub fucking carebear.
---
I had 0 interest until the hull timer got fucked last week, I don't enjoy staying up to 4am :(
---
Considering the demand spike on MCT a couple of weeks ago till this date, I expect quite a large part of that online count to be cloaked skill farming alts parked on gates.
---
Personally my miningbarge alts have not been used for anything except cloaked space cams since blackout hit.
---
Sub count is probably up, but the amount of active players or more specifically potential targets is most likely way down.
---
Yes and no actually. 
---
Yes its actually safer now than ever, in that standing fleet is huge now. At any given time there are easily 10-20 faxes on standby, with titans supers dreads and carriers all anxiously waiting for content when someone gets tackled. 
---
No, it's much less safer, but for the annoying time zone tanking small groups who simply don't have the resources for a standing fleet like it. I don't think they are enjoying null pve now, but they shouldn't be enjoying it at all.  It was ridiculous that tiny groups could come and set up shop in a pocket and be profiting from moon goo, and ratting in their 6.0 adm timezone tanked null systems.
---
Hopefully this change may finally force these roaches out of null and leave it for the big boys to grow as it was meant to be. If not then at the very least they can now be farmed like cattle and learn to enjoy being a source of loot, or leave.

Your shitty corp alone has more people in it than Fweddit. My sides.

What do you mean faucets still outpace sinks?
---
Ok being honest here.        
---
If there is a 100 - 400 people sitting in some space.     
---
They are having defensive fleets up - they have all right to deny this 5 man gang kills.            
---
There is no way you can persuade me to change my opinion on this.
---
Yup, it was cool that there was usually one dude who would keep his rorq logged in all day in a fleet just to help out newbros who wanted to mine. I always thought it was a nice thing to do, since they didn't really benefit from it.
---
Thank you for championing this Falcon. Eve has needed this for a long time. Keep fighting the good fights.
---
No worries, and thank you! I think everyone should have a few kills of butthurt krabs in his/her collection, otherwise what's the point of playing eve?
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Or much simpler: just blame it on the drifters
---
The winners of the blackout are big null block, super safe high sec sub cap manufactures and low sec small gang oriented PvP groups. Two of those 3 groups didn't need any help.  
---
The losers are anyone else in null that isn't turtled up under a super cap umbrella.
---
Like this post, lots of people are trying to put a positive spin on it, but it's like ccp just threw its collective hands up and said " we can't figure out how to fix what we started breaking with Dominion, so let's just throw something at the wall and hope it sticks".
---
It's not the end of the world. It does make me happy that my decision to not ever own a super or a rorq turned out to be the right one. I just moved one alt to high sec to do incursions and abyssals and leave null for PvP so all good.
---
It just sucks to see celebrating something that hit the small teams hard while making the big groups even more attractive. That the opposite of what should have happened.
---
&gt; the citadel was missing in space (cloaked perhaps?), 
---
If you hated cloaky campers before, just wait until you get a hostile Keepstar decloaking on your grid while you're ratting.
---
Sperg on Reddit.  What else?
---
I looked at dotlan and most of null is dead now. Npc kills are almost nonexistent save for a couple systems here and there with a few kills in 24 hours. Then there is delve lol... even gate jumps are few and far between aside from previously common travel routes. 
---
Really you are correct in that not much has changed, its just harder to avoid a fight now because you don't know when your gonna ram head on into another gang.
---
 Which is great btw.
---
Lol thank you for showing up and literally giving out free tears. 
---
Look dude you can't show up and shit talk, then cry when you get a little back.
---
The feeling of the vastness of space is real and is manifested in this latest iteration of the story. Keep it coming!
---
Seriously, totally my bad. Respect to Provi for that!
---
(but fuck Amarr!)
---
Just use the real server and a 10m destroyer or frig. Contrived scenarios like test server fights miss a lot of the nuance of actual fights. 
---
If you’re practicing fighter mechanics sure, go to Sisi, but don’t bother for t1 subcap pvp
---
So this is how our war ends, both sides retire due to mutual boredom?  Shame, was fun while it lasted.
---
I really hope it is fixed in the next hour so I can actually play
---
WWB2? Did I miss it? Because the Tribute Glassing was a lot, but sure as fuck not WWB2.
---
This is gay AF
---
Well said. I want a drunk drake roam now.
---
&gt;There is no upper limit.
---
My God, what must people be paying for their offices in Jita IV?
---
Hmm
---
While i understand the need for balancing, it still leaves a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. 
---
I've just finished skilling up an alpha toon into best alpha skill set for gila and worm. Now i'm going to have a lot of sp that is useless and counting towards other things i have foregone on order to specialize. 
---
Also i think this might make it alot more difficult ti finish abyssal frigate sites in the worm. But i guess that wasn't meant to be soloed :)
---
Rorqs and barges boosted by rorqs are going to continue mining. It's the subcaps ratters (namely VNIs) that are going to struggle, and that will lead to a drop in the value of materials versus ISK. We're not going to see a price increase in basic mats in Delve, at least not when you consider the fact that actual ISK generation is slowing down much more than mats.

What's Querious Fight Club? What do they do?
---
I don't deal in your kind of absolutes. There are many parameters here. I can bring a 100 man fleet instead of a 5 man fleet. You can stack 10k accounts per umbrella rather than 50k. You can deny 90% of all kills instead of 99%. Etc.
---
The utter extreme safety of umbrella regions was bad in both denial of kills and content and in shitty macroeconomic effects (like faucets which is the main things CCP historically wanted to address). Those facts do not care about what you personally think is fair for a group that maintains a big umbrella.
---
There's more money coming in through bounties etc than is going out through things like npc sales taxes.
---
Fucking incompetents
---
Next step ; when you undock , you undock in a random location.
---
depends on your perspective ;)
---
You can’t just put “truth be told...” at the front of your bullshit opinion and expect people to buy it as fact.  
---
Truth be told... this local chat change is a complete knee jerk reaction that will have collateral damage beyond the perception of making any space dangerous and ccp should have addressed the mechanics that make the big blue spaces safe.  Bridges, cynos, structure, etc.
---
Before you start whining about cynabals and destroyers, how about you look at the fact that a supercarrier can point and web you while applying "fuck you" dps to any size subcap faster than many cruisers.  
---
Fix capital and supercapital application to subs first, that's way less healthy for the game than power creep within subcaps.
---
Holy shit show what a threat :)
---
Make anoms "deplete". If you have 50 people running them nonstop on a system, they should stop spawning there for at least a couple days.
---
Everything seems dumb and meaningless if you over analyze it!.. incidentally thats probably why i am a nihilist!
---
Its hard enough to retain players. Gimping an alpha clone to faction guns is not advisable.
---
Plus t2 guns is not really what botters used. The drones was the main issue.
---
Yea, he's a pet too :/
---
I know! We had like 10 whole dudes there last night. We sounded the war horn for sure.
---
Honest question, what does active isk delta mean then?
---
Then just limit it to allies within a war &amp; allow for defenders in 2 seperate wars to merge the war?
---
Absolute state of /r/eve
---
Could you give few examples of these bands?
---
I like EVE too! But TL;DR.
---
lol, well it's not quite what I meant but sure enough, I've seen that happen to at least one streamer. What I meant was that there's nothing you can do to them WHILE they're cloak streaming out at the gate, unless they themselves decide to move on. :)
---
That's why you mine with containers.
---
You can comfortably run covs with a container, since it's just dragging ore every 10 seconds or so.
---
Most of the nerds posting here wouldn't notice.
---
*understand    
---
I don't understand what your point is? Nowhere did I shame them for batphoning that many people, because that's what we expect for them to do since they've been working as a coalition and forming 200 man fleets, I only stated that we planned for it this time.
---
I like the way you approached EVE, well done.

You can always do incursions in high sec. Not available to starting players, but it's a great source of income after a few months.
---
You can always do incursions in high sec. Not available to starting players, but it's a great source of income after a few months. Or even L4 missions, which have similar isk/hr to vni ratting.

People will just go with kikis or assault frigates for similar results.

I'm not a fan of multiboxing per say, but unfortunately it's the only way to play EVE efficiently in null sec. Bothering people to scout you around or haul your rocks from belt is just not how corps work these days.

Kinda out of the acronym loop, what does MER mean? Something moon related?
---
Blackout hasn't been online for long enough to really have an impact, it will need to last more than a month because of knee-jerk reactions of ratters not logging in because of it. Eventually, they'll log back in and adapt when there are fewer hunters, because basically all of them logged in for the first 2 weeks because it's a new thing and fewer will log off as the "newness" of it all disappears.

Battleships should counter caps but nope haw weapons changed that.
---
REEEEE
---
Lebowski thanks for replying.
---
Why not just make it so only allies within a war can assist oneanother (as they should because they are part of the war now).
---
And then add a feature to allow defenders to merge wars against a common enemy. Example:
---
Team A Attacks B
---
Team A Attacks C
---
Currently B &amp; C can't help eachother.
---
B &amp; C talk &amp; decide to merge wars and are now allies (as they were both defenders before getting attacked from the same enemy).
---
B &amp; C can now both fight A and also remote assist eachother.
---
Nah man come on down.  Water's fine.
---
I really hope they revert the minerals back to security status deliminators again.  Mixing the minerals throughout was an awful idea.
---
I am pretty sure it's not worth moving over a month until the next MER gets posted.
---
I am also pretty sure Olmeca never said "I will always hunt in the region which is on top of the MER". I could be wrong on this one, but I don't care enough to go through the post and comment history.
---
I’m not “crying” or any other bullshit.  You come here acting all superior “oh BB got it good thanks test turds” like anyone gives a shit about your gloat.  No one does.  It’s an annoyance nothing more.  We’re like, “sigh I’ll go get mah spare rorqual I guess they’ve moved on”.  You’re the one needing perspective.  I didn’t post “oh BB killed my excavators wahhhhh”.  I said no one cares for your bragging.  You didn’t clearly get enough atta boys growing up and now you need a participation trophy for showing up on a marshy fleet and pressing F1 when he tells you.  BB is literally the same shit they claim to hate about big blue.  Fleet up.  Anchor on fc.  Decloak when they say.  Press F1.  “Collect salt”.  Blah whatever.  Like I said this playstyle hasn’t changed.  BB has always been a thing.  Your accomplishments are watered down now because it’s a lot easier.  Even marshy posted in your discord how easy the kills are now.  
---
Go on your fleets.  Have some fun. Idc what you do.  But it’s just a complete mischaracterization to say im a loser for bashing an abandoned astra with my friends hoping to find a few months worth of plexable assets to sell.
---
I guess you live in delve... Lol
---
Absolutely, but they weren't at first.
---
Facts, you obviously don't know what the word means.
---
Yeah the 5 dollar starter pack with 1 mil sp is great but that only takes to level 5 four of the rank 1 skills.
---
A few months of training and not being able to fly at least an assault frigate would be a shame.
---
It's kind of in the Advanced Military Career agents arc, I just think most people tend to disregard it.
---
Faucets are isk added, isk going from NPCs to players, bounties, mission rewards etc.  
---
Sinks are isk removed, isk going from Players to NPCs, taxes, skill books, BPOs etc.
---
During the last month 85.4 Trillion isk was given to players by NPCs and 63.6 Tillion was went from players to NPCs.
---
Isk that hasn't been used in a while goes inactive.  Basically active isk delta is the isk from people rejoining the game minus isk from people going inactive.
---
can you set your dscan to show you ships AND deployables? or is it only just one of the two
---
Yes, because there is no hypocrisy in ignoring the fact the MER of Delve is low because of a deployement that has ended
---
Monthly Economic REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Don't tell anyone, but I lose on purpose
---
They’ve already had cloaky campers in esoteria and impass for a couple months now.  They moved with goons deployed.  Since the MER shows clearly gooons being deployed, and now they’re back in delve your logic is completely flawed.  Olmeca knows goons are back. Mittens told everyone that goons would be back.  Y’all need to get some opsec behavioral standards and hide ya cards better.
---
&gt;Maybe more nerfs are incoming, we'll have to see, but until shield has been nerfed so much that slaves only get you pre-slave stats, you're the dumbest fuck.
---
I'm with you here. And if you don't want to keep the second acc for too long you can always transfer a character. 
---
I'd buy the thing from time to time if it has been reasonably cheaper.
---
That’s not necessary.  When people say this community is toxic you’re why.
---
Nabbed a carrier last night. If you asked him I’m pretty sure he’d say that this blackout didn’t benefit him. His homies didn’t see us in local 8 jumps out and tell him to dock up like they usually do.
---
He chose Delve due to the ISK they produced and pointed at the MER as evidence that we were the most target rich environment. He always has claimed it was not a Goon bias, he was just following the numbers. The numbers has been steadily moving to other groups. Yet there he sits in Delve.
---
As if we could hide what we are doing
---
Are you writing this from past experience? Who tf talks like that?
---
This is incorrect.. legacy only holds sov because they diplo’d with goons, you having supers does nothing.
---
They moved cc into eso when goons deployed in the glassing ass eating campaign.  The mer shows the goons doing glassing north.   Now that goons are back DPC will undoubtably be back where the gettin is good.  Good ole goons country.
---
Yup if goes both ways. Delve has lots of isk but so do the guys hunting there sometimes. They know what they’re doing and they know they’re probably going to die if they aren’t quick.
---
The first image isn't clickable.
---
Just bad stupid logic by a dumb goon.  Nothing more
---
Maybe try?  Idk

Sorta. I'm usually found in Keberz actually.

Nah man... they have supers the rewards are fine.

I was watching his stream with the intent to snipe since I saw the jcode and hs. But when I realized how far it was from me I decided it was too much work. So, I said hello in chat and offered a few wh tips.

He brought up a prior Wingspan delivery and some feedback for the agent. Joked about needing deliveries. 
---
I posted the feedback in our slack for comedic effect and that post received some broader attention.

They are. The game encourages this risk averse, subhuman behaviour. If we cannot rise above it we will all die. Same as the short sighted attitudes towards large scale problems in the real world. Everyone is just stuck in the rat race.
---
CCP needs to make changes, but the playerbase needs to become human.
---
A long time ago, I mined in a similar fleet in hisec, with 1 orca and my barge and we split it according to the time we started mining and ended mining and were handed out isk or ore according what we wanted. We were  paid according to the ship and the miner we used (Strip Miner 1 or 2). It's not the complicated to do with 10-20 people.
---
Bro... you just posted cringe... Not a good look, bro

Hard to hide a couple of trillion isk import value.

Yeah idc anymore really.
---
It's under the filters &gt; states menu.

---
AFK isk is AFK isk. They have a much bigger ore hold (12km3 total for Proc, 22km3 + 5%/level for Retriever and 180km3 + 5%/level for Orca). Don't forget to take warping to a station and back to the asteroid field in the yield, those barges don't warp quickly.
---
It's been a week of farming bots, bots are largely docked up. There are some near3 bots STARTING to get eyes on stuff, so you have to be patient, set logoff traps, cloaky camp, but it's still VERY easy to kill bots.
---
Of course all of this works on human ratters too.
---
I guess the number of targets is still high enough to justify staying in Delve. So maybe Delve should try not to look like a target rich environment.
---
As me and others have been pointing out: Goons are back in Delve, mining and ratting numbers will go back up in the next MER
---
Shut up bisu
---
This would be fucking great. I second this. Caps should be at a significant disadvantage trying to hit subcaps unless they're using smart bombs or something similar.
---
If they are going to do this CCP should add a communications hub either as an upgrade to the ihub or preferably as a separate structure that adds normal local.   make them decently easy to destroy and it would add another conflict driver.
---
nErf SuPeRcaP bLObs

It made null more stable. With minerals spread more equally across all regions. It means people don't gotta fight for resources. They just gotta set up a base of operations. Blow the nearest nullbloc to not be destroyed. Agree to be farmed by said nullbloc and begin production. 
---
Rather boring.
---
Blackout eve ccpls. I want to be free!
---
... as someone who only plays eve with chat minimized. Welcome to my world :)
---
Hey,  I'm exploring some options and have a few questions:
---
1. How is NPC null different than the rest of null? I am not sure I ever understood that and I haven't spent much time in null.
---
2. With the blackout, is it viable for solo player / tiny group to move out there to roam and find fights around NPC null? 
---
3. Has the blackout really changed much w/ null? I like wormholes, but the constant scanning to find nothing is getting pretty annoying, which has been happening a lot lately leading me to log off unsatisfied. Blacked out null seems like it would be ideal and day trip into wormholes when I have extra time instead.
---
Cheers! thanks in advance.
---
I agree it made null more stable but I disagree that it made people fight over minerals persay.  Minerals werent ever really fought over as they are abundant but it did essentially murder the economic eco system of transferring the various minerals back and forth between null and high sec.
---
well how many supers are 19.3 TRILLION isk?

Yeah they're intel bots

---
Eh. I was on the honeybadger coalition side of the fountain war. I can't remember who lived in paragon soul. But the amount of fleets we went on to strip them of their moons supports my experience.  
---
However I do recognize that that particular conflict was tribe vs whoever the fuck lived there.
---
But eve does, has and will change .
---
And people still think the blackout was a feature
---
if your rorq is even *close* to 10b plus you're doing it very wrong.

---
Prices for Tritanium are way up with the trade volume being roughly the same as in 2008, which looks like inflation to me.
---
But on to the real issue because ISK is completely irrelevant here:
---
When someone consumes PLEX worth $20 then CCP gained $20, period. It doesn't matter how many times it's being resold and for what (ISK, $, apples or hookers...) because once it's gone the consumer needs another PLEX worth $20. Doesn't matter how he gets it because the chain originally always starts at $20 for CCP.
---
The actual misconception here is that companies are supposedly losing money if their products are being resold when in reality they are just not getting free money from resales. Coorporate whining about this for decades won't make it a real issue either, ffs.
---
And finally, neither did I make the claim that CCP thinks RMT is good, nor did I claim that RMT increases PLEX sales. I asked you to provide evidence for your claim that RMT causes an actual, *loss* in PLEX sales.
---
Pretty sure thats not how that works..
---
Trafalgar went back to prison.
---
Is there another way to explain shortly the game to nonplayers?
---
Uh, if you're talking about moons, that's an entirely different thing.
---
Moon minerals are as regional as ever.
---
Except that if you have a newborn there's no way you can play a game in secret overnight. Remember those little things are killers of all timezone tanking.
---
Nice try though.
---
At least OP is justifying his username.
---
Implying that was not already the case for non-afk/bot activity.
---
Shit are they? I thought the moon minerals were shook up so each region could be self sufficient.
---
While I do agree that test server fights doesn't encapsulate all the nuances of PVP, I do think it's highly valuable if you want to practice specific mechanics like kiting, slingshotting and whatnot. There's a reason why most corps who hold combat classes do it on SiSi and why AT teams used it for scrims. You'll need to have a training partner for those things though.
---
But all in all, I do agree with jesusrambo that nothing really beats training with actual combat. What I'm suggesting is more of a supplement than anything else.
---
A quick tip for someone starting to learn kiting; use a tormentor with a drone. You can launch drones and start kiting away from it with mwd. After that, return your drone to bay (Shift + R) and try your best to kite away from it and not letting it get to you. You can then try keeping a specific distance away from the drone while it's trying to return to your drone bay. You can also try different drones since they have different speeds. This gives you a very BASIC idea on how to kite properly. This is the fit that I used when I did this awhile ago:
---
[Tormentor, Training]
---
Capacitor Power Relay I
---
Overdrive Injector System II
---
Warp Disruptor II
---
Cap Recharger II
---
5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive
---
Acolyte II x1
---
Ah I see the miscommunication here.  Moon Goo or Moon ore is not the same as minerals.  Minerals are just the base 8 minerals used to build t1 stuff and include also morphite as an asteroid mineral.  Moon Ore is different and to my understanding I thought It was spread out between regions already?
---
I just remember the tech moon bullshit and the shake up that saw everything burned to the ground
---
Well NPC null has stations you can dock in and repair your ships, stash loot etc. You can also stash loot in any citadel by using the 'deposit cargo' option, but then the only way to get it out is via asset safety that costs 15%.
---
At least 2

Both the hunt and the chase are one of the most fun parts of solo/small gang PVP in my opinion. Those cat and mouse games really get my blood pumping.

A few days ago we were talking about it with my corpmates, and we all agreed that some times you can have an amazing time doing that even if noone ends up dead for one reason or another.

its almost like there are fixed keybinds based on the order, most(all?) of them taken up by the enforced defaults. So no, its not just scroll down.

More oversimplified post, yeah, that's what we need here.

Haha, no, he chose Delve because he's anti-Goon.  He's anti-Goon because Goons are the most powerful entity in New Eden and he's an NC/PL guy.
---
I'm currently playing as alpha. f2p is never meant to allow you to access the whole game, you should feel like you are missing out, otherwise you would just be content playing for free and not even plexing. before the game went f2p, you would get 3 weeks of trial, which was plenty to earn a plex if you knew how to make pretty quick money (back then anyway, not now, with plex prices being 3x what they were). 
---
my main complaint about alpha limits is the lack of access to a cloak. that's a much bigger gimp than lacking acces to tier 2 weapons. I mean hell, take large weapon access from alphas entirely for all I care, but the prototype cloak limit is just bs. that is actually an integral part of early gameplay, tech 2 and large weapons are not.
---
Would not really work well since you cannot easily move a missionrunning operation constantly. For one you usually have several (3-7) ships for different missions. You need standings to efficently run missions. So if your agent lands in a bad space you are done until he moves again. That includes things like landing too close to lowsec (&lt;3 jumps) or landing in highsec islands.
---
Also what is bad about mission hubs? Nice places to meet people, buy from /sell to them or suicide/canflip them.
---
Any stats? The only stat you provided is that we have a large decrease in players. Nobody knows how many were bots and how many weren’t.
---
Provi will tell you them but in the end they are aligned with Legacy when it comes to strategic operations.
---
Issue is sitting in a nullsec anom with a cap is by far the easiest, best and most relyable way to make isk nowadays.
---
Please give me a comprehensive list of sovereign nullsec alliances thare truly neutral (sorry provi) that actually want to colonize and empire build in said colonized space.
---
I actually stated that it is small.
---
This was roleplaying?   I feel dirty now.
---
Fun fact, there's more materials entering the EVE economy than they are leaving it. Less mining for a while is great for the overall health of the game, and the "While" can be pretty long, since there's literal tons of materials simply stockpiled everywhere. 
---
And when price increases, mining will be better for miners, too.
---
I miss it a lot. It was safe guaranteed income for me for a long time. The nice thing was others didn't know much about moon goo so you kept it nice and quiet, and just didn't tell the peasants, while you made billions upon billions every month.  There is too much sharing sharebear be fair hipster crap in this game now. 
---
But now the cats out of the bag and the peasants tasted the goo already, it won't ever come back to how good and proper set up it used to be. At least many of us cashed in hard back in the day while we could.
---
 wait, alphas have t2 small ships?

20 years married, and my other half will tell you its cause of EvE -  Shes done a few Sister of Eve FF things.   I'd be in the pub if it weren't for EvE....
---
Would you mind linking both of your fits? As far as I can see they huff exactly the same amount and the only benefit is with Prospect cargohold. If I'm wrong then I'll correct it.
---
Oh Lorenzo is defo a Bot
---
Yeah I mean they showed up in esoteria when goons deployed so we had him here during June
---
Instead, Olmeca deals in his own kind of absolutes.
---
Yeah, no shit. This is a facepalm thread.
---
This is no longer true with moons in high sec producing the previously Null sec minerals.  The things worth mining in null going forwards a re pretty much going to be moon ore ( for the moon materials), Mercoxit, ICE, and Gas sites.  But it is likely that the base minerals for non super umbrella players will no longer be worth mining so long as these things can be mined in High Sec.  (im probably forgetting some things to mine but oh well.)
---
is that all you could pull from the moon mining schedule? because honestly you deserve credit, that's about twice as many characters as you pulled for PvP ops a year ago.
---
Lets brainstorm a new game we can continue this war. Maybe Crowfall or ??
---
_This is my wig. There are many like it, but this one is mine_
---
The problem is easy and has 2 parts that ccp has control over. 1. Titans and capitals need to be support ships that make sub caps better not ultimate faceroll ships. 2. Capitals and super caps need a small gang counter.
---
You’re welcome! Enjoy eve!
---
Usually the lack of access to t2 ships is where i would have thought the fear of missing out feelings set in for alphas, not the t2 guns.
---
You know what's funny? The most risk averse players in eve are so called pvpers. 9 times out of then, everyone runs away if they dont have overwhelming numbers yet we say the pve crowd is soooo risk averse. They are the ones blinging their ships to increase their ticks. Lol people make me laugh on here.
---
Prospect doesn't have any additional bonuses to huffing over the Venture except for increased ore hold. 
---
Are you sure you Venture doesn't have T1s huff mods fitted? They cycle quicker but harvest less.
---
I think that was kinda their point
---
Bots cant speak
---
Do you have possibly the best job ever?
---
Rapid heavies, dps, scram grapple maybe a booster, and double ASB. Ecm drones, fill the rest in as necessary. Don't ever put an ecm module anywhere near it.
---
No, this didn't exist before because the umbrellas knew where the hunters were, within two regions. 
---
Now there's actually a decent chance to get a fight and some kills, *before* you get dropped.
---
I imagine we spent less time shitting up discord which allowed us to focus on getting some big ships. I guess I didn't know we had such a fanclub. Good to know we have admirers.
---
Boo!
---
If I wanted to worry about mass efficiency I'd live in a wormhole
---
I mean not really admirers, more like when you break up with someone and still stalk their Facebook kind of thing.
---
No there really isn’t.  I was being deliberately cringy because OP is like off the deep end here with his little scene he’s posted.  Barf.  
---
The genre is not really mainstream.  To explain it sounds like a second job (which it largely is).  The gaming world evolved to the 10 minute adrenaline rush of battle royale.  Even WoW has adapted over the year ls and lost lots of their palyerbase.  They have arguably Done a better job with adapting but a theme park mmo can do that whereas a sandbox is beholden to its inhabitants.   Eve largely hasn’t and has paid the price in attendance.  Which if you really step back, this is the overall fundamental “problem”.  That people’s attn spans have gotten way shorter, their reward requirements have gotten much more frequent, and the complexities have all but evaporated.  
---
None of these are necessarily eve problems.  It’s a headwind.  Eve is in a place where the fight for new players and the demand on retention could potentially conflict.  On one hand they need to attract and retain new people which means, fundamentally the game needs to be slower and simpler and less punitive.  On the other are the invested vets who have made eve a lifestyle decision and will struggle with changes or anything that makes their investment feel less valued.  
---
It’s not a great place to design a game from.  Fighting against human nature to collaborate while designing at its core a spacecraft battle game over turf.  Making it feel like there’s reward in owning a turf but not so daunting that a smarter faster hungrier group can’t come take it from you.  
---
Ultimately if I was ccp I would just make the hard decision to make the game very newbro friendly.  If it means pissing off the bitter old vets so be it.  But taking local away from null sec doesn’t make the game more newbro friendly.  They’re just disorganized and grasping for anything and don’t appear to fully understand why shit is broken.  And the CSM doesn’t really seem to be helping.
---
PM me, I can recommend some worthy organizations to give your stuff to.
---
If I recall, there was something with drifter lore and Caroline’s star, but a player destroyed it/was destroyed with the item or whatever, so that secret was lost to space. (Not familiar with the story/lore, but should be something along this line).
---
Everybody knew about it.  Most of us fought over director moons often enough.
---
BB Boys running out of targets? Every truth is masked as a form of ironic joke.  JonnyUK farms drone regions rats since few days...
---
There was a shake up, yes, but the same classes of moons that were regional (r8s, r32s) are still regional.  The shakeup may have changed which regions were particularly moon-rich, but it did not change the regionality of them (i.e., Deklein may have gained or lost some number of R32s in the shuffle, but its R32s were still biased towards Technetium, as they were before).
---
 yeah, but I think it isn't anywhere serious enough of a gimp to be worried about it being a gimp. more of a nerf, and I totally think nerfing f2players is a good thing. (pay to be competitive = good depending on the cost, pay2win = bad no matter the cost)
---
It used to be 10b average but I know excavators indirect nerf reduced the value. But 1.2b rigs, excavators sets, pith c invuln and Concord shield boosters, x types shield boost amplifiers... Gets expensive quick
---
Simple solution. Regional saturation leads to diminishing yeilds over time for all forms of PVE, just as we currently see with the PI.
---
Rat too much? Every 100k NPCs killed increases the sec status of a system by 0.01, reducing the security band until you are barely seeing any havens spawn.
---
Mine too much? Every time a colossal's worth of ore is mined in a system in under 3 days, the total yield of the next round of anoms decreases by 1%.
---
Recovery would be the exact opposite, and not exceeding these threshholds would lead to similar recovery rates. Large blocs are either forced to spread out far beyond what a single umbrella can cover, or go semi-nomadic, either conquering new space or enforcing a "crop rotation" style in keeping the PVE and umbrellas mobile.
---
This + put the reason as player harassment, and CCP is the culprit.
---
Why the hell is this getting downvoted?!?
---
There's nothing wrong with hubs, per se. But forcing mission runners to move would spread out the content over a larger area in HS. 
---
And I don't think the idea would be to move the agents, just have them run out of stuff to do after a while, and then you having to wait a bit and use another one. 
---
Again this is just spiballing.
---
I just realized that I can close that local window 10% of my screen can now be devoted to something else, perhaps regional markets.. nice
---
Tribute was nothing like WWB. WWB was everyone teaming up on goons to evict them. Tribute was 2/3rds of EVE essentially blue to each other attacking the north out of spite and boredom. I fail to see the similarity.
---
I think the big group winning vs small group losing is only temporary. If the blackout sticks around, those smaller groups will learn and adjust and be able to flourish like we've never seen before. 
---
If you're a smaller group, start exploring some uninhabited parts of null. I think you'll find that it's easier to hide and live out there than you think. Maybe start with NPC space or places like Stain where you Asta isn't going to have 900 Nightmares shooting it.
---
Its not hard to move ships. There is a freighter meant for doing just that.
---
I mean, as long as they don't send random D pics.. that's ok?
---
....take my upvote and get outta here
---
Yeah it was like 6+ years ago I’m pretty sure. 
---
Did ccp ever have a statement about it or the importance of it to lore progression? I remember there was substantial debate on that event being what was able to bring wh lore further. Last time I was playing ccp had said that the wormhole lore wouldn’t progress until players figured certain things out.
---
&gt; I am just a regular capsular grinding out enough isk for my main combat character to go fight
---
its pretty fascinating how people say this shit when trying to be relatable, always oh but I need to grind isk to pvp, of course its for pvp. And while that happens lowsec, with vastly lower isk making opportunities except from a couple specific things that take a lot of setup(and most dont do btw) has been flying and losing deadspace/faction blinged shit and hg pods for years.
---
its not a bad thing to play the game to make isk, if that's how you have fun then embrace it, just don't delude yourself with this "oh if i can't mine without local how will I ever afford to do pvp, my real goal".
---
ps:and no, im not saying you should necessarily fly blinged pods in ns
---
Totally not exploitable
---
Only a Sith thinks in absolutes...
---
I agree with that. Fleet hangar contracting should be a thing: set a price for ores you need and buy it on site.
---
not if you only count their basic 5mill skillpoint pool, but on the extended 20mill sp, they can use interceptors and assault frigs afaik.
---
Mobile links on desktop platforms are almost as much cancer as posting like this.
---
My zoom isn’t that good anyway
---
Replace I found Eve with Eva and that is my story too
---
Correct Hilen Tukoss was killed in 2011
---
I get it what you’re saying goons and their 1,000 titans are insurmountable (and maybe that’s right) but has anyone tried?
---
So bombers bar and Volta and inner Hell didn’t get kills before?
---
&gt;At least I can't see any of his 150 characters in local.
---
😁
---
This event was 2011 when a fleet of six npc Helios entered J106934. It was Hilen Tukoss that was killed. Looks like ccp forced the storyline to progress by having his body found.
---
Cool, more chores to tread water, a+ gameplay.
---
Eve has needed some sort of active mining mechanic for years. I sadly don't see anything changing.
---
I get that. I just do not see any benefit. I know it was not your idea. But lets follow the argument.
---
The thought behind anoms running out over time is to force them to spread out to weaken the umbrella. And maybe create a resource that will be fought over and creates conflict. Even internal conflict so it is no longer the best move to blob up. 
---
While spreading missionrunners out had the benefit of?
---
Oh really? Wig!
---
Same for local ... oh wait
---
We need a play that allows as to fight that without 2000 titans. It would be painful but a titan should not be a ship that you need 1000 of
---
&gt; Why not just make it so only allies within a war can assist oneanother (as they should because they are part of the war now). 
---
Well in my example B and D are allies in the same war. 
---
If you mean that you should be only allowed to rep someone who's your ally while they are fighting someone within the same war, then that opens a huge new can of worms, not to mention that the crimewatch system doesn't know anything about who's interacting with who, all it knows is your status and the status of the person you are targeting. 
---
Looking into options of merging wars, or allowing someone to be ally in all wars may be more possible, but that's also not a trivial task. We're monitoring how things develop and we may do something like this in the future if we feel like its needed.
---
One of us, one of us, one of us.
---
"gitgudscrub", says the one whinging about the game getting a bit harder for him.
---
will we have to pick up our ship's shit too
---
Nice.

&gt; Nearly two and a half years later, in July YC113, her abandoned Helios, along with those of her companions, was discovered in a system designated J105934. An enterprising capsuleer attempted to salvage them, but found a hostile corporation making use of the system, and destroyed them instead. Inside one was a single piece of Trinary Data, which was destroyed along with the ship. The capsuleer was contacted by Hilen Tukoss shortly after, who made several vague inquiries about the ship

Your questions would be better suited for our Weekly No Question is too stupid thread [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ces8dr/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_july_18/)

No notable ones that have left spring to mind?

INIT has always struggled with shit in our US TZ, being an EU alliance primarily,  but its slowly getting better.

Out of interest, is she against video games or something, why did you feel the need to play it in secret. Or is she a you'll only play wow and only with men kinda girl?
---
My wife knows i have strongly bonds with the people i play eve with, playing with some of them since 2004. They are like a family to me and she knows that. She's fine with it also and happy i have tho seal kind bonds with people since irl i don't much at all.
---
It’s juxtaposition.  Comprehension clearly isn’t your thing
---
adapt or die has a strange duality to it. on one hand you have the current hot balance issue that you should adapt to (most just die and complain). then on the other hand you have ccp radically rebalancing the game every few years. theres something new to adapt to or complain about.
---
Next up: CCP adds mass per minute limit to gates.
---
"Hold in there saber, the fleet can start jumping in... one by one... in a few minutes..."
---
Bombers Bar is just another flavour of F1 monkey. Change my mind.
---
I agree on some, but taking a losing fight before it even started is dumb, there is no such thing s a FAIR fight.  lol and based on  you're comment you are a null bear that gets ganked all the time lol
---
You must have *loved* the drifter invasion!
---
Not if it's designed properly.
---
There's a reason I name my carriers after my dogs.
---
How did she not hear you talking on comms?
---
But did the players allow them to get these 1,000 titans?  Or did goons exploit a mechanic that wasn’t available to others?  
---
Or... Did the rest of eve largely never go there to disrupt them?  Despite month after month of obvious economic “winning”?  All of the evidence was right. There.  Anyone could have used that as a narrative long ago.  But no one did  a damn thing.  
---
What makes me believe it would have gone any differently?
---
&gt;Well I don't have green eyes
---
Lmao. This was gold.
---
oh wow i found the killmail: https://zkillboard.com/kill/19187359/
---
itt: idiots getting baited
---
I agree 100% but you could argue that just like any game once one side gains a slight advantage and the mechanics of the game don’t allow for a back door the flywheel can never stop spinning faster. What if a change was made that made it so that a group of 10 frigates could kill a capital? Think the Death Star. Weakness points that only small ships could target and took parts of the capital offline.
---
The cloaked Loki on the abyssal trace wants to have a word with you ...
---
You know it's just an exaggerated story right?
---
How is this cringy?
---
Better get on it before they Nyx the idea
---
But is it not possible to make a given war have an ID, and then just make it an eliminating factor (like now), that if you are not within war XXXX You cannot assist. By doing that you would eliminate the problem in your example, while still allowing for remote assistance between allies (within the war and between the allies).
---
For number 2 (3): it's taken them this long to have a mainfleet HAC doctrine for something other than 3rd partying. Give them 3 millimeters of credit.
---
Can confidently say NSH is having a fucking field day during the blackout. Small PVP entities aren't suffering, only buffer krab alliances that pretend they're independent.
---
Dropping even one capital should be a very risky thing and should require the correct fleet support. The whole capital umbrella mechanic is terribly boring and broken
---
No because wormholes don't have cynos, static gates, aggression timers on the hole, the list goes on and on...
---
You aren't necessarily wrong that the T3 destroyers are really strong, but would nerfing the roamers make people less likely to rat in capital ships? If people are able to get away with ratting in caps, I don't know that they would step down to smaller ships just because it became slightly harder for those smaller ships to be killed due to  the profit difference. If they currently aren't dying in larger more profitable ships, why change? If the anoms depleted and forced ratters to move around more then I could see a smaller and more mobile ship being something to consider, but if someone is going to sit under their umbrella and rat with relative safety I'd imagine they'd want to use the ships that get them the most ISK.
---
I'm not saying that t3ds aren't too powerful, I'm just not sure that nerfing them would have much of an impact on capital ratting.
---
Ok way to avoid the “not providing stats” part lol
---
Yeah at some point he got so preoccupied with whether they could do it no one stopped to ask whether they should do it.

CCP would rather have you start another account then train another toon. More people logged in means more activity and fun for everyone involved
---
I mean for the rest of your claims, literally brain dead
---
goons best in mining and shooting structures, why they didnt shoot their own citadels?
---
Who clicks on modules? Entirely hotkey reliant baby.
---
It can be if that's what you want out of it. There's a lot of moving parts though. You need scanners, hunters, fuel trucks, a blood ship, recons, and of course your damage. Many of these individual jobs aren't too terribly difficult but they do need good knowledge.  
---
Even if you're just a bomber, it's not really true because you have to coordinate closely with your team to land damage bombs, and be technically somewhat competent to land said bombs. You're also expected to be able to land focus void bombs which need a very high degree of accuracy, since it's a dumb bomb that you pretty much need to land inside the model of your target.
---
Thank you for doing this, for a "game" that has been around so long. We have lost so many over the years but they live on in the game in their deeds and the things they have done. Thank you again for making this happen.
---
That’s the article title image. It is a clickable link down below in the list of tables.
---
The States tab in overview settings is what you want
---
Don’t disagree here.  I feel like there’s things ccp could try that would at least attempt to level a playing field.  What they’ve done thus far has only made it worse.  And I’m not convinced yet that players won’t circumvent mechanics.
---
And it didn’t drop :(
---
Maybe where and when you come from everyone knew about it, but in my time it was an exclusive club of guys who even had the access to set up their own towers. And there was no sharing anything beyond your Corp or alliance dues and fuel. And it generated awesome fights!!!
---
&gt;Te lack of asset safety is next bad thing for me.
---
&gt;Get a life, wife, kids, job - then try to say "i am fine with losing everything" because my kid got sick and i had other stuff on my mind than a game. 
---
Exactly, and that why you live in null. That is perfect for you without all that risk etc.
---
No what I think separates them is games like EvE, GW2, and WoW have a persistent world that changes with time. Now a MMO does not need to have large maps with 100+ people in them; but it needs to have servers where thousands of people play on and can interact with each other in some way. I consider Destiny 2 a MMO as stated above, while it has a "lobby" you still have a server that you can play with anyone on, and a persistent world that evolves over time.
---
100% so by local chat being removed now dropping 100 titans is not effective?  
---
Or something I’m missing?
---
Removal of local is punitive if you don’t have gamebreaking amounts of titans.  To goons it’s a non event.  
---
Net net - loss for the game.
---
If you still out number "literally all of eve" by 2x (400 vs 200) what does that say\~
---
Yikes
---
Capital escalations. Mandatory scramming by hostiles.
---
Eve is a pvp focused strategy game.
---
Lol what, how is a bear hole a loot pinata, you just log out the blue loot in a blockade runner, the snake pilots in your snakes and then there's just rolling ships in the astra

I stopped playing years ago, good to know. Ty
---
Calling Unspoken a "PvE-Alliance" is pretty stretched ...
---
I wonder if this is a long term feature change to help with tidi?
---
To answer this question for you, there are NONE except Providence.
---
All other Nullsec-PVE-Groups are either aligned with Imperial Guardians of the Legacy, or PanFraternitydot. There are some very small Islands of seemingly independant groups in Etherium Reach (Unspoken &amp; Friends) and Pure Blind (FXR / Banderlogs etc.) But thats it, also Unspoken and Friends can not be called PvE-Alliance, that would be rude ...
---
I don't recall reading anything saying PvE alliance
---
It's not for me, if I wanted to rat I would have two options:
---
a) use a subcap I can afford. Have it blaped prettty instantly by someone of my SP level (under 4m) almost instantly in a frigate. I know this because I kill ratting subcaps in my frigate.
---
b) Spend RL money for plex (to the tune of hundreds of dollars) to buy injectors and a carrier, to rat. And join a block.
---
I SHOULD have the option to rat in a subcap, with a small defense fleet backing me up.
---
My solution is hard to code perhaps but pretty simple in concept. If a new target comes in and attacks the ratter the rats switch agression either off, or to the new ship.
---
That made me think of a new challenge, fit dual webs to a corvette instead and see how many VNIs I could kill (get killed). I'm pretty sure its possible.
---
a storm of Geekstinkbreath… and she stayed with you? Did you try to get her into a referall alt?
---
They should of cropped it or something, it is misleading.
---
I'm with everyone else who thinks this is a bad idea. Especially for someone who assembles ships for doctrines, or for people that have a HUGE number of ships for PVP so that they can just Reeeeeeship after they die.
---
Reeeeeeeeeee!
---
I would argue even if you have a small number of ships, what purpose does this serve?
---
If you're looking for and ISK sink there are probably better options.
---
I'm not sure I'm explaining myself well:  
---
&gt;But is it not possible to make a given war have an ID, and then just make it an eliminating factor (like now), that if you are not within war XXXX You cannot assist. 
---
So, taking from my example: 
---
1. Pilot in Corp D goes to rep pilot in Corp B.
---
2. Game checks "are these guys in the same war?"
---
3. Yes, they are, so you can rep.
---
The problem is that B is currently fighting with a 3rd party, A, who has nothing to do with the above check, as the crime system doesnt know anything about him.
---
Does that make sense?
---
Taking a losing fight before it starts is dumb huh interesting stance. 
---
So highest level of risk averse considering there's even buddies with you
---
Oh the irony
---
I don't think it takes "balls" to cloaky camp, no.  There may be some autism involved however.
---
As crazy as this sound, it actually would make a lot of sense. Add dynamic NPC pirate (and sure non pirate why not) which would move around and you might get somewhere. After all, it would make sense that they look into new space after getting slaughtered in millions for years.
---
Wow it's like you couldn't have fun before when there was more people playing, amazing
---
Pretty much.
---
In all honesty, I don't feel like I have a job. 
---
I just do something awesome that I enjoy and happen to get paid for.
---
I'll have you know, I'm all natural.
---
Did you know that blocking test in local improves performance?
---
That is definitely something missing in low sec now, yes.  In null though, well, nothing of value was lost.
---
you are looking at it too closely.  WWB was a "OMFG-something-big-is-happening-in-EvE-and-I-want-back-in/I-want-to-join-such-a-massive-game" moment.  People joined their old corps to fight Goons.  People subbed in order to rejoin goons.  People rejoined in order to mine or indy or 3rd party.  People read in gaming magazines about the not-to-ever-be-seen-or-heard-of-in-any-other-game wars that video gamers were engaged in.
---
It was a huge moment for EvE recruiting.  Talk of "assaulting the north" and how impossible it would be for any one entity had been going on from when I joined EvE and "grrr goons, hat goons" was the meme.
---
A lot had been waiting for another such moment.  First came the realization that with current mechanics invading Delve would never happen.  And now came the realization that NO ONE was going to have a big war anymore.  They have their umbrellas.  You can fit all the ratting and mining you want under the umbrella.  They move out of them every once in a while because they fancy a stroll, but no one NEEDS to leave them so why :effort:?
---
&gt;The VNI has an excellent combination of dps, mobility, ease of use, and price making it the obvious choice for anomaly running. For the same reasons, the VNI has also become one of the most commonly used ships among those who break the rules by engaging in botting.
---
no you drooling idiots, it has nothing to do with that.
---
it's because drones auto agress. that's why everyone's switching to domis and myrms - because they're drone boats not because of any other factor.
---
the ship isn't the fucking problem, it's the weapon platform.
---
It makes sense, but it just means that the crime watch clearly needs a serious look over, as the current mechanic means allies are effectively useless.
---
This means in my specific case that when we want to fight Phorde / test / goons, as a smaller entity we can't cause our allies effectively are of no use since neither group can assist one another.
---
No this is why i keep my assets in NPC null stations.
---
Holy shit you got on a super km? You must be the new El'Tar please teach me.
---
As someone living multiple stints of overall 4-5 years in NPC-Nullsec with a Corp of about 20 real people I can tell that it would not have needed local for me to undock. Also if you fly DEDs in Lowsec-Systems with 20 people in local, the local channel is the last source you take for intel. The D-Scan button and the scout on the ingate were always necessary. So for people like me not much changed in PvE, but at least now I can do stuff we stopped doing years ago again ... Roaming ... as it is fun again, I have this feeling back when I was a n00b 13 years ago and every undock seemed risky and uncertain to me. This exactly is what makes this game special versus other MMO.
---
Inititative takes initiative in flighting a fleet 1/4 of their size. Name checks out.
---
if ccp doesnt actually know this they're bad
---
Auto-pilot is tempting fate. Especially in a squishy ship.
---
It's not even that. Drones will still be preferred to other systems because of one thing: application. With 1 or 2 tracking mods drones apply very well to npc frigates. Turrets on the other hand do not. And non laser turrets cost ammo which is another expenditure eating into your ratting profit. 
---
Even without auto agress drones will still be the best weapon system for ratting just for those reasons alone.
---
How bout a Frigate that can fit expanded probe launcher for combat probing, covert cyno and regular cyno, can fit covert ops cloaking device , scram and point be close to instawarp and have no target delay after uncloaking
---
Eh debatable. Supers are still about do you can hide underneath them. Plus the bonus of if you’re only ratting for 2-3 hours you’ll barely show up on Dothan before you’re finished. Plus split them up into different systems and you’ll be good.
---
You absolutely can, I am a casual EvE player. You might not be able to be a space rich industrial mogul drowning in isk, a universe-famous pvp god, or the leader of a powerful player-driven alliance without playing religiously but just because those things are what the game is famous for doesn't mean those are the only way to play. It's a complete sandbox, it's what you make of it. If you want to play casually, set casual goals.
---
One thing you *do* have to have in EvE is friends, the game is a slog going it alone and that's why I quit the first two times I played, but the third time I found a group of people to run with and I'm still here. Finding a corp that does the same thing, has the same goals, or plays the same way as you is an absolute must. And if you're looking for a casual corp to join, here's a shameless plug for the one I'm in, Weave. We're a loose corp that focuses on casual play, nothing required. If there's a corp event going on it's cuz that's what the people online wanted to do today.

You can get 2000 people in pretty easily whithout horrid tidi.  I was with some of the first on-grid in UALX in a HAC fleet.  With 2000 in local we didn't have more than 10% tidi.  The problems started when all the fighters came out.
---
if they do, then they're being willfully ignorant - which is also bad.

Because my wife would join my corp and then awox me for funzies.

What killmail is itching you? The Titan of Sort or Conman or some random Supercarriers ? I can offer PL-Titan Kill too if needed ...

Or the 1st Super-Killmail from 2010 (ok that was FC catch back then on drunken roam)
---
I keep asking this and get no first hand information. Post fighter application nerf this spring, have you personally tried to apply damage to subcaps(NOT RATS)? How have the changes made effected it. Did webbing the subcap help?
---
And both of you think you are good or smart? LOL bots need auto agression on their drones right?
---
bug vs feature
---
That would be a good combat use for the hacking module.

All I can think about right now being in nullsec. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvUMjoiuFHo

*WAFFLES #1 &lt;3* bwahahahahah
---
Hey mate, I think you might be misconstruing the intentions of these changes, which are not designed as a direct nerf to AFK anom running. 
---
From the blog:
---
&gt;The goals for these Vexor Navy Issue changes are:  
---
&gt;\- Present players with a more interesting and diverse set of competitive choices when they decide which ship to use for nullsec anomaly running  
---
&gt;\- Ensure that the VNI’s new focus represents an exciting and desirable option for players  
---
&gt;\- Ensure that the VNI’s new attributes and bonuses reflect the wider theme present in Gallente Federation ships and Navy Faction ships
---
The problem being addressed this is that the VNI is so good at its specific role that its is perceived to be pretty much the only viable choice for said activity.
---
This man isnt wrong
---
I think drones as a whole need an overall balance pass.  
---
Lights are in a sort-of decent spot, but their AI is just really derpy at times.
---
Mediums are a waste of space unless you are a Gila.  Literally less applied dps to any target than heavy drones.  
---
Heavies are overtuned and need their tracking cut down to the point where they can´t just one-shot untackled ab frigates. They are a battleship-grade weapon system after all and as such should serve to engage hard tackled cruisers and upwards.  
---
Might just be my opinion though.
---
My dick is rather erebus
---
Sure link killmails, I'm just saying I don't see what's impressive about getting on being on a killmail unless you were FC or scout. If not then you just showed up and pressed f1.
---
roaming for stuff other than ganks has died off, i've written many a post now explaining this and won't bore you with the details lmao. I get it shakes things up but not for the good mate from one pvp dude to another.
---
Now Eve's becoming a really scary please https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSwNncwIggI
---
Yeah but Tribute was not even close to being a similar moment. And that was clear from the start. Everybody involved knew it was never going to be that way. Last years war was close to it, since the north hadn't fully grasped the economic and military implications of that fuckhuge mining graph (or had simply underestimated it), and committed it's assets. Tribute wasn't even a war. It was a surrender, and the entire "conflict" was it's terms being enforced. We have now consolidated into TKE, and it can be said that the large scale conflict of old is completely dead. Frat./Test war isn't gonna move much anymore, since Frats batphone is ready again, and an invasion into the drone regions has historically proven to be a lot less fun than undergoing weeks of CIA "extended interrogation" techniques. If goons don't break up soon, or WWB2 : Electric Boogaloo happens, EVE is dead. And WWB2 is shaping up to be a draw with the current strategic situation.

well looks like tactics and acceptable loss or even war stratagem don't count in eve eh? so take a fight when your flee has 70 and enemy got  250....good idea? well, hope you are not playing eve anymore coz man you suck at basic tactics and common sense.

Please make phantasm good as afk pve boat.

Thx

Anyway, I'm looking forward to hunting slow ass myrms and domis

Could you share the 125 bandwidth capped, max 5 drones, that do a thousand damage per second with the rest of the class? I have yet to see these. A 200 dps drone? What has the game come to?
---
" This becoming NEAR3 "  
---
You didnt see gate streams coming when they announced blackout in null?  
---
There has been streams for staging systems for long time and for some reason you didnt think someone would deploy characters to gates to be eyes?
---
Flair checks out.
---
Dumb question, how exactly do I join/find these corps?  If I ask in recruitment all people tell me is good luck finding a corp like that, and how would I join brave or something?
---
I'm having a hard time understanding why you would fly a zealot over an omen navy, can anyone enlighten me?
---
You'd think a frigate like that would have an amazing 2.49k EHP and explode the second anything looks at it. It would also lead me to believe that you have never been blopsing in your entire life.
---
Have csm ever helped?
---
Wew, so much nonsense, and you where CSM with that lack of knowledge?
---
How can you identify Reds and Blues on Dscan? Is there some supa secret CSM-Hack?
---
And second, would you mind to explain why in the regions of Imperium Renters in Perid Basis or new chinese GotG-Members Ratting literally dropped to zero from some of the heaviest farmed systems in all New Eden? 
---
Ah I know, because they all are human players that are just scared now. If they were Bots they would have continued usig dscan ...
---
I am puzzled If you think we are so dumb to believe this or if you are so dumb to believe what you wrote yourself ...

TBH the closest we got to WWB was the 2018 Summer war. since almost everyone was involve. Goons, GOTG, Panfam &amp; BL in the north, Legacy, XIX, snuff, WinterCo, and PL in the south.
---
I'm selling one of my characters and it has a quite a few skins that I earned in events, and others I've bought. Is there any way of me keeping those skins when I transfer my character to the new owner? I don't want to lose them. Thanks in advance.
---
&gt; it's because drones auto agress.
---
cant ECM or damp out a drone boat

Yes, It's hard for me to understand whinging.
---
The Combat Recon joins in ...
---
Time to get her into the game. A family that games together stays together :3

Says worm is too expensive then links a type fit retribution... i blitzed through t2 abyssals in a t2 fit worm costs like 100m total and i had low skills not even t2 drones.
---
Keep posting ♥️
---
3 words in and I stopped reading.
---
They nerfed ECM remember? Won't stop her from targeting him.
---
You've plowed my field a few times... phrasing... heh.
---
But yeah, I unsubbed all my rorq alts and pve alts until blackout goes away, sorry. 
---
Stain guy had a point, i went from 20 or 30 some active subs to 6 pvp toons. This hurts ccps bottom line and available nonconsensual pvp content if that trend continues. Don't get me wrong, this finally killed the bot menace (mostly), but it also straight up killed pve for some actual people as well.
---
To be honest, i doubt i will play eve now, let alone, pvp outside of pings when content is guarenteed. Pve was gaming on my own schedule, and pvp content came to me with manageable risk. Sure i can super rat now, but i do that on one of my pvp characters, and that gets old and boring.
---
Dominion seems like an odd place to point to as the inflection point?  Most people point to Citadel and Lifeblood as the ones that set us on this road.
---
Right I see a titan as a ship that can bridge a fleet or jump into a fleet to do a support function (think boosting) and possibly as a mid battle resupply ship. This would be similar to how space is portrayed in battlestar galactia the ark was just a means to get the fighters on grid. A titan could maybe be loaded like a station and would be a place to dock and reship if poded. Titan pilot would be in charge of targeting and sending out pod shields and grabbing pods with a tether to bring them in. Something creative....
---
Ooof.
---
Good solid set of changes, the Vexor Navy Issue wasn't just the best ship for AFK anomaly farming, it was just \*the\* best cruiser in the game for anomaly farming. Even Bling fit HACs can't clear as fast or are on par with the VNI. It's going to be a monster now for solo/small gang PVP and it'll probably be picked up a lot more by people who want to run Abyssal sites or DED content.
---
OMG, so few knowledge. The "warpout when hostile on grid" is just a fallback mechanism of these bots, that literally displays broken behaviour because of missing local ... and no I wont explain such trivial stuff to you, I have the feeling this would be wasted time ..../o\
---
Ive made you use your own logic to see that pvp is far more risk averse than pve ers are. Gangs running away from other gangs because a few less numbers instead of fighting outgunned and using tactics to even the odds. These are the elite pvp everyone memes about all the time.
---
But the nullbear is so risk averse for getting his single pve fit ship safe instead of taking a fight with a gang of ships fit for ganking ships they catch alone.
---
Starting to see the irony? Maybe you need a lot more time before it sets in.
---
Notice I havent commented about your specific level of skill ability or competence in the game, or how long you've been playing, or that you suck at x or y? Because I don't need to. You shine brighter than the sun.
---
I know this, but it flies directly in the face of what he claims.
---
I don't autopilot in highsec unless I'm in my empty pod and I don't care if I get podded because I'll just end up where I'm going faster.  In all other circumstances I manually pilot.
---
holy shit man how did you keep it secret for a year? my wife is constantly taking my headphones off to ask me what im doing in game at 2am
---
I live in Null since years, and of course i use Near2. Does that answer your question ? Of course it relies on your intel channels, oder course sometimes something slips through, nur seldomly for like 3 Systems. Its incredible powerful for semi-afk ratting, And for ratting in general without reading intel
---
I did that drunk and fucked up everything.
---
It's true that bots can do module inputs too and therefore the extra clicks/button pushes doesn't actually effect their ability to automate content.   
---
I do think that forcing them to use more inputs does make them easier to detect though. The trouble with the current VNI is you can run havens back to back while only using 6 inputs every 40 minutes or so, this makes it pretty hard to detect botters vs actual players.
---
Npc null is a nullsec space that is not claimable by players. It means you dont have the respawning anomalies from sov null, systems are not cynojammed and sometimes you find npc stations and npc mining ops.
---
All this leads to less huge groups and more politically fragmented space. You never see concentrated population like in sov space but more sparce habitations.
---
You can relatively easily live in npc null stations and stage from there. Id personally advise syndicate as logistics are possible from orvolle highsec but wildlands are also relatively doable.
---
For roams population is scarce so youll probs need to set up traps or baits to get reliable content. This said ive left npc null just before blackout so idk now.
---
I dont think anyone would complain about doing that
---
I know what the name states, but I also know what the leader said. Just pointing out his lies.
---
dude lebowski, you've been playing and devving this game long enough to know that human nature will bring people to the path of least resistance; ergo, as much as it pains me to say, but dave stark is not too far off. People are just going to switch to cheapo Myrmidons or bulky Dominixes to get their AFK grind on. Removing drone auto aggression alongside this VNI make-over would do a lot more to curb afk anom grinding and have people try turret/missile ships and not be (too) afk.
---
On the other hand, the VNI change does (and probably will) make me want to go roam around in a nano VNI, and they are in line with the gallente faction ship bonuses.
---
No, just the approx. 3k accounts that did not login and are now missing on the NPC-Kills in Period Basis, Omist, Branch ... etc.
---
Extract all VNI alts now. 
---
Can I get free extractors?
---
No u
---
Hmm, actually long term sec status changes to space would be very interesting.
---
With the blackout, Miner IIs are the drone to use. Miner IIs make all of this Rorqual REEEE! moot.  There is a way to have a mining fleet that is pretty secure (not safe), and not full of capitals. Some people are doing it right and having fun.
---
If I’m understanding correctly, auto aggression is in fact exactly what they mean by ease of use. The difference between the VNI and a Myrm or Domi (according to CCP anyway) is in one other key word they listed: mobility. Not just to sig tank, but to align and gtfo off grid when a gank shows up. 
---
That’s pretty important for a lot of hunters as it makes catching bots... sorry, I mean, engaged and active players... easier. And thus makes space a little more dangerous.
---
Ya I am not saying I know the exact mechanic but I think it’s time to try some new things.
---
Wow, 11 people don't like that I live in Keberz.
---
wait a second.. trinary data? triangle bois backstory?
---
Shut up
---
Maybe so, but now no one is going to undock at all  unless they are in a blob so you still are not going to get those juicy dunks unless you can mass on them. Either way, that isn't more fun.
---
Looks like a good partner ship for a hull tanked blaster BNI to me...
---
The most fun on roaming is not the here and there PvE Gank but meeting other Roaming Gangs again. I know that Krabs today will all dock, and not like it was once that they form a manageable Homedef to get your bubbles of their undock and not either dock or turboblob you like today.
---
Shit, I'm in test and don't log in to pve anymore.
---
Now the drapes match the shades! AYYEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Why does everyone ignore online number loss by saying it's only bots? You have no way to know this and only sells a narrative.
---
I'd say she's typically been against them.
---
When we were first dating I was gaming a lot and then life happened. Career, kids etc. and gaming slowly faded away as I took on more stuff.
---
I was feeling lost in the routine of sleep, work, repeat. I guess I came to the realization that I needed to do something more to actually enjoy life and relieve stress.
---
I'm going to say I was probably overthinking a bit worrying my wife would be upset about me gaming, knowing shes not into it and that's why it took me a while to come up and say it.
---
Uhmm... Interesting!!
---
It will make her a much more wide use boat than it has been so far, looking forward to try one o/
---
Also, it kinda stands out amoung other choices, a bit too much... 
---
I want to try it on one of those besieged covert labs! Let's see If it outshines my Ishtar! lol
---
True, ive been play a shit load of league of legends and galactic empires since blackout.

I'm TZ agnostic at this point.

I was pretty new to Eve when I moved in with my future wife. I offered to quit, but she insisted that I keep playing it I enjoyed it. These are things she said to me over the next month:
---
"What's that ship called?"
---
"Tell me more about the Minmatar."
---
"How do I make a character?"
---
"Let's go be pirates!"
---
And that's the reason I spent those few years in lowsec.
---
Were talking about eve online right?
---
&gt;They would also have fewer spares, so it would be more important to keep their current ones alive, maybe that could be something that the bots would have trouble with.
---
Bots are not the main one who would have trouble with this. Bots can notice instantly when their drones are being targeted. But if we want to make drones more targeted by rats than they are we need some kind of active mechanic to help keep the drones alive. Pulling them and dropping them again doesn't work on rats like it does on players. Rats can keep the drones targeted inside the drone bay and hit them instantly when they come back out.
---
&gt;​Also, remove drone auto aggression, it literally solves all problems with stabbed drone boats being OP.
---
VNI with 2 stabs and a range scripted sebo can still lock out plenty far enough for havens even.
---
the EM plating is pointless. Use an adaptive plating, A type if you have the money, T2 if you don't.
---
People will swap to Myrmidons or Dominixes, but these ships are less advantageous to botters for the following reasons.   
---
* They require higher amounts of SP invested into them so the initial investment is higher
---
* Due to higher mineral costs (4x for Myrm, 12x for Domi), and higher m3 totals for fitted ships, they are harder to produce and move around space, adding a higher logistical cost.
---
* They align slower than VNIs do, they have bigger sigs. the 100mn VNI was almost invulnerable to solo bombers and was really slippery, Myrms/Dominixes have slower warp times too, meaning more chance to catch them, easier time dropping them, easier time doing solo hunter stuff vs them. Bots are more likely to get caught. 
---
* Due to the mechanics of the 100mn VNI, it was very rarely pointed by rats in the site even when they were alive, Myrms/Dominixes cannot out-run the tackle frigs so therefore will be pointed more often, resulting in more of them being caught. (again more bots will die due to hunters coming in while they are tackled)
---
* Gallente BC5 and especially Gallente BS5 are much more niche than Gallente Cruiser 5. 
---
* The Myrmidon actually does less DPS than the VNI unless you use the turrets
---
* The Dominix requires a niche rank 8 skill at level 5 to be able to match VNI AFK DPS. 
---
If anything, it's refreshing to break up the status quo.
---
&gt;If it is enough to impair your safe driving, it is too much.
---
if you have to drive, you do not earn enough for taxi

\&gt; A bit more than that might impair your ability to shitpost effetively, which then would be a "too much". 
---
depends on the person, some get better some worse under influence

\&gt; If, however, you wanted to go out on a drunk Drake roam, there really isn't a "too much".

absofuckingloutely

May.
---
As a small gang guy I agree.  The new VNI sounds like a badass ship that I really want to try out.
---
Agreed, I am excited to try these changes out in PvP.
---
It is only a bug until it is added to the [PRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document).
---
This is assuming the bears are competent.
---
When everyone finds the next easy ratting ship I guess they’ll nerf that too. How about laying off the nerfs and start banning botting accounts instead.
---
I really like how the hotpocket box has blue standings.
---
Look them up directly they all have their own recruitment channels.
---
Brave Newbies Inc.
---
Pandemic Horde Inc.
---
These two have pretty much no requirements at all so they're a come one come all.  They hold nullsec sov space so they're established and they do go on roams and get into fights quite a bit.
---
Brand Newbros
---
KarmaFleet
---
These two have an actual application process interviews full API requirements etc.  They're much more stringent than the first two so you get more security against potential spies coming into the corps and then killing you.
---
For just like a high level overview with Brave Newbies you can expect just single minded fun.  They hold sov so they've had to get a little more grounded as of late but they're still just here to have fun really.
---
Pandemic Horde is so wildly varying in its skill and intensity level. You have Horde Inc.  Basically their feeder Corp to get into blessed beans their verified API gated corp.  Inc. Has literally no requirements send in an app and unless you're on a blacklist you'll get in.  From there you can work your way up the ladder after a few active months you can get into blessed beans and from there with a vouch horde vanguard.
---
Brand newbros is Test alliance, they're more stringent they have a whole application process to go through.  This obviously means more safety against being killed by your own corporates who are spies.  They do have one fleet a month activity requirements which isnt hard to do at all.
---
Karmafleet is goonswarm so it's like playing EVE on easy mode.  They're the biggest alliance in the game with the most defended space and the most active members.  They have the longest recruitment out of any of the listed corps but once you're in you're pretty much set.  Safe space, stocked nullsec market, competent fleets it's really just EVE on easy mode.  Of course you'll be shunned forever once you join but that's the tradeoff really.

This thing is going to be so fucking busted for antitackle with the double tracking bonuses.

No logic needed. Olmeca is a liar, pure and simple.
---
the other roaming gang thing has dried up for me since the no local, and its not like i can chase them around looking for small gang on small gang, because now im wasting time scanning the system to see if theyre still even in there with me.
---
Right, which it was. Thankfully this tub is pretty slow and has cap issues so it won't break the small gang meta like trig shit did
---
At least someone figured it out lol.
---
Huh.. could be a lucrative gig :3
---
&gt; We are currently using T2/T3 destroyers that have more EHP, speed and firepower than those old cruisers.
---
&gt; They are smaller and faster - a power creep that will lead to subcapital ratting dying out
---
You are going to see that power creep no matter what though... Capital/Super creep is already at insane levels. Ratting ships are running low EHP tanks because there is zero reason to add any tank. You can speed tank your way through just about every anom without any real issue. They are so cheap to replace that if you even if you lose one chances are you already made enough to cover cost of replacement. Comparing the ehp of a ratting VNI and that of anything setup for pvp is apples to oranges.
---
oooooooooof seems like someone's suffering from an extreme case of hypernatremia.
---
you know i would not mind a blackout everywere, best time to dust of my d-scan fu
---
Abyssal Deadspace can only be done in T1, T2, or Faction Cruisers or as 3 player Frigates. Destroyers can't do Abyssal Deadspace.
---
He said notable, not notorious.
---
The alternatives can both field an MJD, though. And a surprise scram.
---
Its funny how in each post of the people that want the blackout say the numbers of player that the game is losing are "bots" so they can fell nothing is lost. 
---
Guess what?, the accounts that are unssubing are the normal players no the bots lol. 
---
Te damge that this blackout has made is still in time for revert it, but if this continue those players are going to left the game for good.
---
So far i personaly have seen like 20 ppl soso unsubing (friends,corpmates, alliance mates), and that has happend when im online only, 2-3 hrs per day, and friends in other alliances are telling me the same, that theyr numbers are geting lower, and not all are krabs or minning guys, almost all of them do the PVP that the game offer, but many ppl geting tired or bored now and this been only for almost a week lol, in 1-2 months this game is going to lose some of his player base  forever, and as i see it almost noneone wants to play this game lol, its relly rare to see new ppl starting the game and keep playing it.
---
Again i dunno why ppl belive that this game is full of bots when you can simple buy the plex in the market and buy the ships/modules/etc that you want.
---
Usually, issues start here.
---
Wow. Who is this new ccp? This is actually a good change, not the typical "nerf bat make the ship useless" like in the past.
---
&gt;Like the proposed VNI changes, these alpha clone skillset changes are currently available for testing on the Singularity test server. We encourage all interested players to try out these changes on the test server and pass along your feedback in the forum thread linked at the top of this blog.
---
&gt;Overall we are very excited for the community to try out these Vexor Navy Issue changes on the Singularity test server. The ship is seeded on the market for 100isk in many locations throughout the Singularity server to ensure that all players can easy give it a try for themselves and let us know what you think.
---
&gt;These proposals were developed with help from community suggestions and feedback, including discussion with the CSM. We presented these proposals to the wider EVE community on stage at EVE North in Toronto a few weeks ago, and they are now available for public testing on the Singularity test server so that you can try them out and let us know what you think!

SISI has been in VIP modus since the extended down time.

Again, you two are trying to solve two different fucking issues. How much clearer does it have to be made that AFK farming, bot or otherwise, is not the ISSUE they're trying to solve.

**"The problem being addressed this is that the VNI is so good at its specific role that its is perceived to be pretty much the only viable choice for said activity."**

Oh, I like this. EWar that makes your modules randomly set each other off. Something like scrambling the ships internal computer.

Low effort but, as I still have that Frampton album, here’s your upvote 😊

Except when the extent of your knowledge about the game is spinning afk vni and docking up when a ping goes off.

So why allow faction drones they are far better than  the T2 version mainly having more HP but still deal the same DPS.  I dont get the point of capping T2 drones then..

Your comment is incredibly ignorant of the fact that the VNI was an easy AFK ratting ship, because it was cheap, agile, and had a ton of firepower in the form of a large drone bandwidth with big drone bonuses that would just kill everything without you needing to select targets.
---
My wig is my best friend. It is my life. I must wear it like I wear my life!
---
Ok, yeah, my bad, I forgot to check that :\
---
What I'm wondering, though, is how strong should my hypothetical cruiser be?
---
New guy here, I'm in nullsec in PH and have a big question.
---
How does one find fun. I tried exploration, which ended in 10 hours wasted flying around in null and J space, without getting a single Data or relic site. The most interesting thing that happened was that I got blapped once in a WH when I forgot to cloak after warping to a safe spot. 
---
I also joined roams(also tried solo roaming) or the standing fleet. But every time a fight happens, I got to see a whole second of action before I'm back in a loading screen and waiting to pick up the next second of content for someone else.
---
I want to like eve, but so far it's just been frustrating.

it was nerfed before it was a fast ship with not much tank but a lotta dps now its a vexor thats costs 60mil more

---
I like you brought up the citaspam issues which would force CCPs hand to find a way to balance that as well, like a structure cap in an owner system. I mean gets the idea ball rolling on that which would make defending a keepstar way more crucial.
---
Hey bud, so kinda but not really on all points.
---
* SP yeah, higher SP is required. A whopping two skillbooks and maybe a full day of training. Current VNI runners adjusting to Myrms or Domis is less than a day's worth of training IIRC (In B4 some pedant says its like 1.0001 days). SP hasn't really stopped botters either.

* Botting domis rat at 100km from warpin, with an MJD, with sentries. They don't orbit the site.  This version is found all over Period Basis by the totally legitimate PLA Associates corporation. There's also a brawling version that tanks FHubs just fine and uses heavy drones. Warps in at 0, aligns back to citadel, drops heavies, goes to down. Kills pointing frigs dead just fine, too. Has an MJD fit for o-shit, but definitely more killable with T3Cs. This version was pushed by Sapporo Jones in TEST as a better, cheaper (after insurance) to lose ship with more survivability and ability to shoot back/light a cyno for help if the day is slow.
---
* Myrmis, sure they are cheap throwaways that make their cost back (after insurance) after a site or two. Fun to kill, easy to tank, basically free frags when you catch them.
---
* Myrm and Domi is still immune to solo bombers that have points. Scramming bombers, lol ok they will explode real fast if the domi/myrmi pilots decide to drop small drones.
---
* Gallente BC5 and Gallente BS5 are not required skills, just like Gallente Cruiser 5 was not required. 
---
Like I said, I am glad they are changing the VNI but I would also like to see drone auto-aggression to be gone.
---
I personally think the blackout is pretty nice. There finally is really a dead area of space where you can get away with about anything, and it feels organic, and it is beautiful.
---
They actually warp out faster because they aren't overpropped
---
T2 do more damage after you train the specialization up
---
&gt;The goals for these Vexor Navy Issue changes are:
---
- Present players with a more interesting and diverse set of competitive choices when they decide which ship to use for nullsec anomaly running
---
- Ensure that the VNI’s new focus represents an exciting and desirable option for players 
---
- Ensure that the VNI’s new attributes and bonuses reflect the wider theme present in Gallente Federation ships and Navy Faction ships
---
2 yups, 1 kinda. again, I like this change but i'd also like to see auto-aggression removed as an added bonus.
---
I only have Minmatar Frigate V, I never really bothered to train the other racial frigates, focused primarily on Minmatar + Projectiles. Though I've been changing that as of late, just so many other things I want to train before spending 24 days on a frigate V skills when the bulk of the time I'm flying HACs, Battleships, or my Carrier.
---
Besides, Hound is best bomber fite me.
---
Create a new character if you don't already have another and contract the skins. If you are referring skins already activated, then you are out of luck.
---
If they were just introducing them now then sure. But it's hugely confusing to use a name that already exists and everyone knows what it means for something different.
---
Those fukin triangles are shittalking to us
---
Wow, what a fucking concept!
---
If they get given to Blood Raiders instead then Goons will get a huge freebie from CCP and then crash the price.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Data_centers "Basically, it allows you to convert isk into standing" 
---
i havent tryed them my self but as i read it you buy the tags and hand them in and get standings
---
I've been taking a break and haven't played since February. I just came on this sub on a whim and see all these blackout posts. Did they finally get rid of local?
---
You could also stop being a freeloader and pay for your subscription.
---
Damn INIT is full on bitter ex in this thread lol
---
I think there's some sort of exotic heavy metal in the water that prevents people from understanding basic game mechanics. Asset safety is only partial right now. In k-space. Want loot? Go shoot some ECs or refineries. Get loot. Do it now.
---
Its always fun when you jump a super in and your UI doesn't load :D
---
u/uwutranslator
---
We must go deeper
---
You’re mixing two events - Luanda Burreau was the one whose ship was found and destroyed with trinary data in it (as someone else linked), but Tukoss’s corpse was found next to a Drifter Hive when those systems became accessible in 2015 (I should know, I was in the fleet!)
---
From a (mostly) solo PVP point of view, I think they have created a monster... the already good fitting of the VNI, the fact that it can still use Medium Drones with even better performance than before and the bonus to Hybrids -amongst the other "buffs"- will make the VNI a perfect PVP ship. 
---
I dare to say it will become the new Svipul.
---
lets not introduce more risk because there is already some risk?
---
I do like this idea, but at the same time I want to point something out:
---
When the war between imperium and PanFam was winding down, we did a lot of citadel bashing and PanFam basically never showed because they were evacuating and we faced no resistance so it went by quick. However, all of the kill mails generated generally showed the mods has been stripped from the Citadel. So rather than taking very large losses, they managed to only lose the value of the structures plus whatever stuff players had left behind, which isn’t counted in. So CCP would have to modify citadel coding to make it more risky for the owning Corp or alliance to abandon the structure.
---
I would instantly pull anything but the bare minimum out of citadels.
---
Trinary data has been a Jove-linked thing since the early days of EVE - there’s a lot to suggest the Trigs are in fact a descendent of the Second Jove Empire (the Jove Directorate in their separated regions were the Third Empire)
---
No? Dude. You'll have to grind dozens of keepstars, vs equal titan numbers at best and superior at worst. You can't breach fortress delve anymore. The only way we go down is if mittens says fuck it.
---
No, I like asset safety the way it is, just increase the cost.  It's fine otherwise and makes living in null more viable.
---
Yeah, I think EVE has hit a great balance with Alpha, as one. It's not so restricted that you feel you're forced to pay, but it's still restricted enough that Omega doesn't die. It's in that great spot of, "Yeah, I'm enjoying Alpha, and I may switch to Omega for some more cool stuff in the future."
---
More pointing out that the addition doesn't actually drive the results you want. If people were truly interested in shooting structures for loot, they'd be doing it right now. All these changes would do would be to make a very small number of people feel less emasculated.
---
LOL. You literally can't.
---
Trump hair isn't natural.
---
There is a in game channel called Abyssal Lurkers, they have some very cheep fits there for T1 and T2 filaments. Like Caracals that run around 10 mil.
---
Were you on the comms when he was screaming? Haha
---
not really when it get very slow drones and medium rail barely hit fast targets...
---
A 100 man bomber fleet can stay on grid with caps and kill some dreads and faxes if they siege. And if they don’t siege than the bomber fleet can just stick around as long as it wants
---
You’re not gonna waste an opportunity to hotdrop when there’s bigger shit to shoot. If you hotdrop a bunch of small stuff, you’re on intel now and the big stuff docks because they know you’re around.
---
You have never fought 1v1 against a PVP fitted VNI, right? Or you haven't done any PVP besides pushing F1? Which one is it? Because your comment is as ignorant as it can be.
---
I'd prefer no asset safety personally.
---
And limits on hangar capacity in upwell structures.
---
And no more tethering, only mooring for supercapitals.
---
And supercapitals not being able to dock in structures.
---
And limits on number of supercaps that can moor at a structure.
---
But that's just me...
---
no ive been droped by t2 frigs while ratting
---
Remember how they were bought out for hundreds of millions?  
---
Now they don't have to listen to GoonsCSM.
---
It's funnier when we say it.
---
bad change, it favour one cruiser to much against other faction cruisers...
---
&gt;fuck ~~subcap~~ AFK and risk adverse ratters
---
falcon stop teasing us with visions of an actually good EVE
---
People shoot structures left and right for no other reason than the fact that they are there. Yesterday 10 athanors, 14 raitarus, 11 astrahuses, 1 tatara, 1 fortizar and 3 azbels died. The problem isn't that citadels are not dying, the problem is that they are not worth actually fighting over most of the time
---
Hrmm so you can afk rat but you will just need a bigger drone ship or an Ishtar. Got it. Pushes bitters to be Omega players.
---
You were ratting with a PVP fitted VNI?
---
would be lovely, but my main concern with no asset safety at all is groups like mine roflstomping the little guy trying to make it in nollsov for loots
---
obliviously not
---
afk ratting just change to fof ravens, domis, gilas even some fit myrmidons get pretty nice drone dps. sadly gallente FW get fucked, because VNi was reason why farm gallente FW. now just few pvp player will buy VNis
---
You would just use light drones and blasters
---
this is what stations are for
---
so since you are online again, fake hair and all, why is ccp selling sp?
---
It was nerfed as it's now a worse PvE ship and a better PvP ship.    
---
It was buffed as it's now a better PvP ship and a worse PvE ship.    
---
\*shrugging emoji*
---
I like this hardass version of Falcon.
---
Will never happen Kenny as long as The Imperium is able to kick over the rest of the sandcastles. Too many crybabies in NCPL would lose everything.
---
Then you are missing the point, besides anom ratting the VNI was already a really good PVP ship, and this changes only make it better at it.
---
Less fights than what I wanted but hope you lot enjoy regardless :)
---
are you saying its better at ratting now?
---
There are three different types of faction drones.
---
* 'Integrated': The worst type of faction drones. You can think of them as meta drones. Better than T1 but not much.
---
* Navy faction drones: More tank than T2, less dps than T2.
---
* 'Augmented': These are basically faction T2 drones. They are better than T2 in every way.
---
Or gila's,explains the T2 med drone nerfs
---
And they still won't be "worth actually fighting over" if you make this change, as evidenced by your own observation that structures, which can drop loot **right now, today,** aren't already driving the structure death you claim to lust for.
---
&gt; i went from 20 or 30 some active subs to 6 pvp toons. This hurts ccps bottom line
---
I wouldn't be so sure. Your Rorquals were precious to CCP when you injected them. They are now merely upward pressure on PLEX prices, and factors in proliferation. You weren't paying $ to CCP to keep these accounts subbed, and more accounts subbed via PLEX does not always equal better bottom line.
---
Meanwhile, the frowned-upon "elite PvP'ers" (along with newish players who can't PLEX their accounts), who can't stand/access high-end PvE and pay $ for subs and PLEX, look like the main people carrying this game. And your playstyle took a big shit on theirs last 3 years. 
---
With bots and PvE multiboxers gone the online counts will diminish. If blackout stays permanent (combined with other moves such as nerfing farm available per region and cynoes and buffing isk/h), there will be less targets but a greater percentage of them will die.
---
Wtf I love falcon now
---
 //( , )Y( , )\\
---
It isn't a draw.  It just isn't... anything.
---
If goons want to go somewhere, they will.  If someone wants to take their space, they won't be able to.  If someone want to take a piece of some other alliance's umbrella, well, they are blue.  Or if you do get to a point of shooting each other the cancer that is burning down citadels is the "prize" the of the winner.
---
No one needs the space and no one wants the cancer of burning structures, except once in a while when you tire of building your 3rd titan and of dropping a dozen of them on a roaming squad of 5 caracals.
---
but surely nobody would ever circumvent the limits and they add so much more than just mildly inconveniencing logistics people.
---
Seems like just allowing neutral logi would be the better solution. Let that logi go suspect and use friends thats not in war to kill said logi.
---
Good shit CCP. 👏
---
Trying it out today.
---
Capacitor management LVL V
---
Fortunately, the developers of citadels understood a very basic fact: players will perform acts of drudgery adjacent to self-harm to reduce risk, if the alternative is there. That alternative is NPC stations. These developers had the following bold precept in mind when they developed the feature: players should enjoy the video game, and not have to do bullshit make-work.
---
With all the Panfam/frat/Legacy Titans working together, Imperium isn’t close to having equal numbers. X47 was a close fight and that was with Legacy helping Imperium. Even just removing legacy from the equation makes it doable, with legacy helping the attack Imperium would probably just pull a WWB and retreat. All those keepstars wouldn’t be anything but uncontested structure bashes waiting to happen.
---
Can you just please tell someone that assets safety should activate after X time (a month sounds fair giving current shitty timers) of not loging into the ACCOUNT and that it would solve this problem?
---
If you stop playing EVE you hardly do so one day to the next, you usually linger around for some time, so 1 month would secure the assests of people leaving the game for when decide to come back, while leaving people abusing the mechanic no to defend or evac their shit vulnerable to losing it.
---
Caracal and fit is probably closer to 20m. A T2 fit caracal with good skills can do a T3 - maybe T2 with poor skills.
---
Light drones sure but what decent tackle pilot gets to within blaster distance of a cruiser?
---
You can run a T4 in a 600m Gila easy.
---
Thanks for the tip, I didn't even think to lvl out biology.
---
I'm all for changes that allow a more diverse selection when it comes to ratting but doesn't this just make other drone boats the next option?
---
Blasters fam
---
Hey! WTF?!?! I have biology 5 and I'm not a l33t PVPer!
---
No... leave the Spod mate, not doing anything good to you.
---
Then I know of some rehab centers you might check out. . .
---
High Sec don't mind about local, so it being down it's the same as nothing.
---
Then they’ll lose it and imperium will overextend, they’ll become vulnerable and others will push back. Instead, now, everyone just hunkers down and no one has enough incentive to try to break their walls. If letting one group crush the rest is what it takes to get some conflict, so be it. Haven’t you seen Star Wars? The rebels win in the end.
---
I assume he found many, many instances of "Oh you sweet summer child."  Possibly enough to suggest that the user in question is just a chat bot, with a systemic preference for particular comments when faced with lines of conversation that fall outside the appropriate scope.
---
Or maybe just cat pictures.
---
You are absolutely right about the benefits.. **NS officially is monopolized by large alliances. With help of ccp** 
---
I have only been playing for 2-3 years, but 8+ hours everyday with 5 omegas maybe counts for something. 
---
So here is my take on this....
---
The losers and winners were expected  for everyone after the roll out.
---
This makes achieving hegemony for large coalitions in NS a breeze, I only see shifting of the balance to favor those coalition's interests, you can see a parallel here with real life politics, that only proves, that power poisons most people.
---
Using bot ing as an example just makes  their inability (ccp and friends) to shine.  - I am asking  though; in a game where its ok to scam anyone, anyway you want, why is bot ing an issue? bots are essentially scammers, they never effected economy as much as ccps nerfs and changes and such.
---
Since I have been playing eve there have only been "nerfings " making things weaker one way or an other, sometimes introducing additional modules to counter those "nerfs" .
---
you cant plan industry, since you never know when and what will change in a month. it doesn't effect pvp much, but pve is a big part of the economy. if I give all my toons up and keep 2 for pvp, what will make eve stand out as an all around game that appeals to every type of player?
---
oh well
---
How many people are active online isn't an indicator yet, of the effects of the black out , its way too early to tell. I personally  log in several times a day to check on stuff . my last industry job will end tonight so that will be 5  less  accounts logged in after that . It will be interesting to see the economy report down the road.
---
So I'm just 1 player that cash subbed 5 omegas plus additional character trainings, spent money on their website for isk, dlcs, toon transfers all the goodies.. 
---
I am tired of investing into stuff after a nerf to find out there's another nerf effecting my last few months of set ups that costs 10s of billions
---
**I** **hate to go, eve was my hobby, this post really is just to counter people that subjectively are supporting this change,**
---
***When major changes happen, clear honest communication on intent and reason would go a long way to keep the trust of everyone in the community.***
---
Fuck off, I'm perfectly fine!!!
---
Here comes more Capital nerf .....ffs
---
Data Center and Circle Agents are your friends.
---
Thanks Falcon, and thanks CCP, this is amazing.
---
I’m going to have to open up Eve and investigate what my character is actually capable of piloting. FW fights were almost exclusively cruiser and smaller fights with brief exceptions where you would see two large corps set up a fight over a system. I’m not sure if my character is capable of piloting HAC’s but I think he might be, but it’s comforting to know that I can reach out to one of the larger alliances and get support like that.
---
You got suckered into joining a newbie farm. You can still remain in horde, but move your death clone to some place like [Choonka](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Choonka), which is one jump off from lowsec amarr/minmatar faction warfare space. Check out [Blights Wretch](https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96) and his youtube channel full of videos flying cheap T1/Faction frigates and destroyers. Buy some of them, ship em over from Amarr, and go to town. Check out the ingame channel Bringing Solo Back for some advice, posting killmails, laughing at your own lossmails, and general hanging out with other solo players. Or you can check out the Microgangs channel for some pickup small gang PvP. It's curated by Auraus Porcellin, who's a total knobhead at times (read: most of the time) but let people know you're new/learning and you'll get fleets up the wazoo.
---
Then any time you want some ISK or whatever, jump clone back to Horde nullsec space and go run some green anoms, DED sites, or whatever.
---
&gt; and imperium will overextend
---
There's not really any overextension involved.  Deploy the toys, wipe the slate clean for a bit, come back home, rinse, repeat.
---
You can only make me so hard.  Be careful with the power you wield.
---
Shit, hadn't considered Abyss yet. Finally a good alternative for the Gila!
---
Well i prefer strong NPC nullsec with PVP oriented groups living there again.           
---
And removal of easy LP - aka burners          
---
And no injectors            
---
And single structure per system capable of providing basic needs for all players.         
---
And upper limit on how many accounts player can have.        
---
And no interdiction on interceptors.           
---
But this is just me...
---
Forgetting Abyssals?
---
This is why you use 2 factor auth.
---
I did the real 120 IQ thing and injected Biology V with Day 1 free SP
---
The ishtar is better
---
Caps were introduced for this exact role. Dreads were supposed to bash POS, carriers were meant to cover and remote rep dreads against enemy battleships (they application was too bad to hit smaller stuff), and Titans were rare toys used to nuke the entire grid.
---
I can understand your frustration, but just because everyone decided to get as many of the big toys as possible, it doesn't mean it's good for the game in the long run. Things get buffed and nerfed all the time over the years, it's just that caps carry a heavy investment with them and they are scared their pilots will be royally upset if they do anything drastic with them. CCP shot themselves in the foot here though, because in replacing POS with citadels, they were suddenly left with entire lines of ships that had no role. So they made them too good against subcaps and that's why nobody bothers to get any proper fights in anything smaller.
---
If it was up to me, i'd return caps to siege weapon status and covering other caps, and run a time limited "replace your SP" event/season. Heck, they could simply seed extractors at low prices from NPC vendors and disable the penalties for injecting for a month. Everybody affected would be able to reskill into other things if they didn't want to fly them anymore and the problem would solve itself.
---
talked to a mate about player retention, and from that perspective this is :ok_hand:
---
A WWB type scenario would be a draw, anything else is just an automatic loss for whoever is facing goons. It wouldn't be a fun draw, where both sides have to constantly give all they have to stay relevant, either. It would be the boring kind where both sides can't really maneuver, for fear of getting dropped on. Not that it would matter anyway, as any kind of action is an almost guranteed win for the defenders.
---
That's ingame atleast. Realistically Team not-goons would probably eventually win due to burning out slower. Especially with the blackout. A defender will now have to worry about cloaky t3c camps in literally every system, with a big fuckoff super fleet ready to drop. It isn't that far fetched to assume that most economic activity in delve would cease outside of USTZ, as everybody else combined has much better TZ coverage than the US centric goons.
---
Suffice to say, in case of a WWB2 EVE would bleed players rather heavily.
---
This is great news! Alpha clone drone skills are too powerful for Alpha bot farms.
---
And now there is no more afk I mean, bot, anomaly running. Oh wait, ishtar is still a better garbage subcap to run anoms in. Now it's wayyyyyyy better.
---
Ain’t reddit great?
---
Thank you!
---
It's rather refreshing to see them change the ship, versus just nerf it into uselessness.
---
Idk, if you play Eve you're probably a hardcore masochist who loves doing bullshit work^1
---
^1 Except structure bashing, fuck that
---
We put some SP into a starter pack because we thought it'd help new players with the restriction of buying one per account.
---
We failed to restrict the starter pack to new accounts, and when this was pointed out by the community, we realized we'd screwed up and released a clarification to say that we'd be fixing this. A fix is in the works afaik.
---
Whether you like it or not, the games industry is changing and EVE needs to change with it. That's just the reality of things.
---
The intention isn't to break down the core pillars of what make EVE the game it is, but at the same time if we can ease the path for new players to get into the game and have fun, then we'll look at doing so - even at the risk of rustling the jimmies of some of our existing players along the way.
---
I'll be direct and say that this is of course my own opinion and not the opinion of CCP, but personally I'm getting tired of people freaking out every time we try something that might help with new player retention or give them an easier path to get into the game and stay. 
---
There are of course some valid concerns, and my job is to listen to what people are talking about, but once I'm done listening, it's getting to the point where I just roll my eyes at a lot of the REEEEEE that happens when we talk about changes and the same groups of people start screeching about "pay to win" and "muh sandbox".
---
I'll hold my hands up and say I'm guilty of that myself - I try to do as much as I can to make sure that EVE stays true to its roots, but we've been super direct with our new player retention numbers, with our second logon numbers, our 30 day retention numbers too - we even showed these off at EVE North and a few other events to talk about the unique issues that EVE faces with retaining rookies.
---
If it comes down to a choice between EVE struggling through a lack of fresh blood, or pissing a few people off and seeing some noise on the internet because we've decided to do something different, then prepare your jimmies mate, because imma come a rustlin'.
---
Popping pods is pretty much a reflex and this guy expected people to check his history first?
---
HELL yes!!!!! The dream is coming true bit by bit.
---
&gt; That alternative is NPC stations.
---
Yeah, that's why I'd also stop caps from docking in NPC stations too, and put a cap their hangar capacity as well :)
---
This hurf was in response to Titans getting dropped on us during what otherwise was a really nice brawl against Init/Snuff in Korasen.  That being said the larger null sec alliances on that list didn't form nearly in their full capacity for us (just specific corps/players we keep contact with.)
---
There's no denying the VNI had the corner on its job, but I think the community was hoping to see much stronger actions towards the game-breaking problem of botting than leather-chair ruminations on the philosophical consistency of the Gallente fleet.
---
Not that I dislike the change, 1) it seems so specifically directed at botting (why pick the VNI now?) and 2) I agree with Stark, reluctantly, that auto-aggression is a problem in this game. It lowers the skill floor for PvP players and just screams temptation to AFK players.
---
Yeah in null.
---
You can't just put 'truth be told' after your opinion and expect people to buy it as fact either!

People joined because they were paid.

“Soul”???
---
Everywhere? Even lowsec and highsec?
---
Yeah, my first reaction to assets safety was "fuck that", but after talking to many people about it the common concensus was that if you left EVE for whatever reason and decide to come back after some time, finding you lost everything or a big chunk of your assets while you were away is a good way to make you stay away from the game.
---
You can fit 3 more mining laser upgrade 2s which last I checked applied to gas.
---
I don't wield any power. 
---
If I did, New Eden would be a hellscape of hardcore torture where you had to work to achieve and maintain greatness.
---
I agree.  Regions should become depleted over time.  This requires movement and conflict as hungry mining fleets push blocs to migrate.  This would also reduce the citadel bloat as it becomes expensive to erect and then remove rigged citadels...or sell them at a loss.
---
"Version?" I've never seen the guy take any particular care to pull his punches.
---
Have you ever seen a not risk averse pvper? I haven't, they always try to run for the hills as soon as I start decloaking my alts or they lose the numerical advantage. Want to talk about risk averse? Let's look at these trash roamers who come looking for a fight, find one and then try to run because they are out numbered by one person with multiple accounts. Fuck risk averse elite pvp noob garbages, probably all bot accounts too.
---
Caps docking in NPC stations - yes, everywhere - you want to own them, be prepared to have to build the infrastructure to support them.
---
Capping NPC station hangar capacities - no not everywhere, just in nullsec - if organizations out there want to hold space, they should have to create their own infrastructure from the ground up in order to do so.
---
Like it or not, NPC nullsec is called NPC nullsec for a reason. It doesn't belong to a player alliance, it belongs to the faction that holds sov.
---
Delve Pest control in Esoteria?! That’s bad branding!
---
I mean, as harmless as this secret was. The fact that you felt the need to keep this a secret from  your wife for a year is not a good sign. Did you ask yourself why you felt that it had to be a secret?
---
That first bit's my fault, too -- they spend too much time obsessing over everything I say to get any good bootlicking in.
---
do you already have an official lube supplier, or can we start bidding? gonna be a huge market with the amount of butthurt :D

How about combat timers for killing rats?  Also, please kill tether.
---
Implying the average tackle pilot is good
---
I'm playing World of Warships for my casual content now.  -1 VNI/carrier for the hunters. 
---
I will continue with PVP in Eve...until the whaling targets unsub.
---
If you have already redeemed the skins then no, they are tied to the character.
---
If they are still 'loose' items in your inventory then you can contract them to whatever character you're keeping in the same way as anything else
---
Yes but you cant train specialization on a alpha anyway. So par for par using faction is still better for an alpha, right?
---
Sounds like a good way to forever block off dreadbombs from blood raider space would be to choke their hangar capacity with freighters :p
---
That me make this clear.   It is against the EULA to play the game in snippets.  The EULA however can not touch how I stream the game as it is under the domain of another software licensee.  Now if CCP wants to they can make it so that it is against the EULA to stream, record or reproduce videos of EVE.  But,  I feel that would be the end of EVE if they decided to do it.  Also on a side note it is against an EULA to stream snipe but...... folks still do that and they don’t really care either.  Trolls will be trolls I guess.
---
It isn’t though, t1 resists vs the gila 20% omni extra isnt made up by the local repper attribute unfortunately. Also VNI has to armor tank for high tier abyss due to slot layout, which gimps room for dps.
---
You can prolly run t3 and maybe t4 with a lot of bling, but gila is unfortunately still the one true t5 king for solo cruisers.
---
Would a type of asset safety that worked with a service module and insurance payout work as an isk sink?
---
Item cost + fuel cost + insurance cost. Items still drop, some of the value recouped via isk payment 
---
I know insurance is considered a faucet, but I'm sure it could be tweaked to such a degree that people cant just 'insurance fraud' things in structures to make isk.
---
I'm a pilot who played a ton a long time ago, but haven't logged in since 2012.  
---
I have 150m skillpoints and can't remember dick about the game.
---
I forgot what it was that I was supposed to be doing.  
---
are incursions still a thing? invasions worth doing?
---
Seems like, to me, that such a vignette would drastically increase the value of 0.0 adjacent to lowsec. In addition, it'd render the value of 0.0 not adjacent to lowsec somewhere around the value of dog shit.
---
I suppose if you were trying to compress the map, this would work -- you could give the game a year to consolidate powers even further along the bits of nullsec that can actually support life (next to lowsec,) and then delete the untrafficked regions.
---
Is it cowardly and risk averse? Absolutely. Thankfully, no one who matters actually cleaves to that sort of high-faluting grandstanding bullshit. Advantages are to be seized by one's jaws and shaken mercilessly until candy falls out.
---
Also, I love the idea of m3 limit, no tethering for supers, mooring for supers, number of moored supers per structure and type. 
---
Could tethering be tied to high power or a tethering service module?
---
Bad Falcon! please dont get rid of asset safety or supercaps docking, having to coffin a character in a supercap realllly sucks, sop does losing everything in a home in null if you have to do some RL Afking.  Also wait why do you like mooring for supercaps and not docking?
---
I like the idea of *activating* asset safety. I.E. - It can happen instantly, but all of your stuff is now locked for xyz days before it can be unlocked. So, if you are away from game or something rather than a means to save stuff just in a structure. Maybe if you don't log in for 30 days, everything goes into that for you automatically.
---
You got me there dude
---
Also means botting gets more expensive to run and more lucrative to gank.
---
Wait....
---
Are you calling me a loser?
---
As much as I like your ideas I think this one would make entrenched entities that much more safe without having to worry about dreadbombs from NPC null.
---
Removing chats from local/alliance/corps will definitely kill the game coz for me its a socializing aspect in the game that keeps me there the most, since you take local away how are you supposed to communicate with strangers if you cant see them in local (if I start talking to myself in local then I should see the doctor for sure)
---
Not for alpha clones. For omega accounts it forces them into more expensive ships.
---
I bet we could farm those idiots for plenty of kills.
---
Why not just make the most difficult site with built-in cyno inhibitor?
---
Check out my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdt76i/re_how_popular_is_the_blackout_really/eu2neu4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Not looking for "juicy dunks".
---
Alpha's can't use a MJD.   
---
Surprise scram is fine, it encourages PVP. A real player can scram and get his alliance to help him and get a kill, a bot cannot.
---
Augmented berserkers on a sieged rorq apparently do 850 dps without any drone damage mods.
---
The industrial core comes with a 100% drone damage bonus (and hitpoints), hence the numbers.
---
Why should capital ratting be as risky as subcap ratting?  Does it take the same time to train into them?  Does it take the same money to buy injectors to get into them?  Do the ships cost the same?  Do capitals get to rat under the protection of high sec?  Do they give the same size killmail?  Why should they be the same risk?  I'm not in a capital yet, so tell me why I should continue to train into one.
---
&gt;Can you just please tell someone that assets safety should activate after X time (a month sounds fair giving current shitty timers) of not loging into the ACCOUNT and that it would solve this problem?
---
So basically, have a summer vacation and come back to all assets in stasis, waiting for those 20d before being transported to lowsec.
---
Trick is you gotta stay high all the time to make that payback.
---
I don't know if I like the idea of taking ALL of someone's stuff, because I don't want them to quit... but I'd be pretty happy if half of their stuff hit the RNG loot fairy process and some, part or all of that dropped and the rest + their 50 % was what was left to be asset safety'd.
---
How is that functionally different?  If you're being invaded and don't have an alternative, you activate it and still just save stuff?
---
Am I missing something you're trying to get across?  The only difference seems to be that if you're afk, but less than 30 days afk, you get fucked... which... doesn't really seem better?
---
People put the time and money into training, buying, and setting up an umbrella.  They coordinate and give up game time on that account to form the umbrella.  The umbrella stops you from easy kill, you get mad.  Your neighbor has more of what you want, make a law change so they have to give it to you...
---
The difference between old player and new generations.         
---
Newbies go for the biggest target instead of farming all stuff around.
---
Get fucked
---
That sounds frankly awful to trying to play with caps and I sincerely hope that never happens.  It would also essentially make anyone trying to attack anyone bigger or simply with more capital and null sec assets out in anyway impossible (and I dont mean hard I mean impossible.)
---
I'm not trying to nail down hard details, just general ideas. I am ok with the idea of someone that needs to disappear for 3-6-9 months having their stuff there when they return. I'm not ok with it being used to exploit an invasion.  Maybe make it so that it can't be used if the structure is reffed at all?
---
Only if the station blew up... sorry if I wasn't clear about it, will edit, by "activate" I meant "be avaiable in case the current trigger occurs", not that all your shit goes immediately to assets safety.
---
What joy it is to constantly transport shit back and forth from your "home" to npc storage. /s
---
right.. im stupid. thanks!
---
1b has been quoted often before. Also, if it's all trit - you should be safe!
---
No asset safety means I’ll never come back if I take a break and lose my shit.  My wife gets cancer and I afk.  I’m gone from your game.  Sounds like you don’t care.  
---
How do I then use a super pilot for anything else if I can’t dock it and reship?
---
Limiting hangar space means I’ll just anchor EVEN MORE STRUCTURES....
---
Limiting the number of tether on a structure... EVEN MORE STRUCTURE SPAM...
---
Do you even play the game dude?????
---
Sounds like More structure spam to me dude.  He’s clueless
---
Had a corpie who was calling my Tengu "Pengu". That was 10 years ago. I should check what he's doing now. Thanks for reminding me.
---
Read all those ideas and say - all well do is anchor even more structures
---
How about safefy for personal items, with limit on space (like if you have a super, you won't have space for much else), and so safety for corp assets?
---
Structure spam online holy fuck dude
---
I mean, I'm not really disagreeing in principle, just having a hard time seeing how it could work in practice.
---
Using the recent northern invasion as an example -- they saw the writing on the wall and pulled rigs well before major reffing occurred.  The asset safety button being pressed would seem to me just the next step there, if for some reason you didn't think you could move things out.  The only assets you'd "catch" would be the people who were gone for less than whatever the threshold you set for the auto-activation.
---
I just don't feel like "hey I'm going on vacation for two weeks" should involve hours upon hours of safe-ing up my assets "just in case", losing 15% of my shit as a tax, or accepting that my shit may all vanish if I don't accept one of the previous two.
---
(not that I'm particularly at risk of this, mind, it just sounds awful in principle)
---
Would say Alphas should get a exp max allowed refund on the drone skills rather than have them locked away on Omega and still count against the alpha max skill point count.
---
Wut?
---
Tengu: Everyone flies these.
---
Loki: 1337 pro PvP.
---
Legion: Weird wormholers fly these ocasionally.
---
Proteus: well, it exists.
---
Um aren't you a dev
---
Still no Lowsec Gate to Stain!
---
Right, but would you push that button if it locked ALL assets in ALL systems for 30-45 days minimum? An afk person would.
---
thanks, just wanted to make sure 700 mill in a tank orca was not to much, as for me its alot of isk :D
---
While it's not a lot of SP, and doesn't affect me, the newly alpha locked skills should get their SP refunded.
---
Otherwise great.
---
Red Frog says 2b in a freighter.
---
With Orca you should be able to MWD+Cloak
---
In a full tank orca? Yes not worth shooting you.
---
Who is y’all? The dumb retard op or GSF?
---
I dunno man, it has 6 low slots. Use 3 of those for tank (plus rigs) and you still have 3 for damage mods. The Gila only realistically has 2. With Gallente Cruiser V, you're looking at a lot of base DPS on your drones. Added bonus: more flexibility in type of drones. You could even start off with 3 sentries as the rats come to you.
---
U can’t get away with just 3 for tank on a t1 resist profile cruiser with one active tank bonus in a T4+ mate. Most Abyss gilas run 3 dda btw. I guess do some more research into what checkboxes you need to tick to reliably run T4 or higher sites.
---
Cargo scanners and ship scanners exist. Suicide gankers exist.
---
Does biology actually effect these accelerators? pretty sure past accelerators were not effected by skills.
---
Thanks for the clarification. So the Lianda event had nothing to do with the Tukoss incident correct?
---
What aspects should be considered for an Alpha account looking at PVE aspects of drones? Am aware of hobgoblins for damage but where else can an alpha creatively go with this?
---
I think they’re both?
---
Some people are really shitty at communicating.
---
good tip thanks :D
---
You left off how much Biology affects the time
---
So if you lose a pod the booster still works?
---
epic :D :D thank you
---
personally have just been to busy to do any fun blackout stuff
---
The true blackout has yet to come. Eve will shut down for 1 week and the real fun begins! ... You can go outside...
---
If I didn't think I could get them out via normal means?  Yeah, pretty definitely, but then I don't really have an issue taking a month or two off :p
---
(plus, contract any asset not in danger to alt to avoid the ALL assets in ALL systems issue anyway)
---
Don't tell me you don't talk to your alts in local
---
Ah, you fooled me when you said you enjoyed mining and watching Netflix then. Completely understandable. Please disregard.
---
Marry me
---
you suck go away
---
Ok, ya got me there. Dunno. Just less safety then.
---
Yeah have you met NSH
---
Most goons dont spout retarded shit like this.
---
oh, yes true, you just, didn't articulate that exactly in the last...nevermind.
---
Little guy = new guy : they say they want new guys to grow. How does this allow new guys to grow.  
---
The amount of stupid oozing just blows me away.
---
well with no local i don't rat with my vnis anyway.
---
If I was to break it down and analyze myself a bit, the first factor is my wife isn't big on gaming. Which caused my initial hesitation. 
---
Also the plan was never to get hooked, just enjoy a game I like, while I've got the time being awake in the night with a newborn.
---
Obviously what I wrote above is a bit exaggerated, but feeling like I was living a double life is somewhat true. When I joined my corp, I suddenly had a lot of dudes that I consider good friends and I wasn't expecting the level of integration that I have with my corp. (To be clear, this is not at all a negative aspect, I have good connections, they're guys I can trust, I enjoy their company etc.)
---
I think the major factor of it is the time that had passed. The more time that passed, the harder it was to come forward with it, because in my head, it was "I've been keeping this from you for a month", to two months, to a year.
---
I was contemplating talking to my wife about it over the last couple of weeks, I was feeling guilty to be honest. This is someone you share a life with, but I've got this separate thing going on. 
---
The other piece is that my daughter is starting to sleep through the night, so to some degree I was going to be losing this time that I was able to set aside, based on a baby's sleep schedule, so if I didn't act now, I'd end up denying myself enjoying Eve.
---
All in All, it comes down to me giving myself anxiety about how she would react, rather than just doing the right thing.
---
I did.  You can’t comprehend.  Or think for yourself it appears.
---
Yup, but that is also a different concern than the normal risk of your structure being destroyed.
---
Now VNI is going to be an OP PvP boat instead of the PvE one it used to be. The intention is good , but I think they were way too generous there.
---
"Depending on the Capsuleer's knowledge of the &lt;a href=showinfo:3405&gt;Biology&lt;/a&gt; skill it will cease to function after at least 24 hours once activated, due to natural..."

has there been any discussion of public fleets for brand new players to get them to that first player engagement that's so crucial?
---
Just ignore the Guy, Clearly noone cares what he have to say.
---
besides, Solarsystems is a fucking awesome dude so i doubt he gives a shit.
---
It is, that's why I would like a system that both secures the assets of people that isn't playing the game in case they decide to come back, while making active players assets lootable for attackers.
---
you scrub. Use a rorqual or go home.
---
Why wouldn't they?

Can't you put citadels in NPC null?

&gt; Existing alpha clone characters with these skill levels trained will find them disabled while they remain in the alpha clone state, similarly to how other omega skill levels become disabled while a character is in the alpha clone state.

Sad they didn't refund the SP to alphas. Imagine being a free-to-play player and spending a month training this skill for it to be taken away /u/CCP_Falcon

Don't you think supers should be a commitment? It was like 2 years ago that Supers couldn't dock anywhere. People made due.

Yep, it's something that we've talked about - I think CCP karkur has been investigating some stuff related to it, but I'm not 100% sure :)
---
If you put 500 plex in your shipcargohold then your ship can't die
---
damn u mad tho
---
Yeah, that's why I'd also restrict the number of structures you could put down in a system, or perhaps a constellation, too.
---
Because your logic train is so derailed that even strong mess won't bring it back into something coherent, I am unable to see how this connects to my statement.
---
Not that sick yet 😂
---
Good read, and frankly over the past fews months I've felt like I'm being told, go fuck yourself and your playstyle. For other reasons then yours I think. I've invested tons of time and money in this game, ran hi sec corp that lost 14b of isk to a war dec group, o well. Solo'd low sec for awhile but while fun for PvP making ISK was a drag. So I moved to null, and I've had the most fun in the game there. I still have many hi sec characters, doing incursions and missions, low sec PvP characters. But null has been fun. I can make ISK, build, be part of something with like minded people, and PvP my ass off, mine, rat, or go explore. Everyone says "we don't need more rorq and carrier pilots plexing" but guess what,I fly a rorq, and a carrier, and VNI rat, I still subbed 8 accounts and I bought Plex and I've never plexeda single account. Because all the building up... is so I can buy all kinds of ships and go blow them up! I feel like I'm being forced to buy Plex to play now to do this. That just isn't fun. And maybe your right I'm just being an old fart who is bitter about the changes that a lot of players obviously want, but I see where this is going.... More micro transations just to keep playing.
---
Thanks mate I'll give it a try!
---
&gt;Gallente Cruiser Bonuses per level:
---
&gt;10% Medium Hybrid Turret Damage and tracking speed
---
&gt; 10% bonuses to Drone Damage, HP and tracking speed
---
&gt;7.5% bonuses to armor repair amount
---
They should just call the new vni a HAC, Jesus Christ look at those bonuses
---
If on any other regular ships those bonuses should be split into at least 4
---
IMO the armor repair one should be removed, vni is already tanky enough for a navy cruiser
---
You don’t get the SP back of your omega skills if your account rolls to alpha. So it’s completely fair
---
r/evejobs is the best place on reddit for recruitment
---
say Drunk Drake 5 times fast.
---
So many words, while they should just say.
---
"We nerf VNI, because you scrubs have been using it too much, get fcked, lol."
---
The famous vni alliance
---
Wormholers have easier access to the outside world and keep their shit in NPC stations that are usually closer to their wormhole.  
---
Yes I think supers should be an initial commitment but then not an absolute requirement to maintain a character coffined in one permanently.
---
I wish my wife was as understanding.... this wife and the first wife...
---
&gt; Do you even play the game dude?????
---
Extensively, and like many others I'm aware of the fact that structure and cap proliferation as well as obscenely unbalanced wealth distribution are some of the largest issues there are.
---
Limits on the number of structures a system/constellation/region can host is also viable for capping structure spam. 
---
As for AFKing - there's a simple solution - don't put all your eggs in one basket.
---
Yah I rly enjoy it. My preferred playstyle is getting my main in a blops, throwing my HK alt out, and having my other alt in a cov dps and just doing blops whaling fleets wherever with like 10-20 of my friends. Most dudes have their alts in HKs so everyone is actively doing something and not bored. Local usually kills this content and we would quickly discover that the region has been spooked and won’t undock anymore. Then we gotta go back into our WH and try again.
---
&gt; Imagine being a free-to-play player and spending a month training this skill for it to be taken away
---
In this scenario they were never omega and just got their skill taken away.
---
Hah,
---
Actually I've never injected or plex'd. All long train and credit card subs. Plus i buy plex with irl money and sell it for additional isk when i do stupid stuff while pvping. Went and looked. It was 19 pve accounts i unsubbed from 12 month credit card subscriptions. They're sitting in training clones training dread and sabre skills until they expire. Some were rorqs, some were sb battleships.
---
I never sold my ore. I always built ships to welp myself or for corp or for alliance or sell cheap so others like vapor trail could pvp. I also just built cap parts up in a stock pile so i could make whatever whenever i wanted. The loot from bs and 6/10 and 10/10 went on my own ships to welp, did not sell dead space stuff.
---
Like i said, pve, was an enjoyable aspect of the game for me. I like being able to build and make whatever i want. 
---
So, no, its not huge, but i do personally and directly impact CCP's bottom line by doing this. 
---
Figure average CCP employee makes $75,000 usd a year, i just stopped paying for 4% to 5% of an employee's salary.
---
I like the fact that they're visually exposed and you can use their presence as intelligence to track fleet movements, buildup of arms and use it to gauge someone's military capability.
---
Thats not really a simple solution if your null group lives out in far null.  Having to constantly run back and forth to npc stations sucks.
---
Okay that's pretty cool, I think id like that as well instead of docking.  Though if you do afk for a rl thing for a while I feel like youd loose your super whilest afk if the structure goes :/
---
Thanks!
---
Bjorn bee
---
I mean test calls good for frat. Check any major timer.
---
There are other ways to give people the incentive to move deeper into nullsec.
---
Re-balancing resource distribution, for instance.
---
Maybe introducing depletable or diminishing resources...
---
All manner of things.
---
Thank you. o7
---
one thing that concerns me when the topic of POS removal comes up is that there will be no "safe" place to titan bridge from. Currently I can drop a 500m POS, set it to a password only I know and titan bridge from it in hostile space. You cannot do the same with any structure due to bumps.
---
Oh no, perish the thought of having to do ~logistics runs~ if you want to hold space.
---
Test is a goon pet 100 percent.
---
And you are an idiot making a low effort post to stir up shit...
---
I’m so sick of that argument “that Wormholers do it”.  If I wanted to play the wormhole game (blackout included) I’d go there.  Hey I want concord to come shoot gankers cause that’s what high sec has
---
All my shit is in my citadel cause I use that shit.  If I have an emergency afk I can’t move my shit.  So bad for player retention man.  
---
The drifters have been buried by the community.  They’re shit.  That’s a a shit argument.  
---
People complained about coffins and they changed that. Was a good change imo.
---
I'll agree with you on that point that cap bumping in general is mega shitty, but that's just how destiny works.
---
Not sure if we'd ever revisit the physics engine for EVE, but it'd be interesting for sure.
---
&gt; The problem being addressed this is that the VNI is so good at its specific role that its is perceived to be pretty much the only viable choice for said activity.
---
yes, it's the only choice - that's why it has been replaced with near identical ships already.
---
I'm also a young ish Dad, and Eve fills the same gap for me... I literally don't have the time or energy to go out with my younger childless friends, so Eve is now my primarily social outlet... My wife has been very supportive since I came out, and even occasionally asks questions about it... I don't even mind that she totally glazes over during the answer
---
Yeah I've known bisu for years dude, "shut up bisu" is most of what we say to him.
---
Yes PERIS THE THOUGHT, its more than just logistic runs Falcon in that case and it is a BAD THING despite your mockery &gt;:(
---
And that should be acceptable. Caps are a big investment and you should have to actively keep them safe. It's kinda cheap that the strongest ships in the game can play it safe just by docking. Just like large military weapons IRL they have a chance to be targeted and the same should apply to caps+ in EvE.
---
If you are a cap+ owner and going to take a break it should be your responsibility that your caps are safe either passing it to someone in your corp/alliance or a friend.
---
If that happens to the point where the big empires are back to mindless risk aversion, I'm fucking off back to jspace.
---
I have realized after the past week just how much I miss living in wormholes. Fuck going back to lowsec.
---
Because hunting in your own krabbing ground is what people are doing. Or not.
---
&gt;!(unless you're PL)!&lt;
---
&gt; mobility. Not just to sig tank, but to align and gtfo off grid when a gank shows up.
---
the myrm and domi get mjd, you can't get better gtfo for ratting.
---
Was it a truck full of troll bubbles? Cos next time it should be a truck full of troll bubbles.
---
Yes, assuming they work the same as the Master-At-Arms Accelerators that are given as a Recruit-A-Friend bonus. (They have the same icon and similar description)
---
The CSM's just a popularity contest, isn't it?
---
 I haven't really played since like last November since I had a newborn  to take care of. Saw this free SP promo and figured I would re sub some  of my accounts to take advantage of it. My perfectly trained 5/5 all  skills Rorq/JF industrial pilot now shows that he can't fly either. Did  they change skill requirements for these ships recently or is this just  because I just re subbed and it will take some time before it registers  why my skills were when I was omega?
---
That should be acceptable actually because this is a game and people have real lives that are more important.  Yes Caps are a big investment but the danger should be in using them, not storing them.  As well typically people will just steal the super cap if you hand it to a friend.
---
Every time I turn up the music volume in eve it's an instant nostalgia moment for me. Great sound track indeed!
---
Best news yet.
---
Who worries about sisi? Go play on TQ
---
Legit question; why not simply just get rid of auto-aggression on all drones? I’ve asked this several times but I have yet to get a legit or coherent answer. 
---
The problem seems to be passive application of dps. Solving that by shifting dps from drones to turrets just seems like patchwork.
---
Hmm, what about a declared capital citadel for each alliance that has the normal asset safety mechanic and the rest of the alliance citadel's don't? 
---
The idea being you'd have one "safe" place to stash things.  It protects individuals core holdings from complete loss, but also creates a strategic target if an alliance relies too heavily on it... While requiring them to risk assets in other citadel's unless they turtle up at home every day... Probably tie it to holding sov to help discourage us from just splitting off dozens of alt alliances.
---
Additionally, I'd keep asset safety in the case of a structure being unanchored... You wouldn't demolish your house without packing up first... Usually?
---
Hey. Um.  Could we maybe see something done about equipping stabs to drone boats?  Or stabs in general equipped to ratting ships?
---
There are Sisi exclusive corps.
---
Yes, as retarded as it sounds.
---
incursus's are cool
---
This makes me want to fit bait VNIs and go 'rat' in some nullbloc's space.
---
Sometimes people get caught in the gears of progress. They'll get over it.
---
Hold up, does that mean he has a wig on his crotch too??
---
If they’re going for anti-boy alpha, they could still program that
---
The danger should be in both using one and just owning one. Maybe this should apply more for titans and super caps.
---
The reason why we have so many now is because there is no danger in just owning one. If there is no danger in owning one than we just get a influx of them with people just storing them in stations.
---
EVE is becoming dead space full of blue balls and gank only PVP'ers.   
---
3 day in a row of going out for a fight and the enemy vanishes.   
---
Flew into HS yesterday and there was gatecamp in LS of 10 or so. We went back with 8 of us and they ran.   
---
Can't mine, Can't Rat, Can't have a battle. Can't PVP.  
---
Guess it is go play in HS time.
---
That is actually a pretty cool idea. How it would work in practice, fuck knows.. =)
---
Good lord so there’s no work now??  Wow
---
What now?
---
&gt; easier access to the outside world and keep their shit in NPC stations that are usually closer to their wormhole.
---
Uh....what?
---
Fair point, but wouldn’t that same argument apply to eg missiles? Just program not to hit F1 instead of F?
---
&gt; No one would do that. Better mine less with something less expensive but safer

Like, it’s not even “no one would” because that’s the past. Nobody did. It got parked in a POS and used off grid links and people warped back to it to compress back when there wasn’t another way to get ore out of nullsec and high value ore only existed in null. And even then generally it wasn’t worth the effort to do.
---
A max boost rorq can be 2.2B with some solid tank if you have no excavs/bling because you're T2 mining drones.
---
Believe it or not, there are groups of players that exclusively play on Sisi and gank people testing Titans, Supers and stuff like that.
---
Heck yea, newest fashion trend!
---
I hear you.  I'm doing World of Warships instead of Eve PVE now.  Thinking about trying out WoT.
---
&gt; I’m so sick of that argument “that Wormholers do it”
---
Thats because you apparently don't understand it.
---
The point is that clearly it's a situation that does happen to plenty of people. You can go do something else if you don't like it, but clearly loads of people will risk it.
---
You can move to lowsec.
---
&gt; cause I use that shit
---
And no isk in your wallet?
---
This isn't really different than before citadels. If someone took over your station, you no longer had that shit.
---
*if there's a super umbrella
---
which is a big caveat
---
Dont know why your confused at the truth.  Wormholers have easier access to storing in npc stations via both random wormholes and wormhole rolling  (safer as well as you can control it and dont have to traverse across potentially dangerous static space.)
---
I lost 100% of my net worth my second month into the game. Was carrying all my stuff in one basket looking for a new home base. Today I have well over 150billion isk. Keep on keeping on, you'll get it back in no time.
---
Anarchy Online has really good ambient sci-fi music as well.
---
I disagree that there should be a flat danger in just owning one based on this being just a game and having it get blown up without you online and using it.  as well there is certainly still a tax to it if it goes to asset safety and it isnt a small one.
---
Ah right surprised CCP would let alphas train specialization skills
---
When you log in click your character sheet and see if it says Omega. If not, it hasn’t gone through for some reason.
---
Good advice. I had the same experiance and solved it the same way.
---
They did not get kicked, they rebranded as Professionals Inc, which is pretty hilarious truly
---
I assume then you want 0.0 space to be totally empty, with all the capsuleers moving out to NPC Lowsec, or High Sec, or even NPC Null, That is what will happen when you remove or tweak further, Asset Safety.
---
There are a few incursions groups still running around, Warp To Me comes to mind. Haven’t tried the invasions so can’t speak to that. What I would say though is join a Corp and set a goal. Those two things keep me playing, without a goal and some good dudes to blap shit with though, I’d have quit a while ago.
---
looks to be a quality shitpost
---
Whatever you wanna say.
---
&gt; SP hasn't really stopped botters either.
---
especially not when CCP's dishing it out like candy on halloween right now.
---
&gt; Nullsec is supposed to be dangerous space. 
---
Exactly. It's supposed to be the wild west of space. It's unknown territory. Anything can and will happen. But not if all players form massive NAPs/NIPs/coalitions/pre-arranged fights. Yea, human instict will lead to the safety in numbers bullshit, but it's not healthy for the game.
---
And while I agree with your other points, I'm of the opinion that cynos need to be more nuanced. Hotdropping 5 titans on a carrier on even a fucking battleship is terrible and should simply be made impossible somehow. But a black ops gang, doing black ops stuff? I say that this should still be possible. How you'd limit the size of the fleet involved is beyond me tho. Maybe give cynos a certain quote in mass they can receive?
---
Do you take requests?
---
They are way more expensive than T2 drones
---
drones are too good at the role, the VNI is just unfortunate enough to be the most efficient drone using ship. that's why after the VNI gets taken out the back and bastardised the replacements will be... yet more drone boats.
---
Capitals aren't as special as before.
---
&gt; people jumping ratters should create content for the hunter, the ratte
---
Yes I'm sure that those who krab their brains out are looking forwards to getting ganked as content they'll enjoy.
---
&gt; Hunters should be able to see roughly where a good area is
---
Also just curious about this. I suppose you can see ships destroyed in space also, so there's that, the difference being whoever killed a ship in the system will be flying around.
---
With the ''pressure'' from the Drifters that lead to local going away, why leave plain in-game hints to make your job easier. If you're to be reported in intel someone actually have to make an effort in looking out for you.
---
Not anymore
---
It's my understanding the USTZ has gotten really bad in EVE across the board.
---
So it says Omega next to my name, but when i go to apply the SP i have available it says "omega state required" so it seems like im in some limbo between alpha and omega.
---
Friendly reminder that dotlan only updates once an hour of ratting deltas
---
Crabs who cry there’s too much intel are spodbrain idiots
---
&gt; People put the time and money into training, buying, and setting up an umbrella. 
---
Yet it macroeconomically breaks the game by pumping tons of SP, minerals, and ISK into it.
---
&gt; They coordinate and give up game time on that account to form the umbrella. 
---
Yet lots of people access riskless farm without putting any effort save for joining an alliance.
---
&gt; The umbrella stops you from easy kill
---
Yet lots of PvP'ers, who carry the game by actually paying $ for sub/ISK rather than merely farming the PLEX each month, leave the game due to the lack of said easy kills.
---
can confirm &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
So how would you counter a alliance building caps and then just hoarding them in a station? There is no counter to it.
---
Now I am not saying they should just be left out in space with anyone able to attack them. Maybe they can be parked near a station, lets just say like 10km from a station. Either using the stations active defense or possibly a bubble around the cap. However this bubble should be destroyable with no timers.
---
The drifters were an awful mechanic and no reasonable person should encourage them.
---
I'm not clicking this. Tell me why I should click this.
---
&gt;  Anyone looking for interesting other choices that isn't afk is already flying something else.
---
a Hel, they're flying a Hel.
---
I mean, it was a trend like.. a hundred-ish years ago.
---
Late night solo roams often calls for any peak-era Tangerine Dream.
---
Yeah, it's a Nightmare
---
The ESI delay for NPC kills is an hour, what's the ingame map delay? I may not be using my tools as well as I could be, wow.
---
I definitely think we need some heavy nerfs to capitals and capital umbrellas if this game is going to stick around another decade.
---
Not stirring up shit, just stating facts. Olmeca Gold is a liar. I patiently await him to prove me wrong.
---
How do you theorize limiting citadels that players won't abuse? Every suggestion I've ever seen on that topic has always had some glaring flaw that players could abuse with ease.
---
Are you implying people don't do any logistics to own their space now? Because I know a lot of people who would say it is basically an entire job to keep their infrastructure running.
---
Ok so 850 against a ship with zero heat resists....not there yet, but 3/4 of the way there with a theoretical ship with a thermal hole the size of Texas.

---
&lt;3 I'm just messing with you bud!
---
Honestly, I'd love to just delete stabs from the game.
---
Complains about toxicity, replies in a rather toxic manner to a couple posts.
---
You sir, are the epitome of a hypocrite.
---
But where's the fun in that? :P &lt;3
---
Alliances will just make holding corps for citadels then.
---
Right now?  Id introduce a tool for punching up from smaller guys to give them a chance one specifically aimed at  killing super caps even if its just some of them.  I'd also fucking fix the mineral distribution and make citadels abit easier to kill.  Maybe even nerfing Supercaps themselves so they are just generally easier to kill.  Supers right now are your tool for everything and they are unassailable or really counterable.  Even dreadbombs being one of the most effective things against titans are not successful enough to deal with them, You need too many dreads for a single titan and they often all die in the process.  Supers are the swiss army turtle of eve right now  (more talking titans sorry.)
---
Excellent
---
why would you even bother buying a rorqual if you don't have a super umbrella unless you're fitting cargo rigs to it?
---
Mostly bombs and torpedoes tbh
---
What is a "full tank orca" to you exactly? O.o
---
I had a friend being tanked in niarja with his Orca, rage quited the game over the issue... He believe his orca was fully tanky, and didn't get how and why it happened.
---
His fit was horrible... a true fail fit, on top of carrying around 3b isk on it... &gt;.&gt;
---
Has everyone here said, just don't get the value go above 1b and a proper tank fit should be a no game. o/
---
Just make sure that your "tank fit" is actually a tank fit!
---
This looks an awful lot like a "who the fuck cares"
---
same
---
its just a video
---
True but last a bit longer too so it sort of even out.  My point really was I'm not sure restricting T2 when you can use a more superior faction drone (for an alpha) makes sense.  Even if you could train special to level 2 it's not a massive difference really in alpha terms..
---
J
---
\*twitches\* ....alright then.  Im sorry I get worked up about this but these things are important to something I love.
---
So will alpha characters get there SP returned for any drone skills over trained or is this where CCP nerf Alpha players again?
---
It's one of the few game soundtracks that I listen to outside of the game when I'm doing stuff. I'm a huge Electronic music fan though.
---
How does this pertain to eve? Are you fucking retarded, op?
---
I think that is an hour in game too.
---
"Pilots in space" is 15 or 30 minutes.
---
Those are both short enough that if someone appears on there, they're probably still ratting.
---
&gt; Actually I've never injected or plex'd. All long train and credit card subs. Plus i buy plex with irl money and sell it for additional isk when i do stupid stuff while pvping. Went and looked. It was 19 pve accounts i unsubbed from 12 month credit card subscriptions. 
---
I don't know a single Rorqual multiboxer that pays $ for sub instead of merely farming/selling ore to sub the next month. It's kind of a "cool story" to hear you paid $ to keep 19 PvE accounts subbed for a year instead of merely getting PLEX that equals to 500 billion or more from a sale. If the story is true, then you are an outlier case. Even if it's true, you still pumped the game with minerals, which broke its economy. Your contribution might just be the collateral damage CCP needs to bite, in order to actually organically fix this game.
---
i'm actually the richest person, sorry
---
Never stops being funny to have your TQ friends dunk on their supers and harvest the salt.
---
I agree with everything except the limits on hangar capacity and mooring numbers. Limiting those would just lead to more citadel spam.
---
How often do you see people posting about how boring Eve's PVE is?
---
Getting jumped *is* fun if you're bait fit and you have friends nearby. Successfully escaping from an attempted gank is also fun. (Far more so than docking up when a neutral appears in local.)
---
Looking at his posting history, he is just somebody who seems to enjoy posting videos to random subreddits.  Down votes seem appropriate.
---
lmao NSH is part of the QFC? neat
---
Top 10 ratters.
---
Yes but if you have 3 highish SP dedicated alts, you could just sub for one omega account and use any one of them interchangeably with their full SP instead of having to sub to three omega accounts to use them at their full SP.
---
Every ship should get killmarks.
---
Massively overbuffed the VNI to overcompensate for the role change... this is clearly the best navy cruiser in the game now and arguably top 3 in that hull size.
---
Its fast, it has good fitting, it can be ganked or tanked out the ass, flexible roles, and it will be hella cheap for months if not years to come
---
Buckle up!
---
(this is not a complaint... just an observation)
---
Aww it's a Spam Baby. 
---
Only a month old and can't even find a borderline appropriate sub for their shit.
---
Yeah I think CCP's only real method of dealing with cap+ and citadels is coming up with a mechanic to deal with them. Even though I really like my idea it would be such a huge change I could actually see a large amount of people unsub over it. In my mind, using a cap ( mainly super and titan's) should be a risk with owning one being included in that.
---
You assume cyno alts are the only kind of alts people use.
---
Well, then -- I'm glad that we've come to the conclusion that such changes to asset safety are meaningless if the will to also apply it to lowsec is missing. This was a good discussion.
---
Fuck off.
---
&gt; You can go do something else if you don't like it, but clearly loads of people will risk it.
---
"loads"
---
WHlers are pretty niche, though, so.
---
Dude doesn't make design decisions for CCP. All this stuff is just him engaging in the same ol' pedestrian posting that the rest of us do when talking about the game. It's a good thing -- means that he's trying to keep his head in the game.
---
I get it if a dst piles on stabs over a real tank. There's meaningful choice there.
---
But VNI's and ishtars equip them with no penalty what so ever.
---
Maybe make drones not auto aggro?  And make stabs penalize targeting range by 90%?
---
Have you looked on zkill and sorted by orca?
---
I thought a full tank fit for an orca was shield mods and bulkheads in the lows.
---
spy, we know you are collecting his ship fitting for your database, im gonna blow the top off this scan you guys run!
---
#freeourfittings
---
I'm aware of this - I ran a corporation orders of magnitude smaller than most of the alliances out there for almost a decade, and even that was a ballache.
---
I'm talking on an individual level, having to actually be out in space is a good thing - regardless of what you're doing.
---
stop fucking hate 4 no fucking reason
---
Nidhoggur, Hel, Thanatos, Nyx, boson Titan, rorqual, DED Loki. There's not a lot of variation. Maybe still a few smartbomb machariels. But no one actively ratting is flying a vni. Even someone flying ten VNIs is probably spending the majority of their time on Netflix.
---
&gt;on any mining grid
---
write your sentences better then
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
get gud
---
Man, AO had some unique tracks, you're right. I think about that game often and wish they updated the visuals and not just the engine itself. I would go back to it.
---
go back to VK
---
no u
---
You can use those skills for something else though. Nobody said alpha accounts were for building specialized VNI pilots.
---
Don't fucking spam for no fucking reason you fuck!
---
Honestly, SP seems like a fairly harmless thing to offer... I'm fifteen years into eve and still skilling, a new guy getting a leg up doesn't hurt me or make me less competitive. 
---
Hell another fifteen year old room spending his cash to speed up training doesn't really hurt me either. 
---
It seems like it would really only hurt people who are so farming since it might undercut them...
---
Good!
---
His fit was armor tanked... Armor rigs and stuff! 
---
You got the proper fit if you done bulkheads and shield o7
---
Well, considering CCP broke chat like a couple years ago and still never managed to get it fully working again is it any surprised that they broke it again this time?
---
My biology is at V!
---
OMG, I'm a drug addict...
---
Join a new player friendly group. I recommend Pandemic Horde. They will help teach you the game.
---
200m you'll get ganked no matter what
---
Can we also have for the amount of time a ship stays cloaked in a system, the weaker their systems become until they can’t even cyno or do damage
---
Also for the amount of hours a ship spends pvping concord should build threat to come and auto aggress them even in nullsec as a renegade sociopath not tied to any large faction for protection
---
Or did you want “punishment for playing the game” mechanics to only apply to pve?
---
Current state of PvP in eve is so bad the answer is honestly "nowhere". It's equally bad eve5ywhere.
---
No matter where you go finding good fights takes fucking forever.
---
This is true. Drone aggro should be looked at though. But anything that makes more clicks happen I can only assume helps with detection processes.
---
I am having fun with a gnosis with max drone control range and signal boost script. Spend warriors II like ammo from 200km and as so you can run C3 wh sites while they can't shoot you back
---
Of course you are... We never said you weren't!!!
---
We just have some people that you should meet... They will help you!
---
Don't worry sport, you will be fine in no time! ^^
---
I can confirm they do, I used accelerators in the past events and they take full benefits from that skill!!
---
The cross I bear is the objective validity of my opinion over those of others. I didn't choose this burden, but I shoulder it all the same.
---
CCP foresaw this happening. Passing out free SP as an "event"
---
So high effort and inconsistent and not readily available is "easier" than have a fairly low effort consistent supply line?
---
Since when?
---
&gt; dont have to traverse across potentially dangerous static space.
---
You mean like a wormhole chain?
---
why not anymore?
---
also which?
---
Ships are ammo. Dont get attached.
---
I don't know if it is intentional or not, but your wording makes it seem as if CCP doesn't get any money off of PLEX that's on the market that people buy and use to sub their accounts. When in reality that PLEX costs MORE than normal subscription. so CCP would make even more money off of people who plex their accounts rather than sub their accounts. The plex on the market is not the actions of CCP supplying PLEX on the market. The only way that plex will make it to market is if a player buys it and then puts it on the market themselves.
---
CCP have stated that when people buy PLEX it is not "Counted" towards their bottom line (or statistics for profit) until it is USED and no longer in the game. So people who stop plexing their accounts actually hurt CCPs budget more than those who stop direct subs.
---
Yeah I have always liked the idea once you are in the anom, especially with a capital, you are held down for a while with npc bubbles or tower HIC scrams. Rorqs are held down with siege but capital PVE is largely unchecked. 
---
Removing local dwindles capital target opportunities.
---
According to you.
---
I must disagree. I enjoy the soundtrack yes but it's no comparison to Stellaris. I usually listen to the latter and turn Eve's one off.
---
“My playstyle is fine but theirs isn’t”
---
&gt; WHers are pretty niche
---
Wormholes also include a long list of other inconveniences we aren't talking about.
---
&gt; Nothing was lost. Firesales are the equivalent to just paying that 15% to the taxman.
---
So then it has nothing to do with losing your shit at all?
---
Both of those result in you not having your shit.
---
There is no EVE without autism.
---
At least until they get spooped by a hunter, which usually takes about 5 minutes in detorid lol
---
But ships are friends, not food
---
Get out of here OP with your logic and sh---.
---
How soon until we unite and wage war against high sec?
---
Try star citizen's soundtrack. Sometimes I just log in, land on a random planet and chill, or just appreciated piloting in canyons with hotas, only with the engines and the ambiant music...
---
Your reply does not answer my question. Why should I click this thing
---
jesus man, you hid eve from her? Why?
---
Thanks I'll have to check it out along with the other suggestions.
---
I click on that video, remember it from like 2009, scroll to comments, see that the guy died. Shit sucks :/
---
The Domis you describe can't be used my alphas, CCP has little worry for paying bots.
---
Tfw no data center for Pirate factions
---
RIP my standings I luv u Guristas &lt;3
---
I agree with everything but the last part. Newbies can't miss something they never knew in the first place.
---
In the end it's still more of a toolbox and a map than a game. It gives you possibilities. What you do with them, is your choice.
---
&gt; but your wording makes it seem as if CCP doesn't get any money off of PLEX that's on the market that people buy and use to sub their accounts.
---
Disclaimer: I wasn't shared specific data about this.
---
I dont know how much of my campaign material you've followed. But I always defended the view that mere PLEX'ed accounts are not as valuable as the community seem to think they are. Particularly when they damage the organic ecosystem of Eve by pumping SP, ISK and minerals into it. They are merely upward pressure on PLEX prices. Higher PLEX prices might make some people more likely to pay $ for it. But it might also drive some people, who can't afford the amount of ISK per month, to away from the game, making the game organically less lively
---
&gt; CCP have stated that when people buy PLEX it is not "Counted" towards their bottom line (or statistics for profit) until it is USED and no longer in the game. So people who stop plexing their accounts actually hurt CCPs budget more than those who stop direct subs.
---
If you unsub your Rorquals PLEX doesn't get unused. It just gets cheaper, and different accounts use it.
---
Pretty sure it’s the Goons fault.
---
nah, r/eve is more like r/notliketheothergirls
---
Everyone always steers new guys to the null blocs, and I honestly can't tell whether they think that's genuinely the best for them, or it's a disingenuous recruitment tactic.
---
Back in mah day you had a toon per super, wether it was a holder or a fullf fledged pilot. It meant super fleets were an investment and luxury. An alliance that could field 50-100 supers had a huge fleet because of this reason.
---
I completely agree.  To build a titan you should jettison cans outside stations and have to have the station play a crane grab mini game of collecting the ore piece by piece to build it.
---
Also citadels should self destruct whenever supercapital get too close and alert every ganking group exactly where this happened
---
Isn’t that fun :). That’s why we play the game after all, the more horrible punishment the better mmh yeah.
---
also hisec stations should follow these rules
---
Thanks for spamming! All of your videos reported to youtube for misleading content.
---
I am sad that this is needed, glad that it is being done.
---
I assume that the 'big reveal' will be with all or most of the animations/effects in place so I am looking forward to seeing it, just the same
---
m
---
It says if thousands of fat nerds screamed out and were suddenly silenced
---
see thats how normal people react to the starterpack and that stuff
---
i dont get either why people REEEEEEEEE about 1mil SP or the 20% dmg bonus booster for newbies 
---
sure its exploitable but so is everything else in EVE so fuck it might aswell have a shot at keeping more new players
---
Yeah, removing auto-agression might be a solutino, but... Why not make NPCs aggress drones more?
---
I'we been out of game for a couple of years. Last time I checked, Dominix lvl4 mission runners were in trouble because rats started actually killing drones. What happened to that? I saw it happen a few times in HS anoms, but it was more due to my aggro missmanagement.
---
I mean, if you look at it, there is no need to nerf damage or tracking (except for ogres, damn they track like tetragrammaton cleric), but make drones glass cannon, that can be killed more easily. What can drone boat without drones do?
---
Then again, I was out for some tima and still catching up to meta and might be wrong.
---
&gt; Wormholes also include a long list of other inconveniences we aren't talking about.
---
Right!  And the majority of the playerbase hasn't opted into it.
---
&gt;Both of those result in you not having your shit.
---
Huh?  No, my point is that killing asset safety is considerably harsher than pre-citadels, as your station getting taken over very rarely (deadzoning was neither common, nor immune to leakage) resulted in losing a larger fraction of your assets/worth than the 15% that goes to the asset safety taxman today.
---
Haven't played Stellaris yet. I'll have to queue it up and give it a listen.
---
Welcome to hell!!!!
---
You will be spanked, destroyed, exploited, probably called a little bitch, and you will fuking love it!!!

---
Did you even read the notes? The point of the change is *because* VNIs are favored over other faction cruisers...
---
Now try adding some sense to your comment
---
idk either or is fine..

---
They just opened a new time release server. I went back. It's still fun.
---
botting sentry domis are for omega bots m8
---
High effort my ass, they are definitely readily available as well.  They are inconsistent with where the whole opens up specifically but not with regards to sec status for safety.  The wormhole chains are of ten short as well so your entire argument here is bassically bs.
---
Join Eve University totally neutral starter Corp it has campuses in all flavours of space so you can try before you buy. It also means when you move on to a Corp later on you will not be barred because you are applying from the wrong side of a Sov Null bloc.  Train into a bomber join bombers bar get some great kills and if you die its a cheap easy to replace ship when ready move on to a new home.
---
Well again, you make one wrong thinking step. PLEX is not a general good, like a spoon or even a concert ticket. And it's neither limited in demand nor supply, unlike most goods. 
---
PLEX is a one-way-currency. What you claim is right, if RMT would BUY PLEX with $ and then SELL PLEX with $. But that is not the case, therefore it's not a classic reseller.
---
Or another approach for you:
---
The first transaction: Person buys PLEX to gain an advantage ingame (in form of isk usually). -&gt; Transaction where CCP makes money
---
Second transaction: Person buys PLEX and uses it (PLEX is lost) with isk to buy something (no advantage, as he paid isk for it) -&gt; has an effect of isk/PLEX price but not really relevant for CCP
---
NOW RMT goes in between, takes the PLEX and sells it AGAIN for an advantage ingame. -&gt; basically RMT does NOT SELL PLEX but and advantage (isk) 
---
HOWEVER, CCP had the monopoly over the "advantage" market. Suddenly, another guy sells that too, and "steals" the revenue of this advantage market.
---
To make a small analogy: It's like buying a DVD of a movie, for private use. Then after you saw it, you don't need to see it again and you give it to a shop (for a beer for example). The shop goes ahead and resells the DVD again, and the same story repeats itself. In the end, you basically have a "renting" system of Experience. And even though multiple people saw the DVD, only one SINGLE copy was sold by the creator. 
---
Now please tell me: Did the creator of the movie missed out some earnings or would it be the same if the movie was never resold/rented?
---
"I asked you to provide evidence for your claim that RMT causes an actual, loss in PLEX sales." Much more evidence than what I showed before you are not going to get. And you don't have to be a science major to know that that WAS hard conclusion. If you say you want more, then I ask you: "Do you believe that every apple falls from the tree or is it enough to draw a hard conclusion from the known facts? I mean, every apple could behave differently, right?"

&gt;Hello most excellent capsuleers!
---
I see somebody got the news of a new Bill and Ted being made.
---
Ok?
---
Please, for the love of Bob, ***make this happen***.
---
holy shit man, I just resubbed thanks to blackout but this chat made my erection even bigger. please pull the trigger already.
---
It will be a great place once it is implemented. Thank you CCP for adding to this monument of love and memories of our fellow pilots who are no longer with us.
---
I remember when I first started playing, I was surprised by how safe null is for a supposedly 'lawless and dangerous' area.
---
I found it was impossible to die in my VNI when I could just warp away the moment someone grey showed up in local.
---
Eventually I got absurdly bored and wanted to roam for PvP action. I went with 2 of my irl friends and we went on cruiser roams for about a week without any 'gudfites'. 
---
All the ratters would dock up, and any fleets that did come to meet us were so disproportionate in quality (pirate cruisers, T3s) or quantity (like 5+ people to chase us 3 out of their sov).
---
We quit the game shortly after. I'm pretty saddened to see this risk adverse ISK/hr fetishization has only increased since then.

Well this graph: https://www.adam4eve.eu/commodity.php?typeID=39&amp;regionID=10000002&amp;avg=0&amp;from=2007-07-15&amp;until=2019-07-18 tells another story again;) lucky thing we got the indicators from CCP, that you cannot just cherrypick the one you like the most;)
---
I mean, the new VNI is good, but the solo hunters don’t really exist anymore in things besides a Loki. And you’ll still die to a Loki no matter how well you fly/fit unless the pilot is bad.
---
Yeah. And I could see it being overwhelming going straight to null. Gotta keep up on the Intel channel, do esi, any other shit they are required to register and use, more difficult to access the markets without dying. It's a much less convenient style of play for a new person, might be overwhelming or rendered un-fun. The "apply to horde/karmafleet/etc" feels like a near meme at this point. An insider joke where the new guy doesn't realize that hes the punchline. Eve is a game best cut into bite size chunks while you're first learning, and everyone's telling them to open wide.
---
You still believe that shit?  10s if not 100,000s of players joined eve because some guy paid them?  
---
Yes, the battle was instigated because someone paid some Low Sec groups to fight.  But once it became obvious shit was going down, everyone jumped in of their own volition.  It was EvE's biggest 3rd party PARTY!

Also remember not to autopilot, autopilot is bad.
---
Fair enough, I did logistics for test during delve and at some point the work we put in definitely was bad for my mental health, and the thought of ccp making large alliances have to do even more to maintain their space hurts me. Some improvements have been made in allowing safe delegation, but the spy meta will always exists. Better acl control over ihubs and corp roles would go along way to helping people who did what I used.
---
I wasn't aware it was trendy to live with crushing self-doubt. I'll have to consult my handbook on contemporary self-presentation more closely.
---
&gt; That's ingame atleast. Realistically Team not-goons would probably eventually win due to burning out slower. 
---
Would that that were at least possible.  I think everyone INCLUDING goons would have more fun thinking it was possible.  It would give goons a reason to mine and grind for the next 1000 titans and Keepstars.  Now I think they do it out of habit.  If no one will fight 100 Titans what is the purpose to have more?  Likewise the keepstars. 
---
Today, no one can attack such a group.  Timers mean at the first keepstar fight you won't deploy your 500 titans vs their 1000.  Those T3C gatecamps?  Today they would die in a boson fire.
---
Eve empire building game is over.  Someone won.  But as in most games, if someone wins, game is over.   We will know CCP thinks the same if you see something happen to the umbrella.
---
Sadly, I think nothing will happen.  Ansiblex is the proof of that.  Creating a structure with no jump fatigue means an increase of the size of the umbrella rather than a limiting of who can live under it.
---
As for exploration I typically easily find a few to several Exploration sites per hour whether in Wormholes or in Null, you might watch an Explo video and see why your experience has been so different.

but yeah saddly you need to run some missions to get the +3 fed or Ytiri standings needed
---
I get the general gist of what you're saying here, but there's a few things that are a bit concerning here.
---
&gt;Whether you like it or not, the games industry is changing and EVE needs to change with it. That's just the reality of things.
---
The changes the games industry are undergoing aren't really changes for the better. The increased prevalence of lootboxes, the focus on profit over players, the extreme monetisation of games through microtransactions designed to squeeze every last penny out of players treated as little more than cash cows, these are the changes the games industry is and has been going through and they are not changes that should be reflected in EVE's business model. If you put profit before players you will get neither, if you put players before profit you will get both.
---
&gt;at the same time if we can ease the path for new players to get into the game and have fun, then we'll look at doing so - even at the risk of rustling the jimmies of some of our existing players along the way.
---
Yes, but making new players pay $5 for a boost ahead really doesn't seem like a good way of doing things. It sets a precedent for the acceptance of other sort of "pay for a boost" systems which really aren't healthy for a game. A better option might be to roll this starter pack into the first purchase of Omega on an account, so that new players get an incentive to sub their accounts and get the full EVE experience. Also, the booster that comes with the starter pack needs to be changed to make it less exploitable, say by making its effects disappear once a player has passed a certain number of SP.
---
&gt;the same groups of people start screeching about "pay to win" and "muh sandbox".
---
While I agree with you that the concept of a pure player-driven sandbox leads to unsustainable player mentalities, and that a game is improved and made dynamic by adding other forces to that sandbox while still allowing players to dynamically interact with them, I think you brushing aside and ignoring concerns over pay-to-win mechanics and/or the precursors to those mechanics is fairly arrogant. Players have a right to look at the changes being made to EVE, notice the parallels between those changes and other changes made in other games which eventually became P2W, and voice and express their concerns. 
---
It's a very slippery slope from "$5 starter pack to give new players a boost" and "PLEX ammunition", and every inch down that slide is justifiable. You don't just go from not-P2W to P2W in a single change, after all, but the destination remains the same. You dismissing rightful player concerns as "screeching" really doesn't help our concerns over the future of EVE, especially since your company is owned by a company known for implementing P2W mechanics in other MMOs.
---
&gt;If it comes down to a choice between EVE struggling through a lack of fresh blood, or pissing a few people off and seeing some noise on the internet because we've decided to do something different, then prepare your jimmies mate, because imma come a rustlin'.
---
Yes, but there is a justified concern as to how far CCP is willing to go to attract new players, and how much of the game you are willing to compormise to do that. I know you said earlier, "the intention isn't to break down the core pillars of what make EVE the game it is", and I don't think you're wrong on this, but there will still have to be compromises made to get new people into this game, largely because the barriers to entry are related to fundamental design philosophies (eg. permanent loss, real-time skill training, always-on PvP, etc.). The question is what those compromises will be and how many of your core audience you will drive off with them.
---
I bring forth these concerns because I've seen what happens to other games when they try to court the mythical "wider audience" rather than maintaining a strong core playerbase. These games inevitably flounder and turn into shadows of their former selves. I do not currently believe that this will happen with EVE, and the recent changes made by CCP such as the Blackout give me further confidence that CCP will be able to bring in new players without making unacceptable compromises to the core philosophy of the game, but at the same time I can't help but be slightly concerned when I hear of a respected member of CCP being so dismissive towards what sound like genuine concerns. I'm willing to believe it's a case of missing the legitimate concerns in the sea of random flailing, but it's still concerning. It's language I've heard elsewhere, from other developers, and it's language that generally precedes changes which are detrimental to the core audience of a game.
---
In conclusion, I have high hopes for CCP and I remain confident that CCP can do what's best for this game. I remain a strong financial supporter of this game and an enthusiastic member of the EVE community.
---
We know almost nothing about the killing NPCs part of the event yet.
---
But I can guarantee that there is a hard cap on how much can be earned from it though, and that it is probably fairly low. (250k tops would be my guess) It will be in the form of completing one-time checkboxes like "kill 1 NPC", "kill 5 NPCs", "kill 20 NPCs", etc. It will not be farmable beyond completing each checkbox once.
---
then yes
---
meh no loot who cares
---
There are no missile boats that are as efficient as current VNI
---
While it's probably good for the game, RIP any poor fuck real player that chose Gallente for his alpha.  At the very least gallente alpha skills should be refunded.
---
I had never heard of this region until it showed up on the MER this month... care to share any insights?
---
You are the real meta!!! lol
---
Ah, makes sense! Thank you!
---
I thought it was a version of Excel with a klunky interface and the occasional explosion.
---
it's a window management simulator
---
My inclination is to agree that CCP will have a hard cap on SP you can gain, but on their webpage they say this:
---
" Gain as many Skill Points as you can during the Skilling Spree between 24 July and 21 August for destroying any NPC in New Eden! "
---
[https://www.eveonline.com/now/season-of-skills](https://www.eveonline.com/now/season-of-skills)
---
That doesn't sound like a cap.
---
Are you?
---
If they activate PANIC before they get to structure, they're doing it wrong.
---
You show up / coordinate enough to get almost 500 nerds from 3 groups to spend the time and energy to travel out to you, and stand down once it's not worth it for them to turn around. The goal here was to waste as much of their time as possible. :&gt;)
---
The last hull timer was our chance to have a good fight with roughly equal numbers, as the kind of batphone I rang isn't something that can happen often. This timer was planned as a giant blue ball fest since it was hit the day after the last hull timer. We stayed quiet in the coord channels until the last possible minute to throw off their intel, and it seemed to have worked.

Had my accounts deactivated for years, stumbled upon the EvE Soundtrack on Youtube and after listening to it for a while I got so nostalgic that I reactivated my accounts....only to find out that the nostalgia was better than the actual game.
---
Dreks and Leshaks were a huge leap forward.
---
Also a good point, but it’s still somewhat indirect as an argument against removing auto-aggro as a whole. 
---
I agree that missile boats don’t match the VNI in the areas you mention above, but the same is true for auto-aggro.
---
tbh, it's the safe approach. 
---
With "normal" null corps you can't know what to expect unless someone you trust tells you that it's actually a newbro friendly corp.  
---
If you are a complete newbro you usually check the in game corp finder and the amount of "new pilot friendly" corps there doesn't really reflect the truth.
---
PLEX only gets cheaper at first from people trying hard to offload it, then as supply goes down prices Spike... This is standard marketing.
---
"nerf"?
---
That wouldn't change anything fit an auto targeted which most do already and press F every 10 seconds.  Bam you have now gotten around the removal of auto aggression congratulations.
---
Lvl 3 missions and t1/2/3 Abyssals are dogshit.
---
There still are some of us solo Tengu pilots left...
---
Yes they do but they honestly arent enough.  In a big fight I want a way for a smaller force to still kill some titans instead of none even if they are outnumbered.  I'm not saying that the larger force wont necessarily win but at least let a smaller group have some chance at killing something.
---
You might want to try joining a more personal corp that has activities for newbros - low tier small gang roams with frigates, etc.
---
I have one phrase for you: "delayed local"
---
Sometimes thier wording sucks.

I see hot pockets as friendly.

I mean, do you even read what you write?
---
While generally is a pretty sound reason for going after Forts, this is not in range of Imperium systems, nor do we have supers/titans to move, or are allied with any group that has supers or titans to move.
---
It's pretty easy to see this bad attempt at spin is full of shit.
---
It does approximately the same damage with blasters and drones as it would ordinarily do with drones, though. How’s it any more OP now than it was?
---
The whole scenario is extremely unlikely as is. No entity I know off currently has the necessary funds to basically bankroll the entire war like before, not even mentioning that this one would be significantly longer.
---
*Realistically* the entire scenario wouldn't happen. It would make the game a 'roided-up version of the Burnout Online it currently is. But if it really had to somehow, an umbrella won't save them. That boson Titan? Dreadbombed on next uncloak. The rorqs trying to keep the economy going? Got a bomber fleet rammed up it's ass.
---
Remember, in a WWB2 type scenario, the only content region in null is delve. There would probably be north (*heh*) of 10 fleets running around there at all times. If you try to employ your umbrella against that, it gets hotdropped before you can screech "retards".
---

Was probably a rather poor attempt at fixing the *too much space, not enough players* problem by condensing space
---
&gt; Fuck risk averse elite pvp garbages
---
Says the one who just typed a paragraph on how elite he is.
---
I agree. People should be hesitant about dropping faction supers and titans on roaming frig gangs. As it stands there is just no real way to escalate to a point that they are even in danger of losing a single one of it turns out to be bait.
---
hey look you now can see who is pressing F every 30 seconds exactly.
---
also it takes away from just afk anom grinding and puts players back to paying attention instead of watching netflix. hey look now its annoying to krab with 20 accounts. less people multiboxing afk krab ships
---
ELI5 to me why this is bad?
---
Making botting require Omega means that bans can actually stick and there's quite a high bar for it being profitable. It's a really good thing.
---
&gt; Heavies are overtuned and need their tracking cut down to the point where they can´t just one-shot untackled ab frigates.
---
They one shot because before they get into orbit range, they'll have really low transversal, so no need for high tracking. If you would nerf the tracking enough that they couldn't hit even at that time, they'd be pretty much useless once in orbit around target.
---
And unlike you 280mm arties, you can't tell your drones to orbit slower, or to keep at range instead.
---
Since I know you didn't contribute in any meaningful way to anything regarding these timers, I'm going to ignore your low quality shitpost and instead offer you a formal invitation to start the "crusade" against my Alliance that you mentioned in i\_general earlier today. We'll be waiting.
---

    I'm all for a crusade to purge Fweddit from low and null.
---
I see lots of hotdrop tengus, not many solo ones. Loki is just so much better because with it’s 25+ km webs, baiting it is practically impossible. 
---
Honestly, just reworking the Loki to not have such long webs would go a long way to balancing t3cs, at least as far as solo/smallgang is concerned.
---
Idk about mass, as you can still chain cynos.  It's not optimal, but it's an easy way around and nothing would change.
---
As I see it, your objection relates to the relative size of dropper and target.  Unfortunately, I see no way to counter that directly as the cyno mechanic has no target at all.
---
They kinda go hand in hand, half the first used to be plaging while waiting for stuff.
---
Tbh, each weapon bonus only buffs half of your weapons.
---
'gain as many skill points as you can'
---
If one wanted to nitpick the English language, if they cap it at 100k, and you get 100k, you did in fact get as many points as you \*can\*.
---
It would have to have been stated 'get as many skill points as you get kills' to be unlimited.  I have a feeling there will be a cap, or... Eve is actually truly finally dead if you can unlimited skill up by killing NPC's.  
---
Now, if the spawns of the SP granting NPC's are like officer spawns in Anoms, then it has a different limit  CCP would have it both ways : It is theoretically unlimited, but you would have to be lucky to find an unlimited number of a spawn limited NPCs.  This could serve as an effective cap.  There will still be salty posts about it either way.  I'll make the popcorn.

You'll have to forgive Sharn, he's never done anything meaningful in the game and despite being in null for I-don't-even-know-how-long still has no idea how citadel warfare actually works.

So, in the sandbox game, play the way Olmeca likes it, not the way you want.
---
I pay my sub, but now I can't do what I want, so you can do what you want.
---
If that’s the case then I feel like I’m using my VNI wrong... Am I not meant to keep an eye on it?
---
Better for you, but only if people play the way you want.  Not really sandboxy, is it.
---
good change 100%
---
Even light drones has problem be fast enought and track usual 5k fast stileto or maled....
---
ELI5? Other than the blackout I have no idea who these people are.
---
FALCON PLS
---
Sure, because the entire game of Eve always gets together to achieve a goal.  It was funded, or it wouldn't have happened.  I love how you claim 100,000 people joined Eve to kill goons.
---
Train all of the drone skills as high as alpha status allows. This is not very much training actually, you are capped at 3 or 4 for most of the skills. These generic skills will help all drones:
---
Drone Avionics
---
Drone Durability
---
Drone Interfacing
---
Drone Navigation
---
Drone Sharpshooting
---
Drones (Drones 5 is a definite requirement for any drone boat and alphas can train it)
---
Generally, Gallente drones (Hobgoblin, Hammerhead, Ogre) have the highest damage and Minmatar drones are the fastest. These are the two most commonly used for PVP, but all four races of drones have advantages and disadvatages and are all used. 
---
For PVE, even though Gallente drones have a higher damage modifier than other races, it is best to use the drone that has the correct damage type for the faction of NPCs you are fighting against. Gallente are Thermal, Caldari are Kinetic, Amarr are EM and Minmatar are Explosive.
---
It’s 1.5 now.
---
I mean, I did whore on the keepstar and was hoping my bait titan would get dropped on. Also, is it any secret I have an aversion to Fweddit sperg and lisp spam?
---
That's a little like a fat kid telling others the race would be more fun if they ran at his speed.
---
You left literally as the kick was coming. Kudos to getting your ass out before the boot hit. Spin however you want, you had literal days left on your lifespan in INIT.
---
i know what you should be doing in game.
---
The problem with Loki is not it's to good, but others too bad
---
&gt; Right! And the majority of the playerbase hasn't opted into it.
---
...yes...so the small complaint you're discussing isn't a major one of those.
---
&gt; No, my point is that killing asset safety is considerably harsher than pre-citadels, as your station getting taken over very rarely (deadzoning was neither common, nor immune to leakage) resulted in losing a larger fraction of your assets/worth than the 15% that goes to the asset safety taxman today.
---
Are you realling running around with so little isk that you can't reasonably easily rebuild? Seriously?
---
If I go full deep in to that how much XP does that leave for other things that I can train in before the Alpha cap hits?
---
My God
---
&gt; The wormhole chains are of ten short as well so your entire argument here is bassically bs.

And your jump freighter networks are even less jumps away.

Rolling a whole is a lot more effort than jumping a gate or setting up a jump freight contract.
---
ah, thats in the last like 2 weeks or so.

Yeah but we engaged. He expected us to be massive pussies like the nullsec entities he usually fights.
---
Shit man, you can have 2 basic Nestor alts up and running in less than 2 months omega and be running c4 sites. A month after that, you can do c5 sites without injectors if you have half a brain
---
It’s the approach I have found work the most over the years. 
---
Nothing against the other corps, but I know Pandemic Horde will help a new player get set.
---
Sure it does - it depends on your mindset and why you're playing this video game.
---
At some point, obsessive and neurotic risk aversion raises the question of: "What are you even playing for?"
---
I play a FPS so I can shoot at get shot at. Sure I'd be winning-er if incremental patches made it infeasible for others to shoot back at me, but then it's not much of a game for me anymore.
---
That doesn't mean there isn't a cap.
---
How many you can is up to 250,000.
---
Then earn as many as you can would be up to 250,000.
---
Guys if you dont do what i say you're a liar....Does this shit actually work on anybody?
---
Why are various corporations so eager to recruit noobs from their first day in Eve? New players don't have and don't know anything, they're no help to anybody, and all they can do is to ask questions and do stupid shit (I, for example, didn't immediately understand what the Overview window was for, and tried to turn my camera to target a tutorial ship shooting me). In other MMOs that I played you had to be well skilled and equipped to join a guild, but in Eve it seems like even a newborn capsuleer is somewhat valuable. Why tho?..
---
I'm a bit rusty, but have you tried an algos fit along these guidelines?:
---
Hulltank,  
---
full brawling (ab,web,scram) mids,  
---
The highest ration of neuts to the smallest Gatling's you can fit (125mm?). 
---
As many ddas as your cpu allows in the lows, fill the rest out with adaptive nano plating or overdrives
---
It worked well for me back in the day
---
It really isnt.
---
When hearing people give advice or when asking for advice, bear in mind who you are asking. Different areas of space have their own finer mechanical points and different people have different areas where they excel. Always have more than one source and be prepared for a lot of "it depends..." answers.
---
That's great man, I'm glad more and more people are being able to play these games more openly these days. A surprising amount of people find difficulty in their relationships in regards to video games, it's very good you found some who is accepting of your hobby.
---
I believe you and I flew together in Waffles briefly during the end of the Kinakka days. If you are the Norman I remember, I'm happy for you and hope to see you in game again man. Waffles will always be #1 in my heart. Fly safe.

Does praise bob serve any other purpose? most of the people on there are absolute brainlets

Thanks for the fun - glad you didn't kill my Rokh too quickly
---
The dude is a CCP dev. Falcon IIRC.
---
It ofc depends on where you are situated in, if you are at the end of a pipe then ye near2 will most likely work. But from what Ive experienced those systems usually dont get hit anyways since its far less risk to catch targets in the outskirts of umbrellas. In lower populated systems.
---
I get why people have an issue with  near2, dont get me wrong. But its not magic, its playerbased input. And most places I lived (and I usually live on the edge on umbrellas) they rarely work as well. WHs open up in empty systems and all of the sudden you have a spike in yours and so on.
---
But like I said, I get the issue. My take on how to make intel weaker is by forcing people to spread out, make so a system that today holds maybe 100 through all TZs only can hold 20. People spread out and umbrellas become weaker, intel becomes weaker (more empty systems in between) and so on.
---
I know i don't lose excavators lol, mine in an porpoise or orca if you cant be arsed to secure your own system in order to deploy a capital level asset you fucking brainlet

A newbord capsuleer can use a web and a scram, so yeah, they can be useful.

I don't know what all of the alpha limits on each skill are but I can roughly estimate maxed out alpha drone skills would be like 500k-800k total SP
---
A one time refund would be nice, either that or at least not have non-alpha skills and levels count to the 5mil SP limit.
---
Not on an alpha account they don't.
---
if you want to know who, just show up for the next timer.
---
ideally with a cyno.
---
I mean sure, it can be powerful. And if enough are against it then sure lets ban it. But, i dislike onesided solutions, you have extremely powerful out of game tools like dotlan and zkill (although zkill can be used for defense as well) right? Shouldnt the principle of mouth to ear also affect that?

Dumbest idea ever. They resemble racial recons' bonuses.

God damn CCP is doing GOOD lately.

What fucking year is it?
---
"delayed mode" is the name of the chat mode they set it to. it functions exactly that way
---
So multiple players working together at the same time for at least dozens of minutes is less effort than doing none of that?
---
You're a strange beast.
---
Especially considering you don't live in wormholes because it's too hard.
---
I'm guessing you don't own any structures, or perhaps haven't lost any.
---
Most recent loss:  Azbel.  Historic losses:  10 Raitaru, 1 Astrahus.
---
I'd like to see a change to Upwell industry rigs, to make them more affordable, as well as requiring fewer structures (bonuses that cover more types, or all types, of industry).  Also, indices are really broken if one person can wreck a system's index.
---
Without such changes, making Upwell suck even more isn't going to get my support.
---
Trigs are 3 Jovian mixed together. They did this to stop the Jovian disease. Watched 2018 eve norths seminar on jovians and the presenter let’s that little juicy bit of info out.
---
I don't see why you're insinuating that these PvP player-types are being dishonest about their desire to have good fights.
---
With local, intel and a dozen other risk mitigation strategies, it was in practice impossible for some average Joe to hunt a ratter/miner.
---
And with nothing to fight over (killing/defending a ratter), people don't fight nearly as much. See the stark difference in action between FW roaming, and null roaming. 
---
That's because null roaming had no skin (ratters/miners) to fight over.
---
Structures in wormholes drop their contents.
---
Ofc I know you dont, otherwise you wouldnt be talking shit. 
---
Well, I feel bad for the human fucking being that sit in them and get their shit bombed without warning. You wanna complain, take it up with CCP. They designed the ship, dont sit here butthurt because people have been flying them according to game design. Thats just stupid dude.
---
Rep bonus
---
Doesn't hurt to watch a few PvP videos but just realize you probably won't be so clear headed and quick as the person in the video right away.
---
Only potential irk I can see with it is that it still has the 200 drone bay.
---
Typically it's Amarr who has the drone bay for multiple full bandwidth flights, not Gallente. 150 or 125 drone bay is what I would have expected.
---
Also odd thought, Gallente and Amarr both have drone boats in most categories; destroyer, cruiser, BC, BS, why not Navy cruiser?
---
Coming back after 777 days exactly since my last kill, so roughly when I went afk, what's the best newbro corps to join these days?

Easy that dumbass deserves it.

Oh, the irony...
---
CCP Falcon and Olmeca 'Make Eve Dangerous Again' Gold, current csm and chad whaler
---
quick nerf nullsec more to make them do this even harder
---
Oh really? But CCP knowing something and we knowing something isnt the same. CCP rarely discloses sensitive data but the login count is public. And they are screwing with that. There is no guarantee that CCP wont use this padding of numbers to argue for no local. There is also no guarantee that they will.
---
In either case, you dont mess with numbers when evaluating things. Its a about being transparent.
---
I don't understand, I've been looking at the VNI traits for about a week while helping my girlfriend skill up into one (she's new to the game) and those traits have been showing in-game for at least a week now. I dont know what the old traits were, I don't fly Gallente, so I was surprised to see these "new" traits are the same ones I've been looking at for a while now. 
---
Did CCP push out the description change before actually changing the traits in game or something?
---
Have a rorq on an alt, never lost an excavator because I know wtf I'm doing lol, it's a numerical fact that rorqs are stupid and have needed their rate of mining nerfed, and the tank nerf was needed, no reason an indy ship should tank like a fax.
---
Tldr suck it up or don't use a rorq
---
They removed the faction-lock from alpha accounts a while ago (2 years?)

Oh my, it's almost as if all 3 of those nullsec blocs have some sort of revenue split agreement concerning the TTT, but still are hostile to one another in every other aspect. Surely that must mean they're all +10 with each other and would never shoot one another outside of this one specific instance of economic truce.
---
Making friends with other player groups is now abusive. Ohhhhhh... I see the mature and thoughtful opinion for what it is now. I'm am simply misinformed as to what constitutes "abuse". Thank you!

Alpha's getting screwed over again and again and again. CCP really needs to rethink what it actually wants to do with the Alpha clone experience. Because as a F2P game (which is how Eve is currently advertised) it's just a horrible experience that feels woefully handicapped.
---
To a level that I can simply not recommend this game to friends or new players, who will typically refuse to pay cash for a retarded subscription model. The Alpha progression is simply too hampered, too much is behind paywalls and Omega is basically blatant P2W.
---
This is what CCP should do IMO:
---
1. **Alpha**: Unlimited free trial mode. At least make Alpha's competitive in *something*  and have full frigate skills and ships unlocked to them.
---
2. **Delta** (new): One-off 40 dollar/euro pay-to-play, can't be bought with PLEX. Forget retarded subscription models, this is what the current gaming generation is typically willing to pay for a PC game. It should unlock all ships and content and skilling time should be double to Alpha. So basically, the current Omega clone.
---
3. **Omega**: Subscription for the hardcore enthusiast. On top of Delta, this mode should unlock unlimited Delta accounts, multi-character progression, multi-boxing, and other non-gameplay stuff to justify the monthly investment.
---
Either something like this or actually going proper F2P: CCP really needs to do something, because the current monetization model simply has too much of a negative impact on the player experience.
---
Once upon a time drones were considered a secondary weapons system. Most ships had no damage bonus to them so they had marginal significance, but got few unique features like auto-targeting.
---
Then droneboats became a thing were really good at drone damage. Though drones were now a fully fledged weapon type they kept their auto-targeting. Much botting and AFK-farming ensued, and CCP has never really dealt with it.
---
instant salt
---
you guys were hard at work hoarding this stuff huh
---
Not for me. The game went into stagnation due to people play the way you want.
---
I am a whaler. I'm better off with more capitals doing PvE.
---
&gt;small complaint you're discussing isn't a major one of those.
---
Is null asset safety a small complaint, or something needing changed to have a major shakeup?
---
&gt;so little isk
---
Ah, k.  My bad for assuming "kristallnachte" might not be arguing in bad faith.
---
Make note of the time and come observe.  Maybe post it here for everyone to pick a side and come help
---
According to you, you built capitals and used it. That's part of proliferation.
---
Well yeah, that explains how we got here but still doesn’t explain why we shouldn’t get rid of it now?
---
You don't fit Olmeca's story, so he doesn't believe you.  haha  Next, he's gonna call you fake news.
---
Just because Eve is a sandbox it doesn't mean it has to constantly cater to to your extremely safe multiboxed PvE playstyle, which is stagnating the game.
---
If you're actively locking targets and controlling the drones, you could be flying something that makes much more isk. The draw for most people in VNIs is that it requires low skills to get into quickly and/or you warp to a site, drop drones, orbit, turn on AB and tank, and go take a shower, walk the dog, or make some hot pockets. The drones will auto-aggressive everything. Easy 15-20M ticks.
---
No. Its more like someone telling you you aren't a special snowflake just because you can afford a Nyx. Tens of thousands of people can. So they should die at those rates.
---
Still takes less people.
---
And that would mostly only be comparable after we then also add in the traveling through hostile chains to the wormhole thing.

Does logic offend you...?

If you have a wife that fully supports your eve/video game habit, you have made a pretty good choice.

Cause the vested interests of AFK-ish players who have used ships that don't need oversight to flood the economy while watching Netflix have been influential at the CSM and loud on the forums. It's plain regulatory capture.
---
&gt;I thought It was spread out between regions already?
---
The high-end moon ore is still regionalized.  Not as tightly as before, but there's stuff you can only mine in the South, and stuff you can only mine in the North.
---
&gt; Is null asset safety a small complaint
---
Is wormholes not having asset safety something keeping swaths of players out of wormholes?
---
Or is the main one the difficulty of wormhole logistics?
---
What a great state this game is in
---
I guess you're actually dense enough to believe that strange narrative.  Step away from the Kool-aid mate and let the adults speak.
---
Just delete EVE tbh
---
Right, so are we in screaming agreement that there is no _valid_ reason to keep auto-aggro around?
---
I’m 50/50 on it, after recently taking a hiatus due to RL things happening which gave me a taste of not being able to login to avoid my assets going into asset safety.
---
At the same time, I find it very obnoxious to bash a structure and have no reward other than the wreck salvage and mods that that *may* drop.

The Tristan is one of my favourite ships and I'm glad that you found another version of it that works. :)

With this, CCP has unquestionably made a thing of beauty. Who can honestly speak against a tribute to absent friends (aside from particularly worthless trolls)? I hope that this monument will be immune to vandalism; EVE may tolerate a lot of things as legit gameplay, but there’s a point where it needs to stop, and this is where the line really needs to be drawn.

&gt;“oh you have to play as an Amarrian mining slave for 3 months before you can fly as us,”
---
I have an extra question.
---
What?
---
So sort of like the original vision for wormholes? You daytrip into holes, then return back to "safety" at the end. Ex, everyone stashes their stuff in Sakht, and daytrip into Delve with whatever they can carry in their ship and maybe a handful of Mobile Depots.
---
Preaching to the choir, but I guarantee someone will scream bloody murder if their ISK faucet is turned off.
---
I'd be fine if some weapon systems were catered for the semi-AFK playstyle, but they should certainly not output anywhere near the same damage as having a human at the keyboard does.
---
you understand that removing drone auto aggression would be the biggest buff to bits the game has ever seen right?

The best advice is to find a group to play with.  Eve is a social game at its core and even if you prefer to play solo having a chat full of people to talk to improves the experience.  
---
Also remember nothing is permanent you will loose ships and die multiple times and no lose cannot be recovered from.  In the long run isk is plentiful sometimes you will be a billionaire sometimes you will be running tech 1 frigates.
---
No, I genuinely don’t. Please explain?
---
I'll never forget the time a buddy and I were frigate-roaming low sec and ran into a battle in progress, we saw what we thought was a Porpoise leaving the fight and engaged - when it got to hull the health just stopped moving.  Damn Battle Porpoise got us, oldest trick in the book.

The thing is I haven’t really gotten that much combat expiernce. Are you guys accepting to people who are still learning some parts of the game?
---
Titans now have a 25% chance to jump instead of bridging even when you click the right option.
---
There are a couple still around and though they are pretty rare these days and none of the remaining ones take it anywhere near the level of making you seriously roleplay 100% of the time.  If anyone told you that roleplaying as a slave for 3 months was a requirement for joining they were trolling you.
---
Tbh auto-aggression on drones is useful for miners. Not because afk but because the need to micromanage targets and long ass lock times to kill little harmless frigates.

ROFL, what a welcoming piece of propaganda!
---
Sure it does. But that can literally be said about anything else right? The point is that training skills for something that might change in the meta cannot be compared to changing a fundamental aspect of the space you live in. Thats a core mechanic change whilst the ECM one if a nerf. Nobody is complaining about nerfs, how many posts have you seen regarding titan, super, fax, rorq and anom nerfs? Not many since most agreed it was needed. Those nerfs can be compared to the ECM nerf.
---
This isnt, I dont count this as a nerf, you havent nerfed NS with this. You have just changed a core mechanic without considering all the other aspects that get affected.
---
Ofc it was intented for intel, what other purpose would it have? You delayed it in WHs for the specific reason of not giving intel. And thats besides the point, it has been used as intel since forever making it a core mechanic.
---
There are a lot of specific issues to NS. Saying that "these advantages come at the cost of no local" is totally disregarding those issues. People joined and stayed in NS based on that ratio of advantages-disadvantages, if you nerf something that ratio gets changed and you can even nerf things to a point where there are more disadvantages and most will stick around since its easier.
---
But changing a core mechanic changes the entire picture, it no longer becomes a question of advantages-disadvantages in that sense, it becomes "do I wanna live in a WH" kind of thing. And thats going way too far. Thats removing a core tenet like Concord in HS or implementing local in WHs or implementing Concord in LS. It changes the picture.

These changes to the VNI is perhaps what's required to deal with the ramjag menace.

It won't touch most other frigs with blasters though.
---
Yeah, I'm sure they have a good system in place to get people started. I just think null has a way of restricting options for a new player that learning in hisec for a bit does not. I think what bothers me is that those newbro wings of big blocs are the default response most of the time. If I'm talking to a potential recruit, I say that the most important thing is that you like the people you've talked to in the prospective Corp. I don't think having an in depth support system for new characters and a bad ass ore calculator is what really gets people logging on. Making friends does that. Eve should be like poker night with the guys except you're in space. If you make friends in the Corp, you'll log on for that even if you don't do much in game that day. I'll take having chill, cool dudes to hang out with over having a good srp program any day.
---
There is probably a cap.  If not the SP bonus per kill will be so low that there might as well be.
---
I spoke in nullsec I see the confusion, make the system capped. Makes the system more competitive, have to remove the enemy cut before you can place your own.
---
Sorry about the truth.
---
I meant in changing game mechanics not post.
---
Lol so cute. I love these "I know because I have it on an alt". I have no fking clue how you use it or even if you have used it. Or even if you are speaking the truth or just lying to try to win an argument you otherwise cant.
---
You are talking about nerfs. Which they needed. Me personally I would say remove excavators all together, Rorq should be a booster that can mine a bit like the porp and the orca. But thats nerfs.
---
This is different. And you cant see it becomes you have feelings on the matter. Stop taking things personally and look at it objectively.

I think it's a mistake to let alpha's use navy heavy drones. I've seen bots use them CONSTANTLY and the amount of time needed to "pay themselves back" is trivial. There really isn't any need for them to be able to use navy heavy drones in pvp either IMO, given how unlikely it would be for an actual alpha to legitimately skill for drone only boats, because they're just not a thing for most alliances in the game.
---
There are a few in my alliance. There's a set rules of engagement and such, and you can't like claim to be an affiliate of say Blood Raiders or Sansha's Nation, or a slaver for instance, but having some character background and IC flavouring helps with the fun. For sure
---
Oh, so some people you can be toxic to?  Is that how this works pubbie mcfuckstick?

It'd be an interesting mechanic, that's for sure.

Fit 20 cheap T1 frigates and have them all horribly blown up in Faction Warfare, while asking the guy who blew you up what you did wrong. There is no faster learning experience than this.
---
New players are important resource for a lot of corporations out there. While as a new player they don't do much, with any luck they will stay until they graduate into bitter vets. Corporations also usually have tax rate, but as a new player your income will not really matter. Sometimes is just nice to chat to the new guy(s) when doing some boring ass stuff as well.   
---
Plus the community just wants to help the new guys out, it's niche game with very limited player base and every player who sticks to the game will make it only bigger and sometimes better.  :)

Your pretty sure is still wrong.

I think its even lower. Someone linked the event on SISI and it was 3 tiers of kills covering a total of 75k which sounds reasonable. Thats like 2m SP for that event which is a shitton.

I agree that a small group is better. I started in such a way and the group was great but I'm not sure that isn't the exception and not the rule. I had a few people who were in there already so I knew that it wouldn't be bad. 
---
On the other hand, you can never know what to expect if you join a random no-name corp. There aren't always people with the patience to explain the basics. Not to mention the occasional scammer corps.
---
I guess I see what you're saying but the creative solutions you're talking about often occur at the planning stage of the doctrine. In high class fights, sometimes entire doctrines are created purely to counter others. There's still a lot of impressive stuff that can be done on the field, but I understand where you're coming from where sometimes the battles decided before the fleets hit the field.
---
can someone please tell me what this red circle is... when there is noise lines start to appear and when i tab out of the page i see a handgun with sounds coming out of it... i have no clue how to disable it and i cant play with it there as its annoying as hell.

This, you're basically doing the end game stuff while skipping the early game experience by joining in the null sec bloc right away. You might make way more ISK by "VNI Ratting" but it certainly isn't the most enjoyable content.

Lots of people are upset in the comments section about ideas and feature suggestions to the tune of "cannot dock supers" and what not. I remember when capital ships were first introduced, quite a few of them couldn't dock and i think you couldn't even take gates with them, in addition to their specialised roles (dreads for POS/structure bashing, carriers to to rep dreads and go after enemy battleships, titans to clear entire grids but at massive risk of losing the ship).
---
Currently we have capitals that can apply damage to frigates with the right fit and skills trained, can go gate to gate, can tether, dock, etc. Basically we get a bunch of ships that are too good at too many things at once, with minimal limitations. But you know what? The majority of the game's lifespan has ran with the harder version of the rules i described above in effect, and people managed just fine. Plus, it also helped with the proliferation issue, because titans were alliance assets and not personal bling-mobiles. If you wanted to fly a titan you got 3-4 other guys together, trained an alt specifically for that and you shared, so if one had to leave the game for a while, another could pick up the mantle.
---
All of this discussions is a perfect example of why it's a bad idea to lower the difficulty curve on complex games just for the sake of it and without deeply thinking the consequences through. Once the risk in a particular area of the game all but evaporates and people flock to it through a natural tendency to min/max, then you can't just take back the "easy mode" features you introduced because people have gotten to used to them and feel that going bad to their previous way of doing things is impossible (but they did just fine a a couple of years ago playing on a harder rule set, which resulted in a healthier meta too).
---
As for asset safety, imagine my surprise coming back to the game as an alpha clone after 12 years and seeing all those leftover ships and modules i had left all around nullsec, sitting cozy in various NPC stations in empire space. I remember a time before even POS were a thing, where we actually did a nightly op to capture back the Z-H2MA refinery station in Immensea and get our stuff out, and it was a brilliant feeling pulling it off.
---
I do agree that dumbing the game down may be tempting in order to help with retention issues and it's true that today's average gamer has much less patience and much more expectation for instant gratification. But back then it wasn't only the different mentality of the average player that helped with retention. It was the fact that newbros could be useful in many ways (there wasn't so much power creep), despite the game being so much harder. How harder? Well, i feel like the majority of the current playerbase would be crying in a fetal position if they had to play by the rules of the time. Just a small example, we had to rat in belts with battleships because there were no anomalies. We also had to mine in battleships (they had the most turret slots) because there were no barges either. Losing a t2 fitted fleet battleship (there were no doctrines back then, only general guidelines, eg "fit a sniper setup" and people knew to bring beams/arty/rails with at least 100km range) would set you back about 200-250 million after insurance. That was almost a month of krabbing to get back.
---
Still, the overall meta of the game was healthier. People undocked, fought and took risks. And instead of dumbing the game down to accommodate new players, the game would ease new players into the whole thing gradually, without compromising its own vision and complexity. How? Well, if you don't need a super at every gate to be effective, newbros can be and feel useful in a lot of situations, they get a sense of achievement and they stick around and keep playing.
---
Can Ancillary Remote Shield Boosters be used on your own ship? I see most "ship fit" posts on reddit mention larger ships using XLASBs. Because of this, I looked the parts up, but it seems this may be only for team play as the description says "Transfers shield power over to the target ship ...", which is not my own. Is this the case? I'd love to boost my own shields by using cap boosters as ammo instead of my cap's energy.

They're an alliance/corporation you can apply to join. EU TZ
---
hahahahahahha holy shit
---
Buuurrrrrrrrrnnnnnnn
---
Oh and don't forget to batphone TEST when you tackled something too big for your britches.
---
Ok, story time. It was the time when Cyvok deliberately ordered an attack on a Shinra hauler to provoke an attack on his own alliance (the long gone Xetic Federation) by the 5 most pvp-oriented corporations of the former Curse Alliance (henceforth known as the 5), just so he could get us all in a war he knew his alliance couldn't win. In reality, Cyvok had a grudge against some of the industrial corps in the alliance and had formed a plan to fracture the alliance by causing a war.
---
He provoked some of the best pvp pilots in the game at the time to come at him, just so he could then turn on his alliance mates and go "all you guys are not pulling your weight, so i'm taking the stronger corps and forming a new alliance". He even shamelessly got blue standings with the same people he provoked into attacking us and just left the frontline regions (mainly Immensea) where the majority of the newly recruited corps had been told to stage, to the wolves.
---
Basically he sold out a couple of regions, all his alliance newbros and his alliance ticker (so the enemy could claim victory through disbandment of their target, something they took great pride on), in order to be able to form Ascendant Frontier (ASCN), sit further back in Feythabolis and Impass, farm and build infrastructure. All that, only to rage quit the game for ever when Band of Brothers killed his titan a couple of years later when he messed up his logoff timers. He had just sent a doomdsay through a jump bridge (yes, silly risk free mechanics existed back then too), and foolishly logged off...an enemy cloaker was in system, got the initial tackle and the first titan kill of the game was against a guy that wasn't even online at the time.
---
BoB were buddies with the 5 and seemingly blue to ASCN too up to that point, but most of the PvP focused groups never viewed ASCN as their equal, and BoB in particular always seemed wary of any big industrial plays being made in null if they were not under their control (that's probably why the went after EvE Uni when they tried to create some kind of a freeport with the mechanics of the time, they couldn't stand a newbro training corp having access to capital shipyards that would cook supers for practically anyone paying the fees). So they just let ASCN build outposts all over and when they thought the prize was ripe for the taking, they annihilated them and took over.
---
My place in all of this? My corp had been accepted into Xetic and moved to nullsec a mere couple of weeks before the war with the 5 started. We had already fought in empire wars before we moved down there, and some of them were against some of the best people at the time, because Xetic was seen as (and probably was too to an extent) a fat, juicy target made up of rich industrialists.
---
So, there's yours truly, a few months old wide-eyed noob, in a t1 fit, 100MN rupture, going head to head with guys from m0o (among them most legendary pirate corps of the time, i think a lot of them later moved to evolution and BoB in general). Our corp was just a few dozen guys at the time (i think less than 30 total, actives were even less), but we decided to keep going out in cheap ships and learn. Once the empire wars were over and we could move safely, we were told to stage in Immensea, right on the frontlines. You could never rat or mine there because of frequent gank runs by hostiles, but that's what got us really into PvP as time progressed.
---
A few days after the war with the 5 started, some people higher up in other corps got wind of Cyvok's plan and were pretty much disgusted (in these days a lot of people took the game quite a bit more seriously and wanted to play with a bit of loyalty and esprit de corps to an extent). The thing with Xetic is that while it had a lot of juicy industrialists, it also had quite a few people who were really interested in PvP.
---
The alliance was mostly peaceful, so a lot of people wanted to farm killmails and loot off of it. Plus, it didn't have too many regular alliance ops or CTAs and the regions had angel rats and arkonor. So it was pretty much a good place to be if you wanted to fund your PvP, do things at your own pace and have people come at you instead of having to look for fights yourself. After a few more days and with Xetic crumbling, these guys all left their original corps joined a new corp called Euphoria Released. My corp and Black Lance also went along with them.
---
From that point on, we had our own little group of misfits, a nice excuse to go after people (the whole betrayal grudge in the war with the 5) and guys who were not afraid to lose a ship or two. This resulted in a nomadic campaign of roaming and harassment (with the occasional attempt to hold space, but we weren't really interested in playing POS and dreadnaught games) for the next couple of years, with varying levels of success (we did know form spy alts that at some point ASCN issued an order to their pilots not to engage some of our guys, because they were being farmed too much and then we'd make fun of them in the forums).
---
This roaming around and having a reason to "in-game hate" people is what bagged us the first ever capital kill in the history of the game (a Moros) followed about a week later by one of the first (if not the first) carrier kills as well that belonged to G alliance (the German guys). That in turn got us an invite into Dusk and Dawn (basically a merger of most German-speaking corps from Xetic with the now disbanded G alliance, they liked how we fought in that carrier battle), which resulted in us fighting the original Goons in Syndicate. I still remember me zipping through about 250 frigs and corvettes in a vagabond i couldn't afford to lose (scariest experience of my eve life, so many webs, lol), and so on and so forth.
---
2 amazing years of back and forth, almost non-stop action, that ended as the nullsec meta went more and more towards a direction of capital ships being mandatory for any kind of strategic effect (you couldn't kill alliances simply by applying pressure to their members anymore or taking their stations, because they could now hide in POS shields) , continuous POS bashing battles that climbed in numbers (and lag followed suit), which resulted in most of our guys gradually quitting the game.
---
But the reason it was possible in the first place? Losing actually meant something. Losing hurt, and it made you spring into action. But you could also bring about an effect on the state of things without needing to have hundreds of the blingiest, most expensive, biggest ships in the game. You just had to be somewhat competent.

It honestly won't tbh. Ramjags are so powerful because of their 20 second invulnerability and their ability to close the distance at such a fast speed with such a small sig. Once the ramjags get on top of you and turn off your MWD, you're are pretty much fucked, even if a peel VNI can get it off of you again relatively quickly.
---
It's still you trying to tell others to play your way, so it's easier for you.  A ship that costs billions of isk shouldn't be as easy a kill as one that costs 100 million.
---
So, someone doesn't agree with your type of play, then they are crying, but if you don't like the game play, it's called what?
---
It would be interesting if non-npc null had the smuggler and regional gates removed.
---
With no gates, it would be an analogue of wormhole space, but with cynos and bridges.  With just some gates, it would be like pockets of space with the odd umbrella overlap.  Roams would have to be done with bridges, or via wormholes.

thats ur capacitor circle glitched into ur hanger lmao

This is honestly the best argument I’ve heard so far. Not saying that it justifies keeping auto-aggro, but I see it’s validity.

Miner Stories...

I would create my own play-lists with the JUKE BOX (fk u CCP)... and every 4 or 5 tracks I would put Miner Stories 3 or 4 times in a row...

Its there when i undock... and whats with the gun and how come its acting as a direction indicator for sound? Haven't played for years and man i hope this is Indeed a bug
---
Still you telling people in a sandbox to play your way.  It just sounds better in your head, when you say it.

yea try logging and re logging. if that dont work put a ticket in mate

Anything that makes ratting easier and require less input benefits a real person.
---
Anything that makes ratting harder and require more input directly hurts a real person, but it makes no difference to a bot.
---
The things that machines do really well are long and complicated strings of inputs that are repetitive - such as super ratting. Super ratting require high levels of player input, is relatively more complicated than VNI ratting, and is far more repetitive. What this means is that typically, real players will fatigue from super ratting far more than something like afk VNI ratting. For the bots however,  it makes absolutely no difference once it's coded in, which is why botting Nyxes are a huge problem, but real people ratting in supers aren't great. 
---
The less repetitive, the less complex something is (i.e., the more afk-able a ratting activity is), the less real players are able to compete with bots.
---
Origin intel bot strikes again

So uninstall reinstall should work?

Okay so its not a feature thank god... just subbed for 3 months and was like wtf i cant play with this shit lol
---

get a new monitor
---
Oooooh thanks
---
I don't know that anyone would "step down" that had the option of capital ratting.
---
However, IMO capital ratting will kill this game if there are viable subcap options.  You're looking at what an 8-12 mo long train for capital ratting give or take?  Maybe a bit less for just ratting, but not hugely so.
---
So you're a new player.  You're going to be told: you can't rat until you've trained for 8-12 months.  Also you should do it on a second account so make sure you do that. Good luck with your search for an income source!  I hope you liking mining!
---
(this is somewhat deliberate hyperbole, I know there are other options for isk making, but ratting is the defacto combat based money making style)
---
They need to make defense function on drones more reliable. Because sometimes it is annoying to watch how your drones are casually hanging around while your ship is being attacked. While long range auto aggression should be limited.

It’s an old name from back in my aol days, I liked gem dragons in dnd because of their neutral alignment, way nerdier than you thought right ;)
---
Let me show you the reality of the situation, excluding everyone but the primary defender (Free Range Chikuns) and primary aggressors (INIT. + Snuff)
---
Defenders:
---
My alliance, Free Range Chikuns: 185 Pilots
---
Aggressors: 
---
Snuffed Out:  1373 Pilots
---
The Initiative./IM:  4963 +  1079 =  6042 Pilots
---
The aggressors are literally 32x our size. They can easily form 3-6x our numbers, without calling strategic fleets, and before batphones. Now I'll give you the benefit of doubt and assume you've never FC'd more than 20 guys and never been in a leadership position in an alliance. Do you think we would ever be able to take a fight against them without calling at least some allies? What would you do if you were in my situation?
---
Another option suggested elsewhere could work too, which is to limit auto-aggro to a special class of (light) drones. That way you directly trade auto-aggro with light dps vs manual-aggro with full dps.
---
I’m stunned that I didn’t get that 😿
---
    I sit here in this pleasure dome, since the blackout it has become my home
---
    refusing to leave for crippling fear, the realisation produced a tear
---
    never risking my precious boat, a pathetic excuse for an old cut-throat.
---
    
---
    I resolve myself to prove my worth, and restore my most shrunken girth
---
    I jump to a forgotten Bantam, and try my hand at a Jita scam
---
    producing a most wicked contract, hold on -- wait -- how do I retract?!
---
    Fleeing the system targeted by jeer, drowning the loss in low-carb beer
---
    feeling the most common fool, pondering how to restore my ISK pool
---
    with the need to have my guns layed bare, I try my hand at faction warfare.
---
    The experience feels most tepid, gone the feeling that was once intrepid
---
    a feature now most dilapidated, so much potential to be extrapolated
---
    refusing to end the day most dull, I swallow my fears and go back Null.
---
    D-Scan skills being far from focal, I find myself jumped by a wormhole local
---
    in a ship now armed to the teeth, soon to be sending his family a wreath
---
    the bitter battle ends in his defeat, at last I feel most complete.
---
    The excitement leaves me most vocal, about the wonders of a lack of local
---
    ignoring those that seem so glum, sharing my hope of things to come
---
    finding myself glad to be back-out, a new appreciation for this Black-out.
---
this is really all an elaborate scheme to announce that eve online is kill and eve 2 is ascendant

yup

what do you think the free SP login event is for?

LMFAO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Join Karmafleet, good place to learn and have fun. And im actually serious.

Cringe
---
In my 10 years of playing Eve Online, I've never seen that.
---
Block monkey here, i love the blackout, hope ccp goes after anom respawns next
---
17 sub channel and 17 comments perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
Yeah Cynoing is too cheap and too easy.  
---
Cyno ships should be limited to certain ships.  Say Recons, T3 with certain subsystems, electronic attack ships.  
---
Currently allowing cynos to be fit to any ship is the equivalent of allowing boosh modules on any ship.  Doesn't make sense that a module so powerful can be on anything.
---
Kills PvP either by discouraging attacks on suspect ships or screwing over fights that engage by magically teleporting a fleet systems away for 500k isk.
---
Could you dm me some of those corps? That sounds really interesting and i might join.
---
Single account gamers get out
---
I mean, if you enjoy flying a VNI, then by all means, don't stop. You don't have to be optimal all the time.
---
I’m sure Mittens thanks you for boosting traffic to fuel his multi-dollar media empire.
---
Bout tree fiddy.
---
Never seen that before and at first I could barely watch due to the cringe but I'm so glad I watched the whole thing that was brilliant
---
&gt; Aggressors:
---
&gt; Snuffed Out: 1373 Pilots
---
&gt; The Initiative./IM: 4963 + 1079 = 6042 Pilots
---
I prefer trading between hubs, when my stuff doesn’t get shot to oblivion. (No one told me the system I was jumping into was consistently camped... was an interesting moment when I saw local light up with all reds 😿)
---
Could be a directional sound indicator from some app on your pc that is meant for first person shooters. I have never seen it though.
---
There are a few ways, but in order to do so, many things are left vague or unexplained. Just saying along the lines of, it's a sandbox game where you can pursue PvP or PvE combat, industry, economics, exploration, or about anything you can think of, provided you have the capital/means to do so.
---
Fair points; thanks for explaining.
---
That's my secret. I'm high ALL the time.
---
Maybe it could make your modules randomly set each other off, like scrambling the ships internal computer
---
If its capped, then you can prevent hostile entities from anchoring a citadel in your space.
---
Because its not like you guys have a history of blobbing and dropping titans to win your fights right?
---
&gt;ideally with a cyno
---
I'm pretty sure that this is how a lot of ships get to Tama.
---
I feel like Eve Online music is just elevator music for sociopaths.

you are a fucking saint! okay so i have an asus motherbord and apparently it comes with sonic suite 2 that has a feature called "sonic Radar" automatically turned on...

Funny thing i have had this computer for 3 years but i do not play FPS so thats jokes this is the first time i ran into this...
---
again THANK YOU SO MUCH!
---
&gt;my wife gets cancer and I afk. 
---
Bro I think you need to take a moment and think about what you’re saying here. For your own sake I truly hope internet spaceships would be the last thing on your mind if you ever were to be in this situation.
---
I have! I don't know how I missed that. Thanks! This is much more preferable than the regular booster imo.

Ah so because you got blobbed for a while, everyone else deserves the same?

Hey man :)
---
There are a lot of roleplay corps around, some more hardcore than others. 
---
They range from groups like PIE Inc. who are 100% IC, only fly Amarrian ships, etc, through to groups like Phoenix Naval Squadron who are basically a normal lowsec PvP corp but with a lot of casual roleplayers in their membership.

&gt; Oh really? But CCP knowing something and we knowing something isnt the same. CCP rarely discloses sensitive data but the login count is public. And they are screwing with that. There is no guarantee that CCP wont use this padding of numbers to argue for no local. There is also no guarantee that they will.
---
So you made up the 1% number and had no real data to base that information on then.
---
&gt; In either case, you dont mess with numbers when evaluating things. Its a about being transparent.
---
They are not messing with the numbers.  You trying to infer information from data based on incorrect assumptions about how login numbers work is not them messing with the data.  It's a problem with your math and reasoning skills.  It is you trying to determine things that you can't possibly determine with the information given.
---
&gt; Its a about being transparent.
---
If they wanted to be transparent they would publish the data publicly which they do.  It doesn't have to be back engineered from the login data which you can't do anyway.
---
TLDR:  Stop being a twat.
---
Are you stupid or just plain retarded? Just curious...
---
He doesn't change game mechanics, though.
---
CCP wins.......the end.
---
I love all of this

That was just a great old fashioned brawl, thoroughly enjoyed myself and some good fights coming out of high-sec content after all. Actually managed not to die in the [fire](https://i.imgur.com/Rmv0OTg.png).

GF!

Im surprised that the isk value for bounties are going up.
---
So reading thru all of your sperg here, I can only conclude that you're STK Scientific's version of KiloAlpha.
---
Im surprised that the bounty value has gone up!
---
There's a gigantic export from Cloud Ring, you may have noticed.

The 10-year-anniversary concert by the Iceland Symphony Orchestra was fan-tas-tic.

I was in the room for the occasion, one of the most magical moments of my life.

Nope, never heard it.  Can you explain?
---
I'll admit frigates fare a little better but anything without a mwd sig reduction bonus still gets clapped unless you have heavy logi, so yeah that's still a problem.
---
It's a shame that I don't know you, value your opinion or give credit to anything you say. Based on your post history, I would be most likely to conclude your judgement is usually impaired and prone to throwing shit out there and hoping it sticks. Good luck with that.
---
Cool artwork. :smugdon:
---
No shit Sherlock.  This is my case for asset safety.  Cause I sure as fuck am not gonna be logged in to this
---
1v1 me at the sun to confirm this
---
that'd be a better question to ask to the guy who thinks snuffed out has 1300 pilots waiting to drop on their dumb little fort.
---
he straight up admits he batphoned. which is fine. but he doesn't discuss how big previous batphones were. we reinforced that fort a few times before, ya know.
---
You dont need to know me or value my opinion at all. Still wont change you from being some spergy nerd equivalent to another spergy nerd.
---
Hey mate, tell us what got you into this game and maybe we can point you in a direction for the content your interested in
---
Enjoy your two slices. Mmm mmm
---
why would anyone be against the removal of an instant flawless ability to know who is and who isn't able to attack you?
---
hmmmmmmmmmm
---
P sure Fweddit and Fwiends is still collectively smaller than what Snuff and Init can muster, which is the point of his post, all be it a tad disingenuous with the exact numbers.
---
Happy cake day mouth breather
---
Someone already did it there’s something somewhere on google but I believe the dude dropped like 5-10 grand with the pled being at a all time high for selling to isk.

&gt;Adapt or die.
---
that's fine, if the result of people adapting is a good thing for the game.
---
if you think more supers, and less people undocked and active in null is a good end-game, then have at it.
---
&gt; P sure Fweddit and Fwiends is still collectively smaller than what Snuff and Init can muster,
---
thus the batphones previously, and why the final timer numbers on our side was so high.
---
Wait eve have sound?
---
Having actually read it, I don't disagree that eve has bigger problems. Also talk about dealing with super proliferation including nuking them altogether is pretty radical. Doesn't fit into the rhetoric here though. Shame the writer didn't proof read for mistakes either. Bring on the down votes but I take the article as a good one.
---
...and what presence did those things have in-game before when they instantly warped off?

---
A spaceport can hold exactly 100 units of P4, so it's theoretically possible if you put half your of P4 factory output to one spaceport and half to the other.  The big thing you need to watch out for is that your products are possibly bigger than your inputs, so you need to make sure not to overfill your spaceports.  I'd recommend back-calculating the number of inputs needed for a nice round number of cycles (probably less than the maximum runtime to perfectly fill it... 25 cycles is probably a good target to give you room for access jitter) and sticking that in a note to yourself somewhere.  Then, only put exactly that much in at a time.
---
Basically, you need to figure out whether you are input or output constrained and limit things accordingly.
---
Alpha’s don’t pay for the game; I’d say they get plenty of value for the amount of cash they’re putting down.
---
It was over $20k actually.
---
Yes, and we predicted (correctly) that your side would batphone hard, and however strong that was going to end up being, was going to be significantly more than our batphone *even if we batphone our entire phonebook*.
---
You may not be able to grasp this concept, but this is not Fweddit's first rodeo in this type of situation, and we understand how to game it. You have to carefully plan who you call, when you call them, and for what timers.
---
No, they'll probably just quit, adding to that "retention" metric, because this is CCP effectively stealing for anyone who bought alpha injectors to get skills that are suddenly disabled.  You can't do stuff like this without reimbursing the SP, since alphas are limited; it would be like a F2P in a traditional MMO getting retroactively capped at 55 when the level cap is 60 just because they specialized in trees the dev decides are OP later.
---
This is actually easy to explain. You can hide dread bombs easier and in range of super umbrellas. You can use spy alts to build dreads in range and ceptor you pilots to an off scan safe to get in them. It's actually pretty easy to pull off. Give it a few more weeks. Super umbrellas will start to suffer losses.
---
Mmm.
---
Salt.
---
*Delicious*.
---
Except you can't because they aren't refunding SP.  Since there's a number cap, any alphas who trained the skills they're removing just got boned.
---
Do u guys know I can request ccp to pull sp out of drone interface 4 and allow me to skill into other stuff since I just wasted the last week doing it as an alpha......
---
Yeah, objectively rorqs dont need any more buffs, losing excavators is on the pilot. If you're mining in the same place all the time, that's how you end up with bombers waiting for you, regardless of local. Log on traps are easy. You don't have a leg to stand on, because no industrial ship is high sp requirement if you just balls out only go for that, plus the huge amount of players with caps or that literally have to train into caps (thanks mittens) all have the jump skills already (the longest training factor) so what's you're point?  
---
The only limitation to having a rorq and not is if you can afford it, and in that case no one gives a shit about your excavators
---
dreadbombs were never killing super umbrellas. they won't magically start to because your name doesn't appear in local any more.
---
Ok
---
If its like previous events it will work similar to "daily challenges" in other games where completing the task starts an X hr countdown until a new one is available.
---
In some previous Agency events some of the tasks had tiers and granted a point reward for each completed tier (with points going to a reward payout meter). Once you completed the final task in the chain you then had a wait of maybe 10-20 hours before a new challenge would appear.
---
All this is to say "There could be no explicit hard cap on SP gains, but the nature of the system might impose a cap"
---
&gt; It's an old political saying that basically means, if you cant simplify things then you are most likely lying.
---
That's what a politician would say.
---
I'm offended you brought Leonard Nemoy into this!    
---
for me, no more asset safe in null seX... 
---
You might want to read that article again. Because let’s face it IronBank is a joke. Stromgren bought $7k worth of skill injectors VALUED between $21k-$28k. IronBank(who was permabanned for illegal RMT in game through iwantisk) spent $28k worth of skill injectors to do it and he didn’t use a single  penny to do it. It was Stromgren who did it for a First to blow $7k real life money through CCP’s website.
---
Awesome video mate. Love the editing and how you put it together. Big ups.
---
im gay
---
And of course the more SP you have, the less affective they are.
---
You get what you pay for.
---
Three WHOLE dollars
---
What do you mean by that? Arent SPs just a number that gets bigger as you train?
---
&gt; I don't disagree that eve has bigger problems. 
---
that whataboutism though.
---
You are probably right, and they will buy plex to replace those loses and that may be what CCP is baking on.
---
Not everyone can pay a constant sub fee for games lol
---
OMG it would be hilarious to do to bots
---
Adding randomized times to press F can be written in 3 lines of code so them looking at timing wouldn't be a reliable way to catch them.
---
I also don't advocate for blanket changes ever that affect everyone's playstyle because of what a subset of people are doing.  Drones auto aggression is a good counter to damps since the drones will hit the target using them even if you cant lock them.
---
&gt; Anyway, I'm looking forward to hunting slow ass myrms and domis 
---
They can also both easily fit a cyno, which the VNI had trouble with in most cases.
---
Best of luck!
---
Kinda shitty man.
---
Debuff is called a nerf.
---
Thanks, I’ll look into it!

According to [this source](https://massivelyop.com/2016/02/15/eve-player-uses-28000-of-skill-injectors-to-create-max-character/), as of February 2016 there were in total 473,344,000 total skillpoints to train. Since injectors' diminishing returns are only based on the number of SP you have injected and aren't related to the amount of SP you have saved, we can divide that number by 500,000 to get 946.6, or 947 injectors needed to inject everything to V. The current average going rate for injectors is 1,013,920,397.54 ISK, so that amount would cost a little over 960Bn ISK. That comes out to 219,912 PLEX, or about $7,140.
---
It's worth noting that these back of the envelope calculations are somewhat lowballing it, since if you tried doing this it's very likely you'd crash both the PLEX and injector markets, with pretty large side effects related to that. You're looking at buying 33.7% of the injector market and selling 46.1% of the PLEX market. Needless to say, this is probably something you shouldn't do.
