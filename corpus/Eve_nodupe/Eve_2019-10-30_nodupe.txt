This is missing an extra carrier some TRC boys caught on the Y-M gate in D61A, just a bunch of subcaps tackled and burned it down.

It's called "other people."

You can also add gh0st#5614 if you’d like. I’m graveyard USTZ (so basically AUTZ) and wouldn’t mind giving you some pointers or roam around in cheap stuff with ya

The active FW corps are a ton of fun to fly with. Just chiming in to also recommend FW.
---
whoa dame death is still around?
---
"Noting the success of Azure Lane, we have instructed CCP and their art department to begin immediate addition and implementation of scantily dressed female ship avatars and their use in the game. Ship skins will be changed for clothing outfit changes with matching ship colors."
---
There's huge difference between doing PvE as way to fund your PvP and game being PvE with PvP elements. Game with PvP elements is almost every MMO out there, even world of warcraft is just that. EVE was designed with PvP as primary goal hovever and every mechanic leads to it.

Stop sniffing goon propaganda my friend they lie for their own agenda

Nice shitfit. The tooltip may be iffy but not as iffy as a blaster lachesis.

What are the burst jammers for?

Something they actually talked about specifically. I think in the QnA? The idea behind the unified start area was to push the racial decision out of a check box on the login screen, and instead make it a decision inside the tutorial that..instead of going to career agents that didn't really match their name, theme or anything else. They would be tied directly into helping the cause you decide is important. This leading you down the path of supporting and flying with an Empire. Maybe leading you into Faction Warfare or some other direct tie in to the specific Empires. Might of been at a bar, but pretty sure it was in one of the recorded sessions. But in general, yea, they agree, and they are trying to come up with ways to change the order of what you do so that at the end you have a path forward and an Identity.
---
To be fair, you can damp and point from farther away than a keres...gotta go FAST bro
---
CCP directly said structures. But...k.
---
Someone doesn't know how wormholes work.
---
Somewhere, the dev that created the AT toolset is getting 900 slack pings...
---
Why not both?
---
Yeah usually i would count myself to the more positive type of ppl but whats the point in hiding or even faking stuff :x
---
If you find this let me know. I've been looking for the same thing and seem to have trouble finding my niche in these types of games. Dadcorp is like the perfect word for it.
---
I think the problem really resides in what you believe the problem is. One of the stats they quoted was something like 5k (population of some town in iceland) new people try the game every week. Before they started their recent efforts on the New player stuff, &lt;10% would complete their first hour of game play. Since their changes, they have gotten that above 30%. That's a staggering improvement. Sure...they have a long ways to go, but knowing those numbers, and hearing what they are working on to try and get that first hour number higher while also being mindful of getting them past hour 10...
---
I'm absolutely optimistic.
---
Hit me up on discord.
---
You are now florida man

&gt;significantly, if it was slight you wouldn't see a 95%+ decrease in freighters ganked.

Now think about the Loki, the tall girl whose glimpses stop all your movement while she decides what to do with you.

If is for mine, checlk channale "Coalition for independent miners" in Tas-Murkon, for refine is Better one citadel in DITAL
---
Oof. Never heard of 'em.
---
Nice.
---
Is this how you can tell that people are losing faith in the game? The traditions that we have handed down for generations of alts... all gone.
---
Coming if this were still 2018. Learn to read dates
---
Can confirm. Dictator Matterall has gone power hungry and lost all sense of neutrality. TiS is now officially a CCP White Knight militia.
---
oh, right - I thought they'd snuck the inty changes in very seamlessly...lol
---
fap fap fap fap pando tears
---
&gt;Mittens has a long history of disservice to the game latest of which connecting being chaos era to hilmars bonuses.
---
Anyone with a brain made that connectionall on their own, blaming mittens is naive and ignorant
---
What did you say?
---
Let's be honest, the EVE Discord sucks
---
yea that was the yearly sub which I spread every 3 months to keep it reasonable, but last year I asked myself why was I spending 139 dollars per year per account for this game, was I enjoying the game or did it feel like a second job. Honestly the grind got to be too much and the RNG nature of abyssal deadspace felt like a gimmick to me.  
---
my money is going to other things now like paying down my credit cards and final fantasy 14 which is 59.99 for the complete edition which gives core game and all expansions plus one month game time and only charges a monthly subscription of 15.99 which is still freaking cheaper than eve for 25X the content. Just would be nice if square enix made a space mmo with yoshi P being the lead on it. I'd sign up tomorrow.
---
... on his private chat server
---
as the resident expert in hurricanes and the response to.... highly disruptive, Chaos, and disastrous results the shoe fits and the criticism of Hilmar's recent actions is valid. the funny thing is mittani has a positive outlook for the future.
---
I said something that may have not needed as much profanity as it did but I didn't actually ascribe those words to CCP. The fact White Knight Materall banned Mittens though is absolutely absurd.
---
Pretty sure mittens doesn’t need any help maintaining his alliance. As long as more people is better than less people, and more ships are better than fewer ships, no one will be able to stop goons in the foreseeable future
---
What brand of tin foil do you prefer?
---
I mean, CCP just recently wasted time on these tooltips, why even bother wasting the dev time if half of them aren't accurate?  All it does is confuse new players.
---
&gt;Negative propaganda bad, positive propaganda good
---
classic normies
---
Just because you're being "positive" doesn't mean you're being constructive.
---
Quite the opposite, actually.
---
But what was it? Surely you at least vaguely remember
---
I AM HEALED
---
&gt;I won't keep arguing. If you lacked the reasoning capabilities back then to understand the above, you would lack them right now too.
---
Classic olmeca, through out some insults after inventing a non-existent version of history to make sure no one pays attention to the person pointing out your full of it.
---
I said something along the lines of "If CCP had deleted warp stabs completely from the game I would have been like are you fucking retarded but thankfully they didn't" Swearing of any kind seems to earn you a mute.
---
Is there anywhere to get these in just audio form?
---
Ya, but then those people that live there, they'll kill you. Isn't that the point of living in null? I dont know, I'm a wormholer...
---
Source?
---
Oh shit you're right. I meant Karen. Look at me, mixing up the misogony.
---
In other words you were being edgy and that was not appreciated. Moving on.
---
Without tour base of audience you are nothing though. He's losing patrons, subscribers over his actions since his failed election - his lashing out in the most irritating of passive aggressive ways.
---
The one word per line style is super fucking obnoxious. I don't blame them.
---
Write a complete thought at a time.
---
Reading your text I dont think eve is what you are looking for. You want an entertaining park that throws interesting content right in your doorstep to enjoy. 
---
While that can happen sometimes its not the rule. In eve you have to build your own story. Also a single week or two doesnt give you any meaningful skills and you most likely put the extra points into the wrong skills. So you will hate pvp getting shot down all the time.
---
I suggest you try find another game. The outer worlds is a way better Fallout New Vegas. MMO space games are otherwise sadly a bit crappy.
---
&gt; Mittani used exactly that
---
Bullshit.  Mittani's spewing the same propaganda line he's been spouting for months.  All he's interested in saying is that anything he doesn't like is suicide for CCP.  That's his narrative, and every Goon is sticking to it.
---
We really don't need to hear it again.
---
Thank you Matterall
---
Long overdue imho
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
People always bash CCP if they do or don't do something that is slightly controversial. Everything that is good, even when everyone bashed them for that, noone appreciates it. And when they do something everyone asked for for years, and it turns out badly, it is still CCPs fault... This is why I hate most peoples opinions, they are neither well thought through nor consistent or honest.
---
we are not talking about CCP, aren't we?
---
Not exactly my fitting, the owner linked the image in one of EVE channels and I thought I might post it on reddit. Still, seems like a decent solo-hunting fit.
---
if you just walk up to hillmar, he speaks to pretty much anyone.
---
i've done it several times. he's a nice enough person no matter what you think about his choices relating to eve.
---
[nice try bro](https://i.imgur.com/tqYEex5.png)
---
He may lose people. That is a different issue.
---
People join a “private” Discord for a service he offers on a game he loves, free of charge. This does mean that he can set the boundaries for his community. That is his right and has nothing to do with freedom of speech.
---
As an analogy:
---
If you are a fiercely pro- or anti-Trump person, it is perfectly fine to voice that. But if I am on my server dedicated to something else I sure as hell do not want you to bring that drama into that space. So I set rules to prevent it and people can choose to be there and follow those rules, or to not agree and leave.
---
Now if he would persecute you for the words you say, then the argument of free speech may hold.
---
Yes you can speak freely. But when you are in someone's house, you follow the house rules.
---
This is already becoming a reality. Check out China's social rating stuff.
---
Lol no it wasn't
---
Then leave his discord server? Things like this usually work their way out. People with a brain and critical thinking will move on, soon it will be a discord of only those who prefer to drink the kool aid. 
---
I don’t disagree with him setting ground rules for his private discord server however he sees fit. But it’s also in his best interest to not be overly heavy handed with moderation or ultimately he’s just self-sabotaging what he’s built.
---
Wow well you got it all figured out old man. Have fun o7
---
Boosts have always effected the booster itself, but with the changes from links to bursts, you don´t have to be in a fleet to be able to boost yourself
---
I don’t know if that’s true ^^
---
You seem confused. Nobody said he can't make up whatever rules he wants. That doesn't mean that banning criticism of CCP isn't censorship.
---
And he didn't build the community. The community built the community. He simply maintained a platform for that community to meet, until now, when he decided he wants to control how that community thinks and speaks.
---
That doesn't mean it's not censorship.
---
Ignoring the censorship doesn't make the censorship go away.
---
Thanks, little man. You have fun, too!
---
God Bless.
---
I don't understand can you explain more.
---
Kiddo... lmao 
---
But again, if the community leader becomes a tyrant, people are free to reform the community elsewhere (e.g. start your ownTalking In Stations Uncensored discord). But he’s also free to dictate some boundaries on conversation in his server. He doesn’t owe your entitled ass a damn thing. Get off your censorship soapbox, this isn’t it. Basically everyone in this thread shitting on your argument should give you enough pause to reevaluate your position here.
---
Good, that part of TIS annoyed me. I tried to block it or configure the settings and it never seemed to work.
---
Pop under like the ship tree is my favorite horrible display option
---
Lachesis also gets a bonus to hybrid turrets so like.... what?
---
Yea you are ignoring tons of factors and the fits are shit.
---
What? Idk what you smoking but I want some
---
I think the bottom line is that he needs to create a positive echo chamber so that he can keep CCP coming back on.
---
You seem confused because you're addressing words I haven't said, not because you aren't addressing words I have said.
---
This entire reply, for example, seems to be addressing an argument against rules in general that I've never made. I have no clue who you're arguing with.
---
With some grillz on them teeth
---
Haha yes
---
Thoroughly one of the most toxic people I've had the misfortune of meeting in EVE.
---
Materall and TIS are a beacon of how news outlets should be. Being overly pessimistic and judgemental based on no facts at all is bad for anyones mood and chases away players like nothing ccp could ever do. The whole lets burn ccp at the stake for ruining my life has been around way to long and it cannot be gone soon enough. You will see a steep rise in player count go hand in hand with that, you mark my tinfoil wrapped pointy finger.
---
@ccp: For the love of god stop listening to players, they know not what they want.
---
To be fair I did see mention of faction warfare and when I went to join it, the message told me I would have to leave my corporation to do, the one I just joined to learn how to play the game - so I didn't join. 
---
Seems like a barrier to PVP that shouldn't be there? Maybe my experience would have been totally different if I could have stayed in my corporation yet enabled the FW elements.
---
I did give it a go tonight, I even found a fleet that had 12 people in it from a corp that let me in. In the time I was with them we spent about 2 hours flying around capping bases that took anywhere from 5-15 mins and didn't see a soul, though apparently we were in a highly contested area, had two fights and ganked a miner (which took about 2 mins total). 
---
To top it off the capping sites had NPC's - like.. are you kidding me, isn't this a PVP mode?
---
Don't be condescending, I'm not a child, I don't need to be 'spoon-fed', what I do need though is to actually get value for $15 USD a month and I don't see the value. 
---
You can say something snarky etc. about how Eve isn't the game for me and that's fine, as  I said this post isn't directed at you, if CCP ever wants to have 3 million players instead of 30,000 they need to hear why paying customers like me don't hang around - which is the entire point of my post.
---
Oracle &lt;3
---
Yeah that's cool, I honestly don't expect anything from the post and/or changes.
---
I will most likely move on, I just wanted to leave them feedback though to help them understand why I was not a retained customer.
---
They are adding LP to the Wallet? Instead of agency? What the fuck are they thinking...
---
No wrongthink allowed.
---
it opened for me while using ublock and noscript, I might have temp allowed scripts to run on no script. I use Waterfox.
---
Short answer - Wormholes
---
Looks like one of the aliens from the alien movies
---
i wish it was like this, the real problem is they try to please too many of you idiots. They should just develop the features they want and tell everyone else to like it or leave it.
---
i think your assumption is wrong; it's very likely not a line in a DB change.
---
What about the Jaguar?
---
Are they flying and kiting you? Kiting is the counter to brawling so it's normal they beat you. You need to change your fitting to be a kiter or scram kiter to beat them.
---
that's horrible advice.
---
its also an orca...
---
&gt; Never understood this forced positivity thing from anyone let alone eve
---
Materall comes from LA marketing, forced positivity and a public and private position has always been his thing.
---
Who is this shill. And why should I give two fucks what he thinks? Leave his channel. Ignore him. Never view anything he says or does. Fading into obscurity is the worst kind of punishment for these types of people.
---
Prepare the defenses milord
---
Why not tuck it into the Gathering of the Juggalo's?
---
that /s was unnecessary
---
More to the point: this is r/Eve
---
No, but it is. That's how Hoboleaks is able to identify these changes.
---
ARMORRRRRRSLOW.
---
u don't get the ''miningships are underrated'' joke didn't u ?
---
I feel like nobody else did either.
---
If you want to fight using Hybrid weapons (uses the same skill as Blasters for T1 weapons), you can use railguns which have longer range. Blasters are not great because of their short range so you need to waste time traveling to the different spawns.
---
Drones and missiles are typically used because of their selectable damage type and decent range + drones have great applicability so you can even use Heavy drones against frigates, while all other larger damage types have more trouble.
---
If you're not using a drone boat, you want a ship that can launch light drones (most battleships can do this) and send them against enemy frigates. Focus your main weapon on cruisers+, your light drones will take care of frigates and destroyers.
---
+1 for leaving, it's better to jump ship now than stay for the inevitable crash upon the rocks. It was a good show while it lasted.
---
I agree to theres a line for moderation, but this isn't it. again the PA investors call isn't pushing a narrative though, its a fact showing the profitability of the company. That's wholely in the scope of reasonable responsible argument and entirely newsworthy to the community. Now we don't need to shit on them for the results but we should cover the results good or bad.
---
sry i was tired of answering guys like you \^\^
---
Seems ashterothi finally got tired of people not taking the nonsense he spouts as gospel.
---
Listen to this man!
---
Really this event could have been so much fun
---
It should be 100% or 0%
---
**trick or treat** \- not treat or treat
---
So how much did  CCP pay to buy your ethics? 2$? 3?
---
I can point at the time-stamp when owning and using Dread became a thing in Proviblock in its latest incarnation, I can also point at when Super ownership started in earnest. 
---
And I know that Provi lacks balls, the pilots lacks balls - don’t log-in when called, FC’s lacks balls - never the right time or numbers, CEO’s lacks balls - not shouting at its members to support. 
---
And I know with fairly good accuracy how many Supers could be dropped on average day (or was this spring)
---
Yeah this is forever imprinted on my mind
---
I just use Hoboleaks as patchnotes ;)
---
Alien
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck.   Can’t unsee.
---
DELETE THIS
---
Nothing, it's a good way out when you're done with the game and want to "cash out"
---
How else will they flex their internet space guns
---
Great argument that their balance team shouldn't do the job they are set because they're doing something that isn't their job??
---
I've never understood the argument that items dying in ships is RMT.  Not only is it RNG but it assumes that CCP can't track inventory between players which we know is false because that's been the source of bans in the past.  
---
Always bet on stupid (or KB padding in the case of 100% loot drops)
---
This is communism not democracy you plebs. Get in line with the party or gulag awaits you!
---
The Lachesis makes no sense.
---
The idea is that they can't easily determine the intent.
---
Was the person that looted a buyer or a random passerby?
---
&gt;Freedom of speech is a rule on the government
---
That's the 1st Amendment, not free speech. Free speech, as written in Article 19 of the Declaration of Human Rights, is meant to be far more open.
---
Yes i already plan on that. Tagging doesn't currently affect stats though
---
Ive played for almost 3 years and I still learn shit every day. Another nice tidbit is if you double click on any of your overview windows at top I.e. chats or Dscan they will minimize without closing.
---
Most likely a mobile game in VR.
---
They're just powertripping. They still have their little bot linking everything that gets posted on r/eve, so they're being disingenuous when they say that they're trying to avoid the toxicity of our subreddit.
---
Context or not it will be argued both ways, both are right too.
---
Here, I'm going to sell you this PLEX.  50/50 shot you get it.
---
Good luck
---
same.
---
That's just called Eve Online.
---
fucking retarded fucking
---
I try to operate on a policy of expecting everything I put out there, even in private, to come out at some point. The message shown here does not appear to be an airing of dirty laundry to me.
---
There are places for full-on free-speech, where less moderation is present, where the tone can be louder to one's taste, where one can even purely act out their emotional response to something, with whatever consequences will naturally follow - constructive, destructive, groupthink, ad-hominem, whatever. Use those spaces for those things.
---
The Talking in Stations organization, however,  maintains a trusted constructive talkspace - not a free-for-all. Criticism in the interest of improvement is a required component of a successful constructive system, and is therefore always welcome. It is when tone shifts that moderation occurs. The reasons for such a decision are multitude, not the least of which being the fact that this has gained them ongoing involvement with and access to key CCP personnel.
---
I for one implicitly trust the direction Matterall takes to ensure that this tone is preserved, and I think that this screenshot does nothing but strengthen the image TiS wishes to convey.
---
GL to SEDDOW and Star Frontiers I remember when they came to TEST, good guys the lot of them.
---
Amazing!  I've got the same combination on my luggage!
---
Can't account for it all. Rolling with it definitely sounds more fun. 
---
Thanks for the work you do for this community.
---
So SPVG confirmed best test guild?
---
You say it isn't a narrative, but it is. The financial aspect of the game has been a point used by endless complaints about anything and everything in the game. blackout recently especially had people making statements that the game is dying and any results now would likely just be used to fuel more statements like that.
---
Normally i would agree that something like the financial stability of a game development company isn't something "political" for its playerbase, but this is eve. A lot of people at this point are very invested in wanting the game to disappear out of bitterness on what they enjoyed when they played before. Choosing not to enable that behaviour by limiting or not having coverage of the finances is a hard line, but...
---
Honestly? The more i think about it, the more this seems a push for emotional stability. The guy behind TiS has no doubt invested a lot of his personal time and effort into the game and loves it. Having to deal with constant nonstop negativity about something you love can be bad for your personal mental health. A hard line like this might just be him putting up a barrier to stop himself from abandoning what he loves while keeping his mental state okay.
---
If at first you don't succeed... piss away even more money and resources in another obviously doomed to fail venture.
---
If you just read the comments on this sub you'd think everyone was unsubbed and thinks the game is 2 months away from being totally dead.
---
From what i have seen on my many seconds on the internet. Evèryone that has used the term "groupthink" has been talking out their ass.
---
Donate a titan, and ill trick and treat myself tomorrow.

Wow, every day I am more and more impressed with the amount of bullshit people put up with to krab in peace nowadays. Hopefully some day soon they'll be cured of spodbrain and see that they're basically Mitten's drones laboring down in the mines instead of playing a spaceship game.

Just think of the summer of rage and how many aneurysms these mods would have had.

Keep the killmails, permanently mark them with a big ole asterisk graphic in the corner (on mouseover gives a historical explanation of this period), and exclude them from stats. Bonus points: include them in stats if they meet some heuristics for being a legit kill (like &gt;50% of damage coming from entities that were historically hostile to eachother in the month leading up to this period). What you should actually do: whatever you want, bro, you provide this awesome service to the community for way too little recognition. &lt;3

Make the badge a grim-faced pumpkin.

Have I mentioned that ALL OF YOU are now BANNED from TiS-Discord, you negative salty bitches ... ?

---
Modding out people based on their opinion or their analysis of upcoming information is a dangerous slope. 
---
Topics modded today, 
---
Pearl abyss investors report for Q3 upcoming November 8th (muted and banned) for commenting that it should be interesting. 
---
Commentary from Wibla about TNT's views after vegas which were "cautiously optimistic" nope too far. 
---
Someone posted the glassdoor for CCP games during a convo about CCP game's internal culture guessing banned cause they are not on the server anymore. 
---
There is a difference between banning trolls and banning and muting dissenting information because you don't agree with it. Whoever thought this was a good idea fundamentally killed TiS as a brand.

world of darkness please

Ah, I see, that seems pointless

That's the first thing I thought of too.
---
&gt; not allow anyone's message to dominate using unfair tactics.
---
Very funny you say that, Considering Mat and Lux are actively taking to muting *ANYONE* With an opinion differing from theirs.
---
Seems like the only ones using unfair tactics he are you guys.
---
&gt; It’s exactly what you do in eve, in every site ever.
---
Don’t pretend dude, I got the notification for this comment, which no longer exists. If you don’t understand something, that’s ok. **But don’t make up random shit and then lie about it when you’re wrong.**
---
How would you solve the problem of stuka fleets being incredibly risk-averse compared to most other fleet comps without touching command destroyers then?
---
Obviously there are capital problems that are holding back regular subcap fleets from being used. But if I form a subcap response that does counter stukas, it's just too easy to triple boosh and go home with zero losses. How do you make it so that when I form a subcap counter, I can actually get enough tackle or prevent you from leaving in a way that makes forming the subcap response worth it?
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/79620861/
---
That's totally not true.  You're forgetting the portion that thinks the game *already* died.  (Usually at about the same time that popular music started to suck, and kids became ungrateful.)
---
Despite the reputation,  SNUFF in general and Hy in particular never been toxic. In fact, he is sort of known to be the level-headed and caring one of the two SNUFF content creators, with Tau being more on the loud but engaging side. And SNUFF comms, both voice and text, had always been very decent, especially when compared with others.
---
&gt; Don’t pretend dude, I got the notification for this comment, which no longer exists. 
---
i literally just logged out and was able to see it without issue, so it's definitely a you problem.
---
Ships were shot, structures were bashed, we raged at CCP. So the usual I guess?
---
Jesus fucking christ.   
---
\&gt; TiS isn't a bastion of free speech when that speech includes the assumption that fundamentally *bad* or CCP is *bad* those discussions are for elsewhere.  
---
  
---
tl;dr: Yes, TIS is a biased place that has lost all relevance to actual news about the game, Where one takes a neutral stance and actually covers both sides / opinions of a story.
---
Lol thinking alliance caps will do anything. Just have Goonswarm 1, Goonswarm 2, Goonswarm 3 etc. Shuffle all your actives into the sov-holding alliance so you will always have enough entosis. Make all the executor corps handled by the same group of people. The standing and actual alliance itself is the least important part of an alliance. Auth, services, leadership, and functional teams are the most important part of an alliance, and those all exist out of game.

LOOOOL

It's actually 13,89€ for 3 months of MCT.

It's simple. https://i.imgur.com/BjxxfPI.jpg

Ive always thought that too.  And since I've seen the Look-See it reminds me of it as well....what you think?

We have more chances or having Shield Slaves next patch than seeing CCP play 4D chess.
---
I think you mean "Yaaa Mon"
---
I've seen that face for years and it always seemed to remind me of a Rastafarian. Way back when it was my mining ship.
---
Good times man good times.
---
And can you double its damage please. Its a terrible hull.
---
Improve Gameplay where it’s weak, let gameplay thrive when it’s strong. 
---
Example. Don’t nerf titans for the 1000th time, just change the fleet structure as not to allow more than 3-5 to a fleet. Change cyno mass so every titan needs it’s own in-cyno. Change fuel requirements so you spend billions A piece moving their mega fleets across the map. 
---
Example. There’s very little reason to nerf fighters again. At this point if people are frustrated they can’t kill a carrier with A handful of frigs it’s because they lack skill. Punishing your “whale” players is a great way to break A revenue stream, But punishing long-term players is a great way to kill a game. Make frig Logi better, make Fleet communication easier, improve the understanding of properly skilling into your ships. Nerfs are just lazy. 
---
Final and relevant example. Don’t nerf AF speed into the ground, bump the hell out of their Sig Radius, take away some fitting room then give every combat ceptor opposite buffs. Again, Improve Frig Logi, change the way that their bonuses are laid out, improve movement, But stop breaking things that people log in to enjoy every day. 
---
The easy way out usually fucks you up in the long run, CCP is not immune from it, they play into it. Don’t drag the player base into it.
---
What could possibly go wrong?
---
That's the meat of it. Just rattling a cage screaming about blues isn't gonna solve anything. 
---
I think null anoms should function like WH anoms. Once killed respawns in the constellation so that way it requires people to move though Gates and an added benefit of making bitting slightly harder due to the need to jump though Gates. Sov upgrades could still be used and it would boost the whole and not a single. By far not a great solution but it does get people moving around space more then dog piling one system.
---
&gt; "highly ambitious" is usually CCP code for we don't have the people or expertise
---
it's employer code basically
---
I've applied to enough jobs to recognize this shit
---
You just don’t understand, at all. The sad thing is you are not even willing to try.
---
Hahaha... that's cute. You know, I get it... sort of. They don't want to to turn TiS's community into r/eve (who would want to); however, I don't know where you would draw the line here, but the way this is coming off it seems like its erring on the side of complete silencing the concerns of the broader EVE community, some of which are not just 'group think' and represent serious and heart felt concerns about the game we all love (despite how we all like to say we hate it.)
---
And what's worse is, given that TiS is where CCP employees seem to go for community interviews, right or wrong it smacks of censorship to maintain privileged access to the dev team. 
---
When it comes to journalism, this is *never* a good thing.
---
The loki does the exact same thing with but with webs. I think you lose like 100 or 200 dps for assaults but have triple the range. Unfortunately the loki is just better. 
---
The only reason to use a proteus is super tanked scram as the arazu isn't quite as tanky.
---
I guess you could say being closer is better for wreck lewting. But save it and having a pin to warp to is usually my solution.  Only time I'm that close to an opponent is scany frigs cuz I know they won't scram back most of the time.
---
Its unfortunate that the proteus is the worst t3 atm.. And with ccps balance time line it won't get buffed for another 2 years.
---
That’s actually useless and doesn’t change the drop rate over time.
---
I'd like to note several people have had comments about Hongkong and freedom of speech modded out too
---
meh
---
For that volume I don’t think it would be unless you can be sure the structure will live long enough.
---
Though a refinery with cheap fittings might be worth it, especially if you have a somewhat decent moon.
---
Worst case, if you use a cheap raitaru for compression mostly (I think that works) you can at least make it easy to use refineries and factories elsewhere. If you’re selling to goons, I assume the compression feature would at least be helpful. It’s better than moving raw ore or minerals.
---
If you do decide to own a structure, I suggest you make a holding Corp that is separate from the main corp (not in same alliance) so that at least you won’t have to deal with wardecs on the miners themselves. Proper ACL control can make it relatively seamless too.
---
Yea unfortunately you can't fix stupid. That dude was in a league all his own. Ratting in a Hel in our staging system, with reds crawling all over the place, and no backup. - I maintain you did us a favor there lol
---
He was booted a few minutes later. Apparently he already had a reputation within -7- before this.
---
I am looking into it, and can only stress that no moderation is supposed to be permanent. No one should be being _banned_. The purpose of this post wasn't to state that everything that is happening is fine, but only to help clarify an admittedly short and overly broad declaration.
---
If you want to fly different ships you need ISKies for your toonies.
---
It might not, but it would make for an interesting discussion. I do think that something as big as Facebook or Reddit should be free speech platforms, and Discord is pretty big... I think if your Discord invite link was behind an agreement of some sort that would give the implication that it's more of a private club than a public gathering.
---
But then the zkill stats will be meaningless!
---
O wait, they always were.
---
Carry on.
---
Hes referring to zKill
---
Who was FC for provi
---
Lol your not wrong altho the loki could use a small one imo. But maybe that's my fondness for the tengu.. Loki is ugly af.
---
But does it turn into Megamaid?
---
Wait Provi owns supers? Isnt that just a myth though? Seriously if you all actually owned supers and titans and used them effectively you wouldn't be in this predicament in the first place.
---
Yes. Procurers and Skiffs have a bonus to drone combat.
---
Fax or Logi Rorq
---
Give me a FPS RPG MMO
---
Skills that increase as you use them
---
Give me open world, with player run factions.
---
Destructible structures and world, controllable areas.
---
Shit, I'd just be happy with a PVP Tabula Rasa (haven't hard that game name in a while, right?
---
Having so much hate seems to just make you fart out the rest of your brain i suppose. the cyno changes did absolutely nothing then make it a bit more inconvenient needing an additional character on grid. They dont make it more risky to fly these ships especially not rorqs. As long as rorqs do have their invul there is enough time to form a fast response fleet and as soon as carriers and titans are on grid the rorq is safe, period. It doesnt matter if they are on top or 150-200km off.  
---
How many ganks have you done that worked when the rorq pilot wasnt alone and/or an idiot? Every single drop we did in our SIG we had to abort when their capital response got on grid and I also dont see many rorqs die down in delve for that matter. Just because you think you throw up something doesnt mean it works.
---
Maybe hold off and develop your main money maker so it doesn't die on you. They have been using eve to fund dead projects for 10 years now. Eve could use some serious dev time dedicated to moving it forward. They don't have to give up completely, but it feels like they have given up on eve.
---
&gt; a lot of materall boot lickers on here i see.
---
Don't worry, there's at least not enough of them to get him elected to CSM lel
---
Oh, stop pretending that they exist in a vacuum. They’re going to hear shit they don’t like. In-game. From corpmates. On comms. On the forums. They can make themselves a little walled garden if they like, but only if they stop playing the game. And that’s kind of pointless.
---
 A single medium neut:
---
*”I’m about to ruin this man’s whole career”*
---
Why is that, we have seen this before for the last 10 years and everytime eve suffers. Rmemeber the 18 month drought to deliver walking in stations that was for a completely different game?
---
Absolutely.
---
But I was illustrating a general point regarding moderation. Just wait and see if Reddit stops being moderated for two months, what shitshow it becomes.
---
Orca, four or five Skiffs (Hulk mines more, but the noble and heroic agents of the New Order of High-Sec, who enforce the New Halaima Code of Conduct, might have a word with you about flying Hulks), and maybe a ship to drop the ice off at an Athanor in the system, but that might not be necessary. You can just use the Orca to bring the stuff in while the other ships are mining.
---
For other stuff, you have a good starting capital to get into industry. Use your manufacturing slots for rigs (generally have pretty good margins, unlike a lot of stuff), reaction slots for something.
---
No it’s not.
---
TIL Gorski is a /r/classicwow mod
---
And they would be right, eve has been finding dead projects for years and it's cost them a lot. Now eve is on life support compared to years ago and we are being used to fund another project instead of improving the game. Ccp doesn't have to stop developing other games but maybe if you want eve to continue funding your shit you might want to commit some resources to upgrading it.
---
&gt; 1 orca, 1 freighter/ hauler
---
2 orcas, one to haul, one to boost.
---
For bonus fun you can use the hauler-orca for additional boosts, like agility or something, while your main boosting orca does shields and mining boosts.
---
&gt;  Which means if you light a cyno at 170km every cap can just warp down at 0 on the rorq and safe it. 
---
They changed bubble mechanics?
---
It's trivial for two skilled dictor pilots to keep an inhib a safe space against caps.
---
Yes, I agree. Not sure what the point of contention here even is.
---
Only two actually haul ore, one hauls components and ammo for the goons, it’s always in their little escort fleets, so I run it afk, but I have timed intervals to make sure it’s on course, but freeing up another hauler would really help, means I only have to watch 5 locs 😂
---
The superior mmo
---
tbh I don't either but you have seem to caught the downvote magnet for some reason
---
I thouroughly enjoyed it during the Beta. Then when the actual game came out it was kinda meh but still ok. But as they continued adding new stuff that essentially broke the game I became less and less interested. Cloaky shotgun scouts with 0 cooldown on the cloak is what finally drove me to quit. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't some solo hero either. I played a logistics class running around with ammo packs, a needle and a repair tool. Most of my points were in support of other players rather than shooting enemies. I did shoot at people but my primary thing was keeping the heavy alive and the squad ammo'd up.
---
That's another guy that posted that.
---
I was talking about your overall views ITT. The issue isn't so much that he has rules on his server. It's that it's directly saying don't negatively criticize CCP and it's being enforced via *tone*. There's a big difference between letting GRR CCP memes ride and allowing people to discuss negative things in a constructive way. He's free to do as he wishes - which seems to be pretty clearly trying to get this discord sanctioned as a CCP one. Everyone else is free to point out - without any form of double standard or "america centric"ness - that this is now a propaganda server and not a discussion one where "Ideas and stories are surfaced in a way that is productive to Eve".
---
I'm a friend of matterall and I wish him the best. But it does make sense why some are irked - and they can be this way without going full ancap freeze peach. My point isn't to attack Matterall or what he wants to do with his server - rather I take issue with the fact that you've been trying to paint this into an american thing instead.
---
If you don’t have a scram then your 100mn is not getting away from the mwd proteus before it dies, assuming tackle at 0.
---
I’m not arguing that the Loki is not better at hunting though. Just saying there are situations in which the proteus wins over the loki
---
Nah I’m not bothered to make the effort
---
Lolol, RIP to that predator. I remember losing him but forgot where, refresh my memory.
---
Learn something new every day. Thanks.
---
Train those to two or three. You only need those to five if you are planning to do lots of hardcore pvp.
---
I mined ice for years in High sec.
---
1) don't get greedy and use macks/hulk. Just run pros and skiffs. You'll likely want an Orca and the rest in miners
---
2) This is highly highly highly dependent on skills. Apps such as IPH (Isk per hour) can help you calculate this. [https://eveiph.github.io](https://eveiph.github.io)
---
3) Join a corp, or ninja someone else's belts. A good high sec indy corp these days should be using holding corps for structures.

press login button

(game freezes for 30 seconds)
---
ah now i can actually interact with my ship
---
@jackberich this is your chance
---
well \* .6 is 193 not 195
---
there wont be in this current day and age
---
If you want a war, start a war
---
Really? Have we all just settled too much?
---
Sadly, me and my Corp dueling with the miners one system over doesn’t solve my problems
---
Hiring more people doesn't necessarily mean things will get done faster or more efficiently in software development.  There is a cost to adding more people to a project, and it can sometimes be a negative value add.
---
citadels, fozzie sov, supercap situation, the relative ease of use, safety and creation of super caps,
---
i mean its super hard and not fun and not worth it
---
It most certainly did not. It is simply absurd to suggest that the designers of what is arguably the biggest, longest-enduring, most complex sandbox universes in existence doesn't put much thought into their rebalancing decisions. It's doubly absurd given that the sub-human who made the remark has probably played the game for years, at least in part due to its ever increasing complexity, stability, and persistence. Even the slightest tweak can have enormous, unpredictable downstream consequences as the change interacts with countless parts moving in a sensitive equillibrium. They cannot fully account for the 10s of thousands of creative, human components who will respond to the change in unpredictable, inventive ways. If they were in the habit of making even the slightest decision haphazardly, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now because the game wouldn't exist.
---
No, there is no legitimate in-game mechanic based reason for it.    It's just for the meme.
---
No one would accept it because "hur dur ccp", but what if they just used this as an opportunity to bait out RMT for some bans later?
---
Its almost like people have been rallying for a super rebalance for years.
---
I agree.
