That was over a decade ago. Let me repeat that. Over a decade ago. When the Promethean Titans were just introduced. Now we have thousands of Titans. That's roughly the same as the Amarr Empire has. In Lore they are stated to have a few thousand Promethean Titans and I think 3 confirmed Iapetus Titans. That's not a lot all considered.
---

---
Not to mention that their Fleet doctrine is terrible. Like, Flagship Avatar terrible that leads a Fleet of Capitals and Subcapitals. Honestly, it's more racial Kitchen Sink what they fly and nothing else. Nothing will really stop Capsuleers from wrecking them with superior tactics that they will 100% have.
---
I think that's a dude
---
Look at you being edgy today.
---
If they fixed FW I would resub. I had alot of fun there
---
Dude, capsuleers are immortal and prone to going insane. This shit is probably tame compared to what they would have.

Sadly, my knee was riddled with arrows. Can no longer slap, send halp!

If the chemosh was actually an archon with neut bonuses, and had bonuses that made cenobites actually useful (neut amount bonus) I think that would have been way better and would see more use
---
i would tap it
---
I am going to give my feedback in 4 quads.
---
The first quad will be written when i am ready (when i actually decided what i will say)
---
They showed a picture of a "trig stellar accelerator" citadel-like structure, so I reckon it will drop from them.
---
How to say nothing but include everything. CCP 2019
---
LOL you think it says anything other than "ur gay pwned"
---
you forgot that there was citadels and ships docked by them in abyssal space btw in the concept art

---
People already have - whiptails come ready bricked.
---
The interesting part will of course be the Gameplay update. Hope for some good stuff there. But honestly, CCP should have put more 'meat' into the Keynote.
---
we're adding one new ship this year, fixing some of our shitty ui quirks and hopefully will be banning lots of cheaters. the end.
---
Moderately optimistic. I like the team talks 2 week release schedule for balance stuff, that should do a lot to keep the meta fresh. I do hope they talk more about the larger issues that need tackling tommorow though.
---
that's a titan bb
---
&gt;is it really a matter of highsec being too dangerous
---
That's what the community CCP want to build seems to think!
---
&gt;  human interaction, gate kept 
---
Not actually happening, try again bb &lt;3
---
&gt;about as toxic as you can be as a human?
---
Is this based on your experience in one (1) corp, or were you just not handed anything you asked for and so you are now sad?
---
Burn Jita !
---
Only thing Eve will be invading next is Hospice
---
I know I had no reason to hope for this but I was praying to hear about Dust/Legion/Nova.
---
well human beings tend to beat non-human beings, no surprise there. that's why the empires will never be out there for you to shoot at, they set the background and aren't meant to be contested. which means they don't have a definite number of supercapitals or anything, they are simply set to be on one league above capsuleers, so that their invulnerability to capsuleers makes sense in the grand scheme of things. if the developers decide to reconstruct the background with something else, they will do away with this notion and let the player controlled ships kill their npc fleets- if the competent fcs aren't unsubbed by then, i don't think the average player profile could take on one of those mining response fleets.
---
Can't share with you now apart from the changes to combat ceptors, AFs, booshing, bosons, minmatar ships and medium autocannons, and that's just for November.
---
Good news! Ramjags nerfs 4-6 weeks from now.
---
So a sotiyo that might have a big laser? Lovely. Definitely worthwhile addition.
---
&gt; Triglavian Dreadnought
---
So there is gonna be an XL precursor weapon? And skill for the gun and the ship? Payday for the first 100 people who loot the skills and the blueprints.
---
Also this thing will do ridiculous DPS once charged up. I can already see how some filthy rich basterds use this to obliterate a fleet in a hilariously lopsided "battle".
---
My guess is t3BC

no but we need a toaster and a extension lead

Oh god, can we please not start that again xD

wtf was the "here's some screenshots of things we will talk about" and then the "nature is not 100%"
---
hi jay, how's things
---
the gankfest is going to epic level
---
Fires at least make you feel warm inside. Can‚Äôt say the same for this.
---
This DRAKE remodel is forbidden. @ccp rise if you dare push this redesign there will be grave conssequences...
---
Free the drake or your talos gets it

Look at the base shield HP - [that's an AVATAR boys](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Avatar)
---
I see what you did there.
---
This prediction was actually too optimistic
---
Fuck....agreed with a goon.  This is bad.
---
Yeah nice but they did not go into specifics as they should do.
---
Also minor changes like to combat ceptors isn't anything noteworthy to present it at such a big event. lul 5% more dmg / skill ... -sleep-
---
Counterpoint: at this point, isn‚Äôt skill into meta a part of the problem?  Metas are established and once proven out the games fabled complexity fades into n+1 with competence on both sides?  
---
  
---
Random modifiers at least forces improvisation and adaptability potentially.
---
looks kind of small, corax redesign maybe?
---
Pls no
---
Jibrish already made a megathred
---
Quite frankly the worse most uninspiring depressing keynote ever.
---
Absolutely nothing to get excited about CCP have literally zero passion or interest in this game.
---
I'm actually in shock how bad that was
---
put roadmap on roadmap
---
I was ‚Äúthis close‚Äù to buying tickets for my second Fanfest.
---
But nothing, NOTHING, on Lowsec!
---
Guess I‚Äôll wait until January before deciding and play Total War Warhammer 2 and The Outer Worlds in the meantime.
---
Chaos coming for haulers. Expect highsec ganks 24/7 while this is going on.
---
Yes!! Thank you!

Sooo hot..

---
CCP doesn't want to nerf titans, so they'll let players do it.
---
T-Posing to slowly assert more dps over time
---
Yes because your skill bonuses don't apply to drones in the drone bay
---
Still does, with some folks üòâ
---
CCP so out of touch it's not even funny
---
Nice fucking keynote. Cant believe I stayed awake for this crap.

Thank you for pointing something out I‚Äôve never seen pointed out before in this whole ‚Äúeve endgame argument‚Äù mmo endgames are usually just grinding for that 1% more attack
---
Debout! les damn√©s de la terre,
---
Debout! les for√ßats de la faim.
---
This post had nothing to do with goons though lol
---
Its part of their attempt to make combat ceptors more useful.  Buff the ceptors &amp; nerf AFs
---
Someone finally builds a Palatine Keepstar
---
It gets bricked by lowest possible rolls on the mutaplasmid
---
Cant pick it up if i cant walk in station
---
Is there no batman or bat signal in the new eden universe?
---
Actually I think this will be basically useless. 
---
In the teaser there are 6 attributes that can be affected: 3 HP types, 2 fitting attributes, and jump range.
---
Jump range is pretty useless other than solo boats because you mostly use caps in groups and the rest of fleet won‚Äôt have same range.  
---
HP is also not worth a massive premium (5x-10x for 10%-20% improvement) because most of the time you will die even with the additional buffer. If it only a small amount more, maybe, but the mechanics of abyssal rolling requires large premiums to cover the bricks.  Shield might be a niche exception due to passive recharge and the use in PVE.
---
I could see some value in fitting improvements, particularly for borked ships like the praxis especially, maybe. Not really though, again due to the sheer premium involved.
---
You mean a jump clone?
---
Start by getting people like you to leave.
---
Now all we need are abyssal guns and you can pvp in a ship worth less than 10 isk according to zkill!
---
I'm gay and love big hairy cocks
---
Bait tanking.
---
Nah, they just bait tank.
---
and then they don't even have to deliver on that, like usual, and the idiot masses will sing their praises for 6 months before they realize it was another lie
---
That shit was a blast, thanks to everyone that came out for a pretty great brawl
---
where the fuck is the vod... there is a vod right?
---
&gt; we got a solid two over 3 months.
---
Which all of new Eden REEEEEEEE'd at.
---
Hard to blame CCP for going back to the drawing board on that.
---
On your cell?
---
You know it's just called a phone now right?
---
If by ruin you mean possibly single handedly jump start the economy then yes. Imagine the utter piss-ton of ships getting bricked. Hell may even cause a spur of pvp whelped fights as people get rid of a trash Abyss Ship full of bricked abyss mods that all count as zero isk on zkill.
---
Meh, Wyverns are the new Drake.
---
what the fuck
---
Ooh I'll join
---
TLDR
---
Here's an interesting plot point to consider: In the midst of the unrest between the factions, one of the pirate factions moves into more "legal" territory and starts to do business in New Eden a bit proper.  Perhaps the Salvation Angels, in search of materials to fuel the Cartel, take over a constellation of Derelik ([Mamouna](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Derelik/Mamouna) looks pretty close to the border) and do more "legal" business to fuel their alliance.  An interesting shake-up, pushing some of the pirate factions into low/high sec to help people realize they too are a faction that can have rep gained for and such.
---
When in actuality they'll probably both be made shit, in normal CCP fashion, and not touched for 2 years.
---
dont most cars have curtain airbags tho?
---
one can only hope
---
I mean, it's already had 3 failed iterations and millions of dollars wasted, the odds that it'll ever see the light of day is slim to nil.
---
I'm actually pretty surprised.  I expected CCP to hype up a bunch of shit that was never going to happen, but they didn't even bother to go that far this time.  It really is dead, Jim.
---

---

except that the bumping nerf removed 95%+ of all freighter ganks from the game

Actually stuff that is on production should drop aswell all over k space

Jesus Christ how do you go through life like this man?
---
Me too thanks
---
Aka: years of sucking blue bloc dick has created a game where blue bloc holds the majority is subs.  Since we fucked up so bad for 10 years straight, the only thing we can do is sick more blue bloc dick to keep the game on life support as long as possible so our new masters can get their money back.
---
2 Won (~~W~~) don't make a right.
---
Freighters? No they'll catch on and not fly.  No the big jackpots are going to be abyssal runners with all their bling.
---
We were told not to hit Monitors... some people just can‚Äôt help themselves :)
---
Bear in mind, this isn't a "this is coming" thing. It's a "maybe?" thing. So any numbers are entirely a "mash keyboard" thing, not a "will be released" thing.
---
...20% more. In a 200 on 200 titan battle, you‚Äôre still dead. To get that 20% you bricked 3 other Komodos to get that one. Is it worth 4 Komodos to tank maybe 10-20 more DDs and still die?
---
&gt; rmt hell
---
  Explain
---
Fozzie was banned from public speaking a while back.
---
He also never understood industry, hence Rorqual.
---
RATING HEL HERE I COME
---
You've then bricked an entire Titan hull. Imagine the scam contracts out there for avatars with half the armor HP.
---
&gt; where blue bloc holds the majority of subs
---
  I have a feeling highsec has the most subs.
---
  You don't see them in the CSM- Because the null alliances are better organised than thousands of 10 man highsec indy corps.
---
Great Video and nice multiboxing. I feel like a more offensive droneuse against loki and rodivia would have helped.
---
and something other than the god dam triangle people
---
What?
---
No
---
Oh cool. Yeah i heared already about the af nerfs making them useless again.
---
You heard me. I said: "Kree!"
---
Absolutely won't survive
---
Gotta give you props for jumping the gate balls-before-brain and brawling it out with everyone in range
---
This was all one slide? What the fuck..
---
Sold their soul to Pearl Abyss. Not gonna rant but it seems like the worst decision made in recent memory.
---
Cool shit. I love your detailed proposals sheet and the explanations for us non-FW chumps.
---
I really hope we'll achieve something here.
---
Yeah but It would disintegrate your thorax if you ram it in there.
---
fcon is still dead at least
---
Tiericide, tiericide, tiericide!
---
Yup. It was dumb then and is dumb now.
---
And feedback helps to fix it!
---
Are you the original Baltec?
---
There may not be cheat codes, but there's sure as shit better ways to make ISK. I can't imagine farming up 15b for a super with anything less than a 500M/h income. 
---
&gt;I personally had mine handed to me. Ive only actually farmed a few bill.
---
That's good for you, but I'm not sure it's relevant.
---
While it would certainly do wonders for the economy CCP already cant handling the current balancing workload, how on earth are they going to cope when ship stats they come up with can vary X% across Y attributes? 
---
This seems like another horribly thought out plan that will just break more shit in a few years.
---
So, combat interceptors and assault frigates.
---
History repeats itself.
---
Literally all they had to do was limit MASB to 1 if you have ADCU. Actually combat fitting the Jag was a nightmare because it was so CPU constrained already. Turns out when you don't fit weapons you can do what the fuck you like with the rest of the fit. Whuda think it
---
Out of Sight, Horde burners, what's left of Black Legion, and Ranger Regiment mostly.
---
As hypocritical as it sounds ive ganked a few freighters but its one of the most aids mechanic in this game and should be completely removed.
---
Fucking kpop fan
---
Looks like BL / Origin are coming back so that be intersting to see if they dont throw their weight around
---
this is only for event.
---
C
---
&gt;blackout was great for ganking without recourse
---
Fixed that one for you.
---
There's a good reason all the prey stopped undocking. I both did PvP and PvE in blackout as part of a small independent group and found it miserable, I imagine I'm just one of many.
---
They sucked.. contract it to "tanya talon" :D
---
Wow. This is pretty fucking cool.
---
As someone who played awhile back on-and-off, this is seriously making me consider resubbing to take part. It's just overwhelming though. What sort of things other than mining are there for prospective loners (or possibly even a pack of friends) to do?
---
current mood: cautiously optimistic
---
lets see what team talos can do.
---
There's no reason to even consider asking until someone attacks them, which ideally no one does - but time will tell. There's not much in it for the attackers to do so.
---
Depending on the aggressor, we can potentially just defend it ourselves.
---
In light of BDO's poor handling by pearl abyss this shit show was all CCP's doing, years in the making.
---
New Eden is a star cluster on the far side of staggeringly huge wormhole from earth. People went through, colonized, and the Eve Gate collapsed causing basically a new dark age. Pretty much all knowledge from before the collapse is gone, and humanity did a soft reboot in New Eden. 
---
Basically, if it's part of earth and contemporary culture, it didn't make it to New Eden.
---
Never said that. I said asking for help if someone attacks them.
---
bruvski, you fucked up your formatting of ushra khan link in the last part
---
They didn't mention structure timer changes, or the reintroduction of passive moon mining. So in general nothing will change, but more often balance changes will make it a little more interesting for roamers and small gangers for a while.
---
It's been confirmed very recently by CCP devs (Falcon in particular I believe) that none of the Empires considers even every capsuleer coming together against them to be even remotely a worthwhile threat. It'd be like swatting a fly. 
---
Capsuleers barely register compared to the Empires, and this doesn't even take into account that CONCORD has the ability to killswitch any and all capsuleer they want to.
---
&gt;Only time will tell if we actually see it happen.
---
Here's that same promise 2 years ago: https://www.eveonline.com/article/balance-update-with-eve-online-lifeblood
---
The bittervets on this subreddit decided that someone would have to walk out on stage and announce a plan to systematically solve every problem with the game or else the game would die, and are now disappointed that that didn't happen.
---
It should be 100% drop if there are up to 2 ships on the killmail?  
---
First i was happy for more people in space to engage but then, gate campers are gonna ruin everything. Like i bet i won't have a good solo pvp session in LS due to gate camps.
---
I was the one who shouted about the fitting issue.     
---
Their fit only works IF they sacrifice DPS. Otherwise they have to use compact in basically everywhere including web scram and sometimes even weapon upgrades.
---
university tbh
---
Hey welcome back. If you are interested in a null based PVP group let me know and we can talk and see if the corp would be a good fit for you.

So far I've only seen one fool on this topic and it's actually you.

CCP make money off its playerbase, yes.
---
A grumpy playerbase that all see the bad ideas because they have to 'live with them', and CCP doesnt.
---
I'm not coming off as privileged or anything, am I? I can assure you I'm only interested in seing other peoples opinion on the matter.
---
NB if you have super/titan don‚Äôt join Panfam or Snuff.
---
&gt; It's his kids that listen to ~~Metallica.~~ K-Pop.
---
People are angry that CCP have introduced some very unbalanced features, and have stood by for 4 years and done nothing to stop them ruining the game. For a lot of us vegas is the decider on whether we want to keep playing. Either they announce some of the really simple needed fixes or they ignore the problems and everyone quits.

I'm sorry for your parents.

"What is the Venal Prosperity Network?"
---
it's kinda like NordVPN or those other VPNs but for EVE players.
---
Its not like an 8ly bridge range will cause issues
---
&gt;Only a handful of these will likely ever exist.
---
2004. Titans. Yeah...
---
You don't need to have great skills to run gilas or sneks in a c2 wormhole.
---
I have fits where 3 3 million sp characters can run c4 and low end c5 sites in nestors. The barrier to make large isk isn't that high
---
The problem is, not only will these changes unnecessarily nerf AFs in general and combat uses of the Jag in particular, they *won't even solve the problem of the ramjag*.
---
The example fit I put in my post will still go 5464 m/s hot and at *most* might have to sacrifice the kinetic rig for a fitting rig if they really go full crazy on nerfing the fitting. Meanwhile the ship becomes completely worthless as an actual combat ship, while ramjags *still exist*. This nerf is not only unnecessary and overly harsh, but also ineffective.
---
Lol touch√© on that one.
---
A lot of people don't know or were not here. Before super proliferation the rulers of the galaxy were people who had enough real life income to purchase their caps. 
---
One benefit of super proliferation was it overturned that power from pay to win to people who played the game for their wealth. This also toppled the elite hierarchies that some cultures relied on.
---
You can't be super elite when capitals are not exclusive to your real life finances right, the alternative was training years and grinding several years accumulating wealth or combining wealth - or some such mix.
---
Black Legion was pretty popular residence for the EVE wealthy at one time and is one of the groups that evaporated. This was a different black legion than the reconstituted one we see today.
---
So super proliferation means if you bought your titan at $1000 or $500 or whatever, you probably didn't have the income to replace it when you got jumped by the sheer N+1 that replaced the elitism.
---
&gt;  Also the fitting nerf on the Jag is a great move... The fitting nerf will force the ramlord to sacrifice speed, tank, or damage.
---
Uh, did you read my post? Because I addressed this; you won't be able to touch the ramjag with a fitting nerf unless you nerf it so hard it becomes literally impossible to ever fit it for combat, because one of the reasons the ramjag fit works in the first place is that it's got so much looser fitting restrictions than normal fits. Either you nerf other fits and the ramjag literally doesn't care, or if you actually nerf the ramjag you might as well delete the ship for any other use. I agree the ramjag needs a nerf, but this is so obviously the *wrong* nerf it makes me wonder if anyone at CCP thought about it for more than 10 minutes or has ever tried to fit or fly the ship in any other role.
---
Did you miss the entire paragraph devoted to alternative ways to nerf the ramjag? Because it looks like you did.
---
But listen folks, Gold Ammo can bring the age of pay to win back to eve and give some people purpose.
---
Imagine a foreign army parking their artilery tank on your soil just because you have a non-aggression treaty with you, in case enemy armies (that aren't necessarily hostile or aggressive to you) try to destroy said tank and have to pass your defensive perimeter to do so?
---
That is bluetanking in a nutshell. More or less.
---
If we want the jag to become more offensive, they could need fitting but give a bonus on rocket cpu/pg to make it easier to fit for that role.
---
Why don't you just try?
---
i can imagine the gamblers out there nodding their heads saying roll another 5. what is the best you can get?
---
No, I just showed the differences. Nothing more.
---
wtb fox tail
---
what's the difference between lootboxes and this enchantment mechanics?
---
Yes
---
Absolutely
---
Make your account right now.
---
This game is one of the best.
---
Interesting to see the community so cooperative as it would appear this is reduced down to crabbing and providing a hub for crabs which you profit from. Many people have made their billions or surpassed a trillion seeding markets for groups. You will likely do well as CCP forces people from other revenue streams into those unscathed or left untouched.
---
Goodluck with the venture
---
Already downloading it sir. Based my decision.on the first comment hahaha
---
i am more afraid for FW...this combined with the god awful UI for enchantments will kill FW meta
---
Yup downloading it as we speak. So excited :3
---
Okay then
---
It is worth it, but you'll only get out of it what you put into it. It can be grindy and boring, or exciting and fun depending on what you do.
---
You assume they are not mostly alts
---
Is Great Wildlands Horse space now? Genuine question.
---

OP: Astonished there was no roadmap
---
Goon burners too
---
You seem like a good person to show me the ropes. Mind pming me good sir?
---
Be sure to use a referral code you get like a bunch of free stuff not exactly sure how it works.
---
imagine having to enchant all your FW frigs just to stay competitive and then still losing cause someone rolled 1% more than you did.
---
&gt;But I think if it's something they look to keep
---
What part of "Halloween event" did you not grasp?
---
It's true, there are several things to be addressed.
---
It's the biggest issue for our game, the way we play it.
---
FW PVPers put in the work and 3rd parties get rich and prevent us (and the other faction) from doing our job properly.
---
So why play the game when others profit from this and try to spoil our fun with bigger and bigger tools we can't afford?
---
We want this to be about faction warfare, not about Tiers, Mission pve LP and "the pendulum".
---
FW will die soon if nothing changes soon.
---
The issues from people in other bubbles always seem insignificant to their own bubble. While I couldn't care less about a nullsec blocks issues and they about our issues, I still understand their point of view, but... you know... I care more about my area of the game dying fast, if nothing happens
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid to explore and try new stuff.
---
There are so many different ways to play, you‚Äôll eventually find something that you really enjoy.
---
Remember, this is no Theme Park MMO, you‚Äôre not gonna play through the game on rails.
---
You have to make your own story day by day.
---
I would recommend keeping a journal of the things you do every day and eventually you‚Äôll have a wonderful story that you wrote (mostly) by yourself.
---
Believe me, i'm not against PvP by anymean, i welcome PVPers out here if they wanna hit up some of the targets in the area. Plenty of Russians and Chinese running missions - easy pickings.  
---
Sure, destruction may also drive up my prices, but a new potential customer in the area is a new potential customer in the area to me. So i don't wanna turn anyone away regardless of their chosen play style.
---
alias checks out
---
Community, time and consideration.
---
Yeah. There is always something to do in Eve
---
Yeah, I didn't mean to imply that FW should be low on a priority list as such. It was more that there are some *fundamental* issues that needs to be fixed in Eve that is quite literally breaking the game. 
---
Skill Injectors, Rorquals, capital/super proliferation is a trifecta that completely breaks the entire game, including FW as a peripheral. 
---
Until these infinite mineral and isk faucets are clogged, and whatever broken mess takes its place can't be instantly shifted to with skill injectors, fixing FW won't be enough to make a return to Eve viable. The game will remain fundamentally borkd. 
---
FW certainly still deserves a significant overhaul on its own merits, though. Didn't mean to imply otherwise.
---
Welcome! Tutorial is highly recommended. It will give you descent amount if ships to start. And do not hesitate to ask questions. Community is helpful in general.
---
lol this isn't philosophy. this is math
---
this is the worst and most bloated way to do it.
---
You don't understand what p2w is, do you?
---
just think about all the blingy mission runners
---
No, demanding people to read isn‚Äôt unreasonable. Period. 
---
Like, cool you‚Äôre dyslexic. Sorry that it makes this harder than you. Apparently you‚Äôre also fucking retarded.
---
What else is there?
---
And the funny thing is, even with the constant login events they are still losing subs by the thousands...
---
AFs are overused. Not sure speed is the right thing to nerf, but a nerf was a must.
---
imagine thinking RMTers use loot drops to exchange wares....that meme has to die already
---
I can't tell whether you're implying something hopeful here or not. &gt;.&gt; I will choose to believe this is a good thing?
---
Yes we rent the sov from ourselves.
---
Tbh thats all eve has ever seemed to be, the pack of kids running around kicking down someone elses sand castles. You could almost call it "Tall poppy syndrome: the game"
---
What a great way for CCP to support RMT... Now they don't even need to rely on luck anymore  just fly out in space and get shot by the buyer...
---
They are only OP in very niche situations like 1v1. For fleeta where aloha matters they are garbage. Also apart form the kiki that can kill any ship below cruiser class (apart form kiting jackdaw and hecate), none of them is really op.
---
If you're so knowledgeable then please explain to me why this is not P2W? You buy plex, turn them into Isk, these into ships and brick them until you get a good roll. And with equal out of game skills you win.
---
Adding more and more new ships instead of improving underused ships is one of the dumbest things CCP do these days.
---
*Cries in astrate and eos.
---
Oh no this is me
---
I love this. I stage my cloaky hunter out of a trade hub in the great wild lands. Very well stocked. Dude is friendly. I like to think I die a good amount and help keep the dude in business. Sort of like how you go out of your way to visit a local store to keep it alive
---
Or just follow the damn rules. They‚Äôre not hard to follow. In fact, even when you break them people tell you ‚Äúok, do this‚Äù and if you do you‚Äôre good to go. 
---
Idiots like this don‚Äôt follow the rules, then when Directors reach out and tell them to leave they say ‚Äúgo fuck yourself‚Äù. Guess what happens next?
---
They‚Äôre blue. That doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have to follow the rules.
---
Wow this exists holy shit
---
Thank you, thank you
---
You don't win anything, no matter how many titans you buy with real money, if you are retarded and can't fly them
---
You all gonna get farmed. Have fun!
---
afs don't just dumpster everything in their class, they rendered t3ds obsolete outside of the hecate and... f1 fleet jackdaw i guess? also things like the navy omen are literally unusable because of afs alone. they also took any sort of skill requirement out of tackling, 4km/s and adcu is a guaranteed scram on anything just by clicking approach. they are also cheap enough that they are easily viable as suicide tackle. yes the nerfs are warranted. if there's a way to nerf the braindead approach scram fits without touching the combat ones sure. but they do need nerfs, they are way too cost efficient and easy to fly for how strong they are.
---
FCs. Not "FC's".
---
Ah, they got with the old " announcing that eventually there will be an announcement " trick.
---
jag has really anemic dps to actually win fights, in my experience it will call for the blob and survive the blob, but not actually get any killmails
---
Haven't yet...And if some people wanna come around here and "farm" the place? I know some locals in system that would just LOVE an influx of new content!

Nice to see 44th Recon are still going strong.

You're not, I posted a similar thread and then a bunch of dudes pointed out how it was a joke that went totally over my head. So I nuked the thread.

That will be from the end of a 19-part Escalation event; only 1 will drop, and it'll be 14,000 m3 (because that's the only size box the guy at New Eden Amazon had left).

hey now, you can't have blank space all over the keynote slides

And where do you think that stuff comes from? There is stuff because there is an economy. That's what an economy is: stuff moving around, value being added to it, then moved again until it is consumed. You are at the very tail end of that and have the vision to see only what's in front of you.
---
they should just thanos finger snap it twice every once in a while imo
---
You're doing wonders for content mate, keep it up.
---
Fair enough - I will admit it's a pretty cowardly way to present my Rp. It's in part due to me thinking most people on this subreddit don't really care much for PR. More so RP that isn't really dependent on any of the big and established factions, most of the RP work I've put in have been based off a faction i designed myself.

Also please make the heavy bomb icon a "v", I sexually identify as a Tu-22M "Backfire" naval strike bomber.

You can't tell me you didn't see this one coming. 
---
  Stukas were oppressing any fleet fights that consisted of more than 100 dudes, and booshers reduced pretty much any fleet - even muninns - to a fucking keep at range 2500km on anchor type. 
---
  The way they implemented it is actually really good, because you can still use booshers offensively (boosh off excavators, logi wings, half their dps, stuff off gates etc) while it finally brings back fleet fights to a level where good positioning and anchoring actually matters.
---
Lol, 10/10
---
Someday TM

Also and and an are the same word.

I some a few more typos, but won't dig too much on it. Seems like he made the presentation hastily, while on the plane form Iceland.
---
Nothing wrong with the content though.
---
Naive me probably thinks that they have problems with spaghetti code, he said a lot of times that implementing change x would be a lot of work.
---
Realist me doesen't care anymore
---
That sounds a lot like someone waiting several years for ccp to fix eve but it never happens
---
Lol. What super umbrellas have anything to do with it?
---
Not being able to touch a 100 ravens fleet is ok, you say?
---
Fuck stukas and any kind of cluster booshing fleets. That's cancer...
---
It's so poorly thought out I feel like I'm at a meeting at work.
---
Nerf assfrigs and booshers. No boost for T3D. Just some tiny boost for A ceptor. Genius move.
---
If you do this, as is, you will never get serious bombing runs off. Whatever subcap ships end up carrying the mega-bomb, it needs to take reps and tank caps (and subs).
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/the-boss-JtxVuVSoiDsQg
---
 Maybe if you're finding the game stale its because your alliance is sat in one place, blued to everyone around them, and nothing to do but mine. Again, I'm not saying the game is in an amazing state but surely you can't expect to get heaps of content doing stuff like that?
---
lol happy birthday brother
---
* Position attack BCs 300k + bomb flight time from enemy fleet. Have some defensive Sabre bubbles in front if you're feeling elite.
---
* Launch bombs
---
* use 3 MJD destroyers to deliver bombs to caps
---
* Warp Attack BCs off before anything can kill them
---
* Laugh at how much easier this will be to time if CCP do end up making these bombs slower
---
Supercaps yes, dreads/fax no. Which makes it all the more funny that CCP decided to implement a new dread
---
And also that gives a niche role for booshers, that will get nerfed. Booshing small, 20 anti-cap slow BC squads, that require high skill and make impact if used well.
---
THE DREAM!
---
Try checking out r/evejobs or the ingame recruitment channels!
---
cyno is already nerfed brother
---
Good point, I should unsub
---
Eve is not even close to the most complex game anymore. It's not 2003.
---
Will give it a try thanks!
---
Definietly not unpopular, definietly karmawhore. I kinda wish sobbypost filter was a thing.
---
What about 'strategical'?
---
Oh sweet summer child still trusting flairs
---
[deleted]
---
First off you didn't read my post, I worked for riot for starters so yes I have worked on complex games.
---
2 there is no game that is exactly like eve, however over the years they make the same mistakes with balance passes, and their balance passes are not often enough. Most online games currently shoot for miner balance tweaks every few weeks or so and big changes twice a year or so.
---
3 I didn't say I could fix eve, I said I lost faith in their ability to ever balance it. However small tweaks once a month or so to ship and or module stats until the game is somewhat balanced would help.
---
I'll happily take a nerf to booshing/stuka fleets on the same day that I can use ANY other doctrine under the umbrellas when I inevitably get 50 supers dropped on me lol
---
I want a T2 Rokh blops BS that drops bombs like a B52 with missile bonuses to torps and rapid heavies.
---
Me too üòÑ
---
I heard a rumor that you can add plex instead of ammo for this ship and it will triple your damage per seconds. Obviously, each second deplete 1 plex. MOAR PLEX, MOAR DPS !1!1!
---
&gt;"grrr I can't AFK rorq mine anymore the game is dead"
---
If the people who complain about not being able to do things that shouldn't have been possible in the first place all quit AND stopped whining on Reddit, the game and community would be better off.
---
Attack BCs can fit MJDs
---
I may try it down the road, but after watching it spend 4 years as a tech demo before it even got to something resembling an alpha version, on that budget they have, makes me nervous.
---
it does less damage to smaller ships now
---
All those points are exactly my thoughts aswell. I was really surprised to hear that tiericide has a low return on time used. I completely disagree about that. Think about all those modules that suddenly become viable, and actually make sense to use.
---
Many of the officer modules on armor reppers are completely overshadowed by their x type counter parts. So like 25% of the modules are in such a bad state thay objectively make no sense to use at all.
---
A resist debuff would be super interesting indeed, it would need to be very strong to justify a bomb run vs just more DPS.
---
Maybe ECM bombs ?
---
If it's taking you that long in a gila in tier 1, you're probably doing something very wrong as caracal's can do 2 with time to loot. Got a fit and the things you generally shoot in those sites in order?
---
Gila should absolutely stomp T1. I did em solo in a garmur for a while. 
---
What's your gila fit and DPS? 
---
And are you shooting targets in the right order (For example you don't need to ever shoot trig drones, just the ships that control them, then the drones die)
---
Rail nagas, arty nados, smartbomb machs or t3cs.
---
It was fun while it lasted.
---
Hey, you‚Äôre the one whining on reddit. Can‚Äôt handle a basic observation?
---
You should get Sort going sometime.
---
Is the 6x boosher excavator stealing still a thing after the prices dropped from 1b to 550m?
---
I agree with the gist of this. The retri is already the slowest AF. The issue is that it does too much damage. But yeah after the nerf a MG snaked retri won't be a thing unless you take quafe and overclocker every time, and even then it won't go 4k
---
Reducing resist..that is an interesting concept. Totally useless unless its in a big fleet fight. Then it may be very useful.
---
Calls pointing out a funny happenstance whining.  
---
Fails to notice a hint towards "Fuck this area in Particular" meme.
---
Gotta inflate those numbers somehow : )
---
Pretty sure they've existed in the db since the other serp caps were released. Chances are their market visisbilty is a mistake.
---
Well there's also the idea that if heavy bombers are bonused like stealth bombers in terms of dps, having 5-6 launchers on them could easily cause them to do &gt;1300 dps by themselves. just considerably more optimized towards big targets.
---
So if bombs are anti-command bursts that function as well opposites of what exist in terms of command burst, small groups of them on the field could provide considerable dps in addition to negating or mitigating hostile command bursts.
---
Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the North Atlantic dropping hot  anti ship missiles on disgusting capitalist capital ships. People say to me that a person being a supersonic bomber is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install variable sweep wings, NK-25 engines and KH-22 missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Backfire" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're an F-14 Tomcat and need to check your AIM-54 privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
---
&gt;When you played for 10 years and the devs actively make the game that you love worse
---
At this point, you're likely somewhat burned out.
---
They just need to give them a single timer and make offline citadels have no timer.
---
lol Adversity, go figure.
---
if heavy bombs do anything useful.. they will bitch on reddit until they nerf them so cant really get that excited about it.
---
Whats worse is the pussies who want rewards nerfed and than are surprised there is less content because there is no rewards. Dumbest development is changing the safety dial instead of just leaving shit deadly and harsh - but with great rewards worth undocking for those prone to the watering hole.
---
E: fortunately, great hopes for next year as development will likely choose the rewards worth undocking route instead of relying on safe enough to undock.
---
yeah don't mind me, the guy with 30 trillion ganked.

In short, I get laid without even having to TRYING!
---
I've always found it amusing as hell in real life to tell people the absolute truth, since the truth with me tends to be..well..amazing.
---
At least in real life though I get to bait them into doubting me, then proving it too them that everything I say is 100 percent TRUE!
---
Can't/won't do that here, but I'm still having fun between lays. See while you were having on about pixel spaceships and related matters. Bots. RMTs, nerfs, buffs, and so on. I had very LOVELY company. First of the day. Another one lined up for later!

Why would I be interested in impressing internet clowns? My neighbor's collie's opinion of me means more to me. I'm just amusing myself even deigning to talk to you lot. Oh by the way. The collie has been dead for a few months, yet his opinion STILL means more to me than yours.
---
CHEERS!
---
It's not like it would be guaranteed that your stuff is gone when you have to take a break. Your corp/alliance is there to make sure this does not happen. Removing asset safety would accentuate this relation and the mutual trust it entails.
---
 Even more trust would be in the equation if in case of an evacuation your allies could take care of your belongings. Of course you'd  have to trust them that they do nothing naughty...
---
nerfing rewards should only be done if you want that activity done less.

---
the statement 'people tend not to use missile ships' is totally wrong, and you would know if you ganked at all.
---
people use missile ships ALL THE TIME, the fact you don't know this shows your stupidity, your ignorance, and your downright inexperience
---
&gt;idk how many times i have to give you facts to refute your point for you to finally drop your wrong point
---
Wow I should have just read this comment and then spent 2 extra hours playing the Outer Worlds instead of watching the fucking panels
---
yeah give us a screenshot of your fit dude as something seems pretty wrong.

 im running T4 electrical at the moment and not really come into any real danger and have at least 5mins spare after looting all 3 rooms fully. probably going to pay the ship off before doing T5s.
---
Its not fake...
---
They popped the mom for the incursion, so the incursion is no longer there..
---
The purpose of Titans and Supercarriers should be anti-capital ships, simple as that. If a subcap fight escalates and one side brings in Dreads or carriers, they're a counter-escalation. That could be their only purpose. Massive damage, but limited application.
---
The wormhole change would be to allow for more travel, more variability in hunter choices. Wormholes see bomber fleets go through them all the time. Why not allow bigger fleets to use them too? Battleship fleets using them to roam is something I would love to see.
---
As for blackout, I personally liked the idea. Making it permanent does seem excessive, hence why I said it could be an event of some kind. From your reaction, I assume you didn't like it. If it was really that bad for player numbers (and not just bots), then sure, let's forget it.
---
This retard comment gets upvoted to the sky? What a shit time to read this subreddit.
---
&gt;you are still telling me that ganking with a Vindicator is a good idea
---
the fact you can't think of a scenario where ganking with a vindicator is a good idea shows your pure stupidity
---
it's not ideal, but sometimes it must be done
---
... Uh.
---
So what you're saying is, screw my friends, screw everyone else, I should be having fun playing the game *by myself*?
---
This is an MMO, if you forget. It's not a single player game.
---
If I hadn't bothered doing anything with people I wouldn't have made the friends I have in the game, wouldn't have joined the corp I did *because of* those friends, or fought in battles to *help* those friends.
---
Except for very limited things, I'd guess almost everything I do in game is *because of* the friends I have made in the game.
---
I'd argue going outside of the game and having fun with those friends *still* has something to do with eve because I never would have met them otherwise, and most of everything we do together revolves around this game.
---
We know that ridiculing and bemoaning CCP here hurts recruitment. That's the point, so they'll have to listen or suffer the consequences.

Except it isn't. The overwhelming majority of suicide ganking ships are gunboats. Outside of the one niche situation you are trying to present as actually being *all* situations. Do you understand what the word "tend" means?
---
&gt;hurr durr stupid ignorant inexperience
---
This sort of ranting is really ironic coming from someone who doesn't seem to understand that he's not actually addressing what people are saying in any meaningful way.
---
If you're not playing 24/7 you are already missing out on isk (and therefore skill points) compared to bots. By not multiboxing 20 rorqals you are also missing out because your time isn't as profitable as some other people. I understand the sentiment but in the grand scheme of things that sp from dailies is fairly inconsequential for veteran players. I personally only bother doing it with 1 alt and my main sometimes. It's a nice little extra but I won't go out of my way for it.
---
Because it's terrible. You end up with people doing retarded shit like setting a macro to turn their afterburners on and off repeatedly to gain a skill point in Acceleration Control and going afk for 16 hours
---
Did you undock more during blackout?
---
Gee wonder why they didn't bother to counter a booshing Raven fleet.....
---
What are your eve goals that you can‚Äôt accomplish?
---
hah, hard to tell snark from genuine stupidity here
---
Hey Holesale guy, you should un-anchor the keepstar for no fucking reason
---
Passive vs Active skilling and gathering systems are something I've been thinking about and looking into for quite some time now. They both have their ups and downs.
---
When it comes to skilling
---
Passive Skilling
---
* Easy to use
---
* "Grind Free"
---
* Can be done offline
---
* Static, meaning there's little to nothing you can do to make it faster
---
Active Skilling
---
* You get skills while playing the game
---
* Can be significantly faster than Passive
---
* Gives a good feeling of progression
---
* Easier to create and skill new characters
---
* Very grind heavy
---
Active Skilling usually always turns into Passive one with macros as its the most efficient to do
---
Behold a D-tier post.
---
If you want to print money, a single Rorqual won't get you very far.
---
Lower bomb speed means easier to boosh. But;
---
1) The 1 km explosion radius requires you to stagger the bombs to deal damage with all of them. You can't order your entire fleet to bomb at the same time and deal damage with all of them. This means the maximum number of these bombs that you can carry over with booshing is 12. More than that mathematically won't deal the damage. It is also practically impossible for your fleet to get a perfectly optimized stagger with 1 km distance in-between. So you'll probably be able to carry over no more than 4-5, even with stagger, and that still requires each individual fleet member to communicate. So basically your scenario is RNK level shenanigan inaccessible to most fleets at best, practically impossible at worst. 
---
2) Slower bombs also means easier to firewall or use defender missiles against. That's the main anticipated counter to these bombs and it will still work against booshed bombs.
---
OP buying half the market in the hopes price rise?
---
Thats way more effort than anchor and F1.
---
I haven‚Äôt logged in, in a long time.  But I know this feeling so well.   Such an amazing community.
---
The core tenant of your post (other than cleaning up excess waste) is that:
---
&gt; a player might not be able to afford meta4 while not having the skills for meta 5  
---
AFAIK, only launchers have expensive meta 4 mods.  
---
Fuck, Meta 4 cap boosters beat out Meta 5 most of the time for less ISK.
---
Is NPE revamp actually a bad thing though?
---
Why even have citadels then, or pos for that matter.  
---
Lets all store our shit in invincible npc stations and live life out of a mobile depot with tether.

---
Your comments are the most low IQ takes I've read on this topic. Educate yourself before you post again. 
---
I'm tempted to block you just so I don't have to read anything you type ever again. 
---
But first I'll start your education. Making players like OP mentioned leave, will cause the game to bleed players. Students during assignments, people on holiday, soldiers, those who can't afford to do Eve shifts all day every day should never be punished. If CCP ever removed it completely at this point, you and the handful of others who would remain aboard the sinking ship wouldn't have enough weapons grade autism to keep the lights on.
